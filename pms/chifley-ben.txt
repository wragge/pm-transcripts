IMPORTANT SPEECHES
BY
THE PRIME MINISTER
( THE RIGHT HON. J. B. CHIFLEY). 
MIGRATION.
PASSPORTS--RESTRICTIONS, RELAXATIONS.
On 18th June, 1946, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Calwell) announced
that restrictions imposed under National Security Act Regulations on the
issue of passports would be lifted from 1st July, 1946. Passports for Japanl
would be excepted. Any person would then be able to secure a passport
to leave Australia by complying with the usual conditions. Restrictions
on the issue of passports to doctors and nurses would be lifted. Previously,
passports had been issued only to doctors and nurses wishing to do postgraduate
courses or gain experience in overseas hospitals. Persons going
to Britain must undertake to remain away for twelve months or until shipping
facilities became available for their return without inconveniencing
persons in the priority classes.
BRITISH MIGRANTS-CHILDREN.
On 2nd July, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Legal guardianship of British children who were evacuated to Australia
during 1940 for the duration of the war was vested in the Minister for the
Interior ( later changed to the Minister for Immigration), and through him
in the various State Child Welfare Departments under National Security
( Oversea Children) Regulations. Of the 577 children who came to Australia,
over 100 are remaining here, some temporarily to complete educational
courses or apprenticeships and others permanently.
Cabinet decided to-day that, with the expiry of the National Security
Act on 31st December, 1946, legislation be introduced to enable the Minister
for himnigration to continue as the legal guardian of overseas children who
remain in Australia and also as the legal guardian of children brought to Australia
under any governmental or non-governmental immigration organization."

STRIKES-PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH.
In Parliament.-On 4th July, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley)
said-Rightly or wrongly, and I am not entering into that at the moment,
men in Queensland are on strike. I am not attempting to condone the
strike I merely point out that if the men have decided that they will not
work, they cannot be forced by law to go to work. What then is the next
step They may be fined, and if they do not pay the fine they may be
sent to jail. But the application of such a policy has never been successful
in settling an industrial dispute. 1 defy anybody to prove to me that such
action has ever produced industrial peace or effected a settlement of an
industrial dispute. I have been associated with many industrial disputes.
Even if a mistress has a difference with her house-maid, I am expected to
intervene. The Leader of the Country Party ( Mr. Fadden) wants me, on
behalf of the Government, to intervene in the Queensland meat dispute,
Ilthough the State Industrial Court is in control of it and the State Govltenent,
under its emergency powers, is operating the. relevant legislation
to deal with it. What form of intervention does he propose Does he
want me to order the men back to work
I cannot visualize the Commonwealth Government intervening in this
dispute, regrettable though it is. I do not attempt to condone it. The
State Industrial Court, and the State Government with its emergency powers,
has all the law that is needed. Will the enforcement of that law bring
the dispute to an end We know that it will not. Intervention ly tile
Commonrwealth Government would only make confusion worse confounded.
All the parties to the dispute have been strong-minded, and have
hotly supported the stand they have taken. There is too much strongmindedness
in many industrial disputes. I do not deny that I would have
tried to induce the parties to come together. I could not, of course,
approach the Industrial Court. I do not know whether the State Government
or the Premier would be able to make any approach to the court,
because it has made the declaration, You must go back to work before
we shall do ; nything'. The employers say, We will not meet you until
you go back to work The reply of the employees is, We will not return
to work except under pre-strike conditions'. Mr. Fadden has urged that
the Commonwealth Government should intervene because of the influence
that is being wielded by Communists. I have received hundreds of telegrams
from those whom he has described as Communists, asking me to
intervene in total disregard of the State Industrial Court and the State
Government. To do that would be to destroy the effect of the Queensland
law and the judgment of the Industrial Court; not that that would worry
me very much, because I believe that there are some faults on that side.
In my opinion, had the employers been prepared to give way a little, the
strike could have been settled.
Mr. Fadden wants me to override the State Industrial Court and the
State Government, by the exercise of a power possessed by the Common.-
wealth in other words, to flout the Queensland law and the State court.
We have been unable to discern in what way any law that we could operate
would be more effective than the laws which the Queensland Government 
has the power to operate. Their application, of course, does not get the
men back to work. There a great deal that I could say about the dispute
but I do not waut to add fuel to the fire. I have been very disappointed
at the trend of events. As a matter of fact, almost every day since I
returned front abroad I have been told that negotiations were proceeding
, and that the dispute would be settled. Yet it has dragged on from day to
day. I do not want Mr. Fadden or this House to believe that I am happy
about the position. If the Commonwealth were to engage in a fight not
nily with the strikers, but also, if you like, with the'employers, the Queensland
Government and the State Industrial Court, the state cf affairs would
be akin to legislative anarchy. Had the Commonwealth Government issued
an order stating that the meat-workers should return to work under prestrike
conditions, the order would have been obeyed. But that would
have been a complete flouting of the Queensland Industrial Court. It
would have 1le e totally at variance withl the wishes of the State Government
; aid would have been violently opposed by the employers. Merely because
we did not wish to flout other laws that were operating in respect of the
matter, such an order was not issued.
The matter does not involve a return to work at award rates.
Apparently, some agreements between the employers and employees have
been operating for a period of years, giving to the employees considerable
benefits which are not provided for in the award. At least, that claim is
made by the employers and the court. The matter does not . touch the
tour men who were dismissed from their employment in a bacon factory.
I believe that their dispute could have been settled by the court separately.
The Communists, near-Communists, or Cryptos-call them what you willare
the very people who have been asking us to step in and override the
State laws by saying to the employees, ' Go back to work on pre-strike
conditions The dispute is most unfortunate. I do not make any apology,
nor does the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Scullv), for having asked the
Meat Controller to see whether personal contact would produce a better
feeling and result in the men returning to work.
We cannot drive men back to work. They are really in no different
position from that of the milk producers who refused to supply milk. Men
have the right to refuse to work. I admit that it is unjust to the community.
In the final analysis, I suppose men have the right to dispose
of their labour just as the man who produces wheat or any other commodity
has the right to dispose of it.
I believe that if suitable action had been taken to bring employers and
employees together a settlement might have been reached long ago. However,
I cannot see why the Commonwealth Government should attempt to
override the State Industrial Court in opposition to the State Government,
, or why we should attempt to override the State emergency legislation."
UNEMPLOYMENT-FIGURES.
In Parliament.-On 4th July, 1946, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction
( Mr. Dedman) said-
The total number of persons unemployed in Australia on 21st June,
1946, was 11,100, about 60 per cent. of whom were receiving unemployment 
benefit. The other 40 per cent. were receiving a re-employment allowance
as ex-servicemen while awaiting employment in the type of work thrlv
desired." PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.
POULTRY FARMING-EGGS, CONTROL, CESSATION FIXED.
On 19th June, 1946, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Scully) announced
that the control of the egg industry under National Security Act Regulations
would continue in operation until 31st December, 1946, when the Act expired.
It was previously proposed that control should cease on 30th June, 1946,
in view of the establishment of a central organization by the several State
Egg Marketing Boards known as Egg Boards of Australia Limited which
intended to take over control of the industry as from 1st July, 1946.
Circumstances precluded the company from commencing operations and he
had authorized continuance of Commonwealth control until 31st December.
1946, before which date the position regarding the organization should he
clarified. EXPORTS TO BRITAIN--EGGS.
On 19th June, 1946, Mr. Scully announced that exports to the British
Ministry of Food from Ist July to 31st December, 1946, would be 1,000,000
cases of eggs, equivalent to 30,000,000 dozen eggs as well as about 20,000,0C. 1
lb. of frozen egg pulp, equivalent to nearly 17,000,000 dozen eggs.
COTTON-BOUNTY.
On 2nd July, 1946, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Fraser) said that
the Raw Cotton Bounty Act would expire on 31st December, 1946, and the
Government had decided to introduce legislation to extend the operation
of the Act sc that producers would be guaranteed that the present net
return of 15d. per lb. of raw cotton above the grade known as strict good
ordinary" would be continued on cotton produced in Australia during
1947 and each year until 31st December, 1951. The guaranteed net returns
would be computed after taking into account the net return from by-products
of raw cotton. Raw cotton of '. strict good ordinary" or lower grades
would continue to receive bounty at half the appropriate rate as provided
under the Act. The bounty had been extended subject to'the Queensland
Government making every endeavour to implement undertakings given
during 1939-40 to improve the efficiency of cotton growing.
PARLIAMENT.
BROADCASTING-BILL INTRODUCED.
In Parliament.-On 19th June, 1946, the Postmaster-General ( Senator
Cameron) introduced the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Bill.
Senator Cameron said-
The broadcasting of the proceedings of the Commonwealth Parliament
has received the careful consideration of the Government, and it has decided
that arrangements be made for these broadcasts to be introduced during 
tihe present session. Investigations have demonstrated that it is not
practicable to ( establish a separate network of medium-wave stations to
broadcast the proceedings of Parliament. In any case, the establishment
of such a network would involve an expenditure in the neighbourhood of
' 500,000. The Goverunment considers that it would be preferable to commence
the service on some modified plan which would not cause so much disturbanice
to existing programme arrangements. The Government has reached
the conclusion that the service should be commenced on an experimental
basis, the broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings being confined at the
outset to the second national station in the capital city of each State and
in Newca: ttle. If, as expected, the innovation proves acceptable to the
public, it will 1) 0bnee cessary to determine from time to time the extent to
which the facilities it is intended to use at first should be expanded. Accordingly,
provision has been made in the bill for the employment of such of the
other national stations as may be prescribed. Consideration would, of
course, be given to the use of short-wave stations.
The Government holds the. view that control of the broadcasts should
lie exercised by Parliament itself through a joint parliamentary committee.
The bill accordingly provides for the appointment of a committee including
the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.
It will be appreciated that there are a number of details to be settled in connexion
with the apportionment of broadcasting time between both Houses
of the Parliament when they are sitting simultaneously, and in regard to
the rights of members, technical and programme arrangements. It is the
Government's desire that the joint committee should examine all these
questions and recommend to Parliament the general principles on which
the broadcasts should be undertaken. After the adoption of its recommendations
by both Houses, the joint committee will control the subsequent
arrangements. From tinm'' to time questions may arise which will require
prompt attention and it is desirable that the joint committee should have
authority to delegate, to a sub-committee, its powers to determine the days
on which, and the periods during which, the proceedings of either House
shall be broadcast.
" The Government accepts the view that the immunities and privileges
applying to debates within Parliament should be extended to the broadcasts
parliamentary proceedings.
The Bill embraces the foregoing conclusions and, in anticipation of
it being acceptable to Parliament, arrangements have been made, with the
concurrence of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House
of Representatives, for the erection of a control booth in each House and for
the installation of such equipment as is necessary to enable the broadcasts
to be undertaken. It should be practicable to commence the broadcasting
of parliamentary proceedings before the end of the present session, the actual
' late being determined'by the joint committee, which will be selected as
; oon as the measure becomes law." 
In Parliament.-On 20th June, 1946, Senator Cameron moved the
following amendment:-
One of the members of the committee shall be the President of the Senate, one
member shall be the Speaker of the Hou.' e of Representatives, and, of the other four
members of the committee, two shall be members of, and appointed by, the Senate
and two shall be members of, and appointed by, the House of Representatives.
[ The amendlment w~ is carried.]
In Parliament.-On 4th July, 1946, the Minister for Information ( Mr.
Calwell) moved an amendment to the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting
Bill to provide that the Joint Committee on the broadcasting of
parliamentary proceedings -hlould comprise nine members inst-:: r! of six.
[ The amendment was carried and, later, was carried in the Senate.]
[ The bill was passed.]
In Parliament.-On 5th July, 1946, the Speaker ( Mr. Roscvear), chairman,
the President ( Senator Brown), Senators Arnold and Gib-, o, Messrs.
Corser, Fraser, Haylen, Holt and Sheehan were appointed members of thl
Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings.
In Parliament.-On 5th July, 1946, the Joint Committee submitted the
following report:-
Days on which proceedings shall be broadcast: The proceedings of Parliament.
shall be broadcast on each day on which either House is sitting.
Period during which proceedings shall be broadcast: The broadcast shall commence
on each sitting day at the time fixed for the meeting of the House whose opening
proceedings are to be broadcast on that day as determined by the Joint Committee.
and shall cease when the adjournment is moved in the House which is being broadcast
at that time.
Allocation of broadcasting time between the Senate and tie House of Representatives:
The allocation of broadcasting time between the Senate and the House of Representatives
shall be in accordance with the views of the Joint Committee, or its sub-committee,
on the importance of the impending debate and the public interest attaching thereto.
The committee recognizes that in practice more time will be allotted to the House of
Representatives than to the Senate.
Re-broadcast of questions without notice and answers Within the limits of time
available, questions without notice and answers in each House shall be re-broadcast
between 7.20 p. m. and 7.55 p. m. on each sitting day.
Broadcast and re-broadcast through national stations: No broadcast or re.
broadcast of the proceedings of either House shall be made except through national
broadcasting stations unless the Joint Committee otherwise determines.
[ The report was adopted.]
PRIVILEGE-PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS.
In Parliament.--On 4th July, 1946, the Acting Attorney-General
( Mr. Holloway) introduced the Parliamentary Papers Bill. Mr. Holloway
said-This bill proposes to give absolute protection against civil or criminal
proceedings, for example proceedings for libel, in respect of the publication
under the authority of a parliamentary committee of any document laid
before the committee or of any evidence given befo: re the committee.
The Parliamentary Papers Act, which the bill proposes to amend, provides,
amongst other things, that no action or proceedings, civil or criminal
shall lie against any person for publishing any document published under
the authority of the Senate or the House of Representatives. Tlhe act does
not apply to publication under the authority of a parliamentary committee 
but where the evidence given before a parliamentary committee is tabled
in either House of the Parliament and ordered by that House to be printed
the protection given by the act applies.
However, when evidence is tabled and ordered to be printed, a large
number of copies must be printed to meet the requirements of the circulation
list for parliamentary papers. For example, on the tabling of the report
of the Standing Committee on Broadcasting regarding proposed staff
regulations for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the number of
copies printed was 660. It is considered that the expense of printing the
weidence before parliamentary committees as a parliamentary paper is not
always justified. As an instance, the Standing Committee on Broadcasting
considers that the number of copies of the evidence given before it which,
generally speaking, need be printed is about 40. I feel sure that where a
committee itself arranges the publication of evidence before it with the
object of saving public money, it should not be deprived of the protection
of the Parliamentary Papers Act. It may be that the publication is already
privileged either at common law or by virtue of section 49 of the Commonwealth
Constitution, but it is considered desirable to put the matter beyond
doubt. The bill is designed to achieve this object and applies to documents
; nd evidene, published after 23rd September, 1943." [ The bill was passed.]
ENEMY ALIENS.
OVERSEAS INTERNEES-INQUIRY, MR. JUSTICE SIMPSON'S
REPORT.
In Parliament.-On 19th June, 1946, the Minister for Immigration
Calwell) said-
Mr. Justice Simpson was appointed by the Government to inquire
into the cases of a number of enemy aliens who were still being held in
internment. He was asked to report to the Government as to which
persons should be released to remain in residence in this country, and as
to which persons should be repatriated to their homelands. The Government
has decided to carry out Mr. Justice Simpson's recommendations in
their entirety. A number of perons are being held in internment pending
repatriation they will be repatriated as soon as shipping is available.
If shipping is not available before the expiration of the National Security
Act, special legislation will be enacted to enable me to give effect to
Mr. Justice Simpson's recommendations."
On 2nd July, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
When the National Security Act ceases on 31st December, 1946, there
will be no power by which enemy aliens interned during the war and whose
repatriation has been recommended by a Supreme Court judge in the
interests of public safety and the defence of the Commonwealth can be
repatriated. Further, because of lack of shipping, it may not be possible
to give effect to the judge's recommendatious before the act expires.
S" Cabinet to-day decided that the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Calwell)
prepare a bill to provide for the repatriation of aliens who were interned 
during the war and after an inquiry by a judicial authority are deemed to
be a menace to the security of the Commonwealth the control of the movements
of aliens interned during the war and released while awaiting
repatriation following a judicial inquiry which deemed them to be a menace
to the security of the Commonwealth and the repatriation of aliens who,
after a judicial inquiry, are deemed to be a danger to the security of the
Commonwealth." NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.
BILL INTRODUCED.
In PI'rliaentl.--On 19th June, 1946, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction
( Mr. Dedman) introduced the Australian National University
Bill. Mr. Dedman said--
The Government is anxious that the national university which this
bill seeks to establish should be established in such manner that it will bring
credit to Australia, advance the cause of learning and research in general,
and take its rightful place among the great universities of the world. For
this reason I will sympathetically consider any amendment, with th,.
object of helping the university achieve these ends.
" Australia has gained a justifiably high reputation in university
teaching and research, and the Government believes that the establishment
of an Australian national university at Canberra will bring still further
credit to our country, not only by the work done within its own walls by its
own staff and research students, but also by collaboration and co-operation
between its members and the research workers and teachers of the other
Australian universities. With the help and encouragement of other
universities, anid of all men and women'of good will, the national university
will soon be in a px: ition to take its share in solving many complex problems
which are the joint responsibility of all universities.
The establishment of a university is a matter of considerable complexity
and a very great responsibility. For this reason the Government
has not acted hastily. I have discussed the problems involved with the
Minister for the Interior ( Mr. Johnson), with other Ministers concerned.
with the Vice-Chancellors of the Universities of Sydney and Melbourne
and with groups of distinguished scientists who have been called together
by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Education to advise on the
general and detailed questions associated with this project. In addition.
the Government has had the help and advice of the Canberra University
College Council.
The essence of democratic government is that all national issues must
ultimately be decided by the people themselves. To me it is more than
ever important at tais stage in Australia's development that the Australian
people should have available everything they need to permit their decisions
to be made wisely and after a full understanding of the issues involved.
Both in Australia and in the world at large, innumerable problems await
solution if the future is to be made safe and the people placed in a position
to enjoy the fruits of the developments in science and in human relationships
during the last six years. The first thing that must be done is to 
ensure that these developments are studied in relation particularly to their
. Lpplication in Australia. Progress in physical science has culminated in
the harnessing of atomic energy and this has brought the world to its final
crossroads. Mishandled, these discoveries in the physical world can make
peace and prosperity impossible. Properly used' they may introduce an
era of happiness and prosperity unparalleled in world history. It is essential
that Australia, in common with the other nations of the world, should do
ieverything possible to foster that careful research which will allow us to
become the masters, not the servants, of our physical environment. In
medicine, too, the outstanding achievements of the war years await full and
proper application to the civil needs of our people. Once again this implies
patient research by all the talent at our disposal and demands the establishnient
of appropriate institutions at which this research may be conducted.
The Government feels that the university now proposed for Canberra is
nHe appropriate place in which this research may be carried out. On the
side of human relationships, our continued development, and a full under-
-tanding of our problems, requires that we encourage research into the
social sciences. Here, more than in any other field of learning, Australia
lhas an outstanding contribution to make to the world at large. In
economics, history, law, anthropology, and in all the related social sciences,
Australia i n a particularly advantageous position.
We lave also greatly increased responsibility to shoulder in relation
to other people, and particularly to those with whom we are associated
aI a Pacific power. The whole field of Pacific studies awaits fuller development
than it has previously received in Australia. Our relations with the
East, with the Americas, with the East Indies, New Zealand, New Guinea
, ad all the Pacific islands, must be carefully studied so that they may
l,' come friondly and fruitful if our future is to be safeguarded and if we
to make our full contri! bution in the councils of the nations. Here,
iur opportunities are unique. Our remoteness enables us to consider the
fundamental issues involved, free from the day to day fears and turmoil
tliht beset, many of the great Powers. For that reason we have a duty
to the world at large which we must recognize if we are to be accepted as
a world Power.
The Iill is very straightforward and needs little amplification. It
follows in broad outline the general plan of government which operates
successfully in other universities, both in Australia and overseas. It will
be noted that the functions of the university lay particular stress on postgraduate
research and the research schools of immediate importance to
Australia are set out, but nothing in the bill prevents the establishment
of other research schools that may appear essential to the governing body
f the university. It is recognized that facilities must be made available
in Canberra to meet the increasing needs for undergraduate studies anud
for special training for officers of government departments and provision
is made to enablb this to be done.
The governing authority of the university is to be council consisting
of not more than 30 members and to be composed partly of elected members
and partly of members appointed by the Govcrnor-General and by the 
Parliament. The university must be free to administer its own affairs
without any pressure from outside, otherwise decisions on highly complex
technical matters may be taken which are not in the best interests of the
university, and which may prevent it from carrying out its work efficiently.
The appropriate safeguards against such outside interference are contained
in the bill which specifically refers all matters connected with the
government of the university to the council.
" I do not anticipate that the university will be in full operation for
some time, but it is essential that as much basic planning as possible be
completed so that the necessary plans can be laid for buildings and other
essential work. The acute shortage of labour and materials for building
will prevent an immediate start being made on any accommodation for the
university. I propose that the bill be amended to permit the appointment
of an interim council to carry out the work of the council until that body
can be properly constituted and appointed, and in particular to undertake
the preliminary work relating to the planning of the university.
The Government is concerned that the university should be able to
plan ahead, particularly cn its research side, and I propose to provide the
university with a grant which will be reviewed every five years rather than
to leave it dependent on the funds voted annually by Parliament. The
Government proposes to make available in the first five years, commencing
with the financial year 1951-52, the sum of Å“ 325,000 a year. The amount
will be reviewed every five years thereafter. In the period before July,
1951, such amount will be made available, to a maximum of Å“ 325,000 a
year, as is actually needed to meet running expenses. The Government
will provide sufficient funds to enable the university to start with buildings
worthy of the objects for which they are built and in keeping with the best
types of architecture in the Capital Territory. Accordingly the Government
has approved Å“ 872,500 for buildings for the university. This amount
will not be required immediately, nor will it be drawn from any one budget.
The vice-chancellor, as the administrative head of the university,
will be, in many ways, the key member of its staff. In the first instance,
it is proposed that the vice-chancellor be appointed by the Governor-
General for five years. All subsequent appointments to that office will
be made by the council. It is vital that the vice-chancellor be a man of
outstanding administrative ability, and, if possible, of high academic
standing. I believe that he must at all costs secure men of world reputation
to supervise the work of the various research schools." [ The bill was passed.]
COAL-MINING INDUSTRY.
CONTROL-COAL CLIFF COLLIERY.
In Parliament.-On 20th June, 1946, the Minister for Supply ( Senator
Ashley) said that losses in the operation of Coal Cliff colliery by the Commonwealtb
had been-
Year ended March, 1945, Å“ 28,350; year ended March, 1946, Å“ 27,652. 
LITERARY CENSORSHIP BOARD.
MEMBERS RE-APPOINTED.
On 20th June, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) announced that
Dr. L. H. Allen ( chairman), Prof. J. F. M. Haydon and Mr. K. Binns had
been re-appointed members of the Literature Censorship Board for three
years from 25th June, 1946. Sir Robert Garran had been re-appointed
Appeal Censor for the same period from the same date.
DEFENCE.
POST-WAR-RIFLE CLUBS.
In Parlirmeni.-On 20th June, 1946, the Minister for the Army ( Mr.
Forde) said--
The Government has authorized the re-establishment of rifle clubs as
from 1st July, 1946. The departmental organization for the administration
of the rifle club movement will be on the lines in force before 1931, when
the rifle clubs were a civil movement under the Department of Defence.
POST-WAR-BRITISH COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE.
On 27th June, 1946, the acting Minister for Defence ( Mr. Forde)
announced that Lieutenant-Generals S. F. Rowell, C. A. Clowes and F. H.
Berrvnan, and Brigadier R. King would attend a defence conference of the
commanders-in-chief of all British army commands at home and overseas
and of representatives of the Dominions in Britain in August, 1946.
WOOL.
MANUFACTURES-SUBSIDY.
On 20th June, 1946, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Fraser) announced
that subsidy would be paid to maintain existing prices of wool to Australian
manufacturers for utilization in goods for domestic consumption, when
auction sales recommenced after 30th June, 1946. The purpose of the
subsidy was to enable Australian manufacturers to compete with overseas
buyers in a manner that will avoid interference with normal auction purchases.
Subsidies would be paid to manufacturers to re-imburse any excess
paid in purchasing at prices for domestic consumption but not in excess
of the average market level for individual wool types at a series of auction
sales. That ensured that manufacturers would not bid extravagantly on
the assumption that the Conunmmonwealth Government would meet deficiencies
resulting from unlimited bidding.
WHEAT STABILIZATION SCHEME.
POST-WAR-BILL INTRODUCED.
In Parliament.-On 20th June, 1946, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr.
Scully) introduced the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill. Mr. Scully
said-Wheat has been a troubled industry for many years. For a decade
before the war, it was frequently in a depressed condition and constant
assistance from governments was. required. Prices were low and growers 
could not obtain a reasonable living from their labour. Other wheatproducing
countries were in a similar plight, and wheat presented the
world's greatest agricultural problem. The need for stabilization in Australia
was recognized, but it is beyond the power of any Commonwealth
Iovernment to stabilize the industry. Joint action by all Australian
governments is necessary, because both States and Commonwealth are
vitally affected by matters concerning the wheat inditstry. Although the
prcblem is old, to date it has not been possible to get agreement on a plan,
and the method of operating it.
The bill is intended to give security to the wheat industry in Australia.
It provides growers with a guaranteed minimum price for wheat for five
years, and has the machinery to maintain minimum price guarantees as a
permanent feature. The effect will be to remove the feature which disturbed
the industry most in the past; that is, the impact of unduly low
prices. It will be replaced by a system under which wheat farmers will
know, for a period of years in advance, that they will receive a definite
price for their wheat. They can plan their farm programme with an assured
return, and with the knowldge that they will not be ruined by market
changes which cannot be foreseen or controlled. The stabilization proposals
represent the considered judgment of governments and growers, first, as to
the measures needed for tlh industry, and, second, as to the best way to
effect them. Co-operation with the States is an essential part of the plan.
The States control production, and production must be regulated according
to the markets available for our wheat. In marketing, Commonwealth and
States must use their constitutional powers in harmony if the plan is to be
effective; neither can provide effective marketing unaided. In the plan
now proposed. the States have shown their willingness to co-operate with
the Commonwealth. It has been discussed in detail with State Gove lnmn.-
its, and they have agreed to bring complementary legislation befdre
their parliaments. The Government has consulted wheat-growers' organizations.
The' plan was discussed with the Wheat Growers' Federation in
December, 1945, and growers' views on its details were then expounded
fully. The various points stressed received consideration and it has been
possible to meet them in full. The bill represents the greatest practicable
measure of co-operation between governments and growers to settle the
problem of the wheat industry.
The plan provides a miinimum guaranteed price for wheat for the
period 1945-46 to 1949-50. It provides for review during the currency
of the scheme, with a view to its extension beyond the five years. Growers
will contribute to ai stabilization fund, when prices are high, and the
contribution will be not more than 50 per cent. of the excess of the export
price above the guaranteed minimum price. The Commonwealth will
meet any deficiency in any one year should the stabilization fund become
exhausted. A central marketing organization will be responsible for the
marketing of the Australian wheat crop, and production will be regulated
in accordance with thl markets available. The guaranteed price for the
seasons 1945-46 to 19,19-50, is 5s. 2d. a bushel f. o. r. ports for f. a. q. bagged
wheat. This miinimum will apply to the whole of the marketed crops. 
At present, a home-consumption price applies to wheat used locally for
flour. This will be extended to cover other wheat used locally. There is;
in addition, the very important point of the guarantee for export wheat.
Control over local wheat prices is always possible, but the grower will now
get protection against slumps which have been a regular feature of world
markets, and the Commonwealth will take a financial risk to give that
protection. It is intended that the guaranteed price will apply for five
seasons, but, . before the period is up, the plan will be reviewed, and a fresh
guarantee given for a further period. The intention is to have regular
reviews, and to maintain always a guaranteed price for some seasons ahead.
The first period has been fixed as a reasonable period of security and a
reasonable period for a fixed commitment. The guaranteed price is the
minimum return, and growers will get more when export prices are high.
They are given a definite floor price.
A contribution from growers is provided for. It is considered that,
in principle, a government guarantee, which is really a guarantee from the
taxpayer should be accompanied by contributions from growers when
prices are high. This principle is accepted by growers and a 50-50 contribution
is generally conceded to be fair. When prices are high, growers will
contribute up to 50 per cent. of the excess above the guaranteed price of
export wlheat. The money so subscribed will go into a stabilization fund,
and will be used to meet the guarantee when prices fall. The fund will
be a trust fund. There is no intention of building up an excessively large
fund, and, if prices remain higher than is now expected, the contribution
will be reduced below 50 per cent. The effect is that growers will make a
reasonable but not an excessive contribution, and the Commonwealth will
meet the guarantee if a run of low prices exhausts the fund. This means
that growers will share in the extra amounts from high price years, and are
assured in advance against a price below 5s. 21.
It is not proposed, that returns shall be permanently out of line with
the export price, nor that the industry will be continually subsidized. Twothirds
of our wheat goes on to the export market, and we must compete
with other countries for our markets. The plan gives time for adjustments
to meet changing world conditions, and it protects growers against a rapid
fall on the export market. It cannot relieve them of the need to meet
world competition in the export trade. It is hoped, however, that an
effective internatiolal agreement will protect . export markets in future.
For the next five years, come what may in the export field, growers are
guaranteed against the effect of a world slump. They will not receive in
any one of the five years less than 5s. 2d.
The difficulties of making a guarantee effective can hardly be overcome
without a central organization for marketing. A wheat board will be set
up to handle and sell the crops with the benefits of war-time experience
and of an efficient organization. The board will succeed the war-time Wheat
Board and carry on its -work. In its new set-up it will operate under joint
powers conferred by Commonwealth and States, and the statutory power
to operate will relate almost entirely to wheat covered by the State acts.
Regulation of production is a part of the plan in which action would
be impossible without full State co-operation. The long history of wheat 
gluts and wheat shortages has shown how easy it is to go from one extreme
to the other. Wheat gluts build up fast, and the low prices which result
have had a disastrous effect in past years on wheat farmers here and overseas.
Over-production must be avoided in the future. We wish to produce all
the wheat we reasonably can, and to sell it at a price fair to growers and
consumers. We want to avoid temporary high-price expansion in the
industry which would leave it over-capitalized and unable to carry on when
prices recede. Deliberate regulation according to markets available is a
new departure, but it offers the best prospect for avoiding a return to the
disastrous see-saw from glut to scarcity. It may seem odd at present to
be thinking of regulating wheat production. Australia is now trying to
produce the maximum crop and to supply everything possible to meet overseas
needs. But we must prepare for whatever may come in the future,
and it is likely that, within a short time, a wheat glut may recur. If it
does, farmers will again be faced with depression, and precautions against
that must be taken now.
Normal pre-war basis of production can be maintained and it will be
practicable to include in the industry soldier settlers and farmers' sons.
I hope that conditions of world trade in the years to come will give an
outlet for all the wheat which Australia can produce. If so, there will be
room for expansion to the limit of economic productive capacity. It must,
however, be realized that farmers cannot go into the wheat industry one
season, and out of it the next. Once in it, they are committed to heavy
outlay and years of production. Boom years are a menace because of the
danger of high land prices and over-capitalized farms, leading to a financial
structure which is not able to meet low or medium price years. For that
reason, the production basis must be decided with the greatest care. The
plan is intended to make the wheat industry sound financially. Regublltion
Sof production-not restriction of production-has been recognized over
the years us one requisite for any plan. That is recognized not only by
governmnts but by the growers; and growers are willing to co-operate
in regulation of the industry to secure the wide benefits of stabilization.
Regulation of production was brought in as a war-time measure, and now
can readily be adapted to peace-time needs. It is a State function, and
Commonwealth and States will co-operate to secure uniformity in administration.
There aire two Commoniwealth bills, and complementary legislation
will be necessary in each State. It is considered the State legislation can
be covered by one act, and one object of the discussions was to secure
uniformity among the States. The Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill
provides the mechanism for carrying out the plan I have outlined, and for
co-operating with the States in all necessary matters. The Wheat Export
Charge Bill completes the work by providing for the charge which forms the
Urowers' contribution to the hill. Difficult problems will be met in administration.
I am confident that they will be overcome by the partnership of
Commonwealth and States.
The Wheat Charges Bill, to be introduced later, provides for a maximum
contribution of 50 per cent., or a lower rate if prescribed, of the difference
between the guaranteed price of 5s. 2d. and the average export price in 
; any one year or such part of the export price as is prescribed. It is proposed
for the 1945--46 crop, that the contribution be 50 per cent. of the difference
between 5s. 2d. and 9s. 6d. bagged. The average export return isestimated
to be ] 0s. Growers will be paid from the pool on the following basis:-
2d. a bushel for domestically consumed wheat, and for export wheat
2d. a bushel plus 50 per cent. of the difference between 5s. 2d., the guaranteed
price, and 9s. 6d.-which is 2s. 2d. and a further 6d. on export
wheat, this being the difference between 10s. and 9s. 6d. It is estimated
that, for the whole of the wheat marketed local and export, the grower will
receive 6s. 7d. a bushel f. o. r. at ports bagged.
Summarized, the two bills provide-
The preservation over five years of a price of 5s. 2d. a bushel f. o. r. at ports. bagged
for all wheat consumed within Australia.
A guarantee by the Government of a minimum price for export of 5s. 2d. a bushel
f. o. r. at ports bagged.
When the export price exceeds the guaranteed price, growers to contribute to a
fund to an amount not exceeding 50 per cent. of the difference between the export price
and the guaranteed price of 5s. 2d.
When the export price falls below 5s. 2d., the fund will be called upon to provide
the amount necessary to bring the export price up to 5s. 2d.
If and when the fund is exhausted in any one year, the Government under its
guarantee will provide, out of general revenue, the funds necessary to bring export prices
up to 5s. 2d.
For the 1945-46 crop, the Government proposes that the grower will be paid on
export wheat 5s. 2d., plus 2s. 2d., plus the excess of export returns over 9s. 6d. Under
this arrangement, it is calculated that, for the whole of his sales, export and local, the
grower will receive 6s. 7d. a bushel f. o. r. at ports bagged.
The scheme, including the guarantee, is to operate for five years. During its
: urrency, however, reviews will be made with a view to continuing it under conditions
which may or may not be revised, beyond five years.
The plan is designed to provide for stabilized returns over a period of years. Funds
will be held on account of growers in years of high prices and paid out in years of low
prices. But the Government underwrites the scheme to the extent of guaranteeing
that, whatever be the rise or fall of the market over five years, the farmer will get a
return not less than 5s. 2d. a bushel f. o. r. bagged at ports. [ The bill was passed.]

EXTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS.
FUTURE POLICY-TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BILL INTRODUCED.
In Parliament.-On 20th June, 1946, the Minister for Information
( Mr. Calwell) introduced the Overseas Telecommunications Bill. Mr.
Calwell said-
This bill deals with the transfer to national ownership of the external
telecommunication services now owned and operated by Amalgamated
Wireless ( Australasia) Limited and the establishment of a statutory
corporation to operate both radio and cable services linking Australia with
other countries. This bill is one of similar pieces of legislation which will
be enacted by the parliaments of all self-governing countries in the British
Commonwealth and Empire. The step being taken in Australia is part
of a unified plan. recommended by the British Commonwealth Telecominunications
Conference in July and August, 1945. The conference reached
the unanimous conclusion that, to secure the desired strengthening and 
better ordering of the British Commonwealth telecommunications system,
a fundamental change in the present organization was necessary. The
conference recommended-
That the private shareholder interest in the ownership of overseas telecommunication
services of Britain, the Dominions and India should be replaced by public ownership.
That the government in each country should acquire the ownership of the telecom.
munication assets in its territories.
That the type of organization established in each country to own and operate the
external telecommunication services should as far as possible be uniform.
That a Commonwealth Telecommunication Board be established to replace the
Commonwealth Communications Council, with functions mainly advisory in character.
but extending to all the national organizations throughout the Empire instead of being
related only to the London organization as under present conditions.
The conference also worked out a system of pooling of net revenues.
in a central fund, from which out-payments for the maintenance of the
board and the maintenance of the submrine cables could be met, after
which the residues would be returned to the respective national bodies.
Legislation to give effect to the recommendations of the conference
has been introduced in the British House of Commons and provides for the
acquisition of the shares of Cable and Wireless Limited, apart from the
2,600,000 shares which it already owns, : nd the payment of compensation
to the shareholders. Another bill is to be introduced later for the establishment
of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board and for the carrying
into effect of the full scheme recommended by the 1945 conference.
The bill before this House provides for the full implementation of the
recommendations of the conference and the ratification of an overall agreement
in the form set out in the first schedule to the bill. The bill provides
for the establishment in Australia of a government commission as a
corporate body, to acquire the ownership of and to maintain and operate
the overseas telecommunication services at present conducted by Amalgamated
Wireless ( Australasia) Limited and by Cable and Wireless Limited
in the -territories of the Commonwealth of Australia. The commission will
be called the Overseas Telecommunications Commission ( Australia).
Provision is made for the assessment of the compensation which will he
payable to Amalgamated Wireless ( Australasia) Limited. The bill provides
that the amount may be determined by agreement between the commission
and the company. In the event of agreement not being reached, the
amount may be determined by a compensation board. If either party is
dissatisfied with the amount of compensation determined by the board,
an appeal may be made to the High Court. The assets of Cable and Wireless
Limited to be taken over by the commission will be transferred by the
British Govermnent to the commission at an agreed price to be paid in cash
Employees of the two companies who have been exclusively employed
by them on telecommunications in Australia for three years or over, and
for whom suitable employment can be found by the commission, will become
entitled to appointment to positions in the service of the commission, with
preservation of their accrued pension, superannuation, furlough and other
rights. If it is not found possible to re-engage all the employees affected.
it is proposed to come to an arrangement with the companies so that the
employees affected will not be placed at a disadvantage. 
The commission will acquire, operate and maintain all the overseas
telecommunication services hitherto owned and operated in Australia by
Cable and Wireless Limited and Amalgamated Wireless ( Australasia)
Limited, including in the latter case the operation of coastal and island
radio stations which handle wireless traffic with ships at sea and similar
traffic exchanged within and between territories of the Commonwealth.
The national corporations throughout the Empire will undertake research
: tad developmental work to improve the efficiency of services. This work
will be co-ordinated by the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board in
London, and that board will also undertake research work on behalf of all
partner governments. It is contemplated that the commission shall, if
so desired by another national body, undertake to act as agent on agreed
terms in maintaining and operating overseas telecommunication services in
regional areas adjacent to Australia.
Power is conferred on the Miiister to approve of any contracts where
-upply, either directly or indirectly, of imported equipment or material
of a value exceeding Å“ 5,000 is involved. This provision will ensure that
lue consideration is given by the commission to the use of equipment manuf1ctured
in Australia before steps are taken to import material of any
ippreciable value from abroad. The powers conferred on the commission
io not detract in any way from those entrusted to the Minister administering
the Wireless Telegrapliy and the Post and Telegraph Acts.
Conditions under which advances will be made to the commission shall
be determined by the Treasurer. The form in which the commission will
keep its accounts will be subject to the approval of the Treasurer and to
inspection and audit by the Auditor-General. Annual reports and financial
statements of the commission, accompanied by a certificate of the Auditor-
(' cncral. will be submitted to Parliament.
The c-inmluission will arrange free handling of meteorological telegrams
exchanged with ships at sea and of similar messages exchanged between
Commonwealth meteorological offices and stations. The commission will
handle free on behalf of the Post Office other telegrams for transmission
within the Commonwealth in cases cf interruption to land-lines, in return
for which the Post Office will arrange free transmission of messages relating
to the commission's administrative affairs.
The duties and functions of the Commonwealth Telecommunications
Board are set out in detail in the overall agreement which becomes a part
of the bill. The costs of the board are to be met in agreed proportions
from the net revenues of the several national bodies.
In the overall agreement, a form of tripartite agreement is drawn up
for execution in due course by each partner government concerned, the
Commonwealth Telecommunications Board and the local national telecommunications
body. This tripartite agreement defines the relationship
which will exist between the several parties thereto and, in particular, to
mutual responsibilities of the local national body and the Commonwealth
Telecommunications Board. It provides for the establishment of a central
fund into which the national bodies will pay annually their net revenues. 
" Of the subscribed capital in Amalgamated Wireless ( Australasia)
Limited, amounting to Å“ 985,518, the Government owns 500,001 fully paid
shares and private interests 485,517 shares. Under the agreements to which
I have referred the measure of control exercisable by the Government is
incommensurate with its majority shareholding. The agreements are so
greatly in favour of the company that, apart from approval or veto of'
tariffs and the granting or withholding of licences for new services and--
even this later right by the Government has been denied by the company-.
the Government has virtually little or no control at all over the policy of th,
company. Government representation on the Board of Directors is limited
to three out of a total of seven directors constituting the board. Effective
co-ordination and control of overseas telecommunication services in
Australia in the national interest is impracticable of realization so long as
two separate companies own and operate the two respective means of
overseas communication, cable and radio. The transfer of the services of'
both companies to the Government will enable their complete co-ordination
under a single operating authority, and will ultimately enable cheaper rates
to be offered to the users of the services through the avoidance of existing
duplication of effort and of overhead costs resulting from the conduct of
the respective services by two separate undertakings. The acquisition by
the Government of the telecommunication assets of Amalgamated Wireless
( Australasia) Limited will involve a reconstitution of the company to enable
it to continue as a manufacturing, commercial broadcasting and patentholding
sales and servicing organization. The Government proposes to
retain its proportionate shareholding in the reconstituted company, if the
private shareholders of Amalgamated Wireless ( Australasia) Limited so
desire. Provision for this would not be appropriate in this bill, and
suitable steps towards this end will be taken later, if necessary."

announced that airmail facilities had been resumed between Australia
and the Netherlands East Indies.

WOOL AGREEMENT.
NEW AGREEMENT-JOINT ORGANIZATION, FIRST MEETING..
On 23rd June, 1.946, the Prime Miniister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" The first meetings of the Dominion and British directors of United
Kingdom-Dominion Wool Disposals Limited have been held in London.
The company has been entrusted by the Governments of Britain, Australia,
New Zealand and South Africa with the double task of effecting orderl * y
disposal of accumulated war-time surpluses of wool and at the same tim' 4
maintaining anl appropriate degree of stability in prices.
It will attempt to achieve the first objective by offerinc, at auctionl
its stocks of wool alongside current clips in accordance with supply and
demand in the world's markets and to achieve the second objective by
regulation of offerings and by means of reserve ' prices at which it will be
prepared to buy in growers' wool at auction. It will, at all times, endeavour
to act impartially towards tbe interests of the various parts affected or
likely to be affected by its decisions and the company makes the following
preliminary announcement:
His Majesty's Governments in Britain, Australia, New Zealand
and South Africa have considered the recommendation made by tho
Joint Organization pursuant to the terms of paragraph 6 of the Wool
Disposals Plan and have decided that the initial general level of
reserve prices for DoiioDs' Wools sold in the Dominions shall be
the same as tbe present average selling price, ex store, in the
Dominion concerned. It is the intention that this inlitial level shall,
in the absence of circumstances at present quite unforeseen, be
maintained throughout the wool year 1946-47.
Individual reserve prices for the wool year 1946-47, apart fronm
exceptional cases, will not be changed throughout the year.
The sale of wool at fixed prices b or on behalf of, the Joint
Organization will cease on 30th June, 1946.
Orders agaiinst which allocation of wool has no~ t been made, oil
or before 30th June, 1946, will be cancelled. 
Sales by auction will commence in Australia at the beginning of
September, in South Africa at the beginning of September, in New
Zealand of crutchings and of old wool at the beginning of September
and of new wool in November, and in Britain in September. The
precise dates on which auctions will commence and details of the
selling programme will he announced later.
Details in broad technical descriptions of the stock estimated to be
held by the organization at 30th June, 1946, will be announced as soon as
possible." On 27th June, 1946, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Scully) announced
that the Wool ( Contributory Charge) Assessment Act and the Wool
( Contributory Charge) Act, assented to on 11th October, 1945, as an
essential part of the plan for the stabilized marketing of accumulated stocks
of wool in conjunction with current clips, had been proclaimed to operate
as from 1st July, 1946.
In Parliament.-On 27th June, 1946, Mr. Scully said-
The agreement between the Governments of Britain; Australia, New
Zealand and South Africa for the disposal of accumulated stocks of wool
and of oncoming clips provided for decisions by the four Governments,
of a reserve price for the season, below which sales would not be made, and
for a contributory charge which would be struck in each country to meet
the industry's share of the cost of administration. The general reserve
price agreed upon is that price at which wool is at present being sold
ex store. For Australia, this is, on average, 18. l1 ( Aust.) a lb. The
contributory charge decided upon by the Comuonwealth Government is
per cent. of the value of the wool, which works out at .91d. ( Aust.) a lb.
average. The price of 18.15d. a lb., less the cnurributory charge of .91l., gives
a net average return of 17.24d. and this is 1.79d. ( Aust.) more than
the average price of 15.45d. ( Aust.) over the whole clip payable by Britain
under the war-time agreement. This must be considered very satisfactory
to growers, because it gives to them, in effect, an overall minimum
guaranteed return substantially greater than that received by them under
the war-time contract." WAR ARCHIVES.
On 25th June, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
In 1942, the then Prime Minister ( the late Mr. Curtin) formed a War
Archives Committee under the chairmanship of Dr. C. E. W. Bean, who
was historian of World War to investigate measures for the preservation
of Australian records and documents relating to World War II.
I have now approved of the scope of the committee being broadened
so that its functions include the preservation of all Conunonwealth records
and not only records relating to the war. The committee will be known
as the Commonwealth Archives Committee. Its functions will be to study
archival principles and practices and to submit recommendations for the
establishment, when circunistances permit, of a permanent archival system 
23
for the Commonwealth. Pending the establishment of such system, it will
advise the Government on general questions of collection and preservation.
of records, for the collection or preservation of which adequate steps are
not being taken by a Commonwealth authority, and will formulate proposals
for the preservation of records and documents or Commonwealth
departments, and lay down broad principles to be observed by Commonwealth
departments and provisional archival authorities. The members of
the committee will be---
Dr. Bean ( chairman), Messrs. H. S. Temby ( Prime Minister's Department).
P. Hasluck ( Department of External Affairs), J. G. B. Castieau ( Attorney-General's
Department), K. Binns ( Commonwealth Librarian), LL-Colonel J. L. Treloar ( Director.
Australian War Memorial), Mr. A. W. Bazley ( Assistant Director, Historical Records,
Australian War Memorial), and a representative of the Department of the Interior.
TEXTILE TRADE.
WOOLLEN TEXTILES--EXPORTS.
On 26th June, 19416, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Fraser) said
that export of woollen cloths related to all woollen and worsteds and
included shipments to Unrra as well as commercial exports. Of the
3,000,000 square yards exported during the current trade year, about
2,000,000 square yards of woollen piece goods went to Unrra, and a large
quantity of it was stock the trade was glad to dispose of as it was unsaleable
in Australia. The remaining 1,000,000 square yards of commercial exports
of woollen and worsted piece goods represented only 4 per cent. of the
total production of woollens and worsteds and included all types of woollen
cloth. Suitings exported represented only a small proportion as the
Governmeut -had established strict quotas for worsted exports. Apart
from a small quota to New Zealand, the only exports of worsteds were on
a token basis to maintain overseas markets.
BUDGET, 1945-46.
APPROPRIATION BILL-EXCESS REVENUE.
In Parliament.-On 26th June, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley)
introduced the Appropriation Bill. Mr. Chifley said-
The purpose of this bill is to obtain parliamentary appropriation for
the expenditure of an additional Å“ 20,000,000 of revenue for war purposes.
When the budget was presented in September, 1945, I estimated that total
revenue would be Å“ 374,000,000. The. budget was framed to provide an
appropriation from revenue for non-war items aggregating Å“ 166,000,000.
The balance of Å“ 208,000,000 was appropriated for war purposes.
It is now anticipated that some revenue items will exceed the estimate.
With the end of the war and the relaxation of controls, there has been a
marked buoyancy in customs and excise revenue, and indications are that
the estimate will he exceeded by Å“ 7,000,000. Increased sales of civilian
goods, mainly due to demobilization of the forces, may result in an increase
of sales tax revenue of Å“ 5,000,000. Income tax may yield an increased
amount of Å“ 5,000,000. Estate duty and s: ome other items of revenue will
show small increases. 
It is anticipated that non-war expenditure will be approximately the
same as the budget estimate. An accurate forecast of the total revenue
for 1945-16 is difficult, but the improvement will be from Å“ 15,000,000 to
Å“ 20,000,000. To permit this increase of revenue to be utilized to meet
war expenditure, it is necessary to provide an additional appropriation
of Å“ 20,000,000. The budget provided for total war expenditure of
Å“ 360,000,000. Owing mainly to the acceleration of demcbilization, this
estimate will be exceeded. The appropriation of Å“ 20,000,000 will enable
the actual improvement of revenue to be applied to war expenditure, thus
reducing the amount chargeable to loan." [ The bill was passed.]
IMPORTS.
CIGARETTE PAPERS.
On 26th June, 1946, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Fraser) announced
that, in view of the shortage of cigarette papers in Australia, licences would
be issued for the importation of reasonable quantities of cigarette papers.
BANKING CONTROL.
LEGISLATION-COMMONWEALTH BANK ACT, INDUSTRIAL
DEPARTMENT.
In Parliament.-On 26th June, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley)
said that to 20th March, 1946, applications to the Industrial Loan Department
of the Commonwealth Bank totalled 964. of which 782 had been dealt
with. Applications totalling 501 and involving Å“ 78, T738 had been granted.

GOVERNMENT'S PLAN-NATIONAL WORKS COUNCIL, LOCAL
GOVERNMENT AREAS.
On 1st July, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
SThe question has beeni asked whether the Commnonwealth Government
would give financial assistance to local authorities to implement their plans
for local works, improvemlents and facilities, or arrange For the granting
of interest free loans to such bodies. 
26
It must be remembered that these local authorities are self-governing
bodies, responsible to the electors, and that powers exist under State law
for them to raise loans, as well as obtain revenue by the levying of rates.
As to concessional interest rates, I think it would be difficult to justify the
selection of one class of borrowing for favoured treatment in this respect.
Moreover, a concession to one class of borrowers presents the problem of
adjusting upwards the rates to other borrowers if a net loss in interest
receipts from all advances--involving an additional charge on the Budget--
is to be avoided.
The Commonwealth Government is aware of the problems associated
with the financing of public work programmes and has actively pursued a
policy which will provide the most favorable terms over the widest field
of prospective borrowers. I refer particularly to the fact that borrowings
by governments, and semi-and local government authorities, may now be
negotiated on more favorable terms than ever before and this is directly
. ttributable to the policy of low interest rates by the Commonwealth.
It is essential to the continued success of financial policy, that all
. pproaches to the market for loan funds should be properly co-ordinated.
This is particularly important during the next few years, when it will be
necessary to introduce the public works requirements of Commonwealth,
State and local government bodies in an ordered way so as to avoid undue
, competition for available building and works facilities. Similarly, it is
-sscntial that financial needs be co-ordinated and related to available money.
The fact that the Commonwealth, foreseeing these potential needs,
: onvened the National Works Council, and was instrumental in having a
long-term public works programme planned by the States, must not be
interpreted as an indication that the Commonwealth Government desires to
usurp the sovereign responsibilities of the States in the field of local government,
nor that it is prepared to support a financial arrangement which
would give strong preference to local government bodies in respect of public
works finance which could not be extended to other Commonwealth and
State financial requirements for public works and buildings programmes.
At its first meeting in January, 1944, the National Works Council
agreed to. the preparation of a programme of public works in three classifications
of urgency and amounting in all to roughly Å“ 200,000,000 as a reservoir
of worhs to facilitate the stabilization of the early post-war economic
condition. It was resolved that the programme for each State should be
endorsed by that State Government and that the administering authority
of the programme should indicate its agreement to accept the financial
responsibility entailed. Among the items included in the States' programmes
would be works planned by local government authorities and
authorized by the State Government concerned as sufficiently urgent to be
included in its programme. At the second meeting of the National Works
Council in August, 1944, progress was reviewed and it was again emphasized
that the responsibility for the financing of the works programmes planned
rested on the States. Local government authorities should, therefore,
submit their loan proposals to their State Governments."

UNITED NATIONS FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATIONAUSTRALIAN
BODY.
On 2nd July, 1946, Mr. Chifley said---
The Fcod and Agriculture Organization is now becoming effectively
established as an integral part of the new international machinery of the
United Nations. The first conference, to which Australia sent a delegation,
was held in 1945. Following the conference, steps have been taken to build
up a permanent secretariat to carry out its functions.
In 1944, Full Cabinet approved of an inter-departmental committee
being established, comprising representatives of the Departments of the
Treasury, External Affairs, Post-war Reconstruction, Commerce and Agriculture,
and Health, to consider matters associated with the subject as
they arose and to report to the Minister for External Affairs. A request
has now been received from the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture
Organization that an Australian committee be set up to provide a
liaison between the appropria: e agencies in Australia and the secretariat
of the organization.
" Cabinet decided to-day that the Inter-departmental Committee be
S replaced by an Australian Food and Agriculture Organization Committee
to be set up in conformity with the request of the Director-General of F. A. O.,
comprising representatives of the Departments of the Treasury, External
S Affairs, Commerce and Agriculture, Information, Interior, Health, and of
the Bureau of Agricultural Economics ( now with the Department of Post-
S war Reconstruction), the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research,
the Commonwealth Statistician, and the Forestry and Timber Bureau.
The Australian F. A. O. Committee has the following duties and responsibilities
To advise the Government on policy questions in regard to F. A. O.
To collect information and statistics required by the F. A. O. secretariat from
Australia and to approve such matter before despatch.
To disseminate information provided by F. A. O.
To bring to the notice of appropriate authorities any action required on their part
S to carry out the purposes of F. A. O.
To prepare the draft brief for Australian representatives attending conferences and
other meetings of the F. A. O.
To furnish a quarterly progress report to Cabinet and to report at other times as
circumstances require.
To arrange suitable publicity for F. A. O. activities through the Department of
Information.
S To co-operate with State authorities through the Department of Commerce and
Agriculture and the Australian Agricultural Council.
WORLD ORGANIZATION--ATOMIC ENERGY.
In Parliament.-On 3rd July, 1946, Mr. Chifley said--
On the general subject of the control of atomic energy and the materials
used in the manufacture of atomic bombs, a conference has been sitting for
some time. The Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt) is representing
Australia. I cannot say what final decisions are likely to be reached, but
the general view has been expressed by this Government, and has been
submitted to the conference, that the control of atomic energy should be
placed under the United Nations. Having regard to the dreadful possibilities
of the use of uranium and other ingredients in the production of 
atomic bombs, and to the future peace of the world, our belief is that this
new discovery should be developed to produce industrial power and not
hombs for war purposes. Dr. Evatt is making this clear at the conference."
SECONDARY INDUSTRIES COMMISSION-PLYWOOD INDUSTRY
PANEL.
On 3rd July, 1946, Mr. Dedman announced the formation of a Plywood
Industry Advisory Panel to function within the Secondary Industries
Division of his department comprising-
Mr. I. H. Boas, chairman, the secretary of the Department of Forests, Papua-New
Guinea ( Mr. J. B. McAdam), Messrs. J. F. Brett and C. R. Paterson ( Australian Plywood
Board), Mr. C. Mitchell ( Associated Country Saw Millers of New South Wales), the
secretary of the Furnishing Trad-es Union ( Mr. O. Schreiber), the secretary of the
Timber Workers' Union ( Mr. J. A. Weir), and Mr. A. H. Crane ( Forestry Division,
Queensland Department of Lands).
The panel would report on--
The pro-war and post-war requirements of plywood by types to determine the degree
of permanency of any increased demand.
The present day relation between established demand and. available supplies
expressed in terms of local production capacity, plus importation potential.
The location and availability of logs with particular reference to unexploited home
: and adjacent island stands of timber.
Action to secure an adequate supply of logs for the plywood industry to meet
current and expected demands.
WHEAT POOLS PAYMENTS.
No. 8 WHEAT POOL-THIRD ADVANCE.
On 26th June, 1946, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Scully) announced
; a third advance in No. 8 pool of 9d. a bushel bulk quota wheat and Is. lid.
a bushel for non-quota wheat, less freight in each case. An extra Id. would
be paid on bagged wheat. The advance brought payments of the pool to
4s. llAd. a bushel, less freight bagged basis.
TARIFF.
EXPORTS PROHIBITED.
On 27th Jtune, 1946, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Fraser) announced
that exportation of pig lead, scrap lead and manufactures of lead had been
prohibited. On 3rd July, 1946, Senator Fraser announced that exportation of
tobacco, cigars and cigarettes had been prohibited.

PETROL SUPPLIES.
RATIONING SYSTEM-. ADJUSTMENT.
On 27th June, 1946, the Minister for Supply ( Senator Ashley) announced
that the adjustment promised in respect of petrol consumers in classes
3 to 7, whose licences covered both private and business running, would be
effected by making available an additional four gallons of motor spirit
monthly as from the August issue uniformly to each consumer in those
groups, thus making the actual ration available the gillonage shown on the.
face of ench consumer's licence, plus four.

AUSTRALIAN WAR EFFORT AND CAPACITY.
CONTROL OF TINPLATE--RE-INSTITUTED.
On 27th June, 1946, the Minister for Supply ( Senator Ashley) announced
that as from 1st July, 1946, control of the end use of tinplate, which had
been relaxed in October, 1945, would be re-instituted. Action had been
necessary because of serious cut-hacks in allocation:; of tinplate from the
United States and because substantial supplies of tinplate were not yet
coming forward from Britain. The Government was taking steps to meet
the position and had despatched a mission to Britain and the United States

COMPARISONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.
On 28th June, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chilley) said that staterients
comparing the level of taxation in Australia with that of other
countries were misleading, unless qualified by a proper understanding of
the relative values of the several currencies and other relevant factors,
including the level of indirect taxation, such as customs and excise duties,
the level of social services expenditure, the standard of living in each
: ountry and whether the exchange rates were free or pegged. I 
Tables of tax payable in sterling countries as compared with tax payable
in non-sterling countries should be treated with great caution before
drawing any conclusions from them. In the following table, setting out the
tax payable on selected incomes in Australia, New Zealand and Britain,
in each case the tax payable had been expressed in the currency of the
country concerned. The amounts shown in the statement included the

; Is is equivalent to Is. a full licence fee and 6d. a half licence fee for a period
of twelve months on the basis of licences in force on 30th June, 1945. This
was a further continuation of an arrangement approved in May, 1944.
Cabinet to-day decided to continue still further this special payment
tor a further v.: ar, pending a report on the subject by the Parliamentary
Standing Committee on Broadcasting."
SOCIAL SECURITY.
TUBERCULOSIS PATIENTS-COMMONWEALTH GRANT.
On 2nd July, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
The Tuberculosis Act, passed by Parliament in October, 1945, came
into operation on 1st January, 1946, and provided for Commonwealth
grants for diagnostic facilities, after-care facilities, payment for patients in
State hospitals and special allowances to a sufferer or his or her dependants.
In regard to special allowances, the then Minister for Health ( Senator Fraser)
and I were directed by Cabinet to discuss with the State Ministers for Health
the question of the States distributing, on behalf of the Commonwealth,
the grant to be used as a special tubercul,) sis allowance.
To provide for policy and administrative questions arising from the
Act, Cabilnet to-dav decided that the Act be amended to provide that an
amount of Å“ 250,000 a year may be payable to States, the allocation to each
State to be determined by the Minister, on condition that the States distribute
the grant to or in respect of sufferers from tuberculosis or their
dependants in necessitous circumstances to achieve the object of encouraging
sufferers to cease work and take treatment; to assist in preventing the
spread of the disese and to promote the better treatment of the disease;
and that payments received by individuals in accordance with the proposed
new section shall not be regarded as income for the purposes of the Invalid
and Old-age Pensions Act and of the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits
Act. This will ensure that the tuberculosis special allowances are-excluded
from the means tests imposed in these two Acts, thus making the allowances
additional to any benefit the sufferer may be eligible to receive direct
from the Commonweilth by waY of sickness benefit or invalid pension."'
AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING ACT.
VENEREAL DISEASE, SEX TALKS.
On 3rd July, 1946, the Postmaster-General ( Senator Cameron) announced

PRICES.
U. S. REVOCATION-EFFECT ON AUSTRALIA.
On 3rd July, 1946, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Fraser) said that
the effect on Australian prices of the abandonment of price control in the
United States would depend on the. extent and direction of the inflationary
forces in America. It was not known whether American exports would be
affected or whether any increase in price would be significant. In any
case, it would be some months before goods purchased at currnat or future
prices would be landing in Australia and there was no present indication
that the local retail price level would be affected. It was difficult to make
any forecasts but Australia would watch developments in the United States
with great interest both from the point of view of the lesson to be learned
from the experiment, and the effects on the Australian economy.
SERVICE PAY RATES.
DEFERRED PAY-GOVERNMENT LIABILITY.
In Parliament.-On 3rd July, 1946, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley)
said-Total expenditure on deferred pay for the financial year 1944-45 was
Å“ 9,674,273. To 30th May, 1946, expenditure was Å“ 67,711,892."
MEAT AGREEMENT.
EXPORTS-CONTROL, BILL INTRODUCED.
In Parliament.-On 3rd July, 1946, the Minister for Commerce ( Mr.
Scully) introduced the Meat Export Control Bill. Mr. Scully said-
The purpose of this bill, to amend the Meat Export Control Act, is to
provide for the reconstitution of the Australian Meat Board, and to grant
to the board additional powers necessary to enable it to carry out work in
relation to the long-term purchase agreement covering ncat for export,
entered into between the Commonw,. ealth Go-vernment and the British
Government. The Australian Meat Board will consist of twelve members, including
a Commonwealth Government representative, who will be appointed by the
Governor-General. He will be employed full-time on the business of the
board and will be chairman. Of the remaining eleven members, seven
members, constituting a clear majority of the board, will be representative
of producer interests. Producer members, comprising four representatives
of the lamb and mutton producers, two of the beef producers, and one of'
the pig producers, must be bona fide producers, and must be persons
nominated by producer organizations constituted on a Commonwealth
basis. Members appointed to represent the meat exporting companies arc
to be appointed after consultation with representative organizations of
meat exporters. The member appointed to represent the employees will
be appointed after co:, ulltation with the Federal Council of the Meat
Industry Employees Union. The member appointed to represent the
publicly-owned abattoirs and freezing works will be appointed by th'e
Governor-General. 
J'I
The bill gives the person presiding at a meeting tile right to dissent
from any decision of the board. This right is necessary because of the
Conmmn: nwealth Government's financial interest in the operations of thet
board. It is essential that the chairman shall have the right to bring to
thef Minister's notice immediately any resolutior which lie considers may
involve the Commonwealth Government in any way on a point of principle
or, on question of financial losses or gains.
So that all sections of the industry may be in a position to present
their views on matters affecting the ilndustry, provision has been made for
th' settini. g-up of State conmmittees. It will be competent for any duly
constituted State organization representing a section of the meat industry
to: ; ppl\ fcr representation on the State committee.
SAs the ainiistration of the long-term purchase agreement for meat
between the Commonwealth Government and the British Government will
li, a function of the board after the expiration of the ANatioil Security Act,
provision has been malde for the powers of the board to be extended to
includ the following
To purchase on behalf of the Conimonwealth Government any meat, meat product,
or edible offal.
To sell on behalf of the Commonwealth Government any meat, meat product, or
edible offal.
To manage and control as necessary, the handling, storage aifd shipment of any
meat, meat product, or edible offal.
Subject to the approval of the Commonwealth Government, to obtain advances
from the Commonwealth Bank under Commonwealth Government guarantee, for use
in the purchase of meat for export and the payment of expenses incurred in connexion
therewith. Attention is directed to the provision, of. special interest to producers,
that. the colnitions attaching to the issue by the board of an export licence
liav bieen extended to n ake it obligatory on the licensee, where the prodlucer-
wnier of such stock so requests, to treat stock on account of the
o) wn'r n weigh t and grade basis." [ The bill ats ipssed.]
In Parliament.--On 3rd July, 1946, Mr. Scully introduced the Meat
Industry Control Bill. Mr. Scully said
The purpose of this bill. which is supplementary to the Meat Export
Control Bill, is to transfer to the Australian Meat Board the powers arnd
functions at present exercised by the Controller of Meat Supplies and the
Meat Canning Committee under National Security Act regulations. It will
b) e appreciated that the transfer is to be temporary, and that, with the
expiration of the National Security Act, this act will cease to have the force
of law. Notwithstanding that, the interests of the Commonwealth Government
and of the meat industry, insofar as they relate to actions taken 1v
the Controller of Meat Supplies and the Meat Canning Committee ander
Nationa. l Secu-i ity Act regulations, must be protected. The bill provides
that these rights and obligatilns shall be assumed by the Australian Meat
Board. Since the rationing of meat and the control of meat prices n. re
nmatters which, for the time being ; t least, are closely linked with the
4420.--2 * i 
general control of the meat industry, provision has been made for the temporary
appointment to the Australian Meat Board of additional memhers,
one to represent the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner, and one the
Director of Rationing. These members will automatically cease to hold
office upon the expiration of the National Scc rity Act."
[ The bill was passed.]

NATIONALITY.
NATURALIZATION-NEW GUINEA.
In Parliamnent.-On 4th July, 1946, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr.
Calwell) introduced the Nationality Bill. Mr. Calwell said-
Under existing nationality law, an essential requirement for the grant
of a certificate of naturalization is that an applicant shall have resided for
a prescribed period within the British dominions. The Territory of New
Guinea does not form a part of the Briti., h dominions for the purposes of
nationality law, and residence in the territory cannot be counted as
residence for the grant of naturalization. This means that the only way
open at present to a person living in the territory to acquire British nationality,
which will be recognized in Australia, or other parts of the Empire,
is to abandon his domicile there and take up residence in Australia or some
other part of the British Commonwealth. The purpose of this bill is to
enable a resident of the territory to qualify for naturalization as a British
subject while maintaining his residence in the territory.
Commonwealth Crown Law authorities have expressed the opinion
that it is nQt possible to grant to residents of New Guinea naturalization
which would be effective throughout the British dominions. The Government
has decided that the next best should be given to residents of the
territory; that is, that they shall be accorded the privilege of qualifying
for the grant of British nationality which will have effect in the Commonwealth
and its territories. The hill makes that provision.
It is not the Government's intention that this shall be the final word
on the subject. It is proposed to hold a conference of representatives of
Britain and the Dominions in the near future to discuss certain nationality
questions. It is intended to raise at that conference the matter of making
provision that residence in New Guinea shall he regarded as a qualification
for the grant of a certificate of naturalization which will be effective, not
only in Australia and its territories, hut also throughout the whole of the
British Commonwealth.' [ Th7e bill wlr pased.]
JUDICIARY.
ARBITRATION C. OURT-PENSION RIGHTS.
In Ptli,, went.-On 4th July, 194i, the Minister for Labour ( Mr.
Hollow iv) introduced the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration
Bill. Mr. Holloway said
The object of this hill is to provide that, where a judge of the Common-l
weallth Arbitration Court has, before his appointment, served in any judicil
dflir, und.' r a State, his service umnder the State. up to a period of ten yeo,' rs, 
shall be deemed to be part of his service as a judge of the Commonwealth
Arbitration Court for the purpose of calculating his pension rights. Under
the act in its present form, account may be taken of prior service in a
judicial office under the Commonwealth for the purposes of pension rights,
hlt no such provision is made in respect of prior service in a judicial office
under a State.
In other legislation, for example, the BaInkraptry Act, a limited period
of prior service in a judicial office under a State may be taken into account
for the purposes of pension. The idea is to establish a permanent basis
for settling matters of this kind. Recently, several new judges have been
appointed, and most ce them have served in a judicial capacity in a State."
[ The bill was passed.]
PATENTS.
BILL INTRODUCED.
In Pirliamein't.-On 4th July, 1946. the Acting Attorney-General ( Mr.
IIllowa.) introduced the Patents Bill. MJr. Holloway said-
The principal object of the bill is to remove certain disadvantages
which have occurred by. reason of the deltayv at present existing in the
examination work of the Patent Office. That delay has ibeen brought about
in plart , y the fact that a large nmber of exaniiners of patent. s--representing
over 60 per cent. of the stal'f-were released during the war fromn
the Patent Office for service in the forces and in other departments. The
de! ay has also been partly brought about by reason of an abnormal and
entirely unpredictable increase of the number of applications for patents.
This increase appears to be largely due to the great industrial development
which has taken place in Australia in recent years. Many overseas manufacturers
discovered during the war that the Australian market was worth-
\ vhile. and that they cannot obtain royalties for the use of their inventions
in Australia unless they patent them here. Tn 1939, the nunmb" r of applications
for patents was 5,700; last year it was 7,300; and it is expected
that. this year the iiumbier will exceed 10,000.
Every effort is being made to obtain the services of additional
examinrs of patents. It takes at least three years to train an examiner
full-in his work, and some considerable time will elapse before any substantial
reduction is made of the arrears of examination work in the Patent
Office. Anv serious delay in the examination of patent applications has a
dlerimental effect on inventors, and -m industrial development.
This bill proposes to amend, the law so as to provide for the publication
complete specifications forthwith after lodgment at the Patent Office
anld for a patentee whose invention has been used after publication to be
entitled to damages for infringement committed from the date of publication
forthwith after the lodgment instead of from the date of publication consequent
upon acceptance. Damages are recoverable only if a patent is
ultimnately sealed on the application and only in respect of valid claims.
As a corollary to the provisions referred to, the bill gives protection to
persons who may be threatened with infringement actions by applicants
4420.--
on the basis of questionable or iivali I claims, and prohibits the miking of
falso representations that articles are patented or the subject of ienlinr
applications. SThe bill proposes to imake periai. neit a; practice aidopte! durig the
war under ntional Security Act Regulations of not examiniung a pr, ov isiotial
specification until the complete specificetionll has len lodged. lI -aaiy
cases, applications are acconipanied I* v provisional specifications onvl and
lapse hb reason of the ailure oif the ipplicant to lodge a collnplt ; Is-cification.
The ti: e spent in exannliin provisional specifications 1whih0 via; v
lapse will he sa\ l ed Ylir eason of this allnendlinenit." [ The bill iwmci I"' ssd

PROPOSED VISIT BY MR. ATTLEE--POSTPONED.
On 6th Jub-. 1946 the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said--
SThe B3ritishl Prime Minister and Mrs. Attlee have been looking for1ward
to visiting Australia and New Zealand at the invitation of their governments.
It was announced in April, 1946, that Mr. Attlee planued to leave Britain
in the last week of July, 1946, ibut that his plans were liable to revijion if
there should bie any public matters, requiring his personal attention, which
necessitated his presence in Britain in the period concerned. He has now
regretfully reached the conclusion that the decision recently announced to 
summnioii the Peace Coaference at Paris onil 29th July, 1946, added to the
other pressing problems which confront the British Government at present,
render it impossible for hin to be absent froulnt Britain dluring the period
proposed for thile visit to Australia. and New Zealand. He has, accordingly,
informed mec that lie keenly regrets that. lie is obliged to cancel the arrangenernts
! L postponie the visit.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Attlee are acutely lisappointed at the loss of this
opportunity to see Australia and New Zealand, to meet their governments
and people and to express, on behalf of the people of Britain, the appreciation
of Britain of the minagnificent contribution made hY both the fighting
iten andl women and the civilians of each of the two Dominions ill the war.
They greatly hope that they imar have an ollpportunitY to visit Allstralia

On 9th July, 1946. the Prime Miniiter ( Mr. Chifley) said-
SFollowing dibcussionts between the lMinister for External Affairs ( Dr.
Evatt), the President of the United States ( Mr. Truman) andrl the Acting
Secretary of State ( Mr. Dean Acheson), formal arrangements have now
been completed betten the Australian and LniIod States Governments
for the raising of the rank of their legations at Canluberra and Washington
to embassies. and of the office of Minister to that of Ambas ador. This
step is the natural consequence of the iicrea. ingly closer and cordial relations
betweenll Australia and the Unitel States and reflects the added importance
of the Pacific area in the eves of both goverimients. The move also serves
as a recoanition of th. e major contribution made by Australia to victory
in World War II., and of the important part which she continues to play
in regari to the pireservation of security inii the Pacific.
President Truman proposes to submit to the Senate the noillinatio
of Mr. Robert Butler of St. Paul, Minnesota, as first United States
Ambassador to Australia. Mr. Butler served in World War I. and is
to-day one of America's leading constructional engineers. He is also
actively connected with the governing bodies of various educational

representative of the Ministry of Post-war Reconstruction, the Repatriation
Commission, the Department of Social Services, the Treasury and . the
Department of Labour to carry out detailed planning. The Australian
Red Cross Society had been invited to take part ith a view to it assuming
a full and official part in the development of the planning. Establishment
of a psychiatric out-patients' service in each State was an essential of the
plan, together with further development by the Department of Social

ASSESSMENT BILL, 1947-INSTALMENT SCALES.
On 13th June, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
" Regulations under the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Social
Services Contribution Assessment Act have been gazetted to-day.
These regulations prescribe reduced scales of instalment deductions
to be made by employers from the weekly salary or wages paid to
employees on and after the 1st July, 1947. The reduced scales give
effect to the reductions in income tax and social services contribution
rcnntly paced by Parliament. 
As in the past, one scale has been printed by the Taxation Dleparl.-
ment to cover instalments for both income tax and social services contributions.
Copies of this scale will be available to employers before
1st July, 1947.
Some variation has been made in the form of the printed scale to
be used. In cases of employees with dependants, the scale at present in
operation provides for instalments according to the number and class
of. dependants maintained. In the new scale, the instalments for such
empl. yees are varied according to the total amount on which rebate may
be claimed by the employee in respect of dependants. This alteration
will simplify the application of the scale by employers. A copy of the
scale is attached.
The regulations contain provisions which will enable farmers,
businessmen and other taxpayers from whose income instalment deductions
are not made, to obtain the benefit of the reduced incomne tax and
, ocial services contribution rates in the provisional amounts payable by
them in respect of the income of the year ending 30th June, 1948.
" Normally, the provisional tax and contribution payable by such a
taxpayer would be equal to the income tax and social services contribution,
respectively, assessed for the financial year 1946-47. However, in
view of the fact that the rates of income tax and social services contribution
for the financial year 1947-48 will be lower than those for the
financial year 1946-47, the regulations provide for a reduction in the
provisional tax and contribution otherwise payable for the financial
year 1947-48. Broadly, in cases where the taxpayer will be liable to
both income tax and social services contribution, the reduction will le Is.
in the Å“ 1 for each Å“ 1 of the taxable income derived by him during the
year ending 30th June, 1947. In other cases, the reduction will be
graduated up to a maximum of Is. in the Å“ 1 for each Å“ 1 of the taxable
inconie derived by the taxpayer during the year ending 30th June, 1947.
The regulations also prescribe the metals to which section 23 ( p)
the Act shall apply. Section 23 exempts income derived by a
bona fide prospector from the sale, transfer or assignment by him of his
rights to mine for gold and for such metals and minerals as arc prescribed.
The metals prescribed for the purpose of this provision are
antimony, arsenic, beryllium, bismuth, cobalt, copper, mercury, molybdenuin,
nickel, tin and vanadium."

FISHING INDUSTRY.
WHALING-AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY.
On 9th June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" On 20th November, 1945, Cabinet approved of proposals for Australian
participation for whaling in the Southern Hemisphere. Since
then an officer of the Fisheries Division of the Department of
Post-war Reconstruction has attended an International Whaling 
Conference. An inter-departmental conunittee, representing the
Departments of the Treasury, Labour, Commerce, Supply and
Shipping, Post-war Reconstruction and Repatriation has considered
the general prospects of the industry. and particularly
in the light of information received from Britain that the delivery
of a factory ship would not ' be made until 1950 at the earliest.
It was considered that Australia's initial entry into the industry
should be through land stations and that, when they had been
established and personnel trained, consideration could be given to
pelagic operations.
The Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard) informed Cabinet to-
( lay that the present position was that the building of a factory ship
could not he completed until 1950 and that the proposal to secure a
factory ship as part of Japanese reparations was being investigated by
the Department of External Affairs but, even if aproved, there would
he delay in delivery. It appeared that the Australian industry should
be developed on shore-based operations from the New South Wales and
Western Australian coasti and by pelagic operations based on Hobartthe
latter being subject to personnel being trained at the land stations
and prospects carefully checked.
Cabinet decided to conmmence negotiations for the cingagcllent of
a whaling expert."

CZECHOSLOVAKIA. CREDIT.
On llth June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" A credit of Å“ stg. 500,000 has been granted to the Government of
Czechoslovakia through the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for the
purchase of Australian wool. The period of the credit is one year.
Repayment has been guaranteed by the Government of Czechoslovakia.
. It is ! a condition of the agreement that Czechoslovakia will make cash
purchases of Australian wool to a value at least equal to the amount of
the guaranteed credit.
" Before the war, Czechoslovakia was becoming an increasingly
important buyer of Australian wool. It is considered that the credit
will assist in the early re-establishment of the woollen industry in
that country." DEFENCE.
POST-WAR-UNITED STATES CO-OPERATION.
On 11th June, 1947, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt)
and the United States Ambassador ( Mr. Butler) said-
The Commander-in-Chief of the United States Navy, Army and
Air Forces in the Pacific area ( Admiral L. E. Denfeld) has had discussions
with the Australian Government and service authorities on 
7
matters of mutual interest in the Pacific. The purpose of his visit was
to ensure the continuance of the close co-operation between the United
States and Australian services which existed through the war period
and which contributed so much to victory in the Pacific.
There is a practical identity of Pacific interests and excellent relationships
existing between the United States and Australia. The discussions
Admiral Denfeld has had with the Prime Minister ( Mr.
Chifley), the MAinister for External Affairs, the Minister for the Navy
( Mr. Riordan), and service authorities have covered mutual interests
of the two countries in the Pacific, and it is natural that such discussions
should be repeated from time to time. They are the natural
outcome of the close association between the two Governments which
characterized the war period and, being purely defensive in character,
are completely in accord with the principles and purposes of the
United Nations. The discussions during the last few days in Australia
have been entirely successful from ail points of view."
DEFENCE SOCIENTIFIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE.
On 31st July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-

PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.
EXPORTS TO BRITAIN-BRITISH POLICY.
On 12th . June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
The policy of the British Government on foodstuffs so far . as Austr:
lia is concerned is to import the maximum quantities of basic foodtruffs.
such as dairy products and meat, from us. Britain wants many
othpr product. in addition to these basic lines including-
IT! onlto pur chutney. apple butter, vilegar, bonox, vegemite, fruit juices,
e mined meat and vegetables, canned steak and vegetables, canned rabbit, canned
poultry, fricassee of poultry, fri,;-' nec of rabbit, fricassee of mutton, steak and
kidney pudding. and irish stexx.
: Britain do( s nor want certain foodstuffs in a processed form
Ilc-ausicf sli prefers tine raw iaterials. She does not want plum pudlings,
for instacce, from Australia, if she can obtain the flour, dried
fruits and fats in bulk and use these items to the best advantage.
Australia has been cognizant of the British Government's decision
lto irstrict rlth import of certain processed and semi-luxury foodstuffs.
It li; s beli tl.. policy of the British Ministry of Food to import food
stiifs in pIarticnlar formns so that the Ministry may implement its rationig
seljiinm. Kiinoing the position of Britain, the Australian Governmient
hi,-nei'. and will continue to do, everything possible to shift
the maxirinunl foodstuffs to Britain. The British import policy on food
is the concern of tihe British Government.
Australin has serious problems for tinned plate supplies and does
not always desire to send goods in cans which can be exported in bulk.
Australian exports to Britain of goods which are subject to import
restrictionLs are not appreciable and make very little impression on the
iquantity of foodstuffs required by the British Ministry."
DAIRY INDUSTRY-CONTROL.
On 2nd July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
The Australian Dairy Produce Board was set up in October, 1924,
, nil consists of seventeen members appointed under the Dairy Produce
Export Control Act. The members comprise-
Four producers. iine representatives of butter and cheese factories, two
representatives of prdprietary and privately-owned butter and cheese factories,
inc representative of the Australian Council of the Australian Institute of Dairy
Factory Managers and Secretaries, and one representative of the Commonwealth
Government. During the war, the board's activities were curtailed and under
National Security Act regulations, control of . the industry was taken
over in November, 1939, by a small committee vested with wide powers.
Cabinet decided to-day that legislation be prepared to amend the
Dairy Produce Control Act to provide for a board of twelve members,
with a ' Government nominee as chairman; to be vested with such additional
powers and functions as might be necessary in the light of circumstances
now obtaining in the industry. It is proposed that, when
the new legislation operates, National Security Act regulations will be
withdrawn." 
DAIRY INDUSTRY-MILK, SUBSIDIES.
On 18th July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
" A decision as to the future control of milk will be made by the
Commonwealth Government in September, 1947. The decision to be
made is whether the Commonwealth should take any further interest
and step out, or whether control should be handed to a State or local
authority. If subsidies are discontinued by the Commonwealth, that
will mean substantial increases in milk prices to consumers. One of the
Commonwealth's difficulties is that at places such as Hobart and Launceston
there is no authority to which the Commonwealth can hand
control." AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY-EXPORT CONTROLLED.
On 3rd July, 1947, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)
announced that controls would be exercised over the export of essential
agricultural machinery to ensure that the greatest possible volume
would be available in Australia. Types involved were--
Tractors, grain and fertilizer cu! tivator drills, and seed drills for cereal crops,
header harvesters. rezaper threshers, reapers and hinders, hay balers, side delivery
rakes, mowers and spare parts.
Token overseas shipments would be permitted as the nucleus of trade
must be preserved.
AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL MEETING-DECISIONS.
On S1st Jily, 1947, Mr. Pollard said that a meeting of Anstralian
Agricultural Council had been held. Decisions were-
3IARKETING O I-I; GS.-At its last meeting. cotincil adopted recotniimei( ldtioiis
embracing the formation of the Australian Egg E. qualization Conmmittee Limited
for the marketing of eggs. The Standing Conmnittee on Agriculture now
reported that unless the neces-iry legislation could be passed in New South
Wales and Victoria to enable the company to operate as from It January,
1S! 48, there would he disorganization in marketing and a fall in prices. Dealing
with the question of surplus funds from Commonwealth egg control, Council
expressed the view that the Commonwealth Government should be informed that
some portion of the fund should be distributed as working capital of tile Australian
Egg Equalization Committee Limited.
BABLEY.--Proposals for the future marketing of barley, previously agreed to
by representatives of Victorian and South Australian Governments and growers,
and trading interests in those States, were adopted by council. The proposals
provide for marketing barley under a pool system operating under State legislation
without any guaraniitee of price: growers in effect receiving the average
return obtained by the pool. Council decided that draft legislation prepared by
the South Australian Government be considered by a conference of Commonwealth.
Victorian and South Australian legal officers and that the draft bill
then be submitted to the Commonwealth Government for approval and preparation
as a Commonwealth Bill. The measure is to cover marketing of barley in
Victoria and South Australia and any other States prepared to participate.
ToBAcco.-Council adopted a tentative outline of Commonwealth and State
legislation embodying principles considered necessary for a tobacco marketing
scheme. The proposals envisaged a central authority charged with appraising
tobacco leaf submitted to it under complementary State legislation. It would be
necessary for the States to invest the central authority with necessary powers to 
11
appraise Australian tobacco leaf and allocate leaf to manufacturers. The legislation
would provide for a table of limits which would be used to appraise leaf
and should prohibit transactions except in accordance with the requirements of
State Acts.
POTArOEs.-Council noted that the Commonwealth had decided to continue
the contract system with potatoes to cover the 1947-48 crop. The area desired
was 185,000 acres calculated to give production sufficient to supply the population
of Australia with 2j lb. of potatoes a week throughout the year with a margin
of safety. It was proposed to allocate the area for 1947-48 as follows:-New
South Wales-31,533 acres; Victoria-66,347 acres; Queeneland-17,735 acres;
South Australia-7,880 acres; Western Australia-7,823 acres; Tasmania-
54,149 acres; Total-185,467 acres.
Basic price for best varieties of No. 1 grade was being raised from Å“ 12
to Å“ 13 10s. a ton to cover increased costs arising from the removal of the subsidy
on cornsacks and other increases. Council was informed that the existing
scheme would not be extended after the season ending 1948 and stressed the
necessity for all State legislation to be ready for operation before that date.
SOIL CONSERVATION.-Council decided that, recognizing the importance of rye
corn in soil conservation in Australia, immediate steps should be taken to build
up in the Commonwealth a comprehensive collection of the world's rye corn
varieties. Council recommended that a duly stubble mulch farm machine set be
imported and made available to the New South Wales Conservation Service for
testing as to efficiency.
FERTITIzaER.-Council adopted recommendations from the conference of Commonwealth
and State fertilizer officers as follows:-
Sulphate for 1947-48 would be allocated to each State in the same proportion
as in 1946-47.
Nitrate of soda for 1947-48 would be allotted as follows:-New South Wales-
1,100 tons; Victoria-1,100' tons; Queensland-2,000 tons: South Australia-
450 tons: Western Australia-1,000 tons; Tasmania-350 tons; Total--6,000
tons. Superphosphate supplies would be similar to the 1946-47 period-1,250,000
tons. Potash supplies would be ample through commercial channels. Accordingly
, upplies would not be allocated between the States for 1947-48.
INSECT PEST CONTROL.-Council agreed to recommendations by the Standing
Committee on Agriculture that a trial plan against plague locusts be undertaken
in New South Wales.
STocK DlsEASEs.-Recommentdations to council . by a conference of Commonwealth
and State veterinary officers on control of stock diseases were approved
as follows:-In view of the serious position developing in connexion. with ayian tuberculosis,
poultry slaughtering should be subject to inspection under
veterinary control in all States.
Tuberculosis-free herd schemes should be uniform. Schemes in operation
in New South Wales and Victoria, with agreed amendments to be accepted
as a guide.
Disease of Poultry.-Pullorum-free flock schemes were desirable in each
State and those in operation should be used as a basis by States preparing
echemes. An organized investigation into Birdsville and other related diseases of
horses be conducted by the Council for Scientific and Iudustrial Research in
conjunction with the Departments of Agriculture of Queensland, South
Australia and Western Australia and the Northern Territory Administration.
In the event of private institutions preparing living canine distemper
virus vaccine, it should be controlled by requiring it to be issued only to
veterinary surgeons.
As penicillin was widely required for the treatment of bovine mastitis
and other diseases, any restrictions on the issue of penicillin for veterinary
use should be abolished. 
VEGETABLE OIL PLA. NTS.-Council was informed by the Standing Committee onl
Agriculture that it had considered the report of the Commonwealth mission
which visited the United States in 1946 to inquire into the soybean industry:
The committee informed council that it had accepted recommendations as
fnllows:-Commonwealth and State Governments should take energetic action to
promote the economic production of vegetable oil plants in Australia.
The Commonwealth and States should set up a Vegetable Oils Committee
to recommend broad policy on vegetable oil production to the council. Funds
should be made available to undertake an intensive programme of plant
breeding and selection and testing of soybeans and the vegetable oil producing
plants appropriate to their environment.
The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research should undertake investigation
into the industrial uses of vegetable oils. To allow manufacturers to
exploit the possibilities of soybean oil, permits be issued for the importation
of soybeans. MIGRATION.
OVERSEAS OFFICES.
On 12th June, 1947, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Calwell)
announced that nine new Australian immigration offices would be
opened as soon as arrangements could be completed at Oslo, The Hague.
Paris, Berlin, San Francisco and New York, Shanghai, New Delhi and
Cairo. The offices would deal with all migration matters, including
official migration schemes, and the handling of landing permits, passports
and the like. Duties of the offices at San Francisco and New
York would include reception of applications and selection for the
Government's new assisted passage scheme for United States ex-service-
NATIONAL ECONOMIC PLAN.
SALES AND TRANSFERS OF LAND-ADMINISTRATION.
ROYAL COMMISSION.
On 13th June, 1947, the Attorney-Genera! ( Dr. Evatt) announced
that Judge Kirby, of the New South Wales District Court, had been
appointed a Royal Commissioner to inquire into and report on certain
matters arising out of the administration of land sales control. Terms
of reference were-
Whether there was misconduct or wrulg-doig on the part of any person in
or in coninexion with the handling of or dealing with any of the following transactions
by the Sydney Land Sales Control office of the Department of the
Treasury, or the Canberra Land Sales Control office of that department:-
The transactions submitted for the Treasurer's consent by or on behalf
of Stanley Evan Parry, Edward Richard Courtney McCormac, Sub
. division Estates and Land Pty. Ltd., Burke Naughton Pty. Ltd., and
Australian Securities Ltd.; and
The transactions specified by Frederick Alan Lush in his letter of 23rd
May, 1947, to the Prime Minister.
If you are of opinion that there was any such misconduct or wrong-doing
what person or persons were guilty of it and in what did it consist. 
FIXATION OF WAGES AND SALARIES-REGULATIONS
FURTHER AMENDED.
On 13th June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
The Executive Council has approved a further re-organization of
the wage-pegging provisions of National Security ( Economic Organization)
Regulations. The amendment now made will permit action to . be
taken under the 40-hour week legislation recently passed in New South
Wales without danger of conflict with the wage-pegging provisions of
the regulations. The amendment will, however, apply also to any similar measures
that may be passed in other States. Its effect is to permit the payment
of remuneration at an altered rate where the alteration is consequential
on a reduction in working hours made under any State Act coming into
force after to-day."

THE GOVERNMENT.
POLICY-PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH, JUNE, 1947.
On 15th June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said*-
The Labour party is the greatest political party to-day that Australia
has ever known and the only political party that proved, in the
years of war, capable of governing this country. The Labour party at
. uch conferences as this voices its views and discusses not only internal
problems but also gives some thought to international problems associated
with the life of this nation.
I feel that the work of the Labour movement in New South Wales
and in the federal sphere during the past six years is not a story I need
reiterate. .1 do not say that there have not been some shortcomings.
am one, privileged as I have been to lead the Federal Parliamentary
Labour party, who realizes that in the life of a government there are
some things that call for criticism. Criticism is not a bad thing, but I
rhink criticism should be based on facts and should be directed, not
towards individuals particularly, but. generally towards the methods
used. " Now, after six years in which the people have trusted the Labour
party in the federal sphere and in a majority of States, we are faced
with an equally grave responsibility, although not in the atmosphere of
danger and war nor with the same difficulties. But we face a re-orientation
of some of the views on some of the problems. We can fact our
internal problems in an atmosphere of full employment and a better
standard of living than in most countries to-day. We live in a very
troubled world. Grent economic problems face other countries to-day.
Europe is in a very bad way and many persons feel frustrated and disappointed
that leading men of the world cannot find solutions to great
At the inn! conferuce of trhe New S uth W le brh: inich tih A.\ Istrahm;
.; iahour p; ir y. 
problems which beset the world and set a road of guidance for the
future. That is because countries hold such widely diverse views of
what should be the methods and what guidance should ' be given.
Australia can look at the problems very clearly. Great opportunities
and the fulfilment or the achievement of the matters that those
opportunities offer rests with the people in Australia-the Government
can legislate and provide machinery.
In the Pacific, Australia is an isolated island continent, but it
c: an no longer stay out of the affairs of the world or for protection in
defence depend on Britain. The economic problems which beset Britain
to-day have left her in a position in which she must look to the
Dominions to play a great part in maintaining stability and security.
' This country, which is young and a country I hope which will grow
to greater proportions offered opportunities and the Labour party is the
only political party capable of governing the people and giving effect
to their wishes.
Those opportunities must not be lost. First, we must face the
problem of bringing here hundreds of thousands of people from other
countries. If British people are available so much the better, hut manpower
in Britain is much needed to-day, so we must turn to Europe
for hundreds to build up this country. We must determine the best
methods to build Australia and fulfil our destiny. Because of isolation.
we are far from the stress and strife in Europe. We ' have sonime reasonable
stability. The efforts of the Government have been able not only
to . meet the effects of war, but also the transition to peace. Some persons
believe that because there is prosperity-because there are more
jobs than people to fill them, because there are high prices from overseas
exports-that that particular state of affairs, particularly in
regard to prices, might last for ever. We must be prepared, in giving
consideration to our economic affairs, for a reduction in those prices. It
is possible that some measure of decline will come in the market before
many years are passed. We must, in planning the economy of this
country, realize that there is . likely to be some recession in the money
coming to this country from our exports.
In the world of interna. tional affairs, Australia has played a great
part. It has participated in all the councils of the nations of the world.
The Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt), the Australian High
Commissioner in the United Kingdom ( Mr. Beasley), the Australian
Minister at Washington ( Mr. Makin) and the Australian High Commissioner
to Canada ( Mr. Forde)-all representatives of the Labour
movement-have played their part in seeing that Australia has been
heard. We cannot any longer depend on Britain for the defence of this
country. There may be a feeling of frustration that so little has been
achieved so far towards a lasting peace, but there can be no mistake in
the minds of people that there shall be an improved living standard
and their objective is to achieve by some means or other some peace for
the workers of the world. 
" Internally, we are living in a period of full employment. That
has been one of the ideals of the Labour movement, but for the first time
in my association with the Labour movement we have achieved that
object. There must be no faltering in the Federal or . State Labour
parties to ensure that that condition of affairs is maintained and, of
course, to maintain the standard of living of the people. That does not
rest with politicians and it does not rest with parliaments; it rests
with the trade unions and the workers of this country. Unless they
are prepared to play their part and give to the nation and to the
community the very best that they can give, those objectives cannot be
achieved. " I say that the trade union movement owes not only a duty to their
own organizations, but a duty to the community in which they live and
the nation to which they belong. I hope that leaders in the trade union
movement will be inspired in their efforts to see that some of the
industrial troubles which arise will be reduced. I understand that
strikes prove a corrective for many injustices. I can understand an
industrial stoppage on principle, but there have been a. number of
stoppages during recent years not connected with such matters. There
have been stoppages in connexion with demarcation disputes-not disputes
with Governments but dispute among the workers. It" is shocking
that trade unions in a matter of demarcation are not prepared
to take it to a judicial authority. They are like a comic opera and
persons working together who create these situations are not working
for the common good.
" I make it very clear that you should take from these conferences
through the country the realization that this is not a movement
organized for the glorification of its leaders or trade union leaders, but
for the benefit of the people and workers of the country. Personal animosities
cannot be avoided, but whatever they are they have to be subjugated
to the great masses of the people. I ask you to infuse the fire
and spirit which characterized the pioneers of the Labour movement
into the hundreds and thousands throughout the country and see that
Labour is returned to power.
There are persoins who try to cling to the coat-tails of the Labour
movement to espouse philosophies which are not philosophies of the
Labour movement. I say that this is a country of freedom of expression
and freedom to establish any political philosophy, but let those persons
preach their philosophy from their own platform. The Labour movement
lives and achieves the ideals and aspirations of the great working
class persons of this country. The working class consists of men
and women who work, whether manually or otherwise, for the country
and give of their best in their daily toil, whatever that may be.
The Labour party is unique among political parties because in
six States it has its organizations. Men come from 4,000 miles apart
who bring to that Federal Parliamentary Labour party many diverse
views. It is no easy matter to cater for the many parts of Australia
in federal policy, and that is done by federal conference and translated 
into action by the Federal Labour party. It is a great achievement for
a party to create such solidarity as that. There is only one way to
achieve such things, whatever personal feelings we have, and that is by
solidarity. The history of this and every country shows that the people
will not trust parties who are not able to govern themselves and trust
only parties who have ways and methods of achieving their objective.
T think it does no harm to the Labour party or trade union movement
( which forms the foundation of the Labour party) when criticism is
levelled from time to time provided the criticism is based on facts. We
do not wish to live in a mutual admiration society. I have in my party
over 70 federal members drawn from all parts of Australia. It is not
to be expected that they will agree on every proposal or be able to
: gree with one another always. They always agree on objectives, but
sometimes nor on the methods to achieve those objectives. That doe.
not harm the Labour movement. No party can live unless it is progressive
and pressing forward. It must go onwards or die. The con-
: servative parties of this country, because of the diverse interests and
animositie. which exist between persons opposed to Labour methods,
are not able to survive. The solidarity of this movement, particularly
in the war period, was the solidarity necessary for the welfare and preservation
of this country.
In regard to international affairs, our relations with other countries,
our defence policy and the building up of industries are some
, f the great problems only Labour governments are capable of solving.
Relations with other nations of the world must go through the Federal
Government. The Federal Labour party should know the feelings and
v. iews of the people we represent. Out of these conferences you will
give an indication to the Federal Labour party of your outlook on the
questions of the future. I do not think that some persons in Australia
fully realize the changed order in the world to-day. We have a proud
history, but we must not live in the past. The methods of 20 years
ngo are no good to-day. We live in a troubled world. We must be
prepared to keep to the fundamentals of the Labour party, but always
be prepared to modify the general outlook of our views on the affairs
of the world and, in turn, on our own affairs as the affairs of the world
affect us. We have to prepare to build a stronger nation in the Pacific
than to-day, and try to look into the future. Many think just of to-day
or just a year or two ahead. They feel that some particular features
affect them personally and that they are the only ones that matter.
I ask those persons to give some thought to overseas affairs and the
future of this country. We must keep ourselves in close contact with
the affairs of the world and in close contact with other nations. I
believe that only by close co-operation with the people of Great
Britain and the people of America-indeed, with the English-speaking
peoples of the world-can -we keep world peace in the future.
" It may be that the Australian Government has had differences
with Great Britain on administrative matters. Whatever those differences
and however justifiable, one fact is completely clear-we in the 
Pacific must maintain a close co-operation not only with America but
with Great Britain. Regarding Great Britain, apart from sentimental
reasons, a great material factor applies. Great Britain has been the
greatest market for Australian primary product exports, and if only for
material reasons close co-oppration with Great Britain for trade is
essential. " It is a great thing in the Labour movement to feel that we take
in thousands of unions and branches. Men and women are working
for no reward to themselves ' but to give effect to the wishes of the Labour
movement. It is a great thing and a great comfort for any one leading
a party or associated in some task of leadership of a party to know
that these men and women support them. I know that in Australia
hundred. of thousands have been in the Labour movement for 30 or
years without seeking any reward for themselves but for the Labour
movement to be placed in power. The future of this country and the
future of the Labour movement rest with the people themselves. Every
oC e must bhe prepared, whatever be his calling, whatever his duty, in
this timc. of opportunities, to give of his very best. There is only one
way of achieving success and that way is hard work. I ask nothing
more of the movement but to stick solidly together. It has been trusted
lby the peophl to perform the great tasks connected with the problems
of the war and to carry on the tasks associated with the transition into
peace and plan for the years ahead. That is the great trust the people
have placed in us. and I ask the Labour movement to give to those
chosen to lead all the help that cun be given for the needs of the community
and the needs of the nation. By that means can the Labour
movement remain great. If that is done, I have no fear that the
Labour movement will go on growing stronger, and greater, in the
interests of Australia."

CONVERSION LOAN.
NEW YORK OPERATION, JUNE, 1947.
On 15th June, 1947, the Prime 11inister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
A Commonwealth loan has been issued in New York for 38,000,000
dollars to pay off a Commonwealth 5 per cent. loan that matures in
1957, but over which an option of redemption is being exercised.
The terms of the new loan provide for a coupon rate of 31 per
cent. for ten years as to 19,000,000 dollars and -a coupon rate of 31 per
cent. for 20 years as to 19,000,000 dollars, the issue price to the public
in both cases being 974 per cent. The yield to the investor in the case
of the 31 per cent. bonds will be Å“ 3 11s. 1d. and for the 3 per cent.
bonds Å“ 3 13s. 7d.
The new loan will result in a ; aving of interest to the Commonwealth
and to the Governments of Victoria, Queensland, South Australia,
Western Australia and Tasmania."
NEW YORK OPERATIONS, 1946-47.
On 14th July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
In July, 1946, Australia commenced to refinance American loans
for which there was an option of redemption before maturity dates.
Total loans raised by the Commonwealth and the States in respect of
which amounts were outstanding at 30th June, 1946, amounted to
200,000,000 dollars, of which there was an option of redemption by
September, 1947, of 128,000,000 dollars. The summary of operations
since July, 1946, is:-

" The first three operations were highly successful, the amount
underwritten being promptly absorbed by investors. 
" The last operation has not sold as promptly as the previous issues,
due to a variety of reasons, the factors chiefly responsible being the
disturbed international situation. Whereas honds were underwritten
for the full amount, the underwriters were left with 2,000,000 dollars
of the short term and 6,500,000 dollars of the long term when the loan
closed on 8-th July, 1947. Sales of these securities in large parcels
resulted in a heavy fall on the market. At the close of business on 11th
July, 1947. only -2,( iOO, 000 dollars of the long term issue was
unplaced, the whole of the short term having been sold. The short
term arc selling at approximately 96 dollars and the long term at
94 dollars. Total interest saving over aill operations for the abovementioned
loans is about' 2,000.000 dollars a year.
" There will be no further operations by the Commonwealth on
the New York miarket before 1952."
WHEAT STABILIZATION SCHEME.
POST-WAR--FEDERATION PROPOSAL.
On 19th June, 1947, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard),
said that representatives of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation
from New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia had placed
proposals before him for amendments to the Government's five years
wheat stabilization plan. The federation asked that the guaranteed
floor price for wheat be based on the cost of the production, which would
include a remunerative wage for the grower and interest on capital
involved. It asked that the price of wheat for local consumption
as flour should be based on a cost plus principle, subject to immediate
and periodic review and adjustment in accordance with fluctuations in
cost. TJhe federation's request that the plan should not begin until the
marketing of the crop subsequent to its proposed amended plan coming
into effect would mean that the present plan as it affected 1945-46
and 1946-47 crops would be abandoned. It might also require the
abandonment of the stabilization plan in respect of the 1947-48 harvest,
because it was likely that time would not permit the Commonwealth
and the States to pass legislation through the respective Parliaments in
time to make it apply to that harvest.
He had told the deputation that if the Government was to go on
with stabilization it could be expected that when prices for wheat were
high growers should provide some reserves for periods when prices were
low. If they did so. the Government was prepared to back the plan's
operation. It could not exclude from the operation of the plan the
harvest marketed when prices, as at present, were abnormally high.
The Government would be prepared, however, to consider an extension
of the plan be-' yond the 1949-50 harvest. The present Act would enable
that to, be donne provided State Governments were agreeable. He would 
consider recommending to the Government that the present plan. be
extended for two years with provision that a review be made during
the period to determine whether it should be extended for a further
three years, making ten years in all.
POST-WAR PRODUCTION COSTS, INQUIRY.
On 4th July, 1947, Mr. Pollard said-
" The chairman of the Wheat Costs of Production Committee
informs me that over 3,000 questionaires were issued at random to
wheat farmers and that only 250 have been completed and returned.
I have informed the committee that I would not ask it to make a
report if it were of the opinion that the facts before it were not sufficient
to give a true picture of the industry. I ask wheat-growers to fill. in
the questionnaires and return them without delay."
( For earlier references, please see No. 116, page 30; No. 123, page 28.)
ACREAGE-1947-48.
On 29th July, 1947, Mr. Pollard said that Australian wheat sowings,
which had declined heavily during the war, had now appreciated, and
for 1947-48 the acreage sown would be 15,500,000 acres, compared with
: in average of 13,303,000 acres during the 10 years prior to the war.
FIGHTING FORCES.
CAT'IONAL SERVICES-RECONSTRCT I ON
TRAINING SCHEME, FIGURES.
On 21st June, 1947, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway) said
that at 23rd May, 1947, 135,648 ex-service personnel had either begun
training, completed training, or had been placed in employment as
per cent. efficient and were completing their training on the job, or
were still carrying on their training in the training centres under the
Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme.
WAR SERVICE MORATORIUM-EXTENSION.
Oni 2nd July, 1047, the Prime Ministf-r ( Mr. Chitley) said-
" National Security ( War Service Moratorium) Regulations give
l&gt; ecial rights and protection in tenancy matters to protected persons'
The most important protection is a provision that a tenant who is a
' protected person cannot be evicted unless the lessor can show that
suitable alternative accommodation Ls or has been available to the tenant.
discharged member of the forces is a protected person
SCabinet decided to-day that the period of p: ruotrion muder the
regulations to dis:: harged members of the force.; tlhir ld: ne'ila nts b"
extended from two years to three years.
The Re-establishment and Employment Act providis that land
owned . by a member of the forces shall not be acquired compulsorily
without the consent of the Attorney-General. Cabinet decided to-day
that the period of protection to discharged member. of the forces he
ixtended from one year to two years." 
RETURNED FROM ACTIVE SERVICE BADGE.
On 17th July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
" When the badge was introduced in 1941 it \ was laid down
that it would be issued at the time of discharge or, in the cast,
of the Royal Australian Navy, at the cessation of hostilities:
Recently it has been represented that eligible serving members
of the forces who may be permitted to wear civilian clothes were at
a disadvantage by comparison with discharged members because they
were not in possession of the appropriate emblem denoting their having
participated in active service. It has been decided that the authority
under which eligible personnel who are still serving in the Royal
Australian Navy may be issued with the ' Returned from Active
Service' badge shall be extended to apply to eligible serving members
of the Australian Military Forces and the Royal Australian Air Force."
PEACE.
JAPAN-WHALING EXPEDITION.
On 2sird June, 1947, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt
said-On 7th August, 1946, the Japanese Government was authorized
by S. C. A. P. to undertake a whaling expedition to the Antarctic during
the 1946-47 season. Principal reasons given for the authorization were
. hortage of food in Japan and world shortage of oils and fats. There
was no prior consultation with interested Allied Governments, such as
\ nstralia, Britain, New Zealand and Norway.
The Australian Government immediately made strong representations
to the United States on grounds of past prejudicial action by
Japanese ships to Australian security, on earlier violations by the
Japanese cf international whaling regulations, and on the inefficiency
and wastefulness of Japanese methods. It was a matter for special
concern to Australia that decisions of this kind should be made while
the occupation of Japan was still proceeding and in advance of the
peace settlement, and without reference to the overall question of
reparations. The Australian prntest was supported by Norway, Britain
aind New Zealand.
After the Australian representations, it was agreed that an Australian
observer should accompany the expedition; furthermore, that
an international flag should be substituted for Japanese insignia; that
the routes to be taken by the expedition to and from the Antarctic
should be notified to interested governments and that the oil obtained
as a result of the expedition should be subject to allocation by the International
Emergency Food Council. Authorization of the expedition
became operative only for the 1946-47 season, the United States undertalking
that other interested governments would be fully consulted should 
: ny further Japanese activities outside Japanese wa. ters be contemplated.
The United States agreed that the future of the Japanese whaling
industry and the disposal of Japanese whaling equipment was a
matter for decision by the Allies.
" The Australian Government is opposed to the re-establishment
of the Japanese whaling industry in Antarctic waters. Such re-establishment,
which in effect means the creation again of naval potential, is
ipposed to a just settlement with Japan and should be strenuously
resisted by every Allied country which contributed to victory in the
Pacific war. When it became apparent recently that, notwithstanding
the undertaking regarding consultation and the adverse report by the
Australian observer with . the first expedition, it was proposed to send a
second Japanese expedition to the Antarctic, the Australian Government
made the positive and practical suggestion to the United States
that a unit of the Japanese whaling fleet be operated by Australia, with
the aid of Britain, New Zealand and Norway. Food, fats and oils
from the expedition would be at the disposal of S. C. A. P. for distribution.
The Australian offer was communicated to the United States
State Department, and while under consideration the announcement of
a second expedition was made.
The decision of 22nd June, 1947, to approve of a second Japanese
whaling expedition for 1947-48, thereby by-passing . the Far Eastern
Commission, which alone is supposed to determine questions of policy
and which actually has this matter on its business sheet for 26th June,
is opposed to the best long-term Allied interests. The Australian
Government intends to press this question in the Far Eastern Commission
to secure a review of the present proposal.
" The ultimate disposition of Japanese whaling facilities and equipmnent,
as well as the question of the future of the Japanese whaling
industry, must be a matter for Allied consultation and decision. The
appropriate place for any decision that may be taken is the peace
table." JAPAN-BRITISH COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE.
On 23rd June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
The . preliminary conference of British Commonwealth countries
to discuss the peace treaty with Japan will meet in Canberra on 26th
August, 1947." JAPAN-ADVISORY COMMITTEE.
On 8th July, 1947, Dr. Evatt said that he was establishing an
ndvisory committee to examine questions related to the Japanese peace
settlement. The committee would meet under the chairmanship of Sir
Frederic Eggleston, formerly Australian Minister to China and later 
to the United States. Sir Frederic had been working on problems
related to the Japanese settlement in conjunction with departmental
officers both at Canberra and abroad. The committee would include
members of Parliament in addition to a representative group of Australians
versed in one aspect or another of the subject.
JAPAN-PROPOSED UNITED STATES MEETING.
On 17th July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
Australia is always prepared to take part in any discussions that
will expedite the Pacific peace settlement and ' appreciates the present
proposal of the United States Government to hold a conference of eleven
nations on 19th August, 1947. But the date is entirely unsuitable to
Australia in view of the British Commonwealth conference on 26th
August, 1947."
On 18th July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
Australia will attend the coliference convened by the United
States Government on the Japanese peace settlement, but on the date
will depend which Minister will attend, and whether the Minister for
External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt) can fit in his engagements with the
conference." NATIONAL THEATRE.
On 23rd June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chiflcy) saidpropose
to appoint a committee soon after Parliament reassembles
in September, 1947, to examine the possibility of establishing
a national theatre at Canberra. Some persons believe that the theatre
is for educational purposes but I think it should also have an entertainment
value as well. I believe that it would be possible to have a small
theatre to which leading players in companies from the States could be
hrought to give performances."

MOTOR CAR PRODUCTION.
CAR CHASSIS IMPORTS.
On 24th June, 1947, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice)
; nlnounced that imports of pressed metal body panels, not fabricated
beyond trimming of the edges, would be permitted for use in the manufacture
in Australia of bodies for car and truck chassis, provided the
pane! s were shlipped from the country of origin to Australia on or
before 31st December, 1947. The imports were permitted because of the
present shortage of steel sheets suitable for motor vehicle body manufacture
and to assist in making the maximum number of motor vehicles
available to Australian essential users in the shortest possible time. 
JAPAN.
TRADE-PRIVATE TRADING.
On 26th June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
The control authorities in Japan have fixed 15th August, 1947, as
the date on which the resumption of private international commercial
relations with Japan will be authorized. Because of accommodation
difficulties, only 400 private trade representatives will be allowed entry
into Japan in the initial stages and the length of their stay will be
limited to 21 days unless arrangements are made by the Governments
concerned with the control authorities for an extension of this period.
:\ ustralia has been provisionially allotted a quota of 24 representatives.
" An inter-departmental committee is engaged in considering the
priority to be accorded to private traders who desire to visit Japan and
interested persons are invited to submit applications before 5th July,
1947. Traders who desire to arrange for the purchase of Japanese
goods should submit full particulars to the Department of Trade and
C: ustoms, while those interested in selling goods to Japan should furnish
, letails to the Department of Commerce and Agriculture.
" In the early stages private trade will not reach substantial proportions.
Because of prior commitments, the control authorities have
indicated that cotton textiles, raw silk and tea will not be available
immediately for s-ale to private traders. The Commonwealth Government
has arranged for the purchase of 12,000,000 yards of cotton textiles
and quantities of raw silk and will continue these purchases until
private traders are permitted to operate. Purchases on private account
will be governed -by the range and quantity of goods available and the
limitations imposed by the Australian import licensing system.
Australian exports to Japan are likely to be restricted to wool and
a; few minor commodities not subject to international control nor
covered by long-term contracts with other countries."
On 16th July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
" A number of applications have been received from businessmen
who desire to send representatives to Japan. A selection has been made
by an inter-departmental committee to determine the limited number
who will comprise the first party to visit Japan. The interests concerned
will be notified of the selections at -an early date.
Priority has been accorded to firms which ' had extensive pre-war
interests in Japanese trade and representatives of associations and
manufacturers who are anxious to obtain supplies of essential commodities
for use in Australian industry.
" An overall consideration has been the class of goods in which it
is desired to trade. In this connexion, when private trade with Japan
is resumed, raw silk and cotton textiles will not be available for purchase
by private traders immediately. Merchant-to-merchant trading will be
permitted in other goods, but imports to Australia will be subject to
licensing control on the basis at present accorded to imports from hard 
currency areas. Import licences will be granted only for essential goods
which are not available in adequate quantities from local or sterling
sources of supply. Licences will not be granted for importation of fancy
goods, toys, crockery and other less essential goods that featured in prewar
trade with Japan.
As each party will be allowed to stay in Japan for only a limited
ipriod, further opportunities will occur for visits by Australian business
representatives. Commercial interests not included in the first party
will receive consideration in subsequent parties."
TRADE-WOOL.
On l2nd July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
Following negotiations . between the Comnimonwealth Government
and the Supreme Command Allied Powers in Japan, 7,481 bales of particular
types of low grade wool were shipped to Japan in May, 1947.
Arrangements were made for payment in dollars in New York as a
set-off against the purchase price of raw silk obtained in Japan by the
Commonwealth Government.
Following representations by Cabinet decided . to-day that
further negotiations be instituted for the sale of somewhat better types
of wool. The Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard) has been authorized
to take up the negotiations and, if successful, . the Australian Wool
Realization Commission will larrange for the purchase and shipment bf
the wool to Japan."

RECONSTRUCTION.
U. N. R. R. A.-AUSTRALIA'S PART.
On 30th June, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chlifley) said-
" I have to-day received the following message from the Director-
General of U. N. R. R. A. at Washington ( Major-General Lowell W.
Rooks):-" To-day U. N. R. R. A.' s operations substantially come to an end in
Europe. In a public statement I have referred to the results achieved
by this international organization and to the pro. blems which still
confront the world in restoring its economy.
I should like to take this opportunity of extending to the Commonwealth
Government and to the people of Australia the great appreciation
for the generous and effective contribution they have made to the
work of this organization. Those contributions, with similar assistance
from other uninvaded members of the United Nations, have provided
the means of saving the lives of endless millions of people in the war
devastated countries. From its experience, U. N. R. R. A. knows how
much that assistance h'as been appreciated, and there exists to-day in 
the hearts of millions of people throughout the world a very real
gratitude to the people of Australia for the supplies and services they
have received through the organization of U. N. R. R. A.
I should like to thank you also for the provision of so many fine and
experienced meu and women to serve with U. N. R. R. A. in many parts
of the world. They have served with distinction and success and have
dlone much to enhance the reputation of their country.
U. N. R. R. A. has done its best to carry out the instructions of the
United Nations in commencing the work of economic recovery in many
parts of the world. U. N. R. R. A. trusts that this work will be carried on
quickly and effectively, realizing that one of the essentials of world
peace is thatr rea. onable economic conditions shall exist in all countries."
WOMEN'S WAR ORGANIZATIONS.
W. A. A. A. F.-CESSATION.
On 30th June, 1947, the Minister for Air ( Mr. Drakeford) said
that the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, which had a peak
strength of 26.245, had ceased to function that day.
PRICES.
GOODS DECLARED "-BANANAS, REVOCATION.
On 1st July, 1947, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice)
announced that it had been decided to lift growers' ceilings on bananas.
Retail margins on bananas would continue to be fixed. Wholesale prices
would be kept under notice and control would be re-imposed if there
was any suggestion of exploitation of the market.
GOODS DECLARED "-PINEAPPLES, REVOCATION.
On 1st July, 1947, Senator Courtice announced that it had been
decided to lift growers' ceilings on pineapples. Retail margins on
pineapples would continue to be fixed. If prices rose to a level that
suggested exploitation, consideration would be given to re-imposing
controls. CIVIL AVIATION.
BRITAIN-AUSTRALIA SERVICE-QANTAS LTD.,
AGREEMENT, DIRECTORS.
On 2nd July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Following the conclusion of the agreement by which Qantas
Empire Airways Ltd., has been taken over by the Commonwealth
Government, Cabinet decided to-day to appoint Mr. W. H. Fysh as
general manager, with the vice-chairman of the Australian National
Airlines Commission ( Mr. W. C. Taylor), the Treasury member of that
commission ( Mr. G. P. N. Watt) and Sir Keith Smith as members
of the boai'd of directors."

POST-WAR-INTERNAL ROUTES, AIRWAYS CHARGES.
On 4th July, 1947, the Minister for Civil Aviation ( Mr. Drakeford)
announced that the Government had decided to introduce charges for the
use by operators of aircraft of airways facilities provided by the
Commonwealth. Modern air transport demanded increasing ground
facilities, aeradio, and navigational aids and meteorological services,
and it had become customary throughout the world for the authority
providing the airways facilities to make charges for their use, designed
to recoup part of the expenditure. It had been" decided that a system
of air route charges should be applied on regular services regardless of
the number of landings involved. Aircraft used for purposes other
than regular airline services would be classified according to the nature
of the use to which they were put, and annual fees would be charged.
Payment of charges would be introduced as from 1st August, 1947.
On 25th July, 1947, Mr. Drakeford announced details of the system
of charges for the use of Commonwealth aerodromes and air route facilities
to he payable as from 1st August, 1947. It was estimated that the
charges would bring in about Å“ 300,000 a year, but that would recoup
the Commonwealth for only a small portion of its annual expenditure
on maintenance of air ports and airways facilities. Aircraft would be
divided into four classes-
Those used for purely private purposes: tlhoie used fir tle hllim. ris purpo. ses
of the owner: those used for reiumnerative purposes other th: rin n r I,; gilari rline
and those used for the operation of airline services.
The first three classes would pay an annual fee which would be
lowest in the private category and progressively higher in the other two
classes. The fee would be based on the weight of the aircraft and would
cover the use of any aerodromes and airways facilities. Examples of the
annual charges payable by owners of aircraft in eacl of the three classes
were:-SClass 1. Clw 2. Class 3.
t d.
Tiger Moth 3 5 1 0 9 15 0
D. H. 4 ( l) raon) 8 2 ti 17 5 0 25 7 6
Anson 14 12 6 29 5 0 43 17 6
Operators of aircraft used on regular aircraft services would not pay
the annual charges for those aircraft but would pay a charge in respect
of each route unit traversed. To determine the number of units the
routes had been classified having regard to their length, the number of
aerodromes and emergency landing ground and the availability of
navigational aids. The comparatively short Melbourne-Sydney stage
was rated as a two-unit route, while a much longer but less highly
developed route such as the Derby-Kimberley Stations route was classified
as one unit. A basic charge had been fixed for each type of aircraft 
a~ nd the amnount payable for c ach flight would be the basic charge
multiplied by the number of units, traversed. Examples of the charges
were: M15esi1. 3 W. u y. Adelaide or Hohart-D. C. 3. Å“ 4 14S. lid.-D. U. 4.

Trans-Australia. Airlines andl Qantas Empire Airways Ltd. would
pay the charges on the Same basis as other airline operators.
The charges did not apply to aircraft used on regular international
nir services. Charges for-those services would be promnulgated later.
I. C. A. O.-AUSTRALJAN REPRESENTATIVE.
On 10th July, 1947, Mr. Drakeford announced that Dr. K. N. . E.
Bradfield had been appointed Australian representative at the International
Civil Aviation Organization's head-quarters at Montreal,

NORTHERN AUSTRALIA.
DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE.
On 2nd July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" In 1945, the Northern Australia Development Committee -was
appointed comprising representatives of the Commonwealth, Queensland
and Western Australian Governments. Matters of policy are canczidered
by the Minister for the Interior ( Mir. Johnson). the Premiers
, if Queenqland and Western Australia and myself. 
" The committee h-as prepared a comprehensive report dealing
specifically with general measures for the relief of disabilities; specific
measures for the development of industries; and measures necessary to
develop specific regions.
Cabinet decided to-day that a sub-committee, comprising the Minister
for the Interior, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and
myself as Treasurer and Acting Minister for Defence, should examine
the report -and recommendations of the committee, and report to
Cabinet." EXTERNAL TERRITORIES.
NEW GUINEA-PAPUA-WAR GRATUITY FOR NATIVES.
On 2nd July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
The question of payment of war gratuity for natives of New
Guinea and Papua was considered by the Parliamentary Committee
which furnished a report on the question of war gratuity. The outstanding
service rendered by these natives was fully recognized, but the
Iommittee was not in possession of sufficient information to enable a
recommendation to be made as to the appropriate method of rewarding
their service. The question has been since considered after consultation
with the Departments of External Territories, the Navy and the Army.
" C: abinet to-day approved of a gratuity for natives of New Guinea
and Papua who were enlisted as members of the forces, payment to be
at the rate of 5s. a month for each month of service; the gratuity not
to be paid for any period prior to 7th Pecember, 1941; no qualifying
period to be required; native members who have been discharged for
disciplinary reasons to be ineligible for the gratuity; payment to be
made as early as practicable.
An ex gratia payment has been approved, subject to the conditions
approved for natives enlisted in the forces, for the following classes
of civilian natives-members of the New Guinea Police Force and the
Royal Papuan Constabulary; civilians employed as combatant soldiers
by the Allied Intelligence Bureau prior to their enlistment in the " M
Special Unit Infantry Battalion on 1st February. 1945.'
SERVICE PAY RATES.
REPATRIATION-COMMISSION, APPOINTMENTS.
On 2nd July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" Following the recent death of the Deputy Chairman of the
Repatriation Commission ( Mr. John Webster), Cabinet to-day
appointed Brigadier H. H. Hammer as a member of the commission
until 14th October, 1950. iMr. II. F. Gascoigne-Roy and Mr. T. S.
Hooks have be-en : iI. poinied A'scinmt CoTininissionrer; ninitil I13th July.

RATIONING.
SUGAR-REVOCATION.
On 2nd July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifey) said-
" Cabinet decided to-day that rationing of sugar be abandoned forthwith.
The principal reasons for introducing sugar rationing no longer
; apply. Sugar rationing in Australia does not greatly help Britain. There
is an arrangement whereby the United States, Canada and Britain draw
equal per capita shares from the world's sugar supply. For every
10,000 tons of sugar contributed by Australia to the pool, Britain
draws only about 2,000 tons. Distribution of sugar is decided by the
World Emergency Food Council. World production of sugar showed a
marked increase in the 1946-47 season."
MEAT-CONTINUANCE.
On 2nd July, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
Cabinet was informed to-day that representatives of the Meat and
Allied Trades Federation had asked the Minister for Comunerce ( Mr.
Pallard) and the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice) that rationing
and price control of meat should be removed from 15th August,
1947, that being the period of flush supply.
The meat position in Britain is acute and on : 3th .1 ine, 1947, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer ( Dr. Dalton) announced in the House of
Commons that there would be a further cut in the imeat ration from
is. 4d. worth a week ( including 4d. worth of canned meat) to is. 2d.
worth a week.
Cabinet decided that it was not possible to remove the controls.
It would be very wrong for the Commonwealth Government to permit
unrestricted consumption of meat when the British people are having
their meagre ration further reduced. The matter will be brought before
Cabinet again when there are indications that -upply of meat in Australia
will be sufficient to provide not only an unrestricted Au. l tralian
demand but an adequate amount for export to Brit: liii."
SHIPBUILDING.
IOST-WAR--DE-REQUISIT rONING.
On 2nd July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Cabinet decided to-day that interstate and intra-state -vessels ( but
not including passenger and other vessels required by and under charter
to the Navy Department) be de-requisitioned at the earliest possible
date and that the Minister for Shipping ( Senator Ashley) de-requisition
individual vessels as they terminate voyages and come into position
for re-delivery at home ports. But the Minister is empowered to defer
the de-requisitioning of particular vessels when such action is regarded
by him as essential to ensure efficient conduct of particular . rvice for
example the services to New Guinea and adjacent islands. 
Details associated with the matter will be dealt with by a Cabinet
sub-committee comprising Senator Ashley, the Minister for Customs
( Senator Courtice) and myself."

AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES.
ROYAL MILITARY COLLEGE.
On 2nd July, 1947, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Chambers)
announced that the intake of cadets into the Royal Military College,
Duntroon. w'ould be increased in 1948 to 60 Australians and ten New
Zealanders. AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING COMMISSION.
APPOINTMENTS.
On 3rd July, 1947, the Postmaster-General ( Senator Cameron)
announced that Mr. J. S. Hanlon and Professor J. D. G. Medley had
been appointed members of the Australian Broadcasting Commission
for three years from 1st July, 1947.
TARIFF.
EXPORTS-STANDARDS.
On ith July, 1947, the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard) said
that Australian manufacturers must pay greater attention to the sales
of their prodncts overseas if present industrial employment and production
levels were to be maintained. There were no grounds for complacency
in the fact that, despite export restrictions to ensure supplies
for local needs, value of manufactures exported would probably reach
Å“ 45,000,000. The figures had been achieved at a time when many competitive
European countries had not reached their full export capacity
of manufactures. Once local demand fell to normal, Australian surplus
production would have to be exported, or productive capacity reduced
with consequent unemployment. Manufacturers should remember that
not only Australian production would reduce local demands.
A good deal of Australian secondary industry had been built up
behind protective harriers but a considerable section of it had never
met the full shock of competition from imported goods, nor participated
in the exucting business of overseas trading. Overseas countries had
accepted Australian export methods to date, but would continue to do so
only if the export business procedures practised by many Australian
manufacturers and exporters were radically changed. To gain and
hold thl export markets they would soon require manufacturers and
exporters should conform to trading practices followed by competitor
nations. Goods should be strongly packed, correctly labelled and documented
and of competitive quality. 
.32
NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES.
POLICY-MEDIATION.
On 9th July, 1947, the Minister for External Affair. i ( Dr. Evat)
said that the Australian Government welcomed reports that further progress
had been made towards a permanent settlement in Indonesia.
The de facto authority of the republic, on the basis of the Linggadjati
Agreement, which had been recognized by several goveriineiint, including
the British and United States Governments, and which the Australian
Government recognized, implied the acceptance by the Republican
Government of very great responsibility; and the Republican
Government, -as one of the negotiating parties and as a future essential
element in the interim Federal State, had accepted the responsibility.
The Australian Government sent representatives to Indonesia to assist
in solving problems related to the recommencement of trade. The Australian
Government wished both parties to understand that, if, in the
interests of agreement between Dutch and Republican authorities on
economic and political matters, the good offices of the Australian
Government would be helpful, Australia would continue to do anything
in its power to afford both the Netherlands and Indonesian authorities
its assistance. Further, the Australian Government would give to the
interim Federal Government, when established, advice and assistance in
such matters as trade, finance, communications, and rconorni
rehabilitation and development.
POL[ CY-SECRITRTY COUNCIL.
On 30th , July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" The Australian Government has ilnstricted its representative on
the Security Council to draw the attention of the Security Council to
the situation in Indonesia under Article 39 of the United Nation.
Charter. Australia has taken action ten days after hostilities commenced
in rndonisia, because, in accordance with Article 33 of the
Charter. the parties to any dispute are obliged to seek a solution by
negotiation or mediatics. Strenuous attempts have been made in consultation
wilh other Governments, particularly Britain, United States
and India, to bring ' about a solution in that way. However, it is felt
that further delay is not justified because of the loss of life being
sustained. " The policy Australia has adopted in past disputes has been to
urge an investigation under Article 34 of the Charter before any decisions
are reached. However, the situation in Indonesia differs from
any previously brought before the council. Hostilities are being
carried on. Investigation is not required to establish the crucial fact.
and, before the Council determines further action, it is essential that
hostilities cease. For this reason, Australia has drawn the attention
of the Council to the situation under Article 39 of the Charter and
thereby gives power to the council immediately to order the cessation
of hostilities and subsequently to take such further steps as are necessary
to restore peace. 
33
This is the first time that this article has been invoked and it is
the hope of the Government, in taking this section, that not only will
hostilities cease, but that the Council will prove its worth in dealing
quickly and effectively with a situation of this kind.
" In making this move, Australia still maintains the judicial attitude
which it has . always maintained in considering any situation before
the council. No attempt will be made to pre-judge the issue, and discussion
of merits of the case will be avoided. The Australian representative
will ask first that the necessary steps be taken to terminate
hostilities, and, second, without discussing the merits of the situation,
that both parties act upon Article 17 of the Linggadjati Agreement,
which specifically provides that, in the event of disagreement between
the two parties arising out of the agreement, a third party will be
asked to arbitrate, or, failing that, the matter should be referred to
the Chief Justice of the International Court. If the Australian proposal
is given effect to without delay or debate on procedural issues,
and if it is readily admitted by the Council that the situation is one
within its jurisdiction, there should be good prospect of an immediate
cessation of hostilities, and an immediate negotiation between the two
parties with the assistance of a third party of their own choosing.
Members of the Council should not therefore have to arbitrate or to
pass judgment on the merits of the case.
Action along these lines can be taken by the Council only if the
Republican Government, not being a member of the United Nations,
undertakes to observe the obligations and duties of the United Nations
Charter, and in particular undertakes to observe Article 25, which
obliges members to carry out the decisions of the council."

On 10th July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-

STRENGTH, MARCH, 1947.
On 14th July, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" Incorrect statements have been published that Commonwealth
employees numbered 556,700 in March, 1947. The fact is that in March,

that, of the total number of ' government employees, 28 per cent, were
employed by Commonwealth authorities, 62 per cent, by State Governments
and 10 per cent. -by local authorities. Nearly one-third of all
Commonwealth employees are employed in the Postmaster-General's
Department, and nearly another third in the Services departments and
in post-war services, including the Repatriation Department."

COMPANIES-ISSUE OF SHARES AT A PREMIUM.
On 21st July, 1947, the Prime Minist&amp; r ( Mr. Chifley) said-
A statement I made in October, 1946, set out that premiums on new
share issues would not necessarily -be insisted upon. In that statement
I requested that, where an issue at par was proposed by a company
whose shares were appreciably above par, the application should include
a statement of the reasons for not requiring a premium. Since then
some companies -had required premiums-others had not.
i" I have reviewed the position and have decided that it is desirable
ithe interests of the Australian economy that a premium should be
required in all cases where there is an -appreciable margin between par
value and market price. I have accordingly requested the Capital
Issues Advisory Committee to give this aspect consideration in future.
The committee will not insist on prohibitive premiums but will allow
reasonable margins."

INDUSTRIAL.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS-CONFERENCE, DECISIONS.
On 3rd August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
While I survey with satisfaction the great increase in the industrial
capacity of Australia, the existence of full employment in the community,
the progress made in providing a degree of economic security
for our people, I am gravely concerned with the shortages of houses
and of goods needed by the people and the delays in carrying out works
vital to the maintenance and development of this country.
Manpower shortages will not permit the accumulated needs of the
war years to be overtaken and current requirements to be met at once
or in the immediate future. I am convinced, however, that Australians
united in effort-as they were in war-can attack and overcome more
speedily a situation that is detrimental to the economy of the nation
and the best interests of its people.
To-day, Australia has the greatest opportunity in its history.
There is a world shortage of basic commodities which Australia excels
in producing. High prices are obtainable for our exports. New
markets are opening for both our primary and secondary products.
Internally, industry has vast plans for expansion, and there is opportunity
for intense activity in the building of houses, hospitals, schools,
factories and development of roads, airports, railways, water conservation
and electrical schemes. If we do not take full advantage of this
opportunity it will be mainly because individual Australians have
failed-failed to realize that Australia's good is their good and that
of their children.
" I appeal then to every individual Australian to give of his best
in whatever occupation he may follow. To do less is a denial of the
needs of his fellow Australians. Let each Australian then develop a
new spirit-a new vision of the personal importance of his efforts to
this country and his fellows. I appeal to the leaders of the trades union
movement to exercise firm discipline over the units they lead, to prevent
unauthorized strikes, to eliminate inter-union disputes, to avoid disputes
over small matters, and to concentrate their efforts and thoughts on
the production this country so sorely needs. I call on each unionist to
give unswerving loyalty to such leaders. I call on the employers of
this country for more production, for the utmost efficiency in their
methods, for a greater personal interest in the industrial problems of
the human beings who are their employees, for the provision of better
working conditions for those employees, for a broad tolerance towards
workers suffering from the strain of war and experiencing a natural
reaction to war-time conditions. Above all, I ask them to be ready
and generous in sharing with their employees the benefits of the
increased production that I feel confident will take place.
" I ask that all parties in industry will avoid those things that
have been sapping the industrial strength of this country and preventing
the achievement of higher living standards for our people. I invite 
willing acceptance of the principle of conciliation and arbitration and
trust that all. will co-operate in giving a fair trial to the new scheme
of arbitration and conciliation which will soon be in operation.
This country cannot but be affected by the economic changes
taking place beyond its -boundaries. It is vital that our own econom3
be stabilized to meet possible repercussions from abroad. Steady work
by each and every Australian will be the most powerful factor in
aIchieving this. Given this, we protect ourselves, we give the best aid
to Britain in its sore plight, we make a contribution to the solidity and
welfare of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and we do something
for the stricken people of countries devastated by war-peoples afflicted
with a spiritual and physical misery never known in this country and
the depths of which are so abysmal as to be almost beyond
. omprehension. " I am pleased with the results of the conference over which I
presided in Canberra, and I feel that the people of Australia have much
to hope for from the operation of the machinery for closer consultation
between employers. employee, and the Government that has been
established." On 3rd August, 1947. Mr. Chifley, the PresideL-r of th:.
Australasian Council of Trades Unions ( Mr. P. J. Clarey, M. L. C.)
and the President of the A\ ssociated Chambers of Manufactures. ( Mr.
Robinson) said-
" The three constituent bodies associated witlh industry, the Government,
the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia and the
A\ ustralasian Council of Trade Unions having met in conference have
reached the following conclusions:-
1. Increased production is essential for the continuance of satisfactory
Australian living standards; their improvement; the meeting
of many shortages in both capital and consumable goods, and for the
relieving of the inconveniences and hardships at present being
experienced by Australian citizens. These shortages relate to the things
which intimately concern the life of Australian men and women, such
as housing, clothing and many other commodities. The parties, therefore,
agree that every effort should be made to stimulate and promote.
production to the highest possible point, consistent with existing manpower
and productive resources. This is a matter in which all must
co-operate. It is the function of not one section of society, but of all.
The parties believe there are ways in which this increased production
can be achieved, notwithstanding the belief that all sections of" the
community are now honourably playing their part. It is suggested that
the three constituent parties endeavour to stimulate production by
means of more efficient management, where possible, the introduction
of up-to-date plant and machinery, the elimination of waste, by using
every effort to reduce labour turn-over by cutting out unnecessary
absenteeism, and to prevent the abuse of sick leave provisions. This
appeal is made not only in the interests of the people of AuAtral) a. 
but also that the people of Australia can play their part in making
more commodities available to the people of Britain, and enabling
commodities to be secured from other countries in the world for our
convenience and welfare.
Consideration of the production needs of Australia have indic:
ated tlat two major bottlenecks exist toward the overcoming of
which the influence of the three parties should be exerted to the fullest.
The major bottleneck, that of coal, is one which the parties feel can
be best solved by the recently appointed Joint Coal Board, which is now
concentrating its efforts on a solution of this great economic problem.
We make an earnest appeal to the coal miners and those closely engaged
in the production of coal, and its distribution, to assist to their utmost.
The other major bottleneck is that of man-power. The economic
expansion of Australia during the last seven years has made a great
demand for additional men and women for industry. The parties
suggest that many persons who gave fully and freely of their services
during the war period to help the nation in its period of stress should,
as far as possible, make themselves available to industry to overcome
the grave shortages resulting from an almost complete war-time cessation
of production of consumable goods which must now be made available,
in addition to normal peace-time requirements of the nation.
3. It was evident to the conference that. from a general review
of the economic and employment position, free or private enterprise
in the past and at present is the major avenue for providing work.
It is, therefore, the avenue providing the greatest measure of employment.
Complete understanding between the controllers of enterprise
: end representatives of the workers is, therefore, essential if industrial
relations are to be established on a satisfactory basis.
4. The matter of prevention and settlement of industrial disputes
ictween employer and employee is fundamental to the efficient and
smooth running of industry. All parties to the conference agree that
the conciliation and arbitration machinery provided by the Commonwvealth
and the States provides a means whereby differences between
t: mployer and employee should be readily determined. In the settlement
of industrial disputes, conciliation should be exercised to the
fullest before final resort is made to arbitration. It is desirable in the
interests of the community that industrial disputes should be reduced
to the barest possible minimum. The trades union representatives have
expressed their disagreement with unauthorized strikes arising without
consultation, either with the trades union concerned, the Trades and
Labour Council of the States, or the Australasian Council of Trade
Unions ini the Federal sphere.
5. The right of the worker to share in the proceeds of industry is
ine which has received the full consideration of conference. It is
agreed by all parties that increased standards of living are only possible
from constantly increasing production of goods and services required.
The right of the vorker to recefive his proportionate share of increased 
production is recognized, but the manner in which this should be granted
to workers in industry is subject to difference of opinion. The
employers have suggested that a satisfactory solution would be for the
introduction or extension of incentive payments, which would.. give.. a
daily or weekly benefit to the worker from the results of his immediate
higher production. The trades union attitude is one of distaste for
incentive payment, based on past experience. The Australasian Council
of Trade Unions intimated to the conference -that it is prepared to make
a full and complete investigation into modern incentive payment systems
to determine whether such systems would be of advantage to the worker
and the community. The employers intimated to the trades union
representatives that they were prepared to place before thern information
requested and give assistance so that this investigarion could be
thoroughly undertaken.
The holding of this conference to achieve better understanding
between the partners of industry has indicated that view points on
matters of policy and principle have varied greatly. The conference,
however, has enabled both parties in a free and frank manner to state
their views and the reasons for them. Conference is, therefore, of the
opinion that frequent consultations of this character are essential for
securing better industrial relations and undisturbed continuity of production.
It is agreed that similar conferences should be held at six
monthly periods so that econome trends, industrial and other problems
might be fully considered.
The parties agree to advise each other as to matters which
they feel should be considered by conference so that they may be able
to investigate such matters with a view to decisions being arrived at
when conference meets

and 192 females, nearly 700 below the total for June, 1947. At 31st
July, 1947, the Commonwealth Employment Service held unfilled
vacancies for 42,100 males and 30,700 females, a rise of some 3,000 on
the previous month, the total number of vacancies being over 100,000.

PEACE.
JAPAN-VISIT OF DR. EVATT.
On 5th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" 1 have received the following message from the Supreme Commrander,
Allied Powers ( General of the Army Douglas MacArthur):-
Dr. Evatt has completed his visit to Japan and has sailed for home. It
has been a source of pleasure and satisfaction to everyone to have had him.
here. He has represented your country with skill and distinction and has
added to its national prestige. He has been of marked assistance with regard
to occupation problems and has made a distinct contribution to the furthering
of a treaty of peace. It is needless to add that he lias rendered more. vivid
the indissoluble ties of cordiality and friendship forged between our two
rountries during our ( commlon struggle in the Pacific. Thank you for perinitting
him. to comne."
On 12th August, 1947, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.
Evatt) said-
During my' visit to Japan-chiefly a fact-finding mission-I had
full and frank discussions abrnut the occupation and the problems that
will confront the Allies in writing the peace. I am satisfied that the
way is clear to the making of a peace settlement that will be a stable
foundation for the security of the Pacific.
" I had frequent discussions with the Supreme Commander, Allied
Powers ( General MacArthur), and with leading officials of the occupation,
diplomatic representatives of other Powers, ' and a few of the 
Japanese parliamentary and trades union leaders. Fromn these discussions
and personal observation I am able to ' appreciate still better
the undoubted achievements of an extremely difficult and complex
military occupation and administration. My consultations with
General MacArthur showed a broad agreement on . the steps to by
taken in preparing the treaty, on the principles that should be contained
in it, on the type of supervisory , machinery that should bi
established under it and on mnany of the other important matters with
which the settlemcent must deal.
" It has been most encouraging to find that all my discussions and
observations have amply confirmed the soundness of the policy that ' the
Australian Government has consistently advocated towards Japan. The
two great objectives are the security of Australia and other Allied
Powers from a resurgence of Japanese aggression, and a positive programme
for assisting Japan to develop gradually into a democratic
and peaceful member of the society of nations. Almost equally important
is the : metlhod of peace-making. The peace treaty should b:.
negotiated as soon as possible along democratic lines by all powers
that played I substantial part in the Pacific war. Because of her outstanding
war effort, Australia is clearly entitled to be a party prinlpal
to the settliement, and that : i now universally recognized.
The military occupation has new almost accomplished its primary
task, which w. as ie complete physical disarniamneut and deiiilitarizution
of Japan. It has taken imlportant initial steps towards th.
democratic reconstruction of Japnii, for example through the -adoption
by the Japanese people of a inew constitution and the encouragement
of trades unions. The peace. treaty could and should contain provisions
destined to . ecure. the accomplishment of the long-term objeetives-
to prevent any re-growthl of a vw. rr potential and to stial'uato
and consolidate the growth of democracy in Japan. These problems
will form the subject of discussions between members of the British
Commonwealth on 26th August, 1947. That beginning will be followed
by ai conference of all the Powers that took a substantial roll.
in achieving victory in the Pacific war.
I was greatly impressed by the bearing and behaviour of the
Australian servicemen and the re'st of the B. C. O. F. in Japan. They
have greatly assisted in the success of tin occupation and have demonstrated
to Japan and the world at large Australia's major interest in
the Pacific. The co-operation between the B. C. O. F. and the United
States forces has strengthened an association and comradeship that did
-o much for Australia during the crisis in the Pacific war."
JAPAN--ADVISORY COMMITTEE.
On 12th August, 1947, the Advisory Committee on Japanese Settlement
had its first meeting. Members of the committee , are-
Sir Frederic Eggleston, chairman, the Solicitor-General ( Professor K. ' 1.

JAPAN-BRITTSH COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE.
On 16th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
The Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt) advised Cabinet
to-day that representatives of Britain, Canada, South Africa, New
Zealand, India, Pakistan, Burma and Australia would meet at Canlierra
on 26th August, 1947, to discuss the question of a peace
; ettlement with Japan. The provisional agenda of the conference will
loe procedural questions; basic objectives; control or supervision of
Japan; territorial provisions; disarmament and demilitarization;
political provisions; economic and financial provisions; and reparations.
" The general policy in relation to Japanese settlement may be
summarized as follows:-
There should be no delay in going ahead with the Japanese I'Paice Conference.
In the absence of a peace settlement there will be increasing tendencies for
iajor matters of permanent imlport. inc to be dealt with on a piecemejal basis or
to be postponed.
Auistrnliln'aw \\ a eltort entitled lier t-be rI: tog nized as n party principal in
the peace settlement Australia lhis ealted this position by her war effort
which, inl Celcr. ial MacArtlur's words. contributed inlcaslulrably towards
I'acific victory.
Australia accepts the democratic principle that despite their varying con-
Iributions to the common victory all nations which played any substantial
a:.; rt in the Pacific war should he represented at the peace conference.
The voting procedure suggeste l by the United States ( that is, two-third
irajority) is just and democratic and any attempt to apply the veto system
would be unjust and must be resisted.
The peace settlement for Japan need not be a long drawn out affair, but
iuld be completed early in 1048. Indeed its fundamentals have already been
:; ccepted in the basic policy formulated in the Far Eastern Advisory Commission
; nd later confirmed in substance by the present Far Eastern Commission which
was a development of the broad principles of the Potsdam declaration. The
f: oundlations of the peace have also been laid through the constructive pioneer
work already pierformed in Japan by General MacArthur, as a result of which
military disarumaient is now practically completed.
The basic policy of the Far Eastern Commission prescribed certain measures
which were the physical disarmament of Japan. the removal of militarist and
I'a: scist elements, the trial and punishment of war crimes and the destruction
Japan'. capacity to wage war.
The basic policy of the Far Eastern Commission also laid emphasis upon the
i-sitive tasks of building a peaceful and democratic Japan. This called for
reform of the social, political and economic life of Japan. For example, trade
unions should be actively encourigel antd the educational ystcm liberalized.
These positive tasks are necessarily lone-term in character.
SThe settlement niust take account of South and East Asia and the Pacific
t whole. A peace should be established in accordance with the objectives
-f the United Nations Charter-a peace which should give security from future
;., gression and at the same time help to raise the standards of living of all
the peoples of South and East Asia and the Pacific. The gradual economic
development of Japan should be part of a general plan for the economic betterment
of East and South-East Asia and the Pacific as a whole. It would be
injust if her population obtained privileges and benefits denied to the countries
which she has devastated. 
In order to achieve these objectives, an Allied supervisory authority should
be established in the treaty of peace in order to consolidate the important
gains already made and ensure a bona fide observance of the treaty provisions
and especially to prevent any re-establislhment of a war potential. In addition,
the supervisory authority should have as one of its functions, the co-ordination
of the Japanese economy with those of the Pacific and East Asiatic regions.
The futitre of . Japan depends first upon the determination of the Allied
Power to pursue vigorously the objectives laid down by the Far Eastern Commission.
and secondly upon the energy, sincerity and co-operation of the
Japanese themselves in carrying out the great reforms already planned.
The peace treaty should therefore lie not vindictive but just and firm.
Australia desires to achieve hy demnocratic procedures of peace-making a
stable and lasting peace in the Pacific based on security from aggression and
the welfare of all Pacific peoples. This great objective will be assisted if tihe
peace conference is expedited, thereby furnishing an example of Allied co-operation
which should also assist in the final European settlement.
Cabinet expressed satisfaction with the progress made in connexion
with the Japanese peace settlement, as a result of Dr. Evatt's
recent mission to Japan and gave approval to the general principles and
purposes to be followed and the democratic procedures proposed for
the peace settlement
JAPAN-BRITISH COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE.
On 26th August, 1947, the British Commonwealth conference met
at Canberra. The following communiqu6s were issued:-
August 26th: Discussions at the conference are of a pirovisionl icharacter
and are for the ipurpose of exchanging views between ' the nations represented.

9. Form of peace settlement ( one instrument or two; participation of

August 26th: At the short afternoon session, there was . a general exchange
of views on Peace Conference procedure including the system of voting. In
the course of the discussion on the latter subject, views were expressed on the
United States proposal that decision at the Peace Conference shlioul he by a
two-thirds majority.
The consensus of opinion was that the first meeting of the I'racte Conference
should he held as soon as possible. It was also the general understaniding that
the initial conference should be on a Governmental or policy making level.
August 27th: To-day's sessions were devoted to an examination of the basic
objectives of the settlement and the territorial provisions that should he incorporated
in the peace treaty. Consideration of these problems was simplified by
the existence of the statements made at Cairo, Yalta and Potsdam. Allied agreement
on fundamental principles had also been reached on the basic policy and
other policy decisions of the Far Eastern Commission.
An examination of these documents shows that there will be no complicated
frontiers to define in the Japanese Peace Treaty since Japanese territories are all
insular. The Potsdam Declaration states specifically the ' Japanese sovereignty 
shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such
minor islands as we determine It will be for the Peace Conference to decide
which of the minor islands shall remain under Japanese sovereignty.
Against this background, the delegations exchanged views on certain strategic
aspects of the changes proposed and on its effect on the economy of Japan and
heard statements from the commander-in-chief of the British Commonwealth
Occupation Force ( Lieutenant-General H. C. H. Robertson), the Assistant Undersecretary
in the British Foreign Office ( Mr. M. O. Denning), the head of the
Canadian diplomatic mission in Tokyo ( Dr. E. H. Norman) and the Australian
representative on the Far Eastern Commission ( Major J. Plimioll) on the military,
social, political and economic development of Japan under the occupation
and on the prospects for the post occupation period. Stress was laid on the great
contributions these territorial changes will make towards preventing a recurrence
of Japanese aggression, as they will deprive Japan of vital military, naval and air
bases and control of certain essential raw materials
August 28th: The discussion of the disarmament and demilitarization of
Japan was completed. Delegates expressed the view that Japan should remain
completely disarmed and demilitarized, that all armaient manufacture should
he forbidden. and that internal order should be maintained by a non-military
police force.
Conferenct exaimined in detail measures that might be necessary to ensure
that the Japanese should not be permitted at present to conduct research in the
field of atomic energy or to develop or use atomic energy.
Complete prohibition of the building of any kind of naval vessels, as decided
on by the Far Eastern Commission, and the limitations that should be imposed
on the operation of Japanese commercial shipping confined to insular trade were
discussed. Views were also exchanged on the question of the control to be exercised
over the future of civil aviation in Japan. It was felt that manufacture
of aircraft should be completely prohibited in Japan.
Conference has devoted a great deal of time to the subjects of the disarmament
and demilitarization of Japan because of their extreme importance in
securing a stable peace in the Pacific.
Conference considered the principles of the political provisions that should be
incorporated in the Peace Treaty. It paid particular attention to the present
Japanese Constitution which carried out many of the principles which the Allied
Powers would like to see permanently in effect in Japan such as the guarantee of
fundamental human rights.
Among other subjects dealt with was the exclusion from public . office of
persons who had been removed because of their ultra-nationalistic and
militaristic affiliations, and Conference considered ways and means of continuing
to exclude those who remained undesirable.
Other subjects discussed were the Japanese Public Service, education, ultranationalistic
societies, special police and para-military organizations. These
subjects are already dealt with to some extent in the Potsdam Declaration and in
the Basic Policy and other Policy Decisions of the Far Eastern Commission, and
discussion of these subjects was, therefore, facilitated by the consideration
already given to them and by the wide area of agreement that had already been
achieved on these subjects among the eleven members of the Far Eastern
Commission. Conference took note of the steps taken by the Supreme Commander and the
Japanese Government to dissociate Shinto from the Japanese State. It was
evident that the pre-war system of providing State subsidies for Shinto shrines,
clergy, and organizations should not be resumed after the Treaty.
Conference considered matters relating to treaties between Japan and other
nations and the precedents set in the treaties with Italy and the satellite powers
were carefully examined. In this connexion, Conference considered the question
of the admission of Japan to the United Nations and the International Court
and to such bodies as the Food and Agricultural Organization and the International
Labour Office.
It was suggested that Japan should renounce all rights and interests both
public and private located outside Japan and that these would be expropriated
by local administrations.
Conference devoted attention to means by which Japanese who had
co-operated with the occupation authorities would be given full protection against
victimization after the Allied Forces were withdrawn. It seemed obvious that

On 2nd September, 1947, Dr. Evatt said
" We can look back on the week's work with great satisfaction.
We have all worked together towards the attainment of our common
aim, the establishment of a just and lasting peace in East Asia and
the Pacific. It has been a great pleasure to preside over the first
conference to include a new India, a new Dominion of Pakistan, and
Burma. These states share the desire of all of us for freedom and
democracy, and in their great tasks they will have the full support of
all other members of the British Commonwealth.
" We came here as separate sovereign states to exchange views in
order to understand more clearly one another's policies, rather than to
commit ourselves to a specific solution to a great problem. But more
important than mere formal agreements is the spirit which animates
us all. We want a settlement that will be the basis for a stable peace
in the Pacific, free from the threat of Japanese aggression. We want
to encourage democracy in Japan. We do not desire to prejudice
future peace by yielding to mere resentment and vindictiveness. The
restrictions we desire to impose on Japan and its economy are those
necessary in. the interest of security. In curbing effectively and permanently
Japanese ability to wage war, we must at the same time leave
her an outlet for peaceful development. But at the same time we have
taken account of the difficulties of the peoples who suffered at Japanese.
hands. The future of Japan is nlot an isohttc. d probem but onev wicli must
be approached in relation to its neighbouring States : nd to the world
as a whole. The solution can lie in a comprehensive international
effort to raise standards of welfare throughout the whole of Southern
and Eastern Asia and the Pacific. Japan must contribute her utmost
towards raising those standards; and if she does so she will share in
the improvement. Australia does not want Japan to become a starvation
area in the Far East, nor does Australia want the Far East to be
a starvation area in the rest of the world. In making the peace settlement,
we should not devote our attention exclusively to the defeated
nation. That is the basis for a realistic and, bholiev-., a statesima. alike
peace. I believe that these views are shared by the United States, whose
vast war effort contributed so much to winning the Pacific war, and
by General MacArthur, under whose leadership the threat of Japanese
invasion was flung back from Australia and the occupation of Japan
successfully undertaken.
The great desire of the peoples of the whole world to-day is peace.
To-day there is neither war nor peace. Our efforts to establish a better
international order, based on the United Nations, will be held back if we
do not speedily make peace and conclude settlements which will form
the basis for world recovery and development. The peoples of the
British Commonwealth . and their Governments here represented are
striving to bring about an early settlement with Japan based on justice
and achieved by democratic methods."

SHIPBUILDING.
DE-REQUISITIONING-OPERATION.
On 7th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
General de-requisitioning of vessels now controlled . by the Commonwealth
Government through . the Australian Shipping Board under
the administrative direction of the Minister for Shipping ( Sennator
Ashley) by power. s conferred upon National Security ( Shipping Coordination)
Regulations will commence on 18th August. 1947. from
which-date also increases in freight rates of Imany cirgi itrmnis
will become operative. With some few exceptions, ships will be derequisitioned
as they conic into position for re-delivery to owners. The
exceptions will, for the present, include some intrastate shipping in
respect to which negotiations are continuing.
After the outbreak of war, a number of Australian passenger and
other vessels were taken by the Government for : the direct use of the
armed services, and the bulk of the remainder of the Australian Mercantile
marine was requisitioned in 1941 under National Security ( Shipping
Control) Regulations. The Shipping Control Board, appointed under
the regulations, succeeded later by the Australian Shipping Board,
was given wide powers to direct the trade in which the requisitioned
vessels would engage, and to govern the rates of freight chargeable.
In 1943, it was decided that close collaboration was essential with
the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner in relation to freight rates
and the shipping regulations were amended. With minor exceptions,
the freight rates prevailing on 12th April, 1943, have remained
unchanged. ". Since 1943 there have been heavy increases in costs under any
headings and the Commonwealth Government, as part of its general
plans for price stabilization, has met the difference between the
revenues received and costs incurred in the chartering and operating of
the requisitioned vessels. A review has been made to ascertain the
extent to which the revenue from freights will require to be increased
to enable shipowners to operate their vessels at a reasonable profit 
level on the requisitioned vessels being released from control under
National Security ( Shipping Co-ordina. tion) Regulations-and it is
apparent that substantial freight increases are inevitable.
The Government has decided to permit increases on a. large number
of cargo lines . and to continue for the present a governmental subsidy
on freights in respect to certain other goods. The freight increases,
whether to be met by shippers directly or by the Government as
subsidy, are very considerable. The extent of the increases-about
Å“ 2,000,000 a year-cannot be stated in the foium of a percentage on the
1939 rates or on the 1943 rates as they cover many different lines and
vary with different trades.
The schedule has been carefully worked out by government officers
and shipowners in collaboration and the Government is satisfied that
the additional rates approved and necessary to enable shipowers to
pay their way and earn a reasonable profit on their coastal shipping
operations. Owners have shown no anxiety to increase freights unnecessarily
but are conscious of the competition, actual . and potential, from
other forms of transport, and of the fact that costs cannot rise steeply
without danger to their industry. Details of the approved increases
and of the cargo items eligible for freight subsidy will be published.
" CSpecific increases which the Government will subsidize for the
present include coal and sugar. Other items eligible, under certain
approved conditions, for Government subsidy are breakfast foods,
dried and processed fruit, invalid and infants' food, milk products, stock
foods, textile and clothing ( excluding floor coverings and furnishings)
and timber. These items are illustrations and the commodities named
are subject to precise definitions.
The Government will not subsidize limestone, barley, produce,
steel products or general cargo not specifically provided for. The
cargo items eligible for subsidy have been selected in relation to the
Government's overall economic policy.
The Government i. s giving no undertaking as to how long it will
continue to contribute to the shipping freight costs of goods now designated
as eligible for subsidy under approved conditions. The Government
will also keep under review the general level of shipping
freight rates with a view to revision if it should become apparent, after
a reasonable period of experience, that this is necessary in the
interests of shippers, shipping operators, or the national economy.
" In common with every other country, Australia suffered from
tonnage shortages during the war -and since. The Australian coastal
fleet has been augmented during the war by Australian-built ships and
by tonnage chartered from Britain and other countries. It is still
necessary to retain on charter a considerable number of British vessels,
mostly engaged in the coal and bulk iron ore trades, and the local
shipbuilding programme is continuing. 
16
" Ships under the direction of the Australian Shipping Board
including the requisitioned ship. s, have been operated as if they were
, ne fleet. Traffic committees, on which government officers and represcntatives
of the shipping companies met, considered total shipping
resources in relation to cargo accumulations and the necessity for
according priorities to most needed goods. A principal objective is
to get full loads for ships and the necessity to use vessels to their
utmost capacity naturally makes it extremely difficult to arrange for
regular services and this movement will doubtless continue. Before
deciding to de-requisition, coastal vessels, the Government has sought
iissurances from shipowners that co-ordinated direction of traffic will
continue while the necessity remained. Owners have volunteered full
co-operative and assistance and a committee representative of owners
and of the Comnmonwealt. h Directorate of Shipping will continue the
overall direction of . hip. in relation to the country's needs.
" I pay tribute to the assistance received during the war years, and
later, frcom the British Government. Australia contributed its resource.
without reserve to the common pool and had been supported generously
by the British Governent. Valued assistance at emergency
periods had been given by thre United States War Shipping Administration.
T can speak highly of the expert and willing assistance given
to the Commonwealth Government by the Australian shipping cormpanies."

NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES.
POLICY-MEDIATION.
On 7th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) saidrefer
to reports of an American offer to mediate in the Dutch-
Indonesian dispute.
The decision of the -Security Council was that the two parties
should cease hostilities and then submit to arbitration or other peaceful
means of settling the dispute. When that decision was taken by the 
Security Council, it was interpreted by the Australian Government as
meaning that the two parties would submit their case to an arbitrator
who would give a decision which would be binding on the two parties,
the arbitrator acting as an agent for the Security Council. Consequently,
any offer merely of good offices does not adequately meet the
situation. Reports are current that Republican authorities do not find mediation
acceptable, nor do they find the good offices of only one country
acceptable. While it is understood that the Netherlands Government
had accepted the American offer, it must be accepted by both parties
before negotiations can commence. It might be recalled that previously
the Indonesians accepted the good offices of Britain, the United States,
and Australia, which were put forward separately, but thise, at that
time, were not acceptable to the Netherlands authorities.
The present situation is full of dangers as, while there i. a truce,
there is no negotiation or contact between the two parties, and incidents
are likely to occur each day which might make negotiatin. more difficult.
The period between the cessation of hostilities and the cnommnencement
of negotiations should be as short as possible.
" If both parties consider it would help to terminate this interim
period and to commence negotiations immediately, the Australian
Government, for its part, will be prepared to act jointly with -the
United States Government in a capacity of mediator and arbitrator.
This offer is made in the spirit in which the Australian Government
raised the matter in the Security Council-that is in a spirit of impartially
and with only one desire, to see, as soon as possible, a peaceful
settlement of the prolonged dispute in the Netherlands East Indies

CIVIL AVIATION.
I. C. A. O.-REGULATIONS.
On 8th August, 1947, the Minister fbr Civil Aviation ( Mr. Drakeford)
announced that Australian air navigation regulations had been
revised to bring them into line with the Chicago Convention, and to
give effect to reconmmendations and decisions of the International Civil
Aviation Organization created under that convention. The new regulations
came into force on 10th August, 1947.
SOUTH PACIFIC AIR TRANSPORT COUNCIL-SECOND
MEETING.
On 14th August, 1947, Mr. Drakeford said that the second meeting
of the South Pacific Air Transport Council, which had concluded that
day, had had as its chief task the policy for the conduct of British
Commonwealth Air Services in the Pacific area and consideration of
the reports of British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines and Tasman
Empire Airways Ltd. The Council had agreed to the composition and 
functions of the Trans-Pacific Committee and the Trans-Tasman Cormittee
and had drawn up directives which would govern Tasman Empire
Airways and British Commonwealth Pacific Airways in the
operation of their services. It was agreed that the companies should
be left the greatest initiative in the day-to-day management of their
affairs in line with the Government's over-riding interest in matters of
major policy and finance.
The meeting agreed that British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines
Ltd. would begin its operations of the Trans-Pacific service early in
1948 with the Skymaster aircraft already being operated on its ' behalf
by Australian National Airways over the route. Arrangements were
being made for orders to be placed for four Solent flying boats for
Tasman Empire Airways.
Council reviewed the fare on the air service between New Zealandand
Australia and agreed that certain reductions should be made.
Council received a report from the Australian delegation regarding
the operation of regional services from Australia in the area to Fiji
and West 1700 E. Regional services operated by New Zealand were
still in the hands of the Royal New Zealand Air Force ' but it was
expected that by 1st October, 1947, those services would be taken over
by New Zealand National Airways Corporation.
The rival claims of Nadi and Nausori as Fiji's international airport
had proved a problem. A commission of the interested governments
had been appointed to investigate the matter in Fiji in February,
1948.

INTERNAL ROUTES-INTRA-STATE SERVICES, PREMIERS
DISCUSS.
On 21st August, 1947, the conference of Commonwealth and State
Ministers considered a submission by the Minister for Civil Aviation
( Mr. Drakeford) requesting the State to consider afresh the question
of expressly authorizing the Commonwealth instrumentality to engage
in intra-state aviation on a permanent basis and asked those States
that were unwilling to transfer full powers to authorize Commonwealth
airlines to operate intra-state services under the same conditions
as private operators. The Premiers explained the position in
their respective States, but no agreement was reached on the proposal.
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS, 1946-47.
On 28th August, 1947, Mr. Drakeford said that in 1946-47 Australian
airlines did record business.
Passengers increased by almost 70 per cent. on 1945-46, while
freight carried increased by 145 per cent. On internal air transport
services 860,111 passengers were carried, nearly nine times the 1938-39
total of 99,511. Total weight of freight carried was 12,247 tons, comnared
with 693 tons in 1938-39. 
BRITISII1-AUSTRALIA SERVICE---QANTAS, AGREEMENT.
DIRECTORS.
On 5th September, 1947, Mr. Drakeford announced that Messrs.
A. R. McComb and D. MceVey had been appointed members of the
board of directors of Qantas Empire Airways Ltd.
( For earlier references, please see No. 128, page 26.)
WAR CASUALTIES.
ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE.
On 11th August, 1947, the Minister for Air ( Mr. Drakeford) said
that the latest Royal Australian Air Force casualty list, containing the
. names of seven personnel formerly reported missing and now presumed
dead, would be one of the last of its kind. Only sixteen more cases of
missing remained to be cleared up.
PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.
DAIRY INDUSTRY-MILK, STATES CONTROL.
On 12th August, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" I have communicated with the State Premiers asking them t,
resume control of mnilk prices from 1st October, 1947.
" In October, 1945, the Commonwealth provided producers with ; i
guarantee of subsidy and prices. This afforded a stability to producers'
returns during a difficult transitional period in. the industry
and prevented increases in retail prices. In addition, special paymentls
hlave been made to producers who experienced adverse seasonal conditions
at various times. The total cost of maintaining stable retail prices
in the last two years approximated Å“ 4,500,000.
The sudden reineval of a subsidy of this niagnititlde ight cause al
appreciable increase in the price of milk, which would be undesirabl
not only because of the effect on the cost of living but also because it
might reduce consumption of ai highly nutritional food. The Government
has decided to continue a modified subsidy scheme to be operated
by the States. The amount of subsidy available will be calculated at
-4d. a gallon on milk consumed in metropolitan arias during the six offseason
months of the year, and in country areas now receiving subsidy
at two-thirds of present rates ( excluding drought relief). Present
subsidy rate; vary considerably according to State locality and period
of the year, but the new scheme represents overall a subsidy of about
two-thirds of the old scale.
" The States will not be required to distribute the subsidy on any
particular basis but can choose their own methods. The -only conditions
are that the subsidy will be used for the benefit of consumers
of whole milk and that a satisfactory control of prices operate in area'
receiving the benefit of subsidy. The arrangement will operate for
twelve months. 
in all State.-, except Tasmania. milk buards have been established
with authority to control the supply, distribution and price of milk
in metropolitan areas. The action now taken will restore to those
authorities their previous powers, and give the States an appreciable
subsidy to cushion the effect of any price rises that may be necessary
; s a result of the transition from Commonwealth to State control. As
the amount of subsidy will be less than formerly, some price increases
nay be necessary but the extent and duration of any price increases
will depend on the method by which the subsidy is used by the States.
The change-over has been timed to coincide with the ' flush' season
in most States. v. hen siubs-idy payments are usually at the lowest
levels." ( For earlier references, please see No. 111, page 8; No. 123, page 4.)
DAIRY INDUSTRY-CREAM CONTROL, RE-IMPOSITION.
On 14th August, 1947, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)
announced that a new Cream ( Disposal and UTTe) Order vould operate
o( n 1st September, 1947.
Under the new order, cream might be used only for the manufacture
of butter and cheese at a registered or licensed dairy factory, at the
farm where the cream was produced or under the authority of and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of a permit. The use of
cream for pastry cook and similar purposes would cease. Hospitals
and like institutions and manufacturers of ice-cream should apply for
a permit to obtain cream. Issue of permits to sick persons would be
confined to persons suffering from duodenal or peptic ulcer, ulcerative
colitis, or typhoid fever or other prolonged fevers, or active pulmonary
tuberculosis. The Commonwealth Government had in mind an extra 3,000 to
5,000 tons of butter for shipment to Britain and a quick survey of the
quantities of cream being sold for use as such indicated that that
quantity would be available if the public co-operated and did not seek
ways and means of circumventing the restriction on the disposal and
use of cream. ( For earlier references, please see No. 120, page
POULTRY INDUSTRY-EGG CONTROL.
On 15th August, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
" Extension of the period of Commonwealth control over eggs
to 31st December, 1947, was approved in May, 1947, to facilitate the
formation of an Australian-wide Egg Marketing Organization.
" The Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard) reported to Cabinet
to-day on recent discussions of the Australian Agricultural Council.
Cabinet approved the distribution of surplus funds resulting from the
operations of the Commonwealth Egg Control scheme up to 30th June,
1947, to the States, in the ratio in which egg producers in the various
States have contributed them, for the purpose of investment in the
proposed Aus. tralian Egg Equalization Committee Ltd. to provide the 
margin of security necessary to finance the scheme; in the event of no
Australian-wide company being formed the distribution of these funds
to be further considered; and providing the respective State Egg
Marketing Board with some working capital and subject to a careful
review of the financial position the sum of Å“ 100,000 is named for this
purpose. Cabinet also approved the transfer of any profit made by the
Controller of Egg Supplies during the period 1st July-31st December,
1947, to such authority ( Australian Egg Equalization Committee Ltd.)
or authorities ( State Egg Boards) which have the responsibility for
the marketing of Australian egg production subject to such funds being
utilized for the maintenance of egg prices between January and June,
1948. If the transfer is to be made to State Egg Boards the funds are
to be allocated on the basis of production for the period 1st July-31st
December, 1947.
Cabinet also approved of the preparation of a bill to be submitted
to the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party to establish an Australian
Egg Board with powers to control exports, to buy and sell eggs and
to ensure that the long term contract with the British Government is
observed." ( For earlier references, please see No. 116, page 6.)
POWER ALCOHOL DISTILLERIES.
On 16th August, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
Cabinet to-day considered a report by the Cabinet sub-committee
on secondary industries on negotiations between the Commonwealth
Government and the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd. concerning
grain alcohol distilleries.
Cabinet approved of an agreement with the Colonial Sugar
Refining Co. Ltd. for the purchase of certain plant at Cowra, New
South Wales, and Warracknabeal, Victoria.
" Cabinet authorized the Secondary Industries Commission to
arrange for the utilization by industry of land, buildings and remaining
plant and equipment at the Cowra; Warracknabeal; Wallaroo, South
Australia; and Collie, Western Australia, distilleries through the Commonwealth
Disposals Commission, the Contract Board and the
Department of the Interior.
EXPORTS TO BRITAIN-POULTRY.
On 19th August, 1947, Mr. Pollard said-
Australia will export Å“ A. 1,000,000' s worth of frozen poultry to
Britain in 1947. In the first seven months of 1947 the entire 1946
figure has been more than doubled, with 1,455 tons of -boiler fowls,
587 tons of chickens, 446 tons of turkeys, 104 tons of ducks, totalling
2,592 tons valued at Å“ A. 673,305. Allowing for the seasonal drop in
the next three months, the estimate for the twelve months is 4,000
tons." 
CANNED FRUITS.
On 25th August, 1947, Mr. Pollard said-
" About 1,000,000 cases of canned fruits have been shipped by the
Australian Canned Fruits Board to Britain from the 1946-47 pack,
leaving 500,000 cases yet to be shipped. Australia had set aside the
maximum quota of canned fruits for Britain during the current year.
From the 1945-46 pack, shipments to the Ministry of Food were 977,300
cases." GIFTS.
On 26th August, 1947, the Postmaster-General ( Senator Cameron)
said that food parcels which proved to be undeliverable in Britain were
shipped back to Australia and returned to the senders. It had been
agreed with the British Post Office that, in regard to future postings
of gift parcels containing only foodstuffs or soap, those which proved
to be undelivera'ble would be treated as abandoned parcels and the
contents distributed to the best advantage.
TALLOW.
On 29th August, 1947, Mr. Pollard said-
Approval has been given for the export to Britain of 250 tons of
edible beef tallow and 250 tons of edible mutton tallow. This is in
addition to shipments of oleo sterine, an edible fat, obtained in the
manufacture of industrial margarine, which has been exported freely
to Britain." RABBIT SKINS.
On 22nd August, 1947, Mr. Pollard said that rabbit skin exports
in 1946-47 were approximately three times greater in weight and
fourteen times greater in value than in 1938-39. Exports of rabbit
careases in 1947 would exceed pre-war figures.
CANNED MEAT.
On 25th August, 1947, Mr. Pollard said that nearly 40,000 tons of
canned meat would be exported during 1947. The total included 25,000
tons under contract to the British Ministry of Food, 1,500 tons supplied
to the Red Cross and other relief organizations, 1,300 tons likely to be
required for iil. rnuational relief, and 1,059 tons required for service use.
leaving an estimated 11,000 tons for private export. The figures did
not include canned meat sent in gift parcels to Britain, estimated at
1,000 tons. The overall ceiling permitted by the Rationing Commission
for canned meat production for 1947 was about 48,000 tons. The
quantity left for local trade would be about 10,000 tons. Pre-war
production of canned meat in Australia had never reached a third of
the 1947 estimated total.

SUGAR AGREEMENT, REVISION.
On 4th September, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
The Commonwealth Government has agreed in principle to the
request recently made by the sugar industry for a variation in the
Sugar Agreement to enable the wholesale price of sugar to be increased
by Å“ 4 2s. 8d. a ton ( id. per lb. retail).
" I have consulted with the Premier of Queensland ( Mr. Hanlon)
regarding the matter and we agreed to recommend to the respective
Parliamentary Labour Parties that legislation be introduced for this
purpose. " The retail price of sugar in Australia has existed at 4d. a 1b.
, apital cities since 1933, despite greatly increased costs of production
in recent years. The increase in price will enable these increased costs
to be met and will assist in rehabilitating the industry whose pro-
, luction has fallen to low levels and whose capital equipment has greatly
depreciated during the war.
The increase in the wholesale price of sugar will allow retailers
in additional 10s. 8d. a ton and wholesalers an additional Is. Sd. a ton
profit. The increase in price will not take place until the Sugar Agreement
has been signed between the two Governments and the Commonwealth
Parliament has passed an amending Sugar Agreement Act.
" The temporary shipping freight subsidy on sugar will be with-
Irawn when the increased price come into operation.
There are other aspects concerning which I will have to consult
with Mr. Hanlon before the revised agreement is finalized."

HOUSING.
COMMONWEALTH-STATES AGREEMENT-COSTS AND
STANDARDS.
On 13th August, 1947, the Minister for Housing ( Mr. Lommon)
released details of the report on State housing authority standards and
methods prepared by the Deputy Director of Housing ( Mr. L. P. D.
O'Connor), who undertook the investigation as a result of a decision by
the Premiers Conference that an official should confer with each State
to ascertain whether helpful suggestions of mutual benefit could be
made to reduce costs of dwellings erected under the Commonwealth-
States Housing Agreement. Mr. O'Connor had found that the main
reasons for the present increased costs of Government sponsored housing
iver pre-war were-
Shortages of building materials, increased labour, increased costs of material!.
reduced productivity of labour, time taken to complete dwellings, greater overhead,
larger profits and lack of competition among contractor-s. 
Mr. O'Connor suggested a number of economies in the construction
practices of the States, the chief being-
Reduction ini number of plan types, use of brick-on-edge for the inner leai
' o external walls and for internal partitions, construction of brick veneer
dwellings, . reduction in size of timber structural meimbcrs and elimination ( r
front fences and side fences to building line.
Dealing with disparities between the States in building costs of
government-sponsored housing, Mr. O'Connor found that costs per
square for an 1,100 square feet single-brick dwelling given for June.
1947, by State housing authorities were-
Sydney, Å“ 140; Melbourne, Å“ 132; Brisbane, Å“ 131; Adelaide. Å“ 110; Perth.
Hobart, Å“ 112 ( timber-no brick dwellings being erected).
The value of suggested economies according to States ranged downwards
from Å“ 157 in regard to brick dwellings and from Å“ 112 downwards
in regard to timber. Economies suggested by the Commonwealth to
the States, if applied to the programme under the Commonwealth-
States Housing Agreement for 1947-48 would, it was estimated, represent
a saving of Å“ 1,400,000. The report stressed the need for constructing
houses in large estates and letting contracts where possiblb
for 500 houses at a time.
( For earlier references, please see No. 118, page 36; No. 122, page 28.)
COMMONWEALTH-STATES AGREEMENT-COSTS AND
STANDARDS, PREMIERS CONFERENCE DECISION.
On 21st August, 1947, the conference of Commonwealth and State
Ministers decided-
That conference notes that clause 4 of the Commonwealth and
* States Housing Agreement 1945 has been implemented by the adoption
of the standards agreed on at the February, 1947 conference of Comrmonwealth
and State officers.
Conference notes receipt of report on economies by Mr. L. P. D.
O'Connor and desires the matter reviewed in detail at the annual conference
of housing officers in January, 1948. Meantime, all States
undertake to carry out to the fullest extent practicable, the economies
uggested in that report." RECONSTRUCTION.
TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT-PREPARATORY
CONFERENCE, AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION.
On 13th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
My attention has been drawn to a number of sta. tenents on whar
the Australian Government has decided or may be expected to decide
in the course of its consideration of the trade negotiations now proceding
at Geneva. The position in regard to these negotiations is quite
fluid. They have not yet reached the stage where it is practicable
to assess the balance of possible trade benefits and concessions. 
The Cabinet sub-committee is keeping in constant touch with the
progress of the negotiations but in the circumstances has not yet formed
even a tentative view as to possible recommendations to the Government.
With regard to the negotiations with the United States, the Australian
delegation, ha. s, in view of the offer of a reduction in the wool
duty, been authorized to re-open negotiations. The Australian delegation
has also been asked to furnish further information regarding
the offers and responses on a number of other comnmodities. This has
not yet been received.
In the circinistuanes. any statements regarding the attitude of
the Government in respect of tariff offers and responses should be
treated with lcnrion. When possible the Government will make an
official annomi-o cement in the -matter."

GOVERNMENT'S PLANS-REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT,
SNOWY RIVER REPORT.
On 15th August, 1947, the Minister for Works ( Mr. Lemmon)
released a report on the diversion of Snowy River. Mr. Lemmon
said-Shortages of power exist in New South Wales and Victoria, and
there is a need to provide for the rapidly increasing demand brought
about by continuous industrial development. It could be met by exploiting
the full potentialities of the . Snowy River and the costless reservoir
, f snow which forms its source. If developed to its maximum, power
for Victorian and New South Wales requirements can be ensured for
many years to come, as well as furnishing water for an extension to
r-xisting irrigation systems. Diversion of black coal to other States for
general industrial purposes would then be possible.
Fu! l power development is possible only if the Snowy River is
diverted initially to the head waters of the Murray River, but the
report points out. that it would be possible, if considered -advisable, to
divert the water again from the lower Murray to the Murrumbidgee
Valley for irrigation purposes.
If this unique natural asset is developed to its fullest advantage,
300,000 acres of intensely irrigated land can be served from the Snowy
River, from which a gross annual return in the value of foodstuffs of
at least Å“ 10,000,000 a year could be expected and, in addition, ultimately
750.000 horse-power produced. If, on the other hand, the
waters be diverted direct to the Murrumbidgee River the same amount
of irrigation can be undertaken, but the power developed would be
at least 500,000 horse-power less. To make up this power about
1,300,000 tons of additional coal will have to be mined annually.
" From a commercial viewpoint the scheme would show profits of
8 per cent. after providing for working expenses and depreciation.
ThiÃ¸ would he the expected dividend return if the scheme were to be 
operated for profit, and would be a far higher yield than that shown
by similar schemes run by utility companies here and overseas.
" The estimated cost of the Murray River diversion scheme, which
includes a series of dams on the various tributary streams and on the
Snowy and Murrumbidgee Rivers, with a tunnel 30 miles long under
the Australian Alps to connect the Snowy with the Murray, and the
electricity generating stations and power lines to Melbourne and Sydney
with all equipment, may ultimately reach Å“ 65,000,000.
On 20th August, 1947, the conference of Commonwealth and State
Ministers decided-
That a committee be constituted, consisting of two representatives
from the Commonwealth and two each from the . States of New South
Wales and Victoria, with power to co-opt such other assistance as
may be needed from the three authorities, with a view to aaking a
complete detailed investigation, the committee to report to a Premiers
Conference as early as possible, but not later than twelve months hence."
" I hope that the States will, at least, agree to proceed inumediately
with the detailed investigation recommended. I feel that the report is
so conclusive that it may well be accepted as proving the general
feasibility and economy of the scheme, and that action may proceed
immediately towards the diversion of the Snowy River to the Murray
Valley, exploiting the waters to their maximum power capacity, without
affecting the possibility of using them either in the Murray or Murrumhidgee
Valleys to their fullest irrigation value."

NEW GUINEA.
WORKS MINISTER'S VISIT.
On 14th August, 1947, the Minister for Work.-: anl Illon-ing ( Mr.
Lemmon) announced that he would visit New Guine and Papua from
28th August, 1947, to 9th September, 1947, acconmpanied by the
Director-General of Works ( Mr. L. F. Loder). . lis ldepartment was
preparing a major works programme in the territories. Many larg.
works carried out by Allied forces during the war had been designed
to last only a few years. The Commonwealth Governmiint desired to
maintain a number of installations as future assets, having in mind
defence requirements and the development of the territories.
BRITAIN.
FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR IMPORTS.
On 15th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Clifley) said-
A close watch is being kept by the Australian Government on all
dollar imports, both United States and Canadian. The subject of
sterling balances at London is being kept continuously under review.
The problems facing Britain have been constantly discussed by
the British Chancellor of the Exchequer ( Dr. Dalton) and myself and
by Dr. Dalton and the other Dominion Treasurers for over twelve
months." 
FINANCIAL POLICY-CABINET DEC1. SONS.
On 15th August, 1947, Mr. Chifley said--
Cabinet to-night surveyed the economic position as it affects the:
United Kingdom and the position regarding dollar imports by Australia
and Australia's sterling balances at London.
Cabinet decided that there should be a severe rationing of thl:
use of dollars for travel purposes and directed that a review be. made
of dollar expenditure on tobacco, motion pictures, and all imports of
a less essential character and a re-examination of the newsprint
importations. Cabinet also decided that there should be an overall reduction
in petrol consumption to save 4,250,000 gallons a month. The reduction
will be applied to private users to effect a 20 per cent. to 25 per
r. ent. reduction in their ration, a reduction of 20 per cent. to 25 per
i: ent. in the ration of private business users, a 20 per cent. to 25 per
t: cnt. reduction in the ration for pleasure boats and a 10 per cent.
reduction in the ration for commercial users."
On 22nd August, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
Instructions have been issued to the Commonwealth Bank t,
impose severe restrictions on dollars advanced to all travellers.
The film industry has been asked to meet the Commonwealth
( overnment on 26th August, 1947.
I have been in communication with the newsprint pool authoritie
and on 25th August, 1947, I will have a full review of newsprint
imports fron the Customs Department.
" The Customs Department will present a full review of all dollar
imports to Australia, including tobacco.
" There is no need for the British Government to make any specific
requests for restrictions on dollar imports because the Australian
Government has always kept a reasonable check on the use of dollars.
This check will now be very severe."
On 2nd September, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
Following consideration -of the latest develupments in the dollar
crisis, Cabinet to-day decided on the following measures to reduce
Australia's dollar expenditure.
Motor Cha'sis.-A cut of the order of 20 per cent. is to be made
in the number of chassis approved for importation during 194S as
:' gainst the number approved for importation during 1947. The whole
of this cut will be applied in the field of passenger car chassis and no
reduction will be made in the chassis quotas for commercial vehicles.
The detailed application of the cut to the various types of passenger
car chassis is to be examined by an Inter'-departmental Committee on
which the trade will be represented. The most severe restrictions will be
imposed on chassis for cars in the higher price ranges with possible totnl
exclusion of certain makes.
Tobacco.-Import licences for American tobacco leaf are to Ix
rut by 20 per cent. It is hoped that the reduction in releases of manufactured
tobhcco and cigarettes will be limited to about 10 per cent. 
Petrol.-Cuts were announced following the meeting of Cabinet on
August, 1947, which were designed to achieve a saving of 10 to
12 per cent. in current consumption. No further cuts are contemplated
for the time being.
Newsprint.-A reduction of the order of 30 per cent. is to he mad',
in newsprint import programmes.
Textiles.-Except for a few lines which are still in acute short
supply, the issue of licences for the importation of textiles from dollar
sources was temporarily suspended at the end of May, 1947. Cabinet
decided that this policy should be continued for the time being pending
complction of a comprehensive review of the supply position by the
Rationing Commission.
Aircraft.-Apart from aircraft already on order, no further purrbases
of aircraft involving dollar expenditure will be authorized.
Expenditure of dollars on spare parts for aircraft will also le closely
supervised. Capital E'qipul i Me tad Ja-M. Ule-rials.-Machinery and other
items of capital equipment are regarded as being in the highest category
of priority and dollars will be made available to meet the essential
requirements of Australian industry. In view of the present dollar
crisis,: however, manufacturers will be expected to co-operate by
exploring fully the possibilities of obtaining machinery from other
-ources before they seek to import machinery involving dollar expenditure.
The present method of dealing with applications for licences
to import goods of this class is to be reviewed by an Inter-departmental
(' onimittee. The committee will also examine the principles to be
: dopted in dealing witl applications for licences to import raw materials
from dollar sources of supply.
Miscellhrncon Imports.-Aplart from the major items, Cabinet
endorsed recommniendations by the Minister for Customs ( Senator
( onrtice) for restrictions on a wide range of miscellaneous imports
from the dollar area in accordance with the general objective of reducing
. dollar expenditure on imports to the essential minimum.
Film Re. utlti:' s.-Consideration is being given to the bemt mean.
of reducing rlh dollar expenditure involved in remittances of film
royalties to the extent of about 30 per cent.
Travel EX: penditure.-Drastic restrictions wvill be imposed on the
ount of dollars made available for personal travel and the allowance
for businessmen will also be substantially reduced. As a corollary
. further restrictions will be imposed on travellers taking out jewellery
n. d other valuables as part of their personal effects.
Remittances by Visiting Entertainers, Artists. cond the like.-Up
to the present visiting entertainers and artists have been allowed to
remit their net earnings in Australia without restriction. It is no
longer possible to continue this policy and the Exchange Control
iauthorities have been instructed to take steps to limit severely the
. amount of. such remittances where dollars are involved." 
On 4th September, 1947, the Minister for Customs ( Senator
Courtice) announced the imposition of further restrictions on imports
of goods from dollar areas. In future, licences would not be granted
to import the following goods from countries in the dollar aarea:-
Axes, dictating machines, human hair clipping machines, electric household
ironing machines, clothes washing machines, computor mechanisms for use in
the manufacture of petrol pumps, electric stoves, oil or spirit heating and
pressure lamps, piece goods for dress or furnishing purposes, corsets, crown
seals, preparations for use in the manufacture of cordials, wooden blind rollers,
preparations for use in the manufacture of cosmetics, building boards, golf
club shafts, ice hockey-skates, lacrosse racquets, paper of the following types:-
carbon, cartridge, cellophane for wrapping tobacco manufactures, copying. cover
indp ressings, duplicating, gummed sheets and rolls, marble and foil, vegetable
parchment, roofing and sheathing, surface coated and box makcrs, fruit wrapping,
paper hangings and wall paper, paper for use in the manufacture of toilet
paper, carton and container boards, cigarette papers, fashion plates and books,
paper patterns except master patterns, fountain pens, rime rcnorders, rubber
gloves, rubber tyres and tubes, musical instruments and acces: orie. s fluorescent
lamp materials for use in advertising signs. plastic pliable sheeting, pliofilm,
home kinematographs, spectacles and spectacle frames, french chalks ; ind other
preparations of steatite.
In addition, imports of the following conmmodities ,. vould bhe amdmitted
in reduced quantities:-
Canned fish; radio receiving valves; recording instruments, pyrolneters and
thermometers; chicle; proprietary medicines and raw materials for the manufacture
of drugs and chemicals; miscellaneous manufactures of metal; hickory
axe and tool handles; rubber thread for the manufacture of golf balls; books of
all kinds; tissue paper for paper patterns: writing and printing paper;
artificial teeth; cameras; cartridges; photo flash lamps; unrefined fish oils.
The review of goods imported from dollar areas ww as b( in conltillued
and it might be necessary to impose restrictions on Iheim portation of
other commodities in the near future.
In regard to textiles, the present licensing treatment would 1b continued
and only imports of essential utility types of cotton piece goods
would be permitted. It had been decided to undertake a review of all
outstanding licences issued before 27th May, 1947, for the importation
of textiles from the United States, Canada and other dollar areas.
In addition, outstanding licences for imports from dollar : trceas of.
musical instruments and accessories, cigarette paprs indl elwtrii humnan

FINANCIAL POLICY-SALE OF GOLD.
On 5th September, 1947. Mr. Chifley said-
Australia has sold 150,000 ounces of gold to the United Kingdom.
" I recall that during the depression Australia had to part with
practically the whole of her gold reserves to enable her to meet her
overseas obligations. During recent years the Commonwealth Bank
commenced rebuilding a gold reserve by purchasing and holding current
production. The Government and the Commonwealth Bank would have liked
to continue the policy of gradually rebuilding Australia's gold reserve 
but the current dollar situation is so serious that it has been decided for
the time being to sell current gold production to the United Kingdom as
a special measure of assistance in her present difficulties

FINANCIAL POLICY-PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH.
On 20th August, 1947, Mr. Chifley said*-
We are living in a world that is in economic difficulties. I have
been very anxious about the general world economic position for some
years but the cituation lins deteriorated more rapidly than was expected.
I told you yesterday in some detail about the economic position of the
United Kingdom. We must not attempt to delude ourselves that, if
economic difficulties occur in Britain and perhaps eventually in the
United States, Australia will not be affected. That would be a sheer
and complete delusion. The position overseas to-day is that the United
States has been exporting, in terms of values, a vastly greater quantity
of goods than it has been importing. Britain made the Anglo-American
Loan Agreement, which bound it particularly in regard to the convertibility
of sterling balances, in the hope that the American loan money
would carry it on until 1950, by which time there would have been a
large measure of rehabilitation in Europe and the British export trade
would have been built up in hard currency countries as well as in
sterling countries.
A numiber of things have happened. First-a thing which I have
always feared-in a world of rising prices in which people believe that
some degree of inflation is desirable, the money that Britain borrowed
from the United States is not able to bring in the quantity of goods that
Britain expected. I think the British Prime Minister ( Mr. Attlee) said
that instead of getting 100 per cent. volume his country has been
receiving only 60 per cent. Associated with that fall in estimated
production have been certain internal factors in the shape of unforseeable
difficulties due to flood and cold.
The rehabilitation of Europe has not progressed as the world
hoped. In Europe to-day there is utter misery which must be unparalleled
in the history of the world. At present the most strenuous efforts
are being made to find some solution of this grave problem. It is
becoming more and more apparent that we cannot have a prosperous
Europe without a prosperous Germany, whatever our feelings in regard
to Germany might be. One result of this disastrous situation is that
the export market in Europe has not been restored because the countries
of Europe have not the money with which to pay for exports. The
dollar position has become more acute every day, particularly during
the last few weeks-indeed, during the last few days. One of the main
causes of this rapid deterioration in the situation is the problem of the
At n cllnfrociic of Comnnmonwenlth und State Ministers. 
convertibility of sterling, but there arc other factors with which I
do not propose to deal now. Because of the difficulty of converting
sterling currency some of the South American countries and certain
Scandinavian countries are experiencing grave difficulties.
The position of Britain, and to a lesser degree, the position of
Canada, in regard to the dollar position has also deteriorated very
considerably. I mention these matters to give you some idea of the
present world situation, and without violating any confidences repos.:: i
in me. Another factor to be considered is the large balances held in
Britain by a number of countries, including Australia. The Australian
balance is, of course, very small compared with those held by India.
Egypt and even by Ireland. I know that many of us would prefer
to live in a world of our own, but we cannot. My Government realizethat
this difficulty cannot be cured in a day, but it may be possible to
ameliorate the consequences of the developments.
One of the immediate effects on Australia will be a serious curtailnient
of imports, and that curtailment will apply not only to import
from dollar countries, including Canada, but also, to some degree, to
imports from sterling countries. However, if everyone plays the game.
and works the right way I believe that the economy of this country is
geared that it will be able to withstand the economic repercussions. Of
course, I emphasize that the serious developments I have outlined may
not eventuate, but we must realize that we shall probably have to go
without many of the imports we had hoped to receive. For that reason.
L wish ' to play safe' in the plans we are making for the immediate
future. 1 warn conference that shniold these developments eventuate
it will be absolutely impossible for us to continue as we have in the past.
" At the same time, I do not want anyone to go away with the
impression that I do not firmly believe in the future of Australia.
With prcper determination on the part of the governments and pttopli
of Australia, I am sanguine that there will be a vast expansion. r
may be altered for a while, but I have a deep-rooted confidence-shared
by industrialists and husiinessmen, nanv of whom a re not of myv
political faith-that Australia can obtain maxiimum production and

SAFETY AT SEA.
On 15tlI August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" In 1929, a conference on safety of life at sea was held at London
and Australia ratified the resulting convention after amending ' th!.
Navigation Act and regulations to conform to its provisions. The
British Government, in view of recent war experiences, proposes to h ld
a conference at London in 1948.
" Cabinet decided to-day to accept the invitation antd send a delegition
consisting of two technical officers from the Department of Shipiping
( one experienced in navigational problems and the other in marine 
engineering problems), and two advisers, one nominated by Aust ' ralian
shipowners and one nominated by the Australasian Council of Trade
Unions CANBERRA. HOUSING.
On 15th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" The Minister for the Interior ( Mr. Johnson) reported to Cabinet
to-dayv that a deputation had waited on him requesting an amendment
to the present policy of allocation of housing at Canberra to permit of
an allotment to persons not in Government employ. At present 1,445
person are registcred for tenancies of whom 710 are public servants, 42.5
are other Government employees, and 310 are persons not in Governmnent
employ. AXbout 325 new houses are at present under construction
and-the DepaFtment of Housing anticipates an acceleration of tho
present building programme, probably 100 houses in the next six
months, and ultimately reaching 300 to 500 h-ouses in a year.
Cabinet approved of the allotment of a quota of one in each ten
houses built in the twelve months from 1st September, 1947, to person
not in Government employ, the quota to be reviewed at the end of the
year. Fifty pcir cent, of the quota will be allotted to ex-servicemen"

TELE-COMMUNICATIONS-BROADCAST NEWS.
On 15th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" Cabinet decided. to-day that the Overseas Telecommunications
Commission be authorized to undertake the reception in Australia of
any overseas news broadcasts required by press agencies or other similar
bodies. A uniform flat rate will be applied for this service irrespective
( if whether the broadcasts emanate from a British Commonwealth or a
foreign country. When transmission from Australia of news broadcasts
on behalf of a press agency is required, the transmission will be effected
by the Commission on a uniform flat rate charge whether to a British
Commonwealth or-a foreign country"'.
COPYRIGHT.
MUSIC-PROPOSED LEGISLATION.
On 15th Auiguist, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Where copyright exists in a musical work, it is an infringement of
cop) yright to give a public performance of the work except under licence
from the owner of the copyright on terms agreed to by him.
5691.-2 
" The Australian Performing Right Association has recently notified
the Comnmonwealth Clothing Factory that, in respect of music
rebroadcast to employees while at work, an annual licence will in
future be required.
" Under an award in 1938, the Australian Broadcasting Commission
pays to A. P. IR. A. an annual sum of 6d. a listener's licence in respect
of music broadcast from the national stations. The Federation of
Commercial Broadcasting Stations pays to A. P. R. A. about the same
amount. In effect, A. P. R. A. receives from the Australian broadcasting
systems is. a listener's licence. This is greatly in excess of amounts paid
to corresponding bodies in Britain, Canada and New Zealand. Negotiations
to make a more satisfactory arrangement have been unsuccessful
and no provision exists whereby A. P. R. A. can be coompelled to submit
to arbitration the Copyright Act providing only for voluntary
arbitration. Cabinet decided to-day that a sub-committee comprising Dr. Evatt,
the Minister for Health ( Senator McKenna) and the Minister for
Information ( Mr. Calwell) consider an amendment of the Copyright
Act, for submission to the Federal Parliamentary Labour party, to provide
in principle for the fixing, by compulsory arbitration in default
of agreement of a single, all-Australian fee for the public performance
of copyright musical work." TRANSPORT.

Commissioner of Commonwealth Railways."
TRANSITION.
CONTROLS-FURTHER DILL PROPOSED.
On 15th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" The Defence ( Transitional Provisions) Act 1947 continues in
operation until 31st December, 1947, about 59 sets of regulations. 61
separate regulations in the General and Supplementary sets and
orders made under regulations now resealed, a total of 130. A preliminary
survey indicates that it will be poosible either to repeal or to
allow to elapse before the end of the year about one-third of each class.
However, it is probablc that all regulations of any significance in
force in 1947 will need to have their effect carried forward in 1948.
The general inflationary conditions present at the end of 1946 are not
likely to have changed by the end of 1947, and control over economnic
conditions generally will need to be continued. 
Cabinet to-day approved of the preparation of bills dealing with
dairy produce acquisition ( the setting up of an authority to deal with
dairy produce purchased under contract by Britain, patriotic funds,
enemy property, trading with the enemy and ship building.
Cabinet approved the preparation of a bill to amend the Defence
( Transitional Provisions) Act to provide for the repeal of as many
as possible of regulations and orders which present circumstances suggest
as unlikely to be required after the end of 1947 and to extend the
life of the Act to cover until the 31st December, 1948-unleas earlier
repealed-regulations and orders necessary to deal with the transition.

" I refer to reported falls in the market value of somne bank shares
to-day. These are entirely unwarranted, and shareholders -are entitled
to be warned against propaganda or other statements tending to depreciate
the value of their holdings.
The Government desires to make it clear that it does not advise
shareholders to sell, but in order to protect the interests of those shareholders
who nevertheless wish to sell, the Government has arranged
with the Commonwealth Bank to purchase any bank shares which
holders are desirous of selling. The purchase price will be not less than
that quoted on the Stock Exchange on Friday, 15th August, 1947."

least five years.
That a systematic reconnaissance of the coast of the Australian Antarctic
Territory be carried out over a number of years by the Wyatt Earp with a
view to establishing a permanent scientific station on the Antarctic Continent
itself. That a ship be obtained, of much greater capacity than the Wyatt Earp
and especially adapted for work in Antarctic conditions. The exact type of
vessel required cannot be determined until further information is available as
to the proposed lauding site."

areas and in general only essential goods not available in adequate
quantities from local or sterling sources of supply would be permitted.
CONVERSION LOAN.
AUSTRALIAN OPERATION-AUGUST, 1947.
On 25th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) announced
that a conversion loan would open on 28th August, 1947. Holders of
securities valued at Å“ 36,751,620 maturing on 15th September, 1947,
would be invited to exchange their securities for 3j per cent, bonds
or inscribed stock repayable in 1959. T * he Treasurer would reserve
the option of retiring the new securities in 1956. About 36,000
individuals hold the securities about to mature comprising about
Å“ E8,100,000 bearing interest at 31 per cent. and Å“ 28,600,000 at 4 per cent. 
MAN-POWER.
WOMEN WORKERS-MINISTER'S REQUESTS.
On 26th August, 1947, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway)
said that employers could provide greater opportunities for the parttime
employment of women. Many employers were operating schemes
for the part-time employment of women. Some schemes had been
introduced during the war and others more recently. It had sometimes
been found necessary to make internal adjustments to permit of the
working of short shifts or to earmark certain types of work for parttime
workers, but when those adjustments had been made a smoother
flow and greater production had resulted from the increased numbers
of workers. Women, not at present employed, should undertake part-time work.
The total number of women in employment as wage and salary earners,
excluding rural and household domestic workers, was about 620,000,
or only 20,000 -below the peak war-time level, when man-power controls
were operating. When account was taken of the greater numbers of
women now occupied as employers or self-employed persons, it was
very likely that the total number of women gainfully occupied was
nearly as great as it was at the peak of the war.
Decentralization of industry throughout suburban areas and the
country meant that opportunities for employment were very much more
handy to women living at home than previously. Arrangements could
often be made to make part-time employment fit in with household
and other commitments. JUDICIARY.
ARBITRATION COURT-APPOINTMENT.
On 27th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Judge R. C. Kirby, of the New South Wales District Court, has
been appointed a judge of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration
Court.
" When the Stevedoring Industry Act comes into operation, Mr.
Justice Kirby will become chairman of -the Stevedoring Industry
Commission NATIONAL DEBT.
NATIONAL DEBT COMMISSION-ANNUAL REPORT.
On 27th August, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
The National Debt Commission, which controls all sinking funds
for the redemption of Commonwealth and State debts, met at Canberra
to-day. The meeting was attended by the Chief Justice of the High
Court ( Sir John Latham), the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank
( Mr. H. T. Armitage), the acting Secretary to the Treasury ( Mr. G1. P.
N. Watt), the Solicitor-General ( Profesor K. H. Bailey), and the
representative of the States ( Mr. A. T. -Smithers), and myself as chairman.
The main business of the meeting was the presentation of the
annual report on the transactions for the year ended 30th June, 1947, 
and consideration of the application of sinking fund moneys accruing
during 1947-48. The receipts of the sinking fund for 1946-47 were
about Å“ 25,950,000. The annual report covering these transactions will
be presented to Parliament in due course.
" Receipts for 1947-48 are estimated at Å“ 26,873,000, being
Å“ 17,625,000 on account of the Commonwealth and Å“ 9,248,000 on account
of the States. Of the latter amount, Å“ 1,642,000 will be provided from
Commonwealth revenue. The total contributions estimated to be available
for the redemption of the debt of each . State are as follows:-
New South Wales Å“ 3,612,000, Victoria Å“ 1,837,000, Queensland Å“ 1,340,000,
South Australia Å“ 1,141,000, Western Australia Å“ 1,007,000, and Tasmania
Å“ 311,000, total Å“ 9,248,000.
" The receipts of Å“ 26,873,000 were directed by the commission to be
applied in the various markets in which Commonwealth and State
securities are held-Australia, London and New York. The commission
uses its funds for the redemption of Commonwealth and State
securities either by repurchase of these securities on the market, or by
redemption at maturity.
" The large sums applied in repurchases on -Stock Exchanges ensure
a regular market for security holders. When securities are acquired by
the commission, either by repurchase or redemption, they are
immediately cancelled and the public debt is reduced accordingly".
HEALTH AND YOUTH WELFARE.
CHILD HEALTH.
On 2nd September, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" Cabinet decided to-day on the recommendation of the Minister for
Health ( Senator McKenna) that a division of child health be created
in the Department of Health to be transferred subsequently to the
National Health Service.
The functions of the division will be to co-ordinate and extend
existing pre-natal and infant welfare services; to continue research into
the growth and development of infants and children, malnutrition and
other diseases in children and related fundamental biochemistry and
physiology; to conduct general education on infant and child health,
including nutrition; to arrange, and if necessary, undertake special
instruction to medical graduates and others in child health and
nutrition. " For the present the division will be located in the Institute of
Anatomy, Canberra, and the functions of the division will be additional
to those for which the Institute was founded-investigation of the
anatomy and physiology of Australian animals and the development
and maintenance of a museum of health and hygiene.
" Additional permanent positions will be created of a second medical
officer to be an assistant to the Director; a senior biochemist to take
charge of the increasingly important phase of the study of growth and
nutrition; a second biochemist; and a nutritionist 
INCOME TAX.
UNIFORM TAX-RE-IMBURSEMENT TO THE STATES.
On 2nd September, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Under the war-time uniform tax scheme which operated until
June, 1946, tax re-imbursement grants paid to the States amounted
to Å“ 34,255,000. At a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers
in January, 1946, it was agreed that a revised basis should operate as
from 1st July, 1946. The revised basis was contained in the States
Grants ( Tax Re-imbursement) Act and provided that the aggregate
of the grants in 1946-47 and 1947-48 should be Å“ 40,000,000. In respect
of subsequent years, it was specified that the aggregate grant of
Å“ 40,000,000 would be varied in proportion to variation in the States'
populations and the resultant amount increased by half the percentage
increase, if any, in the level of average wages per person employed over
the level in 1946-47. In regard to grants in years after 1947-48, the
legislation provided that a gradually diminishing part of the aggregate
grant would be distributed in the proportions in which the aggregate
grant of Å“ 40,000,000 was distributed to the States in 1946-47 and
1947-48, while a gradually increasing part would be distributed in
proportion to the States' respective populations after adjustments had
been made to those populations to take account of relative sparsity of
population and the numbers of children aged five to fifteen years in each
State. " At the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in
August, 1947, the State Premiers indicated that the re-imbursement
grants would be insufficient to enable them to balance their Budgets in
this financial year.
Cabinet decided to-day that an additional re-imbursement grant of
Å“ 5,000,000 be distributed by the Commonwealth and the States as
follows:-In 1947-48 the additional grant of Å“ 5,000,000 will be distributed among the
States in accordance with the proportions in the first schedule to the States
Grants ( Tax Re-imbursement) Act 1946.
To the extent that, in subsequent years, the aggregate grant determined and
distributed among'the States in accordance with the provisions of the States
Grants ( Tax Re-imbursement) Act 1946 is less than Å“ 45,000,000, the amount
of this deficiency will be made up by the Commonwealth and distributed among
the States in accordance with the proportions in the first schedule to the Act
of 1946. " Legislation to authorize the payment of the additional grant will
be submitted to the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party".
THE GOVERNMENT.
On 5th September, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-

UNIFORM TAXATION-REIMBURSEMENT TO STATES,
BILL INTRODUCED.
In Parliamnt. v-Qn 9th October, 1947, the Prima Minister ( Mr.
Chifley) introduced the States Grants ( Tax Reimbursement) Bill. Mr.
Chifley said-
The object of this bill is to provide for the payment of an additional
tax reimbursement grant to the States under the uniform tax plan.
Under the 1946 act, a revised basis of tax reimbursement grants came
into operation as from 1st July, 1946. Main provisions of that act
were-Aggregate grant in 1946-47 and 1947-48 to be Å“ 40,000,000, distributed among
the States in Accordance with the first sche~ dule of the act.
-In 1948-49 and subsequent years, the aggregate grant to be increased in
accordance with the formula, which takes account of the variations in the States,
jpopulations, and one half of the percentage increase, if any, in the level of
average wages per person employed, over the level in 19441-47.
In 1948-49 and subsequent years, the distribution of the aggregate grant
aniong the States to be varied to an increasing degree in accordance with the
adjusted populations of the States.
The gralit to each State in any year to be not less than that received in
1946-47.
" At the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in
August, 1947, the Premiers maintained that the aggregate grant of
Å“ 4,000,000 would be insufficient to enable them to balance their budgets
in 1947-48. It is clear that there has been a deterioration of State
finances. Mainly because of the success of the Commonwealth Government's
low interest rate policy, State debt charges-which constitute a
major item of State expenditures-have in the aggregate not increased
over the 1938-39 level. In the field of administration and social services,
however, State expenditures are showing an unusually rapid increase,
partly because of the impact of rising costs and prices.
o " The Commonwealth Government does not desire to upset the basis
ofreimbursement provided for in the 1946 act, which, in the absence of
a major change in the relations between the Commonwealth and any
State or States having an effect on the finances ot a -State or -States, was
to operate for at least seven years. On this basis, the State governments
are, in effect, guaranteed the reimbursement provided for in the act,
irrespective of fluctuations in the financial position of the * Commonwealth.
Accordingly, the Government proposes that the States Grants
( Tax Reimbursement) Act 1946 shall continue in operation, with the
addition of a section to provide for-
The payment of an additional grant of Å“ 5,000,000 to the States in 1947-48.
The payment of an additional grant in subsequent years to cover any del
ciency that may occur between the aggregate grant as determined under the
present provisions of the act and 45,000), 000.
" It is also proposed that in each instance the additional grant is to
be distributed among the States in the same proportions as the aggregate
grant of Å“ 40,000,000 is distributed at present [ The bill was passed.

ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY.
NAVAL BOARD-FOURTH MEMBER.
On 9th October, 1947, the Minister for the Navy ( Mr. Riordan)
announced that Captain E. W. Anstice had been appointed Fourth
Naval Member of the Naval Board.
COMMONWEALTH LITERARY FUND.
DECISIONS.
On 9th October, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-.
The Commonwealth Literary Fund Committee to-day awarded
fellowships for 1948 to K. ( Seaforth) MacKenzie, J. K. Ewers, and

awarded to J. W. Gordon Jim Grahame")"
BARLEY.
STABILIZATION PLAN-CONTINUANCE.
On 9th October, 1947, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)
announced that the Commonwealth Government would extend barley
marketing regulations to enable the incoming crop to be marketed by
the Australian Barley Board as in previous seasons, on a Commonwealth
basis, with a guaranteed minimum price. Urgent requests had been
made by the Victorian and South Australian Governments and growers'
organizations that that would be done.
On 30th Octobcr, 1947, Mr. Pollard announced that the Australian
Barley Board would handle and market oats of all grades under voluntary
pool with a minimum guarantee from the Government, and
would be the sole exporter of oats. The arrangement would apply in
all States, but growers would be free to sell on the open market. The
Government guarantee of 3s. 3d. a bushel on rails at growers' sidings,
plus an extra 3d. a bushel to off-set higher cost of bags, would be payable,
but growers would not be permitted to rail oats until advised by the
board. ( For earlier references, please see No. 117, page 44.)
No. 8 POOL-FOURTH ADVANCE.
On 28th October, 1947, Mr. Pollard announced that a fourth advance
of 9d. a bushel for malting grades and 3d. a bushel for feed grades had
been approved on 1946-47 crop barley in No. 8 pool. The advance
brought payments to growers to 7s. 3d. a bushel less freight for 2-row
malting barley, and 3s. 8d. less freight for 6-row feed grade.
REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY.
On 9th October, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
In accordance with the approval given by the King in respect of
the observance this year of Remembrance Sunday in Britain, the Commonwealth
Government proposes that the usual arrangements be made 
in Australia for the commemoration of Remembrance Day on 9th
November, 1947, as a Day of Remembrance for those who gave their
lives both in World War I. and World War II.
WHEAT POOLS PAYMENTS.
No. 11 POOLr-FIRST ADVANCE.
On 10th October, 1947, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)
announced that the first advance to growers for No. 11 wheat pool would
be 4s. 6d. a bushel net for bulk wheat and 5s. a bushel net for bagged
wheat-the highest first advance for any pool.
No. 10 POOL-THIRD ADVANCE.
On 30th October, 1947, Mr. Pollard announced that a third advance
of Is. a bushel had been approved for No. 10 pool. The advance would
bring the amounts to 6s. 7d. for bulk and 6s. 10d. for bagged. less freight.
PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.
DAIRY INDUSTRY-ADVISORY COMMITTEE, REPORT.
On 13th October, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) announced
that the Joint Dairy Industry Advisory Committee which had made a
survey of farm costs of production of butter, cheese and processed milk
products had, in advance of its final report, submitted recommendations
to the Government. It had been decided that the overall -basic return to
the farmer at the factory door would be 2s. per lb. commercial butter
basis-an increase of 41d. per lb. on the present recognized cost of production
of Is. 7Id. per lb. to the dairy farmer and, in accordance with
the Government's understanding with the industry, would be retrospective
to 1st April, 1947.
The Government had decided to guarantee a price to the industry
on total production of the products mentioned for five years from 1st
April, 1947. The basic return to the farmer of 2s. per lb. commercial
butter would be subject to variation up or down in accordance with
demonstrated movements in cost factors. There would be a review of
cost factors between 1s, April and 15th June in each year during the
five years, following which any necessary adjustmnents of the basic price
now determined would be made as from 1st July of the year under
reniew. As a result of the Government's decision, increases in the retail
prices of butter, cheese and associated milk products would be necessary
and while the existing subsidy payments of about Å“ 4,500,000 a year
would be continued, it had yet to determine the extent to which the whole
or part of the increased prices would be passed on to the consumer. It
was estimated that from 1st April, 1947, until such time as it was
possible to adjust retail prices to the consuming public the Commonwealth
Government would pay a further subsidy of about Å“ E2,000,000. 
The Government had approved an annual grant of an amount not
exceeding Å“ 250,000 for five years commencing 1st January, 1948, to
promote improved farm practices in the dairy industry. Plans would
be drawn up by the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard) in consultation
with representatives of the industry and State Ministers of
Agriculture. ( For earlier references, please see No. 115, page 33; No. 122, page 18.)
DAIRY INDUSTRY-CONTROL, BOARD CHAIRMAN.
On 4th November, 1947, Mr. Pollard announced that the president
of the Australian Dairy Farmers' Federation ( Mr. G. C. Howey) had
been appointed chairman of the Australian Dairy Produce Board,
re-constituted under recent legislation.
( For earlier reference, please see No. 130, page 3.)
EXPORTS TO BRITAIN-UNITED KINGDOM MISSION.
On 17th October, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
The Australian Government considers it desirable that Britain
should send a small expert mission to Australia to continue exploratory
discussions commenced at London between representatives of the two
Governments, regarding the production of larger quantities of food in
Australia, so that greater supplies will be available for export to the
British people.
This view is being conveyed to the British Government through the
Australian High Commissioner at London ( Mr. Beasley). He will
express the opinion, already known to : be acceptable to the British
Government, that such a mission will become familiar with technical and
other problems associated with particular primary industries, and secure
a clearer appreciation of action already being taken to stimulate
production. The Australian Government will co-operate enthusiastically in a
project to further increase output of those foods desired by Britain
which can be produced on a commercial scale here, and or which markets
for a reasonable term ahead are assured. This will necessarily include
extensions of existing long-term contracts, and the negotiation of others
-exemplified in preliminary discussions on wheat with Lord Addison
when he was in Australia.
Australia has already been able to increase direct exports to Britain
since the war ended, and to provide food for British Empire countries
in the Pacific and elsewhere. The latter has, no doubt, relieved pressure
on Britain's other supply sources. Australia's efforts will be continued
and, no doubt, can be augmented with direct aid from Britain. Meii
and machines are among urgent requirements to stimulate production
The proposed mission of experts to Australia will have an opportunity
for discussion with Australian agricultural experts, and when
proposals are matured it can be anticipated that their guidance will be
a major contribution in developments

EXPORT. S TO BRITAIN-BUTTER.
On 5th November, 1947, Mr. Pollard said that total exports of
butter during 1946-47 were 133,642,282 lb. of which 116,640,028 lb.
went to Britain. Excepting for a small quantity, Australian butter was
shipped either to or at the direction of the British Ministry of Food and
in accordance with International Emergency Food Council allocations.
( For earlier references, please see No. 115, page 32.)
RURAL PRODUCTION.
On 19th Oct6ber, 1947, Mr. Pollard said-
Gross value of rural production in Australia for 1947-48 has been
estimated at Å“ 447,000,000 compared with the estimated value of
Å“ 379,000,000 for 1946-47 and the average annual value for the five
pre-war years ended 1938-39 of Å“ 211,000,000. The current year's
estimate is about 18 per cent. higher than 1946-47, and considerably
more than double the pre-war figure.
Of the estimated total, agricultural industries are expected to
contribute Å“ 192,000,000, pastoral industries Å“ 168,000,000 and dairy
and farmyard industries Å“ 87,000,000, of which dairy and pig products
represent Å“ 60,000,000. The estimated figures for 1946-47 are
Å“ 139,000,000, Å“ 159,000,000 and Å“ 81,000,000 respectively.
Expressed in terms of percentages, compared with the average
figures for the pre-war five year period ended 1938-39, increases in the
estimated value of rural production for the current period are-
Wheat.-More than 300 per cent. increase in value and about 29 per cent
incrpase in volume.
Wool.-About 90 per cent. increase inlva lue, but about 8 per cent. decrease in
volume. Meats ( except pig-meats).-About 133 per cent. increase in value; 9 per cent.
increase in number of sheep and lambs slaughtered, but 4 per cent. fewer beef
cattle and calves.
Dairy Products ( including pig-meats).-About 112 per cent. in value, but
per cent. decrease in total milk produced and 16 per cent. decrease in the
number of pigs slaughtered.
" Wool, estimated to return Å“ 96,000,000, and wheat, at Å“ 93,000,000,
are expected to contribute 42 per cent. of the estimated gross return"
SUGAR-AGREEMENT, BILL INTRODUCED.
In Parliament.-On 23rd October, the Minister for Customs
( Senator Courtice) introduced the Sugar Agreement Bill. Senator
Courtice said-
This bill is intended to approve the supplementary sugar agreement
made on 17th October, 1947, between the Commonwealth Government
and the Queensland Government. Under that agreement the
governments agreed to amend the present sugar agrement to provide for
an increase of Å“ 4 2s. 8d. a ton in the wholesale price of refined sugar of
la grade, and for the prices of sugar of other grades at present fixed by 
the Sugar Agreement Act, to be increased comnmensurately. Comparison
of the new maximum prices with the present ones is supplied in the
following table Present Price. New Price.
Per ton. Per ton.
E s. d. F d.
Refined sugar of I A grade 33 41 0 37 6 8

" The effect of the increase of Å“ 4 2s. Sd. a ton in the wholesale price
will be to raise the retail price of refined sugar by Ad. per lb. The new
retail price in capitdl cities will be 4jd.
When the present agreement was signed in October, 1945, the Australian
Government gave an assurance to the sugar industry that, if
during the currency of the agreement, cost levels increased substantially,
it would be prepared to consider instituting an inquiry into the position
of the industry. The Government has become increasingly aware of the
difficulties which the industry had to face during the war years and since,
and it is now convinced that the urgency of the industry's need for
assistance is such that immediate action must be taken to provide a
stimulus to the industry [ The bill was passed.

EDUCATION.
UNESCO-AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION 1947.
On 14th October, 1947, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction
( Mr. Dedman) announced that an Australian delegation would attend
the second session of the Unesco conference at Mexico City in November,
1947. The delegation comprised-
Dr. E. R. Walker. leader, the Ausistant Director of the Commnonwealth Office
of Education ( Mr. WV. J. Weeden), the Secretary of the New South Wales
Public Library ( Mr. J. W. Metcalfe), the Lecturer in Arts at Sydney Technical
College ( Mr. F. Medworth), and a nomninee ( if the Australian Teachers

BANKING CONTROL.
LEGISLATION-NATIONALIZATION, BILL INTRODUCED.
In Parliament.-On 15th October, 1947, the Prime ' Minister ( Mr.*
Chifley) introduced the Banking Bill 1947. Mr. Chifley said-
" eThe purpose of this bill is to empower the Commonwealth Bank to
take over the banking business at present conducted in Australia by
private banks. ' State banks and savings banks will not be affected. 
9
It will be the responsibility of the Commnonwea lth Bank under this
legislation-To provide, in accordance with the conditions of normal banking business,
adequate banking facilities for any State or person requiring them;
To conduct its business without discrimination.
To observe, except as otherwise required by law, the practices and usages
customary among bankers and, in particular, to maintain strict secrecy within
the law as to the affairs and dealings of its customers.
The bill also envisages the development, under public ownership,
of a comprehensive banking service that will strengthen and assist the
growth of the Australian economy and provide facilities adequate to its
rapidly expanding and changing needs.
" I hardly need argue the importance of money and credit in a
modern economic system. As the means by which resources are brought
together in production, goods are bought and sold, and prices, wages,
contracts and debts are determined, it plays a part as vital to the
economic body as the blood-stream to the human body. No single factorcan
do more to influence the welfare and progress of a community thanthe
management of the volume and flow of money. Mismanagement of
money, on the other hand, has contributed to the greatest economicdisasters
of modern times-booms and slumps, mass unemployment,
waste of resources, industrial unrest and social misery. Because these
facts are recognized, there is very wide agreement to-day as to the
puirposes which a monetary and banking system should serve in a modern
economy. In that connexion I quote the views expressed in 1937 in the
Report of the Royal Comm ission on Monetary and Banking Systems in
Australia-The general objective of an economic system for Australia should be to
achieve the best use of our productive resources, both present and future. This
mneans. the fullest possible employment of people and resources under conditions
that will provide the highest standard of living. It means, too, the reduction of
the monetary and banking system is an integral fluctuation in general economic
activity. Since part of the economic system, its objective will be to assist with
all the means at its disposal in achieving these ends. ( Para. 616.)
Those views as to the place and functions of money and banking in
Australia were subscribed to by all members of the commission, even
though there was some difference of opinion as to ways of achieving
them. The Labour party has maintained for many years that, since the
influence of money is so great, the entire monetary and banking system
should be controlled by public authorities responsible through the Government
and Parliament to the nation. On this principle the Labour
party has held further that since private banks are conducted primarily
for profit and therefore follow policies which in important respects run
counter to the public interest, their business should be transferred to
public ownership. For this view the strongest reasons can be stated.
In the absence of control, private banks can expand or contract the
volume of their lending and so vary within wide limits the supply of
money available to the public. They can also determine when arid
where they will lend and on what terms; and in these operations they 
are guided primarily by the interests of those who own and control
them. Whatever regard they may claim to pay to the wider concerns
of the nation, their policies are dictated in the last resort by the desire
to make profits and to secure the value of their own assets. Experienet'
of the past has been that private banks increased their lending in good
times and contracted it in bad times, lent always where the profits
seemed largest and most assured, and charged the highest rates they
could obtain for their loans and general services.
" Since trading banks have handled practically all commercial
lending within Australia, their influence on the state of business has
been enormous-indeed dominating. Moreover, the number of banks
has been progressively reduced through amalgamations, of which twelve
have been carried through since 1917. Two more were announced this
year and had they been completed the number of major private trading
banks in Australia would have been reduced to seven. By this means
the great power of private banking in Australia has become concentrated
in the hands of boards of directors comprising a relatively few men
who are responsible for the exercise of their powers not to the nation
but only to a limited number of people, some here nd some abroad, who
have invested money in bank shares.
Time and again the policies of the private banks have run counter
to national needs for steady growth and high levels of employment. To
go some years back it is correct to say that the banks fed the boom and
promoted unsound development in the ' twenties. When the depression
came the banks as a whole restricted new lending and. called in advances.
Between December, 1929, and March, 1932, their advances fell by
approximately Å“ 45,000,000. The effect of this was to accentuate the
contraction of business and the unemployment of those years. They
helped but little in recovery during the ' thirties, waiting rather for
improvement to come from other sources instead of taking the initiative
and helping to promote recovery. They followed these courses because
it seemed best and safest from the standpoint of their own interests.
" Labour policy on banking has envisaged that, together with the
elimination of private banking, the Commonwealth Bank would be
strengthened to give it adequate control of monetary and credit conditions
within Australia and its services would be extended to meet the
needs of all sections of the people. The Labour party has in particuluar
advocated the reduction of interet rates which, in the absence of control,
were maintained at excessively high levels.
" The Commonwealth Bank was established in 1911 by the Labour
Government as a national bank, intended primarily to compete with the
private banks on their own ground and break the monopoly they held
over the business of banking in Australia. Despite bitter opposition
from private interests and many prophecies of failure, the Commonwealth
Bank rendered great service to the nation and grew rapidly
during World War I. and the succeeding years. In 1924, however, the
Bruce-Page Government reconstituted the bank and placed it under a 
board comprised predominantly of representatives of private industry
and commerce. This board was mainly interested in turning the Commonwealth
Bank into a bankers' bank and its policy was to forbid the
bank from competing actively with the private banks for general banking
business, thus restricting its expansion and defeating the key
purpose for which the bank had been established. That fact was clearly
demons: rated in evidence before the banking commission. The late
Sir Ernest Riddle, who was then Governor of the bank, stated that even
if the bank had funds available over and above those deposited with it
by the trading banks it would not use those funds for advances to people
who wanted to transfer their accounts from trading banks to the Commonwealth
Bank. That kind of situation prevailed until the Labour
Government took office in 1941. Moreover, the Commonwealth Bank
Board, as constituted by the Bruce-Page Government, aligned itself with
the private banks during the crisis of the early ' thirties in attempting
to force on the Government a policy of monetary deflation and curtailment
of wages and social service payments. That policy was stated in
the following extract from a letter addressed by the chairman of the
Bank Board ( Sir Robert Gibson) to the then Treasurer ( Mr. Theodore)
on 12th February, 1931, which read-
Subject to adequate and equitable reductions in all wages, salaries, and
allowances, pensions, social benefits of all kinds, interest and other factors which
affect the cost of living. the Commonwealth Bank Board will actively co-operate
with the trading banks and the governments of Australia in sustaining industry
and restoring employment.
Thus during a critical time in Australia's history the bank was
used by reactionary interests for a purpose directly opposed to the
welfare of the Australian people and in opposition to the will of the
Government of the day.
In spite of conservative management under a board for many years,
the Commonwealth Bank, including the Commonwealth Savings Bank,
has made remarkable headway. At 30th June, 1947, it had 377 branches
spread throughout Australia, as well as branches in Papua, New Guinea
and in London. Total employees exceeded 9,000 and total assets, apart
from those held in respect of deposits of the private banks, were almost
Å“ 900,000,000. It has nearly 4,000,000 accounts and is unique among
the banks of the world in that it provides comprehensive banking facilities
for business and personal needs through its General Bank, Savings
Bank, Mortgage Bank, Rural Credits, Industrial Finance and Housing
Departments. In both wars the bank made advances against primary
commodities to enable producers to be paid promptly despite serious
delays in sea-borne trade. These advances exceeded Å“ 350,000,000 during
the six years of the last war. In another field the bank has administered
controls over banking, interest rates, the note issue, foreign exchange
and gold and has developed the full functions of a central bank. In all,
the record of the Commonwealth Bank stands as a great justification of
publicly-owned banking and demonstrates beyond question that a public
banking institution is capable of being highly efficient, progressive and 
adaptable. In another respect also the bank has largely fulfilled the
intentions of its founders that it should be a bank for the people.
Together with its associated institution, the Commonwealth Savings
Bank, it has become pre-eminently the bank for the average man and
woman. To-day it has a far greater number of depositors than the
whole of the private banks taken together. At April, 1947, the number
of deposit accounts with the Commonwealth Bank and Commonwealth
Savings Bank was about 3,800,000, whereas the number of deposit
accounts with the trading banks was approximately 1,250,000.
" Assisted by the existence of the Commonwealth Bank, the Labour
Government has been able to make notable progress in carrying out its
policy of lower interest rates. After World War I. the interest rate on
government loans reached as high as 64 per cent. At the outbreak of
World War II., the rate for long-term government loans was almost
4 per cent. It is now 34 per cent. The treasury-bill rate is now 1 per
cent., as compared with a rate of 6 per cent. in 1930. The maximum
overdraft rate has been restricted to 44 per cent., as compared with rates
of 6 per cent. and higher some years ago. Substantial reductions have
also been made in the rates at which semi-governmental bodies are able
to borrow, and in many other rates.
The experience of the war years emphasized the vital importance
of public control of the banking system. Through governmental expenditure
for war purposes, the liquid resources of the trading banksand
hence their capacity to expand credit-increased rapidly. To
prevent ' secondary inflation arising from such as expansion of credit.
even the then Treasurer ( Mr. Fadden) felt that some action was
necessary, and, in 1941, he obtained an undertaking from the private
banks that they would inform the Commonwealth Bank of the amount
of surplus investible funds they held from time to time and would
deposit with the Commonwealth Bank such amounts as were determined
by that hank. On assuming office in November, 1941, the Labour Government
carefully examined the arrangements made by the previous
Government and decided that it was necessary to introduce National
Security ( War-time Banking Control) Regulations. These regulations
greatly strengthened and increased in scope the arrangements agreed to
by the previous Government. They also ensured that the private banks
would not make unreasonable profits out of the war and implemented
certain recommendations of the Banking Commission.
" In the light of experience gained in the administration of these
regulations, the Government decided, in 1945, that the main principles
on which they were based should be embodied in substantive legislation.
At the same time the Government decided to reconstitute the Commonwalth
Bank and to assume greater powers over banking policy. The
main objects of the system of control provided by this legislation were-
To strengthen the central banking functions of the Commonwealth Bank,
especially by providing for the co-ordination of banking policy under the direc-
Ã¸ tion of the Commonwealth Bank; control through the special account system 
of the volume of credit in circulation: control of bank interest rates and bank
advance policy; and the mobilization and control of the foreign exchange and
gold resources of the Australian economy.
To ensure that the financial policy of the Commonwealth Bank would be in
harmony with the general economic and financial policy of the Government and
in the interests of the people of Australia.
To reserve to publicly-owned and controlled banks the banking business of
governments and governmental authorities.
To safeguard the depositors of the banks against loss of their deposits.
The Bank Board was abolished and management of the bank was
entrusted to the Governor, assisted by an advisory council.
This legislation was very strongly opposed by the trading banks,
by some sections of the business community and by the Opposition
parties. It was said that the legislation would hand over the banking
system to political control, that it was nationalization on the cheap
and that it would open the way to the general socialization of industry
by indirect means. In his second-reading speech on the legislation, the
Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Menzies) made a pledge that, if he and
his colleagues were returned to office, they would restore the former
method of control of the Commonwealth Bank by a board and would
hold themselves obliged instantly to review the working of the
legislation. In spite of the sectional clamour against the legislation
and the prediction of dire consequences to follow from it, the Government
was returned to office at the general election last year. It may,
therefore, be said that a majority of the electors have endorsed the
Government's 1945 banking legislation and have approved the purpose
for which it was enacted, namely, to give the Government full and
effective control over monetary and banking policy in Australia. That
object was made clear to Parliament and to the country.
The Banking Act of 1945 was framed on the best constitutional
advice and the Government felt confident that it would withstahd any
legal challenge that might be directed against it. For example, it
seemed quite clear that Parliament had made a law with respect to
banking, and had thus acted within the scope of the powers conferred
by section 51 ( xiii.) of the Constitution, when it enacted section 48 of
the Banking Act. This section prohibited trading banks, other than
State banks from carrying out banking business for a State or any
authority of a State, including a local governing authority. The provision
was regarded by the Government as an important part of the
legislation. It embodied the principle that the banking business of all
public bodies should be reserved to publicly-owned and controlled banks.
Further, in most other countries it has long been accepted that all
government banking business should be conducted through the central
bank so as to give the central bank added strength to control the supply
of credit and to enable it to take action in time to offset any disturbance
to credit conditions resulting from government operations. In the
aggregate the banking business of State governments and State
authorities is large and so are some of their individual transactions. 
They have an important bearing on current financial conditions. It was
the Government's view that the powers of the central bank should be
strengthened by making it as far as practicable the banker for public
authorities. When challenged in the High Court, however, section 48
was held to be invalid on the grounds that so long as private banks
existed States and State authorities could not be denied the use of their
facilities. The decision showed that full public control of banking as
sought under the 1945 legislation could not be secured without pubiic
ownership of banking.
" The decision forced the Government to re-examine all the circumstances,
constitutional and otherwise, surrounding the legislation of
1945. In particular, the Government has had to reconsider the constitutional
basis of sections 18 to 22 of the Banking Act which required the
private banks to make deposits in special accounts with the Commonwealth
Bank and also the attitude of the private banks towards those
sections. The special accounts are the crux of the control of credit given
to the Commonwealth Bank by the Banking Act of 1945. The necessities
of war-time finance greatly increased the base of liquid reserves
on which trading banks normally build a superstructure of secondary
credit. To prevent secondary inflation with rising prices it was necessary
to imobilize some parts of the banks' deposits in special accounts
with the Commonwealth Bank from which the banks were not allowed to
withdraw any amounts, except with the consent of the Conimmonwealth
Bank. If the amounts in these special accounts were freely available
to the trading banks, they could, by increasing their advances, build up
a secondary credit expansion of formidable dimensions. Added to the
spending power already available to the public, this might easily
produce a dangerous inflationary situation. It would be disastrous,
from the point of view of the people of Australia and the prospects of
economic stability, if sections 18 to 22 of the Banking Act were held to
be invalid and the consequent loss of control over the banking system
led to an inflation of credit, with all the loss and disorder which inflation
entails. These sections necessarily severely limit the freedom of action
of the trading banks. This was their intention. The Government was
determined that the control of the Commonwealth Bank in this field
should be absolute and beyond dispute.
While the precise form of special accounts provided for in the
Banking Act of 1945 was peculiar to Australia, the essential feature of
the control of credit by this means are to be found in operation in
Britain, Canada and a number of other countries. The same conditions
which made a control of this kind essential in Australia have forced
governments elsewhere to adopt similar measures. They are to-day an
accepted part of central bank technique in many parts of the world.
The private banks in Australia have always bitterly resented any
attempt to place restrictions on their power to create or restrict credit.
When the 1945 Banking Bill was before the House they fought these
provisions with all the means, at their disposal. Towards the end of 
1945, when the bill had become law, they were required to transfer their
war-time special deposits to the special accoun's established under the
new legislation and to make their first monthly lodgment to these
accounts. The private banks, obviously acting in concert and on legal
ndvice, made it clear a' that time that, while they were submitting to
the legislation for the time being, they were reserving the right to
rhalleng, it at a suitable opportunity. The following reservation was
made by one of the Iank-. in a let'er to the Commonwealth Bank:-
We are most anxiions. to co-operate with your Bank to ensure the continuance
of our present harmonious relations, but you will appreciate that our duty to our
shareholders compels us to have regard to our legal position; therefore, we feel
it necessary to advise yon, with all due respect, that acquiescence or compliance
on this Banik's part with any request or directions from you is not to be taken
to import nny contract with your Bank in the terms of the Act.
Statements to a similar effect were made in letters sent by six of
the other banks. These reservations were brought to the notice of the
Commonwealth Government at the time for legal consideration. This
indication of the attitude of the private banks assumed greater significance
when the special account system was challenged in the statement
of claim made by Melbourne City Council in connexion with the section
48 case-even though eventually the challenge to sections 18 to 22 of the
Banking Act was not pressed. It assumed still greater significance
when the High Court decision on section 48 made it clear that, although
the Commonwealth Parliament had by the Constitution been given
power to legislate on banking, nevertheless a law which was clearly a
law with respect to banking could be held invalid on other constitutional
considerations. The position which confronted the Government was
that while doubts had arisen as to the constitutional validity of its banking
legislation, there was evidence that the private banks were maintaining
their hostility towards this legislation and were biding their time
against a suitable opportunity to challenge it in the hope of throwing
off the restraints they so strongly disliked.
With economic difficulties increasing overseas the Government
must be in a position to act with certainty and effectiveness to ensure
fulfilment of its policy of full employment and the maintenance of economic
and financial stability. During the war and since its conclusion
the Australian economy has been kept more stable than the economy of
any other country in the world. It must be remembered that an important
part of the machinery for maintaining that stability has been the
control over the banking system exercised under the 1945 banking
legislation and that an essential part of that legislation is the special
account procedure. The difficulties of the transition from war to peace
are far from over. In fact, in some directions they are increasing.
The rapid exhaustion of the United States loan to Britain has confronted
the sterling area-and many other countries as well-with serious
balance of payments problems and this is only one aspect of a general
situation which is highly unstable. 
" To deal with the economic and financial problems both of the
transition period and of the following years, the Government must have
the necessary powers over banking and monetary policy. Fluctuations
in business activity and employment are not solely due to monetary
causes, but they are certainly greatly influenced by financial policy.
The Government would not be justified in gambling on the outcome of
possible threats to the 1945 legislation. The structure of banking based
on the legislation of 1945 went part of the way towards the objectives
which the Labour party has long advocated in regard to banking. At
the same time it offered to the private banks the opportunity to cooperate
within a national system of banking, subject to overall control
by the Commonwealth Bank, as they had, in fact, done during the war
period. That position was never accepted without reservation by the
private banks and now that the legal foundations of the system have
been challenged the Government has decided to proceed with its longstanding
policy of full public ownership.
The bill which is before the House gives effect to the Government's
decision. Before the Attorney-General ( Dr. Evatt) left Australia, he
gave close attention to the legal and constitutional aspects of the bill,
and laid down the main lines on which the preparation of the measure
has proceeded. I would emphasize that under this measure there will be no interruption
or disturbance of the usual banking facilities available to the
Australian community. The bill provides that the private banks shall
maintain their services until they are taken over by the Commonwealth
Bank. As the banks are taken over, either through the acquisition of
their shares or of their assets, they will be kept in operation as going
concerns. Customers will not notice any difference after the control
of the bank with which they have been dealing has passed to the Commonwealth
Bank. They will be able to continue their banking business
without change or interruption.
" The bill imposes on the Commonwealth Bank an obligation to
conduct its banking transactions in accordance with the practices and
usages customary among bankers particularly in regard to the nondisclosure
of information concerning the affairs of its customers. The
confidential nature of the relationship between banker and customer is
well established in law; and, subject to certain exceptions sanctioned
or required by law, bankers are under an obligation of secrecy with
respect to their customers' affairs. The bill specifically provides that
this position will be preserved.
" Differences between the constitutions of the various private banks
and the fact that some are incorporated in Australia and some overseas
make it desirable to provide alternative ways in which the Commonwealth
Bank may acquire their business. Accordingly the bill provides
for two main processes of acquisition-
Voluntary or compulsory acquisition of the Australian business and
assets of the private banks, or
Compulsory acquisition of shares. 
" The first could be applied to all banks, whether incorporated in
Australia or overseas, and in the case of banks incorporated in. Australia,
any part of their overseas assets may also be acquired compulsorily.
Under the alternative procees, the shares of a private hank
may be conmpulsorily acquired if the Treasurer is satisfied that the
majority of its shares are registered in Australia. This process would
be applied only to banks9 incorporated in Australia, and would be the
initial step towards an eventual transfer of their business to the Commonwealth
Bank. As a preliminary step to tb' acquisition of the
business of a ) rivate bank, provision is m-ade for the Treasurer, by due
notice, to invite the private bank to make an agreement with the Cornrnonweal'h
Bank for the transfer of its business on a specified date,
which must be not more than two months later than the date on which
the notice is given. If an agreement for the transfer of the business of
a private bank, which is willing to negotiate, is not completed by the
specified date, the Treasurer may -extend the currency of the notice
until agreement is reached. Agreement must, however, be reached-if
there is to be agreement at all-before the notice expires. Once the notice
expires, the assets of the bank concerned forthwith becomes vested in,
and its liabilities are assumed by, the Commonwealth Bank. There is
nothing in the bill to prevent the Commonwealth Bank from reaching
an agreement with a private bank for the acquisition of its business
before any notice is issued at all; but all agreements, whether made
before or after notice is given, will be subject to the approval of the
Treasurer. The bill also includes a provision whereby the Treasurer
may, after the business of a private bank is acquired by the Commonwealth
Bank, require that private bank to cease carrying on further
banking business in Au-tralia.
" If a private bank enters into a voluntary agreement for the
acquisition of its business by the Commonwealth Bank, it will be
entitled to receive an exemption from taxation on the amount paid to it
in pursuance of the agreement. It is further provided in the bill that
shareholders of the bank will be exempt from taxation on any dividend
or distribution which directly results from the payment received from
the Commonwealth Bank under the agreement. These concessions will
not apply in the case of a compulsory acquisition. The exemptions
referred to will not relieve the private bank from liability for any tax
payable by the bank in respect of profits derived in the normal course
of its business but upon which the ordinary tax liability has not been
met. The bank and its shareholders will still be liable to taxation in
relation to profits earned after the year of income ended 30' h June, 1947,
or any accounting period substituted therefore, and before the date of
transfer, or in relation to any interest which may become payable under
the agreement. If shares are acquired by voluntary purchase, the price paid by
the Commonwealth Bank must not be less than the market value in
Australia of those shares at 15th August, 1947. These prices have been 
carefully ascertained and are specified. The provision iinade for the
compulsory acquisition of shares will apply only to the share.-of private
banks incorporated in Australia, which are the institutions referred to
in Part I. of the First Schedule to the bill. Where the majority in
number of the shares of any of these banks are situated in Australia,
the bill provides that the Treasurer may, by notice published in the
Gazette, declare that the shares in the bank concerned shall be vested
in the Commonwealth Bank on a date specified by the Treasurer; and
on that date the Commonwealth Bank will, by force of the legislation,
become the holder (, othfe shares and a: m ember of the bank in question.
" It is provided that the directors of an Australian private bank,
the shares of which have Leen compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth
Bank, will cease to hold office on the date on which the compulsory
acquisition becomes effective. The Governor of th
Bank will, with the approval of the Treasurer, thereupon appoint
directors, including a chairman of directors. The directors appointed
by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank will have full power to
manage the bank in question, to dispose of its business in Australia
to the Commonwealth Bank and to dispose also of the bank's business
outside Australia: but any arrangement for disposal may only be concluded
if approved by the Treasurer after he has received a reccommendation
from the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank.
For all property or shares of the banks, conmpulsorily acqtuiredl. fair
and reasonable compensation will be payable. The compensation
payable may be determined by agreement, approved by the Treasurcr
or, failing agreement, the amount payable will be determined by th: e
court of claims to be established under the proposed legislation. The
bill sets out the procedure to be followed in reaching agreement or,
alternatively, in referring claims to the court for determination. The
bill provides for the establishment of a Federal Court of Claims consisting
of a Chief Judge and such other judges as are appointed. The
court may, if it thinks fit, appoint two assessors to assist it. The court
will have jurisdiction to hear and determine claims for compensation
arising under this bill. Regulations may be made under other acts
also to confer jurisdiction on the court to determine claims arising out
of the operation of those acts. The jurisdiction of the court in respect
of compensation under this hill must be exercised by not. less than
three judges. Jurisdiction may, however, be exercised by less than
three judges by agreement between the parties concerned. A determination
of the court will be final and conclusive and not subject to appeal
to the High Court.
" The bill makes provision for the protection of officers of private
banks in respect of continuance of employment, salaries and conditions
of service. The bill provides that when the Commonwicalth Bank 
proceeds by way of acquisition of the shares of a private bank, the
salary and general conditions of service of officers of the private bank
will not be disturbed, and will be secured to them. Similarly, when
the Commonwealth Bank takes over the assets of a private bank,
including the assets of a bank whose shares have previously been
acquired, each officer of the private bank who was employed in the
service of that bank in Australia will be entitled to be employed by
the Commonwealth Bank at the salary and on the general conditions of
service applicable to his existing employment. The Commonwealth
Bank will be obliged to appoint each such officer, being a . British
subject, to an appropriate position in the Commonwealth Bank Service.
This will be done as soon as practicable after employment commences
with" the Commonwealth Bank. Special provision also is made to enable
that service to absorb all officers stationed ou'side Australia whose duties
are connected with the Australian business. It will be seen that during
the period necessarily elapsing between the date of acquisition of a
private bank, either by way of shares or assets of the private bank, and
the date when an officer of that bank is appointed to an appropriate
position in the Commonwealth Bank Service, he is fully safeguarded.
He will continue to be employed with salary, pension benefits, and sick
and long service leave at least as favorable as when in the employ of
the private bank. When later appointed to the Commonwealth Bank
Service, he will enjoy all the rights and privileges of an officer of that
service, with protection in respect of existing salary, pension benefits,
and sick and long service leave. Service in the private bank, continuous
with service with the Commonwealth Bank, will count as service with
the Commonwealth Bank for purposes of promotion, leave and pensions.
To establish an officer's present entitlement to pension benefits and
sick and long service leave, the bill provides for the appointment of a
committee in respect of each private bank affected, consisting of a judge
( or a person qualified to be a judge), an officer of the Commonwealth
Bank, and a representative of the bank officers concerned, to ascertain
the benefits which are, or woul'd have been granted in accordance with
the practice of the private bank concerned, or of the superannuation
fund of that bank. The findings of this committee will then become a
legally enforceable right in respect of the future employment of these
nfficers even though they may not have at present any such legal protection.
The industrial awards now governing the employment of persons
in private banks will continue in force until appointment to the Commonwealth
Bank Service is made. Further, during this period, officers
will continue to have the right to apply to the appropriate tribunal for
variations of these awards. On appointment to the Commonwealth
Bank they will have the same rights in respect of industrial matters as
. lr, now enjoyed by officers of the Commonwealth Bank.
The Commonwealth Bank is recognized as a good employer. On
ihe whole the general conditions of employment in its service are at
least as good as, if not better than, those generally provided by the 
private banks. Its employees are given special legal protection as to
promotion, dismissal and disciplinary action. Under Part XIII. of
the Commonwealth Bank Act promotion and disciplinary appeal boards
have been constituted. Those boards, which are under an independent
chairman and include representatives of employees, are empowered to
give final decisions on appeals relating, respectively, to the promotion
and to the punishment, dismissal or reduction in status of officers.
Such rights of appeal . are not at present enjoyed by employees of the
private banks. The changed conditions of the expanded Commonwealth
Bank will, of courst, render it necessary to examine the provisions of
the Commonwealth Bank Act relating to the Commonwealth Bank
Service, and any amendments considered desirable to -meet the position
will be brought forward at an early date.
" With regard to former officers of the private banks who have
retired on pensions from the private banks' services, their position, as
well as that of dependants of deceased officers, is also fully safeguarded.
The Commonwealth Bank will assume responsibility for the payment
of pensions in accordance with existing rights, which will be converted
into legally enforceable claims. As the Commonwealth Bank is required
to assume liability for pensions, both in respect of retired officers and
officers now serving, it is necessary that an appropriate amount of the
superannuation funds established in association with the private banks
to meet these obligations should be transferred to the Commonwealth
Bank. The bill contains the necessary provisions to give effect to this
requirement. " There will be no necessity for a parliamentary appropriation to
provide for compcnsation. In acquiring the business of the private
banks the Commonwealth Bank will also assume the liabilities of these
institutions. The amount of compensation payable will necessarily
have regard to this factor and it will be well within the capacity of the
Commonwealth Bank to meet the payment from its own resources. The
Commonwealth Bank will make payment in cash or government bhond
as desired. " As I have said before, the Government believes that a publicly
owned and controlled banking system, in which final responsibility for
policy is in the hands of a government directly responsible to the
electors, conforms much more closely to the luirements of a democratic
community than the system advocated in 1945 by Mr. Menzieis,
who, with his party, is pledged to restore control of banking and
monetary policy to a body having no responsibility to the electors.
In most advanced countries there has been during recent years a
strong trend towards public ownership of key public utilities. This
trend has not been confined to governments, representing particular
political parties. Such projects have been brought forward both in
Australia and elsewhere not only by Labour governments but also by 
non-Labour ' go vernments who recognized that in the circumstances of
the case the balance of advantages from the community standpoint lies
in national rather than private ownership and control. But if any
service fits the description of a key public utility it is banking. As I
have said earlier, no element in the working of our economy has a
greater influence for good or ev-il upon economic and social welfare
than the management of money and credit.
" The Government is convinced that under public ownership the
banking system will have immense opportunities for serving Australia.
It will have the backing of the entire credit resources of the nation. It
will be free from the cramping limitations of sectional private ownership
which bid the private banks to serve this interest but not that
interest, and to judge all business from the narrow standpoint of maximu-
m profits for the smallest outlay. It will be able to take longer-term
views of projects requiring finance and, since the whole Australian
economy will be its field, it will have the widest scope for initiative
and for the spread of its investments.
" Essentially tile task of the new organization will be to provide
a financial mechanism appropriate to the needs of our rapidly growing
economy. Australia is destined to see great developments in the coming
years and this process, which is already under way, must be promoted
by every every means possible. There will be a great increase in our
population. Industries will expand in all fields and we must extend our
markets abroad. The basic services of transport and communications,
water supply, power, housing, health and education must be enlarged to
meet the needs of a larger economy working at higher levels of technique
and productivity. The stress everywhere will be upon new forms of
enterpris e, new methodi of production, and new uses for the resourceis
of this country. Finance must co-operate and take the initiative in
this progress. As new types of industry are developed, new types of
finance will be required and the banking system s-hould anticipate these
needs and be in the field with the right kind of facilities to assist and
encourage such development.
Moreover, there can be no doubt that a bank should be more than
a mere money lender. A banking system created to serve the welfare of
the community can aid industry by the quality of its advice and the
incidental services it renders as well as by the financial accommodation
it provides. Hence the Government sets particular store on the developmnent
of these ancillary services, It has in view the building up of a
highly qualified staff that will enable the Commonwealth Bank to give
skilled advice as part of its banking service. Secondary industries, for
exa'mpkc, will be able to turn to the bank for the assistance of prodnction
engineers and cost accountants to help them with their problems.
Primary industries will have the aid of agricultural experts. I contemplate,
too, that the Bank would establish, at least in the capital cities,
departments of advice which would help individuals with their daily
financial problems. Whiether any charge would have to be made by the 
bank would naturally depend on the circumstances of each case but
as far as possible these facilities would be provided freely as part of a
Ftrengthened banking service.
" But if the financial system is to meet these requirements it tmust
be comprehensive, strong and flexible. It must be alive to the requirements
of the times and be capable of seeing ahead. It must have one
goal for its policies and one standard for its work-the service of the
nation in all its interests, great or small. The Government believes that
only under a national system of banking can this ideal be approached.
Only under such a system will finance be a real servant of industry and
not its master.
" Fears are being spread by opponents of this measure that the
people will lose an advantage by reason of having only one bank to
deal with instead of a choice between several banks. This brings up the
question of competition between the private banks-how far it exists
and what it has been worth to the community and to customers of the
banks. The Banking Commission went into this question of competition
at great length. It found that the private banks did not compete in any
serious way as regards interest rates and other charges but sought rather
to attract customers by offering various other inducements. In general,
they behaved in the manner of semi-monopolistic institutions which
stood in fear of ruining their own market. There was certainly nothinglike
the all-out rivalry to give the public the widest and cheapest services
which we are asked to suppose exists between them. Amalgamations on
the other hand have reduced the number of banks, so accentuating the
monopolistic character of those that remain. There are to-day really no
more than eight trading banks doing a nation-wide business where
years ago there were twenty, -and we have no reason to suppose that this
process would not go further if private banking continued. The average
man, I suggest, will find it hard to believe that fewer banks mean greater
competition. We recall how the former Commonwealth Bank Board, which
considered itself to be conducting a bankers' bank, prevented the Commonwealth
Bank from competing with the private institutions. We
have the admissions of private bankers that competition between themselves
is of a limited kind. We have seen the number of banks dwindling
over the pears, each amalgamation removing one or more possible
competitors from the ring. It is a fair conclusion, I think, that from
the standpoint of benefit to the community, banking competition has
meant little for some time past and would probably have meant less as
time went on. On the other hand, I may point out that the Commonwealth
Bank is charged under the legislation to be strictly impartial as
between customers and to avoid all discrimination. A system of appeal
will be provided so that a person who considers he has not had reasonable
treatment from a local manager will be a'ble to refer his case to
regional authority for reconsideration. Special arrangements will be 
: made to ensure that this re-con. sileration is given without delay. In
view of these considerations, therefore, it appears to me that the advantages
of having a choice between several private banks as compared with
. a single national bank are largely illusory.
The proposal to take over the banks is being condemned in some
quarters in recklessly extravagant terms; all kinds of hidden purposes
are being wrongly ascribed to it from the same sources. The simple
truth is this-the reasons and motives for this measure and the uses to
which it can and will be applied are no more and no less than I have
stated. The opponents of banking change seems always to have fought
against new developments while belatedly approving such changes as
have been made and which they had originally opposed. In 1937 they
criticized the Banking Commission Report and defended the old
syst-em. In 1945 they nailed their colours to the Banking Report and
resisted implacably the legislation of that year. Now they seem disposed
to make the 1945 legislation their rallying cry whilst preparing
themselves once again to die in the last ditch against a new, logical
and necessary developmen'. Their predictions of calamity will prove
just as groundless as those they have expressed so many times before.
There has been no political interference in banking under the 1945
legislation and there will be none under the new system. In not one
instance since that legislation was passed has the Government intervened
in the administration of the Commonwealth Bank. Within the
framework of the broad economic and financial policy laid down by
the Government the bank has carried on its work successfully and harmnoniously.
On broad policy issues it has in turn advised the Government
and been advised by the Government. Conflict has not arisen at
any stage. It is timely to record that under section 9 of the Commonwealth
Bank Act 1945 the Government cannot interfere in the internal
transactions of the bank. Its power is limited to the laying down where
necessary of the broad lines of monetary and banking policy. Business
people and private citizens will have all the safeguards as to the conduct
of their banking business which can be given by law and by the
long and honorable administrative tradition of the Commonwealth
Bank. On acquisition of a bank, shareholders are assured of just compensation,
bank employees are protected, depositors are guaranteed and
business will be carried on without interruption.
Full public ownership of the banks will ensure control of banking
in the public interest. It will enable effective steps to be taken against
the dangers of secondary inflation. It will assist us to stave off depres-
. sion and to avoid a repetition of the miseries of 1930. Beyond this, it
will o0 : nu a lung-locked doorway to the development of a monetary and
banking system truly adequate to our national requirements and wholly
devoted to the service of Australia [ The bill was passed.

might be guilty of subversive activity. They include not only Communists
but also other persons whose activities might be detrimental
to the interests of this country. Nothing has been disclosed to date
that would warrant the appointment of a royal commission or any

the results of reports received regarding any section of the community
or any individual, the necessary action will he taken."

representative will be Lieutenant-General Sir Leslie
Morshead, who commanded the Australian forces during the seige of
Tobruk. All members of the delegation will be returned servicemen
and, at the conclusion of the ceremony at Tobruk, the delegation will
proceed to Gallipoli on a tour of Australian war memorials and war
graves-the first official visit since 1924."

EXTERNAL COMMUN ICATIONS.
TELE-COMMUNIOATIONS--INTERNA TIONAL RADIO
BOARD.
On 20th October, 1947, the Postmaster-General ( Senator Cameron)
: announced that, as a result of decisions reached by international tele-
* communications conferences recently held at Atlantic City, an
international board would be established ' at Geneva to deal with the
-orderly registration of radio frequencies throughout -the world to meet
radio communication requirements generally. The International Frequency
Registration Board would be a highly specialized body responsible
for the study of the purposes and technical characteristics of each
; radio-frequency assignment necessary for application in the radiocommunication
sphere, with a view to ensuring formal international
, recognition thereof. The board would render advice to 80 member
countries of the International Tele-communications Union to secure the
-operation of the maximum practicable number of radio channels in
those portions of the spectrum where international interference might
occur. The board would consist of eleven members including Australia.
The Chief Research Engineer of the Postmaster-General's Depa-rtment
( Mr. S. H. Witt) would be Australia's representative on the board
mentioned. ,( For earlier references, please see No. 116, page 17; No. 123, page 3.)
DEFENCE.
SCIENCE CONFERENCE, 1947.
' On 20th October, 1947, the Minister for Defence Dedman)
announced that Australia would be represented at a meeting at London
in November, 1947, of British and Dominion representatives on defence
science by the chairman of -the New Weapons and Equipment Development
Committee ( Major-General L. E. Beavis), the Controller-General
of Munitions Supply, Department of Munitions ( Mr. N. K. S.
Brodribb), Brigadier H. S. Nurse and the Professor of Physics at
Melbourne University ( Professor L. F. Martin).

PARLIAMENT.
MEMBERS' ALLOWANCES-PARTY LEADERS, BILL
INTRODUCED.
In Parliamnent.-On 21st October, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr.
Chifley) introduced the Parliamentary Allowances Bill ( No. Mr.
Chifley) said-
" Parliamentary Allowances Act makes provision for the payment
' of annual allowances to the Leaders of the Opposition in both Houses
-of the Parliament as some recompense for the onerous nature of their
duties. When the act was under consideration in this House in June,
1947, I gave an undertaking that T would consider the submission to 
Parliament during this sessional period of a bill to provide for the , payment,
as from 1st July, 1947, of an annual allowance to the Leader of
the Australian Country party for the same purpose. This bill is in
consequence of that promise." [ The bill was passed.

SERVICE PAY RATES.
REPATRIATION-PATRIOTIC FUNDS.
In Parliament.-On 21st October, 1947, the Minister for Repatriation
( Mr. Barnard) introduced the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation
Bill. Mr. Barnard said-
The bill is to bring provisions for control of patriotic funds under
the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. The existing . provisions are
National . Security ( Patriotic Funds) Regulations under the Defence-
( Transitional Provisions) Act. The main activities of the funds are
diminishing, and many have already been wound up, but others are
continuing their ordinary operations, and will eventually go through
the winding-up stage. Altogether, it is probable that, in some -form or
another, activities will continue for some time yet. It is therefore
desirable that the provisions be removed from the Defence ( Transitional
Provisions) Act. They are administered by the Minister for
Repatriation and the Repatriation Commission, and the logical place
for them is in the repatriation legislation. The bill inserts a section
in the Repatriation Act to enable the Governor-General to make the
necessary regulations under that act. National Security ( Patriotic
Funds) Regulations will be repealed, and the new regulations in the
Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Regulations will . be generally on the
same lines as those under which control has * been exercised up till now."
[ The bill was passed.
HOUSING.
WAR SERVICE HOMES-PRIORITY.
On 22nd October, 1947, the Minister -for Works and Housing ( Mr.
Lemmon) said that following the recent amendment to the War Service
Homes Act to enable a building programme to be undertaken it had
been necessary to meet changed circumstances resulting from greatly
increased demand for materials. The new procedure provided for the
determination of priority for building war service homes on the basis
of need. Applicants who had been requested by the War Service
Homes Commission to pay preliminary fees or arrange for the preparation
of plans and specifications by a private architect under the
previous priority system would be finalized under that system, but the
priority of all other applications would be decided in accordance with'
the new policy of determining priority on a needs basis.

RECONSTRUCT ION.
TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT-HAVANA CONFERENCE.
On 28th October, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" Cabinet to-day approved acceptance of the invitation to the
World Trade Conference which opens at Havana on 21st November,
1947. The Leader of the Australian delegation will be the Minister for
Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr. Dedman) and the delegation will comprise
the Director-General of Post-war Reconstruction ( Dr. H. C.
Coombs), the Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture
( Mr. E. McCarthy), the Assistant Comptroller-General of Customs
( Mr. C. E. Morton), the Commercial Counsellor, Australian Embassy,
Washington ( Mr. J. U. Garside), Messrs. J. G. Phillips of the Commonwealth
Bank's London office ( representing the Treasury), G. A.
Rattigan ( Department of Trade and Customs), C. L. Hewitt ( Departinent
of Post-war Reconstruction) and G. W. Smith ( Department of
Commerce and Agriculture).
" The work of the conference will be concerned mainly with the
consideration of a draft charter for an International Trade Organization.
This draft charter has been drawn up by a preparatory Committee
of eighteen countries, including Australia, which was set up by
the Economic and Social Council for the purpose early in 1946. The
preparatory committee has had two sessions-at London towards the
end of 1946 and more recently at Geneva. A special drafting cominittee
examined the text evolved at London before the full committee
reconsidered it at Geneva. The draft charter will now come before the
representatives of other countries which were not represented earlier.
If the work of the world conference is successful and sufficient
governments adopt the draft charter, the establishment of an International
Trade Organization, guided : by the principles of the charter,
should follow in due course."

TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT-PREPARATORY COMMITTEE,
MINISTER'S STATEMENT.
In Parliament.-On 29th October, 1947, the Minister for Post-war
Reconstruction ( Mr. Dedman) said-
" 1 make a brief statement in relation to tariff negotiations at
Geneva in which an Australian delegation has been engaged for some
time. Since April, 1947, the delegation has been conducting negotiations
with the re. presentatives of seventeen other countries for the
readjustment of tariffs and preferences on a mutually advantageous
basis. These negotiations have reached finality and the results are
being incorporated in a draft general agreement on tariff and trade 
which is to be laid before the governments concerned for their consideration.
The large number of countries concerned involves certain practical
difficulties which have to be overcome. In the first place, it is
virtually impossible to keep proposed tariff changes completely confidential
for an indefinite period. Publication of the results in one
country before release in another could be very embarrassing.
Moreover, if the published rates differed from those at present
in force complications would arise because of the desire of
traders to wait for lower rates of duty. Further, the several
countries concerned have a variety of procedures for putting trade agreements
into force. To overcome those difficulties, a method has been
devised to provide for the simultaneous publication of the draft general
agreement on tariffs -and trade, and for the provisional application
of that agreement by the governments concerned. The countries concerned
may, instead of adopting the agreement outright, agree to apply.
provisionally, its provisions, including the tariff schedules. Their legislatures
will then -be able to examine the agreement and decide whether
or not it should be adopted.
Provided the requisite number of governments concur and notify
the Secretary-General of the United Nations by 15th November, 1947,
that they are prepared to adopt, provisionally, the draft agreement, the
text will -be published on 18th November, 1947.
The Australian Government believes that the proposed agreement
will prove advantageous to Australia. Accordingly, it has decided to
accept and . apply, provisionally, the draft general agreement on tariffs
and trade. The following procedure will be followed: On 30th October,
1947, the final act of the Geneva conference will be signed for the purpose
of authenticating the text of the draft general agreement. On or
before 15th November, 1947, the Government will inform the Secretary-
General of the United Nations that it is prepared to accept and apply,
provisionally, the general agreement on tariffs and trade. On 18th
November, 1947, if the requisite number of governments have decided
to accept the general agreement on tariffs and trade provisionally, the
agreement will be published simultaneously in the countries concerned.
On that date, the Australia -Government will lay the agreement on the
table of the House, and introduce the necessary tariff motion. The new
rates will become operative provisionally from that date.
Later, after conclusion of the Havana conference and within six
months of the tabling of the draft agreement, the Government will
decide whether Parliament is to be asked to confirm the agreement and.
if it so decides, will seek Parliament's approval for this course.
A statement on all phases of the Geneva conference will be made to
the House later in this session. For reasons I have outlined, it is not
possible, before the date agreed on for publication, to give any details
of the concessions made. However, I can assure the House that the
Government is convinced that the draft agreement will create new
export opportunities of great value to Australia. Throughout the 
negotiations the Government has maintained the closest collaboration
with other members of the British Conunonwealth. The agreement
takes full account of the legitimate interests of both . primary and
secondary industries in this country; and, in relation to imperial preferences,
the agreement conforms to the policy enunciated ' by the Government
from time to time in this House.
Beyond these assurances, it would be improper for me to go at this
stage. Further, speculation is likely to be misleading and embarrassing
to all governments concerned. The Government, therefore, invites the
co-operation of the House and of the press until publication becomes
possible.' FOURTH SECURITY LOAN.
PRIME ~ VINISTER'S OPENING BROADCAST.
On 28th October, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) broadcast
over the national network. Mr. Chifley said-
Good evening ladies and gentlemen,
The Fourth Security Loan of Å“ 80,000,000 will be opened on 29th
October, 1947. The people of Australia are asked to subscribe
Å“ 48,000,000 for the programme of Commonwealth and State works
approved by the seven governments and for the rehabilitation of
former mem. bers of the fighting forces.
In addition, holders of securities in loans floated in the early years
of the war to a total of Å“ 32,000,000 are asked to convert their holdings
into new bonds in the Fourth Security Loan. Therefore, the loan which
will be opened to-morrow is for a total of Å“ 80,000,000 and, in the name
of the Commonwealth and State Governments of Australia, I ask that
it be over-subscribed.
The two financial operations involved in this loan-namely, the
subscription of new money and the conversion of old bonds-are a
vital part of the over-all economic policy being followed by the Australian
Government.
" That policy has been followed with the dual purpose of maintaining
the economic balance in this country and of ensuring that Australia,
as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, can fully
play her part for the welfare of all member nations and of Britain in
particular. The Australian Government's economic policy during the war
years and in post-war years that have followed have been amazingly
successful. To-day, the Australian Å“ 1 purchases more for the Australian
citizen in Australia than the American dollar does for Americans
or the Å“ 1 sterling does for the people in the United Kingdom.
Further, Australia is one of four nations in the world whose price rise
has ' been the lowest. 
Those two facts demonstrate very clearly that the Commonwealth
Government's economic policy has resulted in the maximum welfare for
Australian men and women as individuals and for Australia as a
nation. You, the people of Australia, are asked to ensure the smooth
continuance of that policy by an over-subscription for the Fourth
Security Loan.-By so doing, you will make a contribution not only to
your own security but will maintain Australia's economic strength so
that she can continue to be a strong right arm for Britain in her
struggle. As you know, the Australian Government has laid down a . policy
of the . fullest possible assistance to the United Kingdom on the following
lines:-Export of the greatest volume of foodstuffs.
A gift of Å“ 23,000,000.
Export of current Australian gold production so that Britain
can use it to buy dollars.
Severe restrictions on Australian use of dollars.
The success of the Fourth Security Loan is essential so that the
policy I have outlined to you may , be maintained. I ask you to oversubscribe
the amount asked for in new money-Å“ 48; 000,000-and to
convert fully the Å“ 32,000,000 of securities from earlier loans. The
loan will open to-morrow and I am fully confident that you will play
your part as Australians."

NATIONAL MAPPING COUNCIL.
COMM YWEALTH SURVEY COMMITTEE.
On 28th OctoL:. r, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
In 1935, Cabinet appointed the Commonwealth Survey Committee
comprising the Surveyor-General, chairman, and representatives
of the three defence services to bring about co-ordination of survey work
in Australia. In 1940, a representative of the Department of Civil
Aviation was appointed and in 1944 a representative of the Department
of Post-war Reconstruction was co-opted. In 1945, Commonwealth and
State Governments -agreed to the formation of a National Mapping
Council to ensure the co-ordination of mapping activities.
Cabinet decided to-day to re-constitute the committee to provide
for the Commonwealth Surveyor-General, who is also Director of the
National Mapping Council, as chairman, and a representative of each
of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the three service
departments, the departments of Civil Aviation, Post-war Reconstruction
and Supply and Shipping. The committee's function will be to
recommend, through the Minister for the Interior, such action as is
needed to co-ordinate the activities and requirements of Commonwealth
Departments in respect of mapping and ground and air surveys."

TRADING WITH ENEMY.
GERMANY-RESUMPTION.
On 28th October, 1947, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice)
announced that the control authorities of the combined British-United
States zone in Germany were now permitting the entrance of limited
numbers of Australian businessmen to buy Oerman goods. Buyers
would be admitted into the zone for periods not normally exceeding
fourteen days. Because of the small quota allotted to Australia, sponsorship
would be accorded only to those businessmen who desired to
purchase goods considered essential in the national interest. Selection
for sponsorship would take into account the range and quantity of goods
available for export from Germany and the limitations on imports imposed
by the Australian import licensing system.
( For earlier references, please see No. 175, page 27.)
MOTOR CAR PRODUCTION.
CAR -CHASSIS IMPORTS.
On 30th October, 1947, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice)
s~ aid that on 2nd September, 1947, it was -announced that imports for
North American motor vehicle chassis for 1948 would be reduced by
per cent, as against the quantities authorized for importation during
1947 and that the allocation of the cut to the various makes and models
of chassis would he considered by an inter-departmental committee on
which the trade would be represented. In the light of the subsequent
deterioration in the dollar situation, the Government had reconsidered
the matter to effect further economies. It had been decided that the
maximum amount be allotted for the importation of motor vehicle
chassis from the United States and Canada during 1948 was
Å“ A. 8,000,000. It has been decided to abandon the former system of
allocating quotas on a quantitative -basis and to fix a total c. i. f. and e.
ceiling value for each make and model of chassis. It would be necessary
to impose the condition that the value of the chassis to'be imported
during the first half of 1948 be not more than half the approved quota
value. ( For earlier -references, please see No. 125, page 29; No. 128, page 33.)
WAR H ISTORY.
WAR INDUSTRIES.
On 4th November, 1947, the Minister for the Interior ( Mr.
Johnson) announced that Dr. D. P. Mellor, of Sydney University, had
been chosen to write the volume of the Australian official war history
dealing with war industries and the application of scientific research
to war-time needs. Re succeeded Dr. A. S. Fitzpatrick who was unable
to continue the work.

JAPAN.
WAR CRIMINALS-SIR WILLIAM WEBB'S RETURN.
On 4th November, 1947, the Prime Minister. ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" At my request, the Australian Government's representative on the
International Military Tribunal at Tokio ( Sir William Webb) has
arranged to return to Australia alriost imnmediately. This ivill enable
him to take his seat on the High Court Bench for the forthcoming
Sydney sittings. Sir William will return to Tokio, if necessary, ( luring
the summer vacation to complete his work as president of the tribunal.
" A seventh justiceship was restored to the High Court in April,
1946. When Sir Willi-am was appointed in May, 1946, it was anticipated
that his work at Tokio would last only a few months longer. The
trials have been unexpectedly long and Sir William ha~ s so far been
unable to assume his judicial duties here."

TRANSITION.
CONTROLS-FURTHER BILL INTRODUCED.
it. Parliament On 5th November, 1947, the Minister fox Post-war
Reconstruction ( Mr. Dedman) introduced the Defence ( Transitional
Provisions) Bill. Mr. Dedman said-
The purpose of this ' bill is to continue the operation for a further
period of twelve months of certain National Security Regulations, the
operation of which has already been prolonged by the Defence ( Transitional
Provisions) Act 1946 until the end of December, 1947. When
the Attorney-General ( Dr. Evatt) introduced the bill for that act he
dealt fully with the constitutional -basis for the bill. At that time, I
think that we all believed that by December, 1947, we should be able
to dispense with many of the regulations then in operation. However,
events have proved otherwise. Tihe principal reason is, that western
Europe has not succeeded in regaining a state of economic health. In
November, 1946, it appeared that the economic recovery of Europe
would not be unduly delayed, but since then Europe has experienced an
exceptionally severe winter, followed by a drought. During 1946, the
fact that the balance had been upset between the productive power and
resources of the western hemisphere, on the one hand, and those of the
rest of the world on the other, was obscured by the vast quantities of
goods poured into Europe by Unrra and other organizations. The disastrous
effects of winter and drought were followed by the dollar crisis.
Those events have had repercussions extending far beyond Europe;
indeed they threaten the foundations of world economy. In his speech in
1946, Dr. Evatt emphasized the need for the retention of measures designed
to check inflation and maintain stability. The Oovernment at
that time indicated its view that the operation of regulations covering
price control, rent control, capital issues, and land sales, would need to
be continued beyond December, 1947. The -bill makes provision for the
continuation of those regulations for a further twelve months. 
No one would argue that price control has not been highly successful
in helping to keep the economy of Australia steady. A comparison
of the figures of the cost of living in Australia to-day with those for
the period following World War and those of countries which have
abandoned price control, prove the wisdom of the Government's action
in continuing the operation of war-time price control regulations in the
post-war period. To-day, Australia is one of the countries which shows
the lowest increase of prices, and a comparison of living costs with
those of other nations where prices control has lapsed, or has never
been enforced, proves how well we have controlled the post-war boom.
The United Nations' monthly ' bulletin of statistics for September, 1947,
shows that Australia is only one in a list of 35 countries in which the
rise of wholesale prices since 1937 has been less than 50 per cent. The
same authority gives the following percentage increases of retail prices
from 1939, to June, 1947:-Australia 28; South Africa 39; Canada
32; United Kingdom 29; United . States of America 57; Argentine
Sweden 52; Switzerland 56; Spain 109; Ireland 70; Turkey 245;
Poland 15,010; and China 2,087,900. The indications are that during
1948, the Australian price level will be subjected to pressure, as it was
in 1947. By V. P. Day, export prices had increased by 78 per cent.
over pre-war prices, and by 183 per cent. by June, 1947. Import
prices rose by 99 and 147 per cent., respectively. There is no sign of
the increase of overseas prices steadying as yet, and there is no doubt
that a serious post-war boom is taking place in the international field.
Under these conditions it would not be wise to remove the existing
control over prices.
An attempt to control prices generally without controlling the land
values would because of the present state of demand, permit serious distortions
of the whole cost-price structure. Excessive land values would
greatly inflate the cost of home-building and would make the administration
of rent control extremely difficult, if not impossible. The effect
on rural industries must also be particularly serious. When producers
are receiving high returns for their products, speculation becomes rampant
and land changes hands at boom prices financed by mortgage loans.
Then, when export prices decline, many producers find themselves ' burdened
with debt and high costs. A long and painful re-adjustment becomes
inescapable; and the result is a general state of depression
throughout the rural industries. To prevent a repetition of such experiences,
and to prevent execessive land values from unduly inflating costs
generally, it is proposed to continue the control of land values for a
further twelve months under this bill.
" Speculative investments are not confined to land. At present there
is a large supply of capital awaiting investment, but it is impossible
for all of it to be employed without making inordinate demands on the
available resources of material and man-power. It is clearly desirable
that resources should be concentrated on essential production and not be
diverted to speculative or unnecessary enterprises. It is, therefore, proposed
to continue the Capital Issues Regulations.
7081.-3 
Rent control is a special aspect of economic controls, and its continuance
is rendered necessary by the present shortage of accommodation
of all kinds. It ensures a measure of stability where stability is
most needed. Its removal, and the removal of control over evictions
under present conditions, would result in inflation of rents, wholesale
evictions, exploitation and much misery.
" I mention briefly some marketing regulations which it is proposed
should be continued. The regulations under this group include those
relating to the control of barley, apples and pears, hides and leather,
potatoes, rabbit skins, as well as the acquisition of wheat and the
stabilization of the wheat industry. The reasons for continuing these
regulations are simply that the conditions which necessitated their
introduction are still with us, and the Commonwealth must keep the
faith with the primary producers. The detailed considerations differ
somewhat, depending on the commodity. In respect of the Australian
Barley Board, it was expected that legislation would be enacted by the
South Australian and Victorian Governments to carry on after the
end of 1947 the authority originally established by the Commonwealth,
but the sudden dissolution of the Victorian Parliament has delayed the
necessary legislation in that State, and the Commonwealth is accordingly
obliged to continue the regulations so that there will be no disorder
in the handling of the forthcoming crop. Refrigerated shipping
space for the apple and pear crops of Tasmania and Western Australia
is still inadequate, and hence the continuance of assistance is necessary
to protect the growers in those States. As regards potatoes, the Commonwealth
has let contracts to growers for the 1947-48 crop, and the
regulations are intended to control marketing until the crop
is sold. It is hoped that by the end of 1948 the organizations of the
States will be ready to take over potato marketing. Wheat regulations
are intended to cover the marketing of the 1947-48 crop. It has not
been practicable to reach agreement on a permanent marketing scheme
for the industry, but a further conference with the States will be held
shortly. Meanwhile the Commonwealth is continuing the Australian
Wheat Board in accordance with the desires of the growers and all
State Governments. In fact, no other organization could satisfactorily
market the crop. Controls over hides, leather and rabbit skins are
necessary mainly for price stabilization purposes, as the world prices
of these commodities greatly exceed the domestic prices. A limited
section of the food control regulations is preserved so that the distribution
of certain fats and oils can be equitably arranged, and also that
essential service supplies may be obtained.
There is a group of regulations which affect servicemen still serving
in the occupation forces in Japan. It is obviously necessary to
keep in force the Military Forces, Naval Forces and Women's Service
Regulations. There are still a few internees and prisoners of war in
Australia, and although very few are affected by them the provisions
by which their detention is regulated must remain in force. 
37
" Parliament has considered several bills dealing with industrial
conditions-notably the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration
Act, the Stevedoring Act and the Coal Act. These enactments go back
some distance in bringing back to a peace-time footing the framework
within which industrial conditions are settled. There are still, however,
fields to which attention has not been given, particularly the maritime
industry and the craft unionists employed in the coal industry. Pending
some further clarification in these fields, the existing regulations
must be preserved for a time.
Superphosphate regulations have been discontinued and the operation
of the Agricultural Aids Regulations restricted to a single item of
nicotine sulphate. The prospect of a record harvest has aggravated the
demand for both cornsacks and galvanized iron, and control over these
commodities must be continued for some time longer. While Britain's
position is so critical it is unthinkable for Australia to remove all
restrictions on commodities which are needed so badly there, and
accordingly ration schemes are being continued, particularly in relation
to meat and butter.
" About one do. en sets of regulations will be continued. They are
those under which war materials are being disposed of, war damage
claims settled, compensation with regard to requisitioned cargoes
assessed, property of enemy nationals administered, and the hundred
and one other things necessary to unwind the war effort. A good many
of the provisions of this sort cannot be dispensed with until the Treaty
of Peace is signed with Japan.
In 1946, a few amendments were made in permanent legislation.
This bill gives permanent expression in appropriate acts to some provisions
hitherto contained in National Security Regulations. The Acts
Interpretation Act is amended in two respects. One provision is made
to cover the case where the functions of one department are transferred
to another department. Reference to the former department or its
Minister will be read in an agreement as referring to the latter department
or its Minister. Secondly, there is a provision relating to delegation
of powers or functions. This provision permits the exercise of
powers or functions by a delegate in circumstances in which the exercise
of the power or function is dependent on the opinion, belief or state
of mind of the person exercising the power. An amendment made in
1946 to the Land Tax Assessment Act is continued for a further year.
This amendment continued for land tax purposes pegging of land values
which, up to that time had been pegged at 1939 values by regulation
under the National Security Act. The assessment of land tax on land
owned as at 30th June, 1948, will be based on the 1939 value.
" Action is being taken to amend the Defence Act by exempting from
jury service members of the Citizen Forces engaged on war service.
Probably the most important of these changes in permanent legislation
is the clause which repeals the National Registration Act. The Government
regards the National Registration Act as a type of legislation 
which is undesirable during peace-time. It is the policy of the Government
to embody in permanent legislation at the earliest possible date
provisions now contained in National Security Regulations and which
it is desirable shall have permanent effect as part of the law of the
Commonwealth. This bill is one of a group of about half a dozen bills
which deal with matters previously covered ' by National Security Regu-'
lations. Already the Dairy Produce Export Control'bill has been introduced
and one of the effects of its pas-sage would be that the Dairy
Produce Acquisition Regulations will be permitted to lapse at the end
of the year. The Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill contains a provision
permitting regulations to be made about patriotic funds, and
accordingly the Patriotic Funds Regulations will not be ' Continued next
year. Other legislation involving amendments to other acts is in train,
and will be introduced as early as possible. When thes3e bills are intro
duced, opportunity will be taken to place in permanent form some of
the provisions now carried on temporarily." [ Teblwapsed

POST-WAR-STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION, PAY AND
CONDITIONS.
In. Parliamtenl.-On 6th November, 1947, the Minister for Postwar
Reconstruction ( Mr. Dedman) said-
The following rates of pay for the higher ranks have now been
approved:-The active rate of pay for vice-admiral, lieutenant-general
and air marshal will be 130s. a day. The active rate of pay for rearadmiral,
major-general and air vice-marshal will be 105s. a day. For
the rank of commodore ( Royal Australian Navy), which is a nonsubstantive

JAPAN.
TRADE--PRIVATE TRADING.
On 6th November, 1947, the Minister for Customs ( Senator
(. ourtice) announced that arrangements had been completed for
Japanese nationals, or Allied or neutral nationals resident in Japan, to
be appointed to represent Australian buyers in that country. The
contract between the agent in Japan and the Australian businessman
must be authorized by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers
and licensed by the Japanese Board of Trade. All foreign exchange due
to Japanese nationals or firms a. the result of private trading transactions
must be paid to the board.

RECONSTRUCTION.
TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT-AGREEMENT.
In Parlilament.-On llth November, 1947, the Minister for Post-war
Reconstruction ( Mr. Dedman) said-
The recent Geneva negotiations are the latest phase of the programme
of international economic collaboration first foreshadowed in
the Atlantic Charter, and subsequently developed in Lend-lease, the
Mutual Aid Agreement, Unrra, the Food and Agricultural Organization,
the two Bretton Woods institutions and the economic machinery of the
I 1 
United Nations. They originated in an invitation issued by the United
States Government in 1945 to fourteen other important trading countries
to participate in two simultaneous sets of preliminary negotiations.
One of these was designed to draw up a draft charter, incorporating
rules to govern the future conduct of international trade, for submission
to a world conference on trade and employment with a view to establishing
an International Trade Organization. The other negotiations
were to give practical effect to the policy of expanding international
trade by bringing about a series of mutually advantageous trade agreements.
After the establishment of the United Nations organization, the
proposed charter negotiations were brought under United Nations
auspices by the acceptance of a resolution proposed by the United
States at the first meeting of the Economic and Social Council in
February, 1946. The council established a preparatory committee to
elaborate an annotated draft agenda for the consideration of a world
conference on trade and employment. Throughout the planning of the
United Nations economic machinery, it had been assumed that a
specialized agency would eventually be established to deal with international
trade-the most immediately important of all international
economic problems. The Economic and Social Council added three more
countries to those originally invited. They are-
United Kingdom, United States of America, the Union of Socialist Soviet
Republics, France. Belgium-Luxembourg. Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, Norway,
Lebanon. Canada. India. South Africa. New Zealand. Australia. China. Cuba,
Brazil and Chile.
The Union of Socialist Soviet Republics has not yet participated.
The first section of the Preparatory Committee thus set up was held
at London in October and November, 1946, and was preceded by an
exchange of views between British Commonwealth countries. This first
session had before it a set of draft proposals for an International Trade
Organization published by the United States Government in 1945, and
supported by the British Government, which had publicly expressed its
agreement on all important points. It had also to consider a more
elaborate draft charter subsequently published by the United States
Government on its own initiative. As a matter of convenience, and
largely because it was more detailed, the Preparatory Committee decided
to adopt the latter draft, together with less comprehensive proposals put
forward by other delegations as the ' basis for discussion.
The United States draft proposals were very substantially modified
in the course of discussion, and new sections were added, but time prevented
more than a hasty exchange of views on some significant questions.
The rough text of a possible trade charter was drawn up and
included in the first report of the Preparatory Committee to the
Economic and Social Council. A drafting committee was appointed to
examine this text in detail, and to recommend drafting changes. The
drafting committee met at New York in February and March, 1947,
and the resulting text became the basis for the second and final session
of the Preparatory Committee at Geneva which recently concluded. I 
propose to deal later with questions of the draft charter for the International
Trade Organization, which will be the subject-matter of the
coming World Trade and Employment Conference at Havana.
Meanwhile, both for convenience and because the governments of
a number of countries felt strongly that the two sets of negotiations
were essentially interdependent, the first session of the Preparatory
Committee recommended to the Economic and Social Council that the
tariff negotiations for which the United States Government had issued
invitations should also be brought under United Nations auspices. As a
result, tariff negotiations began at Geneva on 10th August, 1947, about
a month before the resumption of the charter discussions. Both tariff
and charter negotiations were preceded by British Commonwealth discussions.
The pre-tariff talks at London in March, 1947, dealt largely
with the likely repercussions of the tariff negotiations on imperial
preference, ' but those on the charter at Geneva covered the issues in
rather more general terms.
The tariff negotiations have been quite distinct from the charter
discussions, and the aim has been to bring the results into effect without
necessarily waiting for the establishment of the International Trade
Organization. The results have been incorporated in a Draft General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for the consideration of governments,
which will be published on 18th November, 1947, and which the Government
ha. s decided to apply provisionally from that date. Until it is
published it is impossible to deal with the negotiations except in general
terms. The governments of all countries, members of the Preparatory
Committee, are invited to become parties to the agreement. This
generalization will extend the scope of the benefits to be received, and
as a result Australia will obtain the benefit of the reductions negotiated
among the other sixteen countries in addition to those negotiated by
itself. Some of the former reductions are of little benefit, : but others
will provide worthwhile benefits. In some countries these indirect benefits
are considerable, and, taken on the aggregate, they represent a
general extension of export opportunities for Australia. The agreement
is in three parts. Part I. contains-
The schedules of tariff reduction whici have beer, negotiated by all the
countries concerned.
An undertaking to extend imost-faiured-inatior treatment to other parties
except for existing preferences which are formally recognized as valid to the
extent that they have not been altered in the current negotiations.
Part II. contains undertakings regarding commercial policy. These
are necessary primarily to prevent tariff concessions granted being offset
by other protective measures and follow closely chapter IV. of the
draft charter. In practice they involve no significant change in Australian
commercial policy. In particular they preserve-
The right to impose new duties or protective purposes except where we
specifically have accepted. or niny accept. as binding in tariff negotiations.
The right to impose import restrictions to protet our balance rf payments. 
Tih riiht ti jili' v'c stcitbilization scl iihemeiC fiir primary pruodUcts at present
op[ eratillg ill AItttralita. and the right to cstallli h suclih schemI es for other produictilln
i ilar circ ilusltances.
The right to take eCICIrgIelcy acti] ol if illy industry is enltdangered by any t: lriti
or ir'tferelcll redtuctil nelgotiated.
Part 111. contains mainly machinery provisions.
If finally ratified, the agreement will run for three years but will
continue thereafter unless it is specifically terminated. Special provisions
protect our right to withdraw particular items which, in changed
circumstances, we may wish to protect further without terminating the
whole agreement.
If changes are made in the draft charter at the Havana Conference,
it is proposed that relevant parts of the agreement would be amended
accordingly unless the parties to the agreement decide otherwise, and
consequently countries applying the agreement provisionally are
expected to carry out Part II. only to the extent permitted by existing
legislation. The negotiations have been conducted against an economic backgroundi
dominated by the slow recovery of war-devastated countries, and
by the world-wide shortage of dollars. United States' exports in 1945
aind 1946 totalled 26,000,000,000 dollars, compared with imports of
9.000,000,000 dollars. For 1947 the figures up to 31st July were
8.700,000,000 dollars and 3,300,000,000 dollars. There can be no world
economic stability until the United States spends abroad on direct purchases
of imports a greater proportion of her international income.
The results of the negotiations as a whole must, therefore, be judged
primarily hy their effect on the trade relationship between the United
States and tle rest of the world. While it is easy to exaggerate the effect
of tariff reduction, it is clear that a serious endeavour has been made t
open the United States' market to imports. The effect of this should be
apparent as soon as producion in countries other than the United Stat: e
reaches levels capable of taking advantage of the changes.
On the other hand, the agreement permits the maintenance of
quantitative restrictions for balance of payments reasons and until
dollars. ire available also permits discrimination against United State.-
goods. So long ns the present international payments difficulties being
experienced by practically all countries except United States persi: t.
the United States cannot expect to benefit fully from concession. s
granted to it. The agreement as a whole, therefore, should be a significant
contribution to a restoration of a more reasonable balance between
dollar and non-dollar payments.
Britain hopes to improve its direct dollar earning. by increased
exports to United States and indirectly by concessions granted by tbhe
United Sta'es to other countries. Similarly, any stimulus to European
recovery is of value to Britain. Any strengthening of Britain's position
is. of course, of great value to Australia since it increases Britain's
international purchasing power, on which we are very dependent. 
I summarize briefly the direct and indirect benefits which may be
expected to accrue as a result of the proposals arising from the Geneva
negotiations if they are confirmed by the respective governments concerned.
The tariff concessions affecting Australian exports take the
form of actual reductions in existing rates of duty, or, where duty-frep
entry or low duties already operate, the binding of such duty-free entry
or low rates. In many items such binding is of material value because
of ; he insurance it gives against increases in tariff rates which now
tand at low levels. Tariff concessions have been offered to Australia on
almost all the principal products which Australia exports or can expect
to export, to the individual countries concerned. Generally, the offers
have been made directly to Australia, but in some cases the benefits wiil
arise indirectly from offers made to a third country which is a more
important supplier of the particular product. The concessions should
lie of real importance in relation to the future development of primary
production in Australia. Further, they include items of importance to
Australian secondary industry.
Trade opportunities may also be expected to arise in respect of a
number of products of export interest to Australia on which tariff con
ccssions have been offered to other countries. Indirect benefits will al-o
affect a wide range of manufactured products in which there is oppor
tunity for expansion of Australian production and exports. The reductions
of duties obtained in the course of the present negotiations are
important, not only in themselves, but also by reason of the fact that
they ensure a relatively advantageous starting point for futurein egotiations.
This is specially important in the case of the United States.
where a 50 per cent. reduction in duties is the imaximumn cut perminssible
in any one agreement under the United States Reciprocal Trad-
.\ greements Act. It is only by such negotiation. that high d; itie can
hle progressively reduced to reasonably low level.
To secure the above-mentioned benefits, Australia ha. s been obliged
to offer some concessions. These have taken the form of concurrence
in the reduction of certain preferences at present enjoyed in Empire
countries and of ecneessiun in the Australian tariff. Both were
unavoidable. We cannot expect to obtain the advantage of such negotiations
without making some concessions ourselves. In assessing the outcome,
it is essential to have regard to the likely effect on the Australian
economy. We have not concurred in any proposed reductions in preferential
margins except where such concessions are considered to be
within the capacity of the Australian industries affected and where
-alti4factory compensation concessions have been offered in return. The
other concession which Australia was required to make in return for tin
benefits offered were in the protective tariff. Most of the concessions
proposed are individually small but they cover a very wide field. The
Government has every confidence in the ability of Australian industry
to withstand the concessions. Prices levels in Australia have risen 
much less than in most overseas countries. This has resulted in Au. iiralian
industries enjoying greater competitive advantages and an
ability to compete within the shelter of a lower tariff wall than that
provided by the present Customs Tariff.
If the draft general agreement is eventually adopted by Australia it
is not likely to result in any substantial increase in imports into
Australia in competition with Australian production, and, where such
increase does occur, it is likely to be absorbed by greater demand and
consequently not affect Australian industry. The lower duties on goods
which are imported will tend to reduce prices, and this, together with
any increased supplies of goods, will be a useful offset to inflationary
tendencies in the economy. The narrowing of the margins of preference
at present enjoyed by Britain, Canada and New Zealand on a number of
items may affect to some extent the advantage which these countries
had had in the Australian market, but in no case has a contractual
margin of preference been reduced except with the consent of the country
enjoying preference rights under the Australian Customs Tariff.
It is to the outcome of our negotiations with the United States
that the Government attaches paramount importance. This market,
whatever its vicissitudes, is by far the world's greatest. It matches an
industrial output which is at least equal to that of the rest of the entire
world. Even since the outbreak of World War II. the population of the
United States has increased by almost double the total population of
Australia. At the same time rising living standards and soaring
incomes have greatly increased average purchasing power per head.
It is a country where agricultural costs, despite increasing efficiency,
steadily outpace those of other countries. At the prices at which we
could afford to supply, the American public would buy a , very much
larger quantity of foodstuffs. But in recent years exorbitant tariffs
have barred the way to meeting this demand.
" A significant section of Australian industry is geared to dollar
imports, without which, as we are finding now, our industrial capacity
is handicapped. Further development in the future will require much
greater supplies of dollars for the purchase of equipment and essential
supplies. Not only Australia, but also the whole sterling area is starved
for dollars. The only way to increase the supply permanently is to
increase exports to the United States. Any increase in our earnings
would benefit not only us but also nearly all our best customers. It
would help to redress the world balance against the dollar. The
cardinal point of our policy throughout the negotiations has been to
break down this great barrier to the further expansion of Australia's
greatest primary industries. Throughout the inter-war period market
factors, not technical, inhibited their growth. Wool, beef, butter and
lamb were all held back by the closure of the American market not
only to our produce but also to that of our competitors. When one
looks beyond the immediate dislocation and exceptional circumstances
of to-day, to the market prospects of coming years, two factors stand
out-shrinking markets in western Europe, including Britain, 
and a growing one in the United States. The population of western
Europe is likely to start declining within a few years accompanied
probably by stationary if not falling income per capita. To make
matters worse, Britain, our main market for foodstuffs, is embarking
on policies of increasing self-sufficiency. This will in turn increase
its production costs and weaken its competitive power still further, thus
lessening its international purchasing power upon which we have
depended so heavily in the past. Dislocation in Asia, too, is likely to
reduce the flow and increase the price of many of the foodstuffs and
raw materials needed to sustain the industry and purchasing power of
western Europe.
Very different trends are manifest in America. So convinced has
the Government been of the necessity to break down the barriers to all
exports to the United States, not only of foodstuffs, that for a while,
as became well known, we risked a breakdown of the whole of the
Geneva negotiations in the period immediately preceding the veto by
President Truman of the United States Congress bill to increase wool
duties. In short, if the draft agreement is accepted by the governments
concerned, it should make a significant contribution to a solution of the
problems created by the world-wide shortage of dollars. It should
materially assist Britain in its economic difficulties and thus help to
maintain its international purchasing power, and above all it holds out
the prospect of greatly increasing our earnings of foreign exchange by
extending the range of our export opportunities, especially in the
United States, thus paving the way for the further expansion and
development of Australian primary and secondary industries.
Although our negotiations with the United States of America
overshadow the rest, the latter are in the aggregate of considerable
significance. We conducted negotiations with seventeen different countries,
including Britain, in relationship to which we are in a very
special position. The outcome of these negotiations will become
apparent when the general agreemen: on tariffs and trade is published
on 18th November. If and uhen the general agreement is accepted by
the requisite number of parties, an Interim Tariff Committee will be
established on which each accepting country will be represented on a
basis of equality. In due course, it is hoped that other countries will
negotiate sufficient tariff reductions to satisfy existing members and
thus qualify for membership of the Interim Tariff Committee. The
treatment to be accorded to non-members is still unresolved, but it is
likely to be as favorable as that extended to members at least until
they have had sufficient time to negotiate appropriate reductions and
have failed to do so. Eventually, if the International Trade Organization
is set up and the most important trading countries become n embers
of both the International Trade Organization and the Interim Tariff
Committee, the latter will be dissolved and its functions and membership
transferred to a tariff committee within the International Trade
Organization. Thereafter the Tariff Committee will be the competent
body for the conduct of all International Trade Organization activities
in regard to tariffs.

d ecade ofits ( ltr v into force.
The drcaft charter msq necessarily be assessedh to a coiisiderale
degree in terms of its applicability to culrrent economic conditions. It
was conceived originally, not as an interim instrument to meet the
immiediate problems of : he post-war transition period, but as A qvt of
guiding principles to governi thme conduct of international trade onl a
multilateral basis once normality had been restored. It isq clear 1now
that the scale of dislocation and the time necessary for recovery we
gravely underestimated. Relief and( recon-struction rather than eompetitive
intfernationaql trade are like to Ile -the magin object of international
attention in thle economic field for some time to come.
" The outstanding problems at pres ent revolve round -the deterioration
in Britain's trading position, formerly the pivot of international
trtide: the relapc~ of Fiurope after tile beginning of recovery, and( the 
11
cverance of ; he surplus food-producing capacity of the East from the
more industrialized West; and devastation and dislocation in Asia.
' ntil production and the supply of basic essentials in these areas can be
restored, they will be vitally dependent on North America, the only
area capable of dealing with the situation on the scale required, and
will be quite incapable of producing the surplus a ove e-sential needs
necessary to pay for the aid required. Thus, despite Unrra, the United
States loan to Britain and the other direct and indirect aid already
furnished by the United Statei on a huge scale, the shortage of dollars
persists. The United States is now the dominating force in international
trade, and while the demand for dollars so greatly exceeds tile supply,
disequilibrium in the payments position of other countries is likely io
continue. A reasonable measure of equilibrium in the balance ot
', aymnents of the main trading nations without widespread resort to
restriction however, a basic condition for the full application of the
ultimate International Trade Organization scheme.
Despite many obstacles, the projected organization could assist
rehabilitation considerably. In the first place, it would provide a
forum for the consideration of common problems in a conciliatory
spirit by acquainting the governments and their official advisers with
the problems of others which in sum are likely to add up to those of
rie trading world. The value of this understanding, often so grievously
lacking in the past, should not be under-rated. The will and practise
of co-operation between members in solving trading problems would,
in any case, be much more important than the governing rules, many
of lwhich are difficult to define in ways applicable to ail likely circumranees.
. Actually, the exceptions written into the charter are sufficient
to cover any measures likely to be necessary, even in the immediate
future. There is nothing to prevent the projected International Trade
Organization making a substantial and effective contribution to current
world problems from the moment it is established.
" Secondly, the main principles of the International Trade
Organization charter, even if impossible of rigid applications now, are
a beacon for the future. They uphold multilateral trade as a desirable
goal, as soon as conditions permit. This aiming point should incline
members towards an integral system, away from the exclusive trading
blocs which have proved so politically and economically expensive in
the past.
" Thirdly, in conjunction with the tariff reduction programme, it
would help to restore the balance of the re. st of the world with the dollar
area, by weakening restrictions on imports into the United States,
while permitting other countries to ration available dollars in accordance
with their needs, until they can earn enough to dispense with such
in pediments to expansion. A careful scrutiny of the charter will
reveal that the only really important trading country which will be
subject to all the restraints which it imposes on the conduct of commercial
policy for a long time to come is the United States. That
rountry will he extending negotiated tariff reductions to others which I 
have been granted in exchange for concessions by other countries which
they, in many cases, will be unable to reciprocate. Balance of payments
restrictions, imposed within the provisions of the charter, will
prevent their extending many concessions made to the United States,
virtually until the present widespread dollar difficulties have been
overcome. Nearly all other members of the International Trade
Organization would be able to apply measures forbidden to the United
States because of its uniquely favorable position. Apart from temporary
difficulties, the more permanent escape clauses, especially those
designed in Chapter III. to facilitate industrial development in less
advanced areas, are not ones that are likely to be open to the United
States. Likewise, the measures envisaged by the charter in the event
of a failure to maintain employment, or in cases when one country's
payments position is causing widespread difficulties to others, all relate
primarily to the United States. The fact that such a charter should
be agreed upon by representatives of the United States reveals a
realistic understanding of the problems of the rest of the world which
is not only a far-sighted and enlightened gesture in this context, but
also a most hopeful augury for the future of the projected organization.
It is too soon to judge the likely effect of the charter on Australian
interests. The final draft has yet to emerge from the Havana
conference, and even then to be subsequently approved by the governments
concerned. It will have to be examined eventually in conjunction
with the overall programme which embraces the general
agreement on tariffs and trade. Even at this stage, though the
Government is in no way committed, it tay be appropriate to refer
to a number of factors likely to be relevant later when deciding whether
or not to join the International Trade Organization. I deal with a
few questions of particular concern to Australia. First, there is the
future of Imperial preference, which is, for us, a question of hard
economic reality. The effect of article 16 of the draft charter is to
Ã¸ preserve intact the existing British preferential system. There is no
obligation anywhere in the draft charter to reduce or eliminate any
margin of preference except by agreement of all the parties concerned.
It is clearly envisaged that any such action will be taken only in return
for equivalent tariff concessions by other countries as part of a mutually
advantageous bargaining process. At the same time, no new preference
may be created. Actually, no other British country has extended
any new preference of importance to Australia for many years, and,
in any case, the British Government is formally committed against
such a course, while it is well known that Canada concurs in this
attitude. British countries, and others already operating preference
systems, may thus continue to enjoy differential trading advantage.
in each other's markets, and even barter them for tariff concessions,
while only in very exceptional circumstances can other countries start
new systems between themselves. The creation of mutual preferences
by other countries which would discriminate against British trade, and
thus arouse our resentment, just as the discrimination applied by us 
arouses theirs, would be quite a likely development in the near future
unless the draft charter comes into operation and prevents it. The
attitude of the representatives of certain other countries at Geneva
clearly revealed this possibility.
In connexion with preference, the Government has borne constantly
in mind the future of settlement in the northern parts of the continent,
particularly Queensland which is dependent on the sugar industry.
It will be noted that sugar is subject to an international agreement and
consequently comes under the provisions of Chapter VI. Commodities;
those of Chapter IV., Commercial Policy, do not apply. The important
embargo and other devices used to protect sugar are not called into
question by the draft charter. It is recognized generally that different
considerations must be applied to the marketing of manufactured and
primary products because of the essential differences in the economic
factors which govern them.
Another important instrument of Australian economic policy are
the stabilization schemes for the marketing of primary products. In
a number of cases, these depend on differential prices, prices between
home and overseas sales and the periodic operation of subsidies in
various forms. Without entering into a detailed explanation now, I
point out that all our present schemes would be permitted under the
terms of the draft charter.
" From the more general point of view, the existence of some
international body to determine the lines on which international trade
shall be conducted seems to offer considerable advantages to Australia.
Such a body would almost inevitably increase the influence of small
and medium-sized countries, giving them a voice in decisions and
enabling them to play an important part in affairs from which they
would otherwise tend to be excluded. Without it, important decisions
would be made by the giants in concert and small countries would be
grouped around and dominated by them. The embryonic International
Trade Organization charter already bears considerable imprint of
Australian ideas. Our delegation has been enabled to play a constructive
part at every stage of the deliberations.
From the economic stand-point, Australia is highly dependent on
international trade. Only through this medium can many of our
industries be kept working and the living standards of our people
improved. Order rather than cut-throat chaos suits our purposes and
our resources. Our interests lie especially along the lines of flexible
multi-lateral trade. We need new markets to pay for the imports
which our development requires. Our old markets are located mainly
in Britain and Europe, the relative world economic importance of
which is declining. The population of western Europe will begin to
decline sharply within a few years and this will limit its need for our
foodstuffs. Our main avenues of development, partictularly for the
export of manufactured goods, point in new directions. It would be 
foolish to allow old habits of thought to hide ail signposts to the future.
In such a changing world, it may be important for us to be able to meet
our future customers regularly round the conference table to dis.; use
our reciprocal needs and wishes.
We have a particularly strong interest in the maintenance of a
high and stable demand for our export products. The employment
provisions of the charter are an important psychological factor as well
as an ' escape' clause. They underline the source of demand for
exports and emphasize the bad neighbourliness of allowing preventable
unemployment. The commodity' provisions of the charter should
also assist in removing some of the instability from which we have
suffered in the past.
One of the main planks of Australian policy is industriilizatioll
and full development of our resources. While the original International
Trade Organization proposals might have resulted in certain
aspects of this policy being called into question, the latest draft stresses
the importance of such policies in ultimately furtheri worhl
prosperity, subject of course, to reasonable safeguards. ' Th iImu
trial development of other countries, especially those of wonul
enlarge Australia's potential export market. Another inpral. i t interest
of Australia is that of being able to protect our ec( uonv maT frll'
as possible against the impact of adverse worll conditionls \\ iht. it r ernational
measures fail, without incurring odillum elsewhere ) or provoking
retaliation. This is provided for by the charter. ThIe International
Trade Organization would provide for a forum for expressing
our views and explaining our position in sucl circuimsita ices.
For better or worse International Trade Organization is likely to , e
the only attempt to establish an international body in the trade sphelre
in this generation. If it is set up Australian interests will be markedly
influenced whether we go in or stay out. The Government is also
mindful of the implications of the International Trade Organization
programnme in the wide political sphere. The economic strife which
was both a product of and contributor towards the political rivalries
which eventually led to the recent war could easily revive unless positive
steps are taken to direct efforts along more enlightened channels.
The recent tariff negotiations at Geneva, though still to be adopted by
governments, do represent an example of international co-operation
in a sphere very susceptible to conflict. This is heartening in itself
at a time when so many aspects of international relations are unsatisfactory
and disturbing. Economic distress easily erupts into the major
poltical upheavals which eventually threaten the peace. The growth of
international co-operation on a functional basis to deal with the
practical problems facing the world is something which the Government
believes should be most actively encouraged. It will continue to
persevere in its efforts to secure the kind of International Trade
Organization charter which would be a significant contribution both
to material welfare and world peace." 
In Parliament.-The 19th November, 1947, the Minister -for
Commerce ( Mr. Pollard) said-
SIn accordance with the arrangements entered into at Geneva, the
provisional application of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
was made dependent on the signature by the following eight key countries
of the Protocol of Provisional Application, namely, Australia, Belgium
in respect of its metropolitan territory, Canada, France, in respect of its
metropolitan territory, Luxemburg, the Netherlands in respect of its
metropolitan territory, Britain in respect of its metropolitan territory,
, ind the United States. All eight countries have now signed the protocol
and the texts of the final act, the general agreement on tariffs and trade,
and of the protocol of provisional application were released by the
United Nations Organization for publication at 9.30 a. m. to-day
Australian eastern standard time.
The protocol was signed on behalf of the Australian Government
bY the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt) and the following
statement waz issued on behalf of the Government:-

WORLD ORGANIZATION-SOUTH PACIFIC COMMISSION,
INTERIM ORGANIZATION.
On 20th November, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said---
At the South Seas conference at Canberra in February, 1947, six
governments signed an agreement providing for the establishment of the
South Pacific Commission. The agreement is to enter into force
when it has been formally accepted by all governments. Acceptances
have been effected by the Governments of New Zealand, Australia and
Britain. Procedural diflicultiees have delayed the acceptances of the
Governments of the United States, France and the Netherlands, but it
i. s expected that These will be notified to the Australian Government
within the nlear future.
In the meantime, the Australian and New Zealand Governments
have by agreement with the other four governments, established a South
Pacific Commlission interim organization with head-quarters at . Sydney
to make preliminary arrangements for the establishment of the commission.
A meeting of representatives of all signatory governments will
be held at Sydney in November, 1947. This meeting will examine the
past and future work of the interim organization and, with a view to
expediting discussions at the first formal meeting of the commission,
which it is hoped will take place early in 1948, will discuss plans for the
structure of the secretariat of the coilnnisicn and related matters."

THE GOVERNMENT.
POLICY-NATIONALIZATION.
In Parliament.-On 12th November, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr.
Chifley) said-
" Representations have been received from various trades unions
regarding the nationalization of coal mines and the iron and steel
industry, and in reply I have pointed out that the Commonwealth Parliament
has no power under the Constitution to nationalize those industries,
even if the Government wished to do so. Therefore, it is sheer
nonsense to talk of the Government's plans for nationalizing suhi
industries." MINISTERS OF STATE-BILL INTRODUCED.
In Partiament.-On 19th Novembei, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr.
Chifley) introduced the Ministers of State Bill. Mr. Chifley said-
The purpose of this bill is to increase the salaries of Ministers of
State. The Constitution made a temporary provision of Å“ 12,000 per
annum for a maximum of seven Ministers, and left the way open for
Parliament to make increased provision, both as regards the number of
Ministers and the appropriation. On five occasions, increases have been
made because of increased responsibility. The last occasion was
in 1941, when the number of Ministers of State was increased from
eleven to nineteen and the appropriation to Å“ 21,250. That change was
made at the instance of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Menzies),
who was then Prime Minister.
Whereas the provision made in the Constitution 47 years ago was
an average of approximately Å“ 1,710 per minister, under subsequent
provision from time to time, the average has not only not increased in
keeping with rising costs but has actually been less than under the
original provision. In 1941 the average was Å“ 1,120, and there has
-been no increase in the meantime. The whole of the appropriation for
Ministers of State is not divided among the Ministers. A proportion is
paid to the Cabinet fund, to meet the expenses of Cabinet, and these
expenses have naturally increased. The ihcreasing responsibilities of
Ministers, the many additional calls on their financial resources, and the
rising costs, justify, in the opinion of the Government, some addition to
the salaries provision. The present measure proposes to increase the
appropriation from Å“ 21,250 to Å“ 27,650." [ The bill was passed.

FIGHTING FORCES.
AWARDS-U. S. DECORATIONS.
In Parliament.-On 12th November, 1947, the Minister for Defenc-.
( Mr. Dedman) said-
I inform the House of decisions on proposals communicated by tht
United States Government for the award of United States decorations
to members of the Australian Defence Forces. The Government 
received 229 proposals for the bestowal of United States awards which
required extensive examination and correspondence with the service
departments, and cablegrams to Britain, in the light of the rules
governing the acceptance of foreign honours. The Australian Government
has applied to the Australian forces the rules adopted by the
British Government and communicated to the Australian and other
British Commonwealth governments in 1942. One of the rules was that
the scale of acceptance of United States awards by inenmbers of the
Aius: ralian forces should, in general, be one acceptance for each British
award granted to United States forces in the South-West Pacific Area.
The Government represented to the British authorities that it would
be loath to contemplate the wholesale rejection of awards sponsored by
America for operational service for no other reason lthan that they
would involve a departure from a numerical . balance. Further, by
virtue of the close association of United States and Australian forces
throughout the war in the South-West Pacific Area, the Government
believed that it was fitting that acceptance of awards for operational
service should be permitted on a generous scale for the final series of
recommendations to mark the end of hostilities. The British authorities
have agreed with this view, and consideration of the proposals has
proceeded without regard to any of the limitations which would have
been imposed if the one for one rule had applied.
" The Government has accepted 102 United States award. for
gallantry or heroism, or for outstanding service directly in, or associated
with, operations in an operational area. They include awards for
Allied Intelligence Bureau parties which landed in enemy territory,
for intelligence patrols, heroism and good service in action, coast
watching in enemy territory, operational flights and strikes against
the enemy, the rescue of survivors of crashed aircraft in enemy territory,
and many other instances of gallantry and outstanding service in
operations. The Government has expressed its appreciation of the offer
of the United States Government and its pleasure in accepting them.
The Government regrets that it is unable to accept United States awards
in the following cases, and for the reasons stated:-
United States awardf, fir inon-optratiotal service, acceptance of which is
precluded by the policy of the ( Govemriiient, 21. ( These awards include
proposals f'or the rrecoPiition of service in Australia. with general headquarters,
and for ervicee in Washiiingtoni, all of which is non-operational.)
United States a wrds for pIer sonnl vwho have already received a British
award for the samile service. a'cept; nce of which nwould infringe the rule against
duplication of recoinition. 35. ( The ptrinciple of this rule is that service
rendcered during oiperations by a nilemtler of any British Commonwealth force
is more properly recognized by an awird by his own Sovereign than by acceptance
of foreign ioni( our. In noe of the-e euses have tlie services recommended that
: nl exception be made to the application of the rule against duplication of
iw ards.) United States awards for personnel in the following categories, acceptance of
which is recluded by tile rules ioverning the acceptance of foreign honours:-
Awards for services for which United Staltes decorations were previously
. ranted, five: Iposthumou s awards which, in the case of British awards, are
permitted only for the Victoria Cross and George Cros,. and mentions il
despatches and commenl dations,. six. 
The total number of award. s which, for the reasons already stated,
cannot be accepted, is 67. In certain cases, the proposed United States
awards have been deferred for further examination by the services as to
whether or not the service for which they are proposed was operational.
There are 60 cases in this category, mos; of them being for service with
general head-quarters, the greater proportion of which was on the
mainland of Australia." PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.
POULTRY FARMING-EGG EXPORT CONTROL, BILL
INTRODUCED.
In, Parliament.-On 12th November, 1947, the Minister for Commerce
( Mr. Pollard) introduced the Egg Export Control Bill. Mr.
Pollard said-
The purpose of this bill is to provide for the constitution of an
Australian Egg Board to regulate and control the export of eggs and
egg products from Australia. In July, 1943, responsibility for the
stabilization of egg prices and control of the marketing of eggs was
assumed by the Commonwealth Egg Control organization, constituted
under National Security ( Egg Industry) Regulations, and continued
in force under the Defence ( Transitional Provisions) Act 1946. When
this control ceases on 31st December, 1947, responsibility for marketing
of eggs will revert to State egg boards, which will be responsible for
stabilizing prices and marketing the production of their own States.
The Australian Government recently concluded a long-term contract
with . the British Government for the purchase of Australian eggs
in shell, egg pulp and egg powder for the seasons 1947-48, 1948-49
and 1949-50. To assist in the orderly marketing of the anticipated
surplus, and to ensure that the conditions of the long-term contract are
fulfilled, the Government has decided to establish an Australian Egg
Board, which will supervise the disposal of that portion of surplus
production which is of suitable quality for export. The bill provides
for the establishment of a board of ten members, who will represent the
following interests:-Egg Producers of Australia ( one from each
State), 6; persons with commercial experience, 2; employees engaged in
the handling, grading and processing of eggs, 1; Australian Government
representative, 1; total, 19." [ The bill was passed.

INDUSTRIAL.
DILUTION OF LABOUR-TRADESMEN'S RIGHTS, FURTHER
BILL INTRODUCED.
In Parliament.-On 12th November, 1947, the Minister for Labour
( Mr. Holloway) introduced the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Bill.
Mr. Holloway said-
This bill extends the principal provisions of the Tradesmen's
Rights Regulation Act 1946 to the trades in the boot, shoe, sandal and
1s4pper manufacturing industry which were subject to National Security
( Boot Trades Dilution) Regulations. 
The bill adds to the act another part and schedule, and makes
consequen'wial amendments, so that recognized tradesmen in the boot
trades shall be entitled to the same priority in employment in their
trades as recognized engineering tradesmen receive in the engineering
trades. That is to say, in the case of engagements, an employer may
not employ on tradesmen's work a person other than a recognized
tradesman if a competent tradesman is available and offering for
employment; and in the case of dismissals or retrenchments, Iby another
provision in the same section that a recognized tradesman shall be
the last to go unless a local comm: nittee otherwise permits and subject
to an employer exercising his award rights regarding summary
dismissal. " The bill provides for ex-servicemen to qualify as recognized
tradesmen by a probationary period of training in employment under
the supervision of a local ( boot trades) committee. These probationary
tradesmen will receive the full tradesman's rate of pay during their
probatonary period. Applications by ex-servicemen for authorization
of their employment as probationary tradesmen must be made, unless
there are special circumstances, within six -months after the date of
discharge from the forces or the same period after the coming into
operation of these amendments, whichever is the later.
[ The bill was passed.

IJNEMPLOYMENT-FIGURES.
On 25th November, 1947, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway)
said-For many months there has been a steady increase in the demand
for labour in Australia accompanied by a progressive decline in
unemployment. At October, 1947, recipients of unemployment benefit
( including re-employment allowance) had fallen to a record low level
of 2,945 ( 2,830 males and 115 females) representing less than one
in 11,000 Australian workers. Unfilled vacancies held by the Commonwealth
Employment Service numbered 52,200 for males and 35,200 for
females, an increase of nearly 7,000 above the September total.
It is difficult to find any occupation suitable for females in which
unfilled vacancies do not greatly exceed available applicants. For
example, in the clothing and textile trades the number of vacancies for
women workers approaches 15,000.
" During October, 1947, the Commonwealth Employment Service
referred 20, S00 males and 6,500 females to employers."

On : 12' th November, 1947, the Minister for Customs ( Senator
Courtice) announced that price control of live poultry had been
removed. 
INCOME TAX.
SECOND BOARD OF REVIEW.
On 12th November, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
An additional Board of Review has been established under the
Income Tax Assessment Act.
The functions of the Board of Review, although primarily associated
with income tax, have, from time to time, been extended to
include matters arising under sales tax, pay-roll tax, war-time ( company)
tax, social services contribution, flour tax and entertainments
tax, as well as estate and gift duties. The volume of cases referred for
determination has been such that one board has been unable to cope
with it within a reasonable time.
The new board will comprise the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation
( Mr. H. H. Trebilco), chairman, Mr. J. A. Nimmo, and Mr. R. A.
Cotes. Appointment will be for seven years from 1st December, 1947.
For the present, this board will deal with cases arising in Victoria,
South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. The existing
board will dletermine cases arising in New South Wales and
Queensland. Both boards have been constituted Boards of Referees under the
War-time ( Company) Tax Assessment Act."

CONSTITUTION.
AMENDMENT-REFERENDUM, PRICES, BILL
INTRODUCED.
In Parliament.-On 19th November, 1947, the Minister for Labour
( Mr. Holloway) introduced the Constitution Alteration ( Rents and
Prices) Bill. Mr. Holloway said-
To safeguard the Australian people from inflation and depression,
and to keep in check the profiteer and the racketeer, are nation-wide
problems. They can be solved only by nation-wide action. The object
of the bill is to amend the Constitution so as to give to the National
Parliament the necessary powers. The bill proposes to give it the
power to make laws with respect to ' rents and prices ( including
charges) The powers will have to be exercised particularly throughout the
present critical years or transition from war to peace. But the need
for their exercise will not lapse when the transition is completed,
however far ahead that may be. They will be needed again from time
to time, whenever economic conditions become unstable. The object
of the bill is to give permanent, nation-wide protection to every tenant,
every income-earner, every housewife, to every user of services and,
indeed, to every purchaser as well as to primary producers dependent
on unsheltered markets.
" The proposed new power is one to make laws first and foremost
about rents. In an economic sense, rents are only a particular group
of prices. But there must be no doubt whether they are included in
the power. They are a vital element in the life of the people. In
the first place, rent absorbs a large proportion of the income of most
families. Unless rents are kept at a reasonable figure, other forms of
price control will not be effective to maintain the living standards of
the community. Moreover, the shortage of housing is likely to last
longer than other shortages, and rent control will therefore be essential
for a long time. 
A vital duty of a national government is to give its people that
freedom from fear and want held out to them in the Atlantic Charter
as one of the aims which made the sacrifices of the war worth while.
I will show that the power to control rents and prices is a power without
which the Commonwealth Parliament will be severely handicapped
in carrying out this duty in the economic sphere. The Australian
Government is convinced that the people should be given the opportunity
to arm themselves, through their Parliament, with essential
power. In the past, the economic security of the common man has been
menaced lv recurring economic depressions bringing in their train the
miseries nf unemployment and want. Those depressions have usually
been preceded by periods of unhealthy expansion, leading to inflation
and the crash from ' booin' to slump'. The horrors of war have
always been followed by tlhis cycle-scarcely less terrible in its effects.
In modern times, these economic troubles have not been coinfined to
single countries, but have been world-wide. They are the result of
mnan's activities or neglect, and it is within his power to prevent them.
lThe problem of recurring depressions must be tackled on a world-wide
basis, and Australia is playing its full part in the work being done in
rthis direction. But an important part of the problem must be tackled
within iiir own economy. Moreover, we must be ready to act quickly
whenmiever tlie necessity arise-. The vital thing is to see that ' boom'
condirions, ( if 1an unhealthy kind, which, as experience shows, lead to
depression, . shall not develop. Further apart from the prospect of
depression. another evil that must be fought vigorously in boom
times and in times when houses and goods are in short supply is the
evil of exploitation by profiteers. When money is plentiful among
some sections of the community and houses and goods are scarce, unscrupulous
landlords or vendors can, if not controlled, exploit the rest
of the contimmuity. Even in times when goods are plentiful, the
creation of monopolies leads to the same evil. We all know the
enormous profits made during and after World War I. Thanks to rent
and price control, there was much less profiteering in Australia during
World War II., but the sudden removal of these controls at present
would undoubtedly lead to profiteering. We have only to see what is
happening in other countries, such as the United States, to realize this.
In the United States, prices rose so steeply within a few months of the
removal of control, that an attempt is now being made to replace price
control. But with the flood-gates once opened who can say whether
they can he shut again?
No intelligent person would be so foolish as to think that all
fluctuations in rents and prices can be avoided. If costs, especially
eosts of imported goods and materials. are rising, prices must rise.
But the people rely on their government to ensure that the rises shall
be jiustificd. that increases of wages intended to improve living stanlards
shall do so and shall not be made the excuse for unreasonable
price and rent increases. I will show later that an essential weapon in 
the two battles against depression and exploitation is the power to control
rents and prices. I will also show that the States are not in a
position to handle those weapons effectively. The people will rightly
look to the National Parliament to grapple with these national
problems. The Government is confident that they will freely grant the
powers necessary to enable it to do so.
The bill does not mean that the Government considers that it will
be necessary to operate price control indefinitely, or to operate it in
the detailed and complete form to which we have become accustomed
over recent years. Price control in that form is necessary only in a
period of general excess of demand over supply, a condition which is
now being steadily removed. As shortages disappear, so can price control
disappear, until it will become essentially a reserve power, operating
only when and where it is required for the health of the economy.
Price control will be required beyond the transition period in relation,
for instance, to houses and rents, where shortages must be expected to
continue for some time. Where production of certain commodities is
under the control of monopolies, price control may be necessary to ensure
that the industry concerned shall apply a policy of high output, low
prices and moderate profits, rather than a policy of low output, high
prices and excessive profits. Similarly, where industries have been
granted tariff protection to enable them to carry on against overeas
competition, price control will be essential to ensure that this tariff
protection shall not be used to exploit local consumers.
Periods of expanding activity occure from time to time in any
economy, as a result, for instance, of the development of new public and
private investment. It will be possible for price control to check the
increase of prices that would other wise result from this pressure of
demand on resources of production. It is the effect on costs of this
increase of prices which has in the past led businessmen suddenly to
change their minds about undertaking new production, and which has
led to financial crises followed by prolonged depression. If price control
can prevent the development of this inflationary tendency, that
alone will be the greatest single factor contributing to the avoidance
of depression. In the other direction, continual difficulty has been
caused in the Australian economy by the violent collapses of overseas
prices for exports Price control cannot prevent these falls, but, when
drops occur, price control can, by maintaining minimum local prices,
help to cushion their effects of primary producers' incomes and on the
Australian economy generally.
i turn now to a consideration of the immediate need for rent and
price control in Australia during the period of transition from war to
peace. I need not draw in great detail the picture of what would happen
if the present rent control were removed. Although good progress is
being made with housing, there must inevitably be a shortage for a long
time. But while any shortage remains there must be protection for
home-seekers against extortionate charges for accommodation. After
World War rents rose steadily, right up to the beginning of the 
depression in 1929, by which time they were 50 per cent. higher than
in 1918. Even in normal times the rack-renter is always with us. L
am not saying that all landlords are grasping and unscrupulous-far
from it. But there are always some-and their number tends to grow
with opportunity-who are willing to take the last penny from people
whenever there is either a general shortage or a local shortage such as
occurs from time to time in particular places.
" On prices generally, there can be no doubt that external and
internal inflationary pressures will continue for some time. Prices of
imported goods are now more than two and a half times their pre-wr
level and are still rising. These cost inreases_ have been pressing
throughout the war, and have, thanks to price control, been absorbed by
the economy with a minimum of disturbance. Internal pressures are
equally strong. Income of primary producers, enjoying record
production and record prices, will be at an all-time high
level this year. Prices for exported goods are more than two
and a half times their pre-war level. There have been substantial
increases of the basic wage and of skill margins this year. Wage costs
will be still further increased by the adoption of the 40-hour working
week throughout Australia, on 1st January, 1948. There is, in addition,
a large volume of liquid balances accumulated by the people as a
result of war-timue shortages, and still awaiting spending. Prices control
has so far given owners of savings an assurance that the real value
of these balances will : be maintained. A threat to the continuance of
price stability, as a result of the cessation of price control, may cause a
wave of buying a, a hedge against inflation and thus bring about the
inflation that we fear. Against this high and increasing volume if
spending power, there is a serious deficiency of goods. Despite our high
export income, imports are held back by dollar shortages and the production
difficulties of easier currency areas. like Britain, Europe and
Asia. We may not be able to import even enough goods to balance our
exports, let alone to import surplus goods to meet excess spending
pressure. In the domestic sphere, production is at a high and
increasing level, but is still seriously short of the people's needs. The
postponement of capital replacement and expansion during the
war requires an abnormally large proportion of current production to be
devoted to the production of capital goods. In addition to this heavy
and continuing drain on resources to meet capital requirement, shortages
of labour and materials and the hangover of war-time disorganization
of production are causing bottlenecks in several lines of essential
production. An important feature of the Australian economy at present is the
substantial subsidies being paid by the Government to prevent cost
increases from passing into the price structure. An abrupt removal of
these subsidies, as would be required by the cessation of price control,
would cause an equally abrupt rise in prices. This represents an inflatinarvy
force which must be controlled until it can safely be released.
With all these inflationary forces at work in Australia, it cannot be 
doubted that an immediate relaxation of price control would lead inevitably
to price increases comparable with those that have occurred
recently in the United States. There, within five month. s of the
abandonment of price control, retail prices generally rose by 14 per
cent. and food prices by 29 per cent. Those figures should : be compared
with the increase of prices in Australia, where in the two years
since the end of the war, the rise have been only 6 per cent. for prices
generally, and 7 per cent. for food alone.
The war-time history of price control gives us firm ground for
confidence that it brings real advantages to the community and that it is
po.'-ible to administer price control successfully. Rent control during
the war was amazingly successful. Rents on an average increased by
less than I per cent. During World War retail prices rose by 32 per
cenlt. and two yea'rs later they were 70 per cent. above pre-war. During
World War II., they rose by 23 per cent., and two years later they are
only 30 per cent. above the pre-war level. World War II. lasted
six year-as againl-t four yrcars and involved a far greater strain oil
resource.-. rThpio'st -war | iriod has also been far more difficult, due : o
the greater dislocation in Australia and overseas. Apart from our own
arrears of civilian production, the war-torn countries of Europe and
Asia have not been able to make anything like their normal contribution
to our needs. Instead, they have been a drain on our supplies. In
spite of far greater shortages and disorganization of production, price
control has thus far saved Australia from the worst effect of a second
post-war boom. If it is continued through the transition period, we
may reasonably hope to avoid the worst effects of a slump such as
occurred in 1921.
Although, with the full concurrence of the State governments, the
Commonwealth assumed full power to control rents and prices at the
outbreak of the war. it has exercised these powers only to the extent
rendered strictly necessary : by circumstances arising out of the war.
During the first two and a half years of the war, for instance, only a
relatively frew commodities were made subject to control, because general
short:;: ze wcre not apparent until after the Pacific war broke oit.
When it i. s realized that the post-war boom lasted two years after World
War which was so much milder in its economic effect than World
War it can be understood why no great measure of de-control has
becn permitted up to the present stage, early in the third post-war year.
Nevertheless. the Government looks forward to the time when it will 1x'
able to lay down the burden of assessing most price increases, and t'i
revert to the state of affairs before the Japanese war, when only a
relatively small number of items was scarce and under control, and
traders did their own pricing under a formula, subject only to
occasional check.
" Recently. the Commonwealth Government has returned to State
and local governments control of goods and services handled by State,
semi-governmental and local-governing bodies, including tronsport, gas 
27
and electricity undertakings, and locally produced and consumed goods
and services, such as milk and taxi-cab fares. A considerable extension
of this process will take place, in consultation with the States.
The amendment of the Constitution proposed would give the Conmmonwealth
Parliament power to legislate with respect to rents and
prices, including charges. The power over rents would cover the
fixing or pegging' of rents, would include power to provide for the
determination of fair rents and, as an incidental matter, to protect
tenants against eviction. It would apply to rents of goods as well arents
of land and buildings. The power with respect to prices would
enable Parliament to control and regulate the prices at which property
uf any kind, including commodities, land and shares in companies, is
sold. Explicit power to control charges is included in the bill to remove
any doubt about charges which are in the nature of prices or rents, but
in relation to which the term prices or rents' may not be ordinarily
used; for example, charges for hairdressing or for board and lodging.
The words would also include charges for the use of money, or, in other
words, interest.
" Since minimum prices, as well as maximum prices, could be fixed
under the power, it could be used to ensure a home-consumption price
for primary products. Minimum prices could also be used to prevent
disorder and losses to holders of stocks of imported goods which could
follow a sudden collapse of raw material prices overseas. Further,
the new power would make clear the right of the Commonwealth to
pay subsidies to maintain reasonable prices to consumers as well as
producers for essential goods, such as potatoes and dairy products.
" Control over rents and prices by the Commonwealth is at prese: t
carried on by regulations in force under the Defence ( Transitional
Provisions) Act. That act depends for its validity on the defence
power' of the Commonwealth. The High Court has held that I he
extension of the defence power to measures necessary to the economic
stability of the country does not cease abruptly with the end of hostilities
in a war. The power retains a wide scope during the period of
transition from conditions of war to conditions of peace; -but the scope
of the power is constantly dwindling, and it affords a very uncertain
basis for measures essential to Australia's economic stability. With this
consideration in view, the Government sought the assistance of the Stale
governments, all of which expressed willingness to support the contiuunnce
of price control on a national basis during the post-war transition
period. In some States this legislation has expired and in others
will shortly do so. Further, there is little prospect of this legislation
hieng extended in all or even a majority of States. This creates the
position that, in some States price control now virtually rests on the
defence power, and will have ! egal validity only for as long as that
power is held to support it. Even if there were any certainty that the
defence power is adequate to cover the winding-up of war-time controls 
and measures necessary during the period of transition to conditions of
peace, the Commonwealth would still be without adequate power to deal
with and guard against future economic disturbances. The permanent
power to act effectively and promptly in economic crises is, in the
opinion of the Government, an essential power of a national parliament
quite apart from present circumstances. It is very likely that there
will be long periods during which these powers will not be exercised, or
will be exercised only in limited fields, but they will be a vital weapon in
the nation's defences against inflationary booms, followed by economic
depressions. It is these circumstances which have led the Government
to recommend to Parliament that the people be asked, by way of referendum,
to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to legislate for
the control of rents and prices.
As rent is one of the main items in living costs for the average
person, movements in rents have an important influence on social and
economic stability. State governments have power to control rents,
but it is unlikely that they will all do so at the same time, in the same
way. We have seen earlier what happened to rents after the last war,
when control could have been exercised only by State governments.
If rents are allowed to rise in one , State, but not in others, wages will
rise in that State above the general level. With wages, many other
costs and prices will rise as well. As a result the whole economy may
be thrown out of balance. In practical terms, uniform control of rents
can be secured only if it is applied by the Commonwealth Government.
State government. s have power to control prices. But mainly
because commodities can move freely between States, it is not practicable
for State governments to control more than a limited range of commodities
produced and sold locally. Where goods such as galvanized
iron are produced in only one State it would be impracticable for the
Government of any importing State to maintain an adequate control
over consumers prices while prices charged by the imanufacturers were
beyond their control. Consequently, since the States have only a limited
practical power to control prices, and the Commonwealth has not, in
normal peace-time, any legal power to do so, there is not any really
effective power to control prices anywhere within the country. This,
obviously, is a serious anomaly.
Siress has already been laid on the responsibility of the Commonwealth
for the preservation of economic stability. This means, in plain
terms, the prevention of booms' and slumps', which, in the past,
have brought so much loss, unemployment and misery. It means the
maintenance of steady incomes for producers, in town and country alike.
It means the preservation of a stable purchasing power for money, and
the protection and improvement of living standards for the various
clasaes within the community. This is of particular importance to 
pensioners, people with fixed incomes, and all who contribute to the
savings of the community. Control of prices is wrapped up with all
these things. Rises and falls of prices are part and parcel of booms
and ' slumps'. They determine also the value of money, and the distribution
of the national output among the community.
Control of profiteering and monopolies again is closely bound up
with prices, and this is a field in which, for the most part, only Commonwealth
action can be effective. Since monopolies are often nation-wide
in scope, State governments are virtually powerless to deal with them.
Many of the special functions of the Commonwealth are dependent on
a power to regulate prices. The Commonwealth, for example, is concerned
with the overseas marketing of exports. Primary producers are
only too well aware that high prices are likely to be followed by low
prices. All systems of guaranteed prices and home-consumption prices
designed to promote orderly marketing will be greatly strengthened if
the Commonwealth Parliament has power to legislate for minimum
prices. Such a power would overcome many of the difficulties created
in the rural economy by section 92 of the Constitution.
Again, it is the Commonwealth which fixes levels of tariff protection
for local industries. it does so with a view to assisting such
industries to establish themselves and expand. Unless prices charged
by local industries for their products can be supervised and regulated,
there is always a risk that tariff protection : may be abused and the
community exploited. Producers are likely to rely on tariff protection
to maintain their high prices, instead of increasing their efficiency and
moderating their profits to reduce their prices.
All these considerations add up to an overwhelming case for giving
the Commonwealth power to legislate on rents and prices. It is the
only authority in Australia which can exercise such power effectively.
It has had such a power during the war and the post-war period, and
has used it with highly beneficial results. It will need such a power in
the future if it is to preserve and advance the economic welfare of the
nation through a time which threatens very great dangers and
difficulties. There is no short-cut to this end, and we should be warned
by the example of other countries that the quick and easy step of
abandoning all controls can bring far worse troubles than those it was
sought to avoid. Unless the power to control prices is written into the
Cons'itution now, it will not be available to the Australian people when
it is most needed.
The question is not political. It is a simple question, as every
Australian should realize, of making sure that nation-wide protection
can be given in times of difficulty to the tenant, the wage-earner, and the
housewife, to the primary producer, and, in fact, to every Australian
who has to pay for land, or goods, or services of any kind-in other
words, to every Australian." [ The bill was passed.

COMMONWEALTH GRANTS COMMISSION.
SPECIAL GRANTS 1947-48.
In Par it-ment.-On 19th November, 1947, the Prime Minister
( Mr. Chifley) introduced the State Grants Bill. Mr. Chifley said-
The object of this bill is to obtain the approval of the Parliament
to the payment, during 1947-48, of special grants aggregating
Å“ 5,042,000 to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and
Tasmania. Provision for the payment of these grants follows recommendations
of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The commission
recommended that special grants aggregating Å“ 6,050,000 be paid to
the claimant States in 1947-48, but added that these recommendations
were made on the assumption that the amount of tax reimbursement to
the States, Å“ 40,000,000, and the shares of this amount allotted to -the
claimant States remain unchanged in 1947-48. The commission therefore
stipulated that in -he event of any claimant State receiving in
1947-48 more or less by way of tax reimbursement than it received in
1946-47, the commission's recommendation should be adjusted by the
amount of such increase or reduction. The bill authorizes the payment
of an additional tax reimbursement grant of Å“ 5,000,000 to the States
in 1947-48 under the uniform tax plan. Of this amount, South Australia,
Western Australia and Tasmania will receive Å“ 432,000, Å“ 423,000
and Å“ 153,000 respectively. In accordance with the recomnmendation of
the commission these amounts must be deducted to arrive at the special
grants which the commission considera should be paid this year. On
this basis, the special grants payable in 1947-48 compare with those
actually paid last year as follows:-1940-47. 1947-4.?.

PETROL SUPPLIES.
RATIONING SYSTEM--TJGIITENING
On 24th -November, 1947. the Prime Minister. Mlr. Chificy., iaid-
" In eoiisequence of the increasing gravity of the dollar position,
I have conterreul to-day with the Minister for Supply ( Senator Ashley).
the Secre'arv to the Treasury S. G. MeFarlanc), the acting
IDirector-Gencral of Posts anid Telegraphis ( Mr. G. T. Citippindall), the
Secretary of the Departmnent of Supply ( Mlr. F. A. O'Connor), and the(
C ontroller of Liquid Fuel ( Mr. W. if. Tucker) to determine measures
to eliminate illicit use of rationi tieke'. s and( eii. sure that each consumer
is limlited to the ration onl his licenice.
" A review of~ the sales of petrol throughout Australia during Septemnber
anid October, 1947, shows that the quantities of petrol being
u1sed are in excess of the total Ilcensed galloniage. Thiis drain of petrol
thirough illicit channels endanger., the whole national petrol supply
po~ ition and, uinless arrested, the movement of essential transport
th rough out the Commonweal th will be jeopardized.
" The Government is dletermined to stamp out [, reaches of the Liqjuid
Fulel Regulations and, as a first . step, has decided that petrol coupons
will in future require to be drawn by consumers from a permanent
issuing office, which will include post offices, as from 1st December, 19471.
It is proposed to regard the post office or other issing-office fromn which
a conmumel drawsE is petrol for Decemlber, 1947. 9s his future permanent 
issuing office. Only in cases of change of residence or for other very
good reasons will consumers be allowed to transfer their licences from
one issuing depot to another.
Consumers will be free to surrender coupons and purchase petrol
at any garage they desire. Arrangements have been made with the
Postmaster-General and . State Liquid Fuel Control Boards for a
thorough internal audit check in each post office and issuing depot to
prevent any illicit practices. The boards can rely on the full support
of the Commonwealth for any action they take against vendors or
consumers who breach the regulations.
It will not be practicable to follow the procedure of previous years
of issuing January petrol coupons in December, and each month's ration
will have to be drawn separately."
NATIONAL OIL PTY. LTD.-GLEN DAVIS PROJECT,
MINISTER'S REVIEW.
In Parliamenl.-On 4th December, 1947, the Minister for Supply
( Senator Ashley) said-
The experiments at Glen Davis have proved to be very costly.
While flow oil is availalle there will be no possibility of oil produced
from shale competing with it; it is not economically possible. The
Government has spent a considerable sum of money and has taken the
best possible advice in regard to the experiments at Glen Davis, and an
appreciation of the development there has to be made. I do not regard
the considerable atount of money that has been expended as being
entirely wasted, because, as a result of the development at Glen Davis,
we know as much about the production of oil from shale as most other
countries in the world at the present time. The development is still
continuing and it is anticipated that at Glen Davis the oil will be produced
at a cost of approximately 2s. a gallon. However, even with
mass production methods, the retorts situated on the side of the shale,
and all the other ingredients available on the spot, the venture is not
profitable at present, and I do not think the Government would be
interested in supplying further capital for shale oil production in
Australia." EXTERNAL TERRITORIES.
PAPUA-NEW GUINEA-UNION.
On 25th November, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) saicl-
Cabinet decided to-day that a bill be drafted for presentation to
the Federal Parliamentary Labour party, to provide for an administrative
union of the Territory of Papua and the Mandated Territory
of New Guinea with provision for one administrative head, one legislative
. body and conmmon services. The title of the united territories
will be the ' Territory of Papua and New Guinea 
BRITAIN.
FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR IMPORTS.
On 26th November, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
' A report received yesterday on the commitment for imports in
1947-48 from dollar sources leaves the Government no option but to
make further savings in Australia's dollar commitment. The drift in
the dollar position of the whole sterling area is serious and the latest
figures of the dollar drain are particularly disturbing.
Australia is, as a result of the nature of its international trade, a
net purchaser of dollars from the pool, and if the pooling system were
to break down the resultant dislocation to the Australian economy
would be very serious. But it is very clear that every sterling area
country, including Australia, has to ration itself severely on dollars
if the pooling system is to survive. Last year Australia had a substantial
deficit in its dollar trade. The total commitment revealed in
the report of the special committee investigating the matter showed big
increases over last year's imports from the dollar area. On the other
band, Australian exports to the dollar area are not yet up to last year's
rate. Outstanding import licences were recalled for review on Sth
October, 1947, by the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice). At
that time, importers were asked to defer shipment until the review was
completed in the hope that in the final analysis some arrangement
could be made to confirm the licences. The position has now become
so grave that the Government is reluctantly compelled to cancel all
licences recalled for review except those covering goods shipped to
Australia on or before 23st October, 1947; those covered by irrevocable
letters of credit; anld those for goods included in the list announced
by the Minister as having a high degree of essentiality. The importation
of any goods from dollar sources without a licence is prohibited
and importers in their own interests should immediately notify their
suppliers of the cancellation.
" Only a limited amount of dollars can be made available for the
issue of new licences for goods from dollar sources to be imported
before 30th June, 1948. The Customs Department has been instructed
to ensure that this amount is allocated only to the highest priority
goods. The committee has also made recommendations for further savings
in regard to certain items involving heavy dollar expenditure which
were not included in the licences recalled for review. These recommendationlu
will be considered by Cabinet on 8th December, 1947.
There is little likelihood of any early easing of the critical dollar
position and, for the future, it has been decided to operate the licensing
of goods from dollar areas on a quota system associated with a budget
ceiling. \ An announcement will be made by Senator Courtice of the
procedure to be followed by importers to establish base year quotas.
7858.-2 
It is clear that the cancellation of licences will interfere with some
production programmes in Australia and the decision has been taken
with the greatest reluctance. The effect of the cancellation can, in
many cases, be absorbed by stock adjustments or new sources of supply
and users of goods are urged to use their utmost resourcefulness in
overcoming the difficulties ahead."
FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLARS, TRAVEL.
On 4th December, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
In view of the deterioration in the dollar position the Government
has decided that approval will not be given to the provision of
dollars for travel for personal reasons. Except in special circumstances,
travel involving dollar expenditure will be restricted to visits
for business purposes which are important from the point of view of
maintaining essential industry or industrial development. In the case
of busine-s visits which would still qualify for the provision of dollars,
a further reduction has been made in the amount which may be
provided." FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR IMPORTS, PRIME
MINISTER'S STATEMENT.
In Parliament.-On 4th December, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
" At present there is practically a world-wide shortage of United
States dollars. Among regions affected are Britain, Australia, New
Zealand, India and the other countries of the sterling area, most of
Europe, Canada and the South and Central American countries. For
most of the world, Canadian dollars are also scarce while Canada is
faced with an acute shortage of United States dollars.
Although other factors have contributed to this situation, the most
important cause is the disparity between levels of production in the
United States on the one hand and in Europe and Asia ( including
Indonesia) on the other hand. Restoration of the war-devastated
countries has in general been slow, with the resultr that they have been
able neitier to produce the normal proportion of their own needs nor
to re-cstablili their export trade. Hence there has been a concentration
of demilland on the United States and Canada, where production has
risen more rapidly than elsewhere. The position has been greatly
aggravated by the increase in United States prices, particularly during
the past year.
On recent figures, the rate of exports from the United States has
exceeded the rate of imports by about 10 billion dollars a year.
Whereas during the early post-war period contributions such as those
made under U. N. R. R. A. and the large dollar loans made by United
i 
States and Canada eased the position for a number of countries, the
greater part of such aid had, by the middle of 1947, been exhausted and
dollar deficits are now for the most part being met by drawings on
gold and dollar reserves. In most cases such reserves are dwindling
rapidly and cannot sustain for long the present rate of drawings on
them. In efforts to reduce the dollar gap in their balances of payments,
most countries have by now imposed severe restrictions on United
States goods.
There can be. no satisfactory solution to the present dollar problem
until European production and trade are . brought into balance with
Western Hemisphere production. To a large extent this will require a
reconstruction of the European economy and the Marshall Plan is
based on such a concept. It calls for the utmost co-operation and
mutual help between European countries themselves as a condition of
further aid from the United States. The participating countries have
submitted a four-year reconstruction programme for which they are
seeking United States aid to the extent of 22 billion dollars. The
United States Congress is now considering interim proposals for
assistance valued at 597 million dollars to Austria, Italy and France to
cover the needs of these countries until 31st March, 1948. Committees
have been examining the longer term proposals. However, even if the
long term proposals are approved, it is not intended that the assistance
will begin to be available until April, 1948, or later.
Britain emerged from World War II. with her productive structure
seriously impaired and her external income from exports and overseas
investments greatly reduced. She needed a certain level of imports,
largely from the United States to maintain a reasonable living standard
and to supply raw materials and replace capital equipment. With her
overseas investments largely liquidated and her shipping depleted,
exports were the only substantial means of payment remaining, but
even these had fallen by the end of World War II. to 40 per cent. of
the pre-war . volume. It was estimated that the volume of exports would
have to rise to 75 per cent. above pre-war before Britain's overseas
payments would balance again. It was against this background that the
United States loan of 3,750,000,000 dollars was negotiated to assist
Britain in its transitional period. The United States loan became
available on 15th July, 1946. It was estimated that the loan would
last for two to three years. However, it was used up in just over
twelve months, largely because of-
The rapid increase in American price levels; the slow recovery of production
in Europe and Asia; the severe 1946-47 winter in Britain which dislocated
British production; and the demands of other countries for conversion of sterling
into dollars after 15th July, 1947, when sterling became formally convertible
into dollars under the Loan Agreement ( Convertibility was suspended on
August, 1947).

SThese tables indicate that although the listed countries used
Å“ stg. l125,000,000 of their sterling holdings for expenditure in the dollar
area by converting sterling into dollars or by transferring sterling to
American account, the United Kingdom short-term liabilities to the
same countries declined by only Å“ stg. 2,700,000 over the period 1st January,
1947, to 31st August, 1947. Thus the movement into dollars
resulted from expenditure in the dollar area of currently earned
sterling rather than a withdrawal of accumulated sterling balances.
However, most of the countries concerned added to their sterling
balances during the first six months of the year and drew heavily against
them in the June-August period. The drain over this latter period
accentuated the running down of the American loan and made inevitable
the suspension of convertibility of sterling into dollars.
On 7th August, 1947, Dr. Dalton informed the House of Commons
that British gold and dollar reserves amounted to about 2,400,000,000
dollars. As there is a limit ' below which the British Government could 
not permit these reserves to fall, it became necessary, after exhaustion
of the American loan, to devise means of reducing the dollar deficit
drastically enough to safeguard these reserves, which are the reserves not
only of Britain but also of the whole sterling area.
" Britain took the lead in imposing very heavy restrictions on
dollar imports, instituting a renewed export drive and curtailing the use
of dollars on travel, films, military expenditure, and so on. The effect
of these restrictions was to reduce Britain's dollar import programme
for 194S by 400,000,000 dollars.
On 24th October, 1947, Dr. Dalton informed the House of Commons
that the rate of drain was still about 70,000,000 dollars a week, or
about 3,600,000,000 dollars a year.
" On 23rd October, 1947, Sir Stafford Cripps stated that, as a result
of the various measures taken, it was estimated that by the end of 1948
the dollar deficit would be running at a rate not greater than
1,000,000,000 dollars a year, by which time the reserves remaining would
only be something over 1,000,000,000 dollars.
To assist in meeting the position, Britain has drawn 180,000,000
dollars from the International Monetary Fund against its yearly quota
of 325,000,000 dollars. It has also negotiated with South Africa a
loan of gold to the value of 320,000,000 dollars, but has had to ship to
the United States gold to the value of 220,000,000 dollars in payment for
goods. It is clear that, unless the rate of drain from reserves can be
reduced by further cuts in dollar expenditure, there will be no alternative
for sterling area countries but to live within their current dollar
earnings. Even if the long-term proposals contained in the Marshall
Plan are approved and Britain benefits to some extent directly, any
significant improvement in the British position can only come from
the restoration of the European countries.
" These benefits can be expected to mature only gradually. It is
emphasized that the immediate relief contemplated by the United States
Government for European countries is comparatively small and is confined
to France, Italy and Austria and it may be several months before
even this becomes effective. Even if approved by Congress the major
measures of the Marshall Plan may not come into operation for a considerable
time and it should be realized that the principal form of
aid at present contemplated is a contribution of foodstuffs, industrial
materials and equipment. This will help to reduce the dependence of
the countries concerned on dollar supplies. But it will not directly
relieve Britain's problem of securing payment in dollar-convertible
currencies for her exports to those countries.
The grave economic difficulties with which Britain is confronted,
largely as a result of her sacrifices during the war, must be a matter of
much concern to all other members of the British Commonwealth.
Among the greatest of these difficulties is the dollar shortage. The
Australian Government desires to do everything in its power to assist 
39
Britain in overcoming her dollar difficulties. For this reason the
Government announced on 4th September, 1947, that it had been
decided to sell, for the time being, current gold production to Britain
as a special measure of assistance. Before this, Au, ralia's current
production lhd leen added to the gold reserve.
It must be realized that the normal pattern of Australia's overseas
trade is such that we are usually not drawers on the sterling area dollar
pool in respect of both Unites States and Canadian dollars. During
the war years, when a large number of American troops were stationed
in Australia, dollar accruals substantially exceeded dollar outgoings.
The net surplus of dollars was sold to Britain for sterling and was used
by Britain in the prosecution of the war. With the removal of American
troops from the Australian theatre and the cessation of hostilities ( and
with it, the termination of Lend-Lease), Australia's international
receipts and payments resumed their traditional pattern and it again
became necessary to purchase dollars for sterling from Britain to cover
out net dollar deficit. This deficit has tended to be larger than in
pre-war years because of the factors already mentioned as underlying
the whole problem of the world-wide dollar shortage-the slow recovery
of production in Europe and Asia and the rise in American pri,: e
levels. " Conservation of both United S: ates and Canadian dollars is
an inescapable necessity for Australia. We can, of course, help by
increasing our exports to the dollar area. Wool is our greatest dollar
elarner, but the scale of American wool purchases is governed by factors
largely outside our control. Exports of wool to the United , States in
1946-47 were valued at Å“ A. 25,900,000. This figure does not include
wool valued at Å“ A. 9,900,000 which, although shipped during 1946-47,
had been purchased at issue prices during 1945-46 from the Australian
Wool Realization Commission before the resumption of the wool
auctions. The Australian Wool Realization Commission expects sales of
wool to America during 1947-48 to be less in quantity than in 1946-47.
This reduction in quantity will be partly offset by the rise in wool prices
Iut the commission, on present indications, expects the value of sales
to the United States to be slightly less than last year. In addition, the
commi-sion anticipn'c thte!' r wli1 some small sales to Canada and
other countries which will pay in dollars.
The Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard) is examining the
possibility of increasing exports of other commodities to the dollar
area. There is at presnt a strong demand in the Unied States for
various raw and manufactured products produced in Australia, but, in
many instances, exports have been restricted to preserve adequate
supplies to meet the needs of the home market. We may, however.
have to consider whether additional quantities of sone of these goods
can be released for export to earn dollars to pay for more essential
goods which we need to import from dollar sources to keep our
industries operating.
7858.-4 
" Since the outbreak of war in 1939, imports from the dollar area
have in general been limited to essential goods not available in adequate
quantities from sterling sources of supply. However, in present circumstances,
a great many items are obtainable only from the dollar area
: and the great development which has taken place in Australian industry
has increased the demand for imported machinery and raw materials.
During the period immediately following the cessation of hostilities,
when reconversion of American production to a peace-time basis was
incomplete, the level of dollar imports was limited by lack of availability.
During the current year, however, American production has
caught up with the backlog of domestic demand in many fields and
many items have come into free supply for the export trade. This,
coupled with the steep rise in dollar prices, has led to a very rapid
growth in the value of dollar goods imported into Australia. Our
imports from the United States and Canada in 1946-47 were valued at
Å“ A. 63,000,000, on the recorded basis of f. o. b. plus 10 per cent. In the
first four months of 1947-48, imports from the United States and
Canada were about Å“ A. 41,000,000-an annual rate of Å“ A. 123,000,000.
Accurate estimates of Australia's balance of paymeuts with individual
countries are difficult to obtain, particularly because of the high
propor: ion of our overseas trade which is financed through London.
However, on 30th September, 1947, the House was informed that, on the
basis of such information as is available, it was estimated that in 1946-47
Australia's dollar deficit amounted to about 100 million dollars.
" Following the suspension of convertibility of sterling into dollars
and the exhaustion of the American loan, the Commonwealth Government
took stock of the position and decided on certain measures to
reduce the size of Australia's deficit for 1947-48 and thus reduce the
demands we would have to ' make on Britain to provide us with dollars
from their ultimate reserve of gold and dollars.
" Following the September decisions, Australian officials were sent
to London at the request of the BritisL Government to participate in
discussions between representatives of the various sterling area countries
on the general dollar situation and the steps required to meet it. Those
talks revealed that the rate of drain on the British gold and dollar
reserves was even more serious than had been realized and the British
authorities requested that Australia should undertake to live within
its current dollar income and to make no net claim on Britain for
dollars. The Commonwealth Government felt unable to give a rigid
undertaking. Since our dollar earnings are apt to vary widely from
year to year there could be no certainty as to what such a commitment
would entail. But it was evident that should our dollar income decline
heavily we might find ourselves unable to fulfil such an undertaking
without causing excessive dislocation to Australian industry. The
Government did, however, undertake to co-operate with the British
Government in reducing dollar expenditure to the fullest practicable
extent.
i' 1 
41
" When the September review was made, no clear picture was
available of the extent to which we were alrecady comnitted to expenditure
of dollars by import licences already granted. Statistics were
available on the total value of licences issued, but it was not known
to what extent the goods covered by these licences had already been
imnportedl or what proportion was still to come forward. Accordingly,
early in October, 1947, all outstanding dollar import licences ( except
for certain commodities covered by special arrangements), were recalled
for review, to establish more precisely the extent of our dollar commitments
for imports during 1947-48 and to enable consideration to be
given to the possibilities of further economies in dollar expenditure.
* An inter-departmental committee was subsequently appointed to
examine the figures obtained from the review of import licences and to
make recommendations on the steps necessary to reduce dollar imports
in 1947-48 to a figure which we could hope to finance from current
dollar earnings and dollars available from Britain.
" This committee has presented an initial report which indicated
that, despite the September dollar cute, outstanding commitments were
so high that, in the absence of further measures, imports from the
United States and Canada during 1947-48 would exceed Å“ A. 100,000,000,
as against Å“ A. 63,000,000 for 1946-47. Even if dollar earnings during
1947-48 reach the 1946-47 level, it is clear that with imports of over
Å“ EA. 100,000,000, Australia's dollar deficit for 1947-48 would be considerably
greater than la. 9t year's, notwithstanding the sale of current
gold output.
wa" The picture disclosed by the inter-departmental committee's report
wsso serious that the Government felt compelled to take drastic action
to reduce dollar expenditure on imports during 1947-48 and to ensure
that the rate of importation throughout the whole of 1948 would hwe
confined to levels which it would be practicable to finance. The total
value of dollar import licences recalled for review was Å“ A.. 52,000,000.
Action is being-taken to confirm these licences in all cases where goods
were in transit, irrevocable letters of credit had been established and the
goods covered were included in the list of highly essential items
announced on 30th October, 1947. The Government had hoped that it
would be possible to avoid cancellation of any licences, but, in the light
of the inter-departmental committee's report, it was felt that there was9
wastho alternative but to cancel all outstanding licences not falling
wihnthe above categories. It is estimated that the effect of these
decisions will be to confirm licences to a value of Å“ A. 35,000,000, ' and to
cancel licences to a value of Å“ A. 17,000,000.
" Major items involving dollar expenditure such as newsprint, motor
vehicle chassis, tobacco, petrol and film remittances are being dealt with
separately and were not covered in the general review of import licences.
Further economies in these major items will be inescapable and specific
proposals will he submitted to Cabinet for decision. 
12
" Despite the action already taken and the further action proposed,
our inescapable commitments are so great that the possibilities of
effecting reductions in dollar expenditure durng 1947-48 are limited.
Even when all possible action has been taken it seems probable that
imports from the United States and Canada during 1947-47 will be
about Å“ A. 90,000,000. However, a marked tapering off in dollar imports
may be expected during the second half of 1947-48 and imports during
the calendar year 1948 from the dollar area will be reduced to a level
bearing a much closer relationship to our current dollar earnings.
The Government appreciates that, to meet cases of special urgency,
some new licences will have to be granted for the importation of goods
from the dollar area during 1947-48. However, a ceiling figure has
been placed on the value of such licences and the inter-departmental
committee has been given ' the responsibility of recommending the
allocation of licences withing the ceiling . figure. The Government is
now considering the basis on which dollar import licences are to be
issued for goods to be imported during 1948-49. It is proposed to
establish quotas for the various classes of goods within a budget ceiling
and the Minister of Trade and Customs ( Senator Courtice) will
announce as soon as possible the procedure to be followed in granting
import licences.
The Government regrets the inconvenience and hardship which
cancellation of import licences and other dollar conservation measures
have caused in industry and commerce. It feels confident, however, that
the Australian people as a whole will support the action taken, since
failure to reduce dollar expenditure would inevitably increase the much
greater hardships at present being endured by the British people.
Britain is at present making sales from its reserves of gold and is
borrowing from the International Monetary Fund to pay for imports
of food and other essential goods and to meet the dollar deficit of other
members of the sterling area. Australia must do what she can to help
by reducing net demands on Britain for dollars to the absolute
minimum." FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR. S, PRIME MINISTER'S
. STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT.
In Parliament.-On 4th December, 1947, Mr. Chifley said--
" To understand the Government's attitude towards the dollar
shortage, it is necessary to go back to the time when Sir Kingsley Wood
was Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain. For a long time, Britain
had been selling foreign securities to finance the war, and was thus
losing its income from foreign investments. This income had formerly
come to Britain in the form of food and raw materials, and. no doubt,
in the form of luxury items, also. It did not require any one of great
sagacity to forecast that if this process was continued much longer,
economic difficulties must inevitably arise. During the war, and afterwards,
the Australian Government maintained restrictions on the use
of dollars. I realized that the British Government. operating under 
43
the Anglo-American Loan Agreement, was bound by certain obligations
which did not apply rigidly to Australia. We have guarded, so far
as we thought reasonable, against the undue expenditure of American
dollars for goods and equipment.
There is nothing very mystifying about the position. It is true
that the situation has deteriorated very rapidly during the last eighteen
months. The loan that Lord Keynes negotiated on behalf of the
British Government with the United States Govermnent was not as
large as the British Government wanted. The terms of the loan were
generous, but some of the conditions attaching to it I regard as very
obnoxious. It was hoped, however, that the loan would be sufficient to
maintain the Empire pool of dollars long enough to allow certain things
to happen. The first was the rehabilitation of British industry, and
the development of the British export trade; the second was the
rehabilitation of Europe, which would have provided a market for
: British goods, and would have supplied other goods in return. This
hope was defeated by the disastrous inflation of prices in the United
States, which meant that the quantity of goods which could h. e bought
out of the loan was much smaller than had been expected. Moreover,
the price of goods bought from Argentina, and other hard currency
rountries, rose in some instances by 150 per cent., and prices generally
increased by 40 per cent. The second factor which helped to defeat
the original plan was that the rehabilitation of Europe has not proceeded
as was expected. For some time, climatic conditions in Britain
were disastrous, a fact which added to that country's troubles. For a
considerable time, more than two million of Britain's men were overseas
on military duty in various parts of the world, and it was not
possible to withdraw them immediately, although that is now being
done as quickly as possible. Those inen were not producing, and some
of themn-tho. e in Germany, Palestine and Egypt-were drawing on
dollars from the American loan for their upkeep.
It is true that we could export to dollar, or hard currency, areas
a quantity of goods and coiiniodities that we are now either using ourselves,
or are sending to Britain, where they are sorely needed. I have
discussed this matter with the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard).
I have gone into it very fully. We could, no doubt, export more goods
to hard currency areas such a. s the Philippines, China, Panama, South
America and to Switzerland. But we must never lose sight of the fact
that, for a number of reasons, we owe a great responsibility and duty
to Britain. One reason is that the British are a great nation with
wonderful traditions. During the last seven or eight years they have
shown a magnificent spirit. They bore the brunt of the catastrophic
war from 1939 until 1945. To-day, they are in most difficult circiunstances.
A second, and very material, reason is that Britain has been
Australia'. greatest customer. Therefore, we cannot lightly brush
aside our duty to Britain. Australia is one of the countries which made
the least economic sacrifice, and suffered least in World War II. Are
we to deny to Britain wheat, butter and other good. s which our kinsfolk 
44
urgently need because they can offer us payment only in sterling? If
we decided to withold those goods so that we should not make any
sacrifices, we should increase intensely Britain's economic difficulties.
The Australian Government is not prepared to do that.
Two problems arise. One is whether we should export to the
dollar area certain materials and commodities in short supply here,
which Britain does not particularly require but which we ourselves
badly need for our own industries. In the hard currency countries we
could sell cement, steel, constructional steel, . steel rods and timber.
But if we did so we should accentuate the scarcity of these materials.
One of the great problems now confronting the people of the United
States arises because America has exported such enormous quantities
of goods as to produce a shortage in the domestic market. That has
accentuated the inflationary spiral. Because of the enormous volume
of exports, many goods are in short supply, and, with the abolition of
prices control, the American people are obliged to pay excessive prices
for them. We must examine the problem as realists. We desire to extend
to Britain all possible assistance, while striking a fair balance to ensure
that our own people do not make undue sacriefices. This course is to
be preferred to seizing every opportunity to sell our exports in the hard
currency and dollar area. Britain, which urgently needs these goods,
has been, and will -be, our greatest customer for decades. Are we to
ignore the plight of Britain because some temporary customer requires
these goods and is prepared to pay dollars for them? Are we to
deprive our greatest customer, friend and ally of those goods? We
must weigh all these factors realistically.
The Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice) is deluged with
requests from other countries for Australian goods. Most of these
goods happen to be urgently required on the Australian market. The
International Food Council considers that Australia's exports of food
R hould be allocated in a fair proportion to the needs of the people who
require them. Britain is a party to the International Food Council.
Senator Courtice could readily find markets for our wheat in China,
for which we would receive payment in American dollars, or in
Switzerland, for which we would be paid in Swiss francs, and for other
goods in the Philippines or Panama. If we sold these goods and conmmodities
in China, Switzerland, the Philippines and Panama, the
people of Britain and Australia would not have adequate supplies.
Therefore. we must strike a balance. Senator Courtice has been
examining the subject very closely to ascertain whether we can export
goods without doing an injustice to Britain and disrupting our own
economy There is no mum. bo-jumbo about the dollar shortage. What i.
the real source of the trouble? The value of the goods which the United
States has exported is approximately three times, as much in dollars
s the value of the goods which it has imported. To that situation,
I
I'l 
there can be only one answer. This formn of trade must have violent
repercussions. I do not condemn the United States. Had it not been
for the assistance of the United States in World War II., Australia
might have been conquered by the Japanese. When we begin to
examine this problem we discover there are many matters which must
be studied. If the value of the exports of a country are three times
the value of its imports, there can be only one result.
" The United States * has made great contributions to assist other
countries, and the maintenance of Japan to-day is costing an e normous
sum. America has poured out billions of dollars, and perhaps some
doubt may be expressed as to the wisdom of the way in which the
money was expended. However, this granting of assistance is a tribute
to the American Government, the Department of State and people who
have some appreciation of the enormous problems now confronting the
world. It would be easy for me to say that the only course which will
remedy the situation is for the American people to make the most
magnificent gesture that the world has ever seen. That idea is not
easy to sell to all the American people. When we are situated so far
away from America, it is easy for us to preach about lofty ideals, and
what the United States should do. It is not always easy to convince a
majority of the people of the right policy to adopt in relation to other
countries. That is one of the great difficulties which American statesmen
are facing to-day. I make no criticism of that. It is for the
Americans, as people living in a democracy, to choose the course which
they think fit.
It would not matter whether the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr.
Menzies) or any one else was in office at present. He would have to
face the reality that Australia could not get goods from the dollar area
without paying for them. The great industrial barons are not
philanthropists. They do not manufacture motor vehicles, cotton
textiles and tractors with the idea of presenting them to us free of
charge. The conditions attached to the Anglo-A-merican loan contained a
provision for convertibility of sterling balances. India, Egypt, Australia,
Southern Ireland, New Zealand, and South Africa had all
accumulated enormous sterling balances in London. They were all in
a position given good seasons such as we are now experiencing, to earn
a great amount of current sterling. That is also true of Argentina, a
country which was exporting goods to Britain and charging very high
prices for them. When the convertibility provision of the Anglo-
American loan commenced to operate, those countries immediately
rushed in to obtain dollars. A certain amount of that sort of thing
was done in Australia. Those who held lecters of credit demanded
dollars, irrespective of the strain placed on the British Tretu; ury, even
though, in some oases, their goods were still on the water. Betweeii the
time when this~ rush hogan and the time when the British Chancellor 
had to announce d a r Aol lar euies ismust end, there was an etiormifls
flow of dollars fromi' the 13lritish pool. The dralin was so severe
that it had to be stoiped, despite the provision in the termts of the
Anlglo-Anicrica n loan. Since then, the prices of goods in dollar aS.
and indeed akho in hard currency areas, have continued to rise so tha-t
British couintries are nowv unable to obtain, for-a given amount of doilitn
( urretl,-y, the same quentity of goods as they could obtain previously.
" The Britiqlh Government has used almost all of the Amierican

It lhas had to draw extensively on those reserves. In adldition, it lias

grold. It istrue that the British Government requested that we should
live wvithin oui-dollar earnings. I told the Treasury in London at tihe
time that that iva an impossible task for Australia.
Last year, despite the restrictions this Government imposed, Australia
had to purchase 100,000,000 Canadian and American dollars from
the depleted Empire pool. This year, even though we have imposed
further restrictions on the use of dollars,_ the situation is still rapidly
deteriorating. Very reasonable supervision has been maintained over
the issuing of import licences for goods that involve dollar expenditure.
hut, owing increased prices and other reasons, we arc still importing
far larger quantities W dollar goodls than we could expect a country
which iq starved of dollars to sell to us. Those are the hard, cold facts.
I eannot at this moment say whe'hcr even the suggested res triction. s
that will lbe considered lvCabinet on Sth Decemtber. 1947, will be
su1ifilcient to mneet the denian'ls of the situation. I noticed a statement in
the British pres last week in which a very high tribute was paid to the
co-operation of the Niv; raliaii Government in saving dollars. That 
statement declared that, if other countries had done as Britain and
Australia had done, Britain would by now have been much nearer than
it is to the top of the very steep hill to complete economic rehabilitation
which it is climbing.
" The Government is discussing problems associated with dollar
shortages with the various industries affected so that it may have the
considered views of everybody on the subject. We are anxious to cushion
the impact of restrictions so that industries may he kept operating as
much as possible and so that people employed in them shall suffer as
little as possible.
My final word is that we must guard against the exhaustion of
the British Empire dollar pool. Should the pool reach such a low ebb
that dollars cannot be released to us, then we must sharply cut off
imports of all things that we now hope to purchase with dollars drawn
from it. That would mean a sudden disruption of the national economy.
We want to avoid doing that and to continue to do justice to our own
people and to our great allies the people of Great Britain."
FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR IMPORTS, CABINET
DECISIONS.
On 8th December, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
"' The statement on the dollar situation tabled in the House of
CRpresentatives on 4th December, 1947, indicated that of the
Å“ A. 52,000,000 of dollar import licences recalled for review about
Å“ A. 35,000,000 were to be confirmed and about Å“ A. 17,000,000 were to
be cancelled. However, major items such as motor chassis and tobacco, involving
heavy dollar expenditure, were not included in the general review of
import licences. Cuts in these major items were made by Cabinet in
September, 1947, but the statement presented to Parliament pointed
out that further economies would be inescapable and that specific
proposals would be submitted to Cabinet for decision at its next
meeting. Afer a full review of the dollar position, Cabinet has now decided
to effect further economies in dollar expenditure on the following

NEWSPRINT FOR THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY.-Cabinet approved a reduction
in total newsprint consumption ( Australian and imported) to 90,000 tons per
annum as from 1st January, 1948. This makes the average cut on pre-war
consumption 51 per cent.
PETROL.-Cabinet decided to effect a further 10 per cent. reduction in total
licensed gallonage. The cut will be applied uniformly to all classes of
consumers. FILM REMrTTANCES.-Under decisions previously announced the film companies
are permitted to remit to their principals in the United States 70 per
cent. of the amount of their remittances in the base year ( 1946). Cabinet
decided that as from 1st January, 1948, remittances should be limited to 50 per
cent. of the base year quota, earnings in excess of that figure to be retained in
Australia. " After allowing for the effect of these decisions and the decisions
announced earlier by the Government, total imports from the United
I States and Canada in 1947-48 will still be about Å“ A. 90,000,000, compared
with actual imports in 1946-47 of just over Å“ A. 60,000,000. It is
anticipated, however, that the measures taken by the Government will
reduce the rate of importation in the calendar year 1948 to one which
is practicable in the light of the assessment of the dollar situation at
present available.
" Cabinet discussed the possibility of reducing the size of Australia's
dollar deficit by adopting measures to increase Australian exports to
the dollar area. It was recognized that the possibilities were limited
because of existing commitments to Britain and because many of the
items which could be sold for dollars are in short supply in Australia.
The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard) was
authorized to take. steps within the framework of existing export
controls to divert a greater proportion of Australian produced goods to
dollar export markets. Any measures adopted will be taken after consultation
with other interested Commonwealth departments and with
the industries affected."

MIGRATION.
GOVERNMENT POLICY-MINISTER'S STATEMENT,
NOVEMBER, 1947.
In Parliament.-On 28th November, 1947, the Minister for Immigration
( Mr. Calwell) said-
I am able to inform the House that, when 1947-the first full year
of large-scale, planned immigration-has run. its course, Australia will
have received 30,000 permanent arrivals, in spite of the desperate postwar
shipping shortage, which is afflicting Britain so grievously, which
i all nations suffer in common and which is one of the main obstacles to
the achievement of our target figure of 70,000 immigrants a year.
These 30,000 new arrivals represent all of the three main streams of
immigrants-British, American and European-on which Australia
must rely for the new life blood it so urgently needs.
i f 
I.,
49
In Britain to-day over 400,000 people are anxious to settle in
Australia. Of the 30,000 permanent new arrivals we shall have gained
by the end of 1947, the vast majority will be from Britain.
It is not a healthy condition to have an over-populated Britain
and under-populated dominions, and conversely it is mutually beneficial
to have all the Dominions of the British Commonwealth increasing in
strength from year to year. Britain therefore must help Australia so
that Australia may help Britain and the Blritish Commonwealth of
Nations. I hope that the British authorities will -understand our need
as we press for more and more ships to carry more and more people to
this country. We have no wish to embarrass the British Government by
seeking large numbers of specialists who are in short supply. Aus
tralia's man-power requirements cover such a wide range in every field
of primary, secondary and tertiary industry that we are not obliged to
seek workers for only a few particular occupations. We can, therefore,
readily absorb a cross-section of British people without detriment to
Britain's economic structure but with material advantage to both
countries. We have always been prepared to accept this fair crosssection.
The Government realizes that the provision of Shipping is the
key to immigration plans and has examined every possibility of
obtaining additional transport for British migrants. The results will
be demonstrated in 1948 when the migrant lift will be substantially
greater than has been possible in 1947. The shipping position is one
which will show progressive improvement over the next two or three
years, even thought that improvement is not as fast as we would like.
Nevertheless, I am confident that we shall obtain transport for at least
25.000 free and assisted passage British migrants in 1948. This number
is, of course, additional to the total of full fare paying passengers.
" During the war years, many thousands of American servicemen
visited Australia. Already, 10,000 applications have been received in
the United States, repres'e'nting about 20,000 potential migrants. To
deal with these applications and to select migrants wh-o will be of the
g4reatest benefit to our economy, trained immigration officers with knowledge
of Australian industrial requirements have been attached to the
Austialian Consulates-General at New York and San Francisco. The
first party of 70 United States migrants to benefit from the scheme
arrived in Australia in September, 1947, and further parties have
brought the total to 206. While this is a useful start, it is obvious that
wve will not increase our population by any substantial number while
wec depend on the very limuited passenger shipping at present plying
between America and Australia. I took action while in America
recently to institute negotiations with the Matson Line for two additional
vessels to be put on the San Francisco-Sydney run with the aid
of a subsidy by the Commonwealth Government against loss on
operation. These negotiations are still proceeding, -and if rnutna-ily 
satisfactory arrangements can be made, each ship will be able to carry
3,900 United States migrants a year, based on 650 passengers a voyage,
and a round voyage every two months.
To-day, there are in Germany some 850,000 displaced persons,
mainly of Baltic, Polish and Yugo-Slav origin. Their occupations
include agriculturalists, hospital workers, shipwrights, light manufacturing
workers, building workers, engineers, dentists, doctors and other
professional men. These persons, whose normal standards of living
have been compatible with our own, and who even now do not, in a large
proportion of cases, consist of depressed classes, represent an ideal
source of migrants who will fit smoothly into our way of life and who
will help to meet Australia's labour shortages in the fields of industry
and agriculture. Initially it was decided that 12,000 displaced persons
should be brought to Australia annually under the agreement, but the
Commonwealth is willing to increase this number to 20,000 a year. To
implement this agreement, an Australian selection team, including
doctors, has been appointed, and operates under the aegis of the head
of the Australian Military Mission at Berlin. Migrants are selected
on the basis of their suitability for employment and absorption into
our Australian community.
The Commonwealth Government has entered into an agreement
with ! he Netherlands Emigration Foundation for the migration to
Australia of Dutch national.. Initially, it is proposed to bring to
Australia farm workers at the rate of 50 per month. When the employment
situation in Holland permits, consideration will he given to the
extension of the scheme to other categories of workers.
" During 1946. the record nimrber of 7,126 certificates of naturalization
was issued to persons of 41 different nationalities. For the first
half of 1947, 1,654 certificates were issued comprising 33 different
nationalities. In previous years, the number of certificates issued rarely
exceeded 1,500 in any one year. The granting of naturalization is one
of the most effective means of facilitating the assimilntion of the non-
SBritish members of our population.
" I have said that the present procedure connected with the taking
II of the Oath of Allegiance by applicants for naturalization left much
to be desired. The Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council
considered this matter, and has recommended that the administration
of the oath should be conducted in open court, accompanied by an
appropriate and dignified induction ceremony, which should include
the delivery of an address to the applicants by the presiding judge or
magistrate An appropriate form of oath of allegiance, and suitable
arrangements for induction ceremonies are now under consideration.
1 The council has also recommended that the Department of Immigration
should issue a pamphlet for the guidance of prospective citizens, which
would describe to them in simple language our historical background,
i 1 
51
our mode of government and the responsibilities and privileges of
Australian citizenship. I have approved this recommendation and the
preparation of the pamphlet is now in hand as part of a campaign
designed accelerate the assimilation of the alien newcomers.,"
CIVIL AVIATION.
INTERNAL ROUITES--GOVERNMENT CONTROL, AIRIINES
COMMISSION ACT, AMENDING BILL.
In Parliament.-On 3rd December, 1947, the Minister for Air
( Mr. Drakeford) introduced the Australian National Airlines Bill.
Mr. Drakeford said-
" The primary purpose of this bill is to authorize the Australian
National Airlines Commission to undertake and develop intra-state air
services. Under the existing act, the commission may engage in intrastate
services only to the extent that such services are incidental to
the safe, efficient and economical operation of interstate territorial and
international services. As one step towards the development of intrastate
services, it is proposed that section 19 be amplified so as to
authorize expressly the transport of mail within any State. While
section 22 of the existing act refers to the promotion of the carriage
of mails this section is not expressly linked with section 19. The
Commonwealth Parliament has unquestionable power to provide air
transport, whether interstate or intra-state, for postal purposes, and it
is now considered desirable that the commission should be clearly
authorized to carry mails intra-state so as to be able to implement any
agreement for the carriage of mails authorized under section 22. The
commission will then be able to carry passengers and freight within
any State as incidental to the postal service, provided that the primary
purpose of a particular service is the carriage of mail.
" It is proposed that provision be made for the adoption of the
powers in relation to air transport referred to the Commonwealth in
1943 under the Commonwealth Powers Acts of the various States
except Victoria and Tasmania. Queensland and New South Wales have
referred to this Parliament the matter of air transport and South
Australia and Western Australia the matter of the regulation of air
transport. These references remain effective and cannot be revoked by
ordinary legislative process until 2nd September, 1950, so that until
that date the Commonwealth Parliament may make laws in respect of
air transport within the States which have made the references. As
yet these special and additional powers referred by the States have not
been invoked.
" During the recent conference of Commonwealth and State
Ministers, the Premier of Queensland indicated that his Government
desired the Commonwealth to authorize the commission to establish and
operate intra-state services in Queensland on condition that the commission
pays the same rate of tax as that imposed by that State on
privately operated airlines. The Government considers that it will be i 
of direct benefit, not only to Queensland, but to the Commonwealth as a
whole, if the commission develops intra-state services within Queensland
and other States, even though it is possible that these services, in view of
their developmental nature, may he unprofitable in the beginning. It
has decided to accept the invitation of the Queensland Government to
engage in this new sphere of air service operations.
The provision in the bill implementing State references authorizes
the establishment, maintenance and operation of air services within any
State which has made the necessary references so that fresh legislation
will not be necessary as and when it is decided to take advantage of the
reference in any particular State. Although there is no legal necessity
to impose any limitation, the bill provides that the commission shall
not establish any service unless the Premier of the State in which the
service is to be established has notified the Prime Minister in writing
that he consents to the establishment of the service. This will ensure
that the powers which have already been referred by four States will
not be exercised without the express cons-ent of the States concerned.
In addition, a further sub-clause imposes an obligation on the commission
to pay from time to time amounts equivalent to the licence fees
which would be payable under the law of the State if the service were
operated by a person other than the commission. This provision has
the effect of requiring the commission to pay the same licence-fees as
private operators and meets the condition stipulated by the Premier
of Queensland at the Premiers' Conference.
" Another clause amends section 48 which provides that the commission
must give 30 days' notice of intention to establish a service.
territorial airline licences applied for by Trans-Australia Airlines in
circumstances which will bring into operation section 46 of the act and
thereby render inoperative any airline licence held by any other person
by reason of the fact that the commission is providing an adequate
service. The remaining clauses are mainly concerned with matters of drafting
and in particular repeal those sections of the act declared invalid
by the High Court in the Australian National Airways case."

EXPEDITION-PROGRESS.
On 11th December, 1947, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.
Evatt) announced that the Wyatt Earp, mother ship of the Australian
National Antarctic Research Expedition, would leave on 13th December,
1947, for a summer reconnaissance along the Australian sector of
the Antarctic Continent.
On 15th December, 1947, Dr. Evatt announced that the advance
unit of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition reached
Hleard Island on l1th December, 1947, and had established a food
-depot. On 2nd January, 1948, Dr. Evatt announced that the Wyatt Easy
had been recalled to Melbourne by the. naval authorities. The vessel
had developed a leak in the hull which made it necessary for her to be
overhauled in dry dock.
On 25th January, 1948, Dr. Evatt said that he had conferred with
the Leader of the Australian Antarctic, Expedition ( Group-Captain
S. A. Campbell) who had reported to him the recommendations of the
Planning Committee which had -met on 23rd January, 1948. He had
approved variations in the programme of the expedition for the
remainder of the summer as proposed by the committee. The committee
had considered a report by the Department of the Navy regarding the
condition of the Wyatt Earp which had been in dock undergoing repairs
following her recall from Antarctic waters. Naval authorities were
satisfied that the Wyatt Earp was fully capable of carrying out her
duties. The Wyatt Earp would, subject to comprehensive trials being
successfully completed, leave Melbourne about 6th February, 1948, to
carry out reconnaissance in the eastern sector -of the Australian
Antarctic territory. If practicable, the old magnetic station at Commonwealth
Bay would he re-occupied, or magnetic observations would
be taken in some other suitable region. On the return journey, the
Wyatt Earjs would visit the IBalleny Islands and make a survey.
The Naval landing craft LST3501 had received damage to her
plates at Heard Island. She would go into dry dock and would leave
for Macquarie Island during the last week in February to land a party
, of fourteen scientists to stay there during winter.

RECONSTRUCTION TRAINING SCHEME-FIGURES.
On 11th December, 1947, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway)
said that the present position of the Commonwealth Reconstruction
Training Scheme for post-discharged ex-service personnel was-

Total number completed and at work at 31st October, 1947-33,205.
The difference between the 174,073 and the 33,205 ( with the exclusion
of those who changed their minds or left their State or country)
were going through their courses.

. PETROL SUPPLIES.
RATIONING SYSTEM-REDUCTION, DECEMBER, 1947.
On 11th D~ ecember, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" It -is imperative that the cut of 10 per cent. in petrol, effective
from 1st January, 1948, should be very real and reflect itself immiediately
in the monthly consumption of -petrol through Australia. The
Government realizes that there may be some very exceptional cases
where special licenees will need to be grantcd to compensate for a portion
of the cut. However, such licences will be granted only in the most
exceptional circumstances and there will be no possibility of granting
special licences to class 2 ( private motorists) and classes 3-7, including
business cars and business-pleasure groups.
The Government is doing its utmost under very difficult circumstances.
Its objeetive is to spread the sacrifice over the whole community.
The Government asks consumers to play their part and
rigidly confine their purchases to the reduced licence gallonage under
the new scale."
On 12th December, 1947, Mr. Chifley said-
A satisfactory arrangement has -been concluded with the oil industry
for the checking of resellers' petrol coupons at the oil companies'
main terminals and branch offices. This work will be carried out under
the supervision of the Liquid Fuel Control Board inspectors. As a 
result of this arrangement, the coupon system will be brought under
complete control and coupons surrendered by resellers on receipt of
deliveries into their tanks will be checked and verified within a few
days after the date of each sale. Advices are being issued by the companies
to the resellers of the new arrangements, which become effective
immediately. It will be necessary for resellers to return their coupons in
bundles of uniform quantity ( say 100 gallons) and each denomination
will need to be kept separately. Liquid Fuel Boards are being instructed
to take immediate action direct with resellers in the event of any inaccuracies
being detected. The reselling of petrol will, like other
rationing, be under an imprest system and any deficiencies will be
deducted from the immediately following delivery into resellers' tanks
OIL-SYNTHETIC PRODUCTION.
On 12th January, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
In May, 1947, following consideration of the matter by the Minister
for Supply ( Senator Ashley), the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction
( Mr. Dedman) and myself, an inter-departmental committee
was appointed to report to Cabinet on the general problems of fuel
research in Australia.
Cabinet to-day considered the committee's report which stated
that, at this stage, it was unable to recommend any concrete proposals
for the production of synthetic fuels. It considered it was impossible to
decide what experiments should be undertaken. until extensive investigations
had taken place both in Australia and overseas.
Cabinet adopted the following recommendations-in regard to the
administrative organization considered desirable to enable the formulation
and development of future fuel policy-
The Department of Supply to be given the initial administrati. e responsibility
for the formulation, for the consideration of Cabinet, of Commonwealth
policy in regard to fuel development; and the administration of such fuel
development or production projects as the Commonwealth may control, either
alone or in collaboration with other Commonwealth Departments or with one
or more States.
The responsible department to take such action as may be consid. red necessary
to have the question of whether or not the production of synthetic fuels
should be undertaken in Australia examined so that advice may be , ive. to
Cabinet on the policy it should follow.
It is proposed that the Department of Supply will work in close
association with a section of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research being established to engage in scientific research into fuel
problems. A small mission, comprising two officers selected by arrangement
with the Department of ' Supply and the Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research, will be sent abroad in the near future to carry
out investigations on the basis of which it will be possible to formulate
sound recommendations as to future fuel policy."

FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR IMPORTS.
On 14th December, 1947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" The Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt), the Minister for
Supply (. Senator Ashley), the Minister for Health ( Senator McKenna),
the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard), the Minister for Customs
( Senator Courtice) and myself conferred to-night on the basis to be
adopted for the issue of new import licences for dollar goods to he
imported before 30th June, 1948.
For the past two months there has been virtually a suspension of
the issue of import licences for dollar goods. Following consideration of
a report by the special inter-departmental committee, it has now been
decided to resume the issue of licences. A maximum ceiling figure of
very limited extent has been established for the value of new\ licences
for goods to be imported from the dollar area before 30th June, 1948.
This figure has been allocated over the various classes of goods and the
Minister for Customs will issue licences only in accordance with the
allocation. It must be emphasized that dollar licences to be issued for
importation before 30th June, 1948, will be confined to goods of the very
highest essentiality and the quantities of even these goods will necessarily
be severely limited
On 9th January, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
Much as the Australian Government regrets liavinz to impose
restrictions on dollar imports, this action has been necessary if Australia
is to assist Britain in its present economic difficulti: es. Any failure by
Britain to meet the position that confronts it would have very disturbing
economic results for Australia and the other Dominions. Therefore,
in our own material interests-apart from sentiment and kinship
-Australia must do everything she can to assist the Mother Country
On 22nd January, 1948, the Minister for Customs ( Senator
Courticc) said that licensing of goods originating in the dollar area for
importation on or before 30th June, 1948, was being confined to indispensable
goods to ensure that the limited amount of dollars allocated
by the Government for new licences was not exceeded. Licensing of
goods to be imported from dollar countries during 1948-49 would be
oporated on a budget quota system related to imports during 1946-47.
Each importer should, before 13th February, 1948, furnish to State
Collectors of Customs statements, supported by a statutory declaration,
showing-TIlportations of dol! ar area origin during the period of eighteen months
Irultd 31st December, 1947, according to the individual specifications; and
!' Piltienlars of the quantities and value outstandin as at Ist . lunaIry,
19! k. on all valid licences issued for goods of dollar area origin including tho'e
,,' olds in respect of which statements of importations are not required.
Licences would not be issued to those importers who failed to furnish
the required statements of imports and outstanding licences.

FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR IMPORTS, PRIME
MINISTER'S BROADCAST.
On 26th January, 1948, Mr. Chifley broadcast over the National
network. Mr. Chidley said-
" Recently, as you know, the Government has imposed further
restrictions on dollar imports and, in one way or another, these restrictions
will affect most of you. You have, therefore, a right to be satisfied
that they are unavoidable and that they serve a real purpose. My desire
is to explain the position to you as simply as I possibly can.
In Australia we require dollars to pay for American and Canadian
good( s-uch as newsprint, cotton textiles, tobacco, motor chassis, and
various kinds of machinery. There are also items such a freight, film
royalties and a certain amount of interest on Australian Government
loans in New York. We earn some of these dollars by selling to the
United States and Canada commodities such as wool, rabbit-skins,
canned fruits and so on. But in most years we do not earn as many
dollars as we spend. For example, during the last trade year, 1946-47,
we received round about 190,000,000 dollars and spent about
290.000,000 dollars, so that there was a gap of about 100,000,000 dollars.
Even before the war we earned less dollars than we spent. Then,
however, Britain was able to provide us with sufficient dollars to make
up the difference. Shel sold us these dollars for sterling-English
pounds, that i. Therefore, so long as we could earn enough sterling,
we were able to obtain the extra dollars we required. That position has
greatly changed. Britain is not able to earn sufficient dollars to buy the
things she wants herself. She has, therefore, to restrict the importation
of goods from dollar sources and that imposes severe hardships on
her people. It follows that Britain is not able to sell us all the dollars
we require. . She is still selling us some of her dollars, but every additional
demand we make on her means that she has to deny her people
things that they need. It is true that Britain still has some reserves
but they are being rapidly used up. After the war she borrowed about
five billion dollars from the United States and Canada. But practically
all that lhas now been spent.
This situation has come about mainly in two ways. On the one
hand, Britain needs goods from the United States and Canada to a far
greater value than the goods she can sell there. Her industries need a
great deal of re-equipping, after being damaged by bombs and worn
generally during the war. Her export trade fell away by two-t ' rds
largely because so much of her industry was diverted to war product on.
She lost a great part of her shipping and sold most of her overs as
investments to pay for war supplies. By great efforts and much se'fdenial
on the part of her people, her exports have been increased, b,: t
not far enough to pay for the goods she needs. Most of those exports
go to countries which pay in currencies that cannot be changed into
dollars. 
On the other hand, many other countries look to Britain to provide
them with dollars. All those countries devastated by the war need great
quantities of plant and materials to re-build their industries. Some
still more urgently need foodstuffs and the other necessaries of life,
because their people are barely keeping ahead of starvation. These
countries are all seeking supplies from the United States, but none of
them has enough dollars to pay for the American goods they want nor
enough goods of their own to export in return for American goods.
For a time after the war the gap was partly bridged by loans from
the United States and Canada and relief contributions such as Unrra.
These resources could not have been more than a stop-gap and they have
now come pretty well to an end.
" A number of countries have balances of English money to their
credit at London and nearly all countries acquire a certain amount of
English money in the course of their trade. To get American supplies,
these countries seek to change some of their sterling resources into
dollars. Thus, over and above providing dollars for her own needs,
Britain has to try to provide dollars for a large part of the trading
work, including ourselves. Britain could meet this dollar deficiency
only by borrowing or by drawing on her gold reserves. Actually she has
done both.
" As I have mentioned, the United States and Canada made loans
to Britain totalling about five billion dollars. These loans were intended
to fill the gap between dollar earnings and dollar expenditure until
Britain could get on her feet.
But whereas the United States loan of 3,750,000,000 dollars was
expected to last two or three years, most of it was actually spent in
about one year. During the same period, Britain was also drawing
heavily against the Canadian loan. One reason for this rapid using-up
of dollars was that American prices rose steeply, making the materials
bought by Britain very much dearer. Another reason was the bad
setback to British industry through the severe winter of 1946, which
checked export production. Then, as the United States loan began to
run out, a number of countries sought to convert large amounts of
English money into dollars within a short period and this increased
greatly the rate of drawings against what remained of the loans.
Britain, therefore, has had to face the necessity of drawing on her gold
reserves, which, by pre-war standards, are already very low. How low
they are we have lately been told by the British Chancellor of the
Exchequer ( Sir Stafford Cripps). He said in a statement to the House
of Commons on the 19th December that, at the end of 1947, Britain's
overseas reserves were expected to be about Å“ 500,000,000 sterling. He
has since told us that the rate of drain on these resources is still proceeding
at the rate of Å“ 11,000,000 sterling a week. Clearly this could
not go on for too long. 
" I needl only add that even the Å“ 500,000,000 mentioned by the
Chancellor cannot be regarded as wholly available for spending because
sonme part of it would havc to he held as a bedrock ro'serv-e against
eincrg-enccs and to provide a mninimum wvorking fund for trade purposes.
Clearly this very small mrargin of reserves must he very carefully
husbanded. If the bedrock limit were reached, all the countries
which now obtain dollars through Britain would have to live within
their day-to-day earnings of dollars and this would cause acute difficulties
for the individual countries-for ourselves perhaps as much as
.1115oyn e.
" As I have said, we have to call on Britain in most years for
dollars to balance our accounts with the United States and Canada. The
amount varies from year to year and depends largely on how much we
sell to the United States and Canada. Wool is the main item at present.
We , sold a lot of wool to America last year at high prices. This year
weO will sell rather less, and although wool prices has risen, our total
dollar earnings will be somewhat less than last year.
If wool prices fall, our total dollar earnings might be a good deal
less and wve would either has to ask the British Government for large
amounts of dollars or else cut dollar imports very drastically indeed.
" Since much that we buy from the United States is essential to the
rining of our economny and to our future development we naturally
do not wanit to cut dollar imports too far. And yet, as things stand, We
cannot expect to draw more than a minimium * amount from the shrinking
dollar reserves available to Britain. That, briefly, is the crux of
our present position.
" Britain has taken the main burden of the dollar shortage so far.
They have cut their dollar imports very rigorously, even going' to the
length of reducing their food rations still further. But the other
sterling area countries-ourselves among them-must share this burden
with them. This is not a mere matter of sentiment, but one of sheer, hard
ncecessity. We simply could not afford to see Britain's dollar reserves run
out. Therefore we must do onr very utmost in a practical way, on the
one hand, to earn more dollars and, on the other hand, to save more
dollars. Even with the cuts imposed, and even though we are selling'
our current gold production abroad, we will not earn nearly as many
dollars as we spend this year. There will still be an appreciable gap
for which we must draw on Britain's dollar reserves. But we hope
gradually to reduce that gap as the months go by.
The action taken has inevitably caused a good deal of inconvenience
and some dislocation to trade and industry. The Government
regrets this but there was no way to avoid it. Even now it is estimated
that dollar imports for 1947-48 will reach a total of Å“ A901000,000 a
against Å“ A63,000,000 for 1946-47. 
Since the basic problem behind the dollar shortage is that of
reviving the war damaged economies of the world, we cannot expect any
spectacular improvement within the near future. Those countries have
made some progress since the war ended but it has been relatively slow.
Their problems cannot be solved merely by outside help. The main
effort must come from themselves.
" Nevertheless, outside help is necessary and that is the reason for
further United States help under what is known as the Marshall Plan.
This is a proposal which aims to provide these crippled countries with
the materials they require to step up their production, the idea being
that if they can once get into their stride again they will be able to
keep moving. If the plan is approved by Congress and is put into
operation, Britain should benefit, both directly and indirectly. lcecovery
in Europe would mean that supplies of goods which she now has to buy
with dollars would become available to her from European countries.
Sir Stafford Cripps has said that Britain could look forvward to
some benefit of this kind in the latter half of 1948 if the AMarshall
Plan had by then come into operation. But that is some way ahead
yet and, in the meantime, the dollar problem! u for Britain, and for us too,
is a pretty difficult job of making ends meet.
" We can play our part in two main ways. One is to go carefully
with all forms of dollar expenditure. This particularly is a matter in
which business firms and individual citizens call do a good deal to help.
The other is to produce and export all we can, not only of goods which
can be sold for dollars but of goods which sterling area countries would
otherwise have to buy for dollars. The Government is going very
closely into the question of increasing exports along these lines and it
may be possible to do a good deal, particularly if we have further good
seasons. It is, of course, more satisfactory. to earn more dollars by
increasing exports than to save them by reducing imlports-although
as matters stand we must do our utmost at both. In expanding exports,
however, we have to keep in mind the essential needs of our own plcoplC.
Since world conditions underlying the dollar shortage will take.
time to remedy, it would be wrong for me to hold out the prospect that
import restrictions will soon be lifted or eased. We cannot ignore the
possibility that some of these restrictions may have to be tightened
further. That will not be done, however, unless it is absolutely
inevitable. We have very great interests at stake in this matter because our
overseas trade depends fundamentally on world economic conditions
and above all on the strength and welfare of Britain which, these days,
is hard-pressed to maintain the standards of living of her people. We
all want to help her to win through. As a major exporting country we
can do much by increasing the quantity of foodstuffs and other materials
we send abroad. We can also help by economizing in the use of scarce
dollar commodities. I put it to you that there is a job in this for every
one in Australia 
FINANCIAL POLICY-STERLING, DEVALUATION.
On 24th January, 194S, Mr. Chifley said-
If the International Monetary Fund agrees to devaluation of
the French franc, the method of devaluation is important to Australia,
as a problem cilhi arise regarding relationship of our currency with
sterling. If the de\ valuation is carried out in certain ways, it could
result in a weakening of sterling, and if that resulted in a depreciation
of British currency, a problem affecting Australia could arise.
There have been no consultations with the Australian Government
as to devaluation of the irane, but there must be consultations with the
International Monetary Fund if devaluation is more than 10 per cent.
The move will have no effect on United States aid to Britain. It is a
purely French problem.
The real danger i~ the establishment of a double franc'-similar
to the ' double ire in Italy-which means that some proceeds of
FreniOi exports, would go to the French Treasury, while some would be
free for exporters. This would result in a ' cross rate' of the franc
against the dollar and the pound sterling. This could result in some
weakening of sterling, and depreciation of sterling would set for us
the problem of whether we would depreciate our currency in line with
sterling. There can be no answe. r until these circumstances eventuate,
bht that is the problem which might arise
On 29th January, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
No consideration has been give. n to altering the Australian excli1ngp
rate while sterling remains at its present value. Only in the
event of a depreciation of sterling would the matter be considered.
Tlhre have been no consultations with the British Treasury on the exchange
rate.
The Australian Government shares with the British Chancellor
of the Exchequer ( Sir Stafford Cripps) his fears as to the dangers
which may arise in regard to the French open market for gold and
certain foreign currencies, unless strictly administered

ACTING MINISTERS.
On 14th December, 1.947, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
The Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.

LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH BRITAIN-EXTENSION.
On 15th December, 1947, the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard)
announced that the Government had completed negotiations for an
extension for two years of the long-term contract with the British
Government for the purchase of Australian meat. The original contract
was for four years ending 30th . September, 1948. Prices which
operated during the period October, 1946, to September, 1947, would
continue to operate for the October, 1947-September, 1948, period but
provision has been made in the new agreement for pig meat prices to be
subject to annual price review.

COMMONWEALTH BANK.
POLICY-ADVANCES.
On 18th December, 1947, the Acting Prime Minister ( Dr. Evatt)
said-The instruction recently issued by the Commonwealth Bank to
trading banks with regard to advance policy is similar to instructions
issued by the Commonwealth Bank from time to time on the same subject
since the early years of the war. During the past two and a half
years the trading banks have increased from Å“ 200,000,000 to
Å“ 320,000,000. The increase has been particularly rapid during 1947.
Since December, 1946, trading bank advances have increased by
Å“ 65,000,000. The Commonwealth Bank has facilitated this expansion
by appropriate central bank action. The Government has endorsed
the policy because it considered that the banks should be allowed to
finance the re-conversion of industries from a war footing to peace-time
production, to expand productive capacity for essential purposes and to
assist the re-stocking of farm and station properties.
" Recently a large amount of free money has been available in
the open market for investment, largely because of the exceptional prices
for export commodities and because of the influx of overseas capital.
The existence of this free money was shown by the fact that the Fourth
Security Loan was over-subscribed by Å“ 13,000,000. The Commonwealth
Bank therefore considers that while funds are so readily available in the
market for investment purposes, it is unnecessary and inadvisable that
bank advances should continue to increase as rapidly as in recent months.
In present circumstances, the Commonwealth Bank considers that
capital expansion should be financed by new issues and not by bank
overdrafts. Accordingly, in its revised instructions to the banks it has
called for a somewhat stricter application of the principles which have
formed the basis of its earlier instructions 
WHEAT.
SALE TO BRITAIN.
On 18th December. 1947, the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard)'
announced that the Government had completed negotiations with the
British Governmuent in regard to the supply of wheat and flour from the
1947-4S wheat crop. The Government had accepted the offer of the
British Government for the purchase of 30,000,000 bushels of wheat
at the overall price of A. 17s. a bushel, f. o. b. Australian ports. Thequantity
represented shipments destined for British requirements and
in addition the needs of colonial and other areas for whose wheat
supplies Britain was responsible. The latter shipments would comprise'
mostly flour. Because of the magnitude of the deal and the fact that
the British Ministry of Food would provide shipping to lift all the
wheat and flour over a period of thirteen months, the Government was
justified in accepting the maximum offer which the British Government
was prepared to make. The Government felt that a contract for sucha
huge quantity should not be made on a quarterly price basis, particularly
in view of market fluctuations which could occur over a period
of twelve months.
A clause in the contract provided for an additional allocation of
5,000,000 bushels in the event that receivals by the board from the.
1947-43 harvest reached 210,000,000 bushels of f. a. q. wheat. The price
would be subject to review in the event of the participants to thecontract
becoming parties to an international wheat agreement if and
when made. Under those circumstances, the price of wheat remaining
unshipped at the date the international wheat agreement came into force,
would be adjusted to conform to the price operating under the international
agreement. SALE TO INDIA.
On 18th December, 1947, Mr. Pollard announced the conclusion of
negotiations with representatives of the Indian Food Mission for the
purchase of wheat on behalf of the Indian Government. The Government
would sell to India from the 1947-48 wheat crop 25,000,000 bushels
of wheat, including the flour equivalent of 2,500,000 bushels. The price
would be on the basis of Ai8s. 6d. a bushel, f. o. b. Australian ports, with
delivery spread over twelve months.
A clause in the contract provided for an additional allocation of*
5,000,000 bushels in the event that receivals by the board from the
1947-43 harvest reached 210,000,000 bushels of f. a. q. wheat. The
price would be subject to review in the event of the participants to the

INDIA.
AUSTRALIAN SCIENTIFIC MISSION TO INDIA.
On 21st December, 1947, the Acting Prime Minister ( Dr. Evatt)
said-" A mission of Australian scientifists will shortly visit India. During
the Empire Scientific Conference at London in 1946, many contacts
were made between Indian and Australian scientists and, as a result,
the Government of India has invited the Australian Government to send
a goodwill mission to India to visit the main centres of University and
Government research in that Dominion and to report on scientific
development generally. Many problems encountered by Indian scientists
are similar to those Australians have experienced, and it is believed
that the exchange of views and closer contacts between Indians and
Australians resulting from a visit should prove of mutual benefit to
both countries.
" The Professor of Electrical Engineering at Sydney University
( Sir John Madsen) will lead the delegation, and other members will
be the Professor of Physics at Adelaide University, the Director of the
Waite Agricultural Research Institute ( Professor J. A. Prescott), and
Mr. R. G. Thomas, of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research
Division of Industrial Chemistry. The Assistant Secretary of the
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research ( Mr. G. Gresford) will

EXPORTS TO BRITAIN-GIFTS.
On 13th January, 1948, the Postmaster-General ( Senator Cameron)
said that food parcels despatched by post to Britain in 1947 constituted
a record. The total was 3,355,933 parcels and the weight 31,874.871
lb. Previous figures were-Parcels. weight.

EXPORTS-NEW RECORD.
On 28th January, 1948, Mr. Pollard said-
" Australia's exports for the year ending 30th June, 1948, are
expected to total Å“ 390,000,000, compared with Å“ 308,000,000 for 194647
-an increase of 27 per cent. and an increase of 182 per cent. on the
average figures for the five pre-war years ended 1938-39. Details are--
WHEAT.-Estimated value of wheat and flour exports is Å“ 90,000,000, compared
with Å“ 28,900,000 for 1946-47 and an average of Å“ 19,900,000 for the five
p re-war years. Total volume of exports in terms of wheat may be less than
10,000,000 bushels, compared with an average of 107,500,000 bushels in the five
years ended 1938-39. The great increase in estimated value is due to the
average export price being nearly five times pre-war level. 
WooL.-Exports are expected to be worth Å“ 133,000,000, compared with
Å“ 126,800,000 in 1946-47, in which year considerable shipments were made from
stocks accumulated during the war. The estimated 35d. a lb. greasy basis
compares with the 1946-47 return of 23d. a lb. and for the five pre-war years
of 131d. a lb.
BUTTER.-With a probable value of Å“ 16,700,000. shipments, which should
reach a total of 70,000 tons, should be worth about 60 per cent. more than in
either the previous period or the five pre-war years. when they were valued at
about Å“ 10,400,000. If shipments did reach 70,000 tons in 1947-48 they would
be about 26,000 less than the pre-war average but more than 10,000 tons above
the 1946-47 total. An important factor in the decline in butter exports since
pre-war is the diversion of more milk to whole milk consumption and production
of processed milk.
FROZEN MEATs.-Total exports are expected to increase from a verage of
Å“ 9,100,000 in the five years ended 1938-39 and Å“ 10,500,000 in 1946-47 to
Å“ 13,500,000 in the current period. Beef and veal shipments, estimated to total
90,000 tons, will be nearly 10,000 tons more than in the previous period, but
about 17 per cent. lower than before the war, when they averaged 106,000
tons. Mutton and lamb. estimated at 70,000 tons, will he about 15 per cent.
below the pre-war average of nearly 86.000 tons. The increased value of meat
exports is due to an increase of about 90 per cent. in export prices.
CHEESE.-Average shipments in the five pre-war years were 9,540 tons,
worth Å“ 63 16s. a ton. For the current period, cheese exports are expected to
reach 24,000 tons. at an estimated average price of Å“ 120 2s. a ton, the estimated
total value for the season being nearly Å“ 2,900,000.
EGGS.-For tile five pre-war years. shipments of eggs in shell averaged
15,400,000 dozen valued at 13.52d. a dozen and eggs not in shell averaged 505,000
lb. worth 7.9d. a lb. Estimated shipments to Britain for the current season are
21,000,000 dozen eggs in shell at 2s. Id. a dozen, 20,000,000 lb. egg pulp at
Is. 61d. a lb., and 2,000.000 11. egg pulp at 4s. lljd. a lb. New Zealand is
expected to take 3,500.000 lb. egg pulp at ls. 7d. a lb. Total value of egg
exports is estimated at almost Å“ 4,800.000.
DRIED FRUITs.-Because of bad seasonal conditions, dried vine fruits' exports
are expected to be below pre-war average in volume but higher in value.
Current period's shipments are estimated at 45.000 tons worth Å“ 2,800,000, compared
to pre-war average of 58,245 tons worth Å“ 2,200,000.

WAR WITH JAPAN.
BRITISH COMMONWEALTH OCCUPATION FORCEADMINISTRATION.
On 31st December, 1947, the acting Minister for Defence ( Mr.
Drakeford) said that the British Commonwealth Governments whose
troops were taking part in the occupation in Japan recently reviewed
the system for the control and administration of the British Commonwealth
Occupation Force. They had decided to modify the organization
for combined control by the governments concerned.
It had been agreed, subject to the continued retention by the participating
governments of sovereign control of their own policy and full
consultation when their interests were affected, that responsibility for
the control and administration of the force would be assigned to the Australian
Government to be exercised through the Department of Defence
in relation to joint-service matters and through the Departments of the
Navy, the Army and Air in regard to matters within their respective
spheres. 
The new system would be introduced in January, 1948. The Joint
Chiefs of Staff Committee in Australia, which had planned for and
controlled the force on behalf of the British Commonwealth Governments,
would be dissolved when the new system was introdn~ Ai.
Service representatives of other participating British Commonwealth
Governments would continue to be associated with the Australian
machinery for consultation and advice in connexion with their respective
countries' interests.
BRITISH COMMONWEALTH OCCUPATION FORCECOMMANDER-

General H. C. H. Robertson) to be absent from his command during
January and February, 194S. Lieutenant-General Robertson will
return to Australia for duty and leave and will visit New Zealand to
discuss with the New Zealand Government matters affecting the disposition
of its troops in Japan.
" During Lieutenant-General Robertson's absence from Japan, the
Air Officer Commanding the British Commonwealth Air Forces ( Air
vice-Marshal C. A. Bouchier) will act as Commander-in-chief of the
British Commonwealth Occupation Force."

On 9th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Six Royal Australian Naval officers will fly to Pearl Harbour to
join U. S. S. Valley Forge and take passage in her from Pear] Harbour
to Sydney. The Valley Forge is the flagship of the American Task
Force due to arrive in Sydney on 30th January, 1948. This is in continuation
of the very close liaison wvhich existed between the Royal
Australian Navy and the United States. Navy during World War II.
" The officers, the senior of whom is Captain W. H. Harrington,
will be able to observe the American Task Force during its operations
at sea on passage. The kind invitation extended by the Commanderin-
Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet will do much to further the
close and cordial relations existing between the Royal Australian Navy
and the United States Navy."
COMMONWEALTH OFFICES.
MELBOURNE.
On 12th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" Cabinet to-day authorized the Minister for the Interior ( M1r.
Johnson) to proceed with the acquisition of land of an area of about
94 acres, bounded by fSpring, Victoria, Latrobe, Exhibition and Lonsdale-
streets, Melbourne, for Commonwealth office -purposes. The land
is occupied by buildings, factories and residences, generally old and of
poor class. Development of the site for Commonwealth purposes will
be undertaken in stages. It is not intended to disturb owners or
occupiers for some time as it is not likely that the first stage of the
new office ' building will be commenced for about two years. Since June,
1946, the ' Commonwealth has acquired properties, such as the Oddfellows
Building, Reliance House, Chancery House and Henty House,
and it is intended to dispose of these and concentrate activities in the
new offices when erected." HEALTH.
ACOUSTIC LABORATORY.
On 12th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
In 1946, Cabinet approved of the Department of Health taking
over the acoustic laboratory at Sydney from the National Health and
Medical Research Council. At the request of the Department of 
Repatriation, the activities of the laboratory have included the servicing
and maintenance of hearing-aid equipment for ex-servicemen.
Branch laboratories at Perth and Melbourne have been established.
Cabinet decided to-day to establish the acoustir laboratory service
to handle work for the Department of Repatriation at Sydney, Melbourne,
Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth."

MINING.
MICA INDUSTRY.
On 12th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Cabinet decided to-day that Commonwealth control of the mica
industry be continued for a further period of one year from 1st
January, 1948. The matter will be further reviewed before the expiration
of that period. Twenty portable air compressors will be obtained
from the Commonwealth Government from stocks at present availa-
ble in Australia for outright sale or hire purchase to mica-miners.
Mica is a strategic mineral of first-class importance and development
of the industry is essential in Australia both for national development
and defence."
( For earlier references, please see No. 11, page 14; 118, page 25; 126, page 42.)
URANIUM.
On 12th January, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
Under the Atomic Energy ( Control of Minerals) Act, the Commonwealth
Government took power in 1946 to control production and
distribution of uranium, thorium, plutonium, or any of their respective
compounds or other substances which may be used for the -production
of atomic energy.
Following discussions in 1947 with the State Departments of
Mines, a programme of investigation of resources of radio-active
minerals has been carried out in Australia. The more important
localities of investigation are the beach sands of the east coast of Australia
( thorium), the Mount Fainter and Radium Hill areas of South
Australia ( uranium), and the Port Hedland area of Western Australia
( uranium and thorium).
Cabinet decided to-day that the following rewards be approved in
connexion with the discovery of uranium ore.-
A reward of Å“ 1,000 for the discovery of any new deposit of uranium ore
which, in the opinion of the Minister, is of economic significance. A new deposit
to be defined as a deposit more than 15 miles from any known occurrence.
A reward of a further Å“ 2,000 for discoveries which, in the opinion of the
Minister, are capable -of producing 25 tons of uranium oxide, and a pro rata
payment for any additional quantities in excess of 25 tons of uranium oxide.
730-3 
" 1The Minister will reserve the right to make payments of amounts
to be determined by him to discoverers of new deposits which, although
themselves not capable of yielding any substantial quantity of uraniumn
oxide, may lead to the discovery of other deposits of importance."
( rar earlier references, please see No. 112, page 48.)
LEAD-CONTROL.
On 12th January, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
The supply position of lead is very difficult in Britain and lead
exported by Australia takes the place of that which would have to be
procured by Britain from Canada and Mexico, involving the expenditure
of dollars. The matter was dealt with by Cabinet in July, 1947y;
but the Minister for ' Supply ( Senator Ashley) informed Cabinet to-day
that there was evidence of dealers continuing to hold scrap lead.
Cabinet decided that a further census of scrap lead be taken and
dealers be required to, furnish details of their holdings at quarterly
intervals thereafter. Export licences will be granted in respect of
per cent. of declared holdings provided that holders furnish satisfactory
evidence that the balance, including 50 per cent, of antimonial lead,
has been sold for consumption in Australia. It is estimated that
accumulated stocks of scrap lead in Australia amount to about 8,000
tons, which could be turned to considerable advantage in the present
dollar crisis." MIGRATION.
GOVERNMENT POLICY-TRANSPORT BY AIR.
On 12th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Cabinet to-day approved of the Minister for Immigration ( Mr.
Calwell) approaching the British Government to ascertain its views
regarding the transport of British migrants to Australia by air. After
full investigation the matter will be again submitted to Cabinet for
final consideration SHIP BUILDING.
PROGRAMME-FURTHER REVISION.
On 12th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Cabinet approved to-day of the construction of four additional
class motor vessels to be propelled by the Doxford type diesel
engine-making a total of twelve of this class of vessel ( six diesel and
six steam) in the Australian shipbuilding programme. Cabinet also
approved of the construction of four C class vessels, two of which
will be propelled by double-compound reciprocating marine engines and
two by N-E type marine engines 
CIVIL DEFENCE.
BOMBING-COMMITTEE APPOINTED.
On 12th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
In October 1947, confidential documents were received by the
Minister for Works ( Mr. Lemmon) from the British Ministry of Works
giving an analysis of damage caused by bombs, including the flying
bomb and rocket projectiles, and of the effect of atomic bombs.
Cabinet decided to-day that a Cabinet sub-committee comprising
the Minister for Defence ( Mr. Dedman), the Postmaster-General
( Senator Cameron), the Minister for the Interior ( Mr. Johnson), the
Minister for Works ( Mr. Lemmon) and. myself be appointed to arrange
for a group of senior officers with specialized knowledge to be appointed
from appropriate departments to advise the Cabinet sub-committee".
ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY.
FIRST NAVAL MEMBER.
On 12th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" In August, 1944, War Cabinet decided that, on the completion of
the term of appointment of Admiral -Sir Louis Hamilton as First Naval
Member, an officer of the Royal Australia * n Navy should be appointed as
First Naval Member and Chief of the Naval Staff.
Cabinet decided to-day that Rear-Admiral J. A. Collins be
appointed as First Naval Member and Chief of the Naval Staff. Rear-
Admiral Collins has just completed an Imperial Defence College course

SOUTH-EAST ASIA.
SCHOLARSHIPS.
On 12th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Cabinet decided to-night that provision be made for the establishment
of three Australian scholarships for students from South-east
Asian countries. The scholarships will be founded by the Commonwealth
Government at Australian universities; the approximate annual
cost being estimated at Å“ 5,000. It was considered that the provisions of
opportunities in Australia for the students concerned would give further
practical evidence of the goodwill of the Australian people towards the
peoples of the countries concerned, such as India, Pakistan, Burma,
Malaya, Ceylon, -Siam, Philippines and Indonesia. Arrangements for
the selection of scholars and their welfare in Australia will be worked
out by the Department of External Affairs and Post-war Reconstruction
in co-operation with consular or diplomatic representatives 
RECONSTRUCTION.
BRETTON WOODS AGREEMENT-INTERNATIONAL
MONETARY FUND AND BANK DIRECTOR.
On 13th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" Australia is eligible to participate in an election for the fourteenth
Director of the International Monetary Fund and International Bank
respectively. It is proposed to nominate the Secretary to the Treasury
( Mr. S. G. McFarlane) for the executive directorship of both organizations.
It is intended that the Commonwealth Statistician ( Dr. R.
Wilson) will be the alternate director should Mr. McFarlane be elected.
The tenure of office will be until September, 1948
( Mr. McFarlane was later elected unopposed.)
GOVERNMENT'S PLANS-SECONDARY INDUSTRY,
DIVISION OF INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.
On 21st January, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
" The Chairman of the Secondary Industries Commission ( Mr.
J. K. Jensen) has discussed with me the position of manufacturing
industries in Australia, having particular regard to their greatly
increased importance relative to the Australian economy as a whole and
to the fact that the condition of full employment now being experienced
will tend to reduce the tempo at which sound expansion of manufacture
can take place in the near future. We have also discussed the danger
inherent in the present situation that some ventures may be started
which are likely to be short-lived.
The Australian manufacturing industry to-day gives employment
to nearly 30 per cent. of the Australian labour force. Its growth,
through the diversification of production, material assets and employment
opportunities, has given added strength and resiliency to the
whole economy.
" In framing financial and general economic policy, governments
and public authorities generally must ensure that the manufacturing
industries continue to be given, within the limits of our resources, every
opportunity to flourish and to develop, so that in turn they may continue
to make their maximum contribution to the national policy of full
employment. To this end, Mr. Jensen has represented to me that as
much information as possible should be collated and made public regarding
the structure and operation of manufacturing industry. Such
information should be of use to management and entrepreneurs who
are directly responsible for the operation of established ventures and
the launching of new ones.
The statistical information currently available aims only at giving
a broad picture of the structure of industry. While it presents invaluable
information, it is evident that additional data are desirable in
, order to appreciate the position at any particular time of any one industry.
For the guidance both of public authorities and of private interest, 
therefore, we must aimu where possible to improve the information-which
can be made available, whether it be from current statistics or from the
results of special surveys. Sometimes such additional information is
of a kind that cannot be reduced to statistical presentation. The sort
of information which I have in mind includes particulars about existing
and projected productive capacity; the demand for products; the age
and relative efficiency of machinery and plants.
As a result of the willing co-operation of industrialists with which
it has been associated, the Division of Industrial Development has
accumulated much information about manufacturing in Australia.
I have arranged that this division, drawing on its own resources and
the resources of other government departments associated in this field,
should prepare for public information periodical reviews, bringing
together all the relevant information that can be obtained about as
many manufacturing industries as possible.
In preparing these reviews no attempt will be made by the division
to ask manufacturers to give any additional information regarding
their operations unless the manufacturers themselves find it expedient
to do so FIFTH SECURITY LOAN.
TERMS ANNOUNCED.
On 13th January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
The long-term interest rate on bonds and inscribed stock issued for
the next loan to be raised by the Commonwealth Government will be
maintained at Å“ 3 2s. 6d. per cent. The same rate applied to the
successful Third and Fourth Security Loans floated in 1947. The
securities to be issued will be for a period of approximately twelve
years. Once again there will be no short-term securities."
On 4th February, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
The next Commonwealth cash loan will open on 14th April, 194S.
The amount to be sought for repatriation, rehabilitation and public
works of the Commonwealth and States will be Å“ 35,000,000. The loan
will be raised under the title of Fifth Security Loan.
The loan campaign will close on 5th May, 1948, but the Treasurer
reserves the right to close the loan at any earlier time if he should
consider that course desirable."
WHEAT STABILIZATION PLAN SCHEME.
POST-WAR-CONTINUANCE, MI-NISTER'S
ANNOUNCEMENT.
On 15th January, 1948, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture
( Mr. Pollard) announced that from 19th January, 1948, and to
the conclusion of the marketing of the 1951-52 wheat crop a price of
6s. 3d. a bushel bulk f. o. r. ports would apply for all wheat sold by the 
Australian Wheat Board for human consumption and stock feed within
Australia. The Commonwealth Government would guarantee a price of
6s. 3d. a bushel bulk f. o. r. ports for all wheat sold by the Australian
Wheat Board for consumption within Australia and for all wheat
exported. The guaranteed price would be dependent on the States
passing legislation identical with that required as complementary to
the Wheat Stabilization Act of 1946 except in respect to the essential
price alteration necessary to that Act to guarantee 6s. 3d. a bushel bulk
f. o. r. ports. State complementary legislation would have to operate for
the 1948-49 crop.
In the event of the Cost of Inquiry Committee recommending an
index accepted as practicable by the Commonwealth Government, consideration
would be given to varying the price up or down according to
the index variation.
The operation of the plan would continue with the following alterations-
the contribution of 50 per cent. would start under the new plan
at 6s. 3d. a bushel bulk instead of 5s. 3d. a bushel bagged. The ceiling
at which contributions stopped would be 10s. 7d. a bushel bulk instead
of 9s. 6d. a bushel bagged.
Stabilization contributions already collected on the 1945-46 crop
would be distributed to growers not later than December, 1948, in proportion
to their deliveries to the board -but no further distributious
from the fund would be made except as Cabinet approved in the light of
the position at the time. After disbursal of the 1945-46 contributions,
Å“ 20,000,000 would be regarded as a reasonable minimum for the fund.
The scheme would be reviewed -before the end of the 1951-52 season.
The decisions followed the presentation on 18th December, 1947, of
an interim report by the Cost of Inquiry Committee. The committee
found a cost figure of 6s. a bushel at sidings. Conversion of that price
to a bulk f. o. r. basis indicated a price of 6s. 8d. a bushel. Having
regard to the long-range security provided and the profitable return to
a reasonably efficient producer, the Government adopted 6s. 3d. a bushcl
bulk f. o. r. ports as a fair proposition to all concerned including consumers
and stock feeders. The price represented an increase of about
is. 4d. a ' bushel bulk f. o. r. ports for home consumption purposes and
Is. 3d. a bushel in the overall guaranteed price. With a refund to
growers of about is. 1.5d. the 1945-46 fund contribution for that year's
crop would return them 7s. 4.5d. a bushel bulk ( less freight). It was estimated
that final returns for the 1946-47 crop would amount to 7s. 9d.
a bushel bulk ( less freight).
The crop now being harvested would give a price return substan-.
tially in excess of the 1945-46 and 1946-47 crops. The plan in its
revised form, if accepted by the States and growers, would give effective
security for four crops after the one now being harvested. In the
absence of Commonwealth marketing powers, complementary legislation
by the States was essential.

DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION.
DIRECT OR-GENERAL.
On 15th January, 1948, the Minister for Information ( Mr.
, Calwell) announced that the Director-General of Information ( Mr.
E. G. Bonney) had resigned and would take over the Directorship of
the Australian News and Information Bureau at New York. The
Chief Publicity Officer of the Department ( Mr. K. Murphy) would be

CONVERSION LOAN.
LONDON OPERATION, JANUARY, 1948.
On 22nd January, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" A conversion loan is being floated at London to convert a New
South Wales loan of Å“ 17,870,000, bearing interest at 51 per cent. per
annum, over which an option of conversion is held by the Government.
The terms of the new loan are: Issue price 984, interest rate 3
per cent, per annum, maturity date 1st May, 1965, with the option to the
Government of prior redemption on or after 1st May, 1963.
Conversion offer will be made to all existing holders of the old
loan but issue of new stock will be limited to Å“ 12,870,000, as Å“ 5,000,000
of old stock is being redeemed. The new loan will result in a substantial
saving of interest to the New South Wales Government."
BURMA.
BURMESE DELEGATION.

PEACE.
-JAPAN-MINISTER'S STATEMENT, FEBRUARY, 1948.
-On 3rd February, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.
Evatt) said:
" Australia is concerned over the consequences following the breakdown
in the Council of Foreign Ministers at London in December,
1947, and the inability of the major Powers to reach an agreement
on the European settlement. These consequences are far-reaching,
and have serious repercussions on the whole United Nations Organization,
which was established on the assumption that there would be
early peace settlements and that the unanimity of the malor Powers
would be continued after the wvar. Another adverse result is that the
Japanese peace settlement is held up. Once again it is being
demonstrated by somewhat bitter experience that in international
affairs peace and justice are indivisible.
" The Australian Government believes in greater participation by
all those countries which actually participated in war and made a
substantial contribution to victory. It will be one of the main objects
of the discussions to, see how such participation can be most appropriately
effected in the interests of -world peace. Firsthand information
on the general situation from the Australian missions abroad, together
with the personal experience of the officers mentioned, should
be of great assistance in defining the scope and methods of Australia's
participation." ( ror earlier references, please see No. 108, page 40; No. 124, page 26;
No. 127, page 35; No. 129, page 9.)
On 4th February, 1948, Dr. Evatt said:
The Australian Government has kept the United States Government
continuously informed of its views on the Japanese settlement and
the procedure which should be followed in formulating the peace treaty.
After the British Commonwealth Conference at Canberra in August,
1947, I visited the United States and discussed Japan with President
Truman, the Secretary of State ( Mr. Marshall) and other American
leaders and officials. Further talks on Japan have taken place at
Washington since my return.
" Throug-hout, the Australian Government has emphasized the need
for a just and lasting peace based on the principles of the United
Nations Charter and -contributing to the security and welfare of all
the peoples of Eastern Asia and the Pacific. Australia has stressed
the urgency of reaching a definite settlement-an urgency to which
General MacArthuir and the Canberra Conference have also drawn
attenltion. Australia, because of her war effort and her position in the
Pacific, is entitled to be a party principal in these negotiations, and
our constant consultations with the United States Government are an
indication that our position has been recognized in the talks that have
so far taken place. 
" The delay in formulating a treaty for Japan is most unsatisfactory.
The uncertainty as to the future of Japan is impeding the
attainment of stability in the Far East, and preventing the formation
of long-term plans by the countries of that area, including Australia.
The chief disagreement concerns the membership and system of voting
for the -peace conference. But the broad lines of the settlement itself
have been indicated by the agreements made at Cairo, Yalta and
Potsdam, and by the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission.
Therefore, the Australian Government does not accept the present
impasse as being in dny way final, and is taking every practicable
diplomatic step to overcome the deadlock and bring -about a conference
that will secure the agreement of all Powers which contributed
directly to the defeat of Japan."
JAPAN-PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT, FEBRUARY,
1948.
Ine Parliament.-On 19th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr.
Chifley) said:
" I regret that is not possible to announce a date for the assembling
of the conference to draw up the Japanese peace treaty. A deadlock
has been reached in regard to this matter. I believe that the Soviet
Government takes the view that the treaty should be dealt with in the
first place by the foreign ministers of the four major Powers. Of
course, that is not acceptable to Australia, and I believe that it is not
acceptable to a number of other nations. It is generally considered
that all nations which participated in the war against Japan in the
Pacific area should take part in the peace conference. Every endeavour
has been made to over-come the present deadlock, but I -cannot say
xhether the suggestions made are acceptable or not."
AUSTRALIAN POLICY-MINISTER'S STATEMENT,
MARCH, 1948.
On 21st March, 1948, Dr. Evatt said:
" The present situation can be described only as a ' drift' towards
war. In other words, no one wants war, no one can afford to suffer the
further losses of war and reduce living conditions even further-yet
nations can ' drift' to war. It is almost as though nations were
inanimate objects being carried inevitably down a stream, instead of
being human beings, with feelings, hopes and ideal;, with full control
through their responsible leaders of their destiny. The present condition
of drift is, therefore, a challenge to all responsible leaders. War
can come only as a result of absence of leadership in world affairs.
The United Nations is the main hope for peace and improved
living conditions throughout the world. The best positive help citizens
of goodwill can give in world affairs to-day is to throw their weight
behind the United Nations. The United Nations has its faults of
1860-2 
procedure; but attacks made upon it now are reminescent of attacks
made on the League of Nations by those who found it expedient to
side-step the League and act independently of it, -and who contributed
to its weakening and to World War II.
The peoples of the world are entitled to a peace-a peace based
on justice. It is sheer defeatism to accept the pessimistic and sometimes
evil prognostications of those who light-heartedly anticipate a
third world war and the consequent destruction of civilization. Loyal
and consistent support for the United Nations offers a way out, providing
its machinery is employed to achieve settlements based on justice
and not on power. Australia has always taken, and will continue to
take, a lead in advocating this view. The United Nations, and it alone,
can arrest the drift towards war. This drift is now being welcomed
by the deadly enemies of the Allies of the war not yet concluded by
peace treaties-the open and secret followers of Ritlerism and
Fascism. Nothing that can be done should be left undone so far as Australia
is concerned to prevent the utter catastrophe of another war. The
people of Australia who still suffer from the terrible losses of human
life of World W-ar II., who still remember the cruel anxieties and fears
which accompanied the war, and who are now successfully restoring
in an economy of full employment the human and material losses of
the war, will welcome the constitution of a National Committee for
the United Nations in Australia, for it is only through the United
Nations that peace can be achieved.
There is no problem or dispute in the world which -cannot be
settled in terms of peace and justice. But the way to settlement is
through the United Nations, and not along the lines of power politics,
w. hich have no regard to the facts and justice of each dispute. We
rmust, at all costs, arrest the drift towards war, which is wanted by no
responsible human being in the world. In this high endeavour, Australia
and Australians can take as prominent a part as they did in the
long and still unfinished fight against Hitlerism and Fascism."

PERMANENT FORGES-RETIREMENT SCHEME.
On 16th March, 1948, the Minister for Defence ( Mr. Dedman)
said-" Cabinet decided to-day that legislation be prepared for submission
to the Federal Parliamentary Labour party to provide a
uniform scheme of retirement benefits for members of the permanent
naval, military and air forces.
" At present, the retirement provisions for the permanent forces
differ in the respective service, the provision for naval personnel and
air force officers being a system of deferred pay, while airmen below
commissioned rank and members of the permanent military forces contribute
to the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund. The deferred pay
system has unsatisfactory features, particularly in that it makes inadequate
provision for a member's dependants in the event of death or
invalidity. The recent reduction of the retiring ages of army officers
renders the public service superannuation scheme inappropriate for
application in their case.
In the formulation of the proposed uniform retirement scheme
regard has been paid to the retirement benefits provided for the forces
of Britain and other Dominions.
The scheme will be contributory, providing a rate of pension
appropriate to each rank. Pensions will be payable on retirement or
discharge, subject to the member's having completed not less than
twenty years' service after age twenty and, in the case of officers, to the
member's having reached the retiring age of his particular rank. To
cater for officers who enter the services some years later than the normal
ages of entry, pensions at reduced rates will be provided for officers who
reach the retiring age for their rank after completing at least fifteen
years but less than twenty years' service. Officers with ten years, but
less than fifteen years' service, from age twenty on retirement or discharge
will receive a refund of their contributions to the fund, plus a
gratuity equal to 150 per cent, of their contributions. The scale of
contributions will be same as under the Commonwealth Public Service
Superannuation Scheme, and the maximum pension will also be the
same. " The proposed scale of retirement pensions for officers ranges from
Å“. 275 a year for an army captain and equivalent navy and air force
ranks retiring at or about age 45 to Å“ E845 a year for a lieutenantgeneral
and equivalent ranks retiring at age 60. The basic pensions
proposed for members below commissioned rank who are discharged
after age 40 after serving not less than twenty years range from
a year for a private -and equivalent navy and air force ranks, to Å“ 155
a year for a Warrant Officer, Class and equivalent ranks. Additional
amounts of pension ( from Å“ 6 a year for private to Å“ 8 a year for
warrant officer will be provided for each year of service beyond
twenty years' service for pension after age twenty, under definite
engagement. Pensions for naval warrant officers and officers commissioned
from warrant rank, and for army quartermasters, will range 
from Å“ 300 a year for warrant officer ( navy) and lieutenant and quartermaster
( army), to Å“ 450 a year for lieutenant-commander ex-warrant
officer ( navy) and major and quartermaster ( army). The pension for
a naval commander ex-warrant officer wvill be Å“ 550 a year. Due to the
early retiring ages of members of the services as compared with civil
servants, payment of the pensions proposed will involve a substantially'
greater Commonwealth subsidy than is required in the case of the public
service superannuation scheme.
" The scheme provides that a member below commissioned -rank
who is not re-enlisted ou completion of his current engagement and who
has not qualified for pension will receive a refund of -his contribution
to the fund, plus a gratuity equal to 150 per cent. of the refund. The
gratuity will not be less than a sum calculated at the rate of Å“ 30 for
each completed year of service, subject to a proviso that the gratuity
payable to a member who retires before completion of twelve years'
service shall not exceed Å“ 120.
The scheme provides that where a member dies in the service, his
widow will receive one-half of the full pension which would be payable
at age 60 in respect of the contributions being paid by the member
prior to his death. On the death of a pensioned member, his widow
will receive a pension at one-half the rate which was paid to the
pensioner while alive. In cases of total permanent incapacity, it is
proposed that the member will receive a pension on the same basis as
would be payable in such circumstances to a contributor to the Commonwealth
Superannuation Fund. Where the degree of incapacity is
less than 60 per cent, benefits will be adjusted accordingly.
" It is proposed that all future appointees or enlistees to the
permanent forces ( except other ranks, initially engaged for less than
six years) will be compulsory contributors to the Defence Forces Retirement
Fund. Members already contributing to the Commonwealth
Superannuation Fund will transfer their existing rights to the Defence
Forces Retirement Fund. Deferred pay standing to the credit of members
of the naval forces and air force oficers will be utilized to purchase
full units of pension, and such members will contribute for the balance
of unit elements appropriate to the pay received. In the case of
present serving members of naval and air forces who may consider that
the existing deferred pay scheme is more advantageous may, at their
option, stay out of the scheme and accept one of the following
alternatives: To retain deferred pay at p~ resent at credit: this amiount to he paid with
interest at 31 per cent, on death or retirement. Member to contribute for
additional unit elements not covered by deferred pay and to receive ro rata
benefits only.
To continue uinder existing deferred pay scheme and make no contributions
to the Defence Forces Retirement Fuind.
" The advantages of the new scheme are so substantial that it is
anticipated that most members will elect to participate in it.
" Eligibility for full pension rights under the proposed scheme will
be subject to the member agreeing, if required by the service, to serve
on the reserve list maintained by the service of which he was a member.
1860-3 
" The scheme now approved has been framed having regard to the
necessity of providing attractive conditions of service in all ranks, and
should ensure that those who makc service in the armed forces their
career are adequately provided for when their term of service has heen
completed." CITIZEN MILITARY FORCE S-CONDITIONS.
On 5th March, 1948, Mr. Chambers announced conditions of service
for officers and other ranks of the Citizen Military Forces. Officers
would he selected firstly from those who were on the reserve of officers
and who served during World War II., secondly from persons who
served as other ranks during World War II., and in the case of
technical arms and services, from persons who possessed the necessary
civilian professional, technical or academic qualifications. An officer
appointed from the reserve of officers would he permitted to accept an
appointment in the Citizen Military Forces in a rank lower than that
held by him on the reserve. Other ranks would he enlisted hetween
the ages of 18 and 35 for the Citizen Military Forces field force, and
between the ages of 18 and 45 for Citizen Military Forces fixed establishiments
on the mainland; the ages of discharge being 40 and 48
respectively. INDUSTRIAL.
UNEMPLOYMENT-FIGURES.
On 4th February, 1948, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway)
said that at 31st December, 1947, unfilled vacancies held by the Commionwealth
Employment Service numbered 43,000 for males and 30,000
for females, compared with 90,900 at 30th November, 1947. Recipients
of unemployment benefits were 2,797 males and 68 females. During
December, the Commonwealth Employment Service had referred
14,500 males and 4,800 females to employers, and had given advice
and information on various matters to 23,600 males and 5,400 females.
On 7th February, 1948, Mr. Holloway said that at 31st January,
1948, 3,823 males and 118 females were in receipt of unemployment
benefit or re-employment allowance. The total was nearly 1,100 higher
than that recorded at December, 1947, but the rise was more than
aecounted for by the normal seasonal movement in Queensland.
At 31st January, 1948, unfilled vacancies held by the Commonwealth
Employment Service numbered 55,300 for males and 36,900 for females.
The total was 19,200 greater than at December, 1947.
NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES.
POLICY-MEDIATION.
On 4th February, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.
Evatt) said-
" Following the recent truce agreement, negotiations between the
Dutch and Indonesians are continuing, but no result will be announced
until after the Committee of Good Offices has reported to the Security 
Council. The conmittee has arrived at -New York. It is possible that
the council, after considering the report, will ask the committee to
remain in the Netherlands East Indies for a further period.
The sending, of fourteen Australian military officers to Java is to
assist in the carrying cut of the cease fire plan which includes an
agreement for the demilitarization of a certain area between areas held
by the Dutch and indonesian forces. The committee has called on the
Governments of Belgium, the United States and Australia to supply
personnel to carry out the dctails of the plan. The main task is to I
supervise the transfer of certain groups of Indonesian troops through
the demilitarized zone to their own area. The officers will be carrying
out a non-military function, but it is thought preferable to use military
men for such a task.
" Relations of the Australian representatives in Java with both the
Dutch and Indonesians arc excellent and Dutch Government representatives
at The Hague and Indonesian leaders have expressed appreciation
of their work

BANKING CONTROL.
LEGISLAT1ON-NATIONALIZATION, COURT REARING.
On 7th February, 194S, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" In view of the importance of the Banking Act case before the High
Court of Australia. the A ttorney-Gen eral ( Dr. Evatt) will lead for the
Commonwealth and the other defendants. Dr. Evatt and the Solicitor-
General ( Professor K. H. Bailey) will appear in their official capacities
for the defendants PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.
EXPORTS TO BRITAIN-LONG-TERM CONTRACTS, EGGS,
EXTENSION.
On 9th February, 194S, the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Pollard)
announced that an agreement had been reached between the British
Ministry of Food and the Commonwealth for the purchase of Australian
eggs in shell, frozen egg pulp, and egg, powder. The existing contract,
which was to have been effective until 30th June, 1950, would terminate
on 30th June, 1948, and the new contract would commence with the
season 1948-49 and extend up to and including the season 1952-53.
The new contract envisaged that yearly progressive increases in production
and export should commence in .1948-49, the objective being to
a-chieve an export target of 105,000,0,00 dozens a season, in all forms.
In the event of Australian exports not expanding sufficiently to provide
a total shipment during 1949-50 and 1950-51 of the equivalent of
4,500,000 cases, the British Ministry would have the right to call in
January, 1951, for a review or revision of the quantities which it was
committed to accept from Australia for the balance of the contract
period. 
To achieve before 1952-53 the full increase in egg exports as desired
by the British Ministry, Australian egg production must be increased
from its present level of 124,000,000 dozen eggs a year to about
180,000,000 dozen. That would mean an increase of 5,500,000 birds in
poultry flocks by 1952-53.
Prices to apply for 1948-49, 1949-50 and 1950-51 were-
Eggs in shell: 2s. 4d. a dozen; frozen whole egg ( egg pulp) Is. 8.9d. a lb.;
dried sugared egg: 5s. Id. a lb.; dried whole egg: 7s. a lb.
( These prices are for the 15 lb. pack: and prices for heavier or lighter packs
will be adjusted pro rata.)
Prices for 1951-52 and 1953 would be determined by further negotiation
not less than sixteen months before the season to which they applied
-at the beginning of the hatching season, which would substantially
determine the size of flocks for the season in question.
Oiling of shell eggs for export had been proved beneficial, and all
prices fixed for shell eggs included allowance to cover the cost of oil
processing. Maximum possible quantities were to be processed in
1948-49, and thereafter all eggs in shell would be oiled.
Only eggs which had not been washed may be included in the shell
egg pack. Packing of shell eggs must take place during the period 1st
June to 24th December in each year.
The British Ministry would be given first preference for all shell
eggs of export quality packed in Australia in the weight grades acceptable-
13 lb. to 17 lb. a long hundred-and Australian exports of shell
eggs in those grades to destinations other than Britain during the
period January to June in each year, shall not exceed 2j per cent. of
Australia's shell egg shipments to Britain during the preceding June-
December period.
AGRICULTURAL . COUNCIL MEETING-DECISIONS.
On 9th February, 1947, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)
said that a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council had been
held. Decisions were-
BRlTISH FOOD MIssIoN.-Council adopted a report from the Standing Comimittee
on Agriculture expressing the view that the possibility existed for an
expansion of food production in the Commonwealth to the mutual benefit of
Britain and Australia, and that all available resources necessary to achieve this
objective should be devoted to it by Commonwealth and State authorities.
Council, which would confer with members of the mission, accepted the committee's
view that it may be necessary, after the detailed objectives of the
ission had been clarified and its proposals further developed, to arrange a
special meeting to consider measures required to achieve increased production.
EXPORT OF FEED GRAIns.-Council considered the export of feed grains other
than wheat ( oats, feed barley, sorghum, imaize, millets and rye), and was of
opinion that they should be held in Australia in sufficient quantity to meet
the reasonable demands of the live-stock industry. Council considered that
export of established surpluses of such grains should be permitted and that each
kind of coarse grains should make its contribution to the live-stock feeding
programmes. Council was of the opinion that producers of those grains should
have the opportunity to share in both the domestic and export markets. Council
was of the opinion that the possibilities'he urgently examined of setting up a
coarse grains export authority to ensure equitable treatment to the individual
States and to producers of the various types of coarse grains in relation to the
exportation of those grains from the Commonwealth. 
TOBACCO PRODUCrTIN.-Council considered the urgent necessity to increase
production of tobacco leaf in Australia, in view of limitations imposed on the
importation of tobacco from dollar areas. Council recommended that further
consultations take place between Commonwealth and State representatives and
technical officers to evolve definite plans for increased production of tobacco leaf
of suitable quality, and that appropriate consultation take place with the
Australian Tobacco Board.
ToBAcco MARKTING.--Council considered the position in States directly concerned
regarding uniform State legislation on the marketing of tobacco. All
tobacco-producing States were not in favour of the introduction of the necessary
legislation, and Council was of the opinion that, after the present season,
any stabilized marketing of tobacco leaf must be entirely dependent on action
taken by the respective States. Council recommended that representatives of
the Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, the Australian Tobacco Board,
the Prices Commissioner and the four State Departments of Agriculture concerned
should meet to devise plans to achieve some form of stability for sub-
Lmission to Ministers and consideration at the next meeting of Council.
POTATO MARIKETING.-Council noted that the functions of the Australian
JPotato Committee had been continued to cover the 1947-48 crop, but the comnmittee
could not continue to function. If organized marketing were to continue,
a State action would be essential in the near future and for effective action coordination
of the activities of the State organizations was necessary. Growers'
organizations had approached the Commonwealth requesting continuance of
Commonwealth guaranteed prices for potatoes. The Commonwealth would be
prepared to consider such a request, but would need to be assured that marketing
was organized on a basis that would ensure supplies being spread over the
season; give a fair allocation of available supplies throughout the Commonwealth;
and prevent over-supply to markets and depressed prices.
EGc INiDUsTRY.-Council noted that from the surplus funds of the Commonwealth
Egg Control, which would probably amount finally to between Å“ 700,000
and Å“ 750,000, the Commonwealth Government had already agreed to the distribution
of Å“ 300,000 between State Egg Boards on the basis of recorded
production in each State during the period of Commonwealth control up to
June, 1947. Council was informed the Commonwealth Government considered
that it should be reimbursed from surplus funds for losses directly incurred
in connexion with egg-drying plans since their introduction in the war period.
Council decided that this be agreed to up to a maximum of Å“ 100,000. As regards
the balance of the money, Council recommended that It be distributed to State
' ga Boards pro rata to contributions to the control fund.
POULTRY Co xEcEN.--Council decided to accept an invitation from the
Danish Government to be represented at the Eighth World Congress of Poultry
Breeders at Copeuhagen in August, 1948. The Principal of the Animal Health
and Nutrition Laboratory of the West Australian Department of Agriculture
( Dr. H. W. Bennetts), and the veterinary officer of the New South Wales
Department of Agriculture ( Mr. G. L. McClymont) would be in Britain at that
time, and an approach would be made to the Commonwealth Government to
include those officers in the Australian delegation. The Commonwealth Dairy
Officer at London ( Mr. A. D. Allanson) would attend the Congress.
SuprpnEiPosSATE.-Council noted that National Security ( Superphosphate
Industry) Regulations, which incorporated the Superphosphate Industry Committee,
were discontinued from 1st anuary, 1948, and that the Minister for
Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard) had approved of the committee continuing to function
a an advisory body. EXPORTS TO BRITAIN-RICE.
On 16th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Cabinet decided to-day that the Australian rice crop of 32,000
tons should be allocated to essential needs in Australia ( hospitals,
invalids, Asiatics and the like); to New Guinea, Papua and Pacific
Islands; to Malaya and other rice-deficient countries; with a shipment
to Britain." 
WHEAT STABILIZATION SCHEME.
POST1WAR-CONTINUANCE, MINISTERS' CONFEREN( XkE.
On 11th February, 1948, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)
said that Commonwealth and State Ministers for Agriculture had
considered stabilization of the wheat industry. The amended plan of
the Commonwealth Government was the basis of the discussion. Conference
also received a submission from the Australian Wheatgrowers'
Federation setting out its views. He had indicated to State Ministe,
that he would submit to Cabinet a suggestion that the period of the
plan be extended for one year to take in the 1952-53 harvest, thus
making the initial period of operation of the plan eight years from the
1945-46 harvest. He had indicated that if the findings of the Wheat
Industry Costs Committee proved that it was impracticable to have an
index formula for adjusting costs movements, or if application of itb
findings proved impracticable, the Government would make periodi?!
review of costs movements. The Government would determine the period
of review and the machinery of review at the appropriate time. He
had undertaken to recommend to Cabinet that a properly constituted
authority be set up to provide for and determine any refund to wheatgrowers
who had an equity in the Wheat Stabilization Fund if for an. N
reason they were arbitarily forced to cease wheat growing.
On some other points State Ministers were not prepared to commit
their Government, but considered it necessary to have further consultation
with them. That applied particularly to the federation's request
that a ballot on wheat stabilization legislation should be tak,-en of all
whcatgrowers of the Commonwealth who were registered and had sown
acres or more to wheat.
It was agreed that the matter would be discussed if desired after
State Governments had considered the matter further and determined
their policy on fundamental features of the plan.

No. 133, page 23.)
POST-WAR-CONTINIANCE, EXTENSION.
On 2nd March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Cabinet to-day decided that the wheat stabilization plan be extended
by one season to cover five seasons after 1947-48.
Cabinet also approved the principle of setting aside up to half
the annual interest earned by the wheat stabilization fund to repay
approved eases in which a refund of tax payments is merited. The
latter decision covers ' hard luck cases. Further consideration will be
given to the constitution of an outhority to deal with these cases.".
BRITAIN.
FINANCIAL POLICY-PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT,
FEBRUARY, 19,48.
On 11th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" The fall in values of shares on Australian stock exchanges may
be attributed to various factors. These include the fall in overseas 
prices for grain; President Truman's various statements that something
must be done to retard rising prices and costs; and Britain's difficult
economic position because the drain on . gold reserves has not been
reduced as hoped. Speeches and statements by the British Chancellor
of the Exchequer ( Sir Stafford Cripps), backed by facts, have made
it clear that the going will be difficult. As a consequence, profits are
not being reaped as they were before.
" What happens on Australian stock exchanges is a reflection of what
has happened in Britain and the United States, where there is every
indication that a recession is coming.
There is nothing more in it as far as Australia is concerned except
in regard to prices for primary products, although these are mainly
safeguarded by firm contracts. The second factor in Australia is
concern as to rising costs. Opportunities offering to Australia for
expansion and development are the greatest in history, and I am confident
that that will take place even allowing for an overseas recession.".
TAXATION.
COMPANY TAX-PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT.
On 12th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said:
During the war, and since its conclusion, a good deal of adverse
criticism has been directed against the incidence of income taxation
on companies. Numerous published reports of annual meetings of
companies have contained references to the crushing burden of taxation,
its stifling effect on enterprise and the generally adverse economic
effects of the Government's taxation policy.
" Such comments have appeared so frequently that I am sure that,
by force of sheer repetition, they are accepted as representing the facts
of the position. So far as I am aware, no one has bothered to analyse
the burden of taxation on companies and to relate that burden to company
income levels. Obviously, taxation has increased as a result of the
war; but the incomes out of which that taxation has been paid have not
remained static, but have increased. The important factor is the relationship
between the incomes remaining to companies after payment
of taxation in the periods prior to, during, and subsequent to the war.
Australia's participation in the recent war necessitated that every
section of the community should bear a share of the tremendous cost
associated with the war. It was determined at an early date that as far
as possible Australia should, as a policy, attempt to meet war costs from
current income and so reduce borrowing to a minimum. Accordingly,
the rates and scope of all existing taxes were increased and new taxes
imposed so as to ensure as far as possible that equality of sacrifice
was achieved between the various components of the community. Row
successful this policy proved has now become part and parcel of the
financial history of the Commonwealth.
It was realized that the primary and most flexible source of war
revenue was income tax, since by a graduated income tax there is
achieved the maximum degree of equity between individual taxpayers 
and equality of sacrifice. The rates of individual income tax wore
increased in 1940, 1941, and again in 1943, when they reached their
peak. Companies, in their turn, were called upon to make some contribution
to the cost of the war.
" Immediately before the outbreak of war companies were liable,
for Commonwealth purposes, to normal tax, imposed at a fiat rate of
is. 1. Sd. in the Å“ 1 on each Å“ 1 of their taxable income. A private
company, which mnay be broadly defined as a company which is under
the control of not more than seven persons and whiceh is not a company
in which the public is substantially interested, was liable for the additional
tax which would have been payable by its shareholders if the
undistributed amount had been distributed. In addition, companies
were liable to various income taxes imposed by the States.
" According to the Commonwealth Year Book ( Vol. 36, p. 745)
collections from companies in the financial year 1938-1939 were as
follows Commonwealth collections 4,300,0001
State collections 11,498,000 15,798,000
" Reference to the ' Twenty-second Report of the Commissioner of
Taxation shows that, for Commonwealth purposes, companies derived
a taxable income of Å“ 81,456,000 during the in-come year 1937-1938,
the year to which collections for the financial year 1938-1939 are
related. The variations between the States and the Commonwealth in the
manner of ascertaining taxable income would raise the total taxable
income to about Å“ 89,000,000 for all companies. Collections of
Å“ 15,800,000 on this taxable income represent an overall effective rate
of tax of 43.61d. or approximately 3s. Sd. in the For the year in
question, therefore, companies, after payment of tax, had a total
amount of profit available either for distribution or to place to reserves
of Å“ 73,200,000. For the financial years 1939-1940 and 1940-1941 the rates of
normal tax were increased to 2s. in the and in 1941-1942 the rate
was increased to 4s. in the In 1942-1943, -with the introduction
of uniform taxation, -companies were no longer subject to State income
tax. To compensate for suspension of State tax, the rate of normal
Commonwealth tax was increased from 4s. in the Å“ 1 to 6s. in the as
the average rate of tax imposed on companies by the States was about
2s. in the This point is frequently overlooked by critics who claim
that the Commonwealth rate of normal company tax has increased by
4s. 10.4d. ( that is, from Is. 1.8d. to whereas in reality, the rate has
increased by only 2s. 10.4d.
" Companies were, of course, subjected to other imposts in addition
to an in-crease in the rate of normal company tax. 
" Private companies continued throug hout the war and to the
present time to be subject to the additional tax paid under' Division
7 of the Income Tax A-ssessment Act. The amount of this tax is
determined by reference to the amount of additional tax which would
have been payable by the shareholders of the company if the company
had paid the undistributed portion as a dividend. These assessments,
as a consequence, reflected the rates of tax payable by individuals,
which, as mentioned above, reached their peak in the financial year
1943-1944.
Much has been made of the incidence of this tax, it being claimed
that it involves very high rates of tax. This view has arisen primarily
because the Division 7 tax has been related to the undistributed amount
and not to the taxable income, which is the true haze.
The Twenty-sixth Annual Report of the Commissioner of Taxation
( page 12) shows that for the financial year 1943-1944 private
companies were assessed to Å“ 8,650,000 Division 7 tax on an undistributed
income of Å“ 12,560,000. The average rate of Division 7 tax
was therefore 165.3d. for each Å“ 1 of the undistributed amount. However,
the taxable income of private companies in that year was.
Å“ 51,486,000, so that the total Division 7 tax of Å“ 9,730,000 ( comprising
Å“ 8,650,000 actually assessed and Å“ 1,080,000 estimated to be assessed)
represents an average rate on the taxable income of 45.5d. in the Å“ 1.
Although it may be considered that even the average rate -of
45.5d. for Division 7 tax is high, it must be remembered that where
a dividend is paid by a private company out of profits which have borne
tax under Division 7 that dividend is virtually tax free in the hands of
the shareholders, as they are entitled to a rebate of the tax -attributable
to the inclusion of the dividend in the taxable income. No precise
figures are available as to the amount of such tax free dividends, but
some indication of their volume may be derived from the fact that in
the income year 1943-1944 resident private companies paid dividends
amounting to just over Å“ 19,000,000, the major portion of -which may
be assumed to have been paid from funds which had borne Division
7 tax. Non-private companies were also required to contribute their
share to the rising costs of the war. As from the financial year
1940-1941, non-private companies became liable for a super tax of
is. in the Å“ 1 on that part of their taxable income in excess of Å“ 5,000.
A super-tax rebate is allowed to avoid the dual payment of super-tax
on income derived by a company and on dividends paid by that
company to another company out of income on which super tax has.
been paid or is payable.
" From the financial year 1940-1941, non-private companies have
also been liable to a further tax of 2s. in the Å“ 1 on that portion of their
taxable income which has not been distributed as dividends. The yield
from this further tax has never exceeded Å“-2,000,000 annually.
War-time ( Company) Tax was also imposed on non-private companies
for the financial year 1940-1941 et seq. This tax differed from. 
the war-time profits tax imposed during World War I. and the British
Excess Profits Tax. These latter taxes adopted a standard of pre-war
profits and sought to drain off any profits in excess of this standard as
being attributable to excess war profits. The War-time ( Company)
Tax, however, was designed to levy tax on the basis of the percentage
of the taxable profit to the capital employed.
The number of companies which have been assessed to Wartime
( Company) Tax has never been large-in fact, only 757 companies
were so assessed for the financial year 1944-1945. These 757
companies were assessed to Å“ 4,390,000 on a taxable profit of
Å“ 28,500,000. The total taxable income of the companies concerned
amounted to Å“ 45,400,000, the War-time ( Company) Tax therefore
being imposed at an effective average rate of only some 23s. 2d. If the
total taxable income of all public companies, Å“ 98,621.000, is taken
into account in weighing the effect of War-time ( Company) Tax,
the effective average rate is only 10.7d. in the Å“ 1.
" In considering the incidence of War-time ( Company) Tax, it
should be remembered that, in determining the amount of War-time
( Company) Tax payable, the amount of super tax payable by the
company is allowed as a rebate from the War-time ( Company) Tax
otherwise payable. The allowance of the rebate has the practical
effect of rendering many companies non-taxable for the purposes of
War-time (' Company) Tax.
Having briefly surveyed the existing taxes on companies and
commented on their individual incidence, it may be of interest to set
out, as accurately as available statistics permit, the total weight of
taxation on both private and non-private companies. The main source
of these statistics are the Annual Reports of the Commissioner of
Taxation. " In the financial year 1944-1945 private companies were
assessed to the following taxes on a total taxable income of Å“ 55,500,000,
which was derived during the year ended June 30, 1944-
Normal tax at Gs. in the Å“ 1 15.690.000
Division 7 tax actually assessed to 30th June, 1946 2,289,000
Estimated to be assessed after 30th June, 1946 1,342,000 3,631,000
19,321,000
Thus, for the financial year 1944-1945, private companies paid
on their total taxable income, an average rate of 83.5d. in the Å“ 1.
" It must, however, be observed that the Division 7 tax payable
in respect of the financial year 1944-1945 was reduced by 75 per cent.
as a result of the introduction of the system of pay-as-you-earn.
Consequently, the ' average rate of tax arrived at above is not representative
of all years.
" The Division 7 tax payable in respect of the financial year
1943-44 ( in which year the peak war-time rates were first operative) 
amuounted to Å“ 9,743,000 on a taxable income of Å“ 51,486,000 representing
the levy of Division 7 tax at an average rate of 45.5d. in'the E1.
If this rate is accepted as typical of the Division 7 tax payable when
rates were at their peak, the overall rate of 194445 would have been
113.3d., if the 75 per cent. rebate had not been granted.
Preliminary figures for the financial year 1945-1946 tend to
confirm this overall average rate, the tentative 1945-19-48 figure being
115.8d. It can be said then that the overall average rate of tax paid by
private companies when rates -of tax were at their highest approximated
9.6d. in the Å“ 1.
" For the financial year 1944-1945 ( income year 1943-1944), the
taxable income of public companies amounted to Å“ 98,621,000. These
companies were assessed to the following taxes:
Normal tax at Gs. in the Å“ 1 26,780,000
Super tax 3,803,000
Part lIIIA:
Actually assessed to 30th June, 1946 1,989,000
Estimated to be assessed after 30thl June,
1946 110,000 2,099,000
War-time ( Conipany) Tax -4,390,000 37,072,000
" The overall average rate of tax paid by public companies for the
financial year 1944-1945 was therefore 90.2d.
" Although public companies appear to have an advantage over
private companies in that the overall average rate of tax paid by them
is less than that paid by private companies, any dividends paid by
public companies are, in the generality of cases, fully taxable in the
bands of the individual recipient. On the other hand, dividends paid
by private companies out of funds which have borne tax under Division
7 may be regarded for all practical purposes, as exempt in the hands
of the shareholder.
11I think that it is, therefore, fair to say that the effective rate
of tax imposed on all companies over the war years would approximate
in the Li-or 7s. 6d. in the In the light of the sacrifices
and demands made upon other sections of the community, I do not
think that companies have been unfairly treated by the incidence of
income taxation, -In fact, when compared with the weight of company
taxation in other countries, companies in Australia have escaped lightly
over the war years.
But what has been the general effect on companies of the in-creased
rates of taxation? In 1938-1939, the combined collections from company
income tax by the Commonwealth and the States were nearly
Å“ 16,000,000; 1944-1945, Commonwealth collections from companies
amounted to Å“ 60,000,000. The initial reaction is that during the war
years, the profits avail-able to companies after payment Of tax must
have diminished considerably in order to meet the additional taxes
of some Å“ 44,000,000. But such has not been the case. Since 1938-1939, 
the national income has increased by some 64 per cent., and companies
have enjoyed a similar increase in their taxabte incomes. The net
result h-as been that, despite the burden of war taxation, companies
have had more available, either for distribution to shareholders or to
place to reserve, than they had in pre-war years. This I regard as at
tribute to the manner in which my Government has financed the war
and created conditions of relative economic prosperity.
The extent to which net company profits have increased over the
war years is apparent from the following table which is based uponL

" It is noteworthy that dividends paid by companies to residents
have never fallen below the 1938-1939 level, and had, in fact, by
1946-1947, increased by nearly 40 per cent. Further, the undistributed
profits accruing to residents have at least been maintained over the
war year-s and are now displaying an upward trend.
" In the ligrht of these facts, I hope that the belief that the weight
of company tax has ruined companies and retarded economic progress,
will uow be scotched for all time. Companies% have, along with other
sections of the community, received the benefit of the Government's
policy of full employment, resulting in an expansion of all forms of
economic activity.
" That my Government is alive to the-important influence which
companies have on the economic life of the community is evidenced by
the fact that since the end of the war, the taxation of both private
Creceiavnde ndon -private companies has been reduced. Private companies have
the benefit of the greatly reduced rates of tax payable by
individuals in their Division 7 assessments. Non-private companies9
are no longer subject to War-time ( Company) Tax, a fact which should
prove of great benefit to newly established and expanding businesses."~
On 23rd February, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
There has been some criticism of my recent statement on company
taxation. Most of the comment is extraneous to the main issue, being
directed at the weight of all taxation, the level of Government expenditure
and the extent of Governmental control. A statement on the
incidence of company taxation is not the appropriate place to deal with
such comment which will be replied to at the appropriate time and
place. " Other critics appear to have overlooked the fact that the statement
dealt only with the incidence of income tax on companies. at
has been argued, for instance, that because a rebate of company tax
isq not now allowed to shareholders on dividends;, companies are paying
more tax than pre-war. These critics appear to have found it necessary
to bolster their case by taking into account the tax paid by individuals-
a factor which is not relevant to the issue.
Another critic has pointed out that net company income ( that
is, after payment of taxes) as a percentage of national income has
declined from 9.1 per cent. in 1938-39 to 6.8 per cent, in 1946-47.
This comparison of percentages merely tends to obscure the real issue.
The fact that must constantly he borne in mind is that the actual level
of net company income, after payment of tax, has increased from
Å“ 73,000,000 in 1938-39 to Å“ 87,000,000 in 1946-47-an increase of
Å“ 14,000,000 or nearly 20 per cent.
Some of the criticism, however, calls for some reply. For instance,
it has been stated that companies are now unable to, pursue a policy
of development and expansion because undistributed profitb available
to companies in 1946-47 were only Å“ 5,000,000 higher at Å“ 39,000,000
than they were in 1938-39. It is claimed that this increase is inadequate
to meet present day costs of acquiring equipment and plant. 
" In my opinion, the criticism overlooks certain important factors.
In the first place, undistributed profits are not the only source of
funds for development and expansion of companies. Secondly, the
undistributed profits available to companies during the war years never
fell below the 1938-39 level and actually rose as high as Å“ 42,000,000.
The Government has shown companies sympathetic consideration in
allowing them to retain these undistributed profits during the war.
It is certain that individual taxpayers did not have the same opportunity
of building up similar reserves during the period when individual
rates of tax were at their peak.
The total of undistributed profits accruing to companies during
and immediately after the war, amounted to some Å“ 180,000,000.
Shortages of man-power and materials have, up to the present, largely
precluded expenditure of these reserves on replacement or development
work. A reasonably large proportion of this accumulation should
now be available for this purpose.
Obsolete and outworn plant, and the like, are normally replaced
by means of a depreciation reserve which is built up over the life of
the plaiw. Thus a considerable proportion of the capital necessary
to replace existing plant and equipment should already be in the hand
of companies. In addition, they rould have recourse to their accumulated
undistributed profits.
" Further, the purchase of new, and replacement of obsolete plant
and equipment is encouraged by special depreciation provisions in the
Income Tax A. ssessment Act. These provide an initial depreciation
allowance of 20 per cent. ( in addition to normal depreciation) on
all depreciable assets acquired during the five years ended 30th June,
1950. The combined effect of all these factors is largely if not completely
to offset the higher cost of new machinery and equipment.
It has also been suggested that the average rates of tax payable
by companies, as calculated in my original statement, over the war
yei: rs are misleading, because some companies paid more and some less
tlian the average rate. This is inherent in all averages, but the average
rate of 7s. 6d. in the Å“ 1 paid by companies does indicate that the great
proportion of companies paid either this rate or less on the whole of
their taxable income.
None of the critics has been able to refute the facts contained in
my statement or to deny that as compared with other sections of the
community ( and with other countries), companies have received fair
treatment from the taxation viewpoint."
BRITISH COMMONWEALTH.
PROPOSED CONFERENCE.
On 13th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Nothing can be gained by holding a British Commonwealth Conference
at the moment. I cannot say what the future holds, as something
is taking place all the time. We understand the position on
finance and on the question of a production drive. First of all. production
is aimed at providing food for Britain. The more we enrouraqe 
increased production the closer we are to the solution of all difficulties.
The fundamental thing is to get the best possible production to solve
the dollar crisis, our own shortages and the need for food. But at the
moment, on the informaticn available to us, there is nothing to be
gained by a special conference. What the future holds will be determined
in the light of circumstances.".
VISIT OF KING AND QUEEN TO AUSTRALIAANNOUNCEMENT.
On 6th March, 1948, Mr. Chifley broadcast over the national network.
Mr. Chifley said-
Men and women of Australia,
It is my most happy duty and privilege to make an announcement
to the people of Australia.
" His Majesty the King has commanded His Excellency the
r Governor-General to authorize me to make public the following bulletin
which His Excellency has received from Buckingham Palace, London-
In response to a suggestion made by his Prime Ministers in New Zealand
and Australia, the King has graciously consented to visit these countries in the
early part of 1949. His Majesty will be accompanied by the Queen and the
Princess Margaret.
" I know that the knowledge that Their Majesties and the Princess
Margaret will, at a comparatively early date, visit us will give the
greatest satisfaction to all Australians and I have asked the Governor-
General to express our gratitude to His Majesty. All will look forwar]
eagerly to the opportunity of showing here in Australia the feelings
of pride and affection we have for the Royal Family.
The Government of the Commonwealth will gladly join with the
Governments of the States and with public and private bodies in
ensuring that a fitting welcome be given to our Royal guests.'".
On 9th March, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
" The Minister for Munitions ( Senator Armstrong) will he
Minister-in-charge of the Royal Visit to Australia in 1949."
The General Officer Commanding, Eastern Command ( Lieutenant-
General F. H. Berryman), will be Director of the Royal Visit to Australia
in 1949."

On 24th May, 1948, the Postmaster-General ( Senator Cameron)
announced that special postage stamps would be issued in Australia to
mark the visit of the King and Queen and Princess Margaret.
CONVERSION LOAN.
LONDON OPERATION, JANUARY, 1948, SUCCESS.
On 13th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" The loan for Å“ 12,870,300, issued at London to convert the New
South Wales 5{ per cent. loan, has closed with applications amounting
to Å“ 10,420,300. This leaves Å“ 2,450,000 to be taken up by the underwriters. 
22
" This result is regarded as satisfactory in view of the adverse
factors which affected the market after the lists were opened. Since
the loan closed the securities have been quoted at a premium."
OLYMPIC GAMES.
On 16th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said
" Cabinet to-day decided to make a grant of Å“ 4,000 towards the

DEFENCE.
POST-WAR-SERVICE EXPENDITURE.
On 16th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" The Board of Business Administration ceased to, function on
December 31, 1947, with the expiry of Defence ( Transitional) Act
Regulations. The board, which. operated with the Defence Division of
the Treasury, was responsible for the review of proposals by Service
Departments for works and supplies, for inspections and investigations
of financial and accounting matters and for co-ordination of matters
from a joint-services aspect.
" In November, 1947, Cabinet approved a procedure for review and
approval of works proposals, involving a review by a sub-committee of
Cabinet, assisted by an inter-departmental committee.
" With regard to matters other than works and to maintain the
established principle of review with modifications suitable to existing
circumstances. I arranged for discussions between the Treasury and
the Departments of Defence, Navy, Army and Air. 
23
Cabinet decided to-day that the following review authorities be
set up:-
A Cabinet sub-connmittee. comprising the three service Ministers and
myself, and the Minister for Defence when necessary.
A Treasury Defence Review Committee comprising a Treasury representative
as chairman and the permanent head of each service department.
Matters to be referred for review will be-
Programme and st teiuits of requirements for annual Estimates purposes
under the defence plan and in respect of war commitments.
Any variations from the above required to be implemented during the year
in anticipation of next year's Estimates. ( This will include increases in numbers
of personnel as irovided for respective ranks in annual Estimates.)
Variations in the approved bases of provisioning; or the authorized equipment
tables. Any proposition not covered by the foregoing involving the purs,
chase of plant, equipment, motor transport, spare parts and supplies where the
expenditure involved would exceed Å“ 5.000.
r Questions involvinl variations in standards of issue of clothing and rations
and in standards of furniture, office equipment and departmental services
generally. Pay and conditions of service of members of the forces.
Any other expenditure proposals having a joint-service aspect.
Systems in relation to financial and store accounts.
HEALTH.
RADIOLOGY.
On 16th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said--
Cabinet to-day approved, on the recommendation of the Minister
for Health ( Senator McKenna), of the establishment of a physical
service in radiology at Perth. to be a branch of the Commonwealth
X-ray and Radium Laboratory at Melbourne. The new project will
serve a useful purpose in standardizing diagnostic and therapeutic
x-ray equipment; the working conditions of persons engaged in x-ray
occupations, radium and other electro-medical equipment; and in the
distribution of radon. RESEARCH GRANT.
On 19th March, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
The Government has agreed to contribute, through the National
Health and Medical Research Council, Å“ 20,000 towards the cost of
biophysical equipment to be installed at Melbourne at the Walter and
Eliza Hall Institute of Research in Pathology and Medicine. This
amount is in addition to the annual grant made to the institute by the
council from funds provided by the Commonwealth Government, and
amounting in the current year to Å“ 15,000.
This Commonwealth contribution will allow of adequate physicochemical
studies of viruses, enzymes and proteins, by the use of the
most modern analytical ultra-centrifuge and electrophoresis apparatus 
AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING COMMISSION.
REVENUE FROM LICENCES.
On 16th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" Cabinet decided to-day to approve expenditure by the Australian
Broadcasting Commission, during the three months ending 30th June.
1948, of an amount not exceeding one-quarter of the Commission's
estimated expenditure of Å“. 1,304,500 for 1947-48; namely, Å“ 326,125
On the 16th March, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
Cabinet to-day decided that the Australian Broadcasting Commission
lie authorized to expend during the present financial year, in addition
to Å“ 1,304,000 already approved, an amount not exceeding Å“ 20,000
to enable the commission to mreet additional costs involved in the application
by the Public Service Arbitrator of marginal increases to the
staff of the com~ mission".'

INQUIRY-REPORT.
Onl 16th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chitley) said-
" Cabinet to-day received the report of a committee, comprising
Messrs. A. A. Fitzgerald, chairman, E. G. Bonney and W. T. Harris,
who were appointed to consider the administration and financial
organization of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and to report
whether the powers, functions and obligations of the commission, as
prescribed in the Australian Broadcasting Act, are being discharged
with maximum efficiency, adequate control and due economy of expenditure
and whether any changes are desirable.
" Cabinet decided that the report be referred to the Cabinet subcommittee
on Broadcasting, comprising the Minister for Supply ( Senator
Ashley), the Postmaster-General ( Senator Cameron) and the
Minister for Information ( Mr. Calwell). The Cabinet sub-committee
will report further to Cabinet.
The committee has formed the opinion that generally the present
administration, control and organization of the commission is satisfactory;
that the financial and accounting procedures are well-designed
and effectively carried out; and that although some economies could be
effected, it would not be practicable for the commission to be financially
self-supporting unless revenue is substantially increased or activities
substantially curtailed SOCIAL SECURITY.
TUBERCULOSIS-CABINET DECISION.
On 16th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" Cabinet to-day considered recommendations for a plan to wage
war on tuberculosis, designed to reduce tuberculosis to a problem of
min-or importance within twenty years. Apart from its toll in human
misery and distress, tuberculosis involves vast economic loss to the
nation through loss of mnan-power hours in industry, lowering of the 
birth rate and the expenditure of millions of pounds on treatment, convalescence
and social benefits. The disease demands national concern
both because its incidence fails very heavily on young adults in their
most productive and reproductive years but also because, being
infectious, it is a source of real danger to every person in the community.
If detected early it can usually be arrested and the patient
returned to useful citizenship.
he Federal Health Council, the National Health and Medical
Research Council and medical bodies have been advocating for many
years a vigorous attack on tuberculosis under Commonwealth leadership
and with adequate Commonwealth financial backing. The power conferred
on the Commonwealth Parliament at the last referendum to provide
medical services has opened the way to Commonwealth entry into
the field as well as imposing a high responsibility on the Commonwealth.
Principles and methods to be applied to the control of tuberculosis are
well established and have been effectively applied in other parts of the
world-notably in Scandanavian countries, Canada ( particularly
Ontario and Saskatchewan) and in most of the United States.
The recently appointed Commonwealth Director of Tuberculosis
H. W. Wunderly) has completed a survey of the facilities and
needs in each State in relation to this disease which, it is estimated,
atiects from 30,000 to 40,000 persons.
Cabinet authorized the Minister for Health ( Senator McKenna)
to draft legislation to effect necessary amendments to the Tuberculosis
Act. Senator McKenna stressed that no housing problem was of greater
urgency than that of housing in isolation in suitably equipped buildings
sufferers who: as well as needing to be saved from the disease, are a
nenace to the health and lives of their fellows unless precautionary
measures are strictly observed.
The co-operation of the . States will be sought in making a uniform
approach to the problem. Subject to agreement between the States and
the Commonwealth as to a general plan of campaign evolved in consultation,
the Commonwealth will provide the necessary money for new
buildings and equipment and will be prepared to provide a substantial
proportion of maintenance involved.
Dr. Wunderly's report will be circulated to the States as a basis
for discussion and Dr. Wunderly will argair visit all States in the near
future. A very brief summary of Dr. Wunderly's report shows that an
important element in an attack on tuberculosis is the education of the
, public to prevent the spread of the disease. In this, the Government
invites the co-operation of the press, the radio, the newsreels and
voluntary bodies who, with limited finances and facilities, have done
splendid work in combating the disease and making the public conscious
of tuhbrculosis. I am confident that this co-operation will be forthcoming.
The full co-operation of medical schools, teaching hospitals
and o. ther institutions is also desired. It is estimated that the Commonwalrh
will, from an early sage of the campaign, be involved in consi!
crable expendcture. Thli will in in addition to the amounts now being 
expended annually by State governments. The Government is anxious
that there should be an immediate, vigorous and efficient approach to
the treatment, prevention and control of tuberculosis in this country".

PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED PERSONS.
On 16th February, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
In 1945, Cabinet approved the development of an interim scheme
of rehabilitation under the Re-establishment and Employment Act to
cover ex-servicemen not eligible for medical benefits under the
Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act and directed that a committee,
representative of the Treasury, the Department of Post-war Reconstruction
and the Department of Social Services should prepare a report on a
permanent scheme for the general community.
" Cabinet to-day approved the committee's recommendations as
follows:-Establishment of a rehabilitation scheme for the general community, providing
medical treatment and vocational training.
Persons from certain groups at present to be brought into the schemedisabled
ex-members of the forces covered by Part IV. of the Re-establishment and
Employment Act as at time of the commencement of the general scheme for the
rehabilitation of disabled persons; invalid pensioners or claimants for the invalid
pension; those receivinl or claiming unemployment or sickness benefits who may
become unemployed unl ss rehabilitation assistance is given.
A report to be presented within twelve months on the practicability and
desirability of including adolescents.
Adoption of the plrinciple of inclusion ultimately of recognized industrial
diseases groups within the scheme.
Eligibility to be restricted to cases drawn from the groups set out above
where the disability has already lasted thirteen weeks at the time of application,
appears likely to last at least a further thirteen weeks ( making 26 weeks
in all) and to he a substantial handicap to the person in securing suitable
employment; yet is remediable and allows of reasonable prospects of employ.
ability within two years.
During medical treatment, the pensioner should continue to receive his social
services benefit and also the actual cost of fares where he is required to travel
for treatment. The fares paid are not to be regarded as ' income' under the
Social Services Consolidation Act.
During vocational training, the trainee should receive a benefit at the rate
of, and subject to, a means test similar to that for invalid pensions, plus a
training allowance of 20s. a week, the actual cost of fares where he is required
to travel regularly for training, and a living away from home allowance as
outlined above.
Medical examination to determine eligibility to be free. Cost of medical
treatment to be borne by the Commonwealth only to the extent to which the
patient is unable to meet he expense. Medical appliances, and also books and
tools of trade supplied on the successful completion of training, to be a charge
to the patient on a basis to be fixed by the Department of Social Services and
the Treasury.
A bill to be prepared for submission to the Federal Parliamentary Labour
party. Pending the passing of legislation, the Government authorize the commencement
of the scheme as outlined to operate from 1st January, 1948, to permit of
continuity of the treatment and training of ex-service personnel accepted under
Part IV. of the Re-establishment and Employment Act as at 31st December,
1947 
27
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT-QUEENSLAND.
On 25th February, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
In connexion with the payment of unemployment benefit to persons
involved in or affected by the present Queensland industrial dispute,
the Social Services Consolidation Act provides that benefit is not
payable to an applicant whose unemployment is due to him being a
direct participant in a strike.
In relation to other persons involved in or affected by an industrial
dispute, the Minister for Social Services has issued instructions which
are being observed by the Department of Social Services in Queensland
at present and throughout the Commonwealth. These instructions are
the outcome of a full consideration of the relevant parts of the Act of a
Cabinet sub-committee early in 1947. In brief, the instructions embody
the following principles:--
In respect of unions on strike and unions sponsoring a strike of its members in
key positions, member'. of these unions, whether directly participating in the
strike, or unemployed as a direct or indirect consequence of the strike, are not to
be regarded as eligible to receive unemployment benefit.
In respect of union not on strike. or apparently having no members on strike,
members of these unions are to he regarded as eligible to receive unemployment
benefit. A ersoin i-nit to be disquiialificd for iiieminployinmet benefit by reason only
of his refusal to undertake work available through a strike or lockout.
Persons eligible under these principles for benefit will, of course,
have to satisfy the other eligibility provisions in the Act
EXTERNAL AFFAIRS.
OVERSEAS REPRESENTATION.
On 16th February, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.
Evatt) said-
The Government is taking steps to raise the status of the Australian
missions in Russia, France and China. The fact that these three countries
have seen fit to accord the increased status to Australia is tangible
recognition of the increased role which Australia has come to play
in international affairs in recent years.
The status of the Australian mission in the United States was
raised from that of Minister to Ambassador in June, 1946, and this last
action, covering the remaining permanent members of the Security
Council, is in accordance with a decision taken in principle by the
Government at that time.
" The change, while not increasing either the size of staffs or
financial commitments, is largely to indicate the importance which each
country attaches to the other with which it has diplomatic relations,
and it is related to the seniority of the particular representative and
the facilities to be made available to him in the country to wnich he is
accredited ii

PARLIAMENT.
INCREASED MEMBERSHIP.
On 17th February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said--
The Federal Parliamentary Labour party to-day approved of legislation
to increase the number of senators from each State by four with
a corresponding increase, as provided in the Constitution, in the membership
of the House of Representatives.
The Federal Parliamentary Labour party approved of the principle
of the proportional representation system of voting being applied
to the Senate MUNITIONS PRODUCTION.
UTILIZATION OF PLANT-FURTHER SALES.
On 21st February, 1948, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction
( Mr. Dedman) announced the following decisions:-
Munitions annexe at Lane Cove sold to Robert Corbett
Pty. Ltd., for the manufacture of chemicals.
Commonwealth annexe at Lidcombe leased to Australian
Forge and Engineering Pty. Ltd., of Lidcombe, for the manufacture
of forged axles and automotive spare parts.
Munitions factory at Tamworth sold to Amalgamated
Wireless ( A/ asia.) Ltd.
Munitions factory at St. Marys leases to Aldaco

Hill; Howletts Industries Pty. Ltd.; H. S. Kirkwood; K. H. Freeman;
Druco Tool and Engineering Co. Pty. Ltd.; J. Thurling.
JAPAN.
TRADE-PRIVATE TRADING.
On 22nd February, 1948, the Prime Minister) said-
Arrangements have now been completed with the Supreme Command
of the Allied Powers in Japan to permit the early resumption
of two-way trade on a limited scale between Australia and Japan
within the general framework of the Interim Sterling Payments Agreement
recently negotiated with Supreme Command Allied Powers by the
British authorities.
" The agreement provides for all private trade between Japan and
the sterling area ( excluding Hong Kong) to be financed in sterling
through special sterling accounts established in the name of Supreme
Command Allied Powers with British banks. The agreement to which
Australia is a party was concluded in November, 1947, but the necessary
banking arrangements have only recently been completed.
" One of the clauses of the agreement provides that unused balances
held in Supreme Command Allied Power's sterling accounts may be
innverted into dollars at six monthly intervals. Because of this clause 
29
it has been necessary to treat Japan as virtually a ' dollar' country
for import licensing purposes and up to the present no licences have
been granted for the private importation of Japanese goods.
" Arrangements have now been made with Supreme Command
Allied Powers which will, to some extent, overcome the difficulties
created by the convertibility ejause and will permit two-way trade to
be revived on a limited scale. The basis of the arrangement is that
the Commonwealth Government will authorize the issue of licences
for the importation by private traders of certain essential goods from
Japan thus providing Supreme Command Allied Powers with funds for
the purchase of Australian wool and other products.
Stocks of wool in Japan are very low and exports of Australian
wool to Japan since the cessation of hostilities have been limited to a
single shipment of about 7,500 bales. Further purchases have not been
possible because Japan has not been able to finance them. As payment
is miade for Australian imports of Japanese goods under the arrangenient
now concluded Supreme Command Allied Powers will be in a
position to resume purchases of Australian wool through agents at the
auctions. An undertaking, has been g-iveni ly Supreme Command Allied
1Powers that the whole of the proceeds of permitted imports into Australia
from Japan will be used for the purchase of Australian wool and
other prodlucts and no question of conversion of marginal amounts into
dollars will therefore arise.
Cotton textiles and cotton yarn are excluded from the arrangement
because they are at present available only against dollar payments but
impiort lienfes will be granted for Japanese raw silk, rayon yarn,
milling silk and certain essential utility types of rayon textiles."
( ror earlier references, please see No. 128, page 24; No. 132, page 3.)
On 24th February, 1948, the Minister for Customs ( Senator
(' nurtice) said that since the cessation of hostilities, cotton textiles,
rayon yarn and raw silk had been purchased by the Commonwealth
Government from Japan, but it was not expected that further Government
cash purchases would be undertaken. Licences will be issued for
raw silk and rayon yarn direct to users, while licences for milling silk
would be issued to importers who had been obtaining their requirements
from other sources. Licences would be granted for suitable types of
porcelain insulators and. it was intended to restrict the issue of those
licences to electric light and power undertakings. Regarding cotton
piece goods, the occupation authorities still required dollars in payment
and import licences would not be issued.
INCOME TAX.
BOARD OF REVIEW.
On 23rd February, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Mr. G. J. J. O'Sullivan has been appointed a member of the
Taxation Board of Review at Sydney for seven years as from 1st
March, 19MS.'" 
REPARATIONS.
' GERMANY-SCIENTIFIC PERSONNEL.
On 24th February, 1948, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction
( Mr. Dedman) announced that arrangements has been made for the
admission of more German scientists to Australia to assist in research
and production problems associated with industrial development.
Before allotment to specific tasks, the Government would make the
experts available to industrialists for general consultation. They
included-Dr. R. Hoffnan. who specialized in the treatment of metal surfaces
especially for the electrical industry ( including the preparation of surfaces
anti-ccrrosive alluys, anodising electro-plating and sherardising) and the
technical application of electro-osmosis.
Dr. F. O. Weinert, who would advise on processes concerning the extracting
of salts from German potash deposits, new compounds for seed treatment, dyestuffs
and intermediates, tlerinclhemistry of iron from ores, magnesium and
production of intermediates.
Dr. J. Unterzaucher, a micro-analyst.
Dr. H. Ritter and a technical assistant, who were experts in the designing
and manufacturing of scientific instruments relating to nmasurement technique,
including those for geodetic, astronomic, optic and inter-ferometric purposes.
On 13th March, 1948, Mr. Dedman announced that arrangements
had been made for the admission of more German scientists to Australia
during March, 1948. They were-
Dr. A. Gross, chemist, qualified in research and manufacture of artificial
resins; Dr. T. Feuerriegel, expert on optical and similar instruments; Messrs.
H. Hock, specialist in design and production of machine tools; T. Schobel,
leading designer of electric meters, test equipment, motors; A. Seyler, expert
in radio, television, and telecommunications; Fieguth, leading engineer in
electro-technical and high frequency engineering.

RECONSTRUCTION.
WORLD ORGANIZATION-TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENT.
In Parliamen.-On 26th February, 1948, the Minister for Postwar
Reconstruction ( Mr. Dedman) said-
I lay on the table the following paper:-
United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment-Memorandum
showing alteration of Tariff duties,
in substitution for the paper tabled on 18th November, 1947, by the
Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. This document, while including
all the information contained in the previous document, gives additional
information and should be of greater assistance to the House
when studying the tariff alterations resulting from the International
Conference on Trade and Employment."
( For earlier references, please see No. 132, page 3.)
In Parliament.-On 26th February, 1948, the Prime Minister
( Mr. Chifley) said-
The great struggle which democracy is having to-day to combat
the inroads of communism is due to the fact that the conservative
interests of the world have fertilized the soil in which communism has 
grown over the centuries. The Labour party is just as concerned about
production as is any other party. It is actuated not so much by
political motives as by a desire to satisfy the need of the great mass
of the people of Australia for essential goods and to make the utmost
possible contribution to the welfare of other peoples of the world, many
of whom are starving. That is not a political creed; it is a humanitarian
creed.
" One has to cast one's mind back over events of recent years to
realize the source from which the Geneva trade agreement and other
matters have sprung. I recall the state of affairs in 1941-42, when the
people of Britain were standing -almost alone. Some method had to be
devised to secure help from the United States, and I think the idea
developed in the mind of President Roosevelt ' himself. It had to be
something which, to use the vernacular, he knew he would be able to
sell to the American people. Out of this idea grew at various times the
Atlantic Charter, the Mutual Aid Agreement, and the Lend-Lease
Agreement. I. am able to realize the very difficult position in which
Britain was situated and in which Mr. Churchill, the then British
leader, found himself in fighting for the preservation of his country.
Unless Britain and the Dominions had been able to obtain large quantities
of arms and goods from the United States and to take advantage
of the great industrial, financial, and man-power resources of that
country, it is very doubtful whether we could have won the war.
Civilization itself might have been destroyed. The Atlantic Charter,
the Mutual Aid Agreement, the Lend-Lease Agreement and Article
VII. of the trade charter, all arose in the first place from discussions
between President Roosevelt, one of the great men of history, and Mr.
-Churchill. " I do not believe that Mr. -Churchill was ever anxious to have
included in Article VII. any proposals for revision of tariffs.. He
knew that the United States had always looked with strong disfavour
on Imperial preferences, and he knew also that Canada had never been
keen on -contractual Imperial preference obligations. I think I may
thus interpret the utterances of the Prime Minister of Canada, who
has been the leader of that country for a l-ong time, without committing
a political libel. I do not say that he did not believe in some sort of
preference, but it is evident that he has never been enthusiastic about
being bound by contractual obligations.
" President Roosevelt had great political problems in his own
country at that time. For a long time, the policy of a great majority
of the people of the U nited States had been to, ' keep out of Europe
not to engage in any conflict on that continent, either militarily or
otherwise. Therefore, President Roosevelt had to offer to his people
something in return for what was one of the most generous gestures
in history-the provisions of the Lend-tease Agreement and the Mutual
Aid Agreement. On the other side of the bargain, we had a great
leader in Mr. Churchill, who realized the desperate straits of his
country. Re knew that Britain had been selling its foreign securities
to obtain credits, and that this reserve was becoming rapidly depleted. 
32
Indeed, Britain had to make its purchases abroad on a cash-and-carry
basis. Mr. Churchill knew that if this situation continued there could.
be only one end-that Britain could not carry on the war. It was very
doubtful at that time whether 60 per cent. of the American people were
in favour of participation in a European conflict. Confronted with
these tremendous problems, Mr. Churchill and Mr. Roosevelt agreed to
insert into the Lend-Lease Agreement the conditions contained in
Article VII. which provided that consideration was to be given after the
war to a general reduction of tariff barriers. No doubt Mr. Churchill.
agreed to that provision reluctantly. At that time Australia was in a
most desperate position, and it had no alternative but to join in the
undertaking given to the United States by Britain. At that time
Britain could not help us because physically it was incapable of doing
so, and it was only because of the volume of aid supplied by the United
States in the form of personnel, aircraft, equipment and services that
Australia was not invaded.
" In the circumstances prevailing at the time the action taken by the
Australian Government was completely justified. Of course, if the
matter had been left to us, we should not have initiated a conference
to discuss the reduction of world tariff barriers, but, as I said
previously, we were bound by a contractual obligation. Moreover,
other factors entered into the matter. Britain desperately needed a
reduction of world trade barriers if its economy were to survive in the
aftermath of war. The Australian Government realized fully the
position of Britain, and because of that, and because of our. contractual
obligation-or, should I say, moral obligation-we agreed to the provisions
of Article VII. of the Lend-Lease Agreement. In any event, the
point of view of some of the other Dominions were opposed to ours.
Canada, for example, was most anxious that a conference to discuss
Empire trade preference should be convened. At that time, responsiblepeople
in Britain, irrespective of their political beliefs, did not believe
that Britain could survive economically after the war unless it could
export more goods into dollar areas; tariff barriers would have to be
lowered to enable it to export to countries outside the Empire so as to
compensate for the loss of its investments. It must be realized that
during the war Britain lost a large number of its overseas investments,
and was importing 50 per cent. of its imports from ' hard' currency,
or dollar, areas. Furthermore, I think that members of the British
Government believe that unless Britain received something similar
to the American loan, which was later granted to it, it would not be
possible to maintain even the lowered standard of living endured by
its people during the war. At that time, it was idle to speculate on
what Canada or South Africa might do after the war; the plain
fact was that unless Britain was to receive a loan such as that made to,
it later, its position would be unthinkable. The terms of the American
loan were not ungenerous. Certainly, they contained provisions with
regard to ' non-discrimination', but it must be remembered that the
President, the Government of the United States and particularly the
.1:
' K1 
33
Department of State, had to ' sell the Anglo-American loan to the
American Congress. That loan had also to be approved by the United
States Senate; approval which could not easily be obtained.
" Had that legislation not been passed, I dread to think of the
position in which Britain would be placed to-day, more so when one
remembers the tremendous task of rehabilitation wvhich confronts that
country, and, indeed, the whole of Europe. I go further, and without
wishing to arouse any panic or unnecessary anxiety, I say that if the
legislation to implement the Marshall aid plans' is not enacted the
economic position of Britain will be most difficult before the end of the
present year.
" Australia participated in the International Conference on Trade
and Employment for three main reasons. In the first place, we were
morally obliged to do so because of Article VII. of the Lend-Lease Agreement,
* and in any event, we wanted the benefit of the favorable provisions
of that article. Secondly, the British Government was convinced
that an agreement, such as was eventually reached at the
conference, was absolutely essential to its economic existence, and
finally we had our own privileges to preserve.
I pay tribute to the members of the delegation which represented
Australia at that conference. I am convinced that our representatives
accomplished something really worth while, something at least comparable
with the achievement of the British delegation. It was no easy
task to assist the United States Government to convince its people
that it was justified in doing things for other countries. Australia
has suffered no, real loss as a result of the agreements or the tariff
schedules that will be discussed later. It has played its part in world
affairs and has contributed to the assistance of Britain.
The fact of the matter is that American production to-d-ay is
enormous; it amounts, I understand, to 55 per cent. of the total
secondary production of the world. Because the United States sold
three times as much as it bought, the dollars with which to purchase
the goods it produces are not possessed by other countries. We may
talk of our personal problems, hut it should be realized that the future
welfare' of the masses of the people of this and other countries is to
a large extent wrapped up in the solution of this world economic
problem. Australia can play -only a small part; it can only show
complete willingness to do all it can do to help. It is -all very well
to scoff at theorists and idealists, but many ideas of great benefit to
the world were conceived by people with ideal.
The fact that there seems to be an almost insurmountable barrier
to overcome is no reason why those who lead nations should not attempt
to surmount it. I realize the present situation of Britain probably
as well as any one in Australia, and I know the extent of the economic
i[: ssistance that is needed from * thE. United States. I have an appreciation
of the great difficulties confronting those who govern the rnited
Sotates, which is a country in which there are many conflicting interests
and many pressure groups. Human nature being what it is, there is 
f
i 34
much difficulty in obtaining approval to measures such as the Anglo-
American loan agreement and the Marshall plan. In this world one
cannot take all and give nothing. We have not given very much
materially, although we have contributed a great deal through the
industry and ability of our representatives at international
conferences." NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.
VICE-CHANCELLOR.
On 2nd March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Cabinet to-day approved of the recommendation of the Interim
Council of the Australian National University that the Australian
Minister to China ( Professor D. B. Copland) be appointed Vice-Chancellor
for a period of five years. The appointment is considered
urgent as Sir Howard Florey, Professor M. Oliphant, Professor W. K.
Hancock and Professor R. Firth, who, it is hoped, will be the directors
of the John Curtin School of Medical Research and of the Research
Schools of Physics, Social Sciences and Pacific Studies respectively,
will be in Australia in March, 1948, to confer with the Interim
Council and the Vice-Chancellor with respect to the establishment of
the Research Schools." WHEAT POOLS PAYMENTS.
No. 10 POOL-FOURTH ADVANCE.
On 2nd March, 1948, the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr. Pollard)
announced that a fourth advance of Is. a bushel on bulk wheat and
Is. 3d. a bag on bagged had been approved on 1946-47 crop wheat
in No. 10 Pool. The advance brought the payments in the pool to
7s. 7d. a bushel less freight for bulk wheat and 8s. Id. a bushel less
freight for bagged wheat. SHIPBUILDING.
DIESEL ENGINES.
On 2nd March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" The Commonwealth Government marine engine works at Port
Melbourne ( Victoria) and Brisbane ( Queensland) were set up during
the war under the Australian Shipbuilding Board for the construction
of marine steam engines. Recently the Minister for Munitions
(. Senator Armstrong) approved of the two works being placed under
the General Manager of the Government Ordnance Factories so that
they might have access to a wider range of manufactures, including
the construction of diesel engines.
Cabinet to-day approved of the Department of Munitions, in
consultation with the Australian . Shipbuilding Board, undertaking
immediately the construction of six 3,000 horse-power marine diesel
engines, of which two are required in 1949 and the remainder at
intervals as may be required by the Board. A sum of Å“ 750,000 will
be allocated for the purpose. The Munitions Department will open 
negotiations for the purchase of manufacturing information and use
of the patents of William Doxford and Sons Limited, of Sunderland,
England. The Munitions Department, in conjunction with the Board, will
arrange for the manufacture of standardized auxiliary machinery at a
value of Å“ 250,000. Auxiliary machinery includes small power plants
for lighting and ventilating, winches and hoists, steering gear, pumps
and the like." AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES.
AWARDS FOR GALLANTRY.
On 5th March, 1948, the Governor-General announced the following
awards:-Associate of the Royal Red Gross-Lieutenants K. 1. A. Parker
and M. J. Anderson.
INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT.
On 7th March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" For some weeks past, a special meeting of the International
Wheat Council has been engaged at Washington in the negotiation of
an International Wheat Agreement and advice has now been received
from the Australian representative that agreement has jbeen reached
among the partic ipating countries for submission to governments. The
main proposals of the agreement are-
" The agreement will he for five years commencing from 1st August,
1948. The range of prices will he from a maximum of two dollars a
bushel to a minimum of one dollar ten cent in ' the fifth year of the
agreement. The minimum in the first year will he one dollar fifty
cents, the second year one dollar forty cents, the third year one dollar
thirty cents, and the fourth year one dollar twenty cents. All prices are
on the basis of in store Fort William, Canada.
" Sales will be made between the maximum of two dollars, which
will operate for the whole of the agreement, and the minimumn applying
to each particular year. The Australian equivalents will vary
according to freight rates and whether sales from Australia are made
to nearby or distant markets.
" Under present conditions it is estimated that the Australian
equivalents are: maximum lie. 6d. to 12s. a bushel and minimum
from 6s. to 6s. 6d. a bushel in the last year of the agreement.
" The total quantities covered in the agreement are 500,000,000
bushels per annum, of which Australia's share will be 85,000,000
bushels annually; the other participating exporters being Canada and
the United States with shares of 230,000,00% and 185,000,000 bushels
respectively. Importing countries represented at the conference
numbered 33 and included Britain, India, France, Belgium, the
Netherlands and China. 
36
Any wheat which exporters can make available above their share
Sof the 500,000,000 bushels can be sold outside the agreement at any
price which they can obtain on the market.
" The proposals will be placed before the Commonwealth Government
for approval at a very early date, as my information is to the
effect that several of the major importing countries, including Britain,
have already intimated that their governments have agreed and will sign
j the agreement immediately, while other delegates have recommended
acceptance of the agreement to their governments.
When it comes into operation the agreement will assure stability
to wheat-growers for five years ahead."
On 16th March, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
Cabinet decided to-day that the Australian Ambassador at
Washington be ' authorized to notify approval of the International
Wheat Agreement, subject to ratification by the Commonwealth Government."
CIVIL AVIATION.
AELO-A'UTICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL.
On 9th March, 194S, the Minister in charge of Scientific and Industrial
Research ( Mr. Dedman) announced that an Aeronautical
Research Conference, attended by representatives of the British Commonwealth,
would be held in Australia in April, 1948. The conference
would be the first formal meeting of the British Commonwealth
Advisory Aeronautical Research Council which was set up by Britain
and the various Dominion Governments following a meeting of aeronautical
research workers at London in 1946. The council would
co-ordinate research programmes throughout the British Commonwealth
and plan collaborative programmes. It would act as a central
liaison agency for the dissemination of scientific information on aeronautics,
and the interchange and secondment of scientific staff. The
Professor of Aeronautical Engineering at Sydney University ( Professor
A. V. Stephens) would be chairman of the conference. The
Australian delegates would be-
The Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance of the R. A. A. F. ( Air
Vice-Marshal E. C. Wackett), 3Mr. MI. B. Wnodlfill, of thie Division of Aircraft
Production, the Chief of thie Division of Aero mautics of the Comncil for Scientific
and Industrial Research ( Mr. L. IP. Coombesi.
AERO CLUBS.
On 16th March, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
In November, 1945, Cabinet approved assistance to aero clubs
b. ubject to review after twelve months' operations.
Cabinet to-day approved of recommendations for assistance for a
period of four years and five months from February 1, 1947, to June
1951, on terms and conditions to be determined by Mr. Drakeford
and to be based generally on conditions originally -approved by
Cabinet.".
i. 
37
On 23rd March, 1948, the Minister for Civil Aviation ( Mr.
Drakeford) announced details of increased subsidies to aero clubs.
The scheme would operate from February, 1947, to June, 1951, and
would cost Å“ 40,000 a year. It was designed to subsidize clubs at a rate
of Å“ 1 14s. 6d. for every hour flown. That would be achieved as
follows MlAINT1ENAZNcE GRAN-.-Increase from los. to Å“ 1 anll our for each hour flown.
Previous limit of 200 hours an aircraft was removed, but there would be safeguards
to prevent individual club members from enjoying unlimited pleasure
flying at government expense. For flying away from home base, clubs would
receive 30s. an hour South Australian and Tasmanian clubs would receive
an hour for all flying until 30th June, 1948.
Issua BoNus.-For each new pupil trained to " All licence standard, the
bonus would he increased from Å“ 50 to For pupils trained in country
centres ( away from base) thre bonus would be raised from Å“ 60 to Å“ 90.
B RENEWVAL BoNus.-For each licence renewed an club aircraft, the renewal
bonus would be unchangaed at Å“ 10 for home base flying and Å“ 12 109. away from
home base.
RESERVE FOR BRPLACM[ ENT OF AxacmRrF.-The Government would accept a
contingent liability to contribute at the rate of 10s. an hour towards the cost
of replacement aircraft. Clubs would be required to build uip funds for thst
: 1 purpose. ( ror earlier reference, please see No. 108, page 51.)
COMMONWEALTH BANK.
POLICY-ADVANCES.
In Parlia-ment-On 10th March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr.
N Chifley) said-
" The need to restrict the activities of non-essential enterprises must
be apparent. In view of the shortage of labour and materials, it would
hardly be proper to permit the erection of unnecessary structures such
as picture theatres and amusement parks, thus diverting building
materials from more undertakings such as housing. Actually there has
been a substantial increase of bank advances in this country, as I shall
show later by quoting figures. Let me first make this point clear: The
instructions relating to advance policy have been issued at the instance
of the Commonwealth Bank, but I say at once that they have the
endorsement of the Government.
" Cabinet does not interfere with the policy of the Commonwealth
Bank. When the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank put the posituated
by excessive advances, I, as Treasurer, intimated on behalf of
teGovernment that I endorsed the proposal. I say that the instructios
wreissued with the full approval of the Governor of the CommonwalthBank;
that they were discussed with him; and that on
behalf of the Government I agreed with the bank's decision. With
more than 200,000 people required to do essential work throughout
this country, it would be highly undesirable for the Commonwealth
Bank, through the private banks, to facilitate the expenditure of large
sums of money on non-essential enterprises. The aim of the instructions
is to ensure that the increased money being made available in
bank advances shall be directed into -channels which will provide the
greatest benefit to the community. 
NT ~ 38
" The fact is that general advances have increased from
Å“ 200,000,000 to Å“ 320,000,000 in two and a half years. Since June,
1946, about nineteen months ago, the total has increased by
Å“ 113,000,000. I emphasize that many trading companies want to carry
on their businesses on bank advances instead of going to the public
and getting the capital necessary for expansion. This is because interest
rates are much lower than they were, and because companies
can secure bank advances more cheaply than they can raise funds in
other ways. There has been a tendency on the part of many firms
to use bank advances even for the purpose of financing capital expenditure,
which ought to be financed by calling up capital from the great
amount of surplus money which is available in the community. There
can be no question that there is an inflationary spiral, not a deflationary
spiral, in the community.
" There has been a great and expanding spiral of advances in this
country. There can he only one ultimate result to such a process if the
money is used for purposes other than the legitimate expansion of
production. An increasing amount of new credit is being made available.
Whether it is made available by the Commonwealth Bank or
by private banks does not matter; the effect with the community is
precisely the same. The instructions were issued in the belief that
the most disastrous thing that could happen to Australia to-day would
he an inflation such as is occurring, in other countries. Inflation is
almost as bad as deflation, because finally it brings about an economic
collapse. Unless the national bank of any country exercises some
control in periods of inflationary trends as well as in periods of deflationary
trends, it does not do justice to the community. It must
take steps to ensure that any unduly inflationary or deflationary movement
is corrected.
The Opposition cannot have it both ways by saying on one day
that there should not be political interference with the banks and then,
on another day, saying that directions as to the administrative policy
of the Commonwealth Bank should come from this Parliament.
The national income for 1947-48 is estimated at Å“ 200,000,000
more than for 1946-47. The gross value of rural production is estimated
this year at Å“ 537,000,000, an increase of Å“ 157,000,000 over the
total of 1946-47. I need not go into details of wage earnings, hilt
their rate is 20 per cent. above the rate for 1945-46. By the end of
IDecember, 1948, it is likely to be 35 per cent. above the rate for 1945-46.
Export prices in December, 1947, were 200 per cent. above the average
level for the period 1936-39. There has been an increase of 44 per
cent, since December, 1946. Wool prices in January, 1948, were 220
per cent. above the 1936-39 level and were even 79 per cent. above the
level which prevailed in January, 1947. Wheat prices in January,
1948, were 400 per cent, above the 1936-39 level and were 94 per cent.
above the January, 1947, level.
" These facts prove that a vast accumulation of money is flowing
into the community. Whether this money comes in the form of wages,
ieturns to wheat-rowers, or in other ways, it is clear that a great 
number of. people in the community, instead of engaging in further
speculative business, should be paying off some of the advances, made to
them when there was not so much ready money available in the cornmunity
as there is now. What we are faced with in Australia now is
the opposite of deflation. That is proved by the fact that bank advances
haeincreased by atotal of Å“ 200,000,000 in two and ahalf
years. As I have often said, control of the Commonwealth Bank, or of
any national bank, subject to over-all government policy, must be exercised
to a fair degree by those persons who are responsible for its
functions. They are in possession of the facts and figures necessary
.1 for their guidance. I have cited some of those figures to-day, and I
consider that what has been done by the bank is very wise in the light
of existing economic circumstances."

TARIFF.
CUSTOMS-BILL INTRODUCED.
In Parliament.-On 11th March, 1948, the Minister for Post-war
Reconstruction ( Mr. Dedman) -introduced the Customs Tariff Bill.
The bill was passed.
( For earlier references, please see No. 132, page 3: No. 134, page
MINING.
RADIO-ACTIVE MINERALS-THORIUM.
On 16th March, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
The Bureau of Mineral Resources -has carried out investigations
for some time of beach sands along the coasts of northern New South
Wales and -southern Queensland to assess their value as a potential
source of radio-active minerals. Several companies have been engaged
in processing the sands.
" Cabinet decided to-day that the bureau be authorized to carry
out expenditure to conserve thorium-bearing minerals."
MIGRATION.
ALLIED SERVICEMEN, ASSISTED PAS-SAGES.
On 16th March, 1948, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Calwell)
said-Ex-service personnel, with their dependants, who served during
World War II. in the armed forces or merchant navies or resistande
movements of Holland, Belgium, France, Norway and Denmark will
subject to the usual immigration -requirements and security checks, be
eligible for assisted passages. Nationals of Holland, Belgium, France,
Nor-way and Denmark, with their dependants, who served during
World War II. in the armed forces or merchant navies of British
Empire countries or the United States will be included.
Under the scheme, the Commonwealth Government will contributeup
to 40 per cent. of the tourist class fare or Å“ stg. 30 towards the cost 
of the fares of adult migrants and amounts ranging from 45 to 100 per
cent. ( with a minimum of Å“ 17 10s. and a maximum -of E35) towards
the fares of dependent children."
GOVERNMENT POLICY-ITALY, ROUMANIA, BULGARIA,
IHUNGARY.
On 24th March, 1948, Mr. Calwell announced that, following the
ratification of peace treaties with Italy, Roumania, Bulgaria and Rungary,
it had been decided to modify the policy governing the entry of
nationals of those countries into Australia. At present, only persons
who were the wives, unmarried daughters or minor unmarried sons of
residents of Australia were eligible for admission. Under the modified
policy, Italians, Roumanians, Bulgarians and Hungarians might be
admitted if skilled in undernamed trades or professions, or suited for
and would engage in occupations in which there was a definite shortage
of labour, and came within certain age limits. A system of priorities
would operate-
Persons classed as essential workers, nominated and to be found accommodation
by residents in Australia.
Persons nominated find to be found accommodation by Australian residents,
and to engage in employment which was undermanned.
Single persons without noiiators in Australia, who would engage in
essential employment and for whom accommodation could readily be found.
Certain preferences would apply within the priorities. First preference
would go to migrants who were suited for, and engage in,
rural work such as farm labourers, cane cutters, timber cutters.
Second preference would be granted to those who would be employed in
occupations which would help to relieve the housing shortage such
as the production of building materials and housing construction
projects. Third preference would go to those who would engage in
work connected with national undertakings in rural districts such as
water conservation, electricity projects, road and rail construction.
It would be a condition of admission in every case that the migrant
would engage in the class of work for which he was nominated and
would remain in the dietrict to w~ hich -he was assigned for two years.
At the end of that period, those who proved themselves satisfactory
migrants would be allowed to remain permanently. Any who did not
observe the conditions would be liable to summary deportation.
* DEPARTMENT OF SUPPLY AND SHIPPING.
PROPOSED LEGISLATION.
On 16th March, 1913, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" The Supply and Development Act of 1939 constituted the Department
of Supply and Development, its functions being the provision or
supply of munitions; the manufacture or assembly of aircraft or
parts thereof; extension of industries for purposes of defence;
acquisition, maintenance and disposal -of stocks of goods in connexion
with defence; and surveys of Australian industrial capacity and the 
investigation and development of Australian sources of supply of goods
necessary for the economic security of the Commonwealth in time of

by National Security ( Munitions) Regulations to a new Department
of Munitions. In 1942, the shipping and associated functions of
the Departments of Labour * and National Service, Commerce and
Agriculture, and Trade and Customs were transferred to the Department

NATIONALITY,
UNIFORMITY-PROPOSED LEGISLATION.
On 18th March, 1948, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Calwell)
announced that legislation would be prepared to confer on Australians
the status of Australian citizenship in addition to, and not as distinct
from, the general status of British subject. The British Government
had introduced the British Nationality Bill in February, 1948, givingeffect
to the principle that the people of each of the self-governing
countries within the British Commonwealth should have both a
particular status as citizens of their own country and a common status
as members of the wider association of peoples comprising the Commonwealth.
In 1946, the Canadian Government had enacted legislation
which came into operation on 1st January, 1947, to provide for the
grant of Canadian citizenship, combined with the maintenance of the
status of British subject. NEW ZEALAND.

GOODS " DECLARED "-SERVICES, REVOCATION.
On 19th March, 1948, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice)
announced that services supplied or carried on by certain nonproprietary
organizations not conducted for private gain had been
removed from price control. These were-
Services supplied or carried on by a society or association, not being a society
or association carried on for the purposes of profit or gain to the individual
members thereof:-
Registered under the law of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth
relating to friendly societies;
Being a trade union or an association of employers or employees
registered under any Act of the Commonwealth or a State or any
O rdinance of a Territory of the Commonwealth relating to the settlement
of industrial disputes;
Established to promote the development of aviation or of the agricultural
or viticultural or industrial resources of Australia;
Established for musical purposes, or for the encouragement of music,
art or literature;
Established for the purposes of any athletic game or sport, or for the
encouragement or control of any athletic game or sport.
One effcect of the decision would be to remove from control admission
charges to many sporting events, musical shows and other entertainment
and functions but would apply only to events conducted purely for the
encouragement or control of the sport or art. Charges for boxing
matches, cinema and theatrical shows and horse, dog and motor racing,
if run for commercial gain, would still be subject to control.
PALESTI NE.
UNITED NATIONS DECISION-MINISTER'S STATEMENT.
On 22nd March, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.
Evatt) said-
" Decision of a competent international conference should be
accepted after there has been full inquiry and fair debate and a just
settlement has been reached. Accordingly, any setting aside of the
United Nations Assembly decision on Palestine must be closely
scrutinized. It is impossible to examine the new plan in detail because nothing
definite is known about it. It is said that trusteeship will be the new
solution. But the word itself is ambiguous. What does it mean?
It certainly seems to imply that the peoples to be placed under trusteeship
are not sufficiently advanced for self-government. Such a
suggestion would seem to be untenable in relation either to the
Palestinian Arabs or to the Palestinian Jews.
If, however, what is now proposed is a temporary United Nations
trusteeship merely to carry out the Assembly's decisions, it would be a
very different matter. But is that intended?
" The final decision was reached in December, 1947, after two
General Assemblies had dealt most carefully and exhaustively with the
Y matter, after all parties were heard, and after a special commission 
43
involving very heavy United Nations expenditure had visited Palestine
and reported in favour of the principle of the plan ultimately adopted in
the Assembly. The plan adopted is inappropriately labelled partition'
because it involves four separate points: first, economic union of the
whole of Palestine under the control of an authority with a majority
of ' United Nations membership; second, political division of Palestine
into two new States, Jewish and Arab; third, United Nations trusteeship
over Jerusalem and Bethlehem; fourth, four safeguards for the
holy places and especially for the Christian churches throughout -the
whole of Palestine.
" The only alternative plan suggested to the Assembly was to
establish a unitary State under Arab domination with no a dequat
safeguards for the protection either of the Jewish peoples or of th'.
Jewish churches. This alternative was plainly inadmissible and was
rejected by an overwhelming majority. The United Nations decision
was reached by more than a two-thirds majority, the only dissentients
being the Arab States and certain nations very closely associated with
them. The decision was just and impartial and must not be lightly set
aside. The United Nations did not intermeddle in the Palestine matter.
It intervened only after the British Government had specially requested
the United Nations Assembly to handle the matter as all previous efforts
at reconciliation between the Arabs and Jews had entirely failed. At
the United Nations, the British Government did not itself propose any
solution and announced it would accept the United Nations decision.
In the circumstances, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New
Zealand all supported the proposal finally adopted. After all that has
occurred, to throxv the solution into the melting pot again may be very
damaging to the authority of the United Nations.
It has been contended that the enforcement of the Assembly's
decision is not possible. Had the great powers who supported the proposal
at Lake Success, New York, adhered firmly to it, there probably
would have been little difficulty. In any event, under the Assembly's
decision, the new Jewish State and the new Arab States were each to be
entitled to establish its own militia forces for the defence of the new
territories, and this decision clearly carried with it the right of Jews
as well as Arabs to import arms and equipment for the purposes of
defence. It is impossible to pass final judgment on the new proposal because
no one has explained it as yet.
I was chairman of the committee which worked assiduously to
obtain a just solution. The committee repeatedly modified its proposals
at the suggestion of the mandatory power in order that Britain should
be able to withdraw its forces after its long, its thankless, but on the
whole successful development of the Palestine area since it was captured
from the Turks by British and Australian forces in 1918. 
44
" In my opinion, the United Nations decision has been graduallyundermined
by intrigues directed against the Jewish people. It would
be little short of a tragedy if the fundamental right of self-government
were to be denied to the Jews and Arabs, as it is guaranteed to them.
under the Assembly decision just as religious freedom is also guaranteed
td the Christian Church throughout Palestine.
The only considerations that influenced the United Nations
Assembly were those of justice and fair dealing to all concerned. It
would be most disturbing if mere consideration of power politics orexpediency
were allowed to detroy the decision. However, if a special
-United Nations Assembly is called, it is hardly likely to accept any new
? Ian which involved a repudiation of the previous decision, unless new
facts of overwhelming cogency are proved to exist. I need hardly add'
that, under the United Nations Charter, the Security Council seem's to
have no power whatever to overrule the recommendation of the-
Assembly ( For earlier reference, please see No. 130, page 37.)

PARLIAMENT.
REPRESENTATION-AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY.
On 5th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
The question of according representation in Parliament to residents
of the Australian Capital Territory was considered by the Commonwealth
Government in September, 1944, and the decision was
deferred, the then Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) indicating that the
matter would be approached again after the war and after the taking
of the census. A deputation from the Citizens Rights League of
Canberra has since waited on me and renewed the request that residents
of the Australian Capital Territory be accorded representation in
Parliament. 2565.-2 
Cabinet to-day decided to make a recommendation to the Federal
Parliamentary Labour party that the Australian Capital Territory
should be given representation in the House of Representatives on the
same lines as is accorded to the Northern Territory."
REPRESENTATION-INCREASED MEMBERSHIP, BILL
INTRODUCED:
In Parliament.-On 16th April, 1943, the Attorney-General ( Dr.
Evatt) introduced the Representation Bill. Dr. Evatt said-
The purpose of this bill is to enlarge the Commonwealth Parliament.
During the first ha] f century of Australia's history as a nation,
its population has more than doubled. During these years there has
been a great expansion, under the stimulus especially of t-wo world wars
and a world depression, of the responsibilities borne by this Parliament.
The purpose of the bill is to enlarge both Houses of the Parliament so
that its numbers will be more in keeping with these fundamental
iwtors in our political life.
' 1To function efficiently, a democracy must devise a system of representaslon
of the people in which the diverse views and interests of the
community can find expression. This cannot be achieved if the number
orepresentatives is too small. There is no automatic scale of numbers
of areas for securing the best democratic results. Nevertheless, it is
clear that Australia has altogether outgrown. the small Parliamentary
bodies with which the federation was equipped in 1900. How small
numerically is the Commonwealth Parliament, in comparison with some
of the State legislatures, can be seen from the following figures:
Legislative Legisative
Cnujcl. Assemnbly.
New South Wales 60
Victoria 34
Senate. Representatives.
Commonwealth 36 74
" The Constitution empowers Parliament to increase the size of the
Parliament if it thinks fit, but, : ys down certain conditions which must
b'e observed. The most -important of these conditions is that the number
of members of the House of Representatives must always -be as nearly
as practicable twice the number of senators. If, therefore, the number
of representatives is to be increased there must of necessity be a
correlative increase in the number of senators. Accordingly, this bill
effects an increase of the number of senators, with the appropriate
correlative increase of the number of members of the House.
The bill provides that there shall be ten senators for each State
instead of six. Thus, the total number of senators will be increased
from 36 to 60. Authority for the proposals contained in the ' bill is
provided by the Constitution which sets out that the Parliament may
make laws increasing or diminishing the number of senators for each
State, but so that equal representation of the several original States 
shall be maintained, and further, that whenever the number of -senators
lb increased, the Parliament may make such provisions for the vacating
of the places of senators as it deems necessary to maintain regularity
in the rotation.
The Constitution lays down that the number of members of the
House of Representatives shall be, as nearly as practicable, twice the
number of senators. Therefore, if the number of senators is in-creased,
as provided in the till now presented, the number of members of the
House of Representatives must be correspondingly raised to a number,
as nearly as practicable, twice the number of the senators. The actual
number will probably be 121.
Pursuant to the Constitution, and the Representation Act, the
actual increase of the number of members of the House of Representatives
which will follow the passing of this bill will be from 74 to 121.
There will be no change in Tasmania, but in the other States the
numbers will increase as follows-
New South Wales-from 28 to 47.
Victoria-from 20 to 33.
Queensland-from 10 to 18.
South Australia-from 6 to
Western Australia-from 5 to 8.
" Since the establishment of the Commonwealth the population of
Australia has more than doubled. It has increased from 3,765,339
in 1900 to 7,580,820 in 1947. At the 1903 Senate elections 1,893,586
electors were enrolled. To-day the number is 4,780,334, or more than
two and a half times as many. In 1903, in the aggregate there was one
senator for each 52,596 electors. To-day the ratio is one senator for each
132,787 electors. If the number of senators is increased to 60, the
ratio at the next elections will be one senator to each 83,000 electors
approximately, which is less, proportionately, than in 1903.
In 1903, each member of the House of Representatives represented,
on an average, 25,247 electors. To-day, the average is 64,599, whilst
if Tasmania is omitted, and allowance made for the expected rise in
enrolment in the meantime, the average for the mainland divisions
towards the end of this Parliament will be about 69,000 electors. However,
if the number of members of the House of Representatives be
increased. to 121, the average number of electors per member at the
time of the next elections will be reduced to approximately 41,300, or,
omitting Tasmania, 41,680.
" It is proposed to bring the Senate up to the full strength of
senators as from the day of the first meeting of the Parliament after
the next dissolution of the Rouse of Representatives. This will be
necessary in order that membership of the Senate shall, from that date,
be approximately half of that of the House of Representatives as is
provided in the Constitution. Accordingly, the bill provides that apart
from any long casual vacancies that may have to be filled, seven senators
shall be chosen in each State at the next elections. 
Four of the new senators elected in each State will take office
as from the date of the first meeting of the Parliament after the
elections, and, according to the order of their election, will continue
in office until 30th June, 1956, or 30th June, 1953. The 4: 2 new
senators, together with the eighteen who will not retire for a further
three -years, will bring the Senate membership up to
" Under the present system, three senators will be elected for the
ordinary six-year period of office which will commence as from 1st
July following; that leaves four more to be elected. At each subsequent
election of senators, five senators will normally be elected in each State,
making 30 to -be elected at each periodical election." [ The bill was passed.

ELECTORAL ACT-PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION,
SENATE, BILL INTRODUCED.
In Parliament.-On 16th April, 1948, Dr. Evatt introduced the
Commonwealth Electoral Bill. Dr. Evatt said-
The purpose of the bill1 is to make provision for the application
of proportional representation to the election of senators. Before
1918, senators were elected by what is termed the first past the post
method. Each voter was required to place a cross in the square opposite
the names of the candidates for whom he desired to vote, the number
of crosses permitted being confined to the exact number of senators to
be elected. Thus where three senators were required the three
candidates with the greatest number of crosses were chosen, and as
was usually the case the three elected were candidates of the same
party. " In 19418, the ' preferential block majority' system was introduced
in respect of Senate elections. This system continued the principle
of the old ' first past the post' system in that under it all seats in a
State generally go to the party, or combination of parties, favoured
at the time by a bare, or simple majority of the electors. It might
he described as the all or none system, either all or none of a party's
candidates being elected. The system used since 1918 may he considered
an improvement on the old system only to the extent that it ensures
majority representation as against possible minority representation.
The great defect, from the representation aspect, of both the
first past the post and the block majority'I system is that at an
election, generally all seats in a State have been won by candidates
of the one party, leaving a minority of between 40 to 50 per cent.
of the electors without any representation at all in the Senate. For
many years there has been a demand that the Parliament should
provide a system of electing senators which would give more equitable
results and enable the electorate to be more truly represented in the 
7
Senate. The Government has decided that, in relation to the election
of senators, where each State votes as one electorate, the fairest system
and the one most likely to enhance the status of the Senate is that of
proportional representation.
The bill sets out in detail the method of counting to be adopted
in respect of future elections of senators. The method is generally in
accord with the practice laid down by the Proportional Representation
Society. All I need say about the principle is that the name of the
system indicates the result intended to be achieved, that the electors
will be represented, in the number . of those elected, approximately
proportionately to their expression of opinion. For example, if five
are to be elected and one party's candidates poll 55 per cent. of the
total votes, the result would ' be that that party would have three
candidates elected, and the remaining two elected, assuming that only
two parties contested the poll, would be candidates of the opposing
party and they would represent 40 per cent. of the electors. This
system follows closely the provisions contained in the Proportional
Representation Bill 1912 ( Great Britain) and the system employed in
respect of municipal elections in Britain and South Africa. It is
virtually identical with the method used in the election of the
Parliament of Eire and is similar to the system employed in respect
of parliamentary elections for the New South Wales Legislative
Assembly from 1920 to 1925. In principle, the method proposed is
the same as that used in Tasmania although for reasons of workability
and simplicity it differs slightly in its practical application.
It is not proposed to alter the existing style of Senate ballot-paper
nor the provision that candidates may be grouped thereon with their
names in such order within the group as they desire. Nor is it intended
to vary the requirement that voters must indicate the order of their
preference for all the candidates. Whilst this latter requirement might
have the effect of continuing to produce a fairly high informal vote,
it definitely precludes the possibly greater evil of exhausted votesthat
is, votes which become exhausted in the process of transfer. If
a voter were to indicate his preference for only three of, say, seven
candidates, his vote would be effective up to the number of preferences
shown on his ballot-paper and after that it would be effective nd longe'r.
At that stage, the vote would be said to be exhausted. In Tasmaniaa,
the elector need not vote for all candidates and therefore on occasions
a fairly high percentage of votes becomes exhausted in the process of
transferring the votes of a lower candidate or the surplus of a higher
candidate to the next candidate in order of preference. One result of
a system which does not require the electors to vote for all candidates
whose names appear on the ballot-paper is that a candidate may be
declared elected although the total number of votes credited to hifm
falls, shot of the required quota. At the parliamentary elections in
New South Wales in 1922 and 1925, the exhausted votes, which far
outnumbered the informal votes, were the cause of much dissatisfaction
and disputation.
2565.-3 
" The bill prescribes the manner in which the several vacancies
shall be filled. As hitherto, the count will be carried out under the
direction of the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State concerned
in thc offices of the respective Divisional Returning Officers. For
instance, in New South Wales, where there are 47 divisions, there -will
be 47 points at which the count will be carried out. This will ensure
completion of count with the greatest safety, The maximum of speed
and the minimum of cost. When the Commonwealth Electoral Officer
has received the final results of the count of first preference votes from
all returning officers and has totalled them, he will determine a quota
by dividing the total number bf first preference votes by one more
than the number of candidates required to be elected and by increasing
the quotient so obtained by'one. That appears to be complicated, but
if in New South Wales, for example, there were 1,600,00 valid votes
and seven senators had to be elected, the total number would be divided,
not by seven, but by eight, giving a quotient of 200,000. This would
give a quota of 200,000 plus one.
This formula for determining a quota, which, in effect, produces
the lowest number which, when multiplied by the number of candidates
to be elected, leaves a remainder of votes less than that lowest number,
is the one recommended by the Proportional Representation Society
and is used in Tasmania, in Fire, and generally in all places in British
communities where proportional representation has been applied. Any
candidate who, either on the count of the first preference votes or at any
subsequent stage, obtains a number of votes equal to or greater than
the quota shall be elected, and until all vacancies have been filled, the
surplus votes-that is, any number in excess of the quota-of such
elected candidate will be transferred in the manner set out in the bill
to the continuing candidates in strict proportion to. the voters' next
preferences. " The method of disposing of an elected candidate's surplus votes
prescribed in the bill is the one recommended by the Proportional
Representation Society and is precisely the same as that used in Fire
and in municipal'elections in Britain and South Africa, and it is similar
to the method employed in oonnexlon with the parliamentary elections
in New South Wales in the early nineteen-twenties. It differs from the
Tasmanian practice in that whereas in Tasmania all the votes of the
elected candidate are transferred at a fractional value so that every
single paper is looked at under the proposed method only such number
of votes as equals the surplus, taken in strict proportion to the preferences
on the whole of the votes of the elected candidate, are transferred.
No doubt that provision will require some consideration in
committee. It is thought that the Tasmanian system, while suitable
where the number of votes is comparatively small and all such votes
are concentrated at one centre, is not readily capable of being efficiently
worked by too remote a control. Consequently, to employ that system
at a Senate election, it would first be necessary to assemble the whole of 
the ballot-papers for the State at one centre. Not only would this delay
completion, involve risks of loss in transit, and increase costs heavily,
but also in the larger States the Commonwealth Electoral Officer would
be faced with the almost insuperable task of securing for a period of
several weeks the extensive accommodation, equipment and staff needed.
" While it might be claimed that the Tasmanian system is mathematically
more exact, tests that have been made reveal that a similar
result is obtained by the employment of the method proposed. As an
illustration, I shall state a hypothetical case in New South Wales and
for this purpose I shall assume for the moment that a Labour candidate
has received 900,000 votes of the total number of 1,600,000. The quota
being 200,000, he has a surplus of 700,000 votes for distribution. This
would usually result in three full quotas being obtained for other candidates
on the list. The proposal embodied in the bill is that the officers
will not look at all of the votes. They will take the surplus available
and will assume that the No. 2 vote, which would be the effective vote
in the first instance, would reproduce a proportion in respect of the
surplus of 700,000 that would be true of the total of 900,000. Tests
have shown that the result would be the same as if all of the 900,000
votes were scrutinized. Questioned as to the likelihood of difference,
eminent mathematicians advised the Proportional Representation
Society of England that-
Whenever a considerable number of votes is in play the element of chance
involved is so small as to be negligible.
" Dealing with the point in its comprehensive report on electoral
systems, the British royal commission of 1908 said-
The chance of the result being affected is too small to be seriously considered.
We agree with the Proportional Representation Society that the additional
labour involved ( in the Tasmanian system) is greater than it is worth.
The bill further provides that if after the count of the first preference
votes or after the transfer of the surplus votes of an elected
candidate at any stage, no candidate or less than the number required
to be elected has or have obtained the quota, then the candidate with
the fewest votes shall be excluded and the whole of his ballot-papers
transferred to the continuing candidates; and if thereupon no candidate
has yet reached the quota, the process of excluding the candidate with
the fewest votes and the transferring of his ballot-papers will continue
until a continuing candidate has received a number of votes equal to
the quota or in respect of the last vacancy a majority of the votes.
Where candidates are elected at the same time, the order of their election
shall be determined to the extent of their surplus votes. The candidate
with the largest surplus shall be the first elected and so on. The same
principle will apply in relation to the transfer of surplus votes. The
largest surplus will be transferred first and so on. If on any count two
or more candidates have an equal number of votes and one of them has
to be excluded the Commonwealth Electoral Officer shall decide the
candidate to be excluded, or if two or more candidates are elected with
an equal number of votes the Commonwealth Electoral Officer will 
decide the order of their election and the transfer of their votes, or if
in the final count for the filling of the last vacancy two candidates have
an equal number of votes, the Commonwealth Electoral Officer will
decide which shall be elected but that except as so provided the Coinimonwealth
Electoral Officer shall not vote at the election. That is
really the last resort. The chances against its happening in a Senate
election are enormous.
The result of the system is clear. There will be two major groups
of political parties, and seven senators will be elected, in the absence
of any casual vacancies, in each State. The party which secures 53
per cent. or .55 per cent. of the aggregate votes will, provided the party
ticket is followed, have four of the seven candidates to be returned.
The three remaining seats will be filled by the candidate from the other
party which secured 47 per cent. of the votes. That is certain".
[ The bill was passed.
CANBERRA.
FURTHER DEVELOPMENT.
On 5th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" In ' September, 1947, the Minister for the Interior ( Mr. Johnson)
arranged for a committee consisting of representatives of the Public
Service Board, Departments of the Treasury, Works and Housing and
Interior, to discuss proposals for the future development of Canberra.
Cabinet to-day considered the committee's report and made the following
decisions:-
ADDITIONAL DEPARTMENTS.-The first stage of from one to three years involving
the transfer of 882 officers to Canberra; the second stage of three to five
years involving the transfer of 1,703 officers of the Departments of Repatriation,
Social Services, Labour, Civil Aviation, Transport, Works and jHousing, the
Office of Education, the War Service Land Settlement Division, the Public Relations
Division, and the Re-establishment Division of the Department of Postwar
Reconstruction: the third stage of five to seven years involving 772 officers
of the Postmaster-General's Department, the Meteorological Division of the
Department of the Interior, the Grants Commission and Tariff Board; the fourth
stage of seven to ten years involving 3,670 officers of the Departments of Defence,
Navy, Army, Air, Munitions, Supply and Shipping, Secondary Industries Division
of the Department of Post-war Reconstruction and the Defence Division of
the Treasury.
ADLINISTATIVE BUILDINo.-The question of a second building to house additional
departments to be transferred and to cope with the extension of permanent
departments ( on lines similar to the one already approved) will be considered
by the Cabinet sub-committee appointed to deal with the dispersal of Government
buildings.
CLUB HOUSE.-A Club House to be erected by the Government to cater for the
needs of young male and female officers living in boarding houses and the like.
The club to be run by a committee of the officers. It may be possible to extend
facilities of the club to young persons not employed by the government.
JEBvIS BATY.-Cabinet had already decided that this area should be developed
as a tourist resort and that a short route trunk road between Canberra and
Jervis Bay will be taken up with the New South Wales Government.
NATIONAL CAPITAL PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE AND CIVIC
BRANCH OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOI:.-T'i'? organization to accelerate
the work of the committee is under consideration. 
Civic MANAGEMENT.-An inter-departmental committee considered the constitution
and powers of the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council and
the appointment to various boards and committees of non-official persons. If a
suitable person can be found an appointment will be made so that an investigation
could be carried out into the present system of management in Canberra.
MOUNTAIN AND SEASIDE RESORTS AND TOURIST FAOILITIE.-A suitably qualified
person will be obtained to report on this matter and also on the question
of development of facilities to attract tourists.
ESTABLISHMENT OF INDUSTRY.-This matter will be referred to the Secondary
Industries Commission for advice."
WAR WITH JAPAN.
OCCUPATION FORCE-COMMITTEE'S INQUIRY.
On 5th April, 1948, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Chambers)
announced that a committee of investigation had been appointed to inquire
into allegations of immorality and black marketing among

PUBLISHING INDUSTRY.
On 5th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
In December, 1946, after considering a report on the publishing
industry prepared by the Tariff Board, Cabinet appointed a subcommittee
consisting of the Ministers for Post-war Reconstruction
( Mr. Dedman), Information ( Mr. Calwell) and Health ( Senator
McKenna) to consider and advise on means of assisting this industry
other than those means coming within the province of the Department
of Customs. In March, 1948, a meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee, with the
Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice) attending, examined a report
made by an inter-departmental committee on the subject.
" Cabinet decided to-day that a committee comprising the Director
of Education ( Professor R. C. Mills), the National Librarian ( Mr.

Cabinet decided to-day that the Commonwealth Government should
provide assistance towards the cost of a scheme to reticulate water to
certain rural areas of Western Australia, to towns along the Great
Southern Railway and to increase the supply to the eastern gold-fields
areas. This proposal has been the subject of representations by the
present and previous Western Australian Governments. 
The estimated cost is Å“ 4,300,000 spread over a six years' period
and the Commonwealth proposes to meet half the capital cost, flue to
shortages of -plant and materials, it may not hbe possible to commence the
work for some time." ANTARCTI CA.

On 5th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
In 1913, the Scott Polar Research Institute was established at
London in memory of the late Captain R. F. Scott to promote polar
research work and -exploration. Recently, the institute asked the
British Treasury for a further grant to increase its income. Cabinet
decided to-day that a grant of Å“ E500 be made to the institute, continuation
of the grant to be reviewed after a year."
AUSTRALIAN EXPEDITION-PROGRESS.
On 5th April, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
"' Cabinet to-day considered a report on the progress of the Australian
antarctic expedition.
" Cabinet decided that the scientific and meteorological bases successfully
established at Heard and Macquarie Islands in December,
1947, and February, 1948, be maintained in accordance with original
plans. The Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt) indicated that
the development of a full programme ( including the establishment and
maintenance of a permanent base on the A-ntarctic Continent itself)
would involve the acquisition of a new ship in addition to the vessel
Wyatt . Earp at present being used.
Reviewing the finances of the expedition, Cabinet approved of
an expenditure of Å“ 327,000 for the current financial year's activities.
This includes the establishment of fixed instalments at Heard and Macquarie
Islands and considerable supplies of technical equipment for
the parties there also for the scientific activities carried out by the
Wyatt Earp. A sum of Å“ 200,000 h. as been set aside for operations in
1948-49. Cabinet agreed that further consideration should * be given to the
exploitation of sea elephants on Heard and Macquarie Islands if this
should be proved commercially profitable.
" An inter-departmental committee consisting of representatives of
the Departments of the Treasury, Public Service Board, External
Affairs, External Territories, Commerce, and Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research will he set up to make recommendations regarding
future administrative arrangements for Australia's antarctic work."
AUSTRALIAN EXPEDITION-ADM IN ISTRATITON.
On 4th May, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
Cabinet to-day adopted the recommendations of an inter-departmental
committee set up to consider an appropriate organization for
the future administration of the Antarctic Expedition. This will be 
done by the organization of an Antarctic section within the. Department
of External Affairs which will be temporarily located at Melbourne.
In addition, a committee will be established as an advisory
body to the Department and the Antarctic section on matters connected
with exploration, scientific research, development and the like of the
Antarctic Territory. This committee will replace the existing advisory
commnittee. The facilities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research will be used as much as possible in the planning of scientific
research in the Territory and in the collation and distribution of the
resulting information." RECONSTRUCTION.
WORLD ORGANIZATION-UNITED NATIONS DAY.
On 5th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Cabinet decided to-day that 24th October be officially proclaimed
United Nations Day'I and appropriate celebrations over the radio and
in the schools -be arranged with the assistance of the Australian National
Committee of the United Nations. The United Nations' flag will be
flown on all Commonwealth buildings and State governments will be
asked to do likewise."
WORLD ORGANIZATION-FREEDOM OF INFORMATION.
On 18th April, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt)
said-The United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information has
reached important conclusions. It recommends to all countries positive
measures to spread factual information on international affairs and
it condemns all propaganda designed or likely to provoke or encourage
any threat to the peace. Unanimity between the eastern and western
nations of Europe was obtained and this is, in itself, one step forward
in the positive effort to prevent World War III.
The part played by Australia has been notable. Our delegation's
imitiative has been widely and favorably commented on. Australia
succeeded in securing the acceptance of one of the main resolutions.
The chairman of the conference paid a special tribute to Auitralia,
rebuffing the defeatist attitude of a tiny section of Australians who, in
spite of the bitter lessons of the Pacific war, are opposed to the active
participation of their country in international affairs.
One of the greatest contributions to peace which can be made is
to discourage propaganda and distorted reporting, which represents
a real danger in times of international tension. The best way of
preventing war-mongering propaganda is not any form of censorship,
but fair and accurate reporting of the facts. The most effective way
to handle war-mongers is not ' by suppression, but by free reporting.
" This Geneva success, following the General Assembly resolution,
demonstrates that middle Powers like Australia can play a major
role in composing differences between the great Powers, and in helping
to ' prevent the world from crystallizing into rigid and opposing blocs. 
14
" It is not enough to criticize war-mongering. Friendly relations
between countries must be encouraged. Positive means of co-operation
and assistance will soon arrest any ' drift towards war."

In Parliament.-On 7th April, 1948, the Leader of the Opposition
( Mr. Menzies) moved the following motion:
That in the opinion of this House
Communist activities in Australia are subversive.
( b Communists in Australia have fomented widespread stoppages of
employment, sought to weaken the authority of the industrial law,
and inflicted misery and loss upon thousands of citizens.
There is good reason to believe that Australian Communists act in
the interests of a foreign power.
Recent events in Europe have p roved that Conmmunist minorities in
counitries outside the Soviet Union are organized so as to overthrow
hy force majority rule in those countries.
The Governnient has failed to take any adequate steps to attack
Communist activities in Australia, or to prevent the employment
of Communists by the Commonwealth.
And that by reason of the above the Government deserves the censure of this
House. Mr. Chifley said-
Mr. Menzies has made what purports to be a denunciation of a
great social evil in this community, but, in a speech of more than
minutes' duration, he did not make one suggestion as to how that evil
should be cured. The press has done him a grave injustice. The press,
for some weeks now, has carried announcements that at last he has 
been weaned or forced--I presume forced-from his previous views
in regard to communism. One would, accordingly, have expected him
to-day to have taken the high jump at the suggestion of the Australian
Country party, and plump for the banning of the Communist party;
but he did not do so. In a speech lasting for more than 40 minutes
he did not say one word about banning communism, nor did he make
one single suggestion as to how Communists should be dealt with.
" Unfortunately, a flood of communism has swept Europe. Communism
is rife not only in countries that are under Communist domination
but also in the countries that are still democratic. That is the fruit of
hundreds and hundreds of years in which 80 per cent. of the people
lived in the direst poverty. That is why the world has to suffer
communism to-day. The soil in which communism has flourished was
fertilized by people without any idea of democracy. From one extreme
the people have swung to the other. In most countries there are
Communist elements. Twenty-five years ago the Communists were
supposed to be confined to common people, manual labourers and people
of that character, but to-day communism has become something in the
nature of a religion and has drawn into its ranks many intellectuals.
They are classed as Communists, fellow travellers, and crypto-
Communists by those who see in the movement, as I do, the grave
menace to democracy that communism presents. But the evil will not
be cured or the blight on the world removed by the sort of loose talk
that goes on in Australia and other countries. I cast my mind back
to five years ago, when, as Treasurer, I said to the then Prime Minister,
the late Mr. John Curtin-
War or no war, I believe that every government has to stand up to the task
of ensuring social security to the people, because, if it does not, I fear that,
with the end of the war, the great mass of the people will be gravely dissatisfied
and wonder what the war was fought for if they are left with only poverty and
misery and no security.
" With the help and advice of my colleagues in the Australian
Labour movement, I launched the system of social security that we
enjoy to-day. In the previous 40 years, when for most of the time,
the anti-Labour parties were in power-the Labour party had few
years in office-not one piece of social legislation was passed by the
Australian Parliament. I mention that because the only way in which
to defeat communism is for the democracies of the world to be readily
democratic. " Much has been said about the suppression of minorities. According
to press reports, Mr. Menzies made some rather scathing comments
about my statement that the Australian Labour party would not lend
itself to the banning of a political party, because it held a certain
political philosophy. The Australian Labour party is entirely opposed
to the principles of communism, including its economic theories for
the management of a country, and its attitude towards religion. I
speak for the Government as well as for myself when I say that we
completely abhor the principles of communism for the attainment
of the party's objectives. However, I shall never support any policy 
I; 16
which is designed to deprive minorities of the right of expression
unless-I qualify that statement-those expressions are subversive,
seditious or in some way detrimental to the safety of the country.
" I remind opposition members that not one English-speaking
country, with the exception of Canada and Australia in war-time,
has placed a ban on the activities, political or otherwise, of the
Communists.
J " I propose to place on record the statement of the Prime Minister
of Britain ( Mr. Attlee) from the Hansard report of the House of
Commons, dated 15th March, 1948-
1 desire to mnake a statement in regard to certain matters of employment in
the Civil Service.
In answers to questions on the subject of the transfer or dismissal of certain
Government servants, I have said that there are 4certain duties of such secrecy
that the State is not justified in employing in connexion with them any one
whose reliability is in doubt.
Experience, both in this country and elsewhere, has shown that membership
of, and other forms of continuing association with, the Communist party nmkay
involve the acceptance of the individual of a loyalty, which in certain circumstances
can he inimical to the State.
It is not suggested that in matters affecting the security of the State, all
those who adhiere to the Communist party would oallow themselves thus to forget
their primary loyalty to the State. But there is no way of distinguishing such
people from those wvho, if opportunity offered, would he prepared to endanger
the security of the State in the interests of another Power. The Government
has, therefore, reached the conclusion that the only prudent course to adopt is
to ensure that no one who is known to be a member of the Communist party, Or
to be associated with it in such a way as to raise legitimate doubts about his or
her reliability, is employed in connexion with work, the natuie of which is vital
to the security of the State.
Thie same rutle will govern the einploynient of those who are known to be
actively associated with fascist organizations.
I should emphasize that this actioii is being takeii solely on security grounds.
The State is not concerned with the political views, as such, of its servants,
and as far as possible alternative employment on the wide range of non-secret
government work will be found for those who are deemed for the reason indicated
to he unsuitable for secret work. It may, however, happen that it is impossible
to find suitable employment elsewhere in the Civil Service for individuals with
specialist qualifications.
And in such cases there may he no0 alternative to refusal of employment or
dismissal. I do not propose to read all the questions which members of the
House of Commons directed to the Prime Minister in the course of this
statement, but I do desire to read a question by Sir Ian Fraser, whose
loyalty nobody doubts. Sir Ian asked-
In applying the restriction in the Government service, and as far as it affects
the British Broadcasting Corporation and the country generally, will the right
honorable gentlem~ an advise that it shall he kept within the very narrow limits
related strictly to security. Otherwise, does he not think that it is an unaccusturned
and difficult course on which lie may he embarking?
I invite Opposition members to listen carefully to Mr. Attlee's
reply-I think I made it abundantly clear in my statememit that this wvas restricted
to very narrow limits where security matters were of importance.
I have been asked to explain what action the Government is taking
against the Communists. The Government has not waited for this
clamour and for what I may describe as this wave of hysteria which is 
17
sweeping through the world and which could lead to the grave consequences
of war, when a little cool-headedness may avoid it. The Government
has always considered that, in mat ' ters involving security, all
persons entering the Public Service should he checked; and all members
of the Public Service, even though they may not have been engaged in
security work, have been subject to close scrutiny. I give to the country
a complete assurance that so far as the Commonwealth Investigation
Service and the State police forces can detect, no person whom Mr.
Attlee's description fits, is engaged in vital security work. The Government
did not wait for the present clamour, which has been raised in
the press, or any other agitation before taking steps to safeguard the
country. " The Australian Labour party is completely opposed to the principles
of communism. Let us he quite honest about this matter and
admit that within the ranks of every political party there are people
out on the wings who are extremely radical in their views. That,
incidentally, is the only reason why there is a Labour party to-day.
There would never have been a Labour party if there had not been in
the community radicals-democratic radicals-who loved their country
and fought for what they believed to be in the interests of the majority
of the people. The men who formed the Australian Labour party had
to contend with the bitterest opposition, with talk of socialism and
the red tiger' 1, and it was even alleged by their opponents that they
advocated the breaking of the marriage tie. However, in the face of
all that opposition they triumphed, and the history of the Parliament,
and particularly that of the last six years, proves that. When this
country was confronted by the gravest peril in its history-and I ask
members of the Opposition to turn this one over in their minds-the
people of Australia entrusted the administration of the country's
affairs, not to a conservative party, but to the Australian Labour party,
which represented the people. If any political party was ever condemned
at the throne of judgment in its country's hour of trial it was
the conservative parties opposite. Tens of thousands of people who had
never voted for a Labour candidate in their lives voted Labour. They
said, in effect, ' In a great crisis these are the only people who can do the
job effectively ', and the people of Australia virtually expressed the
same opinion when they voted at the last general elections.
Members of the political party to which I belong have as much
love for this country and the safety of its people as the members of
any other political party. Opposition members should not think that
they possess a monopoly of love of country. Members, of the Australian
Labour party have always been independent in their regard for the
welfare of the people. We have consistently advocated changes designed
to improve the lot of the mass of the people of this country, and I think
that that is proved by our political record.
" I do not intend to weary the House by reading the text of resolutions
adopted by the federal executive of the Australian Labour party,
but year after year that body has expressed, on behalf of the Labour 
18
movement in Australia, its strongest opposition to the Communist
party. As I said previously, it is true that in every political party,
including the Australian Labour party, there are radicals and militants.
However, many of those people are perfectly honest and quite sincere
and have no association with Communists. Opposition members cannot
blame the Australian Labour party for tbat. Behind the Opposition
political parties are objectionable people, people whom Opposition
mlembers would disown and whomn Mr. Menzies would disown. In the
same way there are on the edge of the Australian Labour party men
wvho are quite sincere, but quite radical and militant, and the views
which they express can easily be misinterpreted as expressions of
disloyalty. I have seen a great deal inside the industrial and political Labour
movement, and I have read some history. I have never known of any
minority movement in history that has not grown stronger by repressive
aFction. Let me emphasize this never is liberty more easily lost than
when we think we are defending it. My recollection embraces the
history of quite a few minority movements. Some were religious, some
were political and others were national in aim. Strenuous efforts were
mnade to repress many of then], but in almost every case they grew
stronger by repression. I have said in this House before that the people
wvill not finially accept brutal, repressive action. We can only overcome
communism in one way. Comm unism. can only be beaten by improving
the conditions of the people bad conditions are the soil in which it
thrives. There is talk of gaining political advantage or positions in
Parliament, but to me liberty is far more important than that. I
should not be a member of this Parliament if some tolerance had been
extended to the men who took part in the strike of 1917. All that
harsh oppressive treatment did, as far as I was concerned, was to transform
me, with the assistance of my colleagues, from an ordinary
common engine-driver to the Prime Minister of this country. If an
example of what harshness can do is required, my presence in this
Parliament should be sufficient.
This Government will leave no stone unturned in its efforts to
encourage the trade unions to prevent their control by Communists.
The unions have got to do that themselves it is their task. From the
political and defence point of view, the Government will do everything
possible to provide that neither Communists nor fascists are associated
with the work of ensuring the security of Australia. We shall not
begin to chase shadows. If a ban is imposed on the Communist party,
it will merely change its name, as it did in Canada, and go on in
exactly the same way. We are going to fight Communism in the open.
If there are persons in this country who are seditious, treasonable or
subversive, there are laws by whichi they canl be dealt with, and this
Government wil] deal with them [ T'he motion was defeated.

UNEMPLOYMENT-FIGURES.
On 7th April, 1948, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway) said
that the demand for labour in Australia reached a new record high
level in February, 1948. Unfilled vacancies held by the Commonwealth
Employment Service numbered 58,300 for males and 36,800 for females,
the. total of 95,100 being nearly 3,000 greater than the previous record
high level. Unemployment, although practically negligible for months
in. all States, except Queensland, had fallen even further. Recipients. of
unemployment benefit ( including re-employment allowance) numbered
6,410 males and 209 females. During February, 1948, the Commonwealth
Employment Service had referred 27,200 males and, 8,100,
females to employers, and had given advice and information on. various
matters to 28,500 males and 6,400 females.
BRITISH COMMONWEALTH OF NATION&amp;,
VISIT OF KING AND QUEEN TO AUSTRALIAPROGRAMME.
On 14th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
Advice has been received from the Private Secretary to The Kingthat
Their Majesties The King and Queen and The-Princess Margaret
will leave New Zealand so as to reach Australia on 4th. April,, 1949,.
Their Majesties and. Her Royal Highness will leave Fremantle at the:
end of the visit on 13th June, 1949.
The Cabinet sub-committee, in consultation with representatives
of the Opposition parties, has considered the division of' the period
which Their Majesties and Her Royal Highness will spend in Australia.
The outline of the itinerary, submitted to His Majesty for his approval,
shows the proposed allocation of time in the Australia Capital Territory
and in the States. The State Government&amp; have been requested
to. prepare a suggested programme for the Royal Tour, covering the
period in each State.
The proposed' itinerary and detailed programme throughout Australia
will, in due course, be presented to His Majesty for approval.?"
On 29th April, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
The following appointments have been made to the Commonwealth
staff dealing with the visit of Their Majesties the King. and Queen and
The Princess Margaret to Australia in 1949:
The Reception Officer, Prime Minister's Department ( Mr. J. S.
Murray) to be Secretary of the Royal Visit.
Mr. 0. A. Rogue to be in charge of public relations, to be joined,,
as arrangements for, the Royal Tour progress, by the Prime
Minister's Press Secretary ( Mr. D. K. Rodgers)." 
DEPARTMENT OF SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT.
REOONSTITUTION BILL INTRODUCED.
In Parliament.-On 14th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr.
Chifley) introduced the Supply and Development Bill. Mr. Chifley
said-In Britain, the services essential to the armed forces are provided
by the Ministry of . Supply, and in the ' United ' States by the Munitions
Board. The Australian Government has decided that there must be
a complementary body in the Commonwealth and has re-instituted the
Department of Supply and Development. Under an act of 1939, a
Department of Supply and Development was set up to be concerned with
the procurement and manufacture of supplies and munitions for the
armed services and to develop the resources of the Commonwealth so
that we might be prepared in the event of war. On the outbreak of war
the department was concerned with the procurement of war supplies and
with the production of munitions and aircraft, but a separate Ministry
of Munitions was set up in 1940, and, in 1941, a further Ministry of
Aircraft Production was established. Meanwhile the Department of
Supply was merged in a Department of Supply and Shipping.
With the end of the war, the departments took up an active policy
of reconversion to peace-time conditions in industry and a stage has
now been reached at which they can merge again in a combined Department
of , Supply and Development with functions similar to those which
obtained before the war. The principal change to be made in the act
is the substitution of the expression war materiel for munitions'
wherever the latter occurs. The expression has a much wider meaning
than munitions and is so used in the British and United States
forces. It may be defined as including everything used in war except
the personnel. The intention of the amendment is that the responsibility
for provision of the needs of warfare, except man-power, shall be
placed upon the new department.
The general organization of the department contemplates that
there shall be boards responsible for the management and administration
of the following four main groups of undertakings:-
Munitions production, including arms and ammunition factories; aircraft
production factories; long-range weapons research and experimental establishment;
ship construction and repairs.
There will be branches concerned with procurement of supplies
from industry for the services, including a Contract Board, mineral
resources development, including geophysical and geological surveys,
stores and transport services for the Commonwealth departments, and
scientific research and technical advice for defence purposes and for
assistance to industry generally.
Provision is made in the act to ensure the safety of the public in
connexion with the operations of the long-range weapons range and to
acknowledge the possibility of compensation should accidents unfortunately
happen. Provision is made for secrecy on the part of persons 
employed on the operations, and for the steps neccessary to prevent
enitry of unauthorized persons on secret defence undertakings and for
search of suspected persons in such areas, particularly in respect of
dangerous inflammable materials or explosive substances.
" The bill provides for continuity of service in regard to the technical
staff and employees transferred from other departments during
the war or engaged specially under regulations of the National Security
Act, so that such rights and privileges as they may have acquired as
a result of their service under the ! Commonwealth may be continued.
Opportunity is being taken to amend the act so that those salaried
employees formerly exempt from the operation of the Public Service
Act will be transferred to the Commonwealth Public Service and be
governed by the Public Service Act." [ The bill was passed.

GOODS " DECLARED "-LAMB, REVOCATION.
On 16th April, 1948, the Minister for Customs ( Senator Courtice)
announced that lamb would be removed from price control from 19th
April, 1948. The good season with the prospect of another wool clip
at a high price had encouraged graziers to hold stock, with the result
that a shortage of lamb could be expected during the coming winter.
Although there would be no general shortage of meat the shortage of
lamb created conditions favorable to the blackmarketer against
whose competition reputable traders could not carry on except at a
heavy loss. NEW ZEALAND.
VISIT OF NEW ZEALAND GOVERNOR-GENERAL.
On 19th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
His Excellency the Governor-General ( Mr. McKell), on behalf
of the Commonwealth Government, extended an invitation to the
Governor-General of New Zealand ( Lieutenant-General Sir Bernard
Freyberg) and Lady Freyberg to pay a visit to Australia. Their
Excellencies have accepted the invitation and propose to arrive in
Auztralia some time in November, 1948." 
DEFENCE.
COUNCIL OF DEFENCE-MEETING.
On 20th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
At the meeting of the Council of Defence to-day, the normal
review of the basis of Australian post-war defence policy was made
before the council proceeded to the detailed discussion of other subjects.
Among the items dealt with were the foll-owing:
Consideration was given to matters relating to the scientific
aspect of defence policy arising from the conclusions and recommendations
of the 1947 meeting at London of the British Commonwealth
Advisory Committee on Defence Science and from the first
report of the Defence Scientific Advisory Committee.
The progress of the joint United Kingdom-Australian long range
weapons project was considered.
Decisions were taken on the organization for the executive of
defence research and development.
" Another meeting of the council will be held next week at which
the progress of the defence programme will be reviewed, following
which a statement will be made by the Minister for Defence ( Mr.
Dedman) in Parliament." TRADE MARKS.
PROPOSED LEGISLATION.
On 20th April, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
The Attorney-General ( Dr. Evatt) reported to Cabinet to-day
that a licence by a proprietor of a trade mark to another to use the
trade mark on goods other than those of the proprietor of the trade
mark is a form of deception which invalidates the registration of the
mark. This rule applies when the proprietor of a mark owns and
controls the other party to whom the licence is given. Consequently,
a parent company cannot license a subsidiary company. In Britain,
legislation has been passed whereby a person, other than a proprietor
of a trade mark may be registered as a registered user of the mark.
Conditions of registration are laid down and provision is made against
I trafficking." Cabinet decided to-day that the Trade Marks Act should be amended
along the lines of the British Act to provide for permitted users of
trade marks and assignment of trade marks without assignment of
goodwill. It has been pointed out that many Australian companies
have subsidiary companies operating in different States, and if any of
these separate legal entities uses the registered trade mark of the
parent company the registration of the mark is invalidated. Further,
many overseas manufacturers desire to make arrangements with Australian
companies for the local manufacture of goods formierly manufactured
overseas and sold under well-known trade marks. The
proposed amendment of the act will help in the industrial development
of Australia and the establishment of new industries."

INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT.
BILL INTRODUCED.
In Parliament On 22nd April, 1948, the Minister for Agriculture
( Mr. Pollard) introduced the International Wheat Agreement Bill.
Mr. Pollard said-
The object of this bill is to ratify the international wheat agreement
drawn up in Washington in March, 1948, by the representatives
of the governments of 36 countries. The agreement is subject to
ratification, or formal acceptance, by the governments concerned by
1st July, 1948.
" At the outbreak of war in September, 1939, the f. o. b. Australian
export price of wheat was around 2s. Australian currency a bushel.
Some transactions took place at about is. 10d. a bushel at this time.
Two years previously the average f. o. b. price was around 5s., Australian
currency. For some years into the war, accumulated supplies and
harvests were such that prices rose very slowly. At the end of 1943
the Australian Wheat Board's export price was 4s. lid. bulk,
for sales west of Suez and 4s. 7td. for sales east of Suez. At the close
of the recent war there was a world-wide food shortage. There was
a delay in getting European wheat countries back into production.
Prices obtainable by exporters rose to record heights until in November,
1947, the price on the Chicago market for the shortest term futures
rose to 3 dollars 20 cents, the export equivalent for shipments from
Gulf of Mexico ports being 3 dollars 30 cents, or 20s. 9d. Australian.
At this time and for some weeks afterwards Australia was obtaining
19s. 6d. a bushel for its wheat. Later, the Australian Wheat Board
increased its price to 20s. 6d. a bushel.
It is difficult to say precisely what world prices are, and it is clear
that there is no world price in the pre-war sense. In normal times,
wheat was traded freely at exchanges in Winnipeg, Liverpool, the
Baltic, in London, and at Chicago and Minneapolis. Now Liverpool
and Winnipeg are closed, and Chicago and Minneapolis deal largely
with the huge American domestic consumption-a figure exceeding the
Canadian and Australian production put together. At the end of
January, 1948, when negotiations for the agreement opened, Canada
had a contract, entered into in 1946, to sell a substantial proportion of
its exportable surplus to Britain up to the end of July, 1950. The
price for deliveries during the year, 1st August, 19-17, to 31st July,
1948, was fixed at 1.55 dollars or 9s. 8d. Australian a bushel in store
Fort William/ Port Arthur. For deliveries during 1948-49, the price
is to be 2 dollars or 12s. 5d. Australian a bushel. In January, Canada
was selling to other countries at prices around 3.25 dollars-about
Å“ 1 Australian-a bushel, which were comparable with the United States
export price. Australia had negotiated contracts with Britain and
India for the sale of 105,000,000 bushels, at prices of 17s., equivalent
to about 2.7 dollars a bushel, in the case of Britain and of 18s. 6d.,
equivalent to about 3 dollars a bushel, in the case of India. The 
' Wheat Board's export price at the end of January was 20s. 6d. a bushel.
The Argentine was selling at about 5 dollars or over 30s. a bushel.
With all these varying prices, and with so little wheat being sold
on a freemarket, it is clearly unsound to refer to a ' world price
" A world price of course means competition between suppliers.
Now no competition exists. Where there is competition it must be
expressed in comparable * prices in the buying markets, whether these
prices are brought back to f. o. b. for quotation or left c. i. f. Where a
supplying country, Australia is an example, has one f. o. b. quote for all
countries it is evident that there is no world price, since it means that
each country is paying a different landed price for Australian wheat
because of the difference in cost of freight. The Chicago market has
been assumed by some to give world prices, but it is clear that this is
not so when Argentina can obtain prices much higher than the export
equivalent of the Chicago price. However, it can be said on the following
reasoning that Chicago prices give a good indication of the trend of
the market. Chicago prices, in the mnain, over a period are influenced
by the quantity of wheat the United States Government takes off the
domestic market. If a slackening in demand on American export wheat
reduces pressure on Chicago, prices fall there and American wheat for
export falls correspondingly. As soon as there is sufficient whea~ t
coming from other countries to cause an exporter to offer wheat in the
same market as America, competition will arise. A world price will
then he quotable, and in the different supplying countries quotes will
be based on competitive landed prices in importing countries.
" Following an exchange of views between their govern-ments,
officials of Argentina, Australia, Canada, the United States and
Britain met in Washington in July, 1941. A preliminary report was
submitted in August, 1941, in which the principles of acreage control,
price ranges and export quotas were again put forward. The Governmnents
agreed that their representatives should meet again to work over
the details of the proposed agreement. The conference was resumed in
October, 1941, and met at various dates up to April, 1942, when a
memorandum of agreement, to which was attached a draft convention,
was drawn up and accepted by the Governments of Australia, Argentina,
Canada, the United States and Britain. This memorandum indicated
agreement among the four principal exporters on quotas. On the basis
ef aggregate exports of 500,000,000 bushels, the percentages were,
Canada 40 px_ nt., Argentina 25 per cent., Australia 19 per cent.,
and United States 16 per cent.
From 1943 to 1946, frequent attempts were made to reach an
agreemient on price ranges for incorporation in an agreement for the
stabilization of trade during the war and early post-war years. The
stumbling block was a'lways the price ranges, Britain being unable to
mneet the views of the exporters. By 1943, the Australian Wheat Board
was in existence. It was constantly consulted by the department on
details. 
' I 26
" At the conference in London in March, 1947, it was made clear
that Argentina would not be a participant, and a new approach was
attempted, the new feature introduced -being guarantees by individual
importers to take specified-quantities. Though agreement was not
reacahed on all details, the principles stated in 1947 were used as the
basis of negotiations at the recent conference in Washington at which
full agreement was reached.
" The quantity of wheat covered by the agreement is 500,000,000
bushels, of which. Australia's share is 85,000,000. Australia is bound to
supply this quantity if it possibly can. If it cannot provide 85,000,0%,
bushels, the United States anid Canada wvill be first asked to make up the
discrepancy. If they cannot do so, then Australia is released from: its
obligations, provided that its failure is due to crop losses and is not due,
for example, to having made large sales outside the agreement. If
Australia has more than 85,000,000 bushels to sell, it may sell-additional
wheat outside the agreement, either to countries not in the agreement,
or by making increased sales to countries within the agreement. From
conversations not yet on a formal -basis, it is apparent that Britain
together with the colonies for which Britain has assumed responsibility
in thc agreement, will require more than the quantity provided for it in
the agreement-180,000,000 bushels. Some of this extra quantity will
certainly be drawn from Australia outside the agreement.
The 85,000,000 bushels is considered to be adequate. In fact, it
was not considered that Australia would be justified, under the terms: of
the agreement, in seeking a higher -figure. It is estimated that. this will
require an average harvest over the five years of about 170,000,000
bushels, and that an average of .180,000,000 bushels would not be an
embarrassment. In the first year of the agreement it is certain that
we will be able to sell all our excess over the 85,000,000, and it is
almost certain that we shall do so in the second year-August, 1949, to
July, 1950-and that we shall enter into the third year of the agreement
with a low carry-over. Even with heavy harvests, therefore, some
increase of carry-over in the later years of the agreement could be
accepted without difficulty.
" No provision is made in the agreement for restriction of production,
but if supplying countries produced more than their quota, and
other quantities they could sell outside the agreement, they might be
forced to limit output. However, it should not be necessary for Australia
to contemplate restriction of production during the course of the
agreement. " In selecting a price range many bases were considered,' but rather
early in the negotiations-in 1941-42, in fact-Canadian sales were
adopted as a basis, with equivalents to be worked out for Australian
and United States sales. Although this basis was reviewed at different
times, it was ultimately adopted. The views of Australia in regard to
the treatment of sales to ' nearly markets were accepted and given
effect in the formula set out ini the agreement. This formula means, in 
A. i? 27
effect, that in. sales for delivery to Britain when prices are at the top of
Sthe range, Australia will charge the same c. i. f. as Canada, subject to
any agreement for a difference on account of quality between Canadian
and Australian wheat. As freight between Australia and Britain is
greater than that between Canada and Britain, on the same c. i. f. price
Australia would get a lower f. o. b. return than Canada.. On present
freights, Canada would receive the maximum of 2 dollars or 12s.
Australian, and Australia would receive 12s. The same price would
apply to such European countries as Holland, Belgium and France.
We might call this category A.
" In the case of India, and the British purchases for delivery to
Ceylon and Malaya, the Canadian c. i. f. price would be much higher
than the Australian consequently, when the Canadian f. o. b.
equivalent was the basic price of 2 dollars ( 12s. the Australian
f. o. b. equivalent would be much higher-perhaps 14s. 5d. In this case,
under the agreed formula, Australia will charge 12s. 5d., the basic f. o. b.
maximum. Canada cannot compete in these ' nearby markets' because
its c. i. f. quote would be much higher than the c. i. f. equivalent of
Australia's 12s, 5d. Thus, in; sales to these countries Australia's maximum
f. o. b. price will be a straight conversion from the Canadian fLo. b.
to the same figure in Australian currency. This group of countries
might be called category B.
It follows that, over the whole of our exports, the return Australia
will get on exports under the agreement will depend on the proportion of
category A to category B. A fair estimate is one -third A and two-third
B. On present freight charges and rates of exchange, this would give
12s. 3d. as an equivalent of the 2 dollars. If a quality differential of,
say, 6d. were agreed to in the case of sales to Britain-there will -be no
quality differential for sales to nearby countries-the average would be
about 12s. In the case of the minimum, much the same principles will
apply, although in certain circumstances the Australian f. o. b. price
for sales to ' nearby markets' would come down to the minimum f. o. b.
price for sales to Britain.
" In the case of markets equidistant from Canada and Australia-
Shanghai for example, when Canada is shipping out of Vancouver-it
would be necessary for us to be able t&amp; come down to such a price in
order to compete with Canada on a c. i. f. basis in those markets. However,
where countries such as India, New Zealand, Java, Ceylon and
Malaya want wheat, or flour, they will naturally come to Australia for
it and pay the Canadian f. o. b. prices-converted, of course, to Australian
currency. Here, again, the actual minimum return overall
would depend on the proportions of the 85,000,000 bushels that go to the
different destinations. A fair estimate would be that, if prices fel
heavily and reached the minimum of 1 dollar 20 cents throughout the
fourth year, the average return would be about 7s., and that, if they
went to the minimum of I dollar 10 cents in the fifth year, the average
return would be about 6s. 4d. The calculations which have been used in
arriving at these figures are conservative. ' I
9! 
28
" Alterations of freight rates would affect sales in category A. If'
freights fell, our f. o. b. return would increase. If they rose, the reverse
would be the case. Alterations in exchange would also affect these
equivalents if such alterations affected the relationship between Australian
currency and the Canadian dollar. A special clause in the
agreement provides that, if the Canadian dollar depreciates on the
American dollar, there will be no change in the basic prices.
" There is no commitment under the agreement that wheat shall -bepreferred
to flour. In practice, Australian mills should be able to sell
their full output. The British allotment under the agreement covers
flour for Britain, Ceylon, Malaya and British commitments in respect
of other colonies. The Netherlands quota inceludes flour for the Netherlands
East Indies. These, with the requirements of the Pacific Islands,
should keep our mills going.
" It is true, of course, that in the first year Australian growers will
make a monetary sacrifice; they will receive less under the agreemient
than if there were no agreemeut. This position might obtain also in
the second year. It could even continue further. As time goes on,
however, the risks the grower takes with no assured minimum become.
greater. When the slump comes-and all close observers say it will
come sooner or later-the consumer will be the loser and the producer
will gain. But no one can say what the severity or duration of the
slump will be. Summed up, the agreement seems to strike a fair balance
between the early contributions of the producer and the later contributions
of the consumer. However, with heavy crops in all wheat
countries, it could be a real boon to the producer. To my mind, its real
service to the Australian wheat-grower is that it gives him security.
While enjoying good returns, he may look forward for five years-I
personally hope the agreement will be reniewed long before the expiration
of five years-with onlfidence-confidence that he will not have to
face disastrous price falls such as the wheat-growers of Australia have
experienced in past years." [ The bill wuas passed.

ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY.
AIRCRAFT CARRIERS.
In Parliament.-On 26th April, 1948, the Minister for the Navy
( Mr. Riord an) said-
The overall plan announced by the Minister for Defence ( Mr.
Dedman) on 4th June, 1947, envisaged the purchase by Australia of
two aircraft carriers. The first of these ships will be commissioned in
October, 1948, and will arrive in Australia early in 1949. The captain
and some of the senior officers have already left Australia for England,
where they arc doing certain courses. The remainder of the crew of
600 will leave Australia in May, 1948, on Kanimbla, and will undergo
certain training before the ship is commissioned. 
29
The Government still intends to Purchase the second aircraft car-
7-ier, which should be commissioned towards the end of 1949 or in 1950.
The reason why I cannot give any definite date at the moment is that
-the Australian Government is endeavouring to have these aircraft carriers
so constructed that they will be modern at the moment when they
are commissioned. That is one of the reasons why the first aircraft
carrier will not be commissioned on 24th June, 1948, as was first
thought possible. I am not able to give the date or even the month
when the second aircraft cardier will be commissioned, because modern
improvements are being effected while the ship is being constructed.
As to whether the armament will be obsolete, it was only recently
that an order was placed for the purchase of aircraft. The reason for
the delay was that the Australian Government wanted to be certain that
these ships would be equipped with the most efficient and up-to-date
aircraft available for service on a carrier. Jet-propelled aircraft may
be issued to the American navy some time this year. We are now
examining whether it is possible, even by a delay of a few months, to
secure jet-propelled aircraft for the two ships."

ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE.
RESERVE.
On 27th April, 1948, the Minister for Air ( Mr. Drakeford)
. announccd conditions of the Royal Australian Air Force Reserve as
follows: PERMANENT AIR FORCE RESERVE ( OR ACTIVE RESERVE).
To conmprise personnel immediately available for mobilization in an emergency
to bring existing unite to war strength * and to man additional units
required on the outbreak of war.
To be established, in the first instance, from personnel who have served dur-
Ing World War 11. and able and willing to undertake such annual or periodic
training as the Royal Australian Air Force might, from time to time, require.
In the initial stages, training to be confined to alectures, films, and distribution
of training pamphlets to be made available at centres. Subsequently, the reserve
to be maintained primarily from personnel completing engagements in the permanent
and citizen forces.
Conditions of service to be engagement for five years and further re-engagements
each of five years; applicants to volunteer for service andi be accepted
for enlistment in the reserve, to possess honorable discharges; to be medically
fit; and to report annually, notifying addresses or change of addresses, and
other particulars required.
Personnel appointed to the reservc to be appointed in the temporary rank
previously held.
Retirement from the reserve to be governed by the same retiring ages as
applicable to the permanent air force. 0
CITIZEN AIR FORCE RESERVE.
To consist of personnel possessing qualifications required for service in the
various branches of a modern air force.
To be constituted initially from trained personnel, including the Royal Australian
Air Force Nursing Service and the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air
Force who served. during World War II.
To be maintained partly fromi personnel trained in the active citizen air
force, and partly from persons in civil life possessing qualifications required
by the service. 
Personnel not to be obliged to undertake any form of annual training butto
be required to give an undertaking that, in the event of a national emergency,
their services to be readily available to the Royal Australian Air Force..
Conditions Of service to be: Volunteers with previous service to be entered
It in their last substantive or higaher temporary rank; no time qualification in
I regard-to service, and personnel might withdraw on giving due notice; personnel
to be retired at the equivalent retiring ages for the p~ rmanent force;
persons desiring to enrol must undertake to report for duty when called on
in an emergency.
H AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES.
DIRIECTOR-GENERAL OF MEDICAL SERVICES.
On 28th April, 1948, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Chambers)
announced that Dr. F. K. Norris had been appointed Director-General
of Medical Services. MIGRATION.
GOVERNMENT POLICY-BRITISH MIGRANTS.
On 29th April, 1948, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. Caiwell)
said-The ' open door' of Australia is no empty phrase when applied to
our kinsfolk from the British Isles. The Oovernment and the people
of Australia are determined to preserve the predominantly British
character of the Australian nation -by insisting that the highest possible
proportion of our population gain through immigration should be from
Britain. Australia's immigration figures for 1947 show that the number
of Britishers who came to Australia was twenty times as great as that
from the next highest source ( America), and three times as great as
that from all other world sources put together. Of 31,950 new arrivals
in 1947, Australia received 23,499 from Britain, 1,137 from the United
States, 843 from displaced persons camps in Europe, and 6,471 from
all other sources. This three to one overall ratio in favour of British
migrants will be maintained.
Would-be migrants in Britain may be assured that, wherever the
Australian Government has any influence in the allocation of berths on
ships ailing from Britain, no foreign national will be granted a passage
at the expense of a waiting Britisher. No ships that can be obtained
by the Australian Government will be allocated to the carriage of
non-British migrants while British migrants await transport."
RUSSIA.
EXCHANGE OF AMBASSADORS.
On 30th April, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt)
announced that the first Soviet Ambassador to Australia would be
Mr. N. M. ifanov and the first Australian Ambassador to Russia
would be Mr. A. Watt. The appointments wvere in accordance with 
the recent mutual agreement between the Australian and Soviet Governments
to raise the status of their legations at Canberra and Moscow
to that of embassies.
Similar exchanges had been agreed to with France and China and
when those appointments were completed, Australia would be represented
on an ambassadorial level in the countries of all permanent
members of the United Nations Security Council.
BRITISH COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS.
PROPOSED CONFERENCE.
In Parliament.-On 30th April, 1948, the Prime -Minister ( Mr.
Chifley) said-
No suggestion, either official or unofficial, has been made that a
conference of Empire Prime Ministers should be held. I realize, of
course, that on the economic side a very grave position has developed.
I realize how delicate is the position, and that it affects not only
Britain but ourselves and other countries with which Britain is associated.
It may be necessary for me or some other Minister conversant
with the economic aspects of the affairs of the Empire to visit London;
but no suggestion has yet * been received that such a visit should be
arranged.'' ( ror earlier reference, please see No. 134, page
SOCIAL SECURITY.
PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICE-MINISTER'S BROADCAST.
On 2nd May, 1948, the ' Minister for Health ( Senator Mc~ enna)
broadcast over the national network. Senator McKenna said-
" In 1947, the Government repealed acts of 1944 * and 1945, and
passed an entirely new act to enable pharmaceutical benefits to be
provided. Since then the Government has concluded discussions with
the Federal Council of the British Medical Association, the Federated
Pharmaceutical Service Guild, the Friendly Societies Dispensaries and
nearly all States.
Administrative arrangements bave been completed and regulations
under the act will come into force within the next few days. The
scheme will come into operation on 1st June, 1948.
The ' benefits are listed in the Commonwealth Pharmaceutical
formulary which will be published in book form. The Government
had at its disposal in the preparation of the formulary the best specialist
advice from the medical, pharmaceutical and pharmacological fields.
The benefits in-clude such modern drugs as those of the ' sulpha' group,
preparations of penicillin, vaccines, serums, anti-toxins and other
biological products such as insulin, The range of medication covered
by the. formulary includes preparations. nder more than 40 headings
ranging from ear, eye and nose drops to, children's requirements, 
32
vit-amin solutions and sundry medical materials and applications..
Altogether, about 600 items are listed in formulary, but this gives
no idea of its scope since provision has been made for ingredients of
formulae to be omitted, reduced and in some cases increased. Provision
has been-made for certain drugs to be added to mixtures and.
other preparations. These provisions give great flexibility to the
formulary and permit of so many variations as to extend its range to.
hundreds of thousands of prescriptions.
" These benefits can be made available only on ' a prescription
written by a registered medical practitioner. The Government feels
that, having regard to the high standards of the medical profession,.
the risk of unnecessary prescribing is negligible. This arrangement
will provide a safeguard against unnecessary demands from patients,.
since they must consult their doctors as a preliminary to receipt of
pharmaceutical benefits.
There is no compulsion of any kind upon a doctor to co-operate
in the scheme. ' When a doctor does take part he is not bound in any
way to confine his prescribing to the formulary. If there should be
some particular drug or compound which he considers more appropriate
to, his patient's need than any contained in the formulary then he
will of course prescribe it, but in that case the patient himself must
pay for the prescription, the Government accepting full responsibility
for its omission from the formulary.
After a doctor has studied the contents of the formulary and its
flexibility I am sure that his decision regarding co-operation in the
scheme will be determined by his medical judgment, his humanity
and his good citzenship, and by no other consideration.
The act provides for the establishment of a formulary committee.
Its function will be to advise on the revision of the formuilary in the
light of experience, and of the latest developments in medical science.
The Government provided in the 1947 act, at the request of the Federal
Council of the British Medical Association, that the personnel of this
committee should be predominantly medical in character. This constitutes
one of the important points of difference between the original
scheme and the one now about to be launched.
" A second point of difference lies in the fact that whereas in the.
1944 scheme a penalty in the form of a fine, in default three months"
imprisonment, was imposed for doctors who prescribed unnecessarily,
this provision was wholly omitted from the 1947 act. This was done
at the request of the Federal Council of the British Medical Association.
The regulations embody a code specifying what constitutes proper
prescribing., This is based on a code submitted by the council. No
penalty or sanction whatsoever for -breach of the code has been provided.
The Government places its trust in the honour of the profession to
observe the code and has intimated to the council that should theconduct
of some few medical practitioners demonstrate the need for
something of that nature it wvill consult the council as to the form of'
sanction that would be appropriate. 
33
" The patient's part in the scheme is very simple. Where his
-doctor prescribes a pharmaceutical benefit he will hand the prescriptionto
the patient in duplicate. The patient will then take the prescription
to any approved chemist or approved friendly society dispensary. He
will hand both copies -of the prescription to the pharmacist who will
supply the benefit without charge to the patient. ' Where the doctor has
ordered a prescription to be repeated, the patient will still hand both
copies of the prescription to the pharmacist who, in addition to supplying
the benefit will hand to him a repeat authorization form with the
duplicate of the prescription; these documents will enable him to
secure a repeat supply of the benefit from any -approved pharmacist.
" In chronic cases, for instance in the case of diabetics who are in
constant need of insulin, a doctor may, at one consultation, prescribe a
supply that will be adequate for up to 91 da~ a.
Special provision has also been made to meet the plight of persons
living in outback areas beyond the reach of the dispensing doctor or
chemist. " A doctor may prescribe a benefit without a Commonwealth form
in any case of emergency -but is required to supply the prescription
on -a proper form at a later date to enable the chemist supplying the
benefit to collect payment from the Commonwealth.
" Where a chemist is asked to d * ispense a prescription after usual
trading hours he is entitled to payement from the patient of a late
fee of is. In the case of a prescription endorsed by a doctor as urgent'I
the chemist is obliged to supply the benefit as soon as practicable
provided the prescription is presented at the premises of the approved
* chemist. Should it be necessary for the chemist to deliver any pharmaceutical
benefit he may make a charge equal to the actual cost of the
delivery. There is a prohibition against any doctor, chemist or hospital
dispenser parting with possession of or destroying any of the official
forms or publications issued to him except in accordance with the act.
As these documents are the basis of entitlement to receipt of and
payment for costly and dangerous drugs, this provision is essential for
the security of the community and for the proper protection of Commonwealth
funds.
All medicines needed by a patient occupying a public' bed in a
public ward are already provided for under the Commonwealth Hospital
Benefits Scheme and do not come within the ambit of the act.
Provision is being made by arrangement with the various States so
that out-patients will receive pharmaceutical benefits without cha rge
when the scheme comes into operation. Special arrangements will be
made to meet the needs of patients in private hospitals or in inter-
-mediate and private wards of public hospitals. These arrangements
will vary according to whether the hospital has or has not a pharmacist
on its premises."~

On 4th May, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" Cabinet to-day decided that the Australian Broadcasting Commission
be authorized to spend, during the three months ending September
1948, an amount equivalent to an amount on the same basis as
during the current financial year plus such inescapable expenditure as
would enable the Commission to meet additional costs to which it is
, tready committed and other expenses of an essential nature.
" The Cabinet sub-committee appointed to consider conclusions
reached by a committee of which Mr. A. A. Fitzgerald was chairman on
a long-range plan for financing the commission has not yet completed
its deliberations." FIGHTING FORCES.
WAR SERVICE MORATORIUM-EXTENSION.
On 4th May, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" A discharged member of the forces remains a ' protected person'
for three years after being discharged or ceasing to -be engaged on war
service. The protection of female dependants and parents of discharged
members of the forces also exists for a similar period of three years.
The period was originally six months but was increased from time to
time so that it is now three years.. In many cases the three years'
period from discharge has recently expired or will expire in the near
future, and, unless the period is extended, there may be a considerable
number of evictions of ex-servicemen.
" The Re-establishment and Employment Act provides that land
owned by a member of the forces shall not be required compulsorily
without the prior consent of the Attorney-General. The Act provided
that the protection afforded should continue for a period of twelve
months after the date of discharge of the number or the period of the
length of the member's service whichever was the shorter period. As a
result of representations made last year by various organizations of
ex-servicemen, the period of twelve months was extended to two years,
so that ex-servi-cemen might not be deprived of land on which they
L_ 2 
hoped to , build homes. In view of the present building difficulties, the
Direetor , of the Legal Service Bureau has expressed the opinion that it
is desirable to extend the period of protection . from two years to three
years. Representations have also been made by organizations of exservicemen
to the same effect.
Cabinet to-day decided that the period of protection under the
War Service Moratorium Regulations to discharged members of the
forces and -their dependants be extended from three years to four years;
and that the period of protection under the Re-establishment and
Employment Act to discharged members of the Forces be extended from
two years to four years." SERVICE -PAY RATES.
PERMANENT FORCES-RETIREMENT SCHEME, BILL
INTRODUCED.
In Parliament.--On 5th . May, 1948, the Minister for Defence :( Mr.
D. edman) introduced the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Bill. Mr.
Dedman said-
The bill proposes to establish a scheme for improved retirement
benefits on a uniform basis for members of the Permanent Defence
Forces. The existing provisions for retirement benefits -are deficient.
In particular, they lack uniformity as between the three services. ' This
is no longer justifiable since comparable standards of pay and -service
conditions have been provided for all three services. Moreover, it
would be impossible under the existing retirement provision to deal
adequately with the peculiarly difficult problem created by the practice,
now common to all services, of retirement at comparatively early ages.
Early retirement of members of the forces has been made necessary by
the requirements of a modern defence system. It is now the rule in the
British armed forces and the other British Commonwealth countries.
In view of our special needs for defence forces of the highest efficiency
under conditions of present warfare, we cannot afford to lag behind in
this vital matter.
Nevertheless, the practice creates a problem which is intensely
human, and has an important practical bearing on our ability to recruit
and retain men of the requisite calibre for the services. The practice
means that men will in many cases come to the end of their service
careers while still in the early middle years of their lives. In the Air
Force, retirement of officers commence at the age of 41, in the Navy, at
the age of 45 and, in the Army, at the age of 47. Men who leave the
services at such ages have before them the acute personal problem of
finding new occupations in civil life. Since the exigencies of the defence
system impose these conditions of retirement, the Government has a
clear obligation to provide a special scheme of retiring benefits, which
should be sufficient to tide the member over the period of readjustment
and to supplement substantially his earnings in his civil occupation.
Similar considerations apply into a perhaps somewhat lesser degree to ii 
S 36
I: men who retire from more senior service positions at a rather higher
but still relatively early age. On the practical side, it has to be
considered that unless provision of this kind is made, the prospect of
early retirement will act as a discouragement to men contemplating
careers in the services.
" I outline existing retirement provisions for the forces. Naval
personnel are credited with deferred pay, payable on the retirement
of the member, or to his estate if death occurs during service. For
officers serving to the full retiring age of their ranks, the cumulative
deferred pay would amount to approximately Å“ 4,000 for lieutenantcommanders
rising to approximately Å“ 6,500 for captains. Permanent
personnel of Army are contributors to the Commonwealth Superannuation
Fund and have the same pension cover for themselves and their
dependants as have members of the Commonwealth Public Serv-ice.
" Before the amendment of the Superannuation Act in 1947, the
maximum pension obtainable by any officer at the age of 60 was Å“ 416
per annum. Under the amendments to the Superannuation Act, there
was a general increase by 23 per cent. of the pensions of all officers and
other ranks, and officers were enabled, according to their rate of salary,
to contribute for a muaximum. pension of Å“ 345 per annum at the age of
The general effect was that 60 per cent. -of the cost of all pensions
would he provided by the Commonwealth. The Air Force provisions
are not in line with those of either the Navy or the Army. Permanent
Air Force personnel -below officer rank are contributors to the Superannuation
Fund under -conditions similar to those obtaining in the Army.
Air Force officers contribute to the Superannuation Fund to provide
for benefits on death or invalidity during service. The major retirement
provision for these officers is a system of deferred pay which is a
benefit paid to the member on retirement or to his estate if death occurs
during service. The rates of deferred pay are substantially less than
those of Naval personnel of equivalent rank. The review of these
provisions led to the following conclusions-
First-Wide disparities exist between the different schemes.
Secondly-In view of the recent red uction of retiring ages for Army officers
from 55 or 60 to ages ranging fioin 47 years upwards, and even lower retiring
ages in the other services, it is necessary to provide a scheme of pension for
retirements at age 40 or later.
Thirdly-A deferred pay scheme makes inadequate provision for the officer
or his dependants in the event of death or invalidity in the early stage of his
career. Fourtbly-Payn~ ent of deferred pay in a lunmp suni on retirement may lead
to an unwise or unfortunate investment resulting-in the loss of the retirement
benefit. Fifthly-Now that comparable ranks in each service receive generally the
same rates of pay and allowances, it is most desirable that a uniform system of
retirement benefits for all services should be adopted.
" An exhaustive investigation of all aspects of the problem was
made, and recommendations subscribed to by representatives of the
I. three service boards form the basis of the bill. 
IIÅ“ 3; The bi provides for a scale o: f pensions to officers rising from
annum for majors, and equivalent ranks in the other services,
up to a maximum of Å“ 845 per annum. for lieutenant-generals, and equivalent
ranks in the other services, who serve until retirement at age
The maximum pension of Å“ 845 is also the maximum pension payable
to a member of the Commonwealth Public Service.
" The pension provision in the case of other ranks is based on
twenty years' service after the age 0f twenty, and the rates range from
per annum for able seamen, private or aircraftman, 1st class, to
Å“ 155 per annuma for a chief artificer, warrant officer 1. ( Army) or
warrant officer ( Air). For service beyond twenty years, the annual
rate of pension increases by Å“ 6 to Å“ 8 for each additional year of completed
service. Provision is made in the bill for the payment of a half
pension to the widow, and allowances to the children, on lines similar to
the Superannuation Act. After retirement of the member, the rate
of widows' pension is related to the pension previously payable to the
ex-member. " The existing deferred pay and superannuation schemes cover only
permanent members of the forces. This bill extends pension benefits to
personnel on long-term engagements. Those who do not serve for a
sufficient period to qualify for a pension will be entitled to a refund
of their contributions if their period of service is less than ten years,
although throughout this period they will be covered against death
or invalidity. Where the term of service is in excess of ten years, but
less than twenty years, the member will be entitled to a refund of his
contribution, -plus a gratuity equal to one and a half times the amount
he has contributed. Provision has been made for certain officers who,
because of their late age on entry, cannot complete twenty years' service
for pension before reaching the retiring age for the rank held, to receive
a pension on a reduced scale after the completion of fifteen years' service.
" Naval, Army and Air Force cadets, and all personnel under the
age of eighteen years, will be covered ' by the scheme, but will not be
required to contribute to the fund until attaining the age of eighteen
years. They will not be pensionable until reaching the age of 40 years.
" The existing deferred pay entitlements of Naval and Air Force
members presented particularly difficult problems. These have been
met by granting these members the option to become contributors to
the Defence Forces Retirement Fund, or, alternatively, to retain their
existing rights. The deferred pay of those members who elect to
Ibecome contributors to the fund will be transferred to the new fund
to be established under this act, and the amount so transferred will be
used to reduce their future contributions for pension entitlement. Army
personnel, who are contributors under the Superannuation Act, will be
transferred to the new defence forces retirement scheme on the same
trms and conditions as regard benefits and contibutions as those to
which they are entitled under the Superannuation Act. The reserve
values held on their behalf will be transferred from the Superannuation
Fund to the new fund, and will be available to meet part of the cost 
38
of the benefits they will ultimately receive. The contributions of memhbers
of the services will be precisely the same as in the case of the Commonwealth
Public Scrvice, and relate to a member'sa rate of pay, and
the age at which he becomes a contributor or obtains pay increases.
" To finance a scale of pensions such as is proposed for early retirements
in the defence forces wvill entail a much greater government contribution
than in the case of the Commonwealth Public Service superannuation
scheme,' where retirements occur at age 60 or 65. The subsidy
under the Superannuation Fund, namely, 60 per cent. of the cost
of pensions, is inadequate for the retirement fund. On the average,
because of early retirement benefits, the Commonwealth will have to
pay much more than 60 per cent., but because of the impossibility of
forecasting retirement rates, no precise statement can be made of what
the percentage is likely to be. The Commonwealth undertakes to meet
the deficiency between the value of benfits payable and the accumulated
value of the members' contributions. The method followed is similar
to that under the Superannuation Fund. The Commonwealth meets its
liability in respect of each payment of pension or gratuity as it arises.
" No precise information is at present available as to the ultimate
cost of the defence forces retirement scheme, but, based on the present
approved strength of the forces, it is estimated that the annual commitment
may reach Å“ 2,000,000 in fifteen years' time, and increase comparatively
slowly thereafter. This commitment is much in excess of the
present liability of the Commonwealth in respect of deferred pay andl
superannuation for the forces.
" Provision is made to establish a defence forces retiremeut fund,
administered by a board comprised of the president of the Commonwealth
Superannuation Fund, the Commonwealth Actuary, a representative
of the Treasury, and one from each of the three services. They
will hold office for two years.
" The bill provides for the control and investmnent of the fund under
the direction of the board along lines similar to those provided in the
Superannuation Act. It also -provides that the fund shall be audited
by the Commonwealth Auditor-General; that it shall be valued by the
Commonwealth Actuary every five years, and that the annual report
of the board's operations and a statement of accounts shall be published.
[ The bit was passed.

CONSTITUTION.
AMENDMENT-REFERENDUM, PRICES.
On 10th May, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) broadcast
over the national network. Mr. Chifley said-
Fellow citizens,
On Saturday, 29th May, you will be asked to record a simple vote,
either Yes or No at a referendum to indicate whether the Australian
Constitution should be amended to give the Commonwealth Parliament
power to control rents and prices ( including charges).
It is my purp ose to-night to put to you squarely the matter which
you should take into consideration when making your decision.
This is not a matter of politics. This is a matter which affects your
pocket and the welfare of the people and, particularly, of the less
favoured section of the people.
First I will tell you why this referendum is being taken and, secondly,
1 will indicate why the Government thinks that the only efficient method
of operating price control is through the Federal % Government on a
uniform'basis. Thirdly, Il will give you an indication of what I believe
will happen if this referendum is not carried and it is held that the
Commonwealth Government cannot exercise price control.
As you know, price control was first exercised under the compelling
necessity of war and the power was, and is still, exercised uinder the
Defence powers of the Commonwealth. Price control was introduced
because it was realized that rapidly rising prices would throw our
economy completely out of gear and reduce our capacity to make a full
war effort. Price control was then, and is now, a brake on inflation.
The power, as I have mentioned, was exercised under the Defence
power. That power is liable, because the war has ended, to be successfully
challenged. Should such a successful challenge be made, the
whole price-fixing structure would vanish and the people would imme.-
diately be at the mercy of those who are prepared to charge any price
for goods in short supply. To say that the States could pick up the
task of fixing prices is a deliberate attempt to mislead you. The States
have neither the staff, the experience, nor the machinery to undertake
this task. In fact, only two have legislation on the subject.
It was realized after the cessation of hostilities that the price firing
power which was operated under Commonwealth control could be in
danger. Consultations were held with the State Premiers-comp rising both
Labour and conservative Premiers. They agreed unanimously that it
was necessary to continue ' price control. They were anxious to avoid
the ' boom and bust' policy which followed World War IL and which
caused so much unemployment, misery, hardship and degradation in
this country. 
In 1946, the Premiers unanimously agreed-subject to their parliaments'
concurrence-to pass legislation which would enable price control
powers to be exercised -by the Commonwealth Government for as long
as shortages of commodities persisted. But hostile legislative councils--
bodies not elected by the people--blocked that effort in some of the
States. Here, briefly, is what h-appened to the Economic Stability
Bill in the various State parliaments-
New South Wales.-The act expires on 31st December next.
Victoria.-The act expired last June, the Legislativ-e Council refusing to
extend it past then.
Queensland-The act continues until a date to be proclaimed.
South Australia.-The act expired l-ast December.
Western Australia.-The act expires next December.
Tasmania-The act expires next month, the Legislative Council refusing to
extend it beyond then.
Without the concurrence of all State parliaments the promise was
nullified. The Queensland and New South Wales Governments were
prepared to give effect to this promise. I believe all the Premiers
were prepared to carry out the promise they made but in some States
the parliaments refused to endorse the promise. Had the States done
their job and provided you with complete insurance -against rising
prices and the grave danger of inflation there would have been no
need for a referendum. Having-tried to give you protection in that
way and failed, the Commonwealth Government is now faced with the
national responsibility of asking you to give it the power to protect
your interest and the national economy.
H I now-come to the second point. Any intelligent Australian will
realize that price control must be operated on a Commonwealth basis
if there is to be uniformity. To have six price-fixing authorities fixing
prices on goods that are manufactured in one State and distributed
into all the other States must appear to any thinking person as
ludicrous. No effective control of prices can be exercised on prices
of goods by a State when those goods have been brought from another
State. A State would have no powver to investigate the cost of producing
such goods. Here is another instance. If one State did not fix the
price of a commodity in its cown State, any other State into which
such a type of goods was sent would not have any guide as to what
price should be fixed.
I have already mentioned that, apart from this difficulty, the States
have neither the experience nor the machinery to undertake the task.
My third point is that if this referendum is not carried and the
power now carried on under the Defence Power is successfully challenged,
there can only be one result-inflationary prices and immediate
demands -by workers for increased wages to overtake the increased cost
of living. And out of all that would he chaos.
There is another aspect of price control I place before you-an
aspect vital in maintaining a stable economy. Without price control
the Commonwealth Government could not continue fully its system
of subsidies that is keeping down the price of a wide range of everyday
commodities. The Commonwealth meets part of the cost of every 
pound of butter, tea, potatoes and of every pint of milk purchased by
the Australian consumer. The price of all Australian made woollen
goads and most other items of clothing is much lower because of these
subsidies. I give yrou a few examples of what these consumer subsidies mean
to the family budget and living costs generally. If the Commonwealth
Government were forced to abandon its subsidy plan, the price of tea
would overnight rise by 2s. 6d. to 5s. 3d. per lb.; butter would go up
by Sid. per lb.; milk by Jd. a quart and the price of potatoes would
nearly double. An ordinary three-piece suit would cost another
shoes would go up by 2s. a pair and those who prefer kid shoes would
have to pay 6s. more a pair.
The subsidy of Å“ 5,500,000 being paid on textiles other than wool is
saving consumers about Å“ 8,000,000 a year on their clothing bill.-
The farmer would have to pay nearly 50 per cent. more for his
superphosphate. The Commonwealth Government is also paying subsidies on such
items as coal -and coastal shipping freights. These are indirectly
keeping down living costs.
At present the Commonwealth is spending about Å“ 40,000,000 a year
on these consumer subsidies. The Government has announced that its
object is to remove or reduce many of these subsidies when circumnstances
permit, but in a world of great economic difficulty and inflated
prices, they are being retained for the time being to ease the burden
of consumers. People must realize, however, that if the Commonwealth's power
to control prices failed many of these subsidies would have to be
terminated. The Commonwealth could scarcely accept a position in
which State -authorities had control over the factors which determined
the effectiveness or otherwise of Commonwealth subsidies costing more
than Å“ C40,000,000 a year.
Some -opponents of the Commonwealth's request that -you vote ' yes'
on May 29th, try to make you believe that the States can themselves
do the job when the Commonwealth's war-time powers run out.
Any wise Australian will realize very quickly that price control
must -be exercised on a Commonwealth-wide basis and could not be
carried out effectively by individual States with separate and differing
systems. As to the catch-cry about Canberra bureaucrats', Commonwealth
price control is decentralized to such a degree that 90 per cent, of the
decisions are made in the States; the whole work being co-ordinated
by the Prices Commissioner at Canberra, where only 12 per cent. of the
total prices staff is stationed. As a matter of interest, Commonwealth
price control costs each Australian exactly one half-penny a week.
I turn now to give you a warning-a warning of what can happen
if Commonwealth control of prices ends. Unhappily, we have a firsthand
example in what has occurred in the United States. 
42
I will now give you a picture in figures of what has happened since
V. P. Day. In Australia, the price rise has gone from 22.86 per cent.
on V. P. Day to 86 per cent, to-day. In Britain, where price control is
maintained, the increase has been only from 80.4 per cent. on V. P.
Day to 33.3 per cent. in December, 1947. But in Canada, where
considerable decontrol has -been forced by the proximity of the United
States, the rise has been from 19 per cent, to 42 per cent., and in
the United States from 30 per cent. to the astonishing figure of 66
per cent. Here is what happened in the United States:
Price control, which had been effectively handled during the war
years, was extended until 30th June, 1946. A clamnour was set up to
abolish the system. President Truman decided to lift price control.
In the following 25 days, food prices rose by 25 per cent!
The President put controls back on July 25th, 1946, but pressure
groups maintained their activity and in the following November all
controls were lifted except those on rents, sugar and rice. Some of the
actual price rises since price control lapsed are roast beef from 2s. 1d.
per lb. to 4s. 2d. butter from 3s. 10d. per lb. to 5s. Sjd. cheese froin
2s. 7d. per lb. to 4s. id.; -bacon from 2s. 7d. per lb. to 4s9. 1id.; eggs
from 2s. lid, to 4s. 2d. a dozen.
Food prices in the United States in December last year were 118
per cent. higher than in September, 1930-more than double.
In this talk, I have explained why the referendum on 29th May
became necessary. I have shown that the States cannot, of themselves,
provide Australia with an efficient system. The dangers confronting
Australia have been clearly put to yrou.
I now give you the same assurance as was given to the Australian
Parliament when the bill to enable this referendum to be held was
introduced in November last. The Government does not consider that
it will be necessary to operate price control indefinitely, or to operate
it in the detailed arid complete form to which we have become
accustomed in recent years. Price control is that form is necessary
only in a period of general excess of demand over supply; a condition
which is being steadily removed. As shortages disappear, so can price
control disappear until it will become a reserve power, operating only
when and where it is for the well-being of the national economy.
It would -be utterly impossible for the Federal Government, once
given this direct power to control prices, to use that power to socialize
anything-as is being alleged by anti-price control elements, flow
could price control be used to socialize industry? Only by fixing unpayable
prices which would drive private enterprise out of production.
What then? The Commonwealth Government cannot, under the Constitution,
operate any form of primary or secondary production, except
such things * as munitions and uniforms for its own use. It cannot
engage generally in wholesale or retail trading. 
43
So far, in this talk with you, I have dealt almost entirely with
prices as such. Included in the question upon which you are asked to
vote Yes or No on 29th May, is Commonwealth control of rents
and charges.
The power over rents would cover the fixing or pegging of rents
and would include power to provide for the determination of fair
rents and to protect tenants against eviction.
The power would -also apply to rents of goods as well as rents of
land and buildings. It would enable the Commonwealth Parliament
to control and regulate the prices at which property of any kind, including
commodities, are sold.
Charges are specifically mentioned as included in prices to remove
any doubt about charges which are in the nature of prices or rents, but,
in relation to which, the term prices " or " rent may not be
ordinarily used. Examples are the charges for hairdressing or for
board and lodging. Another example would be the charges for the
use of money, or in other wards, interest.
It may be said that the State Governments could control rents.
But it is unlikely that the States would do so at the same time and in
the same way. That was the case after World War I. Under Commonwealth
control, rents rose only 1 per cent. between 1914 and 1918.
But after World War I. ended and Commonwealth control ceased,
rents went up by nearly 50 per cent. -between 1918 and 1929. The
States did not control rents then and it is dangerous to risk another
failure by the States now.
In any event, if rents were allowed to rise in one State, but not in
others, wages would rise in that State above the general level. With
wages, many other costs and prices would rise as well. As a result, the
whole Australian economy would be thrown off balance. In practical
terms, in safe terms, unified control of rents can be secured only
through the Commonwealth Parliament.
I will deal with one other misleading argument advanced by
opponents of a Yes vote on 29th May. It is claimed that, if the
referendum is carried, the Commonwealth would have power to fix
wages and to conscript labour.
The simple answer to that argument is that the Commonwealth has
no industrial power under the Constitution and there is no possibility
whatever that the High Court would regard power over prices
as a power to regulate wages and employment.
Throughout this talk, I have stressed that this. is a simple issue,
arising because of the simple fact that the State Parliaments failed to
carry out the Premiers' undertakings. This is not even a political
issue. Party politics do not enter into it. The State Premiers who
gave the undertaking I have mentioned were a mixture of Labour
and anti-Labour leaders. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Menzies), 
Ar
it .44
who is leader of the Liberal party in the Commonwealth Parliament,
is pledged to Commonwealth control of prices. Here is what he said
in giving you his policy at the last Commonwealth elections-
We shall unhesitatingly maintain price control as a means of preventing
inflation during the period in which production is inadequate to meet the demand
for goods which arises from the enormously increased purchasing power of the
people. Mr. Menzies went on to say-
Leot me, speaking for the government which introduced price control within
a week of the outbreak of war, give the lie to those whisperers who tell you that
a Liberal victory will mean an upward leap -in prices. We stand for con-trolled
prices. I make those two quotations to show you that Mr. Menzies and the
Government are of one and the same mind on this question.
I sound one warning note before closing. In the world to-day
peace has yet to be won. The awful cost of war has not yet been aii
The democracies face enormous problems; the peoples of the world who
gave their all to win a little happiness, a better way of life, face grim
prospects. Britain poured out all she had in a war to the bitter end.
To-day, her economic wounds are still bleeding. Australia is determined
to play her part as a member of the British Commonwealth
in the economic struggle now going on. Australia cannot carry out
her part if she be weakened internally. A breakdown in the Australian
economy would be another setback for Britain. I ask you to maintain
Australia's economic stability. I ask you to vote Yes" on 29th May
for your security; for the economic welfare of yourself and your
children.

PEACE.
GERMANY-BERLIN POSITION.
On 6th July, 1948, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr. Evatt)
said that following the cutting off by the Soviet authorities of all surface
methods of-supplying Allied occupation forces and the German population
in the three western sectors of Berlin, the British, United States
and French Governments, in their determined employment of emergency
supply measures, were protecting their undoubted juridical rights.
4738.-2. 
The presence of occupation forces in Berlin was clearly authorize'd
by the agreement of 1944 nominating Berlin as the centre of Allied
control of Germany and setting up machinery for Allied government
of the city. The agreement had been subsequently amended to provide
for the participation of France and had been made public in joint
four-power statements issued with the declaration on the surrender of
Germany, on 5th June, 1945. The agreement became operative before
the Potsdam Agreement, so that the Soviet contention that the western
powers have brought four-power control to an end by violating thr.
Potsdam Agreement was clearly inadmissible. In the interests of world
peace, it was hoped that all outstanding matters affecting Berlin would
soon be discussed between the western powers and the Soviet Union,
but no permanent easing of tension could result unless the Soviet Union
recognized clearly and unequivocally the undoubted occupation rights of
the western Allies. These had been hardly won in the common struggle
against Hitler and could not be set aside or nullified by unilateral acts.
On llth July, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said*-
It is unthinkable that the western Allies should do other than hold
on in Berlin. There is no question that Australia supports the westerii
Allies." On 18th July, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
I went to Berlin to gather some real background information of the
position. The British Foreign Secretary ( Mr. Bevin) thought it
highly desirable for me to get the atmosphere of the position and to
talk to German trade union and political leaders.
" I have nothing more to say on the Berlin position than what I
said when I was there-that for the western powers to take any other
stand was unthinkable."
GERMANY-BERLIN POSITION, AIR LIFT.
On 2nd August, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
Cabinet decided to-day to offer to the British Government the
use of ten Douglas Dakota aircraft to assist in the air lift to Berlin, if
required. If the offer is accepted, the ' planes will be flown by Royal Australian
Air Force crews to Britain, where the uses to which the aircraft
are put will be determined by the British authorities."
ITALY-TREATY, RATIFICATION.
On 12th July, 1948, Dr. Evatt announced that the Australian instrunment
of ratification of the peace treaty with Italy had been deposited
on 9th July, 1948, and the state of war between Australia and Italy had
ended as from that day. At Berlin. 
ROUMANIA, BULGARIA, HUNGARY, FINLAND-TREATIES,
RATIFICATION.
On 13th July, 1948, Dr. Evatt said that the Australian instruments
of ratification of the peace treaties with Roumania, Bulgaria, Hungary
and Finland had been deposited on 10th July, 1948, and the state of war
between Australia and those countries had ended as from that day.
JAPAN-MINISTER'S STATEMENT, JULY, 1948.
On 22nd July, 1948, Dr. Evatt said-
It is becoming evident that peace and stability in the Pacific and
in Asia will be attainable only so far as there is peace and stability in
Europe. The problem is not regional, it is global. The situation in
Berlin and Europe generally, where there is an acute dispute between
Russia on the one hand and the western democracies on the other, must
have a direct effect in delaying any peace settlement with Japan.
Australia's concern in the European situation is direct and vital.
Certainly no peace will endure unless it is based on justice and
reached by free agreement in accordance with the principles of the
United Nations Charter. The next meeting of the United Nations may
well become a turning point in world history. I am hopeful that the
Assembly will bring public opinion to bear on both political and
economic aspects of international disputes and so contribute to the
prevention of a third world war."
EXTERNAL TERRITORIES.
PAPUA-NEW GUINEA-COPRA.
On 7th July, 1948, the Minister for External Territories ( Mr.
Ward) announced that the Australian New Guinea Production Control
Board would relinquish control of marketing the Territory of Papua-
New Guinea production of copra. The present rate of production of
copra, over 40,000 tons a year, was about two-thirds of the potential
output of the remaining coconut plantations and groves of the territory
and negotiations were in course with traders in the territory to secure
an orderly changeover of marketing activities under a system of export
licences. The board, which was established during the war to secure
from the territories the maximum possible produciton of copra and
other tropical produce, would then wind up its affairs.
BRITISH COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS.
CO-OPERATION-PROPOSED SECRETARIAT.
On 8th July, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said*-
" Suggestions have been made for the establishment of a British
Commonwealth of Nations Secretariat hut there is no evidence at present
of anything of a concrete character."

PRIME MINISTER'S BROADCAST.
On 12th July, 1948, Mr. Chifley broadcast over the British Broadcasting
Corporation and Australian Broadcasting Commission networks.
Mr. Chifley said-
Good evening. I speak to-night to the people of Great Britain, to
my own people in Australia and to listeners in the Pacific and North
American areas.
We live in difficult times, the world is suffering an uneasy peace.
I have just returned from Berlin where I went so that I might get a
first-hand picture of a very difficult position. Economic and political
problems of a character never before encountered in our history have
to be faced daily. There is little respite from them. But we are a
sturdy race. Our Comnionwealth is composed of very determined
people. If I needed any reminder of that fact, I have only to look at
what the people of Britain have suffered and are suffering and what
they are doing to lift themselves up towards a happier way of life.
During the past week I have had the opportunity of talking with
the British Prime Minister ( Mr. Attlee) and a number of his Ministers.
It is natural that the British people are wondering what will be the
outcome of the talks, while my own people at home will be interested to
know what tasks lie ahead of them. My mission here at London,
primarily, was economic. But I have also had more than one talk
with the Foreign Minister ( Mr. Bevin) from whom I have obtained a
very full picture of the world scene. I aim having talks with the
Minister of Defence and with the Service Ministers.
Perhaps I can best sum up my objective in coming to London
in a sentence: I want to obtain, and to give, a clear understanding of
the economic difficulties that confront the people of Britain and Au.-
tralia. We want to determine, as well as circumstances will permit,
our joint policies for the future.
" I say to my own people that the path is not easy, that the going
is hard and will continue to be hard. Sir Stafford Cripps said last
week that Britain was running into debt on her overseas trade to the
tune of more than a million pounds for every working day. Australians
know that our future is linked with Britain, not only hy ties of rnee
and kinship, but because of hard, practical reasons.
Tl'hre is a bond of gratitude between Britain and Australia
because of the gallant part played by Britain in the war and in the
post-war struggle to re-establish herself, and, at the same time, to assist
others. The next three years may very well be the most crucial in the
history of the British peoples. The key to the situation lies in production
and I say to every Australian that hard work is not only a national
duty but a stern responsibility if we are all to survive.
" I am not being alarmist. I have the advantage of knowing not
some of the facts, but all the facts. I have talked with the best brains
in Britain; men who devote day and night to the task.
I 
The Australian people have had imposed on them severe restrictions
in order that the use of dollars should be reduced. The Australian
Government realizes that, without substantial imports of capital
equipment from America, the progress of the country's development
will be seriously delayed. Nevertheless, the Australian Government
is prepared to take appropriate action in the future; however strong
it may be. I also add, in view of incorrect reports, that I did not
coime to Britain to demand more dollars. My mission has been aimed
at obtaining the fullest information so that economic policy, particularly
as it affects dollars, can be laid down with reasonable certainty
and that the efforts of the United Kingdom and Australia can be
properly co-ordinated.
To the British people, I say that I believe that much can be done
in Australia to expand production of beef, dairy products and wheat.
We lhav good seasonal prospects in Australia and it is hoped, for
example, that lamb production this year will be 10,000,000 above an
average year.
" I know that numbers of people in England, Scotland, Ireland
: n d Wales are interested in going to Australia. The fullest understanding
exists between the British and Australian Governments on
this matter and to those who feel that delays are endless, I point out
that, first, the ships have to be available, and, secondly, we have to
pursue vigorously, which we are doing, a housing construction proegrnmin'
Time is the arresting factor.
It has been my privilege and pleasure auring my stay to meet Their
Ma. jesties and the Princess Margaret and I have assured them, on
behlilf of the people of Australia, of the warmest welcome when they
visit us next year.
Let : ijc. in saying good-night to you, tell you that the Australian
people are constantly thinking of you. Our servicemen fought alongside
you in two wars. We are standing by you now in fighting for
economic stability. That may be, as I have said, a long fight, and
each obstacle must be faced with the same courage that the people of
Britain have shown in the last ten years. It will he our privilege, and,
ind', d, oui' duty. to help in every way we can."
On 25th July, 1948, Mr. Chifley broadcast over some commercial
stations-Mr. Chifley said-
Good evening. As you know, I have just returned from a mission
to London. My objective was primarily to discuss economic problems
of mutual interest to the British and Australian Governments, but I
also dealt with a number of other matters. All told, I attended two
meetings of the British Cabinet and also talked with eleven members
of the British Government-and with some of the Ministers I talked
more than once.
In addition, I visited Berlin, where I spent some hours with
British, American, French and Australian authorities so that I might
obtain first-hand information and be able to gauge the atmosphere
4738.-3. 
of the situation in the German capital. While there, I also talked
with German trade union leaders and with members of the German
civil administration in Berlin. Berlin presents a sad picture of the
devastation of war. I have previously visited some of the worst war
devastated cities, such as Hiroshima, Yokahama, Tokio, Manila and
Rangoon. But, excepting Hiroshima, which was completely destroyed
by the atomic bomb, I have not seen anything like the destruction in
Berlin. Masses of bricks and rubble, gutted buildings, now mark this
once beautiful city. It is a grim warning of the tragic consequences
of war. On my way to London, and also on my way back, I talked with
the British Commissioner-General at Malaya ( Mr. Malcoln
Macdonald) and with the British Governor of Singapore ( Sir Franklin
Gimson). I obtained from Mr. Macdonald a full background picture
of the position in Singapore and Malaya.
As the result of my talks at London, I can say that there is
the fullest understanding between the British and .\ ustralian Governments
on the economic matters that affect our common and national
interests. Of course, we are in constant touch with each other by
cable and often by radio-telephone. I told the British pcople, on
your behalf and on behalf of all Australians, that it would be our
privilege, indeed our duty, to help them in every way possible. I was
glad to sec that, despite great economic difficulties, London and itpeople
looked brighter than when I visited there in 1946. The gaping
holes made by the doodle bugs" and V2' s have been patched up.
The people are better dressed. There are more things in the shop
windows. British production is steadily increasing and their courage
is an example to the world.
While at London, I also said, and I give you a further reminder
now, that the road ahead for the British peoples everywhere and,
indeed, for nearly all the non-dollar countries, is going to be long
and hard. I don't want anybody to think, because I have said that,
that the British Commonwealth is not going to come tlrou: gh. It is
going to be a tough fight, but I have not any doubts that we shall
pull through. I feel confident that with the growing strength of the
Dominions. the British Commonwealth can be made stronger than
ever. One of the keys to the problem is increased production. The
Macquarie electorate contains centres of both primary and secondary
production. On the industrial side, there are places such as Lithgow,
Portland and St. Mary's. Primary production of a varied nature is
to be found in almost every part of Macquarie. Australia is pledged
to assist Britain in every way possible and increased production is
necessary to fulfil that pledge. In addition, our own welfare, the
expansion and development of our country, are both wrapped up in
our own capacity to do better. 
" Work-hard work-overtime, where necessary, must be undertaken
as part of our national duty. We want to develop and build
a greater Australia for our children. Further, our strategic position
is not what it was. This is a shrinking world and Australia cannot
feel immune just because, geographically, she is situated down under
in the Southern Hemisphere. We have to build and maintain a strong
Australia and, I repeat, hard work is the only way to achieve that.
We owe that not only to our own people but to our Allies and, particularly,
the United Kingdom. Let me illustrate to you how the
world has shrunk. In fourteen and a half days, I covered just on
28,000 miles by air. In other words, I travelled about 2,000 miles
every day and did eight days work as well. I stopped at or passed
over about a dozen different countries.
" There is no such thing to-day as the Far East. In fact, Asia
and Europe have been brought almost as close to us as New Zealand.
An island that is 450 miles away from Darwin and was just a spot
on the map could very easily become of intense interest to Australia.
I want Australians to realize that they must think and act as Australians.
They must think and act in terms of the nation. Economic
wevlfare, security and a contented future are all wrapped up in what
we do as individuals and as a community.
In your homes to-night, you are safe and secure. Your families
rue around you. You are assured of full employment. You have
boundless opportunities ahead of you. By contrast, I have seen places
and talked with people in the grip of misery and hardship, indeed,
with no future at all. Uneasy countries, worried peoples are to be
found everywhere. The devastating hand of war has caused
unbelievable material damage and worked shocking havoc in people's
minds. The heritage that has come to us, the great chance for the
future must not be frittered away. I ask the people of Macquarie, as
I ask all Australians, to stand together for the national good and for
their own good." TARIFF.
WESTERN CUSTOMS UNION.
On 8th July, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said*-
The matter of the Western Customs Union would have to be a
subject for discussion between Britain and the Dominions if it cut
across Imperial preference in any way.
Australia has assumed that no finality will be reached on the
Western Customs Union without consultation with the Dominions.
There has been no intimation yet by the British Government that it
will be specially discussed with the Dominion Governments."
At London. 
MIGRATION.
GOVERNMENT POLICY-BRITISH MIGRANTS.
On Sth July, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said*-
have had discussions with the Minister for British Commonwealth
Relations ( Mr. Noel-Baker) and further discussions will be
held later. We have dealt with migration generally rather than any
specific plans-matters such as ships and related problems. Many
physical difficulties are in the way of mass migration and a lot of
study and thought will be necessary and I do not think that mass
migration is physically possible in the near future. I am satisfied
that the British Government has been very co-operative in regard
to shipping. There have been discussions regarding the transfer of some
British industries to Australia but the tendency has been for British
firms to establish branches in Australia or to expand existing branches-
That has been going on fairly rapidly because of the sound Australian
economy; the market in Australia; and the fact that Australia is a
foctil point of development of eastern trade."

GOVERNMENT POLICY-PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT.
On 1Sth July, 1948, Mr. Chifley said:-
I had long discussions at London with the Minister for British
Commonwealth Relations ( Mr. Noel-Baker) and the Minister for
Transport ( Mr. Barnes). Despite the shipping shortage, I hope that
the rate of migration will be stepped up very considerably for British
migrants, displaced persons in Europe and Italians. At Berlin, I
discussed with the United States authorities the possibility of securing
additional displaced persons for Australia."
GOVERNMENT POLICY-MINERS.
On 19th July, 1948, Mr. Chifley said:-
The British Government is endeavouring to use Polish niners.
They are used in Wales. Difficulties are being encountered in
Yorkshire. At the moment, trained Polish miners are not available
for Australia but some Italian miners might be available. The matter
would have to be discussed with the Australian Coal and Shale
Employees Federation. One of the difficulties is knowledge of the
English language and it would be necessary to teach them the rules
and regulations of working." At London. 
BRITAIN.
FINANCIAL POLICY-DOLLAR IMPORTS, PRIME
MINISTER'S STATEMENT.
On 8th July, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said*-
" My mission to London is mainly on matters of economic interesis
common to both British and Australian Governments. I hope that, as a
result of the mission, the common bond between us will be strengthened
in the best interests of . both Governments. Cables cannot fully cover
the ground that can be covered by talks.
Australia forms part of the dollar pool. It has been almost always
a drawer on the dollar pool. We have been striving to cut d! own
expenditure in many fields. The judgment as to what constitutes
essentiality in dollar expenditure causes controversy but Australia feels
that she must not draw any more dollars than are essential.
" In 1948-49, Australia anticipates making very substantiail ri. luetions
in dollar expenditure and in the amount to be purchased from the
British Treasury. The precise programme is difficult until revenue
from Australian exports are knowin-an example being the revenue
from Australian wool sold in the United States. Time often alters
early figures. Further, rising prices often alter quantities."
On 18th July, 1948, Mr. Chifley -aid-
I make it clear that I did not go to London to beg for dollars. The
main objective of the visit was to find out how best we can co-ordinate
the policies of the two governments having regard to the shortage of
dollars; how Australia can share in the availability of goods from
Britain, previously obtained from the United States and other hard
currency areas; and to discuss a long-range policy regarding dollar..
" The European recovery programme provides only for Britain's
dollar deficit and not for the Dominions' dollar deficits. It is doubtful
if the European recovery programme makes full provision for the dollar
deficits of Britain. One of Britain's problems is the increasing price
of dollar imports. Although production is increasing-and increasing
splendidly in some industries-some of the increased dollar earnings are
offset by rising prices in America. As British leaders have said,
increased production is one of the keys of the problem. It is also
necessary in Australia if Australia's economic welfare is to assist in
giving increased help to Britain-particularly in foodstuffs. I have
not given thought to means of increasing production but the working
of overtime is essential.
" It is no use disguising the fact that a long hard road is ahead
because of the difficulty in getting dollar goods. It would be very foolish
to think that either Britain or Australia can solve that as a . hortterm
problem. At T. ondn. 
The only solution to the present disequilibrium in dollars will
be for the United States and other dollar countries to buy something
equivalent in value to what they sell. That course seems unlikely so
the sterling area countries must do the best they can with the dollars
available. We have to face the inevitable by doing the best we can in
the years ahead on the dollars available and in the meantime to
produce our utmost.
The Australian Government must be prepared to examine all
avenues of trade to see how dollars can be saved. There is a complete
understanding with the British Government as to the precise position
and how best Australia can render assistance to Britain. The Australian
Government has already planned reductions in dollar expeiditure."
On 19th July, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
" The Australian Government is trying to divert imports into tho
sterling area and the latest figures are-
In May, 1947, 27 per cent. were from Britain, and in May, 1947, this had
increased to 53 per cent. Imports from the total sterling area at the same
dates were 44 per cent. and 66 per cent. respectively. Imports from the dollar
area on the samine dates were 39 per cent. and 13 per cent. Total imports for
the same dates were Å“ 23,000,000 ( Australian) and Å“ 31.000,000 ( Australian)
respectively. " It is hoped to get dollar imports down still lower but there i:
always the problem of ever-rising prices in the United States."
FINANCIAL POLICY-STERLING, APPRECIATION.
On 19th August, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
" I was aware that consideration was being given by the New
Zealand Government to this matter* and the Commonwealth Government
had also been giving consideration to it. But I have no official
intimation from the New Zealand Government of the contemplated
action. It is not the intention, in the present circumstances, as
indicated by me in the House of Representatives on 26th February,
1948, to appreciate the Australian

EXPORTS-1947-48 FIGURES.
On l1th August, 1948, Mr. Pollard said that exports in 1947-4S
showed heavy increases in many exported commodities over 1946-47,
and in some cases had regained the volume of exports in 1938-39.
Combined exports of dairy products ( butter, cheese and processed milk)
were higher than pre-war. Other products which were exported in
greater quantities were hares and rabbits, bacon and hams, preserved
meat in tins, fruit in liquid, jams and jellies. Eggs and egg products,
poultry, oats and barley were much higher than pre-war. Those in
which there was a minor downward trend were sausage casings, citrus,
vleat and flour. Those in which there was a substantial decline over
1938-39 were beef, lamb, mutton, apples and sugar. Comparative

beun held that day to consider the report of the Director of Rationing 
( Mr. Cumming) regarding the operation and administrative methods
of petrol rationing in Australia. The sub-committee decided to recomment
that either by legislation or by continuance of existing Defence
( Transitional) Act Regulations, power be taken to continue petrol
rationing until 31st December, 1949. The sub-committee had decided
that there would be no immediate reduction in petrol rations, but that
all State Liquid Fuel Boards would, in conjunction with the existin. g

WHEAT STABILIZATION SCHEME.
CONFERENCE WITH STATES-DECISION.
On 12th July, 1948, tie Minister for Commerce and Agriculture
( Mr. Pollard) said that a conference that day with the State Ministers
for Agriculture had resulted in the following decisions:-
The Commonwealth Government shall guarantee a price of 6s. 3d. a hushel
f. o. r. ports bulk basis for wheat grown and delivered by wheat-growers.
The guaranteed price shall vary according to an index of production costs for
each season starting with the 1948-49 crop.
The guarantee shall apply to the wheat crop marketed through approved
organizations for the period up to the end of the 1952-53 season.
Approved organizations shall be the Australian Wheat Board and those
organizations which are empowered by the State Parliaments with authority to
receive wheat and to market it as the agents of the Australian Wheat Board.
The Commonwealth shall ensure the guaranteed price in respect of the
export from any one season's crop, provided that this guarantee shall not apply
to the quantity of export in excess of 100,000,000 bushels.
A stabilization fund shall be established by means of a tax on wheat
exported to meet the guaranteed price above mentioned.
The tax shall apply when the export price is higher than the guaranteed
price, and shall be 50 per cent. of the difference between the two but shall not
exceed 2s. 2d. a bushel.
The tax slall apply to the 1947-48 and later wheat cropl.
No refunds of tax from the fund shall he made ( except for the Il945-46
and 1946-47, amounts already approved) except after consideration at sonim
future date. The Commonwealth agrees that it will not hold an excessive
amount in the fund, and it will consider a refund of tax to the oldest contributing
pool whenever the financial prospects of the fund justify it.
The State Ministers agree to recommend to their governments the pas; age iif
legislation necessary to ensure-
The home-consuinption price equal to the guaranteed price.
The authorizing of an approved organization to receive from whe: Atgrowers
all wheat voluntarily delivered for sale as part of an Australia. i

That legislative authority exists in each State to empower the direction
of wheat by the Australian Wheat Board at any time to an approved
organization as defined above.
The regulation of wheat-growing on marginal areas which have been
reconstructed under the plans approved for the elimination of uneconomic
wheat areas, and the establishment of a commiittee to advise
in cases where action to regulate wheat-growing on marginal areas
is necessary.
The conference agrees, subject to acceptance by the respective State governments-
That States, where they desire to do so, will constitute State whe. it
boards composed of a majority of growers' rlpresentatives elected ly
a ballot conducted by the State.
I That each State board will nominate growers' repreentatives who . re
growers to the central authority in accordance with the present gri er
representation on the Australian Wheat Board.
That it will be optional for any State board to act cither in an advisory
or an administrative capacity as decided by the State concerned.
Where a State Government does not desire to create a State Wheat Boari.
the machinery of the central authority ( the Australian Wheat Boardl)
is to function.
Where no State hoard is created, growers' relpresentativcs to the

SOUTH-EAST ASIA.
MALAYA-PRIME MINISTER'S STATMENT.
On 18th July, 1043. the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
I cannot say I am very happy about the position in Singapore and
Malaya. I had long discussions on my way to London and again on
17th July, 1948, with the British Commissioner-General ( Mr.
MoDonald). He is in the best position to judge and believes that the
situation can be brought under control satisfactorily."
MALAYA-EXPORT OF ARMS.
On 19th July, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
The export of arms and war material from Australia to Malaya
are matters that have not come before the Government for consideration.
I do not recall any request by the late Sir Edward Gent. There is a
long standing embargo on the sale of arms to anybody or any country."
On 21st July, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
The Customs Act provides for a prohibition on the export of arms,
ammunition, explosives, military and naval stores. From the inauguration
of the Commonwealth, there has been an export prohibition in
one form or another on goods in this category. The existing prohibition,
which came into operation in 1935, provides that none of these
goods may be exported without the consent in writing of the Minister
for Customs.
" Following the outbreak of disorder in Malaya recently, numbers
of applications have been received by the Customs Department for permits
to export automatic pistols and revolvers and ammunition therefor
to individual persons and individual companies in Malaya for the selfprotection
of themselves or of their employees. Applications have been
made also for permits to export small bulk shipments through commercial
houses. These applications have been granted subject to the following
conditions:-
That, from the perusal of the order and related documents, the Collector
of Custonie at the port of export is satisfied as to the hona-fides of the case.
That the goods are covered by an import licence issued by the police
authorities in Malaya.
That the goods are consigined to the Chief Police Officer in the district in
which the consignee resides.
No applications have been received for the exportation to Malaya
of any machine, guns or sub-machine guns.
As regards provisions of light machine guns or military equipment,
no request has been made by the British Government for the supply of
these weapons to Malaya. The Australian Army authorities already
hold in custody 100 Sten guns which the British War Office has asked
the Australian Government to dispose of as surplus equipment on its
behalf. Should the British Government cancel this request and ask to
have these guns delivered, they will be delivered as early as possible.
If a request is received through the British Government for supply from
Australian stores of similar equipment, to assist in the preservation of 
17
law and order in the area, the request will be referred to Cabinet at its
meeting on 2nd August, in view of Cabinet's previous decision that no
export of military equipment was to be permitted. Should Cabinet
decide to vary this view and supply equipment, in response to such a
request, this will also be delivered."
On 30th July, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
The British Government, at the request of the Government of the
Federation of Malaya, has asked for the early delivery of the 100 Sten
guns belonging to them and held in Australia and has also asked
whether the Australian Government would be ready to supply certain
other automatic weapons, ammunition and equipment, which are required
for the maintenance of law and order in Malaya, and which
may be available here.
In accordance with the statement I made on 21st July, 1948, the
100 Sten guns, with ammunition, were despatched by air yesterday
nnd should be delivered at Singapore later to-day for onward transit
to the Malayan authorities, together with a few other items of equipment
required for testing purposes.
" The question of the supply of weapons and equipment from Australian
stocks will, in accordance with my statement of 21st July, 1948,
bf, considered by Cabinet at its meeting on 2nd August, 1948. Meanwhile,
the extent to which the item. required may be available here is
being urgently examined."
On 2nd August, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
Cabinet decided to-day that, where a request has been, or will be,
made by the British Government for arms and equipment for use by
the Government of the Malayan Union, these will be made available
from Australian supplies within the reasonable limits of their
a vailability." INDUSTRIAL.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS-PROPOSED CONFERENCE.
On 20th July, 1948, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Holloway) said--
" I would be in favour of the Prime Minister calling a conference
of employees and employers to discuss how . best to get a greater volume
of production of essential goods. If a basis for an all-party conference
cannot be reached, I am in favour of the Prime Minister calling a
conference of union delegates for a discussion, with the same object
in view." On 1lth August, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" I have conferred to-day with the Minister for Labour ( Mr.
Holloway), the President ( Mr. P. J. Clarey), the Secretary ( Mr. A. E.
Monk), the Assistant Secretary ( Mr. R. R. Broadby) and Mr. C. Crofts
of the Australian Council of Trade Unions on the need for greater
production. A conference of trades unions will be convened at a later
date. Dtails of the conference will be arranged by Mr. Holloway in
conjunction with the A. C. T. U." 
SOCIAL SECURITY.
PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED PERSONS.
On 21st July, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" To take full advantage of the knowledge and experience of
existing staffs in extending the Government's plans for the rehabilitation
of physically handicapped persons, it has been decided that the plan will,
for the time being, be administered by the Department of Post-war
Reconstruction. Legislation will be introduced to amend the Social Services Consolidation
Act to vest the responsibility for the development of the
scheme for rehabilitation of disabled members of the community in
the Director-General of Social Services.
The scheme will extend to invalid pensioners or claimants for thi
invalid pension and those receiving or claiming unemployment or sickness
benefits who would become unemployable unless rehabilitation
assistance is provided.
" The Department of Social Services has already established a
rehabilitation centre in each State except Tasmania, where facilities cf
the Red Cross Society are u. ed.
" Staff employed by the Department of Social Services on this work
is almost wholly temporary, but the Department of Post-war Recolstruction,
responsible for the rehabilitation of many thousands of
ex-servicemen, has a considerable number of permanent officers on it::
. taff. These officers are still required for this work. It is recognized.
however, that the work of post-war reconstruction will gradually declin..
and that many of the permanent staff of that department trained in
rehabilitation work might appropriately be transferred to the Department
of Social Services. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction
( Mr. Dedman) and the Minister for Social Services ( Senator
McKenna) have decided that-
The Department of Social Servirc e lhall coiitinue ti he relpiniible ftinr tii
civilian rehabilitation plan.
Temporarily the Depirtnlc': t of I.' ot-war Recon-truction will tnke , v. cr. athe
agent for the Depart enicito f Sociail Services. tlhe dtl nii tistitor n . f i l

" The Department of Social Services will proceed with the cstal,-
lishment and appointment of its permanent staff for the rehabilitationl
plan but will, in the meantime, second the personnel so appointed tii
the Department of Post-war Reconstruction."
TUBERCULOSIS-CABINET DECISION.
On 3rd August, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
Cabinet to-day approved of a plan of control in regard to tuberculosis
along lines already discussed with State Ministers of Health on
29th June, 1948, for conclusion with the States at the forthcomilng
conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers on 23rd Auguzt." 
COMMONWEALTH LOANS.
FLOTATION COSTS.
On 28th July, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
During the war years and since, Commonwealth loan raisings have
been conducted with remarkable economy and compare more than
favorably with other countries. After provision is made for all charges
-including advertising, brokerage, bank expenses and the Commonwealth
Loani. Organization-the cost does not exceed 5s. per cent. This
cost is less than one-third of the cost rate regarded as appropriate in
some overseas countries.
" From the war-time peak of 360 in all States, the Commonwealth
Loans Organization staff has been reduced to 130. The remaining staff
is regarded as essential. It provides a nucleus of highly-trained persons
whose services are fully employed on loan subscription, conversions and
national savings campaigns.
The Sixth Security Loan, opening on 8th September, 194S, is an
iin'portant operation. Apart from Å“ 15,000,000 of new money, an appeal
will be made to 300,000 holders of Å“ 85,000,000 of Commonwealth
securities maturing in September-October, 194S, to convert into the
new loan.
" Visits to homes by the organization's representatives have been part
of normal activities for a considerable period. This advice card sent
to householders is necessary because, with money involved, precautions
ar1 necessary to protect both Commonwealth and public. This work is
done under strict supervision."
HEALTH AND YOUTH WELFARE.

AID ROADS AND WORKS ACT.
PETROL TAX, GRANT FOR ROADS.
On 6th August. 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
" Representationis have been received from many sources that the
whbole of the -proceeeds of taxation on petrol or a greater portion shiould
be made available for roads purposes. 
" The petrol tax is not imposed solely for this purpose and although
for many years substantial roads grants have been made to the States,
the major portion of this tax has been required to meet the expenditure
of the Commonwealth for general purposes and in particular, the heavy
commitments for war and post-war purposes. The tax is primarily a
revenue impost, in common with those imposed on many other item;,
such as beer, tobacco and matches.
" About 90 per cent. of the petrol consumed in Australia for civil
purposes is used for commercial and industrial purposes. To a great
extent the cost is passed on to the general community in traisportatioa
and delivery charges.
Since the greater portion of the tax is not finally borne by the
users of petrol but by the general community, it is inappropriate to
contend that the whole of the proceeds should be usecd for roads
purposes. Since the war the petrol tax has been reduced by Id. a gallon.
As in the case of other forms of taxation, consideration is given to tile
possibility of effecting reductions as the financial commitments of the
Commonwealth permit.
The whole question of Commonwealth assistance for roads received
very full consideration when the Commonwealth Aid Roads and Works
Act was ' passed in May, 1947. This legislation provides for the payment
to State Governments over a period of three years of considerably
increased amounts and one of its features is that it provides for ai
special payment of Å“ 1,000,000 a year for the maintenance and construction
of roads, other than main highways, through sparsely settled
areas, timber country and rural areas. These payments are made in the
first instance to State governments, since it is not the policy of the
Commonwealth to give direct financial aid to local government bodies.
Including the sum of Å“ 500,000 for expenditure by the Commonwealth
on strategic roads and roads for access to Commonwealth properties,
the amount so made available for roads purposes during 1947-48
was Å“ 6,300,000, compared with Å“ 4,800,000 in 1946-47. The question
of the adequacy of the present grant is being kept under notice by the
Government. It was inevitable that the war-time diversion of practically Australia's
total economic resources should result in some deterioration i,
the condition of many roads. The question of restoration and improvc.-
ment is not, however, solely one of finance. As a result of the suspension
of many forms of ordinary economic activity during the war, resources
of materials and man-power in Australia to-day are insufficient to me-t
all requirements. If a greater sum were to be spent on roads, it is
obvious that there would be a reduction in the allocation of labour and
materials to other types of economic activity and apart from purely
financial considerations, the expenditure of money on roads must be
viewed in that light."

JUDGMENT, APPEAL.
On 13th August, 1948, Mr. Chifley said-
I have consulted all members of Cabinet on the High ( ou: l's
judgment in the Banking case and a decision has been reached to seek
an appeal to the Privy Council at the earliest possible date.
direct attention to some aspects of the court's decision which it is
desirable should be made clear to the public. A majority of the court
has held that certain parts of the 1947 Act conflict with Section 92
of the Constitution, which guarantees interstate free trade. That,
however, is a matter on which there has been sharp division of opinion
among the justices of the court, In the Chief Justice's opinion, the
Act was fully within the principles relating to Section 92 established by
the Privy Council.
Apart from Section 92, the fundamental question is the scope of
the National Parliament's power to make laws with respect to banking.
On that point, a majority of the court substantially upheld the major
contentions put forward for the Commonwealth by the Attorney-General
( Dr. Evatt) and rejected the narrow. interpretation contended for by
the private banks.
The majority of the court also decisively rejected the special
contentions put forward by the three plaintiff States.
I am advised that the judgments of the Chief Justice and Mr.
Justice McTiernan show that a few amendments in non-vital provisions
would have enabled those justices to uphold the Act in all respects.
Copies of the High Court judgments are being despatched to Dr.
Evatt in London and will reach him early next week. I have arranged
for the Solicitor-General ( Professor K. H. Bailey) to go to London
as soon as possible for consultation with Dr. Evatt.'
COAL INDUSTRY.
PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT TO COALFIELDS.
On 12th August, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
The Minister for Shipping and Fuel (. Senator Ashley) and representatives
of the Joint Coal Board will accompany me on a visit to
Cessnock and Kurri Kurri on Sunday, 5th September, 1948. It is
proposed that I address members of the Australian Coal and Shall
Employeve' Federation at those places."
NATIONAL DEBT.
NATIONAL DEBT COMMISSION-ANNUAL MEETING.
On 19th August, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said that
the National Debt Commission had met that day when the annual report
of transactions for the year ended 30th June, 1948, was presented, and
consideration given to the application of sinking fund moneys accruing
diiring 194S-49. 
Receipts of the sinking fund for 1947-48 were Å“ 27,659,000. Receipts
for 1948-49 were estimated at Å“ 28,785,000 being Å“ 18,592,000 on account
of the Connuonwealth and Å“ 10,193,000 on account of the States. Of
the latter amount, Å“ 1,851,000 would be provided from Commonwealth
revenue. Total contributions estimated to be available for the redemption
of the d,. bt of each State were-
New South Wales, Å“ 4,000,000; Victoria, Å“ 2,034,000: Queensland, Å“ 1,475,000;
South Australia, Å“ 1.254,000; Western Australia, Å“ 1,092,000; Tasmania, Å“ 338,000;
ttal Å“ 10.193,000.
The receipts totalling Å“ 28,785,000 were directed by the commission
to be applied in the various markets in which Commonwealth and State
securities were held-Australia, London and New York. The commission
used its funds for the redemption of Commonwealth and State
securities either by repurchase of securities on the market, or by redemption
at maturity.
The large sums applied in repurchases on Stock Exchanges ensured
a regular market for security holders. When securities were acquired
by the commission, either by repurchase or redemption, they were canrc'lled
and the public debt reduced accordingly.
Members of the commission were-
The Couionwealth Trea-urer ( Mr. Chifey), chairman, the' Chief Justice
( Sir Jolhn Lathami), the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank ( Mr. H. T.
Armitagc), the acting-secretary of the Treasury ( Mr. G. P. N. Watt), the
Solicitor-General ( Professnr K. H. Bailey) and Mr. A. T. Smithers, representati\
ve . f tlwi States. GOLD MINING.
ASSISTANCE.
On 20th August, 1948, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Chifley) said-
The Commonwealth has agreed to provide a measure of assistance
to three gold-mining companies in the Kalgoorlie area and to review
the case of another Kalgoorlie mine when the financial results of its
operations during 1948 are available. The request of a mine in the
Cue district for assistance is still under consideration.
The Commonwealth's agreement to provide this assistance, follows
an application which was made by fifteen mines, through the Western
Australia Chamber of Mines, to the Minister for the Interior ( Mr.
Johnson). The Chamber claimed that a number of the mines would
he forced to close as the present price of gold did not allow a sufficient
margin to meet the rising costs. It was pointed out that the closing
cf these mines would have a serious effect on the economy of Western
Anctralia and might result in the abandonment of certain townships.
Financial and technical investigations were made into the position
of each mine. These investigations showed that a general form of
assistance is not warranted. Many mines are still capable of paying
good dividends even though rising costs are reducing the level of profits 
to which the mines have been accustomed. A few of the mines included
in the application are only salvage propositions, and Commonwealth
assistance would not be justified under such circumstances.
The mines wvhich it has been decided to aid during the current
year have been informed of the termis of assistance, and the position of
the indust ry in Western Australia will be reviewed early next year.
Most mines are experiencing difficulty in maintaining production rate
because of labour shortages."
