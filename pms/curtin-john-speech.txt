COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT.-DIGEST OF DECISIONSAND ANNOUNCEMENTS AM4IMPORTANTSPEECHES THE PRIME MINISTER( THE HON. JOHN CURTIN).No. 8.PERIOD-2nTu NOVEMBER, 1941, To 27TH NOVEMBER, 1941.By Atbcwribt:L F. Joamm. Cnamonwc Comvrnnt PrinM. Cibm.( Printed in Ajstli&amp;)
BANNING OF BOOKS.ARMY MINISTER'S STATEMENT.In Parliament.-On 20th November, 1941, the Minister for theArmy ( Mr. Forde) said-" The questions which have been directed at the Army Censorshiprecently fall into three sections. The first concerns the list of publicationswhich are on the banned list prepared for the Army; the secondthe alleged impounding of books being imported as cargo; and thethird whether Major Cameron, is associated in his militarycapacity' with the banning of literature.At the moment 171 publications, including books, magazines,newspapers, pamphlets and cyclo-styled circulars, are on the Armybanned list on the ground that they are subversive. Of these, 83 comeunder the broad description of Leftist"; 16 have a distinct Naziflavour and the remainder consist of certain Japanese periodicals and'material which is militantly pacifist or anti-British. Of the 171publications, 64 are published in England, 57 in the United States ofAmerica, 16 in Japan, 9 in Russia, 4 in Australia, 3 in Manchuria,3 in Mexico, 2 in each of France, China, Brazil, Ireland and Swedenand 1 in each of New Zealand, Argentine, Finland, Switzerland andIndia; 49 are printed in foreign languages and the rest in English.Included in the list of banned " Leftist" publications are the Russiannewspapers Pravda and Izvestia, as well as a number of the worksof Ienin and others. I have ordered a review of the 171 publicationswith a view to seeing if any of them can safely be released forcirculation without ' any risk to national security. Recently twopublications were removed from this list because it was found thatthey did not contain any subversive or objectionable propaganda.They were the Moscow News, a weekly newspaper published in Englishin Moscow, and the Left News, a periodical published by the firm ofGollancz, London." The Army is responsible for the censorship of matter passingthrough postal and telegraphic channels. At present if any of thepublications on the Army's banned list are intercepted in the post theyare stopped. The procedure which was adopted in compiling the listof banned publications was as follows: Publications intercepted inthe mail by postal and telegraphic censorship authorities, and suspectedof being subversive or detrimental to the efficient prosecution of thewar, were submitted to the Department of Information, which is thepress and publicity censorship authority. That department decidedwhether or not a publication contravened the provisions of NationalSecurity ( General) Regulation 17. If that department decided that apublication did contravene the regulation, it was placed by theController of Postal and Telegraphic Censorship on the banned listand was stopped by the censors. The procedure for removing apublication from the list is that if, in the course of examining materials,a District Censor thinks that the tone of a listed publication haschanged, it is submitted by the Controller of Postal and Telegraphic
Censorship to the Department of Information. If that Departmentfinds that the publication is not subversive it is removed from the list.The next question is the impounding of literature after theimportation and before sale or distribution. I am informed byMilitary Intelligence authorities that they go no further than thecensorship action I have just detailed. The power to impound" Leftist" literature exists in National Security ( General) Regulation17, which provides that a Minister may, by order in the Gazette,declare printed matter to be a prohibited paper. The printed matterthen becomes automatically banned and forfeited. Under NationalSecurity ( Subversive Associations) Regulations, the Attorney-Generalhas certain powers in regard to the property of associations which aredeclared to be subversive, but these do not appear to be relevant hereexcept where they relate to the impounding of the literature of thoseorganizations which have already been declared subversive.' Complaints have been made that the Customs Department referreddoubtful publications to the Army which the Army banned withoutexplanation and that the Army refused to inform booksellers whetheror why the ban had been imposed. I am informed that the Armyin theal matters acts on the advice of the Department of Information.Apart altogether from Army Censorship, the Customs Department haspower under their Prohibited Imports Regulations to stop certain typesof Communist literature.In regard to the statements which have been made that theMilitary Intelligence organization in Southern Command, of whichMajor Cameron, is a member, has taken action to impound orsuppress literature other than that which is included in the bannedlist, I am in a position to state definitely that Southern Command hasnot at any time since the outbreak of the war, either within or outsidethe scope of their powers, impounded any literature, imported orotherwise, either on their own initiative or at the request of some otherauthority, or in any other circumstances. Southern Command hasnot been concerned in any way in association with the CriminalInvestigation Branch or with the police in the impounding ofliterature. It is true that Major Cameron, in his militarycapacity, was connected with Intelligence Censorship in name forabout a month, but his actual work was not very great. There are noinstances in which he was concerned with the banning of literature inhis military capacity."( For earlier references, please see No. 4, page 9.)MR. A. CAMERON, M. H. R.On 21st November, 1941, Mr. Forde said-" I can see no justification for appointing a court of inquiry toinvestigate the allegations made against Mr. Cameron, by asection of the press. My investigation into the whole question of thebanning of books -showed that there were no instances in whichMajor Cameron was concerned with the banning of literature in hismilitary capacity."
RUSSIAN NEWSPAPERS.On 21st November, 1941, Mr. Forde said-" In view of our changed relationship with Russia I now cannotsee any justification for banning the two important Russian newspapersPravda and Izvestia. They are quoted every day in the cables, whichproves they contain no subversive propaganda against the best interestsof the Allies, either in their leading articles or propaganda columns,and that Russia has everything in common with the British Empirein this struggle." CENSORSHIP CONTROL.In Parliament.-On 21st November, 1941, the Minister for Trade.and Customs ( Senator Keane) said-" Recently I had occasion to intervene with regard to a largeconsignment of books from overseas that had been delivered inMelbourne and had been held up since last March. Although-the:books number about 600, only one of them was opei to challenge.Despite that fact, all books had been held under the. direction of someArmy authority, but, on the position being explained, the: books werereleased. The main point is that there is dual control. " I have askedthe Army authorities to communicate to me their views. as to whetherthe power of censorship, from the point of view of subversive activities;should not reside in one authority. When I receive from the Minister'for the Army a reply to my recent request for a full statement on thematter, I shall answer at greater length."On 26th November, 1941, Mr. Forde said-The matter of censorship control is one that will be discussed by.me at the first opportunity with the Minister for Trade and Customs( Senator Keane) and the Minister for Information (' Senator Ashley).There is a desire that there should be a centralized control of:censorship." PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.;SAGR[ CULTURAL COUNCIL MEETING.'On 20th November, 1941, at a meeting of the Australian Agricultural-Council at Canberra, the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Scully).. said-" I thank the various State Ministers for attending this meetingand welcome them to the deliberations of the first meeting over whichit is my privilege to preside. I am fully conscious of the very difficulttask which confronts the Government, and particularly the Ministera. isisting the Minister for Commerce ( Senator Fraser) and myself in::guiding marketing policy through the problems which war brings Ihave had considerable personal experience of agricultural . industries.:I face the task as a man acutely aware of the primary producers'problems. In this war shipping has suffered greatly, and the British7780.-2
Governent finds it necessary to make changes in the disposition ofshipping at short notice. Supplying countries have to cope withbaffling problems and adjust their policy to variations in marketdemands which cannot be foreseen." The new Government conmes to office with its own distinctivepolicy in regard to agriculture. It has its own ideas in regard tothemethod of improving the general economic position ofthe farmers; andmethods of control of marketing.The Government believes that the financial position of farmers canbe improved by a better system of long-term finance. The farmershould be able to secure, at reasonable rates of interest, financial. At~ imodation over a long term of years in respect of the propercapital vaoue of his farm. The present Government believes this can;be made good by a properly constituted Mortgage Bank. To enablethe Mortgage Bank to function with benefit to the farmer and toimprove his general cconomic status, the Government is studying allpossible measures which may be summed up under the general titleof rural reconstruction. As the Minister for Commerce I Will doeverything t~ o improve the farmer's income; to enhance the importanceof rural life; to reverse the present tendencies towards rural depopulation,and to establish the foundations of a greater rural prosperity. Theindividual farmer must be protected against too heavy a load of debt.TPhis protcction must come from control of land values and fromcontrol of his general debt structure, with guidance to him as to thecapacity of his property to bear the load of indebtedness. Too great Rshare of the income fronm the* farmn goes to the creditor." The rural community requires national effort to provide in thecountry the amenities which are commonplace in the cities. This jointeffort at improvement of the individual farmer's position and theprovision of amenities for rural districts will comprise the subjectmatter of rural reconstrucetion. Details of this policy will be dealtwith from time to time. I hope to have the States' co-operation toimprove the status of agriculture.Regarding control of marketing, Ministers will have observed thatit. is to he the Government's policy to afford to growers a more completecontrol over the marketing of their products. Efficient marketing ofany commodity requires specialized knowledge, but specialized knowledgemust be reinforced by an interest in the return to be secured.It is, therefore, the Government's policy t~ o ensure adequate growerrepresentation on all marketing organizations. We hope to arrangethat efficient representatives of the growers shall attain a predominantposition on the marketing boards. This can be achieved without inany wayv diminishing the technical e* fficiency of those or'Yani7ation( For earlier references, please see No. 1, page 11.)
AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL DECISIONS.On 21st November, 1941, the Agricultural Council decided severalmatters. RURAL REHABILITATION.It is desirable to continue debt adjustment for the time being and theStates urged that the Commonwealth continue to find funds for State plans.The whole system of debt adjustment should be examined on a Commonwealthwidebasis with a view to bringing these plans into line with the CommonwealthGovernment's plans for rural rehabilitation. The States accepted the Commonwealthview that it is desirable to hasten the completion of plans for removingwheat farmers from marginal areas.INTERNATIONAL WHEAT AGREEMENT.Mr. Scully reported the nature of discussions in Washington between representativesof the United Kingdom, United States of America, Canada, Argentineand Australia. Consultations on the progress . made in the discussions areregarded as satisfactory by State Ministers who expressed their confidence thatthe Commonwealth, if it decided to participate in an International WheatAgreement, would safeguard the best interests of Australia.APPLES AND PEARS.The Commonwealth has not yet considered the matter but will do so soonand will then have the benefit of the views of the States.SUPERPHOSPHATES.Council adopted a method of rationing superphosphates which was submitted:by the Department of Commerce. It is based on the use by each producerof 65 per cent. of the quantity of superphosphates used in 1939-40.POTATOES.Council agreed that it was inadvisable to increase acreage or stimulateproduction with the anticipated demands of the Supply Department. It was:felt that the Supply Department should advise the State Departments ofAgriculture of its likely requirements and, having done this, should untilneitself to operating on the market in a normal way.MUNITIONS CONTRACTS.REFUNDS TO GOWERNMENT.On 21st November, 1941, the Minister for Munitions ( Mr. Makin)said that voluntary refunds aggregating at least œ 100,000 had beenmade to the Government by two large Australian-wide organizations.The refunds were from proceeds of war-time activities by these firms.It was a healthy sign when big companies acted in such a way,especially when, as far as he knew, the only reason for their action hadbeen that the right spirit had prompted them. He hoped that otherfirms would follow the excellent example. Much of the money fromone firm had been made in the erection of a munitions annexe and hewished to acknowledge publicly the company's patriotic gesture.MUNITIONS PRODUCTION.NITRIC ACID AND METHANOL.On 21st November, 1941, the Minister for Munitions ( Mr. Makin)said he had approved of a recommendation which should make Au.-tralia self-contained in respect of nitric acid and methanol, the requirementsof which at present amounted to œ 1,000,000 annually. This
would involve an expenditure of œ 2,500,000. Factories would beerected at Ballarat and Maribyrnong ( Victoria), Villawood ( NewSouth Wales), and Salisbury ( South Australia). They would belocated on the sites of government explosives factories.TANK MANUFACTURE.On 24th November, 1941, the Minister for the Army Forde)said-" The conference on the production of tanks in Australia consideredthe type of tank to be built and the whole question of the supply ofeugines for these tanks. Its object was to decide definitely the typeof tank to be built and the type of engine to be used."[ Ministers who attended the conference were Mr. Forde, theMinister for Munitions ( Mr. Makin) and the Minister for Air ( Mr.Drakeford).] CHRISTMAS ARRANGEMENTS.On 27th November, 1941, Mr. Makin said that State Boards ofArea Management would confer with workers' organizations as to whatdays would be most suitable to ' constitute the Christmas holiday period.The department was anxious that production should be maintained at.the highest possible maximum but it was recognized that, after thecontinuous and fatiguing hours which had been necessary to overcomethe shortage of technical skill, some break at Christmas was necessary.The rest period for munition workers would allow for overhaul of andrepairs to machinery. ( For earlier references, please see No. 2, page 23.).CONTROL OF FORGINGS.On 27th November, 1941, Mr. Makin said that in consequence ofthe heavy demands on industry in respect of steel forgings, particularlyin respect of heavy forgings necessary for gun manufactureand shipbuilding, it had been necessary to establish machinery withinthe department to control production of forgings. An Assistant-Controller of Forgings ( Mr. W. Noad) had -been appointed to theDirectorate of Materials Supply. It would be his business to ascertainthe requirements of steel forgings throughout the Commonwealth; theforging capacity available and the full utilization of that capacity.WOMEN'S WAR ORGANIZATIONS.PATHOLOGY COURSE FOR WOMEN.On M1st November. 1941, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Forde)sid-", Six women medical officers,: bearing the rank of captain, are atpresent undergoing an intensive three months' course in the science ofpathology at the School of Tropical. Medicine. The course is especiallydevised to give these women an intensive post-graduate experience ofthe requirements of clinical pathology.. The object is to make them
proficient and competent to take charge of laboratories in Australia forthorough investigation of the diseases to which an army is subject.Their appointment would make it possible to release male doctors . fthe Australian Army Medical Corps for service' overseas."AUSTRALIAN WOMEN~ S ARMY SERVICE.On 22nd November, 1941, Mr. Forde announced the appointment . offurther officers to the Australian Women's Army Bervice-Assistant Controller at Army Head.-quarters, Melbourne, Miss JeanWood; Tasmanian Commandant, Mrs. E.

Parry;-Assistant ' Commandant, Western Command,Miss J. Robertson. ( For earlier references, please see No. 5, page 18.)WOMEN'S AUXILIARY AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCERECRUITING.On 26th November, 1941, the Minister for Air ( Mr. Drakeford)said-" There has been a gradual but modified intake of recruits for theWomen's Auxiliary Australian Air Force in the last six weeks.Authority has ' been given for two separate drafts to be enrolled,approximately doubling the strength of the organization since thechange of Government. An impression seems to have grown up thatrecruiting for the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force. has beenstopped. I am sure that this announcement will correct that impression.The general principle of the future employment of womenin the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force and other defenceservices will be considered by Cabinet with a review of man-powerproblems, housing, uniforms and costs of such services."( For earlier references, please see No. 3, page 9.)WEARING OF UNIFORMS.On 28th November, 1941, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) said--" The following are the women's organizations within the DefenceServices for whom uniforms have been authorized-Navy.-Women's Royal Australian Naval Service;Army.-Australian Army Nursing Service, Australian ArmyWomen's Service, Voluntary Aid Detachments;Air.-Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, Royal AjistralianAir Force Nursing Service.Outside the Defence Services, the Red Cross Society, St. John'z,Ambulance and Girl Guides have long been recognized as bodieswearing uniforms." Numerous other outside women's organizations throughout theCommonwealth at present wear uniforms. The recently gazettedamendment to the National Security ( General) Regulations, relatingto the wearing of uniforms, is not designed to prohibit the wearing of
uniform by members of women's unofficial organizations created inconnexion with the war effort, if some type of uniform is desired bythem, provided that it is not ' similar to any uniform or emblem of theNaval, Military or Air Forces of the Commonwealth, or of any otherpart of the King's dominions, or of any women's auxiliary force,detachment or service established by the ' Commonwealth ii connexionwith any of those Forces SPORT IN WAR-TIME.PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT.On 21st November, 1941, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) said:-In my judgment, sport is not detrimental to the war effort. Thereare thousands of the population who are engaged in the war effort, andfor whom the playing of games is a positive refreshment and a goodthing for their own physical welfare and for the morale of the country.It is also a matter for great satisfaction that so many men who havebeen prominent in sport have enlisted in the forces, and that otherswho have not enlisted, but are engaged in the war effort, have intimatedthat they are not available for a regular programme of games. I do notsee why attending football matches-which attract huge crowds-shouldnot be a positive benefit to people who work indoors all the week; manyon war jobs. I see more merit in such outdoor recreation than inrecreation indoors, provided, of course, that moderation and commonsense are observed." It would be a demonstration to the world of the spirit of theBritish race if Australia and England resumed test matches immediately~ fter the war. Our race does not live by bread alone. I thinkthat sport, such as cricket, is just as important to the British raceas the performance of Shakespeare. I think the two things go togetherin making us what we are. The English lord and the London busdriver both regard Hobbs as their common property. They watch theweather with equal anxiety before a test match." Things of the spirit and grace, and courtesy, are not merelyvaluable traits of our character. They are the things that distinguishus from other races, and enrich our whole lives. Demands by somesections that racing should be restricted will be discussed at a Premiers'Conference in Canberra early in the new year. Ample powers forcontrol of racing are vested in the States and if there is to be anyregulation of racing the States should be the responsible authority totake uniform action." AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION.INQUIRY INTO FINANOES.On 21st November, 1941, the Minister for Aircraft Production( Senator Cameron) said that Mr. W. T. Harris, of the Sub-Treasury,Melbourne, had been appointed full-time finance member of the AircraftCommission and had been asked to go thoroughly into the Commissionand make a report.

A shortage of the imported prdduct vill resulf: inan extension of the use of locally manufactured material. This representsyet another step in Australia's policy of maximum self-sufficiency,"WAR-TIME PROFITS TAX.PROPOSED COMMITTEE.In Parliament.-On 21st November, 1941, the Prime Minister( Mr. Curtin) said-" I give Mr. Holt, an assurance that the suggestion that aParliamentary Committee on war-time profits tax legislation be set upwill receive the most sympathetic consideration. I had hoped that: sucha committee would hav* e been established last year. Mr. Holt is nodoubt aware that representatives were actually named by the Oppositionto sit on such a committee. It was subsequently discovered, however,that the activities of the proposed committee were to be restricted toan examination of the sales tax measures of the Government. I hadhoped that it would be empowered to make a general review of theGovernment's taxation arrangements."WOOL AGREEMENT.REVIEW NOT MADE.In. Parliament.-On 21st November, 1941, the Minister for theInterior, on behalf of the Minister for Commerce ( Mr. Scully), said.-" The Government finds that the understanding between the UnitedKingdom and Australian Governments is that the price of wool may bereviewed in May of each year. The Government has also ascertainedthat the previous Government failed to initiate any such review. Onaccount of this failure it may not be possible to arrange any changein the price until the 1942-3 clip. The Government at present has thismatter under consideration."( For earlier references, please see No. 3, page 8.)ARMY INVENTIONS BOARD.MINISTER TO REVIEW.' On 22nd November, 1941, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Forde)said he intended to review the present set-up of the InventionsBoards and particularly the Army Head-quarters Inventions Sectionwith a view to ensuring a more expeditious consideration of submissions.Six hundred inventions a week were submitted to the inventionssection of the Army.

LEASE-LEND NEGOTIATIONS.On 23rd November, 1941, the Prime Minister'( Mr. Curtin) said-There is no substance in the suggestions made that there have. been hitches in Lease-Lend negotiations between the United Statesand Australia, caused by the change of Government in Australia. TheUnited States-Government ' has not asked the Commonwealth Governmentto give guarantees not to expand or establish new industries inAustralia because of the benefits being derived by Australia underLease-Lend from the United States. The undertakings given by theUnited Kingdom Government to the United States Government arefully set out in the White Paper which was issued on 10th September.1941. The decisions embodied in this White Paper were made byPresident Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill during the period when theywere drawing up the Atlantic Charter in August, 1941." Discussions are proceeding in the United States concerning sur-Jplus products, particularly on the effect of the supply of primary productsby the United ' States to the United Kingdom under Lease-Lendon the marketing of Australian primary products in surplus production.'

Re has attended meetings ofteBritish War Cabinet; had consultations and discussions withMinisters and has had regular contact with the Prime Minister. Hehas met him separately and also in the War Cabinet. Sir Earle Page iFsnot a member of the British War Cabinet, but has attended meetingsof it. As I have said before, Sir Earle Page is an accredited representativeof the Australian Government to the British Government torepresent our views on war policy. The British Prime Minister saidhe would be pleased to receive him. Communications I have received
from Sir Earle rage intim.* a ' te* that he, ' w' a* s received mst cordially andthat every facility was given to him to carry out his mission-whichwas to state the Australian Government's views on war policy inGreat Britain. There is no occasion to define Sir Earle Page'sposition. He is the representative of the Australian GoverlirnentA. andnot my personal representative. He was nominated by the preiiousGovern * ment to proceed to England and we authorized him to continuehis mission. He is the spokesman for the Australian Government.Both Mr. Churchill and Sir Earle Page have expressed satisfactionwith the position and until either of them finds the present positionunsatisfactory, I do not propose taking any notice of Lord Davies."( For earlier references, please see No. 2, page 12.)GENERAL SIR THOMAS BLAMEY.RETURN TO MIDDLE EAST.On 24th November, 1941, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Forde)said-" General Sir Thomas Blarney, General Officer Commanding theAustralian Imperial Force in the Middle East, will leave later thisweek for the Middle East."( For earlier references, please see No. 4, page 3; No. 5, pageOWEN SUB-MACHINE GUN.CONFERENCE ON PRODUCTION.On 24th November, 1941, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Forde)said-" The conference to-day on the Owen gun was completely satisfactory,and a number of points which were holding up productionwere cleared up. I believe that the facto~ ry will be in full swingproducing the gun within a week or so. The first order is for 2,000guns, but I have no doubt that further orders will be given. I amsatisfied that the gun is an efficient weapon and it is the Government'saim to see that our men are given an adequate supply of modernequipment at least equal to the best our enemies can produce. -Thequestion of paying royalty to Mr. Owen did not arise. It is a matteron which the Government will give an equitable decision. Mr. Owenis at present concentrating on getting the gun into production, and hasnot worried about royalties."

The policy of the Government is to ensure the speediest impartial decisionin respect of industrial grievances. Any such grievances which you represent , tome will have my immediate attention followed by action.' On your part I request that your influence be exerted fully in ensuring thatno stoppage of production occurs anywhere. My information is that lastfortnight approximately, 00,000 tons more coal would have been produced butfor stoppages which were avoidable and in my view should not have happened..' Two things are paramount with the Labour Government, namely justicefor the workers and victory in the war.

" I am invoking the valuable assistance of the Auditor-General andhis officers to assist me in seeingthatno payments for royalties or right akin thereto aremade by the Commonwealth unless they are fully justifiedby the law and the facts; andthat so far as possible payments which have been madewithout sound legal foundation are disgorged.After I have had an opportunity of making a more completeinvestigation I shall be in a position of throwing further light."( For earlier references, please see No. 4, pageAUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES.TEMPERANOE DEPUTATION.On 25th November, 1941, a deputation representing the Australian-Temperance Council waited upon the Mipister for the Army ( Mr.Forde) and urged that the Government should reconsider the policy ofhaving wet canteens in military camps; extend facilities for the useand sale of fruit juices for troops at Darwin and abroad; increase hostelaccommodation and recreation facilities for troops, and have militarycontrol of hotels near military camps; prohibit the sale of intoxicatingliquor to soldiers and women in uniform; prohibit, for liquor advertisingpurposes, pictures showing soldiers, sailors, airmen and womenin uniform. Mr. Forde said the matters were of major policy andwould be submitted to Cabinet.BANKING CONTROL.WAR-TIME REGULATIONS.On 26th November, 1941;-the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin). said-The National Security ( War-time Banking Control) Regulations,tabled in Parliament to-day, give effect to the Government's decisions,as outlined in the recent financial statement, to bring the operationsof the trading banks under effective war-time control. The Regulationsimplement certain recommendations of the Royal Commission on theMonetary and Banking Systems and make other provisions to meetthe present conditions of war finance. Before finalizing the regulationsthe Government had conferences with the representatives of the tradinghanks and the Commonwealth Bank.It is generally agreed that the private banks play such an importantpart in our financial system that control of their activities isessential to an effective war finance policy. Experience elsewhere confirmsthis view and in the United Kingdom, United States of Americaand other countries the authorities , have exercised greatly increaseddirection of banking and financial policy generally.The Regulations are planned primarily to achieve two purposes.Firstly, they ensure that the investment and loan policy of the banksshould accord with the general principle laid down to govern civilinvestment, thus closing a major gap hitherto existing. Secondly,
they are designed to prevent the war financial policy of the Governmentincreasing the. profits of the private banks and providing the basisfor an-unsound expahsion of credit.To aciieve these purposes the regulations provide that the banks,in making advances and linvestments, shall comply with the policy laiddown by' tie. o ii'nwqbe alth Bank from time to time and provide alsothat the trading-bank . shall lodge in a special account with the Commonwealth'Bank,a. substantial part of the increase in their total assetssince' August, 1939. It is. intended that surplus investible funds whichaccrue in the -future shall also be lodged with the CommonwealthBank. These funds will remain the property of the private banks andwill bear interest to lie paid. by the Commonwealth Bank&gt;: The rateof interest payable will be, determined by the , Commonwealth Bankbut itmay not exceed a maximum rate fixed. by the Treasurer.." The trading banks are required . also to provide such informationand returns, as are necessary to the Commonwealth Bank and theTreasurer œ for . the purposes of the regulations. The accounts of thebanks will, b. e. in. vatigated periodically by the Auditor-General.bdli'ev&amp; that' ' i'hse Regulations mark a definite step forward.Not only can we be assured that the operations of the financial systemwill, iiifutitre,' b directed wholly towards our common national purposes,-ut'iiW: e bcanfiel even more confident than before of the stabilityof that system." One important effect of the Regulations is that the' Government.and the Commonwealth Bank will now be in a position to ensure thatevery private bank follows a policywhich will operate in the nationalinterest and at the same time provide additional safeguards for thesecurity of the deposits of the public with the banks. In concise terms,the Regulations provide--1. Within three weeks of the coimencement of the Regulations all privatebanks will be'licenied bly-the Governor-General.,,. 2.. 2, rijg te ; bankto beplicensed will be the Ballarat Banking, Co.

The ' Governor-General may withdraw a bank's licence only on a HighCourt judge's recorimen'dations.Private banks can make advances only in accordance with CommonwealthBank policy. Subscriptions ' to loans and the purchase of securities by private banksmust be made only with the prior consent of the Commonwealth Bank.0. The Commonwealth Bank, in accordance with general principles approvedby the Treasurer, -will determine what portion of the private banks' surplusfunds available for' inestment are to be deposited in a special account,7. Surplus funds, available for investment mean . the amount by which abank's, total assets ' at any time exceed the average of the total assets on theweekly balancing. days ih"-August, 1939.8. Interest is. to be paid by the Commonwealth Bank to banks -on theirbalances in the speqial account at a. rate not above the maximum fixed by theTreahur. asn&amp; desidge'd" td eisure that the banks' profits shall not exceed theaverage foi; tIth ree, yirended: August 31, 1939.
9. Private banks' balance-sheets and profit and loss accounts will be publishedin a' form specified by the Treasurer. More detailed profit and loss accountsshall be furnished to the Treasurer through the Commonwealth Bank.The Treasurer and the Commonwealth Bank shall be furnished withsuch statements of private banks' business as required but not details ofindividual customers' accounts.11. The Auditor-General is empowered periodically, and as directed by theTreasurer, to inspect the books, accounts and transactions of the privatebanks and report to the Commonwealth Bank and the Treasurer.12. Exemptions from the Regulations may be made by the Treasurer.An exemption from the Regulations is being granted for twomonths to all institutions ( other than the private banks referred to)which are, or appear to be, carrying on in Australia the business ofbanking. This exemption will cover the Launceston and HobartSavings Banks, also pastoral companies and other institutions whichcarry on some banking functions. This temporary exemption will givetime for inquiry and consideration as to whether any of these institutionsshould be brought within the Regulations.It will be seen that the Treasurer will work in close collaborationwith the Commonwealth Bank in administering the Regulations.Broadly, the powers the Regulations confer are divided almost evenlybetw9en the Treasurer and the Commonwealth Bank with joint powersin some instances.The Regulations mean that banking will be subject to the samekind of control as are all other phases of our national life that arevital to the war effort." In future a person or corporation ( other than a bank of theCommonwealth or of any State) shall not carry on the business ofbanking except under licence from the Governor-General."( For earlier references, please see No. 1, page 24; No. 3, page 22; No.pageNEW GUINEA.ENTRY INTO UNCONTROLLED AREAS.:On .26th November, 1941, the Minister for External .

If Mr.Clark, will supply to the Prices Commissioner information asto any transaction of that kind, suitable action will be taken:."SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENT.In Parliament.-On 27th. November, 1941, the Treasurer ( Mr.Chifley) said-" In my financial statement of the 29th October, 1941, I set outthe financial proposals of the Government. Certain ameiidments tothe" proposal relating to taxation have been made by Parliai~ it Ishall biiefly summarize these amendments, and show their effect onthe budget for 1941-42." It was proposed that the taxable incomes of husbands and wivesshould be aggregated in order to determine the rate of tax to be paidby both husband and wife on their taxable incomes. This proposalwas considerably modified, and the new principle of aggregation' forrating purposes will operate only in respect of income fioin assetstransferred after the 29th October, 1941, by a husband to his wife ifthe taxable income of the wife exceeds œ 200." The Government' had proposed to remove the present exemptionso as to provide that dividends received by Australian residents fromcompanies,; the profits, of which are derived wholly or partly from outsideAustralia, should be -taxable in the hands of the recipients. Byan amendment dividends from. this source which were receiv&amp; l priorto the 29th October, 1941, will not be subject to tax.
" It was proposed to discontinue the practice of allowing as deductionsin arriving at taxable income calls paid on shares in miningcompanies. The law has been amended by Parliament. This meansthat the value of the tax concession on mining calls will be approximately.the same as the concession which was enjoyed before the war.The ' Government had proposed that the war-time" company taxshould be amended to provide for a statutory percentage of 4 per cent..and that the commencing rate of tax should be 6 per cent.' until amaximum rate of 78 per cent. is reached on the taxable profit in excessof 16 per cent. on capital employed. The Government accepted anamendment and the commencing rate of tax will now be' 5' per cent.progressing by 6 per cent. steps for every 1 per cent: boh capital'employedby . which profits are in excess of the statutory percentAge of 5 percent. on capital employed until a maximum rate of 78 per'cent. isreached' on ' the taxable profit in excess of 17 per cent. on capitalemployed. The effect of these alterations is to reduce the estimated revenuefor 194142 by œ 1,800,000, viz.:--Estimate of Revised29th October, Reduction.

AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES.STRATEGIC ROAD CONSTRUCTION.On 1st Decemiber, 1941, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Forde)said-" The important strategic route joining Western. Queenstnd andthe North-South road is rapidly nearing completion. The road will betrafficable for at least nine months of the year, hut if seasons arefavorable, it will he traversible for the whole twelve months."On 5th December, 1941, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) said-" War Cabinet to-day gave consideration to the question of theconstruction of roads of strategic and operational impoirtance. It wasdecided to proceed with all-weather strategic roads as follows:Northern Command ( Queensland), œ 616,000; Eastern Command ( NewSouth Wales), œ 15,000; Western Goummand ( Western Australia),œ 17,000. Cabinet's decision will be * referred to the Co-ordinator-General of. Works ( Sir Harry Brown), who will confer with the Statesand submit proposals for the apportionment of the financial -responsibilitybetween the Commonwealth and States, while the States'construction authorities will be consulted-regarding constructiondetails." ( For earlier references, please see No. 8, page 22.)GLEADALL BOMB.On 6th December, 1941, Mr. Forde said -he had interested himselfin a number of new bombs invented by Staff-Sergeant L. R. Gleadall,of Brisbane. Demonstrations had been c arried out that day. He saidthe inventions obviously possessed great merit and would fulfil the needfor weapons which sections of fighting forces had been seeking. He wasanxious that they be tested as soon as possible with a view to puttingthem into production. NO EXPORT OF RIFLES.On 10th December, 1941, Mr. Forde said-I " No rifles have been exported to other countries since I have beenMinister for the Army-exc-ept to the Australian Imperial Force.Now, all the rifles that are beiug turned out are being used by ourtroops."MILITIA TRANSFERS TO AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL FORCE.On 12th December, 1941, Mr. Forde referred to criticism of thedecision to. retain in the Australian Military Forces, men who weredesirous of enlisting for overseas service. He said that, by the calling-upof all units for full-time duty, the training of men who were alreadyin Militia units would be carried on without a break and eventuallythey would be trained as portions of formed units. Their trainingwould not be disrupted, and there would be but a deferment of theprocesses of medical examination, enlistment, and transfer to theAustralian Imperial * Force recruit training depots, all of whida
normally occupied considerable time and expenditure. Men who hadnotified their desire to serve overseas were being placed on special listswhich would be held by units, and the men would be shown as havingbeen posted to the Australian Imperial Force reserve. When theoccasion warranted, the men could be readily transferred to AustralianImperial Force reinforcements. The action taken was based on arecommnendation by the Government's military advisers in view of thegravity of the international situation, and was deemed to be in thebest interests of the defence of the country, which overruled all personalconsiderations. UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.On 13th December, 1941, the Minister for War Organization ofIndustry ( Mr. Dedman) said that the Government's aim was to ensurethat universities trained students in the tasks most urgently needed.Those completing courses essential to the war effort would not be subjectto military service, bitt those doing unessential courses would be calledup. ( For earlier references, please see No. 5, page 24.)CHRISTMAS DINNER.On 13th December, 1941, Mr. Forde announced that a specialChristmas dinner would be provided for Australian troops who werein camps, forts or garrisons on that day. A substantial increase hadbeen approved in the messing allowance for troops on Christmas Dayso that arrangements could be made for the special meal. Hospitalcases and convalescent men in Australia, the Middle East and Malayawould receive an individual Red Cross Christmas parcel.SEASONAL WORKERS.On 13th December, 1941, Mr. Forde said that men who had beengranted leave fromn military training for harvest operations and thosewhose training ' had previously been deferred for essential work inconnexion with timber, flax, textile and the colliery industries, would berendering the utmost service to the war effort by remaining at theircivilian occupations until, and unless, called for.( For earlier references, please see No. 2, page 8.)USE OF MILITIA OVERSEAS.On 15th December, 1941, Mr. Forde said-" The Government has no intention of sending members of theAustralian Militia Forces to any points outside Australia except toCommonwealth territories or terriitories under the control of theCommonwealth Government. There is no necessity to do so. Membersof the Militia Forces are enlisted for the'defence of Australia.Australian Imperial Force men are recruited for overseas* service.Members of the Militia Forces will be trained ' and used exclusivelyfor the defence of Australia and its territories. They cannot he usedfor any other purpose except by an amendment of the AustralianDefence Act-which the Government does not intend to make, becausethere is no necessity."
EXEMPTIONS FROM SERVICE.On 16th December, 1941, Mr. Forde said-A review was recently made of those exemiptions granted to ClassI military trainees ( single men up to 35) employed in industries notdirectly associated with the war effort. In the past very, few men incertain trades have been called up but now that it has been decidedto place the Militia on a war footing, it follows that m-ore skilledtradesmen will be called upon. That is unavoidable if efficiency inthe Army is to be brought to its highest level. The review has beennecessary because many units requiring tradesmen have been maintainedpreviously in cadre form, but are now being brought to full strength.The list of reserved occupations order is still, and will continue to be,rigidly applied and instructions have been issued that not only menentitled to exemptions, but those whose training had been deferredby order of the Adjutant-General, to enable production of urgentlyrequired materials and equipment, will not be called up unless requiredto serve in their usual capacity in the forces. It is possible that manyitien who have just been called up in Class 1 have gone over to warindustries since they registered, and had been called up on particularsp~ rev'iously furnished. If it were known that they were in warindustries they should not have becn called up. 1 emphasized that everymnan wvhosqe age or condition, regardless of his occupation, brought hintwithin Class 2 or Class;. 3 as defined by the proclamation of December 11,1941. is required to register." SEASIDE AREAS.On 15th December, 1941, Mr. Forde said that in any areas wherethere were forts or military establishments, strict regulations, guardsand fences would prevent the public entering these places and he hadno dloubt that residents would closely observe any blackout, lightingrestriction or other necessary restrictions.PRISONERS OF WAR.RED CROSS FACILITIES.On 2nd Decenmber, 1941, the Minister for the Army ( Mr. Forde)vannounced that he had authorized a contribittion of œ 750 to be.dcspatehed through the Australian Red Cross to the British Red Crossto provide further educational and recreational facilities forA ustralian prisoners in enemy countries.( For earlier references, please see No. 1, page 23; No. 5, page 13.)APPLES AND PEARS.ACQUISITION PLAN ADOPTED.On 3rd December, 1941, the Minister assisting the Minister for-Commerce ( Senator Fraser) said-" The Government has decided to acquire the apple and pear cropaf the coming season and dispose of it on behalf of the growers. At the.8276-2
seame time, the Government has decided upon certain reforms both inthe scheme itself and in its administration. The Government wasgreatly influenced by the unanimous report of the Joint ParliamentaryCommittee which investigaited the industry, and the best means ofsupporting it during the war. The Government has been impressed bythe fact that, although the committee found faults in both -the schemeand its administration, nevertheless the committee recommended continuanceof acquisition as the best form of government intervention.Therefore, in spite of all difficulties and disadvantages, the Governmenthas decided upon a scheme of acquisition. The Government expectsthat next year's plans will operate with much more satisfaction toAustralia than the schemes of either of the previous years. Unless theGovernment finds reasons of governmental importance to the contraryat Lany time, it will adopt as a general guide--and will require theMarketing Board to adopt as a guide-the report and recommendationsof the committee." The ' Government earnestly hopes that, whilst affording reasonablecompensation to producers for their fruit, the scheme -will also provemore beneficial to consumers. Every effort will be made to see thatthere is a wider and more efficient distribution of fruit. It is proposedthat acquisition will commence on 1st January, 1942. In the meantime,details of the new plan will be worked out and necessary instructionsgiven to the Maeteting Board in regard to its operation."( For earlier references, please see No. 9, page 9.)INDUSTRIAL MATTERS.DILUTION OF LABOUR REGULATIONS.On 3rd December, 1941, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Ward)announced that an amendment bad been made to the National Security( Engineering Trades Dilution) Regulations to provide for the paymentof full tradesmen's rates to all engineering trades apprentices in theirfifth year of service. Under an amendment to these regulations made inOctober, 1941, it was provided that full tradesmen's rates should bepaid to fifth-year apprentices of employers who were employing addedengineering tradesmen. It was found in practice that the effect ofthis provision was to discourage employers from employing addedtradesmen, as the employment of even one added tradesman would 1involve them in the payment of full tradesmen's rates to all their fifthrear:.apprentices. This was having an adverse effect on the placementof trainees turned out under the Commonwealth Technical TrainingScheme. Under the regulations as now amended, all employers offifth-year engineering apprentices will be placed on the same basis,and there will be no financial inducement to employeirs to refrain fromco-operating in the engineering trades dilution scheme.( For earlier references, please see No. 2, page 14; No. 3, page 11; No.page 17; No. 6, page 9.)
COAL-MINING INDUSTRY.REGULATIONS ALTERED.On 3rd December, 1941, the Minister for Labour ( Mr. Ward)said-" I tender my thanks to the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) andi theAttorney-General ( Dr. Evatt) for their valuable assistance in givingeffect to plans for improving the industrial arbitration system.-TheGovernment has had under consideration for some time amendmentsto the National Security ( Coal Mining Industry Employment) Regulationsto provide for more expeditious handling of disputes as theyarise in order to ensure that production in this very important warindustry shall be continuous. Many stoppages have occurred and muchdissatisfaction has manifested itself due to delays in hearing mattersand arriving at decisions. Experience showed that amendments of theexisting regulations were necessary and as a result of conferencesbetween Mr. Curtin, Dr. Evatt and myself, amendments were to-dayapproved to give effect to the following:-Extension of the powers of Local Reference Boards to enablethem to settle any disputes as to local matters, that is, matters whichspecially affect employees in the locality in which a Board is established.The present power of a Local Reference Board extends only tosettlement lby conciliation. Thc proposed provision will enable theLocal Reference Board to hear and determine such matters. Matterswhich are not local shall be dealt with by the Central Reference Board.Provision is also made to provide for the appointment of a ConciliationCommissioner to be Acting Chairman of the Central ReferenceBoard during the illness, or absence from any other cause, of theChairman, providing that a Judge of the Arbitration Court is notavailable for appointment as Acting Chairman."REGULATIONS AMENDEDOn 16th December, 1941, the Attorney-General ( Dr. Evatt) said-" The Minister for Labour ( Mr. Ward) has discovered that, in aniumber of cases, the proceedings of Local Reference Boards under theNational Security ( Coal-mining Industry Employment) Regulationshave been delayed. Those regulations were recently amended to preventappeals from decisions of Local Reference Boards, except where theboard was exceeding its jurisdiction by dealing with a matter of'general import in the industry. At the same time, provision was madein the regulations to compel the chairman of the Local Reference Boardto hold up the hearing and to refer to the Central Reference Board, atthe instance of any member of the board; representative of employers;representative of employees, any question as to whether a matter wasone of local or general application." In Mr. Ward's view, this power to compel has been exercised fartoo frequently and, in the future, it is proposed that it will he in the( liscret-nn of the chairman of a Local Reference Board as to whether
any such question should be referred to the Central Referene Board,which will then have power to determine whether it or the LocalReference Board should deal with the matter. During the presentperiod of crisis, Mr. Ward will take every step necessary to preventindustrial tribunals from being delayed in the hearing and determinationof industrial disputes. Mr. Ward considers that the amendmentwhich has been made to the regulations to make the power of chairmenof Local Reference Boards discretionary only, will be a factor inpreventing delay.A further amendment has been made to the National Security( Industrial Peace) Regulations to ensure that the settlement of therecent dispute in the coal-mining industry with respect to annual leave,which was given by the Conciliation Commissioner ( Mr. D. B.Morrison), would not be disturbed. The amending regulation will giveto Mr. Morrison's decision the same effect as if it had been an award ofthe Central Reference Board and his decision will not, therefore, beliable tobe upset by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court."*( For earlier references, please see No. 1, page 14; No. 2, page 14; No. 7,page 18; No. 8, pages 14-15.)ACQUISITION OF STOCKS.On 12th December, 1941, the Minister for Supply ( Mr. Beasley)announced regulations for the compulsory acquisition of all coal stocksin New South Wales, and for the fixing of prices of coal throughoutAustralia as from 15th December, 194-1. The Coal -Commissioner willhave power to-Terminate all existing contracts for the supply of coal toother States.Acquire by compulsion all coal at New South Wales pitsfor export to other States.Fix all future prices for the purchase and resale of coal.Limit rates of profit from all coal-mines or group of mines.Insist that colliery waggons be made available for thecarriage of coal from any pit, even if it is not the pitof the owner of the colliery waggons.Fix prices for coal for consumption within New SouthWales.Grade all coal into classes such as gas and tail coal, and,supply interstate buyers with coal of special qualityinstead of coal from certain mines.Pay for all coal compulsorily acquired at the averagecolliery prices ruling on 1st December, 1940, plus anyauthorized increases granted by the Prices Commissioner.Compel collieries to render accounts of interstate saleseach month, so that prices can be adjusted wherenecessary.
COMMISSION APPOINTED.On 12th December, 1941, the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) said-The Government has approved of the formation of the CoalCommission to control the supply, production, distribution and all othermatters affecting coal.

For no othercountry which could have made war in the Pacific desired war. SinceFebruary of. this year the problem of the Pacific has been one ofconstant anxiety to the Government of Australia and to the governmentsof the democracies.Hit without warning brings its own retaliation. Men and womenof Australia: The stern truth is that Japan commenced. a war in thePacific in which our security and our vital int-. ests are at stake. I ask
the people of Australia to give the best that they can in the service ofthis country. The fighting forces are a t battle stations. Every otheirman and woman should be at some place of usefulness." The Australian Government has taken immediate steps thismorning, according to plan, to do everything necessary. for the defenceof Australian, British and United States interests. Thb ServiceMinisters and the Service Chiefs have acted promptly, as have otherdepartments connected with internal Security.

That has happened because, in thefirst instance, Japanese naval and air forces launched an unprovokedattack on British and United States territory; because our vitalinterests are imperilled and because the rights of free people in thewhole Pacific are assailed. As a result, the Australian Government
this afternoon took the necessary steps which will mean that astate of war exists between Australia and Japan. To-morrow, incommon with the United Kingdom, the United States and the NetherlandsEast Indies Governments, the Australian Government willformally and solemnly declare the state of war it has striven so sincerelyand strenuously to avoid.Throughout the whole affair, and despite discouragement, theAustralian Government and its representatives abroad struggled hardto prevent a breakdown of discussions. Australia encouraged theUnited States to retain the diplomatic initiative on behalf of thedemocratic Powers. We did not want war in the Pacific. TheAustralian Government has repeatedly made it clear-as have theGovernments of the United Kingdom, the United States and theNetherlands East Indies-that if war came to the Pacific it. would beof Japan's making. Japan has now made war." I point out that the hands of the democracies are clean. Thediscussions and negotiations which have taken place between Japanand the democracies were not merely empty bandying of words onthe democracies' part. Since last February it has been the constantaim and endeavour of the democracies to keep peace in the Pacific.It has been a problem fraught with grave difficulties but, in theview of the democracies, it was a problem that was capable of beingovercome. Accordingly, the best brains of the democracies werebrought to bear on the problem. It will stand on record that thePresident of the United States himself, the American Secretary ofState ( Mr. Cordell Hull), the British and the Dominion Governmentsworked untiringly and unceasingly. Yet, when the President of theUnited States had decided to communicate direct to the JapaneseEmperor a personal appeal for Imperial intervention on the sideof peace, the war Government of Japan struck. That war Government,set on aggression and lusting for power in the . same fashionas its Axis partners, anticipated thie undoubted weight of thePresident's plea and shattered the century-old friendship betweenthe two countries.For the first time in the history of the Pacific, armed conflictstalks abroad. No other country but Japan desired war in thePacific. The guilt for plunging this hemisphere into actual warfare is,therefore, upon Japan. The recapitulation of events I have given youis necessary so that we in Australia may correctly assess the issuesinvolved. The stern truth is that war has been forced upon us, notbecause of stubborn resistance on the part of the democracies to everydemand that Japan made, but because Japan chose the method ofarmed might to settle differences which every other country involvedwas ready and willing to settle by negotiation and arbitration. Japan,by so doing, chose the Hitler method. While its diplomatic representativeswere actually at the White House; while all the democraticPowers regarded the conversations as continuing; Japan ignored theconvention of a formal declaration of war and struck like an assassasinin the night.
For, as the dawn broke this morning, at places as far apart asHonolulu, Nauru, Ocean Island, Guam, Singapore' and British Malaya,guns from Japanese warships; bombs from Japanese aircraft; shotsfrom Japanese military forces struck death to United States citizensand members of its defence forces; to the peaceful subjects of GreatBritain and to her men on ships and on the land. The Pacific Oceanwas reddened with the blood of Japanese victims. These wantonkillings will be followed by attacks on the Netherlands East Indies;on the Commonwealth of Australia; on the Dominion of New Zealand;if Japan can get its brutal way.Australia, therefore, being a nation that believes in a way oflife whichb has freedom and liberty as its corner stones goes to thebattle stations in defence of the free way of living. Our course isclear, our cause is just-as has been the case ever since September,1939, when we stood in the path of IHitlerism and declared that wewould stand out to the end against ruthless an ' d wanton aggression.I say, then, to the people of Australia: Give of your best in theservice of the nation. There is a place and part for all of us. Eachmust take his or her place in the service of the nation, for the nationitself is in peril. This is our darkest hour. Let that be fully realized.Our efforts in the -past two years must be as nothing compared withthe efforts we must now put forward." I can give you the assurance that the Australian Government isfully prepared. It has ' been in readiness for whatever eventuality, andlast Friday the initial steps were taken and fully car. ried out. Fromearly this morning the Service Ministers of the Cabinet and the Chiefsof the fighting Services have done everything that has to -be done bythem. The War Cabinet met and put into effect the plan devised forour protection. This afternoon, the full Cabinet met and I am ableto announce to you prompt decisions on a : wide variety of mattersallof them vital to the new war organization that confronts us.All leave for members of the fighting Forces has been cancelled.An extension of the present partial mobilization of Navy, Army andAir Forces is being prepared. The Minister for Home Security will,to-morrow, confer with Army authorities on air' raid precautions.Regulations will be issued to prohibit the consumption of petrol forpurposes of pleasure. A conference will. be held ' by the Minister forSupply, with oil companies on ' the storage of fuel and the security ofthat storage. Arrangements will be made for all work on services thatare essential nationally to be continued on public holidays in future,while, in this connexion, all transport services will be concentratedupon necessary purposes. The Minister for Labour will leave forDarwin immediately to organize the labour supply there. Anexamination will . be made to ascertain what retail establishmentsshould continue to trade after 6 p. m.-so, as to conserve light, coal,transport services.
" These are some of the things decided upon quickly, but in noatmosphere of panic. There are other things that the Governmenthas done. These, by their nature, are secret. But, in total, what hasbeen done to-day adds up to complete provision for the safety of thenation. " Tb-morrow, the War Cabinet will meet again, as will the AustralianWar -Council, when the Leader of the Opposition and hiscolleagues will -be fully appraised of every phase of the position. TheParliament of the -Commonwealth will assemble on Tuesday of nextweek. " One thing remains, and on it depends our very lives. That thingis the co-operation, the strength, and the will-power of you, the people.Without it we are, indeed, lost. Men and women of Australia: Thecall is to you, for your courage; your physical and mental ability; yourinflexible determination that we, as a nation of free people, shallsurvive. My appeal to you is in the name of Australia, for Australiais the stake in this conflict. The thread of peace has snapped-onlythe valour of our fighting Forces, hacked by the very uttermost ofwhich we are capable in factory and workshop, can knit that threadagain into security'. -Let there be no idle hand. The road of serviceis ahead. Let us all tread it firmly, victoriously.We here, in this spacious land where, for more than 150 years,peace and security have prevailed, are now called upon to meet theexternal aggressor. -The enemy presses from without. I have saidthat our forces! are at their battle stations. They are not alone. lItis true that Japan is not alone. But, as I speak to you to-night, theUnited States; Great Britain and her colonies and dominions, whichinclude the Commonwealth of Australia -and the Dominion of NewZealand; the great federation of Russian republics; the NetherlandsEast Indies and. China, are associated in the common cause of prcservingfor free men and free women not only their inheritance, butevery hope they have of decency and dignity and liberty.We Australians have imperishable traditions. We shall maintainthem. We shall vindicate them. We shall hold this country andkeep it as a citadel for the British-speaking race and as a place wherecivilization will-persist." Men and women of Australia: It is my duty to sound a toosin tI proclaim a call unto you. I do it in the words of Swinhurne--"' Come -forth, be born and live,.Thou that hast help to give,And light to mnake man's day of manhood fair,With flight outfiying the sphered sun,Hasten thine hourAnd halt not till thy work ' be done.'"
STATE OF WAR.On 9th December, 1941, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.Evatt) said-" Instructions have been sent to the Charge d'Affaires ( Mr. Officer),Australian Legation, Tokio, to inform the Imperial Japanese Governmentthat a state of war exists and has existed between His Majesty'sGovernment in the Commonwealth of Australia and the ImperialJapanese Government, as from 5 o'clock in the afternoon, 8th December,1941. I have also received a formal call this afternoon from theJapanese Minister to Australia ( Mr. Kawal) and have submitted tohim a communication which related the notification which has beensent to the Imperial Japanese Government."MESSAGE TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.On 12th December, 1941, the Minister for External Affairs ( Dr.Evatt), in communicating formally to the United States Governmentthe declaration of war by the Commonwealth of Australia againstJapan, conveyed the following message to President Roosevelt onbehalf of the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) and the CommonwealthGovernment. I desire to express our profound appreciation of the initiative,courage and patience displayed by the President and Secretary of Statein their endeavours to prevent war in the Pacific and in their objectiveof outlawing force as on instrument of national policy." For the time being the attempt to maintain Pacific peace oii abasis of law and justice has been checked by the sudden and treacherousattack of the Japanese forces while diplomiatic negotiations wereactually proceeding. The Commonwealth is hionoured to be associatedwith the United States in resisting the aggressors until they are finallyoverthrown and until the principles for which the President has sofrequently declared are established, not only in the Pacific, but everywherein the world."In reply, President Roosevelt sent the following message to Dr.Evstt, to be conveyed to Mr. Cumtin:" Please send my best wishes to the Government and the people ofAustralia. We did our utmost to keep the peace in the Pacific butour enemies had decided on aggression beforehand. This is now aworld war in the true secse. We are in it wvith you and you will notfind uts wanting. I need not tell the Australians to keep a stout heart.I know that you will. We will win."
PARLIAMENT APPROVES.On 16th December, 1941, the House of Representatives, on themotion of Mr. Curtin, and the Senate, on the motion of the Ministerfor the Interior ( Senator Collings), approved the following resolutionunanimously. " That this House approves of the action of His Majesty's Governmentin the Commonwealth in ha * g advised the issue of proclamationsdeclaring the existence of a state f~ war with Japan, Finland, Hungaryand Rumania. Further, this Ho se hereby pledges itself to take everystep deemed necessary to defend this Commonwealth and its territories,to carry on hostilities in association -with our allies, and to achievefinal victory over our enemies."~WHEAT POOLS PAYMENTS.1941-42 CROP FIRST ADVANCE.On 15th December, 1941, the Minister for Commerce Scully)said that the Government had approved of the first advance on wheatof the 1941-42 crop at the rate of 3s. a bushel, less freight, for baggedwheat, and 2s. 10d. a bushel, less freight, for bulk wheat. This wouldinvolve œ 21,000,000. The Government had arranged with the CommonwealthBank for the provision of the necessary funds. The AustralianWheat Board was conferring with the Commonwealth Bank regardingthe machinery measures necessary for payment and it was anticipatedthat these arrangements would he completed to enable payment to bemade towards the end of this month. About 142,000,000 bushels wouldbe acquired this season, of which 80,000,000 bushels would be bulkand 62,000,000 bushels bagged. The crop was the first to feel thereal impact of war. Market prospects were not good, the only certainoutlet during the next twelve months being that for 32,000,000 bushelswhich would be required in Australia. Because it appeared that asecond advance from sales would not be justified for a considerableperiod the Government had fixed the initial advance at the utmost thatcould be paid.( For earlier references, please see No. 3, page 11; No. 4, page 13, No. 6, pageBy Author~ ty L F.
