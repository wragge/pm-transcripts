PRESS STATEMENT NO. 338<br />
26 September 1974<br />
TARIFF BOARD REPORT FIBREBOARD CONTAINERS, PAPER AND<br />
TEXTILE BAGS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced today that<br />
the Government has accepted the recommendations of the<br />
Tariff Board in its report on Fibreboard Containers, Paper<br />
and Textile Bags.<br />
The Government's decision to implement the Board's<br />
recommendations will mean that a General rate of duty of<br />
will apply to boxes, bags and other packing containers of paper<br />
or paperboard. Existing ad valorem rates of duty, including<br />
primage, range from 24% to 47% approximately. The Board<br />
recommended that the existing rate of duty on corrugated<br />
fibreboard remain unchanged at 30% or, if lower, $ 48.225 per<br />
tonne. It is not expected that there will be any significant<br />
changes in the industry as a result of the Government's decision<br />
because of the substantial natural protection afforded local<br />
production. Mr W~ hitlam. said that details of the Customs tariff<br />
changes arising from the Government's decision will be announced<br />
when administrative arrangements to implement them have been<br />
finalised.<br />
