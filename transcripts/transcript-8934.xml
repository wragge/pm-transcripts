TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING<br />
ABC RADIO " PM" PROGRAM, 13 AUGUST, 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
MB: Well, Prime Minister, welcome to PM. Wayne Goss today said the<br />
Federal Government should validate all title back to 1788. Mining<br />
companies are concerned about their investments and Aboriginal<br />
groups are also unhappy. Hasn't this gone on long enough and isn't it<br />
time, indeed, your job, with the uncertainty surrounding the investment<br />
climate, to sort this out?<br />
PM: It's not my job at all in that respect. I'm not here to resolve<br />
uncertainties that are created by the rights of individuals to take cases<br />
of appeal to the courts. I mean, you might recall that a couple of<br />
weeks ago Western Mining and the Savage River Mining Company<br />
had a similar matter running and Western Mining lost the case.<br />
Now, legislation which wipes out the right of people to appeal is not my<br />
job at a-ll7-And the High Court has made it quite clear that freehold title<br />
issued since 1788 extinguishes native title.<br />
MB: So who's responsibility is it then, now'?<br />
PM: Well Mr. Goss is making it clear that he says he's now picking up<br />
pretty firmly some of the points I made yesterday saying oh yes, I<br />
know, I understand he said, we shouldn't be acting in a non.<br />
discriminatory way. And he said, let me quote him, he said, he claims<br />
he's, " always sought that validation be undertaken on a nondiscriminatory<br />
basis". Well if that's the case why does he want the<br />
Commonwealth for us to legislate and put aside the Racial<br />
Discrimination Act?<br />
See, bear in mind this Michael. That is, that these leases are<br />
Queensland leases. If they're not Commonwealth leases it's the<br />
Queensland Parliament that has to legislate to give statutory power to<br />
these leases. That is, ie. validating them. If the Premier says he's<br />
going to do that in a non-discriminatory way why does he want the<br />
Commonwealth to do anything? I mean, why then do we have to<br />
/ TO'd VTO* ON œ O: 6T 16* 6nu* ST : 131 </p>
<p>introduce an amendment to the Racial Discrimination Act? If he says<br />
it's non-discriminatory, what's the problem?<br />
MB: Well the Wik people are saying that Queensland breached duty of<br />
care by giving the lease to Comalco, now obviously you would agree<br />
with that.<br />
PM: No I wouldn't agree with that. I don't know that it's true. They allege<br />
that. But, you see, this is the point, Queensland is about more than<br />
the non-discri minatory validation of its leases there. There are all<br />
these other questions about breach of trust, there's questions about<br />
indemnity. See what Mr Goss is saying is, ' all I want is nondiscriminatory<br />
validation of leases.' That's not all he wants at all. He<br />
wants us to validate, he wants us to suspend the Racial Discrimination<br />
Act so that some of these other matters like breaches of fiduciary duty<br />
and trust can be dealt with. Arnd as well as that he's asked us for<br />
Indemnification. Now, these are the points which we make very clear<br />
to him.<br />
MB: But couldn't this scenario be repe ated across the country? I mean it's<br />
happening here in far north Queensland but essentially the same thing<br />
could happen anywhere, couldn't it?<br />
PM: Well the High Court has said, and you're welcome to read the<br />
judgement the same as anyone else, that freehold grants of interest in<br />
land and leases extinguish native title. But, it's still, our system of<br />
justice still allows people to take an action against a state or a<br />
company for what they think is a breach of trust or a breach of duty or<br />
some commercial grievance and it Is not the job of the Commonwealth<br />
Government and its parliament to rush in and obliterate that person or<br />
group's right to take such actions.<br />
MB: So how do you take it when Wayne Goss says he wants you to<br />
validate all title back to 1788?<br />
PM: I say it's, what he's asking for and unreasonably asking is that<br />
any matter which might arise about any title issued over the years, that<br />
the Commonwealth obliterates any person's right to take issue with the<br />
supposed owners of that title. Now, there is no problem, the High<br />
Court don't rely on my word the High Court said, ' The issuing of<br />
freehold or leasehold title extinguishes native title'. So it is not the<br />
native title problem. You see, this is the confusion that is here and that<br />
Mr Goss, using these terms, in a sense smooths over.<br />
Native title is one thing, but claims by people for other things like<br />
breach of trust etcetera are another. It's the native title, which is not a<br />
problem in that sense because they are... Let's take the Comalco<br />
leases. First of all, it has to be established if native title existed or ever<br />
existed. Now, let's say it did exist. If the Queensland Government has<br />
O'd V7100N 20: 6T œ 6* 6ThfT]. i </p>
<p>issued leases over that area, it's probably extinguished the native title.<br />
So what is the remaining problem? The remaining problem is breach<br />
of trust and fiduciary duty.<br />
MB: Well what can you do about that? Why not legislate to protect<br />
Comalco in that instance?<br />
PM: But why should the Commonwealth, how can the Commonwealth be<br />
asked? I mean, you understand what words you're putting to me.<br />
You're saying why shouldn't we legislate. What you're saying is, ' Will<br />
you suspend your Racial Discrimination Act to allow the Queensland<br />
Parliament to do a racially discriminatory thing?' Well the answer is<br />
no. The Racial Discrimination Act is there for a purpose. It's to protect<br />
people against discriminatory acts.<br />
MB: Surely other companies could have breached the fiduciary interest as<br />
well. All across the country couldn't they?<br />
PM: And that's why there are claims all the time, in the courts all the time.<br />
But this.-<br />
M13: So Wayne Goss is right then when he says this could happen<br />
everywvhere?<br />
PM: But it happens every day of the week. I mean, you just had it with<br />
Western Mining and Savage River last week. It happens all the time.<br />
But is it a government's right to obliterate someone's right? Let's say<br />
somebody wants to resume your house. Would you appreciate it if the<br />
Government of the ACT or New South Wales obliterated your right to<br />
go to the Land and Environment Court?<br />
MB: What does it say about the investment climate we've got then, at themoment?<br />
PM: It just says this is a real world place like every other country in the<br />
world. That people have got inherent legal rights and they're not to be<br />
obliterated by Governments who are spooked by mining companies.<br />
MB: If you did grant special legislation...<br />
PM: Now let me just make this point. We've already given tax concessions<br />
to Queensland to permit the sale of the Gladstone power station to<br />
Comalco. We would like to see that range of investments go ahead.<br />
And as the Cape York Land Council makes clear that the existing<br />
leases are not threatened and the new leases can be negotiated with<br />
the Aboriginal people. But the mining company in particular does not<br />
want to talk to the Aboriginal people and the Queensland government<br />
does not want to talk to the Aboriginal people. They want us to use a<br />
Commonwealth sledge hammer where they can actually sit down and<br />
lTO* ON 20: 6T œ 6* 6ndUT : 131 </p>
<p>4<br />
negotiate these things. So the Commonwealth want to the see the<br />
project proceed, but we are not about obliterating peoples right at law<br />
particularly when it is not necessary.<br />
MB: Is part of the concern though also that if you do make special<br />
legislation for this, that it would raise question marks about every other<br />
mining lease in the country essentially wouldn't it?<br />
PM: I do not think it does, no. Because a mining lease properly issued<br />
extinguishes native title. All your questions go to Mabo and native<br />
title, but the whole point about the Wik claim is it is more than Mabo<br />
and native title it is breach of trust, it is all these other questions and<br />
that is where we say, this is a Queensland matter, not a<br />
Commonwealth matter. If Premier Goss is saying to us what I am after<br />
here is validation to be undertaken in a non-discriminatory basis, the<br />
simple question is if it is non-discriminatory, after all they are<br />
Queensland leases, validate them with a Queensland Act of<br />
Parliament and all is well.<br />
MB: Does the question of compensation and who is responsible for it lie at<br />
the heart of this?<br />
PM: I don't think so, no.<br />
MB: Who is responsible in this case, Queensland?<br />
PM: It is obviously not the Commonwealth government. These are issued<br />
by the Queensland government in 1958. How can the Commonwealth<br />
government be in any way involved?<br />
MB: So it is Queensland?<br />
PM: In terms of questions of compensation, if all the claims which are in the<br />
Wik set of claims were to succeed, they would be resolved somewhere<br />
between Queensland and the mining company. I can not see by<br />
whatever jump of logic that somehow it is the Commonwealth<br />
government's responsibility.'<br />
MB: What can you do about the states generally though? They were<br />
talking earlier today about holding a separate meeting without you and<br />
I understand that is not on the cards anymore, but it does suggest that<br />
they at least are not convinced that you can deliver on this, doesn't it?<br />
PM: What are you talking about now the Wik claim or Mabo?<br />
MB: No, on Mabo generally.<br />
PM: Mabo as I said yesterday we have already had, we think, quite a lot<br />
of success in the discussions with officials, between the<br />
' Od 17O* N œ O: 6T œ 6* 6lU~ jT </p>
<p>Commonwealth and the States and we are proceeding down very clear<br />
principles on Mabo. As I said yesterday quite clear and I will repeat it<br />
to you again Michael the Commonwealth, for the decisions it has<br />
taken is absolutely clear and confident about its position, and it is<br />
developing a piece of legislation that we hope to introduce into<br />
Parliament in the Budget sessions.<br />
MB: But Mabo itself is developing a momentum all of its own isn't it, do you<br />
concede it has gone off the rails a bit here?<br />
PM: There is a fair bit of confusion about it, but that is not helped by the<br />
media either. Here we had the Sydney Morning Herald saying today<br />
that I had ruled out legislation in respect of this Wik matter yesterday,<br />
which I didn't.<br />
MB: Didn't you?<br />
PM: No, no what we said was that the generic legislation that we will<br />
introduce for Mabo will cover the native aspects of Wik.<br />
MVB: You were specifically asked to give that thought and you didn't do that<br />
did you?<br />
PM: No, no, I made that quite clear. Then we had The Financial Review<br />
calling false the distinction between wilful discrimination or breach of<br />
trust and innocent discrimination in the absence of any knowledge of<br />
native title. For me it would seem to be a fairly obvious matter. Then<br />
the other one, there is no difference between McArthur River and the<br />
Wik claims or a potential settlement. What is written often people<br />
saying, journalists writing under their by-lines that there is confusion<br />
about this what they should be saying is I am confused about this, but<br />
they will not say that, they say there is confusion and who's<br />
responsibile for the confusion. The fact is the Commonwealth is<br />
proceeding along principles, we have published a principles document<br />
33 principles, which we gave the States ahead of the Melbourne<br />
meeting, we have given them a general discussion document on it, the<br />
Cabinet has now met on a number of occasions for five or six hours at<br />
a time and enunciated principles, Mabo, conceptually, we have<br />
covered.<br />
MVB: Do you rule out Federal legislation in the Wik case?<br />
PMV: 0f the generic variety no. Because the generic variety will come up in<br />
respect of native title under Mabo, but Wik is about more than native<br />
title, that is the point.<br />
MB: But what does it mean in plain language. Do you rule it out? Do you<br />
rule out coming in and solving the stand-off that we have?<br />
/ SO~ d TO* ON œ O: 61 26,6n ,2T 3] l. i </p>
<p>PM: If you are asking me am I prepared to rule in discriminatory legislation<br />
that is by suspending the Racial Discrimination Act to permit<br />
Queensland to pass discriminatory legislation to deny the Wik people<br />
their rights to appeal to the Courts I would not pass such legislation.<br />
No. I wouldn't.<br />
MVB: So the Commonwealth will not step in under any circumstances here, it<br />
is a Queensland problem and that is where it lies?<br />
PIM: You have got to understand yourself, you are putting the questions. A<br />
minute ago I made a distinction between native title issues, that is<br />
Mabo issues, and non-native title issues. Your question is in respect<br />
of which part that native title part or the other part?<br />
MB: Well, any part, we have a confusion here where a company is worried<br />
about an investment.<br />
PM: Yes, but here you are confused aren't you?<br />
MVB: Not necessarily.<br />
PIM: I think you are. Look, let me take you through it there is native title<br />
issues in Wilk and there are non-native title issues.<br />
MB: No, I understand that, but we have a stand-off in a company..<br />
PM: You are asking me will we legislate for the native title issues. Answer<br />
yes, through the generic Mabo legislation. Will we suspend the Racial<br />
Discrimination Act to allow discriminatory legislation to obliterate rights<br />
on other matters No.<br />
MVB: OK, how much is the personality clash between you and Wayne Goss<br />
got to in the road of finding a workable solution?<br />
PM: I do not think at all, although I notice he said today, he put a press<br />
statement out Premier Wayne Goss today said it was unfortunate<br />
the Prime Minister resorted to personal criticism in response to<br />
Queenslands request that is yesterday. I have made no personal<br />
criticism of him what so ever. I am just dealing with the issues at their<br />
source.<br />
MB: Coming crying back to mama and some of the things you said just<br />
before you went overseas..<br />
PM: That is a commentary on the notion of the States saying when I go to<br />
Melbourne, well hang on we have got rights here and interests, and<br />
the moment there is a problem all of a sudden it is transferable to the<br />
Commonwealth. So, when the Commonwealth is in there trying to get<br />
a resolution of things for Mabo, then we have less than full co-<br />
/ 9O* d V7100N œ O: 6T 16* 6nH* 2T131 </p>
<p>7<br />
operation, the moment there is a problem, ding-a-ling? Back onto the<br />
Commonwealth. I should have thought that was an obvious point to<br />
make and frankly before I made that point, people did not realise, I<br />
don't think, in the broad debate, that things like breach of trust and<br />
fiduciary responsibilities were an issue here.<br />
MB: But you don't have a problem personally with Wayne Goss?<br />
PM: No.<br />
MB: All right Prime Minister, we will leave there. Thank you very much.<br />
PM: Thank you Michael.<br />
