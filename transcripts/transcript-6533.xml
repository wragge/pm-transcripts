FOR MEDIA 31 OCTOBER 1984<br />
I have sent the following message to Hlis Excellency<br />
Mr Zail Singh, the President of India:<br />
I was shocked and deeply saddened to learn that<br />
Prime Minister Ghandi has died as a result of the shameful<br />
act of violence perpetrated earlier today.<br />
The Australian Government deplores this wanton act of<br />
terrorisma.<br />
Mrs Ghandi was an outstanding leader whose courage, strength<br />
and guidance will be greatly missed, not only by the people<br />
of India, but throughout the world. In Australia, she worked<br />
with and was greatly respected by Mr Whitlam, Mr Fraser and<br />
myself. On behalf of the Government and people of Australia I offer through<br />
you to the Government and people of India our sincere sympathy<br />
at your nation's loss.<br />
I would ask that you also convey my personal sympathies to<br />
Mrs Ghandi's family. </p>
