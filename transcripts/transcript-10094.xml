4 September 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MXNISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, MAJURO<br />
E OE<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I have now had an opportunity of examining President Clinton's<br />
statement and also the news reports of the American military action in Iraq. Australia both<br />
understands and supports the action taken by the United States. It was a proper response to a<br />
clear breach by Iraq of the broad conditions of Security Council Resolution 688 which<br />
interdicted the repression of civilian populations. Plainly, Iraq had been behaving in a manner<br />
inconsistent with the understanding reached at the conclusion of the Gulf War and in the<br />
eircumstances, the action taken by the United States is justified. It does have the support of<br />
the Australian Government, We both understand and support the action taken by the United<br />
States. The information I have this morning is that the limited number of Australian citizens<br />
who are in te relevant area in Iraq are both safe and well. Their situation will of course be<br />
kept under very careful notice. I have been informed that a travel warning notice has already<br />
been issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in relation to travel in the<br />
affected area.<br />
JRNLST: Prime Minister, when was Australia first informed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I received a message overnight from President Clinton.<br />
JRNLST: You spoke with the President personally? 04/ 09/ 96 09: 43 Pg: 1 </p>
<p>Fax from PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no, no. He sent a message to me and that arrived in Canberra overnight.<br />
JRNLST; But you weren't informed prior to the strike action?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. RNLST:<br />
Would you like to have been consulted in advance rather than just informed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think in these circumstances it is my understanding that the number of countries that in fact<br />
were consulted in advance was very limited, including the United Kingdom whose refuelling<br />
facilities at Diego Garcia were used by the B 52s.<br />
JRNLST: Prime Minister, Mr Clinton said that this was a necessary force. Would you accept necessary<br />
force ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well our position couldn't be plainer. We support the American action and that carries with it<br />
an obvious statement that it was an indicative of the appropriate use of force in the<br />
circumstances of what is happening.<br />
JRNLST: And fully covered by UN resolutions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's a question of whether it is appropriate action. At the end of the day whether action taken<br />
is appropriate in all of the circumstances is what counts and it is the view of the Australian<br />
Government that it was appropriate action in all of the circumstances.<br />
JRNLST; Prime Minister, is there any role for Australian troops in this matter?<br />
2 04/ 89/ 96 89: 43 Pg: 2 </p>
<p>Fax from PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, there's been no suggestion of that and I wouldn't have thought that came into the<br />
equation. I don't think this issue should be either played down or played up. It is a limited<br />
military strike, quite specifically designed to reduce Iraq's air capacity. There are reports<br />
about its success. People will make their own assessments of that. I don't think it should be<br />
built up into anything more than that. Equally it's a very significant incident Any incident<br />
that involves the use of military force of this kind is very significant but equally, I don't think<br />
we should get too melodramatic about it either.<br />
JRNLST: Mr Howard, could there be a link between the timing of the strike and Bill Clinton's hopes for<br />
re-election in the Presidentials?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, I am not going to get into American domestic politics. I look at the merits of what has<br />
happened and I am satisfied on the merits that the action taken is appropriate and justified. I<br />
am not going to make a comment on American politics. Yes Craig?<br />
JRNLST: Last night Mr Clinton wouldn't rule out frther action, What's your position on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We will assess each individual element on its own merits but obviously if you are satisfied<br />
that behaviour by Iraq has justified some military response, it follows from that that a series of<br />
military strikes in the context of those same circumstances would probably be viewed in the<br />
same light but I can't and won't give a blank cheque in advance and nobody would expect me<br />
to. JRNLST: The Australian ship on the way home from the Gulf, will it continue to return home?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes. JRNL-ST:<br />
What provision has there been for further briefings? I mean, for example there were some<br />
stories last night that some Americans were on the way to see you. 84/ 09/ 96 09: 43 Pg: 3 </p>
<p>Fax from PRIMEE MINISTER:<br />
I haven't made any arrangements to see any Americans here. I do understand that<br />
coincidentally Mr Winston Lord, who is the, I think, Deputy Under Secretary of State for<br />
Pacific or Far Eastern Affairs, was coming to the Marshall Islands, or is coming to the<br />
Marshall Islands but he won't be arriving here until Thursday evening. I will have returned<br />
homae to Australia by Thursday eveziing. We are receiving fairly detailed briefings and my<br />
office has been in touch with our embassy in Washington, the State Department has been in<br />
touch, the usual sorts of things are being exchanged but once again I'd be happy to get any<br />
further information but I won't be seeing Mr Lord yet<br />
JRNLST: Should the matter be now going straight to the Security Council to be dealt wvit urgently<br />
there?<br />
PRM NIMISTER:<br />
I think you have to look at it in both the context of the action being taken by America as<br />
leader of the allied force that waged the Gulf War and also in the contex of Security Council<br />
action. I'm not at this stage suggesting other than that Iraq should, and I very strongly suggest<br />
this, Iraq should comply with the spirit of the original Security Council resolution, should<br />
respect the conditions laid down by the three monitoring powers, the United States. the United<br />
Kingdom and F~ rance at the conclusion of the Gulf War, and if that had occurred and the<br />
requests pursuant to that have been complied with, then this action by the United States would<br />
not have been necessary.<br />
JRNLST: On France, Frime Minister, last night aLsp okesman of the French Forcigu Ministry expressed<br />
some concern about the action and made the point that they were informed and not consulted,<br />
and they certainly did not give their approval.<br />
PRIE MINISMR.<br />
France can speak for France and Australia will speak for Australia. I have stated Australia's<br />
position. Australia's position is one of both understanding and support.<br />
JRNLST; Mr Howard would you agree that the stark contrast between mailitary action, in this case in<br />
response to obviously gross human rights violations in Iraq and violazions of other places such<br />
as Burundi and many other places around the world, why is it we've got this inconsistent<br />
approach with the use of military force in response to the suppression of minorities?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't think it's inconsistent. I believe that there was world wide support, quite<br />
04/ 09/ 96 09: 43 Pg: 4 </p>
<p>Fax from: unprecedented world wide support for intervention when Iraq behaved as it did in the prelude<br />
to the Gulf War and what is now being done by the United States is by way of further<br />
enforcement of the stance taken across the world in response to the Iraqi action in late 1990.<br />
Thank you.<br />
