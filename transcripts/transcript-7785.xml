TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PAN PACIFIC HOTEL, 20 OCTOBER<br />
1989 E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, have you been briefed on the<br />
Grafton bus crash?<br />
PM: I've been told about the I understand that 22 people<br />
have lost their lives and I'm asking for full information<br />
when I get back. I was trying to find out whether there was<br />
one particular group of people that were in it so that if<br />
there's any group that I can send some message to. But I<br />
just simply want to take this opportunity and I thank you<br />
very much for giving it to me to express my sense of grief<br />
to all families who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.<br />
It's an enormous dimension, 22 people, and I simply express<br />
my grief to everyone concerned.<br />
JOURNALIST: This morning's session on the environment. How<br />
did that go?<br />
PM: Well unfortunately I couldn't be there for the whole of<br />
it because I had my meeting with Her Majesty just after<br />
o'clock but I think I can say these things. Firstly, as I've<br />
said in my own intervention, one compares the situation with<br />
2 years ago because 2 years ago there was no separate item on<br />
the agenda and we in fact had the contribution 2 years ago at<br />
Vancouver by the President of the Maldives, President Gayoom,<br />
and he talked there about the threat to his country of the<br />
rising sea levels associated with the warming of the<br />
atmosphere. I think for a lot of people around the * table<br />
then this was the first dramatic illustration to them of the<br />
dimension of this problem and so of course on this occasion,<br />
as distinct from 1987, we have a separate and important item<br />
on the agenda and I think that is significant. In other<br />
words in two years there's been a sea change, if I can put it<br />
that way, in the importance attached to environmental issues<br />
and to the understanding on the part of people represented at<br />
this Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting of the<br />
responsibility that they have not only within their own<br />
countries but in terms of co-operation to do what we can to<br />
meet these issues. It's in that framework that I was able </p>
<p>( PM cont) to make some suggestions in there and may I say<br />
just by way of background, we're very fortunate to have<br />
Professor Slayter, my Chief Scientist, who has put in a lot<br />
of work on this and we were able to indicate that in<br />
Australia we have developed certain expertise in the number<br />
of areas that we are prepared to share with other countries<br />
of the Commonwealth. I referred to our experience in the<br />
management of rainforests and let me say I've had some<br />
bilateral discussions with Dr Mahathir in this respect and I<br />
think we'll be able to provide some expertise from Australia<br />
to come up here to Malaysia and help them in this area and I<br />
think that's going to be particularly important. I also<br />
referred to the way in which our Australian scientists have<br />
pioneered bio-climactic techniques, developed actual models<br />
which enable the assessment of the likely effects of climate<br />
change on the distribution and productivity of crops and<br />
pastures; and forests and these sorts of techniques I'm<br />
informed, which are useful and valuable in planning land<br />
utilisation are able to be undertaken on small readily<br />
available computers. Now these are techniques and models and<br />
simulations which have been developed by Australian<br />
scientists and what I offered today at the meeting was that<br />
we would be prepared to help the training of agronomists and<br />
meteorologists and foresters from other countries in the<br />
Commonwealth including a preparedness to establish a research<br />
training centre in Australia. I indicated that I'll be<br />
writing to all the countries and if we get * sufficient<br />
responses and I think we will then we will go ahead and<br />
make these training facilities available. Now I think that's<br />
an indication of the way in which there is an understanding<br />
not just on Australia's part, but of everyone that the issues<br />
that we're talking about now are global in their dimension<br />
and the thing that the Commonwealth is uniquely able to do<br />
from its experience is to share these techniques that perhaps<br />
the more developed countries have now, to share them with the<br />
less developed countries. I think that's something that<br />
uniquely the Commonwealth can do. We've sought to give a<br />
lead to it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have any of those lesser developed nations shown<br />
a lax attitude on the environmental issues?<br />
PM: No, I don't think it's right to say that they've shown a<br />
lax attitude. It's very easy for those of us who've had the<br />
good fortune to be earlier in the economic development cycle,<br />
to say now you less developed countries, you must be very<br />
careful what you do, because naturally enough they say: " wait<br />
a minute, mate, you've been there, you've had the advantage<br />
of developing your economies when there was not a great deal<br />
of environmental consciousness". If you want to look at the<br />
greatest contribution to the greenhouse gases, of </p>
<p>( PM cont) course it's the use of fossil fuel and they are<br />
right in saying I think, they haven't put it this way but<br />
I think the logic is very simple. In fact these are issues<br />
of global concern, of global impact, then they are global<br />
responsibilities. I think that one of the issues that we<br />
will be discussing most particularly over the weekend at the<br />
Retreat is what the sort of terminology in the Declaration,<br />
the Environmental Declaration, will be which will pick up<br />
this sense of responsibility that there is amongst the<br />
developed nations to the developing nations. I think it's a<br />
core issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there any specific commonwealth initiative<br />
being considered to address these<br />
PM: In these discussions that have taken place so far<br />
Milton, there have been, at the officials level, there are<br />
three or four different sorts or formulations on this issue<br />
from different countries in the Commonwealth which go<br />
directly to it and so one of the things that we'll have to do<br />
at the Retreat is to get an agreed formulation. I think<br />
we'll be able to do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, does this mean that Australia's<br />
aid budget for overseas countries now or developing countries<br />
might be increased?<br />
PM: Well it doesn't necessarily follow because we have a<br />
very significant aid budget now and there are categories<br />
there under which we'll be able to do these things. For<br />
instance, in the offer that I've made that I've just<br />
outlined, that could involve in this first year something<br />
like perhaps SlM but I think that's capable of being<br />
absorbed within the existing aid program.<br />
JOURNALIST: Given the developing countries concerned that<br />
have been expressed and you've reiterated them here, do you<br />
think it's fair to tie aid to developing countries to<br />
environmental moves on their part?<br />
PM: I don't think it would be fair if you did this; say you<br />
knew that they needed aid, economic assistance, and you've<br />
known that for some time and then said now you don't get that<br />
aid unless you do a, b, c in environmental terms. But I do<br />
think that they would regard it as appropriate that those of<br />
us who are in the relatively fortunate position to be giving<br />
economic assistcance should be pointing out our concern with<br />
environmental matters and that they should also have a<br />
concern with this. Provided that we are prepared to do the<br />
sorts of things for instance that I've talked about, to share<br />
our technolgies which are environmentally relevant, then I<br />
think it's appropriate in disucssions with them to say to </p>
<p>-4-<br />
( PM cont) them, well this particular sort of development may<br />
need to have this sort of qualification attached to it or<br />
this sort of process attached to it. But provided that we<br />
are prepared to share the technologies that will help them to<br />
do it then that's reasonable, it seems to me.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you had any further advice from the Embassy<br />
in Pretoria about the significance of yesterday's<br />
announcement, whether in fact it still leaves the major<br />
problem for South Africa or have they largely escaped the<br />
issue of rescheduling their debt?<br />
PM: No, I haven't had any further advice. I've really got<br />
nothing to add to what I said before and that is that quite<br />
obviously we would have preferred two things. That is that<br />
the decision hadn't been made so quickly. And secondly,<br />
instead of having the multi-year rescheduling consideration,<br />
that it could've been annual. Now both Joe Clark and I said<br />
that, said it quite specifically. But having said that, it's<br />
quite clear that there are still very significant constraints<br />
upon South Africa as a result of the decisions that have been<br />
taken. Not least you have the situation that they will be<br />
having to be running current account surplus' to cover their<br />
commitments and there is no provision for new loans. The<br />
South Africans themselves have apparently indicated that they<br />
are going to be operating under very severe constraints. So<br />
I believe that in that context the decisions that the<br />
Commonwealth will make I think on the basis of the five steps<br />
I put forward yesterday will be able to constitute a<br />
continuing pressure in the financial area.<br />
JOURNALIST: Back on the environment briefly, given the<br />
number of proposals that are around on the environment, is<br />
there any danger that you won't actually be able to come up<br />
with a satisfactory formula?<br />
PM: No, I think not. I've got to be advised by the<br />
discussions that have been going on at the officials levels.<br />
I've had my officials in wit ' h the others of other countries.<br />
The impression I'm given from my people is that they. will be<br />
able to reach a consensus position.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher at Langkawi other<br />
than your inestimable personal charm what strategies are<br />
you developing to bring her into line?<br />
PM: My charm? Who were you talking about there?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yours. Inestimable charm.<br />
PM: Hey, what's happened here? </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Who won the golf?<br />
PM: Apart from my incalculable charm, what was that?<br />
JOURNALIST: What strategies are you developing in your own<br />
mind to bring her into line with Commonwealth thinking on<br />
sanctions? PM: Now I am by nature, as you know, an optimist. I've<br />
demonstrated that in some 30 years of public life. But there<br />
are limits, bounds to my optimism and I've never thought that<br />
I was capable of bringing to use your language Mrs<br />
Thatcher into line. I mean one has to have limits to ones<br />
optimism. I think what will happen at Langkawi is that there<br />
will be a clear exposition on the part of all the other<br />
members of the Commonwealth of the intensity with which they<br />
hold their views as to why the steps that I have proposed<br />
ought to be followed through. I don't really believe that we<br />
will be able to pursuade Margaret to agree but perhaps<br />
something will happen that will bring her somewhat closer to<br />
our position, I don't know. But it's quite clear from<br />
everything that's been said during the session and since<br />
that, everyone else is committed to supporting those five<br />
steps. JOURNALIST: Rabbie Namaliu is confident Fiji will be back in<br />
the Commonwealth in a matter of time. Could it come back in<br />
under the present Constitution?<br />
PM: Well I would guess that the when you say the present<br />
Constitution, there's no such thing as a present<br />
Constitution. There's the one that's been proposed and they<br />
are now going through the processes as you know, of public<br />
consultation then it will go to the Council of the Chiefs.<br />
But if you refer to those proposals I wouldn't imagine that<br />
for instance, those proposals would be acceptable to India,<br />
and the way the Commonwealth operates there needs to be a<br />
consensus view. And more importantly, as far as I understand<br />
it, there has been no move, on any information I have from<br />
Fiji that they are anticipating that in the present situation<br />
that they would be making an application to rejoin.<br />
JOURNALIST: On green issues, how was your game of golf this<br />
morning, Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: Well we now stand at one all. I beat Geoffrey in New<br />
Zealand, he triumphed today, he won today so we've got to<br />
have the shoot-out at the Retreat.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you miss the Caufield Cup at the Retreat? </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM: I'll do my best not to miss it. I can assure you that I<br />
will have made an investment at any rate.<br />
JOURNALIST: And the tip?<br />
PM: A tip? I've got to study the form later this afternoon.<br />
But on the runs of last week which are fairly significant, I<br />
think Nayrizi is the one, isn't it, that is shaping up as<br />
think's. Four to one, isn't it?<br />
( REPLY: Nine to two.)<br />
PM: Nine to two, I'm told by my Economic Adviser. And on<br />
the run last week I think it's entitled to be favourite. It<br />
was an enormous run. I think some of the computer<br />
calculators have put it as the best run in the last ten years<br />
or something. Now you shouldn't live by the computers but<br />
sometimes you'll die if you don't take them into account.<br />
