OPENING-OF-THE-GORDON--PERLS-TEINPAVILION-___<br />
WEST COBURG 14 FEBRUARY 1987<br />
MR MAYOR, COUNCILLORS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
HAVING KNOWN GORDON PERLSTEIN FOR SOME TIME, I WAS DELIGHTED<br />
TO RECEIVE YOUR INVITATION TO OPEN THIS PAVILION NAMED IN<br />
HIS HONOUR.<br />
BEFORE I DECLARE THE PAVILION OPEN I WANT TO ELABORATE A<br />
LITTLE ON GORDON'S BACKGROUND, BECAUSE HIS CONTRIBUTION TO<br />
THIS CITY, STATE AND INDEED NATION DATES BACK MANY YEARS.<br />
GORDON JOINED THE VICTORIAN-RAILWAYS-IN-1941 AT THE AGEOF<br />
14 AS A LABOURER AND WAS APPRENTICED AS A FITTER AND TURNER<br />
IN 1942. HE MUST HAVE BEEN GOOD AT IT BECAUSE HE BECAME THE<br />
YOUNGEST APPOINTED SUPERVISOR IN THE ROLLING STOCK<br />
DIVISION OF THE VICTORIAN RAILWAYS AT THE AGE OF<br />
OVER THE NEXT 40 YEARS GORDON WORKED IN EVERY COUNTRY<br />
DEPOT OF VICTORIAN RAILWAYS, FINISHING HIS DISTINGUISHED<br />
SERVICE AS AN INSPECTOR OF LOCOMOTIVE MAINTENANCE, THE<br />
SECOND TOP RANK IN THE SERVICE.<br />
GORDON ALSO GOT INVOLVED IN UNION WORK AT AN EARLY AGE AND<br />
HE BECAME MINUTE SECRETARY OF THE THEN AMALGAMATED<br />
ENGINEERING UNION AT<br />
HE WENT ON TO BECOME A STATE COUNCILLOR, A VICE<br />
PRESIDENT AND THEN PRESIDENT OF THE VICTORIAN DIVISION<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN TRANSPORT OFFICERS FEDERATION. THIS<br />
SWAS FOLLOWED BY ATERM AS NATIONAL COUNCILLOR AND<br />
NATIONAL PRESIDENT FROM 1983 TO 1985. </p>
<p>THANKS TO THIS LIFETIME OF SERVICE TO THE UNION MOVEMENT,<br />
GORDON WAS AWARDED THE ORDER OF AUSTRALIA MEDAL IN 1985.<br />
IN ADDITION TO ALL THIS, GORDON HAS BEEN KEENLY INVOLVED<br />
WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF-THE-CITY OF-COBURG...<br />
TH-I-S-WA-S-A-LIETIME" S--I-NTEREST,---I-CH-HE---APP-E-D--OF-F-IN-<br />
1980 WITH HIS ELECTION TO COUNCIL. SINCE THEN HE HAS<br />
SERVED ON MANY OF ITS COMMITTEES AND IS OF COURSE<br />
-CURRENTLY MAYOR-OF-THE CITY--OF COBURG.-<br />
WITH A CAREER LIKE THAT, IT IS A WONDER GORDON HAD ANY TIME<br />
FOR SPORT, BUT HE WAS INVOLVED IN ROWING FOR A NUMBER OF<br />
YEARS, BOTH AS AN OARSMAN AND IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY<br />
AT THE YARRA YARRA CLUB.<br />
AS FOR SHORE RESERVE, HOME OF WEST COBURG FOOTBALL CLUB, I<br />
KNOW IT HAS NOT ONLY BEEN THE-BASE-OF A LONG LINE OF<br />
PREMIERSHIP WINNERS AT BOTH JUNIOR AND SENIOR LEVELS, BUT<br />
HAS ALSO PRODUCED A NUMBER OF LEAGUE PLAYERS, MAINLY FOR<br />
NORTH MELBOURNE, ESSENDON AND CARLTON.<br />
A RECENT CHANGE AT THE GROUND HAS SEEN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A<br />
CONCRETE CRICKET PITCH, WHICH HAS ALLOWED JUNIOR CRICKET TO<br />
BE PLAYED HERE WITH ALMOST AS MUCH SUCCESS AS THE FOOTBALL<br />
CLUB. IT IS GOOD TO NOTE THE SPIRIT OF CO-OPERATION BETWEEN BOTH<br />
THE FOOTBALL AND CRICKET CLUBS, WHICH HAVE WORKED TO<br />
ESTABLISH THE NEW PAVILION AND WILL SHARE ITS FACILITIES.<br />
THE GORDON PERLSTEIN PAVILION WAS BUILT AT A COST OF<br />
$ 186,000, OF WHICH THE COUNCIL CONTRIBUTED $ 160,000. WITH<br />
THE REST BEING PROVIDED BY THE WEST COBURG FOOTBALL CLUB.<br />
A PAVILION SUCH AS THIS DOES NOT SPRING UP OVERNIGHT, AND<br />
WHAT WE SEE BEFORE US TODAY IS THE RESULT OF A LOT OF HARD<br />
WORK BY MANY PEOPLE. </p>
<p>3<br />
S IN PARTICULAR, CONGRATULATIONS MUST GO TO THE PRESIDENT<br />
OF THE FOOTBALL CLUB, GERRY CUDMORE, AND TO HIS<br />
HARDWORKING COMMITTEE.<br />
S SPECIAL RECOGNITION MUST ALSO GO TO RON CASSELLS WHO<br />
THIS YEAR IS CELEBRATING 50 YEARS SERVICE TO AND SUPPORT<br />
OF THE WEST COBURG FOOTBALL CLUB AN OUTSTANDING<br />
RECORD---<br />
-THIS-IS A FINE-PAVILION THAT-WILL SERVE-THE-CLUBS-AND-LOCAL--<br />
SPORTINGPEOPLE_ OF THE_-CITY OF COBURG AND THE SURROUNDING<br />
AREA FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.<br />
I COMMEND THE COUNCIL AND THE CLUB'S INITIATIVE IN<br />
CONSTRUCTING IT. IN NAMING IT AFTER GORDON PERLSTEIN YOU<br />
HAVE RECOGNISED A CONTRIBUTION TO THIS CITY AND BEYOND WHICH<br />
HAS BEEN SO GREAT OVER MANY YEARS.<br />
IT NOW GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO OFFICIALLY DECLARE<br />
OPEN THE GORDON PERLSTEIN PAVILION. </p>
