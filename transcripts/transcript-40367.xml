    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government will establish a Royal Commission, in co-operation with the Government of the Northern Territory into the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre. </p>
<p>Like all Australians, we were shocked and appalled by the images of mistreatment of children at the detention centre. </p>
<p>Every child in our justice system must be treated with humanity and respect at all times.</p>
<p>The two Governments will move quickly to finalise Terms of Reference and recommend an eminent person to conduct the inquiry. </p>
<p>Previous inquiries conducted within the Northern Territory into the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre failed to identify the nature and extent of the behaviour highlighted by Four Corners. </p>
<p>The powers of a Royal Commission, including its ability to compel evidence, are therefore necessary to identify the systemic failures at the institution. </p>
<p>It is important that the causes and failures at the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre are identified to provide lessons to other correctional institutions in Australia to ensure they are never repeated. </p>
<p>This needs to be a thorough inquiry which exposes what occurred and why it remained concealed for so long.</p>
