PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERK EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
' THE MARCH STATEMENT WHAT IT MEANS'<br />
AUSTRALIJIN FINANCIAL REVIEW SEMINAR<br />
SYDNEY 18 MARCH 1991<br />
The Australian Financial Reiew is to be congratulated for<br />
arranging this seminar, and this impressive list of<br />
speakers, to examine the Statement I delivered to Parliament<br />
six days ago: Building a Competitive Ausatralia.<br />
Before entering into the main subject matter let me briefly<br />
express my best wishes to Peter Robinson who recently<br />
announced his retiremrent. Peter has been an able Chairman<br />
of the many Financial Review seminars I have addressed, and<br />
has played a leading role in shaping Australian business<br />
journalism over the decades. He leaves a newspaper and a<br />
profession which are both considerably stronger for his<br />
contribution to them.<br />
Country race meetings are a fascinating feature of Australia<br />
life. They can tell us a lot about ourselves. At one such<br />
meeting a punter walk. ed up to the bookie who was fielding on<br />
a three horse race. He asked for $ 5,000 on Blue Vein. The<br />
bookie accepted the bet and after shoving the cash in his<br />
bag, grinned and said " Thanks mate, that's my horse." To<br />
which the punter replied: " Going to be a bloody slow race<br />
isn't it, I own the other two."<br />
And that really captures the truth of protectionist<br />
Australia. People kidded themselves, did deals, cheated and<br />
believed that they wore winners but it was indeed a terribly<br />
slowly run race. And it was a race in which inevitably we<br />
fell behind in an increasingly competitive world.<br />
When my Government was elected in March 1983 1 decided it<br />
was time to call in * rhe stewards. And we have been<br />
tightening and toughening the rules ever since. The 12<br />
March Statement was another decisive step in taking<br />
Australia out of the era of cosy delusion and further<br />
towards a stance and structure of tough international<br />
competitiveness. </p>
<p>You have asked me today to speak about ' Policy Changes and<br />
Objectives' and I will do so but in reverse order. To<br />
understand the specific announcements I made and to perceive<br />
their complex interrelationships, it is necessary to be<br />
clear about the purpose of it all the objectives we are<br />
pursuing. Worthwhile policy change can only be derived<br />
from, and driven by, clearly stated objectives.<br />
I alluded to these objectives within the Statement itself,<br />
when I described the kind of Australia we wish to build a<br />
modern, growing, prosperous and competitive economy, within<br />
a tolerant and fair society; a nation where quality of life<br />
counts for as much as quantity of output; an outward-looking<br />
community, enmeshed with the dynamism of the Asia Pacific<br />
region, and capable of taking on the best the world has to<br />
offer and winning.<br />
These are not, as I said on Tuesday, short term goals or<br />
transitory values. But they are not remote from day to day<br />
experience either indeed, they are intrinsically related<br />
to the hopes that we all entertain, and the expectations<br />
that each one of us holds, as Australians, and the<br />
opportunities this country can offer.<br />
It is only within such an Australia that opportunities can<br />
be provided for those capable of contributing to the<br />
national wealth; that support can be provided through social<br />
justice programs to those whose disadvantage prevents them<br />
from so contributing; and that protection can be provided<br />
for the natural environment so that we can pass it on in a<br />
healthy state to the next generation.<br />
To achieve those goals we need first, sustained growth in<br />
the material resources of the nation; and second, mechanisms<br />
for the efficient deployment of these resources to the<br />
various demands we may place on them.<br />
And the master key to it all the route which leads<br />
directly to this goal is the basic need, to quote the<br />
title of my Statement, to build a competitive Australia.<br />
It will be obvious to you all that Australia today is only<br />
part way through the massive national transformation that<br />
was necessary to ensure we can achieve these goals.<br />
At the same time, it must be accepted that many of the<br />
fundamental reforms necessary are, though not complete, well<br />
underway. Understandably, there is some sense of impatience about the<br />
time this transformation takes to bear all its fruit.<br />
As the political leader of the community, I have the<br />
responsibility of responding. And I do so, not by saying<br />
that the transformation will be complete at some specific<br />
point in the future -such as the mid-1990s or the end of<br />
this century; change is, in fact, an endless process. </p>
<p>This is because we live in a world of endless change and we<br />
need to learn the habit of adaptation so that we can<br />
constantly attune ourselves to changing circumstances.<br />
And never let us overlook the fact that Australia started<br />
this transformation a long way behind square one.<br />
Australia is richly endowed first our agriculture and then<br />
our mining industries provided the basis for a standard of<br />
living that was the envy cf the world.<br />
As a result the process of' wealth creation came to be seen<br />
to have more to do with the largesse of nature than with the<br />
toil of people. Nature's bounty was so remarkable and so<br />
consistently good that it shaped our national character and<br />
institutions in fundamentEnl ways. Australian's faith in<br />
that inevitable bounty became immortalised as ' she'll be<br />
right mate'. Australians developed skills more in dividing<br />
the spoils than in securing spoils for division. Our<br />
manufacturing industries came to look to government for<br />
protection from the world, and our industrial relations<br />
became poisoned by confrontation as worker battled with<br />
employer over their share of a cake that was not growing<br />
sufficiently fast to accommodate all their demands on it.<br />
These attitudes were reini-orced and entrenched by a long<br />
period of largely uninterr~ upted conservative rule when<br />
governments were too short:-sighted to realise that Australia<br />
couldn't be the ' lucky country' forever. They simply put<br />
of f the task of preparing for change. They put it in the<br />
' too hard basket'.<br />
Today, those postponed challenges have well and truly<br />
arrived. Other countries, including in our region, are<br />
developing highly competitive mining industries.<br />
Agricultural trade has been thoroughly corrupted by the<br />
destructive subsidies of -the EEC and the retaliatory actions<br />
of the US. As the twentieth century draws to a close wealth<br />
creation is now clearly as~ sociated, not with the cultivation<br />
and extraction of natural resources, but with the exercise<br />
of ingenuity with resource-poor Japan being the great<br />
proof of that.<br />
Our objective, then, must be to achieve the kind of<br />
fundamental changes that allow us at last to meet those<br />
challenges and to adapt to this new and more competitive<br />
world. The policy changes I announced in the Parliament last<br />
Tuesday constituted another instalment, and a significant<br />
one, in our continuing progress towards this objective.<br />
And in turning now to the content of the Statement, I would<br />
first caution against any analysis which fails to put the<br />
specific policy changes I announced into their complete<br />
context. </p>
<p>Certainly, each of the measures is significant in itself.<br />
But they must be related to each other and, beyond the<br />
immediate parameters of the Statement, to our continuing<br />
reform activities in other fields.<br />
In the Special Premiers Conferences, our three year<br />
waterfront reform program, our shipping reforms, our<br />
historic opening up of telecommunications and domestic<br />
aviation, the massive changes taking place in award<br />
restructuring and union amalgamation, our continuing<br />
expansion of training and re-training, our long-standing<br />
commitment to ecologically sustainable development and our<br />
continued improvement of social justice in Australia in<br />
all these fields, that is across the broadest front of<br />
reform, we are achieving, and will continue to press for,<br />
dynamic and fundamental restructuring of both the<br />
institutions of Australian economic and social life, and of<br />
the attitudes Australians bring to then.<br />
And, specifically on the Special Premiers Conferences, let me<br />
point to the very substantial amount of work being prepared<br />
for our May meeting.<br />
Last October, the Premiers and I established working groups<br />
of State and Commonwealth officials to prepare reports on:<br />
regulatory reform, road transport, rail freight, Government<br />
trading enterprises, non-bank financial institutions, and<br />
electricity generation. These reports will create the<br />
momentum for reform in each of these areas for the remainder<br />
of 1991.<br />
So as Prime Minister I can give you this double assurance.<br />
Where reform can be achieved through the exercise of<br />
Commonwealth power alone, we will achieve it as we are<br />
doing in reforming work practices on the waterfront. And<br />
where reform requires the co-operative endeavour of the<br />
Commonwealth and the States, we are doing all we can to<br />
secure that co-operation as we are doing in the case of<br />
each of these working parties.<br />
In all of these reforms, competitiveness is the key. A<br />
critical element in building competitiveness is the<br />
reduction, where possible, of the cost burdens imposed on<br />
business. Cutting tariffs is one essential reform Australia<br />
needed to make in order to reduce these burdens.<br />
As I said in detail at the National Press Club on Wednesday,<br />
tariffs penalise competitive, outward looking, export<br />
industries to nurture uncompetitive, inward looking,<br />
domestically-oriented industries. But tariff reductions<br />
will not, of themselves, foster the growth of newly<br />
competitive enterprises. Much more needs to be done and we<br />
have set about doing it.<br />
That is why, for example, we have set about promoting<br />
improved efficiency in those sectors of the economy which,<br />
although not themselves directly competing on international<br />
markets, provide important inputs for those that do: </p>
<p>chiefly our services industries and, particularly,<br />
transport. We have recognised and accepted this challenge.<br />
I was pleased to be able to report on the Conaust agreement<br />
last Tuesday, an important step in our three year program of<br />
waterfront reform. The acceptance of this agreement by the<br />
Waterfront Industries Re:;. orm Authority will see new<br />
agreements in place for 180 per cent of our waterfront<br />
traffic. We are determined to ensure that coverage is<br />
complete within the timez: able we have laid down.<br />
Reform of land transport has to proceed in concert with the<br />
States and has to deal simultaneously with road and rail to<br />
ensure that relative prices to users of the two modes<br />
properly reflect costs and encourage efficient use of<br />
resources. Our land transport strategy being pursued<br />
through the Special Premiers' Conferences will shortly see<br />
the establishment of a National Rail Freight Corporation and<br />
the institution of nationally based regulation and charging<br />
for road use.<br />
But in all this we did nat accept the argument that tariff<br />
cuts had to be delayed until we were further down the path<br />
of microeconomic reform. That would have been to ignore the<br />
unassailable case that tariff cuts in themselves directly<br />
and massively promote competitiveness through lower business<br />
costs. At the same time, we hava reduced business costs through our<br />
taxation measures. Taxation affects business costs in a<br />
variety of ways: directly, in the prices of inputs, and<br />
indirectly, through the deductions allowed against revenue<br />
in defining profit for tne purposes of the Tax Act.<br />
Measures in my statement addressed both these issues,<br />
further widening exemptions from sales tax allowed to inputs<br />
to production, and radically reforming the depreciation<br />
provisions of the Tax Act. These measures build on our<br />
earlier reforms that significantly reduced the burden of tax<br />
on business, and the distortions it can create, through<br />
reducing the corporate tax rate to 39 per cent and<br />
introducing tax imputatiDn.<br />
Finally, though not insignificantly, we have put Australia<br />
on a low-inflation path thanks in large part to the wage<br />
restraint practised by the trade union movement under the<br />
Accord. We now have a rate of inflation lower, at 6.9%,<br />
than the OECD average and trending lower. Lower inflation<br />
means lower interest rates and less pressure on business<br />
costs; and lower business input costs, through tariff and<br />
taxation cuts, means in turn less pressure on inflation.<br />
Competitiveness is created not just in the accounts of<br />
businesses though that is clearly an important aspect.<br />
Competitiveness requires attitudinal change on the part of<br />
all Australians, throughout the economy. I </p>
<p>6.<br />
The experience of the world's most successful wealth<br />
creating countries teaches us we must become a clever<br />
country. Our researchers must be encouraged; our educational system<br />
must function as well as possible; our students must be able<br />
to take the fullest advantage of their talents; all our<br />
workers must have access to training and be encouraged to<br />
participate fully in the labour market.<br />
These have been high priorities for this Govern'ent. On<br />
Tuesday I announced the award of the first fifteen grants<br />
under the Cooperative Research Centres program; indefinite<br />
extension of the tax deduction for research and development<br />
at 125 per cent; measures to improve the quality of schools<br />
and provide more post-graduate awards; provision of<br />
resources to help maintain apprentice numbers through the<br />
recession; and assistance, through work experience programs,<br />
to the longer term unemployed to equip themselves to return<br />
to employment.<br />
In an important sense all these elements of competitiveness<br />
come together in the workplace itself. If the activity that<br />
goes on there doesn't pick up and carry through the building<br />
of a competitive Australia, all the other measures will have<br />
been in vain. My Government has, from its earliest days,<br />
recognised the vital importance of a cooperative and<br />
creative relationship between workers and employers and has<br />
worked to overcome the destructive atmosphere of<br />
confrontation that was the legacy of the years of<br />
conservative rule.<br />
My Statement announced further support for the processes of<br />
union rationalisation and workplace reform which are<br />
essential to the creation of an industrial relations system<br />
that will contribute to building a competitive Australia.<br />
But it went much further, recognising that we must compare<br />
ourselves with the best in the world and strive to emulate<br />
them. I was pleased to accept the Business Council's<br />
suggestion for a project to provide international benchmarks<br />
for the operations of our major public sector enterprises<br />
and especially gratified that John Prescott accepted our<br />
invitation to chair the board that will oversee our new<br />
workplace culture program.<br />
Let me come finally to the area that is, paradoxically, at<br />
the greatest distance from, and at the very heart of, the<br />
process of building a competitive Australia: our social<br />
policies. A more competitive Australia will better provide<br />
the resources to enable us to continue to provide an<br />
adequate social safety net.<br />
And part of our achievement has been to focus a greater<br />
quantity of public resources on assisting those in real need<br />
within a budget that is leaner and, through our successive<br />
surpluses, making a smaller demand on national savings. </p>
<p>In the same way, we have made enduring and absolutely<br />
essential decisions in regard to the preservation of our<br />
natural environment, but we have done so within an economy<br />
that has generated 1.5 million new jobs. And, with the<br />
processes of ecologically sustainable development, we are<br />
seeking to establish a way to resolve competing demands on<br />
our precious natural heritage.<br />
The aspiration to live in a fair and prosperous society, the<br />
desire to pass on to our = hildren a rich and sustainable<br />
environment, are surely fundamental values. They should be<br />
values embraced by all of us.<br />
In this fundamental sense, building a competitive Australia<br />
is synonymous with building a better Australia. It is for<br />
this deep yet simple reason that the challenges I outlined<br />
last Tuesday are so vital, and it is why we must all, as<br />
Governments, workers, employers and consumers, accept the<br />
responsibility of meeting those challenges.<br />
