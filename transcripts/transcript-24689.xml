    <content><![CDATA[<p>As you might be aware, Australia is on track to meet and beat our Kyoto targets.</p>
<p>By 2020, we will have cut greenhouse gas emissions by five per cent on 2000 levels. That’s equivalent to a reduction of 13 per cent on 2005 levels.</p>
<p>On a per capita basis, this is a better performance than the United States, Canada, Japan and Europe.</p>
<p>Through the Government’s Direct Action policy, we’re taking sensible action here at home to improve the local environment and reduce emissions.</p>
<p>Already, through our Direct Action plan, 47 million tonnes of emission reductions have been purchased.</p>
<p>We’re on our way to planting 20 million trees by 2020 and we’ve rolled out more than 350 Green Army projects around the country.</p>
<p>The Government is currently considering Australia’s emissions reduction target for the post-2020 period.</p>
<p>Under this Government, Australia will continue to make a strong and responsible contribution to the global effort to address climate change, but we’ll do this without sacrificing jobs or prosperity.</p>
<p>That’s why the Government will never resort to harmful policies like a carbon tax or an ETS.</p>
<p>A carbon tax, or an ETS, is really just a tax on everyone’s electricity bill.</p>
<p>The Labor Party wants to bring the carbon tax back and force everyone to pay more.</p>
<p>This Government will not.</p>
