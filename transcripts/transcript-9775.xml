STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE MON P J KEATING MP<br />
THE SECOND FRENCH NUCLEAR TEST<br />
I deplore the latest French nuclear test at Fangataura. The test Ignores the<br />
understandable outrage of the international community at the French Government's<br />
first test and compounds the sense of anger felt by regional countries as a result of<br />
continued testing.<br />
This decision runs against common sense, France's good name In this region and<br />
around the world has been further damaged, and the test Is contrary to the wishes of<br />
the 71 per cent of the French people who want the French Government to cease<br />
nuclear testing in this region.<br />
. Australia's efforts to press the French Government to abandon Its testing program<br />
will be unceasing and unrelenting until the French Government hears the clear<br />
message from nations around the world to abandon its nuclear testing program. Our<br />
campaign will continue with the same vigour until all the testing stops.<br />
The Australian Government does not accept that nuclear tests are necessary for the<br />
purposes stated by the French Government * to protect France's national security, to<br />
ensure the safety of the French nuclear cOeterrent and to develop simulation<br />
technology. The French Government must explore more fully the technical<br />
alternatives to further tests.-<br />
The French Government has failed to ask the question: would nuclear tests of this<br />
kind be tolerated in metropolitan France? Clearly they would not. The French<br />
Government must accord the South Pacific the same respect that it reserves for<br />
metropolitan France.<br />
Australia fully supports the statement from the recent South Pacific Forum meeting<br />
that called on France to<br />
desist from further tests in the region and to close associated facilities, except<br />
those required for future environmental monitoring;<br />
accept full and exclusive responsibility for any adverse impacts from its<br />
testing on the Pacific environment and people;<br />
provide access to the international community to all scientific data it holds and<br />
to the testing sites themselves to enable an independent and comprehensive<br />
assessment of the risks Involved; </p>
<p>2<br />
* Sign and ratify the Protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty.<br />
Only these actions would show that France takes seriously its obligations towards<br />
those countries In our region with which it seeks good relations. If France cannot<br />
even agree to the region's reasonable requests for scientific access, it demonstrates<br />
its disregard for the Interests or the South Pacific community.<br />
Australia Is well advanced In Its negotiations with like-minded countries In bringing a<br />
resolution before the 50th session of the United Nations General Assembly in the<br />
coming weeks, which would constitute a strong statement of international opposition<br />
to nuclear testing and call for an immediate end to such tests. This will build on<br />
similar resolutions and statements made in the parliaments of many nations around<br />
the world, In International organisations such as the IAEA, and In regional groupings,<br />
Including the South Pacific Forum and the ASEAN Regional Forum, and will leave<br />
the French Government In no doubt about the breadth of opposition to nuclear<br />
testing.<br />
We will continue to facilitate campaigns of Information and contact between the<br />
Australian and French people so that the basis of the opposition of Australians to the<br />
testing program and the intensity of their feelings are understood In France.<br />
The recall of the French Ambassador to Australia. France's announcement Nhat It will<br />
sign a truly comprehensive test ban treaty in 1996, and suggestions that the number<br />
of tests may be reduced are all signs that our campaign is having en effect. With<br />
every new test It holds, the immediate and the long-term costs to France increase.<br />
