L I BR<br />
VISIT TO C ANADA U. K.<br />
LONDO, U. K.<br />
PRESS CONFEAENCE TIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. H. iROLD HOLT AT LOIDON AIRPORT 12TH JUIE 1967.<br />
Q. Mr. Holt, why have you been pressing the<br />
British Government so hard to maintain its presence east<br />
of Suez.<br />
MR. HOLT: ', ell, because I think it is in the interests<br />
of the United Kingdom I think it is in the interests of<br />
the Commonwealth, I tAink it is in the interests of<br />
security and progress in the whole area.<br />
Q. ', ould you be happy and content to have<br />
British troops in Australisabases if it came to that?<br />
P. M. Y. e discussed this some time ago and the basis<br />
then was that if the United Kingdom was not able to maintain<br />
its presence because of the attitude of the countries concerned<br />
in Singapore and Ialaysia then either the would have to<br />
retire to the United Kingom or else come lo bases in<br />
Australia and talks have been proceeding at the Service<br />
level on this contingency. But, in point of fact, of course<br />
the Governments both of alaysia and Singapore warmly<br />
welcome the retention of British forces in the area.<br />
Q. You criticised western European countries<br />
for taking too little interest in the Far East, particularly<br />
Vietnam, and yet you have limited your own commitment to<br />
Vietnam very severely, would you comment on that?<br />
P. M. . ell, when you say " we have limited", I don't<br />
know what you mean quite by that. Â® e have doubled our<br />
defence expenditure over the past four years. are now<br />
running on defence expenditure close to five per cent of<br />
the gross national product, that is higher than any<br />
country with the exception of the United States and the<br />
United Kin dom, any western country anyhow. For us it is<br />
not a small thing when we have to develop a vast continent,<br />
cope with a much more rapid population growth rate than<br />
either the United Kingdom or the United States, and we have<br />
to deal with the problems of placing these people in<br />
occupations, in homes with all the facilities which go<br />
with a growing population. It may interest you to know<br />
that Australia withholds a bi-ger percentage of its gross<br />
national nroduct from consumption than any country except<br />
Japan, far higher than the United Kingdom or the United<br />
States, so we don't rely on others to do the job for us.<br />
Q. Do you think a visit to the Far East would open<br />
Mr. : ilson's eyes?<br />
P. M. Vell I would like to see many United<br />
Kingdom and 7estern European leaders go to that area of the<br />
world because I think they would be tremendously impressed<br />
by the potentialities that are developing there. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
It was an eye opener for me to go to Korea for<br />
example and see what 30 million South Koreans were aoing with<br />
one of the highest rates of gross national product in the<br />
world to go to Taiwan where 15 million industrious people<br />
there were also generating one of the highest rates of<br />
gross national product.<br />
But I haven't come here to twist anybody's arm<br />
you know. I'm here to discuss in a sensible way with a<br />
sensible man and his colleagues what is in the oest<br />
interests not only of our respective countries, but of the<br />
Commonwealth as a whole.<br />
Some peoole have said that what they call your<br />
Government's'obsession' with China is rather overdone,<br />
especially the need to keep american troops on the mainland.<br />
Would you comment on that?<br />
Well, what do you mean by our ' obsession with<br />
China'? . e trade cuite vigorously with China. It has<br />
become a very big customer for Australian wheat, wool tons<br />
and matters of that sort.<br />
I myself envisa e that there must be an accommodation<br />
with China and we must, if we can, build bridges of co-operation<br />
with China. I have no obsession with China. i. e're not<br />
troubled about the possioility as it existed strongly of<br />
communist expansion right down through South East Asia,<br />
affecting Indonesia and in effect providing a communist<br />
camp right through that whole area of Asia. Well, this<br />
has been avoided and the issue is currently being fought<br />
out in Vietnam.<br />
C. To leave the Far East, would you comment on the<br />
Middle East situation. You described it earlier as ' a<br />
great deal of huffing and puffing', I believe.<br />
P. M. No, where did you read that or who attributed<br />
that statement to me? I've read a lot about this but I<br />
have not made a puolic statement to that effect.<br />
I'm just wondering where it<br />
I picked it up from the press, from the press<br />
clippings. P. M. Yes, but where was I alleged to have said it?<br />
eQ. I can't remember now.<br />
P. M. No, well nobody seems to know ecause I don't know<br />
of any place where I have said it. But I did myself earlier<br />
take the view that knowing the major powers, or at least in<br />
my own judgment believing hat the major powers on the<br />
information that I had, were not wishing to involve<br />
themselves in that situation, coming to the conclusion that<br />
it would be a relatively limited operation there.<br />
You see, I was contrasting what was happening out<br />
there with what to me are much more fundamental, deener issues<br />
really involving an historic phase in mankind's development<br />
in the Asian area.<br />
Q. If we-tern countries can play a useful part in the<br />
Far East, can Australia play a useful part in the Middle East?<br />
P. M. I don't think we can play a large part in the / 3 </p>
<p>Middle Last, but Australia has always been a good supporter<br />
of the United Nations and helpful. in what has been proposed<br />
by the United Nations.<br />
One of the big problems which remains ahead of<br />
us I think is the settlement of the Palestinian Arabs<br />
and if the United Nations in their wisdom decided that there<br />
should be opportunity for resettlement elsewhere for these<br />
refugees, or else adequate compensation to enable them to<br />
settle somewhere of their choosing, then Australia would,<br />
proportionately to its population, as a member of the<br />
United Nations, play a part in this either in settlement<br />
or in the degree of compensation that had to be provided.<br />
C. Could I put a supplementary question to that?<br />
Do you mean that Australia would accept some Palestine Arabs?<br />
P. M. Well Australia, after the last ', orld ar, accepted<br />
quite a number of Chinese refugees who have become integrated<br />
in the community, I don't imagine myself there would be many<br />
Araos who would want to settle in Australia, and what I<br />
have said relates to this being dealt with as an international<br />
problem with the member nations of the United Nations each<br />
being prepared to play their part. If that were done,<br />
Australia would play a proportionate part, either acceptance<br />
of some for settlement or where others wished to settle<br />
elsewhere, making our contribution to whatever compensation<br />
arrangements were desired.<br />
I might add this is not a matter which has been<br />
canvassed in my Cabinet, but I know how we reacted to the<br />
situation we found after the Second ' Iorld ' ar. Australia<br />
has become a permanent home for many people of many countries<br />
there are more than 40 nationalities substantially<br />
represented in Australia at the present time anA we will<br />
play our part, but this would be a part of an international<br />
settlement involving member countries of the United Nations.<br />
Q. Just after the SEATO Conference in " iashirngton<br />
it was reported that there was an emergency meeting of the<br />
Australian Cabinet. WVould you confirm that there was an<br />
emergency meeting of the Australian Cabinet?<br />
P. M. After<br />
Q. At the time of the SATO Conference in i. ashington<br />
in May. That is what was reported here.<br />
P. M. I don't recall any emergency meeting of the<br />
Australian Cabinet.<br />
Q. A special meeting? This is what was reported here<br />
and what I was going on the say<br />
P. M. Every meeting of the Australian Cabinet is a special<br />
meeting in my opinion.<br />
Q. Well, it was reported as an emergency meeting.<br />
This might have been misreporting.<br />
P. M. Well, I think the House was in session at that<br />
time and we found it necessary because of the pressure of<br />
Cabinet business to meet even while the House was sitting<br />
which is not comfortable but is inevitaole in a country which<br />
has as many things to deal with as we find we have to deal<br />
with. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Can I put it in another way, sir? Would<br />
you confirm or deny that at that time you heard reports<br />
that Britain in advance of any consultations between<br />
Australia and Britain had indicated that she had plans<br />
to withdraw from east of Suez by the beginning of the<br />
1970' s.<br />
P. M. I'm not troubled too much by plans that<br />
people have because we all have plans to meet a variety of<br />
possibilities. W hat is important is decisions not plans,<br />
because plans can project all sorts of answers to various<br />
problems. I've come here to discuss with the Prime<br />
Minister of the United Kingdom the kind of decision that<br />
might come and he has assured me that no final decision<br />
will e taken until we have hbid those talks.<br />
I had a very curly question bowled up to<br />
me in the United States on their Meet the Press' session.<br />
My interrogator opened up by saying " Now that the<br />
United Kingdom has decided to withdraw completely east of<br />
Suez do you expect the United States to fill that vacuum?"<br />
I haA to sa " I must challenge your premises. I've yet<br />
to be told hat the United Kingdom has finally decided on<br />
a withdrawal east of Suez."<br />
In fact, I've been assured that no final<br />
decisions on these matters are -oing to be taken until at<br />
least I and other Commonwealth leaders have had a chance<br />
of discussing these matters with the Prime Minister.<br />
cQ. And you are satisfied with those assurances?<br />
P. M. Well, are you asking me to say that I don't<br />
accept assurances from the 3ritish Prime Minister and his<br />
colleagues.......... Q. Jell, do you have any doubt?<br />
P. M. I accept the assurances.<br />
( Press Secret. ry interjecting " Perhaps<br />
just one last question." Laughter when the Prime Minister<br />
said: " No, I'm enjoying this.")<br />
Q. Could I just ask you on the Common Market<br />
issue what particular points you intend raising with Prime<br />
Minister Wilson?<br />
P. M. yell, we have welcomed the assurance, of<br />
course, that essential Commonwealth interests will be<br />
safeguarded, but the problem we have in my country is that<br />
what might annear to be a comparatively small interest in<br />
the eyes of the United Kingdom or of other Governments can<br />
be an important interest inside Australia itself because<br />
we are a lar-e country, sparsely populated, and there are<br />
some communities which depend for their existence on a<br />
particular production and, as John IcEwen, my Deputy Prime<br />
Minister, said it doesn't help the man who produces dried<br />
fruit very much to be told that Australia is going to he<br />
very well off because it is selling a lot of iron ore.<br />
I think of a settlement like Mildura which<br />
has been irrigated there are a lot of former soldiers<br />
settled there and they produce dried fruit. To us it </p>
<p>is a community with a lot of real people and it's no<br />
good telling us that our essential interests are being<br />
safeguarded if in noint of fact, whole communities of this<br />
sort are to find themselves withuut a reason for existence,<br />
economically and socially and otherwise.<br />
Q. Do you accept that we are now better off as<br />
a result of the Kennedy Round and that we can now absorb the<br />
blow of British entry into the Common Market more easily?<br />
P. M. All I know that came out of the Kennedy<br />
Round, as far as Australia was concerned, was a deal on<br />
wheat which fell far short of Australian objectives and<br />
which required us to convert what had been a voluntary<br />
wheat aid provision of 150,000 tons a year to a commitment<br />
even in bad wheat years of 225,000 tons a years Noone's<br />
throwing their hats up in the air auout this in Australia<br />
anyhow, but there it was.<br />
C. Sir, will you be discussing with Mr. wilson<br />
the subject of the chain of Indian Ocean Island bases?<br />
P. M. No, I wouldn't expect to. I don't want to<br />
be involved in technical defence discussions. I am here<br />
to canvass with him some of the larger policy issues which<br />
concern us both.<br />
Q. But in so far as those island bases represent<br />
a peripheral commitment, would you be satisfied with that<br />
if the British don't w'ant to be committed to the mainland<br />
of Asia?<br />
P. M. No I don't want to comment on that. I'm<br />
not even sufficiently well informed to know how far they<br />
represent effective operational bases.<br />
Q. Mr. Holt, in the last defence White Paper<br />
it does say the eventual aim of British policy is that'<br />
it will remain in South East Asia as long as it is<br />
unstable, but the eventual aim is that these people should<br />
live at peace without the presence of external forces. Now<br />
do you accept that eventually it will be possible to do<br />
without British forces in the area or are you trying to<br />
change the Government's mind even about this?<br />
Oh no, I would myself look to the time when<br />
the countries of the region, having strengthened their<br />
economies and made their own community position secure<br />
would be making not only an increasing contribution to<br />
security in the area but would be able largely to stand<br />
on their own feet though as far ahead as I can see I<br />
think there will be a need for some co-operative defence<br />
effort and, indeed, that makes sense rather than have any<br />
individual country commit so much of its resources to its<br />
own defence. There ought to be security arran ements<br />
among like-minded people which apply to the area as a whole.<br />
Q. Then the debate between Britain and Australia<br />
is over the timing of the eventual withdrawal and you<br />
perhaps are scared that jritain will do it far sooner<br />
than Australia would like.<br />
P. M. , ell you have used the word ' debate'.<br />
One doesn't usually debate things with one's friends unless<br />
one is in the mood to have that kind of dialogue. I would<br />
say that I am looking forward to a discussion and a<br />
mutually helpful discussion on matters in which we are<br />
mutually interested. / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
C. But is that the point, that you do accept<br />
that eventually British forces will withdraw and Australia<br />
will not have any objection, out you are anxious to see<br />
that they don't withdraw too soon;<br />
P. M. No, I think it is a matter for the United<br />
Kingdom Government to decide what serves its own interests<br />
best. After all, three-fifths of humankind are located<br />
east of Suez, you know, and the trade potential, the<br />
growth of commerce and industry in that area over the<br />
next 50 years will, I think, astonish the world. I've<br />
been in some of these countries recently and I was<br />
astonished to find how rapid the progress had been in<br />
countries such as Korea and Taiwan. Australia's own trade<br />
has gro7n east of Suez from 15 per cent to 40 per cent<br />
since the 1950' s. Janan has become the largest purchaser<br />
of Australian goods over this neriod and we see tremendous<br />
economic growth in this area.<br />
' ell, I can't imagine that the United<br />
Kingdom which has always had an eye to its own<br />
international trading position, being oblivious to these<br />
thins. Even Hong Kong is a very valuable outlet for China.<br />
It's one of the great enerators of foreign exchange for<br />
China and eventually China will form part of the<br />
international community of nations and 700 million people<br />
will be wanting a lot of things that others can supply.<br />
Q. To sum it up. Sir, you are not pessimistic<br />
that the vital interests of Australia and Britain can ue<br />
reconciled? You don't think there is a natural dichotomy<br />
there that can't be reconciled?<br />
P. M. ' ell I've always ever since I came into<br />
public life believea that Australian interests and the<br />
interests of the United Kingdom were closely linked both in<br />
defence and in trade. After all, you've been until this<br />
year, the largest purchaser of Australian goods. ' e<br />
happen to oe the largest holder of sterling reserves and<br />
as we grow stronger economically I would hope we would be<br />
able to assist you in that direction also.<br />
