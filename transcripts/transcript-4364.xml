ADIRESS AT OPENING OF UT'I0C'S FACTORY, CANTERBURY, SYDNEY<br />
I ami very pleased to be here today to open Elotton's new ham and<br />
Smallgoods Factory. Some people may think it's a good thing<br />
that a politician should be opening a factory that can cure<br />
hams in a very short time. I Personally think, it' 5 a bit<br />
ironic t-hat a politician should be opening a factory -whose<br />
company potto is " Don't Argue''. But the fact that the new<br />
factocr is designed like a refrigerator is probably enough to<br />
ccol even a politician down.<br />
One thing I would c-retairuly not argue with is that significat<br />
ncwy investments such as t-his factory are what this country needs.<br />
' iThe cr-eate employ-tent, increase procluctivity, and improve<br />
jitW. tralia's cotpetitd. ve position.. in port markets'. Thiz is,<br />
I am advised, one of the mos; t advanced factories of its type<br />
in Auistralia. It certainly looks advanced compaxed with the<br />
old factory, but on the other hand, it lacks the distinction<br />
of: being classified byv -the national tru~ st. But I do'n't<br />
suppose anyone really miinds that.<br />
The factory incorporates the latest equipment and complies with<br />
the rigorous standards set by the Department WE Primary Industry.<br />
It can export to all foreign markets. Built at a cost of<br />
million it represents a sizeable capital investment and<br />
an important addition to industry in the Cante: fbury area.<br />
It: will provide zn incoase productive capacity of up to 75 percent<br />
and waill, iin the longer ra~ n, provide additional -emplayment<br />
oipportunities. 11: is most grat. ifying to see a long established AuStrLincmny<br />
lieHuttons, expressing its confidence in the fu~ ture in a most<br />
pract. ica3. way. B3y initiating substantial new investment.<br />
Just two years ago, the econom~ y had come to a standstill there<br />
was almost no growth at all, and investment, had fal-: len seriously.<br />
Sic the-n, the GovernmenL has made substantial headway in creating<br />
t he environment conducive to a sustained economic recovery.<br />
Our growth rate has now picked up again. 1nvestmek-nt.. assi~ ted<br />
a3 this factory has been by our forty percent investment<br />
allowance has risen, amd there is now every reason for confidence. </p>
<p>2.<br />
of course, there is still much to be done. Inflation bas been<br />
reduce-J, but must be l. owered further. Unemployment is too high<br />
and-the Goverrnent _ 43 determined to beat inflation so that more<br />
Jcbscan be created.<br />
Yiestex-day, a major contribution was made to the fight against inflati<br />
and mainploymnent. The Connonwealt-h and all Statc Premiers \ Cunain~-<br />
nously erndarsed a th-ree Riont-h lialt iz price ar. ad income irmcxeases<br />
This halt -was recoqnised by all Australian heads of gove-nxnent as<br />
being in the national nth-erest. This national effort requires the<br />
support of every one of us.<br />
we are calling for voluntary agreement to the plan by all<br />
employe-es, all unions, all self-employed in shorl[ t, every person ard4<br />
every insti-tution which set levels of prices and incomes.<br />
This includes all goveraments, each of which have agreed not to<br />
increase it;-s owin char-gces during the three months period.<br />
I believe this is a geniunely workable plan. It will take commitment<br />
on the part of all of us. I believe that as a nation we have that<br />
corimtment, to overcm -ng in~ flation and overcomniq unemployment.<br />
Anothert topic very much in the Dews at the moment-is industrial relati<br />
n ayidustries, i-nuludinq this one, there -is rooma for<br />
all improvement in i ndustrial relations. Too often in the. past,<br />
comm, ur i cationis between c lyesand employees haobroken down.<br />
But there arc som e encouraging ~ ln. I understand the Federal<br />
Emplovers Assoc iati4on aT-d Lhe Australiasian Meat Indust.-y ! Ilopi yees<br />
Union are to hava discussions here in Sydney next week, to tr-y and<br />
t-hrash out outstiiding problems, and devise ways ofE settlng<br />
industrial disputes before -the position is reached where2<br />
e'mployees resor-t to direct industrial action. Good communications<br />
benefits ev. er-yone. Mnagemnent, -anions and every emfploye-e hnave<br />
a responsibility in brixnginq it. about.<br />
I was pleased to hear that you, atHuttons, a-re endeavourilng<br />
to imp-rove Qorrwrnication between all sections of your busines<br />
Such measures as the intzoduction of a staff newsletter; active<br />
consuiltation lietween ; shop coirmmitt; ees and managemTrent on a wide<br />
range of issues affecting employees; and an emphasis on. improving<br />
occupational health and safety all should help.<br />
It is essential to good industrial relations, that there be<br />
c onsultation on nch issues as the working environment and<br />
industrial safety,<br />
The Government's view is that P. mployees and employers should<br />
establish consultative machinery of their own choosing, d1-esigrned<br />
to further communication and an understandinq of the comn interestc<br />
of employers and ermployees. What a comtpany does is important not<br />
only to its shareholders, but also to its employees.<br />
Why, for example, should employees first learn of decisions<br />
v~ italiv affecting their future in the papers? Compa. ny' imanagament<br />
should spend more timne and effozt in taking employ,: ee; s into<br />
the confidence. Informing employees about the company's<br />
performanice, -its pros pects for -investivent, and for px-ovidiri<br />
ewJobs. In this respect, I am very pleased to cee tLhat<br />
t here are a larcge number o_-f ernployees here today. t sometimes<br />
happents that when some co~ mpan ies open a neCw plant O~ c deel o. r at </p>
<p>almost everyone is t~ here -customers, suppliers, xianaqement<br />
People, and politicians -but no enmployees. Employees An my<br />
view should always be at the openings of this sort. Without<br />
the-, n there would. be no new plant and no inidustry. E fp. oyees<br />
should be able to reqard the conipany they work for as their<br />
company, and have causie to be proud of that fact.<br />
w4e all have an interest in ensuring a profitable and successful<br />
private sector a profirable private sector is the key to<br />
Aust: alia's economic prosperity. Only a profitable privatf-e sector<br />
carn provide the jobs.. and pxoducts, that Australia ne~<br />
ndbetter industrial relations have an important part. t~ o play<br />
in making Australia more prosperous-<br />
PRecen-tty, the Governmnt has created a new departivent, the<br />
Depatmrent of Froductivity, to promote reforms in industry,<br />
such-as those I h~ ave described, which lead to greater productivity<br />
and " aster growth.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, this new Factory is a welCome development<br />
both for the Canterbur' area, and for .4% stxalia. 1 -would urge<br />
business generally to follow thi5 ex. alrple and invest in-It<br />
0own and Australi~ future.<br />
It g; Lves me great ple).-asu-re to declare the factory officially open,. </p>
