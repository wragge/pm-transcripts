PRIME MINISTER] 2/ 92<br />
PRIME MINISTER MEETS RURAL REPRESENTATIVES<br />
The Prime Minister and minister for Trade, Mr Kerin, met<br />
rural representatives today to discuss the implications for<br />
trade following President Bush's visit to Australia last<br />
week. The PM told the meeting that talks he and the National<br />
Farmers Federation had with the President had ben extremely<br />
successful for Australia and had left the President with a<br />
much greater understanding of the need to reach a successful<br />
outcome to the Uruguay Round.<br />
The meeting resolved to follow up commitments made by<br />
President Bush during his visit, chiefly the undertaking by<br />
the US to examine not extending the ExportEnhancement<br />
Program to new markets which may imp56 adversely on<br />
Australia. Issues arising from the Bush visit will be taken up by<br />
Australian officials when they meet their U. S. counterparts<br />
in washington early next month.<br />
The PM also told the group he had personally written to key<br />
European leaders to seek their support for a successful<br />
conclusion to the Urugay Round.<br />
Letters were sent last night to the German Chancellor Dr<br />
Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister, Mr John Major as<br />
well as the chairman of the EC Member States, Portuguese<br />
Prime Minister Dr Antonio Cavaco Silva.<br />
In the letters the PM told the European leaders that the<br />
views of the European Community countries would be critical<br />
to any assessment of whether negotiations could be<br />
successfully concluded in the coming months.<br />
He said that during his visit to Australia President Bush<br />
had a displayed a positive attitude to the ' Dunkel package<br />
and that the United States, as well as Australia, believed<br />
the Uruguay Round could not be allowed to fail.<br />
The Prime Minister's letters stressed the importance of a<br />
successful outcome for the Round and said the immediate<br />
economic prospects of the international economy as well as<br />
the longer term strength of the international trading system<br />
would be significantly worsened by a collapse of the<br />
negotiations. January 8 1992 </p>
