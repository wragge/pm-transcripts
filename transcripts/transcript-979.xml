ZOR PRESS P. M. Ho. 63/ I964<br />
AIR TRANSPORT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Ht. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
After recent airline litigation, the position<br />
of the Commonwealth x was carefully considered.<br />
In the result, I wrote to each Premier<br />
offering certain views and suggesting certain future<br />
action. It has never been my practice to publish<br />
letters to the Premiers until they have had ample time to<br />
receive and consider them.<br />
Sir Thomas Playford, alone, has now thought<br />
fit to make public my letter.<br />
In the circumstances, I will now approach<br />
the other Premiers who have made no statements to ask<br />
whether I heive their permission to publish the terms of<br />
the letter.<br />
CANBERRA, 19th August, 1964.<br />
x ( in relation to intra-State aviation) </p>
