PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA -THURSDAY, 21 JANUARY, 1982<br />
VISIT OF PRESIDENT KARAMANLIS<br />
OF GREECE<br />
The President of the Hellenic Republic, His Excellency<br />
Mr. Constantinos Karamanlis, will make a State Visit to<br />
Australia from Tuesday 9 to Sunday 14 March, 1982, at the<br />
invitation of the Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen.<br />
I am looking foward to welcoming President Karam anlis as<br />
the first Greek Head of State to visit Australia.<br />
The visit will be an important opportunity to further<br />
strengthen the already close relations between Australia and<br />
Greece. The ties between the two countries are wide-ranging<br />
but none is more important than the personal links which have<br />
resulted from Greek migration to Australia. The President's<br />
visit will serve to reinforce the friendship between the Greek<br />
and Australian people and promote co-operation and understanding<br />
between the two Governments.<br />
As well as visiting Canberra, the President will visit Sydney<br />
and Melbourne. Following consultations with the State<br />
authorities the details of his itinerary and programme<br />
will be announced. 000---</p>
