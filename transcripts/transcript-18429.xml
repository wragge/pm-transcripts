The Prime Minister today welcomed events around the world to mark Commonwealth Day, the annual celebration of the Commonwealth of Nations held each second Monday in March.</p>
<p>The theme for this year's Commonwealth Day is Connecting Cultures, a theme that reflects the unique character of the Commonwealth, as an association not just of nations but of peoples.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth represents around one quarter of the world's countries and one third of the world's population, and accounts for all of the world's major faiths. Its membership is diverse but is brought together by a commitment to shared values of democratic freedom, open government, and economic and social development.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister announced that Senator Jan McLucas, Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, will attend the traditional Commonwealth Day observance in London's Westminster Abbey early tomorrow (Canberra time).</p>
<p>Senator McLucas will join Her Majesty The Queen, Prime Minister David Cameron, heads of government and Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma at the multi-faith service.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister welcomed similar celebrations in cities around Australia today, noting that this year's Commonwealth Day held special significance for Australia following its successful hosting of the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Perth in October.</p>
<p>As current chair-in-office of the Commonwealth, the Prime Minister said that CHOGM 2011 had reaffirmed the enduring value of the Commonwealth and that leaders were working to make the association even stronger into the future. </p>
<p>The Queen will also deliver her annual message to Commonwealth countries today.</p>
<p>2012 marks The Queen's diamond jubilee, representing the 60th anniversary of The Queen's accession to the throne and as head of the Commonwealth. </p>
