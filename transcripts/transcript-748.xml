COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
Rt. Hon. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />
M. P.<br />
ON<br />
DEFENCE REVIEW,<br />
MINI STERIAL STATEMENT.<br />
[ From the Parliamentary Debates," 22nd May, 1963.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister).-by leave-May I begin<br />
with some general observations of no great<br />
novelty, but the recollection of which is<br />
essential to a uiseful review of Australian<br />
defence. Every defence programme must,<br />
in its nature, be flexible. As international<br />
strategic considerations change, so we must<br />
be ready to change our own defence<br />
arrangements. Every measure we adopt is<br />
so adopted with knowledge of the appreciations<br />
put before us by our expert military<br />
and diplomatic advisers. In other words,<br />
the condition of an effective defence programme<br />
is that it should be based upon as<br />
accurate an assessment as can be made of<br />
the probable source and nature of the apprehended<br />
attack, the area of possible conflict<br />
and the nature of the operations, and the<br />
nature and extent of the co-operation we<br />
-may expect from and give to the United<br />
Nations in general and our allies in particular.<br />
Plainly, most of these elements<br />
are not static; hence the importance of being<br />
ready. to. accept changes when their need<br />
arises. Again, ther e are internal and equipment<br />
factors which, whatever new proposals are<br />
adopted, will affect the rate of increase in<br />
defence expenditure. For example:. Naval<br />
vessels iave to be designed, laid down, built<br />
4647163. and equipped over a substantial period of<br />
time; aircraft cannot -be bought out of existing<br />
stocks, and their domestic produotion,<br />
having regard to their enormous complexity,<br />
cannot be encompassed except over a period<br />
of years; and the Army cannot in time of<br />
peace be strengthened numerical-ly and in<br />
terms of equipment and training very suddenly.<br />
I give those illustrations for this<br />
reason: I will be giving some new figures<br />
for our anticipated defence votes. They will<br />
indicate substantial increases; but, because of<br />
the time factors which I have referred to,<br />
those increases will be smaller in the earlier<br />
part of the programnme than in -the later.<br />
In -brief, no government in Australia should<br />
announce a dramatic increase in defence<br />
expenditure for 1963-64 just for the sake of<br />
doing so. All new proposals must be<br />
-phased over the necessary period of time.<br />
In October last, my colleague, the Minister<br />
for Defence ( Mr. Townley), whose con-<br />
-timied absence through ill health we all<br />
-regret so deeply, announced a new threeyear<br />
defence program-me covering the years<br />
1962-63 to 1964-65. He emphasized that<br />
the programme was not static, and that adjustments<br />
would be made as new circumstances<br />
developed. In January of this year,<br />
following a review of the naval programme,<br />
which had been left a ' little vague in the </p>
<p>October proposals, we announced some<br />
additional measures for strengthening the<br />
Royal Australian Navy. I will not repeat<br />
these two announcements in detail, as copies<br />
of them are available to honorable members.<br />
But it may be helpful for an understanding<br />
of the financial quantum of our new<br />
measures if I now set out the financial involvement<br />
of those earlier announcementsthat<br />
is, October plus January. Based on a<br />
continuance of the approvals given before<br />
our current review, the annual expenditures<br />
were estimated to be as follows:-<br />
1962-63<br />
1963-64<br />
1964-65<br />
1965-66<br />
1966-67<br />
1967-68 212,200,000 219,200,000 220,000,000 222,000,000 220,000,000 220,000,000<br />
Those figures give a total-necessarily<br />
approximate in the case of future<br />
years where costs are unknown--of<br />
œ 1,313,000,000 over six years-<br />
œ 651,000,000 in the first three years and<br />
œ 662,000,000 in the second three years. I<br />
want no confusion on this matter. I repeat<br />
that this is the last October three-year programme<br />
plus the January addition in the<br />
case of the Navy.<br />
We have now completed a further comprehensive<br />
review of developments in Southb<br />
East Asia. We have noted the uncertainties<br />
in Laos, the acute problems in South Viet<br />
Nam, the conflicts which exist over the<br />
creation of the new Federation of Malaysia<br />
-which we heartily support-and events in<br />
and concerning West New Guinea. It certainly<br />
cannot be said that we have entered<br />
a period of stability in the area of immediate<br />
strategic concern to Australia. We have<br />
made this recent review in the light of our<br />
treaty arrangements, but particularly in<br />
reference to the security of our own country<br />
and of the Territories of Papua and New<br />
Guinea. We will defend these territories as<br />
if they were part of our mainland; there<br />
must be no mistaken ideas about that.<br />
We have decided that there should be a<br />
further progressive increase in our military<br />
capability and preparedness. I will take the<br />
three services in order. It will be recalled<br />
that as recently as January we announced<br />
two large naval projects--the purchase ot<br />
a third guided missile destroyer and the procurement<br />
of four " Oberon" class submarines.<br />
We have now approved of provision<br />
for fitting the Ikara anti-sibmarine missile, which is under development in Australia,<br />
with United States of America cooperation,<br />
into the Type XII. frigates and<br />
the guided missile destroyers. This will be<br />
a most significant development in anti-submarine<br />
warfare. We have also approved of<br />
the building in Australia of a 15,000-ton<br />
escort maintenance ship. We have reviewed<br />
our 1959 decision that fixed-wing naval<br />
aviation should cease in 1963. After recent<br />
re-appraisals of the wing-fatigue life of the<br />
Venoms and Gannets, and reports of the<br />
very low wastage and accident rate, we have<br />
decided that fixed-wing flying is to continue<br />
until the Venoms and Gannets reach the<br />
reasonable end of their service life. This<br />
will be about 1967 when the position can<br />
be reviewed. These aircraft will, of course,<br />
be used in conjunction with the Westland<br />
Wessex helicopters already under delivery.<br />
The personnel strength of the will<br />
be increased from the , present approved<br />
total of 13,900 to about 14,300.<br />
I turn now to the Army: Last year it was<br />
decided to increase the permanent Army<br />
strength from 21,000 to 24,500 by June,<br />
1965. We have now approved of a further<br />
increase to 28,000. The order of battle of<br />
the permanent field forces will be expanded<br />
by the formation of a third regular battle<br />
group. This will add considerably to the<br />
flexibility of our forces and their ability to<br />
operate in a variety of circumstances. The<br />
Australian Regular Army Reserve will be reconstituted<br />
to ensure that its members are<br />
medically fit, up to date in their training,<br />
and ready. There will also be an increase in<br />
the strength of the Pacific Islands Regiment,<br />
which includes Australian officers and some<br />
senior Australian non-commissioned officers.<br />
The present strength of the regiment is<br />
about 700. This will be doubled as soon as<br />
possible, consistently with adequate training<br />
and equipment. When that has occurred<br />
further developments will then be considered.<br />
No major change is at present proposed<br />
in the organization of the Citizen<br />
Military Forces, but its target strength of<br />
32,500 will be increased to 35,000. Major<br />
purchases of new equipment for the C. M. F.<br />
-and that is very important when it comes<br />
to recruitment-have now been approved.<br />
The procurement of modern equipment is,<br />
of course, essential. Current expenditure in<br />
this field is running at the annual rate of </p>
<p>about œ 1 1,000,000. We have now approved<br />
as an objective the provision of the equipment<br />
and reserves needed by the Australian<br />
Regular Army and C. M. F. components of a<br />
complete pentropic division of five battle<br />
groups with appropriate combat support and<br />
logistic units. To meet this, expenditure on<br />
Army equipment, which has been running<br />
at about œ 11,000,000 annually, will rise to<br />
œ 14,000,000 in the coming financial year,<br />
and to 17,500,000 in the succeeding years.<br />
The items will cover the whole range of<br />
weapons and ammunition, engineering and<br />
technical stores, radar and radio, vehicles<br />
and landing craft. There will be additional<br />
purchases for the Army light aircraft squadron.<br />
These are separate from the purchases<br />
under the Air Force programme, which I<br />
shall mention later. The increasing Army<br />
strength will require a considerable expansion<br />
of the construction programme. It is<br />
provisionally estimated that the Army vote,<br />
this year œ 68,000,000, Will rise to<br />
œ 87,500,000 in 1964-65 and to œ 97,000,000<br />
by 1967-68. But I will return to the general<br />
financial figures later on.<br />
We have approved of a number of<br />
important new projects for the Royal Australian<br />
Air Force.<br />
A major feature of the re-equipment programme<br />
has been the introduction of the<br />
Dassault Mirage Ill, jet fighter to replace<br />
the Avon Sabre. The Mirage has an<br />
advanced supersonic performance and is<br />
regarded by those who are in a position to<br />
speak as the best fighter available in the<br />
world for our purposes. As honorable<br />
members know, orders have already been<br />
placed for 60 of these aircraft. The first,<br />
from French production, has already been<br />
handed over to the R. A. A. F. and is undergoing<br />
tests and trials. Deliveries of the<br />
remainder, which will contain increasing<br />
quantities of locally assembled and constructed<br />
components, will commence late this<br />
year. We recently secured an option on a<br />
further order of 40 Mirage fighters. We<br />
have decided now to take this up, thus bringing<br />
the total to 100. At the same time, since<br />
the effective employment of fighter aircraft<br />
depends more than ever before on adequate<br />
ground control of their movements and<br />
operations, we have approved the purchase<br />
of two new control and reporting units and<br />
these are vastly complex and costly things. One of them is to be at Brookvale in New<br />
South Wales and the other is to be mobile.<br />
Tactical air transport support for the<br />
armed forces has also received attention. We<br />
give it a high priority. Last October, we<br />
approved of the purchase of eight heavy-lift<br />
helicopters and twelve fixed-wing short takeoff<br />
and landing aircraft, subject to R. A. A. F.<br />
evaluation and selection. It has been found<br />
that a suitable type of heavy-lift belico-pter<br />
is not at present available. We have therefore<br />
decided to purchase a further eight Bell<br />
Iroquois utility helicopters in addition to<br />
the sixteen already approved, and to purchase<br />
eighteen Caribou Mark 1. fixed-wing<br />
aircraft, which have a proved capability as a<br />
short take-off and landing aircraft in South-<br />
East Asian conditions. The introduction of<br />
both of these types will complement, in the<br />
tactical field, the strategic mobility provided<br />
by the Hercules Cl130 transports.<br />
In addition to the current extensive programme<br />
of airfield works and development<br />
in such places as Darwin, Amberley, Williamtown,<br />
East Sale and Townsville, we have<br />
now approved of major and extensive improvements<br />
to the airfield at Boram, near<br />
Wewak, in New Guinea. This will have<br />
great value for defence purposes, for civil<br />
aviation, and for the general development of<br />
the Territory. Overall, the new projects for<br />
the Air Force will require an increase in<br />
personnel strength from the present target<br />
of 16,440 to something of the order of<br />
18,300. It will be observed that I have so far not<br />
spoken of the problem of the re-equipment<br />
of the strike-reconnaissance force. This is<br />
an important matter. The Canberra is by<br />
no means obsolete; it is still being used by<br />
overseas air forces, including those of Nato.<br />
But we are giving close consideration to the<br />
future as we must. There are, of course,<br />
great financial problems, but there are vital<br />
questions as to the availability of suitable<br />
types to meet our requirements. Having<br />
regard to our special geographic circumstances,<br />
we must consider range, the capacity<br />
to perform both reconnaissance and attack<br />
and the ability to use existing runways and<br />
services. An on-the-spot evaluation by a<br />
team of qualified experts is necessary, as it<br />
was in the selection of the Mirage. Such a<br />
team will be sent overseas at an early date, </p>
<p>under the Chief of the Air Staff, to investigate<br />
and report. Then, of course, the<br />
Government will consider the matter further<br />
in the light of the report.<br />
I now turn to the total programme figures,<br />
putting in parallel columns, for clarity, the<br />
figures I quoted earlier, on the existing programme,<br />
and the new figures based upon the<br />
announcements I have just made, but without<br />
anticipating or estimating the cost of a<br />
striking reconnaissance replacement-<br />
Annual expenditure<br />
in existing<br />
programme based Annual expenditure<br />
on a continuance in new programme.<br />
of approvals given<br />
before this review.<br />
Ern. Em.<br />
1962-63 212.2 212.2<br />
1963-64 219.2 237.5<br />
1964-65 220 253.4<br />
1965-66 222 269.6<br />
1966-67 220 277<br />
1967-68 220 269. 5<br />
Total 1,313.4 1,519.2<br />
This means that, beginning in 1963-64,<br />
the average increase in the defence vote<br />
over a period of five years will be of the<br />
order of œ E41,000,000 a year, leaving out of<br />
account a Canberra replacement and assuming,<br />
of course, that no additional proposals<br />
are approved during that period.<br />
The effect of these decisions, when they<br />
are carried out, will be to establish a fully<br />
equipped, fully modern, fully supported<br />
pentropic division. We will have an Air<br />
Force able to provide a measure of strategic<br />
and tactical mobility, and with 100 supersonic fighters, properly controlled, to<br />
provide air protection. We will have a<br />
relatively small but modern Navy equipped<br />
to defend our shores, and to seek out and<br />
destroy the submarines on which an enemy<br />
is likely to rely in order to deny us that<br />
command of the seas without which the<br />
overseas employment and support of a<br />
division is impossible.<br />
Such forces will provide a significant and<br />
welcome addition to any allied effort<br />
required in our area of strategic concern.<br />
But they will do more in that they will<br />
provide a capacity -for independent action<br />
to meet the initial shock of any emergency<br />
with which we may in the future find ourselves<br />
faced.<br />
The increases I have announced will<br />
impose substantial additional burdens upon<br />
the Budget in a period in which the need<br />
for national developmental expenditure will<br />
be great and growing; greater in proportion<br />
than may be the case in older and more<br />
developed countries. But we feel that such<br />
burdens will be cheerfully accepted by our<br />
people. They are, of course, not solely<br />
financial burdens. The improvement of the<br />
nation's defences will require much public<br />
co-operation, by those who join the forces<br />
and, in the case of citizens who join the<br />
C. M. F. and the reserves, by those who<br />
employ them. We look for this co-operation<br />
with complete confidence.<br />
I lay on the table the following paper:-<br />
Defence Review-Ministerial Statement, 22nd<br />
May, 1963-<br />
and move-<br />
That the paper be printed.<br />
By Authority: A. J. ARTHURt, Commonwealth Government Printer, Canberra. </p>
