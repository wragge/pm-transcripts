CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
ADDRESS TO MYER SEMINAR, MELBOURNE, 5 SEPTEMBER<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, Young People<br />
It was with particular pleasure that I was able to<br />
accept your invitation to attend this Seminar.<br />
1. Int erna . tional Youth* Year is a very important year for<br />
Australia as a nation, and its young people in<br />
particular. After the most careful process of consultation and<br />
planning we as a Government have put together a<br />
strategy Priority One that will improve and<br />
integrate our many policies and programs for young<br />
people. It is a strategy that makes an unprecedented<br />
assault on the problems and needs of our young people.<br />
In my address to the nation on 18 August, and in the<br />
Government's Budget for 1985/ 86, we have outlined the<br />
main components of that strategy. I pointed out that<br />
the solutions we are seeking are not simple, cheap,<br />
easy or swift and will need the full cooperation of all<br />
Australians. Especially, we will be relying on the<br />
cooperative effort of employers, unions and active<br />
community groups everywhere in the country.<br />
The initiative taken by Myers Stores and Target in<br />
running this seminar program, is precisely the kind of<br />
responsive attitude we need from the business sector.<br />
At the heart of the Government's strategy is a<br />
determination to see our young people properly<br />
qualified for the work force. We want to see as many<br />
of our young people as possible employed.<br />
If our young people are to get jobs, they should be<br />
properly trained and equipped for the work force. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Our schools do a good job in educating young peopl--:,<br />
but for some young people different or additionaltraining<br />
is needed.<br />
Most young people about to leave school are handicaPped<br />
by a lack of knowledge and familiarity with the labDour<br />
market. At least 100,000 young Australian school<br />
leavers enter the labour market each year with no<br />
further systematic vocational training. It is both in<br />
their interests and the wider community interest that<br />
some bridging mechanism be found.<br />
The Government's response to this pressing need is to<br />
institute a traineethip scheme. You will know from my<br />
address to the nation that we are aiming to have 10,000<br />
traineeships created in 1985/ 86 so that young 16 and 17<br />
year old school-leavers can benefit from a combination<br />
of vocational training and work.<br />
By 1988 we will be looking to that 10,000 traineeships<br />
becoming 75,000 traineeships per year.<br />
The fact that 2,500 young people have participated in<br />
these seminars seminars organised to explain job<br />
opportunities available to young people, to guide them<br />
in the best way of applying for a job and to provide<br />
some work experience is proof positive that young<br />
people are eager to acquire the sorts of vocational<br />
skills that will help them make the successful leap<br />
from the world of schooling and dependency, to the<br />
world of work and independent responsibility.<br />
You will not need me to tell you that the success of<br />
the traineeship scheme the Government has now proposed<br />
will depend heavily upon the willingness of employers<br />
to take advantage of the incentives being offered by[<br />
the Commonwealth, as well as on the TAPE system to<br />
provide the off-the-job training that will be an<br />
essential element of the program. Their cooperation,<br />
and that of the unions directly concerned is crucial.<br />
Areas of the labour market that we have already<br />
identified as likely environments for traineeships are<br />
the tourismn and hospitality industry, the banking and<br />
finance industry and the retail industry. We hope to<br />
see early progress in these areas.<br />
The retail industry, with its 93,000 establishments<br />
across Australia, and another 27,000 establishments in<br />
the motor vehicle and accessories sector, is the<br />
largest singl. e private sector employer in Australia,<br />
employing about one million people. And there are<br />
within this industry many companies large and small, of<br />
similar goodwill and concern for young people as the<br />
Myer Stores and Target. These willI be among the<br />
forerunners in offering tCraineoslhips to young people<br />
like yourselves in both the immediate and long-term<br />
future. </p>
<p>Young people themselves will not be the onl~ y ones to<br />
benefit from the training and valuable experience that<br />
traineeships will offer, but industry too will benefit<br />
from the better equipped and more adaptable workforce<br />
that will result.<br />
The traineeship scheme is, of course, only one part of<br />
the total package of reforms and provisions that we<br />
have adopted a-s our strategy for young people. It is<br />
nevertheless the most immediate and relevant part for<br />
those of you who are here today.<br />
Indeed I should like to offer my strongest endorsement<br />
for this approach by Myers Stores and Target, to<br />
congratulate those of you who have put in your best<br />
efforts to make the retail industry more efficient and<br />
effective, and to offer my best wishes to all young<br />
people who next year or in the near future will be<br />
leaving school and putting their skills to work in the<br />
labour force. </p>
