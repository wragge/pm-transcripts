FOR 105/ 1971.<br />
NEW YEAR'S DAY<br />
MESSAGE FROM THE PRITME M~ INISTER<br />
My Colleagues in Government and I wish you all a<br />
Happy New Year. I believe 1972 offers us all a great opportunity to<br />
make real progress towards the fulfilment of our long term goals<br />
of security, progress and prosperity.<br />
And I believe there are two main ingredients for<br />
success confidence and co-operation.<br />
There is no problem so great that it cannot he solved,<br />
but we must have a will to win and a readiness to meet each other<br />
half way. The past year has had its problems. I do not wish<br />
to minimise them, but we must keep them in persp ective.<br />
Inflation, the rural crisis and industrial strife have<br />
proved troublesi~ mc at home. World prices for our international<br />
currency exchange rates have added to our difficulties.<br />
We have been sadd( ened by the tragedy of the war between<br />
India and Pakistan. But I have every confidence in our future and I ask you<br />
to share that confidence.<br />
So in 1972 let us press forward with the business of<br />
making Australia a better country for us all.<br />
CANBERRA, 31st December, 1971. </p>
