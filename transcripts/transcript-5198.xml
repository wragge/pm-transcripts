EWBARGO UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, THE HON JO: NT<br />
STREET ( ON BEHALF OF THE PRIME MINISTER) TO THE WANNON<br />
ELECTORATE, 18 NOVEMBER, 1979 A<br />
HELLO, THIS IS TONY STREET, STANDING IN FOR MALCOLM FRASER, As<br />
HIS ELECTORAL NEIGHBOUR, TONIGHT IT IS MY PLEASURE TO SPEAK TO<br />
THE PEOPLE OF WANNON.<br />
1Y RESPONSIBILITIES AS MINISTER FOR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS TAKE<br />
IN MANY AREAS, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH IS WAGES,<br />
AT PRESENT THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION COMMISSION IS<br />
HEARING WHAT I CONSIDER. TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT NATIONAL WAGE<br />
CASE SINCE THE SYSTEM OF CENTRALISED WAGE FIXATION BEGAN IN<br />
1975. FOR SOME TIME NOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ARGUING THAT WAGE<br />
RESTRAINT IS AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY. OUR<br />
VIEW IS THAT EXCESSIVE WAGE INCREASES LEAD DIRECTLY TO<br />
UNACCEPTABLE PRICE INCREASES, AND THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE ENJOY<br />
ANY REAL GAIN OUT OF WAGE INCREASES, FURTHERMORE, THE FEW<br />
GAINS THAT SOME PEOPLE GET ARE OFTEN AT THE PRICE OF OTHERS'<br />
MISFORTUNE. 1 </p>
<p>LABOUR IS LIKE MOST OTHER COMMODITIES IF THERE ARE LARGE AND<br />
RAPID INCREASES IN ITS PRICE PEOPLE BUY LESS.<br />
YET THAT IS PRECEISELY WHAT SOME PEOPLE DEMAND FOR THE COMMODITY,<br />
IN THIS CASE LABOUR, AND THAT MEANS HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT.<br />
NONETHELESS, THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT ALL PARTIES<br />
GOVERNMENT, EMPLOYERS AND UNIONS HAVE TO ACCEPT THE DECISIONS<br />
OF THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION COMMISSION AND OTHER<br />
INDUSTRIAL TRIBUNALS. IN HANDING DO'WN IT'S LAST NATIONAL I'/ AGE<br />
CASE DECISION, A FULL BENCH OF THE COMM1ISSION SAID THAT IT HAD<br />
BEEN BROUGHT TO THE BRINK OF ABANDONING WAGE INDEXATION. IT<br />
SAID THAT -THE ACTIONS AND ATTITUDES OF VARIOUS PARTICIPANTS IN<br />
THE SYSTEM WERE INCOMPATIBLE WITH ITS EFFECTIVE OPERATION AND<br />
THE SYSTEM WAS NOT WORKING, THAT IS WHAT MAKES THIS CURRENT<br />
HEARING SO IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE OF WAGE FIXATION.<br />
WHILE ALL PARTIES STATED, AFTER THE LAST HEARING THAT THEY WERE<br />
IN FAVOUR OF CENTRALISED WAGE FIXATION, ONLY THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS MADE A CONSTRUCTIVE EFFORT TO RE-ESTABLISH THE..<br />
CONSENSUS ON WHICH THE CURRENT SYSTEM ULTIMATELY RESTS, ONLY<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN PREPARED TO MAKE<br />
CONCESSIONS IN RETURN FOR: A COMMITMI. ENT FROM ALL PARTIES NOT TO<br />
PURSUE OR GRANT WAGE CLAIMS OUTSIDE THE WAGE FIXATION<br />
PRINCIPLES AND A REJECTION OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION IN SUPPORT OF<br />
SUCH CLAIMS. 9II 3 I, </p>
<p>OUR PROPOSALS WERE IMMEDIATELY REJECTED BY THE LABOR PARTY AND<br />
THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT WHO HAD NOTHING TO OFFER BETWEEN THEM<br />
EXCEPT THE SAME TIRED OLD SELFISH VIEWS, IT IS PRECISELY THIS<br />
SORT OF UNTHINKING STUBBORNESS WHICH HAS LED TO THE CURRENT<br />
DIFFICULTIES IN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,<br />
NOW, IN THE CURRENT HEARING, THE LABOR GOVERNMENT IN NEW SOUTH<br />
WALES HAS ACCEPTED THAT THE COMMONWEALTH HAD INDEED MADE A<br />
SIGNIFICANT MOVE TOWARDS CONSENSUS, IN PARTICULAR THEY HAVE<br />
STATED THAT ALTHOUGH THEY PREFER QUARTERLY HEARINGS THEY COULD<br />
LIVE WITH 6 MONTHLY HEARINGS IF THERE WAS AUTOMATIC ADJUSTMENT.<br />
WIHILE WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT THEY HAVE SAID VERY<br />
CAREFULLY IT IS REFRESHING TO SEE A LABOR GOVERNMENT BEGINNING<br />
TO THINK CONSTRUCTIVELY ABOUT HOW WAGE FIXATION SHOULD BE<br />
CONDUCTED. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS FRESH APPROACH TO THE PROBLEMS HAS NOT BEEN<br />
TAKEN UP BY THEIR COLLEAGUES IN THE FEDERAL PARLIAMENT,<br />
AT ITS FEDERAL CONFERENCE, THE LABOR PARTY GAVE UNDERTAKINGS TO<br />
THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT THAT, IF ELECTED, IT WOULD SUPPORT<br />
AUTOMATIC FULL INDEXATION EVERY THREE MONTHS, FURTHERMORE,<br />
THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF STOPPING THERE. THIS CLEARLY IS A<br />
MINIMUM ON WHICH THE UNIONS WITH INIDUSTRIAL MUSCLE WOULD BE<br />
FREE TO BUILD TO GET EVEN LARGER WAGE INCREASES. .4 </p>
<p>THE FEDERAL LABOR PARTY HAS TO MAINTAIN ITS DISCREDITED WAGES<br />
POLICY NO MATTER WHAT THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, NO MATTER WHAT<br />
THE-INFLATIONARY EFFECTS, AND NO MATTER WHAT THE RISKS IT MEANS<br />
FOR THOUSANDS JOBS,<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY SHOWN THAT IT IS<br />
PREPARED TO BE FLEXIBLE. WE WILL NOT BE LOCKED INTO POLICIES<br />
WHICH DO NOT MEET THE NEEDS OF THE TIMES, OUR AIM IS TO SEE<br />
FIHATEVER WAGE INCREASES ARE AWARDED ARE CONSISTENT WITH<br />
NATIONAL ECONOMIC NEEDS AND THAT INDUSTRIAL DISRUPTION IS KEPT<br />
TO A MINIMUM.<br />
WIE WILL CONTINUE TO ACT POSITIVELY AND CONSTRUCTIVELY IN ORDER<br />
TO ACHIEVE THOSE AIMS, </p>
