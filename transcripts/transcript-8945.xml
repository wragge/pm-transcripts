PRIME MINMISTER J 96/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINSTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
NATIONAL COMPETITION POLICY REVIE W<br />
The report of the National Competition Policy Review is being publicly released today.<br />
The report argues for a consistent national approach to cormpetition policy and<br />
proposes a range of mechanisms and new institutional structures to deal better with<br />
anti-competitive conduct, unjustified regulatory restrictions on competition, the<br />
structural reformn of public monopolies, third party access to essential facilities,<br />
monopoly pricing and competitive neutrality.<br />
I welcome the report and believe it to be an important contribution towards furthering<br />
competition policy in Australia. I would likc to thank the members of the inquiry,<br />
Professor Fred Hilmer, Mr G3eoffTTapcrell and Mr Mark Rayner for producing such a<br />
high quality, broad ranging and challenging report<br />
The report has been given to all Premiers and Chief Ministers and the Commonwealth<br />
will be discussing the report in detail with State and Territory governments. Initially, a<br />
Common wealth-State officials group will examine the report for the purpose or<br />
providing a paper to assist discussion at a Council of Australian Governments meeting<br />
late this year.<br />
Competition policy is an important and integral element of the Commonwealth's<br />
overall microeconomic reform agenda. We are already progressing with the States and<br />
Territories on a number of reform initiatives in key sectors of the economy such as fair<br />
and free trade in natural gas and a national electricity grid, which have major<br />
competition policy dimensions. We will continue to pursue these initiatives<br />
concurrently with our consideration of thc National Competition Policy Review report.<br />
