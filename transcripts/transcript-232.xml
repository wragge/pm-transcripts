UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSVJBLY<br />
Porliamentary Statement by the Prime Minister and Minister<br />
for External Affairs<br />
The Prime Minister -nd Minister for External Affairs,<br />
Mr. R. G. Menzies, made the following statement leave in the<br />
House of Representatives on October<br />
I arrived at the United Nations General Assembly on the<br />
afternoon of Friday, September 30th. The general debate was on.<br />
President Soekarno spoke for two hours. He circulated a copy of his<br />
speech. The speech consisted of 66 pages of foolscap. There was an<br />
added slip circulated. It was marke d, " Vital," and was tc be inserted<br />
at page 65. This sheet contained the terms of the proposed five-power<br />
resolution of vyhich I became aware for the first time, the five powers being<br />
Ghana, India, the United Arab Republic, Yugoslavia and Indonesia. The terms<br />
of the pro-osed resolution were these<br />
The General Assembly, deeply concerned with the recent deterioration<br />
in international relations which threatens the world with<br />
grave consequences, aware of the great expectancy of the world that<br />
this Assembly will assist in helping to prepare the way for the<br />
easing of world tension, conscious of the grave and urgent responsibility<br />
that rests on the United Nations to initiate helpful efforts, requests,<br />
as a first urgent step, the President of the United States of America and<br />
the chairman of the Council of M. 1inisters of the Union of Soviet Socialist<br />
Republics to renew their contacts, interrxpted recently, so that their<br />
declared willingness to find solutions of the outstanding problems by<br />
negotiation may be progressively implemented.<br />
For some reason, my distinguished friend, the Prime Minister of India, rose<br />
at the end of President Soekarno's speech and formally moved the resolution.<br />
I was, I confess, greatly conce'rned about the terms of the resolution, not<br />
because of its opening paragraphs, with which everybody wuld agree, but<br />
because of the operative clause, that operative claize being the request that<br />
the President of the United States of America named as suoh and the<br />
Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist<br />
Republics should renew their contacts.<br />
That was a very, very important proposal. First of all, it had<br />
defects and it had dangers. " To renew their contacts, interrupted recently"<br />
was a clear reference, if to anything, back to the Paris conference when there<br />
was to be a Summit Conference, when the four people were to meet. That was<br />
the only period of interruption, and the contacts which were interrupted were<br />
interrupted at Paris when those four great men were to meet. Yet, Sir, the<br />
resolution moved by Mr. Nehru did not call for a Summit Meeting of the four; </p>
<p>* 2. it called for something quite different. It did not call on the four great<br />
men, the four responsible men, the four men who led atomic power, to meet<br />
again; it called on two people out of the four. That seemed to me to lend<br />
colour to what I believe to be the false but no uncomming propaganda that the<br />
real world issue is between the Soviet Union and the U. S. A.<br />
The first real step was to get the four atomic powers, the four<br />
powers which have it, beyond all understanding, the great powers of peace<br />
and war in their hands, to meet. I would have thought that that was the first<br />
thing to get those four people to come together, not because of some oddities<br />
about Great Britain or the United States or France not at all but because<br />
they happened to be the people who had atomic weapons and who, therefore,<br />
had enormous powers of life and death for all the rest of us in the world.<br />
Something could come, from my point of view, of a meeting between the four;<br />
nothing could come of a resolution which said that two out of a resolution which<br />
said that two out of the four ought to meet together.<br />
That resolution was moved, and the the distinguished Prime Minister<br />
of Great Britain, the Rt. Hon. HaroldMaaillan, and I he very naturally, end<br />
I by some chance were invited to come to Washington to see the President of<br />
the United States early on Sunday morning, October 2nd. Very naturally we agreed.<br />
We said we would go.<br />
On Saturday, October 1st, I had lunch with Mr. Macmillan and with<br />
Lord Home. We had a little talk and we then flew to Washington. I dined with<br />
them at the Australian Embassy with our Ambassador, Mr. Howard Beale. We dined<br />
and we talked about these matters. Like me, they were troubled about the<br />
resolution, and they were troubled about it for very obvious reasons. Straight<br />
out support of the resolution would be travelling, we all thought, in the wrong<br />
direction. Here was a resolution which said, " Let two people get together<br />
and then everything may be arranged". But, on the other hand, straightout<br />
opposition if we all voted " no" would be misinterpreted. People would look<br />
at the first three or four recitals in the resolution, all in favour of<br />
pease, and then, if we voted " no", we would be told that we did not want peace.<br />
Therefore, straightout opposition would be misinterpreted.<br />
That was a very difficult problem, Sir, I suggested on the Srturdnay<br />
night that an amendment in positive terms might be put, and my el. stinguished<br />
friends Mr. Macmillan and Lord Hone having heard what I had to say about this<br />
matter, said that they would like to think it over. On the next morning, at<br />
9.30 a rather intolerable hour on Sunday norning, we went to the White<br />
House. My colleague my former colleague, our distinguished Ambassador,<br />
Mr. Beale, was there, and we had a close discussion President Eisenhower,<br />
Mr. Herter, the Secretary of State, Mr. Macmillan, the distinguished Prime<br />
Minister of Great Britain, Lord Home, the Foreign Secretary, and myself.<br />
I think, Sir, that I might be allowed to say that that morning,<br />
and under those circumstances, the Americans were worried about the position<br />
that had been created by the five-power motion. The President hinself had<br />
received letters from the five powers India, Indonesia, Ghana, Yugoslavia<br />
and the United Arab Republic enclosing the resolution, The President had<br />
been working on a draft reply setting out reasons why a personal and special<br />
meeting with Krushchev was not in the then atmosphere acceptable. I would not<br />
wish honourable members to believe that this was a rather dour attitude on<br />
the part of the United States of Amercia. All honourable members who have<br />
witnessed these things know that Kr: u.-':. hev had made it just about as difficult<br />
as anybody could make it for a meeting to occuro<br />
In the course of the talks on the Sunday morning I said and let<br />
me say at once that I take full responsibility for this that I thought it quite<br />
useless to be coning down in favour of a resolution which on the face of it drid<br />
some wrong things, as I understood them, or to be coming down flatfooted against<br />
the resolution, in which case a lot of people would misinterpret the vote and<br />
misinterpret the views, for better or for :-crse., and I s3-21" thir: for<br />
better, I said " This kin-of reslutio i o J can<br />
flat-footedly oppose or flat-footedly support. </p>
<p>* OWhy do we not have an amendment of this resultion which will bring the whole<br />
of the United Nations back to the realities of the position?"<br />
I say this,. because I understand there are some people who think that<br />
I was a sort of fall guy. I think that is the term. On the contrary. I have<br />
great pride in being the Prime Minister of this country and in having views of my<br />
own on behalf of my country. Therefore, I said to them, " Well, why not have an<br />
amendment? Why meet this thirgfull face? Let us have an amendment which in<br />
positive terms will say what we believe to be the truth?" Wehad a discussion<br />
about that. I do not want anybody to believe that they all agreed at once with<br />
what I had to say, but at least I said it.<br />
I want honourable members to understand that the Urnited States of<br />
America was itself deeply concerned about this matter. It knew that to have a<br />
resolution passed which put the whole onus on the President of the United States<br />
was wrong. The Americans knew that this was putting the whole situation out of<br />
balance. They knew, as I believe, that this idea that the whole conflict in the<br />
world is between the United States and the Soviet Union is a false idea, a wicked<br />
idea, something that has been devised and promulgated by people for no good<br />
purpose. Therefore, they were deeply concerned. So, Sir, after an ahour and a<br />
half of discussion that morning, I said that I thought we ought to have an amendment.<br />
I did not care very much who moved it, but we ought to have an amendment. There we<br />
were the President of the United States of America; Mr. Herter, the Secretary<br />
of State; Mr. Macmillan, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; Lord Home,<br />
the United Kingdom Foreign Minister,. and myself. WLc were all discussing this<br />
matter to and fro.<br />
In the meantime, President Eisenhower had received a letter from the<br />
five powers, signed by Dr. Nkrumah of Ghana, and containing the resolution, about<br />
which I will say something later. The President himself had been, for the previous<br />
S 24 hours, discussing with his advisers the problem of how this letter ought to be<br />
Vanswered. For better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, I came in with my<br />
idea that you could not deal with a problem of this kind by saying " yes" or " no"<br />
that you might deal with it by saying, " Here is a positive proposal". And the<br />
positive proposal that I htd to make was that there ought to be a renewed effort<br />
to get a Summit Meeting of the Four not some theoretical meeting of the Two,<br />
but a positive Summit meeting of the Four.<br />
We debated that and they said, " Well, do you have an amendment in mind?"<br />
I said, " Yes". They said, " What is it?" I indicated it in a rather vague way,<br />
and said " All right. I will go away and draft it." This is very interesting. We<br />
__ finished at 11 o'clock on Sunday morning. I went off, having promised to draft<br />
V an amendment and to send it to the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, at lunchtime<br />
and to Mr. Macmillan and Lord Home, they got it by lunchtime. There it was. With<br />
some small amendment, that was the amendment that I moved in the United Nations<br />
General Assembly. They received it at lunctime and after luch we met at the British<br />
Embassy the British Prime Minister, Lord Home, Mr. Herter and I. They had the<br />
V terms of this proposed amendment. By the time we had talked it out on the Saunday,<br />
I understood I have no reason to believe now that I had been wrong that they<br />
approved of it. I think it is proper, Sir, to tell this House in my own country what the<br />
proposal was. In the early part of the five-power resolution there had been three<br />
paragraphs with which nobody could quarrel. My amendment was designed, not to<br />
omit the earlier paragraphs, which-were quite good, but to omit the last paragraph.<br />
The amendment was in these terms'<br />
Omit the last paragraph of the draft resolution submitted by Ghana,<br />
India, Indonesia, the United Arab Republic and Yugcolavia ( A/ 4522),<br />
and substitute theref or the following:<br />
I must ask honourable members to forgive me for this strange form of words used in<br />
the United Nations<br />
RECALLING that a Conference between the President of the United States of America,<br />
the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist<br />
Republics, the President of the French Republic and the Prime Minister of the<br />
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was arranged to take place </p>
<p>in Paris on 17 May, 1960, in order that these four leaders should examine matters<br />
of particular and major concern for their four nations,-I think that is something.<br />
that every honourable member would agree with Recalling the fact that the four<br />
great leaders had met, not to discuss all the problems of the world,, but to<br />
discuss matters on which they, as the leaders of the four great atomic powers,<br />
might have something to say. The amendment continued<br />
RECALLING FURTHER that the Conference did not actually begin its work,<br />
NOTING that the President of the United States of America, the President of<br />
the French Republic and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great<br />
Britain and Northern Ireland thereupon made a public statement in the terms<br />
following:<br />
I quote the words of three out of the four<br />
" They regret that these discussions, so important for world peace,, could<br />
not take place. For their part, they remain unshaken in their conviction<br />
that all outstanding international questions should be settled not by the<br />
use or threat of force, but by peaceful means through negotiations. They<br />
themselves remain ready for take part in such negotiations at any suitable<br />
time in the future".<br />
I think it is not a bad idea to recall the minds of honourable members to the fact<br />
that three out of the four leaders of the powers at Paris used those words, and<br />
meant them. I went on from that to say in my amendment<br />
BELIEVING that much benefit for the world could arise from a cc-operative<br />
meeting of the Heads of Government of these four nations in relation to those<br />
problems which particularly concern them,<br />
Obviously, those problems were, for the atomic powers, Berlin and all those things<br />
which are flsh-points of international affairs<br />
BELIEVING FURTHER that progress towards the solution of those problems would be<br />
a material contribution to the general work for peace of the United Nations,<br />
URGES that such a meeting should be held at the earliest practicable date.<br />
I would have expected, Sir, speaking in my own Parliament and among my own people,<br />
that nothing would be said against that view. Here it was. Here was a call to<br />
the four great powers to sit down together and try to make the world more safe for<br />
ordinary people.<br />
I out in my amendment. That was on a Monday. At that moment, it was well known<br />
that Krushchev was not going to meet Eisenhower, unlcss, of course, Eisenhower went<br />
through the remarkable performance of apologising about the U2 incident and withdrewing<br />
all his claims about the PB47 incident and that the President himself had said<br />
that he was not going to meet Krushchev on those terms. Therefore, the position was<br />
that the current Prcsident of the United States and the current if that is the<br />
right word head of the Soviet Union were not willing to meet personally without<br />
conditions which mutually were completely unacceptable. On top of all that and lot<br />
us be sensible about this matter at the very time at which we were having this<br />
debate, a new President of the United States was about to be elected, and what he<br />
would do or say, who would know?<br />
I want to pause here, Sir, to make n few observations, because I have been tcl.'<br />
by my friends nobody is so frank as a friend that some caonLints have been<br />
voiced in Australia. I have tried to understand them because I am really a tclcrablbroad-<br />
minded fellow. I understand that the first complaint is that I was being used<br />
by the United States and the United Kingdom which, happen to be the two greatest<br />
powers in the free world and our most powerful and devoted friends. I hope I hrve<br />
answered that complaint. For better or for worse, the proposal for an amendment was<br />
mine, no theirs. I thought, in my new-found innocence, that Austrlia was entitled to<br />
a mind of its own. Indeed, I have been told br some of my fliends opposite in the<br />
past that their great complaint is that we do not have a mind of our own. As I h-vo<br />
said, I thoughtthat we were entitled to a mind of our own. Believing that a certain<br />
course was right, I advocated it. I need not add any words to that.<br />
In the second place, I gather from the critics that, in the interests of Austra! ia,<br />
I should have preferred pleasing the five nations which I have named by supporting<br />
something with which I strongly disagreed and with which I utterly disagree at this : o<br />
ment to acting in c-ncert ' ith our most powerful and most ancmbiguous friends. </p>
<p>If that is the price of admiralty, then I resign from admiralty. I have<br />
learnt, perhaps, very little in my life but I have learnt to know who are<br />
our friends. Contrary to my expectation, it was ruled that the five power<br />
resolution and my amendment should be discussed separately from the general<br />
debate on Wednesd~ ay morning, 5th October. My major speech which appears to<br />
have missed firedhere, for some reason or other, had been listed for the<br />
afternoon. Therefore, unlike anybody else at the United Nations, I had to<br />
make two separate speeches, instead of one. Therefore, on Wednesday morning,<br />
knowing that on Wednesday afternoon, I had to make my most considerable speech,<br />
I moved my amendment. This morning at question time, when I was treated so kin* dly, my<br />
distinguished friend, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Whitlam) said<br />
to me, " I would like to know what you said on your amendment."~ I want to say<br />
at once that I have arranged that the full text of what I said shall be made<br />
available to members because, unhappily, it does not appear to have been rather<br />
widely reported. I shall permit myself the luxury of quoting a few of the<br />
things that I said that morning to the cold and unresponsive audience of the<br />
United Nations General Assembly. I think I shculd do so. A motion had been<br />
put down in the name of five powers and I was moving an amendment. ' Among<br />
other things, I said<br />
Let me say at once thc). t nobody can more warmly appreciate the high<br />
motives of the 3ponsors of the resolution than I do. They feel, no doubt,<br />
that it would be a bad thing if all the heads of state and heads of government<br />
departed from this assembly without leaving behind some visible<br />
evidence in the shape of a decision. They believe, no aoubt, that the people<br />
of the world would be disappointed and, perhaps, disillusioned if we all<br />
departed and nothing at all emerged. They, therefore, introduced this<br />
resolution and part of its purpose, as it has been explained to me, was to<br />
try to take advantage of the presence in north America, at the same time,<br />
of President Eisenhower and Mr. Khrushchev. But if I believe, as I do, that<br />
the effect of the resolution, if carriedwould be undesirable, then I am<br />
bound to say so.<br />
I hope that honourable members will realise that that was an authentic<br />
Australian voice upon this matter. I went on to talk about the conference in<br />
Paris, the conference which did. not occur, the conference which broke down<br />
because of Khrushchev's attitude. I said<br />
Many of us have thought that the discussions about nuclear tests<br />
could have been brought within reach of finality.<br />
I still believe that<br />
After all, the great nuclear powers were not so widely separated<br />
on this issue thaLt some effective lead could not have been given. But the<br />
Paris conference failed even to begin, because the leader of the Soviet Union<br />
would not participate. I have my own view about his stated reasons, but at<br />
this moment I do not desire to debate them.<br />
This was said in the morning<br />
The material and relevant fact was that the leaders of the United<br />
States, the United Kingdom and. France, promptly made a statement in which<br />
they said:<br />
I trust that this will be remembered for years but not, I hope with fears.<br />
" They regret that these discussions, so important for world peace,<br />
could not take plice. For their part, they remain unshaken in their conviction<br />
that all outstanding international questions should be settled not by the use<br />
or threat of force, but by peaceful means through negotiation. They themselves<br />
remain ready to take part in such negotiations at any suitable time in the<br />
future."<br />
My speech continued This, it will be agreed, was a fair enr'ugh proposition, goodtempered<br />
ana tenacious in the cause of peace. Should it be rejected now?<br />
If we have now reached a point in our discussions when we feel that talks of<br />
this kind should proceed, why should we not say so? </p>
<p>6.<br />
Why should we, by carrying the five-nation resolution, dismiss the<br />
United Kingdom and France from the first act? I went on to say this<br />
it is worth remembering Mr. Nehru himself has frankly stated that<br />
there are serious limits to the usefulness of bilateral talks; but<br />
what I would wish to know is whether any valid reason can be<br />
advanced for supposing that in some way the President of the United<br />
States was the stumbling block, and that therefore in any renewed<br />
discussions he should be the one leader of what we call the western<br />
world to be brought under persuasion or pressure.<br />
My own view is that we should incourage the resuoption of these<br />
summit talks. No doubt, a meeting at the summit cannot be arranged<br />
quickly or without preparation. We shall have to feel our way forward,<br />
and a way may be found. But it will not be found in the next few days.<br />
I doubt whether it can be found by trying to rush at it. The Australian<br />
amendment reflects what I believe is the view of the majority here; that<br />
we should try to rocalBure the hope that was offered to us in the early<br />
part of this year when we were moving towards a summit meeting. I<br />
concluded this excerpt by saying<br />
There may indeed by other amendments. I should like to say for<br />
myself that I am much less concerned about the details of<br />
draftsmanship than I am to avoid the perpetuation of the motion<br />
that the world conflict is between the United States and the<br />
Soviet Union.<br />
Before the morning session ended, in the course of which I regret to say<br />
that my distinguished friend, Mr. Nehru, made a somewhat remarkable<br />
commentary upon my amendment and my speech, the President indicated that<br />
two further amendments were being circulated and that the matter would be<br />
concluded at the night's session. This was on Wednesday. I will bypass,<br />
for the moment, the afternoon session. At the night session Cambodia,<br />
which after all is an Asian country, indicated that it would have<br />
supported my amendment as a separate resolution. This was a merely<br />
technical objection to its form. For some reason or other, and I still<br />
do not understand it, because in these United Nations affairs I am a new boy,<br />
the foreshadowed further amendments that had been referred to by the<br />
President in the morningierenot submitted. So, the first thing which<br />
happened after Cambodia hLi said this, vias th. t we vt-, on the AuBtrali-n<br />
amendment. Of course this has given immense pleasure to a few people.<br />
I do not kn.. w why they should be so pleasci that an . ustralian amondm. nz<br />
should be defeated. Still, one lives and learns. So they voted on my<br />
amendment. It was supporte, on the vote, by France, by the United Kingdom,<br />
by the United States of . imurica, by Candada and by ourselves not a bad<br />
voting group, I think. There w.: re 45 pc; ple who voted and 43 who<br />
abstained. Very interestingly, amcng the people who abstained and who<br />
said neither " yes" nor " no" were the Soviet Union, the entire Soviet bloc,<br />
Japan, Laos, the Philippines, Thailand .' nd Cambodia, for the reason I<br />
have referred to. It vcs then proposed that separate votes should be<br />
taken this is a highly technical but fascinating problem for us who<br />
are parliamentarians on the inclusion in the 5-power resolution of the<br />
words " the President of" " The Chairman of the Council of inisters of".<br />
This, of course, is something which we in our innocence in this<br />
Parliament know nothing about. .' nyhow,, it was proosoe that separate<br />
votes should be taken, and my distinguishoe friend, the Prime Minister<br />
of India, Mr. Nehru, objected, I thought, vwith groat force, that if t'hose<br />
words were omitted the 5-power resolution would be meaningless because, ., f<br />
course, diplomatic relations had not been cut off between the United States<br />
of Amorica and the Soviet Union. They had never beun interrupted. I<br />
might say I thought he had a great deal of force in that but, as I Cdi<br />
not likethe 5-power resolution, I remained relatively unmoved, except<br />
intellcctually, by this argument. ' hat happened? Separ-te votes wcr: -u;<br />
to the vote of the Assembly. I want to nmntion this to honorable members<br />
because some people rather foolishly have trica to make it a:' pear that I,<br />
representing you in t. is Parliament, had done someithing foolish an: d ad<br />
been loft out on a limb. But when the separate votes worc rut to the vote<br />
these in favour of separate votes in other words those who must be </p>
<p>regarded as being not in favour of the 5-power resolution as a whole were 37,<br />
and against them were 36, with 22 abstentions. It is lovely, you know.<br />
Some of you have been there but I had not been there before. Somebody<br />
says " abstention" and somebody, being brought up in the French language,<br />
says " abstentia", but it amounts to the same thing. There were, 37 in<br />
favour of separate votes, 36 against and 22 absteitions. Those in favour<br />
of separate votes and I mention this because some silly fellow who has<br />
tried to pretend that I am bcooming bad friends with the Asian countries<br />
has suggested the contrary included Pakistan, China, Japan, the<br />
Philippines and Thailand. And if I may permit myself to say so, I do not<br />
mind finding myself standing, as to three of these countries, alongside<br />
our colleagues in the South-East Asian Treaty. When the separate votes<br />
were taken, because it had been decided that there ought to be separate<br />
votes, those in favour of retaining what I will call the " separate phrases",<br />
the President of the United States of America, the Chairman of the Council<br />
of Ministers of the Soviet Union, were 41 in favour, with 37 against and<br />
17 abstentions. The President ruled that there should be a two-thirds<br />
majority. There was not a two-thirds majority and the President's ruling<br />
was upheld. All this was going on in the one day when oddities of all<br />
kinds, Heaven help met were being published in my own country.-Those<br />
who voted against the retention of these personal phrases, in other wor'. s<br />
those who voted against the idea that we should betelling President<br />
Eisenhower and Chairman Khrushchev to get together, included all of the<br />
South-East Asian countries. That, I think, is something worth noting.<br />
After all this argy-bargy I think that is the expression Mr. Nehru, the<br />
very distinguished leader of India, stood up and said that, having rig8<br />
to the voting, the five-power resolution would be withdrawn. So at<br />
one o'clock in the morning of the same day the five-power resolution had<br />
gone. You may ask what happened to my amendment submitted on behalf of<br />
Australia. Many people have been eager beavers to say that my amendment<br />
was just ridiculous and that I had made a fool of my country. When<br />
I make a fool . of this country I hope that you will expel me. The fact<br />
was that by one o'clock in the morning the resolution to which my<br />
amendment had been unsuccessful alternative had been withdrawn. Withdrawn<br />
because other amendments had been moved or other procedures had been adopted<br />
which persuaded its sponsors to withdraw it.<br />
I want to stress to honorable members that this is not a party<br />
political matter. iall of us are Australians and we want to feel that our<br />
country counts. The fact is that by the end of that day two remarkable things<br />
had occurred. First, the proposal sponsored primarily by Yugoslavia, the<br />
United Arab Republic, Indonesia and others had gone. It had been withdrawn.<br />
In the meantime, in the course of the voting four atomic powers, the only four<br />
atomic powers, had been called to the ballot. You may think that I am rather<br />
foolish, but at any rate I called them to the ballot. Four of them. Great<br />
Britain, France, and the United States had voted unhesitatingly for a convening<br />
of the Summit conference as contained in my amendment, and the Soviet Union<br />
had not voted but had abstained from voting. Four days later, under<br />
circumstances which vexed the honorable members for East Sydney ( Mr. Ward) I<br />
had a talk with the head of the Soviet Union Mr. Khrushchev, in which he made<br />
it abundantly clear that he wanted a Summit conference. That was who he had<br />
not voted against my amendment. He wanted a summit conference and by one<br />
6' clock after midnight that day I went back feeling in my simple vanity<br />
that at any rate we had now got to a state of affairs in which there would be a<br />
after the American presidential election a Summit conference. It is very<br />
difficult even for such an old hand as myself to understand why this achievement,<br />
because it was something of an achievement, should be regarded as in some way<br />
discreditable to our country, to which most of us were born.<br />
To sum up, my amendment was lost, but the resolution was withdrawn.<br />
Three atomic powers had voted for a Summit meeting and the Soviet Union had<br />
abstained. Not one of the four atoiic powers was opposed to a Summit meeting.<br />
I pass on from that. I made a speech thatafternoon. In my simplicity<br />
I thought that that was the major speech, and my distinguished colleage the<br />
Treasurer ( Mr. Harold Holt) whe was present probably God bibss him thought<br />
likewise, because the speech in the morning was on this technical problem. As<br />
I have said, I made a speech in the afternoon. It lasted for about 40 minutes.<br />
It is very interesting for an Australian to go abroad and make a speech on the<br />
great itfdrations platform. This was the only occasion in my life when the<br />
American press swept a speech of mine into its columns. But that did not </p>
<p>0 8.<br />
in the afternoon I had made up my mind that if Mr. Khrushchev were to come<br />
and bully people taunt people, and beat things on the table, including<br />
his shoes it was really high time that somebody speaking for 10,000,000<br />
people that is all should make it quite clear to him that we are not<br />
frightened. Therefore I let myself go, as you might say. But of course,<br />
what happened in the United Nations Assembly, apart from all the beating on<br />
the table and the wearing out of boot leather, which was all very funny from.<br />
our point of view? I think thatMr. Khrushchev wanted to persuade or terrify<br />
new nations into coming into his camp. We know nothing about that. We are<br />
not easily persuaded and we certainly are rot easily terrified into somebody<br />
else's camp. But that seemed to be his id3a. He had his heelers with him.<br />
There were with him about half a dozen representatives from his satellite<br />
nations who would not dare to applaud without first looking round to see<br />
whether he gave the high sign. Wonderful: I wish that I could organize<br />
that sort of thing some day' Mr. Khrushchov talked about colonialism. He<br />
tried to read into the mind of some of the delegates a bitterness about their<br />
old status. He was talking for the most part to people who represented<br />
countries in Africa, which, by wise provenance on the part of the United<br />
Kingdom, had ceased to be colonies and had become independent nations.<br />
I thought that was a monstrosity. Anyhow, he did it. Therefore, I thqught<br />
on your behalf if you do not agree with what I did you will say so/ ought<br />
to use a few words mildly about this situation. Lot me quote one or two of the<br />
words that I used, because apparently there has been some difficulty in<br />
reporting them. I said<br />
I bog of all these distinguished representatives I was referring<br />
to the representatives of the new countries, primarily in Africa<br />
to put bitterness out of their minds. So far as they are concerned, the<br />
past has gone. The dead past should bury its dead. It is the present<br />
and future that matter. Most of them know that political independence can<br />
be won more swiftly than economic independence.<br />
I pause here to repeat the last sentence because some rather silly fellow has<br />
said that I was not on the same wave-length as the now countries. I leave<br />
it to the House to decide. I said<br />
Mostof them know that political independence can be won more swiftly<br />
than economic independence. And yet both are essential to true<br />
nationhood. Under those circumstances, nations which are older in<br />
self-governmont should not be looking at new nations as people whose<br />
support should be canv. issod, but as peo-ple who noed objective assistance<br />
with no strings if the material prosprity of their people is to be<br />
inprovod. It is one, of the significant things in contemporary history that<br />
the advanced industrial nations arc, because of their scientific and tcchnelo-ical<br />
advantages, improving their standards at a phenomenal rate; while loss<br />
advanced countries, lacking the sane techniques on the same scale, are advanciat<br />
a slower rate. This is not one of. the facts of lifo which one may observe an.;<br />
having observed, forget. Its significance is that the gap between the adv:. nc<br />
and the relatively unadvancod tends, unless we do som: thing about it, to .; row<br />
wider every year. It is not a state of aff; irs which civilized and hu. ran;<br />
thinking can indefinitely tolerate.<br />
I said this on Australia's behalf, and I am sure that no<br />
Honorable nmmber will disagree with it.<br />
If in this Assembly and in the nations here repros'nted we will constant-t<br />
remember that our trust is for humanity and that, indeed the United N-. ti<br />
itself has no other reason for existence, we will more and more concertr. t_<br />
our efforts on providing economic and technical help for new nations<br />
very limit of our capacity; not because we want, to put it crudely, t. Ouy<br />
then into our own ideas things, not only because we really and pas3: ion...-<br />
ely believe in independence and frcddo);, but also becaus e believe that<br />
our fellow human beings everywhere oa., entitl,;! to docont conditions of<br />
life, and have enjugh sense to know th-t indepondence and freedom </p>
<p>and mere words unless the ordinary people of free countries have a chance<br />
of a better life tomorrow.<br />
This point of view seemed to me to underlie the temperate and<br />
persuasive speech of Mr. Macmillan and other speeches made by democratic leaders.<br />
But there are others who have so far misunderstood the spirit of<br />
the United Nations as to resort to open or veiled threats, blatant and in scme<br />
instances lying propaganda, a clearly expressed desire to divide and conquer.<br />
They should learn that " threatened men live long", and that free nations,<br />
however small, are not susceptible to bullying.<br />
I am still quoting myself, which is an ill business. I continued<br />
" I will permit myself the luxury of developing this theme,<br />
though quite briefly, in the particular and in the general."<br />
I hope non mcibcrr will not think me boring but this was a phase of my speech<br />
which, I believe, had an irimense impact on the Assembly. I said<br />
" In his opening speech, Mr. Khrushchev made his usual great play<br />
about " colonialism". Ax Mr. Macrillan reminded us, the answer to much of<br />
his story is to be found in the presence of this Assembly of many new<br />
nations, once colonies and now independent.<br />
Mr. Khrushchev said among other things: " Nations who oppress<br />
other nations cannot themselves be free. Every free nation should help the<br />
peoples still oppressed to win freedom and independence". This was, in one<br />
sense, a most encouraging observation. It made me wonder whether we were<br />
perhaps about to see a beginning of an era in which the nations of Europe,<br />
which were once independent, and now are under Soviet Communist control, are<br />
going to receive the blessings of freedom and independence. What a glorious<br />
vista of freedom would be opened up by such a policy! How much it would do<br />
to relieve the causes of tension, and promote peace!<br />
I venture to say that it is an act of complete hypocrisy for a<br />
Communist leader to denounce colonialism as if it were an evil charactcristic<br />
of the Western Powers, when the facts are that the greatest colonial power<br />
now existing is the Soviet Union itself."<br />
This brings ec now to the point. I said<br />
" Further, in the course of this Assembly, Mr. Krushchev was good<br />
enough to r. ikc some references to my own country and its position in rclation<br />
to the territories of Papua and New Guinea. He calls upon Australia to give<br />
imediate full independence and self-govcrnment to New Guinea and Papua. As<br />
a piece cf rhetoric this no doubt has it points. But it exhibits a distur-bir<br />
want of knowlcdge of these Territories and of the present stage of their<br />
development. Nobcdy who knows anything about these Territories and their<br />
indiginous peoppe could doubt for a moment that for us in Australia to<br />
abandon our responsibilities could be an almost crirminal act."<br />
I am quoting this part of my speech because, subject to correction, I feel<br />
that these vords impress themselves upon our friend. I said<br />
" Here is a country which not so long ago was to a real extent<br />
in a state of savagery. It passed through the n. cst gruesome experiences<br />
during the last war,, It came out of it without organized administration,<br />
and, in a sense, without hope.<br />
It is not a nation in the accepted tense. Its people have no rcl<br />
structure of association expect through our acmninistration. Its groups arc<br />
isolated among mountains, forests, rivers and swaaps. It is estimates thr. t<br />
there are cmre than 200 different languages."<br />
Probably my distinguished colleague, the iinistcr for Territories ( Mr. Hasluck)<br />
would tell me that I underestimated the number. I continued<br />
" The -work to be done to create and foster a sense and organism of<br />
community is therefore enormous.<br />
But, v&amp; th a high sense of responsibility, Australia has attacked<br />
its human task in this almost unique area.<br />
Since the war some form of civiliscd order has been establishc'd<br />
over many thousands of square miles which were previously unexplored." </p>
<p>S.-LU. We have built up an ex ensive administration service...<br />
Really, I do not need to trouble honourable members about this. I told them<br />
the simple, dramatic and moving story of what has been done in Papua and<br />
New Guinea, and I ended by saying<br />
I could go no like this almost indefinitely.<br />
The achievement has not been without cost, We have put many more<br />
millions into Papua and New Guinea than have cvcr come out.<br />
We have established many local government councils, democratically<br />
elected on an adult franchise, and we have set up a Legislative Council on<br />
which there is a gowing number of indigenous members.<br />
Mr. Khrushchev includes us in his diatribe against " foreign<br />
administrators who despise and loot the local population". I have<br />
shown how exactly opposite to the truth this is in our case. His further<br />
extravaganza about " the overseer's lash" and the " executor's axe" must<br />
relate to areas with which he is more familiar than he is with New Guinea<br />
and Papua. We do not need to be lectured on such matters by a man who has<br />
no record whatever of having brought colonial people into freedon and<br />
self-government. We indeed are proud to be in the British tradition<br />
Sof the 20th century a tradition which has by sensible degrees<br />
and enlightened administration brought the blessings of self-government<br />
anda seat in the councils of the world to many former colonies.<br />
I also spoke about neutralism, and I inflict this on honourable members<br />
Neutralism is, of course one of those rather rotund words which<br />
does not readily admit of definition, If, when we say that a nation is<br />
neutral, we mean that it will not under any circumstances take arms in<br />
any conflict which does not concern the protection of its own immediate<br />
boundaries, it seems to be a notion hard to r econcile with the Charter<br />
of the United Nations which contemplates under certain circumstances the<br />
use of combined force in terms of the Charter itself.<br />
Mr. Nehru, the distinguished leader of India, has not; think used the<br />
word " neutral" in this sense. He and his government maintain largedefences<br />
ia their own ccuntny, and are active supporters of the Charter. What<br />
he has consistently made clear is that he stands for non-alignment, in<br />
the sense that he will not engage in any special military or quasimilitary<br />
alliance.<br />
My own country does not subscribe to this view, since we are party,<br />
for example, to the South-East Asian Treaty with the military<br />
associations which are either expressed or implied in it. But we do not<br />
quarrel with each other about these matters. I would think it impossible<br />
to believe that some of the greatest leaders of so-called " neutral"<br />
countries would regard themselves as being neutral in the great conflict<br />
of ideas.<br />
Sir, having said all that at, I am afraid, too great length, I now turn, quite<br />
briefly I hope, to some genural observations about this rather historic<br />
General Assembly meeting. First of all, a determined attack was made by the<br />
Communist powers upon new nations to encourage what I have already dscribed as<br />
" retrospective bitterness" I do not think that on this matter the tablethumping<br />
succeeded.<br />
In the second place, attempts were made todbfeat or to undermine the<br />
Secretary-General. In particular, a very remarkable proposal was put forward<br />
that there should be three secretaries-general instead of one; and for some<br />
very odd reason, one ought to be from what we would call the Commnist group<br />
but what Mr. Khrushchev-I apologize to my friends opposite calls the socialist<br />
group, a second from the neutralist group and a third from the capitalist<br />
group. of whioh, no doubt, I was one of the representatives. There ought to be<br />
three secretaries-general, and everybody would have a veto on everybody else,<br />
and therefore, of coursenothing would happen, and therefore the United Nations<br />
would come to an end. He did not get very much success with that remarkable<br />
proposal. </p>
<p>But there are some aspects of his general campaign about which<br />
I think I should report to this Parliament. First of all, I believe that<br />
what he has been saying and what he has been doing are designed to divide<br />
the United Nations into the disunited nations. After all, if there is one<br />
thing about the United Nations that matters, it is that it possesses<br />
a sort of universali ty As I said in my own speech, hewants to produce a<br />
result like anci" cn our late respected friend, Julius Caesar reported<br />
that all Gaulwas divided . nto three parts. This manwants to divide the<br />
United Nati. ns into three parts and therefore into the Disunited Nations.<br />
One of the groups in this disunited body that he ants to produce is<br />
what he keeps on describing as the neutralist groupo What is a neutralist<br />
group. Sir, one of the things that I beg all honourable members on both<br />
sides of the House to avoid is this f allacy of easy classification. So and<br />
so is an African, therefore he must think like all other Africans' If one<br />
African is neutralist, therefore he must be neutralist9 This is an insult to<br />
people. Does anybody suppose that because people were born west of the<br />
Soviet boundary in Europe, whether t hey are Germans, Frenchmen, Englishmen<br />
or Italians, they a re t he same kind of men with the same kind of ideas?<br />
This, of course, is utter nonsense. You may go overt he whole zone of<br />
Africa andt ell me that so-and-so, so-and-so, and so-and-so must think the<br />
same way because they are all Africans and they are all African leaders.<br />
Sir, I tell you that the greatest speech made at this General Assembly was<br />
made by the Prime Minister of Nigeria. He is a most remarkable man, and<br />
his speech made an unforgettable impact on the minds of all of us. It would<br />
insult this great man, the head of the Government of the greatest single<br />
nation in the whole African continent, a nation of 40,000,000 people, to be<br />
told that his country must be classified, along with other countries, in a<br />
group or bloc. No one could have been more explicit than he was about the<br />
need forevery nation to live its own life, to face its own future, to accept<br />
its own responsibilities. The people who want to denigrate the whole of<br />
modern independence and to treat new nations as if they were merely groups<br />
to be bought like bunches of bananas, make a very great blunder. That<br />
was perhaps the greatest blunder that Khrushchev made.<br />
Let us consider the ways in which Mr. Khrushchev failed.<br />
He failed to undermine the Secretary General, He filed to destroy the<br />
work that has been done with regard to the Congo. Ho failed on<br />
occasionafter occasion, and I will not take up the time of the<br />
House in recounting them all, because I have already taken up far too<br />
much of its time, He had some success, no doubto He may have<br />
frightened somebody and he may have weakened a little the position of<br />
the Secretary General; I do not know. You and I in this House<br />
are fortunate to have grown up in such an atmosphere that we can<br />
laugh at nonsense and not be frightencd by it, so how am I to know<br />
to what extent Mr, Khrushchev succeeded inf rightening people?<br />
He tried to disunite the United Nations, He tried to introduce some<br />
strange dogma about neutralist groups. He ha d some points, I suppose.<br />
He said that when the U. N. was c stablished it had 50-member nations,<br />
that now it has nearly 100, and that therefore there ought to be some<br />
reconstruction of thestructure of the organisation. I do not object<br />
to that suggestion, so long as it is underst-cd that one of the<br />
cangers that have grown up in the modern wcrld is t hat the General<br />
Assembly, which has relatively little power, has become tremendously<br />
important because the heads of Government attend it whereas t he chief<br />
executive body and I am not using the word executive" in a<br />
technical sense the Security Council, has been put rather on one<br />
side. The Security Council, Sir, must continue to include in its membership<br />
people who represent the great powers, which themselves are the<br />
backbone of the U. N. and which themselves carry the major responsibility<br />
for peace. But, subject to that proviso, I do not object to the<br />
suggestion that a reconstruction of the UN, should be considered. </p>
<p>V 12.<br />
I want to say one or two things more. I had the very valuable<br />
opportunity of seeing, on your behalf, a number of world leaders.<br />
I would not wish any member of this Parliament, on tiehter side, to<br />
believe that I was being exclusive, talking to this side and not to<br />
that side. In the course of rather less than three weeks I had the<br />
closest discussions with President Eisenhower, with the American<br />
Secretary of State, Mr. Herter) with Mr. Macmillan and Lord Home and<br />
with Mr. Nehru. I had a long interview with Mr. Khrushchev. I<br />
sought the interview, and I tell you quite frankly that the main<br />
reason why I sought it was that I thought that if I cmoback here<br />
and my friends, or friendly opponents, who sit opposite asked me<br />
whether I saw Khrushchev and I replied that I had not, they might<br />
think it rather odd. So I sought an interview with Mr. Khrushchev.<br />
I had already expressed myself, as hon. members-wi-l have gathered from<br />
what I have already said, with a certain degree of clarity.<br />
Neveitheless, I had 70 minutes with Mr. Khrushchev, and I want to<br />
say to the Hoixse that I came away from the interview quite<br />
satisfied that he would like a summit conference. Being more<br />
interested, as I am, in substance than in form, and as what I was<br />
trying for from the day I arrived at the U. N. was the substance of<br />
a summit conference, I am very pleased to say that three of the<br />
atomic powers voted for a summit conference on my amendment, and<br />
that the fourth, through Mr. Khrushchev, has indicated to me in the<br />
clearest possible terms that a summit conference is considered a<br />
good idea. I saw, of course, the Prime Minister of Ethiopia who is an<br />
old friend of mine. I had a talk with President Tito. I spoke to<br />
Mr. Luns, the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands. Dr. Subandrio,<br />
of Indonesia, was a guest of mine, and I had a long talk with him.<br />
Indeed, one would be surprised at the number of people who concern<br />
us in this world with whom, in the course of a fortnight or three<br />
weeks9 one can have useful talks.<br />
I have occupied the time of the House long enough. Having<br />
said that I believe that Mr. Khrushchev wants summit talks, and<br />
that I think something might come of them, I would like to conclude<br />
by saying that I have by no means been disposed to defend myself<br />
on the matters about which I have spoken. I believe in my heart<br />
and in my mind that I pursued the right course at New York, and<br />
that I spoke and acted in the best interests of my country.<br />
I move </p>
