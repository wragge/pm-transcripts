EMBARGOED UNTIL 10.00 P. M. CHECK( AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FINANCIAL REVIEW DINNER MELBOURNE 22 AUGUST 1984<br />
The Labor Government was elected seventeen months ago to<br />
arrest the decline in the Australian economy, symbolised by<br />
the huge loss of employment sind the explosion in<br />
unemployment in the period before we took office, and by<br />
entrenched high inflation.<br />
The Labor Government was elected to rever'se the trend<br />
towards greater inequality in Australian society after seven<br />
years of neglect of equity under conservative policies.<br />
And the Labor Government was elected to bring Australians<br />
together : to end the confrontation and division that had<br />
marred Australian economic life, perhaps most notably in<br />
industrial relations and relationc between the Commonwealth<br />
and the States.<br />
The Government has always seen these three great<br />
responsibilities as being closely inter-. related. Sustained<br />
non-inflationary growth is not possible without a greater<br />
sense of common purpose than Australia ! knew through the<br />
1970' s and early 1980' s prior-to our accession to<br />
Government. And it is not possible to build that greater<br />
sense of national purpose around the restoration of growth<br />
unless thtire is widespread agreemenL that: the benefits of<br />
growth, and the inevitable costs, are being shared<br />
equitably. So from the beginning of our Government, wa saw our<br />
commitments to the establishment of sustained<br />
non-inflationary growth, to bringing Australians-togethar<br />
and to the building of a more equitable Australia, as parts<br />
of the same great program.<br />
And from the beginning it has been an integrated program.<br />
We have had a clear plan, we have been steadily and<br />
consistently implementing it, and it is producing the<br />
results that we promised. </p>
<p>The despair of the Australian people in the Final years of<br />
conservative rule was greatly exacerbated by the lack of any<br />
clear strategy for economic rlcovery.<br />
All Australians now have hope that there is a way out of our<br />
national failures, through ouF program. This in itself has<br />
been one reason why the economy has responded more strongly<br />
even, for example, than any group at the Summit last April<br />
had expected.<br />
Each year's Budget provides an occasion to assess progress<br />
on each of our great responsibilities, and on our great<br />
program. It also provides an occasion to unveil new<br />
policies, and to assess our prospects for the period ahead.<br />
As I explained to last year's Australian financial Review<br />
Dinner at Budget time on that occasion in Sydney we do<br />
not believe that all of the condiTions for sustained<br />
non-inflationary growth, for a more equitable Australia, or<br />
for e united Australia, can be built in a single Budget, or<br />
a single year.<br />
Each year's Budget represents only one milestone on a long<br />
journey. It is neither desirable nor possible suddenly in a single<br />
Budget to remove all the impediments to progress, and to<br />
right all the wrongs, in the Australian economy and society.<br />
We are committed to gradual progress, without plecing<br />
excessively large and sudden burdens of adjustment on any<br />
particular groups of Australians.<br />
But we are committed to certain and steady progress.<br />
Certain and steady progress that in seventeen months has<br />
already lifted the pessimism and despair that weighed<br />
Australia down before we took office.<br />
Certain and steady progress that will deliver more growth,<br />
more jobs and less inflation in the year ahead than<br />
Australia has known for nany years.<br />
And certain and steady reform that each year makes our<br />
society fairer, and each year strengthens our capacity to<br />
grow strongly for the long period that is necessary to<br />
banish unemployment.<br />
Last year I asserted that the Government had found the right<br />
balance between the provision of fiscal stimulus to promote<br />
recovery, and the curtailment of the prospective deficit<br />
that we had inherited so as to avoid destabilising pressures<br />
in financial markets.<br />
S: . I I 7, </p>
<p>The results speak for themselves interest rates down a<br />
percentage point for most home loans and more for other<br />
activities; non-farm growth year-on-year over 4 per cent,<br />
more than twice the budget forecas, of 2 per cent; 232,000<br />
new jobs, more in a single year than ever before in<br />
Australian history, and in stark cuntrast to the quarter<br />
million increase in unemployment and 187,000 loss of jobs in<br />
the last year of conservative rule; and inflation cut almost<br />
by half to the lowest rates for a decade.<br />
It was a matter of particular pride to me that in our first<br />
year. we were able to achieve substantial reductions in the<br />
huge prospective deficit which we inherited in the event,<br />
much larger reductions than estimated in the Budget, to<br />
under $ 8 billion while putting into place substantial<br />
reforms in job creation, housing, social " security and<br />
welfare, including Medicare. These and some changes in<br />
taxation arrangements without substantial general tax<br />
increases represented a significant step towards a fairer<br />
and more efficient Australian fiscal system.<br />
There was good progress, too, in building a more united<br />
Australia, as reflected in the proportion of days lost in<br />
industrial disputes over the past year having been the<br />
lowest since monthly industrial disputes figures were first<br />
published in 1970, and in the agreement and co-operation<br />
between the Commonwealth and the States on a fiscal program<br />
for economic r3covery.<br />
Last night's Budget represents another milestone on the path<br />
to sustained non-inflationary growth within a fairer and<br />
more united Australia.<br />
Whereas our first Budget had as its primary aim the turning<br />
of the economy from decline to expansion, this year we must<br />
consolidate a second year of strong growth in output and<br />
employment with declining inflation.<br />
Like last year's, this Budget takes further steps to reform<br />
the fiscal system in a way which assists Australians in<br />
need. And like last year and as with all our future Budgets, and<br />
as with the many economic policy decisions which must be<br />
taken between Budgets, we have aimed to implement reforms in<br />
ways which improve the prospects for long-term economic<br />
growth. To consolidate a second year of economic recovery, the<br />
central plank of this Budget has been to support the Accord,<br />
thereby enabling the spectacular gains in reducing<br />
inflation, and in restoring growth and expanding employment<br />
through improving business profitability, to be extended. </p>
<p>There are now few who doubt that the Accord, and in<br />
particular the commitment to centralised wage fixation, has<br />
played a crucial role in the progress which has been made in<br />
reducing inflation and improving business profitability over<br />
the past year.<br />
Real unit labour costs have fallen dramatically and the<br />
profit share is now higher than at any time for a decade.<br />
This has come about because real labour costs have remained<br />
flat while average labour productivity has risen strongly.<br />
The Accord will enable still further improvements since<br />
there will be a sustained pause in wages growth between<br />
April 1984 and April 1985.<br />
That pause could not be achieved without the commitment to<br />
wage indexation, without the recognition -by virtually the<br />
entire trade union movement that sectional claims must be<br />
suppressed and without the acknowledgement and acceptance of<br />
the concept of the " social wage".<br />
The Budget contains tax cuts amounting to $ 1.3 billion in<br />
1984-85 and $ 2.1 billion in a full year.<br />
The tax cuts which have been made in the Budget will, we<br />
believe, strongly reinforce the commitment of the trade<br />
union movement to the Accord.<br />
For the majority of workers, the tax cut will increase take<br />
home pay by roughly the same amount as an $ 11 per week pay<br />
increase. There has been a great deal of ignorant comment about the<br />
strong forecast growth in revenues this financial year.<br />
Gross PAYE collections, which are the tax people are paying<br />
fortnight after fortnight, will increase by 10.7 per cent.<br />
This happens to be exactly the sum you get by compounding<br />
the average weekly earnings increase this year ( seven and a<br />
quarter per cent) by the employment increase ( three and a<br />
quarter per cent).<br />
On average, the rate of tax paid out of income has not<br />
increased at all.<br />
If there had been no tax cut, the increase in gross PAYE<br />
would have been 15.8 per cent.<br />
The tax cut was large enough to keep the growth in tax for<br />
the year as a whole down to the growth in incomes, even<br />
though the tax cut is only to apply from November.<br />
After November, the share of tax in income on average will<br />
be significantly lower than last year.<br />
.* i7<br />
I </p>
<p>Of course, tax receipts would grow more slowly this year if<br />
there was less employment growth.<br />
If employment were expected to fall by 3 per cent in<br />
1984-85, as it did over the course uf Liberal National<br />
Party's last year in office, ihstead of rising by 34 per<br />
cent as it. will, then, with our tax cut, PAYE receipts would<br />
grow only by slightly more than 4 per cent, instead of 10.7<br />
per cent.<br />
Obviously that would be a disastrous outcome for Australia.<br />
Some of you may wonder why, if gross PAYE rises only by 10.7<br />
per cent, total income tax receipts rise by 22.6 per cent?<br />
The main reason why total income tax collections are<br />
increasing so rapidly is that the economy is performing so<br />
well. There is a huge increase $ 2 billion or 45 per cent in<br />
provisional tax collections. This is because the incomes of<br />
large numbers of small business people including farmers<br />
and many others have grown extraordinarily rapidly. For<br />
these taxpayers, as for employees, tax rates from November<br />
decline by more than the proportion that would be required<br />
to implement tax indexation up to relatively high incomes.<br />
The huge growth in incomes and income taxes reflects only<br />
increased prosperity, including a substantial contribution<br />
from the success of our policy.<br />
A similar point can be made about the large increase in<br />
dompany income tax, by $ 1 billion, or 23 per cent.<br />
Reflecting its first full year of operation the Medicare<br />
levy also contributes $ 800 million to the estimated growth<br />
in income taxes. The levy, as you know, simply finances the<br />
provision of a service that was formerly paid for direc. tly<br />
by taxpayers.<br />
Reductions in income tax rebates contribute $ 400 million to<br />
the growth in income tax receipts. These largely reflect<br />
the replacement of Government taxation concessions by direct<br />
Government expenditures of a related kind, as announced in<br />
last year's May Statement the replacement of medical fund<br />
rebates by direct subsidies to Medicare; and the replacement<br />
of inequitable housing interest rebates by the First Home<br />
Owners' Scheme.<br />
The reality is that from November, there will be a<br />
substantial reduction in the proportion of income paid as<br />
tax, much more than would be required by a simple indexing<br />
of the tax scales. And the distribution of the cuts<br />
strongly favours low and middle income earners. </p>
<p>While the tax cuts are of greatest importance, a number of<br />
expenditure commitments also assist in maintaining support<br />
for the Accord throuqh improvements in the social wage<br />
particularly the increased commitn; mnts to Medicare, social<br />
security, education, occupational health and safety, job<br />
creation and training.<br />
The continued success of the Accord is the main reason why<br />
this is the only Government in recent history which has been<br />
able to enter the second year of a strong economic upturn<br />
without the spectre of destructive disputes over income<br />
shares clouding prospects for the future.<br />
Only this Government has been able to face the second year<br />
of a strong economic upturn with firm grounds for believing<br />
that recovery will not disappear quickly In a mire of<br />
inflation; and that growth in output and employment can be<br />
sustained. The gains that we make over the next year in reducing labour<br />
costs, containing inflation and improving our<br />
competitiveness should provide a substantial further boost<br />
to employment and enable us to make further inroads into the<br />
level of unemployment, which, despite our good progress,<br />
remains unacceptably high.<br />
Unemployment is the single greatest cause of poverty in this<br />
country. This is the most compelling reason why we place such great<br />
store in establishing lasting economic growth.<br />
. Through addressing the issue of unemployment by promoting<br />
growth of economic output and employment, we are making the<br />
most effective possible contribution to the alleviation of<br />
poverty. But in this Budget we are also doing a great deal<br />
directly to improve the position of the unemployed and other<br />
disadvantaged groups in the community.<br />
Before the Budget, there was much ill-informed speculation<br />
that the needs and claims of the disadvantaged might not be<br />
adequately addressed. This no doubt set the scene for some<br />
post-Budget criticisims that we were doing tuo little in the<br />
social security area.<br />
The reality is that the Budget contains substantial<br />
initiatives to improve levels of assistance for pensioners<br />
and social security beneficiaries over and above the normal<br />
indexation arrangements, and over and above the substantial<br />
steps taken in the May Statement and the Budget last year.<br />
This year's package of social security increases, in excess<br />
of normal indexation, will cost $ 430 million this year and<br />
$ 683 million in a full year. </p>
<p>Thus the standard rate of pensions and benefits will be<br />
increased by $ 2.50 a week above indexation, and the married<br />
rate by $ 2.10 for each partner.<br />
In addition, there are increased payments for child support<br />
and education allowances available to low income families,<br />
and additional rent assistance for needy pensioners. More<br />
generally, over the past two years the Commonwealth has very<br />
substantially increased its support for public housing and<br />
the alleviation of housing related poverty. In this Budget,<br />
payments under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement will<br />
total $ 623m compared to $ 406m in the last year of the<br />
previous government.<br />
It is fair, I think, to contrast the improvements in social<br />
welfare provision during our brief period in office with the<br />
neglect and decline in the seven years of our predecessors.<br />
There were no general increases in pensions along the lines<br />
of last night's measures in the seven long years of<br />
conservative rule even in May, 1976, when indexation<br />
adjustments were low on account of the effect of Medibank<br />
on the C. P. I. in late 1975.<br />
The contrast is made simply with two examples.<br />
The single unemployment benefit fell by 19 per cent in real<br />
terms between December 1975 and March 1983. With the<br />
measures announced last night, it -ill have increased by 13<br />
per cent between March 1983 and June 1985.<br />
Similarly, the total value of pension, family allowances and<br />
related benefits for a sole parent with two children in<br />
' rented accommodation Fell by 2 per cent in real terms<br />
between December 1975 and March 1983. It increased by 13<br />
per cent in real terms between March 1983 and December 1984.<br />
While we expect the recovery in activity and future growth<br />
of the economy to provide a substantial boost to emplo. yment,<br />
there remains a continuing need for labour market programs<br />
both to provide additional job opportunities and to ensure<br />
that Australian workers are equipped with the experience and<br />
skills to match the opportunities which emerge.<br />
The Community Employment Program, introduced last year, is<br />
providing job opportunities and hence valuable work<br />
experience for the most disadvantaged jobseekers. Funds<br />
provided for this Program will total $ 410 million in<br />
1984/ 85, an increase of 44 per cent.<br />
Total expenditure on labour market and related employment<br />
and training programs will be $ 1.1 billion this year, double<br />
the provision for 1982-83.<br />
, Z 4<br />
o r ' I 4 o </p>
<p>The main programs other than the Community Employment<br />
Program such as the Special Youth Employment Training<br />
Program, the Community Youth ^ upport Scheme and<br />
apprenticeship training programs are currntly under<br />
review by the Kirby Committee which was set up to assess how<br />
well they are meeting the Gove'rnment's objectives. That<br />
Committee has been asked to report by the end of this year.<br />
Our training programs are complemented by our initiatives in<br />
the field of education. We have recently announced an<br />
8-year funding program involving substantial increases in<br />
Commonwealth assistance for schools, and made provision for<br />
an additional 30,000 places at universities, colleges and<br />
TAFEs by 1987.<br />
We regard the recussitation of our education institutions as<br />
a sound and vital investment in our future, complementing<br />
our policies to restructure Australia's industrial base.<br />
Greater funding, and rising student participation in<br />
education is not enough. My Government is most concerned to<br />
improve the relevance of the education process to employment<br />
opportunities and the needs of industry. Accordingly, with<br />
those objectives in mind, we have initiated major reviews of<br />
the quality of education at all levels. We look to industry<br />
to make an appropriate contribution to these reviews.<br />
A skilled workforce, the more effirient use of our resources<br />
and improved competitiveness will enlarge the prospects for<br />
our achieving sustained economic growth in the medium and<br />
long-term.<br />
Commonwealth contributions to the plans which we have<br />
developed to strengthen the competitiveness of the steel and<br />
motor vehicle industries are reflected in this year's Budget<br />
appropriations. Another constructive step in the revitalisation of industry<br />
which is funded in this Budget is the establishment of an<br />
advisory service on computer assistance in manufacturing<br />
industry. In addition, the increased assistance which we are providing<br />
for industrial research and development will aid new<br />
products and industries. The substantially augmented trade<br />
promotion program ( up to $ 3.4 million or 36% in 1984/ 85)<br />
will assist Australian industries to make the most of the<br />
opportunities for developing and expanding exports,<br />
especially in Northeast and Southeast Asia, thus supporting<br />
our efforts to link the Australian economy productively to<br />
the high growth that characterises economic life in our<br />
Western Pacific region.<br />
S. .6. </p>
<p>We have been concerned to promote efficiency also in a<br />
number of initiatives which we have taken in the financial<br />
sector. We have lifted a number of anti-competitive<br />
restrictions on the operations of banks, and are cu. rently<br />
considering the terms on which new entrants should be<br />
permitted into the . domestic banking industry.<br />
We intend to increase competition within the financial<br />
sector and thus to stimulate improvements in the range of<br />
financial services available to businesses and to all<br />
Australians. Deregulation and any entry of new banking institutions<br />
could, however, pose a problem of interpretation for<br />
monetary policy in the next year or so.<br />
The Treasurer indicated last night that, consistent with the<br />
forecast movements of real economic activity, prices and<br />
velocity, the M3 growth projection this year is 8-10 per<br />
cent. We have an impressive record in monetary mangement.<br />
Last year monetary growth was contained within the<br />
projection range which, in line with our announced policy<br />
had been revised to reflect the stronger performance of the<br />
real economy which had btecome evident without generating<br />
inflationary pressures.<br />
Our predecessors did not hold monetary growth within their<br />
projections in any of their last five years in. office.<br />
' Our success was assisted by our decision to float the $ A and<br />
remove virtually all exchange controls.<br />
This year's M3 projection has been set, responsibly, to<br />
allow the expected strong growth in real activity while<br />
accommodating only minimal cost and price increases..-,<br />
As was the case last year, the M3 projection will be<br />
reviewed over time in the light of emerging economic and<br />
financial conditions, including the impact which<br />
deregulation may have on the growth of M3.<br />
The point, as you will all be aware, is that banks now have<br />
the capacity to compete for ranges of deposits and new types<br />
of business which previously were not open to them.<br />
If banks compete successfully for this business, bank<br />
deposits will grow faster than usual. While the share of<br />
banks may be higher, aggregate financing and thus<br />
underlying financial conditions would not be fundamentally<br />
changed. . f v o<br />
i </p>
<p>Obviously it would be inconsistent with the requirements of<br />
monetary policy to respond to a faster growth of M3 which<br />
could emerge during the transitional stage from this source<br />
by tightening policy.<br />
However, it cannot be predicted in advance just how much of<br />
an impact -this kind of structural change will have on M3<br />
growth in the year ahead.<br />
To allow a proper assessment of the stance of policy,<br />
therefore, closer attention will be paid than in the past to<br />
the growth of the broader monetary aggregates, which will be<br />
affected less by structural change.<br />
I repeat that the thrust of monetary policy in the year<br />
ahead, as over the past year, will be clearly to support<br />
non-inflationary growth.<br />
The task of monetary policy in the year ahead has been made<br />
easier by the reduction in the Budget deficit together<br />
with the improved inflation outlook and other factors, this<br />
should create a favourable environnent for the further<br />
easing of interest rates.<br />
After striking the right balance last year between fiscal<br />
stimulus to recovery, and the avoidance of excessive<br />
pressures in financial markets, this year we are budgeting<br />
for a further cut of $ 1.2 billion iI the deficit, to $ 6.75<br />
billion. Again we have struck the right balance cutting<br />
the deficit while still providing a substantial tax cut; and<br />
funding Medicare and significant inprovements in social<br />
security and education in a responsbile fashion.<br />
The reduction in the deficit, coupled with the commitments<br />
made by the States at the Loan Council to hold the borrowing<br />
of their statutory authorities to about the same money level<br />
as in 1983-84, implies a substantial reduction in the total<br />
public sector borrowing requirement in real terms, in-the<br />
order of 1 per cent of GDP.<br />
Most of this will arise out of the actions which the<br />
Commonwealth has taken to reduce our own Budget deficit.<br />
In the context of the sharp improvement in the internal<br />
funds position of the corporate sector and the winding back<br />
of inflation and inflationary expectatons which our policies<br />
have produced, this should permit the downward pressure on<br />
interest rates to be maintained.<br />
A reduction in interest rates will, in turn, provide a firm<br />
underpinning to the nascent revival in business investment<br />
which has emerged over the past 6 months.<br />
4 </p>
<p>11.<br />
The Government has made very clear its view that private<br />
sector investment is vital if economic growth is to be<br />
sustained and Australian living standards are to be im3roved<br />
in the future.<br />
We have no illusions on this m'atter.<br />
Over the past year, we have achieved very high rates of<br />
growth by any standard.<br />
Of course, we acknowledge the presence of several temporary<br />
or cyclical factors the pick up in the rural sector after<br />
the drought; the reinvigoration of the housing sector,<br />
assisted by policies such as the First Home Owners' Scheme;<br />
a temporary fillip from the public sector; and the stocks<br />
cycle. In the longer term we know that business investment must<br />
make a central contribution to growth.<br />
With this in mind, we have introduced several measures in<br />
this year's Budget specifically to assist investment and to<br />
ensure that the current momentum continues.<br />
We have decided that plant ordered prior to 1. July 1985 will<br />
qualify for the investment allowance if it is first used or<br />
installed ready for use or put into use before 1 July 1987.<br />
This extends the present time limit by twelve months and<br />
will be particularly beneficial where large items of<br />
equipment or long lead times are involved.<br />
In taking this decision to extend the current concession, we<br />
had very much in mind the advice given to us by the<br />
Australian Manufacturing Industry Council favouring the<br />
retention of the investment allowance.<br />
The Manufacturing Industry Council recommended the extension<br />
of the investment allowance for three years, pending r. eview<br />
of deprecietion and other provisions of the corporate income<br />
tax. We judged it best to allow the allowance to expire on<br />
the timetable previously legislated by the Fraser<br />
Government, with an extended period for installation of<br />
plant. We believe that further community analysis and discussion is<br />
required before we are in a position finally to settle our<br />
view on appropriate .' ong-term corporate income taxation<br />
arrangements. In the meantime we have decided to introduce three features<br />
into the corporate income tax, which we are confident are<br />
consistent with any long-term reforms that we might<br />
contemplate. </p>
<p>12.<br />
We have increased the rate of depreciation on 1<br />
non-residential income producing buildings from 212 to 4 per<br />
c en t. This concession will assist cash flow, especially as<br />
time passes, and ii thu process reduce a disincentive to<br />
these furms of business invesitment. It will also provide a<br />
welcome early fillip to the n-on-residential construction<br />
industry, which has only recently begun t~ o feel the impact<br />
of the broader recovery in economic activity.<br />
We have also decided that group taxation provisions should<br />
be introduced with effect from the 1984/ 115 income year.<br />
Foll-owing the recommendations of both the Asprey and<br />
Campbell Committees, group treatment will allow losses made<br />
by one company to be offset for income tax purposes against<br />
profits made by other companies in the group with 100 per<br />
cent common ownership.<br />
This measure will especially impr~ ve the cash position of<br />
groups which undertake investments requiring long periods<br />
before becoming profitable. Perhaps even more importantly,<br />
it will remove an incentive to distortion of corporate<br />
structures that is inherent in the curzrent arrangements.<br />
Finally, we have decided to allow money spent on general<br />
mining exploration to be deductible against income from any<br />
source. I am confident that the combined effect of our policies will<br />
be to consolidate the expansion of output and employment in<br />
an environment of co-operative industrial relatCions and<br />
moderating inflation.<br />
Many of you here tonight will be as much concerned about<br />
whether the Government is willing and able to reduce the<br />
Budget deficit in the course of further growith in private<br />
investment in future years, as you are with this year's<br />
deficit. This is a valid concern, and one that the Government takes<br />
s er ioau sIy<br />
We will continue to reduce the deficit in the course ofl<br />
economic recovery.<br />
We believe that this is consistent with continued<br />
implementation of reforms and new programs which strengthen<br />
the Australian economy and society, and improve our<br />
provision for Australians in need.<br />
It is consistent with this continued program of reform<br />
because we are prepared to contain and reduce expenditure on<br />
low priority programs. S. s-l. </p>
<p>1 3.<br />
In this context, the real growth in outlays of 6.1 per cent<br />
in this year's Budget represents much mor3 substantial<br />
overall restraint than is imm . diately apparent.<br />
If we exclude the once-for-all increases associated with the<br />
Medicare reforms, this year's real growth in outlays is<br />
about 4 per cent compared with 6.7 per cent in 1983-84 and<br />
6.3 per cent in 1982-83.<br />
This 4 per cent itself is ir. flated by two considerations<br />
which are important this year but which will be much less<br />
significant in future.<br />
The domestic reductions in expectations about inflation as<br />
measured by the GDP deflator by about two and a half<br />
percentage points between February this y'ar when the<br />
forward estimates were prepared and the completion of work<br />
on the Budget, meant that a number of commitments entered in<br />
money terms early in the year were larger than would be<br />
necessary in more normal circumstances. Similarly, debt<br />
servicing commitments are set in the short term in nominal<br />
terms, and thus real terms equivalents are raised for a<br />
while by sudden and large reductions in inflation.<br />
Further, the strong growth in outlays through 1982-83 and<br />
1983-84 would have carried through into significant growth<br />
in real outlays in 1984-85, even if there were no growth in<br />
expenditures from the level of Junc 1984.<br />
Thus it will be clear that a very substantial degree of<br />
expenditure restraint is reflected in this year's<br />
appropriations. Following the experience of two Budgets, I am firmly of the<br />
view that we must review our traditional procedures of<br />
Budget formation with a view to utilising fully the<br />
opportunities for financing new and expanded programs while<br />
continuing substantially to reduce the Budget deficit..<br />
When Budget decisions are taken on the eve of or even after<br />
the commencement of a new financial year, a Government's<br />
options for securing major savings without disruption and<br />
waste are severely truncated. In future Budgets, we must<br />
seek to extend the lead times in preparation of the<br />
expenditure side of the Budget, and in implementing<br />
expenditure decisions, and to improve on the traditional<br />
practice which we have inherited.<br />
We are working towards the continuation this year and in<br />
future years, of the strong performance that began a year<br />
ago. o t o </p>

Non-farm GDP is forecast to rise by 5 per cent this year a<br />
second year of extremely strong expansion by the standards<br />
of the past decade, and in line with our long-term<br />
requirements. With employment forecast to expand b' 2, per<br />
cent, by next June, over 400,000 jobs will have been created<br />
since the Summit comfortably within reach of our election<br />
promise, widely thought to be unrealistically ambitous at<br />
the time, to create half a million new jobs over three<br />
years. Consumer prices are expected to rise by only 5 per cent<br />
through the current financial year less than the expected<br />
average of O. E. C. D. countries without any Medicare effect,<br />
after being twice the O. E. C. D. average when we took office.<br />
None of these favourable outcomes is bein'g purchased at the<br />
expense of our equity or long-term growth objectives. The<br />
opposite is the case, since our min initiatives to promote<br />
each of our three broad objectives are mutually reinforcing.<br />
The Budget takes a substantial further step towards<br />
providing ddequately for Australians in need.<br />
And through the reforms in education, industry policy,<br />
financial deregulation and business taxation in particular,<br />
it establishes a firmer base for long-term growth.<br />
The problems of Australia's economy and society that we were<br />
elected to resolve cannot be overcome with one or two good<br />
Budgets and one or two years of good economic performance.<br />
But they can be overcome if every Budget and every year<br />
makes steady and certain progress.<br />
There was good progress last year. There will be good<br />
progress this year.<br />
And I look forward to building with the Australian people,<br />
over many years, the fair society within which we can<br />
realise the great ambitions which we share for Australia.<br />
