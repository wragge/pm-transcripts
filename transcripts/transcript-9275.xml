PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS, RADIO 2UE, WEDNESDAY,<br />
13 JULY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
JL: On the line from Canberra, we have the Prime Minister, Paul Keating.<br />
Prime Minister, good morning.<br />
PM: How are you John?<br />
JL: Have you got any money?<br />
PM: Well, this is Mr Webster is it?<br />
JL: Yes.<br />
PM: You see, it's State Government Ministers without any vision and<br />
without any ideas. When the national government talks and they say<br />
well, rather than us give you a plan or sit down and negotiate<br />
something with, give us a cheque, give us some money. In other<br />
words, if you want something give us some money. Now, the<br />
Commonwealth has got a lot of money in Sydney now with the Better<br />
Cities Program in Pyrmont.<br />
JL: Yes.<br />
PM: $ 117 million and a number of areas around Sydney. I made an<br />
offer to the Fahey government, that is, that we would deal with them on<br />
this subject. They never came back to us. Not at any stage and I've<br />
been waiting for a response and a proposal. One which says look, it<br />
costs this much to take the expressway away, these are our idea about<br />
the railway. What has happened here, John, is the State Rail<br />
Authority and the Roads and Traffic Authority look, we're not having<br />
this, we want to keep our expressway and you can see basically, the!<br />
run the Cabinet down here. </p>
<p>JL Well, many people would feel that way because many people would<br />
see it simply as being pig headed and non-visionary to leave the<br />
wretched thing there when it is an eyesore and does precious little<br />
good, but they are saying it would cost $ 400 million to make the<br />
alternate arrangements and they can't afford it. Now, it's hard for<br />
anybody to deny that they're not telling the truth?<br />
PM: Based on what though? Based on what? I mean, putting the railway<br />
under ground or terminating the railway at Wynard. I mean, it didn't<br />
always go round past Circular Quay. Doing what with the road<br />
system? Selling off the real estate either end. I mean, what's the<br />
basis of that? See, at no stage has the New South Wales government<br />
come back to the Commonwealth about the issue. I'll tell you what's<br />
happened here John two things.<br />
JL I was led to believe, could you tell me if I'm wrong, I was led to believe<br />
and, I think, you might have told me that you said that you were so<br />
keen on the idea you'd be happy to sort of give them a hand, help, I<br />
think, was the word used. Is that true?<br />
PM: That's right and in other words sit down and where some of these<br />
projects are beyond the capacity of a State government and<br />
particularly where you've got national I mean, this city is going to be<br />
the show case city of the world at the end of this century.<br />
JL Well, it should be.<br />
PM: It's not going to be with the way the Fahey government is<br />
administering it with a Casino in Pyrmont, with the destruction of<br />
Pyrmont by the Roads and Traffic Authority, with the decision to leave<br />
the Cahill Expressway there, the fact is that, and I'm told that this<br />
decision has been made for two reasons. One, that the National Party<br />
wouldn't stand spending this sort of money in the city that's point one.<br />
JL Yes, well, that was intimated by Robert Webster.<br />
PM: Well, he is a National Party Minister. And point two, that the Cabinet<br />
is not strong enough for the SRA and the Roads and Traffic Authority.<br />
Just look at the destruction at Pyrmont and you can see the sort of<br />
tyranny that these bodies are actually wreaking on Sydney. No central<br />
planning. No idea about objectives, if they want to put an expressway<br />
or an elevated expressway through an urban area, they just bang the<br />
houses and the buildings out of the way and there it goes ugly as sin<br />
and the aesthetic and the urban environment is the last thought they<br />
have.<br />
JL Yep, well, you've said to me on more than one occasion that Sydney is<br />
the most wonderful city in the world. Very few people would argue, but<br />
I suppose your personal view and personal pride in Sydney can't allow </p>
<p>you to simply hand over the money because you want something<br />
done. There are other things that have to be taken into account.<br />
PM: There are important objectives here. The Olympics is an important<br />
thing.<br />
JL: Important to all Australia.<br />
PM: Well, the Commonwealth joined with the former Labor government<br />
with Neville Wran and Laurie Brereton to get this harbour tunnel built.<br />
JL: Yes.<br />
PM: Together we made arrangements to build a harbour tunnel. That left<br />
the opportunity then of feeding eastern Sydney other than by via the<br />
Cahill Expressway. So, it's now an opportunity to take it down, but I'm<br />
afraid this Government has no courage and no vision.<br />
JL: Well, when you say you are prepared to help them does that mean you<br />
would give them financial aid?<br />
PM: Yes. I've said to them if they come back with a set of arrangements<br />
that we would consider it, but it's got to be a scheme, an arrangement.<br />
But, basically what they've said is ' look, we don't care about it and<br />
there's no way the National Party is going to let us spend this money in<br />
Sydney, so, we are not doing So, the Commonwealth offer just<br />
went apparently Robert Webster said we reneged on an offer. Well,<br />
that's a straight untruth. A complete untruth.<br />
JL: Maybe I could get Mr Webster back again and suggest to him that..<br />
PM: Ask him when we reneged. Is there any correspondence? And, there<br />
won't be.<br />
JL: Yes, he said there was incidentally.<br />
PM: No, there was no correspondence. The fact is I was waiting for them<br />
to come back to the Commonwealth and they never have.<br />
JL: Anyway the point is, it's another thing that shouldn't be a political issue<br />
should it? We're talking about the beautification of the greatest city in<br />
the country.<br />
PM: You've got to have governments that have got some heart, John.<br />
JL: Yes, and you've got to have governments that are prepared to be a bit<br />
co-operative.<br />
PM: and they still haven't got an Olympic Chief appointed. They want to<br />
build a building as ugly as sin in Pyrmont which will destroy that whole </p>
<p>area over there and basically that's because of lowest common<br />
denominator guidelines. I mean, the casino shouldn't be in Pyrmont, it<br />
should be in the city proper. And, I think, that the people of Sydney<br />
and New South Wales, indeed all Australians, who are interested in<br />
Sydney particularly as the Olympics are arising, there's a stewardship<br />
here given to the Fahey government to go and make some decisions<br />
for the nation not just for Sydney or for New South Wales and<br />
making a horrible mess of it.<br />
JL: Yes, and you are prepared to be co-operative in the making of the<br />
decisions?<br />
PM: Yes, but I'm not prepared to say, to down-the-line National Party<br />
ministers ' look, here's an open cheque for what you want to do', and<br />
them saying to us ' otherwise we won't deal with you.' The<br />
Commonwealth will not deal with any government on that basis.<br />
JL: Well, I suppose the Commonwealth couldn't do that because you can't<br />
have people holding a gun to your head can you?<br />
PM: No and, you know, without basically doing what these see, there is a<br />
central issue here , John, these authorities are outside of political<br />
control.<br />
JL: That's right.<br />
PM: The State Rail Authority and the Roads and Traffic Authority will wreck<br />
any urban environment, they will destroy any city state if it suits them.<br />
They are run by engineers and all they are about is building bigger<br />
and more impressive, in their terms, expressways or corridors and the<br />
urban aesthetic, the urban environment, the beauty of the city I<br />
mean the whole notion of beauty is not even in their lexicon.<br />
JL: Yes, the thing is again and I hope you agree, that this really should not<br />
be a political issue should it?<br />
PM: Well, not when the Commonwealth government which has no<br />
responsibilities for Sydney directly has said generously because of the<br />
Olympics we will sit down and look at the central quay side area of<br />
Sydney and Pyrmont and where we have already invested, on the<br />
verge of investing $ 117 million.<br />
JL: Yes, well, you've given the City of Sydney the Qustoms House and<br />
there surely is the opportunity to make the most wonderfully<br />
aesthetically pleasing area for an entrance to this great city in this<br />
great country.<br />
PM: There are two things that the Commonwealth has done, that I've done<br />
recently. One was to give to the Council of the City of Sydney a sixty </p>
<p>year lease on the Customs House because it is a central civic building<br />
of the Quayside. It's now hidden behind the railway station.<br />
JL Yes.<br />
PM: The other thing we did was to, in the course of those financial<br />
arrangements, give the City Council the capacity to buy down the<br />
heights of the buildings behtind the Opera House, so the Opera House<br />
wasn't marred by a big, ugly set of buildings built on those sites behind<br />
the Opera House.<br />
JL Yes, it's bad enough that people ought to remember when they are<br />
complaining that it could have been worse if you hadn't have been<br />
able to do the deal with the City of Sydney.<br />
PM: What will come there won't be perfection, and it wouldn't be as I would<br />
like it all, but it is going to be much, much better than it would have<br />
ever been. Now, the only leadership which has been shown in the<br />
area of the central city and the Quayside and these environs is going<br />
to matter so much to Sydneysiders and to the country over the long<br />
term is via the Council of the City of Sydney and the Commonwealth<br />
government. Not the Fahey government.<br />
JL OK, well, you've now made it patently clear that the offer is there to<br />
help. Help, of course, in what form I don't know and that's none of our<br />
business at this stage, but something could be discussed and would<br />
be discussed if they chose wouldn't it?<br />
PM: But, I'm not going to have some down-the-line National Party minister<br />
from a State government saying ' well, Prime Minister, you give us a<br />
cheque and then don't ask any questions.' I mean, we are not dealing<br />
like that and it's up to New South Wales to come back with a proposal.<br />
They have not done. so. The Commonwealth hasn't reneged. This is<br />
just a failure of leadership by the Fahey Government, nothing else.<br />
JL Prime Minister, thanks for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you, John.<br />
ends </p>
