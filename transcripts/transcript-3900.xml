EMBARtGO: 7.00 PM<br />
7 PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 565<br />
26 September 1975<br />
AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION<br />
The Prime Minister today announced that Mr Justice<br />
A. E. Woodward, O. B. E. is to be appointed as head of the<br />
Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.<br />
Mr Justice Woodward has been a Judge of the Australian<br />
Industrial Court and of the Supreme Courts of the Australian<br />
Capital Territory and the Northern Territory since 1972. In 1974<br />
he was appointed President of the Trade Practices Tribunal.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that before his appointment to<br />
judicial office Mr Justice Woodward had had a distinguished legal<br />
career. He had appeared as counsel for the Yirrkala Aborigines<br />
in their land rights claim on the Gove Peninsula. He had also<br />
appeared as counsel assisting the Royal Commission enquiring<br />
into drilling on the. Barrier Reef.<br />
On 15 December 1972 the Australian Government<br />
appointed Mr Justice Woodward to conduct a judicial inquiry into<br />
Aboriginal rights in land.<br />
The Prime Minister said that it was appropriate that<br />
the very important position of Director General of Security<br />
should be filled by a Judge. In the Government's view, this<br />
position should in future always be filled by a person holding<br />
judicial office. Mr Justice Woodward would bring to the<br />
position qualities and a background of experience that made<br />
him eminently suitable for appointment to it. Legislation would<br />
be introduced to provide that Mr Justice Woodward would continue<br />
to have judicial status while he held this office.<br />
The Prime Minister added that Mr Justice Woodward has<br />
commitments as President of the Trade Practices Tribunal that<br />
will require his attention for some weeks ahead. His appointment<br />
will take effect from 24 November 1975. In the meantime,<br />
Mr F. J. Mahony, Deputy Secretary, Attorney-Generalls<br />
Department, would act as Director-General of Security.<br />
The Prime Minister also announced that Mr P. Barbour,<br />
the present head of the Australian Security Intelligence<br />
Organisation, would be appointed Australian Consul General in<br />
New York, He will succeed General Sir John Wilton, C. B.,<br />
who will be completing his term of office in<br />
October. / 2 </p>

Mr Whitlam said that the appointment of an officer<br />
of Mr Barbour's seniority and experience to the position of<br />
Consul General in New York was in keeping with the Government's<br />
desire to strengthen and develop its relations with the<br />
United States of America.<br />
Mr Barbour served in the A. I. F. from 1944 to 1946<br />
and joined ASIO in 1951. He was appointed Deputy Director-General<br />
in 1965 and Director-General in 1970.<br />
