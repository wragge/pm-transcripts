    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government today announced an additional $220 million nation-building investment in community infrastructure, such as libraries, community centres, and sports grounds and environmental infrastructure.</p>
<p>This brings the Government's record investment in community infrastructure to more than $1 billion since last November.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government is partnering with local government to invest in nation-building infrastructure to support jobs during the global economic recession.</p>
<p>The Government will also establish a $25 million Local Government Reform Fund to </p>
<p>fast-track improvements to the sector's infrastructure asset and financial management systems, and encourage cooperation between councils in the delivery of their services.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made the announcement today at the second meeting of the Australian Council of Local Government.</p>
<p>The $220 million injection into the Community Infrastructure Program will be delivered through two streams:</p>
<p>     * $100 million shared between all of the nation's councils and shires; and</p>
<p>     * $120 million for larger Strategic Projects, provided on a competitive basis.</p>
<p>This investment has already been allocated in the 2009-10 Budget.</p>
<p>It builds on the $800 million currently being delivered through the Community Infrastructure Program, the largest federal investment in local community infrastructure.</p>
<p>Already, more than 3,300 small- and large-scale projects are being supported in communities around Australia, supporting local jobs today by building the infrastructure we need for tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Government will commence the next round of Community Infrastructure Program funding at the end of 2009, in order to make sure that councils have completed existing smaller scale projects in a timely manner.</p>
<p>The Government will also work with councils and shires to improve long term financial sustainability and resilience.</p>
<p>Over two years, the $25 million Local Government Reform Fund will:</p>
<p>     * Assist councils implement new asset management and planning consistent with a national framework;</p>
<p>     * Fund the collection and analysis of robust data about councils' infrastructure assets; and</p>
<p>     * Support collaboration between councils on a regional basis for service delivery and planning.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government is investing in world class national infrastructure and local infrastructure to drive sustainable economic development and growth, lift levels of productivity and boost jobs.</p>
