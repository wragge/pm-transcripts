 PM: Before I get to the substance of my address today, I just want to advise you of something that happened as we were coming in for lunch. And that is a decision was released by the Full Bench of Fair Work Australia literally just a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>The decision awards more pay to people who work in the Social and Community Sector.</p>
<p>It's a historic decision because it means more money in the pockets for workers who care for those who most need our help. Many of them are women, and many of them are low paid, working hard to make ends meet.</p>
<p>This case, an equal pay case, finally gives them the recognition that they deserve.</p>
<p>This audience of course will also recognise that there's an economic dimension as well to this decision for the years that lie ahead  -  in those years we will need to attract and retain more workers in the services sectors of the economy and especially in âcaring' work which has historically been dominated by women.</p>
<p>Properly valuing caring work and providing decent wages in these service sectors will also help make our economy and our society more resilient.</p>
<p>So it's a good day for some workers who very much deserve proper recognition and they've got it today. </p>
