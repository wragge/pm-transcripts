JAUSTHRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE GOA AIRPORT, 25 NOVEMBER 1983<br />
PM: What I'm going to do is just take you through what<br />
h appened this morning generally and tell you something of<br />
what I said. And then there is a domestic matter I'd like<br />
to go to.<br />
The two things that were involved this morning were the<br />
international economics and there was a statement on Cyprus<br />
by the President and a couple of contributions from Bangla<br />
Desh and Guyana. I didn't have the opportunity of speaking<br />
there, but it is going to be further discussed on the weekend<br />
here and I will be talking about that then.<br />
The contributions on the international economics were by<br />
Mrs. Gandhi who made some brief introductory comments, but<br />
was introduced by New Zealand. Other speakers were Trinidad<br />
and Tobago. They were reporting on the outcome of the<br />
Commonwealth finance ministers meeting. Tanzania, Sri<br />
Lanka, Kenya and I wound it up.<br />
I'll go through the contribution that I made. There was no<br />
doubt about the seriousness of the problems confronting the<br />
international community in securing long term growth and<br />
employment and I emphasised the ultimate progress in regard<br />
to dealing with these matters is involved in ensuring that<br />
the measures which are adopted contribute to the long term<br />
solution. I put it that there were four crucial pre-conditions<br />
in achieving this.<br />
The first one is that the domestic policies of the major<br />
industrial countries should be compatible with the requirements<br />
of sustained economic recovery.<br />
Secondly, that there be a movement towards a free and open<br />
international trading system.<br />
Thirdly that there be firm action directed at strengthening<br />
existing international financial institutions.<br />
Fourthly, that appropriate domestic economic policies be<br />
followed by all countries whether they were developing countries,<br />
middle developed countries or fully developed countries that<br />
there is no way in which you could expect that problems were<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>going to be solved by just looking-outside yourselves. We<br />
all have to adopt appropriate policies.<br />
They were the four crucial pre-conditions. I said that in<br />
the framework there seem to be five major economic policy<br />
tasks confronting us.<br />
Firstly, the promotion of growth in developed and developing<br />
countries so th at from this growth we will be able to get<br />
higher employment and better living standards.<br />
Secondly, a revival of trade, especially through serious<br />
efforts to promote conditions which were consistent with open<br />
model trading system.<br />
Third, that we have to promote the adjustment process in<br />
debtor countries by maintaining flows of finance from official<br />
sources which in turn would operate as a catalyst force for<br />
simulating private growth.<br />
Fourthly, that there had to be an encouragement of a greater<br />
convergence in economic policies between countries so that<br />
there could be a reduction in exchange rate fluctuations and<br />
in that way create a better environment for trade investment.<br />
Fifthly, that there should be a lowering facilitation of<br />
lowered international interest rates which means particularly<br />
a reduction in the inordinately large budget deficits that<br />
are around and in that way improving inflationary expectations.<br />
I said on each of those points the major industrial countries<br />
beared particular responsibility. For example, if you look<br />
at the high interest rate levels, they had been influenced<br />
by size in the fiscal deficits in the major industrialised<br />
countries and that has contributed considerably to the<br />
uncertainty in international markets and is responsible<br />
for large question marks that must be said to exist over the<br />
durability of sustained international economic recovery.<br />
I then went on to point out that a particularly significant<br />
feature of recent experience has been the growing recognition<br />
of the danger posed by increasing resort to protectionism and<br />
there was an understanding develop ing of the heavy interrelationship<br />
between trade and financial policies, both<br />
domestically within countries and internationally.<br />
From this I went on to speak particularly from Australia's view,<br />
saying over recent times the aggressive use of subsidies by<br />
the European and the United States which is threatening markets,<br />
bringing about suppressed returns and creating price instability<br />
and within that framework the increasing tendency amongst the<br />
majors to settle issues between them by bilateral arrangements<br />
don't necessarily take into account the interests of smaller<br />
countries and I pointed out to them that Australia really had<br />
suffered within that process. There were three bites of the<br />
cherry, if you like, as far as we are concerned. / 3 </p>
<p>Firstly, with the development thing, the European Community.<br />
We had been pushed out of traditional markets there.<br />
The second stage in the process was where the European Community<br />
had then started to subsidise its exports in surplus production<br />
into our traditional markets and had hit us there.<br />
Now, thirdly the third stage is that. we've got the United<br />
States responding to that process and I pointed out by way of<br />
example the fact that in the traditional area of our wheat<br />
market, was now having to build wheat silos as part of<br />
the sale of wheat to match the sort of conditions which the<br />
Americans are providing in their sales.<br />
I emphasised that the sorts of solutions that are arrived at<br />
between in these bilateral deals the majors at the expence<br />
of third countries are not only discriminatory and<br />
inequitable, but they involve the gradual undermining of<br />
orderly international trading system. Therefore, one of the<br />
things that we had to give emphasis to was the return to<br />
creation of an open multi-lateral trading system.<br />
I pointed out that within this context there had been some<br />
calls for a new round of trade negotiations and I said that<br />
our response to that would be influenced by the extent to<br />
which these are going to address themselves to the needs of all<br />
countries developing as well as developed and that as far<br />
as we are concerned we would welcome a new round, providing<br />
that there was a comprehensive approach to the problems of<br />
international trade.<br />
I then moved on to talk about the central relevance of the<br />
effective management of the situation of the heavily indebted<br />
countries and this has now come to be recognised as critically<br />
important to the past in restoring a balanced global trade<br />
and system. I said that it was important that the<br />
adjustment process makes it possible for the heavily<br />
indebted countries to service their debt and particularly by<br />
way of increasing their export earnings.<br />
Now, I went on then to say that the critically important<br />
retail area is the role of the international financial<br />
institutions and I went out of my way to say that it had to be<br />
understood in discussions like this just what a critically<br />
important role the international'financial institutions had<br />
fulfilled. They had provided the backstop in a channel<br />
through which arrangements can be made between debtor and<br />
creditor nations and with the major banks. This had to be<br />
understood if you were going to really address yourself<br />
sensibly to the future. You had to reall~ y understand that they<br />
have done a very significant job and that--what was important<br />
now was to see that despite the bridging role, the major<br />
financial institutions was facilitated so they could really<br />
exercise their mandative role. / 4 </p>
<p>Now, in this respect I said the early application to the<br />
8th IMF quota increase in the large general arrangements<br />
to borrow is important and it would still remain to be<br />
considered whether following that ratification you still<br />
had to consider then whether the liquidity needs of the<br />
international financial institutions would be sufficient<br />
for them to discharge their responsibilities and in that<br />
context I pointed out that while you could look to a rapid<br />
growth in international liquidity flowing from the deficit<br />
of the United States balance of payments, it still seemed<br />
likely that some liquidity would remain scarce and I then<br />
said,' should it be the case that the recent sharp decline in<br />
the balance of the IMF loan coming at the same time as<br />
reduced opportunities for borrowing for lenders. If it<br />
appeared in the day circumstances, that there was bound<br />
to be a particular pressure on fund resources and that there<br />
may be a case for supplementing those resources. I didn't<br />
pursue the details of that but really was concerned to flag<br />
that that was something that we may have to consider.<br />
I then pointed out that the CHOGM is likely to be<br />
in regard the provision of concessional finance through the<br />
International Development Association and therefore pointed<br />
out that it was necessary to recognise the need for the<br />
replenishment of the IDA to be implemented to be agreed and<br />
implemented on schedule by July of next year.<br />
I referred to the United States tradition in that regard<br />
because the problem there is the task confronting the United<br />
States administration in getting Congressional agreement<br />
to that replenishment and I pointed out that we attached<br />
very particular importance to the American participation<br />
replenishment should be at a level commensurate with the<br />
historical share which the United States has had in the IDA.<br />
I pointed out that we had in fact, in bilateral discussions<br />
with the United States administration, stressed the importance<br />
we attach to that.<br />
I said that this necessity of negotiating annual bridging<br />
arrangements was a most inefficient and unsatisfactory way<br />
of providing funds for such a major international institution<br />
and this would be avoided if possible.<br />
Overall, I wanted to say two things that the international<br />
financial institutions have done'an important job. They have<br />
shown a flexibility and a capacity to do an important job<br />
in difficult circumstances and it was important that they be<br />
provided with the funds necessary to enable them to meet the<br />
existing problems.<br />
I then went on and said that the relationships between trade<br />
and development in monetary issues it was now recognised that<br />
was in dispute was the nature of the economic mixture<br />
between trade, financial, monetary and other macro-economic<br />
policies. What mix was necessary to address the immediate<br />
problems and try and get a basis for long terin sustainable<br />
economic growth. </p>
<p>I pointed out it wasn't surprising that the differences<br />
should be apparent and what therefore was needed was<br />
co-operative action which the Commonwealth was well-placed<br />
to try and sustain to stimulate world trade and promote<br />
international economic activity.<br />
Now, I then went from that to say that what we've got to do<br />
is be realistic in our approach to this and what really<br />
the essence of the problem confronting the Commonwealth now<br />
is to balance on the one hand that sensitivity to the<br />
dimension of the problems that exist that on the one hand,<br />
but on the other to be putting proposals which would get<br />
the necessary measure of international agreement which would<br />
be critical if you are going to get effective action.<br />
So, what I said was needed were wide policies and approaches<br />
and not some possibly endless wrangling about new financial<br />
insitutions or existing ones.<br />
So, the task at CHOGM was to show a continued readiness to<br />
look for practical and realistic remedies to the international<br />
situation.<br />
So that really concludes it. On the basis of therefore<br />
adopting the realistic approach of what is achievable I said<br />
that we would rate very high priority to be attached to<br />
ensuring the effective operation of the existing institutions<br />
and that that point should be the focus of any group the<br />
working group that was set up by the Commonwealth in this<br />
area. I went on to say that it was particularly relevant to the work<br />
of any such group that it should secure the co-operation of<br />
the major developed countries and to ensure that they retain<br />
their concern and support for the IMF and the world bank<br />
because they were the major sources of funds for those<br />
institutions. Therefore, any group set up should really be<br />
directed towards this way to develop some sort of<br />
consensus building process.<br />
I then said finally, that subject to those sorts of conditions<br />
being adopted by the Commonwealth that Australia would be<br />
prepared to endorse a proposal that Commonwealth members<br />
should take steps to explore with other countries how these<br />
issues that I have been talking about could be effectively<br />
addressed and solutions advanced.<br />
That was it.<br />
JOURNALIST: How does it look as though this debate is panning<br />
out. I mean I just want to get some sort of context. To what<br />
extent so far has there been a lot of support for this group<br />
to look at new financial institutions? / 6 </p>
<p>PM: The interesting point to make there is that in his<br />
presentation Muldoon was, I think, much more cautious<br />
in his approach. He was not pushing aggressively for a new<br />
Bretton Woods conference. He was stressing the need to<br />
move cautiously to try and get agreement and interestingly<br />
Mrs. Gandhi also, in her intervention made the point that<br />
if you could get existing institutions to work effectively<br />
then there was -no need to create something else. So, I<br />
think the exposition that I gave and which was prepared<br />
in advance is consonant with the type of approach which seems<br />
to be coming. In other words, before hand there seemed to<br />
be a sort of rush towards a brand new Bretton Woods conference.<br />
They went straight to that and were going to solve the problems.<br />
Now, there seems to be a recognition that that is not the<br />
appropriate approach and I welcome that because my view has<br />
been, and not only expressed here, but I gave some indications<br />
beforehand that you have got to recognise that the existing<br />
institutions have done a considerable job and it is much more<br />
likely that the major industrial countries are going to be<br />
prepared to work through a strengthening of the existing<br />
institutions than be responsive to some excessively optimistic<br />
concept about, as I say, some radical new approach.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does it look at this stage as though there will<br />
be this group set up<br />
PM: It's too early to say because the only speakers so far,<br />
as I say, have been Muldoon and Trinidad and Tobago reporting<br />
on the Commonwealth finance ministers meeting. Then we had<br />
Kenya. We had Tanzania and Sri Lanka and myself. So this<br />
matter will be resumed. We are not going to talk about this<br />
over the weekend. Basically well, not in a structured way.<br />
It looks as though the main topics over the weekend will be<br />
Cyprus and Southern Africa, although there will be probably<br />
some discussions about where they may be able to go in general<br />
statements on the international security area, but the detailed<br />
debate on this will be picked up on Monday.<br />
I would guess that this sort of approach. that I have formulated<br />
there and it got a very good reception. I think that if those<br />
sorts of qualifications are embraced that probably there would<br />
be no significant opposition to that sort of step, if you<br />
like. JOURNALIST: And that basically is where Muldoon is at the<br />
moment. Do you think Muldoon will accept something like that?<br />
PM: Let me put it this way. His introduction was not<br />
inconsistent with what I'm saying. He has observably moved<br />
to a more cautious, I think I would say, and more realistic<br />
expectation about how you can go about this.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mrs. Thatcher, though, seems to be / 7 </p>
<p>PM: Mrs. Thatcher is yet to speak and so I can't indicate-<br />
I just don't know, but I think that in broad terms she<br />
would see than the sort of approach I've made.<br />
JOURNALIST: Had you done much brief chatting and talking to<br />
heads of government about this particular issue before the<br />
debate started?<br />
PM: No, not a -great deal. In the meeting with Mrs. Thatcher<br />
on the first morning we did traverse it slightly, but no,<br />
up to this point the other issues have been very much more<br />
on peoples' minds.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could I just check. I think you mentioned at<br />
the start there being some domestic matter you wanted to<br />
raise. PM: Well, let's be quite straightforward. Are you aware of<br />
w; hat's come out of this Business Review Weekly by<br />
Stuart Simpson?<br />
JOURNALIST: I'm not aware of it.<br />
PM: Well, it's something that by the time we meet on Sunday<br />
you may be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible<br />
PM: I'm sure it's for the best<br />
JOURNALIST: Well anything you say now can get in our main<br />
editions, so if you would like to say something, by all<br />
means do so.<br />
PM: Well, what's happened is that Stuart Simpson has used<br />
sgome revised Summit projections that were circulated to<br />
participants at the last EPAC meeting. And he is making<br />
some suggestions that this may tend to undermine the<br />
Government's case on indexation and so on and I believe that<br />
Peacock and Howard are calling some press conference to<br />
carry on with this matter. Well, I would certainly like to<br />
say something about that. These matters are relevant.<br />
The first, that the revised projections that were put at the<br />
meeting. They had no official status and they were not<br />
accepted by EPAC. At the meeting there was discussion about<br />
technical problems that were in fact involved and the<br />
shortcomings were recognised and specifically it was said<br />
that it would be some time before we would be in a position<br />
to have reasonably reliable medium term forecasts. The<br />
authors of these projections emphasised that they were<br />
projections and not forecasts and you will appreciate the<br />
difference. Really, their main value is for testing outcomes<br />
from various policy assumptions.<br />
The second point that I would make is that in any case the<br />
revised projection one was broa~ dly consistent with the Budget<br />
forecasts and the general. observations that both the<br />
Treasurer and I have been making about growth througih the<br />
year of the order of 5-6% </p>
<p>Now, the next point I would make is that if you looked at the<br />
economic indications that are in fact available to us now,<br />
they do show that the economy is performing considerably<br />
better than is suggested in the revised projection one.<br />
Just for example, it referred to a 3% growth in dwellings<br />
investment, which is obviously considerably understated.<br />
14% growth in farm output, which again, I think, is considerably<br />
understated and also the employment and unemployment elements<br />
in it were, I believe, an understatement of the outcome that we<br />
can reasonably expect.<br />
Now, that is for comments in regard to 1983/ 84 on the<br />
projections. Now, of course, beyond 83/ 84, as I have been<br />
stressing in recent speeches in Australia, it is too early to<br />
be making judgements about that. But what I have been saying<br />
what is fundamentally important is that we've got to make sure<br />
that the business community and the trade unions have got the<br />
right sort of attitudes and approaches if we are going to<br />
sustain beyond 83/ 84 the significant improvement that is clearly<br />
coming into place now, as a result of the policies that we have<br />
adopted. I would think we would make the observation that<br />
as far as beyond 83/ 84 is concerned, I remain confident that<br />
we will be able to make the sorts of decisions that are<br />
necessary to deal with that clearly.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could I just clarify that. The point is that<br />
these revisions were not accepted by EPAC.<br />
PM: Well, let me make it clear. They were projections that<br />
were put up. They were not accepted by EPAC as in any sense<br />
definitive. The authors pointed out the difficulties<br />
involved in their construction, the assumptions that were<br />
involved and the only way in which they were in any sense<br />
regarded as being immediately useful, was for conferring<br />
alternative policy assumptions and that they were quite<br />
unreliable about actual outcome. As I pointed out in several<br />
observations, if you look at what we built in for 83/ 84 like,<br />
as I say, in regard to dwellings investment 3% in 83/ 84,<br />
obviously it's going to be very, very much better than that.<br />
Obviously the farm output figures are going to be very much<br />
better than the 14% that was built in. So, any attempt to<br />
suggest that that sort of information which wasn't accepted for<br />
any other purpose by EPAC than for testing possible alternative<br />
assumptions, that that indicates-any problems as far as what<br />
is happening and it was an absurdity. It is just completely<br />
unsoundly based because I would make the fairly obvious<br />
observation as far as Messrs. Peacock and Howard are concerned<br />
it is quite understandable that they would be clutching at the<br />
odd straw like this, in the light of the avalanche of<br />
statistical information that is becoming available about how<br />
well the economy is going. I mean, since we'vye left you would<br />
have seen the reference to the Melbourne Institute consumer<br />
confidence survey, which shows the best figure, I think, for<br />
12 years. When you take all that evidence with the other that<br />
was there before we left, you certainly understand Peacock<br />
and Howard trying to grab hold of something. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Is it the Government's intention subsequently to<br />
do what it did at the Summit and that is make public these<br />
sort of projections?<br />
PM! What is done with the material of EPAC is a matter for<br />
decision by EPAC. There would be a whole range of material<br />
which just simply wouldn't be appropriate to distribute beyond<br />
EPAC where it was there simply for the purposes of comparing<br />
with possibilities of determining outcomes tape ends<br />
if there was some material which would be useful in<br />
stimulating a general debate and EPAC regarded it as appropriate,<br />
well then, that would be done. EPAC will be the master of its<br />
own destiny in that respect.<br />
JOUR~ NALIST: Just to follow up on an earlier point. you<br />
obviously are very concerned at the trading situation in terms<br />
of our products, particularly agricultural products the<br />
EEC and the United States. Is there any specific action we can<br />
take on this approach in the near future and is this something<br />
which you will be taking up yourself with these countries?<br />
PM: Well, there are three points to be made about it.<br />
W e raised it here at CHOGM which collectively the Commonwealth<br />
ought to take up and use its influence in relevant international<br />
fora to try and increase the proportion of international<br />
trade which is part of a free open multi-lateral trading system<br />
because the sort of evidence now suggested about 50% of<br />
international trade is in fact not in that category. The<br />
second thing is that we have already made representations to,<br />
for instance, the United States and Japan in this area where we<br />
are concerned that the discussions between the United States<br />
and Japan may be to our disadvantage. So, we have already<br />
made representations. I have made them and so has Lionel Bowen.<br />
The third point, yes, we will continue to make these<br />
representations in our bilateral relations with various countries<br />
and we will continue to make them in relevant international<br />
fora.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can I just ask you how do you think Grenada is<br />
going to go? Do you think it is likely to reach an accord<br />
during the formal talks here?<br />
PM: No, I don't think there is any possibility of an accord<br />
on this.<br />
JOURNALIST: If there are discussions of any assistance to<br />
Grenada, as far as policing and that sort: of thing, would<br />
Australia be willing to contribute?<br />
PM: I don't want to say anything about that at this stage. You<br />
k now from the report of what I sai~ d yesterday that if there<br />
were a position where the Commonwealth and the countries<br />
concerned wanted some sort of training assistance for police<br />
there. That was one thing that was specifically mentioned by<br />
some of them. Obviously that is something that we would take / 11 </p>
<p>into account. We would consider it. But let's be clear that<br />
that is a quite hypothetical position. There is no suggestion<br />
at this stage that even that minimal sort of request would<br />
be made. </p>
