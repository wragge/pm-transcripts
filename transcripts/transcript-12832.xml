I am pleased that Alec Campbell of Hobart, Australia';s last surviving Gallipoli veteran has today been the first Australian to receive the Centenary Medal.<br />
The Centenary Medal was announced on 28 December 2001 to honour persons who have made a contribution to Australian society and government.  All Australian citizens born on or before 31 December 1901 who lived to celebrate the centenary of federation on 1 January 2001 are entitled to receive the Medal.<br />
Alec enlisted in June 1915 at the age of 16 and joined the 15th battalion at Lemnos.  He served at Gallipoli and returned to Egypt on Christmas Day 1915.  In early 1916 he was in and out of hospital until he embarked for Australia in June 1916. Later years saw him sail in the Sydney to Hobart yacht race six times and in 1950 he circumnavigated Tasmania aboard the Kintail.<br />
It is entirely fitting that Australia';s last surviving Gallipoli veteran, indeed it is understood probably the world';s last Gallipoli veteran, should be the first to receive this important award.  Alec Campbell and others of his generation have lived through all of Australia';s federal history and played their part in establishing Australia as a modern, prosperous and independent country.<br />
That generation both in peace and war, established the Australian spirit which succeeding generations have found an inspiration.  Mr Campbell as the last veteran of the tragic and heroic deeds that occurred at Gallipoli in 1915 is a living reminder to us all of that spirit.<br />
I know that all Australians will join me in congratulating Alec Campbell on the award of the Centenary Medal as a â€˜thank you'; for his contribution to our nation. </p>
