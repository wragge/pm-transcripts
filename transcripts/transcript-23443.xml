    <content><![CDATA[<p>John, thank you so much. Thank you for your lovely words and thank you for the honour of riding with the <em>Soldier On</em> ride from Lake George into the War Memorial this morning.</p>
<p>I have to say that I do feel more than usually fraudulent this morning. First, because Iâm not a soldier â never have been â but it is an extraordinary honour to mix with our serving men and women. Itâs a particular honour to spend time with those who have been on the various frontlines on which Australians have been active in recent years, suffered for their service, returned and dwelt amongst us.</p>
<p>I also feel slightly fraudulent because the ride was more than 200 kilometres and Iâve only done about 30, but nevertheless, itâs a terrific way â as John has just pointed out â to maintain physical and mental health.</p>
<p>I congratulate <em>Soldier On</em> for the work that theyâre doing.</p>
<p>No one deserves well of us like our former military personnel.</p>
<p>No one deserves better of us than those who have put their life on the line for our country.</p>
<p>Yes, we all know that people who come back from military service abroad carry physical scars and, often, the even worse mental scars. It is fitting and right that these be recognised, treated, but above all else, understood and accepted, and thatâs what events like today are all about.</p>
<p>It is about appreciating that even the strongest, even the bravest, even the toughest, can carry scars through life that need to be understood and accepted.</p>
<p>So, yes, it is a real honour to be here today.</p>
<p>I feel humble as well as just a little proud to have been a part of this ride.</p>
<p>It was particularly good to be able to spend a few moments with Mrs Janny Poate whose son was one of our killed in Afghanistan. No one suffers like the parents of those who suffer.</p>
<p>So, it is good that <em>Soldier On</em> recognises and helps all who are part of our ex-service community.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, John. Itâs a pleasure to be with you.</p>
