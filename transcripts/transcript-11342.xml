<p>  Well thank you very much Mr Charlton. Janette and I are delighted to share</p>
<p>   this tremendous celebration which commemorates the commencement of what</p>
<p>   must rank as one of the greatest achievements of the history of the Australian</p>
<p>   nation. The Snowy Mountains Scheme was a phenomenal engineering achievement,</p>
<p>   and it has done an enormous amount to help and build the modern Australia.</p>
<p>   But even more importantly than that the Snowy Mountains Scheme was an amazing</p>
<p>   Australian achievement in bringing people together and binding them into</p>
<p>   one mighty Australian workforce. And as I moved through the crowd today,</p>
<p>   it's a reminder to me of the incredible range of nationalities, of ethnicities,</p>
<p>   of people of different cultures, of different language, many of whom may</p>
<p>   have had the odd argument with each other before they came to Australia,</p>
<p>   but once they came to Australia they all found in this new welcoming tolerant</p>
<p>   country a new homeland. And I want to say on behalf of that country, from</p>
<p>   the bottom of our hearts, how immensely grateful we are to the men and women</p>
<p>   of the Snowy who gave us this wonderful national achievement.</p>
<p>  In so many different ways you taught us different cultures, different habits,</p>
<p>   and they've all now become part of the great Australian mainstream. So can</p>
<p>   I say on behalf of the Government, can I say on behalf of all of the people</p>
<p>   of Australia, that we are immensely proud of the engineering achievement</p>
<p>   which is the Snowy River Scheme. We are immensely proud of the national</p>
<p>   development achievement which is the Snowy River Scheme. But even more importantly</p>
<p>   than that we are immensely proud of the human achievement which is represented</p>
<p>   by the Snowy River Scheme. And today which must rank probably as the biggest</p>
<p>   family reunion ever staged in Australia, certainly the biggest family reunion</p>
<p>   that I've ever been to, I simply want to say to all of you, we are immensely</p>
<p>   proud of what you did, we are grateful for your commitment, we remember</p>
<p>   those who suffered and those who lost their lives in the construction at</p>
<p>   various stages of the Snowy Scheme. We remember the vision of those people</p>
<p>   who put the scheme together more than 50 years ago. And it is a marvelous</p>
<p>   opportunity under this beautiful Australian sun to celebrate 50 years of</p>
<p>   the commencement of the Snowy Scheme, and all of the great cultural diversity</p>
<p>   that the Snowy Scheme helped to bring to the modern Australia. A million</p>
<p>   thanks to all of you.</p>
