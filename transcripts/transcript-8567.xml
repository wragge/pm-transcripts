PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MPENTOMBING<br />
CEREMONY, CANBERRA, 2 JULY 1992<br />
On behalf of the Australian government and people it is<br />
my pleasure to welcome you here.<br />
I extend a particular welcome to those who are veterans<br />
of the Vietnam War, and to the many relatives d~ d-fr-en-s<br />
of those -who died in Vietnam and whose memory we are<br />
honouring today.<br />
I thank you all for coming to this historic ceremony in<br />
the life of our nation.<br />
The men to whom we pay tribute gave their lives for their<br />
beliefs. They believed in Australia.<br />
They went to Vietnam as their fathers' generation had<br />
gone to Europe and the Middle East and Asia and the<br />
Pacific; and as their grandfathers' had also gone to<br />
Gallipoli and France and other foreign battlefields.<br />
They went in defence of their country and the things they<br />
had been raised to believe in.<br />
Like those previous generations, they saw no incongruity<br />
in travelling far from home to defend their country's<br />
freedom. They saw their duty.<br />
They went believing that in defending democracy in<br />
Vietnam they were defending democracy everywhere and,<br />
most particularly, Australian democracy.<br />
Today we do not judge the political wisdom which sent<br />
them there, or which-delivered Australians to other<br />
theatres of war throughout this century.<br />
These people gave their lives for Australia.<br />
We pay tribute today to their bravery and sacrifice. We<br />
pay tribute to their love of this country and their faith<br />
in its traditions and its future. </p>
<p>2<br />
And in commemorating them we hope and trust that this and<br />
future generations of Australians will find in themselves<br />
the same love of Australia, and the same faith in its<br />
future.<br />
The Vietnam War cut deeply into Australia's soul.<br />
By comparison with the two World Wars the list of names<br />
recorded here is small.<br />
Yet this is somehow a measure of the burden the veterans<br />
of Vietnam had to bear and have borne ever since.<br />
Vietnam touched us all: it went deep into Australian<br />
politics, Australian life, Australian thinking.<br />
It divided the country to an extent unequalled since<br />
1917. It did great damage. It did some good.<br />
Its effects are still with us.<br />
They always will be.<br />
But no Australian knows these effects half as well as<br />
those who fought and suffered there.<br />
And no others paid the price that these 504 Australians<br />
paid. In honouring their valour and sacrifice today, we<br />
acknowledge that in this most debated and disputed of all<br />
wars, the first war to be televised, the real burden<br />
remained where it has always been in war on those who<br />
fought and on their families and friends.<br />
I think it can be said that the passionate debates at<br />
home contrived to obscure this fact: as if the war was<br />
really being fought here.<br />
It was not. As these 504 Australians knew. As the<br />
veterans of this and all other wars know. As their loved<br />
ones know.<br />
In fact I think it is true that our forgetting this was<br />
an extra burden, an extra pain, for the veterans of<br />
Vietnam and their families and friends to bear.<br />
That is why today those words " Lest We Forget" have a<br />
profound meaning.<br />
The memorial will be henceforth the symbolic resting<br />
place of all those who died serving Australia in Vietnam. </p>
<p>3<br />
Those who visit the memorial in future years will know<br />
that Australia did not forget.<br />
They will know that these Australians were heroes of the<br />
same order as the Anzacs, as those who fought in France,<br />
the Middle East, New Guinea and every other place where<br />
Australians have gallantly fought and died.<br />
From now on Australians will know that and they will<br />
know it better if our hopes today are realised:<br />
I mean our hope that now we are putting aside for all<br />
time the differences and the bitterness which the Vietnam<br />
War engendered in our community.<br />
Our hope that such faith and courage as these Australians<br />
had will not be found wanting in this and future<br />
generations. Our hope that this commemoration of those who died will<br />
be taken as a symbol of the gratitude which the nation<br />
owes them and their loved ones.<br />
And our hope that we will succeed in building in<br />
Australia a fair and just democracy, faithful to our best<br />
traditions and brave enough to embrace the future.<br />
For there can be no better way to honour the memory of<br />
those whose names are recorded here.<br />
Thank you. </p>
