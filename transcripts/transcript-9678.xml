SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
LUNCH IN HONOUR OF SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THlE CENTRAL<br />
COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM<br />
HIS EXCELLENCY MR DO MUOl<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBEiRRA, MONDAY 31 JULY 1995<br />
General -Secretary, it is a great personal as well as an official pleasure to welcome you<br />
and your party to Australia.<br />
I remember very well our first meeting in Ho Chi Mimli City last year. I greatly<br />
appreciated your courtesy to mc that day in travelling a long distance from a provincial<br />
visit you were making to meet me. But this time you have come even further in<br />
support of friendly relations between Australia and Vietnam.<br />
Our meeting in Ho Chi Minh City went well over the time our officials had scheduled,<br />
because we found in our discussion as we have found again today how much<br />
Australia and Vietnam have to learn from each other and how much we can do<br />
together. You have brought with you to Australia a number of senior colleagues and business<br />
people from Vietnam.<br />
Their presence at this lunch and the presence of so many senior Australian<br />
businesspeople reflects thc growing recognition in both our countries of the<br />
importance of this relationship and its potential. They are also very welcome guests.<br />
You have arrived here at an important time for Vietnam and the region.<br />
Last Friday Vietnam became the seventh member of ASEAN. Australia welcomed this<br />
historic development.<br />
We now have a new range of opportunities to build our relationship regionally as well<br />
as bilaterally.<br />
Eventually, we hope Vietnam will participate in the discussions we have been holding<br />
on links between the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement and the Australia-New Zealand<br />
Closer Economic Relations arrangement. </p>
<p>I ELL: 2<br />
We also welcome the normalisation of relations between Vietnam and the United<br />
States, which was announced early this month. As you know, Gencral-Sccretary, this<br />
is a development Australia has consistently encouraged over manly years.<br />
In fact, Australia's policy in the region has been guided by the conviction that the<br />
region will be stronger, its institutions more resilient and its chanices for prosperity and<br />
peaceful development greater if Vietnam is ffilly engaged in its development.<br />
That is also why we think that in due course Vietnam is a natural member of APEC.<br />
Both Australia and Vietnam have been through a period of deep economic and social<br />
change in recent years.<br />
In Australia, we have committed ourselves to an open economy. deeply integrated with<br />
Asia. Our firture lies ftilly and unambiguously in the Asia-Pacific. For us, there can be<br />
no U-turns.<br />
We havc dismantled the tariff barrier which ring-fenced our country, opened up our<br />
financial markets and embarked on a pro-growth, low-inflation policy with the<br />
cooperation of the trade union movement.<br />
These policies have given us rates of growth among thc highest in the industrialised<br />
world. Vietnam's program of economic reform Doi Moi has also involved economic<br />
restructuring on a large scale. Your successes are evident already, with growth rates<br />
of more than 8 per cent a year, and a real increase in per capita GDP of 26 per cent<br />
between 1990 and 1994.<br />
In other words, the Vietnamese people are already experiencing the tangible benlefits of<br />
this policy.<br />
Your reform program reflects some of the qualities Australians admire most in the<br />
Vietnamese people resilience, determination, an underlying pragmatism and<br />
willingness to change. These are qualities that Australians share.<br />
Australia's relationship with Vietnam is not new.<br />
The war, with all its suffering. left scars which remain in both countries, but which I<br />
believe are healing.<br />
Australia was one of the first western countries to recognise the Socialist Republic of<br />
Vietnam more than 20 years ago.<br />
And we were the first to resume aid after the Cambodia settlement.<br />
We have built a relationship of substance. In 1982 our trade was $ 2 million; ill 1994 it<br />
was $ 402 million.<br />
Australia is the sixth largest foreign investor in Vietnam, with over $ 920 million<br />
invested last year. </p>
<p>TEL: 3<br />
The companies involved are some of Australia's largest and most experienced like<br />
BlI-P, Teistra and the ANZ Bank as well as smaller innovative businesses.<br />
Our aid program has grown too from $ 10 million in 1990/ 91 to $ 72 million in<br />
1995/ 96. We arc working with Vietnam in health, education and major infrastructure<br />
projects. We witnessed just a short time ago the signing of agreements covering our cooperation<br />
in building the huge My Thuan bridge project and Australia's commitment to draw up<br />
an integrated master plan for the economic development of the Southern Economic<br />
Focal Zone, based on Ho Chi Minh City and Vung Tau.<br />
But the major component of our aid program is education. Currently 450 Vietnamese<br />
are training in Australia and I would like our education links to grow. Because I<br />
strongly share your view that education is the key to both our countrics' fuiture.<br />
Our dialogue has grown and deepened with Vietnam across a wide range of issues.<br />
Ministerial and other official exchanges are miultiplying rapidly.<br />
We were very pleased that the Australian Parliamntary Consultative Delegation was<br />
ablc to visit Vietnam in April this year and to hold very constructive discussions<br />
throughout the country, including opening up a dialoguc on human rights. This was an<br />
important visit and we were grateflu for your cooperation.<br />
I am sure that one great long-term asset in our relationship is the skilled and<br />
resourceful commnunity of around 140,000 Vietnamese Australians. This community<br />
has enriched our country, with people like Professor Ngo Van Long of the Economics<br />
Department at the Australian National University and Thu Nguyen Hoan, the deputy<br />
head of our Office of Multicultural Affairs.<br />
And the community will, I am sure, also enrich our bilateral relationship.<br />
The air services agreement which was signed this morning will help this process. More<br />
than 32,000 Australians many of them Vietnaniese-Australians travelled to Vietnam<br />
in 1994 for business or tourism or to see their families. These personal links will<br />
expand and broaden our relationship.<br />
Australia wants more than a relationship with Vietnam: we want a partnership. One<br />
that reaches across a wide range of official business and people-to-people activities.<br />
One which grows out of a deeper understanding of each other's culture and society.<br />
Your visit is an important milestone to this goal.<br />
We welcome you to Australia. 1 HUq . J zu " 4u vu 1 1 % J_ </p>
