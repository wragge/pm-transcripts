TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH DEAN BANKS, RADIO 3AW, 11I MAY 1994<br />
DB: Prime Minister, thanks for joining us.<br />
PM: Pleasure, Dean, nice to be here.<br />
DB: I believe this is a first for your office?<br />
PM: Yes, this is right from the... . well, it is not an oval office, it is a square<br />
office, a rectangular office, but it is a first.<br />
DB: Well if it is not the oval office, then no new taxes is probably the<br />
message from the Budget.<br />
PM: Well, no new taxes, strong growth, strong employment. 4.5 per cent<br />
growth over a qu arter -of a million new jobs in the course of the year.<br />
As you say, no new taxes, and a deficit which takes us down, as we<br />
said, to that 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. So, it is one that sets the<br />
whole country up to grow with low inflation throughout the<br />
DB: You have been involved with, what, eleven Budgets and mini<br />
statements and economic statements and so on. How many does that<br />
total over the years?<br />
PM: About 21 or 22.<br />
DB: How does this compare? I mean, when you are not there doing the<br />
driving?<br />
PM: This is a tip top result. The measure of good housekeeping in Budgets<br />
is always to have a look at those outlays, and there we have got the<br />
outlays growing below the rate of economic growth and they are<br />
trailing down through the balan-ce of thF-9O-s. Which means then, of<br />
course, without resort to revenue, as there is no tax increase in the </p>
<p>Budget, it means the Budget balance just, sort of, churns back towards<br />
surplus.<br />
DB: Prime Minister, your comments earlier in the week, or last week, with<br />
regard to the overseas markets, I mean in some respects are Budgets<br />
today for those overseas markets?<br />
PM: No, I think they are for the business community, and I was very<br />
pleased at the reaction which the Government has had to the Budget<br />
from the markets, and yesterday longbonds dropped back a bit in fact.<br />
But the main thing is one of the strong elements of the Budget is<br />
business investment. We have got strong pick up in business<br />
investment and that's where the employment comes from, and that's<br />
why the key businesses here are the actual employing companies, that<br />
people actually make things and do things rather than simply trading<br />
financial securities.<br />
DB: How dependent are they then on the banks? And is there a message<br />
here for the banks?<br />
PM: No, I think the message for the banks is I think it is a good message<br />
for the banks and that is, that we are going to have an extended<br />
recovery and we are going to have it with lowinflation and low inflation<br />
means, with it, interest rates kept at low levels.<br />
DB: No concerns about what they laughingly referred to as the Gumnut<br />
twins?<br />
PM: What are the Gumnut twins?<br />
DB: The two Green Senators.<br />
PM: The two Green Senators. I think they will approve of this. This, of<br />
course, consolidates the White Paper, employment changes in respect<br />
of the long term unemployed, and we have got in this Budget over ten<br />
years the Aboriginal land fund to complement Mabo, we have got $ 500<br />
million in a program over five years for Aboriginal health. There is $ 63<br />
million here over a four year period for homelessness and homeless,<br />
particularly young people. There is a $ 169 million mental health<br />
program, there is a $ 209 million program over four years for breast<br />
cancer, $ 93 million for medical research and we put $ 135 million<br />
between now and the Olympics for the preparation of our Olympic<br />
athletes, which I think is going to be a very popular program. And as<br />
well as that we boosted foreign aid in the Budget. But all with these<br />
very low outlay to GDP numbers.<br />
DB: So, in summary, no problems with regard to the Senate like we<br />
suffered last time? </p>
<p>PM: No, I think the Greens and the Democrats and others would look at<br />
those things, the Aboriginal land fund, the Aboriginal health program,<br />
homelessness, a national Asian languages program, mental health,<br />
breast cancer, child immunisation et cetera, as things which very much<br />
sort of fit in their general orbit or constellation of the policy.<br />
DB: How does the Aboriginal health funding sit with what the former<br />
Senator Richardson was talking about?<br />
PM: Well, that was largely what he was talking about, at about these levels,<br />
which is a very big complement to the funding. And it is like all these<br />
programs, you have got to be able to live with them effectively, it is not<br />
simply a matter of money, but making sure the money can actually be<br />
spent properly and programs established. And I think we can do that<br />
here, but it is a very big increase in funding for Aboriginal health, and I<br />
think Graham Richardson, who is the Senator you are speaking of,<br />
would be very happy indeed with this outcome.<br />
DB: Prime Minister, you have been involved in so many of these, as you<br />
mentioned, the Budgets and the Statements and so on. What is the<br />
process? Sitting at home having breakfast this morning, I mean, what<br />
goes on, and how long does this process take to put together a<br />
Budget?<br />
PM: It generally takes about two to two and a half months of running<br />
through the outlays, most of the time is on the outlays, that is, the<br />
spending programs of the Commonwealth. And we have a core group<br />
of Ministers called the Expenditure Review Committee, and we have<br />
had it here for over ten years now. This group basically agrees to any<br />
new policy, it sets the priorities for new policy by going through the<br />
Cabinet submissions which each Minister presents. And it also<br />
decides what the savings items should be, changing the nature of<br />
policy to yield a saving and produce better program delivery. And it is<br />
because of so much intensive ministerial time, the fact that this has<br />
basically been done by the one core set of Ministers over a decade<br />
that Australia's fiscal position is so much better than most comparable<br />
countries. In fact, there is, I think, in the general OECD or Western<br />
World area, we are going to be in a very highly advantageous fiscal<br />
position. Basically, because of that intensive ministerial work.<br />
DB: I can remember when I was a kid growing up in this country, the<br />
comment would be made when a Menzies Budget came out, " Oh well<br />
there's no tax benefits in this one," and that was about all that we<br />
talked about.<br />
PM: Well, they were prepared by the Bureaucracy in those days. I mean<br />
the Treasury would write a speech and the Treasurer would stand up<br />
and read it out. But that all changed in 1983 when the Ministers ran,<br />
from then, the Ministers have run the Government. And now the<br />
bureaucracy works for the Government and works for the Cabinet, and </p>
<p>because there is so much authority vested in Ministers, if Ministers<br />
actually get off their tail and do things, and take responsibility and<br />
make decisions you can kick along, in a very big way, the prospects of<br />
any country. And that's what has happened here. Ministers now have<br />
tremendous program knowledge so that in a sense, they have almost,<br />
in many cases, well, not almost, but in many cases superior knowledge<br />
than bureaucrats because many Ministers have actually managed<br />
program longer than some of the bureaucrats in their area. But as<br />
well as that they have the authority to change things, so they become<br />
very effective and that's why fiscal policy, or budgetary policy in<br />
Australia is the product of the Government and not simply just a<br />
Treasury document which the Treasurer politely reads out.<br />
DB: What about the state of Victoria, the City of Melbourne, is there in the<br />
Budget Papers, are the funding messages there for us with regard to<br />
roads programs and some of the other majors which were talked about<br />
some time ago?<br />
PM: Well, the big one, I think, was the one I announced a week ago in the<br />
White Paper, and that is the main tunnel. We are looking at<br />
feasibilities on that to see whether it is possible to build that, which I<br />
think would do a lot for the city of Melbourne. The other big change<br />
we announced was the process of sale which was announced in the<br />
Budget last night in respect of the Airports, and that would include over<br />
time, Tullamarine Airport, which would then be privately owned and<br />
able to be expanded. We have got the infrastructure bonds which I<br />
announced in the White Paper a week ago, and that gives us the<br />
capacity, or anyone, particularly Victoria. Say if they want to build a<br />
light train service from Tullamarine to Melbourne, infrastructure bonds<br />
could fund that, because we have made them much more attractive to<br />
low taxed institutions like super funds. So, there is a lot there, I think,<br />
for Victoria, but the main thing there, is growth and jobs. We have had<br />
a quarter of a million job growth in the last year and we will have a<br />
quarter of a million job growth in the coming year.<br />
DB: All right, and those tax cuts as promised, still on track?<br />
PM: Well we have provided the first round of tax cuts. Let me take this<br />
opportunity, Dean, just to make these points. Governments go to<br />
elections and they make commitments and people say, " Oh yeah,<br />
yeah, where are they." Well, the tax cuts were paid, the first trance of<br />
tax cuts were paid late last year, and that has made a big difference to<br />
demand in the economy. We have had the Mabo legislation which we<br />
campaigned on in the election campaign established through a long<br />
consultative process, and introduced. I said in the election campaign<br />
we wouldn't leave the unemployed behind, and the White Paper is a<br />
mammoth attempt to actually case manage all of those people<br />
personally who have been unemployed over 12 months or more,<br />
intensively if they are over 18 months unemployment and intensively if<br />
they are under 18 years of age. So that commitment is there. The </p>
<p>commitment to the Aboriginal land fund, to Aboriginal health, the<br />
Governments broad thrust of its election commitments, will now, as a<br />
result of the White Paper and this Budget, be put into place.<br />
DB: And did you enjoy the party last night?<br />
PM: The party here is what we call in the public sector, the psychic income<br />
because a lot of the people in the bureaucracy, the public sector is not<br />
highly remunerated as parts of the private sector are. People like to<br />
think good policy and doing good works. The reward is some psychic<br />
income. So, you can always tell. I mean, last week we had the White<br />
Paper and I met the people in our bureaucracies, Department of Social<br />
Security and Employment Education and Training and Prime Minister<br />
and Cabinet and Finance, and the various departments, you could feel<br />
the great pride that people had in doing what was not something just<br />
novel in Australian terms but in world terms, and similarly with the<br />
Treasury Offices and Finance and some of the other control<br />
departments in respect of the Budget. You can feel, again, a good job<br />
has been done. It is a very nice feeling and gives all the Ministers, I<br />
think, a lot of pride.<br />
DB: Good of you to give us that time, and maybe when you are next in<br />
town you will come back to the building that you opened years ago?<br />
PM: That's right, I remember that well. It is good it has been kept in the<br />
business in the stream of radio. There we are, and they bought it for a<br />
song as well, which was an even greater joy for the management.<br />
Well, in this recovery there will be plenty of profits including radio<br />
profits.<br />
DB: Let's hope so, nice to talk to you. Prime Minister just one final<br />
question, not associated with the Budget, but we are doing a<br />
broadcast on D-Day from Britain. Can I simply just ask you are you<br />
looking forwardl to going and participating?<br />
PM: Well, I am looking forward to it. Of course, D-Day was the largest<br />
amphibious operation ever mounted and was a turning point in the<br />
battle for Europe, and that of course was the battle for liberty in the<br />
world. And the fight against nazism and fascism. I think about 2,600<br />
Australians took part in the invasion of Normandy, mainly members of<br />
the RAAF but also naval and army personnel. So, along with other<br />
Heads of State and Government and from other allied countries I will<br />
be very pleased to take part in the commemoration ceremonies at<br />
Portsmouth, and then after crossing the channel at Normandy.<br />
DB: And maybe there is a chance we can catch up during that broadcast<br />
from London.<br />
PM: I look forward to it. </p>
