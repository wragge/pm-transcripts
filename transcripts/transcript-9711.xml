SPEECH BY THE PRIME INISTER THE HON P J KEATING. N2<br />
NATIONAL COMMEMORA17ON SERVICE V P DAY, BRISBANE. 15 AUGUST 1995<br />
'' CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY'<br />
I have been privileged in the past three years to visit some of the cemeteries in Asia and<br />
the Pacific and in Europe where Australian servicemen and women lie buried. It has<br />
been my duty to utter some words of tribute on behalf of the Australian people and<br />
participate in services to commemorate their deeds and sacrifice.<br />
It has been one of the great privileges of my life. But it is a humbling experience. No<br />
Australian can fail to be affected by these places.<br />
This year, as part of the Australia Remembers program, many veterans of our World War<br />
HI campaigns have made pilgrimages to the battlefields and these cemeteries. I think it is<br />
beyond the capacities of my generation to appreciate just how deep their feelings must<br />
have run.<br />
It is not, however, beyond us to understand and it is our duty to try. It is our duty to<br />
convey to our children what the deaths of those Australians mean to all of us and will<br />
always mean.<br />
Most Australians will never stand among the graves in Bomana and Lae, or Singapore or<br />
Kanchanabuni or Yokohama or in any of the cemeteries in Europe, Sritain or the Middle<br />
East. But all of us should know that Australians are buried there.<br />
We should know why, and the meaning it contains for us.<br />
We cannot know what their last days were like; what suffering they went through, what<br />
pain and longing and despair they endured so far from home. We can only imagine.<br />
And fifty years later we can feel the loss of their lives as our loss.<br />
To stand among those graves is to recognise the profound truth of the ties that bind us as<br />
Australians. These are Australians like ourselves. But these Australians gave their<br />
young lives: gave them so we might live in peace and freedom, gave them so we might<br />
enjoy the blessings of life and enjoy them in the country they loved-</p>
<p>Contemplate those graves, or the 40,000 names on the World War II Honour Roll at the<br />
Australian War MemoriaL and the story of this country, and the story of every one who<br />
calls it home, takes on an irresistible meaning.<br />
It instils in our national life a sense of duty.<br />
The story tells us that there was a generation of men and women who so loved this<br />
country, and the freedoms and way of life we now enjoy, they were prepared to lay down<br />
their lives. There were Australians who so loved what is just, they defended it to the<br />
death. We cannot think about this without understanding the debt we owe them, and the duty we<br />
have to honour their memory.<br />
To truly honour them is much more than a ritual task. It is to take the knowledge of their<br />
sacrifice into our daily lives and the life of Australia-It it is to love this country and give<br />
to it as they did which is to say with that same faith from which their inspiration, effort<br />
and endurance flowed.<br />
It is to believe in freedom as they did, defend freedom as they did. To work together as<br />
they did.<br />
It is to make this country as strong and secure as they made it.<br />
Time has changed our perspective on the world and on ourselves. We have had to adjust<br />
our thinking to accommodate necessities. In many ways I think we are better for it. It<br />
may be that we are less naive and more worldly than the Australians of fifty years ago. I<br />
believe we are more tolerant and more open.<br />
But if we are to succeed as we should we will always need their strength, their collective<br />
spirit, their sense of duty, their faith. We will need their inspiration<br />
I hope that this Australia Remembers year has reminded us all of these things.<br />
Never did a generation of Australians have more reason to celebrate than those of<br />
years ago. In pure and simple terms they were celebrating a victory. They had fought for<br />
what they believed in and won. They had truted in their values and in each other and<br />
they had been vindicated. Now they had every reason to expect the rewards of peace and.<br />
prosperity. What we have done this year is to join them in this celebration, in this same confident<br />
belief in the futue. </p>
<p>3<br />
Today we should recognise that we have the same unbreakable link to those people who<br />
danced in the streets 50 years ago as we do with those who lie in those gaves in New<br />
Guinea and Borneo and Thailand and Japan.<br />
We are part of the one story.<br />
I think this Australia Remembers year will have been a triumph if it has reminded us of<br />
that I hope our commemorations this year have remided the Australians of today that<br />
they have as much reason to celebrate as those of 50 years ago.<br />
And the reason is the same-We are a free and independent people, we live in peace and<br />
we have a great future.<br />
And we have these things in common and we have a duty to Australia. </p>
