26 January 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
SPEECH TO MARION CITY COUNCIL AUSTRALIA DAY<br />
CITIZENSHIP CEREMONY, HALLETT COVE, SOUTH<br />
AUSTRALIA<br />
( tape begins)<br />
past few days, rather as being the miracle of being an Australian. On an occasion such<br />
as this there's no shortage of words, there's no shortage of cliches, there's no shortage of<br />
rhetoric and often there's no shortage of, on occasions rather, meaningless comments<br />
about national identity. I just want to say to you that the most important things that we<br />
should think about on an occasion such as today are those things that unite us and bind us<br />
together as Australians. It's always been a strong belief of mine that the core of continued<br />
nation-building is to focus on the things that we have in common rather than the things<br />
that might divide us or might push us apart.<br />
Everybody has their own view of what constitutes the Australian identity. That is the<br />
nature of a democracy. It is not the role of the Prime Minister, it is not the role of any<br />
self-appointed group of national identity dietitians to tell us what our national identity is.<br />
A national identity is something that belongs to the entire community. It is something that<br />
comes out of the spirit of a people. It is something that is fashioned over a period of time<br />
or fashioned or influenced by some great, traumatic or earth-shattering events in the<br />
history of a nation and that is the case with Australia as it has been with many other<br />
countries. I was reminded by the message read from Andrew Southcott that one of the<br />
great achievements of Australia is that we have been one of only eight countries that have<br />
been continuously democratic through the whole of the 20th century, and whilst it is<br />
acknowledged that many countries lost their democracy through invasion and conquest<br />
and through no fault of their own, it is a particularly meritorious achievement and<br />
something that those who would tend to denigrate the Australian achievement, those who </p>
<p>would see the Australian identity as being linked in part with a perpetual apology rather<br />
than a proud assertion of what this country has achieved, I think that we have been, along<br />
with only seven other nations the only group of nations to be continuously democratic<br />
through the entire 20th century, it is a tribute to the skill of those that have gone before us,<br />
it is a tribute to the special character of this country and it is a tribute to the Australian<br />
achievement. Like any nation we have stains in our past, we have made mistakes, we have done<br />
injustices to people. Injustices and underprivilege remain in modern Australia. To pretend<br />
that everybody has a full measure of the Australian achievement is to ignore reality. To<br />
pretend that there are not things that remain to be done to generate a more secure, a more<br />
just and a more equitable Australian community is also to ignore reality. But when you<br />
assess a nation, you assess a balance sheet of its past achievements and the current state of<br />
its being and when you apply that to Australia, that balance sheet has been an<br />
extraordinarily positive one. And one of the many things that has distinguished the<br />
Australian achievement has been our remarkable openness and tolerance. No nation in the<br />
world has more successfully absorbed people from the four corners of the Earth in a more<br />
tolerant fashion than has the Australian nation and when it comes to tolerance and when it<br />
comes to willingness to accept people, this nation should bend its knee to no group of<br />
people or to no nation in asserting the tolerance and the liberties and the open heartedness<br />
and the fair mindedness of the Australian community. Our success over recent decades in<br />
particular in successfully absorbing people from the rest of the world in an atmosphere of<br />
great harmony and great openness and great tolerance is one of the proudest things we<br />
should feel on Australia Day and I for one, and I think I echo the views of millions of<br />
Australians in saying it, that that is something of which we can be assertively proud and<br />
not in any way apologetic or in any way lacking in a very strong affirmation of what<br />
Australia has achieved.<br />
Can I say to those people who are becoming Australian citizens for the first time today,<br />
welcome, thank you for making our country yours. We welcome the contribution that you<br />
make. By becoming Australian citizens I naturally invite you to continue as I guess is the<br />
case with all of you, your very active participation in Australian and community life and as<br />
Australian citizens in the fullest sense of the word to exercise and enjoy the privileges of<br />
living in this country.<br />
I spoke in Sydney at an Australia Day gathering of some of the characteristics that have<br />
always distinguished the Australian society and the Australian community and one of those<br />
characteristics of course has been our informality, our openness and our lack of<br />
pretension. I think there's something quite evocative and touching about having a<br />
citizenship ceremony on the edge of the water. The ocean has always played a very major<br />
part in shaping the psyche of Australia. To millions of Australians an identification with<br />
the sea, an identification with the water has been part and parcel of their upbringing, and a<br />
part and parcel of how they think of themselves as Australians. I should say, Mr Mayor,<br />
Your Worship, that having this Australian Day ceremony on the edge of the ocean, I<br />
couldn't think of a more appropriate spot. It's a reminder that we have come, we're a </p>
<p>nation that to a large extent is made up of people who have come across the ocean, either<br />
by ship or more recently by planes to make this their home. And of course it is also a<br />
reminder that we are as a nation an amalgamation of those who have lived here for tens<br />
and thousands of years, the original Australians, and those who have come more recently<br />
over the last two hundred years and it is also, as the General Manager pointed out, an<br />
opportunity to reflect upon the importance of a better understanding between all<br />
Australians and a determination to achieve through the remedying of disadvantage a full<br />
and complete reconciliation between all members of the Australian community.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, this above all is an occasion for us to forget our differences,<br />
whether they be of a political, commercial or other kind. It is not a day that belongs to the<br />
Liberal Party, the Labor Party or to any other Party. It is not a day that belongs to any<br />
particular view about how Australian society should be run within the democratic<br />
tradition. It is a day to celebrate things in common. It is a day to celebrate the unity of<br />
the Australian people. It is a day to celebrate the miracle of being an Australian and it is<br />
most importantly the day to be immensely proud of the role model of tolerance and<br />
openness that Australia represents to the world, not only now in the late 1990s but over<br />
the 200 years that have gone by since European settlement.<br />
Thank you very much. </p>
