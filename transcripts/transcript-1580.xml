STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, a"<br />
THE RT. HON. HAROLD HOLT IN THE 23<br />
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 9<br />
19TH MAY, 1967 ~ R A R'<br />
" VOYAGER" INQUIRY<br />
I am sure the House would have wished the Government<br />
to move as speedily as it could in resolving terms of reference which<br />
could be submitted to the inquiry I announced yesterday. It is our desire,<br />
as I am sure it is the desire of every member of the House, that these<br />
matters hould be investigated expeditiously and findings given upon them.<br />
Consequently I bring to the House what we propose by way of terms of<br />
reference. My colleague the Attorney-General ( Mr. Bowen) will set as<br />
speedily as he can about the business of finding what judges would be<br />
available for this purpose. We would hope to make an announcement about<br />
that as soon as this can be arranged.<br />
I shall comment on one aspect not covered by the terms of<br />
reference after I have given their detail, since it relates to a matter<br />
raised in the debate by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr.<br />
Clyde Cameron I as spokesman for the Opposition and was mentioned, if<br />
a little obliquely, by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Whitlam) when he<br />
was questioning me yesterday as to what the terms of reference would<br />
cover, We felt that in order that this matter could be dealt with with<br />
reasonable promptitude and so that there should not be uncertainty<br />
increasing the distress of affected persons, we should concentrate upon<br />
those matters which we believed were exercising the attention a nd concern<br />
of the Parliament and of the public. We recommend that the terms of<br />
reference of the inquiry be<br />
To inquire into and report upon:-<br />
Whether any of the allegations made by Lieutenant -Ccmmander<br />
P. T. Cabban in the document attached<br />
That Is the document to which the Leader of the Opposition made reference<br />
yesterday; I think it ran into about nineteen pages<br />
regarding the drinking habits and seamanship of Captain<br />
D. H. Stevens were true and being true established that<br />
Captain Stevens was unfit to retain command of HMAS<br />
" Voyager"<br />
If it is found in answer to question that Captain Stevens was<br />
unfit to retain command of HMAS " Voyager"<br />
Did the Naval Board know or ought they to have known<br />
of such unfitness to retain command and were they at<br />
fault In failing to relieve him of command?<br />
( ii) Should the findings made in the report of the Royal<br />
Commission relating to the loss of HMAS " Voyager"<br />
be varied and, if so, in what respect?<br />
Whether the allegations in the document disclosed evidence which<br />
was available to counsel assisting the Commission and was<br />
improperly withheld from the Royal Commission. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
I think honourable members will agree that this concentrates<br />
the inquiry on the salient matters which were of concern to them. The<br />
other matter to which we did give consideration, but for reasons which 1,<br />
shall outline we did not include in the terms of reference, was the aspect<br />
raised by the honourable member for Hindmarsh as to the circumstances<br />
in which the Government came to settle a number of claims of dependants<br />
of those who went down with the ship. I think a little reflection by the House<br />
will confirm the soundness of the view we have taken that to include an<br />
item of this sort would prolong the Inquiry indefinitely and would confuse the<br />
issues on which we have concentrated in the terms of reference that I have<br />
read out. The Government has no desire, in this particular aspect, otber<br />
than to see that the inquiry is able to concentrate on the matters which<br />
primarily engaged the attention of the House.<br />
Concerning the aspect of the settlein of claims, the Attorney-<br />
General ( Mr. Bowen) would be entirely willing to confer with the Leader of<br />
the Cpposition and his colleagues or, for that matter, other interested<br />
members, explaining why this procedure was followed. I am sure that most<br />
honourable members will be able, from their own practical good sense, to<br />
come to the conclusion that this was the desirable and sensible course to<br />
pursue. Firstly, there was a Royal Commission which was taking<br />
evidence and which necessarily would extend over a considerable period of<br />
time. Litigation is inevitably a protracted process and even dealing with<br />
the claims by way of settlement has, in some instances, been drawn out since<br />
the disaster until either late last year or even early this year. Thirty-nine<br />
claims have been settled and I think one claim remains outstanding because the<br />
claimant has not yet furnished certain particulars which were required. If<br />
each of these claims had to be litigated upon or even if some of them had<br />
to be litigated upon, in a period in which there was a Royal Commission with<br />
its findings to be resolved, then there not only would have been delays which<br />
would have been Inconvenient to dependants in need of financial assistance,<br />
but the whole process for them would, I suggest, have been of a more<br />
harrowing, painful and, indeed, embarrassing kind. So this was the<br />
background to the course of action which the Government pursued.<br />
If further detail Is required on this aspect then, I repeat,<br />
the Attorney-General will be happy to supply it. Of course, it Is always<br />
open for the Opposition, if for any reason it felt dissatisfied with the course<br />
pursued, to take appropriate parliamentary action in relation to it. I do not<br />
believe the Opposition will do this. I think that on reflection members<br />
opposite will agree that It was not appropriate for this matter to come into<br />
this particular set of terms of reference. The inquiry will necessarily<br />
take the form of a Royal Commission, because it is under the legislation<br />
concerning Royal Commissions that we can set up the inquiry. To do it<br />
any other way would call for legislation.<br />
Mr. Hayden It will not be another whitewash, will it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER That remark is quite unworthy of the honourable<br />
gentleman and it would not be echoed by his colleagues. I hope I do not<br />
have to stress again that the purpose of my predecessor, as it has been of<br />
myself and my colleagues, has been to see that the truth emerges and that<br />
justice Is done. </p>
