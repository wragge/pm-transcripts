A US rxI<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
MJR PRESS 9 FEBRUARY 1978<br />
ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS IN<br />
THE ALLIGATOR RIVERS REGION<br />
The Government wishes to assure the Aboriginal people in the<br />
Alligator Rivers Region that until their claims over land<br />
in Stage II of the Region have been determined it will not<br />
permit granting of mining interests over that land without their<br />
prior consultation and agreement.<br />
This assurance is, however, on the understanding that Aboriginal<br />
claims in Stage II will be lodged as soon as practicable and<br />
preferably not later than the end of this year. To this endthe<br />
Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will have early discussions<br />
with the Northern Land Council on the timing and extent of<br />
the claims.<br />
After the Aboriginal land claims have been determined the<br />
Aboriginal Land Rights ( Northern Territory) Act would, of course,<br />
apply including its consent provisions.<br />
The Deputy Prime Minister has already announced that the Government<br />
will direct the Administrator of the Northern Territory to<br />
defer the granting of any mineral lease or exploration licence<br />
in Stage II of the Region until the control procedures<br />
have been finalised and Aboriginal claims over land to be claimed<br />
have been determined.<br />
The control procedures for Stage II will be finalised as soon as<br />
possible and before there is any minerals exploration in the<br />
area. The Government is also expediting the purchase of the<br />
Mudginberri and Munmarlary pastoral leases in Stage II in order to<br />
create an opportunity for Aboriginal land claims to be made<br />
and determined.<br />
Negotiations are at present taking place between the Northern<br />
Land Council and the Ranger Joint Venturers. An early conclusion<br />
of these negotiations is important. The Government will do<br />
everything in its power to ensure that the Ranger Project<br />
is developed as quickly as possible subject to meeting the<br />
necessary contraints, social and environmental, and protecting<br />
Aboriginal interests in accordance with the Government's<br />
statements to Parliament on 25 August last year. </p>
