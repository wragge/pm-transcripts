    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.............................................................................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, are you any closer to an agreement with the Democrats?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We had another long discussion today, and the discussions today as</p>
<p> yesterday were constructive and we're going to resume our discussions</p>
<p> on Monday morning in Canberra. And it's been agreed between us that</p>
<p> while these discussions go on resumption of the debate in the Senate</p>
<p> on the tax legislation will not occur.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That really asks me to make a comment on what's happened and I don't</p>
<p> intend to do that. I'm sorry to disappoint you all but I'm to confine</p>
<p> myself on the subject of taxation to simply saying that we have had</p>
<p> another lengthy and constructive discussion. The conversations have</p>
<p> been cordial and frank, and all of those things and we're going to</p>
<p> talk again on Monday.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Were you happy with the way the talks have gone?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They have been constructive and cordial, and we're going to resume</p>
<p> them on Monday morning Peter.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does that mean some progress has been made Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It means what I said.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] some changes Prime Minister? Would any changes need to</p>
<p> go to a party room meeting?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How long's the legislation on hold?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>While the discussions go on we won't resume debate on the legislation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You can't put it on hold forever though can you Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh come on. We're getting into the realm of the absurd now. Any other</p>
<p> questions on another subject? I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I couldn't hear that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you optimistic [inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I'm not going to start using those words. I find them sort of</p>
<p> pointless expressions to use at this stage. We're having a discussion</p>
<p> and that discussion is resuming on Monday.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Senator Lees says [inaudible] still not negotiable. What are your</p>
<p> thoughts on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't have anything to add to what I've said.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, is it your understanding that Senator Lees [inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Glenn, with the exception of the Labor Party I always make it a practice</p>
<p> not to comment on the internal workings of other parties.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Senator Lees said that the Government had put some options on the</p>
<p> table, I think they were her words. Can you outline those?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, no, no. I'm not going to outline anything other than to say</p>
<p> what I've said. Now if you've got a question on another subject I'll</p>
<p> answer. If not I'll go back inside.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, I've got a question on another subject. There was a picture</p>
<p> of Tony Staley in The Telegraph today with Mr Keating's former business</p>
<p> partner. How do you read that picture, and what are you going to....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I've seen a rather imperfect facsimile of it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does it concern you that a party figure was pictured in this way,</p>
<p> and what are you going to do about an inquiry and when are you going</p>
<p> to do it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Michelle, for heaven's sake. The last thing I do....I've got far</p>
<p> more to preoccupy my time with then, you know, getting a report card</p>
<p> from the Federal President of the Party as to who he has a cappuccino</p>
<p> with in the autumn sun of Sydney. He can have a cappuccino with anybody</p>
<p> he likes. As for the question of the inquiry, our position remains</p>
<p> as I stated it before - we don't intend to conduct a political witch-hunt</p>
<p> on Mr Keating. We will examine the matter on the merits and thus far</p>
<p> there's been no decision taken to hold an inquiry. But I continue</p>
<p> to get advice from the Attorney-General on the subject.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, what's your response to the New South Wales' drugs summit</p>
<p> recommendation to shooting houses, [inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not convinced that that will achieve the objectives we all have</p>
<p> in common, and that is to reduce drug addiction. I'm not convinced</p>
<p> of that. I felt that the drugs summit was pressured, you might even</p>
<p> say politically verballed by what occurred in Kings Cross in the weeks</p>
<p> that led up to it. I'm unconvinced and I hope that the New South Wales</p>
<p> Premier remains unconvinced. But that is a matter for him. He's the</p>
<p> Premier of New South Wales, it's a State matter. I have no control</p>
<p> over it but if you want my opinion, I'm quite happy to give it to</p>
<p> you. Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
