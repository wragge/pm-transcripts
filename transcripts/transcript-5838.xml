FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 18 JUNE 1982<br />
DEATH OF SIR KEITH AICKIN<br />
I was saddened to learn of the death of Sir Keith<br />
Aickin. Sir Keith brought to the High Court, to<br />
which he was appointed in 1976, the skills of one<br />
of Australia's most eminent constitutional and<br />
commercial lawyers. He served the High Court and the<br />
country with distinction. His quiet, courteous<br />
manner and the wisdom of his advice earned him<br />
the respect and affection of all who came in<br />
contact with him.<br />
I extend my sympathy to Lady Aickin and the family. </p>
