    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government welcomes the initiatives announced today by the NSW Government to address the problem of radicalisation.</p>
<p> The radicalisation of our youth is occurring at an alarming rate.</p>
<p> Our most effective defence against terrorism is to prevent people from becoming terrorists in the first place.</p>
<p> The new measures announced by the NSW Government will supplement substantial work underway by the Commonwealth, working in conjunction with States and Territories, to address violent extremism, particularly through de-radicalisation programmes.</p>
<p> The measures complement the proposals discussed with community leaders and law enforcement agencies at the recent National Meeting on Countering Violent Extremism held in Canberra on 15 October 2015.</p>
<p> Further initiatives in these areas will be discussed with the States and Territories, in consultation with the community, at the COAG meeting in December.</p>
