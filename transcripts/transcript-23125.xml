    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today marks the official commencement of Australiaâs Presidency of the G20.</p>
<p>Hosting the G20 in 2014 is a big opportunity and a big responsibility for Australia.</p>
<p>It allows us to help shape the global economic agenda for the benefit of all countries, and provides the opportunity to showcase the best of our nation.</p>
<p>The G20âs membership includes most of Australiaâs largest trading partners â particularly those in the Asia-Pacific with whom we already have close and valued relationships.</p>
<p>Australiaâs G20 Presidency in 2014 will focus on:</p>
<ul><li>Promoting stronger economic growth and more jobs; and</li>
<li>Making the global economy more resilient to deal with future shocks.</li>
</ul><p>As this yearâs host, Australia has invited Singapore and New Zealand to join the G20 table in 2014. Both will bring much expertise to the G20âs work.</p>
<p>The G20 Summit will be the most significant meeting of world leaders Australia has ever hosted.</p>
<p>With 4,000 international delegates and 3,000 media anticipated to attend, it will bring global exposure to Brisbane in a way not experienced since the Commonwealth Games and World Expo of the 1980s.</p>
<p>There will also be a dedicated Trade Ministers Meeting and a dedicated Employment Ministers Meeting as part of the G20 2014 agenda.</p>
<p>I thank Premier Newman and the Queensland Government for working closely with the Commonwealth to support a successful Leaders Summit in November 2014.</p>
<p>Premier Campbell Newman said Queensland was looking forward to hosting both the G20 Finance Ministersâ Meeting and Leadersâ Summit.</p>
<p>âQueensland is Australiaâs most diverse and beautiful state and is known worldwide for its beautiful beaches and stunning outback, but there is so much more to offer,â Mr Newman said.</p>
<p>âWe are leading Australia in economic growth, business investment is up, tourism is undergoing a revival and confidence is high.</p>
<p>âThere has never been a better time to invest, employ and grow in Queensland.</p>
<p>âWe look forward to having Brisbane and the entire state in the world spotlight and the economic benefits that will follow from holding the G20 Summit here.â</p>
