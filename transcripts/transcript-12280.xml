    <content><![CDATA[<p>I congratulate the Most Reverend Peter John Hollingworth, AO, OBE, on his appointment by Her Majesty The Queen as Australia's next Governor-General. He will succeed His Excellency the Hon. Sir William Deane, AC, KBE.</p>
<p>Currently the Archbishop of Brisbane and a former Australian of the Year, Peter Hollingworth is an Australian of great distinction, having won wide acclaim for his involvement in the secular life of the nation as well as for his religious work.</p>
<p>He will be sworn as Governor-General on 29 June 2001. Although the appointment is at The Queen's pleasure, a five-year term is considered usual.</p>
<p>Archbishop Hollingworth was born in Adelaide in 1935. His vocation to the priesthood became clear during his National Service in 1953 and his interest in social welfare emerged soon after, during his studies in Arts and Theology at Trinity College, Melbourne.</p>
<p>Since then, his ministry with the Anglican Church has been paralleled by a close involvement in social welfare, most notably through his leadership roles in the Brotherhood of St Laurence. He has displayed a constant concern for the disadvantaged in our society.</p>
<p>Archbishop Hollingworth became Archbishop of Brisbane in 1990, and since April 2000 he has chaired the National Council for the Centenary of Federation.</p>
<p>Peter Hollingworth and his wife Ann were married in 1960. They were engaged while students at Melbourne University where Mrs Hollingworth qualified as a physiotherapist. They have three daughters, two grand-daughters and a grand-son.</p>
<p>I know that all Australians will wish Archbishop and Mrs Hollingworth well in their new and very important roles.</p>
<p>22 April 2001</p>
