TRANSCRIPT OF THE PM ON CARLETON WALSH WEDNESDAY 11 JUNE 1986<br />
CARLETON: Have you not got it right this time. If you got<br />
everything that you asked for in the speech would that finally<br />
fix the economy.<br />
PM: I think it would at this stage do everything that we as a<br />
Government and a community could do. We've always got the<br />
position Richard, as you well appreciate, that we're here in this<br />
situation because of what the rest of the world has said to us<br />
about the prices they're going to pay to us for our exports. If<br />
we were to have a further catastrophic decline in the terms of<br />
trade then we'd have further problems. On the assumption that<br />
we've reached the nadir in the terms of trade, then yes I think<br />
we've got the strategy now to deal with that challenge that's<br />
been created for us.<br />
CARLETON: Some of the instant reaction has been a litzle<br />
disappointing, or a little bit of disappointment in your speech.<br />
You said earlier on the 7.30 Report tonight, that you don't know<br />
what will happen overseas tonight, or whether it will be welcomed<br />
in London and New York when they start trading the Australian<br />
dollar. If the dollar was to drop a cent and a half tonight<br />
overseas, would that be failure on your part?<br />
PM: No it would not be failure on my part. I would have to ask<br />
the international community what more can a government do when<br />
the matters directly under its control, that is in regard to<br />
budgetary policy, I've made it quite clear that we are well on<br />
the track to significant reduction in our own expenditures. In<br />
the area where-we don't have control, but where we have some<br />
influence wages I have made it unequivocally clear that there<br />
has got to be further discounting. Now the community, the<br />
business community, can't ask for more than that.<br />
CARLETON: What were the hard decisions that you had to make,<br />
that you spoke of in the speech?<br />
PM: Let me first of all say that it is not easy for a Prime<br />
Minister to tell his nation that they've got to have a reduction<br />
in their standards of living. Let me spell it out quite clearly,<br />
that is what's got to happen. It's not easy, but it's got to be<br />
done, Secondly, it's not easy where you have an accord with the<br />
trade union movement to say something unequivocally that you know </p>
<p>they're rnot going to like. I did that. Thirdly, it is not easy<br />
to tell both the community and the States that they are going to<br />
have some hard decisions forced upon them in the Budget and in<br />
the Premier's Conference. Now I've said that, unequivocally.<br />
CARLETON: When you spoke of the important area of changing<br />
community perceptions and community attitudes, was that just<br />
political ease for telling the Australian community that<br />
overseas, where countries are prosperous, is because people work<br />
and work hard. Here we are taking-. the easy way out, virtually<br />
all the time?<br />
PM: I put it in greater detail. I think there has been some<br />
real substance generationally in the proposition about the lucky<br />
country. We've had a longer term terms of trade problem. They<br />
have been going against us over a long period, gradually. But<br />
every now and then something crops up a mineral boom or<br />
something like that which gets out of the problem, which has<br />
meant that successive governments haven't addressed themselves to<br />
this longer term problem. What I'm saying is that we can't any,<br />
longer assume that something is going to happen which will get us<br />
out of this fundamental problem. That means that we have to, I<br />
believe, have increased standards of effort. We've certainly got<br />
to broaden and deepen our export base and that's going to require<br />
not just economic decisions, it does require an attitudinal<br />
change. Also, in terms of attitude, I think we've got to<br />
recognise as Australians that as part of the process of helping<br />
ourselves we should be buying Australian more than we do. So all<br />
these things are what I'm trying to convey to the Australian<br />
people and I believe they'll respond.<br />
CARLETON: The 2.3 per cent increase that the Arbitration<br />
Commission is expected to grant shortly, is there the slightest<br />
doubt that that is totally affordable?<br />
PM: Well it would be, on my judgment should be, the only<br />
national wage increase in 1986 and that would be significantly<br />
below the movement in crisis. I think it appropriate that should<br />
happen. CARLETON: And totally affordable, Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: Well you can't have a situation and I don't think the<br />
business community is arguing a position where you-have no<br />
movement in wages and no sustaining of some capacity to purchase<br />
goods and services. I don't think anyone is saying that. But<br />
what we all are saying, and I'm certainly saying unequivocally,<br />
we can't have a level of wage increases that might have<br />
previously been anticipated. There has got to be a reduction in<br />
standards in this community. As wage and salary earners<br />
constitute the largest part of our national income and<br />
expenditure, it has got to happen there.<br />
CARLETON: And the 2.3 per cent we are about to get, is that<br />
affordable? PM: In the total circumstances yes, provided it is the only<br />
national wage increase this year, and, as I say, that there is<br />
further discounting next time. </p>
<p>WALSH: Prime Minister, you expressed the hope that we had<br />
reached a nadir in the drop in the terms of trade but aren't you<br />
being a little heroic in putting that forward?<br />
PM: Well there may be some further decline. I don't think we<br />
can sensibly expect a continuation of a catastrophic decline. I<br />
say that if you look back over a longer period, you know Max that<br />
there has been in annual terms, depending on your starting point,<br />
you could say 0.4 per cent over a period, it might be up to 1 per<br />
cent gradual decline. What we've been hit with is this massive<br />
decline of 14 per cent in the most recent period and something<br />
like 9 per cent since the June quarter of last year. Now I think<br />
that sort of thing has come to an end. The great pity I think,<br />
as you know Max, the J curve is working in volume terms. We've<br />
got a 14 per cent increase in exports in the last 12 months. In<br />
the last period the volume of imports is coming down, but we've<br />
been kicked in the bottom by this massive turn around in the<br />
terms of trade. What I'm saying is with the J curve working in<br />
volume terms I don't think we're going to have a continuation of<br />
this massive decline. I think that is part of the reason why, as<br />
again you'd agree, we've got to try and broaden our export base<br />
so that we're not so significantly dependent upon agricultural<br />
and mineral exports. The sort of things, in a sense, the<br />
Canadians have done. You know that they have significantly<br />
reduced their reliance on agricultural and mineral products as a<br />
proportion of their total exports. Now it has been easier for<br />
them in one sense because of their continuity with the United<br />
States. We've just got to work on it. We can do it as you<br />
appreciate.<br />
WALSH: When I put that question to you I was thinking about our<br />
major trading partner. Our major customer, Japan, is facing a<br />
very much reduced rate of growth this year, especially in the<br />
export sector and we've already seen cuts in our iron ore prices<br />
in dollar terms, Australian dollar terms, and we are threatened<br />
with steaming coal price cuts. That couldn't be a very happy<br />
prospect. That will serve to further undermine the terms of<br />
trade.<br />
PM: Max as I said in my answer to the previous question, I'm not<br />
saying that the historic, gradual adverse movement in our terms<br />
of trade has come to an end. I think we're not facing a<br />
continuation of a catastrophic drop. The trend term is there<br />
that is why we've got to change our structure, the structure of<br />
our economy, so that the composition of our exports is not then<br />
so vulnerable to the tendency that you rightly referred to by<br />
giving an example. That's a basic part of what the message of<br />
the Government is about. We can't just simply sit back and say<br />
we're going to have something like 40 per cent of our exports<br />
being rural products and our other significant proportion being<br />
mineral products. We've got to bring a situation where our<br />
exports of manufactured goods and of services increases<br />
absolutely and as a proportion. If we do that we will change the<br />
context within which we've had historically a gradual diminution<br />
against us in the terms of trade. </p>
<p>4<br />
WALSH: But the last time we had a catastrophic fallout in the<br />
terms of trade was in 1929 and I hasten to say that was in the<br />
order of 40 per cent as distinct from the 14 or 16 per cent<br />
you're talking about now. But it coincided with a build up<br />
before hand of large overseas indebtedness, especially by<br />
Australian governments. I was surprised in the. course of your<br />
statement today, and in the supplementary material, very little<br />
attention was paid to this area of indebtedness. Doesn't this<br />
concern you?<br />
PM: We do go to it. We' ve got to bring down our borrowings. As<br />
you also know, not just our borrowings, but also associated with<br />
it, we've got to bring down our public debt interest commitment<br />
which forms such a large part of our budget outlays. Now we go<br />
to that. I can assure you that part of what we're about in our<br />
Budget process, and what we will be about with the States, is to<br />
reduce our own outlays and the growth of outlays, and to reduce<br />
the public sector borrowing requirement because we've got to<br />
reduce that indebtedness.<br />
WALSH: But you'd have to reduce it, I'd suggest, quite<br />
significantly. It seems to me that your references to next<br />
Friday's Premiers' Conference were not your<br />
outlook. PM: Well I don't know what more I could have said max. I said<br />
there were going to be some hard decisions. I can tell you now<br />
there will be.<br />
WALSH: It will be a black Friday for the Premiers?<br />
PM: I don't think they'll be leaving Canberra on Friday clapping<br />
and cheering. But I notice that Sir Joh said tonight that this<br />
massive spending, there's got to be reductions in massive<br />
spending. So I'm hoping he's going to be coming to the Premiers'<br />
Conference consistently with that and joining with us in<br />
accepting the need for further Government restraint.<br />
WALSH: I can't press you too far in this Premiers area because<br />
obviously you've got to negotiate, but are you concerned about<br />
their very large cash balance at the moment. They can actually<br />
reduce their borrowing and still sustain the present level of<br />
buying? PM: Well let me put it to you Max without exposing our hand<br />
entirely. We will be observing that they do have capacities<br />
within their accumulated situation to which you refer to sustain<br />
activities in the face of the reductions from the Commonwealth<br />
and in their borrowing programs that we're going to be talking<br />
about.<br />
WALSH: Now of course on this occasion it hasn't only been the<br />
public sector which has engaged in massive overseas borrowing.<br />
In fact it is the private sector that has set the pace.<br />
Seemingly a great deal of this investment has gone into what<br />
would be described as non productive activity of paper shuffling<br />
on the stock exchange, of takeovers and such like. Does that<br />
cause you concern? </p>
<p>PM: Obviously Max you couldn't be watching what is happening in<br />
the Australian business community over the most recent period and<br />
not have some concern. Let me say two things about it. Firstly,<br />
as you know, we've commissioned a paper from Paul, Paul Keating,<br />
that is a very large paper which is now being analysed and<br />
discussed within the Government, within the processes of<br />
Government. Let me also say this which I think is very<br />
significant, I've had a large number of representations to me<br />
from the business community-,-significant sectors of the business<br />
community, who are expressing concern about the increased<br />
dimension of activity in the area that you're talking about. So<br />
in our consideration of Paul's paper we will also be taking into<br />
account what the business community itself is saying to us.<br />
WALSH: Do you also feel that this takeover activity is leading<br />
to a greater concentration of economic power?<br />
PM: Obviously it can. There are two aspects that one has to<br />
have towards this. One I think can't take any joy in takeovers<br />
for the sake of simply of capital profits and capital<br />
appreciation by those seeking to acquire. Having said that and I<br />
think there should be a proper concern about that, it is also<br />
true Max, that some existing companies ought to be taken over.<br />
There is one I had very much in mind, and I think without too<br />
much you know the one I mean, that hasn't really grasped the<br />
opportunities. Let me say I'm not talking about BHP in case<br />
people say is he saying that one. It is another one. Now I<br />
think in fact that some processes of takeovers in regard to a<br />
particular company may well mean that that company may become<br />
much more expansionary in an important area of activity which<br />
lends itself to greater exports. I'm saying that where a company<br />
hasn't been doing all that it could and a new management, new<br />
ownership, can become more dynamic or expansionary, grasp export<br />
opportunities, it is in the community interest that should<br />
happen. what I think you're worried about, and I share your<br />
concern, that takeovers simply for the sake of accretion of<br />
wealth to particular individuals and with no other concern<br />
involved is something that we ought to be worried about.<br />
WALSH: My concern is, if I can personalise it, is that a lot of<br />
the takeover activity and the capital inflow is in fact what I<br />
call tax driven. You have a tax system which encourages this<br />
activity rather than giving an even playing field in the<br />
corporate sector.<br />
PM: I'm a very, very careful reader of all that you right.<br />
Every time Walsh puts pen to paper up in the Lodge there is a<br />
fella reading it. So I know what you're saying about that. I<br />
simply say that the Treasurer has prepared a paper on this issue.<br />
We're looking at it and as I say, we'll look at it. Certainly<br />
also in the context there is a very wide range of representations<br />
I've had to me from senior figures in the Australian business<br />
community saying has what has been happening gone too far?<br />
WALSH: Right I'll just change the subject entirely to the point<br />
Mr Howard raised in his response to your statement today. He<br />
said you hadn't addressed the biggest single problem facing the<br />
community the rate of Australia's inflation as compared with<br />
our trading partners? </p>
<p>PM: Mr Howard?<br />
WALSH: Well inflation rather than Mr Howard.<br />
PM: Let's first of all dismiss his credentials and credibility.<br />
What Mr Howard, the last Treasurer, handed over to Hawke and<br />
Keating was an inflation rate of 11 per cent. Now we've brought<br />
that down because we've had sensible policies. Before we got hit<br />
by this massive depreciation, which is a_ 3-0_ per cent depreciation<br />
from the beginning of 1985, we've brought the Australian<br />
inflation rate down to 5 per cent, which was tagging along there<br />
close to the level of our trading partners. The depreciation<br />
that has taken place has boosted the inflation rate, as you know<br />
why, obviously import prices go up. We are now on a downward<br />
path on inflation. If the things that I'm saying should happen,<br />
further discounting in wages, and we exercise a restraint by the<br />
whole community, we'll have our inflation rate tracking down<br />
again towards that of our major overseas partners.<br />
WALSH: But our major overseas partners, I mean at the moment we<br />
are actually talking about rates of inflation of 1 and 2 per<br />
cent? PM: Yes some of them. Some of them even zero.<br />
WALSH: Will we see zero inflation in Hawke's time?<br />
PM: I'd love to be able to think that we could, but what I think<br />
is the honest and realistic thing to say is remind the Australian<br />
community that the Hawke Government from 11 per cent brought<br />
Australia's inflation rate down to 5 per cent. Close to our<br />
overseas partners. We then got hit by this massive depreciation.<br />
We are coping with that. If the community, business, trade<br />
unions and the rest of us go along with, and co-operate with,<br />
what I'm saying we'll start again to get back to our ove: seas<br />
partners rate.<br />
WALSH: Prime Minister, just before letting you go, the reference<br />
in your speech, the $ 1 billion saving you've detected in the<br />
Budget, does that refer to the $ 1.4 billion figure which was<br />
leaked to the Sydney Morning Herald which was seen as the target?<br />
PM: What I'm saying is that is what we've identified so far.<br />
We've got further to go in the process.<br />
WALSH: So it is still $ 400,000 to go?<br />
PM: Yes. I'm confident Max, that we're going to get up to the<br />
target we're talking about.<br />
WALSH: Are you prepared to talk about a target to growth in the<br />
public service?<br />
PM: What I'm about, and I'm absolutely committed to this, is<br />
reversing the trend. Under successive governments, I've got a<br />
figure here, under the last year of our predecessors it was<br />
higher than any year we've got. In 1982/ 83, the year before we </p>
<p>came in, there was a 5.5 per cent increase, the last year of Mr<br />
Howard, 5.5 per cent. It has come down progressively under us<br />
4.3, 2.4, estimated 1.7 per cent this year. Now we are going to<br />
do more about this. It just has happened that people say you<br />
have new programs, you've got to have more bodies and so on. We<br />
will be moving to ensure that this inextricable growth comes to<br />
an end. And I say that not as a public servant basher. We need<br />
a great public service in this country. But as I say an<br />
increasingly efficient public service doesn't mean an<br />
increasingly large one.<br />
WALSH: Are you looking for zero growth or negative growth?<br />
PM: Well I would like to get towards zero growth.<br />
WALSH: In what time frame?<br />
PM: As I said in the speech, because of the entrenched<br />
practices, and when I talk about practices you know what I mean<br />
by that what's involved in getting rid of people and so on, and<br />
appeal mechanisms and all that sort of thing it is not<br />
something that can be dramatically done overnight. I give you my<br />
unqualified commitment that we are going to take a series of<br />
steps which means Australia is going to see an end to this<br />
inextricable growth. I'd like to get down to a zero position in<br />
the foreseeable future.<br />
WALSH: Prime Minister, thanks very much.<br />
ends I </p>
