PROGRAMME, " THIS WEEK"<br />
TV INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINSTER,<br />
MR JOHN GORTON<br />
Interviewer John Boland<br />
Recorded on Friday, 17 July for screenin on Sunday, 19 July<br />
Q. Prime Minister, what were your overall imjressions of your tour of<br />
Papua/ New Guinea?<br />
PM: I think the deepest imprescion 1, ne gets is of the great difficulty in advancing<br />
a country such as the Territory to full self-governmet. This is because<br />
there are different races, different languages, different levels of development in<br />
different regions, different aspirations in different regions and whatever one does<br />
would be interpreted by some regions as going too fast towards self-government and<br />
in other regions as going too slow. And there are jealousies between the various<br />
regions as well. This makes it an extremely difficult exercise. It is one that<br />
has got to be carried out gradually but with some regard for the wishes of all<br />
the region and for the different levels of development in them and for the growing<br />
what shall I say? elite as distinct from those who have not yet had full<br />
chances of education.<br />
Q. I would like to be a little more specific on some of those particular<br />
divisions which you have spoken of. One of the immediate impressions one gets<br />
here in Australia is how long can Australia continue as a colonial power in<br />
New Guinea?<br />
PM: Well, first of all I reject the concept of Australia being a colonial power.<br />
I don't believe she is a colonial power, but we can -ut that to one side for the<br />
moment. And the only answer I can give you is the answer I gave in New Guinea,<br />
and that is that we shculd continue theTe as long as most o the people want us<br />
to continue there and feel they want our help and they want our skills. As an<br />
illustration of that I don't know of any section up there, for example, that<br />
doesn't want to try and ensure that Australian administrators and technical<br />
officers and agricultural officers and surveyors and key people will stay and help<br />
even after self-government comes. So the only answer I can give you is I<br />
believe we should stay there as long as we are wanted to stay there and no longer.<br />
Q. Now do you think that say, the more advanced people on the coastal<br />
fringes.... how long can they wait until the people from the highlands catch up<br />
with them? </p>
<p>PM: I would say that you have -put your finger on the difficulty which I pointed<br />
out at the beginning of this interview. It is a matter surely for arrangement up<br />
there. It is not for the Australian Government, I think, to say " You have got to<br />
wait this long" or haven't got to wait that long, and indeed even in the coastal<br />
areas, there is by no means a unanimity as to what stage they vould like the<br />
Australians to go. The Pangu Party, for example, is keen on very quick selfgovernment,<br />
but the Pangu Party, as far as one can judge, has not got a very large<br />
following. In the highlands, I believe, opinion is unanimous against any early<br />
self-government, and the highlands have the majority of the population of the<br />
Territory of Papua/ New Guinea.<br />
Q. Have you got a sort of twenty-year vacuum here, though, between say, the<br />
Tolais who we seem to feel are more educated than the remainder of the indigenous<br />
people of New Guinea.... now is there a sort of a twenty-year vacuum here where<br />
they have had the advantages of say the Germans when they occupied New Guinea,<br />
and then the Australian Administration since it has been their area to look after,<br />
and the highlands people where there hasn't been a lot of penetration from the<br />
white man, have had this sort of twienty-year period: that they have to catch<br />
ulp?<br />
PM: Oh, it is more than twenty years in that sense in that the coastal areas<br />
have been subject to European influence for, what, seventy or eighty years, and<br />
the highlands for say, twenty, but on the other hand, that doesn't mean that the<br />
highland people can't catch up quite quickly. And, indeed, I believe they are<br />
catching up quite quickly through the povision of primary schools and secondary<br />
schools and technical training, teacher training colleges at Goroka and things of<br />
that kind. But they are still..., they believe they still need Australian participation<br />
and they need Australian ministrat ion. Now, so do a lot of the coastal people,<br />
so do the people around the Sepik and so do, I believe, a lot of the coastal Papuans.<br />
But around Moresby and say \ Uewja] or Madang, there are groups of people vh o<br />
are more eager to move more quickl~ y. And it is a m atter of th, 3 most delicate<br />
balance to try and see that one doesn't go too quiclkly and one doesn't go too<br />
slowly, but that all the time one seeks to leave it finally, at any time, to the<br />
decision of the people generally. Now it is not eas'y to decide how to arrive at<br />
that decision. People have said to me, " Well will you come out in favour * of a<br />
referendum?" I wouldn't be prepared to come out in favour for or against a<br />
referendum on thait at this time, because that is a possible way of arriving at<br />
what they want to do. So is sitting down and arriving at a consensus of opinion<br />
by discussion.... that I s, all areas, perhaps through thellHouse of Assembly.<br />
So are expressions of views of the House of Assembly. There are a variety of<br />
ways in which I feel this feeling could be discovered. I ana not prepared to come<br />
out now and say this is the way in which it will be done.<br />
Q. I gather from your visit, now that you have seen it and you have had a<br />
pretty good look at it, that one again had to gather the impression that perhaps<br />
you went there to what have a loolk at the problems which perhaps had been<br />
created with the white planters through Mr. Whitlam's visit. Now mould this<br />
be a fairly reasonable assessment? ./ 3 </p>
<p>PM: No, I went there because since, well February or before,......<br />
Q. And what he said, incidentally, and what Mr. Whitlam said, if I car add<br />
thct to<br />
PM: Yes, but you asked me why I went there?<br />
Q. Yes, fair enough.<br />
PM: I went there because we had been conducting discussions with the<br />
Admiistrator's Executive Council and with the Constitutio:. al Review Committee<br />
on the next steps towards self-government, on trying to ensure that less had to be<br />
referred back to Canberra, on trying to ensure that the Australian administrative<br />
officers of whom I spoke would stay there and be given some security of tei ure<br />
nov, all these matters which they had raised with us. And I went there to<br />
announce, as a result of these discussions, very large steps towards selfgovernment,<br />
a great deal more powver of administration an-d decision being handed<br />
over to the Administrator's Executive Council and to the House of Assemnbly.<br />
Q. Do you tend to echo the sentiments of the white planters and were you<br />
worried about what Mr. Whitlam said, and they are reported to have been very<br />
concerned?<br />
PM: I think Mr. Whitlam caused a great deal of uncertainty in the whole area.<br />
I think he upset large numbers of people by putting a firm date on when Australia<br />
would get out whether the people wanted it or not. I wvould:-' t by any means say<br />
this was confined to the white planters, because it was quite evident it was an<br />
uncertainty and discomfort and fear felt by the highlanders and by many of the<br />
coastal people as well. But that is not the reason why I went there.<br />
Q. Now that you have seen it, and had a pretty good look at it, could Papua/<br />
New Guinea be self-governing by 1972? This is what Mr. Vhitlam said. Now, I<br />
don't want to go into imponderables here, but if for instance, you lost the Senate<br />
election and next year there was a douhle dissolution and LMr. Whitlam became the<br />
Prime Minister, he would have a pretty difficult job in froit of him with about<br />
twelve months up his sleeve to give Papua / New Guinea selU-government, but<br />
from where you sic now, do you see any feasibility of them governing themselves<br />
by 1972?<br />
PM: I imagine any area can be self-governing if the people who have the<br />
responsibility to help it and to advance it move out and say, " Well you are on<br />
your own", well, presumably, it has to be self-governing. But I think the things<br />
that could flow from that action would be quite dangerous. I think it not putting<br />
it too high to say that if one were not careful, something even like a Biafran<br />
situation could develop if we just moved out and said, " Right you are on your<br />
own. We wash our hands of you." 1 believe it possible. / 4 </p>
<p>Q. This is very interesting because actually you have niot really set a date<br />
at all. And this is very difficult to try and pin you down oit. Mr. Whitlam says,<br />
" Right, 1972". You don't say the mid-seventies. You do-i-t say the early<br />
eighties. Have you got, though, at the back of your mind, Come idea of when<br />
they could govern themselves?<br />
PM: No, because I think the prerequisite for when they could govern themselves<br />
is a general wish in all the regions that they should from ti-at time govern themselves,<br />
and I think as soon as they reach that point, then they should govern<br />
themselves, with, of course, continuing Australian assistance in the administration<br />
and c-her matters.<br />
Q. Ycu don't see this in a matter of years, though, or time at all, keeping<br />
in mind this<br />
PM: I'm sorry, I just think it quite impossible with any responsibility to say a<br />
particular date. It can't be too long delayed. I don't myself think it will be too<br />
long delayed, because I think1 the situation will arise, certainly not by 1972 and<br />
certainly not by 1973 or 4. 1 am inot going to put on any data at all. All I am<br />
going to say is I believe a situatio-n will eventually arise whiien the people generally<br />
there will say, now, we would likce to have self -government, and then they should<br />
have it.<br />
Q. The way you speak there, it sounds very much as thaough you see that<br />
though as a possibility in the seveInties, in this decade?<br />
PM: I see it as a possibility at some stage. In fact, I do-n't see it as a<br />
possibility at some stage, I see it as a certainty at some s-tage.<br />
Q. In the seventies?<br />
PM: A cextainty at some stage. I am sorry, you are not going to pin n-e down<br />
to any date.<br />
Q. No, well, why I put this to you is it has been suggestd.. all-right, you<br />
haven't really got anything in mind for the early eighties, you haven't really got<br />
anything in mind for the seventies. Mr. Whitlam has come out and said 1972.<br />
Now, we can be critical of him for saying that, but also, can we not be critical<br />
of you for saying, " Well, I don't it will be at some stage?"<br />
PM: Yes you can, if you wish to, but I can only repeat ' rfiat I said to the people<br />
up there, that I think it is highly wrong for the Australianls to say, " You will have<br />
self-government in 1972 or 1973 or 1974 or any date, and we will decide when<br />
you are going to do it, and you will have it whether you wan-t it or not". I think it<br />
is much better to say: " You will have it as soon as you wan.-t it". </p>
<p>Q. When you arrived at Rabaul, and you had these 13, 030 Tolais of the<br />
Mataungan Association there chewing betel nuts and drinking hot beer in a sort<br />
of an angry mood, were you surprised? Were you surprised to see this sort of<br />
a reaction?<br />
PM: Oh, no, naz. a bit because for quite a long time the leaders of the Mataungan<br />
movement had made it clear that they were going to stretch every nerve to get as<br />
many of their supporters in there as they could and put on this kind of reception.<br />
I expected it.<br />
Q. Are you concerned about the Mataungan Association? How so you see them<br />
as an organisation?<br />
PM: Well it is very difficult to say. I think that they have now reached a stage<br />
where their leaders at any rate are adopting the attitude " We are not interested<br />
in any laws of any kind. We, in fact, are the Government. We are going to do<br />
what we want about everything. I think that their illegal movement into land is<br />
dangerous. I think that the tactics they have adopted of beating up those Tolai<br />
who disagree with them is also dangerous......<br />
Q. You have pretty good evidence of that?<br />
PM: Oh yes. And I don't believe they are genuinely interested in settlements of<br />
what they claim to be grievances. Now, I say that for this reason. Long ago,<br />
months and months ago when the question of the Multi -Racial Council came up,<br />
I spoke, in Canberra, to Mr. Kaputin, who is one of their leaders, and I said to<br />
him then that if the Mataungans felt it was reasonable we could have a referendum<br />
to see whether most of the Tolai on the Gazelle Peninsula wished a Multi-Racial<br />
Council or not, but he refused to have one. He refused to have a secret<br />
referendum. Hie again refused, when I was up there this time. And before I<br />
went there this time, I asked that the Mataungan members should sit down and<br />
discuss their worries. If they had land problems, they could discuss those.<br />
If they had any problems of any kind, let us sit down and talk about them. And<br />
they flatly refused to have any discussions whatsoever, any talks whatsoever.<br />
So I don't really think they are interested in s ettling disputes so much as creating<br />
t hem.<br />
Q. I noticed you earlier referred to some of the things that perhaps could<br />
be learned or perhaps could occur in New Guinea as had happened in some of the<br />
emerging African nations, but do you feel that we have learned something from<br />
the problems of the emerging African nations in dealing with New Guinea? </p>
<p>PM: I don't think the problems are the same myself. L. spite of there being<br />
some land difficulties, the Administration has in fact over the years taken great<br />
care to try and ensure that the land remained in the ownership of the local people.<br />
It has been one of the difficulties in fact of development that it has been very hard<br />
to discover who did own land which was required for actual civic development as<br />
distinct from private development. I think there is one problem it is not<br />
the problem of advancing towards political self-government because that is<br />
happening. It is not the problem of finding more and more local civil servants<br />
because that is happening. It is not the problem of handing over internal<br />
administration in greater degrees and so on, because that is happening. But<br />
I thir.:; there is a difficulty of more indigenous participation in businesses... garages<br />
and businesses generally, This is something which I believe must be fostered.<br />
It is being specifically fostered at Bougainville, fcr example...<br />
Q. That corporation....<br />
PM: Yes, and in the development of the Arawa township, for example by the<br />
Administration itself. Certain businesses are going to be financed by the<br />
Development Bank for the indigenous people, if they have got any hope at all of<br />
making a go of it. In other instances, we are going to seek 49 per cent at<br />
least equity for the indigenous people, hut in other areas..... Moresby has sort<br />
of grown up, rather.<br />
Q. I would like to get down time is pressing with us one or<br />
two other areas. I think last financial year, or the financial year just ending,<br />
the Australian taxpayer gave New Guinea a grant of $ 96 million which,<br />
incidentally, is 58 per cent of the Territory's total receipts. Now this must<br />
increase as everything goes up. It never goes down these days. Now are<br />
Australians happy being a colonial power at this price, do you believe?<br />
PM: I don't think they are a colonial power.<br />
Q. You don't like that word. I've used it twice now....<br />
PM: I don't think this is a colony. A colony is an area of land... well it<br />
always has been in my book.... an area of land which has been taken over and run<br />
for the benefit of some colonising power, and I don't believe this is happening at<br />
all. But we gave $ 96 million as a grant, part of it was for recurrent running<br />
expenses and part of it for development. You say this must increase. I sought<br />
to make it clear when I was up in the Territory that as political responsibility<br />
is assumed by the people in the Territory themselves, so they must assume<br />
more responsibility for raising their own revenue, And indeed what we propose<br />
is that there should be two grants made by Australia, one for adding to the<br />
revenue raised in the Territory for recurrent expenses of government and that<br />
will be under the control of the Administrator's Executive Council. That will / 7 </p>
<p>be allocated and spent by them which is a big step -forward. But I would expect that<br />
the grant from Australia over the years ahead I am riot talking about next year<br />
in that component would reduce and the amount raised from the Territory would<br />
increase. The second grant we would make would be for general development<br />
purposes. That would be made under the control of Australia and as years go<br />
by, as the Territory becomes more viable economically, as it gets a good<br />
economic base, that too should be able to be reduced at some stage.<br />
Q, I wonder if I could ask you these questions quickly, and get rather quick<br />
answers from you without destroying them. How powerful do you believe<br />
Mr. -iaputin of the Mataungan As sociationi to be?<br />
PM: I think he has got quite a lot of power over about half the Tolal people and<br />
nowhere else?<br />
Q. What do you think of his New Guinea Development Corporation?<br />
PM.: From what I know of it, if it is as is described, wiell, fine let him go<br />
ahead and do it. Nobody is stopping him, anyway.<br />
Q. The Multi-Racial Council, what is its future in the light of the<br />
Mataungan opposition?<br />
PM: It depends on whether most of the people in the area want to have a<br />
Multi-Racial Council or not. We have sought to find that out. If most of them<br />
don't, then there is nothing saying...<br />
Q. They could win, you know they could win....<br />
PM: Well, fiA* ne. I mean~, what does that matter? That at least settles the<br />
question of what most people want. And hen you have an all native council.<br />
It is very nearly an all-Tolai Council now. Very nearly. 1 have forgotten the<br />
numbers. But there is only a very small fraction of European and Chinese on it.<br />
Q. Turning now to the home front, Prime Minister, we have heard murmurings<br />
in recent weeks about inflation, overheated economy and so on from the Federal<br />
Treasurer, Mr. Bury. Now, how do you view the economy at the moment?<br />
PM: I think the best thing I can do is to refer you to the last Treasury White<br />
Paper which came out a short time ago which pointed out that actions taken by the<br />
Government in its last Budget had reduced the prezssures on the labour market<br />
and on the demand in the economy for the last two or three months of this<br />
financial year and had damped downr what had previously been described as an<br />
overheating economy. And this pap,, er also points out there are prospects for<br />
very great growth in this coming finiancial year but that we need to be careful<br />
to ensure that we don't allow demand to become so great that it would be followed<br />
by inflation. </p>
<p>Q. Well, now this is interesti-ng because you have been under some pressure<br />
from the Federal Liberal Council and also from your State bodies to fulfil this<br />
promise of yours during the elections for taxation relief -for middle and lower<br />
income earners. Ncw do you see this as being a very real thing in the near<br />
future?<br />
PM: I see it as being a part of the Budget which I don't discuss before the<br />
Budget comes out.<br />
Q. I realise that and I don't intend to frame it in that context....<br />
PM: But you can't frame it in any other context.<br />
Q. You think you have got me on this one at this particular stage?<br />
PM: No, I don't but I have just constantly refused to discuss what might be in<br />
the Budget.<br />
Q. But you do agree that there has been a little bit of pressure on you from<br />
your own Party bodies to look at this promise and that you are conscious of it?<br />
PM: I think that I would sooner discuss this whole matter with you perhaps<br />
on August 19.'<br />
Thank you very much Prime Minister. </p>
