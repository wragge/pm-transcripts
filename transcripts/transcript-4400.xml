iMME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 17. PAY -1-9.77<br />
The Qaeensland Premier, Fir. Bjelke-Petersen, and the D) eputy<br />
Premier, Mr. K~ nox.. are gravely isleadixig the people bf Queeasland.<br />
In October last year at Hoba3rt, Mr. Petersen, ! 4r. Fraw~ ley, Mr. Hewit<br />
Mr. Knox,, Mr. Lickiss, Mr. Neal, Mr. Porter and M. r. Row, fill. frmi<br />
Queensland, all voted for tiie simultaneous eledtion propbsal.-<br />
They xroted to make sure that it would be a State Govern~ or and not<br />
the Governor General who wo-ald isfsue the writs, for elections for<br />
the Senate.<br />
Are we to ass~ c, that; these Queensland Memnbers were so bemused by<br />
the. caso-when they were in Ylobart, that. they forgot their great<br />
State of Queensland? Vhat made them change . their Mxinds aft-er, that<br />
Constitutional Convention? The prop osal is the same.* The principlE<br />
is the same. They supported it then, to a man, for the proposal'<br />
was carried without dis. sent.<br />
Queenslanders should demand of them an~ explanation of their changeof<br />
heart. Hlow do they say that the principle~ s that they supported<br />
iLn Bobart are now wrong.<br />
Let uis look at the questions'.<br />
That elections for the House of Representatives and<br />
the Senate should take place at Ithe same time.<br />
This is a matter of simple common sense.' W ho wants<br />
as many as four elections ovr the next four yea'rs?<br />
That if a vacancy occurs in the Senate thxouigh death or<br />
retirerment, the nominated replacement sho-uld be of the<br />
samne political. party and should serve out the full term<br />
of the Senator-who he is replacing.<br />
This is.-plain kustralian faiimess. Replacing a National<br />
Party Senator1 by another National Party Member, a Liberal<br />
Senator by a Liberal and a Labor Senator by a Labor,,<br />
preserves your decision at the Senate election-.<br />
3. That electors in the Northern. Te. ritory arid the Capital<br />
Territory should be able to vote in. referendums like<br />
other Australians.<br />
it is fair and~ just that people in the Northern Territory<br />
and Australian Capital Territory no longver be seuondclagjs<br />
citizens. </p>
<p>A referendum is-in two aIr ts. To be carried it<br />
requires a majority of voters throughout Australia.<br />
It also Will) still require a pajority in at least<br />
four states. kTue( votes of the Territory residents<br />
would not be counted inj that second part; and the<br />
rights of the States till be protected.<br />
4. That High Court Judges-should retire at the age of<br />
and that a retirin~ i! e '~ obe set for other Federal<br />
audges./<br />
* We think it only f ir -thfat after the age of<br />
they should pass t ejob' on to younger people.<br />
How could set-Ling a. retiring age for judges be<br />
a threat to. Queensland-? The State already has a<br />
retiring age for o ' tte Judges.<br />
These proposals axe fairj r~ asonable and just. I believe the<br />
electors of Queensland will see through the caifpaign of deception<br />
being mounted against the referendum proposals.<br />
They are a contmon-sente approach to constitutional reform based on<br />
a broad consensus of agreement. Upholders of State rights should<br />
have nio -complaint about the Constitutional Convention because<br />
the States bad 72 votes, while there were only 16 for the 1ederal<br />
Parliament. Nobody could 94y that Federal Parliament stacked that<br />
meeting. The States had absolute control of that Convention.<br />
Again, let me repeat, the Premier of this State supported the<br />
proposal for simultaneous elections. Ask him: why Mr. Petersen<br />
have you changed your mind?<br />
The campaign in Queensland is a hangover from the past. All<br />
QueerislanderB, uind indeed all Australians, owe bMr. Bjelke-Petersen<br />
great deal of thanks for the way he battled against a wrotched<br />
socialist Government the Witlam Government. He was redoubtable<br />
in Ithat-. He mounted hiis charger to do battle with Canberra, and a<br />
great many Australians applauded him for it. But Canberra has<br />
changed. Doug Anthony and Malcolm Fraser are riot the same as<br />
Mr. Whitlam. But we still have Mr, ' Petersen on his horse still<br />
tilting at windmills. It is time lie gave it up.<br />
The referendums do not detract from the power and authority of the-<br />
States House. The Senate's authority will -be enhanced. The Prime<br />
biinister will rno longer be able to manipulate political power by<br />
manipulating Members of the Senate. The choice of the people of<br />
Queensland'will be protected, and nothing will be able to upset<br />
your vote the people's vote so far as the Senate is concerned.<br />
The charge that the Senate could be made to disappear is hysterical.<br />
Without the Senate, there is no Governmmat. Noth-ing can become law<br />
unless it passes -the Representatives and the Senate. The proposed<br />
referendum says that the writs for -the Senate election shall be<br />
issued. They have to be issued. The highest legal advisers in the<br />
land say so.<br />
A Yes vote will increase the influence of the less populated States,<br />
beause when the Senate and the Reprel entatives elections are held<br />
at the same time, political leaders must canvas all States and have<br />
/ policies </p>
<p>-3-<br />
policies appropriate to all States. Policies and issues at<br />
Nouse of Represntativpie eiectiors held alone could even be<br />
confined to Melbourne andSydney alone.<br />
Mr. Petersen has said the referendum costing money, and should<br />
not be held. Re never said HHothbhaer t Constitutional<br />
Convention, where none of t Njeletes mentioned money. They<br />
knew a referendum would cos miroii). y, but the cost would be nothing<br />
like as much as having separate eletions for the House of<br />
Representatives and theSente-year after year. Millions and<br />
millions of dollars will be saved in all future years once this<br />
vote is carried.<br />
Mr. Bjelke-Petersen should. a ia proper target. He will be<br />
fighting the ALP and its'Staf-leadelr Mr. Burns in a few monthis.<br />
