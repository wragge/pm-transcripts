<p>We have today lost a great Australian voice in the efforts towards reconciliation.</p>
<p>We have lost a uniquely talented musician, a passionate advocate for Aboriginal people and a truly great friend.A former Australian of the Year, his music set out challenges for us all in the road to reconciliation.He will be remembered for his tremendous musical achievements, including being added to the ARIA Hall of Fame last year as the lead singer of Yothu Yindi.He will also be remembered as a great educational leader and a champion for the Yolngu people in East Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory.He leaves a great body of work to inspire us and we will need all of that inspiration, for so much work remains undone.</p>
