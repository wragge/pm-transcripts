PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 4 DECEMBER 1987<br />
The Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, the Rt Hon Paias<br />
Wingti, will be making his first official visit to Australia<br />
from 8 to 14 December 1987.<br />
During his stay in Australia Mr Wingti will visit Canberra,<br />
Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. His program will include<br />
discussions with me, other senior Ministers, and the Joint<br />
Parliamentary Commmitee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and<br />
Trade and he will call on the Governor-General.<br />
During Mr Wingti's visit to Canberra he and I will sign the<br />
Joint Declaration of Principles to guide relations between<br />
Australia and PNG.<br />
I very much welcome the first official visit to Australia by<br />
the Prime Minister of Australia's closest neighbour.<br />
Australia and Papua New Guinea have a relationship based on<br />
a strong and enduring friendship, which is underlined by Mr<br />
Wingti's visit and the signing of the Joint Declaration of<br />
Principles. 0 </p>
