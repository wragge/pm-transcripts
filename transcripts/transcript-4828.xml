JAUSTfAGUIDXELINES<br />
TO APPLY TO APPEARANCES BY PUBLIC<br />
SERVANTS AND OFFICERS OF STATUTORY AUTHORITIES<br />
BEFORE PARTY CO DIITTEES<br />
1. Ministers may authorise officers of their departments,<br />
or of statutory authorities for which they are responsible,<br />
to appear before Government and Opposition Party Committees<br />
to provide briefings or background material on Government<br />
or Ministerial decisions and proposals, including details<br />
and/ or explanations of proposed legislation.<br />
2. Briefing of this nature will be authorised on the<br />
principle of promoting the freest possible flow of factual<br />
and background material to permit informed consideration by<br />
the committees and parties concerned of the issues involved,<br />
consistent with preserving the necessary confidences of<br />
Government and maintaining the traditional political<br />
impartiality of officials.<br />
3. Committee requests for briefing in the above terms<br />
will be directed to the Minister concerned. If he agrees,<br />
the Minister will authorise the department or authority to<br />
put the necessary arrangements in hand. It will also be<br />
open for a Minister himself to initiate proposals for<br />
briefing of committees, where he considers this to be<br />
desirable. 4. Officials will not be expected or authorised to<br />
express opinions on Government policies, policy options or<br />
matters of a party political nature. The discussions may<br />
however include administrative arrangements and procedures<br />
involved in implementation of existing or proposed policies*<br />
or legislation. If matters are raised which in the judgement of<br />
officials, seek expressions of' opinion of Government<br />
policies or on alternative policies, as distinct from<br />
factual explanations of existing or proposed policies, the<br />
officials would suggest that those matters be -raised with<br />
the Minister. / 2 </p>
<p>f 6. Where considered necessary or desirable, Ministers<br />
may elect to be present at discussions with Government party<br />
committees, to deal with questions of a policy or party<br />
political nature.<br />
7. ' here the Minister does not attend the committee<br />
proceedings, he will have the right to be kept informed by<br />
officials of the nature of the discussions and of any<br />
matters not able to be resolved by the officials to the<br />
committee's satisfaction.<br />
8. Where an official considers that questioning by a<br />
committee goes beyond the authorised scope of the briefing<br />
arrangements, he should so indicate to the committee, and<br />
before answering will be at liberty to raise the matter with<br />
the head of his department or authority, and the Minister,<br />
and if he so desires, with the Public Service Board. </p>

PRIAM= MiNAISTER<br />
GUIDELINES RELATING TO ACCESS BY MEMBERS OF<br />
PARLIAM'* ENT TO PUBLIC SERVANTS AND OFFICERS OF STATUTORY<br />
AUTHORITIES<br />
1. Much will depend on the nature of the request.<br />
There will, for example, be occasions when a request by a<br />
Member of Parliament amounts to no more than a request for<br />
readily available factual information. In these<br />
circumstances, the information should obviously be provided.<br />
2. There may be other occasions where, in the judgement<br />
of officials, a Member's request raises sensitive issues, for<br />
example, where expressions of opinion are sought on<br />
Government policies or alternative policies, as distinct<br />
from explanation of existing policies. Officials will not<br />
be expected or authorised to express opinions on Government<br />
policies, policy options or matters of a party political<br />
nature. Information provided may, however, include details<br />
of admhinistrative arrangements and procedures involved in<br />
implementation of approved policies or legislation.<br />
3. Where a request is made which seeks expressions of<br />
opinion on Government policies or policy options, it would<br />
be appropriate to suggest that the Member pursue the matter<br />
with the Minister. Similar action would be appropriate if a<br />
request raised other issues of a sensitive nature, or where<br />
the answering of a request would necessitate the use of<br />
substantial resources of the department or authority.<br />
4. Care should be taken to avoid unauthorised<br />
disclosure of classified or otherwise confidential information,.<br />
for example, where a breach of personal or commercial privacy<br />
could be involved.<br />
An official should, as appropriate, inform the head<br />
of his department or authority or Minister of a request for<br />
information and of the outcome.<br />
6. Where an official considers that the terms of a<br />
request would require him to go beyond the authorised scope<br />
of -the above arrangements, he should so indicate to the<br />
Member, and will be at liberty to raise the matter with the<br />
head of his department or authority and the Minister and.,<br />
if he so desires, with the Public Service Board. </p>
