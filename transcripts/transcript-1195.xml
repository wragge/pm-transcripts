DTR IF HONOUR OF SIR CHARLES BIC TON<br />
BCKBURN, RHACELLOR F2ERITU UIVERITY<br />
Uip SYDR'.. JYDfm 12th NOVEMBER. 1965<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Chancellor and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
. Then I was born, Charles Bickerton Blackburn was between<br />
twenty and twenty-one years old, and as I have a firm conviction<br />
that all happiness will be mine if I can attend his 100th<br />
birthday, I have a very great privilege tonight to be allowed to<br />
speak about him.<br />
But before I speak about him, could I tell you that my<br />
memory has be titillated a little by some of the remarks that have<br />
been made along the table, and to my left by the Vice-Chancellor<br />
who like me suffers the fate of being in his own right, a<br />
graduate of the University of Melbourne,<br />
Reference was made tonight by you, Chancellor, to Robert<br />
Strachan Wallace who was the Professor ol Lnglish in my time at<br />
the Melbourne University, and so parochial are the people in<br />
Sydney that when many years afterwards I was invited inadvertently<br />
I can only assume to have lunch at a celebrated club in Sydney,<br />
I arrived I shed my hat and coat and I walked into the smoking<br />
room and there my host said " I would like to introduce you to<br />
Sir Robert 4allace" and I stood off about three yards I'm sure<br />
I've told this to some of you before today and looked at him and<br />
said ' Hence in a season of calm weather<br />
Though inland far we be,<br />
Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea<br />
1hich brought us hither<br />
Can in a moment travel thither,<br />
And see the Children sport upon the shore,<br />
And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.<br />
That's Wordsworth lads, and good stuff." ( Laughter) After that,<br />
of course, they realised that I wasn't unacquainted with him.<br />
I hope Professor Mitchell will take a note of that.<br />
And then when I heard the Chancellor tonight do us the<br />
singular favour of doing a little Lucretius into English it is<br />
not his customary practice I was reminded of a very great<br />
classical scholar in my time at the University,( and I think Vice-<br />
Uhancellor in yours) Professor Tucker. He was a great man, he<br />
was a wonderful scholar and he had a nice dry wit as a classical<br />
scholar should. One day we were sitting in the lecture room, one of<br />
these terrace lecture rooms and he was addressing us, no doubt<br />
on the subject of Latin and two or three of the fellows you'll<br />
be surprised at this they probably turned out to be medical<br />
students in the long run; they were not very interested in this<br />
but they wanted to have a bit of fun, so one of them with that<br />
excruciating form of wit which I believe is still current in the<br />
undergraduate body, brought a dog in and sooled the dog down the<br />
steps and the dog, not unwilling went down had a look around,<br />
walked up on to the dais and stood there with shouts of undergraduate<br />
laughter this was the wittiest event of the year. I<br />
suppose it was expecting that Professor Tucker would be a little<br />
incommoded by this. He just stopped in the middle of a sentence, / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
bent down, patted the dog on the head and said, " Well, puppy,<br />
did you come in with the others?"<br />
Now having got off these highly irrelevant reminiscences<br />
of mine, may I tell you that I'm here and my wife is here<br />
because we both suffer from an enormous admiration and a deep<br />
affection for Sir Charles Bickerton Blackburn now to be known,<br />
as I realise, as Chancellor Emeritus. Might i suggest, air,<br />
that you should do something about Prime Ministers. ( Laughter)<br />
( Applause) * ihen I have gone at long last to live in the street<br />
in ' Melbourne which is now I believe called Haverlook Avenue<br />
I think it would give you and myself great pleasure if people<br />
would say, " That's where the Prime Minister Emeritus lives."<br />
Of course, there is nothing half so insignificant as a Prime<br />
Minister when he is a Prime Minister; nothing quite so<br />
contemptible as a Prime Minister who is no longer a Prime<br />
Minister, and I put in this little plea. You might do something<br />
in the academic world Prime Minister Emeritus. Oh, this<br />
attracts me, enormously.<br />
Now, when I agreed to come down here, I found my mission<br />
a little sketchy to~ a because certain things have happened<br />
around the world whi require a great deal of painful thought;<br />
I said to myself, " What is it about Sir Charles Bickerton<br />
Blackburn that makes him a legendary figure, not only in this<br />
university but in the whole of the Commonwealth of Australia.<br />
iihat is i{ about him?" Well, of course, he is a great physician,<br />
and that's a pretty good thing to be with very great respect<br />
to you Chancellor that's a pretty good thing to be. The<br />
older I get, the more respect 1 have for great physicians.<br />
He' 8 a great educationist because for many years he has<br />
been the hancellor of this reat and famous university. In<br />
the whole of that time he didn't ever seem to me to flag or<br />
fail in any way. He was everywhere, he did everything. I<br />
couldn't get within half a mile of this place wiThout encountering<br />
him. A great educationist. And the history of the<br />
University oFcSydney has been enriched by the fact that he<br />
has been Ohancellor and has held the standards high. Now this<br />
is a very great thing to be, in addition to being a great<br />
physician. He has been a great citizen, and that, if I may say so,<br />
is rather more important than being either a great physician or<br />
a great educationist. He's been a great citizen. I will<br />
undertake to say that there are thousands and thousands of<br />
people in Sydney who, when they thought about the university<br />
also thought about Charles Bickerton Blackburn and this is<br />
tremendously important because if your Chancellor is and this<br />
is still the simple truth a great citizen then the people<br />
take the university to their hearts and to their minds ana don't<br />
regard it as something remote and apart,<br />
And above all these things again, he is a great human<br />
being alert, alive, warm-hearted and almost omnipresent.<br />
I don't understand how he's been doing it for 91 years because<br />
I'm sure he started in the cradle. I don't understand how he<br />
does it but wherever you go, you meet him. There he is,<br />
attending a party or two parties or three parties I don't<br />
know how many parties we have in the Commonwealth now let's<br />
say three or four anyhow he's attending and looking around<br />
like that, you know, and still, if you will allow me to say so,<br />
with a remarkably quick eye for a prettT girl. ( Laughter)<br />
This argues, if it needs to be argued, that he's a great human<br />
S. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
being. Now these are the facets of his life and of his<br />
character that present themselves to me.<br />
All I want to do apart from that is to say, " hat have<br />
been the secret springs of his career because you can never udge<br />
any man from the outside, you can never Just look at ffho's qio,<br />
you can never just look at something tha a ppears in a newspaper<br />
or some essay that somebody has written. These will give you<br />
the superficial aspects of a man but it is tremendously important<br />
to get to understand what are the inner springs of his character<br />
and his achievement and this takes us below the surface.<br />
Well, in his case could I say that he has throughout<br />
his life, his professional life, possessed enormous skill, and<br />
skill is not something given to you by a Government. Skill is<br />
not something created by a statute. Skill is not something<br />
created by a system of scholarships or awards. Skill is always<br />
the product of the marriage of a natural talent and a tremendous<br />
devotion to work, a tremendous devotion to knowledge. This<br />
doesn't happen by accident. It doesn't happen by decree. It<br />
happens because the man has in himself that urge to know, that<br />
urge to acquire skill, that willingness to scorn delights and to<br />
live laborious days which ultimately produces in him the top<br />
range of skill an this, if I may say so, has been one of the<br />
inspiring elements in Sir Charles' own life.<br />
And in the second place, being a great physician he<br />
has had a great feeling for humanity, for human beings. ko<br />
physician could be a , eat one who merely acquired skill and then<br />
looked at people as ifthev were objects for study, as if they<br />
represented numbers in a catalogue or even on a computer. e<br />
must have true humanity. The proper study of mankind is man,<br />
and for a great physician this is doubly true because every<br />
human being who presents Aimself to him is his own individual<br />
problem, and he must get inside the mind of the man the heart of<br />
the man, the feeling of the man and by man I include woman.<br />
This is true. There must be a deep instinct for humanity.<br />
argues likeA ndth lte heCnh, a nciefl lcooru rEsem, e rietvuesr, y nwohwo haansd gtrheeant ssokmielblo, d ywho has<br />
a eelin of true humanity and who has enduring usefulness. This<br />
is something worth thinking about. I know most of us are not<br />
in his class in this way; most of us know that as time goes on,<br />
you begin to feel occasionally that you are out of touch with<br />
the new generation, that you are in your ovn generation, that<br />
perhaps these others coming along have thin 
and that you ought to try To understand. Bless my soul and<br />
body, this man Has the spirit of enduring usefulness. He's<br />
like Peter Pan, the boy who wouldn't grow up. How true this is.<br />
I've never heard him make an old man's remark have you? I<br />
have always thought that whatever he had to say was a contemporary<br />
thing. He was a boy among boys. Ho was a young man among young<br />
men. This is a tremendous thing, and all the more tremendous to<br />
me ladies and gentlemen when I recall now something that I<br />
dian't know at the time that when I was born for better or for<br />
worse, he was already most of the way throu h1is medical course.<br />
He was a man and I was an infant who would gave been mewling<br />
and puking in the nurse's arms if the family had been able to<br />
afford a nurse. Now the last thing that I want to say about him is that<br />
he has this marvellous capacity for sustained enthusiasm. Now,<br />
S. / 4 </p>
<p>enthusiasm in a highly respectable world becomes a little suspect.<br />
" Oh, I wish you wouldn't say that"...." You sounded enthusiastic<br />
about that" It is proper not to be too enthusiastic to be<br />
reserved to be muted a little on these things. He has the<br />
spirit of sustained enthusiasm, and it is to be contrasted with<br />
the attitude of all too many people in our country who say. " Oh,<br />
why should I be enthusiastic; Ill take what I can and I21h<br />
walt to see what more is comin-to me." This is an attitude of<br />
death death intellectually, death sociall, death politically,<br />
to sa, " I'll take what they give me and I'h wait for the<br />
rest. To have this divine attribute of enthusiasm, this is<br />
so treme dously important and nowhere more importait than in a<br />
university which is the oldest and most historic university in<br />
this nation. This is tremendously important. Some of you<br />
have heard me say in the past, my anxiety, in spite of all that<br />
I have had the opportunity of doinp and it's been a little in<br />
the university field, my anxiety has always been that we will<br />
become too much on the receiving end, too willing to lower<br />
standards, too willing to speak in terms of quantity instead of<br />
in terms of quality. And the answer to that kind of feeling is<br />
to look around and see this grand old man of Australian university<br />
life and to know that he has an enthusiasm in him today, still<br />
has a feeling of worlds to be conquered that could be a marvellous<br />
example to people seventy years younger than himself.<br />
Now, Sir, I didn't intend to speak as long as this,<br />
but when you are speaking about a topic of this kind, it's not<br />
easy or convenient or desirable to be over-brief. But all I<br />
have said Sir, Sir Charles Bickerton Blackburn, all I have been<br />
sayingo is designed to convey to you not only for myself but for<br />
everybody here tonight and I thihk for a million or two millions<br />
or four millions or five millions of people in Australia something<br />
of what we feel about you how thankful we are that you have<br />
been among us, how delighted we are to know that for the next<br />
ten years you will still be among us, because I repeat what I<br />
said at the beg inning that my one remaining ambition is to attend<br />
your 100th birthday party.<br />
Sir and Ladies and Gentlemen, let us drink the health<br />
of this great man. Sir Charles. </p>
