VI SIT TO US, CANADA AND UKAR Y<br />
WASHINGTON, USA<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. HAROLD HOLT, AT BLAIR HOUSE, WASHINGTON _ Np JUNE, 1967<br />
PRIME MI NISTER: Ladies and Gentlemen, I am not prepared to make a direct<br />
statement, but thought it would be useful if I could just give you some sort of<br />
a picture of the talks I had yesterday.<br />
Of their very nature, they don't lend themselves, of course, to any<br />
detailed exposition of it. I wouldn't be received for the talks if I immediately<br />
go out and orate what I have come a long way to talk about and some very busy<br />
men an d very important men have been good enough to provide the time for<br />
me to discuss with them.<br />
But you can assume that I went over the ground, first with the President,<br />
on the principal issues in which Australia is interested in its relations with<br />
the United States. These would include the Vietnam situation, various aspects<br />
of that, the Middle Zast situation, of which I don't claim to be very well<br />
informed myself, but was able to get some valuable information in talks with<br />
the President and with the Secretary of State and with the Secretary of Defense.<br />
Then, of course, because that will be the principal matter I shall be discussing<br />
with Mr. Harold Wilson, in London, the questi6n of British troop di c-positibnC<br />
East of Suez in the future.<br />
I did touch on, with the President, several trade matters and economic<br />
matters of interest to Australia, but did not develop these in any detail at<br />
this point. Wehad agreed that we would make known our views on certain<br />
of them, say that these could be studied in some detail between now and the<br />
time that we shall next meet, when I have part of the week-end with him at<br />
his ranch on my return journey. But I did go into rather more detail on these<br />
matters with Mr. Rusk, and I shall be following them up.<br />
There is one aspect which it now appears cannot wait for treatment<br />
until we get to the ranch. That is the question of the wool duty which applies<br />
to Australia, and on wW ch we had held hopes, as part of the Kennedy Round<br />
negotiations, that there would be a significant reduction of the GT rate.<br />
This has not so far emerged, and we are taking that matter up again with Mr.<br />
Rusk in the hope that we can find a solution to it.<br />
I don't know that there is much more that I can say about the talks, because<br />
as I mentioned earlier, these were to enable a development of views between us.<br />
I think it is well known that the President and I have very much the same view of<br />
the Asian situation generally, the potentialities which are building up in those<br />
countries where Communism has been brought under check, and we both see a<br />
brighter future for Asia if we can bring the Vietnam struggle to a successful<br />
conclusion. Q. Mr. Prime M~ inister, yesterday, I believe, in your arrival statement,<br />
you mentioned the possibility that the war in Vietnam could wind up a lot<br />
sooner than some people expect, and soonier than the surface evidence<br />
indicates I think this is what you said. Would you explain your tninking<br />
along those lines? 2/ </p>
<p>P. M. Wiell, there are two, at least two bases for that. It is not put as a<br />
confident expectation, or even as a solid judgment. It is put as a possibility.<br />
Ibase it on these two lines of thought: first, the North Vietnamese are<br />
undoubtedly taking a severe punishment to the economy from the intensive<br />
bombing which has been going on. While I was in Honolulu, I was given a<br />
detailed briefing by Admiral Sharp, which included a survey of the bombing<br />
results. This was accompanied by illustrations in many cases of the<br />
industrial establishments before and after the bombing.<br />
While I know there is a school of thought that the bombing has not<br />
reduced significantly the degree of infiltration and the movement of supplies,<br />
I think there is little, there can be little doubt that continued material<br />
punishment of this sort not only has an effect upon the state of the economy of<br />
the country, but ties up some hundreds of thousands, which is estimated in<br />
the neighborhood of three hundred thousand, members of the work force for<br />
the repair and reconstruction. And the damage to the industrial assets<br />
gas stations, steel works, and the like has been very considerable.<br />
Now, I do not believe that even the most stoic and enduring community<br />
car take that kind of punishment indefinitely without the leaders asking<br />
themselves the question, is this worth it, is the prospect that we have for'<br />
the future worth the sacrifice that we are making now? They can't entertain<br />
any optomistic view in the military campaign against the evidence of their<br />
own losses and the rebuffs they have had in recent times.<br />
So that is one line of thought which leads one to conclude that there<br />
comes a point of time in which the communist leadership has to ask itself<br />
whether it is justified in going on when prospects are held open for it of a<br />
negotiation which at least will leave its own, leave North Vietnam secure.<br />
We have made it clear that we don't have as an objective the domination of<br />
North Vietnam nor the destruction of its economy in the long term.<br />
So the second line of thinking really proceeds from the first. It is based<br />
on some experience we have had of communist, the communist mentality at<br />
work, but it is in the international field and inside Australia in the industrial'<br />
field, where communists have been in charge of some of our more important<br />
unions; we found that althoug,,-, h we have seemed at a particular point in time to<br />
be up against a brick wall in negotiation, with no prospect of a solution<br />
emerging, without forewarning, without regard to consistency or whatever has<br />
gaone before, the communist leadership, having made up its mind that the<br />
time has come to resolve the matter, does so.<br />
So it is on these two possibilities that I make this statement that while,<br />
on the surface, it would appear that there is no crack in the edifice of resistance,<br />
it could come more rapidly than the superficial indications would seem to say.<br />
Q. Don't you think the North Vietnamese could take the same line in view<br />
of the heavy casualties that have been suffered by the Americans?<br />
P. M. I don't think you could compare the two countries from the standpoint<br />
' nf their respective strengths. I am not wanting to understate the American<br />
casualties, but relative to a country of 190-odd million people, it is not a<br />
degree of loss which can't be sustained. The individual loss is grievous, of<br />
course, to the people concerned, but looking at the respective countries, the<br />
loss to North Vietnam is much less capable of acceptance than the degree of<br />
loss which America has been maintaining. 3/ </p>
<p>Q. Mr. Prime Minister, with regard to the disposition of British troops<br />
East of Suez, did you find an identity of view here in Wiashington?<br />
P. M. Oh, I think you can take it that the United States shares the Australian<br />
view that British presence, military presence, East of Suez, is important for<br />
maintaining British position in the world and for helping to maintain stability<br />
and act as a moderating influence in relation to that area. It has a bearing<br />
clearly, also, on the United States' position in the Asian region. It will not<br />
be a welcome development to the United States to find itself the only major<br />
power maintaining a military presence on the mainland of Asia.<br />
If you consider the various bilateral arrangements of a security kind<br />
undertaken by the United States, you find that from the arc running right<br />
around from Korea to Thailand, that in respect of a number of countries<br />
* namely, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, itself, and currently, of course,<br />
South Vietnam the United States has accepted security commitments and<br />
has left this one area to the Commonwealth, regarding it as a Commonwealth<br />
* responsibility. That is the Malaysi a-Singapore area. But as for the rest of<br />
that arc you find that the United States has accepted a very considerable<br />
obligation and burden for its security.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, in view of what you have said about the North<br />
Vietnamese bombing, would you favour an increase in the tempo of the bombing?<br />
P. M. Oh, I don't wish to comment on that. America is carrying the large<br />
burden of this matter. I think that the American military judgment should<br />
be looked to to be sure that they get what they regard as the most effective<br />
results from it. I don't think it is for us to tell them what they ought to be<br />
doing, when they are provid~ ing the wherewithal.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, you mentioned that you discussed the Middle East<br />
situation with the President. I was wondering if you would be kind enough to<br />
tell us what conclusions you arrived at and what decisions you might have made?<br />
P. M. The only comment I can make on that is that the proposal for a declaration<br />
* by certain maritime powers was discuesed and I was able to indicate, this<br />
matter having been under discussion between myself and my Cabinet colleagues<br />
in Australia, that if there were other powers joining in such a declaration,<br />
Australia would join with them in it.<br />
Q. Would we participate in any international military force?<br />
P. M. That question doesn't arise at this stage, and it was not raised with us.<br />
Q. Could you elaborate on those remarks you made do you see any hope<br />
* of salvaging Kennedy Round discussions if you didn't get any concessions?<br />
I can't develop it very much, Max. This is a matter which Mr. McEwen'<br />
has been pursuing very actively. What I was hoping to arrange was for a<br />
briefing on it to be made available to me so that by the time I came back to the<br />
discussion at the ranch, I would be in a position to pursue it further. But I<br />
have since been advised by Mr. McEwen that there is a timing problem on this,<br />
that while some of the other matters with which you are familiar yourself,<br />
can wait for that point of time for discussion, this is one which we have to try<br />
to resolve before the time runs out for the Kennedy Round negotiations.<br />
Q. How are you going to resolve it before the time runs out?<br />
P. M. How are we going to? </p>
<p>Q. Yes.<br />
P. M. Our representatives here will be able to take it up with the Department<br />
of State people. I think the atmosphere which has been created already by<br />
my own talks should prove at least helpful in providing a receptive atmosphere<br />
for this discussion.<br />
Q. So it is not that all hope is gone of getting some concession?<br />
P. M. I would hope not.<br />
You say that there is a time limit. Is there an actual specific day and<br />
hour by which time the problem must be resolved or otherwise?<br />
P. M. This was a factor in th'e negotiations at Geneva. I understand that there<br />
has been a time limit virtually set by the Congress.<br />
Q. Do you know what date that is?<br />
P. m. I haven't it in my head. I have an idea it is around the end of this month,<br />
but don't hold me to that.<br />
Q. Sir, is this a special bilateral arrangement that you hope to reach with<br />
the United States?<br />
P. M. Well, usually, an arrangement of this sort is achieved on the basis of a<br />
negotiation in which concessions are made on both sides. That is where it<br />
becomes a more technical matter for the Department of Trade. I have merely<br />
put it on the basis that the United States is the only country in the world which<br />
maintains a tariff duty on raw wool.<br />
Q. Wihat type of reciprocal offer would we make?<br />
P. Mv. Again, I wouldn't want to be openly exposing what possibilities might exist.<br />
But this becomes a matter of negotiation. It will bear on some import item<br />
they have.<br />
Q. Mr. Holt, will you speak onthis matter cf economic matters generally<br />
in London, also? Will you take it coming back?<br />
P. M. Wiell, the EEC matter, I expect there will be some discussion of that<br />
there between us. But mainly to learn from Mr. Vilson what view he takes<br />
of the British prospects. Mr. Mc. Swen has been there quite recently, so<br />
Australia's views as to particular commodities are well known.<br />
Q. You have no specific problems or questions to ask?<br />
P. Ivi. No, I have none. There are specialists on those matters. I would merely<br />
wish to have a general view from the Prime Ainister of the prospects as he<br />
sees them, what he may have in mind by way of safeguarding what they term as<br />
essential Commonwealth interests, what definition they put on " essential".<br />
I mean it may be essential for a man to reduce his production of dried fruits;<br />
he may have a market to sustain for his dried fruits. But it might be the<br />
view of the British Government that " essential" means that the economy is<br />
able to go on substantially untouched. As Mr. MciEwen said in London, it<br />
doesn't help the grower of dried fruits very much to tell him that we'll be<br />
much better off letting him die off. </p>
<p>Q. Mr. Prime Minister, there is a report that Egypt would consider closing the<br />
Suez Canal to the ships of any nation that might try to break the Israel<br />
blockade. Would Australia consider this as a hostile act?<br />
P. M. You mention it as a report. I have no information on that. I wouldn't<br />
wish to comment.<br />
I would just air that Australia, as one of the principal trading nations<br />
of the world we rank among the 12 largest trading nations of the world<br />
has an interest in seeing that there are no limitations placed on international<br />
waterways. We joined in a declaration some years ago of a comparable kind<br />
to that which is being sou., ht now. -V. e would therefore be expected to tuke a<br />
direct interest in any limitations which any country might propose on what<br />
has been regarded as international waterways.<br />
Q? Would you say what your talk with Secretary-General U Thant might<br />
develop or what you might hope to achieve by it?<br />
P. M. WAell, I would hope that we could explore each other's thinking. W-e<br />
don't agree, quite obviously, on our interpretation of events in Vietnam. I<br />
would hope that one or the other of us would be open to persuasion, if that<br />
is justified from the changed point of view. Different people place a different<br />
interpretation upon events, as I found when I was in Cambodia. Sihanouk<br />
doesn't see events in Vietnam the same way as we do. I think it is quite<br />
obvious thiat U Thant doesn't.<br />
For example I don't want to be on the record on this as a direct quote<br />
from me, but some of you may recall that I did make some comments some<br />
time ago when the Secretary General was reported as having said that Vietnam<br />
was not a vital interest for the West. 11-ell, more recently, he described<br />
Vietnam as leadin), to a third world war. I would find those two statennts<br />
quite inconsistent. Surely if the situation is leading to athird world war, it<br />
is a matter of vital interest to the countries of the Wiest. I have thought all<br />
along that Vietnam was a matter of very substantial concern to the countries<br />
of the West.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, as we are increasing buyers of American defense<br />
equipment, have you raised with anyone here the obvious inefficiency of the<br />
American forward costing system as demonstrated by the skyrocketing costs<br />
of the F-111?<br />
P. M. Not in any detail. I did in the courseof my discussion with the Secretary<br />
of Defense I think it was Secretary Rusk who mentioned this as one of the<br />
matters which affected the considerable purchase we have been making of<br />
defense equipment in the United States, which, of course, has its own impact<br />
on the balance of payments situation.<br />
Q. Did you suggest the Sydney Opera House as an example of our own<br />
planning? ( Laughter)<br />
Q. Mr. Holt, did you mention, or will you be mentioning the possibility<br />
of Australia gretting some exemption from the interest equalization tax on<br />
money flowing out from America into Australia?<br />
P. M. That is an old concern of mine. I raised this matter in the time of<br />
Douglas Dillon, when he was Secretary of the Treasury. You can take it that I<br />
always felt that if an exemption were justified in the case of Japan and Canada,<br />
Australia, which has highly adverse balance of trade with the United States and<br />
which is making very substantial repayments of borrowed money to the United<br />
Eltates, has a strong case for the exemption, at least up to an agreed level, also.<br />
This is one matter which I shall be pursuin.; further before I return to Australia. </p>
