<p>E M B A R G 0 NOT-FOR RELEASE BY ANY MEDIA BEFORE<br />
8. 30 PM, WEDNESDAY 4 NOVEMBER 1970.<br />
Tonight I want to talk to you briefly about the coming Senate Campaign.<br />
I shall report to you on our achievem -: nts in the last year. I shall<br />
touch briefly on the further objectives we have i. mind and I shall poi -t out the<br />
great differences between Labor and ourselves 11 defence, foreign policy, and<br />
responsible non-inflationary internal Governme. t.<br />
The result of a Senate Election does not usually affect Australia's<br />
future. But it is possible that this election could result in Labor's gairing a<br />
blocking half in the Senate that is 30 Scnators.<br />
If that happened Labor wcu'. d not have power to do anything positive.<br />
But it would have the power to obstruct, frustrate, and delay all the processes of<br />
government. It could refuse supply, or defeat a budget. And I believe it would<br />
use that power, as it would use any power it could gain, to damage Australia's<br />
security, to destroy Australia's alliances, to disrupt Australia's economy and<br />
to affect Australia's future very greatly.<br />
Nevertheless the election is not an occasion for us to advar. ce new<br />
policies, or make new specific promises. The occasien for that was oi-le year ago,<br />
at the General Election, when we put before you a programme, policies, and<br />
promises for a three year period. And you elected us.<br />
I can report to you that in the one year since then we have carried cut<br />
most of the promises we said we gould carry out over three years. I shall not<br />
weary you with a detailed list in this short address. But we have brought in a<br />
vastly improved health scheme. We have reduced the burden of direct taxation in<br />
one year by the amount we promised to do in three years. We have continued to<br />
protect and advance greater Australian ownership of our developing resources.<br />
Vie have greatly increased spending on education and on new initiatives i<br />
social services. And we have given the States a new financial deal by greatly<br />
increasing the funds they require for their own responsibilities.<br />
These are only a few ct the year's achievements. The complete list is<br />
much longer. I think that I can justly claim " that which we promise, we perform".<br />
" While they talk, we act."<br />
We have additional objectives. We shall attain these as we feel it<br />
financially responsible to do so. We wish to continue the improvement of social<br />
welfare services generally; and I remind you that in tlr: ee years of<br />
Government the variety of social services, and the buying power of pens. ons<br />
generally, have been increased irpre than they have ever been increase-in a<br />
copnparable period of time. ' 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
We wish to reduce the burden of long-continued illness<br />
on those in nursing homes as -we-have already done for those in<br />
hospitals. We wish to initiate throughout Australia, in conjunction<br />
with the States and voluntiry bodies, a network of kindergarten-cumchild-<br />
minding centres. We wish to undertake a programme in rural<br />
areas designed to help farmers obtain long-term credit and to enable<br />
rural reconstruction to take place where it is necessary. And we have<br />
taken a firm decision to establish an Office of the Environment and seek<br />
to join with the States in the formation of a National Council t o co-) rdinate<br />
the fight against the growing problem of pollution of all kinds.<br />
This, in brief, is the story tif what we have done, and what<br />
we hope to do. And these things are important.<br />
But even more impor-ant is the harm which Labor would do<br />
to our security. Let me first discuss with you the question of Vietnam.<br />
Why I think it was right, and in our interests to go there to help. Why<br />
I think it is right and in our interests to remain there until the<br />
Vietnamese are organised enough, and strong erough, to defend themselves.<br />
May I remind you how this War began.<br />
For a number of years after the Geneva Accords of 1954<br />
the people of North Vietnam lived under their communist government<br />
and the people of South Vietnam lived under their non-communist<br />
government. The people in both sections lived in relative peace. That<br />
peace could have continued.<br />
But the Government of North Vietnam was prepared to wage<br />
war rather than let the people of the South retain the right to choose<br />
their own Government and way of life. And the people of the South were<br />
prepared to accept war rather than have their right of self-determination<br />
taken from them rather than have an alien government imposed on<br />
them by force. And so the war came.<br />
It came at first through an uprising armed and directed by<br />
the North and then through an invasion of the South by the North Vietnamese<br />
Regular Army. I do not ask you to accept this on my statement alone,<br />
f or the Piresent Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, Mr Lance Barnard,<br />
has endorsed what I say. In May 1967 after a visit to Vietnam he<br />
reported publicly that there was a large-scale invasion of South Vietnam<br />
by North Vietnamese troops. " 1 am satisfied", he said, " that this is<br />
more than just a guerilla war and I suppose it can be compmai with the<br />
earlier conflict in Korea".<br />
So there was invasion. And the object of that invasion was<br />
to destroy self-determination in South Vietnam; to take away the people's<br />
right to choose how and under what government they would live. 3 </p>
<p>Again, I do not ask you to accept this on my statement alone. For<br />
in his Evatt Memorial Lecture of 1966 the present Leader of the Opposition,<br />
Mr. Whitlam, wrote:<br />
" It is, however, quite clear that victory by the Vietcong<br />
and Hanoi would destroy any hope of self determination in<br />
the South as it has destroyed it in the North".<br />
And this invasion was accompanied, as Mr. Whitlam has admitted, by ' Vietcong<br />
brutalities and cruelties in Vietnam".<br />
Don't you think it was right to help fight that aggression? Were we<br />
immoral to do so as we are now told or were the invaders immoral' Should we<br />
follow the dictates of Mr. Whitlam's present comsciezceandceasetor csit invasion,<br />
the imposition of communist dictatorship, and the brutalities perpetrated, or<br />
should we continue to resist and finish that which we began.<br />
Well, the invasion was resisted with the help of the Americans and<br />
of , urselves and other countries. It has been resisted for six years. And<br />
in that time the strength and purpose of South Vietnam has so grown that it is<br />
now able to take over more of its own defence; it has so grown that the<br />
Americans and ourselves have been able to reduce our troop numbers without<br />
endangering the objectives we sought.<br />
It is possible for us to make this reduction because we stayed and<br />
fought when Labor was clamouring for us to withdraw. And because we stayed<br />
and fought it is now possible for President Nixon to offer a cease fire, an end<br />
to the killing, and negotiations designed to allow the South Vietnamese to elect<br />
their own government from the candidates cf any political party including the<br />
communist party. Who then is immoral? We, who offer an end to killing or they who<br />
insist on continuing the killing to achieve military conquest and who refuse a<br />
cease fire?<br />
What does that present conscience, of which Mr. Whitlam speaks so much,<br />
suggest we should do7 To continue to resist brutal and unprovoked invasion<br />
To help a small nation retain the right to govern itself' Or to withdraw all<br />
our troops now as Mr. Whitlam presently demands.<br />
If we did that we would betray the people of South Vietnam. We<br />
would negate . he heavy sacrifices already made. We would be recreant to<br />
the hopes for future universal peace because future peace can only endure if<br />
small nations are not threatened with invasion and conquest. 4 </p>
<p>We would destroy the confidence of the other small countries in Asia,<br />
and by doing that, we would increase the possibility of future da: ger to<br />
Australia itself. We look forward to the day when, with South Vietnam able to guard<br />
its own independence without help, we can withdraw all our troops, That day is<br />
coming nearer as the military war is being won. But until it does arrive I<br />
suggest that morality, conscience, and self interest all require that we should<br />
finish the task we began.<br />
But Labor under Mr. Whitlam would renege in Vietnam.<br />
Having done this and thereby increased the danger to other Asian<br />
countries including Malaysia they would ther withdraw from the Five ? ower<br />
Arrangements designed to help Malaysia and Singapore and at the same time they<br />
would drastically cut the strength of our own army by abolishing National Service.<br />
We would be alone, with our alliances shattered, regarded an<br />
accepting no responsibility to help maintain peace in our regio: n. And with<br />
our own army halved.<br />
That is what I meant by saying Labor would damage Australia's<br />
security and destroy Australia's alliances.<br />
And that is one reason I ask you not to give them the chance to do<br />
this damage. Just as I ask you not to give Mr. Whitlam the chance to wreck<br />
our internal economy. Both he and Mr. Hawke are pledged to attain a 35 hour<br />
week. The only difference between them is that Mr. Hawke is pledged to do<br />
this all the time, and Mr. Whitlam is pledged to do it all the time, except at<br />
election time.<br />
If he achieves that aim our rural industries will suffer a loss of at least 9%-cf<br />
their income and many farmers now-in great difficulty will be utterly destroyed.<br />
Those living on superannuation will be hard hit, the value of all pensions will<br />
be drastically reduced, prices to the housewife will soar, Eidae-~ a.<br />
our country will be destroyed, and our development will wither away.<br />
There are many other issues to be debated in this Campaign. There<br />
is our intention. to introduce laws which will not interfere with the right of the<br />
minority to dissent, but will protect the civil rights of the majority of citizens.<br />
Labor appears to oppose this. There is the question cf whether the growing<br />
industrial unrest, hitting workers harder than anyone ALetan be-avoid rd e, Cnd-t<br />
means by which it can be avoided.<br />
There is the question of whether the way ahead for Australia is<br />
best assured by a continuance of private enterprise and competition or through<br />
the direction of business by socialist dictation to which Mr. Whitlam is<br />
pledged. </p>
<p>There is the need to consider the divisions within<br />
the Labor Party you have heard these words " divided" and " divisive".<br />
There is need to consider the divisions in the Labor Party, particularly<br />
in Victoria where the saga of the struggle for control of the Executive<br />
is rapidly assuming the character of a serial like Blue Hills.<br />
Will Gough ' eat jim? Will the TUDC still control the Party? What<br />
of Hawke lurking in the wings? Will the meeting called bogus last<br />
week be bogus or beneficial this week? Listen for our next<br />
thrilling episode' It would be funny if it were not clear that what<br />
Mr Whitlam has called a monolithic junta-ridden group is still<br />
so significant in Victorian Labor affairs and therefore in Australian<br />
Labor affairs. But these issues we must deal with later in the<br />
campaign. All I ask now is that you weigh these matters very<br />
seriously. I ask you to remember that Whitlam has talked<br />
while we have acted, and I ask you to give us the chance to continue<br />
to act, free from obstruction in the Senate. </p>
