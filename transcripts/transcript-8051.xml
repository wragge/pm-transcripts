PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 5 JULY 1990<br />
At the invitation of Prime Minister Rabble Namaliu, I<br />
will make an official visit to Papua New Guinea from<br />
Sunday 2 September to Thursday 6 September.<br />
Papua New Guinea is one of Australia's most important<br />
regional neighbours, with which we share many strategic,<br />
political and economic interests.<br />
My visit to Papua New Guinea will return Mr Namaliu's<br />
visit to Australia last year.<br />
During the visit I will hold discussions with the Prime<br />
Minister and members of his government on a range of<br />
matters of mutual interest, involving the bilateral<br />
relationship and broader regional developments.<br />
I will also meet with members of the Australian business<br />
community, and travel to important regional centres. 0 I<br />
