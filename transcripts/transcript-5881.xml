I would like to convey to you the warmest congratulations of<br />
the Government and people of Australia on once more becoming<br />
Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea.<br />
I look foward to working closely with you in maintaining and<br />
strengthening the close bonds of friendship between our two<br />
countries and to renewing personal links which have always<br />
played an important part in this relationship.<br />
I hope that I will see you at the Rotorua Forum Meeting later<br />
