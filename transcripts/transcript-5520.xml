FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 19 FEBRUARY, 1981<br />
THE QANTAS DISPUTE<br />
Qantas' international services have been seriously disrupted.<br />
This has arisen over a dispute concerning stewards, staffing<br />
and wage levels. In Australia there are well accepted<br />
mechanisms for settling disputes and it is a tragedy that<br />
they are not properly used... In this~ case the union resorted<br />
to wild-cat strikes as opposed to negotiation. There can be<br />
no justification for that.<br />
In this instance we have Qantas as Australia's international<br />
flag carrier being seriously damaged. The only advantage goes<br />
to Qantas' international and foreign competitors.<br />
Qantas is a great airline. It has ' total backing and support<br />
from, the Government and I want to thank the management and<br />
staff members who have valiantly sought to keep Qantas' services<br />
operating-' in the interests of the travelling public and in the<br />
interests of Qantas' and Australia's international reputation.<br />
_ M1r. Dolan and the ACTU are to be condemned for soliciting<br />
international support to undermine Qantas. It is time<br />
Australians pulled together and worked together, and especially<br />
-so -in relation to an organisation such as Qantas because -his<br />
dispute. holds Australia to ridicule before the whole world.<br />
There are some current negotiations proceeding and I urge<br />
everyone to make snre that they end in a just and speedy<br />
settlement of the dispute.<br />
This is Australia's airline and it's time we all<br />
supported it. 000---A/ d~ c1v A~-Ce<br />
