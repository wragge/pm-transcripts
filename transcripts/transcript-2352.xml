TRANSCR IPT PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO THE NATION<br />
( NATIONWIDE RADIO AND TELEVISION)<br />
THE ECONOMY 2.9 JAN~ 19,11<br />
You have all read much lately on the problemr, of inflation..., the problem<br />
~ f ent rises in costs and prices and the prospects fo the future, In some<br />
ways the matter has been a little over-diamatised perhaps, but there is nevertheless<br />
a very real problem for discussion.<br />
The disc-ic'sioi1 itself has resulted from two developments. First, tile<br />
rise of 1. 9% in the Consumer Price Index during the last three months of-1970<br />
the largest rise for some fourteen years. And secondly the likely effects on the<br />
economy-of the Arbitration Commission's award of a 6% increase in wages an~ d<br />
salaries a much greater increase than anyone had thought possible.<br />
Cabinet has met this week to discuss the problem and I want to tell you<br />
briefly how we see the present situation, and the approaches which we believe sh-ould<br />
be made to attack the root causes of inflation. But first let me refer to tile rise<br />
in the Consumer Pr ice Index.<br />
We believe that too muc h has been made of this single quarter's f igures.<br />
Much ofi the rise was due to the once-and-for-all inclusion of cost increases due to<br />
indirect taxes imposed by the Budget on such items as cigarettes, wine, petrol and<br />
so on. Without them the Index rise would have been about 1. 1% or a little more.<br />
So the real rate of increase was not nearly as great as the figures suggested.<br />
But, having made allowance for that, the rate of increase was uncom~ fortably<br />
high and reflected a too rapid underlying rate of price increase. Now, in that<br />
situation, of a too rapid underlying rate of price increase in that situation we are<br />
faced with a 6% wage and salary rise which will add perhaps $ 900 million a year<br />
to wages and salaries arid therefore purchasing power in a full year.<br />
We will not, at the present rate of production, produce sufficient additional<br />
goods and services to be exchanged for that additional money at constarnt pricec. It<br />
would be fine to give buyers an extra $ 900 million a year if we were going to produce<br />
$ 900 million worth of extra goods to sell. But we are not. Therefore, unless some<br />
action is taken, there will be a boost to inflation. And growing inflation is one of<br />
the worst ills from which a nation can suffer.<br />
In considering what action should be taken Cabinet sought first to discover<br />
the areas in which demand seemed to be growing most strongly. It appeared that<br />
consumer spending was not growing strongly. A high rate of growth in demnand has not,<br />
at any rate as yet, shown up in this field.<br />
The areas in which demand is growing strongly are in the public sector<br />
that is spending by Governments in private investment in new plant and machinr~ ery<br />
and fi non-dwelling building construction that is on. such things as the new blocks<br />
of offices now growing up in such profusion in twe cities of Australia. / 2 </p>
<p>We therefore believe our first line of attaclk should be to ensure<br />
not only a restraint on Government expenditure but a reduction in Government<br />
expenditure this financial year.<br />
Before I went to Singapore I issued instructions to all Departments and<br />
to the Public Service Board that action must be taken to restrain the growth in the<br />
number of public servants.<br />
We are now working out reductions in the Government's budgeted<br />
expenditure in other directions. Implementing these reductions will be<br />
uncomfortable. Australians will not get as much as they had hoped to get<br />
in the way of new public amenities of various kinds. But the reductions are<br />
necessary. By reducing the demand of Governments, more is mrade available to<br />
meet the demand of private persons.<br />
Secondly we believe that the rate of growth of new private investment<br />
in plant and equipment and machinery should be reduced.<br />
And thirdly the rate of growth, and the demand pressures of new nondwelling<br />
building construction must also be reduced.<br />
A considerable proportion of this latter demand is said to be due to the<br />
inflow of overseas capital for the specific purpose of building such buildings.<br />
The Government wishes it to be known that it would prefer overseas investors<br />
who are considering financing non-dwelling construction of this kind not to do so<br />
until they have first discussed their plans and the dates on whichi they propose to<br />
b . gin construction with the Treasury.<br />
We have considered taking monetary and fiscal measures at this time.<br />
That is restricting credit or raising interest rates still further or increasing<br />
taxation. We do not believe that the present situation requires a lift in interest<br />
rates, already high, and we would prefer to look forward to a future time<br />
necessarily indefinite when other measures we take might permit a reduction<br />
of such rates. Nor do we think that the present situation calls for a rise in taxation.<br />
I have already said that the rate of growth in consumer spending is<br />
not growing significantly as yet.<br />
To increase indirect taxes at this time would therefore be to further<br />
increase prices in an effort to reduce demand in an area where demand is not<br />
excessive, and by adding to the Consumer Price Index it would quite possibly<br />
stimulate an inflationary psychology. </p>
<p>To increase income taxes at this time would, again, be to tackle demand<br />
in an area where demand is not now excessive. It would not strike at the root of<br />
the tzouble, and its financial effects over a quarter of a year would be minimal.<br />
We do not reject these economic weapons and say we will not use them<br />
at some future time if it is necessary. If it is necessary, and useful in tackling<br />
the problem, we will use them however unpopular that may be. But we do not<br />
believe that to use them now would be of help. And we do not believe indeed that<br />
at any time the use of this-Tclassic weapons against inflation would of itself and<br />
alone solye our problems.<br />
Having said this, and having indicated some of the actions the<br />
Government will be taking to reduce demand in the sectors which are growing too<br />
rapidly, I come to what constitutes the major threat of inflation.<br />
No matte: what action a Government takes no matter how severely it<br />
taxes or how ruthlessly it cuts Government spending no matter how it seeks to<br />
redirect resources if that is what it wishes to do it will not be able to beat<br />
inflation if wages and salaries rise more quickly than production. Demands for<br />
over-award payments, for extra holidays, for additional holiday pay, for shol-ter<br />
hours can only be met in one of two ways. Either the amount of goods and<br />
services producei is increased sufficiently to enable these requests to be met<br />
without inflation or the requests are met at the cost of inflation which ultimately<br />
destroys the benefits sought and leaves us all worse off.<br />
Price control, imposed by Governments, is no answer to this problem.<br />
It is superficially appealing, but in fact all our advice is, and our beliefs are, that<br />
it is not an answer to the problem. There is a limit to the extra costs which<br />
et: . ployers can absorb before passing on cost increases by increasing prices. The<br />
inexorable fact is that if we try to pay higher wages without providing an<br />
equivalent increase in production we will have inflation. And yet this course is<br />
the one that Australia has been following and this approach is the real inflationary<br />
threat to Australia. Given our present Arbitration system and State Wages Tribunals, control<br />
of this situation is not now entirely in the hands of Governments. Yet Governments<br />
can do something to combat the over-award payments now being negotiated by<br />
employers. At present, employers are able to buy industrial peace by conces * sions,<br />
the cost of which they know they can pass on to the consumer. it can be made more<br />
difficult to pass on extra costs.<br />
Increased internal competition wouild help. And internal competition can<br />
be increased if the High Court upholds the validity of the present Trade Practices Act,<br />
both interstate and intrastate. If it does uphold the validity, the Act can be<br />
strengthened and lead to more internal competition. If the Court holds the Act in part<br />
invalid, then we will have to consider approaching the Australian people and asking<br />
them to give us more power to make the Act wholly valid.<br />
Further, external competition with industries in Australia when internal<br />
prices rise unduly in those industries because of costs, due to over-award payments<br />
and other concessions negotiated by employers in those industries, will have to be<br />
considered. </p>
<p>And now I sum up. There has been a tendency to over-dramatize the<br />
present inflationary situation. But there is a real threat of inflation inherent in<br />
the underlying demand and in the recent Arbitration Commission Award, in State<br />
Wages Tibunals Awards, and in increased over-a-ward payments which might be<br />
expected to flow on from that.<br />
We propose to take action against demand inflation by reducing<br />
Government spending, by encouraging postponement of private investment in<br />
plant, by discouraging the present rate of construction of non-dwelling<br />
construction such as office buildings and by other ancillary actions of lesser<br />
importance which we have in mind. We will seek to increase internal competition<br />
and to examine cases where competition from external sources might be justified,<br />
so as to make it more difficult for employers to concede union demands.<br />
We are prepared in the future to take any further action which may be<br />
considered necessary to play our full part in beating inflation. But unless wage<br />
fixing authorities, unions and employers, also play their full part, our actions in<br />
the future by the classic weapons of taxation and reducing demand could impose<br />
more hardship than would otherwise be necessary and not have the oorrective<br />
effect -which they would otherwise have. What we seek in Australia is production<br />
which increases yearly and wages and salaries which also increase yearly but not<br />
faster than production, so that there can be a real increase in living standards.<br />
In the present employment situation full employment with the<br />
growingr public demand for more Government services, it will be'uncomfortable<br />
tc achieve this. Many things for which an admirable and persuasive case can be<br />
made out may have to be postponed. But in the long run we will all be better off.<br />
We all have a part to play in attaining that goal. And for its part, within the<br />
Lirnitations the law imposes on it, the Government will play its full part. </p>
