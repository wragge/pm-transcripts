FOR MEDIA 7 July 1909<br />
Following a request from the Prime Minister of Papua New<br />
Guinea, Mr Namaliu, during talks I held with him in Canberra<br />
on 24 May, the Government of fered to provide four Iroquois<br />
UIlH helicopters, and associated training for Papua New<br />
Guinean aircrew, to assist the PNG Defence Force develop a<br />
rotary wing capability.<br />
Subsequently, the PNG Government indicated that it wanted to<br />
secure the early delivery of these helicopters, particularly<br />
against the background of developments on Bougainville.<br />
After consultations between Australian and PNO Ministers,<br />
Mr Namaliu wrote to me on 5 July outlining his Government's<br />
intentions on the ways in which the helicopters would be used.<br />
Mr Nwnaliu said the use of the helicopters in Bougainville<br />
would be in keeping with a political strategy aimed at, among'<br />
other things, minimising offence to the local population. The<br />
helicopters would not be used as gunships. They would be used<br />
for troop transportation$ for patrolling and surveillanoe<br />
activities, and for medical evacuation purposes for both<br />
civilians and military.<br />
He emphasised that the PNG Government's political objectives<br />
were to secure the reopening of the Bougainville copper mine,<br />
the protection of the population, and the surrender of all the<br />
militants. I have written to Mr 3Iamaliu today telling him that, on the<br />
basis of his letter, my Government will now make arrangements<br />
for the early provision of four UHIH helicopters, plus a<br />
28 days spares package for each aircraft to cover normal<br />
operations. The provision of the helicopters will be subject<br />
to the completion of the normal end user arrangements<br />
governing the possible transfer of the aircraft to third<br />
countries. in addition, I have confirmed that the Australian Government<br />
will provide $ 1 million per annum for the next three years as<br />
a contribution towards the cost of the PNG Government<br />
arranging the operation and maintenance of the aircraft under<br />
civil contract.<br />
This assistance' will be in addition to the training of Papua<br />
New Guinea Defence Force airorew under our Defence<br />
Co-operation arrangements. </p>
