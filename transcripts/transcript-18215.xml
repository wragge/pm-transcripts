HOST: Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>PM: Good morning.</p>
<p>HOST: You're giving the opening address at the Commonwealth Business Forum this morning? What will you be telling them?</p>
<p>PM: In my address to the Commonwealth Business Forum I'll be very much focussing on today's circumstances in the global economy. We are bringing 1,400 business leaders together in this Business Forum at the time that all eyes are on Europe, and we need to see Europe emerge from its discussions and talks with a credible plan for action on sovereign debt problems.</p>
<p>So my address will be very focussed on the need to see action in Europe to address sovereign debt issues and to address banking issues.</p>
<p>HOST: How vulnerable is Australia to the European debt crisis?</p>
<p>PM: The Treasurer and I have consistently said we're not immune. We have a very resilient economy, we've come out of the global financial crisis strong and we're in that part of the world that continues to grow, so for example in this great State of Western Australia with so much mining activity, you're seeing that mining activity because demand from China and other countries in our region continues to be strong.</p>
<p>We do have a resilient economy, but we're not immune from global events and we are putting the pressure on European leaders to stop muddling through and to get their house in order.</p>
<p>HOST: Will Australia be one of the countries to refinance Europe?</p>
<p>PM: Well, first and foremost we need European leaders to emerge with a credible plan to address sovereign debt and to recapitalise their banks. I know that there is discussion in newspapers today about an injection of funds into the International Monetary Fund. You only get to that stage if Europe emerges with a credible plan to address its economic woes.</p>
<p>HOST: Prime Minister, this CHOGM meeting, what does it have to achieve to restore the belief that CHOGM actually matters?</p>
<p>PM: I believe the Commonwealth does matter. It's a unique grouping of nations bound together by history, but bound together, too, by shared values  -  values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and over its lifetime the Commonwealth has been very active in the advocacy of those values and addressing issues like apartheid in South Africa.</p>
<p>So those values are enduring, but like any organisation the Commonwealth needs to keep reforming and changing to meet modern demands, and of course reform and change are on the agenda for discussion when leaders meet over the weekend.</p>
<p>HOST: And what do you make of the fact that Melbourne lawyer Rob Stary is seeking to have action taken against the Sri Lankan President and have him face possible war crimes charges? This often cuts to the core of, when we talk about fundamental and shared values, it's a statement everyone makes, but there are some very, very important issues at the heart of this, aren't there?</p>
<p>PM: Yes, there are. On the direct question you raise, no such legal action can be taken on an issue like this without the consent of the Attorney-General, and the Attorney-General hasn't received any request in relation to this matter, so that's on the direct question you raise.</p>
<p>On the broader issue about human rights, Australia and like-minded countries have been urging and will continue to urge Sri Lanka to address the serious allegations that have been made of human rights violations during the end stages of the conflict in Sri Lanka, and we will continue to do that.</p>
<p>HOST: My guest the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard  -  1300 222 720 is the number to call.</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you touched very briefly on mining and the Financial Review is saying today that your mining tax has hit an 11th-hour hurdle. Exactly when will you introduce it to the Parliament?</p>
<p>PM: We are working very cooperatively with representatives of the mining industry. The approach that we've taken is to work with them on every detail of the legislation. We're still engaged in that process so that we can deliver the agreement that I stuck with some of Australia's most major mining companies, so we'll keep productively working through and the mining industry has been engaged in those discussions and details are still being worked through.</p>
<p>HOST: The key issue seems to be the point at which the tax will cut in. That's what all the miners want to know. Can you tell us, are you seeking to redraft it because of concerns that you won't make enough money from it?</p>
<p>PM: We will deliver the agreement that I entered into with the biggest mining companies in the middle of last year. I've deliberately taken the approach here that we wanted to work every step of the way in consultation with the mining industry, and we're continuing to do that in what has been a very, very constructive set of engagements.</p>
<p>HOST: What expectation do you have that maybe Indian delegates at CHOGM might attempt to lobby you to end the ban on uranium exports to India?</p>
<p>PM: That may be an issue raised, but the partnership we have with India is a very broad one so whenever I've met representatives of the Indian Government we've had discussions across a broad range of fronts from economic matters and trade partnerships through to education and the number of international students here, as well as the number of Australian universities that are actively working in India, through of course, to discussions of democratic values and participation in the global forums where we work together, particularly the G20.</p>
<p>HOST: Would the message be that for now at least the ban continues?</p>
<p>PM: Look, the position of the Government is as I outlined it yesterday and was outlined as recently as a week ago by the relevant minister, Minister Burke.</p>
<p>HOST: You're listening to the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. Our talk back number - 1300 222 720 if you'd like to comment on any of what you've heard so far.</p>
<p>You've just touched on the phrase âdemocratic values', and I wonder what you think about the Occupy movement. It began in Wall Street, it moved to Sydney and Melbourne and now it's come to Perth.</p>
<p>PM: People have a right to protest. Of course, the protest must be peaceful and people need to obey all of the instructions of the police, so that's my general view on people raising any issue in a protest.</p>
<p>More broadly, I understand that working people in this country and in the nations of the world want to make sure that the economy is working to provide dividends to them, and that's my focus as Prime Minister. We want a strong and prosperous economy so we can offer people the benefits of jobs right around the country - not just in one industry or one region, but in a diverse and resilient economy that offers opportunity for all; and that we have an education system, an apprenticeship system, a university system that also gives people those opportunities; and at the same time we're making sure we're providing services families need and individuals need so they're not at risk of being left behind because they face a health care issue or a disability.</p>
<p>HOST: Well, Prime Minister, as the Prime Minister of the host nation, do you have a message to those who will see CHOGM as an opportunity to protest?</p>
<p>PM: Well, my message to anyone who is contemplating protesting about any issue is: we live in a wonderful, peaceful democracy and that gives people the opportunity to have their voice heard including by attending a protest if they choose to do so, but of course we want that democracy, our wonderful democracy, to always be a peaceful one and that applies to protesting as well.</p>
<p>HOST: Four Corners last night declared the Curtin Detention Centre the worst in the country and your Immigration Minister told the program it would be the first to close when detention numbers are reduced. So, when will you close it?</p>
<p>PM: We've worked hard to make sure that we are dealing with detention issues in a way that offers appropriate services, like mental health services, and we have stepped up the mental health services for people who are in detention. We've also moved to community detention models because we were concerned, and I believe many Australians were also concerned, about the circumstances of kids being held in high-security detention. People would remember the images under the Howard Government of kids literally being behind razor wire and we-</p>
<p>HOST: -You also have to accept that people have this very strong perception that there was a possibility that kids would be sent from Christmas Island to Malaysia under the Malaysian solution, so is it a bridge too far for you to be suggesting it was the previous government that sought to incarcerate children or not look after their well being when your own Government is being roundly accused of the same thing?</p>
<p>PM: Well, the only thing I've just said then is a simple statement of fact - children were held in high-security detention under the Howard Government, so nothing changes that fact, that is a fact, and, motivated to see change, we created the community detention model and we have moved families with children into community detention. Now, of course we have announced in the last few weeks that we will also make more use of bridging visas, so after mandatory detention for health and security and identity checks people will be able to live in the community-</p>
<p>HOST: -And that's a very interesting point, of course, and I wonder just how soon will the people on those boats picked up in recent days in Australian waters, once those checks are passed, how soon will they be living in the community?</p>
<p>PM: Checks have to be made, and the length of time for checks depends on individual cases. The Minister for Immigration has been clear - we do have spare capacity in our detention system but we will be looking to make continued use of and more use of community detention and bridging visas.</p>
<p>HOST: Prime Minister, does the defeat of your Migration Act amendment mean that whatever blame is apportioned when the next boat is set to arrive in Australian water, whatever blame between you and Mr Abbott, this is the new reality, that offshore processing is dead?</p>
<p>PM: There's just two simple truths here. Number one: Mr Abbott and the Opposition have destroyed the ability of this country to process asylum seekers offshore. Number two: with that done by Mr Abbott we will continue to appropriately manage Australia's borders and our detention system in a way that protects our borders and also protects our values of compassion.</p>
<p>HOST: Enjoy CHOGM, thanks for talking to us.</p>
<p>PM: Thank you very much.</p>
