    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />CHECK &amp; GAINST DELIVERY. EMAGEZUTLDLIVERY<br />PRINZ MINISTER'S OPENING STATEMENT<br />SPECIAL PREMIEKRS' CONPERENCE<br />BRISBANE 30 OCTOBER 1990<br />At the outset, let me thank each of you for the very<br />positive way in which you have responded to the call I<br />made in July for a new approach and a new process to<br />achieve a closer partnership within our Federal<br />Constitution. Your positive response as individuals and as leaders of<br />your Governments is the key element, the vital spark,<br />in giving life and direction to the historic process we<br />are inaugurating together today.<br />The contacts I have had with each of you in recent weeks,<br />parallel with the preparatory work of our officials, and<br />your response, encourage me immensely.<br />our agreed goal can be simply stated in this last<br />decade of the first century of the Australian Federation,<br />to make the Federation work better.<br />I believe we are agreed that the purpose of setting such<br />a goal is to improve our national efficiency and<br />international competitiveness and to improve the delivery<br />and quality of the services we provide as governments for<br />the people of Australia.<br />And we are agreed, I believe, that our first task is to<br />move by sensible, practical, achievable steps to get<br />better co-operation within the existing framework of the<br />Federal Constitution.<br />Those means and ends are easily enough stated.<br />Yet we know from the experience of ninety years how hard<br />it is to achieve even modest change and reform and I<br />speak here not of the Constitution itself, but of change<br />and reform in the way we do things, the way we govern<br />ourselves under our Federal 4system.</p>
<p>BUt your reaponto co far convincee me that never has the<br />time been so propitious as indeed, it has never been so<br />urgent and compelling for a new effort, a new approach<br />and a new spirit of co-operation.<br />An important objective for this first special Conference<br />is to reach broad agreement on a set of principles, as a<br />clear guide for future action in the key areas under<br />review. Those areas which we are looking at today cover the full<br />range of inter-governmental relationships: the general<br />financial arrangements; tied grants: micro-economic<br />reform; duplication of services; the environment; and<br />industrial relations.<br />To set principles and clear courses for action over such<br />a breadth of areas in itself is a major challenge for<br />this Conference.<br />It would mean a very serious resolve and very substantial<br />commitment by us all on behalf of our respective<br />governments, and on our own behalf as the elected leaders<br />of this nation.<br />In the Commonwealth's case, the adoption of the<br />principles before us would in some areas involve an<br />historic change of course in the way the Federal system<br />has developed over the last ninety years.<br />One such instance is the matter of tied grants. The<br />commitment I am prepared to make on the Commonwealth's<br />behalf to work with the States towards a substantial<br />reduction in tied grants represents a fundamnental. shift<br />in direction. But we are prepared to make this<br />commitment as an earnest of our determination to work<br />genuinely and sincerely with the States to create a<br />closer federal partnerohip.<br />I cannot emphasise too strongly the need for us all to<br />move our thinking beyond old fixed ideas of centralism or<br />State rights of the Commonwealth versus the States. I<br />believe the people we represent expect us to rise above<br />that. The guiding test for everything we do here should<br />be: what is best for all our citizens, our fellow<br />Australians. Our officials have worked hard to prepare the ground for<br />this meeting.<br />But officials can advance the work only so far.<br />This Conference is the critical stage in the process<br />the catalyst for change.</p>
<p>3.<br />S We alone, as the elected leaders, as the responsible<br />heads of government, can make the commitment the<br />commitment of personal and political will to create,<br />guide and invigorate the process towards a better, more<br />effective, Federal system and through it, a better<br />Australia. If we now make that commitment and I do so<br />unequivocally then I am convinced we will be able to<br />meet the just expectations of the people we have the<br />privilege to represent, not just for the two days of this<br />Conference, but for this crucial decade in the history of<br />Australia. I look forward to a co-operative approach from all of us<br />in this first meeting and in the work ahead.</p>
