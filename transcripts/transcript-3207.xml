PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE,<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
8 APRIL 1974<br />
Opening statement by the Prime Minister.<br />
The people of Australia should be very clear about how,<br />
why and by whom their country has been suddenly plunged into a grave<br />
and unprecedented Constitutional crisis. Beyond all the manoeuvring<br />
and mud-slinging of the last week, one basic fact lies behind this<br />
crisis: a group of Senators elected in 1967 and 1970 proposes to<br />
deny the Australian Government, elected for three years in 1972, the<br />
right to govern and the power to govern.<br />
Money is the sinews of Government. The taxpayers' control<br />
over their money through their elected representatives is the foundation<br />
of parliamentary democracy. Under our Westminster system, this control<br />
is firmly lodged in the Lower House the people's House.<br />
It is precisely for this reason that, in Australia, whichever<br />
party has the majority in the House of Representatives forms the<br />
Government of Australia,<br />
It is precisely for this reason that the Australian<br />
Constitution sets rigorous limits upon the powers of the Senate to<br />
amend money bills.<br />
Now, a group of Senators is proposing to reject Bills<br />
approved by the people's House which would enable the elected<br />
Government to carry out its program and carry on the business of<br />
Government. This has never before happened in Australia. It is a<br />
step fraught with the very gravest implications for democratic<br />
Government in Australia. It strikes at the roots of the Australian<br />
democratic system. It is fraught with the gravest implications for<br />
the Senate itself.<br />
It is precisely because of these grave implications that<br />
responsible political leaders of all Australian parties have hitherto<br />
rejected such a proposition out of hand.<br />
The situation whereby one party controls the House of<br />
Representatives the Government and another party controls the<br />
Senate is by no means unusual in Australia. What is absolutely new<br />
is that an Opposition should attempt to use an outdated majority in<br />
the Senate to deny the elected Government the money it needs to carry<br />
out its program. Not until the election of a Labor Government, after 23 years<br />
of coalition rule, has such a course been threatened. Why?<br />
Not until the present leadership of the coalition arrayed<br />
against the elected government has any elected Australian Government<br />
been held up to continuing ransom by this threat of denying it the<br />
money it must have to govern. Why? / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
They have already done this 4 times. They threatened it<br />
in April a year ago. They threatened it in October. Again in November<br />
they threatened to deny all Australian schools the vastly increased<br />
sums of money the Australian Government is making available. And now<br />
again they are threatening to reject Bills needed to pay Australian<br />
Public Servants, needed to provide pre-school education child care,<br />
to assist the States with health programs, to help child migrant<br />
education, to assist the States with the cost of home care services,<br />
to give relief in connection with the recent national disasters, to<br />
promote apprenticeship training, to give assistance for isolated<br />
children, needed to give emergency help to the apple and pear industry.<br />
The Government was elected to carry out a program. The<br />
Liberals, the Country Party, the have combined and conspired<br />
in the Senate to deny it the money to carry it out.<br />
There are two basic questions the people are entitled to<br />
have answered. Why has responsible leadership of all Australian<br />
parties always hitherto rejected this course? And why is the present<br />
Opposition leadership prepared even to contemplate so unprecedented and<br />
perilous a course?<br />
The reason why a responsible Senate must, at all times,<br />
exercise the utmost restraint but above all exercise restraint on<br />
legislation dealing with the Taxpayers' money has been splendidly put<br />
by Sir Robert Menzies. He was writing in 1968 about what would happen<br />
if the Senate were to stand on technical legality but use mere numbers<br />
to reject measures approved by the House of Representatives.<br />
Sir Robert Menzies said:<br />
" This would create an impossible situation and<br />
would make popular government unworkable"....<br />
" It would be a falsification of democracy if on<br />
any matter of government policy approved by the<br />
House of Representatives, possibly by a large<br />
majority, the Senate representing the States<br />
and not the people, could reverse the decision....<br />
otherisTe a Senate Opposition whose party had just<br />
been completely defeated at a general election<br />
would be in command of the Government of the nation.<br />
This would be absurd, as a denial of popular<br />
democracy."<br />
That was Sir Robert Menzies' principle in 1968. He states exactly<br />
what is now happening in Canberra. There could be no clearer statement<br />
on the principle now at stake. There could be no clearer evidence<br />
of the decline in the standards and principles of Sir Robert Menzies'<br />
successors. What a falling off was there, my countrymen. Why then<br />
have his successors turned their backs on the principles of their<br />
former leader, their founder? Why are they proposing this<br />
falsification of democracy?<br />
Let me put the events of last week in their proper perspective.<br />
An election for half the Senate is due to replace that half of the<br />
Senate elected in 1967. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Of course among those Senators up for election are those who<br />
have been involved in a course of unparalleled obstruction of legislation<br />
the people elected us to implement. They have prevented us introducing<br />
universal health insurance. They have prevented us enacting industrial<br />
legislation designed to reduce industrial disputes. They have held up<br />
our legislation on restrictive trade practices and monopolies and<br />
consumer protection crucial in our fight against inflation. They have<br />
stalled in order to sabotage our plans to increase the effectiveness<br />
of the Australian Industry Development Corporation. Last week they<br />
rejected the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill our basic<br />
instrument for ensuring the effective development of our energy and<br />
mineral resources and to maximise the ownership and control of those<br />
resources by Australians. They have even rejected our proposal for<br />
a Federal Superior Court, a proposition first advanced by no less an<br />
authority than the Chief Justice, Sir Garfield Barwick. Now this is<br />
not particularly a Labor measure. A Bill to set up a Superior Court<br />
was introduced in 1968 by a former Liberal Attorney-General, now<br />
Mr Justice Bowen. In his second reading speech, he said:<br />
" Since 1961, a very considerable amount of work has<br />
been done, first by Sir Garfield Barwick as<br />
Attorney-General, then by the present Minister for<br />
Immigration ( Mr Snedden) when he was Attorney-General<br />
I mention this to illustrate the pettiness, the meanness,<br />
the mindlessness, the bloddy mindedness of it all. They rejected Bills<br />
to enable us to put to the people referendum proposals to enhance<br />
Australia's democratic processes that is, if they had had their<br />
way they would not even allow the people of Australia to have the<br />
chance of passing an opinion on these proposals.<br />
The Senate elections due next month would allow the people<br />
to pass their judgement on this record of obstruction. Yet the<br />
complexities and complications of Senate elections are such that no<br />
party, neither the Government nor the Opposition, can be reasonably<br />
assured of gaining a majority in the Senate. It was therefore my duty<br />
to consider all means, consistent with propriety and the national<br />
interest to reduce the instability built into this situation.<br />
Last * Tuesday I announced the appointment of Mr Gair, who had<br />
been last elected to the Senate in November 1970, as our Ambassador<br />
to Ireland. The effect of Mr Gair accepting this appointment was to<br />
create an additional Senate vacancy to be elected by the people of<br />
Queensland next month. That was its sole political effect and,<br />
politically, its sole intention, to give the people of Queensland an<br />
opportunity to elect 6 Senators instead of just 5; not, be it noted,<br />
to give any person, party, or Parliament the power to decide who would<br />
represent Queensland in the Senate, but to give the people of Queensland<br />
the opportunity to have their say. By contrast, the Premier of<br />
Queensland has tried to forestall that possibility to deny that<br />
opportunity by himself nominating a replacement for Mr Gair. He has<br />
said in effect, that the party representation in the Senate should<br />
reflect what the people of Queensland thought in 1970, not what they may<br />
think or decide themselves in 1974.<br />
There is one remarkable aspect of this matter. For all the<br />
bombast of the past week, no-one in the Opposition has had the temerity<br />
to state that the new Ambassador to Ireland is unfit to hold the post.<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
So what is the objection? Not surely, that a serving<br />
Member of Parliament was appointed to a diplomatic post or an office<br />
of profit under the Crown. I have here a list which shows countless<br />
such appointments by our predecessors.<br />
Is the objection that the Ambassador is not of my political<br />
persuasion? Was I wrong therefore to confirm Mr Gordon Freeth, a<br />
defeated Liberal Minister, or Dame Annabelle Rankin, a former Queensland<br />
Liberal Senator, in their posts in Tokyo and Wellington when I became<br />
Prime Minister? If someone will say plainly that the Ambassador is unfit<br />
for the post, I imagine Mr Gair will take his recourse at law.<br />
In the meantime, I can only conjecture that the Opposition believes<br />
that a man who was fit enough to maintain them in power for a generation,<br />
a man who was fit enough to exercise decisive influence on both the<br />
home and foreign policies of their administration, is somehow unfit to<br />
represent this country in Ireland.'<br />
So we come to this; Senators who have indulged in deliberate<br />
obstruction of the elected Government, its program, its mandate, now<br />
propose the ultimate obstruction refusal of the money needed to carry<br />
on the people's business. When the Liberals discussed such a course<br />
last October, the President of the Senate himself, the distinguished<br />
Sir Magnus Cormack A Liberal warned his colleagues that they would<br />
be committing suicide. What he meant, what he well understood, was<br />
that the people of Australia would never forget or forgive so blatant<br />
and fundamental a denial of democracy, a falsification of democracy,<br />
as Sir Robert Menzies puts it; and that sooner or later the people<br />
themselves would choose to destroy an institution which had proved<br />
itself so irresponsible, so potent an instrument for the destruction<br />
of Australian democracy. I think Sir Magnus Cormack is correct in<br />
his judgement. If he is, then Senators are proposing to sign the<br />
death warrant of the Senate. However that may be, they must not be<br />
allowed to sign the death warrant of Australian democracy. This is<br />
what Liberal members of integrity like Mr Killen and Mr Hamer are<br />
concerned about that the control of the people's money must rest in<br />
the people's House, that the people's House should be answerable to the<br />
people about the spending of their money, and that their money should<br />
not be at the disposal of the pressure groups and the monied interests,<br />
notably foreign monied interests, to whom these Senators and their<br />
leaders, their parties are so acutely responsive and, indeed, indebted.<br />
Mark these words:<br />
" They have refused to recognise the umpire's decision.<br />
They have used their Senate majority to slow down the<br />
machinery of Government. They have done violence to<br />
our legislative program. What we ask for is a fair<br />
chance to carry out our policy in the sound Australian<br />
phrase, a fair go."<br />
Again, these are not my words; they are the words of<br />
Sir Robert Menzies, at the double dissolution in 1951. </p>
