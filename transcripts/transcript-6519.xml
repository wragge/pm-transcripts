PRIME MINISTER<br />
ALP LUNCH LAUNCESTON, 23 OCTOBER 1984<br />
E. O. E. PROOF ONLY let me say that having dealt with those two<br />
issues of direct importance to the people of Launceston and<br />
this region, that I would like to spend some time now in talking<br />
with you about what has emerged as a fundamentally important<br />
issue in this campaign in the light of yesterday's release<br />
by Mr Peacock and Mr Howard of their so--called Tax Policy.<br />
We have been told as Australian citizens over the last 18 months<br />
that the Liberal and the Nationa. Party would produce a tax policyas<br />
part of their general economic policy. And so, we were all<br />
I believe waiting breathlessly, for some detailed exposition of<br />
this policy. Now, of course we have all been disappointed because<br />
the policy is exceptionally short on detailed exposition. But,<br />
it is not short, if I may put it this way on basic concept and<br />
philosophy. And I want today, here with you, to spend some time<br />
in analysing with you what that basic concept and philosophy is,<br />
what the economic implications are for every Australian, and<br />
I will be doing this together with my friend, Paul Keating over the<br />
days ahead. People of Australia are entitled in these next few days<br />
to have a concentration of attention of analysis by us, the<br />
Government, by the media, on these proposals of the Opposition.<br />
And I certainly intend to undertake my -responsibility to the<br />
people of Australia, to analyse with them, these implications.<br />
Now, let me say at the outset that what is basically clear<br />
as to the concept and intention of Mr Peacock and Mr Howard<br />
is that there shall be a substitution to a considerable extent<br />
from direct tax, income tax on some people towards significant<br />
increases in indirect tax for everyone. Now, that's the essence<br />
of what they are about. We are entitled therefore to ask<br />
ourselves precisely what this means. Now the first thing that<br />
I want to say to all of you to every concerned Australian, is<br />
that what this necessarily means is a significant increase in<br />
inflation. What we did in Government, and I put this by way of<br />
background, is that our great contribution has been that in a<br />
very short period of time, relatively, to-break the vicious cycle<br />
of inflation, wages chasing prices'which meant further inflation<br />
which had afflicted the Australian economy through the period<br />
of conservative rule. Whenever the economy had got moving,<br />
when there was sudden growth, then it broke down through inflation<br />
which was fuelled by wage demands of unions wanting to see that<br />
the increase in prices which had taken place under their'<br />
unco-ordinated policies of the conservatives, would pick up iLn<br />
wages. Now we broke, that vicious circle. I remind you of the .2 </p>
<p>P. M.: cont.. facts. When we camne to office in March. 1983, this<br />
country was on it's economic knees. We had the worst -Irecession<br />
since the great depression of the 1930' s. But, it wasn't a<br />
recession with* an oppressed level of economic activity like the<br />
great depression in one respect.-because remember then, that there<br />
was no inflation. But, with the conservatives of these latter<br />
days we had the-worst of all worlds.-We had recession and very"<br />
high levels of inflation. We inherited 11.2% inflation, and that<br />
was about twice the average of the rest of the world. So you had<br />
soaring unemployment, jobs disappearing, economic growth had<br />
gone, economic stagnation, but inflation had doubled the rate of<br />
the rest of the world. And it had that, because you didn ' t have<br />
co-ordinated economic policy planning. You didn't have planning<br />
which co-ordinated wages policy, tax policy, general Budget policy,<br />
general macro-economic policy. And because you had this lack of<br />
co-ordination you had the worst 6f all possible worlds. And<br />
particularly you've had high and rising inflation. And that was<br />
their pattern. Everytime it had any sign of recovery, it broke<br />
down with this break-out of wages chasing prices and inflation<br />
going up.<br />
Now, let me remind you in this respect, of the views that was3<br />
very explicitly put to the people of Australia quite recently<br />
by Mr Howard. Mr Howard in 1981 addressed himself to this question<br />
of the impact of increases in indirect taxation upon the inflationary<br />
situation. I read to you from what Mr Howard said in the<br />
House of Representatives on 12 March 1981. It referred to practical<br />
difficulties. It said important, though his practical difficultie<br />
future revenue considerations were.-the fundamental reason<br />
for the Government's decision was it's concern at the impact on<br />
inflation and inflationary expectations in any significant shift<br />
towards greater reliance on indirect taxation. And that's pretty<br />
clear. No qualification about it. Let me read it to you again.<br />
The fundamental reason for the Government's decision was it's<br />
concern at the impact on inflation and inflationary expectations<br />
on any significant shift towards greater reliance on indirect<br />
taxation. And yet that's what the very essence is, of what they<br />
unleashed upon Australia. yesterday. Mr Howard went on, and I'll<br />
just read this final sentence in this section of his speech to the<br />
House of Representatives. He said therefore, and despite obvious<br />
advantages from many other points of view, the : Government came<br />
firmly to the conclusion that the inevitable squandering of the<br />
gains made and the maintained in the fight against, inflation in<br />
recent years was a price it was not prepared to pay. Now, I ask<br />
you and I will be asking all Australian citizens to ponder what<br />
Mr Peacock and Mr Howard are now saying out of their own mouths,<br />
they are prepared to do to the people of Australia in;: the light<br />
of that exposition. Mr Howard,, unequivocal in March 1981, that<br />
if you had any sort of concern about inflation, then you had<br />
to be certain that you didn't move to a significant increase in:<br />
indirect tax, because that would mean further.' inflation.<br />
He was right. Of course, what wei~ t further wrong however was,<br />
that in the period after 1981, they steadfastly refused to adopt<br />
a range of economic policies that would contain inflation any rate.<br />
They refused to have any wages policy at all. They tried then,<br />
right in that period,. 1981. Right in the middle of that period<br />
they abandoned any wages policy at all, for centralised wages<br />
system. They said, let's throw it open, let the trade unions<br />
and the employers of Australia fight one another. Let the .13 </p>
<p>P. M. cont. unions use their power. Let the employers use their'<br />
power and let prices in the market, incl. uding the'price for ' Labour<br />
be determined by that process. And that's why by the time we<br />
came to office by the beginning of 1983 you had inflation at<br />
double the rate of the rest of the world. Now, what you have<br />
therefore yesterday, delivered to the people of Australia,<br />
as a so-called tax policy was not a policy at all, it was a<br />
nebulous paper which was no substitute for policy at all. It was<br />
a real pig in a poke. We will vaguely say that we will cut<br />
direct taxes by increasing indirect taxes, directly against the<br />
specific warning that Mr Howard had properly given in 1981.<br />
Of course, as it quite clear, it had no relationship to general<br />
economic policy at all. Let me Just br: Lefly again refer to the<br />
opening portions of Mr Howard's speech in March 1981 when he<br />
then did seem to realize the relaitionship between. tax policy and<br />
general economic policy.<br />
This was what he had to say in the early stages of his speech in<br />
March 1981. He said this, and I ask you as I will be asking<br />
every Australian man and woman between now and 1 March, to<br />
understand this. This is the truth according to Howard in 1981.<br />
I quote him: " The taxation system is -an integral part of our<br />
economic structure. As such tax changes cannot take place in a<br />
vacuum. Taxation", he said, " government spending and budget<br />
deficits and inflation", he had them all " taxation, government<br />
spending, budget deficits and inflation are all directly<br />
connected. Coping with them is part and parcel of the task of<br />
running a modern economy." He said this: " the Government's views<br />
on taxation cannot be divorced and are not divorced from its,<br />
underlying philosophy". And he concluded that section by saying:<br />
" Unless taxation changes are consistent with and achievable<br />
within the existing economic framework, they will frustrate rather<br />
than serve the Government's economic objectives."<br />
Now let me spell out the implication and the truth of what<br />
Mr Howard was then saying. Hle points at this nebulous bit of<br />
paper on Australia yesterday as though that was some significant<br />
self-contained statement about taxation. But it was nothing of<br />
the kind. It had no details, but it was totally unrelated t~ o<br />
the broad areas of economic policy as he had said in March J. 981,<br />
any tax policy had to be.<br />
Now let me spell out to you as citizens, not in terms of<br />
sophisticated esoteric economic analysis, but in simple<br />
straightforward terms which explain what that policy would rmean<br />
for Australia if misguidedly the Australian people were to begin<br />
to give them the chance of implementing~ it.<br />
There would firstly be a situation in wrhich. a minority of the<br />
people through income splitting would gfet an income tax reduction.<br />
The great other sector of the Australian people would get none,<br />
but all of us, including those who got th e dirpct tax cuts and<br />
those who didn't, would be immediately faced with a significant<br />
increase in the tax they paid as a result of the increases iLn<br />
indirect tax.<br />
But what would happen then? Once you had the increases in<br />
indirect tax, prices would rise. Naturally that is what<br />
follows. That is what Mr Howard said in 1981. That is why then<br />
the then government decided against that approach. </p>
<p>What happens then when prices go up. Then naturally the<br />
trade union movement, as it historically has done, moves to<br />
have compensation through way of wage increases for that<br />
increase in prices. And so you get the wage price spiral<br />
which inevitably produces that higher level of inflation.<br />
And there is no way and this is what must be understood by<br />
each and every Australian there is no way that a conservati. ve<br />
government would have any basis of negotiation with the trade<br />
union movement to prevent that wages out-burst.<br />
The distinguishing feature of your government today, ladies<br />
and gentlemen, is that we have achieved -an historic accord with<br />
the trade union movement which allows the condition in respect<br />
of pay and other conditions of ernployment to be satisfied at<br />
times other than by simply looking at money wage increases.<br />
And that is relevant to our realistic tax policy, the benefits<br />
of which will be going to the pockets of all Australian taxpayers<br />
in the next few days.<br />
You are going to Tt the largest real tax: cut that Australians<br />
have had for very many years. The figures I repeat they<br />
should be clearly in every Australian's mind that if we had<br />
given you a tax cut which was only necessary to cover you for<br />
inflation which had brought in bracket creep -the costs of that<br />
in a full year would have been $ 1.3 billion -the cost of the<br />
tax cut, the benefit of which you will soon be getting, will be<br />
$ 2.1 billion. Now that is what we have done, and that is<br />
equivalent to an $ 11 a week wage increase and that has been an<br />
issue which has been worked out in consultation not only with<br />
the trade union movement by this government, but also in<br />
discussion with broader sections of the community.<br />
But Mr Howard and Mr Peacock have said they will smash the Accord<br />
no consultations. That is not on. I go back to this business of<br />
saying, let the fight take place in the market place. If the<br />
fight takes place in the market place then that * means, as I say,<br />
wages, chasing prices, higher inflation.<br />
So Mr Howard was right in 1981 when he said tax policy must be<br />
related to the-whole panoply of economic management and the<br />
great mistake they made yesterday is to believe that the<br />
Australian people are going to buy a return to the misery of the<br />
past, to the unco-ordinated policies of the past which brought<br />
this great country to its economic knees, where we had the<br />
worst recession since the 1930' s, stagnation. Now it is no<br />
accident that we turned that round. WE: turned it round with<br />
your co-operation, with the co-operation of the whole community,<br />
and particularly through its great orgarnisations, the business<br />
organisations and the trade unions.<br />
And we realised the truth. And you, the peopl'e of Australia,<br />
accepted it that if you are going to turn the economy round<br />
then you have got to co-operate and consult together and have<br />
integrated policies, your tax policy related to your budget<br />
strategy, related to your wages policy. </p>
<p>In the result, Australia has turned around from recession to<br />
having in the last twelve months the highest rate of economic<br />
growth in the world has turned around from having double the<br />
inflation rate of the rest of the world to a position where<br />
now we as Australians can boast the fact that our inflation<br />
rate has been more than halved and brought back in current<br />
underlying terms to somewhat less than the world average.<br />
We have turned it round from a loss of 200,000 jobs, an increase<br />
of a quarter of a million in unemployment, to a reduction in<br />
unemployment, and an increase of 260,000 jobs.<br />
To interest rates having been brought down and all that<br />
happened, my friends, because you, the Aus'tralian people, not<br />
just as individuals, but through your organisation, the business<br />
men and women, and as workers in thle trade union movement,<br />
decided rightly with us that the time has come to do two thi'ngs.-<br />
to work together rather than fighting one another to put<br />
Australia first in that sense and because you accepted the<br />
truth of what we were saying that you had to ha ye integrated<br />
policies tax policy integrated with budgetary strategy, government<br />
spending and the like.<br />
Now, there is one other aspect that I want to go to and that is<br />
that Mr Howard said in what will now become that famous speech of<br />
12 March 1981 he said I remind you, he said this: " The<br />
Government's views on taxation can not be divorced, and are not<br />
divorced from its underlying philosophy".<br />
Well that is true, and that underlying philosophy of the<br />
conservatives came through yesterday. Because according to<br />
my Treasurer's calculations, not disputed by Mr Howard last nig~ ht<br />
on the program they shared together I would stand, at my level<br />
of income as Prime Minister I would stand to benefit by $ 66 a<br />
week to me out of this philosophy of the conservatives and thait<br />
would b~ e paid for by the relatively lower income people in this<br />
country. Now we just don't happen to believe that if we are going to ha-ve<br />
a cohesive society which is going to continue to work together<br />
to produce the great e ! conomic results that we have under this<br />
government, you are going to continue to do that if Prime Ministers<br />
should get $ 66 a week cuts out of a tax policy while people lower<br />
down the list, not only get nothing, many of them, but would in<br />
fact in net terms be worse off because of the significant increase<br />
in tax they have paid . through the increase! s in indirect taxes.<br />
So my friends I repudiate, and I believe you will repudiate, a:.-Id<br />
I believe the overwhelming majority of Australians will repudiate<br />
this nonsense, this regressive backward, unacceptable philosop'h. y<br />
which was put to the people of Australia yesterday. It will<br />
mean as I say, inevitably a return to the days<br />
inflation which made our economy uncompetfitive, , fhich produced<br />
economic stagnation, which produced lo'ss of jobs, and inflation<br />
at double world levels. / 6 </p>
<p>Under the approach of this Government we have shown that<br />
tax policy must be integrated with economic Policy generally<br />
and we are not and I believe you are not going to accept<br />
that return to the unacceptable days of the past.<br />
My friends, I have taken some time in dealing with that issue!<br />
because I believe that you as concerned Australians want to<br />
know what it is that has happened in the past. I have explained<br />
that to you. I think you share our pride in the fact that<br />
Australia is winning again, that we have turned the economy<br />
round, importantly that we have turned it around together wit~ h<br />
the great elements of Australian society working together<br />
the trade unions, the business, the Stat. local government,<br />
working with the Commonwealth Government.. We have shown tha:<br />
there is a better way to put Australia a~ t the top of the wor: ld's<br />
economic growth table and we have done it in a way which combines<br />
economic efficiency with a consideration of equity.<br />
I believe it is appropriate that under the tax cuts that will<br />
be coming in in a few days time that I only receive about $ 2 and<br />
a bit, whereas the average wage and salary earner in this country<br />
will be receiving $ 7.60. 1 think that you think that that is<br />
fair. I certainly think it is fair. Anid I think it is totally<br />
unacceptable philosophy that the alternative should be that : I<br />
should get something like $ 66 a week increase out of the new<br />
social tax policy and people lower down the level would not only<br />
not get a tax cut but in net terms would be worse off.<br />
That is not the way you create a cohesive society. That is not<br />
the way you get Australians working together. That is not the<br />
way you have Australians winning as it is now under this<br />
Government. So, my friends, ( tape ends) </p>
