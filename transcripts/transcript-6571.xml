EMBARGOED AGAINSTI k CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
DELIVv9RY SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT DINNER IN HONOUR OF<br />
PRIME MINISTER NAKASONE OF JAPAN, CANBERRA, 15 JANUARY 1985<br />
Prime Minister Nakasone<br />
Your visit to Australia and the South Pacific is of<br />
, great importance to-us an'-I would like to extend a very<br />
warm welcome to you, your family and to the members of your<br />
party on behalf of all Australians.<br />
Over the past three decades, the relationship between<br />
Australia and Japan has become vital to both of us.<br />
Our economies are inter-dependent. Our governments are<br />
linked by a network of consultative arrangements.<br />
At the same time, friendship, mutual respect and<br />
understanding between Australians and Japanese have also<br />
developed greatly.<br />
You and I, Yasu, are particularly fortunate that our<br />
daughters, Michiko and Susan, are able, as a result of their<br />
personal experiences of each other's country, to help us<br />
understand our respective peoples' aspirations and hopes for<br />
the future. This would have have seemed remarkable to, our<br />
predecessors not so long ago.<br />
We regret that your stay in Australia cannot be longer.<br />
We are pleased however that you will have the opportu~ nity to<br />
visit not only Canberra but also Sydney, Melbourne, and to<br />
see something of Australia outside our capital cities.<br />
Today we have a had broad range of discussions covering<br />
global, regional and bilateral issues.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, nothing is more important to the<br />
Australian and Japanese people and to our governments than<br />
the prevention of nuclear war and the advancement of the<br />
cause of nuclear disarmament. We have discussed these<br />
issues again today and find ourselves in total agreement on<br />
them. There is a need and indeed an imperative for countries<br />
such as Japan and Australia to work together in the cause of<br />
peace and make our views heard by the superpowers.<br />
We must press with all the influence at our disposal<br />
for progress in this critical area. The recent agreement in<br />
Geneva between the superpowers to re-open negotiations on </p>
<p>2<br />
the entire range of nuclear and space arms questions is an<br />
encouraging developmient.<br />
We must continue to do what we can to ensure that this<br />
essential dialogue is enduring and productive in lessening<br />
tension and bringing about major reductions in the nuclear<br />
arsenals. Australia is addressing these concerns in all major<br />
disarmament forums.<br />
The creation of a south pacific nuclear free zone,<br />
consistent with Austr * alia's treaty obligations, is a high<br />
priority within our overall policy.<br />
The zone will bear on~ Japanese and Australian interests<br />
in the region. In particular, regional states including<br />
Australia have a continuing strong interest in seeking a<br />
south pacific region free from the use, stationing and<br />
testing of nuclear explosive devices and an ocean<br />
environment not used for the dumping of nuclear waste<br />
products. Both the nuclear free zone proposal and the regional<br />
environmental program work towards this.<br />
Mr Prime-Minister, I have been particularly encouraged<br />
to learn of your Government's desire to respond positively<br />
to the feelings of the countries of the region in these<br />
matters. Our countries also share a critical interest in the<br />
health of the international economy and trading system, and<br />
a parLicular interest in continued strong growth in<br />
production and trade within our own Western Pacific region.<br />
Last year in Tokyo we discussed the benefits that could<br />
be obtained through the successful launching of a new round<br />
of multilateral trade negotiations, and the need for any new<br />
round to address matters of particular importance to the<br />
Western Pacific region.<br />
Today we have reaffirmed our support for an open<br />
international trading system. -Australia shares Japan's<br />
support for a new round of multilateral trade negotiations.<br />
To produce real benefits, such a round must be founded on a<br />
genuine commitment to trade liberalisation by the advanced<br />
countries, including Japan and Australia.<br />
A new round of multilateral trade negotiations based on<br />
a genuine commitment to trade liberalisation would ' address a<br />
number of flaws in the current trading system that have been<br />
particularly damaging to the trading interests of countries </p>
<p>-3<br />
in our region. These flaws include the treatment of<br />
Lgricu'. ture, saftgv'ard measures and tariff escalation.<br />
We believe that consultation and cooperative effort<br />
between Australia and Japan, together with our Western<br />
Pacific neighbours, can enhance the prospects of a<br />
successful new round of negotiations. The Denpasar and<br />
Sydney meetings, in which our senior trade officials<br />
participated, were important parts of that process of<br />
consultatLion. IAustralians and Japanese have also been active in the<br />
exploration and evaluation of wider forms of Pacific<br />
cooperation, through the series of meetings on the Pacific<br />
61; community concept which began with the Canberra seminar<br />
chaired by Sir John Crawford in 1980. Australia has<br />
recently established a national Pacific Cooperation<br />
Committee to facilitate participation in this discussion of<br />
regional cooperation.<br />
Australia and Japan together have a great contribution<br />
to make to the development of the region, and through it to<br />
the wider matrix of global development. I notice that<br />
recent surveys by the New York Conference Board have placed<br />
Japan and Australia at the forefront of economic growth in<br />
the Western World. This is a good basis upon which to build<br />
our relationship and our mutual contribution to development<br />
in our region.<br />
We recognise that we can play effectively our proper<br />
role in our wider region only if we ourselves conduct cur<br />
trade and industry policies, and our relationship with each<br />
other, in ways that are consistent with the principles of an<br />
open muiltilateral trading system.<br />
With this in mind, we today reiterated our commitment<br />
to the expansion and development of trading and economic<br />
relations between our two countries.<br />
We each recognised the progress that has been made<br />
recently in both countries in facilitating trade expansion.<br />
Tomorrow I will explain-more about how the Australian<br />
liberalisation of financial markets, and the removal of<br />
steel import quotas which preceded my visit to Japan a year<br />
ago, have been followed by further commitments to<br />
liberalisation of Australian trade over the past year. Most<br />
important amongst these has been the adoption of a new motor<br />
vehicle plan, through which the Australian industry will<br />
take major steps to strengthen its international<br />
competitiveness as import quotas are gradually and steadily<br />
removed between now and the early 1990s. </p>
<p>-4<br />
Tomorrou's discussion will also extend to the progress<br />
t'at has been made~ to strengthen Australian competitiveness<br />
and reliabil. ity as a supplier across the whole range of our<br />
industry. It is universally recognised that unit production<br />
costs have fallen and industrial relations have improved<br />
greatly throughout the Australian economy over the past two<br />
years. But we recognise that there is room for further<br />
improvement a reality underlined by the disruption of rail<br />
transport in the Hunter Valley.<br />
The Australian Government will continue to work<br />
systematically to improve even further Australia's<br />
, competitiveness and reliability as a supplier.<br />
In developing further the close and cooperative<br />
relations which Australia has with Japan, I know, Prime<br />
Minister, that you personally have taken a position of<br />
active leadership and encouragement in Japan, as I have in<br />
Australia. This has assisted the development of productive<br />
economic relations in many areas.<br />
At the same time, you recognise our concern that the<br />
principles of an open multilateral trading system should<br />
govern relations in all areas of our trade.<br />
You know our worries about the beef trade.<br />
You know also our concerns that pressures from third<br />
countries might at some time in the future stand in the way<br />
of full reflection in our trade of Australia's advantages as<br />
a competitive and reliable supplier of coal.<br />
I welcome your reassurance, Prime Minister, that Japan<br />
will not seek to solve its trade problems wth third<br />
countries at the expense of Australia generally, and<br />
particularly in relation to coal.<br />
We in Australia recognise the changes taking place in<br />
Japan's industrial structure.. These complement structural<br />
changes that will need to occur-in Australia as we continue<br />
our efforts to sustain non-inflationary growth. We<br />
recognise the need to upgrade and diversify our exports to<br />
Japan into manufactures and services. We greatly appreciate<br />
the support of the Japanese Government towards our joint<br />
efforts to achieve this goal, particularly through the<br />
successful high level market survey missions.<br />
We attach great importance to the careful follow-up of<br />
the survey mission's work. </p>
<p>We recognise that we cannot sit back and expect success<br />
come the key m~ ust be the steady application of<br />
Australian initiative and enterprise.<br />
In no way is the goal of diversifying our trade an<br />
alternative to the established trade in commodities.<br />
Continued efforts to develop new areas of trade complement<br />
our efforts to achieve maximum mutual benefit from our vital<br />
commodities trade.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, we have today discussed frankly many<br />
subjects with the knowledge and against the backdrop of the<br />
strong, mature and enduring relationship which exists<br />
between our countries.<br />
* We have much in common : an important economic and<br />
trading relationship which is mutually advantageous to us;<br />
si-milar perceptions of the security and strategic interests<br />
of our region and a commitment to development in the western<br />
pacific region; a growing enthusiasm among our peoples to<br />
know more about each other; an an unequivocal commitment to<br />
parliamentary democracy.<br />
These are the links which bond us together.<br />
Yasu, let us work together to realise the full<br />
potential that good relations between Australia and Japan<br />
can bring to our two peoples and to the world in which we<br />
live. </p>
