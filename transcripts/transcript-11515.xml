<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, good morning to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Steve.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>This McClure report, is an interim report you get the final report in</p>
<p> July, but do you have any quarrel with the broad approach it's proposing?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't have a quarrel with the broad approach it is taking</p>
<p> as an interim report, but we not committed to any of its conclusions and</p>
<p> we'll have a look at the final report. Can I just pick up one thing</p>
<p> in that report we've just seen that is really quite wrong. Work for</p>
<p> the Dole, mutual obligation, is not an American concept, it is an Australian</p>
<p> concept. Work for the Dole was not borrowed from the United States, I</p>
<p> don't believe in the United States' approach to welfare. The</p>
<p> American approach to welfare is to knock people off benefits willy nilly,</p>
<p> and many of those people do turn to crime and literally be begging in</p>
<p> the streets for food, I will never support something like that in Australia.</p>
<p> But I do support in Australia a system that says you help people who need</p>
<p> help, but if they're able to, it is not unfair to ask them to put</p>
<p> something back into the community. Now that is the Australian way. You</p>
<p> know I am not interested in comparisons really, it is an Australian way,</p>
<p> and I think we have got it about right.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Can you guarantee though that if your Government accepts the broad thrust</p>
<p> of the final report that no Australian will be worse off, and that includes.</p>
<p> No, no, no and that includes . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is a terribly hypothetical thing. Look what I can guarantee</p>
<p> is that this is not an exercise to cut welfare.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I saw Wayne Swan, and no doubt Mr Beazley will be out today, saying you</p>
<p> know you are going to cut welfare. The Labor Party and others have been</p>
<p> saying that for four years, we have now been the Government for four years.</p>
<p> We kept the social security safety net intact, we've looked after</p>
<p> the needy, but we have in the interests of the broader community required</p>
<p> people, particularly those looking for work, to put something back. And</p>
<p> I think Work for the Dole has been a stunning success.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Well it is being suggested this morning that if you accept the proposals</p>
<p> that it could add, talking of putting back, it could require the Government</p>
<p> putting in another $50 billion a year, annually. Are you prepared . .</p>
<p> .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we're not going to be putting another $50 billion in annually</p>
<p> and I don't know who suggested that. It sounds crazy. So, let me</p>
<p> knock that over. Look we will continue to provide a strong social security</p>
<p> safety net. All we have is an interim report, it is a recommendation to</p>
<p> the Government, it is not a Government decision. We will get the final</p>
<p> report and then we'll announce our responses, but we have to be courageous</p>
<p> enough as a community to make sure our welfare system is modern and contemporary.</p>
<p> You're balancing two things. People want the needy looked after,</p>
<p> but they don't want an explosion in welfare. And what we've</p>
<p> tried to do, and what this report is designed to do in a modern, contemporary</p>
<p> way is to achieve those two goals.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>You're today going to announce a new indigenous education program.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I am.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>And some are suggesting it's a clever way of getting your Government</p>
<p> off the hook in light of the mandatory sentencing controversy.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I will tell you what it is. It is what I call practical reconciliation.</p>
<p> The real problem of the indigenous in this community still remains that</p>
<p> they are disadvantaged compared with the rest of us in things like education,</p>
<p> health and job opportunities. And reconciliation to me is all about removing</p>
<p> that disadvantage. And look the reason why indigenous people are disproportionately</p>
<p> represented in the jailed population of Australia, whether it is in the</p>
<p> Northern Territory or elsewhere is partly due to that disadvantage. So,</p>
<p> instead of talking about rolling back the criminal law what you should</p>
<p> be talking about is attacking some of the reasons why there's so</p>
<p> many of them proportionately in jail.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Ok, so long term, most people would acknowledge, long term this initiative</p>
<p> that you're announcing today could keep young aboriginals out of</p>
<p> jail, but for now mandatory sentencing is not.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But you can say that in relation to the whole of the criminal law. I</p>
<p> mean those people who say that mandatory sentencing is racially based</p>
<p> because proportionately there are more aborigines caught up, well you</p>
<p> can say that about the whole of the criminal law because of the disproportionately</p>
<p> large indigenous population in jail. What you've got to do is not</p>
<p> roll back the criminal law, what you've got to do is try to remove</p>
<p> the disadvantage. Now we are making progress and one of the things I'll</p>
<p> say today is that there are too many negative stories about indigenous</p>
<p> people. We never hear the good stories, we never learn that we have in</p>
<p> fact reduced some of the areas of disadvantage, and I'll be spelling</p>
<p> that out today when I make this announcement.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, can I put this to you though. We now have seven former</p>
<p> High Court judges, four Appeal Court judges, at least two Supreme Court</p>
<p> judges, you've got former prime ministers and numerous law societies</p>
<p> and councils, who are calling on your Government to overturn mandatory</p>
<p> sentencing. You and the laws have been criticised by a United Nations'</p>
<p> committee.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Which I think . . .</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean that United Nations' committee is fundamentally flawed because</p>
<p> it is based on the erroneous proposition that because there is a disproportionately</p>
<p> large number of indigenous people likely to be caught up in these laws</p>
<p> that it is racially based. It is not racially based at all. That is the</p>
<p> equivalent of saying that all of our criminal laws are racially based.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>But when you've got all these legal minds, you have said you don't</p>
<p> agree with mandatory sentencing.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't. There is a lot of things... I don't agree with</p>
<p> safe injecting rooms. But in a federation, you've got to have a system</p>
<p> where if the local community elects a government and that government does</p>
<p> something and people at the centre of government, the national government</p>
<p> is unhappy with that then you've got to think before you intervene</p>
<p> and overturn that local law. Can I just say the criminal laws of this</p>
<p> country have for decades been run by the states. The Commonwealth doesn't</p>
<p> run the criminal law of Australia except in so far as international things</p>
<p> intrude, but the ordinary day to day criminal law, robberies, murder all</p>
<p> those things they're all state things. Now I think to sort of march</p>
<p> in and try and overturn every individual state criminal law you disagree</p>
<p> with is making a bit of a mockery of federation. And I am not a fanatical</p>
<p> states rightist, as every premier in Australia will know, but I do think</p>
<p> that you've got to preserve the federal compact to the extent of</p>
<p> acknowledging the role of the states and the territories in these matters.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>But if in Federal Parliament, the elected representatives are expected</p>
<p> to reflect the views of the people who put them there and the views of</p>
<p> the people who put them there are anti-mandatory sentencing, surely in</p>
<p> a democracy they should at least . . .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well when you say they are anti-mandatory sentencing, I mean if you are</p>
<p> talking about that poll yesterday, and after all we shouldn't be</p>
<p> poll driven in these things, we should do what we think is right.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Well there are some people who would argue that you are.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, hang on, you just said a moment ago that the population is anti-mandatory</p>
<p> sentencing. I mean I don't agree with mandatory sentencing, but if</p>
<p> you look at that poll yesterday the community is split right down the</p>
<p> middle as to whether the federal government should intervene or not.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>So, why not allow a free debate in Parliament.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but you can't, look that is an abdication of responsibility.</p>
<p> What you are really saying is that every time you've got a hard issue</p>
<p> you walk away from the responsibility of having an opinion and you have</p>
<p> a free vote. If you allow a free vote on this, you would have a free vote</p>
<p> on just about everything that's difficult. Now that is cowardly government.</p>
<p> But I know there are people who are criticising me over this.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And I accept that. I mean people criticise me over everything. And you</p>
<p> know it is sort of in a sense it goes with the territory.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>So that's it, end of story as far as you're concerned?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I believe that these are matters that belong to the states and</p>
<p> the territories and there are a lot of things I repeat that the states</p>
<p> do I don't agree with. If I am going as Prime Minister try and overturn</p>
<p> every single thing. I mean people are not banging on my door saying you</p>
<p> ought to overturn safe injecting rooms, they're not. The media's</p>
<p> not doing that because they agree with them, but they disagree with this</p>
<p> so they're banging on my door over that, yet the principle is the</p>
<p> same. There is a United Nations' committee that's criticised</p>
<p> safe injecting rooms, that have said that that is in breach of our international</p>
<p> obligations. Look in the end, we're not going to be told by committees</p>
<p> of foreigners what to do in this country. In the end it is Australian</p>
<p> parliaments, elected by Australians that will resolve these matters and</p>
<p> this increasing invitation of the views of committees of foreigners I</p>
<p> don't think washes with the Australian community.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Let me fire the scattergun in the time we've got left. You mentioned</p>
<p> safe injecting rooms and drugs. In Victoria, one private school and maybe</p>
<p> a second is now talking about drug testing for students at the schools</p>
<p> who have used illicit drugs. Do you support that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well if the schools want to do it, I support their right. I don't</p>
<p> know all the circumstances but I support the right of any school to adopt</p>
<p> those sort of methods to try and curtail the drug problem. I absolutely</p>
<p> support their right to do it. As to whether it is a good thing in the</p>
<p> circumstances, I don't know enough about it.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>All right, and just finally, this reception for the Veterans of the Korean</p>
<p> War. It is getting a lot of publicity at the moment.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, well I am disturbed about that because we haven't set out to</p>
<p> be mean, all we've set out to do and frankly I didn't know all</p>
<p> the details.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>But will you pick up the tab?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'll have a look at it Steve. Please, I will have a look at</p>
<p> it. I mean all we're doing now we've put $700,000 into the memorial,</p>
<p> we've subsidised all of the functions, we are doing what is normally</p>
<p> done in these circumstances. I personally have had no complaints about</p>
<p> it.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>But it's a bit mean.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'll have a look at it. But I haven't, nobody's</p>
<p> set out to be. I didn't know about it until I read an article in</p>
<p> the paper. Not, I didn't know a thing about it. So it is easy to</p>
<p> say, look the sky is the limit, you can pay for everything.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Yes, I know.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean really there has to be a point at which, and we have put 700 grand</p>
<p> into the memorial, subsidised the function, I mean OK, you say that's</p>
<p> mean because we don't pick up every last dollar, but there is a limit.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Talking of looking at it, just quickly have you seen the London papers</p>
<p> today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>I don't know whether we've got them. The headlines "Touch</p>
<p> too friendly again in Australia".</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am glad to see the British press and the Australian press . . .</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Have got their priorities right?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Is really focusing on the big issues.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Thank you for coming in.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
