NQ DATE<br />
12 April 1973<br />
ADDRESS BY SPECIAL MINISTER OF STATE<br />
The attached is the text of an address by the<br />
Special Minister of State, Senator Don Willesee, to ' he<br />
0 29th Session of E. C. A. F. E. ( 12 Aoril 1973) which is<br />
currently meeting in Tokyo.<br />
Senator Willesee was elected one of six Vice<br />
Chairmen of the meeting ( others were Indonesia, China,<br />
Iran, Neral and the Philippines). Ambassador Tsuruoka of<br />
Japan was elected Chairman. </p>
<p>I join in extending the Australian delegation's<br />
warmest congratulations to you, Mr Chairman, and to our<br />
Japanese hosts for the excellent arrangements for this<br />
29th Session. Australia enjoys especially friendly relations<br />
with your country which have an assured and firm foundation<br />
in the interdependence of our economic relations. It is the<br />
intention of Australia's new Government to work for still<br />
better understanding between Australia and Japan and with all<br />
countries in the ECAFE region.<br />
Mr Chairman, the 29th Session of ECAFE holds promise<br />
of marking the beginning of a new and more hopeful era in the<br />
affairs of the ECAFE region. There are three major elements<br />
in the present situation which call for special comment.<br />
The first is the signing of the ceasefire agreements<br />
in Viet-Nam and Laos. These agreements have been welcomed<br />
throughout the world and particularly by the people of our<br />
region. Although it would be unrealistic to overlook the<br />
problems that are being encountered in carrying out the<br />
various provisions of the agreements, it is our hope that<br />
they will lead to the re-establishment on a firm basis of<br />
conditions of peace in Viet-Nam and Laos. It is our hope<br />
also that, despite the continuation and indeed the recent<br />
intensificiation of fighting in Cambodia, a ceasefire may<br />
soon be achieved in that country as well.<br />
An end to hostilities throughout Indo-China would<br />
improve the prospects of a successful assault on the major<br />
obstacles and barriers to economic and social development / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
in a major area of South East Asia which forms such an important<br />
part of the ECAFE region. We in Australia acknowledge that<br />
there will be a great need for rehabilitation and reconstruction<br />
in the post-war period in Indo-China and our Government intends<br />
that Australia should assume a generous share of the reconstruction<br />
effort. The first principle of any effective policy of<br />
development assistance, whether multilateral or bilateral, is<br />
that no programme can be effective unless it accords with the<br />
expressed wishes of the receiving countries. It is perhaps too<br />
early to attempt to identify the role which the United Nations<br />
including ECAFE, may be called upon to play in the reconstruction<br />
effort in Indo-China, but it is clear that the wishes of the<br />
countries of Indo-China itself will determine the extent and<br />
scope of such a role. If ECAFE is given a role in the work of<br />
reconstruction, it will have Australia's full co-operation.<br />
The task for all countries interested in contributing<br />
to the reconstruction effort will be to find effective ways in<br />
which to act. The winding down of the war may open up new<br />
possibilities for the Mekong scheme and we shall be following<br />
the possibilities with close attention through our association<br />
with the work of the Mekong Committee. We would hope that,<br />
under more peaceful conditions, the energies of the people of<br />
Indo-China could be directed to the economic development of<br />
their region Australia stands ready to participate with them<br />
in this task through the Mekong and other schemes. Meanwhile 0 / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
I should like to record that the Australian Government is willing<br />
to grant up to $ US500,000 for the second phase of the Nam Ngum<br />
dam project. The Australian Government has established full diplomatic<br />
relations with the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and we are<br />
now in the process of setting up an Embassy in Hanoi. A<br />
significant part of the work of this Embassy is likely to be<br />
concerned with possible Australian aid activities. We look<br />
forward to the time when the Government of the DRV will be able<br />
to make its contribution to regional co-operation.<br />
The second element to which I refer is that China has<br />
now taken her place in the community of nations and a delegation<br />
from the People's Republic is present at this Session of ECAFE<br />
for the first time. The Australian delegation extends a warm<br />
welcome to the delegation of China. Our Government moved to<br />
recognise and exchange diplomatic missions with China as soon<br />
as we came into office. We believe that the absence of contact<br />
with China had led to a build-up of inflexible attitudes which<br />
inhibited the scope for co-operation and progress in our regioh<br />
The ~. ssumption of its rightful place in ECAFE by the largest<br />
country in the region should help to accelerate the movement<br />
towards better understanding among all regional countries and<br />
to give greater authority to the deliberations of ECAFE. The<br />
Australian delegation looks forward to fruitful and constructive<br />
co-operation with the delegation of China. / 4 </p>
<p>The third element concerns the administration of ' ECAFE<br />
itself. This will be the last session at which U Nyun will be<br />
present as Executive Secretary. I associate myself with the<br />
leaders of other delegations who have paid tribute to his service<br />
to the cause of advancing the economic and social wellbeing of<br />
the Deople of this region for 14 years. He has been tenacious<br />
in overcoming obstacles and in advancing the process of Asian<br />
co-operation in the Asian way.<br />
ECAFE has notched notable achievements during his oeriod<br />
of office of which the creation of the Asian Development Bank<br />
has possibly had the most impact. The Executive Secretary is<br />
justified in taking -pride in his achievements, especially since<br />
the last few years have been a difficult period for the region<br />
and inevitably for ECAFE.<br />
U Nyun will be succeeded as Executive Secretary by<br />
Ambasspdor Maramis of Indonesia. Ambassador Maramis has had<br />
a long experience in the Government and foreign service of his<br />
country and he already has a strong background of work and<br />
achievement in the economic field. We are confident that, under<br />
his leadership, the Secretariat of ECAFE will meet the new<br />
challenges of a more hopeful era. The new Executive Secretary<br />
will have Australia's full support and co-operation.<br />
Mr C'iairman, Papua New Guinea is represented at this,<br />
as nt previous recent ECAFF sessions in its own right, on this<br />
occasion by the Minister for Finance, Mr Julius Chan, who will </p>
<p>explain the policies of his Government. All that I want to say,<br />
as Australia's representative at the session, is that our<br />
Government's policy is to move with all due speed towards the<br />
creation of an independent, united Papua New Guinea. We propose<br />
to reach this objective in the closest consultation with the<br />
Government and the House of Assembly of Papua New Guinea within<br />
the lifetime of the present Australian parliament. It is our<br />
intention to introduce legislation providing that Papua New<br />
Guinea should be self-governing by 1 December of this year or as<br />
soon as practicable thereafter. Australia is deeply committed<br />
to continue a substantial programme of economic aid to an<br />
independent Papua New Guinea.<br />
The peace and prosperity of the ECAFE region is a major<br />
commitment of the Australian Government. We see our participation<br />
in this Economic Commission as affording opportunities by which<br />
we will be able, as a significant economic power in the region,<br />
to identify and adopt constructive policies aimed at honouring<br />
this commitment. We shall be looking to the discussions within<br />
ECAFE for guidance and stimulation.<br />
The Secretariat is to be commended for its systematic<br />
presentation of social and economic performance in the region<br />
for the First Biennial Review of the second United Nations<br />
Development Decade in conjunction with the Economic survey for<br />
1972. The Survey shows, however, that the performance of<br />
individual developing countries are continuing to fall short of / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
desirable levels of achievement. The average weighted annual<br />
growth rate for all ECAFE developing countries reached almost<br />
7% by 1969, but had fallen back to 5.6% in 1971 and the survey<br />
states that it may have been below this level in 1972.<br />
The rapid and sustained reduction in mass poverty,<br />
which is recognised as a special priority goal for the ECAFE<br />
region, is not being achieved at current rates of growth in<br />
production, while population continues to increase at high<br />
levels in some cases up to 3.5% per annum. The table on<br />
page 34 of the English language text shows that in 1971, GNP<br />
per person grew at substantial rates of over 7% in only two<br />
of the nine countries listed Iran and the Republic of Korea.<br />
Indonesia achieved an encouraging 3.8% per capita but the per<br />
capita rates for the other countries were all below and in some<br />
countries will below 3%.<br />
The survey explains the slower growth rates in terms<br />
of two major short-term factors: the slowing down in the<br />
economies of Japan, Western Europe and North America and the<br />
droughts and other adverse conditions which afflicted agriculture<br />
and crops in most ECAFE countries in 1971 and 72.<br />
The first of these factors points up the need to<br />
solve the problems of basic economic stability and growth in the<br />
advanced economies so as to provide the essential conditions<br />
for stable trade and payments. The survey rightly draws<br />
attention to the benefits for the developing countries from<br />
steady growth and high levels of employment in advanced ./ 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
economies accompanied by a rational solution to the current<br />
international monetary problems.<br />
7CAFE will not be able to do its best work until these<br />
problems are being successfully tackled. Individual developing<br />
countries will be able to plan effectively for their development<br />
and for the welfare of their people only in circumstances which<br />
offer reasonable predictability of income prospects and trade<br />
returns. These are the preconditions for making more resources<br />
available for human welfare.<br />
The restoration of order in the international monetary<br />
system will require concerted efforts by individual countries to<br />
achieve equilibrium in their own balance of payments. Australia<br />
is working actively within the Committee of Twenty to further the<br />
possibility of reforming the international monetary system and<br />
it is reassuring that the developing countries of our region are<br />
represented in the Committee by India and Indonesia.<br />
In the latter part of the year, a further round of<br />
trade and tariff negotiations within the GATT should commence<br />
and we will be working for meaningful results which recognise<br />
the particular interests of the developing countries as well<br />
as countries like Australia which are major exporters of primary<br />
products. We hope that developing countries, particularly the<br />
countries of this region, will avail themselves of the opportunities<br />
available under Australia's scheme of tariff preferences for / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
developing countries which has now been in operation for seven<br />
years. Our Minister for Overseas Trade recently announced a<br />
further extension of the scheme and we have been active in bringing<br />
concessions under the scheme to the attention of regional countries.<br />
I would like to stress that our representatives are always<br />
available for consultation on ways of taking advsntage of the<br />
scheme. Against the background of uncertainties surrounding the<br />
future of international tri'de and payments, it is not surprising,<br />
though disappointing, that the total flow of resources from the<br />
adva~ nced economies to developing countries in the region has<br />
continued to decline. In 1971, the developed countries as a<br />
whole contributed only .35% of their GNP to the developing<br />
countries in the form of official aid compared with .53% at the<br />
beginning of the 19601s. Australia has maintained its good aid<br />
Derformance of the recent Dast and the annual flow of official<br />
development assistance from Australia remains at over of<br />
GNP. Meanwhile we have continued to surpass the 1% Target for<br />
the'transfer of all resources, official and private, for each<br />
of the last three years and this situation seems likely to<br />
persist at least for the next year or so. The total value of<br />
Australiats official aid for the current financial year is likely<br />
to be $ A220 million or $ US308 million and has been increasing at<br />
around 11% per annum. As delegations are aware, nearly all of<br />
this assistance goes to the countries of this region.<br />
Our Prime Minister has indicated publicly that Australia's<br />
intention is to have a substantially increased foreign aid 0 1/ 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
programme and we are currently working to improve still further<br />
the quality of the programme.<br />
We expect these efforts to result in a closer alignment<br />
of our programmes with the policy measures which are emphasized<br />
in the survey. In collaboration with recipient countries we will, for<br />
example, be looking intensively into the nossibilities of giving<br />
greater emphasis to sovial fields and to the effects of our<br />
programmes on income distribution and employment uroblems.<br />
We will also be looking into the possibilities of<br />
increasing the number of our projects in rural areas so as to<br />
bring benefits more directly to the people of developing<br />
countries. Mr Chairman, there are many practical problems in<br />
achieving effective regional co-operation in an area as vast<br />
as the ECAFE region and the Australian delegation is concerned<br />
that the approach of ECAFE to questions of regional co-operation<br />
should be constructive and pragmatic. Accordingly, it would<br />
seem desirable to outline, in broad terms, some thoughts on<br />
ways in which ECAFE might strive to develop more effective<br />
techniques for tackling some of the practical problems of<br />
regional co-operation.<br />
In recent years there have been criticisms that the<br />
sheer size and scone of the Commission's activities, although </p>
<p>well intentioned, have imposed a heavy administrative burden<br />
on the Commission and on Governments. For understandable<br />
reasons, ECAFE has given much of its attention to approaching<br />
problems on a region-wide basis. A number of the Commission's<br />
projects have been of considerable value to the region, but<br />
other proposals have not been launched because of the difficulties<br />
of Dutting them into practice.<br />
Sub-regional approaches have been adopted but usually<br />
in regard to a limited range of topics of interest to a small<br />
number of countries. Some examples are seen in the work of the<br />
TyTIihoon Control Cor. mittee, the Mekong Co-ordination Committee,<br />
the Committee for Off-shore Oil Prospecting and the Asian Commodity<br />
Communities. These activities have generally been of considerable<br />
value to member countries and we feel that the Commission might<br />
be encouraged to apply more of its resources to ways and means of<br />
developing sub-regional approaches to problems. One technique<br />
might be to select groups of member countries with common<br />
problems, and to deal with tlhem through task forces cutting<br />
across individual disciplines and sectors where necessary.<br />
We are not, of course, suggesting that tI-e Commission<br />
abandon regional projects of proven value and indeed we encourage<br />
all measures of regional co-operation which are feasible and<br />
practical. We feel however that a greater degree of emphasis<br />
on the sub-regional approach could lead to a more positive<br />
identification of solutions for pnarticular problems and could<br />
facilitate tI-e mounting of projects which have clearly<br />
identifiable and attainable aims. Regional developing countries<br />
have themselves been showing the way. </p>
<p>-11-<br />
Mr Chairman, there are two broad areas which are<br />
currently the subject of intense discussion internationally and<br />
within countries: these concern the environment and population.<br />
There have been profound chianges in the attitudes of governments<br />
in our region to these two matters in the recent past. Australia's<br />
attitude to both questions is positive and our government looks<br />
forward -to effective co-operation with Asian ana Pacific countries<br />
in these two areas.<br />
We understand and sympathise with member countries in<br />
their efforts to arrive at an appreciation of where the emphasis<br />
should be placed as between the objectives of economic and social<br />
development on the one hand and the maintenance of a sound<br />
environment on the other. We consider that the most fruitful<br />
approach is to regard the objective of maintaining a sound<br />
environment as complementary to, rather th-an in conflict with,<br />
the objectives of economic and social development. The problems<br />
are com~ lex, however, and ECAFE should be able to assist<br />
Governments to formulate realistic policies for environmental<br />
protection as they pursue their developmental goals.<br />
ECAFE will have a sound basis for its work in the<br />
relevant proposals of the Stockholm conference which have been<br />
adopted by the General Assembly. Australia has already shown<br />
its support for international co-operation on environmental<br />
matters by pledging a contribution of $ US2.5 million to the<br />
U. N. fund. ./ 12 </p>
<p>-12-<br />
There is widespread acknowledgement by regional<br />
governments that the adoption of effective measures to limit<br />
rates of population growth is an important factor in the<br />
achievement of improved living standards.<br />
The Australian delegation welcomes the work of the<br />
R. CAFT7 Secretariat in the population field. The contribution of<br />
the Secretariat was a major factor in the success of the Second<br />
Asian Population Conference held in Tokyo last November.<br />
Australia is now contributing funancially to the major<br />
international population funds and we expect that in future we<br />
will he able to assist ECAFE countries on a more vigorous basis<br />
in this im-oortant area. The contribution of the ECAFE region to<br />
the World Population Conference in 1974 will he a particularly<br />
significant one. We shall be aiming to ensure that Autai'<br />
position at the Conference is closely aligned with that of<br />
our friends in this region.<br />
Mr Chairman, the Australian Goverhment intends that<br />
Australia should. have warm, friendly and co-operative relations<br />
with all countries in the region. Our attitude on United Nations<br />
matters is in close alignment with those of our friends in this<br />
region. This anplies here in ECAFE, as well as in the other<br />
organs of the United Nations, including the Security Council.<br />
The Australian Government will work strenuously for the<br />
improvement of co-operation in the region and intends to give its<br />
full backing to the valuable contribution of ECAFE to the tasks<br />
of economic and social progress in this the most populous part<br />
of the world. </p>
