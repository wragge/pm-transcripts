PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ON HIS VISIT TO THE ROK, THAILAND, PAKISTAN AND INDIA<br />
THURSDAY, 2 MARCH 1989<br />
Madam Speaker<br />
I seek leave to report to the House on my recent visit,<br />
between 29 January and 13 February, to the Republic of<br />
Korea, Thailand, Pakistan and India.<br />
Against the backdrop of the fundamental changes taking place<br />
in global relationships, it was fitting that this visit<br />
should take me to four countries that are not only important<br />
in their own right and important to Australia but that are<br />
also intimately involved in the three key points of tension<br />
in our region: the Korean Peninsula, Cambodia and<br />
Afghanistan. Each of the four leaders I met President Roh, Prime<br />
Minister Chatichai, Prime Minister Bhutto and Prime Minister<br />
Gandhi is working actively for a lessening of regional<br />
tensions. All are leaders who have shown a preparedness to<br />
take risks in the search for peace.<br />
Each of these leaders, too, in different ways, is<br />
discharging with skill and with vision the heavy<br />
responsibility of democratic government.<br />
India is the world's largest democracy; Thailand has<br />
witnessed considerable consolidation of its democratic<br />
processes over the past decade; in the Republic of Korea,<br />
democratic processes are being actively developed; and<br />
Pakistan after years of military rule, has happily now<br />
returned to the democratic fold.<br />
In these vital respects, these four leaders deserve, and I<br />
believe receive, the respect and support of all Australians.<br />
In particular, I found that listening to Prime Minister<br />
Bhutto, her mother, her Ministers and other associates<br />
recounting their stories of personal hardship and sacrifice<br />
under the previous regime, was both an apt reminder of the<br />
abuses which inevitably occur under military rule and an<br />
inspiring lesson about the capacity of a determined people<br />
to win again the dignity and liberty of democratic<br />
government. My visit thus provided a timely opportunity to advance<br />
Australia's interests on a wide range of important political<br />
issues global, regional and bilateral.<br />
Equally importantly, I saw this visit as an invaluable means<br />
of assisting Australia's commercial interests.<br />
Let me briefly explain why I see this as a significant<br />
element of my overseas visits. </p>
<p>The Australian economy over the last six years has undergone<br />
the historic, essential and overdue process of<br />
reconstruction to equip it better for the economic<br />
challenges of the world, and, not least, of our own dynamic<br />
Asia-Pacific region.<br />
It is through the greater enmeshment in the region of a<br />
diversified, productive, efficient, competitive Australia<br />
that the prosperity of individual Australians will be best<br />
protected and enhanced.<br />
So when, in my talks with government and business leaders<br />
overseas, I have the opportunity of advancing specific<br />
commercial projects which genuinely advance this process of<br />
enmeshment, I do so. Indeed I consciously seek to identify<br />
such opportunities. The pursuit of Australia's<br />
international commercial interests is now a major foreign<br />
policy objective. For the same reason, I am pleased to have<br />
the active involvement in my talks of senior Australian<br />
businessmen on this visit, in the ROK and India.<br />
In each of the four countries I visited, I addressed high<br />
level business forums the Korean Business Associations,<br />
the Australia/ Thai Chamber of Commerce and the<br />
Thai/ Australia Business Council, the Federation of Pakistan<br />
Chambers of Commerce and Industry, and the Indian-Australian<br />
Joint Business Council and I presented the facts about the<br />
immense two-way commercial opportunities offered by our<br />
increasingly competitive Australian economy.<br />
At the same time, I placed heavy emphasis in this visit, as<br />
I have in previous visits, on protecting and advancing<br />
Australia's multilateral trading interests.<br />
In my address to the Korean Business Associations on 31<br />
January, I proposed a Ministerial meeting of regional<br />
countries to explore further the possibility of creating a<br />
more formal intergovernmental vehicle of regional<br />
cooperation. I said that I saw merit in the model provided,<br />
in a different context, by the OECD.<br />
I stressed, and do so again today, that my support for such<br />
an institution of regional cooperation must not be<br />
interpreted as suggesting, by code words, the creation of a<br />
Pacific Trading Bloc.<br />
Indeed, one of the principal tasks of any such institution<br />
must be the strengthening of the GATT system.<br />
I am pleased to inform honourable members that, to date, the<br />
reaction of regional governments has been most encouraging.<br />
President Roh endorsed the proposal while I was in Seoul.<br />
Prime Minister Chatichai undertook to discuss the proposal<br />
with his ASEAN colleagues, as will Australia separately. A<br />
senior Australian official will be visiting regional<br />
countries soon to discuss the matter in more detail. </p>
<p>It is my hope that a ministerial level meeting will be held<br />
before the end of the year.<br />
In My Bangkok business address on 3 February, I addressed<br />
the need for a fair and workable outcome to the Uruguay<br />
Round of multilateral trade negotiations an important goal<br />
not only for the maintenance of our own and of global<br />
economic growth but also, ultimately, for the continued<br />
stability of international relations into the 1990s.<br />
It was in Bangkok in 1983 that I launched my Government's<br />
Regional Trade Initiative. It was therefore fitting that I<br />
should choose Bangkok this time to make a major address on<br />
the multilateral trading system.<br />
I said that GATT is not dead but, if the current deadlock is<br />
not broken, then we will have moved not to the end of GATT<br />
but quite possibly to the beginning of the end.<br />
Responsibility most heavily rests with the EC and the United<br />
States to make appropriate adjustments to the positions they<br />
so stubbornly stood by at Montreal.<br />
In each of the four capitals visited, I also pursued the<br />
need for effective solutions to environmental problems which<br />
transcend national boundaries, such as the Greenhouse Effect<br />
and the depletion of the ozone layer. I was able to outline<br />
the technology and expertise which Australia possesses in<br />
limiting the release of chlorofluorocarbons into the<br />
atmosphere and the preparedness of Australia's Association<br />
of Fluoro-Carbon Consumers and Manufactures to assist in<br />
transferring technologies for recycling CFCs in commercial<br />
use. Let me now report in turn on each of the countries I<br />
visited. The Republic of Korea<br />
My visit to the ROK took place some three months after<br />
President Roh's visit to Australia, thus consolidating a<br />
relationship that, in economic terms, is now among our most<br />
important. With two-way trade valued at almost $ 3 billion<br />
annually, the ROK in 1987-88 was Australia's seventh largest<br />
trading partner.<br />
I told President Roh that Australia welcomed his<br />
constructive, open and far-sighted approach to developing<br />
relations with the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea. I<br />
was able to advise President Roh of the movement in<br />
Australia's own relations with the DPRK, a development which<br />
he encouraged when he visited Australia late last year. I<br />
told the President, as we have told Pyongyang, that we are<br />
prepared to continue our dialogue with the DPRK, but that<br />
any improvement in relations will depend on an improved<br />
atmosphere in the ROK/ DPRK relationship, the international<br />
behaviour of the DPRK and the level of our confidence<br />
regarding the scope for a constructive relationship. </p>
<p>on bilateral issues, President Roh and I agreed on the need<br />
to proceed with the Joint Cultural Commission, the first<br />
meeting of which should be held in Seoul by mid-year, and an<br />
Australia-ROK Forum, to be held in Australia in<br />
October/ November. Both these initiatives will contribute<br />
valuably towards developing people-to-people contacts and<br />
thus broaden and strengthen the foundations of the<br />
relationship.<br />
My visit provided an excellent opportunity to urge the ROK<br />
to reform further its system of special taxes and import<br />
regulations, which continues to restrict healthy and<br />
non-discriminatory trade. I welcomed the recommendations of<br />
the Presidential Commission on Economic Restructuring for<br />
accelerating the process of liberalisation and restructuring<br />
in the ROK. I invited members of the Commission to visit<br />
Australia, and I am pleased to say, it is likely that this<br />
invitation will be taken up.<br />
My meeting with senior Economic Ministers, which was given<br />
added stature with the presence of a number of Australian<br />
business leaders, enabled me to discuss, at first hand, the<br />
important issues of market access for Australian beef, iron<br />
ore, coal, aluminium and other exports. I told Korean<br />
Ministers that, while Australia welcomed the recent<br />
indications of the progressive reopening of their beef<br />
market, we were not happy with the current level of access<br />
and had no option but to continue to pursue the issue<br />
through the GATT in order to protect our legitimate trade<br />
interests.<br />
while in Seoul I inspected the magnificent facilities built<br />
for the Games of the XXIV Olympiad. The challenge is great<br />
but I am confident that Australia, through Melbourne, will<br />
be able to put together equally impressive facilities and<br />
make a very credible bid for the 1996 Games.<br />
Thailand In contrast to the Republic of Korea, Thailand is not one of<br />
Australia's largest trading partners. I strongly believe<br />
that it should be. It is a country which is experiencing a<br />
period of sustained growth, which could well see it join the<br />
ranks of the Newly Industrialised Economies ( NIEs) over the<br />
next decade. Thailand's energy needs are increasing by over<br />
14 per cent per annum and this, combined with the rapid<br />
expansion of its economy as a whole, offers Australia<br />
enormous opportunities.<br />
My discussions with Prime minister Chatichai therefore<br />
focused on establishing a new framework for the<br />
Australia/ Thai economic relationship. We agreed on the<br />
desirability of an Economic Cooperation Agreement, a<br />
Concessional Finance Agreement and a Memorandum of<br />
Understanding on Energy Cooperation. I expect all three<br />
Agreements to be finalised over the next twelve months. It<br />
was also agreed that Double Taxation negotiations would be<br />
renewed, the successful conclusion of which would provide an<br />
important umbrella for Australian business to expand its<br />
involvement in Thailand. </p>
<p>As a result of my discussions I am confident that we will<br />
achieve our goal of a doubling of two-way trade over the<br />
next three years to $ 1.3 billion. The target is ambitious,<br />
but, given the 80 per cent increase since 1985, it is<br />
certainly achievable.<br />
Discussions with Thailand's senior Economic Ministers<br />
highlighted the enormous potential for trade and investment<br />
opportunities in that country and of Thailand's clear wish<br />
to see more Australian involvement in its economic future.<br />
Australian companies are well placed, for instance, to seek<br />
multi-million dollar contracts in relation to Thailand's<br />
plans for a hot-and cold-rolled steel mill, its Eastern<br />
Seaboard development encompassing a coal-fired power station<br />
and its proposed Data Processing Zone, which could offer a<br />
unique opportunity for Australian joint venturers to get in<br />
at the outset of high-tech development of the Thai economy.<br />
Madam Speaker, as I said at the beginning of this report,<br />
Cambodia was a key topic of discussion in Bangkok. with<br />
developments in Sino-Soviet relations, Sino-Vietnam<br />
relations and Thai-Vietnam relations, the external<br />
environment for a settlement in Cambodia is better than at<br />
any time in the recent past.<br />
While the outcome of the recent meeting in Jakarta<br />
highlights the difficulties which still need to be resolved,<br />
it is essential that all parties make continued determined<br />
efforts to advance the peace process. This is something to<br />
which I know Prime Minister Chatichai is deeply committed.<br />
It is a measure of Australia's standing in the region and of<br />
the work of my Government since 1983 that Thailand wants<br />
Australia to participate in any International Conference<br />
that might develop from the current process.<br />
I told Prime Minister Chatichai that Australia was prepared<br />
to play an active and constructive role in an International<br />
Conference, if that was the wish of the parties more<br />
directly involved in the resolution of the conflict. As I<br />
indicated in Bangkok, it is too early yet to be definite<br />
about an Australian role in any International Control<br />
Mechanism, as the detail of such a Mechanism is still<br />
unknown. Honourable members will know that Prime minister Chatichai<br />
sought Australian involvement in the design and construction<br />
of a bridge across the Mekong River to link Thailand and<br />
Laos. Not only because of its benefits for economic<br />
development, but also because of its symbolic importance in<br />
the Indochina peace process, and because of its key role in<br />
Prime Minister Chatichai's ambition to change Indochina from<br />
a war zone into a peace and trading zone, I agreed to the<br />
undertaking, subject to the agreement of the Government of<br />
Laos and to a further feasibility study confirming the cost<br />
parameters. Laos has reacted positively to the suggestion<br />
and our feasibility study will commence over the coming<br />
months. </p>
<p>I am confident that the undertaking will contribute<br />
positively to an easing of tensions in the region and, at<br />
the same time, lift substantially Australia's profile in the<br />
region as a whole. The cost of the undertaking will be met<br />
from within the existing forward estimates of Australia's<br />
Development Assistance Program. In other words, no new<br />
allocation of monies is involved.<br />
While in Thailand, I visited the Commonwealth War Graves<br />
Cemetery near the River Kwai, where so many brave Australian<br />
and Allied prisoners of war were forced to work, and in many<br />
cases to die, in the most appalling circumstances. That<br />
visit served as a reminder of the lasting debt succeeding<br />
generations owe to those who made the ultimate sacrifice in<br />
war. My visit to the Crop Substitution Project outside Chiang Mai<br />
in Northern Thailand, which is sponsored by His Majesty the<br />
King of Thailand, was especially appropriate, given the<br />
vital cooperation between the Australian and Thai<br />
Governments in combating the drug trade. I told Prime<br />
Minister Chatichai, and I am sure this sentiment is shared<br />
by all Honourable Members, that Australia will continue to<br />
do everything it can to cooperate in the fight against those<br />
parasites in the drug trade who seek to gain from the misery<br />
of others.<br />
Pakistan Madam Speaker, my visit to Pakistan was the first by an<br />
Australian Prime Minister since 1975, when Gough Whitlam was<br />
received by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, whose<br />
daughter, Benazir Bhutto, is now Pakistan's newly elected<br />
Prime Minister. Her courage, determination and leadership<br />
in restoring democratic rule to Pakistan are truly<br />
remarkable. I arrived in Islamabad the day that Soviet Foreign Minister<br />
Shevardnadze departed. Afghanistan was therefore very much<br />
on the minds of the Pakistani leadership. I told Ms Bhutto<br />
that, in line with the Geneva Accord, Australia was<br />
concerned to see the establishment of a viable Coalition<br />
Government in Kabul encompassing the different political<br />
elements, as that appeared to be the best way of minimising<br />
the prospect of Afghanistan sliding into anarchy and<br />
bloodshed. Pakistan's return to democratic rule has provided a firm<br />
basis for the re-establishment of a substantive relationship<br />
between our two countries. I announced a grant of 25,000<br />
tonnes of wheat to help alleviate an expected food shortage<br />
and the establishment of a $ 15 million three year<br />
Development Assistance Program. A team of Australian<br />
officials will be visiting Pakistan soon to discuss the<br />
details of this program. </p>
<p>As part of the mutual effort to add substance to the<br />
bilateral relationship, Prime Minister Bhutto and I agreed<br />
that we should negotiate a Trade Agreement and should<br />
encourage a group of senior Australian businessmen to visit<br />
Pakistan this year. Australia is already a significant<br />
exporter of coal, iron ore, wool and wheat to Pakistan, and<br />
there is scope for significant expansion in areas associated<br />
with Pakistan's infrastructure development such as power<br />
stations, port facilities, pipelines, telecommunications and<br />
the dairy and sugar industries.<br />
India<br />
Madam Speaker, my visit to India provided an opportunity to<br />
give a significant boost to what should be one of<br />
Australia's more important bilateral relationships. While<br />
having a very solid foundation, Australia's relationship<br />
with India has not yet fulfilled its very considerable<br />
potential. When he visited here in October 1986, my good<br />
friend Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and I pledged ourselves<br />
to enhance the relationship. Since then, there have been<br />
some significant advances, especially in the development of<br />
private sector contacts through the establishment of the<br />
Joint Business Council, whose third annual meeting I<br />
addressed in New Delhi.<br />
With two-way trade at only a little over $ 700 million, it is<br />
obvious that there is much spare capacity in the<br />
relationship and that there is a need for further efforts by<br />
both sides to turn the relationship into something more<br />
substantial. I am confident that my visit has gone a long<br />
way towards that end. During my discussions with Prime<br />
Minister Gandhi, we agreed to establish a Joint Ministerial<br />
Commission and to make a determined effort to increase the<br />
level of Ministerial visits between the two countries.<br />
Details of the Joint Ministerial Commission are being<br />
discussed between officials and it is my hope that the first<br />
meeting will be held later this year.<br />
While in New Delhi, Prime Minister Gandhi and I witnessed<br />
the signing of four Memoranda of Understanding covering<br />
Telecommunications, Railways, Monsoon Meteorology, and<br />
Concessional Finance. These indicate the diversity of<br />
opportunities that exist in our relationship. In<br />
particular, the MOU on Concessional Finance will provide a<br />
firm basis for Australian firms to pursue with confidence<br />
large contract negotiations in India. Likewise, the<br />
decision to make a renewed commitment to the negotiation of<br />
a Double Taxation Agreement will give confidence to<br />
Australian business to seek further involvement in India's<br />
economic development. </p>
<p>Honourable Members will be aware of the negotiations which<br />
have been in train for some time in connection with the<br />
Piparwar Project, involving the development of a large scale<br />
open cut coal mine. I am very pleased to report that these<br />
negotiations are now in their final stages and are expected<br />
to be concluded very soon. This project, worth more than<br />
$ 200 million, will provide a significant boost to<br />
Australia's profile in India and will demonstrate, in the<br />
best possible way, our capacity to compete internationally<br />
for large scale projects.<br />
Prime Minister Gandhi welcomed my advice that Australia was<br />
embarking on a significant enhancement of its Development<br />
Cooperation Program in India a $ 35 million program over<br />
three years beginning in 1990/ 91. Details of the program<br />
are being followed-up in discussions between officials.<br />
Matching Indian needs and priorities with Australian<br />
expertise, this program will undoubtedly contribute<br />
significantly to an enhancement of the overall bilateral<br />
economic relationship.<br />
As with the Mekong River Bridge and the assistance package I<br />
announced in Islamabad, this expenditure will be within<br />
existing forward estimates and will not involve expenditure<br />
outside budget.<br />
on international developments, my discussions with Prime<br />
Minister Gandhi centred on broader global issues, the<br />
Commonwealth and South Africa. I was especially pleased to<br />
hear from Mr Gandhi the successful outcome of his recent<br />
visit to Beijing. As I commented during our discussions, a<br />
stable and improving relationship between China and India<br />
will contribute significantly to a lowering of tensions with<br />
the wider region.<br />
In the context of Australia's global and regional<br />
disarmament interests, perhaps the most significant question<br />
I pursued during my visit was that relating to the threat of<br />
nuclear proliferation in South Asia. In my discussions with<br />
both Prime Minister Bhutto and Prime Minister Gandhi, I<br />
welcomed their recent meeting and signing of an agreement<br />
not to attack each other's nuclear facilities. I encouraged<br />
them to continue the search for further confidence building<br />
measures. I took every opportunity, in both my private talks and in my<br />
public statements including most significantly when I<br />
delivered the Third Indira Gandhi Memorial Lecture in New<br />
Delhi on 10 February to stress the importance of the<br />
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This is an issue on which<br />
we have a different approach from both India and Pakistan,<br />
and I saw no purpose to be served by down-playing or<br />
minimising that difference. On the contrary, Australia will<br />
always speak clearly and forcefully on this crucial issue.<br />
The crux of my message was that it would be a great tragedy<br />
if, at the very time that the superpowers are negotiating a<br />
reduction in their arsenals, the spectre of nuclear<br />
proliferation should be raised menacingly in our own region. </p>
<p>While in New Delhi, I also discussed with Mr Gandhi the<br />
question of India's naval build-up. I told Mr Gandhi that<br />
the issue had aroused some interest in Australia and that,<br />
while the Australian Government did not see it as a threat,<br />
the Government nonetheless would continue to monitor<br />
developments and consult with India on them. I said that<br />
Australia had a legitimate interest in any increase in power<br />
projection capability in the region.<br />
Mr Gandhi assured me that he was committed to a lowering of<br />
tensions with Pakistan a sentiment mirrored in Islamabad<br />
by Prime Minister Bhutto and that, consistent with this,<br />
it was his wish to reduce defence expenditure as a<br />
percentage of GNP. The development of a more constructive<br />
relationship between India and Pakistan would, undoubtedly,<br />
contribute significantly to a lowering of tensions in South<br />
Asia and the wider region.<br />
As a result of my talks in New Delhi and Islamabad, there<br />
are to be regular bilateral disarmament talks at senior<br />
officials level. It is my hope that the first round of such<br />
talks will be held before the end of the year.<br />
Madam Speaker, I also discussed in Islamabad and New Delhi<br />
the question of Pakistan's re-entry into the Commonwealth.<br />
Mr Gandhi confirmed that India would welcome Pakistan's<br />
return and agreed with my suggestion that every effort<br />
should be made to complete the process in time for Pakistan<br />
to participate fully at the CHOGM in Kuala Lumpur. Since my<br />
return to Canberra I have spoken by telephone to<br />
Commonwealth Secretary-General Ramphal, who is equally keen<br />
to see Pakistan's return. It is my sincere hope, and one<br />
which I am sure is shared by all Honourable Members that,<br />
come October, Prime Minister Bhutto will be able to take up<br />
once again Pakistan's seat at Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government Meetings.<br />
Madam Speaker, I would like to place on record my sincere<br />
thanks for the very warm and generous hospitality shown to<br />
me and my party in each of the four countries I visited. As<br />
is obvious from this report, my visit to the ROK, Thailand,<br />
Pakistan and India was undertaken to advance specific and<br />
concrete Australian interests. Measured against that<br />
yard-stick the visit was an undoubted success and one which<br />
demonstrated Australia's continuing high standing in the<br />
region. </p>
