TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH. STAN GRANT, REAL LIFE PROGRAM, CHI 7<br />
1 MARCH 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
SG. Why did Ros Kelly take so long-to resign?<br />
PM;. Because she believed, as all reports have confirmed, that she had<br />
done nothing improper, that there was no question of fraud and<br />
impropriety, and therefore questions about her choices, that is the<br />
exercise of her ministerial discretion, were subjective ones that didn't<br />
require resignation.<br />
SG: So, what was the final straw then?<br />
PM: Well, the House of Representatives made a report and said that there<br />
wasn't an adequate paper trail. That is, in terms of recommendations,<br />
that the record keeping, they said, wasn't up to scratch. I think Mrs<br />
Kell-y would have had to live with that. But then of course, the Senate,<br />
as is its habit, was debating whether they would have a full scale<br />
senate inquiry which would then go on for more months, and I think<br />
having gone on for months she thought it was doing the Government<br />
more harm then good.<br />
SG: But before that parliamentary inquiry there was evidence of<br />
incompetence, of bias, of misleading parliament. Wasn't that enough<br />
for you to say to her you have to go?<br />
P M. No evidence of misleading Parliament. There was none of that. Not<br />
incompetence, an argument about bias.<br />
SO: I don't know if the whiteboard is seen as competent, do you? </p>
<p>TEL: I. Mar., 94 16: 39 No. 026 P. 02/ 07<br />

PM: It is a matter of how she made the decisions. But you see these were<br />
decisions for amateur sports clubs, Stan, for netball courts..<br />
SG: $ 30 million, though.<br />
PM. Yes, that's right. For grants of $ 50, 000 and $ 100,000 to netball<br />
courts, squash courts, basketball courts, for small amateur sporting<br />
organisations that can never get this sort of money. As she said<br />
yesterday, nobody said that any one thing that was built shouldn't be<br />
built. What the Liberals said was, " this is a pity, we are not getting as<br />
much of it as we should". But that didn't stop John Hewson saying that<br />
in one go he would spend $ 30 million on a university without one note<br />
of paper, one bit of evaluation, and when asked, " well how did you<br />
arrive at your $ 30 million, Dr Hewson?" He said contemptuously, put<br />
his fingers up and said " three times ten."<br />
SG: But, Prime Minister, even now after we have had the resignation, we<br />
have had the parliamentary Inquiry, it sounds as though you are still<br />
trying to play it down, still trying to say it is a piddling matter.<br />
PM: No, I am saying that you asked me why she didn't resign early. I said<br />
because there was no hint of impropriety or fraud, but a debate about<br />
the priorities she set and that was going to go on for some time, and<br />
she thought that it was going to do the Government harm.<br />
SG: Do you accept in prolonging it, for as long as it was, that the<br />
Government suffered a lot of damage and gave the Opposition the<br />
opportunity to score a few points?<br />
PM: Let me read to you from today's newspoll, and this is the real story of<br />
the day, Stan. It says, ' despite the Coalitions political success in<br />
forcing the resignation of a Cabinet Minister over the sports affair,<br />
voter dissatisfaction with the Leader of the Opposition, Dr F-fewson, has<br />
re-ached an all time high.'<br />
SG: So, you don't accept that you did suffer any collateral damage, as Kim<br />
Beazely put it?<br />
PM: What has happened in the period since this sport things has been on,<br />
the Government's popularity has risen. Now, it's not to say that the<br />
Government wants the issue around. But what today's newspoll<br />
makes clear, and this would be if you put a stethoscope on the heartbeat<br />
of the Liberal Party in this building today, they wouldn't be talking<br />
about sports they would be talking about the fact that they are going<br />
back~ wards.<br />
S G. Prime Minister, now that one Minister has gone for incompetence,<br />
does this mean that other Ministers are now on notice as well? They<br />
can take it as being warned? </p>
<p>TE. LM: ar. 94 16: 39 No. 026 P. 03/ 07<br />
3<br />
PM: Well, I think, one has to be, competence is part of one's skills in this<br />
life. Now, this Government is 11 years in office and it has been a very<br />
competent Government, but part of that is because of the discretion<br />
Ministers have. This sort of amateur baby blue view of the world, that<br />
a Minister can only do what is on a piece of paper and tick it a piece<br />
of paper from a bureaucrat is only the view that somebody could have<br />
who has never held a big job, who has never held a major portfolio,<br />
who has never made the big decisions. Because this Government has<br />
actually run the policy, it is not being run by the bureaucracy, it is<br />
being run by the Government.<br />
ST-Ok, given that you are going to allow that discretion to continue,<br />
unfettered, how do you make sure that this situation is not repeated<br />
again. The Democrats are calling for a code of conduct, are you<br />
prepared to agree to that?<br />
PM: Well, the first thing the Democrats can do, in any code of conduct, is to<br />
declare their own interests in the Senate. Do you realise Stan that in<br />
the House of Representatives Members and Ministers have to declare<br />
all their personal assets and all their interests. There is no Senate<br />
register. Whenever the Government has proposed a register of<br />
Senators Interests, the Democrats and the Greens and the Liberal<br />
Party between them vote It down. So, the only suggestion I have got to<br />
make to Senator Kemnot, if she wants to start on the questions of<br />
accountability and putting things on the table, they ought to first start<br />
with a register of their assets in the Senate.<br />
SG: So, you are saying no to a deal over a code of conduct?<br />
PM: Well, let them show by actions and deeds, rather than words, that the<br />
Senate is actually interested in putting some code on itself.<br />
SG: So, -you are saying, no you don't want more cheques and balances to<br />
make sure this doesn't happen again?<br />
PM: No, but the same code which the House of Representatives has had<br />
on itself for 10 years. You probably don't quite realise this, but there is<br />
a set of disclosure things in the House of Representatives that there<br />
isn't in the Senate. And yet it is the Senate moralising about codes of<br />
conduct.<br />
SG: Well, again, Prime Minister, you are saying no to Senator Kemnot?<br />
PM: We are saying pass the register in the Senate, show us a modicum,<br />
just a modicum of sincerity on this and we will think about it.<br />
TEL </p>
<p>I TEL 4<br />
SG: She is also saying, Senator Kemnot is also saying that if you agree to<br />
the code of conduct she won't go ahead and support the Opposition for<br />
another inquiry Into the sports rorts affair.<br />
PM: Well, that is a veiled threat, you see.<br />
SG: You don't wear that?<br />
PM: What I said last week, all these minor Parties, almost every week they<br />
have a veiled threat. The current week's threat is, if you don't agree to<br />
this that and everything oflse we will have a senate inquiry into all this.<br />
I mean, last week Senator Kernot -wanted to gaol public servants who<br />
answered back. I mean, those dreadful public servants who happened<br />
to say that they were instructed by the Government and Senators say,<br />
" gaol them, gaol them."'<br />
SG: Now that Graham Richardson has taken over Minister Kelly's portfolio,<br />
is Graham Richardson just holding that portfolio over until Carmen<br />
Lawrence goes into Parliament?<br />
PM: Well, there is a number of things, there is an inquiry, which as you<br />
know, Mr Griffith's will soon be undertaken into these matters<br />
connected wIth Mr Griffith, he has already been cleared by a police<br />
inquiry, which means he has a prospect of returning to the Ministry at<br />
some point. You've got Dr Lawrence's election in Western Australia.<br />
These are choices the Labor Party has got to make.<br />
SG: So the chances are that Dr Lawrence will take over that portfolio?<br />
PM: No, I couldn't say that to you Stan, but at least, obviously, there are<br />
some choices for the government.<br />
SG: What about Ros Kelly's future?<br />
PM: She was a great Environment Minister and she has a very proud<br />
record and I think it is worth recording that, can I just give you a couple<br />
of instances: she negotiated the agreement on the National Forest<br />
Policy; developed and implemented the Commonwealth's endangered<br />
species legislation; established Ocean Rescue 2000; made major<br />
advances in the World Heritage Listing at Shark Bay, Fraser Island<br />
and Kakadu; established the National Reserve System Program;<br />
established the Feral Pest Program, this is a very proud record from an<br />
Environment Minister.<br />
SG-But, for all of that, she will be remembered for the ' sports rorts' affair<br />
and having to resign over that. What about her future?<br />
P M: She will go now to the backbench of the Parliamentary Party to the<br />
Caucus. TE. NLa r 94 16~ 3 No 026 P 04/ 0 </p>
<p>i I L L<br />
SG: No chance of being recycled at ra Graham Richardson?<br />
PM: And if she wishes to recontest a place in the Ministry, well, of course,<br />
that is going to be open to her and open to the Caucus to consider her<br />
again at some time -should she so choose.<br />
SO: Do you look at that favourably?<br />
PM: It is not a matter of whether I look at it favourably. At some point in<br />
time every member of the Caucus has a right to offer themselves for<br />
selection.<br />
SG:-But, after this affair, do you think it is feasible that she could possibly<br />
come back?<br />
PM:. The thing Is, I don't think at the moment it is even in her mind.<br />
SG: The Opposition has already signalled that it is going to go on the<br />
attack after this. It has asked questions already about your piggery. It<br />
has also said that Dr Lawrence will be targeted once she gets into<br />
Federal Parliament, so how are you going to counter that?<br />
PM;. Malcolm Fraser the other day said this: twelve months since the<br />
loss of the March 1993 election, we are as much in the dark about<br />
what the Liberal Party stands for as we were the day Fightback was<br />
buried very condemnatory statement by a former Liberal Party<br />
Prime Minister. In other words, the Liberal Party's problem Stan, is<br />
they have no policy, their leader is at 26 per cent approval rating, they<br />
would lose an election if it was held today and they think now their<br />
recourse because they believe they are going to lose the next election<br />
and they are facing a further five years in opposition, they think what<br />
they'll do is throw mud as some sort of substitute for policy. Well, what<br />
the -electoral record shows is that people without a policy, without<br />
substance, without a link and contact and understanding of the<br />
Australian community don't get returned to office.<br />
SO: Prime Minister, Peter Costello today has been contacted by Federal<br />
Police wishing to interview him over leaked documents in this ' sports<br />
rorts' affair. What do you make of that?<br />
PM: Probably the Secretary of the Department, sensibly, and not<br />
unreasonably, when documents are stolen from the Department of<br />
Finance has asked the Police to investigate it.<br />
SG:-He says it is an attempt to harass and intimidate public servants who<br />
have been making information public about malpractice. 1. 11 a r-., j4 io NO r U, </p>
<p>TEL.: M ar .94 16: 39 No. 026 P. 06/ 0-(<br />
6<br />
PM: Does he mean the same public servants they are threatening to goal in<br />
the Senate? Are they the same ones that the Liberal party will vote to<br />
discipline in the Senate? Look, Stan, don't believe that nonsense. If<br />
the Department of Finance seeks a recourse to the police for loss of<br />
documents and the trail leads to Mr Costello, that's Mr Costello's<br />
problem.<br />
SG: Prime Minister, finally, one of the things to come out of this of course,<br />
was that disgraceful performance in Parliament last week. How can<br />
you make sure that that is not going to happen again?<br />
PM: What that was about was that Dr Hewson was defeated in his<br />
executive, was obliged to move a censure motion against me over the<br />
sports affair he didn't want to do it. When he did it he made a mess<br />
of it. It was a terribly weak speech.<br />
SG: But you stirred the pot didn't you?<br />
PM: No, hang on..<br />
SG: You got your backbenchers do create a bit of a raucous.<br />
PM: No, it was a terribly weak speech and so because the Liberal's said<br />
well, what will we do now, our blokes made a mess of it? They said<br />
let's make the news " Parliamentary uproar'. So, then it was all about<br />
them telling the Speaker off and jumping up and abusing so..<br />
SO: Your slde is not innocent in that either.<br />
PM. No, but the story was not " Hewson weak: hopeless speech" but<br />
" Parliamentary uproa3'. mhat was an instant decision the Liberal party<br />
fr ontbench made when Dr Hewson finished his speech. Now Stan,<br />
look, they are a desperate little bunch, they have been in opposition<br />
for eleven years heading to thirteen and, 1 believe, going to sixteen.<br />
SG: But you are as much to blame for that little effort last week, how can<br />
you make sure that it doesn't happen again?<br />
PM: I beg your pardon. No I wasn't. I got up and made a speech. They<br />
censured a Prime Minister and allowed me five and a half minutes out<br />
of fifteen to reply, the other ten minutes were taken up by raucous<br />
noise and abuse.<br />
SG: Stephen Martin, the Speaker, is talking about having to bring Arnold<br />
Schwarzenegger into Parliament to have some sort of control. Has it<br />
really gone that far?<br />
PM: If you look at Parliaments around the world, this one is a fairly demure<br />
one. Look at the Japanese, the Korean Parliament, the Italian<br />

Parliament let's not over do the hyperbole. What happened here<br />
the Liberal party leader made a censure on the Government, on the<br />
Prime Minister, failed and his front bench to smother for him decided<br />
they would have a day of parliamentary hi jinx. Stan, these things<br />
come and go. The next day I was In Tasmania pulling together an<br />
historic agreement between the Commonwealth and the States to open<br />
up the water, electricity, railways and ports of this country to<br />
competitive breezes. That day I was in the course of getting across<br />
those issues. The following day we actually came to an historic<br />
agreement with the States. As far as I am concerned if the Liberal<br />
party wants to get Involved in Parliamentary nonsense as distinct from<br />
substance-let them.<br />
SG: If the Speaker Stephen Martin has to discipline the Government, has to<br />
throw any of your Ministers out of Parliament, how would you react to<br />
that?<br />
PM; Speakers have done that in the past.<br />
SG: You would accept that?<br />
PM: The Speaker has disciplined Government members in the past. Of<br />
course I would accept that.<br />
SO: So he would be under no threat at all if he did that?<br />
PM: No, but the Speaker sensibly, will make his own judgements about<br />
these matters. It is not a matter of me or you deciding some strategy<br />
for him. What happened here was basically a rudderless Opposition<br />
with a leader now nobody supports, a weak leader, a weak person who<br />
can't cut the mustard In policy or In discipline or in organisation, is<br />
sitting there with a divided Opposition and the only tactic they know is<br />
now noise and disruption.<br />
SG: Prime Minister, for all the attacks you have made today on Dr Hewson,<br />
you are the one who is being accused today of having looked after a<br />
mate for too long.<br />
PM: Mrs Kelly resigned her position and she has paid the price for<br />
whatever is believed to be the management of this program. But<br />
again, let me repeat, after a very distinguished ministerial career in the<br />
environment and in other portfolios, no hint of fraud or impropriety, an<br />
argument simply about choices and one which would have gone on for<br />
months.<br />
ends </p>
