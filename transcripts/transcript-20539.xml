    <content><![CDATA[<p>Your Excellency, the Minister for Defence, the Chief of the Defence Force, Admiral Ritchie, Leader of the Opposition, Commander van Balen, men and women of the ship's company of HMAS Sydney, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. This is another very proud and important moment for the Royal Australian Navy and for the Australian Defence Force. Over the past few weeks elements of all three arms of the Australian armed forces have in a very distinguished, professional, effective and always honourable way done great service in the name of our nation in a just cause.</p>
<p> And I want to take this opportunity at this gathering to record my deep admiration and appreciation to all of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who have been on service in the Gulf region over recent weeks. They have won the admiration and the pride of all Australians, they have won the respect and the admiration of many around the world. As others have said, this vessel carries a very ancient and honourable name in the Royal Australian Navy and I know that what you will do over the weeks ahead will be the equal of what your forbeares have done in serving on a vessel carrying this very same name.</p>
<p>It is my hope that during your time and in the not too distant future the really hostile part of the war to disarm Iraq will have terminated. But that does not mean there will not be very important work following the formal cessation of hostilities, it does not mean that the flow of humanitarian assistance will not need escort support, it will not mean that we will be free form the possibility of attempts by dissident elements to keep the hostilities going. So the work that lies ahead of you is every bit as important as the work that has been carried out by your colleagues, the other men and women of the Australian Defence Force.</p>
<p>Let me say to the families who are here - we understand the mixture of pride and anxiety that you feel. We endeavour to share that. We will do everything we can while your loved ones are away to help you and to support you and to provide any assistance that you may ask for. It's a great defence family. We're all obligated and we're all anxious to do everything we can to make it as easy as possible for you.</p>
<p>I finally want to say to all of the men and women who are going - we admire you, we thank you, we respect you. You go forward in the name of your nation as part of a great military tradition which has always sought to uphold what is right, which has always sought to behave not only in a professional and effective fashion, but also in a totally honourable fashion completely consistent with the values of our great community.</p>
<p> On behalf of all Australians I wish you luck and we all look forward to your safe and early return. Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
