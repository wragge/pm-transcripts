HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING<br />
CNBFRRA 11 MAY 1992<br />
COMUIQUEz<br />
INTRODUCTION The Prime Minister, Premiers and Chief Ministers and the<br />
President of the Australian Local Government Association<br />
held wide ranging discussions in Canberra today on<br />
national issues of mutual concern. These issues included<br />
Commonwealth-State financial arrangements and a range of<br />
measures for improving national economic and structural<br />
efficiency, including measures in the areas of road and<br />
rail transport, the electricity industry, mutual<br />
recognition of regulation and vocational education and<br />
training.<br />
COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS<br />
Heads of Government discussed the immediate and<br />
medium-term outlook for their respective budgets and<br />
intergovernmental financial relations.<br />
In discussing the paper prepared by the States on<br />
Commonwealth-State financial relaticns, the Commonwealth<br />
acknowledged that the States needed to be adequately<br />
resourced and that the predictability, flexibility and<br />
growth of State funding were agreed objectives. The<br />
States will decide later this week whether the June<br />
Premiers' Conference should consider financial<br />
arrangements for 1992-93 only or also for a longer<br />
period. The Conference agreed that a Committee of Commonwealth,<br />
State and Territory Treasury officials would prepare a<br />
report on budgetary prospects and issues for<br />
consideration at the forthcoming financial Premiers'<br />
Conference. It would take account of both cyclical and<br />
structural factors at both the Commonwealth and State<br />
level in the context of a national budgetary strategy for<br />
all governments. This report could provide a basis for<br />
considering general purpose funding for the States in<br />
1992-93 and, if necessary, longer term financial<br />
arrangements. If the June Premiers' Conference decides only on 1992-93<br />
funding arrangements, a report on longer-term<br />
arrangements will be prepared by early 1993.<br />
MEETINGS OF HEADS OF GOVERNMENT<br />
Leaders and representatives agreed to establish a<br />
" Council of Australian Governments" as a permanent body<br />
for on-going consultation between the Prime Minister, </p>
<p>Premiers, Chief Ministers and the President of the<br />
Australian Local Government Association.<br />
Leaders and representatives have agreed that there will<br />
be a meeting of the " Council of Australian Governments"<br />
at least once each year, in addition to the financial<br />
Premiers' Conference, and that the Prime Minister will<br />
chair the meetings.<br />
The role of the " Council of Australian Governments" is:<br />
increasing co-operation among governments in the<br />
national interest;<br />
co-operation among goverrnents on reforms to achieve<br />
an integrated, efficient national economy and single<br />
national market;<br />
continuing structural reform of government and<br />
review of relationships among governments consistent<br />
with the national interest; and<br />
consultation on other major issues by agreement such<br />
as: international treaties which affect the States<br />
and Territories and which have not been<br />
resolved through the agreed processes;<br />
major initiatives of one government which<br />
impact on other governments;<br />
major whole-of -government issues arising from<br />
Ministerial Council deliberations.<br />
The venue for meetings of the Council will rotate between<br />
the States and Territories and there will be joint<br />
Commonwealth and State/ Territory involvement in providing<br />
secretariat arrangements.<br />
Leaders and representatives agreed that the first meeting<br />
of the Council should consider broad protocols for the<br />
operation of Ministerial Councils. Heads of Government<br />
noted the significant cooperation and consultation<br />
between Governments which now occurs through Ministerial<br />
Councils of Commonwealth and State Ministers. However,<br />
there are now more than 40 such Councils, many meeting<br />
several times a year.<br />
MUTUAL RECOGNITION<br />
The Heads of Government of the Commonwealth, States and<br />
Territories signed a final Agreement to introduce<br />
legislation to eliminate regulatory impediments to a<br />
national market in goods and services. It is expected to<br />
greatly enhance the international competitiveness of the<br />
Australian economy and is recognised by Heads of </p>
<p>Government as a vital initiative in the achievement of<br />
microeconomic reform.<br />
The Agreement provides for all jurisdictions to enact<br />
legislation so that goods that can be sold lawfully in<br />
one State may be sold freely in any other State or<br />
Territory. The legislation will not apply to certain<br />
products, such as firearms, prohibited and offensive<br />
weapons and pornography.<br />
Similarly, with occupations, if a person is registered to<br />
carry out an occupation in-one State or Territory he or<br />
she will be entitled to be registered to undertake the<br />
equivalent occupation in any other State or Territory.<br />
The States and Territories agreed that they will request<br />
and empower the Commonwealth to pass a single Act which<br />
will apply equally throughout Australia and will<br />
automatically override any State or Territory laws or<br />
regulations which are inconsistent with the principles of<br />
mutual recognition. The Commonwealth will be a full<br />
Party to the Agreement.<br />
The Agreement also provides a mechanism for achieving<br />
negotiated uniform national standards, where necessary in<br />
the interests of public health or safety or environmental<br />
protection. States and Territories reaffirmed their<br />
agreement to be bound by the decisions of two thirds or<br />
more of Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers<br />
voting within Ministerial Councils to develop a national<br />
standard when the need for such a standard becomes<br />
evident as a-result of the operation of mutual<br />
recognition. The Commonwealth has agreed to be bound by<br />
recommendations of the Commonwealth-State Consumer<br />
Affairs Product Safety Advisory Committee, approved by<br />
Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers, with respect<br />
to standards for goods under the Trade Practices Act.<br />
Heads of Government agreed on a revised timetable for<br />
implementation of mutual recognition. It is proposed<br />
that States and Territories enact their necessary<br />
legislation by 31 October 1992; and that the Commonwealth<br />
legislation be enacted by 1 January 1993, with<br />
proclamation by 1 March 1993.<br />
Heads of Government noted a report on progress in the<br />
development of national competency standards for<br />
professions and occupations. They expect that where<br />
these are available, national competency standards will<br />
do much to facilitate the smooth operation of mutual<br />
recognition in respect of the occupations. They also<br />
noted work done on the development of uniform standards<br />
in relation to occupational health and safety and<br />
dangerous goods. They reaffirmed that a national<br />
solution to the treatment of partially regulated<br />
occupations is a matter of high priority. </p>
<p>Heads of Government also endorsed the other<br />
recommendations contained in the Report of the<br />
Commonwealth-State Committee on Regulatory Reform.<br />
ROAD TRANSPORT<br />
Leaders and representatives noted the Commonwealth's<br />
decision to provide an additional S25 million in 1991-92,<br />
$ 437.5 million in 1992-93 and $ 140 million in 1993-94 for<br />
augmenting and rehabilitating the National Highway<br />
System, accelerating selected National Arterial projects<br />
and expanding the Black Spots program. They also noted<br />
the positive employment effects of this expenditure in<br />
the period up to 1993-94.<br />
Leaders and representatives agreed to the role and<br />
functions of the National Road Transport Commission. An<br />
Agreement has been signed by the Commonwealth, New South<br />
Wales, Victoria and South Australia to this end.<br />
Queensland indicated its intention to sign.<br />
The Commission was established after the July 1991 Heads<br />
of Government meeting to develop national road transport<br />
legislation and regulations and to recommend on charges<br />
to apply no later than 1 January 1993 for vehicles over<br />
tonnes. It will now also be responsible for<br />
developing regulations for all other road users.<br />
In addition, the Commission is to assemble and publish<br />
comparative information on the funding and management of<br />
roads, performance indicators for the road system and the<br />
efficiency and effectiveness of road authorities.<br />
Leaders and representatives agreed that it was important<br />
to delineate clearly Commonwealth and State road<br />
responsibilities. The Prime Minister indicated that he<br />
would shortly be advising the States of the Commonwealth<br />
position on the National Highway System.<br />
It was confirmed that $ 350 million of the Commonwealth<br />
roads program would be untied. The Prime Minister<br />
indicated that he would be writing to other Heads of<br />
Government soon on an appropriate basis for this<br />
distribution, including continuing the distribution<br />
currently applying to the road funding being untied, with<br />
a view to settling the matter before the June Premiers'<br />
Conference. RAIL REFORM<br />
The Commonwealth's readiness to provide $ 454 million over<br />
the next two years to complement the National Rail<br />
Corporation's 10-year $ 1.7 billion investment program was<br />
noted. Leaders and representatives agreed that further rail<br />
reform is required if the significant potential economic<br />
gains are to be realised. </p>
<p>They noted that a number of the reforms were consistent<br />
with measures already adopted by the States, but that<br />
there was still considerable scope for increasing the<br />
efficiency of the rail sector.<br />
Acknowledging this and the importance of early reform,<br />
the New South Wales, Victorian, Queensland, and Western<br />
Australian Premiers agreed to continue to pursue and<br />
accelerate reform of their rail systems over the next<br />
three years.<br />
ELECTRICITY GENERATION, TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION<br />
It was agreed to develop an interstate transmission<br />
network across the eastern States and that the National<br />
Grid Management Council would report on the precise<br />
nature and operating guidelines of the structure by the<br />
end of 1992. To achieve this, Heads of Government agreed<br />
to the principle of separate generation and transmission<br />
elements in the electricity sector.<br />
Western Australia, while not part of a national grid,<br />
supports the above. South Australia wishes to look<br />
further at the implications for its system. Tasmania's<br />
participation in a national grid will be dependent on the<br />
development of a Basslink proposal.<br />
Heads of Government agreed to finalise the draft national<br />
grid protocol prepared by the National Grid Management<br />
Council via correspondence by the end of June.<br />
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING<br />
Heads of Government agreed on the necessity of achieving<br />
a major increase in the level of vocational education and<br />
training opportunities across Australia, consistent with<br />
the national participation targets arising from the<br />
recent report of the Finn Committee.<br />
In line with this objective, Heads of Government resolved<br />
that: governmental responsibilities for the funding and<br />
resourcing of vocational education and training<br />
should be settled as a matter of urgency;<br />
there was an urgent need also to advance the agreed<br />
agenda of national training reform, including<br />
consideration of the proposals for reform of entrylevel<br />
training flowing from the recent report of the<br />
Employment and Skills Formation Council ( Carmichael<br />
Report); governments should work further to clarify issues<br />
for the June Premiers' Conference on funding and<br />
administrative arrangements under the Commonwealth<br />
model and the National Partnership model for </p>
<p>vocational education and training, with particular<br />
reference to:<br />
the detailed financial implications;<br />
responsibility for decision making; and<br />
the relationship between proposals for<br />
government schools and TAFE and training.<br />
Heads of Government agreed that the issue of youth<br />
employment and training is. one of national priority and<br />
will be further progressed at the June meeting.<br />
ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS<br />
Heads of Government endorsed the document " Achieving<br />
Greater Coordination of Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander Programs and Services". This establishes a<br />
framework of principles and a plan of action for improved<br />
intergovernmental relations in Aboriginal affairs.<br />
Heads of Government recognised the role of ATSIC, but<br />
noted that its creation had introduced complexities into<br />
the relationship between governments. These would be<br />
addressed in the period ahead, in particular the<br />
operation of section 18 of the ATSIC Act in relation to<br />
grants to States and Territories.<br />
The great majority of the 339 recommendations of the<br />
Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody had<br />
been accepted by governments. Heads of Government were<br />
committed to continuing to address issues of Aboriginal<br />
disadvantage. The Prime Minister reiterated the<br />
Commonwealth's commitment to announce an additional<br />
package of measures by mid-year and Premiers and Chief<br />
Ministers indicated that they would continue to give<br />
Aboriginal needs high priority in their 1992-93 budgets.<br />
ENVIRONMENT Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment<br />
Leaders and representatives noted that the Agreement has<br />
now been signed by all parties and affirmed their<br />
commitment to co-operating on its implementation. It<br />
provides a framework for co-operation in this area to<br />
achieve better environment protection and greater<br />
certainty of government and business decision making.<br />
E~ fl/ nrPenhouqA<br />
Leaders and representatives noted progress on the<br />
development of national strategies on Ecologically<br />
Sustainable Development ( ESD) and Greenhouse. In the<br />
light of the range and complexity of issues involved and<br />
in order to facilitate effective public consultation,<br />
leaders and representatives agreed that the draft </p>
<p>7<br />
strategies should be released by the end of June as<br />
officials' discussion papers. They further agreed that<br />
officials should bring forward proposals for the<br />
definitive strategies by the end of October with a view<br />
to agreement being reached in time for the release of the<br />
strategies by the end of 1992.<br />
Leaders and representatives emphasised the importance of<br />
linkages between the ESD process and other relevant<br />
Commonwealth environmental initiatives and activities. </p>
