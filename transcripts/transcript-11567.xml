    <content><![CDATA[<p>I would like warmly to congratulate South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il on the successful conclusion of their historic summit. As the first meeting of Korean leaders in 55 years, the summit marks a significant step toward improved communication and understanding between the Koreas.</p>
<p>I particularly want to acknowledge the special role of President Kim Dae-jung in bringing the summit to fruition. His engagement of North Korea reflects his personal vision and dedication to improving relations between the Koreas.</p>
<p>Australia stands firmly in support of President Kim Dae-jung's policy, a point I was able to make to him personally during my visit to Korea last month.</p>
<p>Australia is doing its part to improve peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. We have contributed $15.8 million to the Korean Energy Development Organisation (KEDO) to support efforts to end North Korea's nuclear weapons programme and $19.5 million for humanitarian aid to North Korea. Australia renewed its diplomatic ties with North Korea in May to encourage that country to engage fully with South Korea and to take genuine steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>I certainly acknowledge that the path towards peace and reconciliation will be a long and difficult one but I want to express my respect and admiration to the two leaders for taking this first, historic step down that path.</p>
