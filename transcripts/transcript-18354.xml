The Government is very concerned about developments today in Papua New Guinea and is monitoring developments closely.</p>
<p>PNG is a close friend and partner of Australia's.  We want a PNG which is politically stable and economically successful.</p>

<p>It is critical therefore that this situation be resolved peacefully as soon as possible, with the PNG Defence Force chain of command restored</p>
<p>Our High Commissioner in Port Moresby is conveying those points to PNG's political leadership. </p>
