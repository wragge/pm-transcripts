PRIME MINISTER 7<br />
PRESS STATEMENTNOVEMBER 14, 1975<br />
Mr Whitlam's assertion that I should have resigned on the<br />
basis of Tuesdays No Confidence Motion is nonsense. The<br />
present situation arose because for the first time in nearly<br />
200 years a Prime Minister refused to resign when Parliament<br />
cut off his money.<br />
Mr Whitlam refused to seek an election and refused to give<br />
the people of Australia the vote which was needed to resolve<br />
the situation. If he had done this he would have faced the<br />
electors as Prime Minister.<br />
Knowing quite well the Liberal and National Country Parties<br />
did not have a majority in the House of Representatives, I<br />
recommended a double dissolution to the Governor General<br />
immediately the Appropriation Bills had received the royal<br />
assent. That recommendation<br />
to the Labor Party.<br />
position were cited<br />
enabling them to be<br />
of Parliament after<br />
to use that device. was in the most favourable terms possible<br />
The 21 bills in a double dissolution<br />
in the petition dissolving Parliament, thus<br />
put to a joint sitting of the two chambers<br />
December 13 if the new Government chooses<br />
We certainly would not do so. The bills contain arbitrary and<br />
dictatorial powers. / 2 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER -2-<br />
The dissolution thus is in the fairest possible form. The<br />
course was open to Mr Whitlam<br />
It was a proper course of action which he refused.<br />
The great difference between Mr Whitlam and myself was in<br />
recognising that neither of us had command of Parliament.<br />
Mr Whitlam refused to understand that and to seek an election.<br />
I recommended an election forthwith, so that the voters could<br />
decide this issue. </p>
