PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 1 DECEMBER 1978<br />
The Prime Minister announced today. two initiatives which<br />
are significant in the Government's determination to gain<br />
for Australia the positive benefits of technological<br />
innovation and the better understanding of labour market<br />
questions. The Prime Minister said that he particularly welcomed the<br />
initiatives which industry and the unions with Government<br />
had taken through the NLCC through the establishment of a<br />
Tripartite Committee to examine labour market questions<br />
under the Chairmanship of Mr. B. Trethowan; Chairman of<br />
the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. He noted<br />
that the Committee's terms of reference would be to examine<br />
the effects on employment, particularly of young people,<br />
of the following factors:<br />
the effect of particular aspects of labour<br />
costs on employment such as penalty rates,<br />
rates of pay for juniors and other labour costs<br />
affecting the employment of young people;<br />
the effect of working ratterns on employment<br />
factors such as weekend work, part time work<br />
and possible new arrangements such as<br />
job sharing;<br />
the importance and utilisation of qualifications,<br />
especially trade skills, obtained through<br />
migration; the labour relations asrects of technological<br />
change; and<br />
the effect on job opportunities of different<br />
sectors of the labour force of changes in<br />
participation rates of other sectors.<br />
He emphasized that if there was to be better understanding and<br />
action on these issues the Committee would need to consult<br />
widely. For that reason arrangements would be made for<br />
State Government representatives to be co-opted to the<br />
Committee, and for experts from industry, unions and Government<br />
to be drawn on as appropriate. </p>

The Prime Minister said that the second initiative related<br />
to the Government's belief that it is essential for a<br />
country such as Australia to take full advantage of the<br />
benefits of new technology.<br />
The Government had therefore decided to establish a<br />
Committee of Inquiry to examine, report and make<br />
recommendations on the process of technological change<br />
in Australian industry in order to maximise economic,<br />
social and other benefits and minimise any possible<br />
adverse consequences.<br />
In particular the Committee would:<br />
identify: technol ' ogical change which is occurring or<br />
is likely to occur in Australia; and<br />
( ii) new technologies which have the potential<br />
for substantial impact in Australia;<br />
and to conduct detailed studies of those<br />
areas identified as the most important<br />
in order to evaluate the likely effects;<br />
examine relevant overseas experience and studies<br />
of technological change, and to assess mechanisms<br />
used to introduce and evaluate new technologies;<br />
review the effectiveness of Government policies<br />
and programs in facilitating the introduction of<br />
new technology.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the Committee of Inquiry would<br />
include union representation; that the Government would<br />
make $ 750,000 available for the conduct of the Inquiry and<br />
that a high quality Secretariat to the Inquiry would be<br />
established in the Department of Productivity.<br />
The Prime Minister said that these two initiatives<br />
demonstrated the Government's concern for the difficult<br />
issues involved in responding to technolgical change as<br />
seen against the whole range of aspects affecting the<br />
labour market. 000---</p>
