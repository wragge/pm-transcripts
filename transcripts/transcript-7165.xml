PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
* GRADUATION ADDRESS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
SYDNEY 23 APRIL 1987<br />
Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, Dean, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Through you, Vice-Chancellor, this distinguished institution<br />
has done me a great honour in awarding me this Doctorate of<br />
Laws. it is now 37 years since I received my first degree,<br />
graduating as a Bachelor of Laws from the University of<br />
Western Australia in 1950. I did not expect that in the<br />
years to follow I would receive six subsequent degrees but<br />
let me quickly add that I did not earn all of them by dint<br />
of my own academic endeavours. For in addition to my two<br />
degrees-from Western Australia and Bachelor of Letters<br />
from Oxford, I have had the very great pleasure of receiving<br />
four honorary doctorates from the University of Western<br />
Australia, from Nanjing University in China, from the Hebrewl.<br />
University in Jerusalem and, today, from the University of<br />
New South Wales.<br />
That list certainly does not downplay the significance for<br />
me of today's ceremony. Far from it I value your degree<br />
very highly and I am honoured and eager to take up your<br />
invitation to address this group of graduates at the<br />
University of New South Wales today.<br />
In the four decades since I was an undergraduate in Perth,<br />
the nation and world of which we are part have changed<br />
almost beyond recognition. Yet as I speak to you today, we<br />
are caught up in an even more pressing process of change, in<br />
the universities, in the nation and indeed in the world as a<br />
whole. More than ever before Australia is caught up by the dynamics<br />
of change in the international economy. So, more than ever<br />
before, the stimulation and excitement and intellectual<br />
questioning which is the essential abiding quality of the<br />
university experience must be turned to the urgent concern:<br />
how do we master change? How best do we meet the challenge<br />
of change; how best do we exploit its opportunities; and<br />
how best do we bear its burdens? </p>
<p>Some indication of the magnitude of the change emerges from<br />
the list of universities I just recited. Two of the<br />
universities which have awarded me honorary degrees are<br />
Nanjing University and the Hebrew University. In 1950, when<br />
I graduated in Perth, Israel was a fledgling state while<br />
China was emerging from a great revolution and was entering<br />
a prolonged period of ostracism from much of the rest of the<br />
world. Both the Chinese people and the Jewish people had<br />
great hopes but also great trauma ahead of them and behind<br />
them. No-one in 1950 could have confidently predicted that<br />
the Australian Prime Minister in 1987 would hold honorary<br />
degrees from universities in both these nations.<br />
Yet the fortunes of Australia today are inextricably<br />
enmeshed with those of China, since we are both part of the<br />
world's most dynamic economic region, the Pacific rim. And<br />
while Australia is certainly not a party principal to any<br />
resolution of the problems besetting the Middle East, we see<br />
profound moral and political imperatives in our commitment<br />
to the security of Israel while supporting also the<br />
principle of self-determination for the Palestinian people.<br />
These two examples illustrate in a personal way what is true<br />
of Australia as a whole we are inextricably bound up in<br />
the political and economic and social issues confronting the<br />
whole world. Unless we comprehend and master * those issues,<br />
they may overwhelm us.<br />
The ceremony of the conferring of degrees in which we have<br />
participat * ed today is an old one, one replete with<br />
traditions. But however venerable those traditions, we<br />
would be wrong if we allowed them to eclipse the more<br />
important contemporary element of today's ceremony.<br />
Despite our traditional academic garb, we are, as we sit<br />
here today, thoroughly caught up in the affairs of a modern<br />
society and an international economy.<br />
This audience includes gra duates in the Faculty of Applied<br />
Science and the Board of Studies in Science and<br />
Mathematics people who will be at the cutting edge of many<br />
of the most crucial issues the nation will face in the next<br />
several decades.<br />
Australia is in many ways facing its greatest challenge<br />
since the Second World war a challenge which presents<br />
opportunities as well as burdens. As university graduates<br />
you represent part of the nation's accumulation of talent<br />
and knowledge that must be applied to mastering this<br />
evolving environment.<br />
You are products of our politically free, dynamic and<br />
exciting society and the horizons you face are virtually<br />
limitless. But you must also carry the responsibility to<br />
help solve its problems, and bear part of the sacrifices<br />
imposed on us by our economic circumstances. </p>
<p>Many of you will have heard me state the nature and<br />
dimensions of Australia's trading problem. The collapse in<br />
our export prices has meant a staggering drop in the<br />
nation's income. In just two years 1985 and 1986 our<br />
terms of trade have declined by nearly 18 per cent.<br />
As a result, as the latest national account figures reveal,<br />
our income has been slashed by some $ 9 billion in the<br />
order of $ 2000 a year for every Australian family.<br />
To resolve the trade problem we will not be able simply to<br />
rely on the primary exports which have traditionally formed<br />
the backbone of our income-earning capacity.<br />
In order to increase our national income Australia has to<br />
look to manufacturing and service industries especially<br />
the knowledge-intensive industries in which many of you will<br />
be involved.<br />
The hard fact is this: if Australians are to maintain and<br />
improve their standard of living, and to provide for those<br />
less fortunate than themselves, Australia must markedly<br />
increase its level of exports of manufactured goods and<br />
services. So business men and women must become more literate in the<br />
issues of science and technology, while at the same time<br />
universities must become more responsive to the special<br />
demands of industry.<br />
Many of you will be aware of these problems from your<br />
studies. As you enter your careers many of you will come to<br />
understand the limitations of and, I hope, benefit from the<br />
opportunities presented by the nation's economic<br />
circumstances. What must be clear is that as university graduates in<br />
science and technology-related areas, you have the<br />
opportunity, and indeed the responsibility, to harness your<br />
research talents in the task of building these new export<br />
industries and of fostering Australian competitiveness and<br />
industrial innovation.<br />
Clearly, all levels of government have responsibilities in<br />
the job of lifting the level of skills in the workforce.<br />
The Federal Government meets its responsibility across a<br />
broad-front: through education and training, through<br />
manpower programs and adjustment assistance, and through<br />
immigration the last of which has not only helped improve<br />
the skills of the workforce but has also built a richer and<br />
more diverse multicultural society.<br />
Government however is but one actor in what must be a<br />
national effort to improve our research effort capacities.<br />
Australia as a whole needs to develop a culture in which<br />
relevant qualifications are respected and in which regular<br />
upgrading of skills is a normal part of any career. </p>
<p>industry has a particular responsibility to encourage this<br />
awareness and to recognise that those working directly on<br />
the shop floor are often well placed to suggest improvements<br />
in the work environment.<br />
industry must also increase its research and development<br />
effort above what is by world standards a very low level.<br />
The low priority accorded R and D by the private sector is<br />
one of the most clear cut failings of Australian industry.<br />
It suggests that there are, at least in this country, real<br />
limits on the extent to which market forces alone should<br />
determine economic outcomes. The public sector R and D<br />
effort has traditionally been streets ahead of that of the<br />
private sector.<br />
Rectifying this imbalance is the purpose of generous tax<br />
concessions offered by this Government: companies engaging<br />
in R and D work can qualify for 150 per cent tax concessions<br />
for the relevant expenditure.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
We must not underestimate the size of the challenge before<br />
US. I am aware that this university does not underestimate it.<br />
That awareness is based not just on the quality of today's<br />
graduates but also on your pioneering establishment of<br />
Unisea ' rch, the first company established by an Australian<br />
universit'y to develop, manufacture and market ideas<br />
generated by the university's researchers.<br />
Unisearch now has an annual turnover of about $ 7 million andis<br />
last year expanded its operations to serve M'acquarie<br />
University also. I wish it well in its work.<br />
I hasten to point out that I do not believe universities<br />
exist solely to serve industry. I do not argue that<br />
endeavouring to meet the changing and sometimes<br />
unpredictable needs of industry should be the sole objective<br />
of our education system.<br />
There is however an urgent need for universities and other<br />
tertiary institutions to complement their pure research and<br />
their study of the humanities with applied work; to share<br />
their skills and insights with the rest of the community<br />
which supports them and thereby contribute to solving the<br />
problems of contemporary Australia.<br />
In addition to the successful work of Unisearch, other<br />
notable examples of increased linkages between education and<br />
industry include the first formal meeting of representatives<br />
of the business sector and the universities, held late last<br />
year by the Business Council of Australia and the Australian<br />
Vice Chancellors' Committee. </p>
<p>Further, an Industry Reference Group has been set up by the<br />
Education Minister, Senator Ryan, to involve industry more<br />
closely in education planning.<br />
Also notable is the financial support from the business<br />
community towards Melbourne University's Graduate School of<br />
Management which I opened last year. The Graduate School of<br />
Management at Macquarie University, currently under<br />
construction, has received a similar level of direct<br />
financial assistance from business.<br />
And in this context too I note that the Australian Science<br />
and Technology Council ( ASTEC), has recently produced a<br />
major report on research in universities. This report<br />
questioned the return which the nation receives from its<br />
investment in higher education research.<br />
The ASTEC report concludes that, if tertiary institutions<br />
are to contribute more fully to national development, the<br />
allocation of higher education research resources needs to<br />
be more flexible, and permit greater concentration of<br />
research in particular fields and on the most outstanding<br />
researchers. The report recommends that greater emphasis<br />
should be placed on the direct funding of higher education<br />
research. The Government is now giving close attention to the ASTEC<br />
report and while I am not yet in a position to state the<br />
Government's views on it I can assure you that we are<br />
considering very carefully the issues it raises.<br />
I have great confidence that Australia will solve its<br />
economic weaknesses that the economy will manage to<br />
restructure and will emerge on a more competitive basis.<br />
That confidence is based in no small measure upon you, the<br />
university graduates, who will become the innovators and<br />
intellectual entrepreneurs of the future.<br />
These then, however briefly sketched, are some of the<br />
opportunities that are presented to you as university<br />
graduates by the dynamic process of change we are<br />
experiencing. But I said at the outset that change brings<br />
with it not just challenge and opportunities but burdens<br />
too. So let me address today one of those specific burdens which<br />
has recently, preoccupied some of your colleagues in the<br />
student body, namely, the tertiary education administration<br />
charge.<br />
An unavoidable part of my Government's strategy for<br />
restoring economic growth and prosperity has been our<br />
acceptance of the need for an unparalleled exercise of<br />
restraint in Government spending. </p>
<p>When we came to office in 1983, a deficit of some $ 9.6<br />
billion was in prospect that is, the Government deficit<br />
was set to hit about 5 per cent of GDP. Under my<br />
Government, we have taken the hard decisions necessary to<br />
cut that deficit back to about 1.5 per cent.<br />
As you all know, we are still engaged in this task in the<br />
preparation of the M'ay Economic Statement.<br />
We have n * ot embarked on this course out of any masochistic<br />
sense of pleasure at imposing sacrifice and hardship on the<br />
community. On the contrary, a reduction in government<br />
spending is an integral part in the long-term effort to<br />
improve living standards for all Australians.<br />
And it is a valuable exercise at any time for Governments,<br />
indeed for all institutions, to review their activities to<br />
discover if better ways exist of achieving their goals..<br />
Over its four years in office this Government has not, I<br />
think,. gained a reputation for an easy, complacent,<br />
acceptance of hand-me-down solutions to the problems we have<br />
encountered.<br />
As part of this process we decided last year that we should<br />
impose a modest administrative charge on students enrolling<br />
in tertiary institutions.<br />
We did it with the certainty that upon graduation most<br />
tertiary students will join the ranks of the better-off<br />
members * of ' our society.<br />
As such, most tertiary students are well able to share the<br />
sacrifice which has been necessary across the board to<br />
maintain our national economic position.<br />
Workers have accepted the need for that restraint in<br />
accepting real wage cuts. Pensioners have accepted it in<br />
accepting a delay in the indexation of their pensions. The<br />
response of both these groups to the national economic<br />
pressures has been magnificent.<br />
In none of the many discussions I have had around the nation<br />
with those protesting against this tertiary administration<br />
charge in none of them has any credible argument been<br />
put to me as t-o Fwhy tertiary students too should not accept<br />
any part of the burden of restraint.<br />
We took the precaution of ensuring the charge would be<br />
waived or reimbursed for students who are relatively<br />
disadvantaged, such as those receiving Austudy benefits.<br />
I also observe that the proceeds of the charge have been<br />
directed in part towards the creation of new places in<br />
tertiary institutions so that more Australians may receive<br />
the benefits of a tertiary education. </p>
<p>In the final analysis, the charge is only $ 250 a sum which<br />
could be earned over a couple of weekends work. It is in no<br />
way comparable to the $ 8,500 a year which it costs, on<br />
average, to put a student through a university course.<br />
Those who claim, therefore, that the administrative charge<br />
has in some way destroyed the principle of free tertiary<br />
education overlook that the education is free only to the<br />
recipients. It is far from free for the taxpayers who are<br />
paying for it.<br />
So the Government remains committed to retaining this charge<br />
and we have decided to maintain it in real terms for the<br />
1988 academic year.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
While earlier generations of graduates may have enjoyed a<br />
luxury which is denied us today the " ivory-tower" luxury<br />
of a relative isolation from the society which nurtured them<br />
I am pleased by the efforts made here and at other<br />
Australian campuses to ensure the continuing relevance of<br />
your work and to avoid the temptations of isolationism.<br />
My message to you today has largely been directed to our<br />
shared responsibilities. I make no apology for that<br />
though I do want to add my very sincere congratulations to<br />
all of you who are culminating years of endeavour with this<br />
graduation ceremony today.<br />
As you -leave university to enter your new careers, I take<br />
this opportunity to underline the urgency of the task which<br />
faces Australia nothing less than the restructuring of the<br />
national economy. J<br />
It is to you, and to your peers and all your successors on<br />
campuses around Australia, that this nation looks,<br />
particularly, for understanding, commitment and involvement<br />
in fulfilling that supreme task. </p>
