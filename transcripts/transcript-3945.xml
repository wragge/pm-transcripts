. PRIME MINISTER.' Press Statement No. 585<br />
October 1975<br />
. ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS<br />
The Prime Minister announced that the Administrative<br />
Arrangements Order had today been amended to transfer the<br />
administrative responsibility for the procurement, purchase<br />
. and disposal of goods from the Minister and Department of<br />
Administrativ6 Services to the Minister and Department<br />
of Manufacturing Industry.<br />
In the appropriations for the Supply period passed<br />
last May, funds for the salaries of persons employed on<br />
the purchasing and-associated activities were provided for<br />
the Departments of Manufacturing Industry and Special<br />
Minister of State which both had functions relating to<br />
Government purchasing. When the purchasing functions<br />
of those departments were later transferred to the Department<br />
of Services and Property ( now the Department of Administrative<br />
Services) the necessary allocations were provided in the<br />
Appropriation Bill ( No. 1) 1975-76 which is being delayed<br />
by the Opposition in the Senate.<br />
The formal, but temporary, transfer of administration<br />
of the purchasing functions will enable the personnel<br />
concerned to be transferred temporarily to the Department<br />
of Manufacturing Industry and to be paid at least until the<br />
end of the Supply period from the appropriations originally<br />
allocated for them. Only a small numiber of the staff were<br />
earlier transferred from the Department of the Special<br />
Minister of State, and they too are being transferred to the<br />
Department of Manufacturing Industry rather than to their<br />
former department under this temporary arrangement.<br />
The administrative action that has been taken is in<br />
keeping with the statement the Prime Minister made on<br />
24 October that the Government will not act other than<br />
strictly in accordance with law in attempting to preserve<br />
administrative services and maintain wage and salary<br />
payments. The action is a consequence of the steps that<br />
have been taken to ensure that wage and salary payments will<br />
be maintained through the Supply period.<br />
