    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard today visited Larrakeyah Barracks to see first-hand some of the housing investments the Australian Government has funded for Defence personnel in Darwin.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government has invested more than $650 million in new projects and constructed 543 new homes since 2007 with plans for more than a thousand new residences for Australian Defence Personnel in Darwin.</p>
<p>These investments will provide first class housing for ADF members.</p>
<p>They will support the recruitment and retention of our ADF personnel and at the same time help relieve the tight local housing market here in Darwin.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister toured permanent live-in accommodation for single members at Larrakeyah Barracks which will soon be replaced with 230 new apartments onsite, with another 680 to be built at Robertson Barracks.</p>
<p>The tour with the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Warren Snowdon also included a visited to a construction site at Larrakeyah Barracks where 97 new houses are underway in a separate $63.8 million project.</p>
<p>In total, these investments in Defence Housing in Darwin will provide more than 900 jobs for Territorians.</p>
<p>Defence contributes more than $800 million a year to the Gross State Product in the Northern Territory, and stimulates over an additional 4,500 non-Defence jobs in local business.</p>
<p>Business across the Top End benefit significantly from the Government's housing plan in Darwin.</p>
