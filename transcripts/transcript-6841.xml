TRANSCRIPT PRESS CONFERENCE 25 FEBRUARY 1986<br />
Melbourne Cricket Ground<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister the situation in the Philippines<br />
is very much in our affairs right now. what do you think<br />
President Marcos should do?<br />
PM: I believe he should stand-down. All the evidence shows<br />
that the election was fraudulent and the only guarantee that<br />
you can have now, I think, that you're not going to have a<br />
situation of the country being plunged into chaos and bloodshed<br />
is that he should stand-down.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's the Australian Government's greatest<br />
fear? The care of the people there, or a strategic thing?<br />
PM: No the people. I mean it's a country of considerable<br />
natural richness and wealth and I believe that what is<br />
required there, as far as the welfare of the people of<br />
the Philippines is concerned, is a government that's going<br />
to concentrate upon trying to ensure economic and social<br />
development. That hasn't been happening and that is a<br />
major consideration. Of course security situations do<br />
come into it, but it is not, as far as I'm concerned, the<br />
prime consideration. Nor do I believe it's the prime<br />
consideration of the United States administration. I<br />
think the Secretary of State, George Schultz, said very<br />
eloquently recently, democracy comes before bases.<br />
JOURNALIST: And there's one last point. If Mr Marcos<br />
doesn't heed the advice of the Americans, or the Australians,<br />
or other people around the world what can you forsee<br />
happening there?<br />
PM: If he doesn't stand down you can s ee nothing, as I<br />
say, but chaos and bloodshed and I would think that* Marcos<br />
should understand that after 20 years, if I can say it in<br />
this environment, he's had his innings, time to retire.<br />
ends </p>
