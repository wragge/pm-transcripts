TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH CHERIE PRYOR, TOWNSVILLE<br />
ABORIGINAL AND ISLANDER MEDIA ASSOCIATION ( TAIMA)<br />
PRE-RECORDED, 23 NOVEMBER 1989<br />
BROADCAST 27 NOVEMBER 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PRYOR: On the 12th of June 1988 you signed a negotiative<br />
statement. Is your Government still committed to that?<br />
PM: This is in regard to the Treaty?<br />
PRYOR: Yes.<br />
PM: Absolutely. I'd like to say these things about that<br />
Cherie. Firstly, as I've said, a total commitment to the<br />
concept. Some people may wonder why there's been such a<br />
long period since then with nothing concrete emerging.<br />
There's been a lot of informal discussion among the<br />
Aboriginal communities because of the raising of this<br />
issue and we are giving very careful thought to the best<br />
way in which we can ensure that the Aboriginal<br />
communities spread around Australia have the maximum<br />
opportunity of saying exactly what they want. Because I<br />
don't want on behalf of the Government to impose<br />
something. What's got to come out of this is a view from<br />
our friends in the Aboriginal community as to what they<br />
want the Treaty to say. And importantly also we've got<br />
to educate to a proper level of understanding the non-<br />
Aboriginal community. Gerry Hand wants to make sure that<br />
these processes of consultation and education are<br />
undertaken in a most effective manner. The other point I<br />
want to make is that of course Gerry's time has been very<br />
very much taken up since then with having to deal with<br />
the strong continuous opposition by our political<br />
opponents in the Parliament which has occupied just about<br />
the whole of his time. They've opposed very strongly all<br />
our Aboriginal Affairs initiatives in the Parliament, the<br />
enquiries into Aboriginal administration and we've had<br />
enormous difficulties with time and energy in getting the<br />
ATSIC legislation through. That simply has meant that Mr<br />
Hand hasn't had the time that he would've liked to have<br />
had to deal with this. But now that we're getting some<br />
of those things behind us he will be giving it the more<br />
concentrated attention that he hopes for. I hope to see<br />
some real progress on this issue during next year. 06) </p>
<p>PRYOR: Aboriginal people are wary of a Treaty because<br />
any negotiations leading up to a treaty, your Government<br />
or any government, must recognise sovereignty. I'd like<br />
to quote on something that you said at the Barunga<br />
festival last year, that Aboriginal people were the prior<br />
occupiers of this land. Why hasn't your Government<br />
signed say like anything saying that?<br />
PM: Well we have first of all the statement by the Prime<br />
Minister to that effect and the statement by the Prime<br />
Minister is significant. We also had some attempts to<br />
approach this issue in regard to the preamble of the<br />
ATSIC legislation and we're not able'to achieve agreement<br />
on that which was unfortunate. Because what you've got<br />
to remember, when you're moving to a legislative position<br />
in our Parliament it's not just the House of<br />
Representatives which the Government controls but the<br />
Senate which we don't control. There we have consistent<br />
opposition to any progressive idea in regard to<br />
Aboriginal Affairs from the Opposition. So we don't<br />
control that area. But the important thing in our<br />
judgement Cherie is that We've really got to get a level<br />
of understanding in the total Australian community out of<br />
which we will get a Treaty which is meaningful and will<br />
represent a recognition by non-Aboriginal Australians of<br />
the injustices of the past. And reciprocally a<br />
recognition from the Aboriginal and Torres Island<br />
communities that that is a meaningful recognition by non-<br />
Aboriginal Australians. So from that basis that we can<br />
move to what is important and that is to implement the<br />
range of programs in the areas of education, employment,<br />
health and housing which are going to do the things which<br />
need to be done to lift the standards and quality of life<br />
of the Aboriginal community.<br />
PRYOR: What can the Aboriginal people who live in<br />
Queensland expect from the next State election in regard<br />
to deeds of grant in trust in Aborignal reserves?<br />
PM: I can't speak for the State government of<br />
Queensland. All I do know is that the Aboriginal<br />
community in Queensland, as indeed the non-Aboriginal<br />
community, will get infinitely better government from the<br />
incoming Goss Labor Government than they've received in<br />
the years of darkness of conservative rule.<br />
PRYOR: In 1968 the Australian people voted<br />
overwhelmingly in favour of the referendum giving the<br />
Federal Government power over States to legislate laws<br />
regarding Aboriginal people. As Prime Minister can you<br />
give me an example of when the Federal Government has<br />
exercised that power? </p>
<p>PM: Well, yes. The situation of our sacred sites<br />
legislation for instance. In that we have been prepared<br />
to be available where the States haven't exercised their<br />
power adequately. That has in fact been done and the<br />
next point of course is the fact that the Commonwealth<br />
legislation is there acts as a constraint upon States who<br />
may not wish to act in this area in a way that we think<br />
is appropriate.<br />
PRYOR: Last question. The Australian Government is<br />
helping and supporting other third world countries. What<br />
is your Government doing in relation to helping the<br />
indigenous people of this country who are in a similar<br />
situation besides inadequate funding with Aboriginal<br />
housing, health facilities etc?<br />
PM: The answer really comes in a number of parts.<br />
-Firstly Cherie the increase in funding under this<br />
Government has been staggering. There's no area of<br />
Commonwealth expenditure which has increased so much in<br />
real terms as in the area of Aboriginal Affairs. If you<br />
just take the last two years for instance where there has<br />
been in aggregate terms a reduction in Commonwealth<br />
outlays on its total programs, a reduction in real terms,<br />
we have given prominence to Aboriginal Affairs which has<br />
meant that in the last two years in succession there's<br />
been a 16% and an 8% increase in real terms in funding.<br />
In other words we have given a special priority to the<br />
needs of that group of Australia which we recognise as<br />
the most disadvantaged. So that's the first thing a<br />
massive increase in real terms in expenditure. But I<br />
think you appreciate, as well as we do, that it's not<br />
simply sufficient to spend more money. What we've been<br />
trying to do is initiate a range of programs which with<br />
the use of more money and the use of more understanding<br />
is going to mean that you address the real issues. There<br />
is nothing more fundamental in my judgement than the<br />
education and employment opportunities for our Aboriginal<br />
communities. And that's why we have launched a number of<br />
programs to increase the educational opportunities for<br />
Aboriginal Australians and under this Government there<br />
has been a significant increase in the participation rate<br />
by Aboriginals in both the secondary and tertiary<br />
education system. But we haven't been content just to<br />
rest on that achievement and last month John Dawkins<br />
initiated a further education program which is calculated<br />
to increase the opportunities for Aboriginals to get into<br />
and remain in the education system. Because that in the<br />
end is the basis upon which will be determined the<br />
capacity of the Aboriginal people to get fulfillment not<br />
only in employment but in other ways of participation in<br />
the total community. Of course the other thing that<br />
we've done, against a lot of opposition from our<br />
political opponents, is to press through with the ATSIC<br />
legislation. With that legislation for the first time in<br />
the whole history of this country we will have an<br />
arrangement embedded in legislation which is going to </p>
<p>i4. 4<br />
ensure that the Aboriginal people themselves can do two<br />
things. First, have a process of communication, a formal<br />
process of communication and consultation with the<br />
Government of this country as to what their priorities<br />
are in their communities and secondly then through the<br />
ATSIC apparatus to be associated with the implementation<br />
of those programs. Never before has this happened. What<br />
has happened in the past is that successive governments<br />
in Canberra have themselves tended to determine what is<br />
good for the Aboriginal people and impose it. Our view<br />
is that that's not the right way, that we have to<br />
maximise the opportunities for consultation. And then<br />
may I say that just today I have chaired a conference in<br />
the Cabinet room here in Canberra at which there were<br />
representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Island<br />
people and of the major business organisations and of the<br />
trade union movement together with Mick Miller and Fred<br />
Miller who have been there to Fred Hall I mean, who's<br />
been the Chairman of the Aboriginal Action Committee.<br />
The purpose of that meeting was to commit the resources<br />
of the private sector employers and of the trade union<br />
movement to our Aboriginal Employment Action program.<br />
That really has two bases. One is to emphasise again our<br />
commitment to the educational opportunities for<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Islanders. But secondly and most<br />
importantly to have the private sector employers of this<br />
country give a commitment, which they have, to<br />
facilitating the expansion of employment opportunities<br />
for Aboriginal and Torres Islanders in the employment<br />
sector. Now if you take all those things together,<br />
importantly what that means that under this Government is<br />
that we have done more than has ever been done before to<br />
not simply spend more money, which is important, but to<br />
increase the sense of understanding within the community<br />
generally of the national obligation that exists to<br />
improve the condition and quality of life of the<br />
Aboriginal people.<br />
PRYOR: That's all I have.<br />
PM: Thank you very much Cherie.<br />
