PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPE~ ECH BY THE PRIM4E MINISTER<br />
FOR THE OPENING OF CAREERS EXPO<br />
* SYDNEY 3 OCTOBER 1985<br />
May I say at the outset that AISEC is to be<br />
congratulated on initiating, on organising and on<br />
undertaking this Careers Expo ' 85. They have brought<br />
together employers and young people about to enter the<br />
workforce in what is the largest ever pro-recruitment<br />
exhibition in Australia. This Expo is a marvellous<br />
example-of a students organisat ion AISEC helping<br />
other students. AISEC, I commend your efforts.<br />
My Government, in addressing the problems of young<br />
people in this, International Youth Year, has had a<br />
particular interest in establishing long term policies<br />
for Australia's youth. Unfortunately, the concerns and<br />
needs of young people have been ignored for all too long<br />
by previous Governments. But not by this Government.<br />
It is widely recognised that the point at which young<br />
people leave educational and training institutions to<br />
enter the workforce is highly significant. This<br />
transition period is of great importance to young<br />
peoples' individual development.<br />
It is also an occasion of great significance for the<br />
whole workforce as new workers with new skills, vigodr<br />
arnd enthusiasm take their places in the productive<br />
enterprises of our economy.<br />
It is most important that young people be given every<br />
opportunity to learn about the employment possibilities<br />
that exist in the Labour Market. Young people<br />
increasingly need assistance in coming to grips with our<br />
dynamic world, preparing themselves for work in rapidly<br />
changing environments, and in making worthwhile career<br />
choices. </p>
<p>A situation of great concern to my Government has been<br />
the long-term deterioration in full-time employment<br />
opportunities for teenagers.<br />
Between 1966 and 1983, there was a decline of almost a<br />
third in'the number of full-time jobs held by teenagers,<br />
with more experienced, better-trained adult workers<br />
taking an increasing share of available jobs in a<br />
competitive labour market.<br />
The increased availability of part-time work over this<br />
period has not offered any real compensation, since it<br />
has largely been taken up by young people still in<br />
education. Curxrertly, for example, teenage school<br />
students account Tor between 50 and 60 percent of all<br />
part-time jobs held by teenagers.<br />
The'se trends have been exacerbated by the lack of<br />
opportunities for structured vocational training<br />
available for school leavers once they are in the labour<br />
market.<br />
Those young school leavers who are able to obtain jobs<br />
are increasingly finding themselves in what is commonly<br />
known as the " secondary" labour market that is, in<br />
low-paid, unskilled, often casual work, offering few<br />
prospects for skill acquisition or long-term career<br />
advancement.<br />
And yet these raw figures and labour market trends do<br />
not reveal what youth unemployment means in terms of the<br />
loss of human dignity and self respect or what it<br />
means in * terms of the breakup of families and social<br />
alienation of a large number of the best and proudest<br />
generation we have ever produced or what it means in<br />
terms of the defeat of human hope and the defeat of<br />
human spirit. Youth unemployment is the new poverty<br />
within our midst and we are determined to redress this<br />
lamentable situation.<br />
Our policies are resulting in jobs, jobs and more jobs.<br />
Remember that in the year before we came to Government<br />
160,000 jobs disappeared and unemployment increased by<br />
over a quarter of a million. Under Labor, in just 28<br />
months, 430,000 jobs have been created.<br />
I do not believe that there has been a comparably<br />
important socio-economic achievement in Australia for<br />
over three decades and young people are getting jobs<br />
as a result of our policies.<br />
In terms of youth, the Government has been concerned to<br />
tackle their situation in an appropriately comprehensive<br />
manner, and has announced " PRIORITY ONE" as our Strategy </p>
<p>for the Young People of Australia.<br />
Our major priorities in this strategy are to increase<br />
the general availability of jobs and to improve the<br />
skill levels and competitiveness of young people.<br />
We have placed particular emphasis on education and<br />
training as key factors in improving youth's employment<br />
prospects. We are acutely aware of the fact that the rate of<br />
unemployment amongst people who have not completed<br />
secondary school or gained any post-school qualification<br />
is twice 4sJiighas that amongst those who have better<br />
educational ' achievements.<br />
Education and training are the key to broadening the<br />
labour market prospects and earning capacity of<br />
individuals, and ensuring equity in access to employment<br />
opportunities.<br />
Our strategy covers the primary areas of:<br />
education and training,<br />
employment, income support, and<br />
community based support for the<br />
disadvantaged.<br />
Today I want to highlight particularly our traineeship<br />
proposals, given that so many of Australia's leading<br />
employers are participating in this Expo.<br />
The Government is committed to developing an Australian<br />
trainceship system as a major alternative form of<br />
vocational training for young people who, for whatever<br />
reason, do not complete their secondary schooling,<br />
proceed to higher education or go into a technical or.<br />
trade training position.<br />
Unquestionably, traineeships offer a structured program<br />
of work-based training and experience, integrated with<br />
broad-based off-the-job training, mainly provided<br />
through TAE'E.<br />
The minimum duration of traineeships will be 12 months,<br />
with an off-the-job training component equivalent to at<br />
least 13 weeks.<br />
Employers will enter into contractual arrangements which<br />
specify the type of training to be provided, together </p>
<p>with other employment-related aspects of the<br />
traineeship, and appropriate accreditation will be<br />
available for the trainee on completion of the<br />
tra ineeship.<br />
Trainees will be paid a trainee wage by the employer in<br />
relation to time spent on the job. This wage is to be<br />
negotiated between employers and unions on an industry<br />
or award basis through existing industrial processes,<br />
but is to be no ~ lower than $ 90 per week.<br />
Attention has focussed initially on the likely scope for<br />
the development of traineeship arrangements in three<br />
major privatesctor industries the retail, finance<br />
and tour ism/ hos'itality industries.<br />
As you are aware these are growth industries which<br />
currently employ a large number of young people but<br />
offer little in the way of structured training<br />
opportunities.<br />
The objective for this financial year is to generate<br />
10,000 traineeships with plans for a progressive<br />
expansion to an annual target of 75,000 traineeship<br />
opportunities by 1988-89.<br />
The Commonwealth is making a substantial contribution to<br />
the development of the new traineeship system.<br />
We will be looking to develop up to 20% of initial<br />
traineeship positions in our own fields of employment.<br />
We are talking about a substantial Government commitment<br />
to nothing less than a radical transformation of the<br />
existing avenues of transition from school to work.<br />
Such a fundamental transformation will not be achieved,<br />
however, unless employers, unions, Governments, training<br />
bodies and the community work together in a constructive<br />
manner. We must all share the responsibility to<br />
generate training and opportunities for our nation's<br />
young. There is much more that I could say about our strategyfor<br />
young people-about other labour market initiatives,<br />
income support arrangements and other community based<br />
support programs.<br />
But they will all be receiving publicity, and I would<br />
prefer not to take up time here now which can be put to<br />
good use in forging links between those of you who are<br />
in the work force and have information and work to offer<br />
and those of you who still face the daunting task of<br />
finding your way into a useful and satisfying career. </p>
<p>Once again I commend AISEC for their initiative in<br />
organising this Expo and for highlighting the importance<br />
of pre-recruitment and in bringing employers and young<br />
job seekers together.<br />
It is with pleasure, that I now declare Careers Expo<br />
open. 4T </p>
