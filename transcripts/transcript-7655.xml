PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
ADDRESS BY THE FRIXE MSTER or AusTRALiA,<br />
THE RON R J L HAIME AC HgP<br />
AT A rEETNG OF THE ANZAC PARLIAxmNmA~ y GROUP<br />
WESTIIINSTER, * WNDON 22 JUNE 1989<br />
Mr Chairman<br />
Distinguished Members of the Lords and Commons<br />
I am very grateful to the ANZAC Group for this opportunity<br />
to address under its auspices this gathering of members of<br />
the Lords and Commons.<br />
No Australian -certainly no Australian Prime Minister<br />
could stand in this place and fail to be powerfully reminded<br />
of its meaning and significance for Australia.<br />
It was here in 1787 that the Speech from the Throne<br />
announced the intention of the Pitt Administration to form<br />
the First Settlement. It was this Parliament which<br />
authorised the first expenditures on the infant colony of<br />
New South Wales.<br />
The legislation which established all the basic institutions<br />
of parliamentary government and the judiciary in the<br />
Australian colonies were Acts of this Parliament at<br />
Westminster. The Constitution of the Commonwealth of<br />
Australia is itself an Act of this Parliament, passed on 9<br />
July 1900 as " 63 and 64 Victoria Chapter 12"; and stating<br />
in the preamble: " Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's<br />
Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent<br />
of the Lords, Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this<br />
present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the<br />
same". And it was the Statute of Westminster in 1931 which<br />
ultimately put beyond question the sovereign independence of<br />
Australia, as a dominion within the Commonwealth of Nations.<br />

No other nation in the world has had so direct and detailed<br />
a legislative and constitutional connection with the<br />
Parliament at Westminster. Indeed, it was only in 1986 that<br />
the direct links were finally and formally severed, with the<br />
passage by the Commonwealth Parliament of the Australia Bill<br />
which terminated any powers there might still remain in this<br />
Parliament to make laws affecting Australia. Thus, after<br />
200 years the formal connection came to an end.<br />
But, of course, Mr Chairman, that aspect of the connection<br />
was never, even in the colonial days, the most important<br />
part of it. The really important links, the true bonds will<br />
remain as long as both our Parliaments endure. Our<br />
Parliaments are pre-eminent in the world as examples of that<br />
system of parliamentary democracy known as the Westminster<br />
system. And it was here that, over the centuries, all the<br />
great rules and institutions which underpin the system were<br />
shaped. In particular, the principle of ministerial<br />
responsibility and accountability to Parliament. It is this<br />
principle which is the essence of parliamentary democracy<br />
and distinguishes it from all other forms of democracy.<br />
No statute of your Parliament, and no clause in our written<br />
Constitution enforces this principle. Yet it is the<br />
historic heart'and constitutional core of the system.<br />
it is a measure of the strength of parliamentary democracy<br />
and its effectiveness in fulfilling the hopes and needs and<br />
aspirations of the people of our two countries that its most<br />
fundamental feature, its very foundation should rest, in the<br />
final analysis, upon a mere convention.<br />
of course,, what has given that principle its enduring<br />
effectiveness, in practice, is the growth of the party<br />
system within the parliamentary system and, specifically,<br />
the development of an effective two party system.<br />
It may be, in this television age, that the great political<br />
parties in Britain and Australia, and we, the politicians<br />
who have to operate within the system, are increasingly the<br />
target for scorn and derision although one only has to<br />
glance at, say, a concordance of Shakespeare and look up the<br />
word " politician" to see that nothing has changed much over<br />
the last 400 years.<br />
Be that as it may, there is no substitute for the parties in<br />
our system. You cannot have an effective parliamentary<br />
democracy without effective political parties. And whatever<br />
re-alignments may be necessary from time to time and<br />
nothing is constant in the swirl and sweep of politics we<br />
will only have great parliamentary democracies as long as we<br />
continue to have within Parliament, great political parties,<br />
identifiable by their policies, their discipline,<br />
allegiances and associations. </p>
<p>In the development of these fundamentals of the Westminster<br />
system, our two countries have followed remarkably similar<br />
paths. This has not been, in Australia, a process of mere<br />
imitation and replication. From the beginning of,<br />
responsible government in the two major colonies of New<br />
South Wales and Victoria in 1856, the Australians set out to<br />
put their own mark and character on their Parliaments.<br />
Manhood suffrage, votes for women, the single vote, same-day<br />
elections, and the secret ballot were all pioneered in<br />
Australia. Notably, we formed the world's first<br />
parliamentary labor party. In exactly two year's time, we<br />
will celebrate the centenary of the Australian Labor Party,<br />
when at the first election ever contested by organised<br />
political Labor we returned 35 members to the New South<br />
Wales Legislative Assembly in a House of 140.<br />
And, of course, with the coming of Federation, with a<br />
written Constitution, drawing on elements of the American<br />
and Canadian federal systems and in the case of the<br />
referendum provisions, on the Swiss, Australia has obviously<br />
developed its variations on the Westminster model.<br />
Beyond these constitutional and political innovations, we<br />
have undoubtedly developed an Australian style and approach<br />
in the operations of our political institutions.<br />
My distinguished predecessor, Sir Robert Menzies, records in<br />
his memoirs, that Winston Churchill once remarked to him:<br />
" My goodness! You do seem to play your politics with a fine<br />
18th century vigour".<br />
That, of course, was meant as a compliment from one who<br />
regarded the Parliaments of Wilkes and Sheridan,, Burke, Pitt<br />
and Fox, as a golden age.<br />
And it is true that our politics are tough, robust, and<br />
perhaps at times even rough, in the characteristically<br />
forthright Australian manner.<br />
But, much more important is the tenacity with which we<br />
adhere to fundamentals of parliamentary democracy. That is<br />
the source of the continuing strength and energy of<br />
democracy in Australia.<br />
And perhaps the most remnarkable thing of all is that despite<br />
the very considerable changes in the composition of the<br />
Australian population since the war, despite the new<br />
richness and diversity in our society created by communities<br />
of very different backgrounds,, some with different systems<br />
of democracy, some where there is no tradition of democracy<br />
at all, despite these changes, the Australian commitment to<br />
parliamentary democracy remains as strong as ever. </p>
<p>There could not be a more fitting place than this to<br />
reaffirm the commitment to the Australian people to<br />
parliamentary democracy this place from whence it sprang.<br />
Nor could there be a more fitting time these days when<br />
around the world, so much hope and, in one tragic case, so<br />
much despair is associated with the cause of democracy.<br />
From the Elbe to the western shores of the Pacific, we have<br />
witnessed in recent years, months and weeks, stirrings of<br />
the spirit of human f reedom of immense consequence f or the<br />
future of the world.<br />
In so vast a picture, in so momentous a mixture of hope and<br />
tragedy, it is difficult to discern a clear pattern, much<br />
less predict outcomes.<br />
But one thing is clear, one constant star: totalitarianism<br />
has no answer to the unquenchable spirit of human freedom,<br />
save terror.<br />
And in the end, that is no answer. at all.<br />
Hitler's bombs nearly destroyed the fabric of this building.<br />
The fabric of parliamentary democracy survived as strong as<br />
ever. All of Western Europe which lay under the heels of<br />
the dictators has now achieved a unity under democracy<br />
inconceivable at the outbreak of the war fifty years ago.<br />
This twentieth century has witnessed unimaginable horrors of<br />
a~ i~-~ Ãµ LUL~ tin th<br />
totalitarianism can offer, I am convinced that the twentieth<br />
century will end in a wider triumph for democracy than we<br />
could have believed possible even a decade ago. And if my<br />
conviction is borne out, then it will have been due, in no<br />
small measure, to the example and exertions in the cause of<br />
democracy, for so many generations, in the Parliament of<br />
Westminster. Again fellow-parliamentarians, thank you very much for the<br />
interest you are shoving through the ANZAC Group in<br />
I've been very pleased to learn that your Chairman has<br />
accepted the invitation of the Australian Parliament to<br />
visit Australia when he is in our part of the world in July<br />
and August. And we look forward also to the visit of the<br />
Joint Secretaries of the ANZAC Croup, Neil Hamilton and<br />
Robin Corbett as guests of the Australian Parliament shortly<br />
after that. </p>
<p>Again, thank you for the warmth of your welcome today, and<br />
for your contribution to the objective we all share the<br />
strengthening of the bonds, at all levels, between Britain<br />
and Australia. TOTAL PAGE. 001 </p>
