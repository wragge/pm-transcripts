IE&amp; OE<br />
Thank you very much Trish. To Martin Cameroni, the President of the Liberal P~ lty in<br />
South Australia.. to Amanda Vanstorte, R~ obert Hill, Tan M~ cLachlan, my other state and<br />
Federal Parliameniaxy colleagues, ladies and gentleicn. I1h ave reflected on a niimber of<br />
the rcsonances; with a year ago as I travelled here this morning the short distance from the<br />
hotel. It was cxaciy a year ago that I opcncd that campaign office. It was about thc<br />
same time that T think I opened a campaign office for Andrew Sotdcou. I remember to<br />
the day of course as so many of us do, the Satuday of the Australia Day weekend last<br />
year, when the election was called and can I say, Trish that ifs alys a pleasuic'to be int<br />
Adelade about this time of the year and it was very nice of you to gi've me the<br />
opportunity of saying a few words at the opening of your office.<br />
We are on the eve of Australia Day, a day that has grown in the affections and the<br />
commitmnent of Australians to celebrate over the last ten or 20 years. When I was<br />
growing up people sort of struggled to celebrate Australia Day. It was called -Aruivemsary<br />
Day I1th ink then-It certainly was in Sydney, and I guess it was the samne all aroun. d<br />
Australia. And we sort of went through the motions of celebratirng Australia Day but<br />
over the years. and particularly over the last decade, the celebration of it bas become a<br />
focal point of people thinking about and reflecting on those things that bind us together.<br />
One of the credos that I have always tried to live by in political life, both inside my own<br />
party and also within the community is tbat we ought to focus more on the things! that<br />
bind us together rather than or the things that might pish us apart<br />
And onc of the most visible demonstrationis, the most powerfuil pieces of evidence of the<br />
success of Australia will be that tomnorrow, around our country thousands upon thousands </p>

Fax from' Of People will become Austr-alian citizens. They will come from literally the four corners<br />
of the Earth. They will pledge themselves to put the interests of Australia against the<br />
interests of arny other coutrny, not in the sense of r-epudiating the countrics from which<br />
thev have come but in the sense of embracine, an overarching commitment in common<br />
wilh those who are aLready Australian citizens. to the future of our country and to the<br />
' values that we share in common. And it's a very powerfii reminder that that great act<br />
across the counucy, it's a very powerful reminder of what a magnet of tolerance this<br />
country is to people from so many parts of the world. And it cuts through the clatter. it<br />
cuts through the neg-ativism, it cuts through the tendency of somec Australians to see this<br />
country as other than a ' very robust, democratic, open, tolerant and diverse community. I<br />
think it is a source of tremendous pride to all Australian~ s, whether they were born in this<br />
country or whether they have becomec Australians by choice, it is a reminder to all of us<br />
ofjut how high in the esteem of thc rest of the world our country stands in terms of the<br />
values that men arnd women around the world regard as important-<br />
Over the Christmas holiday period I always try and read some books and I read a very<br />
densely, and I don't mean dense in a pcjorative sense but dense in terms of size, history<br />
of what was called the short 20th century, it was called The Age of Extemes and it traces9<br />
the history of the 20th century from the-beainning of the Great War of 1914 to the<br />
collapse of communism in the early 1990s. And it contains right in the mniddlc of it a<br />
reminder that only eight courttries, if you coun sepaineiy Treland and the United<br />
Kingdom only eight countries have been continuoU5ly democratic during that period and<br />
Australia is one of those eight countries, the others bcing of course the United Stes,<br />
New Zealand, Canaa the United Kingdom, Sweden and Switzerland. Now many<br />
countries of c ourse lost their democracy and their freedom not through choice but<br />
because of the invasion of others and that should always be kept in mind. But it is a<br />
reminder to all of us ofjust how successful Australia has really been. And the greatest<br />
measure of somebody's estem in the community is what others think of him or her and<br />
the greatest mark of the esteem of the nation in the eyes of the rest of the world is what<br />
the citizens of other countries think of that nation, and the desire of so may people to<br />
become citizens of this country and the willingness of them to do so is a very powerful<br />
reminder to all of us of what this country has achieved and what it really stauds; for.<br />
Dfish, can T say on a more personal note that 1 have a very strong affinity with the<br />
electorate of Adelaide. I bave experieniced some ins and outs I have got to say in recient<br />
years, I am delighted to say a lot more is than outs. I think your achievemnt in winning<br />
the electorate of Adclaide in the ti place was a remnarkable tribute to your cminpaigning<br />
skils, it realy was. And the service that you have given to this very diverse electorate, it<br />
i3 an cleetorae that of course embraces the heart of the city of Adelaide, it is an<br />
electorate that straddles a very widc group of socio-econonucally speakig, of<br />
AuStralians. It includes amongst its constituents people of very diverse backgrounds, It<br />
has a very important educational base. It has one of ihe most important sporting bases off<br />
course, both surnmer and winter sports, of any city in Australia and you represcnit it<br />
magnificently and your achievement in increasing your majority at the last election and<br />
the work that you&amp; do as a Member of Parliament the contribution you make to the </p>
<p>Fax f om : 25/ 01/ 97 13: 41 Pg: 3<br />
understanding of some of the cveryday problems of l ife is a very, very good examplec to<br />
your colleagues.<br />
Onle of my best recollections of Trish and a demonstration of the sort of person she really<br />
is was the day ofthat quite disgraceful attack on Parliament on the I % h of August and<br />
after the demonstrators had been, shall we say, I say it quite unashamedly, repulsed by<br />
the police who behaved in an absolutely magnificent way, and other security people, in a<br />
very difficult situation. I went around as soon as possible to inspect the diamage and<br />
there was Trish resumning her profesion for the moment of nursig and caring for one of<br />
the police officers who had been assaulted by several of the demnonstrators. And that is<br />
typical of the caring role That she plays out, both as a Member of Parliamnt and as a<br />
member of the community. It was a vivid reminder of the kind of person she is and the<br />
fact that shes never forgotten that she bas a caring role in the commiunity as a citizen and<br />
her trining as a nurse was very much in evidence on that occasion.<br />
This office will be of course open and will be a vehicle of support for all of the citizens<br />
of the electorate of Adelaide. Although in the nature of politics only slightly over haw, or<br />
in some electorates, immn'ensely over half of de community votes for you. once you' re a<br />
Member of Parliament you have an obligation a'nd a commitment to serve the people who<br />
voted against you as well as the people who voted for you. And I know that Trish winl do<br />
that and I imow that anybody, irrespective of their politics, who comes to this office can<br />
be assured of a good hearing, can be assured of a persistent etTort to help them in sol-ving<br />
whatever problem that they might have and I think that it is appropriate that there are so<br />
many community leaders here.<br />
So ladics and gentlemen, as T reflect on the last year I do so as leader of the Liberal Party<br />
with very great pride at what has been acieved, not in any triumphal sense. We were<br />
given the great privilege of being the Goverrnment of Australia. We have wiorked very<br />
hard and I have been very ably assisted as Prime Minister in a very, very powerful<br />
Ministerial and Parliamcniary contingent from South Australia. T think T have said before<br />
that I1 cant recall in the history of Federation, certainly not i the post-war period, where<br />
there have been four Cabinet Ministers in the Government of this coLmtry from South<br />
Australia, which is the case at the present time and they amo ably surrounded by a very<br />
powerful contingent of very hard-working Senators and Members, and I am delighted to<br />
say at the opening of this office how much T appreciate the contribution of South<br />
Australians to my Government and to the Parliament generally. It has been a very<br />
exciting year since I was last here. It's almost a year since the change of Government<br />
We have achieved a lot but we have many challenges ahead of us and the new year has<br />
brought a number of reminders of continuing challenges. The new year has also brought<br />
somc: new challIenges which willI engage the energics and the goodwilJI and th e<br />
commitmnent and the application of anl of us. </p>
<p>Fax from But ladies and gentlemen, I am here today to, with great pleasure, to declare Trish's new<br />
electorate office open, to wish her well, to thank her for the care that she gives to the<br />
people of Adelaide, to thank her for being such a magnificent member of our<br />
Parliamentary team and to wish her many, many years of service to the cause of the<br />
people of Adelaide and to the Australian community generally.<br />
Thank you.<br />
