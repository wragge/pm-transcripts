PRIME MINISTER 60/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
APPOINTMENT OF PROFESSOR GLENN WITHERS AS DIRECTOR OF THE<br />
OFFICE OF THE ECONOMIC PLANNING ADVISORY COUNCIL<br />
I am pleased to announce the appointment of Professor<br />
Glenn Withers AO as Director of the Office of the<br />
Economic Planning Advisory Council.<br />
Professor Withers has made significant contributions to<br />
the development and analysis of public policy in a number<br />
of areas. He has been Professor of Economics at La Trobe<br />
University since 1986 and has held a number of positions<br />
on Government and academic boards. He has been a<br />
consultant to both private and public organisations,<br />
including the OECD. He brings strong research abilities<br />
and valuable experience to the Office of EPAC. Professor<br />
Withers has published extensively, concentrating mainly<br />
on issues affecting the structure and efficiency of the<br />
Australian economy, and the economic implications of<br />
social policies. In the 1992 Queen's Birthday Honours<br />
List he was appointed as Officer of the Order of<br />
Australia for his services to applied economics.<br />
At the last EPAC meeting on 27 March 1992, 1 emphasised<br />
the need for the Secretariat and the Council to<br />
concentrate its research and analysis on medium term<br />
issues. Professor Withers' appointment as Director of<br />
the Office of EPAC will contribute importantly to<br />
strengthening this focus of EPAC's work.<br />
I would like to thank and commend Richard Whitelaw for<br />
his capable administration of the Office of EPAC since<br />
the departure of Fred Argy last year. The Office is well<br />
positioned to complete EPAC's 1992 work program under its<br />
new Director.<br />
Professor Withers will take up his appointment on 8 July<br />
1992. I am confident that under his leadership the<br />
Office of EPAC will continue to make important and<br />
constructive contributions to the economic debate in<br />
Australia, and strengthen our understanding of many of<br />
the important issues we need to address to meet the<br />
challenges that face us in the 1990s.<br />
