TRANSCRIPT OF -PRESS CONFERENCE, INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL, LONDON,<br />
21 APRIL 1986<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, I 1 t b'epfp S.<br />
tAe. be available for your questioning.<br />
My program today has been first of all to a meeting<br />
with the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Neil Kinnock, which<br />
was essentially a private discussion covering a number of<br />
matters of mutual interest.<br />
fo0/ ov10WA9 that, I met with Sonny Ramphal, Secretary-<br />
General of the. Commonwealth and, again, discussed a number<br />
of matters there, Aparticularly at length the Eminent Persons<br />
Group initiative in regard to South Africa.<br />
I had the pleasure of meeting the Queen and Prince<br />
Philip late this morning at Windsor Castle and then, this<br />
afternoon, I have had the opportunity of having a meeting<br />
i<br />
with Mrs. Thatcher. There were just the two of us first<br />
of all, discussing a number of matters, and then after that<br />
a meeting at which she had with her Minister Channon,<br />
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry; Mr. Jopling,<br />
Minister for Agriculture; and Lady Young. And those discussions<br />
were predominantly concerned with questions relating to trade<br />
; n agricultural commodities generally and in regard to<br />
the European Community in particular.<br />
I am open to your questions. ' Ztz". 8^ </p>
<p>-2-<br />
QUESTION Prime Minister, the European Community Foreign<br />
Ministers today to take further restrictions against<br />
Libya, namely Con their movements and reduce the size of<br />
their bureaux. We have already taken action, but would<br />
you anticipate taking any further action against the.<br />
Libyan Peoples Bureau in Canberra?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Well, I will be having discussions with the Security<br />
Committee and with cabinet on a range of issues in this<br />
area and it would not be appropriate for me to<br />
preempt what decisions are likely to come out of those<br />
meetings. But obviously you will recall that in January<br />
Australia responded quite specifically to the suggestions<br />
that various nations ought to consider the position of Libya.<br />
We then cut down on the extent of representation in Australia.<br />
We also undertook that Australian firms would not fill the gap<br />
left by Americans withdrawing from the oil industry in Libya<br />
and we will certainly be looking at this matter again, but<br />
I repeat, I would wait for any specific decisions until I<br />
return. QUESTION Prime Minister, the Non-Aligned Countries~ today<br />
apparently in the United Nations agreed to back Libya.<br />
What does this mean for our initiative in the Security Council? </p>
<p>P. 4<br />
-3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER Well, When you say the non-aligned nations decided<br />
to back Libya, I have not had conveyed to me the text of<br />
the resolution. I find it difficult to believe that all<br />
the non-aligned nations would be saying: " We back Libya I<br />
I will wait to hear from our representatives at the<br />
United Nations what the representatives of the non-aligned<br />
nations are saying and what that means, if anything, for the.<br />
Contribution that wervmde at the United Nations. We made<br />
certain suggestions there as to what we thought, looking to<br />
the future, ought to take place. I find it difficult to<br />
believe that people would not be able to see the merit of<br />
approaches along those general lines.<br />
QUESTION Prime Minister, was the Libyan issue discussed beJCC<br />
4~. Ije3IVf .( sV~ oA Mrs. Thatcher?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
, Yes, it was raised. It did not take up a lot of our<br />
time.<br />
QUESTION Did she ask you to take any action against Libyans in<br />
Australia? PRIME MINISTER No, she did not.<br />
.' 8-e4-22 00: 32 </p>
<p>QUESTION Did you discuss South Africa arnd if so, what was<br />
Mrs. Thatcher's general stance?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Yes, we did have quite a deal of discussion about<br />
South Africa. And I want to, as you will appreciate, tread<br />
the line between not going into matters which are properly<br />
c onfidential and yet share with you the thrust of the<br />
position. I was very pleased to see that Mrs. Thatcher<br />
quite clearly believes that the initiative of the Eminent<br />
Persons Group is intrinsically important. She believes,<br />
with me, that it is really the last hope that there is for<br />
a process of dialogue possibly to emerge, rather than the<br />
awful alternative of bloodshed and violence. And from that<br />
bas. is, therefore, * We licive a shared hope that the initiative<br />
which we both believe has been carried through with eminent<br />
skill by the participants in the Eminent Persons Group will<br />
have the opportunity of coming to fruition, We both<br />
rea'lise that it is in the nature of the case a very<br />
difficult exercise fraught with enormous problems<br />
and dangers. We agree that it will require positive<br />
responses from both the South African regime and from the<br />
various representatives of the non-white groups.<br />
I am not trying to convey to you, by thoge observations,<br />
that Mrs. Thatcher and I are at one in every aspect of our<br />
interpretation about how this is going and the next steps.<br />
I must say that I appreciate the very. considerable importance </p>
<p>.# 96-04-22 00: 33P. 6<br />
which Mrs. Thatcher attaches to the initiative.!<br />
IL a j e i.<br />
I I L iA LC It~ I'~/ i<br />
QUESTION Does she support the release of Nelson Mandela as a<br />
prerequisite of some further political initiative?<br />
PRIME MINISTER into<br />
I did notin unequivocal terms.. go/ that point, but<br />
I believe that she understands the significance of Nelson<br />
Mandela in the development of the processes of dialogue to<br />
which I refer, but I do not want to put words into her<br />
mouth in answer to that specific question.<br />
QUESTION What is your view L<br />
what chances did Mrs. Thatcher give.....<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Well I am a punting man, but I do not want to sort of<br />
put tne odds on the board, but it is a very important<br />
question. Let me take just a little while to give you<br />
the perspective which I have of it.<br />
Firstly, I believe that the initiative of the Eminent<br />
Persons Group has now achieved a significance beyond what.<br />
was imagined at the time that we put it in the Bahamas at<br />
the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting. One can<br />
prove that in a number of ways, but most particularly<br />
I believe by the fact that the-initiaPl., opposition from the </p>
<p>.166-04-22 00: 33P. -6-<br />
ANC and others, perhaps an understandable Opposition. has<br />
dissipated. Indeed, they have cooperated fully in the<br />
processes of the work of the Eminent Persons Group. I<br />
think there is a fairly general understanding now that<br />
this initiative does offer the best hope of success or<br />
as it has been put, is now the only game in town.<br />
May I also background that by saying that in the<br />
discussions I had with President Reagan and Secretary of<br />
State Shdltz they indicated their unequivocal support for<br />
the initiative and are attempting, in their way, to give<br />
it their support by their communications with the South<br />
African Government.<br />
Now, the Group is representative; it is composed<br />
of people with a wide range of experience and obviously<br />
considerable skill, because their work has been commenited<br />
on favourably by, if you like, both sides to the issue in<br />
South Africa, but also by others like, for instance, the<br />
United States Administration.<br />
They have put a series of proposals to the<br />
South African Government which, in essence, set out what<br />
is seen as the necessary framework and initial steps for<br />
processing further dialogue towards a peaceful resolution<br />
of the issues which will need to be dealt with if you are<br />
going to see the emergence of a new South Africa based<br />
upon universal suffrage and the elimination of racial<br />
discrimination. </p>
<p>P. 8<br />
6&amp; 04 22 00: 34 -7-<br />
What stage has been reached, therefore, -now is that<br />
the Eminent Persons Group is awaiting a response from the<br />
South African Government.<br />
If I can go directly into that part of your question<br />
which sort of asked for a calling of the odds, my view is<br />
that given all the factors that I have referred to thus far<br />
which go to the success of the operation of the Group's<br />
workings, I would expect that there should be a favourable<br />
response from the South African Government. I find it<br />
difficult to believe, in all those circumstances, that you<br />
are going to get a flat repudiation of the work of the<br />
Eminent Persons Group. Therefore, the essential question<br />
will be in assessing the response: will the response of<br />
the South African Government have gone far enough to give<br />
confidence to all those of us who have been involved with<br />
this initiative and have responsibilities in it to feel<br />
that we have the basis for further work?<br />
I do not feel confident to call the odds on that, but<br />
I would say this: that I think the odds have improved<br />
significantly since the initiative was put forward by me<br />
in the Bahamas in the latter part of last year.<br />
QUESTION Did you find that Mrs. Thatcher shared this view<br />
about the odds improving significantly? </p>
<p>' 86G-04-22 00: 34P.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Well, you will appreciate that Mrs. Thatcher and I<br />
would not talk in such uncouth terms as odds, but I would:<br />
hope that what I have said to this point would indicate<br />
that I think she is more optimistic about the process<br />
now than perhaps she was before.<br />
QUESTION Prime Minister, is there any response to the initiative<br />
from the ANC as yet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER The ANC, in the first place, expressed their<br />
opposition to the initiative. They thought it was just a<br />
subterfuge almost to put off serious processes of resolutioa.<br />
but no, they have cooperated with the Eminent Persons Group<br />
and have obviously indicated that they hope that the<br />
initiative will work.<br />
QUE ST ION<br />
i L C I. 116~ 7(<br />
PRIME MINISTER Well, it is a plus but it is not sufficient in itself. P. 9 </p>
<p>'-86-04-22 00: 35 .0<br />
-9-<br />
QUESTION But the did the part of the proposal that had been<br />
put forward<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
That is part or the approach by the Eminent Persons<br />
Group, but I mean, it is not fair that I should go into the<br />
details of what they have put. I repeat that no-one is<br />
going to believe that the response in that area is sufficient.<br />
QUESTION In relation to the rebel New Zealand tour of South<br />
Africa, you said in Washington that Australia would not be<br />
playing against rugby players involved in that tour.<br />
Does this mean that the Government will seek to prevent<br />
this year's Wallaby tour of New Zealand taking place<br />
if any of the 30 rebels are included in the team, and does<br />
it mean that we will seek to prevent New Zealanders from<br />
coming to Australia for the World Cup next year if any of<br />
the' 30 rebels are included in the All Black team?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I would want to discuss this issue with my Cabinet<br />
colleagues at the appropriate time back in Australia, but<br />
on my understanding and recollection of the specific terms<br />
of the Gleneagles Agreement, it would not be appropriate<br />
for Auctra1iai to be playing againat a aide, in Australia<br />
certainly, which included people who had participated </p>
<p>. P8060-30--22 P.-<br />
in that tour, but we will have to consider that in detail,<br />
but that is my understanding of the letter and spirit of<br />
Gleneagles.<br />
QUESTION Prime Minister, did you discuss with Mrs. Thatcher<br />
her visit to I'srael next month?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
No, I did not.<br />
QUESTION Would you contemplate a similar visit yourself?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
The a'nswer to the first part of your question is no, I<br />
did not discuss it. of course, I contemplate a visit to<br />
the Middle East at some point. My interest in the<br />
area is well known, but the timing of such a visit would<br />
. be a matter for determination by me at the appropriate time.<br />
QUESTION This year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I have not addressed my mind as specifically as that<br />
to it.. it is a possibility but it is not something that any<br />
decision has been made about. I </p>
<p>.86-04-22 00: 36P. 12<br />
QUESTION Does that mean you would visit countries other than<br />
Israel?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
If I went to visit Israel, of course I would visit<br />
countries in tile Middle East other than-Israel.<br />
QUESTION Prime Minister, did you discuss the Common<br />
Agricultural Policy with Mrs. Thatcher?<br />
PRIME MINISTER Yes I did. That discussion took place more<br />
specifically when the others were present, other Ministers.<br />
Let me put it this way: as we expected, there is very<br />
considerable common ground between my Government, Mrs.<br />
Thatcher and her Government. The British<br />
Government realises that the Common Agricultural Policy<br />
does not involve a rational allocation of resources. It<br />
must understand thait in 1-hp laqt year it involved comothing<br />
like $ 70 billion in terms of taxpayers, funds and a<br />
transfer of income from consumers to farmers. That is an<br />
enormous amount of, money and that is appreciated by Mrs.<br />
Thatcher and her Government and let me make it clear that<br />
having the same basis of understanding of the inappropriateness<br />
of that policy and the misallocation, of resources that it </p>
<p>' 86-M4-22 01: 42P. -12-<br />
involves,* Mrs. Thatcher did not want to leave me or<br />
my colleagues with the impression that we were going to<br />
have an easy job. that is we the British, ourselves<br />
and others who wanted to change that were going to have an<br />
easy job in changing it, but she has the view, which I share,<br />
that we must be persistent about this and I say that<br />
particularly to the Australian contingen t here. I do not<br />
believe that we can expect, just by going to Brussels<br />
tomorrow, that we are going to effect immediate changes.<br />
It is a job for persistent and consistent advocacy and I am<br />
pleased, as a result of the discussion I have had today with<br />
Mrs. Thatcher and her Ministerial colkagues, that essentially<br />
we can, from Australia, anticipate a basic support<br />
from the British Government in the positions that we put. </p>
<p>' 636-04-22 01: 43 P. 3<br />
J OU RN A ST: what about thec inclusion of aigriculture in the<br />
forthcoming rouund of [ IThs and did y'ou get daY assUraicLUS<br />
about raising it at the Tokyo Summit?<br />
ipM: In rogard to both those questions. le t mne take Ithemn in<br />
chronologjian, order. The SuriniL T indicated t~ o Mrs Thatcher that out<br />
Ofiy discussions with President Reaqa, we were hoping that<br />
there would a move there to have the question of iiitti'tational<br />
trade in agricultural products discussed at ' Tokyo, and Mrs<br />
Thatcher indicated that she would bo supportLive of tLtat posit-ion.<br />
Secondly, in regurd La the MTN, unequivocaily, the view of<br />
Mrs Thatcher and her government is that agriculLure should be ini<br />
next MTN round and jL should have a prominent place.<br />
JOURNA1,1ST: is your, cast) based on the dumping of European food<br />
surplus~ es on world markets or a lack of access to EC<br />
marke ts?<br />
PM: No it, is more complex than that. Let me quickly run through it.<br />
You say about the loss of access to Eur-opouan markets. We originally,<br />
of course, had substantiAal markets in Europe and as Europe moved<br />
towards seif-sufriency in the production of agricultural. products.<br />
by definition, we lost markets. And rOhat, to somte extent., was<br />
understandable. We didn't like' it. Our coIicoVI1 doveloped<br />
very signiticaent) y though when the CAP developed in a way which<br />
inkant that the niassive subsidies LO fZrMEL'S inl EuropeC IrOVided the<br />
incentive together with the increased productivi ty that is associated<br />
wit~ h their efforts, to the selling of largo quantities of subsidised<br />
agricultural products in third markets. Arid that of course has cost<br />
us dearly. The estimate by our Bureau of Agricultural<br />
Economics is that in e-ach 0o: the last five years t. hese policies<br />
have cost us one billion dollars per annum which an enormous price<br />
for Australian farmers anid Aust. ral ia generally to pay. But our<br />
concern gocs even beyond thaL. we % peak not onl~ y from the<br />
natural enough basis of our own self-interest, and the loss to out'<br />
economy and our farmers, but we also take the view that the<br />
CAP involves, as I say, a massive misallocation of resources<br />
within Europe because of this $ 70 billion per annumn subsidy via<br />
taxpayer, via consuimer to farmer. thal-meanis that you haven't qot<br />
the optimum allocation of resourccs. Arid the best estimai. es Lhat<br />
we can make is that there are Probably a million less people employed<br />
in Europe as a result of that misajs. ocatLionl of resources than<br />
otherwise would be the case. So really, thorefore. if you like,<br />
the Australian position is one iti which wei bring together to the<br />
argument and the analysis a combination of our own admitted selfinterest,<br />
that is the self -interest. of a country which has the world's<br />
most eicetagricultural producers, we don't subsidise<br />
our exporters. We are being huirt.. But we bring that. self-interest<br />
together witLh a view that te interests of Europe iftself are being<br />
hurt Lhe CAP.<br />
JOURNALISTr: What specific demands will you makingy of the<br />
Communi ty?<br />
PM: + We don't mnake demands. We are riot in a position where we<br />
can go to Brussels nor would 1, that is riot my tactic Lo qo<br />
and demand what I will be doing on behalf of, riot merely<br />
AtxatraLilo. but I think of a much wider oonotituonov. I % jIi ] bo tryVing<br />
to say the Europeans firstly, while you hav + e got thils policy, please </p>
<p>' 8~ rz-04-22 01: 42<br />
PM cont: Lake into greater account the interests of efficient,<br />
non-subsidising producers like Australia. Secondly, we will be asking<br />
of them that they should be analysing the growing burden of<br />
CAP upon Europe itself. And that they should be analysing<br />
and moving towards the reduction of that burden internally.<br />
Thirdly, I will be asking that they should be supporting the bringing<br />
forward of international trade in agricultural products into the<br />
MTN round. And finalLy, we would be asking that as hopefully they<br />
move to diminish and get rid of their surplus stockpiles, that that<br />
should be done in the most orderly fashion to diminish the impact<br />
upon others like ourselves. Those are the range of things that I<br />
will be talking about, not making demands.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hlawke, how did the meeting with the Queen go. Did<br />
we give her a present the Australian Government?<br />
PM: I gave her personially a pr-esent which I am pleased to say<br />
appeared to give her great enjoyment. And I don't know about the<br />
protocol of these things, I hope she will excuse nio<br />
if I say'what it is. It is a map of Australia made up of<br />
brass pieces, the pieces are in the forms of Australian flora and<br />
faunia, so it it puzzle. That is not altogether inappropriate<br />
when you are talking about Australia, but I was pleased to see<br />
the joy that she got from it and I hope that it gives her and her<br />
family a great deal of pleasure.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, back on the South African issue. Do<br />
you expect that South Africa will actually accept all the points<br />
put to it by the group?<br />
PM: That really goes to a part of the answer I gave that I would<br />
hope, because I believe that the points that have been put by the<br />
group are all reasonable. I wuld hope that they could accept all<br />
the points. Anid that is how, as I said, the essential question is<br />
going to be an assessment of the degree to which the response of<br />
the South African Government is responsive enough and positive<br />
enocugh to enable the Commonwealth to say, well that is enough to<br />
keel) going. And not only the Commonwealth, but the<br />
representatives of the non-white will all need to be satisfied there<br />
is sufficient response to keep going. So the initiative would not<br />
die if every single elemen~ t was not accepted but there would need<br />
to be. I believe, very substantial acceptance.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does the proposal provide a time frame for change in<br />
South Africa?<br />
PM:' There are not rigid time frames in it, no.<br />
JOURNALIST: Dlo you and Mrs Thatchcu perhiaps hold different views<br />
on what sort response the South African government would go far<br />
enough? PM: I think I am niot being unfair to Mrs Thatcher to'say on the<br />
basis of the public record of Lhe discussions, that my idea of the<br />
progress would require somewhat more than Mrs ihatcher's. B~ ut,<br />
I don't want to try and quantify that. And to be fair to Mrs<br />
Thatcher, arid I'don't leave any impression that she doesn't<br />
believe that change doesn't have to be made.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could that create some difficulties, do you think.<br />
when you all, meet to discuss tho maLter? </p>
<p>PM: Of course, when you have a number of people meeting and<br />
they have different emphases it is harder than if you all Lhink<br />
exactly the same way. That is obvious.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you already considering the extension of the mandate<br />
of the group?<br />
PM: NO, I am not considering that. And I don't think we should<br />
approach it in terms of thinking about some on-going mandate<br />
because that, if you had that perception and expressed it<br />
at this point, that of itself, could constitute a slowing down, a<br />
decelerating factor, where all the evidence, all the realities are<br />
that I think we are running out of time.<br />
PM JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, did you discuss at all any progress<br />
on Maralinga in your consultations?<br />
PM: No, I didn't. It was not because I didn't have it as a<br />
potential item on the agenda but really the talks that took place<br />
here in January with Senator Evans, my Minister'for Resources<br />
and Energy represented the Australian Government, went so well<br />
that we didn't have any problems on our plate. There was<br />
positive cooperation from the British Government. They were<br />
appreciative of the way we were approaching it and the<br />
technical advisory group has met and there is a proposal for an<br />
interim report by May of this year. So, in other words, I<br />
wasn't faced with some problem situation that needed discussion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, have you got any feedback from the<br />
other countries that are represented on the EPG in terms of<br />
how they view the initiative?<br />
PM: Only indirectly. I have had discussions, as you know, with<br />
Malcolm Fraser including a telephone discussion with him in Washington<br />
and the view seems to be that the members of the group all believe<br />
that the progress in their work has been satisfactory. That seem<br />
to reflect the views of their government and most significantly,<br />
in response to your question, in the discussion I had<br />
with Sonny Ramphal today, he was, I think effusive is not too strong a<br />
word about the success of the actual operations of the group to<br />
this point. Let me make it clear, he is not saying that it is<br />
going to work, but as far as the actual operation of the<br />
group, the'way it has gone about its task. ho could not, I<br />
think be more effusive in his praise. And that I think, reflects<br />
the sorts of discussions, also, that he has had with governments<br />
as well.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you said there was no rigid time frame.<br />
Can you give us a bit more on that?<br />
PM: No, it is not appropriate to go to the details of the proposals.<br />
They have been sent to the government of South Africa.<br />
1 don't want to say or do anything now which is going to<br />
perhaps make more difficult positive progress there. But<br />
the point I do want to emphasise when you talk about timetables<br />
is this, that I think it is more and<br />
more the common view, certainly I say from my discussions with the<br />
US Administration, it is their view and the view of others that<br />
the sort of timetable that people had before them and I am<br />
not talking about the timetable of the Eminent Persons Group, but<br />
.' 86-04-22 00: 39P. 16 </p>
<p>' 86-04-22 00: 39P. 1 7<br />
PM con the sort; of Lime framtes that people had in their minds<br />
about what was availabl~ e within which you could bc thinking of a<br />
resolution of South Africa has changed. I think there is, more<br />
and more, an understan~ ding now that that time frame is short. ThO'<br />
people, i~ he non-white population of South AFrica and their<br />
supporters in the front line -states have not got unlimiLed<br />
patience. Nor should thoy have. Arid the sorts of things that have<br />
been happening in South Africa, the killings, the violence, are such<br />
that we all have to understand, .1 believe, that there is a limited<br />
amount of time. And I think less time now as we talk about IL in<br />
April of 1986 than we may even have thught 6 nionLhs ago.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minist. er. did the Americans give any indication<br />
that they were willing to change their stance<br />
P'M: We didn't neced to qo, didn't in the sort of discussion<br />
I was having, to be as specific as that. But let me say this, the<br />
Americans were quite unequivocail in the support they gave to the<br />
Eminent Persons Group intiatives. They believe it was the<br />
riyht approach. TPhey had made contact with the South AFrican<br />
governmeit, to indicate the support of the United States Administration<br />
for this approT-ach. Anid so I think that the fact that they see Lhat<br />
this is really, in association with some of the thing., they are<br />
doing themselves, the last sort of opportuni ty we have<br />
got for dialogue, that carries in a sense its own imp. lications.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hlawke, you go to Brussels tomorrow, and then you<br />
go on 1, o Rome. When in Rome will you take the opportunity to have<br />
talks with the Australian Ambassador on certain fratlers surrounding<br />
the bohaviour of Mr Dawkins?<br />
PM: NO. I don't intend to do that. I am going to Rome on the<br />
assignment that 1 set out for from Australia.<br />
And that es'enti~ j1l)' haz throo p. 2rtc. Fir~ itly, to tall, about<br />
agricultural ma:-tters because Italy is an important. member of the<br />
European Community. Secondly, to sign the reciprocal social<br />
security agreement. And thirdly, to talk about matters of bi lateral<br />
interest beLween us. And tLhose matters are all of very considorable<br />
importance. And that is what I will be using my time in Rome to<br />
do-at with.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr H-awke, sharp distinction between the response<br />
of the Austral ian Labor Party and the British Labour Party to<br />
the American bombing of Tripoli. When this was discussed this<br />
morning with Mr Kinnock, did you just agree to disagree or did you<br />
seek to* persuade each other..<br />
PM: No, it was a very civilised and friendly, fraternal<br />
di scuss ion. And there were don't talk about. points of disagreement<br />
there were different emphases but there were many things on which<br />
we agreed.<br />
JOURNALIST: D~ id youi discuss the nuclear testing and the test ban<br />
treaty with Mrs Thatcher?<br />
PM: We talked, in that, area we talked about these things. We talked<br />
about the nuclear testing, specifically, in the context of<br />
the South Pacific Nuclear Froe Zone Treaty. And I urged upon Mrs<br />
Thatcher that the British Government should give very<br />
favourable consideration to the approaches -that had been mnade to<br />
it on behalf of the countries of thie South Pa8cific Forum for the<br />
accession of the British Government to the three protocols </p>
<p>' 86-04-22 00: 40 P. 18<br />
PM cont: attached to the treaty. I discussed that at some length.<br />
The other context within which the question of nuclear matters arose,<br />
was we talked about the East-West arms talks. I put to Mrs<br />
Thatcher that while I believed that in the Gorbachev<br />
proposals of earlier this year there certain elements of propaganda,<br />
nevertheless were some points of substance within them that were<br />
worth pursuing. That we had said this to the President of<br />
the United States and I expressed my satisfaction that the<br />
President of the United States had himself said both publicly<br />
and privately the same thing. And they had an intention to<br />
pursue these discussions, that they did this with the full support of<br />
Australia. And that essentially was Mrs Thatcher's position.<br />
So they were the two contexts within which I spoke.<br />
JOURNALIST: In the discussions with Mrs Thatcher on Libya, did you<br />
have any to put viewpoints either approving or disapproving<br />
on Britain's part in the American<br />
I haven't been around on the international stage for a great<br />
period of Lime, but I have been around long enough to<br />
know that I wouldn't approve of someone coming in to my country<br />
and telling me what they thought of my policies. And I don't<br />
expect that Mrs Thatcher would regard it as appropriate for me<br />
to be coming and telling her what I thought of hers.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, orn trade. Despite the assurances you have<br />
. from Mrs Thatcher on the inclusion of agriculture as key element<br />
. in the MTNs, is the fact that the European Commission, the fact<br />
that it has refused to have the CAP exposed in any way to the<br />
pLiuc tses of negociacion in tne MTINs in any way<br />
diminish the value of those negotiations or their outcome?<br />
PM: You will remember the phrase that was used by the Community<br />
last year when they were discussing this matter. It depends<br />
which sort of paicyLaOp1 uf Llit phrase you looked at to wnetner it<br />
was appropriate under that decision by the Community<br />
for the CAP in agricultural matters to be included in the<br />
discussion. Of course, I tLak the view that lthe. r: ic.<br />
sufficihnt in the actual words they use for it to be quite consistent<br />
on the part of the Community for agriculture to be not only<br />
the agenda but to prominent on the agenda in the MTN. The important<br />
thing is that is certainly the position that we adopt, the position<br />
which Britain says it adopts and certainly the position of the United<br />
States. JOURNAI. TST: Mr Hawke, what was Mrs Thatcher's reply on the<br />
protocols? PM: She didn't give me a reply. 1 think it would be fair to say<br />
that she is not a great fan of nuclear free zone treaties. But 1<br />
was able to point out to her and did the total consistency<br />
of the treaty with our alliance relationship under ANZUS<br />
with the United States. That didn't inhibit our rights and<br />
obligations under that treaty. And so 1 am hopeful that she<br />
will give perhaps a more positive consideration to these<br />
matters than she may otherwise have done. But she didn't give me<br />
any final answer. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr liawke, there is some concqrn in Lhis counLry<br />
amongst politicians and Journalists about the degree of<br />
foreign ownership ' of the media, particularly Australian<br />
ownership, of the media hce. I was wondering if I could have your<br />
comnents on that?<br />
PM: I have been here talking a moment ago about the need for<br />
international free trade. Now how can I possibly,<br />
having come all the way around the world to argue the case of<br />
freedom iii internaLional trade, say that I am against freedom of<br />
commurce in the media. It seems to me perfectly reasonable.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you going to apply that policy?<br />
PM: Do apply it now. I mean, if we have people<br />
overseas with interests in all sor-Ls of areas of Australian activity<br />
JOUHNALIST: Would you allow them to have a majority interest in<br />
a television station?<br />
PM: I don't know about that. We have a tribunal which is<br />
there to look at these things, the Australian Broadcasting<br />
Tribunal, and I would be very much guided by the wisdom that<br />
resides in that august body.<br />
JOURNALIST: But aren't they, in fact, guided by legislation which<br />
sets our ownership requirements?<br />
PM: Yes, but it they were to say to us that they thought we should<br />
be taking a particular view about this, and having another<br />
look at it, I would do so. But here, again, I don't want. to<br />
get into the questions of who should be owning what in Britain as<br />
far as the media is concerned. Or, T suppose, even more<br />
importantly, how they should be exercising that ownership.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you worried at all by the British perception of<br />
Australian media ownership, perhaps affected<br />
PM: I am not quite sure about what this Australian<br />
media ownership is. Ruport Murdoch is not azi Australian citizen.<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes, but. he is an Australian.<br />
PM: He is not an Australian citizen.<br />
JOURNALIST: But people see him as an Australian. He is known as<br />
the " dirty digger" in this country.<br />
PM: They should be thinking about him as the gorgeous 1l. He<br />
has renounced his Australian citizenship.<br />
JOURNAIST: But you don't think that this has an anti-Australian<br />
affect amongst British people.<br />
PM: I wouldn't have thought so any more than we don't visit the<br />
sins or heap the glories of particular individuals upon their<br />
country and say well look . just because he has done the right thing<br />
their country is marvellous. AFLerall.,. you can think of the dangers<br />
7 </p>
<p>IY PM cant: that that would get you into if voiu thinU ^ r the ) oglc<br />
of that. Just because a person came frouia particular country and<br />
you said the country is to be judged by that individual. Just<br />
imagine where that would get you. I don't want to expand<br />
on that but you have obviously got a febrile imagination. Just<br />
think about where that could get you.<br />
