RECEIPM DUTlY: OPPOSITON CHALLENGE<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
Mr Whitlam seems to be under two false impressions. One<br />
is that it is he and not the Government which decides what are election<br />
issues. The other is that he is thwarting the Commonwealth<br />
Government when in fact he is thwarting the States.<br />
He is apparently threatening that the Labor Party in the<br />
States House, the Senate, will deny the States access to a field of<br />
growth tax to which they want access, and trying to claim that this<br />
affects the Commonwealth Government.<br />
In fact, in this matter, the Commonwealth Govera~ ment is<br />
only acting at the request of the States, as the agent for the States,<br />
to enable them to collect revenue in the future which they would not<br />
otherwise be able to collect. This revenue would be in addition<br />
to any agreed amounts made available from Commonwealth Reven ue<br />
as a result of the new arrangements being worked out between us and<br />
the States. Labor will therefore deny the States the capacity to help<br />
themselves in the future, If he accepts this responsibility, his<br />
quarrel is with the State Governments, not with the Commonwealth<br />
Government, and he should direct his posturing to them.<br />
