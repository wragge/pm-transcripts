    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that Australia will provide a further $1.5 million in assistance, through Australian non-government organisations (NGOs), to the victims of India's devastating earthquake.</p>
<p>In announcing on 28 January the initial Australian contribution of $1 million, I indicated that Australia would continue to monitor the situation in Gujarat in order to determine how best to provide further assistance.</p>
<p>The Government's decision to provide a further $1.5 million is based on these more detailed assessments of the needs of those affected by the earthquake, including as a result of consultations with Australian NGOs assisting with the relief effort.</p>
<p>This brings to $2.5 million Australian emergency assistance to India in the wake of this immense disaster. In view of the large number of children affected by the earthquake, the initial Australian contribution is being channelled through UNICEF - the United Nations Childrens Fund - for use in the provision of safe drinking water, sanitation, medical supplies, shelter and trauma counselling.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to monitor the situation and stands ready to help further if required.</p>
<p>I wrote to Prime Minister Vajpayee on 29 January to express, on behalf of all Australians, my deepest condolences for the terrible loss of life and suffering caused by the Gujarat earthquake.</p>
