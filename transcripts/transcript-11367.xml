    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..................</p>
<p>  Well thank you very Mr Rosenbloom. To Professor Kune, to Betty, Mark and</p>
<p>   Monica, and to the late John Saunders many other friends and work mates</p>
<p>   and associates over a long period of time. I'm very privileged to have been</p>
<p>   asked to launch this book. I did know John well. I met him as Professor</p>
<p>   Kune said, in 1977 and I retained a great regard and respect for him for</p>
<p>   the remainder of his life and I do regard it as a privilege to launch this</p>
<p>   book, particularly here in the Holocaust Museum which was a testament to</p>
<p>   much of John Saunders dedication to the county he embraced so warmly, Australia,</p>
<p>   but also to the memories of so many Australians of Jewish Descent.</p>
<p>  Ladies and gentlemen, what Mr Rosenbloom said about the character of this</p>
<p>   book is true. It's the story of a very remarkable man. Like all of us he</p>
<p>   was a complex person. None of has are really of easily readable.ready explanation.</p>
<p>   Each of us have our contradictions and our complexities. John's story is</p>
<p>   a phenomenal story. It's a story of somebody who endured and witnessed the</p>
<p>   most unspeakable deeds of mankind's history. It's the story of a man who</p>
<p>   was incredibly successful in business. It's the story of a man who suffered</p>
<p>   a great deal of personal heartache. The loss of his first wife at the early</p>
<p>   age of 42. The end of a marriage to his second wife.</p>
<p>  It's also the story of a person who retained an incredible sense of hope</p>
<p>   and optimism throughout the whole of his life. And that to me is one of</p>
<p>   the things that makes this book, as Mr Rosenbloom said, something of a metaphor</p>
<p>   for a remarkable group of Australians. And they are the Australians who</p>
<p>   came to this country from Eastern Europe in the late 1940s and through the</p>
<p>   1950s. Many of them, and John amongst them, were Jewish who had suffered</p>
<p>   the terrible losses of the Holocaust, and who came to this country and despite</p>
<p>   that appallingly tragic background began to give to this country in enormous</p>
<p>   measure.</p>
<p>  And I began to have some contact with that contribution myself, ironically</p>
<p>   about the very year that John became an Australian citizen, 1957, because</p>
<p>   that was my first year at the Sydney University Law School. And for the</p>
<p>   first time in my life as somebody I suppose who'd grown up in a fairly traditional</p>
<p>   white Anglo-Saxon Protestant Australian background in the suburb of Earlwood,</p>
<p>   I came into contact for the first time in my life with a significant number</p>
<p>   of people of eastern European background, not totally, but predominantly</p>
<p>   Jewish. And I remember my first experiences of being received into the home</p>
<p>   of the late Paul and Vera Strasser in Dover Heights through my friendship</p>
<p>   with their son Peter who remains one of my closest friends to this day.</p>
<p>   And through that I began to know something of this remarkable group of Australians.</p>
<p>   I began my articles of clerkship with Myer Rosenblum, spelt with a 'u-m',</p>
<p>   in 1959, and through that also I developed and further nurtured that association.</p>
<p>  John was in so many ways a metaphor for that remarkable group of Australians</p>
<p>   who've had such a profound influence beneficially on our nation, and such</p>
<p>   a particularly profound influence on the city of Sydney.</p>
<p>  He was a businessman of remarkable tenacity and success, of very great integrity.</p>
<p>   Professor Kune records that in their early associations in business John</p>
<p>   Saunders and Frank Lowy resolved on two things - there would be no corruption</p>
<p>   and no lawyers. That they would avoid like the plague, so to speak, they</p>
<p>   would avoid any extensive litigation involving lawyers and that they would</p>
<p>   always try and settle their disputes.</p>
<p>  The book is also of course a chronicle of Australia's extraordinary post-war</p>
<p>   economic boom starting in the early 1950s with some temporary interruptions,</p>
<p>   all those pretty short lived, through to the relative stalling in the early</p>
<p>   1970s and then on again.</p>
<p>  It's also a very interesting study of the political and personal philosophy</p>
<p>   of a man. John to my mind exhibited throughout his life the characteristics</p>
<p>   of what I would call the liberal European approach to politics. He was a</p>
<p>   person who was always alert, as one would understand from his background</p>
<p>   and experiences, he was always alert to any sense of prejudice or discrimination.</p>
<p>   He was a person who dealt with people on their merits, and he was a person</p>
<p>   who believed in openness. He certainly had liberal economic theories. Professor</p>
<p>   Kune records that he was a fan of Milton Friedman's, but he was also a person</p>
<p>   who believed genuinely in a social security safety net. He took great care</p>
<p>   of his employees. He was very rewarding of loyalty. He drove a tough business</p>
<p>   bargain but it was a fair bargain and it was a bargain based on integrity.</p>
<p>  I found him to be a person with a great sense of humour and a great sense</p>
<p>   of fun, exemplified by the story in the book of how he offered a long standing</p>
<p>   employee at Westfields in reward for great service, a plane ticket from</p>
<p>   under his blotter, and then when that employee went into Frank's office,</p>
<p>   Frank offered him from under his blotter a plane ticket for the employee's</p>
<p>   wife. And it was just one of those many stories and one of those many illustrations</p>
<p>   of a person who had a sensitivity to those around him, and a sensitivity</p>
<p>   to those who cared for him and demonstrated business loyalty to him.</p>
<p>  John's life of course is not just bound up with business. He cared for his</p>
<p>   family very deeply. The establishment of Hope Town to care for mildly intellectually</p>
<p>   retarded people on the Central Coast was a manifestation, not only of particular</p>
<p>   care but also of a general philanthropic spirit. He was an incredibly generous</p>
<p>   supporter of charities within the Australian community. He quite properly</p>
<p>   lent very strong support to Jewish charities, but his generosity was not</p>
<p>   specific to Jewish causes. He was generous to the entire Australian community.</p>
<p>  We meet here of course, in the site of the old Maccabi Hall, of the Holocaust</p>
<p>   Museum, and this was a monument by John Saunders to the suffering and the</p>
<p>   devastation that descended upon the Jewish people of Europe, and a reminder</p>
<p>   to their children and their children and so on in subsequent generations,</p>
<p>   and indeed to the Australian people, of what occurred those years ago, and</p>
<p>   a symbol of the hope out of that disaster and sadness which was represented</p>
<p>   by John Saunders' life and John Saunders' achievement.</p>
<p>  Today's gathering brings together many people whose lives were touched by</p>
<p>   John. Of course his children and other members of his family, those who</p>
<p>   worked with him in business, those such as myself who knew him through our</p>
<p>   connection in politics and the life of this city. He was a person who was</p>
<p>   I found very loyal to his friends. I met him when I was Treasurer and I</p>
<p>   retained contact with him at every stage of my political career. I remember</p>
<p>   that he was one of those people that had bothered to retain contact with</p>
<p>   me when I was not the most fashionable figure in my party or in Australian</p>
<p>   politics. And of course one always remembers those things and it was the</p>
<p>   mark of the person that he would do that.</p>
<p>  I found the book amusing, interesting and uplifting. The stories of the</p>
<p>   early business activities, the attaining of that crucial bank loan from</p>
<p>   the late Les Irwin, the manager of the Commonwealth Bank at Blacktown, the</p>
<p>   establishment of the first Westfield Shopping Centre, of the debate that</p>
<p>   went on between Frank and John about how they would fix upon the name of</p>
<p>   Westfield. I found it a very entertaining book and one that tells in a very</p>
<p>   simple and direct way a very remarkable story. It's the story of somebody</p>
<p>   who triumphed over appalling evil. It's the story of somebody who struggled</p>
<p>   against a great deal of adversity in health and other personal circumstances</p>
<p>   throughout his life. And as somebody like myself and others in this audience</p>
<p>   who've lived all their lives in Australia and have taken it for granted</p>
<p>   that freedom and equality and non-discriminatory treatment by governments</p>
<p>   is your inherited right. I can only but be filled with admiration that a</p>
<p>   person such as John who was not always in that situation, but nonetheless</p>
<p>   was able to triumph over it and display such an enormous sense of hope and</p>
<p>   optimism.</p>
<p>  And the great thing that I take out of John Saunders; life, as I take out</p>
<p>   of the lives of so many contributors to this country as passionate Australians</p>
<p>   that he represented, was their incredible sense of hope and optimism. But</p>
<p>   it passes understanding for many of us that somebody who could have suffered</p>
<p>   so much retained such an incredible sense of hope and optimism, And they</p>
<p>   were similar thoughts that passed through my mind when less than a week</p>
<p>   ago I invested Nelson Mandela with the Honourary Order in the Order of Australia,</p>
<p>   and I marveled at that man's incredible sense of forgiveness and compassion,</p>
<p>   and despite the extraordinary suffering and depravation that he suffered,</p>
<p>   he retained such an extraordinarily generous disposition indeed towards</p>
<p>   some of the very people who persecuted him.</p>
<p>  John Saunders' life is a remarkable one. It's a great inspiration to Australian</p>
<p>   Jews. It's a great reminder to the rest of the Australian population of</p>
<p>   the incredible contribution of the Jewish community to the life and the</p>
<p>   strength of Australia through its entire existence. I count as one of the</p>
<p>   very honoured experiences of my life to have developed over the years in</p>
<p>   different ways by circumstances of friendship and otherwise, a close association</p>
<p>   with the Jewish community not only of Sydney but around Australia.</p>
<p>  John Saunders never forgot that he was Jewish, he never forgot that he came</p>
<p>   from eastern Europe, he never forgot the experiences that he suffered along</p>
<p>   with so many Jewish people in Europe. But he became forever Australian and</p>
<p>   contributed an incredible amount to this country, and Professor Kune's work</p>
<p>   is a lovely memorial, a great reminder, and a very heart felt tribute to</p>
<p>   a great Australian and I'm delighted to launch it. Thank you.</p>
