PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 30 AUGUST 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PMV: Less than an hour ago in one of the most cynical and provocative<br />
speeches I have ever heard delivered in Parliament the Leader of the<br />
Opposition, who has opposed the Native Title legislation and who said<br />
in Western Australia he would repeal it and who has opposed the Land<br />
Fund Bil has, in a speech attacking the Government and its mofi-vs7-,<br />
-saicfth~ t unless the Government fundamentally restructures the Land<br />
Fund Bill to give priority to health and housing only on that basis and<br />
subject to amendments by the Opposition would they support the Land<br />
Fund legislation.<br />
So, the Leader of the Opposition has attempted to fool the country by<br />
saying in the wake of Dr Hewson's dismissal, he is embracing a softer<br />
line on Aboriginal affairs and the Land Fund. In fact, he has done no<br />
such thing. He is putting up a set of sham amendments, weasel words<br />
from which he will then say if the Government doesn't accept the<br />
amendments he will vote against the Bill. Because fundamental to his<br />
objection is the same fundamental objection the Liberal Party has had<br />
all along to this, they don't want Aboriginal and Islander people to have<br />
access to land. They'll talk about anything but land and in the speech<br />
he implied that land was an issue, but not a fundamental one.<br />
So, three weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition said ' if necessary<br />
we would overturn the legislation.' His Deputy said on the Sunday<br />
program two weeks ago ' well, there would then be the opportunity for<br />
the States if they so wished to set up their own mechanisms for<br />
dealing with it'. The States who are managing land in all other areas<br />
as well and many of whom have been managing land in this area in<br />
the past to put in place their own mechanisms. And, when asked ' so<br />
you would happily abrogate your responsibility and give it back to the<br />
states' he said ' well, when you say abrogate, the responsibility<br />
traditionally has been there for the States all along and the question is<br />
for land management yes, for land management. </p>
<p>So, we have got the Leader of the Opposition three weeks ago, the<br />
Deputy Leader a week ago saying that they would overturn the Native<br />
Title legislation and give this right back to the States and now the<br />
second arm of the Government's land measures that is, giving<br />
Aboriginal people who can't avail themselves of the benefit of the<br />
Native Title legislation by cause of dispossession can now, through<br />
this fund buy land this is a complete anathema to the Liberal Party.<br />
Mr Downer would have been better coming and saying " I am opposing<br />
this Bill." " I don't believe that we should have a fund of over $ 1 billion<br />
being dedicated to Aboriginal people for the purchase of land." What<br />
he has done and how Ms Gallus can support his actions I cannot<br />
understand what he is i-aying-Ts, here is some sham amendments<br />
about health and education and unless you basically completely<br />
change this Bill so it essentially has a welfare orientation rather than a<br />
land orientation, we will oppose it.<br />
J: Have you seen the amendments, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: No, I haven't, but he..<br />
J: But how do you know they are a sham?<br />
PM: What he said was, I'm actually quoting him he said ' subject to our<br />
amendments.'<br />
J: But how do you know they are shams if you haven't seen them?<br />
PM: Well, because they are about functional spending on health and<br />
education.<br />
J: Wouldn't it have made more sense to have seen them before you<br />
came out and condemned them?<br />
PM: No, no it would not. I mean, this is a Bill about land. This is a Bill<br />
about land acquisition. This is a Bill about the central measure in<br />
justice for Aboriginal people, access to land. Now, the Native Title<br />
legislation provides land to Aboriginal people if they have a traditional<br />
connection with it. But, if they have lost the traditional connection they<br />
can only get it by acquisition. These are the two prongs of the M abo<br />
legislation. That is, the Native Title Act and the Land Fund and to try<br />
to cynically tear up the Land Fund by saying ' oh, it should be spent<br />
functionally on health and education and subject to the Government<br />
accepting our amendments we will oppose it' is high cynicism from<br />
somebody who never supported the principle in the first place.<br />
J: That's the end of the matter, you haven't looked at the amendments,<br />
but you are going to reject them? </p>
<p>PM: No, I made it clear it in my Second Reading speech that the<br />
Government would consider the amendments, but I said that the only<br />
test of the Opposition's veracity is whether they will vote for the<br />
Second Reading speech in the House of Representatives and in the<br />
Senate.<br />
J: Are you saying that there is no place for any money in the Land Fund<br />
to go to health or education?<br />
PM: No, because the Land Fund we've now made very large functional<br />
appropriations to health and education and I might say the Opposition<br />
opposed these, they wanted cut backs in health and edu~ catn<br />
spending in their Fightback. proposals that's health, education for<br />
Aboriginals in their Fightback proposals. The way to address these<br />
issues is through functional appropriations and functional<br />
management. This is about land and it is land which is central to<br />
Aboriginal dispossession and Aboriginal culture.<br />
J: What do you say to the general proposition that Government is placing<br />
more emphasis on land than on issues of health education and..<br />
PM: Well, I'd just say that is nonsense. I mean, when has the<br />
Commonwealth Parliament placed this sort of emphasis on land?<br />
Never. This is the first time. I mean, this is a good thing that is being<br />
done.<br />
J: But it could be ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: This is a good thing that's being done and the Government will not<br />
have some Opposition Leader with tawdry motives seeking to do it in.<br />
J: But Prime Minister, given that the Government broke Graham<br />
Richardson's promises on Aboriginal health and made a liar out of him,<br />
haven't you left yourself open to this sort of attack?<br />
PM: He never made promises which were Graham Richardson never<br />
made specific commitments and the nature of the commitments he did<br />
make, they have been honoured. You remember there has been the<br />
Aboriginal Deaths in Custody Royal Commission response, there has<br />
been the Budget funding, the Government has and I have some<br />
figures here committed between 1989-90 and 1993-94 $ 1 billion.<br />
Between 1994-95 and 1998-99 we will spend a further $ 1.5 billion on<br />
health for Aboriginal people. Now, look, in the professionalism of<br />
public life and in Canberra, if the Opposition believe that more money<br />
should be spent on health that's something they can argue in the<br />
Parliament, that's something the Government can reasonably consider,<br />
but to try and strike down the one bit of decent law that has come the<br />
way of the Aboriginal people in this country for land is a dreadful thing<br />
to do. </p>
<p>J: You're saying that this is a good thing that the Parliament is doing,<br />
wouldn't it be even better if it were achieved in a bipartisan manner,<br />
wouldn't it be even more powerful and isn't it your responsibility as<br />
Prime Minister to try and achieve that end?<br />
PM: Well, I offered that bipartisanship to Dr Hewson. He came in and said<br />
on the Third Reading of the Native Title Bill, ' it was a day of shame'. I<br />
offered the same thing in my Second Reading speech which was not a<br />
political speech, I mean not a political speech, in today's House to be<br />
met with what? You know, essentially a provocative political speech<br />
which said now if -you don't cop the amendments subject to our<br />
changes they are the terms on which we will pass it.<br />
J: Are you ultimately confident of the support of minor parties in the<br />
Senate or do you think we'll see another repeat of last year?<br />
PM: Well, I'm confident that a Bill of this merit will pass. I mean, this has<br />
been debated with the Aboriginal community and Islander community<br />
in this country and with other groups. I mean, there has been a long<br />
process of negotiation here which went back to the original Native Title<br />
negotiations. But, I mean, go back to what Mr Downer said in Perth.<br />
He made it clear he may repeal it if necessary. Mr Costello has<br />
confirmed that, saying that they regard land management as a matter<br />
for the States. But, they overlook the fact that in 1967 the nation gave<br />
the Commonwealth, Parliament power to legislate in respect of<br />
Aboriginal and Islander people and it is under that power, and facing a<br />
High Court decisionQ' that the Commonwealth did legislate with the<br />
Native Title Bill. Now, I can only say this to you, let me repeat here<br />
what I said in the House, the Government will consider the<br />
Opposition's amendments. There may be some elements of them that<br />
we can accept, but there is only one test about this whether the<br />
Opposition vote for the Bill at the Second reading.<br />
J: Wouldn't that put the acid right back on, if as it turns out they are<br />
somewhat more benign than you fear?<br />
PM: Well, the Leader of the Opposition I've made a Second Reading<br />
speech and so has he. He has said subject to our amendments. They<br />
were his words. The Land Fund needs to be restructured to give<br />
priority to health and education. In other words, restructured not to<br />
give priority to land.<br />
J: Given the Opposition's concern about health and housing, do you now<br />
expect their support of the social justice package next year?<br />
PM: Well, I don't know what to expect from them. I mean, let me repeat a<br />
point I made to you earlier. It would have been better for Alexander<br />
Downer, at least people would say ' well, he has a view and he is<br />
standing by it, he doesn't believe there should be wholesale<br />
acquisition of land by Aboriginal people and he is opposed to it'. </p>
<p>Instead of that he gives the press this story they are going to be softer<br />
on the Land Fund and that gets written all over the place and this is<br />
basically to pull over moderates in the wake of Dr Hewson's dismissal.<br />
And, what do we find in the end? It is really just a device to knock the<br />
Bill over.<br />
ends </p>
