    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd today opened the Sydney Ozanam Learning Centre, a facility that will provide new opportunities for homeless people.</p>
<p>The St Vincent de Paul Society facility will enable homeless people, and people at risk of homelessness, to participate in educational and recreational activities.</p>
<p>This represents a realisation that the time for providing just a hot meal and a bed is well and truly over. We need to tackle the underlying causes of homelessness.</p>
<p>Education is critical for people to begin participating again  -  in their community and in the economy.</p>
<p>People who are homeless will only become more excluded if they do not have access to opportunities to learn.</p>
<p>The opening of Ozanam marks a significant new direction for the Society's Matthew Talbot Homeless Services, and one which runs in parallel to the Rudd Government's direction on homelessness.</p>
<p>Recently released Census data from the ABS shows that despite our efforts, the numbers of homeless Australians has increased.</p>
<p>Every night there are now 105,000 people in Australia are homeless. This is an increase of 5,000 from Census night 2001.</p>
<p>That is why reducing homelessness is a major priority for the Rudd Government.</p>
<p>The Government's first White Paper will set the agenda for reducing homelessness over the next decade.</p>
<p>The White Paper will include a national action plan to reduce homelessness.</p>
<p>It will be bold and ambitious, setting the agenda for reducing homelessness over the next decade to 2020.</p>
<p>We have had consultations on the White Paper and we are discussing the White Paper with the States and Territories  -  through COAG.</p>
<p>The White Paper is a once in a generation opportunity to drastically reduce the unacceptable rates of homelessness in Australia.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government congratulates the St Vincent De Paul Society on this significant achievement today.</p>
