PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
UNEDITED INTERVIEW WITH PRU GOWARD, ABC RADIO NATIONAL,<br />
12 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PG: Prime Minister, Mr Howard's address in reply basically talks about<br />
your broken promises the L-A-W law tax cuts, the rise in the<br />
Medicare levy does that leave you " going into an election with a<br />
credibility problem?<br />
PM: No. Here he is, he has a Budget reply and he hasn't got a policy<br />
he had 45 minutes 30 minutes, sorry to give the country his<br />
policies, and he didn't have any. It was a sort of 1970s raucous,<br />
empty policy-free speech, and I don't really think that hurling rhetoric<br />
or abuse at a Prime Minister is any substitute for an opposition's<br />
position or policy. Our people on our side of the Parliament were<br />
very cheered up by Mr Howard's speech, because they thought it<br />
was so bad. And when you think about the weight and content of the<br />
Budget speech which Ralph Willis delivered on Tuesday night<br />
and the empty, rhetorical Spe-eh-tha-John Howard replied to it with,<br />
the difference between the Government and the Opposition was<br />
plain and stark for all to see.<br />
PG: All right, but what about the credibility problem that he argues is<br />
yours?<br />
PM: I don't think we have a credibility problem. In the election I said 2<br />
things we would restart the growth in the economy, and that we<br />
would get employment going. We saw the second largest fall ever<br />
yesterday in employment 90,000 fall for last month. We have now<br />
had 640,00 jobs since the election it's the largest fall in<br />
unemployment in Australia's history the recording of the fall in<br />
unemployment, the largest fall we have ever seen. They were the<br />
principle commitments I made at the election not to leave the<br />
unemployed behind, to put an arm out, to bring them up. We did it </p>
<p>with raw employment and we also did it with Working _ Ngtion, with the<br />
long-term unemployed. On the tax cuts, I said in the One Nation<br />
policy that there would be 2 tax cuts one we paid in full, brought itforward<br />
and paid it in full at the end 1993, the second, we have paid<br />
more than it was worth $ 3.5 billion, we are going to spend $ 4.2<br />
billion paying the second into superannuation accounts. And I<br />
believe that most Australians will think it is better in the<br />
superannuation account than simply paid as cash. Now, that means<br />
that with almost complete fidelity to the things we undertook in the<br />
election, we have done. Unlike most Australian Governments, we<br />
have actually got these achievements into place growth<br />
employment, the tax cuts, looking after long-term unemployed and of<br />
course the other great issues like Mabo and APEC and Hilmer.<br />
PG: I mean, he says though, technically, it is a breaking of a tax promise.<br />
What you're basically saying is that you have changed the content of<br />
the tax promise, but still delivered?<br />
PM: That's right. We have spent more than the promise was originally<br />
costed at $ 3.5 billion we will actually now spend $ 4.2 billion, but<br />
it's a bit rich coming from John Howard who, in the 1977 election, the<br />
Liberal party as their central policy, a program of tax cuts, and they<br />
had as their logo a fist with a handful of dollars. And we were all<br />
enjoined to ring up a certain toll free number to find out what our tax<br />
cuts were. Five months later as Treasurer, he took them away<br />
completely. And you might remember that famous front page in the<br />
Illawarra Mercury which said " Lies, Lies, Lies". John Howard is up<br />
there tonight talking about transparency and decency and budgetary<br />
policy, yet it was of him that John Stone wrote that the fiscal<br />
deterioration in 1983 was the most rapid since the war, and that he<br />
had told then-Treasurer Howard about the $ 9.6 billion budget deficit,<br />
but he wouldn't reveal it in the last 2 weeks of the 1983 election. So,<br />
to be up talking about transparency of budgets is unbelievable. And<br />
then of course, the other thing he did, he stood up with the Tax Act<br />
he said " this is how big it was in my day, and this is how big it is<br />
now". Well, the answer to that is sure John, it's bigger because we<br />
caught up with all the people avoiding tax, and that is what he<br />
should have done.<br />
PG: But do you think the electorate will go back 18 years I mean, there<br />
are a lot of kids who are voters who weren't born 18 years ago. I<br />
mean, the focus is really going to be on your promises not his?<br />
PM: No. But, there are plenty of people in public life, and in community<br />
life, who remember the cynical commitment of John Howard to those<br />
tax cuts, and he took them away, and the ones that he offered in<br />
1982-3 and couldn't pay for, which then blew out the Budget in 1983.<br />
this is twice he's had a go at this, but look at how many tax cuts that I<br />
delivered on behalf of the Government through the 1980s about<br />
of them all of them paid under the Accord to the letter. And then </p>
<p>One Nation, the first lot paid to the letter. In this week's Budget, they<br />
are to be paid for the betterment of everybody. In other words, they<br />
add to savings, but it's the great historic opportunity to say to people<br />
" 1you put 3% away yourself, and the Government will match it". This<br />
will bring everyone in the country under the Government's<br />
superannuation policies to 15%, and I gave the figures in the House<br />
yesterday. And what they mean, and show, is that under this<br />
scheme, someone on average weekly earnings which is $ 33,000<br />
would, in today's dollars-, have-a parcel of money of just on half a<br />
million, and that would guarantee them an annuity for the balance of<br />
their life of $ 30,000 a year. So, in retirement, someone on $ 33,000<br />
today would in the same dollars, in the dollars of the day have a<br />
retirement income of $ 30,000. Now, is this not a more sensible,<br />
better thing to do with the tax cuts, than simply just pay them off as<br />
cash, and not take, if you like, the generosity of spirit, the<br />
opportunity to build this great savings reform.<br />
PG: Well, he listed a few broken promises, and we won't go through them<br />
all now, but I mean his basic conclusion was how can you trust Paul<br />
Keating to deliver the Government's promise on superannuation<br />
when there have been these other broken promises and it is after<br />
all, after an election?<br />
PM: We reject absolutely the broken promises routine. You look at all of<br />
the great bulk of the Government's commitments the generalised<br />
child care cash rebate in and proposed the parenting allowance<br />
in. The h-ome child care allowance legislated. It's very unfair for<br />
people to make, for John Howard, to be making these points.<br />
PG: What about the current account deficit, and he said " 9 years later<br />
after banana republic, and it's still not fixed the electorate are<br />
cynical"?<br />
PM: The reason why it's not fixed, Pru, is because, there has been a big<br />
savings hole in Australia. And that is, the nation has saved much<br />
less than it did in the 50s and 60s. And the reason for that was,<br />
inflation 10 or 12 years of high inflation established in everyone's<br />
mind that the last thing they should do is put money away. Buy the<br />
flat, buy a second house, buy a holiday house do anything but put<br />
money away. Now, we are now back... . we have had 3 years of low<br />
inflation, but 3 years doesn't change the sort of savings notions<br />
inculcated in people. What the Government has done now, and it<br />
did in the 1980s, is to make a very large change in fiscal policy we<br />
have seen exports now go up by 50%, for 14% of GDP to 21 and<br />
that's worth about $ 18 billion a year, God knows where we would be<br />
without that and now, in Tuesday night's Budget, we are going to<br />
see a 4 percentage point turnaround in the Budget balance, from a<br />
deficit of 2.9% of GDP to 1.7% of GDP in the next few years. And<br />
out of superannuation, we will see the Treasury estimates that the<br />
super change will be worth 4% of the GDP by the year 2020. Well, </p>
<p>let's say we are talking about 2000 rather than 2020, and call it 2%<br />
of GDP. The current account problem is only 2 percentage points of<br />
GDP that's how big the problem is that's $ 10 billion a year. That's<br />
largely the size of the problem. So, the Government's put in, if you<br />
like, a 6 percentage point fix in Tuesday night's Budget, for a 2<br />
percentage point problem. And when we said to John Howard " well,<br />
what would you do, John?", he wouldn't give us any policies. He<br />
would...<br />
PG: He said you steal them?<br />
PM: Did we steal occupational superannuation? Did we steal the policies<br />
of putting 15% into super away from him? He has<br />
always opposed it always opposed it. The general change in the<br />
Budget balance he said he was going to vote against the revenue<br />
increases. That change that we put in there on Tuesday night will<br />
basically, I believe, handle the current account problems and that's<br />
what the long-term bond market told us in the last couple of days<br />
when they confirmed that 1 percentage point fall in the long bond<br />
rate. Let me just say this the pressure off interest rates that this<br />
Budget will bring, will keep growth going through the 90s, and this<br />
gives a lie to Howard's principal claim that we have had 5 minutes of<br />
sunshine, which is just a cynical lie a cynical bit of opportunism.<br />
PG: But it hurts, doesn't it? You keep biting on it?<br />
PM; All lies hurt. So if a lie is effective, it doesn't mean to say it's right.<br />
We have had 3.5 years of growth, and the Treasury is now saying<br />
we have got 3 years coming up. So, we have got 6 years there. you<br />
know we used to have a thing called the bond selling program? This<br />
year because of the Budget going into surplus the bond selling<br />
program will be about $ 15 billion less $ 15,000 million. Because<br />
there are going be fewer bonds around, the price of bonds will rise,<br />
and therefore the interest rate on them drops. That's why the bond<br />
market confirmed the 1 percentage point fall so the Government<br />
has effectively reduced the pressure on interest rates in this Budget<br />
effectively, and the bond market has said so. Not John Howard<br />
the bond market. These are the important things. But John Howard<br />
had a chance to say where he would change the Budget Peter<br />
Costello, on his behalf, has said they would not increase tax at all.<br />
So, if he believes that the public sector should be saving more, and<br />
he thinks that we have got to do a big change, like 2% of the GDP to<br />
deal with the current account, in his terms, it all must come from cuts<br />
in Government spending. Now, 2% of GOP is $ 10 billion how could<br />
he cut $ 10 billion for government spending. And if that's his policy,<br />
he ought to say he must know where it has got to come from he<br />
had that Finance Department list he was running around with he<br />
knows it has got to come from payments to families, or pensions, or<br />
payments to schools or to universities, or to TAFE, or defence, or<br />
payments to the States. They're the only places -you can get </p>
<p>billion out of a Budget of just over $ 100 billion. And he was mum on<br />
that subject last night he wouldn't say a word about it, and that's<br />
why I think he has squibbed the opportunity.<br />
PG: Well, he says that the next election is going to be based on who<br />
people believe you or him. Are you going to take him up on that?<br />
PM: The proof is in the pudding. When I came along, Australia was an<br />
unconfident, inward looking, country ring-fenced by tariffs with an<br />
uncompetitive managed exchange rate and rust-bucket industries.<br />
That's what John Howard left me as Treasurer with double-digit<br />
unemployment and double-digit inflation. What have we got today?<br />
We have got inflation now at just a little over 2% 2.5% and we<br />
have got unemployment just a little over It's a whole world of<br />
difference. And you know, Australia today is 40% more competitive<br />
than 1983 you can't believe that number, and that's the Treasury's<br />
number. Not or 14%, 40% 40% more competitive. So, that<br />
was the Australia that I was left, and look at what we have got today<br />
a modern, international, competitive, low-inflation, economy. So, if<br />
it's a case of believing me, or a guy that has had no policy guts he<br />
got nothing done as Treasurer, who squibbed all the big fights and<br />
financial de-regulation on the exchange rate, on tariffs, on social<br />
policy, on savings, on superannuation, on productivity, on product<br />
innovation, on education I mean, there shouldn't be a contest. And<br />
so that's Government MP's last night were in very, very high<br />
spirits at Howard's speech, and the Coalition MP's were very glum,<br />
because they realised that feisty little sort of speech style that Mr<br />
Howard employs on a Matter of Public Importance in the Parliament<br />
or in Question Time, is not the material for a budget reply. But that's<br />
as good as he could do, and it wasn't good enough.<br />
PG: You did have terrific news yesterday on unemployment it has<br />
dropped a lot, to 8.3% but if it's only going to be 8% by the end of<br />
the year, I mean, is that enough? I mean, that's still a lot of people<br />
out of work what else are you going to do?<br />
PM: We have got 8% in the Budget, we may do better than 1 hope<br />
we do. But again, I think the forecasts are erring on the cautious<br />
side. We're at 8.3% now, 2 days after the Budget. Can we get to<br />
8% in 12 months? There is some prospect that we will do better.<br />
But employment could also.... . you can't keep jobs growing at 90,000<br />
a month. That may slow down over the course of the year, and<br />
participation rates change too. Our target is for 5% unemployment<br />
by the year 2000. We would be the only western country within<br />
cooee of it within cooee of it. And Working Nation is helping us<br />
now get the long-term unemployed back to work there is 102,000<br />
long-term unemployed people gone back to work in this last year. In<br />
the same period in the 80s, it would have been 10,000, it's now<br />
102,000. By being able to grate big chunks out of that pool of longterm<br />
unemployed people and getting them back into the labour </p>
<p>market, it really means that the target of 5% can be achieved. And I<br />
think the forecast in the Budget for growth over the next 3 years to<br />
be sustained on a low-inflationary basis means that we can basically<br />
get there. That is what we are going to do about unemployment, and<br />
that's what the Coalition can't do.<br />
PG: You like forward forecasts, and it is a hopeful picture, but not<br />
tomorrow not in the run-up to the next election which is presumably<br />
less than a year away I mean, isn't that the problem for you and the<br />
electorate? That it's a promise that doesn't start, really, in some<br />
ways until 1997?<br />
PM: Except that the job growth is there now the GDP growth is there<br />
now and it's been there, really, since 1993, so 1993, 1994 and<br />
1995. In 1994 and 1995, the Australian economy grew faster than<br />
any other western world economy that's a great achievement. And<br />
in this public debate, we have got a sort of unreality debate. Here<br />
we are with an environment I can't recall at any time in my<br />
parliamentary life where we have had 5% economic growth and 2%<br />
inflation. We have got, sure this time, a little slower we want it<br />
slower, about 3.75% 4% economic growth. Treasury is forecasting<br />
3.75%, and inflation slightly up on that 2-3% range, but a<br />
tremendous environment for growth, and I think a lot of people are<br />
going to have to say " well, do we turn our back on that do we turn<br />
our back on these long-term things like savings, or Hilmer, or Apec,<br />
or the big social changes like Mabo do we that to go basically back<br />
to a party with 1950s values, and a leader with a 1950s view of the<br />
world?".<br />
PG: So you think you can win the next election with the present<br />
current... . with the current economic circumstances?<br />
PM: The Government has set up a low inflation, contestable, high<br />
productivity, pro-growth economy. And I don't think any community<br />
in this country has ever turned a Government out on those<br />
conditions.<br />
PG: So do you reckon this year? An election this year?<br />
PM: No there will be an election I have always said that I think it is<br />
better when we get as much value I mean, they're too hard to win<br />
elections here they are short terms, they are 2.5 to 3 years mostly<br />
they are too hard to win without giving time away. And I think the<br />
public expect value for their money from....<br />
PG: are you calculating that the longer you leave John Howard there,<br />
the harder it will be for him?<br />
PM: I think that the more people see of him, the more they think he is just<br />
the same John Howard from the 1980s. The only thing is, he is not </p>
<p>the same John Howard from the 1980s the John Howard of the<br />
1980s had a little more fizz to him, a little more bubble, sparkle. And<br />
I think what last night's speech showed is that he can't cut the<br />
mustard as he used to. He could never cut the policy mustard, but<br />
now he can't cut the rhetoric either. So, I think that is going to<br />
become apparent as time goes on. There was a very great chance<br />
for John Howard last night on national television, within a year of<br />
an election, well within a year of an election, of saying where he<br />
stood. He took, rather, the opportunity to attack me.<br />
PG: And just finally, I mean you do like forward projections big plans<br />
what about yours? I mean, do you think you will be here to see the<br />
1998/ 99 changes that you have promised?<br />
PM: I joined Bill Kelty and his colleagues in the ACTU, working on<br />
superannuation, in 1985/ 86 we put the 3% schem-e together then.<br />
And then we were tickled pink with ourselves when we got it to<br />
and then we got the superannuation guarantee levy in place, which<br />
took it to 9% by the year 2002. And now we have been able to add<br />
6% to that in Tuesday's Budget. You do like to think that great<br />
things like this that take time to be around to see them happen,<br />
and, as I say, to make them Tory-proof, so that some nasty little<br />
right-winger won't get their ideological little fingernails under them<br />
and try to remove them. It's not just a matter of reform in Australia<br />
it's keeping it. And I think Bill Kelty and I will be long enough around<br />
to repel boarders.<br />
PG: Mr Keating, thank you for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you indeed.<br />
ends. </p>
