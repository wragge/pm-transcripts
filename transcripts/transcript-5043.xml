MEDIA RELEASE 8 MAY 1979<br />
STATE DINNER -MANILA<br />
I am greatly honoured to be your guest so soon after my arrival<br />
in your country. It is also my privilege, I understand, to be<br />
the first Head of Government to be entertained in this splendidly<br />
renovated and quite magnificent banquet room a room which is a<br />
tribute to Madam Marcos' renowned artistic talents and great<br />
interest in Philippine culture and history.<br />
Mr President, the warm and gracious hospitality given to visitors<br />
to the Philippines is world renowned and this evening's dinner<br />
exemplifies that hospitality.<br />
Since I became Prime Minister of Australia I have travelled<br />
through Manila twice and had discussions with you and your<br />
distinguished Foreign Minister,' General Romulo. But this is the<br />
first occasion on which I have been able to spend several days<br />
in your capital.<br />
I recall very clearly our discussions in Kuala Lumpur the last<br />
occasion on which we met and I look forward to following up<br />
the valuable exchange of views we had on that occasion.<br />
Our countries are old friends, sharing many common interestsand<br />
tonight I wish to re-emphasise and re-affirm the friendship<br />
between our peoples. For more than three decades our countries<br />
have enjoyed close relations. Australia and the Philippines were<br />
two of the original three signatories of the United Nations<br />
Charter from this region. We have been comrades in arms in two<br />
wars. You, yourself Mr President will always be remembered<br />
for the part you played in the defence of your country during the<br />
Pacific War. As will those countrymen who fought with you.<br />
After the heroic defence of Bataan, and Corregidor, President<br />
Qezon and General Macarthur were evacuated, initially to Australia,<br />
to be followed by our good friend General Romulo. And it was in<br />
Australia that the campaign to liberate the Philippines was<br />
planned. The ties formed in a time of common peril, are now part of the<br />
fabric of the history of our two countries.<br />
Today the Philippines, with population of 44 million its level<br />
of education and technology its support of the free enterprise<br />
system its favourable attitude towards foreign investment its<br />
economic potential and prospects as a growing market is an<br />
important country for Australia. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Philippines' prominent ro le in ASEAN enhances this importance.<br />
Your country's economy like the economies of the other countries<br />
of ASEAN, has undergone rapid growth over recent years. At the<br />
same time, in the space of some four years, you-have undertaken<br />
a major attack on inflation and created new jobs -for an<br />
expanding labour force.<br />
These achievements are all the more remarkable in the face of the<br />
generally depressed state of the world economy. This, I think<br />
tells us something about the role your country and the other<br />
countries of the South East Asian Region can be expected to playin<br />
the development of the international economy.<br />
In this sense it is particularly appropriate, Mr President, that<br />
your Government is hosting the fifth United Nations Conference on<br />
Trade and Development.<br />
Forums like UNCTAD are crucial in today's world, when the developing<br />
and developed countries must maintain the closest dialogue. In<br />
their endeavours to meet the challenges of the global economy<br />
UNCTAD has shown that it can be an effective force for improving the<br />
existing international economic. system by bridging the differences between<br />
developed and developing nations but much more needs to be done.<br />
There is a need at UNCTAD to pay attention to the problems of<br />
inflation inflation which reduces the growth of domestic markets,<br />
hinders the expansion of world trade and increases pressure for<br />
protectionism. If greater progress is to be made in improving<br />
access to markets, if new market growth is to be generated and<br />
standards to be raised, inflation must be rigorously combatted.<br />
The goals of economic development and the raising of living<br />
standards will best be achieved in a peaceful and stable world.<br />
Unfortunately, it cannot be said that we live in such a world<br />
today. In the Middle East, and Africa there are serious tensions<br />
which are of concern to us both. Fighting in Kampuchea continues<br />
and there is little sign of progress in the talks between China<br />
and Vietnam. Indeed, Indo-China has become a battle ground for<br />
a conflict between Communist States a conflict which has the<br />
potential to draw in the major powers and thereby threaten the<br />
stability of the region.<br />
In such a situation we need to exercise our influence as a force<br />
for moderation and for the peaceful resolution of differences.<br />
We all have a role to play in this. It is not enough to leave it<br />
to the great powers or to the weight of numbers. It-does not<br />
matter whether nations are aligned or non-aligned. What is<br />
important is that nations with moderate views put them forward<br />
forcefully and with vigour, and find reasonable solutions to<br />
international problems.<br />
Australia is very conscious of the importance of ASEAN as a force<br />
for moderation in the Region. ASEAN has emerged as a most<br />
cohesive and resilient grouping of countries in recent South East<br />
Asian history. We fully share and support the fundamental aims<br />
of ASEAN the maintenance of peace and stability in South East<br />
Asia, freedom from Great Power rivalry the promotion of<br />
friendly relations with other countries and the raising of the<br />
living standards of the peoples of the Region. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Let me emphasise, Mr President, that Australia's interest and<br />
involvement in South East Asia is strong and growing, and that<br />
it is a central and enduring policy objective of the Australian<br />
Government to strengthen contacts and relationships with ASEAN<br />
in all fields of common interest. The acronym ASEAN has a<br />
second meaning for us its stands not only for the Association<br />
of Souff East Asian Nations but also for Australia's South<br />
East Asian Neighbours.<br />
It is also fundamental Australian policy to consolidate,<br />
strengthen and develop in the years ahead our already close,<br />
cordial and co-operative relationship with the Philippines.<br />
I believe that the relationship between our countries has<br />
developed very well since we last met in Kuala Lumpur. Our<br />
political commitment to strengthen the relations between our<br />
nations has been matched by concrete actions. We have increased<br />
our political exchanges through inaugural officials's talks and<br />
the strengthening of our Embassies.<br />
Trade between us is expanding rapidly with your exports to<br />
Australia, growing at more than 45%~ per annum. We have initialled<br />
a double taxation agreement and signed an important nuclear<br />
safeguards' agreement, which will open the way for the sale of<br />
Australian uranium to the Philippines.<br />
Australia fully appreciates the problems developing countries face<br />
with their energy programmes and you can look to Australia as a<br />
reliable supplier of uranium and coal in the future.<br />
In addition to the initiatives I have mentioned, it is worth<br />
noting that Australia's two largest development assistance<br />
projects anywhere in the world are both in the Philippines.<br />
Both our countries are concerned that international recognition<br />
should be given to measures promoting the development and wellbeing<br />
of all countries and people.<br />
We share a common concern for the peace, security and stability<br />
of the South East Asian Region to which we both belong. We share<br />
a common concern for economic and social progress and justice in<br />
this region. We share a common support for the forces of<br />
co-operation, moderation and toleration in the conduct of our<br />
international and regional relations.<br />
Our common concerns and purposes will become increasingly<br />
important in the years to come. Thank you for your invitation<br />
tonight, which gives us the opportunity to discuss the issues<br />
which concern us both and a chance to build our approach to<br />
the problems and the very great opportunities which lie ahead.<br />
