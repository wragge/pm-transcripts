DINNER IN HONOUR OF<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
A. I. D. A. were hosts at a dinner which was held in<br />
Sydney on 7th September, 1964, at which the guest<br />
of honour was the Prime Minister of Australia, the<br />
Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies. Some 240 of Australia's<br />
business leaders in secondary industry, banking and<br />
commerce attended to hear the Prime Minister's<br />
address. The major purpose of this dinner was to<br />
further the exchange of opinions, and to promote<br />
closer undersanding of mutual problems, between<br />
private enterprise and government.<br />
Sir Robert Menzies was welcomed and introduced<br />
by the President of Mr. F. M. Wiltshire,<br />
whose remarks are summarised as follows.<br />
" It is my privilege to welcome our guest of honour,<br />
the Prime Minister of Australia, the Rt. Hon. Sir<br />
Robert Menzies. The Prime Minister has done great<br />
honour to this Association in finding time in his significantly<br />
busy life to address us tonight. We are<br />
proud of the distinction he has conferred upon us,<br />
and we thank him for it. I am glad to say that there<br />
are representatives from every State in the Commonwealth<br />
here tonight.<br />
" in being with us, Sir Robert follows something<br />
of0 family tradition, because, in consulting our<br />
October, 1964. </p>
<p>records, we find that a Mr. James Menzies joined this<br />
Associati ' on in 1937, and Senator J. W. Leckie in 1929.<br />
The late James Menzies was the father of the Prime<br />
Minister, and a great fighter for Australian industry.<br />
The late Senator Leckie was the Prime Minister's<br />
father-in-law, and acted in this Association's affairs<br />
for a number of years.<br />
" As to the Prime M'vinister himself, we have never<br />
had any doubt about where he stands on industrial<br />
development in Australia. From time to time we have<br />
agreed to differ in detail but we have always known<br />
where he stands in principle.<br />
" What' can one say on an' occasion like this about<br />
the Prime Minister. I have before me a condensed<br />
record of the Prime Minister's achievements which<br />
covers five pages. It would take an hour or longer to<br />
read it to you, and elaborate upon it. Nevertheless I<br />
cannot let this opportunity pass without making some<br />
reference to this magnificent record a record vast<br />
in its scope, a record of a great talent applied in a<br />
field which has been described as the most worthy profession<br />
a man can follow that of Legislator. It is<br />
an inspiring record, a record of which Australia must<br />
justly be proud, a record known round the world,<br />
where Sir Robert is regarded as one of the great<br />
figures of our time."<br />
The Prime Minister opened his address in ininmitably<br />
witty fashion, with an exchange of pleasant personalities,<br />
but he did refer, in passing, to a subject of<br />
some significance to ' the textile industry*. Major<br />
extracts from his address are given below.<br />
" Mr. Wiltshire, your reference to my father and<br />
my father-in-law has touched me very much. My<br />
father was not only possessed of strong views, but was<br />
very vocal about them and, in those days,' it took a<br />
certain amount of courage for a man to be a protectionist<br />
in a free trade area. My father was a violent<br />
protection ist,. and the first arguments I ever heard<br />
were those of my father explaining what nonsense<br />
free trade. was * and how important it was to have a<br />
protective tariff. . Those were the days when great<br />
arguments went onl about protection or free trade.<br />
At the turn of the century, this was the great free<br />
trade State, and Victoria was the great protectionist<br />
State and that was one of the reasons why they<br />
inserted ( to the great profit of the legal profession)<br />
Section 92 in the Constitution. For a long time after<br />
that, the party position in Australia tended to be on<br />
the issue of free, trade or protection. I am happy to<br />
say that those days are as dead as the Dodo. Now<br />
there is nobody who is a free trader because<br />
smugglers have almost disappeared and the only<br />
argument now is not whether there ought to be protection,<br />
but what the degree of protection ought to be.<br />
I have lived long enough to find that all sorts of<br />
p~ eop~ le are high protectionists who were once regarded<br />
as low tariff men. In other words, we have got to the<br />
* Sir Robert spoke of a conversation with Dame Pattie<br />
Menzies, in which she referred to her Inability to obtain<br />
Australian made fine woollen textiles In retail emporiums.<br />
( This is not the fault of Australian manufacturers.) point where most people believe in a protective tariff<br />
and in the development of Australian industry.<br />
" But at the same time, we still have argumentsthe<br />
longer we live the.* more sophisticated we become<br />
politically, the more we find things to disagree about.<br />
I thought, tonight, I would like to talk to you about<br />
three or four of what I regard as the fallacies so popular<br />
to economic thinking. Before 1 do that, I ought to<br />
say at onice that my own views are not destructive<br />
ones on this matter, they are entirely' constructive. I<br />
beli eve in the growth Of this country. I believe in<br />
the secondary industries of this country, because they<br />
can do things in relation to immigration and in relation<br />
to national development that perhaps nobody<br />
else can.' I believe in those things, but I also believe<br />
that in the long run the national balance of Australian<br />
development will depend upon two or three<br />
things. One is that there should be a constant expansion<br />
of secondary industry. One is that there should<br />
be a constant consideration for the provision of primary<br />
industry, which still p) roduces the overwhelming<br />
bulk of our export income and is therefore primarily<br />
responsible for our international solvency. A third<br />
thing is that I believe in growth it would be a<br />
strange thing for a man who has had the great fortune<br />
to be Prime Minister of this country so long not to<br />
realise that it is the growth of this country which<br />
determines the future of this country. That is growth<br />
in all fields. But also I happen to believe that one of<br />
the great enemies of growth is instability instability<br />
in the monetary world an inflationary boom, followed<br />
by burst, and acute counter-inflationary<br />
action. A lot of people seem to think that this is -due<br />
to the mischievous, wrong view of the politicians. It<br />
is not it is primarily due to the fact that, in a young<br />
country which is expanding enormously, we may have<br />
these Lips and downs. Whenever -there -is an " up"<br />
somebody is delighted, and whenever this is a " down"<br />
somebody is a bit peeved. It is. the humble, necessary,<br />
task of the politician to try to reduce the uips and<br />
downs by producing a climate which will enable<br />
uis to havre stability to an adequate extent and growth<br />
to an adequate extent. This is the great task of<br />
economic policy. Having all these things in my mind,<br />
I thought to offer you a view or two on some of the<br />
Current fallacies.<br />
" Every year I read ( and quite recently I read it<br />
again) that there is something wrong with the Commonwealth<br />
Government paLying for its works programme<br />
out of revenue.. Somebody will say, with all<br />
the air of a new discovery: % Vh71y don't you take it out<br />
of loan money?' This, I believe, is absur-d. I have<br />
lived long enough to know that facts are more formidable<br />
than theory. One must always have a theory.<br />
One must always have a set of principles in his mind,<br />
but one must never allow them to overwhelm the facts,<br />
because facts have something indomitable about<br />
them. Why does the Commonwealth pay, to our works<br />
programme, a couple of htundred million pounds out<br />
of revenue and ask the taxpayer to produce the<br />
money? The answer is quite simple. The whole of<br />
the loan raisings in Australia, ( though theoretically<br />
October, 1964. </p>
<p>the Commonwealth is entitled to a fifth of them under<br />
the financial agreement) go to the States for their<br />
works programmes. It would be well worth remembering<br />
that, when the financial agreement was made<br />
back in the twenties, the whole theory was that the<br />
Loan Council would have one simple task: how much<br />
money can be borrowed on reasonable terms and conditions.<br />
1 can remember attending a Loan Council<br />
meeting ( not as a Principal but as an assistant) many<br />
years ago, and at that time the whole loan works programme<br />
for Australia was about œ E20m. Mvr. Lyons<br />
was Prime Minister at that time, and I was his Deputy<br />
in his own party and Attorney-General. Now, of<br />
course, it is two or three hundred million pounds,<br />
and everybody is accustomed to. these figures. But<br />
one of the things that has never been properly understood<br />
is that, whereas the Loan Council under the<br />
financial agreement began by determining how much<br />
could be borrowed on reasonable terms and conditions,<br />
that question no longer arises. When we meet<br />
there is a great argument with each State putting its<br />
plan, and ultimately we end up by saying: the States<br />
Works Programme is to be œ E335m. ( or whatever it<br />
might tturn out to be). If the Commonwealth agrees<br />
to this, then the Commonwealth does its best to<br />
borrow that amount of money. But if it does not, it<br />
finds the short fall. In my own time as Prime Minister,<br />
we have, over a period of years, found hundreds<br />
of millions out of revenue to make up the short fall,<br />
because at a time when there was a powerful inflationary<br />
movement and the loan market was<br />
obviously very sick, we might borrow 180rn. one year<br />
and find ourselves, involved in .; 200m. by a form of<br />
underwriting of the States works programme. Thanks<br />
to stability in costs and prices ( and we have had a<br />
good deal of that in the last five years) the loan<br />
market has been very healthy, and still remains firn;<br />
but the whole of the proceeds of the loan market go<br />
to the States works programme and the Commonwealth<br />
does not get anything. I am not complainibg<br />
about that. The only time I want to complain is<br />
when somebody comes along and says that on the<br />
proper basis of accotuntancy you ought to be spending<br />
on your works programme only the proceeds of loans.<br />
But if we did, then I dto not know what would happen<br />
to the State works programme. This is not a matter<br />
of theory this is just a matter of simple, practical<br />
hard facts. The truth is that today and, as far as I<br />
know, for years to come, the Commonwealth, if it<br />
wants the States to have the necessary financial pr'ovision<br />
to do their works programmes, accepts the<br />
responsibility ( always an unpopular one) of carrying<br />
its own works programme on the Budget. Nothing<br />
would suit me better than to be able to transfer the<br />
1200m. of Commonwealth wvorks onto some<br />
mysterious Loan account, so that I could reduce taxes<br />
with not very mtuch trouble, but the facts are to the<br />
contrary. That is one thing I described as a fallacy<br />
the fallacy of carrying the Commonwealth works<br />
on reventue when they ought to be carried on loans.<br />
" There is a second fallacy, and that is that in 1963-<br />
4, the financial year just ended, all that happened in Australia was that some or all of the ground lost in<br />
196 1-62 was recovered. This is not true. The fact is<br />
that between 1960, the boom year, and the year just<br />
closed the change in Australia has been phenomenal.<br />
I do not like to hear people crying down their own<br />
country or saying that we have not developed, or saying<br />
that we have not improved our productivity. Between<br />
what was a boom year in 1960 and the last<br />
financial year, the improvement in Australian condisions<br />
has been, I think, quite phenomenal. To me<br />
this is a proof that you can have stability, as we have<br />
had over that period in the consumer price index,<br />
and still have the most astonishing growth. Between<br />
these periods it is idle to say that there has been no<br />
improvement in productivity. Public employment<br />
employment by government between 1959-60 and<br />
1963-64 rose by 85 thousands. In case somebody says:<br />
' There you are this is the preference given ' to the<br />
public sector!', I hasten to add that private employment<br />
rose by 249,000. 1 think that it is not bad to<br />
have an increase in that period of time of about 335<br />
thousand people in employment in Australia. Wage<br />
and salary earnings rose by 27% in that time, and<br />
the total increase in the consumer price index over<br />
the whole of this period was only about Wage<br />
and salary earnings rose by 27%, average male earnings<br />
rose by 16%, farm income ( for reasons partly<br />
attributable to the yield of farmers and scientific<br />
improvement, and partly due to seasons and partly<br />
clue to the recovery of overseas markets) rose by 46%.<br />
Gross national product rose by 27%, all this was between<br />
1959-60 and 1963-4. These I think are very<br />
stimulating figures. In terms of quantity, steel produiction<br />
rose by 25% electricity by cement by<br />
28% 7, and so on. As for motor vehicles I very well<br />
remember that after the " little budget" something<br />
happened to motor car production. About 18 months<br />
ago we had one of our conferences with the Chamber<br />
of Automotive Industries, and the estimates that were<br />
given of the optimum that was being looked for was<br />
358,000 vehicles each year. ' Well in 1960, in this<br />
boom period, there were 295,000 vehicles and this<br />
year 400,000. My young colleague, Leslie Bury, Minister<br />
for Housing, would be able to recall that in 1959-<br />
60 ( the then record year) the number of houses and<br />
flats commenced was 91,000 and in 1963-4 they were<br />
107,000. Is this the year of gloom does this make<br />
peop~ le feel that there is some pess imism does this<br />
make anybody feel that all that has happened is that<br />
we have somewhat recovered the ground that was lost<br />
in 1961-62? With great respect, that is just absurd.<br />
This country is going forward in the most remarkable<br />
fashion. Savings bank deposits in Australia since 1960<br />
have increased by œ 715m., on average for each man,<br />
woman and child from œ 148 to œ 200. Another point<br />
I want to make is this: nothing will matter so much<br />
in the next fiv'e years as a feeling of pride and confidence<br />
and enthusiasm among our own people. If<br />
p~ eople are going around crying poor mouth, that is<br />
the surest way I have ever heard to bring about some<br />
recession. " There is another fallacy, which is: that expenditure<br />
October, 1964. </p>
<p>always goes up in the public sector, but what about<br />
the private sector. I am no great lover of economists<br />
I read them but I don't love them. They have a<br />
certain jargon no people have done more harm to<br />
the purity of English than the economists. One of<br />
these things is that they divide all expenditure on<br />
the capital side into the public sector and the private<br />
sector. Does this mean that the public sector is going<br />
to do what the stupid politicians want to do to please<br />
their constituents, and that the private sector is the<br />
health giving investment for private business? Nobody<br />
is a greater believer than I am in the fact that<br />
private enterprise, and the spirit of adventure, and<br />
the spirit of youth, are the driving forces in this country<br />
( or in any other). But as I look over the field of<br />
expenditure in the public sector I venture to say that,<br />
for the most part, there would have been no private<br />
development at all but for the expenditure in the<br />
public sector.<br />
" Let me give you an example or two. Take the<br />
Snowy Mountains Scheme. There expenditure would<br />
be getting near 12O0m. ( and it is * all out of revenue<br />
except for a little loan from the World Bank) and by<br />
the time it is finished, on the present plans, it will be<br />
about 14O0m. What is it for? Quite true, it will produce<br />
some electric power and light for the capita]<br />
territory; quite true it will produce some for governmental<br />
services* in N. S. W. and Victoria, but overwhelmingly<br />
on the power side it will provide power<br />
for industry in N. S. W. and Victoria and not provide<br />
it at extortionate rates, because the whole object<br />
is to produce power at cost, not to make a profit. The<br />
Commonwealth will never make a shilling profit out<br />
of the Snowy, and as'time goes on the cost of power<br />
will be, of course, a diminishing factor. This means<br />
that there will be hundreds and hundreds of industries<br />
in Australia which will be assured of electric<br />
power and light who might not have been able to get<br />
it but. for the operation of the Snowy. In short, this<br />
is primarily a powerful contribution to private. enterprise.<br />
There is* the other aspect of it. The storage of<br />
water in the Snowy Scheme is going to produce irrigation<br />
right down the Valley of the Murrumbidgee<br />
and the Murray which will put thousands of people<br />
on to irrigated farms and those are p~ rivate people,<br />
who want to develop their own production. Therefore<br />
I think I might be. as right as a politician is<br />
expected to be if I say that 90%, of the expenditure<br />
on the Snowy, and the dams, and the later reticuilation,<br />
will be in aid of private enterprise in Australia.<br />
if that is so what is the use of saying less in the public<br />
sector and more in the private sector. Let us. on the<br />
contrary, try to think of it as something that comes<br />
in aid of both, and in partictular in aid of private<br />
industry. I believe that it is in the encouragement of<br />
private enterprise, in putting at the elbow of the private<br />
enterprise the kind of resources that it needs,<br />
that the whole future of this country depends.<br />
" I have mentioned the Snowy, I could equally mention,<br />
for example, the'standardisation of the railway<br />
between Kalgoorlie and Perth and Kwinana. This goes into the item expenditure in the public sector,<br />
and yet what is it? There they have great deposits of<br />
iron ore, and a great steel company has said: if we<br />
can have that iron ore hauled along this long route<br />
in up-to-date rolling stock on an up-to-date railway<br />
line we can establish an iron and steel industry at<br />
Kwinana in Western Australia. This is a magnificent<br />
conception, and this is a conception of private enterprise.<br />
So the -Commonwealth has undertaken great<br />
financial responsibilty; it is all put down to the public<br />
sector in this rather artificial division, but only to a<br />
tiny p) ossible fraction does it have some effect on the<br />
Commonwealth's own interest in a railway line. Primarily<br />
it will open uip a new world for private enterprise<br />
in Western Australia. The moment they have<br />
an iron and steel industry, all the ancilliary industries<br />
will begin to expand. It is -quite likely that in<br />
Kwinana and Perth and Fremantle you will have the<br />
kind of development that you see here in Newcastle<br />
and Wollongong. This is, I think, tremendous and<br />
imaginative. " We will be spending an enormous amount of<br />
money this year on beef roads in the North, so that<br />
there may be -an encouragement to people who are<br />
growing cattle there, and to enable them to -bring<br />
them to market in good condition and at the right<br />
time. " I could go on for a long while, with all sorts of<br />
examples of that kind. I must confess that if I were<br />
in charge of somne great business enterprise I would<br />
want nothing more than to-know if I expanded my<br />
business I would see the housing, the roads, the transport,<br />
the light and power, andi so on, provided.<br />
All this adds up to this: just as, when I was a boy,<br />
there was a power of energy and enthusiasm wasted<br />
on whether You were a free trader, or a protectionist,<br />
so there may be too much wastage today on some<br />
alleged conflict between business and government.' I<br />
CIO hope that we will not fall into that error too much.<br />
Business and government are in the same cause. We<br />
will occasionally disagree, but aboOe all things w . e<br />
mu1Lst'at all times seek to understand each other' and<br />
to co-operate with each other. I know of no s ingle<br />
economic factor in the country which p) roduces an<br />
irresolvable difference between the man who is doing<br />
the work in the market place, and in the facto * ry, and<br />
the man looking after the broad principles of governmnent<br />
in Canberra ( or wherever it may be). This is a<br />
co-operative Government. XWe have done a little<br />
perhaps not enough in the way of having consultations<br />
with p~ eople in industry. I venture, as years<br />
go on, we will have more and more of this. As years<br />
go on, wve will hav'e more and more p~ eople in politics<br />
struggling to understand the problems of the businessman<br />
and, what is equally important, we will have<br />
more and more businessmen struggling to understand<br />
the problems of politics. But it is not enough to say<br />
what is the use of going to the politicians because the . y<br />
do not understand our problems. The politicians are<br />
strangely human people. Frequently you do not know<br />
the problems that come to the government, with not<br />
only its responsibility to individuals, but responsibility<br />
October, -1964. </p>
<p>for the great movements of international scale, which<br />
can never be solved on a sectional basis, responsibility<br />
for international -financial movements, which<br />
always involve domestic budgeting policy in this<br />
country itself.<br />
" We do not know enough about each other. I have<br />
never assumed to tell any man of business how he<br />
ought to run his business because I have had a sneaking<br />
idea that, nine times out of ten, he knows more<br />
about it than I do. Let us get over this rather childish<br />
differentiation. Let us understand that we are all adult<br />
people and we are all patriots, and want to do the<br />
best thing for our country, which quite permits doing<br />
the best thing for our company or for our own selves.<br />
Let us be patriots, and the right way to be a patriot<br />
is to get to understand what the other man is doing,<br />
and to see how far, in co-operation, we can achieve<br />
the greatest degree of growth with the greatest ever<br />
achievable degree of stabilty in our monetary system<br />
that form of stability which means so much."<br />
The vote of thanks to the Prime Minister was proposed<br />
by Mr. W. W. Pettingell, Vice-President of<br />
who spoke as follows.<br />
" Tonight I feel that we have been reminded that<br />
this relationship, which we have at some time entered<br />
into, is as yet hand-in-hand and possibly ! has not been<br />
consummated by that more respectable relationship<br />
of marriage. But you and I, as practicing marriages<br />
in various aspects of industry, do not achieve the<br />
eminence of many economists who have a more vocal<br />
approach to the problem. I am sure you will agree<br />
with me that the Prime Minister has pointed to that<br />
hand-in-hand relationship, which implies at least<br />
some medium of understanding, and an effort to<br />
uinderstand the problems of the other, at least to<br />
bring about a more happy state in the future. I<br />
think you and I have indicated the fact that this<br />
country has an enornous potential.<br />
" Tonight, we have here a group of the elder statesmen<br />
of industry in New South Wailes, and, tlhink,<br />
in Australia, and some of the younger men who in<br />
the course of time will take over the task and leave<br />
their imprint on the future history of this country.<br />
They look to the future as one of wonderful challenge.<br />
We have under our feet a country rich in resources,<br />
as yet largely unscratched; one which lends<br />
itself to an extensive application of knowledge, of<br />
capital, and of endeavour, with the richness of reward<br />
which will follow the application of, at least, those<br />
three resources. Undoubtedly we who practise management<br />
of our business concerns should, in the interests<br />
of this wounderful country of ours and the people<br />
who will follow on, apply ourselves more to the<br />
understanding of the problems which lie ahead of us.<br />
X\: e know that we are a country wide open to exploitation,<br />
in the full sense, by the resources of knowledge<br />
and capital that exist in different parts of the world.<br />
We know that there are tremendous problems of<br />
policy and principle and practice which derive from<br />
this overall task. But this tremendous challenge, I<br />
feel, in the course of time, we can hand on to those<br />
that follow us with a great deal of confidence and pride in what they might achieve. Tonight I think<br />
you have given us a very great stimulus in thinking,<br />
and one which we will take with us and pass on to<br />
those who share the responsibilities with us."<br />
The vote'of thanks was seconded by Mr. R. G. C.<br />
Parry-Okeden, whose remarks are summarised as<br />
follow. " Apart from thanking you for talking to us, and all<br />
of us enjoy listening to you, I want to say just one<br />
thing. You are, to my knowledge, the first Prime<br />
Minister who has recognised that industry exists to<br />
the extent of making a Ministry of Industry. We are<br />
grateful to you for that. We have suggested for some<br />
time, both this Association and other special groups,<br />
that there should be such an establishment created in<br />
Canberra. We only pray to you that you appoint to<br />
it the very best of your permanent staff that you can<br />
find. You do not need me to tell you that you have<br />
a wealth of talent in your public service at Canberra<br />
to draw from. Thank you very much indeed, Sir, for<br />
yet another of your wonderful speeches."<br />
TOURISM INVESTMENT<br />
A. I. D. A.' s Director recently returned from a holiday<br />
tour of Central Australia, Arnhem Land, and the<br />
Kimberley and Pilbara Districts of Western Australia.<br />
Some aspects of the vast economic development potential<br />
of the area will be discussed in later issues of<br />
" Director Reports."<br />
Apart from those aspects, however, these areas contain<br />
some of the most fascinating, colourful, impressive<br />
and distinctive scenic attractions to be found anywhere<br />
in the world.<br />
Alice Springs and its surrounding districts are probably<br />
the best known, ( both in Australia and overseas)<br />
and understandably so Ayers Rock is not only<br />
unique geologically but its particular connection with<br />
aboriginal legends and beliefs are a source of absorbing<br />
interest. The beautiful Stanley Chasm ( 45 miles<br />
from Alice Springs) is no less rewarding to the tourist<br />
although less widely known.<br />
There is the remarkable Gorge area around Wittenoom<br />
( where blue asbestos is mined) Dale Gorge,<br />
Yampire Gorge, Wittenoom Gorge, Joffre Falls, etc.,<br />
to name a few -where climate and scenery combine<br />
to provide ideal conditions for tourism.<br />
The Kimberley/ Pilbara districts of Western Australia<br />
contain some of the oldest known land areas in<br />
the world, where centuries of erosion by wind and<br />
water have reshaped the surface contours and left<br />
only the bare bones of a stony country, compensated<br />
by the beautiful colourings of deep mauves and<br />
purples, sun-bright yellows, heliotrope and vivid reds<br />
and ochres.<br />
All these and many other areas provide attractions<br />
which could form the basis of a valuable tourist trade,<br />
October, 1964. </p>
<p>both Australian and overseas. At present, however,<br />
this is only an unexploited potential. Facilities in<br />
most areas are primitive if any exist at all. Accommodation<br />
at Alice Springs and Darwin is available in<br />
reasonable quality and quantity, and Wittenoom has<br />
a modern comfortable hotel. Apart from these, however,<br />
the standards of service and accommodation are<br />
poor, and certainly not adequate to attract visitors<br />
even if they were prepared for some lack of amenities.<br />
it is important to these areas that adequate tourist.<br />
facilities be provided. Unless people can be induced<br />
to visit and see for themselves the great potential<br />
which exists, then development will be retarded and<br />
opportunities lost.<br />
New hotels, motels and other tourist facilties must<br />
be provided before tourism can be actively promoted.<br />
One of the major problems, which emerged from the<br />
Director's discussions with the W. A. Tourist Department<br />
and the Licensing Court, is an acute shortage<br />
of long-term finance. It is suggested that a special<br />
fund, along the lines of the Development Fund,<br />
should be established to make long-term loans ( say<br />
to 20 years) to people willing to develop tourist<br />
facilities in these remote areas. Unless Australia makes<br />
a positive effort to develop these resources, overseas<br />
interests will step in.<br />
The National Travel Association has estimated that<br />
overseas tourists will spend nearly œ 30m. in Australia<br />
during the current financial year. The exploitation<br />
of the unique attractions of the north and north-west<br />
of Australia could attract more overseas travellers, as<br />
well as tourists and business men from within Australia,<br />
and could help quicken the pace of development<br />
in these areas. OPPORTUNITIES<br />
BELL BAY/ GEORGETOWN, TASMANIA<br />
This is the first of a series of brief articles A. I. D. A.<br />
intends to publish to draw attention to the need for<br />
a better balance between light and heavy industry,<br />
and male and female employing industry, in specific<br />
areas around Australia. Suich areas offer an opportunity<br />
to lighter industries, particularly those employing<br />
a predominantly female workforce, to establish<br />
themselves where all necessary facilities power,<br />
water, transp~ ort, etc. are readily available and, as<br />
well, a stable, btmt at present idle, supply of labour.<br />
Bell Bay and its " dormitory" town Georgetown are<br />
Situated approximately 40 miles north of Launceston<br />
on the estuary of the Tamar River.<br />
The total resident population of the Bell Bay/<br />
Georgetown area is approximately 4,000 persons. The number of males and females in<br />
groups are the working-age<br />

Total 15-65 years 1,415 1,098<br />
This means there is a total potential workforce of<br />
2,513 persons.<br />
Industries already operating in the area employ a<br />
total of 1,155 persons, mostly males. The major enterprise<br />
is the aluminium smelting p~ lant of Comalco<br />
Industries Pty. Ltd. at Bell Bay. Approximate<br />
employment in each of the existing establishments,<br />
and their activities, are<br />

Other local activities retail shops and other services<br />
would employ a further small number of the<br />
available workforce, but there still remains a large<br />
potential, particularly to employ female labour.<br />
Bell Bay has good deep-water harbour facilities,<br />
and is one of the terminals for the " Bass Trader," the<br />
" roll-on, roll-off" vessel operated by the Australian<br />
National Line, which carries cargo and loaded cornmercial<br />
vehicles between Melbourne and Tasmania,<br />
going direct to and from Bell Bay one clay each<br />
week. Other freight ships also use this harbour, of<br />
course. There is a fine bitumen highway between<br />
Bell Bay/ Georgetown and Launceston ( and from<br />
there to the rest of Tasmania~ s cities).<br />
There is plenty of good, fiat industrial land available<br />
in the area, in a pleasant natural rural setting.<br />
Tasmania is the only State in Australia where power<br />
comes from hyclro-electric generation exclusively. It<br />
offers the cheapest cost for industrial uses of electricity<br />
in any State, which, in itself, provides a major<br />
attraction to many industries. The most recent of<br />
many new hydro-electric stations completed in recent<br />
October, 1964. </p>
<p>years is the Poatina Scheme which is located not far<br />
from Launceston.<br />
In the Bell Bay area two of Australia's largest companies<br />
Conzinc Rio-Tinto ( through Comalco) and<br />
B. H. P. ( through Temco) and particularly the<br />
former provide employment opportunities, in a<br />
variety of occupations, for a large proportion of the<br />
local male population. Their workers have the opportunity<br />
to make a permanent career with a major Australia<br />
company, which is conducive to a stable, good<br />
standard type of family population.<br />
However, the lack of lighter industries capable of<br />
employing the female population of the area is a sad<br />
waste of one of Australia's most valuable resources<br />
people. The Bell Bay/ Georgetown area, therefore, offers<br />
labour, land, a good deep water harbour, cheap electricity,<br />
reasonable proximity to one of the major<br />
mainland markets ( Melbourne), good transport facilities<br />
and, for a suitable user industry, primary aluminum<br />
( ingot, billet and rolling block) in the immediate<br />
vicinity as a raw material.<br />
RESEARCH<br />
At the invitation of the Minister for Supply, the<br />
Hon. Allen Fairhall, a party of A. I. D. A.' s Council<br />
members visited the Woomera Rocket Range<br />
and Tracking Station and the Weapons Research<br />
Estabishment at Salisbury, South Australia, in September.<br />
The Woomer-a Range is being used as an international<br />
testing station by European Launcher<br />
Development Association in which<br />
seven countries, including England, France and Germany<br />
are combining their research and development<br />
work in the field of guided missiles. The use of<br />
Woomera, manned entirely by Australian technicians,<br />
also brings Australia into this combined operation.<br />
There is no cost to Australia involved in this aspect<br />
of Woomera's activities and in addition Australia will<br />
share in the benefits of any experiments. Currently<br />
a " Blue Streak" Rocket is being assembled for firing.<br />
The American " Black Knight" has also been tested at<br />
Woomera. Of course, Australia's own equipment,<br />
which is of the highest technical quality, is also tested<br />
here. The tracking station at Woomera is one of three<br />
which have been set up in Australia in co-operation<br />
with the government of the United States of America.<br />
Of the other two tricking stations one is located near<br />
Canberra and one in the North West of Western Australia.<br />
All are manned by Australians, but the cost<br />
of building and. maintaining them is borne by the<br />
U. S. A.<br />
The Weapons-Research Establishment at Salisbury<br />
is the working organisation behind Woomera, where<br />
the actual research and experimental and development<br />
work is carried out. Discussions were held in<br />
both places with the administrative and technical leaders, including aspects in which industry could<br />
participate, particularly in the field of applied<br />
research. Both industry and defence in Australia<br />
could benefit from the application in industry of the<br />
productive techniques and knowledge developed at<br />
Salisbury and Woomera.<br />
Australian defence establishments under the control<br />
of the Department of Supply have been responsible<br />
for the export of equipment and know-how to a value<br />
of œ 14m. over the past six years. The Minister for<br />
Supply recently announced the following highlights<br />
of his Department's recent export activities:<br />
The sale of the Jindivik pilotless target aircraft<br />
to Britain, Sweden and U. S. A.<br />
The sale of the Malkara ground-to-ground<br />
guided weapon to Britain.<br />
A wide range of engineering products, technical<br />
processes and developments.<br />
The expenditure being undertaken by the Government<br />
for research into defence problems in certainly<br />
paying dividends. Similar profits could be expected<br />
from the promotion of research in industry.<br />
A. I. D. A. SCIENCE TEACHERS' AWARD<br />
The A. I. D. A. Award for 1964 in Queensland was<br />
recently presented to the Rev. Bro. R. M. Slattery,<br />
B. Sc., Senior Science and<br />
Mathematics Master, St. Joseph's College, Brisbane.<br />
Extracts from Bro. Slattery's citation are given below.<br />
" As in previous years the Referees found the task<br />
of comparing the contributions to science teaching by<br />
the nominees a very difficult one indeed. It was pleasing<br />
to find that the number of nominations had grown<br />
considerably this year and that the standard of the<br />
nominees was uniformly high.<br />
" Although the task of selection was a difficult one,<br />
the Referees were completely confident with their<br />
final decision. It was clear that Reverend Brother<br />
Slattery possessed the qualifications sought after to a<br />
pre-eminent degree.<br />
" Brother Slattery received primary education from<br />
the Sisters of St. Joseph at St. Therese's School,<br />
Lakemba, a suburb of Sydney, and his secondary education<br />
from the Christian Brothers at St. Patrick's<br />
College, Strathfield. On completion of his schooling<br />
he worked as a chemist for Lever Brothers in their<br />
research laboratory and while there studied for a<br />
chemical Engineering Diploma at the Sydney Technical<br />
College.<br />
" Joining the Religious Order of the Christian<br />
Brotheri, Brother Slattery was enabled to complete. a<br />
Science Degree at the University of Sydney. Majoring<br />
in Inorganic Chemistry, he obtained, in 1954, two<br />
High Distinctions in final year chemistry and First<br />
Place in the University. Brother Slattery was awarded<br />
the Walter Burfitt Memorial Bursary, but decided<br />
not to continue studies for a higher degree, although<br />
October, 1964. </p>
<p>the path was left: open to him to do-so by his<br />
superiors in the Order.<br />
" Shortly after completing his degree, Brother Slatter)<br />
was admitted as an Associate -of the. Royal Australia ii<br />
Chemical Institute and he also became a member oi<br />
the New South Wales Science Treachers' Association.<br />
In 1955, he was posted to St. Joseph's College, Rockhampton,<br />
where he taught Chemistry, Physics and<br />
Mathematics at all levels up to and including Senior,<br />
During the two years at Rockhampton he joined tlit<br />
Queensland Science Teachers' Association and th(<br />
Catholic Colleges Science Teachers' Association.<br />
" Early in 1957, Brother Slattery was transferred tc<br />
St. Edmund's College, Canberra, and ther<br />
filled the triple post of Senior Science Master, Senioi<br />
Mathematics Master, and Sports Master. Brothei<br />
Slattery helped to establish a branch of the New Souti<br />
Wales Science Teachers' Association in the Australiar<br />
Capital Territory. This soon became the A. C. T. S. T. A<br />
and Brother Slattery was its first Vice-President. Ii<br />
1959 he represented the Association -at thi<br />
A. N. Z. A. A. S. conference in Perth and presented<br />
paper in a Symposium on . the teaching of Physics<br />
With the financial support of C lectures wern<br />
also given at Melbourne, Adelaide, Kalgoorlie an(<br />
Albury. " In 1960, Brother Slattery was posted to St. Joseph'<br />
College, Gregory Terrace. Rejoining the Scienc,<br />
Teachers' Association of Queensland he became<br />
member of the Executive in 1961 and 1962, whils<br />
he has also been. President of the Catholic College<br />
Science Teachers' Association since 1962. A membe<br />
of the Chemistry Sub-committee of the Board of Pos<br />
Primary Studies for the last two years he helped asses<br />
junior Physics papers in 1961. and 1962, Senio<br />
Chemistry and Senior Mathematics II papers in 1962<br />
and is this year one of the three people associate<br />
with the setting of junior Chemistry papers.<br />

" It was the nature and scope of this in-service training<br />
work that perhaps impressed the Referees most<br />
of all, for it was clear that Brother Slattery not only<br />
bore the brunt of much of the organisation it required<br />
but that he was also responsible for a good deal of<br />
the initiative in establishing the Seminars in the first<br />
place. He has surely set an excellent example of<br />
devotion. to the cause of Science teaching in one of<br />
the most valuable of all ways; by helping to<br />
improve standards of teaching throughout a great<br />

" Reports of Brother Slattery's classroom teaching<br />
that had come to the attention of members of the<br />
Committee indicate that he is first-rate in every way.<br />
r He played an important role in the design of th~ e new<br />
1 Senior laboratories recently opened at St. Joseph's<br />
I College and. they reflect his obvious enthusiasms for<br />
individual practical work, his knowledge of good<br />
laboratory facilities, and his skill as a constructor of<br />
apparatus. " Modest as he is, anyone who knows Brother Slattery<br />
must soon be aware that his thoughts are never<br />
S far away from science teaching and its cause, not only<br />
I on behalf of his own pupils, nor even those of the<br />
Catholic schools, but for all learning science in schools<br />

r in its " Economic News" a method of overcoming the<br />
" labour shortage in Switzerland. " Three large firms<br />
I in Basel appear to have found a solution worthy of<br />
notice: they have formed a pool which ensures their<br />

small orders. At present this pool makes available to<br />
I its clientele a painter, two electricians, a carpenter,<br />
S two sanitary installation fitters and an experienced<br />
