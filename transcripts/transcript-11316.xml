    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Jim; to Mr Morgan, Brigadier Garland, other great</p>
<p> contributors to the Red Cross throughout Australia, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>The Red Cross organisation is, of course, one of the most esteemed</p>
<p> and widely recognised organisations anywhere in the world. It's</p>
<p> one of those remarkable groups that has survived through the years</p>
<p> with its reputation for integrity, the relief of human suffering and</p>
<p> service to mankind irrespective of colour, race, creed or nationality</p>
<p> or political commitment. It's one of those organisations that</p>
<p> has survived through the years in a quite remarkable way. And although</p>
<p> historically the Red Cross was associated with the relief of suffering</p>
<p> in wartime, over time it has broadened its horizons. And the way in</p>
<p> which it contributes to making the lives of Australians a little easier</p>
<p> and a little happier when that is needed, in a quite remarkably diverse</p>
<p> manner of activities, is one of its hallmarks as we come towards the</p>
<p> end of this millennium. Perhaps not many Australians would realise</p>
<p> that the Red Cross played one of the major relief roles during the</p>
<p> Katherine floods of last year.</p>
<p>The Red Cross provides a much needed early morning wake-up, hello</p>
<p> call to thousands of Australians, to elderly Australians around the</p>
<p> country. And as we begin this year marking the contribution of older</p>
<p> Australians to our society we will discover, as we go through that</p>
<p> commemoration, we will discover the contribution that the Red Cross</p>
<p> has made in so many different ways.</p>
<p>It is an organisation that has moved with the times. It has retained</p>
<p> that remarkably stark and remarkably impressive symbol of the Red</p>
<p> Cross on a white background and it is one of the most easily recognisable</p>
<p> symbols anywhere in the world. But it's also an organisation,</p>
<p> as well as fulfilling its traditional function and its traditional</p>
<p> role, has moved with the times and is providing services. And the</p>
<p> fact that it will be able to gather 100,000 volunteers on the Red</p>
<p> Cross Calling day which, as Jim said, first started in 1950, raised</p>
<p> $5 million last year and the goal is to raise $6.3 million this year.</p>
<p> And that will be raised if once again Australians respond, as they</p>
<p> always have, in that great spirit of volunteerism, which is a characteristic</p>
<p> of Australian societies.</p>
<p>One of the goals that the Government has is to build what I call a</p>
<p> social coalition. Governments can't do everything on their own.</p>
<p> The volunteer sector, like the Red Cross, can't do everything</p>
<p> on its own. And individuals often need help in order to look after</p>
<p> themselves and to look after their families and others they love.</p>
<p> And the way in which you can achieve the goals that we all have is</p>
<p> through a social coalition - with the Government doing its part, the</p>
<p> volunteer sector doing its part, with the Government supporting the</p>
<p> volunteer sector but also recognising that in a number of areas the</p>
<p> volunteer sector is far better equipped to help those who need assistance</p>
<p> within our community than are any agencies of the Government, and</p>
<p> also to draw very heavily upon the commitment of individual Australians</p>
<p> who want in their own many ways to make a contribution towards helping</p>
<p> people.</p>
<p>Economic circumstances in Australia at the present time are good and</p>
<p> many Australians are doing extremely well. Unemployment is a little</p>
<p> lower than it used to be and the economic outlook for this country</p>
<p> is very powerful compared with the rest of the world. But that is</p>
<p> all the more reason why we should focus on those in our community</p>
<p> who are not as well off. No matter how strong our national economy</p>
<p> may be, no matter how well we may be doing in the eyes of the world,</p>
<p> no matter how strong may be the economic outlook for Australia, we</p>
<p> must remember that there are amongst us fellow Australians who are</p>
<p> not doing as well. And Red Cross is directed in its own different</p>
<p> ways towards relieving that suffering and that is why I commend very</p>
<p> warmly to all of you and to all of the Australian people a generous-hearted</p>
<p> personal response to the Red Cross Calling Appeal this year.</p>
<p>I want to conclude my remarks today by expressing the thanks of the</p>
<p> Government to those thousands of Red Cross volunteers throughout the</p>
<p> Australian community. I marvel at the willingness of so many Australians</p>
<p> in an unsung, unheralded, often unremarked way to contribute to helping</p>
<p> their fellow countrymen and women.</p>
<p>It's an organisation that is very well and efficiently run. It's</p>
<p> an organisation which depends on an ongoing reputation for integrity</p>
<p> and efficiency, a reputation that it's maintained through the</p>
<p> decades since its formation in the 19th century. And here</p>
<p> in Australia it's run by a man for whom I have a very warm personal</p>
<p> regard, Jim Carlton, who runs the organisation very efficiently at</p>
<p> a national secretariat level. But, very important, as he would acknowledge,</p>
<p> it survives and thrives because of the volunteer efforts of thousands</p>
<p> of Australians and it is those Australians to whom I express my particular</p>
<p> thanks today. It is those people that have kept the Red Cross going</p>
<p> and will maintain its momentum years into the future. I hope the appeal</p>
<p> is successful. I hope the target of $6.3 million is not only reached</p>
<p> but is exceeded. And I thank all of you for your tremendous contribution</p>
<p> to such a worthy and magnificent cause. Thank you.</p>
