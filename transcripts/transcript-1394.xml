FOR PRESS P. M. No. 90/ 1966<br />
DEATH OF SIR JOHN ALLISON<br />
Tribute by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Sir John Allison had for many years been a leading<br />
figure in the life of Australia.<br />
He had given much valuable voluntary service to the<br />
Australian UJovernment and had been prominent in an honorary<br />
capacity in many fields of community service.<br />
He was a warm, strong personality, and his practical<br />
good sense made him a natural leader among men. His views and<br />
guidance were frequently sought and valued.<br />
His passing is a loss to Australia, and his many<br />
friends and I include Mrs. Holt and myself in their number<br />
will mourn him and will feel deep sympathy for Lady Allison<br />
and his sorrowing family.<br />
CAN 3E RU<br />
21st September, 1966. </p>
