SPEECH BY THlE PRIM MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
TfHE HONOURABLE R. J. L. HAWKK, AC WP<br />
KCONCEI C CLUB LUNCHEON<br />
CHICAGO 20 JUNK 198<br />
Seventy six years ago, a young Chicago architect etablished<br />
a permanent link between this city and Australia.<br />
Walter Burley Griffin was selected as the winner of an<br />
international competition to design a now national capital<br />
for Australia.<br />
His design became the blueprint for the City of Canberra a<br />
design which, ap any visitor to Canberra appreciates, is<br />
still remarkably modern, efficient and attractive.<br />
His insight into what Ausitralians looked for and needed in a<br />
national capital symbolises the easy understanding that<br />
exiats at a broader level between our two countries.<br />
The foundo. rs of both Australia and the United States sealed<br />
their political federation in physical form, by creating a<br />
now city away from existing commercial and political centres.<br />
Yet I wall understand that not all the voices of influence<br />
within either of our countries originate from inside the<br />
Washington beltway or in Canberra; far from it.<br />
In Australia, we know Chicago as a world centre of learning,<br />
of literature, of culture, a city associated with such names<br />
as John Dewey, Enrico Ferti, Soul Bellow; the city of the Art<br />
Institute and the Chicago Symphony, which we had the enormous<br />
pleasure of velcoming In Australia earlier this year, as a<br />
major part of our Bicentennial.<br />
Chicago lieu at the boundary of what one author has described<br />
as the North American breadbasket and the North American<br />
foundry.<br />
We aliso know Chicago as a focal-point of the international<br />
economy, North Akmerica's greatest transportation hub with<br />
links out to world trading and financial centres. I had<br />
vivid proof of its importance this morning when I visited the<br />
Mercantile Exchange. 7 3 24 </p>
<p>But, ladien and gentlemen, I have not come half way around<br />
the world morely to exchange pleasantries. Nor. I trust,<br />
have you done me the honor of your presence just to see<br />
whether the Prime Minister of Crocodile Dundee country has a<br />
bi. 9 knife In his belt.<br />
I do however come with a weapon. It is the weapon of logic,<br />
honed by the concern of my fellow Australians at the damage<br />
being done to them and to the prospects for global economic<br />
security by the irrationality of the policies of the world's<br />
major playors.<br />
Like Nick Dundee I produce the weapon, not to hurt, but to<br />
provido underitanding of what is enlightened self-interest.<br />
And I want to say to you at the outset, dogmatically and<br />
without any cloying sense of false modesty on Australia's<br />
part, that what we are urging upon others we have practised<br />
ourselves. I will come to that later.<br />
And so I focus today on the threat to prosperity in<br />
Chicago, in Australia and in the rest of the world posed by<br />
protectionism. I believe that this audience, In this city, is well attuned<br />
to the urgent need for the liberalisation of global trade.<br />
Reviewing the events of the past two years I am compelled to<br />
conclude that the progress that has been made in trade<br />
liberalination has been welcome, but does not go nearly far<br />
enough. Andt not ali the signs are encouraging ones.<br />
The continuing threat to free and fair world trade comes from<br />
three main sources the irresponsible agricultural policies<br />
of the Ruropoan Community and America's reaction to those<br />
policies; Japn's tardiness in opening its markets; and the<br />
largo trade imbalances between the major economies<br />
underpinned to a great extent by continuing United States<br />
budget deficits.<br />
Lot me deal with e ach of these in turn.<br />
There should be no need to remind an audience in this city,<br />
so closely linked to the great grain belt of the American<br />
mid-west, of the enormous damage done to farmers including<br />
Australian and American farmers by the Common Agricultural<br />
Policy of the European Community.<br />
It has distorted economic choices, depressed prices and<br />
forced unnevssary and painful adjustment from otherwise<br />
efficient irmerm.<br />
The CA L hms allowed the EC, once the world's largest importer<br />
of temporcto agricultural products, to become the world a<br />
largent enporter. 7 325 </p>
<p>3.<br />
That flies in the face of any principle of comparative<br />
advantage o~ r officiancy.<br />
The distortions caused by-the CAP and national agricultural<br />
supports do not end with the agricultural sector itself.<br />
Manufacturing output, exports and employment have suffered.<br />
Recent research for the Canberra-based Centre for<br />
International Economics indicates that three million Jobs in<br />
Europe could be created if the IC wer, to liberaline<br />
agriculture, European manufacturing output would increase by<br />
an estimated one per cent and manufacturing export. to the<br />
rest of the w~ orld would increase by around five per cent.<br />
Sadly, the Europeans are only now beginning to appreciate<br />
fully the economic futility of their agricultural policies.<br />
They can no longer ignore it. The staggering cost of<br />
propping up inefficient agriculture is at the heart of the<br />
European Community's budgetary crisis.<br />
It has been argued within the United States that this dawning<br />
realisation on the part of the Europeans about the<br />
self-defeating nature of the CAP has been prompted in part by<br />
the tough American decision to fight their subsidies with"<br />
your own suboidies.<br />
There may be an element of truth in that proposition. I<br />
suppose the Europeans must seriously wonder whether they will<br />
ultimately come out on top in this game of international<br />
economic chicken.<br />
But the reality is that in the end they will not win and<br />
America won't either. The only winner will be economic<br />
irrntionality, the staggering dimensions of which are<br />
illustrated by the OECD estimate that the farm policies of<br />
the European Community# Japan and the United States have cost<br />
them $ 200 billion per annum over the last few years.<br />
And it In a gross simplification to suggest that America's<br />
farm policies have been purely retaliatory, impacting only on<br />
tho Europennn.<br />
Wheat Is a prime example. In the past three years during<br />
ehich the United States Export Enhancement Program, or EEP,<br />
has been operating, America's share of world " heat trade has<br />
risen from 29 per cent to 43 per cent. The EC's share has<br />
fallen only a little, from 17 per cent to 14 per cent, but<br />
Australia's ahare has* slumped from 20 per cent to 12 per<br />
cent. </p>
<p>In other worda, fair trading nations are getting caught in<br />
the subuidies cross-fire. The effect, if not the intent# of<br />
the trsa-Atlantic subsidies war Is thet the RC and the<br />
United Statos are carving up world markets between then,<br />
squeozing out efficient producers like Australia through the<br />
application of massive subsidies.<br />
Just a few weeks ago we were very disappointed to note that<br />
the US Adminintration has turned up the heat a little more.<br />
Under your tthnat support programs, the proportion of arable<br />
wheat land to bo kept idle will be reduced from 27.5 per cent<br />
to 10 per cont.<br />
We k~ now Amorican grain farmers are facing a very severe<br />
drought. But this decision will add substantially to world<br />
wheat production excess wheat which America can only add to<br />
world over-supply and further depress world prices.<br />
Australian wheat farmers, who themselves know all too well<br />
the hardship of drought, are nevertheless angry at what they<br />
see as a now, a~ nd heavily subsidised, grab for world wheat<br />
markets. This action sets back the gradual but real progress<br />
Australia and other fair trading nations have made over the<br />
past couple of years in encouraging America to wind back its<br />
farn nuhriidy programs.<br />
The anger of Aitrallan farmers would be exacerbated and<br />
the Australian Govarnment. would endorse their attitude if<br />
any decision tiers, taken by the United States to dump<br />
REP-obalisond tihsat onto the Indonesian market. Indonesia<br />
and thn Asin-Pacific region in general ar* relatively free of<br />
suboidJed whant and Australia opposes any development which<br />
would threaten the freedom of those markets.<br />
The same attitude is engendered by America's increasingly<br />
restrictive sugar quota arrangement. which have cut<br />
Australiata exports to the U. S. by around 90 per cent since<br />
1981. At a time when Australia has lifted its embargo on<br />
sugar igportm, America is putting the shutters up on its<br />
markot, V" find ourselves in the sad position whero<br />
Australia le considering GATT action against the United<br />
states~. Thooo ref.-ont American decisions have cast a shadow over the<br />
AdminIrstration s generally strong anti-protectionist stance. 7 3 27 </p>
<p>Now x emphao ins that it gives me nio pleasure to come here to<br />
criticise Amierican actions. Our total relationship is in<br />
excollent shape. It is precisely because I want to keep It<br />
that way that I an unwilling to sweep areas of real<br />
difficulty under the carpet.<br />
There is r~ third major participant in the corruption of world<br />
agricultur&amp; d markets. Japan's market practices have been<br />
very destructive for agriculture. Whether it be rice, where<br />
Japan's dome~ stic price is eight times world prices; beef,<br />
where protection is as high as 210 per cent; sugar, where<br />
import demand Is artificially suppressed by over 50 per cent;<br />
or almost any other agricultural commodity, Japan's policies<br />
are simply Inconsistent with the sort of open markets it so<br />
eagerly and so justifiably seeks for its own exports.<br />
Thankfully we have seen signs of change in the last year or<br />
so Japan'@ s imports are up over 20 per cent in two years. I<br />
wholeheartedly welcome that,<br />
Anid I. can only express my hope and expectation that Japano<br />
the United States and Australia will soon conclude<br />
satilsfactory arrangements for the non-discriminatory<br />
liberaleation of the Japanese beef market.<br />
Let no also be clear that I do not see all these issues of<br />
protectionilsn solely in terms of agricultural trade nor,<br />
Indeed, riolely in terms of the policies and practices of the<br />
znajor econopiic powers.<br />
Some oft the omaller and neover industrialised players also<br />
haea role to play. And liberalisation of world trade in<br />
services and more traditional manufactures needs to be<br />
addressed seriously by everybody.<br />
Australia has made, and will continue to make, these points<br />
forcefully in the GATT and in other forums.<br />
Haoving made those fairly blunt comments about protectionism,<br />
I cannot ignore the contribution to economic uncertainty and<br />
trade restrictions made by the budget imbalances of the<br />
United States -and, more broadly, the lack of harmony in the<br />
fiscal policies of the three largest economies the Us,<br />
Japan and West Germany.<br />
It has to bo acknowledged that in the U. S. and elsewhere<br />
there have ' been significant steps in the right direction<br />
recently, especially In reducing the United States fiscal<br />
deficit. Itndeed, tharg are also signs of some progress in paring back,<br />
gradually, the U. S. current account deficit with<br />
spectacular growth in exports of manufactures. 7,3 2 8 </p>
<p>Thin demonmtrates the inherent flexibility of the United<br />
states economy. But I acknowledge that it also demonstrates<br />
the pwver of President Reagan's policies to enhance this<br />
f1exibility, policies which have become a major though<br />
intangible oxport of this country.<br />
Neverthelens the fact Is that problems remain.<br />
Persistent and large international debtors, much as the<br />
United States now is, must continually meet market tests of<br />
performance. Living standards cannot be supported<br />
indefinitoly on encessive overseas borrowings.<br />
The longer the underlying fiscal imbalance persists, the<br />
longer will the trade deficit remain unsustainably high, the<br />
faster will debt pile up and the more vulnerable will the<br />
economy become to sudden shifts in interest rates or the<br />
exchange rate.<br />
That is why further fiscal reform, especially in the United<br />
States, qooe hand in hand with restoring stability to the<br />
global trading system.<br />
The post-war prospority of the US, as of the rest of us, has<br />
grown in large part because of the existence of a vigorous,<br />
vomputitivo and free trading system.<br />
The Amerioan people were very much the authors and sponsors<br />
of tat nysto.<br />
It would be curious logic indeed to seek to close down<br />
through groater protectionism, the trading system which has<br />
worked so powerfully to build post-war prosperity. Nor would<br />
it be nonvible to thwart that progress through inappropriate<br />
fiacal policios.<br />
I readily admit that I would be open to the charge of<br />
hypocrisy end double standards if we In Australia were not<br />
moving decisively to put our own house in order. But we are.<br />
For five yers we have relentlessly pursued an economic<br />
agonda designed to make our economy more stable, more<br />
resilient and more outward looking more prepared to take on<br />
the beast i! the world, and win.<br />
Our major macro-economic objective during our time in office<br />
has boon stabilising our foreign debt and balancing our<br />
budyot. We in Australia faced the prospect in 1983 of a Federal<br />
deficit of about 5 per cent of Gross Domestic Product just<br />
a littlo below the comparable ratio for the United States.<br />
For the fivecnl year just ending, we initially announced a<br />
balancod budget, but it is now clear that we will achieve a<br />
significant 8urplus the first in 35 years. 73 2 </p>
<p>Last month we announced further expenditure reduction<br />
Innuret Whieh will hring PAdAral expenditure down by<br />
per cent in lAVU-BV in real terms. This will represent the<br />
third consecutive yor of real decline and will underpin a<br />
fiscal surplus in the order of I per cent of GDP.<br />
That achievement was not easy. It involved tough decisions.<br />
It meant taking away Government benefits and subsidies from<br />
those who did not really need then something traditionally<br />
regarded as political suicide. It has involved sacrifice for<br />
all Australians and, for many, real hardship.<br />
It aloo required the courage to crack down on tax avoidance<br />
over the protests of those who had to start paying their full<br />
fare for the first time.<br />
But we recognised there was no acceptable alternative to<br />
exercising unprecedented fiscal restraint. The only<br />
alternative would have been for our creditors to impose their<br />
ovn brand of adjustment on us, in a way which did not protect<br />
the dioadvantaged, which sacrificed jobs, which wreaked<br />
receRsion on our country.<br />
Our approach, and its emphasis on the partnership between the<br />
Government and the trade union movement, was praised recently<br />
by the managing director of the International Monetary Fund,<br />
Michel Camdessus, aa a model for other nations. In<br />
partivclar it has allowed us to generate employment growth<br />
over the past five years at more than twice the OECD average<br />
rnte.<br />
Of course fiscal adjustment is not sufficient in itself. For<br />
the longer term we have needed to transform a highly<br />
protected, nnd consequently weak manufacturing sector into a<br />
world competitive one; and to ensure that our agricultural<br />
and mining Industries, already among the most efficient in<br />
the world, withstand the current problems in the world<br />
trading systen.<br />
Important steps have been floating the Australian dollar,<br />
deregulating the Australian financial and aviation systems,<br />
steps to reform work practices and our education and training<br />
systems, liberalising foreign investment requirements and<br />
relaxing export controls on a range of minerals.<br />
Last month the Government set down a blueprint of further<br />
steps, for the next four years in Australia which will<br />
continue and broaden the thrust of these reforms. In<br />
particular there will be substantial cuts in tariffs over the<br />
noxt four years, targeted at those areas which are the most<br />
highly protected.<br />
These measures will see Australia's average effective tariff<br />
ret. fall by over 30 per cent to 14 per cent in just four<br />
yearm., 73 3 </p>
<p>Virtually all1 of Australia's assistance to Industry is<br />
provided through tariffs. our protection is transparent and<br />
declIning in marked contrast to that of our trading partners:<br />
these cuts mro real cuts in protection.<br />
Theo reforn may appear surprising at a time when world<br />
uuarkats are getting tougher and the game seems rougher thAn<br />
ovs' r. But they are, in fact, the only rational and sensible<br />
response to a tougher world trading environment. It is only<br />
by rorogniolng and responding to market conditions, however<br />
tough or impporently unfair, that business or nations can stay<br />
com~ ptitivo and s~ tay prosperous.<br />
I don't make these points to create the impression that<br />
Atistralians are complacent about the future. We know that<br />
the job in not yet completed * and we are determined to see<br />
it through.<br />
My point todiny is that others in the world economy need also<br />
to recogniso that there in much to be done urgently.<br />
Avid no it is to the future that I now turn.<br />
Two sets of decisions over the next 12 months or so will<br />
largely detormine whether the relative economic prosperity of<br />
the Inst f( orty years can be sustained. These are the<br />
dauldsonp to be taken on the US budget deficit by the<br />
inv~ oming Adninistration and the nov Congress and the<br />
doiniohn3 znftn n! t the forthcoming aid-term review of the<br />
t1Jrtngu&amp; y Round of Hultilatermil Trade Negotiation.<br />
Political honeymoons are a wonderful thing. They usually<br />
oilly com~ e around once. They are to be used, not squandered.<br />
Wboevor wins In November will face the need to resolve the<br />
problem~ of Aorican budgetary deficits decisively and<br />
comiprehoel3voly. At the very time when the Big Seven leaders are meeting in<br />
Toranto, i7 rhould stress that the task of adjustment does not<br />
fall on kRmarican shoulders alone.<br />
All these lenders, including in particular the Japanese and<br />
Hnnt Cernon, have a role to play in securing greater policy<br />
All, too, havo a role to play in maximisinig the chance of<br />
succoss of Lho Uriuguay. Round.<br />
Arguably tho most important event in the last two years<br />
affocting wiorld trading prospects was the successful<br />
Isawichirg of that Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations in<br />
Septemiber 1986. X say ' arguably', because there are<br />
logAtim~ ats grounds for debate as to whether the New Round<br />
will achiove anythIng substantial. 7331 </p>
<p>The success of! the RoUnd Will depend greatly on the outcome<br />
of the mid-term review of negotiations to be held in Montreal<br />
in December.<br />
Success in Montreal would set the scene for the remainder of<br />
the Round and give renewed impetus to and confidence in the<br />
negotiations. But failure to register Paeaningful progress by the and of<br />
this year would seriously diminish the prospect. for genuine<br />
trade liberalisation in the Uruguay Round.<br />
Nowhere In thin truer than in agriculture, where the Cairns<br />
Group which has proven itself a major new force in the<br />
multilateral negotiations is pressing for agreement to the<br />
implementation of reform measures in 1989 and 1990 as a<br />
genuine downpayvment on the final outcome.<br />
The group is currently finaliuing its proposals for action to<br />
be presented to tha Montreal review.<br />
it will be a proposal which will show our determination to<br />
keep up the prossure on the major trading blocs so as to<br />
create a truly f~ ree and fair trading system.<br />
Australia also ottaches priority to several other issues,<br />
including the Imiproved functioning of the GATT system, trade<br />
in tropical produt and trade in services.<br />
Your country comeos to the GATT negotiating table with an<br />
unparalleled rocord of leadership and as the unchallenged<br />
leader of Wastorn nations. Others at the table may appear<br />
intransigent, but where you are prepared to lead, I believe<br />
others will follow.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The United States has a well deserved reputation for world<br />
leadership in oconomic and political arenas. It was American<br />
generosity and leadership which helped war-ravaged countries<br />
after World War 11 to begin their economic recovery and it<br />
was access to the relatively free and open market of the<br />
United States which allowed those and other countries to<br />
develop. The message that I want to put firmly to you and to my other<br />
audiences in the United States this week is that the economic<br />
crisis which wo face today is different but no less important<br />
than it was in that post World War 11 era and requires the<br />
same dedication and leadership.<br />
The United States has a pivotal role to play at-this time and<br />
ag a close friend and ally of the United States we urge you<br />
to exert that laoadership. ~ 3 3,2 </p>
<p>That great post of this city, Carl. Sandburg, referred to<br />
Chicago as the " stormy, husky, brawling, City of the Big<br />
Shoulders". I put my case for economic adjustment confident that America<br />
has shoulders broad enough to take up the burden of economic<br />
adjustment and to meet again the responsibility of global<br />
economic leadership.<br />
Beyond any other major participant you have the record, the<br />
vision, the philosophy, the abundance of talent. All that is<br />
required is the political courage and there, as Australia and<br />
the world looks to you,. I am sure that America will not be<br />
found wanting. </p>
