PRIME MINISTER<br />
2 October 1996 TRANSCRIYPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS THE TO THE CANNING/ SWAN<br />
BREAKF. AST, PERTH<br />
SE O E<br />
Thank you very much Don, to Ricky Johnston and Senator Winston Crane and my State<br />
colleagues, my former Federal colleagues, othcr distinguished guests, ladies and<br />
gentlemen. It's really good to come back to the same place that you visited when we were in a<br />
Opposition. It gives you a sense of the occasion, it gives you a sense that you've achieve<br />
something. There was a big crowd at the breakfast here in the lead up to the election<br />
campaign, there's an even bigger crowd here this morning and that cheers me no end<br />
because of the many miracle results that we had on the 2nd March. The results here in<br />
Western Australia, the fact that we were able to reduce the Labor Party to only three seats<br />
in Western Australia, the fact that we were able finally to win the seat of Canning and I<br />
really do want to congratulate Ricky Johnston for her persistence. PI've got a bit of a soft<br />
spot for people who keep plugging away and I think you did that magnificently. And to<br />
Don who ran a very skillful campaign., I mean just remember the scat of Swan became<br />
too hot for Kim Beazley and he moved to another seat.<br />
And T want to congratulate both of these very fine grass roots campaigners. Yes, 1<br />
remember the afternoon of the 2nd March very well and I'm sonrry in a sense thai the<br />
results on the east coast may have spoilt some of the fun over here but I'm sure it didn't<br />
spoil the fun of the campaign supporters in Canning and Swan in recording such<br />
remarkable wins and it is important to remind ourselves on an occasion like this, to<br />
remind ourselves as to some of the reasons why we won the last election. And there are<br />
T : Bd 81: ZT 96/ 0T/ ZOUWJ xva </p>
<p>many reasons but one of the very important reasons we won the last election is that the<br />
people we de~ eted got sadly out of touch wi th What the Mainstream of the Australia<br />
community was thinking and saying and wanting. They listened too much to the elite<br />
commentators, they listened too little to ordinary Australians. And that lesson carries a<br />
very strong message for us. It carries a firm message that having won Government we<br />
shouldn't assumne that we're going to hang on to it automatically. We shouldn't assume<br />
that because we are now in Government we're somehow or other a cut above thc rest of<br />
the community, we're niot. We're representatives of the commrunity and we are there as a<br />
girt of the Australian people and not as some kind of divine selection process.<br />
And also one of the interesting things as you reflect upon the political scene over the last<br />
few months is that how little somne of our opponents seemed to have leant 1 think we<br />
had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Gareth Evans, yesterday talking abot taxation.<br />
1Je thinks we're undertaxed. I'm certain the battlers in the western suburbs of Sydney in<br />
the scat of Lindsay where there's a by-election on the 19th October are going to really<br />
appreciate being told that they ought to pay more Iax because that is basically what<br />
Gareth Evans is saying and I do think that any senior politician who argues that there is a<br />
strong case as he does for higher taxation is certainly out or contact with the Australian<br />
community. Now I have never argued that governments can deliver things out of thin air, I've never<br />
argued that everything that an electorate asks for or wants can be delivered, it certainly<br />
can't. But we in the Coalition Government do not believe that the path to budget<br />
balances lie in increased levels of taxation. We believe very strongly that the path to<br />
budget balances lies, " s far as possible, in reduced government expenditure. And we<br />
Were able in the first Budget that the Coaltion brought dowzi in 14 years, the first<br />
Coalition Budget since 1982, we were able to announce a program that will in year three<br />
of our term of office return the Federal Government budget to an underlying balance.<br />
And given the very, very substantial level of debt that wve inheited fargrartanw<br />
had been told, that is a remarkable achievement And it has involved taking some<br />
decisions that people don't like. R's involved importantly though taking decisions that<br />
are seen by the community as strong but W~ r. And I would be very happy to see my<br />
Glovernment's handling of the economy as being categorised as strong but fair. That is<br />
what Australians want. T1hey want governiments to strongly address problemrs but they<br />
want governments to address those problems in a fair and an understandable fashion.<br />
The Australian people will accept the necd for change and reform. The Australian<br />
people will accept that there are some burdens to be undertaken and some things they<br />
want to be foregone provided the reason for those changes is explained and provided<br />
those changcs ame implemented Thirly. The main example of this, in Adelaide a couple of<br />
days ago, 1. called in there on the way across to Perth and I met one of Adelaide's wvell<br />
known busincssmnen and he said to me, look theme are a couple of things in that budget<br />
that I didn't like., you did this and you did that and I didn't like that. But he said, I have<br />
written you a letter congratulating you because what you've clone, he said is that you've<br />
z : Bd 8P: ZT 96/ O1/ Ze Wjj Xpa </p>
<p>spread the pain around fairly. And he said, I'll buy that, 1 will accept that. H-e said, that's<br />
we've been wanting for a long time.<br />
B~ ut the other really good thing about the budget is that, and it's representative of what we<br />
have done over the last six or seven months and that is that we have delivered on all of<br />
the core commitments that we made in the election campaign. And don't let any<br />
commentator, don't let any of our political opponents divert you from the -reality that all<br />
of the commitments that were uppermost in people's minds when they voted on the2nd<br />
March, the things they really took account of in a positive sense in voting for us those<br />
commitments have been delivered. Rcmember our commitment about the flamnly tax<br />
package? Every last dollar of that has been delivered. Our commnitment about private<br />
health insurance ta&amp;. rebates, every last dollar had been delivered. Our commitmnent to<br />
give capital gans tax rollover relief to small business, every last dollar delivered. We've<br />
already passed the law to reduce the provisional tax burden on small business by<br />
inillion this financial year. We've implemented our commitment to reduce red-tape on<br />
small business. And I will have a report in six weeks time from the chairman of our<br />
Small tBusiness Deregulation Taskforce explaining how it is that we can reduce the<br />
burden of red-tape on small business by 50 per cent within our first three years of<br />
government. And very importantly for the smiall business commnunity and for Australia generally, we<br />
have delivered on our commitment to change the industrial relations system of this<br />
country towards one based on agreem~ ents at the enterprise level between employers and<br />
employees. You remember what T had to say during the campaign about the unfair<br />
dismissal laws. And that was a rule that was brought in by Laurie Brereton and the<br />
former ILabor Government without warning, without a mandate, without any moral<br />
authority axall. And that particular law in my view did more to intimidate men and<br />
women in small business around Australia from taking on more stalT than just about<br />
anything over the last two or three years. And I lost count of the number of people I met<br />
around Australia, al I over Australia who are in small business and they said it may be all<br />
right for BHfP or CRA or a very large company, if they have an unfair dismissal suit thcy<br />
can accommodate, it they can settle it. B~ ut if I have an unfauir dismissal arguemnent with<br />
one of my three employees and they threaten to take me to court I can't affiord to pay the<br />
$ 20,000 or $ 30,000 to keep the thing out of court. What J won't do, I won't employ them<br />
in the first place so as not to run the risk.<br />
And that is the story that I've found all around Australia. Anid that particular law<br />
delivered covertly without warning, I mnean it is a very, very odd circumbtance isn't it.<br />
Before the 1993 election the Labor Party said nothing about the industrial relations<br />
reforms it ultimately was to make and ytct those industrial relations reformns sailed<br />
through the Senate. We on the other hand laid all of our plans out and we're still in the<br />
process of negotiating them through the upper chamber. But I'm hopeful that those<br />
negotiations have progresd well and we are serious about negotiating with the minor<br />
parties in order to get those reforms and those changes through the Senate because that<br />
industrial -relations law is absolutely fundamental to Austvalia's economic future. It's a<br />
E :-6d 8': ZT 96/@ T/ ZO OJ P<br />
W0JJ Xpa </p>
<p>law that's based on five essential principles. The first of them is that we want to get rid<br />
of Labor's job-destroying unfair dissal law. The second principle is that we're<br />
absolutely committed to voluntary unionism. to a free choice, that men and women in thc<br />
work force should be entitled to join or nor to join a union and not to be persecuted for<br />
the choice that they make to join or not to join.<br />
The third priniciple is that people should have a complete freedom of choice bctwecni<br />
remaining under an industrial award or going into a workplace agreement, negotiated<br />
directly between the employer and the employee with people representing thc employee<br />
if that is the wish of the employee, subject to sonme guaranteed irtinimurn conditions. The<br />
fourth provision is that we should allow the emergence of workplace unions if that is<br />
what people want. People should not only have the right to join a union or not to join a<br />
union, they should also have the right to join whatever type of union they choose. And<br />
finally. we are committed to restoring the secondary boycott prohibitions introduecd by<br />
the Fraser Government in the Trade Practiccs Act in the late 1 970s that have proved so<br />
very effective to curb predatory union conduct, particularly against small businesses.<br />
Now if we can implement thosc five major reforms to Australia's industrial relations<br />
system, it will over a period of timne yield enormous productivity and competition<br />
dividends and it's very, very important that thza reform be implemented and it remains a<br />
core element, ladies and gentlemen, of Au~ stralia's economic future and a core element of<br />
the reformn plans of the Coalition Governmecnt.<br />
Only a couple of weeks ago I was able to undertake my first substantive visit overseas as<br />
Prime Minister of Australia and quite deliberately and not surprisingly, T chose to visit<br />
Indonesia and Japan during that visit, and that visit revealed to nie a number of<br />
iundamentals about Australia's associations with the rest of the world. They revealed,<br />
that visit revealed to me that Australiai is a highly regarded, respected country in the<br />
Asian Pacific region. It revealed to me something thatI already knew and f am sure most<br />
Australians knew, and that is that this country's democratic traditions are understood and<br />
respected in our region. and the proposition, the insulting proposition that in some way<br />
the leaders of those countries would only dcal With one political complexion in the<br />
leadership of Australia was of course an insult not only to their intelligence but also an<br />
insult to the democratic processes of this country.<br />
It is quite plain to mie that the government-, of Indonesia and the governmlent of Japan,<br />
indeed the Governments of all of those nations would not only deal with this Government<br />
in Australia but will deal with it enthusiastically and in a very friendly fashion. And the<br />
l inks that exist between Australia and the Asia Pacific region are links that have been<br />
built over the years by both sides of politics. It's sometimes forgotten that the man who<br />
laid the founidation stone of Australia's economic association with the Asia Pacific region<br />
was John MeF~ wen who was Deputy Prime Minister in the Mcnzics Government in the<br />
1 950s and ho was the driving force, the author, the inspiration behind the Japan-Australia<br />
Trade Agreement of 1957 and negotiating a trade agreement with Japan in 1957 was a far<br />
more challenging political undertaking than negotiating trade agreements these days. and<br />
he faced opposition, Including at the time From the Labor Party yet he laid that important<br />
i' 6 a BP: ZT 96/ 01/ zeo OJ </p>
<p>foundation, and Australia and J apan have forged a remnarkcable economic partership in<br />
this part of the world, a partnership that works very much to the bcnefit and to the credit<br />
of Australia. Japan is our bcst customer. We are one of the few nations in the world<br />
with an extremely healty trade balance with that country arnd it's a relationship that's<br />
very important to Au-. tralia's economic future and itos a relationship that owes a lot to the<br />
far sightedness and the political leadership of a Coalition figure.<br />
B~ ut that is not to deny that over thc years, Labor Party leaders haven't also mnade a<br />
contribution to that process. It is very important and it's going to be a feature of mny<br />
Government that where there are areas of agreement betweeni the Government and the<br />
Opposition, let us not waste time manutacturing false division and false argumecnt. On<br />
the other haad, where there are areas of fundamental disagreement, such as for example<br />
our attitude towards levels of taxation, let us by all means in those areas have very<br />
vigorous argument and very vigorous debate, anid so far as the foreign relations of this<br />
country are concerned, J want to say to you again that our commitment to the economic<br />
and political linkage between Australia and the Asia Pacific region are as strong, that<br />
commitment is as Wtong under the Coalition Government as it ha: s over been in thc past.<br />
and we have moved early in our term of office, including in particular my meeting with<br />
( he ? rmc Ministcr of Malaysia, we moved early in our term or office to reinforce the<br />
importance of those links. But we do that without in any way downplaying or<br />
denigrating or walking away from the associations that we have with other parts of the<br />
world. have said frequently that Australia's foreign policy does not involve a choice between<br />
our history anid our geography. We don't need to shun out European American<br />
associations in order to strengthen our Asia Pacific associations. We can have the lot and<br />
there is no rmaon at all, given the bistory, the culturc, the democratic traditions. the<br />
values and the attitudes of Australia, there is no reason in the world why we can't. In our<br />
early nonths in office wve upgraded the quality of the defence association with the United<br />
and I am happy to say that President Cito wiIb iiigAsrlai<br />
November before going on to the APEC meeting that I will also attend in Manila. Both<br />
of those developments are a reminder of the importance of that association and of course<br />
Lhe asociations that Australia has wi th the nations of E urope ame all around us, and the<br />
preSenice in this very room Of so many people who were boni in the United Kingdom or<br />
other parts of Europe, as well as people from, other parts of the world, from Asia, fromn<br />
the Middle East, is a reminder of the great diversity and the great heritage of this country<br />
in that diversity.<br />
So we arc very much a nation which sees itself as a vibrant, divers part of an<br />
increasingly globalised political entity, an increasingly globalised economy, and it's very<br />
important therefore that we have a government that understands those balances and<br />
understands those linkages, that docs not become obsessed with one or other emphasis in<br />
the area of foreign and international economic relations but sees the opportunities for<br />
trade advantage when they occur and we initend, so far as the conduct of our trade policy<br />
S : Bj 8f': ZT 96/@ r/ Ze </p>
<p>is concerned, to adopt an attitude that is driven ultimately by Australia's national interest<br />
and by absolutely nothing else.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, it is an enorous privilege Lo be the Primec Minister of Australia.<br />
It's an enormous privilege to be part of the first Coalition G3overnment in this country for<br />
13 years. As Liberal Party supporters, you waited a long time. You must have wondered<br />
if it was ever going to come. 16 years between election wins was a pretty extraordinary<br />
period of time and Don mentioned the afternoon of the second of March. I think I've<br />
said to some other Liberal Party audiences around Australia, I was in a high state of<br />
nervous excitement myself on the Second of March as you might imagine, and P've never<br />
quite forgotten, that poor official of the Australian Electoral Commission. We were at the<br />
Intercontinental hotel in Sydney where we had our headquarters and the Electoral<br />
Commission had sent a couple of gwenen along " With their computers and they were all<br />
orn line to get the results as they came in and at a quarter past six I said to him, Have<br />
you got anything?" and he said " No".<br />
TIwenty past six 1 said " Have you got anything?", he said At twenty one past six, I<br />
said " H~ ave you got anythingS?" and he said and at twenty nine past six he said,<br />
"' ve got -something" and he sai'd, " There's been a 15% swing to the Liberal Purny in a<br />
polling booth in Portland", I said, " Gee, 15%" and I said, " How many on the roll", and<br />
hc said So T said to Grahame. Morris who was beside m~ e, I said " We've won,<br />
we've won"~.<br />
HeI said " No cairn down, calm down". As it sort of turned out, it wao~' t bad. I mean. it<br />
wasn't quite as good as that everywhere. Portland is a little town near Lithgow in New<br />
South Wales. But it was a great day, it was a great night and it was a great reward for all<br />
of those supporters of the Party around Australia like yourselves who have worked<br />
tirelessly, who'd kept the faith, who supported us when you probably thought we weren't<br />
worth supporting. You must have wondered on occasions if we could ever get it right<br />
YOU must have, you stop nodding your head, and you must have thought to yourself, gee,<br />
they've run out of feet to shoot which basically is very understandable. But finally it all<br />
came together and it did demonstrate that if you stick at things, if you listen to people.<br />
But you also stick to certain Aundamental attitudes and if you go back over the years you<br />
can find a consistency between what we took to the last election and what a number of<br />
people, including myself have advocated in areas such as family policy.; industrial<br />
relations reform and small business. And if there are three things that I've tried to make<br />
a mark on as* rar as policy is concerned iD thc political debate in this country o-vcr the<br />
years it has been in those three areas. And I wouldi ' ike at the end of miy three years in<br />
Government, first three years I hope, never take it for granted. One term at a time, that's<br />
my motto, and you work on it. And I would like at the end of that term, for people to<br />
have a look at what we have achieved in those areas of doing something to strenghe<br />
small businesses. The aggregate impact of our policies regarding the family and also of<br />
course what we have done in industrial relations reform. if we can gat those things right<br />
then we have a real prospect of seeing somec improvement in the omployinont area.<br />
9 : Bj 8P: ZT 96/@ l/ ze WW0Jjj Xva </p>
<p>They're of course not the only issues that the Government but they are three things that<br />
arc very important to the type of Party we arc, the Liberal Party and they're very<br />
important to the kind of society we are and they're very important values to me and to<br />
other leader of thc government and of the Coalition.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for the tremendous help that you gave to both<br />
Don and to Ricky in the campaign. Thank you for giving us two energetic, grass roots<br />
members who will fight fotbr their electorates, who will understand and support the need<br />
for certain decisions that have a short tnrm difficulty but a long term benefit and a long<br />
term gain. It is a great experience to be in Government. It's an enormous privilege.<br />
We've waited a long timc. We've worked very hard to get it and we don't intend to let<br />
you down. Thank you.<br />
ends<br />
