_,, AUS rRALA.<br />
FOR PRESS 19 OCTOBER 1976<br />
FLOODING IN QUEANBEYAN AND THE A. C. T.<br />
The Prime Minister announced this morning that the Commonwealth<br />
would join in providing financial assistance for the<br />
relief of immediate personal hardship and distress to<br />
persons affected by the flooding.<br />
It would also consider sympathetically any requests from<br />
the New South Wales Government to assist on other agreed<br />
relief and restoration measures.<br />
" It is too early to know the extent of assistance that<br />
would be required" I, Mr Fraser said.<br />
The Prime Minister extended his sympathy to the people<br />
affected by the flooding in New South Wales and the Australian<br />
Capital Territory.<br />
Mr Fraser paid tribute to the government and non-government<br />
organiisations in New South Wales and the A. C. T. which<br />
acted so promptly and effectively to evacuate people from<br />
danger, and to minimise the risks in the areas which<br />
were inundated or liable to be inundated. The flood<br />
warning system in operation was particularly effective.<br />
The work of volunteers and the offers of aid and<br />
emergency accommodation from many citizens in both of the<br />
areas principally involved was also deeply appreciated.<br />
The main burden of organising relief operations lay with<br />
the police and the State and Territory Emergency Services,<br />
assisted by government and non-government organisations.<br />
