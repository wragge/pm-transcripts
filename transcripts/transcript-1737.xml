GOVERNMENT MEASURES TO ASSIST INDUSTRY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt_<br />
This week the Federal Government has met representatives<br />
of the manufacturing and rural Industries of Australia to discuss the<br />
immediate and long term effects of the British devaluation of the Pound<br />
Sterling and the Australian decision to maintain the value of the Dollar.<br />
General assessments by inustry were closely in line<br />
with those made by the Government and detailed consideration began of<br />
the special problems of certain industries.<br />
I made it clear when the Government took its decision on<br />
devaluation, and again this week, that when current surveys were complete,<br />
the Governent would proceed to give appropriate assistance in areas of<br />
industry which have suffered directly. Surveys are In progress and will<br />
continue for some time, b ut firm decisions have now b een taken on some<br />
aspects. There are matters of urgency to some industries,<br />
particularly rural industrie s. They fall into two categories<br />
Immediate problems as the result of the devaluation of<br />
British and other currencies.<br />
Long-term fundamental problems of rural Industries.<br />
Cabinet therefore decided yesterday on certain measures<br />
to help the rural industries likely to be affected immediately and also to<br />
initiate a full examination of basic problems by the relevant Ministers and<br />
by special high-level committees. The decisions are summarised below.<br />
A Devaluation Reporting Committee of three senior<br />
officials under the chairmanship of the Secretary of the Department of<br />
Primary Industry ( Mr A. C. B. Maiden) will begin work at once. The other<br />
members will Be Sir Alan Westerman and Mr M. W. O'Donnell.<br />
This Committee will report direct to the Cabinet through<br />
the Prime Minister. It will consider the immediate problems of devaluation<br />
in the rural Industries by examining losses from devaluation considered<br />
to be demonstrable and unavoidable, and make recommendations for action<br />
regarding them. A special enquiry into the fundamental problems of rural<br />
industries, Involving consideration of the reconstruction of certain<br />
industries, will be made by the Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr Anthony).<br />
Mr Anthony will consult with the appropriate State<br />
Ministers and with the leaders of rural Industries. He will then bring<br />
specific proposals before Cabinet. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Government has, for some time, had under consideration<br />
a restructuring of the dairy Industry-and -proposals are now ready for<br />
Cabinet. Consideration will be given to applying the principles on which these<br />
proposals are based to certain other rural industries.<br />
The Wheat Board has already suffered Identifiable losses<br />
of something like $ 30 million on outstanding Sterling contracts as a direct<br />
result of British devaluation. Insurance cover against devaluation was sought<br />
by the Wheat Board but was not available.<br />
The Government will reimburse the Wheat Board for this<br />
loss less the amount of the premiums which would have been payable had<br />
insurance cover been available.<br />
. Other marketing authorities which were not able to take<br />
out full cover against devaluation with the Reserve Bank, and which have<br />
suffered loss as a result, will be eligible for assistance in the same way after<br />
the facts have been established by the Devaluation Reporting Conmidttee.<br />
There Is some urgency for the canned fruit industry because<br />
of the imminent ripening of fruit In the forthcoming harvest. Some 65 per cent<br />
of canned fruit exports go to Britain. Cabinet decided that the Government<br />
would assist the canned fruit Industry and details of this assistance will be<br />
announced by the Minister for Trade and Industry.<br />
The assistance to be announced by the Minister will be<br />
conditional on the industry working out urgently long-term arrangements to<br />
put before the Government for the rationalisation of the marketing of canned<br />
fruits and for the stabilisation of the industry on a more satisfactory longterm<br />
basis. It will apply to the very exceptional circumstances of this<br />
industry In relation to the 1968 pack.<br />
The manufacturing industries In both their domestic and<br />
export operations have also been the subject of special consideration. Four<br />
measures have been approved by Cabinet<br />
The Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Austmlia, by<br />
agreement with the Government, has already begun to set<br />
up industry panels. These panels will cover all industries<br />
exposed to the risk of direct disability arising from devaluation<br />
abroad. They will be associated with the Department of Trade<br />
and Industry and will examine problems in individual<br />
industries with a view to advising the Government through the<br />
Minister for Trade and Industry.<br />
( it) The existing Special Advisory Authority for manufacturing<br />
Industries will be available to deal with emergency cases.<br />
The Authority will, if found necessary, be streamlined and<br />
strengthened. This Authority has power to act at once to<br />
recommend additional protection to meet any abnormal<br />
competition from imports which could Include that resulting<br />
from the devaluation of other currencies. Action taken by the<br />
Authority Is subject to review by the Tariff Board. </p>
<p>q ( iii) A committee-will be set up, consisting of Government<br />
officials and representatives of -manufacturing<br />
industry and commerce, to Investigate export<br />
problems which individual firms and Industries<br />
might bring to It as a result of devaluation.<br />
Reports of this committee will, if necessary, be<br />
brought before a committee of the Cabinet,<br />
comprising the Minister for Trade and Industry,<br />
the Treasurer and the Minister for Labour and<br />
National Service.<br />
( Iv) A new five-year Pay-roll Tax Export Incentive scheme<br />
has also been approved. The Export Development<br />
Council had offered advice on this matter. The new<br />
scheme will replace the existing one when it expires<br />
next year. The scheme will be more appropriate to<br />
cu rrent and prospective circumstances In encouraging<br />
exports of manufactures.<br />
The Market Development Allowance income<br />
tax rebate will be set at 42.5 cents in the dollar,<br />
compared with 37.5 cents In the dollar under the<br />
existing scheme. These new arrangements will begin on<br />
1st July, 1968. Further details wiill. be<br />
announced by the Minister for Trade and Industry.<br />
