AU,; TH A LA.,<br />
PRM PAINSTER<br />
FOR P-RE-SS 14 April 1977<br />
ADDRESS TO rT'HE WORLD INSTITUTE OF PLLU MINIUM PRODUCERS SYDNEY<br />
It is a great pleasure to address this Conference ofL the<br />
international PrIlmary A] A~ 1niani ilrStitUte. The bauxitealumina<br />
-aluminium indtistry has played a -major parct in<br />
Au3t-ralia's development since the early 1960' s.<br />
Its growth shows what can be achieved wi ' th high qrade miinerals<br />
which are am~ nable to large scale capital investment.<br />
Total dnvestrient in m~ ning, r-efining and smelting now ainount to<br />
two thousand million dollaxrs. And in a very short span<br />
of time, Australia has emerged as tl-eworld's leading supp-ler of<br />
bauaxite and alumina, the ultimate soarce of aDP. olimatCely One<br />
quarter of the world's 3 alu-iiiumv.<br />
The benefits of the industry to Australia can be readily ueen<br />
in the enor-mous grow-th of exports. In 1976 the industry':<br />
total exports exceeded six hundlred million dollars, about<br />
fifteen percent of the exports of primary mineral products.<br />
After actually falling in 1975 the demand for your industr'S<br />
p~ c : s s now growing again relatively rapidly. This is<br />
not surprising since the aluminium iiidus-try has a mrarked record<br />
of technological success, in developing new products, andi<br />
challenging traditional materials in established markets.<br />
This is clearly visible in industries such as buildin~ g and<br />
cxcnsru'c-icn, transport consume. r and domestic products.<br />
Increasing iriportince is heing place on non~-<br />
technical considerations tzhe availabilitv of raw imterials<br />
the neeJ to conserve non replenishable erierqy resources and<br />
tbe importance of environmental considerations.<br />
Alunminium would seem to be at the forefront of materials<br />
considexced compatible with the needs of a concoerned society.<br />
Major new investmne~ t is to be made by t~ rie alluminium indust~ ry in<br />
Aus~ raia. There are prospects of over *$ 800 million of investmen<br />
in mining, refingin an9d melting. Whe-l the projects are<br />
completed the invastment may total $ 1,000 million, and<br />
further large investments in smelting axe probable.<br />
These investments show your industry's coinfidence in Aust-' alia<br />
and in the renewed growth of the Australian econom,, y. .!. hey will<br />
conttribute significantly to our economic groWThn. A 3er-ious<br />
q~ uestion which~ now ariseF, is whether we n~ oidrot e look-Ln<br />
to the indusitry to put more emphasis c-i cÃ±' pndin( q alumiiu-m<br />
production a96 e&gt;. port, rather than aluaitina. </p>
<p>My reason f or saying tL. his is that Australia is not only rich in<br />
bauxite. We have also large resources of: coal, we have major<br />
n; aturaj gas reserves-In short, compared with the lonq ru-n<br />
production of aluminium from new smelters, in some major<br />
industrial countrie5. There i3 potE~ ntial for Australia to<br />
iic-~ s more competitive having reasonable security and<br />
long term supplies of enerqy sore. aning as a long<br />
term business, reqluires a lozng term; sale -_ nvirorme-at -in<br />
which there can be confidence, Profitability arnd predictability<br />
' This Government's policies are desigend to provide these<br />
conditions. Since being elected, we have b ) rought all the arms<br />
o f policy to beaz on the task of defeating inflation, and<br />
securing the basis for a sustained econlomic recovery. The? inflat<br />
which ccarxred between 1973 and 1975 impinged harshly on business<br />
profitability. It did not just erode profits in isola-ted<br />
seg-ments of industry. It caused a general erosion of the Private<br />
sector's ability to secure reasonable profits.<br />
We have sought to bzring down. the rate of inflation and establish<br />
the environment i. which the private sector could grow.<br />
We have brougk. t government spending under control We have<br />
pursued a responsible monetary policy. We have now an<br />
appropriate external policy. And we hav; e conzistently argued<br />
for wage rcstraint before the Arbitxation Commission.<br />
Teecan be no doubt that we have had consi-derable success<br />
in pursuing our goals. There ca-n be no doubt that there has<br />
been a steady reduction in the rate of inflaticn. All reli-~ ble.<br />
indicators show this.<br />
Acccmpzanying the do-wnward -trend of inflation wag a mnovement back<br />
towards the long term normal levels of the Profit. share an. 2 the<br />
household saving ratio. The figu-res Filso sho%.; that there<br />
was a -return to economic growth. Unamployrment, however, is<br />
till -too high. But the only way to get a real reduction<br />
in un-employment and a return to employment 6pportanities is<br />
by. fruther reducing inflation.<br />
During 1977 the Government wilj* continue to use all arms off<br />
policy to further reduce the rate of infl~ ation and to sustain<br />
economi~ c recovery.<br />
Yesterday, a major contribution was made to the fight against<br />
Inflation and unemployment. The heads of the Cowionwealth<br />
and state governments unanimously called for a three month<br />
halt in price and income increases. We are all calling on all<br />
employers and all professional organisations not to increase the<br />
prices of their goods and services. We are all calling on. the<br />
ACTO and other employee organisations to voluntarily accept<br />
a three month pause from wage increases.<br />
Subsequently, we will approach the Arbitration Convnission and<br />
tne PJT for the implementation of the general halt. All<br />
governments will use their influence and their powers to achieve<br />
a successful ouitcome. During the pause no government will incrai<br />
Jits own charges. </p>

TIe heads of goverr uent have reflected this agreement.<br />
' hey, will sustain it with all their moral force and authiority.<br />
The~ re is no thought of compulsion there is a need for a<br />

13ut an over emphasis on min-ute points of detail runs the<br />
danger of completely mnissing the significance of this i-whole plan.<br />
W4hen the Premiers anid I met on Wednesday, we all saw a<br />
1p. rices/ incojne halt as a unique opportunity to brea-k thbakof<br />
* nflation. Criticism of some aspects of thi6 approach<br />
helps no one. What the present situation reqjuires Is Z"<br />
, wholehearted commitment to the cleax and simple prinrciple-of<br />
a three month pause from all 4ustralians. if tUhat commnitment<br />

All Australians have a great real to gain,-if o: pectations ( About<br />

Many of the . immnense mining projects carrently under way in<br />
A,, istralia or in prospect depend on rulti-nationaJ. corporations'<br />
zilhto marshall finance and other lc2sources.<br />
One of the challenges to multi-nationals is to undexstand the<br />
qxeatcr sense of nationality Iwhich has developed in Australia<br />
and other countries. And to take positive steps to see that<br />
national objectives and the interests of multi-national companie~ s<br />
are harmonised to the greatest ex'tent possible<br />
our foreiQn investment quidellines protect Australia's<br />
national -interests and they benefit imulti-national companies.<br />
The Auistralian Government has also associated itself with -the<br />
OECD dolclaration on in tern at iona 1 invest-Ment4 and riulti-national<br />
c--nterprise., This OECD code Of good conduct for multi-nation-11s<br />

It is essential that companies abide by the spirit of the<br />

that multi-nationals have made good corporate citizens in<br />
Australia. Sometimes it is not widely known that a<br />
pariticular company is a rulti-national because the board is<br />
dominated by Australians, and the chairma-n is Australin.<br />
An Au. ralian ' is better placed to criticise Government policy<br />
awit. hout arousinig resentment. A foreigner who heads an overseas<br />
0c-rpmy in Australia is oftc-,-placed in a difficult position.<br />
-1 also beLIieve that Australi-ans should be given a fair chance<br />
() f-iin to the highest positions in overseas companies'<br />
in-ternational operations and head offices. Top) managers of<br />
international companies should be as multi-national as their<br />
Another practical Step to sell shares in the<br />
lo,.-al Subsidiaries -to Australian investors. And this is being<br />
uu. iz~ by all the major aluminim companies.<br />
I w-ould not wish to be taken cis suggesting that only large multinational<br />
companies have a sign ificn role to play in t-he mining<br />

vital1 role, particuarly in the discovery stages, and in<br />
