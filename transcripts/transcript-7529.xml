PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
13 MARCH 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: Before I make myself available for questions I wanted<br />
to refer to the unfolding yet again of the chaos in the<br />
Opposition when it comes to the question of unfolding<br />
policy. You would've seen the program on Sunday where the<br />
Shadow Minister for Finance referred to the idea of giving<br />
taxing powers back to the States. That provoked this quite<br />
remarkable statement by the Leader of the opposition this<br />
morning repudiating the Shadow Minister for Finance. He<br />
said we don't have any policy proposal of that kind on our<br />
agenda, in fact I had a lengthy talk about the whole range<br />
of economic policy on Thursday and I can tell you that that<br />
subject wasn't mentioned. Well he says it's not on their<br />
agenda. I've indicated that I've taken a very considerable<br />
interest in their policy document ' Future Directions' which<br />
is increasingly and properly being tagged around this place<br />
as ' Futile Diversions'. That's what the agenda is he says<br />
for the future. What does it have to say about this issue?<br />
Page 91 ' In principle the Government with which the power<br />
resides should have the responsibility for raising the<br />
revenue required to exercise that power so that it's fully<br />
accountable. In other words, in ' Future Directions', the<br />
agenda document according to the Leader of the opposition,<br />
what Professor Hewson, the Shadow Minister for Finance said<br />
on Sunday, directly, squarely in line with the agenda. Then<br />
when the Shadow minister comes out and talks according to<br />
the agenda he is then repudiated by the Leader of the<br />
opposition which is just further indication of the absolute<br />
hopelessness of the Opposition. They cannot get to a<br />
position of policy at all. It's very interesting also I<br />
suggest to note what Professor Hewson had to say on the<br />
question of fiscal policy. He says, he accuses us in the<br />
last budget of increasing expenditures. As we know, we've<br />
had three years in a row of real cuts. We've had three<br />
successive years up to and including this one, 0.3, 3.1, 1.8<br />
cuts in real terms. But he says we've had expenditures.<br />
Now I want you to understand the implications of that. What<br />
Professor Hewson therefore is talking about is cuts. There<br />
has to be actual nominal cuts, nominal cuts, because where<br />
there've been nominal increases in expenditure you tax us<br />
for that although they have * been such a low order that it<br />
means real reductions, which is the only concept that one<br />
can talk about. He's saying there's been real increases and<br />
that's not what would be the case under them. So that means<br />
in terms of the sort of inflation outlook that he's talking </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM ( cont): about that they are talking therefore about<br />
expenditure cuts to get a reduction in nominal terms. That<br />
will be real reductions of the order of real reductions<br />
in government expenditure of the order of or over $ 6<br />
billion. Now Professor Hewson undertook as you know on<br />
Sunday, after we had brought in our April statement, under<br />
persistent questioning he said they will in fact detail the<br />
cuts they're going to make. Now on his own statement<br />
therefore where you're talking about nominal cuts, not just<br />
real cuts, they're going to have to nominate the cuts in<br />
government expenditure of the order of $ 6 billion. That's<br />
something that not only will we in Government be looking<br />
forward to with very great eager anticipation to see their<br />
detail in the $ 6 billion of expenditure cuts, but even more<br />
importantly so will the Australian public.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's exceptional about the State Government<br />
having responsibility for their own taxes<br />
PM: Well we take the view that the conduct of economic<br />
policy in the federation is difficult given the breakup of<br />
constitutional powers that does in fact exist and one of the<br />
features that's made it in that constitutional context<br />
easier to conduct overall macroeconomic policy is the<br />
fact that the Federal Government has a monopoly of power in<br />
the important areas of taxation. It would obviously make<br />
the conduct of economic policy more difficult.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why have you waited six years to fix it?<br />
PM: The situation is quite obvious. The States have not<br />
taken up the opportunity that was there under that<br />
legislation. Our opponents are now saying, some part of<br />
them are saying, and their agenda is saying that well,<br />
let's put it on the table and they can make up their mind as<br />
to whether they will, in the Parliament, take a specific<br />
position which will be consistent with what they say in<br />
their document. They've put it on the agenda, we'll<br />
accommodate them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Another point which Dr Hewson made at the<br />
weekend was he said that they would put greater priority on<br />
privatisation and the contracting out of services. What's<br />
your response to that?<br />
PM: As you know the question of the future of public assets<br />
is being considered within the Party. Those processes will<br />
continue and we'll have further discussions about it. It's<br />
a subject that's on the agenda, we've put it on the agenda.<br />
JOURNALIST: What will you say in the next election campaign<br />
about your attitude to getting private equity into the<br />
airlines given that you won't have a final Party policy<br />
position by that time? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PM: I noticed your piece which said we won't. I don't<br />
accept that you're right.<br />
JOURNALIST: How can you have that if there's not an ALP<br />
Conference before the election?<br />
PM: I'm simply saying to you I don't accept that your<br />
analysis is correct. That<br />
JOURNALIST: You're saying there may be a Conference?<br />
PM: There could be.<br />
JOURNALIST: After the 1988 Labor Conference, you said then<br />
on the last day that you thought there was still a real<br />
possibility the policy on privatisation could be changed<br />
Sbefore the next election. Are you still standing by that<br />
position? PM: It's a possibility. It follows from the answer I've<br />
just given.<br />
JOURNALIST: How confident are you<br />
PM: I'm not putting degrees of confidence on it, I'm simply<br />
saying that the processes are underway in the Party,<br />
considering it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think you can persuade the Party on this<br />
issue? PM: I've not involved myself in a process of persuasion.<br />
We've established a committee process and it's appropriate<br />
that that should be done because after all this is a matter<br />
of long term policy and there are considerations validly to<br />
be put on both sides of the argument. It's not a black and<br />
white case. It should be analysed. I'm quite content with<br />
the way those processes are going.<br />
JOURNALIST: But hasn't this committee met only once or<br />
twice since the Conference?<br />
PM: I think that is the case but that doesn't mean it can't<br />
meet more frequently in the future.<br />
JOURNALIST: Conference not a postal ballot you're<br />
talking about?<br />
PM: I don't intend to go any further than saying that I<br />
believe that it is possible that before the next election<br />
the processes could be followed through which would enable<br />
the opportunity to be given for a change of policy. I'm not<br />
adding to that. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
JOURNALIST: Won't it cause problems for you in the next<br />
campaign if you haven't got that policy on privatisation or<br />
on capitalisation of the airlines complete?<br />
PM: I'm confident that when the, by the time the next<br />
election comes, we'll be in a position to have the<br />
appropriate answer with which to go to the electorate. I've<br />
said these issues are not black and white and you can't<br />
apply, as I've said right from the very beginning of this<br />
discussion, you can't apply the same arguments to each of<br />
the enterprises. I mean I notice in today's Press that John<br />
Moore has got a list as long as your arm now as to things<br />
that would be disposed. I have a quite different concept<br />
than that. In other words, there will be, whatever decision<br />
that we take, there will be a clear dividing line between us<br />
and the conservative opposition on this question.<br />
JOURNALIST: You don't feel under some sort of heat from the<br />
Liberal Party on this issue do you?<br />
PM: No, I don't think that I look as though I feel under<br />
heat. I can assure I don't feel under it and I hope I don't<br />
convey the impression of being under heat Paul.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it also possible Mr Hawke that the processes<br />
now under way will permit you to go to the next election<br />
with a revised uranium policy?<br />
PM: There are the two committees, one on the public assets,<br />
one is on the question of uranium policy. I have thought<br />
more about the public assets one, I haven't directed my<br />
attention so much to the other. I guess the answer to your<br />
question is it's conceivable.<br />
JOURNALIST: I take it Prime Minister you would prefer a<br />
State Government to meet its expenditure commitments by<br />
increasing tax and charges CPI rather than, for<br />
example, by an income tax surcharge?<br />
PM: Well, it's not a question of me expressing preferences<br />
what they do, I made the general point Milton about the<br />
difficulties that are created for conduct of macroeconomic<br />
policy if you have income tax powers back and being<br />
exercised by the States. We've operated, in our six years<br />
of Government, in our relations with the States in what I<br />
think has overall been a fairly effective way. We are<br />
excercising the central taxing power and we have been able,<br />
in discussion with them, to arrange the levels of the direct<br />
grants that we make to them in the processes of the Premiers<br />
Conference, the Loan Council in the arrangements in regard<br />
to borrowing powers in a way which overall has been<br />
conducive to sensible macroeconomic policy. So I would see<br />
a continuation of that sort of situation as being compatible<br />
with the sort of macroeconomic outcomes that we want to<br />
effect. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, an economic commentator who's<br />
had some credibility with the Government in the past, namely<br />
Max Walsh, today suggests that we're in danger of becoming<br />
the white trash of Asia, that we can't afford the tax cuts<br />
and that your Government has become paralysed when it comes<br />
to policy.<br />
PM: I read the article, I think one of Max's more<br />
exaggerated comments. I always read him with interest and I<br />
think it does considerably less than justice to the<br />
considerable micro reform that we have conducted and which<br />
will go on during the life of this Parliament. Very<br />
considerable changes in the area of airline deregulation and<br />
the Government business enterprises being made more<br />
competitive. The work that is being done on the waterfront<br />
at the maritime industries and in which we'll see progress<br />
this year. All these things are significant and unmatched,<br />
let me say, by anything ever done before by any conservative<br />
Government. I mean if you're talking about Australia today<br />
and the development in the region that he's talking about,<br />
what you've got to remember is that for, out of the 40 years<br />
now since ' 49, we've had 31 of those 40 years have been<br />
conservative Government. In other words the basic<br />
structures and attitudes in this country overwhelmingly are<br />
the product of that period. We in six years now have done<br />
more in that six years than has been done in the whole of<br />
the rest of the period before in microeconomic reform, as<br />
well as in the macro area with the deregulation of the<br />
financial sector, the introduction of the foreign banks, the<br />
floating of the dollar. All that we've done in six years,<br />
more than in the whole of the rest of the period combined,<br />
and we're continuing to do it. As I say there will be<br />
achievements on the waterfront, in the maritime industry as<br />
well as the areas that I've already talked about. I think<br />
it's fair to say that a reading of Max's article doesn't<br />
really give due credit to those facts.<br />
JOURNALIST: concern to you that America is to have a<br />
Defense Secretary who regards Australia under your<br />
Government as an unreliable defence partner?<br />
PM: Yes I read that with some interest this morning. I<br />
would be certain from my knowledge of the President with<br />
whom I have a very, very, very close relationship, that<br />
whatever outbursts there may have been before from Mr Cheney<br />
in those circumstances will not be reflected in the attitude<br />
which this administration will continue to have towards this<br />
Government. That is now a matter of public record as<br />
expressed by the previous President, by the previous<br />
Secretary for Defense and as a matter of record by this<br />
President. That is that the overall relationship, including<br />
the defence relationship between our two countries has never<br />
been better. That is the position. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
JOURNALIST: sense meeting with Mr Cheney to try and<br />
convince him he's wrong?<br />
PM: I doubt if he has that view now because all the<br />
evidence of the period up to the present would confirm the<br />
basis upon which the previous President, this President and<br />
the previous Secretaries for Defense have spoken in glowing<br />
terms on the nature of the relationship. That's not<br />
something that was said four years ago. That's the position<br />
of all relevant people as of now.<br />
JOURALIST: Doesn't it worry you that the President has<br />
appointed a man with such publicly expressed hostile views<br />
of Australia?<br />
PM: Well it was said at a particular time. I don't think<br />
it reflects in any sense the current thinking or current<br />
realities. I doesn't worry me one iota, not one iota.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you going to send Mr Beazley to find out or<br />
try and square off?<br />
PM: No I wouldn't be sending Mr Beazley to find out or<br />
square off. I would regard that as a waste of public money.<br />
When Mr Beazley sees Mr Chaney in the normal course of<br />
events I would you know I'm a punting man as you know<br />
Laurie I would bet you pounds for peanuts now I'd give you<br />
any sorts of odds you like, one that the relationship,<br />
personal relationship will be good, will work and that<br />
there would be a continuation under Mr Chaney of the<br />
attitude towards the relationship that I've expressed. That<br />
is the attitude expressed by the previous President, this<br />
President and by the previous Secretarys' of Defense.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you know Mr Chaney?<br />
PM: I'm not aware of having met him.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke you told the Housing Industry<br />
Conference this morning that there would be some scope for<br />
lower interest rates as activity eased off over the year. A<br />
new survey out today shows that there was a slow down in<br />
activity in the December quarter and that activity could be<br />
falling off a lot quicker than people have previously<br />
anticipated. Do you think there is some scope for lower<br />
interest rates to prevent another in the economy?<br />
PM: No I am not predicting that in the immediate future.<br />
You're right in saying that there are some signs of easing<br />
in the level of activity and I've been through those various<br />
indicia. But we've got to say at this stage a little mixed.<br />
I mean if we look at the latest employment figures which<br />
came out last week which showed further growth in<br />
employment, which now takes the jobs created to 1,318,300<br />
since April of 1983, it's been with an increased<br />
participation rate. Further reduction however is still in </p>
<p>-7-<br />
( PM cont) the unemployment rate down to You ought<br />
to take that into account. So the indications are mixed.<br />
We hope and indeed believe that the level of activity is<br />
starting to climb as we want but I'm not going to say<br />
therefore now we've got an immediate future reduction in<br />
interest rates in sight. What is happening however is that<br />
the policies that we've been applying I think on the whole<br />
do seem to be working, I think we can be looking as we go<br />
through this year in a reduction in the level of activity.<br />
As I've said this is a fine line we're walking between<br />
reducing the over-heating which brings in too many imports<br />
but not getting down that low that we can't sustain<br />
employment growth. I think the policies are working and<br />
within that framework what I've said this morning to the<br />
Housing Industry Association Conference is the appropriate<br />
way of putting it I believe.<br />
JOURNALIST: One of the banks is making noises about<br />
increasing the home loan rate, dealing with some trepidation<br />
the balance of payment figures out on Thursday. Are they<br />
jumping the gun a bit?<br />
PM: Well they seem to be. I mean let me say this is a<br />
figure that we have I kind of guess I don't need to say<br />
this as it's quite clear that we have no prior knowledge<br />
of the figures. I think that's probably a good thing<br />
We have no prior knowledge of this figure and I assume, and<br />
I certainly hope it's true, that the bank doesn't either.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister in your speech this morning on<br />
interest rates you say, " as soon as it's economically<br />
responsible to reduce interest rates it will be done". Does<br />
that mean that the Government rather than the market sets<br />
the rates?<br />
PM: Well as we are copying the odium in some quarters for<br />
the combined operation, the market and Government monetary<br />
policy, and it is a combination of both, we're entitled when<br />
it comes down as I've said it will before the end of the<br />
year to get the credit. Of course it's a combination of<br />
official Government monetary policy operating through the<br />
market. JOURANLIST: Mr Hawke you said a few minutes ago that<br />
privatisation's still on the agenda. Are you talking about<br />
the agenda for the April statement or do you mean the agenda<br />
for later on in the year?<br />
PM: I wasn't talking about the April statement.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sydney Airport Prime Minister, when can we<br />
expect a decision? </p>
<p>PM: We'll be going to it tomorrow. I hope we may be able<br />
to get a decision tomorrow. But as I've said I'm not going<br />
to rush this decision. It's quite clear. I've indicated<br />
that all the options are on the table as distinct from the<br />
impression of some commentators that that's not the case,<br />
they are. All the options are on the table and I'm not<br />
being defensive about this. It is an extraordinay, complex<br />
issue. I mean a whole lot of assumptions have to be made,<br />
worked out about patterns of growth and so on and I want to<br />
make sure that we get it right. We are going to get it<br />
right. If I can be satisfied that we've got it right by<br />
tomorrow, then it'll be tomorrow, if not it will be later.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does it worry you that your Cabinet is split on<br />
it Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: Split? I wouldn't talk about a Cabinet split in any<br />
sense. I mean if you're talking about splits this sort<br />
of nonsense from the opposition, the Shadow Finance minister<br />
getting up on Sunday and being disowned within 24 hours by<br />
the Leader of the opposition, that's where the splits are.<br />
There is a situation where there are differences of opinion.<br />
A difference of opinion on an issue is not a split. We have<br />
no split.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will the Wesley Vale decision be made tomorrow?<br />
PM: Again I hope so. I've not had the opportunity of<br />
talking with my ministers since the Tasmanian position has<br />
been translated. I know that they have in discussions<br />
some of the Ministers are having discussions tomorrow with<br />
the joint venturers and I haven't seen the results of the<br />
study requested of the CSIRO. So I'm not in a position and<br />
both of them those discussions not having taken place yet<br />
and not having seen the CSIRO report. I couldn't honestly<br />
say to you yes an answer will be given tomorrow. But again<br />
this is an issue in which we want extradition consistent<br />
with a proper consideration of the facts. It'll be done<br />
quite quickly but not necessarilly tomorrow.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke can home owners expect any relief from<br />
the April statement?<br />
PM: It's not only home owners. I think the general<br />
community in Australia will be entitled to expect and they<br />
will receive from the Government a considered statement<br />
which will be consistent with the previous 6 years. That is<br />
of the conduct of economic policy in a way which is relevant<br />
to the circumstances and the challenges confronting this<br />
community. We are entitled now to " look, look what<br />
we've done in changing external-imposed circumstances we've<br />
adjusted economic policy which has maintained the level of<br />
economic activity consistently in a way which has produced<br />
this massive employment growth". Without a return I remind<br />
you to the interest rate levels, we haven't reached the peak<br />
of interest rates under our predecessors and as far as<br />
unemployment is concerned we've reduced successively </p>
<p>-9-<br />
( PM cont) unemployment with this rate of employment growth<br />
4 times theirs and twice the rate of the rest of the world.<br />
Now these are the things that have come from successive May<br />
statements and successive Budgets. We've got the runs on<br />
the board. What home owners and the rest of Australia will<br />
see in April and then in the Budget is a continuation of<br />
relevant and successful policies.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke would it be acceptable for your<br />
Government that it could take two months before the results<br />
of the ACT's first election are<br />
PM: Of course it's acceptable in the sense that we can't do<br />
anything about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: You introduced the system.<br />
PM: It is true that with the support of the Liberal Party<br />
we introduced it. This is something that was passed by the<br />
Government with the support of our political opponents.<br />
Both of us must accept the outcome of what together we've<br />
done. ends </p>
