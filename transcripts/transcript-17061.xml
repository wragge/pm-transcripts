    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, the Victorian Roads Minister, Tim Pallas, and Member for Ballarat, Catherine King, today announced the official start of major construction on the $200 million upgrade of the Western Highway at Anthony's Cutting that will straighten and duplicate 5 kilometres between Melton West and Bacchus Marsh.</p>
<p>As a result of the Australian Government's decision to bring forward funding as part of the Economic Stimulus Plan, this project will now be completed in early 2012, three months ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>The work will improve safety and reduce travel times for the 25,000 cars and 4,000 trucks that use this section of Highway every day, and delivery of the project will immediately support as many as 1,000 direct and indirect jobs.</p>
<p>Features of the project include:</p>
<p>     * Straightening and duplicating five kilometres of highway;</p>
<p>     * Six new bridges;</p>
<p>     * Two new Melbourne-bound access ramps at Hopetoun Park Road; and</p>
<p>     * A new link will be provided to and from Bacchus Marsh with Woolpack Road extended from Bacchus Marsh Road, with direct freeway connections in all directions via a new interchange.</p>
<p>Up until now, the Anthony's Cutting section of the Western Highway with its steep hills and tight curves has seen 21 serious crashes in just the last five years.</p>
<p>The upgrade at Anthony's Cutting is a jointly funded project, with the Australian Government contributing $160 million and the Victorian Government $40 million.</p>
<p>The project is part of the Australian Government's $36 billion investment in transport infrastructure and part of the $38 billion Victorian Government Transport Plan.</p>
