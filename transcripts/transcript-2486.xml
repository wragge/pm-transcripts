COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. W. McMAHON, M. P.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
ON<br />
THE ARTS IN AUSTRALIA<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 26 October 1971]<br />
Mr McMAHON ( Lowe-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-Mr Acting Speaker, in recent<br />
years my Government and its predecessors<br />
have given greatly increased support to the<br />
arts in Australia. The response has been<br />
most encouraging. As a result, our policy<br />
on the arts and the interpretation of action<br />
taken or not taken by the Government have<br />
. tracted a good deal of attention from<br />
nonourable members as well as from the<br />
media and the public. It is timely, therefore<br />
to give to the House a fresh appreciation of<br />
our attitude to the arts. It is proper for me<br />
Sclarify some aspects of our involvement<br />
lihich have been under discussion in recent<br />
weeks. The Government sees the arts in a<br />
multitude of expressions and forms-not as<br />
an adornment but as an integral part of<br />
life; not something exclusive to the hours<br />
of leisure but as a force, penetrating and<br />
enriching every aspect of human affairs; not<br />
as the preserve of the rich and the<br />
sophisticated but as a source of delight<br />
for all.<br />
The arts are among the factors which go<br />
to create a quality of life unique in Australia.<br />
In the past we may have been<br />
inclined to stress the physical and material<br />
satisfactions of life at the expense of the<br />
pleasures of the creative imagination. And<br />
as a result many talented Australians who<br />
wished to be painters or writers, actors or<br />
dancers, musicians or film directors have<br />
had to leave Australia to build a career in a more sympathetic artistic climate elsewhere.<br />
We could not afford this leaching of our<br />
society any more than we can now afford to<br />
allow our incomparable environment to be<br />
despoiled and polluted by lack of foresight<br />
and conscience. But, with the growing<br />
cultural awareness of the Australian society<br />
and because of support provided by governments,<br />
the opportunities for talented<br />
Australians to pursue a professional career<br />
in this country have been increased<br />
significantly in recent years. While there is<br />
still much to be done, novelists and poets,<br />
painters and sculptors can now command a<br />
better market as professionals here and<br />
abroad than they could do not so many<br />
years ago.<br />
The Australian Opera Company, the<br />
Australian Ballet Company, the State drama<br />
companies, the Australian Broadcasting<br />
Commission and the Australian Elizabethan<br />
Trust orchestras, and many other smaller<br />
companies, all now employ artists on a<br />
continuing basis, and they attract back to<br />
Australia artists who, having gone abroad<br />
for further experience, wish to return and<br />
work in their own country. This flow will<br />
increase as time goes by and bring great<br />
stimulus and enrichment to the daily life of<br />
all Australians.<br />
The effectiveness of policy in relation to<br />
the arts of course will depend in part on the<br />
vitality and wisdom of the institutions set up<br />
to administer it. In the Commonwealth, 7 1 / 9 4 </p>
<p>overall responsibility for the arts has been<br />
placed by me with the Minister for the<br />
Environment, Aborigines and the Arts<br />
( Mr Howson). This Ministry was created to<br />
take over from the Prime Minister policy<br />
issues of increasing importance on a variety<br />
of matters which demanded more sustained<br />
attention than it was possible for him to<br />
give. Nevertheless, I find a certain logic in<br />
the combination.<br />
The Minister's responsibilities are all in<br />
different ways concerned with the quality of<br />
life which opens out before the Australian<br />
people. It is increasingly clear that the<br />
superb natural environment which this<br />
continent provides for human life can no<br />
longer be taken for granted. It must be<br />
protected with understanding and with care.<br />
If, as I have said, the arts should be deeply<br />
integrated into our lives, they too form<br />
pant of the intellectual and cultural environment<br />
within which our lives are livedoffering<br />
diversity of experience and lending<br />
form and substance to our personal and<br />
natural identity. Aboriginal Australians are<br />
an unqualified responsibility of governments<br />
-a challenge to our conscience and to our<br />
political and social wisdom.<br />
There is, particularly in relation to the<br />
environment and the arts, much that we can<br />
learn from them. For tens of thousands of<br />
years they have inhabited this continent, living<br />
in harmony with it and its creatures.<br />
They established a way of life in which<br />
the arts, of music, dance, theatre and ritual<br />
were woven into the textore of their daily<br />
lives. It is indeed a happy combination of<br />
responsibilities which am sure will give<br />
the Minister and his advisers great stimulus<br />
and satisfaction. In the past, when responsibility<br />
for the arts lay with the Prime Minister,<br />
several separate bodies were set up and<br />
were responsible for advising him on various<br />
aspects of the arts. They continue to this<br />
day and now advise the Minister for the<br />
Environment. Aborigines and the Arts.<br />
The Commonwealth Literary Fund had its<br />
own advisory committee. In the building<br />
up of the national collection of works<br />
of art and on many related matters the<br />
Prime Minister was assisted by the Commonwealth<br />
Art Advisory Board. Advice on<br />
the needs of composers has been provided<br />
by the Board of the Commonwealth Assistance<br />
to Australian Composers. In the field<br />
of the performing arts help was given by the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust,<br />
a private corporation supported by Government<br />
funds. In recent years several major<br />
institutional developments have occurred<br />
including the establishment of the Australian<br />
Council for the Arts, the completion<br />
of the National Library, and the decision<br />
to begin planning a National Gallery for<br />
Canberra. More recently the Governmentt<br />
established 2 new organisations in the field<br />
of film and television, the Film Development<br />
Corporation and the Interim Counc<br />
of the Australian Film and Televisio..<br />
Training School.<br />
Apart from these bodies, the Australian<br />
Broadcasting Commission, through its symphony<br />
orchestras, television and radio pr~ r<br />
grammes, has continued to exercise powe.<br />
ful direct effects on the content and style<br />
of the performing arts. The Government<br />
has now, therefore, a range of organisations,<br />
advisory and executive, to assist it to form<br />
and give effect to policies for the support<br />
of the arts. The time, therefore, may be<br />
ripe to review the structure of these bodies<br />
and their relationship to one another so<br />
that they can best promote the vigour and<br />
diversity of Australian artistic life. When<br />
the late Mr Holt announced the Government's<br />
decision to set up an Australian<br />
Council for the Arts he said it would t<br />
responsible primarily for the performing<br />
arts, but would also have the task of advising<br />
the Government on those aspects of<br />
the arts not receiving aid through existing<br />
channels. He said also that the establishment<br />
of the Council did not preclude ti.<br />
possibility of an overall council responsible<br />
for all aspects of Government support for<br />
the arts along the lines of the Canada Council<br />
and the Arts Council of Great Britain.<br />
Support has also been expressed for a comprehensive<br />
ministry of culture in the style<br />
common among European countries.<br />
Du ring the last two or three years the<br />
Council for the Arts and other advisers<br />
have given thought to these possibilities.<br />
After consultation with them, I am inclined<br />
to distrust the idea of a single monolithic<br />
controller of public patronage. With all its<br />
faults I believe that our pattern of various<br />
channels of support, with scope for varied<br />
artistic and social influences, is almost certainly<br />
healthier. Nevertheless the arts are in<br />
a perpetual process of change and are<br />
unlikely long to fit a pattern of institutions </p>
<p>evolved slowly over many years. New art<br />
forms emerge under the stimulus of technological<br />
change which do not fall readily<br />
within accepted classifications.<br />
One of the most exciting aspects of contemporary<br />
cultural life is the crossfertilisation<br />
which now occurs between<br />
different art forms, a process greatly stimulated<br />
by developments in film and electronic<br />
processes. It is important, therefore, firstly,<br />
that the organisational structure should be<br />
. exible and capable of adapting itself to<br />
change and, secondly, that the state of the<br />
arts should continuously be studied so that,<br />
where necessary, gaps may be filled, collaboration<br />
ensured and new initiatives<br />
stimulated. My colleague, the Minister, tells<br />
. ie that he intends shortly, and thereafter<br />
at intervals, to bring together the Chairmen<br />
of the various Commonwealth agencies in<br />
the arts to discuss their present responsibilities<br />
and relationships one to the other.<br />
This will be a valuable opportunity for<br />
them to offer their advice on the effectiveness<br />
of the present structure to meet the<br />
changing demands of contemporary art<br />
forms. It will continue to be the function of the<br />
Council for the Arts to study and report<br />
on those aspects of the arts which are not<br />
; sisted through existing Commonwealth<br />
agencies and to make its contribution to<br />
advice available to the Minister on the balance<br />
and effectiveness of our programmes<br />
as a whole. It was in pursuit of these func-<br />
' ions that the Council presented my prede-<br />
, ssor with a report which led to major<br />
developments in the field of film and television<br />
to which I shall return later.<br />
More recently a study of the state of<br />
music in Australia has been completed and<br />
the Council will shortly be presenting my<br />
colleague with its recommendations arising<br />
from that study. Two additional studies<br />
will be undertaken this year by committees<br />
to be established by the Minister. The first<br />
of these will examine the role of crafts as<br />
art forms in their own right, as a widely<br />
spread experience of creative processes and<br />
as the foundation of good industrial<br />
design. The committee will include representatives<br />
of the Council for the Arts,<br />
the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board<br />
and the Council for Industrial Design who<br />
will jointly advise on the committee's<br />
terms of reference. The second will concern itself with<br />
means whereby children and young people<br />
can be helped to enjoy and practise the<br />
arts more effectively. The chairmen of the<br />
Council for the Arts, -the Commonwealth<br />
Assistance to Australian Composers Advisory<br />
Board, the Commonwealth Literary<br />
Fund and the Commonwealth Art Advisory<br />
Board will jointly advise on the terms<br />
of reference of this study which will also<br />
involve educational authorities. Special<br />
attention will be given in these and other<br />
future studies to the effect of innovation in<br />
art forms and the mutual stimulus they<br />
can provide for one another.<br />
Before leaving areas of the arts for<br />
which the Council is responsible, let me<br />
comment on the increased support for the<br />
performing arts being given this year. The<br />
grant has been increased by almost 17 per<br />
cent to $ 4.5m. The greater part of the<br />
increase has been given deliberately to the<br />
Australian Opera and to the orchestras of<br />
the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust.<br />
Their share has been increased by 45 per<br />
cent to $ 1,290,000. Some critics have seen<br />
this as an example of discrimination or<br />
favouritism. The Government believes that<br />
increased support for the arts cannot sensibly<br />
be given uniformly across the board.<br />
That way, no large development can ever<br />
be ' achieved, given the competitive pressures<br />
on Government funds. It is more<br />
effective to seize opportunities for major<br />
break-throughs as they are offered by the<br />
occasion or by some other stimulus to<br />
innovation. In 1973 the opening of the Sydney<br />
Opera House will give Australia the<br />
chance to match the splendour of that<br />
building with performances which will be<br />
worthy of it and of the long association of<br />
Australians with this art form. The Government<br />
makes no apology for the emphasis<br />
it has this year given to strengthening<br />
the opera company and its associated<br />
orchestra. Their success will set new standards<br />
for all the arts and I am sure that<br />
the special occasion for others will be not<br />
far distant. Those who love the arts will<br />
rejoice that Australian opera has -been<br />
given an effective opportunity to set new<br />
s'andards of excellence.<br />
* Let me turn now to developments in the<br />
visual arts. As honourable members know,<br />
the first steps have been taken to establish </p>
<p>a national gallery. Over many years the<br />
Art Advisory Board has built up in the<br />
gallery an historical collection of the works<br />
of Australian painters of the past and the<br />
present. It will also incorporate outstanding<br />
examples of the work of indigenous artists<br />
of New Guinea and aboriginal Australia,<br />
art of the South-East Asian and Pacific<br />
region and art on a world-wide basis,<br />
beginning with the 20th century.<br />
The gallery will be more than the home<br />
for a unique and splendid collection of<br />
works of art. Its functions are broadly<br />
conceived so that it will become also a<br />
centre of creative activity for the exhibition<br />
of collections from abroad and of the<br />
work of contemporary artists, and a focus<br />
of education and research exercising, in<br />
collaboration with sister galleries in the<br />
States, a profound and pervasive influence<br />
on the life of Australians.<br />
When the decision to proceed with gallery<br />
planning was taken in 1% 7 an interim<br />
council was appointed to administer certain<br />
aspects of the initial programme. Its terms<br />
of office expired recently and it is the<br />
Government's intention now to legislate for<br />
a permanent council as a statutory body to<br />
administer the gallery. Much, of course,<br />
will depend on the gallery's first Director.<br />
I am pleased to announce tonight that the<br />
Government proposes to appoint Mr James<br />
Mollison to the post. Pending the submission<br />
of the legislation and the establishment<br />
of the statutory office, Mr Mollison<br />
has agreed to make his services available<br />
under contract to the Government to carry<br />
out the duties and responsibilities that will<br />
fall to the director of the gallery. The<br />
Government has deliberately chosen in Mr<br />
Mollison one who is young as well as<br />
talented and experienced. It will be some<br />
years before the building of the gallery is<br />
complete and its work in full flower. By<br />
then the new director will have grown with<br />
it in stature and have benefited from the<br />
experience of others in Australia and<br />
abroad. The Government is fortunate also that<br />
Mr James Sweeney, the eminent American<br />
Gallery Director and international art and<br />
gallery consultant, has agreed to work with<br />
the new director and the architect during<br />
the present design phase of the gallery. He<br />
will work as a specialist consultant and<br />
adviser to the Government and the National Capital Development Commission<br />
which has charge of the whole project. Mr<br />
Sweeney has already given distinguished<br />
service to the Government and the<br />
National Capital Development Commission<br />
and we value highly the contribution he<br />
has already made to the preparatory phase<br />
of work in the gallery. Honourable members<br />
will share, I am sure, my appreciation<br />
of his work and his readiness to continue<br />
to assist us. I should also add that when<br />
the permanent council for the gallery iappointed<br />
the Art Advisory Board t.<br />
which I have already referred will become<br />
part of the council. The Art Advisory<br />
Board will also perform those other functions<br />
it now exercises which are not directly<br />
concerned with the gallery.<br />
Mr Acting Speaker, I come now to tht<br />
film and television industry. When the<br />
Council for the Arts presented its report<br />
for the development of the film and television<br />
industry it urged the establishment of<br />
3 new institutions-the Australian Film<br />
Development Corporation, the Experimental<br />
Film Fund and the Australian Film<br />
and Television School. The Australian<br />
Film Development Corporation is actively<br />
at work and a number of investments have<br />
been made. The Corporation was designed<br />
to serve as a source of part of the capita'<br />
needed for commercial film and televisio.<br />
ventures, and thus act as a catalyst for<br />
funds from private and banking sources.<br />
The Government looks, however, to<br />
other sections of the film and television<br />
industry to share more actively with * l<br />
Corporation the development of an effective<br />
Australian industry. The Experimental<br />
Film Fund has, until recently, been the<br />
responsibility of the Australian Council for<br />
the Arts. It has already proved effective in<br />
identifying original creative talent in this<br />
medium. The Council has also developed a<br />
more general programme to stimulate the<br />
Australian content of film and television<br />
programmes and to extend sensitive and<br />
critical appreciation of -high quality film<br />
and television. Responsibility for these programmes<br />
will now be taken over by the<br />
Interim Council for the Film and Television<br />
School as has been announced by the<br />
Minister. It was partly with these new<br />
responsibilities in mind that the Government<br />
has decided to add to the Interim<br />
Council 2 men long experienced in radio,<br />
television and film making. They are Mr </p>
<p>Hector Crawford and Mr Lenard Mauger.<br />
Their knowledge will be, I am sure, of<br />
great value -in helping us to promote plans<br />
for the development of the film industry.<br />
There has been a good deal of misunderstanding<br />
of the Government's attitude<br />
towards the question of assistance for<br />
training of film and television producers.<br />
The Government decided at Budget time<br />
to defer consideration of a proposal to<br />
establish a training school for this purpose.<br />
is was one of a number of proposals<br />
-er the range of Government activity on<br />
which consideration was deferred because<br />
of the need to restrict Government expenditure.<br />
This does not mean that the Government<br />
has abandoned the idea of estabing<br />
a training school. In this House on<br />
L1O~ ctober I informed honourable members<br />
that I had instructed the Minister to<br />
proceed as quickly as possible to collect all<br />
the evidence that becomes available to him<br />
so that the proposal could be presented to<br />
the Government well before the next<br />
Budget and not necessarily, therefore, in a<br />
Budget context. He is doing this.<br />
The current position is that the enlarged<br />
Interim Council to which I have just<br />
referred has been asked to review the<br />
relationship of the training already underen<br />
* by -the Australian Broadcasting<br />
jmmjssion, the commercial television<br />
organisations and the film industry to Ahe<br />
programme of the proposed school. It<br />
will seek the co-operation of those<br />
interests for this review. When it has<br />
ived this report the Government will<br />
Leen consider the most appropriate way<br />
in which it might act to assist the industry<br />
in this important area.<br />
In addition to the institutional develop*<br />
ments recommended to and adopted by<br />
the Government, the Council for the<br />
Arts drew attention to the need of the<br />
Australian film industry for some degree<br />
of protection to establish itself on tin'<br />
Australian market. The Council suggestel.<br />
that advice on this matter should be<br />
sought from the Tariff Board or a specially<br />
constituted committee. Many other<br />
countries have found it necessary to<br />
establish quotas or to provide other forms of protection to prevent their<br />
vigorous but infant film industry being<br />
overwhelmed by imported features. I have<br />
therefore asked my colleague, the, Minister<br />
for Trade and Industry, to invite the<br />
Tariff Board to consider the need and<br />
appropriate form of protection for this<br />
industry. He has agreed to do this and in<br />
due course ' the Tariff Board will begin its<br />
work. I should also remind honourable<br />
members that the Government has done<br />
much to advance the cause of the Arts<br />
by ensuring that the Australian Broad.<br />
casting Commission and, through the<br />
Broadcasting Control Board, the commercial<br />
stations, give a substantial percentage<br />
of their viewing time to Australian<br />
made programmes. Under recently<br />
specified new requirements commercial<br />
stations have increased their quotas of<br />
Australian programmes. All stations which<br />
have been established for 3 years or more<br />
must televise at least 50 per cent of Australian<br />
programmes, and 45 per cent of<br />
peak-time programmes between 6 p. m.<br />
and 10 p. m. must be Australian in content.<br />
Audience surveys in recent years show<br />
that some Australian programmes are<br />
getting top ratings.<br />
There remains much of the more<br />
detailed work in support of the arts of<br />
which my colleague, the Minister, will tell<br />
the House at the appropriate time. This<br />
statement has been designed to expres. s<br />
my Government's deep concern for the<br />
arts as an essential and vigorous component<br />
of our national life; to acquaint<br />
the House with the principles which underlie<br />
our organisation for making that<br />
concern effective; and to inform the House<br />
of certain initiatives which will, I am sure,<br />
be welcomed inside and outside Parliament<br />
by those who share our belief that the<br />
arts can add both richness and diversity<br />
to -the quality of life. Mr Acting Speaker,<br />
I commend this statement to you. I present<br />
the following paper:<br />
The Arts in Australia-Ministerial Statement,<br />
26th October .1971.<br />
Motion ( by Mr Swartz) proposed:<br />
That the House take note of the paper.<br />
