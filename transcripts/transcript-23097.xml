    <content><![CDATA[<p>I welcome Dr Bill Glasson’s decision to stand for preselection for the forthcoming Griffith by-election.</p>
<p>Bill Glasson will be a strong local voice for the people of Griffith in Canberra.</p>
<p>The by-election will be an opportunity for the people of Griffith to vote for a candidate that will support the Government’s plan to build a strong and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia.</p>
<p>In particular, it will be an opportunity to vote for a local member who will vote to scrap the carbon tax, reduce electricity prices and ease cost of living pressures.</p>
<p>Bill Glasson campaigned tirelessly as the LNP candidate for Griffith at the last federal election.</p>
<p>He is a true local representative and a distinguished Australian.</p>
<p>Bill Glasson has dedicated himself to representing the people of Griffith with the same enthusiasm, zeal and commitment that he has brought to his distinguished medical career.</p>
<p>I have asked the LNP in Queensland to finalise the preselection process for Griffith as soon as possible.</p>
