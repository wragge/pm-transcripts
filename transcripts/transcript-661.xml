OPENING OF TRAINING CENTRE FOR " GUIDE DOGS FOR<br />
THE BLIND" AT KEW9 MELBOURNE, ON 17TH NOVEMBER,<br />
1962.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt, Hon. R. G Menzies<br />
Sir and Ladies and Gentlemen g<br />
I was very glad to be reminded not only when I got<br />
here but on the way here that this is in my electorate,<br />
and all of you who have the misfortune to be my constituents<br />
had better have a good look at me because the way in which I<br />
neglect my electorate is well known and, you never know, you<br />
might not see me again for six months. ( Laughter)<br />
I'm not going to detain you for very long. It seems<br />
to me to be a rather hot day and it is going to be just as<br />
hot in Canberra, I don't mind telling you, because it was<br />
pretty hot when we left there this morning. All I wanted to<br />
say to you, in declaring this centre open, was that I believe<br />
that the process of civilisation is beginning to get on.<br />
Civilisation was supposed to make enormous strides in the<br />
nineteenth century, I sometimes doubt it. Civilisation is<br />
in the heart and in the mind, and is not always to be assessed<br />
by looking at material things.<br />
This century has seen, I think, two very remarkable<br />
developments, One has been the vast assumption by communities<br />
of legal obligation to people who are less fortunately placed<br />
than the average. The extension of social services in the<br />
modern world has been phenomenal All this is good. All<br />
this is a splendid element in getting rid of extremes in<br />
social life, and in fixing in most of our minds a sense of<br />
obligation, But it is not enough. It is not enough that we<br />
should think that all our obligations are discharged by writing<br />
out a cheque for our taxes, accompanied by a suitable volley<br />
of unprintable, and indeed unprincipled, language. ( Laughter)<br />
Tha's not good enough. We have and I am happy to say<br />
that Melbourne is a splendid example of it managed to<br />
preserve, over and above our sense of legal obligation, our<br />
human sense of obligation, our understanding of the fact that<br />
no great body or institute or group or centre which is designed<br />
to give human assistance to human beings can succeed unless<br />
it has human assistance from human beings not just doing<br />
their legal duty but going the second mile. ( Applause)<br />
Those of us who have the great good fortune to enjoy<br />
our sight think of those who don't, always with a feeling of<br />
sympathy, but perhaps not always with a feeling of understanding,<br />
There was a time in our history, not in our generation but in<br />
past times, when people who suffered from infirmities which<br />
set them apart from the normal run of human beings in normal<br />
activities, were regarded as odd people. God had laid his<br />
hand on them and there was nothing that man could do about it.<br />
This was an uncivilised idea.<br />
We have, in recent years in Australia, thanks to the<br />
devoted activities of people, many of whom are here this<br />
afternoon, brought about great changes in this matter. Human<br />
ingenuity has been exercised. A compassionate interest, not<br />
a condescending interest, but a compassionate and understanding<br />
interest has been brought to bear on these matters. And in<br />
the result, in our time, many of us have seen brought to the </p>
<p>service of people who are without their sight first of all<br />
the superb faculty of being able to read. The invention of<br />
Braille all the things that have gone with it reopened to<br />
many a world they thought they had lost, and opened to some a<br />
world that they had never gained. This was I think one of the<br />
great events in modern history, not always remembered, not<br />
frequently remembered, but we all have it in our minds this<br />
afternoon. And then along came broadcasting. Very interesting<br />
that the name of Jack Davey should be associated with this<br />
memorial, because broadcasting brought into the lives of<br />
people not able to read, not able to see but well able to<br />
hear and to understand, a new source of entertainment and of<br />
instruction. Why some of them here today have even enjoyed<br />
the ineffable pleasure thanks to broadcasting of hearing<br />
me being insulted in Parliament House ( Laughter) and returning<br />
the compliment with great spirit and decency. ( Laughter)<br />
( Applause) But broadcasting it was really, when you come<br />
to think of it, the next great step braille for reading,<br />
broadcasting for hearing√∏<br />
But that left untouched the auestion of what the<br />
Chairman, Dr. Prior, has called nobility. It is not always<br />
easy for a sightless man or woman to be taken by the arm<br />
through the traffic to the shops, around on the daily chores,<br />
by another member of the family, and the discovery that you<br />
could train highly intelligent dogs to be their friends,<br />
. uides and companions is, I venture to say one of the great<br />
social discoveries of our timeo ( Applause)<br />
Whatever disabilities we nay suffer from, not one of<br />
us would wish to be unduly dependent on other people, We have<br />
a healthy feeling of independence, a healthy pride, a healthy<br />
self-respect, and to be given the means of mobility, of moving<br />
about, this is a great thing and I like many of you, am looking<br />
forward to seeing a little bit of this work this afternoon.<br />
I confess, with shsme, I have known little of it, but this<br />
afternoon I have already begun to learn a great deal about it.<br />
I little wonder that some of the generous, splendid citizens<br />
I see around here this afternoon have devoted so much attention<br />
to ito This in short, Sir, is a further exercise in the<br />
development of civilisationo It's taken a long time to come,<br />
but I believe that in our tine it is beginning to come and to<br />
come fast, because let me ropeat, this is scmething in the<br />
heart and in the mind. It does. n't douend on what you pay, but<br />
on how you feel and how you think, because they will determine<br />
what you do, And today we have a splendid modern example of<br />
what can be done.<br />
I venture to say, Sir, that thanks to the work that you<br />
and your colleagues and other people have done, you are<br />
initiating a new era for many, many people and an increasing<br />
number in days to como, and that as a whole community we can be<br />
very thankful that these differences, though they are technical<br />
differences, yet have a profound influence on human conduct<br />
and human outlook, are being elim. inated, not only by the march<br />
of science and skill but by the warmth of the heart and<br />
understanding of our citizens,<br />
Sir, I have very great pleasure indeed it is a very<br />
great honour to declare this Centre open. </p>
