PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT FRIDAY, 19 OCTOBER 1979<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY MEDIA, OUTSIDE LIBERAL PARTY<br />
SECRETARIAT CANBERRA Prime Minister<br />
A large part of the discussion during the course of the day<br />
centred on the sorts of things that are going to happen during<br />
the 1980s. I think everyone present recognised that the<br />
Federal Coalition is critical to the sound and sensible<br />
and good government of Australia over the next decade. We<br />
are starting to see a very substantial investment in<br />
development in this country now: the $ 4 billion of investment<br />
of the aluminium industry alone, $ 2 billion in coal. That is<br />
just in two major industries. In the aluminium industry it<br />
can occur because not only have we got plentiful supplies of<br />
bauxite, but also we've got very great supplies of relatively<br />
cheap, by world standards, electricity based on coal. What we<br />
need to do and what the Federal Government is examining how<br />
this might be achieved in co-operation with the States, is<br />
to bring together the resources within this country, and our<br />
energy sources such as coal and electricity based on coal, to<br />
the advantage and development of this nation. This is happening<br />
in the a-luminium industry in a very dramatic way. What we<br />
are interested in is to see whether a greater rate of<br />
development in the electricity industry can achieve something<br />
more. It is worth noting that about $ 800 million of the<br />
infrastructure money that has so far been approved, is in<br />
electricity or electricity-based projects and greater rate<br />
of expansions, greater rate of development.<br />
We spoke about a number of these things and how the<br />
Commonwealth and the States can co-operate together to achieve<br />
the sort of development that we wanted. I think that kind of<br />
discussion really took probably the major slice of the pie.<br />
We have developed, or spent a fair amount of time, also on our<br />
concern at the negative and destructive policies of our<br />
political opponents, policies that would place trade-unions<br />
above the law; policies that were confirm very vehemently<br />
at the Adelaide Conference; economic policies which Mr. Hawke<br />
himself called a gutless sell-out to the left; other policies<br />
in relation to uranium which Mr. Hawke called futile and totally<br />
ineffective and implying it is against Australia's interests;<br />
policies that are anti-investment and anti-development because<br />
of the attack on major resource projects through taxation or<br />
other means.<br />
In addition, of course, the small States are very concerned<br />
at the continuing constitutional attack by the Australian Labor<br />
Party an attack which would destroy--leave the Senate in<br />
place--but destroy the powers of the Senate and therefore the<br />
capacity of the Senate to protect the smaller or less popular<br />
States from the majorities of people in Victoria and N. S. W.,<br />
especially in Melbourne and Sydney. / 2 </p>

Prime minister ( continued)<br />
I think it is, in a sense, disheartening from a national point<br />
of view, to see that the policies for the Labor Party that<br />
were confirmed at the Adelaide Conference, are as negative<br />
as they have ever been. In a sense, it is different<br />
personalities, but. it is the Whitlam policies all over again,<br />
endorsed without any change whatsoever.<br />
Question You mentioned the significance -of the Federal Coalition, sir,<br />
what about the State Coalition -the problems at that level?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We were talking about Federal issues, and Federal matters.<br />
Anything relating to the Coalition would have taken almost<br />
seconds, maybe a minute or two. That was the attention that<br />
was given to it.<br />
Question You mean the problems at the State level were in fact ignored<br />
today? Prime Minister<br />
We weren't discussing problems at State levels.<br />
Question Prime Minister, it sounds very much like a rally ' round the flag<br />
exercise. Why has that been necessary given that an election<br />
is a year away?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Rally ' round the flag exercise no, that's the wrong way of<br />
looking at it. A lot of thingshappen in a quite routine way.<br />
We have this discussion once or twice a year on a pretty<br />
methodical basis. The last meeting was at the time of the<br />
Federal Council Meeting in Perth. We have made a practice<br />
of getting together a couple of times a year. You. don't have.<br />
to look upon it as unusual or extraordinary, or needing some<br />
dramatic event to build a meeting around. It is a meeting of<br />
people committed to the same political philosophy, and broadly<br />
to the same policies.<br />
Question What about industrial legislation, Prime Minister? What was the<br />
general feeling about it, and was there a feeling that it didn't<br />
go far enough, that Canberra should start to get tougher as<br />
Western Australia is. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think that you will find, and I think there is an<br />
appreciation of : Lt, that with the Commonwealth's own employees<br />
through the CE( EP) Act and for the legislation that went through<br />
the Senate at 3: 00 o'clock last night, that the Commonwealth<br />
is really taking to itself the kind of armoury that we believe<br />
is needed. We would much prefer not to have to use those<br />
powers, but in the circumstances in which a union, or unions,<br />
are confronting and damaging and attacking the well-being of<br />
the people of Australia, quite obviously governments, whether<br />
it is a State Government or a Federal Government in their<br />
respective areas of responsibility they've got to act to<br />
protect the interests of people. I think there is one area<br />
which the States are interested in and I don't think it could<br />
happen anyway, but we are certainly prepared to look at it if<br />
there is a union that wants to escape the provisions of a<br />
State law, if it gets de-registered in a State for example by<br />
Federal registration, they would hope that that could not<br />
happen so that they couldn't escape the consequences of State<br />
law by jumping jurisdictions as it were. I think on the same<br />
basis, if a union is de-registered in the Federal arena, we<br />
wouldn't want to see it escaping the consequence of that by<br />
achieving State registration. So there is a matter there that<br />
I think we need to look at. I am advised that it is unlikely<br />
that it pould-occur in any case, but we do have the discussion<br />
going on. There has been a meeting, not just from Liberal or<br />
National Party Ministers, but there have been meetings with<br />
Tony Street and Industrial Relations Ministers which is<br />
preparing papers to go before the Premiers and myself in<br />
December at the Premiers' Conference. I hope there will coming<br />
constructive matters coming out of that, involving all governments.<br />
Question Do you feel that there is a risk that ( indaudible) risk of<br />
worsening industrial confrontation. ( Inaudible).<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, I wouldn't have thought so. I think that there is a feeling<br />
that governments are more determined and that governments know<br />
that they have to stand up and protect the interests of the<br />
average people right throughout this nation. I haven't got the<br />
slightest doubt that that is what people out in the street,<br />
people in their homes, want.<br />
Question Prime Minister, your opening statement was very political. Do<br />
you have an electoral, election timetable in mind?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, I don't. ( Break in tape) / 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
to go to that Adelaide Conference and know the<br />
total madness of the policies that the Labor Party<br />
committed itself to. I was very modest in my language<br />
when you relate the language to the policies that it<br />
was describing. 000---</p>
