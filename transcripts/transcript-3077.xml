A. B. C. BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. E. G. WHITLAM, QC, MP,<br />
CANBERRA, TUESDAY 20.11.73<br />
On 8 December less , than three weeks from now you<br />
will be voting on two questions of great importance to Australia's<br />
future and the prosperity of each one of us. You will be voting<br />
in two referendums to decide whether to give the Australian<br />
Parliament the power to make laws about prices and incomes.<br />
I want you to vote YES on both questions. If you do,<br />
you will be giving the national Parliament and the national<br />
Government an essential weapon to fight inflation and to help<br />
keep prices down.<br />
Rising prices are a problem in almost every country<br />
in the world. Indeed, much of Australia's inflation has been<br />
caused by inflation in larger, wealthier countries. The<br />
Australian Government has done much to counter it. We have<br />
introduced a Prices Justification Tribunal. We have cut tariffs.<br />
We have revalued the dollar twice. And we have introduced a wide<br />
range of other fiscal and m9netary measures.<br />
Despite these efforts, the battle is not yet won.<br />
For there is no simple magic cure for inflation especially when<br />
the national Government is denied the full armory of economic<br />
weapons. Don't let us fight inflation with'one arm tied behind;<br />
. our backs. The powers we seek are essential powers. The national<br />
SPariiaments of all comparable countries have these powers and<br />
use them. In Australia, the States have the powers but they<br />
have not used them. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
They have refused to refer them to the national Parliament.<br />
We believe that if such powers are to be effective they must<br />
be uniform, immediate and unchallengeable in their application.<br />
Only the national Government cqn act in this way. Inflation<br />
is a national problem which demands national answers. This<br />
is accepted by the Governments of the. United Kingdom, the<br />
United States, Japan, and all other western countries.<br />
Our opponents say that the national Parliament should<br />
not be given powers over prices and incomes. Yet in the same<br />
breath they have called for a prices and incomes freeze. I don't<br />
blame you for wondering just what they believe in. But you can<br />
be quite clear about what my Government believes in. We will<br />
not impose any overall, arbitrary freeze. Our powers, if you<br />
grant them to us, will be used carefully, selectively, with<br />
restraint and discrimination.<br />
The simple truth is that the States have refused to<br />
act together against inflation. Our opponents know, although<br />
they will not admit it, that the largest States have refused at<br />
a special conference and at subsequent meetings to co-operate<br />
with the Australian Government. One Premier would not even<br />
come to dinner with me to discuss the problem. The time has<br />
now come for positive and decisive action. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
On 8 December you can help fight inflation by<br />
writing the word YES in both squares on the ballot paper.<br />
You can ensure that pension increases and the savings of people<br />
on fixed incomes have real value. You can ensure that the new<br />
wage today need not mean inflated prices at the supermarket<br />
tomorrow. You can ensure . that all incotnes not just wages<br />
will be subject to fair and equal scrutiny. You can ensure,<br />
by voting YES, that the national Government is given every<br />
possible weapon to fight inflation and help keep prices down.<br />
In this way you will help to strengthen and safeguard the very<br />
real prosperity we are now enjoying. </p>
