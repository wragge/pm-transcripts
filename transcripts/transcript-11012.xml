<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Neil, nice to be with you again.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, thank you for your time. We are doubling the number of combat</p>
<p> ready troops, putting them on high alert up in the north, why?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we're able to do it because of the defence efficiency review</p>
<p> which has shifted resources from the desks to the front line, and</p>
<p> we do live in a more uncertain environment. So there are two very</p>
<p> good reasons. When we came to office we put a circle around defence</p>
<p> spending and we quarantined it completely from any budget cuts. And</p>
<p> we also decided over a period of time to cut resources in head office</p>
<p> and shift them out to the soldiers and as a result of that we are</p>
<p> now able to put a second brigade on 28 day readiness.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What are the uncertain times which are concerning you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the region is a lot less stable now than it was. East Timor</p>
<p> is part of that instability but it's not the only element but</p>
<p> it's obviously part of it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What's the other element, Papua New Guinea?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea. I think generally the region is less predictable.</p>
<p> We are not under any threat but we know from the experiences of past</p>
<p> few years that Australian forces can properly and in a very beneficial</p>
<p> way be called upon to participate in peacekeeping and other roles.</p>
<p> We've been in Cambodia. We, of course, sent very elite forces</p>
<p> to the gulf. They weren't needed. We have had people elsewhere,</p>
<p> in Namibia in recent times. So there is a pattern where calls on us</p>
<p> to be involved in that way are more rather than less likely. Now,</p>
<p> Timor is but one of those but it's obviously an important one.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What about Ambon? I mean, the situation in Ambon is awful.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, it is. It is very bad but bear in mind that that is very much</p>
<p> a domestic issue for Indonesia and we are not in the business of invading</p>
<p> other countries.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>No, sure. Indonesia itself is going to elections though, is that unsettling</p>
<p> to you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it's very good that Indonesia is going to an election.</p>
<p> We applaud the fact that Indonesia post-Soeharto is now moving to</p>
<p> embrace more democracy. The more the better. But Indonesia faces a</p>
<p> very uncertain future. Indonesia is very heavily influenced and affected</p>
<p> by the economic downturn in Asia. There are millions of Indonesians</p>
<p> in absolute poverty and you have to feel a lot of sympathy for the</p>
<p> people of that country.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is Indonesia in any way a potential threat to this country?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't believe so, no. I haven't believed that for a long</p>
<p> time.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What are we prepared to do in Timor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I hope nothing by way of a peacekeeping role becomes necessary.</p>
<p> Certainly one way or another we'll be called upon to provide</p>
<p> more aid and I hope that we can play a significant part because Timor</p>
<p> is a near neighbour. It's very close to the Australian coastline,</p>
<p> there's a long association with the people of East Timor going</p>
<p> back to World War II, they were very helpful to many of our diggers</p>
<p> then and we should never forget those sorts of things. I hope that</p>
<p> the, you know, the contestants, the combatants in Timor can settle</p>
<p> their differences. We would like a period of autonomy before full</p>
<p> independence but if it's the wish of the East Timorese to go</p>
<p> to full independence then that should happen. We hope the Indonesians</p>
<p> don't pull out to precipitously because if they do then the load</p>
<p> on other countries will be that much greater.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Under what conditions would Australia be involved in a peacekeeping</p>
<p> role in Timor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's hypothetical at this stage and we have said repeatedly</p>
<p> we don't see any merit in hypothesising about a peacekeeping</p>
<p> role when we hope one is not going to eventuate or it won't become</p>
<p> necessary.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Does the state of readiness stop here or will there be other changes</p>
<p> made as well?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you always make changes according to your assessment of the</p>
<p> defence need and the defence priority but we certainly think it's</p>
<p> a major improvement in the use of the resources we do make available</p>
<p> to defence to have two brigades on 28 day notice. So they, of course,</p>
<p> are accompanied by air and sea support elements. Now, whether you</p>
<p> go further than that will depend on circumstances. We intend to maintain</p>
<p> the present quarantining of defence from any expenditure cuts. It</p>
<p> may at some time in the future be necessary to put more resources</p>
<p> into defence. I am not foreshadowing that, I am not promising, I am</p>
<p> not saying it'll happen but I certainly don't rule it out.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are you aware the UN Chief, Kofi Annan, said Indonesia and Portugal</p>
<p> have reached agreement on a direct ballot for a draft autonomy package</p>
<p> for East Timor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I heard a report this morning on that. If that has occurred well that's</p>
<p> a good thing but I have not had any formal confirmation through our</p>
<p> foreign affairs on it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>No, I have only heard reports....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I have just heard reports. Look, anything which represents a</p>
<p> further agreement between Indonesia and Portugal for getting a proper</p>
<p> expression of the will of the East Timorese people we accept. I mean,</p>
<p> bear in mind that we before Christmas changed our position in relation</p>
<p> to Timor. I wrote to Dr Habibie, the Indonesian President, and said</p>
<p> the time had come for a change in Jakarta's attitude. And we</p>
<p> are very much for the East Timorese people being allowed to decide</p>
<p> their own future. We think it would be better if they had a period</p>
<p> of autonomy inside Indonesia but if they refuse to go down that path</p>
<p> then they have a right to insist on independence. We only hope that</p>
<p> Indonesia helps them, it doesn't pull out too quickly, it doesn't</p>
<p> leave them with inadequate resources because it is quite a poor country</p>
<p> with a low living standard.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Tell me, do Indonesian forces continue to train in this country?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We don't have, to my knowledge, we don't have any training</p>
<p> exercises going on at the moment. We still have significant links</p>
<p> between our defence forces and we'd like to continue that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It wasn't so much the training exercises but senior officers</p>
<p> actually coming here....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>My understanding is that that has not occurred for some time.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Should it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have no objection to it, no. I am all in favour of the....look,</p>
<p> the more links of that kind you have it stands to reason it's</p>
<p> a matter of common sense the more links you have of that kind the</p>
<p> less likely you are of some dim distant future moment fall into belligerence.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I think there is a, there's a public perception isn't there</p>
<p> that if we have an enemy in this region it is Indonesia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I think that's very misplaced because the logistic capacity</p>
<p> of the Indonesian forces, if you look at it in a clinical fashion,</p>
<p> to mount any kind of offensive against a neighbouring country are</p>
<p> just not there. I have never seen myself in the time I have been in</p>
<p> politics, I have never seen Indonesia as being in any way a military</p>
<p> threat to Australia.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are you aware of the reports from Timor of significant numbers dying</p>
<p> from preventable diseases....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>...people are arming themselves. Reports that as many as 5,000</p>
<p> weapons in the arms of pro-integrationists [inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, it's a very unsettled situation and I did hear a news report</p>
<p> this morning that agreement had been reached between the warring factions</p>
<p> in East Timor for, in effect, cease fire talks and I hope that materialises</p>
<p> because they really do have to try and dissolve their differences.</p>
<p> But it is going to be a very difficult area of foreign policy for</p>
<p> Australia months, perhaps years, into the future and we will have</p>
<p> to play a major role because we are seen by the world as having a</p>
<p> very direct interest. We are very close to the region, to the country,</p>
<p> and the rest of the world will expect us to play a big part.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, we'll take a quick call specifically on this issue. Peter,</p>
<p> go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Mr Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes Peter.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I was interested to know what part the reserves will play in this</p>
<p> area up north with the inconsistency and the devastation of the reserves</p>
<p> that's been done by the senior people in the defence forces.</p>
<p> And to quote that the command of many reserve regiments are now being</p>
<p> filled by permanent officers at the detriment of reserve officers</p>
<p> which gives them no career path to be able to take part in this sort</p>
<p> of action.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can't, Peter, give a detailed operational response to</p>
<p> that because the actual process of putting together the additional</p>
<p> brigade and all that goes into it is really a matter for the people</p>
<p> in uniform and not for prime ministers and ministers. But I do understand</p>
<p> from what I have been told by the Chief of the Defence Force that</p>
<p> there could be some reserve contribution but the precise level of</p>
<p> that and how it might occur I can't answer.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, thanks Peter. Mr Howard, on something else the Jeff Kennett</p>
<p> defamation which I am sure you would have known something or read</p>
<p> something about, and he has lost the case. Do you think this indicates</p>
<p> that public figures, or politicians particularly, are fair game?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't want to comment about Jeff's case. I mean,</p>
<p> I haven't discussed it with him, I have read about it. I don't</p>
<p> think it's fair or right or proper of me to talk about what his</p>
<p> office has called a private legal matter. And I am not going to do</p>
<p> that. Are politicians fair game? Well, no, I don't think they</p>
<p> are fair game but when you go into public life you naturally cop a</p>
<p> fair bit. But I can understand any public figure getting angry when</p>
<p> allegations about their personal behaviour which aren't true</p>
<p> are made. Now, that's a general statement. I think all of us</p>
<p> value our reputations. We are certainly very sensitive when anything</p>
<p> is said that involves our families, our wives, our children, our husbands,</p>
<p> our children, our loved ones. That's perfectly human.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I guess that's the point, I mean, you have to cop too much, has</p>
<p> it perhaps moved a little do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think it's more invasive and intrusive than it used to</p>
<p> be but that's the character of life generally. We are a lot more</p>
<p> disrespectful of personal privacy and taste and civility now than</p>
<p> we used to be. Now, in one sense, people rejoice in that as a marvellous</p>
<p> expression of freedom and liberal thinking and liberal behaviour yet</p>
<p> we pay a price so far as civility is concerned and courtesy. It's</p>
<p> very very difficult for me to sort of lay down some kind of standard</p>
<p> about it. I don't think people in public life should be fair</p>
<p> game.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Have you ever sued anyone?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. I've never issued any writs. I've felt like it on occasions</p>
<p> and once or twice I've got some advice to do it. But as to whether</p>
<p> I should do it, but I have never sued, no. In 25 years I have never</p>
<p> sued.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well maybe I haven't felt strongly enough about what people have</p>
<p> said about me. Maybe I haven't been as heavily defamed as others.</p>
<p> Look, I'm not claiming that as a virtue. I'm certainly not</p>
<p> claiming that as a virtue, and look every individual has a perfect</p>
<p> right to defend his or her reputation. And any of my colleagues, whether</p>
<p> they're in State politics or Federal politics who take action</p>
<p> to defend their reputation, well they have a perfect right to do so.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, cricket. Now something close to your heart. But I wonder</p>
<p> if these anti- siphoning laws are just not working. The fact that</p>
<p> we can't even see highlights of that magnificent win against</p>
<p> the West Indies on free-to-air television.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's a hard one. I don't know that they're not</p>
<p> working. It's my understanding that the law was followed and</p>
<p> no offers were forth coming in relation to the free-to-air telecast.</p>
<p> And your concern is whether you ought to be able to have highlights.</p>
<p> Well the problem is that when do highlights stop being highlights</p>
<p> and become a telecast.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, they were offered but they say the price was too high which</p>
<p> is an easy way to guarantee exclusivity isn't it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Neil, I'm a great advocate of cricket being available at</p>
<p> the lowest possible cost to the greatest number of people. That applies</p>
<p> to all sports. On the other hand people are entitled if they buy a</p>
<p> product to get value for it. I'll have a look at it but I don't</p>
<p> want to signal by that response that we're going to change the</p>
<p> existing arrangements which we think in a difficult situation aren't</p>
<p> too bad. But I can understand people being angry they couldn't</p>
<p> see an extended version of that win.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Applying it to all sports, you're aware the dispute from the</p>
<p> ABC and the AFL. The ABC not wanting to provide AFL coverage in inter-state,</p>
<p> and the AFL pulling the plug. I mean the principles apply there.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think there are some different considerations there aren't</p>
<p> there. I don't think that's quite on the piece with the</p>
<p> siphoning laws.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>No, no it's not. But it's the same principle of being available</p>
<p> as broadly as possible.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah it is. Look everybody wants to watch sport. There's an overwhelming</p>
<p> view in the Australian community that major sporting events, and that</p>
<p> obviously includes test cricket and the AFL football if it includes</p>
<p> anything, and it includes a lot more as well. They are events that</p>
<p> should be available free to air, but it's also a very...telecast</p>
<p> rights and broadcast rights are a very valuable commodity and trying</p>
<p> to strike a balance between those two is sometimes difficult. And</p>
<p> the anti-siphoning laws are an attempt to, as it were, excise from</p>
<p> straight commercial considerations, major events like the AFL and</p>
<p> test cricket. And normally it works. Sometimes it doesn't work</p>
<p> so well.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The Telstra legislation. If that's blocked if there is not more</p>
<p> sold, what does that do to your budget strategy? You're relying</p>
<p> on that money aren't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's part of the budget for future years but it doesn't</p>
<p> fundamentally alter the position that our budget is in a healthy position.</p>
<p> The reason we want to sell Telstra is that we think you'll end</p>
<p> up with a more competitive and effective telecommunications carrier</p>
<p> and it really is silly being, to use that old expression, half pregnant</p>
<p> when it comes to the ownership of our public....ownership of our</p>
<p> major telecommunications company, what is now the largest company</p>
<p> in Australia.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But if it's not sold you'll have to cut your costs surely?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's not going to have a dramatic effect. What it will mean is</p>
<p> that some of the investment we would like to make in improving communications</p>
<p> in rural Australia won't be able to be made. And people who are</p>
<p> stopping the further sale of interests in Telstra are really voting</p>
<p> against us spending hundreds of millions of dollars on upgrading communications</p>
<p> facilities in the bush.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It's a brave week in the Senate isn't it with Senator Harradine.</p>
<p> John Elliott amongst other things suggested the discussions going</p>
<p> on between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party about altering the</p>
<p> power of the Senate. Is that true?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well if they are I'm not involved in them.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well presumably you'd know.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, there aren't.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Chris, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Chris.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>And Neil. Mr Howard, I was very interested to hear you suggest before</p>
<p> that we're such good friends with the East Timorese, especially</p>
<p> during the Second War and afterwards. I was just curious, we haven't</p>
<p> been that friendly with them for the last 20</p>
