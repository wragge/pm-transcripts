TPANISCRJPT OF<br />
FRESS AND T. V. INT* E1, V7E WIJTH THE PR. LME MIN-iSTER THE.<br />
ROTN0. OG~ iZES AT L ONDON AIRPORT ON MA: Y 3,1<br />
your rea ctions -to the aercement that w-, as reach~ ed. i* n<br />
Brussels ycsterday on Coemmonaaith~ manufactured &amp; Dods?<br />
PR7M MINISTER-That's rather a difficult quiestion to ' answer because<br />
I ' ye read. about it in -the press flying over from Geneva,<br />
but Ilve not heard any oficial acco-unt of ityet, and<br />
thnerefore I speak with. some caution. B~ ut I -ima,; iJne that<br />
an agreement of thLis kind can hardly be treatled as : 1final_<br />
I don't know, because we're to have a Prime Minister's<br />
conference in September and it's h-ard to believe that we<br />
wlhave a series of arc, 1tsbefore thn. which will<br />
render the conferonce unnecessary0 So I take it t, hat t.-his<br />
has somie tentative quality. In so far as it appears to<br />
recogn,. se a cut-off pointL,, or what's been called a<br />
precipice, thor of course that's not quite our cup of tea0<br />
W4o want -to have arrangements made thiatl are fairly permanent,<br />
of steady quality, They may not be identical with the<br />
old prefere,. nc-es thiat have caxis ted which-have gone on and<br />
on and might hiave been expected to go on fLor a long time,<br />
but(-in substance we? rn locking for arrangements that hiavke<br />
some pormanent and protective quality, giving out an<br />
opportunity of prescrv: Lng our trade patti. rns and of<br />
growing as an economy, ThL-is is tGramondu-.: sy important<br />
-to us, and 1' think iL-s very im:, portqnt1V for Great Britain,<br />
perhaps more important than P. lot of people here think.<br />
Because we're an enormous customer of Great Britain, and<br />
therefore weo provide many thcusands of people in this<br />
country with jobs,~ It's very imrortant to you, Jtis viery<br />
important to us, very -Laortant frT the Cornionealth., and<br />
so all 1 can say is-that this does represent a final<br />
arrcangemaent of some kind., _ hnh ope it doesnt represent<br />
what I mieght ocaLl a ZeCnerai pattern fLor-those agreements,<br />
because if i~ t ( lid it wvould r-iutn counter -to the ideas th. a t<br />
have boon pat p<br />
Ubf'ich rather ibrings me to -that secorid questi. onn you<br />
ha3ve in you., min, iy coL1eague MiIrr . icLia. Tn, has been<br />

Ministcrs arc su-, posed -to engage in whe-n theoy meat cacn<br />
otheir, but no subtractions fromPj what Mr0McEwen has been<br />
putt--'-ing)<br />
Q. Would. you sayr th-1at the possikbility of this loosening<br />
of Commonwalthi tiecs is a muchi more c-. ctio1nal matter in<br />
Au7st ralia int is heora In D: rita-Ln?<br />
P. M. 0 Well, I don't !, now what the oionis hero on t ; his<br />
ma tte. of course., o, ti, a traditionally very St 0ongl1y<br />
Cc~: mnw~ atI~ r cadod bul% I~ yer been an ol~ d Comm-nwca~ t<br />

So I don't know.<br />
QUESTION NOT CLEAR 000 0 ( 3 </p>
<p>P. M. Dontt forget this, that we in Australia could h-ave simply<br />
said 1Look,~ there'~ s nothling doing , e have : prre-ferentJa<br />
arrangemients wit roi,,, they~ ve been zoin on for years,<br />
Thaey arc! satisfaCtor*, r tC' u) S they are sati-sfac; ory to you,<br />
yoen must choose between continuing that way and going int'Uo the<br />
European Economic Coazmmnity." M'Tat would have been legitimate<br />
, uould't it? But we h-aven't done i~ t ie hIave, in facu,<br />
outstandingly said 11dell put our officials down with yours3",<br />
we've -? one to all th people in the Faropean countries<br />
concerned, Doctor Westerman made a long and careful<br />
analysed statemen~ t on a series of commodities,, ' Je've done<br />
all these things because we've said., in effect 11' iol we<br />
wont stand on tI; ho letter of the if you can rnego~ iate<br />
a series of conditions for us whiich enable uis in s'l. bstanco<br />
to preserve our pattern of trade and -to grow economically<br />
thein whether you call it A or B, we won~ t arrie about that;<br />
we're looking for the subs) tance." 1 And so, oiitstandingl1y, the<br />
Astraliunnegctiators have been constructive very persistent<br />
IVve no doubt, and they need to be per. sistent, constructive,<br />
not standing on a letter but locking to the Lubstance. And<br />
that, I think, is a pretty good approach.<br />
QUIESTION NOT CLEAR:<br />
P M. I am not passing a judgr~ lont. I am not saying wihichi, in<br />
theo end result, is to be preferred, but I cannot believe myself<br />
thlat if Great Britain goes into Burcpo and becomes a member<br />
of the polit~ ical orga-n~ sati-on, I can't believe that hor relations<br />
wit.. 4h thle Comonealth countries will bce as t! ie: Xiblo or-let'Is<br />
say, as independent as they have been in thoe past. That's<br />
net to say -that I am saying you must11 not do it. Not that tl~: it<br />
would cut much ice anyhow, but 1, not saying that. But<br />
I am saying that I don't think that the, Co~ rnoiwcalth will be<br />
theo sameo as it was bofore, As -the Commr-onwalth has been<br />
ch-ianging very very oap'idl~ r for a long time nowr, I suppose<br />
one ffurther change might be acceptable to a lot of pecple0<br />
All T sa-y is, the~ ro wil L a change. Gruat Britain as part<br />
of srpcas an -Into g-r-od partner in &amp; iropoan highl policy,<br />
could hardly be as ndepondent a membe-r of thG Commonw_ ea lth<br />
aS sho has been in thec. prst, thatts all. I Merely State itas<br />
a fac.., I've got pest argui-ng about it<br />
Q. You Jet ar obviously as a cha-nge, fox-tae worso?<br />
P. M1 From the Comr=' oalth point of view. As long as you<br />
under-tand that it eco a change for the better from tho<br />
point of view of iworld security,, of a poucrorfui 1Europo-, a<br />
powerful third g-roat Po;.-er in tewovld this may be'very<br />
good, My observation is nolb to say that trtat's a bad tig<br />
but that the Coimaonwoa1 th will no longor be th11e same thing<br />
as it wa-s before. Well, I suppose th. at's clear enougA,<br />
Q. Do you in fact, 101r, Pvrme Minisater, envisage Britaints<br />
rol.. e in Europe. if it goes in, exclusively in te) rrs of its<br />
bercorji*. ri g a memk-fbr of Q world po,, wer, or do you t17ir'-thiat<br />
Britain has a choicee of staying out and of building l inks with<br />
countries like yourself~' Do ycu think we have a real choiceo?<br />
P 14, Well, look, 1 wouldni t like to answer that quaes-tion<br />
because while the econoic iniplic. aGJions-of tha TrTetnty o-f Rome<br />
arIthink, brcoadly cle1-, aK enougi-, the!., poliie. l implications<br />
a-re as yet not clelnrly to be soeen. Be causce thiey ir: Ll, I<br />
think, deve. lop0 It nay be tlnist the ir. tovio difi~ croncos<br />
be: tween th Si~ x IEurcrpan countric-s will continueo to assert<br />
themselv: Cs politically, Th-at? s very-much en the-L cards, and<br />
if SO tho political -i. rn, L*-, rticn wilbe mach slower than the<br />
a c u * 0 s </p>
<p>P M.<br />
( Contd) PQM, econoric integration, We can't tell at this stage what<br />
fo.-m any political integration will taike wheth. eJ. it, ould<br />
be some form of confederacy or whether i6 would be some<br />
form of federation, there being a world of difference<br />
between the two things, Whether it would lead to a<br />
common foreign policy, common high policies on various<br />
matters, is a matter of evolution and, therefore, I am<br />
not proposing to be a prophet about it, But however<br />
far the development goes, or however fast or slowly it<br />
goes, my only point is I don't see the Commonwealth<br />
relationship as remaining unaffected the Commonwealth<br />
relationship, mark you, being a pretty hard thing to<br />
define anyhowo<br />
That being the case, Sir, is it possible to reach<br />
a verdict in September when presumably only one half of<br />
the deal is kno. wn the economic side. The political<br />
implications aren't then fully apparento Is it possible<br />
to reach a verdict?<br />
Look, don't ask me to say what will be possible in<br />
September. All I hoped about September was that by<br />
this time the United Kingdom Government, as a result of<br />
its negotiated work and as a result of all our consultations<br />
and so on, would be able to come to the Prime Ministers<br />
and say " Jell, it looks to us as if this kind of an<br />
arrangement might be got, Now, as this affects all of<br />
you, will you speak up and tell us what you think about<br />
it. We want to get your judgment before we sign on the<br />
dotted lino,:" iell, suppose we had a discussion in<br />
September and, economically, everybody is satisfied,<br />
Canada is satisfied with losing preferences on manufactured.<br />
goods and we are satisfied about something else. You<br />
know, we are all happy in September about the economic<br />
problems. Then I would expect us to say so. And have<br />
these arrangements madco But one thing I believe will<br />
have to occur in September also and that is some consideration<br />
as to the Commonwealth and what has become of it and<br />
what is becoming of ito Because, you know, it is not all<br />
related to the European Common Market, There are all<br />
sorts of problems coming along. There are many now<br />
countries about to come into the Co~ monwealth fieldo<br />
Jhen I first attended the Prime Ministers? meetings, I<br />
wasn't a Prime Ministero That sounds a bit Irish but<br />
I wasn't, I was deputising for one and that was 7 years<br />
ago, And there were five people there and now there are<br />
nine or ten and within a year, probably fourtoen or<br />
fifteeno A good deal of work has been done on this and<br />
if you have a look at the number of former colonies moving<br />
into independenco, this Commonwealth has become a pretty<br />
numerous body. And, of course, when that happens,<br />
obviously we will havo to do a lot of thinking about the<br />
procedures to make it effctiv~ e Unless we are just<br />
going to have a meeting once a year That is a difficult<br />
problem not soluble at this cmment. But I have no doubt<br />
that in September it will come into the picture when we<br />
are discussing th Common Market,, The Comnmon Market<br />
will be the occasion, I think2, for some of those discussions,<br />
Sir, is it your ~ imrpr-esion that the British Government<br />
is jumping the gun on Soptember?<br />
P. M. No, no. </p>
<p>4,<br />
Qo Is that not implied in this agreement reached<br />
last night?<br />
P, M. Now you are asking me to make a comment on an<br />
agreement that I haven't seen but have read about in<br />
a newspaper or two, on which I have no reactions from<br />
my technical people or those who have been conducting<br />
negotiations. Now if I were a newcomer to this business<br />
I would make a lot of inferences in the light of it.<br />
I am not. I have no reason to suppose whatever that<br />
the Government of the United Kingdom won't pay the<br />
greatest attention to what we have to say to them.<br />
If I thought anything else I wouldn't be here.<br />
Qo Does the importance of this meeting in September<br />
make you feel that voting procedures at the Prime<br />
Ministers' conferences might not, after all, be rather<br />
useful?<br />
P. M. What sort of procedures?<br />
Qo Voting procedures, etc.<br />
P. M. Oh, don't try to sell that to meo Look, there's<br />
one thing that is an article of faith with me. It is<br />
that the Commonwealth is not a committee of the United<br />
Nations. And that it doesn't have votes. When it<br />
becomes a committee of the United Nations and has votes<br />
I hope and believe that I will no longer be Prime<br />
Minister and no longer have to submit to such atrocities,<br />
Not a bad word, atrocities, for that either. Move a<br />
resolution, go round the corner, see if somebody will<br />
support an amendment; argue about sub-clause get<br />
a motion carried, What does the minority do in the<br />
Commonwealth? Suppose Australia is outvoted in the<br />
Commonwealth voto? ' That do we do? Go and bow three<br />
times, and say, " Certainly, we will alter our policy<br />
to please youo" Not on your life, That's not the way<br />
the Commonwealth has worked.<br />
Qo But is unanimity possible on such an issue as this?<br />
P. M, But we've never had unanimity. That's why woeve<br />
never taken votes, perhaps. It's rather a perverse<br />
way of putting it, but the only thing that's unanimous<br />
out of a Prime Ministers' conference is the communique<br />
not a word in which can appear unless everybody agrees.<br />
And that's why these communiques are such frightful<br />
collections of platitudes they're the one thing or<br />
two things or three things that everybody can agree about.<br />
Qo Mr. Prime Minister, the problem for Australia is,<br />
of course, rather agricultural than manufactured goods<br />
and we have been hearing it suggested that Australia<br />
might find alternative markets for her agricultural<br />
goods in South Fast Asia. W'ould you envisage this<br />
as being so?<br />
P. M. I think we have boen doing our best to develop them<br />
for a long tine, But you nustnit assume that you can<br />
get an alternative market for the whole sweep of our<br />
agricultural products, because scme of then have been<br />
developed with particular reference to the markets here<br />
in Great Britain. Dried fruits, canned fruits are<br />
perfect examples. But I would just like to :. ake one<br />
slight correcticn, You say our great intorost is not<br />
in manufactured g o If you ean by that that we<br />
C901: 000920615 </p>
<p>PMo<br />
( Contdo) Q. P. M.<br />
Q. P. M. don't have the same volume of exports of manufactures<br />
however that may be defined, as, say, Canada, the fact<br />
is that we are a very great manufacturing country and<br />
people seem to assume that the whole problem presented<br />
by the Common Market is the export problem. That's<br />
not the only problem. If in fact the result of the<br />
Common Market and Great Britain going into it is that<br />
there is a tremendous exporting capacity, additional<br />
exporting capacity in manufactures developed in the<br />
European community, with reduced costs and all that<br />
kind of thing, the Australian manufacturer is going<br />
to have an interest in this, because he will be submitted<br />
to the most enormous additional competition and may have<br />
to come more and more frequently to the government and<br />
the authorities to ask for some protection. I mention<br />
that to show that, after all, trade is two ways. We<br />
know thato We sometimes forget it. This Common<br />
Market argument does operate both ways. As exporters,<br />
of course, we are primarily in the primary industry<br />
fiold, the agricultural, pastoral field.<br />
May I ask you, Sir, if you resent the American<br />
pressures on the British Covernment on entry into the<br />
Common Market?<br />
Well, I would prefer to discover for myself what<br />
these pressures are before commenting on them. I will<br />
be seeing the President of the United States and so on<br />
when I have finished here. Well, I think it's time<br />
I went to the hotel. I'm seeing your Prime Minister<br />
tonight. If some of you will give me a paper of what<br />
I have said I will be able to give it to him.<br />
Before you go, Sir, is your arrival here today<br />
significantly connected with the forthcoming Test Match<br />
or is that pure coincidence?<br />
Noe I don't even know whoro the Test Match is.<br />
And if it's any comfort to you, I wontt be there,<br />
There is a type of newspapjr man who lives on the<br />
assumption that in the sunmr-. I never do anything else<br />
but go to test natches,, it's a newspaper logend.<br />
I go to as many as I can. I see, on the average, two<br />
and a half days in the course of the season, </p>
