    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Federal Government will provide a grant of almost $259, 000 towards Nowra's leading white mould cheese production and packaging line expansion project.</p>
<p>Snow Brand Australia, based in Nowra, manufactures camembert and brie cheese in the traditional French method and is currently the number one Camembert supplier to the Australian domestic market.</p>
<p>The funds will assist Snow Brand Australia to commence a planned $2 million expansion program that will prove both jobs and economic benefits for the Nowra region. It will secure the employment of the current factory staff of 21 people and create at least 8 new jobs within the factory and administration.</p>
<p>The expansion project, involving the introduction of a mechanised production line and the associated curing and refrigeration cool rooms, is expected to increase annual cheese production by more than 120 tonnes.</p>
<p>Demand for an additional two million litres of milk - a doubling of the existing milk requirement - will provide an additional outlet for dairy farms in the region.</p>
<p>The funds have been provided under the Dairy Regional Assistance Programme, which funds new projects around Australia in communities affected by dairy deregulation. So far, 93 projects have been supported.<br />
The Federal Government recently announced $140 million supplementary assistance to the dairy industry, part of which has been allocated to the Dairy Regional Assistance Programme bringing total funding available for this programme to $65 million.</p>
<p>The Expansion of White Mould Cheese Production and Packaging Line project is a significant investment by the Commonwealth Government and will have a positive impact in the Nowra region. </p>
