    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Honourable Ian Macfarlane, Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, has undergone throat surgery this week.</p>
<p>Pathology reports have confirmed the presence of an early stage tumour on the vocal chords requiring radiation therapy.</p>
<p>Mr Macfarlane will be required to remain in Brisbane during the treatment period. Accordingly, the Minister will be on leave - effective immediately - and for the duration of the treatment which is expected to be 6 - 8 weeks.</p>
<p>I have appointed the Hon. Joe Hockey as acting Minister while Mr Macfarlane is on leave.</p>
<p>I am sure all Members of Parliament would join me in wishing Mr Macfarlane a full and speedy recovery.</p>
