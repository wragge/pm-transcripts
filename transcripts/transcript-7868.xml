PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 12 JANUARY 1990<br />
The Chairman of the National Selectors, Mr Lawrie Sawle, and<br />
I have selected the following team to represent the<br />
Prime Minister's XI against Pakistan at Manuka Oval on<br />
31 January: Allan Border ( Captain) Queensland<br />
Michael Bevan ACT and South Australia<br />
Jamie Cox Tasmania<br />
Damien Fleming Victoria<br />
Wayne Holdsworth New South Wales<br />
Darren Lehmann South Australia<br />
Joe Scuderi South Australia<br />
Steve Storey Queensland<br />
Mike Veletta Western Australia<br />
Mark Waugh New South Wales<br />
Tim Zoehrer( Wicket Keeper) Western Australia<br />
Matthew Wade ( 12th Man) A. C. T.<br />
I am particularly pleased that this year's side has a strong<br />
emphasis on youth. The AIS Commonwealth Bank Cricket Academy<br />
has three representatives in Michael Bevan ( following in<br />
Greg Irvine's footsteps as the second ACT player to be<br />
selected), Jamie Cox, and Joe Scuderi.<br />
Damien Fleming, Wayne Holdsworth, Darren Lehmannn and<br />
Steve Storey have all made valuable contributions to their<br />
respective Sheffield Shield teams this season, with Darren<br />
Lehmann in particular producing a series of electrifying<br />
performances. The inclusion of Mike Veletta, Mark Waugh and Tim Zoehrer<br />
adds an element of experience, and the opportunity to play<br />
under the great Allan Border is something all the players<br />
will benefit from.<br />
I am confident that this team will provide tough competition<br />
for Imran Khan's Pakistan team which has built up an<br />
qenviable international record in recent years and includes<br />
