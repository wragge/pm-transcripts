of the sesqui-centennial of the first settlement in Victoria,<br />
by the Hentys at Portland, followed one year later by<br />
the settlement at Melbourne.<br />
The grant follows discussions with the Chairman of the<br />
Sesqui-centennial Committee, Sir John Holland.<br />

identifiable and suitable project and further discussions<br />
will be held to determine the nature of this project.<br />
