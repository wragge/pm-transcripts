FOR PRESS DISCUSSION ON RESTRICTIVE TRADE PW4CTICES<br />
Statement bV tq. Prime Minister,_ th t. Hn Sir Robr<br />
Menzie s<br />
Over a considerable period of time,<br />
Ministers have heard representations and comments from<br />
various representative groups in relation to the proposed<br />
Trade Practices Legislation. These have proved of<br />
considerable value to us in considering a very complex<br />
problem. 1e indicated to these groups that we wiould<br />
hear them again before actually introducing a bill. We<br />
have done this today. The bill will be introduced tonight<br />
but the debate will not be resumed until the Budget Session<br />
after the Parliamentary recess. There will, therefore, be<br />
ample time for us to consider all the comments we have<br />
heard and, of course, such further comments as will emerge<br />
when the terms of the bill become public knowledge and those<br />
affected have had a full opportunity for closely studying<br />
those terms.<br />
