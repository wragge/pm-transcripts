PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED. BY JOHN LAWS, RADIO STATION 2UE<br />
TELEPHONE INTERVIEW.<br />
( QUESTIONS NOT AUDIBLE)<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
Good morning to you. I'm fine thank you.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
Oh, there's always something to do.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
Yes we did.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We've modified it. We have not done it for a simple reason:<br />
we believed in the wage bargaining process, that it was<br />
relevant and that it was important to be able to demonstrate<br />
that there is a body that can cast an eye over the kind of<br />
pricing policies that are sometimes charged by large corporations.<br />
I do not particularly like the sort of role that the PJT<br />
takes. If' you have-perfect and reasonable competition -you ' would<br />
not need it. But you do not always have that situation. We<br />
made the judgement that we should not abolish the PJT on<br />
industrial relations grounds.-on no other grounds.<br />
Question / 2 3q~ j </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Oh, never is a very long word, isn't it? It really is.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
The present decision is to continue with the PJT. The charter<br />
of course, has been altered substantially from that which<br />
prevailed in 1975. It is a less burdensome body on inc~ ustries<br />
than it then was. * I think occasionally it has got its<br />
uses. fr~ estion<br />
Prime Minister<br />
And if necessary, what we have said, we will do, because<br />
I think if companies are going to or the wealthier companiesare<br />
going to do side deals for a 35 hour week and then that<br />
starts to run right throughout the whole economy, you will be<br />
adding in effect an average of over 20%, 21%, to the total<br />
wage bill in Australia. On that basis, of course, we are<br />
going to produce less. We will sell less overseas. We will<br />
sell less in Australia, and more people will unemployed. . We<br />
could see no reason why the wealthier companies should make<br />
it more difficult for everyone else and do their own<br />
sweetheart deals which they would seek to get registered<br />
before the Arbitration Commission. Therefore, we fired one or<br />
two warning shots over the bow. 35 hours, or 40 hours which<br />
is the official working week for most Australians*-is not a<br />
very long working week. I do not how often you have worked<br />
only I have read what you said on the weekend, but I do not<br />
know how often you have worked only 35 or 40 hours a week.<br />
I suspect not very often.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
If it is 4-35 hours'pay, but that is quite a different. matter.<br />
If somebody wants to work 35 hours a week and have a reduction<br />
in wages as a result so that the hourly rates are the same<br />
then that is quite a different matter. But nobody is asking<br />
for that. Nobody is suggesting that. What, they are. saying, is:<br />
" let's have the same pay but work less hours for And if<br />
they are going to work the same hours they will get overtime<br />
rates for the extra five hours. All that results in aL<br />
substantial increase in real wages. It is that that would do<br />
the damage to Australian industries, which are now sta~ rting to<br />
do better here and they are starting to get into export<br />
markets some of them in quite an imaginative way. / 3 j </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
I think probably it would work out on the basis that if:<br />
you got two companies producing the same kind of commodity<br />
and one of them is only working a 35 hour week, I suspect<br />
there is no way it would be able to produce a competitive<br />
tender. Question Prime Minister<br />
What we said is that this is one of the things we would. examine.<br />
But the main weaponry we have in this particular matte: r was<br />
to say that there could be a PJT pricing inquiry into companies<br />
that gave into a 35 hour week. We were doing that on the basis<br />
that we believed it would damage the Australian economy and at<br />
the same time it would make it much harder for those who are<br />
presently unemployed. I think the grounds for doing that<br />
sometimes we have had companies saying to us " look, we don't<br />
like this sort of weapon you know, but at least it strengthens<br />
our hand very much in negotiations with the union movement".<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
I think they had made a deal significantly beforehand. I have<br />
not had a report yet on some discussions a couple of"<br />
Ministers had with the tobacco industry yesterday.<br />
My understanding is that it was not a 35 hour week that had<br />
been negotiated, that there was a productivity arrangement.<br />
But I have not had a report from the Ministers about.: t: hat yet.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
I do not know that a Government will ever be satisfied with the<br />
way wages are fixed. I think the centralised system of fixing<br />
wages in Australia is probably as good as any system that we<br />
could have within the Australian context. The alternative,<br />
of course, is to let all industries just go out and negotiate<br />
on their own account.<br />
Question / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There is nothing wrong with that, so long as all the<br />
I think you need to look at the history of it. Unions used<br />
to be weak. Employees used to be weak. The Arbitration<br />
Commission was established in a very real way to provide<br />
a protection against what could be large and powerful<br />
companies and the actions of those companies. Over many,<br />
many years, the Arbitration Commission provided that<br />
protection, provided a minimum wage, and provided a basiclevel<br />
of-security and fairness for Australian working mnen<br />
and women. But now, you have a situation where it is the<br />
unions that are more powerful. Even the larger companies<br />
do not carry-the same kind of weight, the same kind of power,<br />
as many of the unions do which have incomes of up to<br />
$ 8 * million or: $ 10 million a year one or two of them.<br />
On that sort of basis, I am not sure that you now do not<br />
need the protection of the Arbitration Commission and system<br />
to protect the interests of a number of companies that would,<br />
in other circumstances, be pushed to the wall. If we had a<br />
union leadership that showed itself concerned for unemploymentand<br />
behaving reasonably in its wage claims, then that would<br />
be one thing. Under those circumstances collective bargaining<br />
might work. But here, we have had it made perfectly plain<br />
to us that union leadership will go for maximum wage increases,<br />
irrespective of the impact on their own members in terms of<br />
employment and all the rest, irrespective of the damage they<br />
do to industries.. Under those circumstances, I think you might<br />
be making.' it very difficult for smaller industries, smaller<br />
companies, if you just said " there is no Arbitration Commission,<br />
go right back to collective bargaining".<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
No, I do not. I think if under it, companies gave in to higher<br />
and higher wages, wage demands, it would add to unempl~ oyment.<br />
One of the other things which has happened in Australia is that<br />
whether it is called comparative wage justice or whatever<br />
you have a person doing the same job in Melbourne, in Sydney,<br />
in Wollongong and Bour " ke, Alice Springs-if he is doing the same<br />
job with the same sort of classification he gets the same pay.<br />
But the bloke-working in Sydney might be working for a very<br />
profitable company which could afford to pay-more. Th.-e other<br />
companies might be much less profitable and less able to pay<br />
more. If they all had to pay the wage rates that the Sydney<br />
company is paying, the other companies go bankrupt and the<br />
people become unemployed, If unions were prepared to accept<br />
that, on a collective bargaining basis, that people doing the<br />
same work were getting, or could get, different rates of pay,<br />
because different companies in different parts of the country<br />
were in different economic positions, then again, it -might make<br />
collective bargaining easier. But unions do not accept that<br />
principle. Question, </p>
<p>Prime Minister<br />
Not under their present leadership, no.<br />
gues tion<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, the companies were saying that could mean dearer<br />
petrol. What has happened under the present system of<br />
marketing of course, is that there has been very great price<br />
cutting in some of the capital cities; price cutting, or<br />
competition or whatever you want to call it. So the people<br />
who have benefitted from that are those who live in capital<br />
cities, not those who live outside them-where'that kin~ d of<br />
competition has not prevailed. I think it is has occu~ rred<br />
in a significant measure because the oil companies have more<br />
and more got into direct selling through commission agents<br />
and whatever. They have put a pressure on the retailing<br />
industry, which in effect has been driving a large number of<br />
retailers out of business. It is all very well to say that<br />
competition should be free and that there should be no<br />
restraints on it. But when you have a collection of small<br />
business people which the petrol retailers are and large<br />
and powerful oil companies on the other hand, the competition<br />
is not free, because the weights are just too much on one side<br />
of the scale. If you had free and perfect competition, well<br />
government should keep right out of it. But the very fact that<br />
if a company has a large influence over a market or industry<br />
because of its size and then tends to drive out small people,<br />
well than that is something that I think governments * need to<br />
be concerned about. I think one of the almost one of the<br />
worst decisions that was ever made in Australia was the<br />
abolition of resale price maintenance. Mr. Hawke was fighting<br />
for the abolition of resale price maintenance. on the basis,<br />
I suppose, that it was going-to help Bourke's Store,. but what<br />
it has done is to help all the large supermarkets and makL-e it<br />
very difficult for the small family store which used to be<br />
a hallmark of country towns and suburban's1 ipping centres.<br />
It made it very difficult for them to survive. All rightin<br />
some senses that might be progress. But I'think somethingz<br />
very sad would happen in Australia if we did not try.-and keep<br />
small business and family businesses together in the kind of<br />
economic organisation which enabled those businesses to prosper.<br />
That really goes to heart of. much of the reason for the<br />
package that Mr. Garland announced yesterday.<br />
Question </p>
<p>-6<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, I am sure they will, because they have been squeezing<br />
the retailers. They have been establishing more<br />
and more commission agents, and they have been putting<br />
retailers out of business. You know, it is worth noting that<br />
while the. PJT says that the authorised wholesale price of<br />
petrol is about 31l, or 32Q a litre, in many Melbourne and<br />
Sydney areas the retail price is, in effect,-less than that.<br />
The oil companies supply petrol to different<br />
categories of customers at different wholesale prices. What<br />
they have done, in a sense, is dominated the market.<br />
Question-Prime Minister,<br />
I think it will benefit the private service station operator,<br />
the small businesses if you like. I cannot see why it: should<br />
make any difference at all to the motorist.'-<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
But they-will not have an increase in-the cost. What could<br />
happen is some of the competition which is driving people out<br />
of business might stop. I suppose that could have an impact<br />
in Melbourne and Sydney, or in capital cities. But it is<br />
too early to tell. Some of the retailers have been saying<br />
with the kind of security that the pa'ckage would operate<br />
that they think that in itself would lead to a reduction in<br />
the price of petrol. So I do not really think that the motorist<br />
is going to be affected by the proposals.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
You have got to remember that one of the parts of the package<br />
is that the Government has indicated that the oil com~ panies<br />
should reduce their number of commission agents. This is one<br />
of the things that has been putting pressure in the Taarket, and<br />
putting pressure on the small businesses. I do not r-eally think<br />
that we necessarily want the production, the refining and the<br />
total distribution of oil in Australia to be control-Led by<br />
the oil companies. That is not necessarily my idea of<br />
competition, or the kind of industrial organisation that I<br />
would want to see in Australia. </p>
