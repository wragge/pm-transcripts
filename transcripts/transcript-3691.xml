NOTES FOR THE PRIME INIISTER<br />
FOR THE OPENING OF THE EXHIBITION.*<br />
MODERN MASTERS: MANET TO MATISSE.<br />
AT THE ART GALLERY OF NEW SOUTH WALES.-<br />
SYDNEY,. 9 APRIL 1975<br />
THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ART EXHIBITION<br />
EVER TO COME To AUSTRALIA. AUSTRALIANS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO<br />
TRAVEL HAVE PERHAPSSEEN SOME OF THE WORKS, OR THEIR LIKE,. IN THE<br />
GREAT GALLERIES OF NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE; OTHERS MAY HAVE<br />
SEEN THEM REPRODUCED IN ART BOOKS; BUT THIS IS THE FIRST<br />
OPPORTUNITY THAT THE LARGE PROPORTION OF AUSTRALIANS HAS HAD<br />
TO ENJOY AND SAVOUR THE REAL THING,<br />
CEZANNE. BONNARD,, BRAQUE,. DALI. DUBUFFET.<br />
GAUGUIN,. VAN GOGH,. KLEE AND OTHERS VIE WITH EACH OTHER FOR<br />
PRIDE OF PLACE; AND MANET. MATISSE,. MODIGLIANI. MUNCH,. PICASSO<br />
AND MANY OTHERS VIRTUALLY STUMBLE OVER EACH OTHER TO CLAIM OUR<br />
ATTENTIONt IT WOULD BE AN INVIDIOUS TASK TO TRY TO SINGLE OUT<br />
INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS OR WORKS FOR SPECIAL COMMENT ALL HAVE THEIR<br />
IMPORTANCE AND WE MUST BE THANKFUL TO THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE<br />
EXHIBITION FOR BRINGING THIS VISUAL FEAST TO OUR COUNTRY. m e1 / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
THERE ARE, I BELIEVE, MORE THAN 100 WORKS IN THE<br />
EXHIBITION REPRESENTING THE FINEST IN EUROPEAN ART OVER THE LAST<br />
HALF OF THE 19TH CENTURY AND THE FIRST HALF OF THE 2OTH CENTURY.<br />
THE ROLE OF THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, NEW YORK, IN PUTTING THE<br />
EXHIBITION TOGETHER HAS BEEN CRUCIAL, AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT<br />
TO REMEMBER THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THE MUSEUM HAS<br />
BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING SIGNIFICANT ART EXHIBITIONS TO<br />
AUSTRALIA. OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS 3 EXHIBITIONS HAVE TOURED<br />
AUSTRALIAN GALLERIES UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE MUSEUM' S<br />
INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM.<br />
TO THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART AND OTHER GALLERIES AND<br />
THE PRIVATE COLLECTORS WHO LOANED WORKS FOR THIS EXHIBITIONI<br />
EXTEND THE THANKS OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE, AND I TRUST THAT<br />
THESE VALUABLE WORKS SO GENEROUSLY MADE AVAILABLE MAY NOT<br />
SUFFER FOR BEING HUNG UPSIDE DOWN IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE.<br />
ART TODAY IS VERY MUCH AN INTERNATIONAL -OR SHOULD<br />
ISAY A MULTINATIONAL VENTURE. GREAT EXHIBITIONS ARE OFTEN<br />
SPONSORED BY PRIVATE COMPANIES AND CORPORATIONS. THE ALCOA<br />
FOUNDATION HAS GENEROUSLY CONTRIBUTED $ 150,000 TO THIS<br />
EXHIBITION, AND I SOMETIMES WONDER WHERE MODERN ART WOULD BE<br />
WITHOUT BEER CANS AND TOBACCO. .1s.@ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS, OF COURSE, PLAYING ITS<br />
PART, AS IT QUITE RIGHTLY SHOULD. FIRST, IT HAS INDEMNIFIED THE<br />
OWNERS OF THE WORKS COMPRISING TH4E EXHIBITION AGAINST LOSS OR<br />
DAMAGE TO A TOTAL AMOUNT OF $ US 70 MILLION. WITHOUT THIS<br />
SUPPORT THE EXHIBITION WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE NOT BEEN POSSIBLE<br />
BECAUSE OF THE PROHIBITIVE COSTS OF NORMAL INSURANCE COVER.<br />
I SHOULD ADD THAT THE TREASURER WHO IS UNABLE TO BE WITH US<br />
TONIGHT HAS ASKED ME TO STRESS HIS KEEN INTEREST IN THE SAFETY<br />
OF THE EXHIBITION. SECONDLY, AN IMPORTANT AND CONTINUING ROLE IS<br />
BEING PLAYED BY THE VISUAL ARTS BOARD OF THE AUSTRALIA COUNCIL.<br />
WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS IS MEETING THE TRANSPORT COSTS OF<br />
THE EXHIBITION. THERE IS STILL A LINGERING PREJUDICE AGAINST MODERN<br />
ART IN ALL SOCIETIES. EXHIBITIONS OF GREAT ART WORKS WILL HELP<br />
TO DISPEL THIS; AND IT IS THROUGH REFERENCE TO THE WORKS OF<br />
THE FOUNDING FATHERS OF MODERN PAINTING THAT WE SHALL COME TO<br />
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN ART AROUND US TODAY.<br />
WHEN THE AUSTRALIAN NlATIONAL GALLERY BOUGHT JACKSON<br />
POLLOCK'S BLUJE POLES IN 1973 THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE CRITICISM FROM<br />
PEOPLE WHO KNEW LITTLE ABOUT MODERN PAINTING AND WANTED TO KNOW<br />
EVEN LESS. I REGRET THAT SECTIONS ' OF THE MEDIA DID THEIR<br />
BEST TO PROVOKE PHILISTINE REACTIONS TO THE PURCHASE, THERE IS<br />
A CERTAIN IRONY, THEREFORE, THAT IT WAS A NEWSPAPER, THE MELBOURNE<br />
" HERALD", THAT IN 1939 SPONSORED AN EXHIBITION OF 215 WORKS BY<br />
MANY OF THE ARTISTS REPRESENTED HERE THIS EVENING. iI . iA </p>
<p>IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST MAJOR EXHIBITIONS OF MODERN<br />
ART IN THIS COUNTRY, AND THERE WERE FURIOUS REACTIONS WHEREVER<br />
IT WAS SHOWN, SUCH ATTITUDES PERSIST, BUT I BELIEVE THAT WE NOW<br />
HAVE A BETTER PERSPECTIVE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLACE OF MODERN<br />
ART IN THE HISTORY OF OUR CULTURE,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS MAKING EARNEST EFFORTS TO<br />
PROMOTE AN UNDERSTANDING AND LOVE OF THE ARTS TOWARDS IMPROVING THE<br />
QUALITY OF LIFE OF OUR WHOLE COMMUNITY, OUR PRINCIPAL AGENCY IS<br />
THE AUSTRALIA COUNCIL, WHICH ' ASSISTS, THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE<br />
OF ART AND IS CURRENTLY SPONSORING ( WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN<br />
AFFAIRS) AN EXHIBITION IN EUROPE OF THE WORKS OF TEN AUSTRALIAN<br />
PAINTERS AND SCULPTORS, THE VISUAL ARTS BOARD OF THE COUNCIL<br />
HAS CONTRIBUTED SUBSTANTIALLY TO BRINGING THIS AND OTHER EXHIBITIONS<br />
TO AUSTRALIA, IT MAKES GRANTS DIRECTLY TO ARTISTS; IT MAKES<br />
SUBSIDIES TO BODIES FOR COMMISSIONING WORKS TO BE DISPLAYED IN<br />
PUBLIC; IT MAKES SUBSIDIES TO PUBLIC GALLERIES FOR PURCHASING<br />
AUSTRALIAN WORKS, AND GRANTS TO HELP ESTABLISH ARTISTS' WORKSHOPS<br />
AND PUBLIC GALLERIES AND ASSIST ART SOCIETIES AND GROUPS, THE<br />
BOARD'S BUDGET FOR 1974/ 75 EXCEEDS $ 1 MILLION, THIS IS PART<br />
OF OUR OVERALL BUDGET FOR THE ARTS OF $ 20 MILLION THIS FINANCIAL<br />
YEAR, </p>
<p>IN CANBERRA WE ARE BUILDING A NATIONAL GALLERY<br />
THE ROLE OF WHICH WILL BE TO COMPLEMENT THE WORK OF THE AUSTRALIA<br />
COUNCIL AND OTHER ENTERPRISES, THROUGH PROVIDING FOR ALL TO<br />
ENJOY EXAMPLES OF THE BEST WORKS OF ART AVAILABLE FROM DIFFERENT<br />
PERIODS AND DIFFERENT CULTURES HERE AND ABROAD. THE EMPHASIS<br />
ALWAYS IS ON QUALITY. AUSTRALIA IS BY NO MEANS WITHOUT DISTINCTION IN<br />
INTERNATIONAL ART. IRECALL MY PLEASURE 18 MONTHS AGO WHENI<br />
HEARDOF JOHN ARMSTRONG'S IMPORTANT PRIZE AT THE BIENNALE IN SAO<br />
PAULO. SHORTLY AFTERWARDS, AT THE SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE, I OPENED<br />
THE FIRST BIENNALE OF SYDNEY -AN EVENT WHICH I HOPE WILL COME<br />
TO RANK AMONG THE BEST OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD.<br />
EXHIBITIONS SUCH AS THIS HELP OUR OWN ARTISTS AND<br />
GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPARE THEIR WORK WITH THAT OF<br />
THE GREAT ARTISTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND OTHER PERIODS. THE<br />
COMMUNITY OF SPIRIT, THE HUMANITY COMMON TO ALL ARTISTIC<br />
CREATION, MAY BE FELT AND SHARED DIRECTLY. THE RESULT IS<br />
AN ENRICHMENT OF OUR ARTISTIC EXPERIENCE AND HOPEFULLY A<br />
STIMULATION OF THE ENERGIES AND PERCEPTIONS OF OUR ARTISTS.<br />
IN THE LAST 2L1 HOURS I HAVE RECEIVED REPRESENTATIONS<br />
FROM MANY DISTINGUISHED AUSTRALIAN ARTISTS, WRITERS AND OTHERS<br />
SEEKING TO REMOVE GIFTS OF WORKS OF ART FROM THE PROVISIONS<br />
OF THE INCOME TAX LAWS. I CAN WELL UNDERSTAND THAT MANY GREAT<br />
PUBLIC ART COLLECTIONS HAVE DEPENDED ON PRIVATE BENEFACTORS.<br />
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS QUESTION WILL RECEIVE THE EARNEST<br />
CONSIDERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT, BUT IT IS NOT SOMETHING I CAN<br />
PRONOUNCE UPON AT A MOMENT'IS NOTICE. I BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT<br />
A GOVERNMENT WORKING TO BUILD UP THE FOUNDATIONS OF A GREAT </p>
<p>-6<br />
NATIONAL COLLECTION MUST LOOK AT WAYS OF ENCOURAGING GIFTS<br />
FROM * PRIVATE OWNERS. I WISH THE EXHIBITION EVERY SUCCESS. IAM HONOURED<br />
TO HAVE BEEN INVITED TO OPEN IT. IT WILL BE SHOWN IN SYDNEY<br />
AND MIELBOURNE, AND SPECIAL GRANTS WILL BE MADE BY THE VISUAL<br />
ARTS BOARD TO ENABLE STUDENTS FROM OTHER CITIES AND STATES TO<br />
TRAVEL TO SYDNEY OR M'ELBOURNE TO SEE IT. I PAY TRIBUTE TO THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART; TO WILLIAM<br />
LEIBERMAN, WHO SELECTED THE EXHIBITION AND IS LOOKING AFTER IT IN<br />
AUSTRALIA; TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE MUSEUM OF fM'ODERN ART, MiR<br />
OLDENBURG, AND HIS STAFF; TO THE GALLERIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO<br />
HAVE LENT THEIR WORKS; TO THE ALCOA FOUNDATION AND ALCOA OF<br />
AUSTRALIA; TO THE ART GALLERY OF NEW SOUTH WALES AND THE<br />
NATIONAL GALLERY OF VICTORIA; AND TO ALL WHO HAVEHELPED WITH<br />
THE ASSEMBLING, TRANSPORT AND SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS.<br />
FINALLY, I BELIEVE IT IS A MARK OF THE QUALITY<br />
OF THE EXHIBITION WE HAVE HERE, THAT I UNDERSTAND IT IS TO BE<br />
DISPLAYED AT THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART ON ITS RETURN TO NEW<br />
YORK BEFORE THE WORKS ARE FINALLY DISPERSED ONCE AGAIN TO THEIR<br />
OWNERS. </p>
<p>ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR THE PRIME MIINISTER FOR A DINNER<br />
GIVEN BY ALCOA OF AUSTRALIA AT THE BENNELONG POINT<br />
RESTAURANT, SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE 9 APRIL 1975<br />
1. ALL OF US CAN TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN THE EXHIBITION<br />
OPENED THIS EVENING. IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT THIS<br />
MORE SELECT CELEBRATION SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE OPERA<br />
HOUSE, THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BUILDING IN THIS CITY, A<br />
BUILDING THAT SYMBOLISES ALL THAT IS MOST MODERN AND<br />
VIGOROUS IN OUR ARTISTIC AND CULTURAL LIFE.<br />
2. I MUST SAY IT'S A PLEASURE TO ATTEND A DINNER<br />
GIVEN By ALCOA AND NOT BE EXPECTED TO TALK ABOUT FOREIGN<br />
INVESTMENT OR MINERALS AND ENERGY, AUSTRALIANS DON'T<br />
NORMALLY ASSOCIATE ALCOA WITH THE ARTS, MODERN OR<br />
OTHERWISE. LOOKING AROUND TH IS ROOM, I SEE QUITE<br />
A FEW PEOPLE NOT NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ARTS.<br />
3. ALCOA IS A SPLENDID EXAMPLE OF THE PHILANTHROPIC<br />
FOUNDATION WHICH IS SUCH A NOTABLE FEATURE OF AMERICAN<br />
BUSINESS LIFE. ( IT IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH<br />
BETWEEN THE FOUNDATION AND THE CORPORATION.) ONE THINKS<br />
OF SIMILAR GREAT FOUNDATIONS FORD, CARNEGIE, ROCKEJXFELLER.<br />
THESE BODIES HAVE GIVEN MANY MILLIONS, INDEED BILLIONS,<br />
OF DOLLARS TO THE ARTS, SCIENCE, EDUCATION, MEDICAL<br />
RESEARCH AND OTHER HUMANE CAUSES. THEY HAVE BROUGHT<br />
INESTIMABLE BENEFITS To AMERICAN SOCIETY, AND ENHANCED<br />
THE REPUTATION, NOT ONLY OF INDIVIDUAL CORPORATIQNS,<br />
BUT OF THE UNITED STATES HERSELF,<br />
ll </p>
<p>-2-<br />
4, IN THIS ROOM TONIGHT ARE SOME OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED<br />
REPRESENTATIVES OF AMERICAN ARTISTIC AND BUSINESS LIFE.<br />
I CANNOT REMEMBER A TIME WHEN A MORE CULTIVATED AND<br />
ESTIMABLE GROUP OF AMERICAN CITIZENS VISITED THIS CITY.<br />
I WISH ALL OF. YOU A VERY HAPPY , STAY IN AUSTRALIA. WITHIN<br />
THE NEXT FEW WEEKS I SHALL BE MAKING MY THIRD VISIT TO<br />
THE UNITED STATES AS PRIME MINISTER. I SHALL BE MEETING<br />
PRESIDENT FORD FOR THE SECOND TIME. No ONE IN THIS<br />
COUNTRY DOUBTS THE ENDURING STRENGTH OR IMPORTANCE OF<br />
AUSTRALIA'S LINKS WITH THE UNITED STATES. MY OWN<br />
GOVERNMENT'S FOREIGN POLICIES, WHILE SEEKING WIDER CONTACTS<br />
' WITH OTHER NATIONS AND MORE MATURE AND INDEPENDENT<br />
RELATIONSHIPS WITH COUNTRIES IN OUR REGION, HAS NEVER<br />
DOUBTED THE UNIQUE VALUE OF OUR TIES WITH THE UNITED STATES.<br />
I BELIEVE THE FRIENDSHIP AND UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN OUR<br />
COUNTRIES HAVE NEVER BEEN STRONGER, OR MORE SOUNDLY<br />
BASED, THAN THEY ARE TODAY.<br />
WHATEVER CRITICISMS I MAY HAVE MADE OF PARTICULAR<br />
AMERICAN POLICIES OR DECISIONS, I HAVE BEEN A LIFE-LONG<br />
ADMIRER OF THE TRULY GREAT QUALITIES OF AMERICAN SOCIETY<br />
ITS OPTIMISM, ITS GENEROSITY, ITS ZEST FOR CHANGE, FOR<br />
INNOVATION, FOR SHEER ACCOMPLISHMENT. I BELIEVE WE SEE<br />
MANY OF THESE QUALITIES IN INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE MUSEUM<br />
OF MODERN ART IN NEW YORK AND THE ALCOA FOUNDATION. THE<br />
EXHIBITION OF MODERN MASTERS WILL REMIND US OF THE BEST AND<br />
MOST VIGOROUS STRAINS IN AMERICAN SOCIETY. </p>
