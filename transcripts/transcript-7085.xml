TRANSCRIPT OF COMMENTS AT YAD VASHEM, JERUSALEM, 27 JANUARY 1987<br />
Journalist: Your ' reactions?<br />
PM: Well, I think--that-anyone who wants--to understand-the<br />
commitment of the Jewish people and the creation of the State of<br />
Israel, their commitment to ensuring that Israel will have the right<br />
to exist, the tine to secure and recognise boundaries into the<br />
future, only has to come to Yad Vashem to understand the depth of<br />
that commitment and similarly, I think anyone who tries to understand<br />
the commitment of others to the State of Israel only has to come<br />
to Yad Vashem, that says it all better than any book or any speech.<br />
Journalist: Mr Hawke, the Wiesenthal Institution said yesterday<br />
something about another commitment, a commitment to finding war<br />
criminals, and bringing them to trial, what are you doing about<br />
this?<br />
PM: Well, what we did in Australia when we had information<br />
handed to my colleague Bill Hayd -en in the United States was in<br />
fact in Australia to establish an inquiry under a respected<br />
eminent retired public servant, Mr Mer1lis. We have received<br />
that report, the Government is now considering it and we will in<br />
the light of our considerations' of that report, undertake what<br />
steps are necessary to give effect in our judgement to the<br />
recommendations of Mr Menzies.<br />
Journalist: In your opinion, what should be done?<br />
PM: Well, we're a democracy and<br />
conjunction with my colleagues. I<br />
dictatorial statements. We've had<br />
haven't we.<br />
Journalist: Thank you very much. I will consider that in<br />
don't pronounce in advance<br />
enough of those in the past,<br />
