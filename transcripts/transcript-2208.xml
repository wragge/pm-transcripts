FOR PRESS P. M. No 47/ 1970<br />
COMMONWEALTH CYCLONEASSISTANCE FOR<br />
QUEENSLAND<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Prime Minister has announced the provision of<br />
Commonwealth assistance to the State of Queensland towards the cost<br />
of government assets damaged as a result of cyclone " Ada".<br />
Mr. Gorton said that it is the primary responsibility of<br />
State Governments to meet the cost of restoring government property<br />
damaged by natural disasters such as cyclones. However, where it is<br />
considered that such expenditure by a State would impose an undue<br />
burden on its financial resources, the Commonwealth is prepared to<br />
assist in meeting the cost.<br />
Mr. Gorton said that the amount involved in the present<br />
instance would not normally call for the provision of Commonwealth assistance.<br />
However, he was mindful that the Queensland Government was already<br />
involved in expenditure on natural disaster relief as a result of the<br />
widespread drought in the State in addition the Queensland Government<br />
would be sharing with the Commonwealth the cost of relief for personal<br />
hardship and distress resulting from the cyclone.<br />
In the circumstances, the Prime Minister said, he was pleased<br />
to announce that the Commonwealth was prepared to provide assistalce<br />
on the basis of one half of the cost to the State Government of the<br />
restoration of government assets damaged by cyclone " Ada".<br />
