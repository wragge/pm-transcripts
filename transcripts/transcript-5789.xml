PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SATURDAY APRIL 3 1982<br />
THE VICTORIAN ELECTIONS<br />
Liberals everywhere will be disappointed that nearly three<br />
decades of Liberal government in Victoria have come to an<br />
end. It has been a long and impressive innings. All Victorians<br />
can be proud of this State's achievements under Liberal policies.<br />
The Liberal Government in Victoria was ' the third longest<br />
serving government in Australia's history. We all know that<br />
there have been problems over the last three or four years,<br />
and Lindsay Thompson has made a courageous attempt to turn<br />
it around, but he did not have the time.<br />
I would like to thank Lindsay Thompson and his wife, Joan,<br />
for everything they have done for the Liberal Party, particularly<br />
over this recent difficult period. Lindsay Thompson ' made a<br />
valiant fight of it.<br />
I cona-ratulate Mr Cain on his victory-in this election.<br />
I am sure that Liberals in Victoria will start immediately<br />
to prepare the ground for winning back government at the next<br />
election. This is an opportunity to renew our energies for the<br />
task ahead.<br />
With a Labor government in Victoria, it is more important<br />
than ever for the Federal Liberal Government to provide stable<br />
government in the interests of all Australians at the national<br />
level. This is our greatest responsibility and nothing will<br />
stop us from carrying it out. </p>
