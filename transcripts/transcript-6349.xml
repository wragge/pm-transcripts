SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER BUSINESS LUNCH<br />
MENZIES HOTEL, SYDNEY, 19 MARCH 1984<br />
THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN A MOMENTOUS ONE FOR AUSTRALIA AND, FOR<br />
ITS MOST POPULOUS STATE, NEW SOUTH WALES. IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE<br />
WITNESSED A MARKED CHANGE IN OUR ECONOMIC FORTUNES,. REFLECTED<br />
PARTICULARLY IN A LARGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF AUSTRALIANS<br />
WHO HAVE JOBS.<br />
IN THIS, THE WRAN LABOR GOVERNMENT OF NEW SOUTH WALES,<br />
THE PEOPLE OF NEW SOUTH WALES, THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY OF<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES, AND THE UNION MOVEMENT OF NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
HAVE MADE A VITAL CONTRIBUTIONS<br />
WE ARE NOW BEGINNING THE SECOND YEAR OF OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY.<br />
A YEAR AGO THE ECONOMY WAS IN THE GRIP OF THE WORST RECESSION<br />
IN FIFTY YEARS. DROUGHT BLIGHTED THE RURAL SECTOR.<br />
PRIVATE SPENDING-WAS WEAK. REAL DOMESTIC PRODUCT DECLINED<br />
BY SOME 2 PER CENT IN 1982-83, THE FIRST SUCH FALL SEEN<br />
IN 3-0 YEARS AND THE HIGHEST SINCE 1946-47.<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT HAD RISEN BY OVER 250,000 DURING THE PRECEDING<br />
YEAR, SO THAT NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION AUSTRALIANS<br />
WERE OUT OF WORK. TNFLATION STOOD AT 11,5 PER CENT,. MORE<br />
THAN DOUBLE THE OECD AVERAGE. INTEREST RATES WERE EXCESSIVELY </p>
<p>NEW SOUTH WALES SHARED IN THE DOWNTURN, INDEED, BECAUSE<br />
OF THE STATE'S HIGH CONCENTRATION OF MANUFACTURING<br />
INDUSTRIES AND THE EXTREME SEVERITY OF THE DROUGHT IN<br />
THIS STATE, CONTRACTION IN THE PERIOD BEFORE WE TOOK<br />
OFFICE WAS PARTICULARLY SEVERE IN NEW SOUTH WALES,<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT INCREASED BY OVER 100,000 OR 68 PER CENT<br />
OVER THE COURSE OF 1982-83,<br />
BUT TODAY THERE IS A BASIS FOR MUCH GREATER OPTIMISM,<br />
THE BREAKING OF THE DROUGHT HAS SEEN A MAJOR AND MUCH<br />
NEEDED REVIVAL IN THE RURAL SECTOR, BECAUSE THE DROUGHT<br />
WAS MORE SEVERE IN NEW SOUTH WALES, THE RECOVERY IN<br />
RURAL ACTIVITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PRONOUNCED THAN<br />
ELSEWHERE,<br />
THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY WHICH IS NOW UNDERWAY EXTENDS<br />
WELL BEYOND THE UPTURN IN THE RURAL SECTOR, NEW SOUTH<br />
WALES IS PARTICIPATING STRONGLY IN THE MORE GENERAL<br />
IMPROVEMENT IN THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT,<br />
THERE WAS STRONG EVIDENCE OF THE BREADTH OF NATIONAL<br />
ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN THE SEPTEMBER QUARTER NATIONAL<br />
ACCOUNTS, </p>
<p>THESE SHOW THAT NON-FARM PRODUCTION HAD RECOVERED<br />
THE GROUND LOST OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR, HAVING RISEN BY<br />
2.3 PER CENT IN THE QUARTER.<br />
THE PATTERN OF THE TURNAROUND IN THE SEPTEMBER QUARTER<br />
WAS MUCH AS EXPECTED, THOUGH THE PACE OF THE IMPROVEMENT<br />
WAS MUCH STRONGER THAN ECONOMIC FORECASTERS HAD<br />
ANTICIPATED. THE STIMULUS TO GROWTH CAME FROM AN IMPROVEMENT IN<br />
PRIVATE SECTOR INTEREST IN HOLDING INVENTORIES, PUBLIC<br />
SECTOR DEMAND, PRIVATE CONSUMPTION, DWELLING INVESTMENT,<br />
AND A STRENGTHENING OF OUR INTERNATIONAL TRADING SITUATION.<br />
AVAILABLE INDICATORS SUGGEST THAT THIS PATTERN OF GROWTH<br />
HAS CONTINUED SINCE THE SEPTEMBER QUARTER:<br />
RETAIL SALES HAVE BEEN STRONG<br />
MOTOR VEHICLES REGISTRATIONS ARE E, RPLY<br />
HIGHER HOUSING STARTS AND LENDING FOR HOUSING ARE<br />
PROCEEDING APACE<br />
WE INHERITED AN INFLATION RATE OF 11.5 PER CENT. SINCE<br />
THEN THE TREND HAS CLEARLY BEEN DOWNWARD. THE ACCORD<br />
WILL HELP TO KEEP THE TREND DOWNWARD FOR AT LEAST THE<br />
REMAINDER OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR. </p>
<p>EMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN GROWING MUCH MORE STRONGLY THAN<br />
EXPECTED IN THE BUDGET FORECASTS, EMPLOYMENT HAS ALREADY<br />
GROWN BY MORE THAN THE BUDGET TIME FORECAST FOR THE<br />
WHOLE FINANCIAL YEAR, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS FALLEN<br />
FROM 10.3 PER CENT TO 9,4 PER CENT,<br />
THE TURNAROUND IN NEW SOUTH WALES HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY<br />
STRONG, THE MOST RECENT INDICATORS SUGGEST THAT THE<br />
RECOVERY IN HOUSING ACTIVITY IS PROCEEDING FASTEST IN<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES, MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS HAVE RISEN<br />
MARKEDLY OVER THE PAST YEAR, NEW SOUTH WALES HAD THE<br />
LOWEST INFLATION RATE ( 7.7 PER CENT) OF ANY STATE OVER<br />
THE COURSE OF 1983.<br />
EMPLOYMENT IN NEW SOUTH WALES HAS RISEN SUBSTANTIALLY.<br />
OVER THE FIRST EIGHT MONTHS OF THE CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR<br />
EMPLOYMENT IN NEW SOUTH WALES INCREASED BY NEARLY 19,000<br />
OR 1 PER CENT, OVER THE YEAR ENDING FEBRUARY THIS YEAR<br />
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FELL BY 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS, A<br />
SLIGHTLY LARGER DECLINE THAN EXPERIENCED BY THE ECONOMY<br />
OVERALL, WHAT ABOUT THE OUTLOOK FOR THE NATIONAL ECONOMY OVER<br />
THE COMING FINANCIAL YEAR?<br />
IT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S BELIEF THAT THE STRONG RECOVERY<br />
IN THE CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR CAN AND SHOULD BE FOLLOWED<br />
BY SUSTAINED GROWTH IN 1984-85 AND BEYOND, GOVERNMENT<br />
POLICY IS DIRECTED AT ENSURING SUCH AN OUTCOME, </p>
<p>As THE TREASURER AND I HAVE BOTH BEEN STRESSING RECENTLY,<br />
BUSINESS INVESTMENT HAS A CRITICAL ROLE TO PLAY, BOTH<br />
IN MAINTAINING THE MOMENTUM OF RECOVERY THROUGH 1984-85<br />
AND IN ENSURING THAT RECOVERY ENDURES,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES ARE SET TO ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT<br />
AN EARLY REVIVAL IN INVESTMENT,<br />
THE ACCORD IS PLAYING A MAJOR PART IN KEEPING WAGE AND<br />
PRICE PRESSURES AS LOW AS POSSIBLE, IT HAS USHERED IN<br />
A NEW ERA OF INDUSTRIAL HARMONY AND PROVIDES BUSINESS<br />
WITH A MORE CERTAIN BASIS ON WHICH TO PLAN,<br />
WITHIN THE ACCORD, AFTER THE WAGE INCREASE ARISING OUT<br />
OF THE CURRENT CASE BEFORE THE ARBITRATION COMMISSION,<br />
THERE WILL BE VIRTUALLY NO INCREASE IN WAGES UNTIL THE<br />
FIRST HALF OF 1985, THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF MEDICARE<br />
ON THE C. PI, WILL KEEP ANY WAGE INCREASE IN THE SECOND<br />
HALF OF THIS YEAR DOWN TO ONE PER CENT OR SO,<br />
THE COMBINATION OF WAGE RESTRAINT AND STRONG GROWTH IN<br />
OUTPUT HAS BEEN REDUCING UNIT LABOUR COSTS AND RAISING<br />
THE SHARE OF PROFITS IN INCOME,<br />
THE SAME ACCORD WHICH IS DELIVERING A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE<br />
OF WAGE RESTRAINT IN THE PROCESS OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS<br />
ALSO DELIVERING A REMARKABLE IMPROVEMENT IN INDUSTRIAL </p>
<p>RELATIONS. LAST WEEK THE STATISTICIAN TOLD US THAT<br />
DAYS LOST PER THOUSAND WORKERS IN 1983 WAS 40 PER CENT<br />
BELOW THE PREVIOUS YEAR, AND THE LOWEST SINCE 1967.<br />
OUR MONETARY POLICY WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A BASIS FOR<br />
SUSTAINABLE REDUCTIONS IN INTEREST RATES AND A FAVOURABLE<br />
ENVIRONMENT FOR PRIVATE SECTOR SPENDING,<br />
WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN INTEREST RATES<br />
THROUGH THE CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR. DOMESTIC INFLUENCES<br />
WILL BE HELPFUL TO CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS NEXT YEAR.<br />
CORPORATE PROFITS WILL BE DISTINCTLY HIGHER THAN THIS YEAR'S<br />
IMPROVED LEVELS, SO THAT BUSINESS WILL BE BETTER PLACED TO<br />
FINANCE INVESTMENT OUT OF CASH FLOW. WE EXPECT STATE<br />
AUTHORITIES TO REDUCE THEIR DEMANDS ON FINANCIAL MARKETS,<br />
AS THEY COMPLETE MAJOR INVESTMENT PROGRAMMES AND AS<br />
THEIR REVENUES STRENGTHEN WITH ECONOMIC RECOVERY. HIGHER<br />
INCOMES WILL HOLD UP HOUSEHOLD SAVINGS. AND THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH INTENDS SIGNIFICANTLY TO REDUCE ITS OWN DEMANDS<br />
ON FINANCIAL MARKETS. SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN PRIVATE<br />
INVESTMENT NEXT FINANCIAL YEAR ARE CONSISTENT WITH IMPROVED<br />
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY FOR NATIONAL<br />
ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS FIRMLY IN PLACE. </p>
<p>IT NOW SEEMS LIKELY THAT GROWTH THROUGH THE CURRENT<br />
FINANCIAL YEAR WILL BE STRONGER THAN IN ANY YEAR SINCE a.<br />
THE FIRST COLLECTIONS OF NATIONAL ACCOUNTS DATA MORE<br />
THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO,<br />
THERE ARE GOOD PROSPECTS FOR STRONG GROWTH NEXT YEAR AND<br />
INTO THE LONGER TERM FUTURE,<br />
THIS STRONG TURNAROUND IN AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC FORTUNES<br />
HAS DEPENDED ON THE CO-OPERATION OF MANY IMPORTANT GROUPS<br />
IN THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY,<br />
IT HAS DEPENDED SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE EXCELLENT RELATIONS<br />
BETWEEN THE AUSTRALIAN AND NEW SOUTH WALES LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENTS, IT HAS DEPENDED ON CO-OPERATION BETWEEN TWO GOVERNMENTS<br />
WHICH UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER AND WHICH TOGETHER WORK WELL<br />
WITH THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT,<br />
NEVILLE WRAN'S GOVERNMENT HAS MANAGED THE NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
ECONOMY THROUGH THE MOST DIFFICULT OF TIMES,<br />
HIS EFFORTS, AND OURS, ARE BEGINNING TO BEAR THEIR FULL<br />
FRUIT,<br />
r_ </p>
<p>8.<br />
To BE CONFIDENT THAT AUSTRALIA AND NEW SOUTH WALES CAN<br />
CONTINUE TOGETHER STEADILY TO GROW, AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE<br />
AND REPEAT NOW<br />
" I NEED NEVILLE WRAN, NEW SOUTH WALES NEEDS<br />
NEVILLE WRAN, AND AUSTRALIA NEEDS NEVILLE WRAN". </p>
