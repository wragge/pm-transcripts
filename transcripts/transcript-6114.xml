POLITICAL MOTIVES, IN HIS SPEECH TO iHE Ft ECEORS OF<br />
BRUCE LAST FRIDAY, IR. PEACOCK FAILED TO FACE UP TO T,! E<br />
IMPLICATIONS OF THE DUDGETAPY MESS THAT THE LIBERALS<br />
CREATED BEFORE 1ARCH 5, HE DID NOT SAY A WrD ABOUT ' IOU1<br />
HE WOULD PAY THE BItLS THAT ARE BEING PRESENTED FROTKI I. AST<br />
YEAR'S IBERAL SPENDING SPREE.<br />
THIS WAS DISHONEST ENOUGH I N ITSELF, UT HF WEINT ON1 1O<br />
TELL A NUMBER OF CLEAR, SPECIFIC LIES MMYD OUOTW N VILVIS.<br />
MiR, PEACOCK SAID THAT I ELILVE THAT THE FA.-i LY ALLOW4AN( CI<br />
SHOULD BE ABOLISHED, I HAVE NO] SAID OR WRITTEIN<br />
OR THOUGHT THAT THE FAI1 LY ALLOW'i'AlNCE SHOULD BE A5EJ L I ! Hi) / 9 </p>
<p>MR. PEACOCK SAID THAT I BELIEVE iHAT DFPCNDAN'l SPOUW<br />
REBATES SHOULD BE ENDED,<br />
THAT CLAIM IS NOT TRUE.<br />
MR. PEACOCK SAID THAT I BELIEVE THAT STATE AmID N EDUCATION<br />
SHOULD B~ E PHASED OUT. IHAVE NOT SAID OR WRITTEN OR THOUGHT<br />
THAT STATE AID IN EDUCATION SHOULD BE PHASED) OUT, MR, PEACOCK<br />
SAID THAT I BELIEVE THAT FAMILIES SHOULD NO LONGER RECEIVE<br />
ASSISTANCE WITH THEIR HOME LOAN REPAYMENTS, HAVE NOT SAID<br />
OR WRITTEN OR THOUGHTr THAT FAMILIES SHOULD NO LONGER RECEIVE<br />
ASSISTANCE WITH THEIR HOME LOAN REPAYMENTS,<br />
THESE CLAIMS ARE SIMPLY LIES. TO TELL THESE LIES.. MR, PEACOCK<br />
MUST BE A DESPERATE MAN.<br />
MANY OTHER STATEMENTS IN MR PEACOCK'S ADDRESS TO THE ELECTORS<br />
OF BRUCE ARE SIMPLY LIES, MR. PEACOCK'S SPEECH TO THE PEOPLE<br />
OF BRUCE CONTAINED AS MUCH DECEPTION AS THE CAMPAIGN MR, FRASER,<br />
MR. ANTHONY, MR, HOWARD AND MR. PEACOCK PRESENTED TO THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE EARLIER IN THE YEAR. HE HAS LEARNT NOTHING.<br />
AUSTRALIA. CANNOT AFFORD DECEPTION BY ITS POLITICAL LEADERS,<br />
AuSTRALIA HAS HUGE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, AUSTRALIA WILL NOT<br />
OVERCOME ITS PROBLEMS UNLESS WE RECOGNISE TH1EM FOR WHAT THEY<br />
ARE, AND CAREFULLY DEVELOP LONG-TERM PROGRAMS TO COMBAT THEM. / lo </p>
