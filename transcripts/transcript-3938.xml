PRIME MiINISTER'S SPEECHI AT JTHIIE " TV I-IiKE IT AUSTRALIAN CAMiPATGl<br />
ML'LBOUR.. NE, 26 OCTOBER 1975<br />
You've just seen the man who often represents me<br />
. I'm now speaking in my own right.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, we've all shown by our<br />
presence tonight that we want to make TV Australian<br />
we've acknowledged in the flesh, directly, the men and<br />
women of talent who can make television Australian.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government I support their<br />
efforts. But I must confess that it's become much more<br />
difficult to do so than I thought when I pledged'this support<br />
on behalf of my Party three years ago. It's not that<br />
very much hasn't been attempted and quite an amount achieved<br />
but I must mention two particular difficulties we have:<br />
first, of course, it's only in recent years that the<br />
Australian Government has tried to do anything about making<br />
TV Australian. Before John Gorton, who is with us tonight<br />
and except for John Gorton, no other Australian Governments.-<br />
have ever tried to do anything about making television<br />
Australian. And one of the early pleasures I had as head<br />
of the present Government was to bring in-to the House, and<br />
get through both Houses, the statute to establish the<br />
Television School. Then we established a Film, Radio and<br />
Television Board in the Australia Council; and we've<br />
established an Australian Film Commission.<br />
But there is one very long-seated difficulty that<br />
we have in Australia there are too many television<br />
commercial stations; and this stems from the fact that in<br />
the later 1950' s and the early 1960' s the Australian<br />
Government of . the day had to make sure that every one of<br />
the newspaper families got its own two television stations.<br />
And it is very much cheaper to be one of the few hundred<br />
television outlets for television programs made in the United<br />
States or even the-United Kingdom than it is to be one of<br />
the half dozen catering for Australian programs.<br />
With a great number of outlets it's cheaper and therefore<br />
Australian television programs are too expensive, so they say.<br />
And all the newspapers do their best to disparage the<br />
Australian program and they do it under the guise of<br />
telling their viewers that they are entitled to a choice:<br />
they're entitled to the best, and the best -the inference<br />
is comes from overseas.<br />
And then there is one other very great difficulty<br />
that we've found: the laws under which there is supervision<br />
of radio and television in Australia, the Broadcasting and<br />
Television Act, has not given sufficiently clear powers<br />
and durisdiction to the Australian Broadcasting Control<br />
Board. Where it has been possible by administrative action<br />
to improve the Australian Broadcasting Commission or the<br />
Australian Broadcasting Control Board the Government has done<br />
so. The people who work for the A. B. C. now for the first<br />
time have elected somebody themselves to represent them on the<br />
A. B. C. And the Australian Broadcasting Control Board for<br />
years said there were no more channels available and FM was<br />
not possible in Australia. We now know that these were false </p>
<p>statements. But still the Broadcasti c Control. Board can<br />
maLe suggestions and can issue orde( rs and Lhe television<br />
sti. tions can disregard them with impunity.<br />
And twice the House of Representatives has passed amendments<br />
to give the Broadcasting Control Board teeth and twice<br />
the Senate has rejected those amendments. I will Eay<br />
no more about the Senate, of course. But we've done our<br />
best and until the laws are amended, radio and television<br />
in Australia will be handicapped by the lack ofT proper<br />
national power.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, we've all seen with our<br />
own eyes, and heard with our own ears tonight the extent,<br />
the range, the quality of talent, that there is in Australia<br />
to produce Australian TV programs. And I believe your<br />
voices, your response, to the artists, to the writers, to<br />
the producers, will yeL be heard. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
we all have to work harder, resolutely, patiently, to see<br />
that Australian talent is not only seen. in Australia, but<br />
identified as Australian around the world. We have made<br />
increasing sums of money available -' 73 Budget, ' 74 Budget,<br />
Budget, when it geLs through. But this is not enough<br />
we must all see , as Australians, that all our resources<br />
are increasingly Australian whether they are material<br />
or human-. And we have a wealth of human material, human<br />
resources in this country, and not least in the performing<br />
arts and in the most modern and pervasive of them all,<br />
television itself. Let us make it Australian. </p>
