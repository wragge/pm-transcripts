DEATH OF PRIME MINISTER OHIRA<br />
I was greatly saddened to hear this morning of the death of<br />
Prime Minister Ohira and I am sending my condolences to<br />
Mrs Ohira, members of the Prime Minister's family and to the<br />
people of Japan.<br />
Mr Ohira contributed greatly to the strengthening of friendship<br />
and understanding between Australia and Japan. His visit to<br />
Australia last January brought a personal warmth to the strong<br />
ties between our two Governments and peoples. He sought to<br />
improve international understanding among peoples in the<br />
Asian-Pacific area and took a leading part in discusssions<br />
on Pacific Basin co-operation.<br />
I feel that we have lost a personal friend. t<br />
