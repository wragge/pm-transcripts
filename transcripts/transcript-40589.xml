    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian and Victorian Governments today struck agreement on a $3 billion Victorian Infrastructure Package that will unlock critical funding for more than 40 key road and rail projects across the state.</p>
<p>Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull said this multi-billion dollar package will improve access to our road networks, jobs and economic hubs.</p>
<p>“I am pleased the Victorian Government has matched our funding of $1.5 billion to deliver vital upgrades to 40 road projects across the State,” Mr Turnbull said.</p>
<p>“These projects will drive investment and innovation, improve freight efficiency, and business productivity.</p>
<p>“We are investing and building for our future by reducing congestion as our population increases - this includes $1 billion upgrade to the Monash Freeway to ease traffic congestion.</p>
<p>Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Darren Chester said commuters will experience the benefits in the long term with efficiencies - allowing people to do business or get to work quicker.</p>
<p>“We will be delivering Monash Freeway upgrades, M80 Ring Road upgrades, Murray Basin Freight Rail Project, an Urban Congestion Package, and a Rural and Regional Roads package,” Mr Chester said.</p>
<p>“Following our commitment to invest in an Urban Congestion package the O’Herns Road Interchange project has been included.</p>
<p>“The Australian and Victorian governments have also agreed to develop a comprehensive business case for the Monash Freeway upgrade to investigate and consider options to reduce congestion.  This will be oversighted by a joint Australian and Victorian government steering committee.</p>
<p>“We are proud to be delivering the roads that Victorians have been waiting for and we are confident they will reap the benefits.”</p>
<p>The Australian Government has committed $1.5 billion, the Victorian Government has committed $1.5 billion.</p>
