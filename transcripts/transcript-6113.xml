AUSTRALIA'S ENERGY PROSPECTS FOR THE 1980s<br />
SPEECH DELIVERED<br />
ON BEHALF OF<br />

THE MINISTER FOR<br />
SENATOR RESOURCES AND ENERGY<br />
PETER WALSH<br />
AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF ENERGY/ INSTITUTION<br />
OF ENGINEERS CONFERENCE<br />
" ENERGY ' 83"<br />
CANBERRA<br />
13 MAY 1983 </p>
<p>I AM VERY PLEASED TO BE SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY ON A TOPIC WHICH<br />
WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGZE TO BE OF TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE TO<br />
AUSTRALIA. THE VERY FACT THAT THIS CONFERENCE, DEVOTED TO<br />
ENERGY IN AUSTRALIA IN 1983, IS BEING HELD ATTESTS TO THE<br />
SIGNIFICANCE OF ENERGY FOR ALL OF US.<br />
THIS CONFERENCE IS VERY IMPRESSIVE IN BOTH THE SCOPE OF THE<br />
SUBJECTS IT IS CONSIDERING AND THE LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION. I<br />
NOTE THAT IT HAS LOOKED AT ENERGY POLICY IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL<br />
SETTING, ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT, ENERGY AND MANPOWER, AS<br />
WELL AS THE MORE FREQUENTLY DISCUSSED TOPICS, ENERGY PLANNING,<br />
PRICING AND SIJ? PLIES.<br />
AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS<br />
AND AVOID ANY TENDENCY TO COMPLACENCY WHICH MIGHT BE ENGENDERED<br />
BY THE PRESENT EASING OF INTERNATIONAL OIL PRICES.<br />
INTERN'ATIONAL 0UIL SITUATION<br />
THE CURRENT INTERNATIONAL OIL SITUATION IS CHARACTERISED BY<br />
DECLINING DEMAND, EXCESS PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY AND UNCERTAINTY<br />
ABOUT THE FUTURE COURSE OF PRICES, PARTICULARLY OVER THE MEDIUM<br />
TERM. THE PRESENT LOW LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR OIL RESULTS LARGELY FROM<br />
THE SUBDUED LEVEL OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND THE EFFECTS<br />
OF CONTINUING FUEL SUBSTITUTION AND CONSERVATION, INTRODUCED IN<br />
RESPONSE TO THE OIL PRICE SURGES OF 1973-74 AND 1979-80.<br />
THE RECENT OPEC AGREEMENT TO CUT THE PRICE OF ARAB LIGHT OIL,<br />
ITS REFERENCE PRICE, BY $ US5 A BARREL TO $ us29 A BARREL WAS THE<br />
FIRcST MAJOR PRICE CUT EVER AGREED TO BY OPEC.<br />
THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT OPEC'S EFFORTS TO STABILISE THE<br />
MARKET IN THE FACE OF DECLINING DEMAND MAY BE SUCCESSFUL. </p>
<p>OPEC MEMbERS HAVE HELD TO THEIR AGREEMENT SO FAR<br />
NON-OPEC SUPPLIERS, NOTABLY THE UK, MEXICO AND THE USSR,<br />
HAVE ADJUSTED THEIR PRICES IN LINE WITH OPEC PRICES<br />
PRIC: S ON THE SPOT MARKET HAVE FIRMED. MANY KEY CRUDE<br />
OIL PRICES ARE NOW CLOSE TO OR AT OFFICIAL LEVELS.<br />
NONETHELESS, THE OUTLOOK FOR THE OIL MARKET BEYOND 1983 REMAINS<br />
UNCERTAIN. MUCH WILL DEPEND ON FACTORS SUCH AS MAINTENANCE OF<br />
DISCIPLINE Wi-. i-SI OPEC RANKS; EFFECTS OF A RUN-DOWN IN<br />
CONSUMING COUTRiES' OIL STOCKS WHICH COULD DELAY RECOVERY IN<br />
DEMAND FOR OPEC UIL: AND THE EFFECTS ON OIL MARKETS OF RECOVERY<br />
IN THE WORLD ECONOMY,<br />
AUSTRALIA'S EINE
AUSTRALIA, OF C iuPSE, IS WELL ENDOWED WITH MOST ENERGY<br />
RESOURCES AND IS ONE OF THE FIVE OECD/ DEVELOPED COUNTRIES THAT<br />
ARE NET ENERGY EXPORTERS ( ALONG WITH THE UK, CANADA, NORWAY AND<br />
THE NETHERLANDS).<br />
THIS HAS PLACED US IN A SPECIAL POSITION WITH RESPECT TO ENERGY<br />
DEVELOPMENTS IN RECENT YEARS.<br />
fNi 1981-82 THE VALUE OF OUR ENERGY EXPORTS WAS $ 3.4 BILLION OR<br />
17.5% OF THE TOTAL. VALUE OF EXPORTS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF<br />
INCREASED OIL PRICES, THE VALUE OF OUR NET BALANCE OF TRADE IN<br />
ENERGY HAS DECLINED IN RECLNT YEARS IN 198i-82 THERE WAS ONLY<br />
A SLIGHT SURPLUS.<br />
iLACK COAL EXPORTS ACCOUNIED FOR 67 PER CENT OF THE VALUE OF<br />
UUR ENERGY EXPORTS IN 1981-82, AND OUR STEAMING COAL EXPORTS<br />
iAVE RISEN STRONGLY RECENTLY. OUR OTHER MAJOR ENERGY EXPORTS<br />
ARE URANIUM AND LPG.<br />
AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE PRESENT DOWNTURN IN ThE WORLD ECONOMY,<br />
AND REDUCED OIL PRICES, THE OUTLOOK FOR OUR MAJOR ENERGY<br />
EXPORTS IS UNCERTAIN IN THE SHORT TERM. </p>
<p>YOU WILL BE AiARE OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL COAL<br />
MARKETS AND THE AUSTRALIAN COAL INDUSTRY. SIMILARLY, PROSPECTS<br />
FOR INCREASED EXPORTS OF, FOR EXAMPLE, LNG HAVE BECOME CLOUDIER.<br />
THESE INTERNATIONAL MARKET DEVELOPMENTS HAVE THE EFFECT OF<br />
INCREASING THE PRESSURE ON OUR RESOURCE PROJECTS TO MAINTAIN<br />
THEIR COMPETITIVENESS.<br />
TiE GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, BELIEVES THAT AUSTRALIA'S RESOURCES<br />
INiUSTRIES FACE A VERY BRIGHT LONG TERM FUTURE. AT THE SAME<br />
! IME, AS INDICATED IN ITS RESPONSE TO THE PRESENT COAL INDUSTRY<br />
SITUATION, IT IS TAKING ACTION TO ASSIST THESE INDUSTRIES IN<br />
'! iE SHORT TERM. THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONSULTED WITH THE<br />
PRODUCERS AND UNIONS TO DEVELOP A CO-OPERATIVE APPROACH TO<br />
SOLVINU PROBLtMS IN THE COAL INDUSTRY. IT IS PUTTING A STRONG<br />
1MPHASIS ON gEVELOPING EXPORT MARKETS.<br />
AUSTRALIA: LIQUID FUEL PROSPECTS<br />
. RUjLD UIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS ARE AUSTRALIA'S ONLY<br />
slGNiFICANT IMPORTS OF ENERGY. WHILE THE QUANTITY OF IMPORTS<br />
JrE HESE FUELS HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSTANT SINCE THE EARLY<br />
L JOS, THEIR COST HAS INCREASED MORE THAN TEN-FOLD OVER THE<br />
r,:, I'HEiLESS, AUSTRALIA HAS A RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL OF<br />
L. L-rSUFFICIENCY IN LIQUID FUELS OF ARQUND TWO-THIRDS OF ITS<br />
AJJ ., r. MENTS A POSITION WHICH MANY COUNTRIES ENVY.<br />
L,,: EST FORECASTS, BASED UN ESTIMATED PRODUCTION FROM KNOWN<br />
. t.. RVES, SUGGEST THAT SELF-SUFFICIENCY SHOULD PEAK AT<br />
/ o FER CENT IN 1981-85, AS ADDITIONAL CRUDE OIL AND CONDENSATE<br />
.; uPLiES FROM THE COOPER BASIN, BASS STRAIT AND NORTH-WEST<br />
-, HltF COME ON STREAM, COMBINED WITH FORECAST LOWER LEVELS OF<br />
i'EIROLEUM FUELS DEMAND. </p>
<p>HOWEVER, PRODUCTION COULD DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE MID<br />
1980S AS BASS STRAIT RESERVES FALL AND FORECAST DEMAND<br />
INCREASES UNLESS THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT NEW DISCOVERIES.<br />
IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT AUSTRALIA DOES HAVE REASONABLE<br />
PROSPECTS FOR ADDITIONAL OIL DISCOVERIES AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT<br />
OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS. THE BMR HAS ESTIMATED THAT THERE IS A<br />
PER CENT PROBABILITY OF FUNDING AT LEAST 1 800 MILLION<br />
BARRELS OF Uli., IE ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO THE PRESENT LEVEL OF<br />
AUSTRALIA'S OIL RESERVES. THE BMR SUGGESTS THAT ABOUT HALF OF<br />
THESE RESERES iAY BE DISCOVERED IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS.<br />
IF THE BMR ESIiMATES ARE REALISED, AUSTRALIA'S LIQUID FUEL<br />
SELF-SUFFICJENCY COULD EXCEED 80 PER CENT DURING THE DECADE TO<br />
1991-92.<br />
TURNING BRIEFL' TO NON-CONVENTIONAL LIQUID FUELS, I WOULD JUST<br />
LIKE TO SAY THAT THE TIMING OF DEVELOPMENTS IS VERY UNCERTAIN;<br />
CURRENT INDICATIONS ARE THAT PRODUCTION OF SYNTHETIC LIQUID<br />
FUELS FROM OIL. SHALE, COAL AND METHANOL WILL NOT BE OF<br />
SIGNIFICANCE i'i AUSTRALIA UNTIL THE 1990S OR BEYOND,<br />
PELFtL PRICES<br />
i'USTRALIA HAS ASO ENJOYD THE BENEFITS OF THE THIRD CHEAPEST<br />
AVLRAGE PETROL PRICE AMONG OECD COUNTRIES, ONLY CANADA AND THE<br />
USA HAVE LOWER P; TROL PRICES. AND AUSTRALIA'S AUTOMOTIVE LPG<br />
PR7CES ARE THE LOWEST OF ALL IN THESE COUNTRIES. THESE<br />
R: LATIVELY LOW PRICES CAN LARGELY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE LOWER<br />
LEViFL OF IAXATION APPLIED TO THESE FUELS IN AUSTRALIA<br />
l_\ Nt~. Y POLICIES<br />
AUSTRALIA'S RELATIVELY FAVOURED POSITION IN REGARD TO ENERGY<br />
RESOURCES SHOULD NOT BE A CAUSE FOR COMPLACENCY. IT DOES NOT<br />
DIMINISH THE NEED FOR APPROPRIATE ENERGY POLICIES FROM THE<br />
GOVERNMENT. </p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THE IMPORTANCE OF PRICE INCENTIVES TO<br />
STIMULATE THE EXPLORATION FOR AND DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL<br />
ENERGY RESOURCES. SO DID THE PREVIOUS LABOUR GOVERNMENT WHICH,<br />
IN SEPTEMBER 1b75, ESTABLISHED THE POLICY OF IMPORT PARITY<br />
PRICING FOR ' NEW' OIL.<br />
PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR TAXING EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES,<br />
PARTICULARLY ENERGY RESOURCES, ARE FRAGMENTED, COMPLEX AND<br />
ARBITRARY. miE GOVERNMENT ATTACHES IMPORTANCE TO IMPROVING<br />
THESE TAX ARRANGEMENTS. IT WILL MAKE CHANGES WHICH WILL<br />
ENCOURAGE PRODUCTION, INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND ENSURE AN<br />
APPROPRIATE CONTRIBUTION TO REVENUE.<br />
MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF MEASURES TO<br />
IMPROVE RESOURCE TAX ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING A RESOURCES RENT<br />
TAX. ALL INTERESTED PARTIES, INCLUDING PRODUCERS AND THE<br />
STATES, WILL BE CONSULTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH MEASURES<br />
BEFORE THEY ARE CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT. IN RESPECT OF A<br />
RESOURCE RENT TAX SUCH A TAX WILL NOT BE INTRODUCED WITHOUT<br />
ADEQUATE CONSULTATION WITH INDUSTRY AND OTHER INTERESTED<br />
PARTIES. THE GOVERNMENT WILL, THEREFORE, BE GUIDED BY THREE PRINCIPLES<br />
IN DEVELOPING ENEfRGY POLICIES FOR AUSTRALIA. IT WILL SEEK TO:<br />
ENSURE SUFFICIENT ENERGY SUPPLIES ARE AVAILABLE<br />
ENCOURAGE TrK MOST EFFICIENT RESOURCE PRODUCTION<br />
ENSURE THAT THE BENEFITS OF RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT ARE<br />
SHARED EQUITABLY AMONGST THE WHOLE COMMUNITY.<br />
INiCREASING ENERGY PRODUCTION IS IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US, WHETHER<br />
qE BE GOVERNMENT, PRODUCERS OR CONSUMERS. iMPROVING ENERGY<br />
USAGE., WHETHER IT IS THROUGH TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS OR A MORE<br />
EFFECTIVE FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYSIS AND DECISION MAKING, IS<br />
EQUALLY IMPORTANT. THE GOVERNMENT IS VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE<br />
3ROAD SCOPE OF ENERGY ISSUES AND WILL MAKE A FIRM CONTRIBUTION<br />
TOWARDS EFFECTIVE ENERGY POLICY.<br />
LAUIES AND GENTLENEN. ThiANK YOU. </p>
