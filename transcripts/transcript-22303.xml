    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I am pleased to announce a suite of measures that will honour the memory of Larry Knight and help Beaconsfield get back on its feet.</p>
<p>Larry's Knight's family has agreed to the Australian Government providing $1 million to establish a Larry Knight equity scholarship at the University of Tasmania.  This scholarship will honour Larry Knight's memory and support Tasmanian students to undertake courses in mining and engineering.</p>
<p>In recognition of the economic significance of the Beaconsfield mine to the community, the Australian Government will provide $8 million to establish a Beaconsfield Community Fund.</p>
<p>The Fund will provide important support to the mine, miners and their families and the community.  It will support a range of community-led economic, social and culturally related projects in Beaconsfield so that the community can grow and prosper.</p>
<p>The Fund will be a partnership involving the Australian Government, the West Tamar Council and, subject to it making a financial contribution, the Tasmanian Government.  The Australian Government invites the Tasmanian Government to contribute to the Fund.</p>
<p>The operating guidelines and final details of the Fund will be settled in coming days with a view to it becoming operational very quickly.</p>
<p>Further, the Australian Government has indicated it will provide tax deductibility to the Beaconsfield Miners Support Fund when an application is received.  This Fund was established by the Australian Workers' Union.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is also disposed to making a contribution to this Fund once its purpose is clarified.</p>
<p>These measures represent a considered and compassionate response to the extraordinary events at Beaconsfield and seek to assist the community to move forward.</p>
