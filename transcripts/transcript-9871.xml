PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
HOWARD'S SOUR GRAPES<br />
The Leader of the Opposition's petulant performance on ABC Radio's AM this<br />
morning confirms his determination to run down the Australian economy at<br />
every opportunity.<br />
Despite his lame assertions to the contrary, John Howard is now publicly<br />
imploring the Australian economy to perform poorly, and denigrating the<br />
significant economic achievements of the Australian community.<br />
We have just achieved a record seventeenth consecutive quarter of<br />
economic growth. Mr Howard claims the September growth figures were<br />
" something of a mirage." Next he will be claiming we have had seventeen<br />
consecutive mirages.<br />
Mr Howard has now pinned his hopes on negative growth in the December<br />
quarter it is his version of Dr Hewson's pre-1 993 election cry that the<br />
economy was heading into depression.<br />
Seventeen quarters some depression!<br />
And in a breathtaking display of hypocrisy, John Howard claimed incorrectly<br />
that confidence was low in the economy because " what people are reacting<br />
to at the moment is the lack of any medium or long term plan from the<br />
Government.<br />
This from the Leader of the Opposition who has tried to make a virtue of<br />
concealing his policies from the Australian public his only political strategy.<br />
From John Howard, the Australian people get neither a medium or a long<br />
term plan they simply get whingeing.<br />
His only short term plan as he confirmed again in Perth yesterday is to<br />
ditch the cross-media ownership rules to put an end to diversity of media<br />
ownership in Australia. </p>
<p>TEL: 5. Dec. 95 No. U 1 r. uz,/ U<br />

After Parliament has risen he dribbles out his sneaky media plan at a Perth<br />
doorstop. Where are the critics now who accused me of making a baseless claim when<br />
I said that Mr Packer had him in the bag? Yesterday's statement proves he<br />
not only has him in the bag but that he has tied the knot with a silken tassel.<br />
