4AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 15 OCTOBER 1979<br />
OPENING OF NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENERGY CONSERVATION<br />
I am very pleased to be here to open this conference this<br />
morning because it is an important one. Energy is a matter<br />
that concerns Australia, it concerns every country around<br />
the world.<br />
International concern has risen to new heights in recent<br />
times because of oil shortages, because of concern about<br />
the availability of fuel to keep our industries moving, and<br />
also because of the price of energy and the rapid increase<br />
in that price.<br />
The confej~ ence will increase public awareness of these energy<br />
problems, and I hope also increase public awareness of what<br />
is being done about it. It is an opportunity to get a<br />
better understanding of the different ways of coping with<br />
our energy needs.<br />
I would like to turn back a little in history. In 1973-74<br />
there was the first major energy crisis. oil prices<br />
quadrupled in a short period. As a result of that, and as<br />
a result of inadequate national policies, inflation in OECD<br />
countries rose from an average of something under 8% to<br />
between 13% and 14%. That had a very significant impact on<br />
world growth, on world trade. I believe that many economies<br />
haven't really worked their way out of the difficulties-. posed<br />
by that first majo~ r increase in oil prices.<br />
A change in economic policy was clearly needed in many<br />
countries a much greater attack on inflation than in fact<br />
occurred. Certainly a change in energy policy was needed<br />
in many countries, and that also did not occur. It seemed<br />
that the major industrialised world ignored the warning that<br />
came from that first energy crisis. Economic policies weren't<br />
changed, and energy policies weren't changed. The world chose<br />
to prefer to believe that there wasn't really a crisis, that<br />
there wasn't really a shortage, that it would not really occur<br />
again. Last year of course made it perfectly plain that it could<br />
occur again--from different causes--but the energy crisis,<br />
from Iran's policies, is now with us. </p>
<p>The economic policies post the first oil crisis, continued<br />
excessive government spending, had the result that by the<br />
end of 1978 inflation was still too high. In many countries<br />
it was starting to rise again. That long period of inflation<br />
through the 1970' s weakened many countries, weakened major<br />
industrialised nations, so that they were less well able to<br />
withstand the difficulties posed by the current round of oil<br />
price increases.<br />
The energy policies that countries had continued t he excessive<br />
useage of a scarce resource. A combination of the inadequate<br />
economic and energy policies has meant very plainly that in<br />
1978 the world was much less able to withstand what came out<br />
of the Iranian crisis than might otherwise have been the<br />
case. The world was ill-prepared for the shortage of oil<br />
and ill-prepared for the increase in oil prices that were<br />
inevitable results of it.<br />
Over the last twelve months there has been a 50% increase in<br />
oil prices. That has reinforced inflationary pressures, it<br />
has re-emphasised the need for adequate oil and energy policies,<br />
and in the grim reality of a world shortage and the problems<br />
that can flow from that, the world is at last starting to act--<br />
too late and probably still too little.<br />
A number of countries have introduced energy conservation<br />
policies. Most countries regard pricing as a central element<br />
in any conservation program. Other policies of course include<br />
grants and subsidies for energy research and development, for<br />
energy conservation, particular policies designed to encourage<br />
the use of alternative forms of energy. Tax incentives and<br />
loan schemes are part of this general package of policies from<br />
a number of countries.<br />
The concern that is now felt around the world is epitomised by<br />
decisions that were taken at the Tokyo summit conference last<br />
July. That conference concentrated almost totally on energy<br />
problems, on the problems of oil. Therefore there was<br />
agreement to adopt oil import targets, to participate -in<br />
international energy technology group, and to introduce a<br />
registration system which willmonitor spot markets and make<br />
for a more informed world oil market.<br />
Again, with a little more foresight, we might have believed<br />
that the major countries would have undertaken policies of<br />
that kind much earlier. It also ought to be noted, that in<br />
spite of the decisions taken at Tokyo, there are many who<br />
believe there are still some serious deficiencies in major<br />
countries' energy policies.<br />
oil conservation policies should lead to a greater use of<br />
alternative forms of fuel, a greater use of coal, of gas,<br />
and a greater use of uranium. Many countries have a growing<br />
dependence on uranium. President Carter said in his Kansas City<br />
speech that nuclear powzer must play an important role in the<br />
United States to make sure the United States energy future. </p>
<p>Nuclear power is already an important source of electricity<br />
generation in countries like Belgium, Sweden and Switzerland.<br />
In Belgium and Sweden 25% of their power is already dependent<br />
upon nuclear sources.<br />
The Australian Atomic Energy Commission forecasts that by 1983<br />
of electricity generated in the E. E. C. will come from<br />
nuclear power. For example, by 1985 France could be obtaining<br />
of its electric power from nuclear generation; by 1981<br />
of Switzerland's power is likely to be from nuclear generation.<br />
The number of countries adopting nuclear power facilities continues<br />
to expand. An inevitable process I believe has been begun towards<br />
greater use of nuclear power. By the end of this century there<br />
will be many countries that will be heavily reliant on nuclear<br />
power for electricity generation. Countries such as Korea, the<br />
United Kingdom, Brazil, and in the OECD area as a whole well over<br />
of the power generated is likely to be from nuclear sources.<br />
We are of course concerned with Australia's own energy policies<br />
and the problems of energy within Australia. In the comprehensive<br />
policy that we are now pursuing there are three main objectives:<br />
conservation of a scarce resource, the greater use of alternative<br />
sources of energy, and greater exploration and development within<br />
Australia itself.<br />
Whether we like it or not, world parity pricing is a central<br />
element in pursuit of each of those major policy objectives.<br />
oil is a scarce resource, We need to pay a market price<br />
for it. We can't pretend that it is not a scarce resource.<br />
A pricing policy is needed for conservation. If we had<br />
alternative policies some kind of subsidisation, some kind<br />
of artificially low price for oil there clearly would be<br />
an excessive use. Clearly there would be many people who would<br />
stay with oil when they should be going to alternative forms<br />
of energy. That would lead to an inevitable massive dislocation<br />
at some later point.<br />
The Government made the decision that it was better to move to<br />
world parity pricing so that the later problems for Australian<br />
industry, for Australian consumers, could be minimised, so that<br />
we can face the reality of the current situation. That obviously<br />
means a short run of substantial increases in oil prices as we<br />
have had. But we strongly believe that it is best, and indeed<br />
important, for the long run health of the Australian economy.<br />
I don't see any conflict between that pricing policy and the<br />
fight against inflation, because some price rises are quite<br />
inevitable. You don't really help the longer term fight against<br />
inflation by suggesting that those pressures, those necessities,<br />
don't exist where necessity has to be faced as it has been in<br />
this country.<br />
In the longer term if we are not prepared to pay world parity<br />
pricing for oils produced within Australia, if we are to have<br />
oil at all, we would have to pay oil parity price for oil<br />
bought from overseas-atmuch greater cost to Australia's<br />
balance of payments anid balance of trade, to a much greater<br />
dependence on other oil producing and exporting countries. </p>
<p>I think we are much better to be pursuing our present policies<br />
which will lead not only to conservation as time passes, but<br />
also to greater exploration and to greater development within<br />
Australia. It is also worth noting that even with world<br />
parity pricing within this country, petrol is still cheap<br />
compared with many other countries around the world. It<br />
doesn't matter much if that is a result of other countries<br />
having a higher level of tax on their fuel. The fact remains<br />
that Australian petrol, at 2U'-30 a litre is not much more<br />
than half the price in Britain, in Germany, the Netherlands,<br />
in Italy where it is 60 in Japan where it is 62$, in France<br />
where it is 64 a litre.<br />
North America stands in marked contrast, with much cheaper<br />
petrol than in Australia. But we all know that the United States<br />
has not yet embraced a world parity pricing policy.<br />
our policies are encouraging greater conservation, greater<br />
use of alternative fuels: for example conversion to LPG;<br />
tax incentives to switch from oil; greater research and<br />
development; natural gas pipeline systems are being extended;<br />
the spur line to Canberra is going to be built, connecting<br />
at Gunning from the Moomba/ Sydney line, and the extension<br />
from Young to Wagga and Cootamundra is proceeding, and<br />
there is an " in principle" decision to extend that line to<br />
Albury. That will create an Eastern gas pipeline grid connecting<br />
the Cooper Basin and Bass Strait with Australia's major eastern<br />
cities. That is important again in encouraging the use of<br />
alternative forms of energy.<br />
Exploration and development activity in Australia has been<br />
increasing over the last year or two. Over the last two<br />
years Bass Strait oil reserves have been proved up to an<br />
extent of over 650 million barrels more than had earlier<br />
been believed. That is equivalent to about three years'<br />
additional consumption at current rates of usage.<br />
In 1979 exploration and development is estimated to be.. a<br />
record $ 390 million. That is a direct result of the Government's<br />
petroleum energy policies.<br />
Major oil development projects are underway. Additional<br />
development expenditure of over $ 1 billion has been announced<br />
for Bass Strait, Barrow Island, Dongara and the Cooper Basin.<br />
There are increased refinery expansion programmes for Brisbane,<br />
for Sydney, for Geelong and for Perth. The North-West Shelf<br />
development a potential program of $ 3,000 million the final<br />
feasibility study is nearing completion. I believe that<br />
through the course of this year as each week has passed the<br />
likelihood of that final feasibility study ending with a<br />
positive result has grown.<br />
The Government is increasingly optimistic of the outcome,<br />
and has you know there has been considerable assistance<br />
to foster the project, and a very considerable degree of<br />
co-operation between the . Western Australian and the Commonwealth<br />
governments. The joint ventures have reported a high level of<br />
interest by utilities in Japan, the United States, and they </p>
<p>hope to sign letters of interest with Japan later this year.<br />
I was speaking with my colleague, Doug Anthony, only a couple<br />
of days ago in Japan, and the growing interest in Australia<br />
as an increasingly important energy exporter is very evident<br />
on all sides in that country, as I believe it is in many<br />
others. In addition to 70% self-sufficiency in oil, Australia of course<br />
has considerable quantities of coal, natural gas and uranium.<br />
In an energy short world we need to ask ourselves how we are<br />
going to develop those resources to Australia's greater advantage.<br />
At present we are a net exporter of energy, one of the few of the<br />
OECD countries. There is an enormous scope for an increase in<br />
the straight export of energy in different forms. There is a<br />
growing world trade in LNG, currently exporting about 1.7 million<br />
tonnes, estimated to earn about $ 350 million this financial year.<br />
With the North-West Shelf initial exports of 6.5 million tonnes<br />
could come from that source in addition. That of course requires<br />
the proper decisions launching the North-West Shelf, but we<br />
believe that that will occur. At current prices that would earn<br />
in the order of $ 1 billion a year.<br />
We already export 38 million tonnes of coal a year, adding<br />
billion to export earnings. Since 1976, with the policies<br />
we have been pursuing, commitments to coal projects have added<br />
or are in the process of adding a further 28 million tonnes to<br />
our annual coal export capacity. Major new developments in<br />
the Bowen Basin, major examples of which are Norwich Park arnd<br />
Gregory, but there are numbers of others. The International<br />
Energy Agency estimates Australian coal exports to rise to<br />
200 million tonnes by the year 2000.<br />
We have 20% of the world's low cost uranium, and the requirements<br />
of the Western world are expected to triple by 1990. Australia<br />
is well placed to meet its share of those particular needs.<br />
There are major projects in the Northern Territory, Western<br />
A-ustralia, and likely to be as I would believe in South Australia.<br />
Safeguard agreements have already been signed with the-United States,<br />
the United Kingdom, Finland, Korea and the Philippines, and now<br />
it is up to the question of negotiating market contracts.<br />
Apart from direct energy exports, we want to bring our great<br />
resources together with abundant supplies of energy to gain<br />
greater processing within Australia, to gain greater activity<br />
within Australia. Quite plainly we don't want to be just a<br />
" hole in the ground".<br />
It is all the more important because the world economic situation<br />
activity is likely to remain at low levels for some time. With<br />
high inflation and no real sign that that inflation is going to<br />
be mastered in a number of countries, world trade is likely to<br />
grow at sluggish levels, around 4% a year, as it has through<br />
most of the last decade, in stark contrast with the 8% a year<br />
of the 20 years before 1972-73.<br />
Against the background of a difficult world trading scene, we<br />
in Australia need to develop policies that best help Australia<br />
within a difficult trading world. That means bringing our / 6 </p>
<p>energy sources together and our great natural resources and minerals<br />
for greater processing, for greater development, within Australia.<br />
A classic example of how this can be done is what is happening in<br />
alumina and aluminium processing right at the very moment.<br />
Processing of bauxite requires massive inputs of electricity.<br />
This investment has been encouraged to Australia by adequate<br />
supplies of coal-.-coal produced electricity--and as a result<br />
there is $ 4 billion worth of investment firmly committed in<br />
aluminium and aluminium development alone.<br />
We are looking to see whether the same kind of bringing together<br />
can't occur with different forms of resources, different natural<br />
resources, exploiting the abundant energy supplies which are<br />
largely coal-based electricity. I think this is one of the ways in<br />
which we can secure a reasonable future for Australia through<br />
the 1980s, even if the world trading scene is difficult and<br />
hard. To be able to take full advantage of our resources we certainly<br />
need greater development of power generation within Australia<br />
itself. You probably will have heard of a major infrastructure<br />
program in which States are, for the first time, given the<br />
capacity to overseas funds to develop at a greater pace, major<br />
resource projects within Australia. It is worth noting that a<br />
very significant part of the initial approval has been for a<br />
greater rate of development of electricity generation within<br />
Australia. In New South Wales, the Eraring electricity project<br />
of over $ 200 million; in Victoria, the Loy Yang electricity of<br />
over $ 340 million; Queensland power stations of over $ 130 million;<br />
and integrated power for the Pilbara of over $ 100 million.<br />
Now, those sums all are in addition to the normal developmental<br />
projects that would have been undertaken by electricity authorities<br />
to enable a greater rate of electricity generation and development<br />
to take place than would have otherwise been possible.<br />
The Commonwealth is also proposing to appoint a committee of<br />
inquiry into the feasibility of establishing a strongly-integrated<br />
south east Australian electricity power-grid to give greater<br />
security of supply and greater strength of supply to users in<br />
the south east of Australia. It is worth noting that Victoria<br />
and South Australia, and also Tasmania, are very interested<br />
in that particular proposal. I would have thought that it<br />
would be greatly improved if New South Wales were also<br />
interested. I find it hard to understand why New South Wales<br />
as a major industrial State, at this stage, proposes to stand<br />
out in that particular study.<br />
If we are to maximnise the opportunities for Australia<br />
in an energy short world, if we are to bring together greater<br />
development in Australia's great mineral resources, coupled with<br />
greater use of Australia's abundant supplies of coal-based<br />
electricity, we need to make sure that Australia pursues adequate<br />
economic policies because without that, nothing is likely to occur.<br />
Therefore, our objectives in economic policy have been over the<br />
last four years, to establish the conditions for sound economic / 7 </p>
<p>growth, to continue a downward pressure on inflation, to improve<br />
profitability, to control the size of the public sector deficit,<br />
and to increase business confidence. In all those arenas, I believe,<br />
significant success is being achieved.<br />
Over the last three years, the budget has held Government spending<br />
virtually constant in real terms. It is the first time that has<br />
happened for a very, very long while in Australia maybe<br />
the first time for any government. I certainly note that the<br />
States have not been able to pursue the same degree of restraint<br />
over the last three years.<br />
The Commtonwealth deficit four years ago was five per cent of<br />
Gross Domestic Product. This year it will be less, on Treasury<br />
advice, than two per cent, less than most O. E. C. D. countries,<br />
and the domestic deficit less than half of last years. The money<br />
supply has been controlled. Four years ago it was running around<br />
percent -at the moment, between 10 and 11 per cent.<br />
The policies we have been pursuing have been, and are, producing<br />
results. Australia's inflation over the last six months of about<br />
nine per cent, certainly new inflationary pressures that we do<br />
not like, certainl. y we will see higher inflation in the September<br />
and in the December quarters, but that is predicted. That is known.<br />
The movements that will cause that have already occured and nothing<br />
can be done about it. But Australia is restraining those increased<br />
inflationary pressures a good deal better than a number of other<br />
countries. European O. E. C. D countries now have an annual inflation<br />
rate of between 13 and 14 per cent, the United State ' s around<br />
14 per cent on the basis of the last six months' figures, the<br />
United Kingdom of over 23 per cent. Australia's figure of<br />
around 9 per cent compares favourably indeed with those others.<br />
As a result, competitiveness has returned to the level of the<br />
early 1970s and exports are growing strongly again as they<br />
have not for many years. There is an improved trade<br />
and current accounts. Mining and manufacturing investment,<br />
fjrmly committed or in the final feasibility stage, now stands<br />
at about $ 13 billion worth of projects right around Australia.<br />
Overseas investment through the last part of last year, moved<br />
more strongly into this country than in any period for nearly<br />
ten years. All, of that shows increased confidence in<br />
Australia, Australia's policies and in the Australian economy.<br />
That becomes all the more relevant again when we take it that<br />
it is the Government's objective to attract to this country<br />
a greater than its normal share of investment and major resource<br />
projects and putting those resources together with abundant<br />
supplies of energy to secure greater activity and greater<br />
investment and development in this country than would otherwise<br />
take place.<br />
This is particularly important in a world economy where there are<br />
many unresolved problems where the trade growth is slowed<br />
and is likely to remain slow because inflation is too high,<br />
and in many countries, is rising. That in itself leads to<br />
exchange rate instability in a number of countries overseas,<br />
and on top of that, there are energy uncertaintities as a<br />
result of the effect of Iran over the last 12 to 15 months. </p>
<p>8.<br />
But against that total background, Australia is well prepared<br />
to face the 1980s, and in a difficult trading world, we should<br />
more than maintain our position in world trade against the<br />
background of current policies. We do have many advantages<br />
in this country great resources, abundant supplies of<br />
certain forms of energy, policies that are designed to achieve<br />
economic and political stability. Putting these things together<br />
makes Australia one of the stronger economies of the world,<br />
with stronger possibilities than many countries than maybe<br />
almost any other country.<br />
I think against that background, we need to face the future<br />
future with a very great degree of confidence. Today's programme,<br />
designed to emphasise the importance of fuel conservation, is<br />
a very important part of our total approach to Australia's<br />
future. There are real shortages of oil, and nobody can<br />
suggest any more that it is a phony shortage or something<br />
that is caused by the major oil companies to jack up prices.<br />
I do not think there are many people who believe that kind<br />
of story, at this point, as we approach the 1980s.<br />
Therefore, it is important that we all do what we can to<br />
achieve a greater conservation in the use of a scarce resource<br />
and greater use of alternative forms of energy. Plainly,<br />
Government policies can be important. In many cases they<br />
can be quite criticial to the success of that conservation<br />
programme, they can be quite critical to the success and the<br />
achievement of alternative forms of energy. But, to the extent<br />
that business industry and people right around the country<br />
can co-operate in those programmes in the conservation of a<br />
scarce resource, then not only is the Australian economy<br />
strengthened but an important national objective is brought<br />
closer This is not just an Australian national objective,<br />
it is a part of a world-wide objective to achieve greater<br />
care in the use of an important and scarce world resource.<br />
So the contributions that individual Australians can make<br />
can yield important national and international objectives.<br />
This programme has the Government's full support, and<br />
Mr Chairman, I wish you well during the period of this<br />
conference, and during the period of the programme.<br />
I certainly hope that it is thoroughly successful. I believe<br />
that with the care and the preparation that has gone into it,<br />
it certainly ought to be.<br />
I have great pleasure in declaring the National Conference on<br />
Energy Conservation, officially open. </p>
