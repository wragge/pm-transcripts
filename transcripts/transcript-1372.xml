FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 73/ 1966<br />
DEATH OF MR. J. S. COCKLE, M. P.<br />
Tribute by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Halt<br />
We are saddened by the loss of a close colleague<br />
and a good friend. Mr. Cockle enjoyed the respect of the<br />
Parliament for his obvious sincerity and -rood sense. He had<br />
a special knowledge of the shipping industry which enabled him<br />
to contribute most informatively when problems connected with<br />
that industry were under debate. We shall miss him from our<br />
party room discussions. My J'overnment joins me in offering our deep<br />
sympathy to Mrs. Cockle and the members of his family.<br />
CANBERRA, 3rd August, 1966. </p>
