    <content><![CDATA[<p>Bali, Indonesia</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard will today commemorate the 10th anniversary of the 2002 Bali bombings at a memorial service in Bali.</p>
<p>On this day a decade ago, 202 people lost their lives, including 88 Australians and 38 Indonesians, as well as citizens from 20 other countries.</p>
<p>The images and the stories from this day are seared on our national consciousness.</p>
<p>We will never forget the victims of this appalling act of terrorism and our thoughts are with their families and friends.</p>
<p>We also recognise the bonds of solidarity between Australia and Indonesia forged by this shared tragedy.  And we are particularly conscious at this time of the people of Bali, who showed an overwhelming generosity of spirit in the aftermath of the bombing and in the years since.</p>
<p>Our close and enduring relationship with Indonesia sends the strongest possible message to those responsible for this terrible act: attacks on tolerance and freedom will never triumph.</p>
<p>Our best defence against violent extremists is working together to build united, strong, resilient communities who share common values of tolerance, mutual respect and a commitment to the rule of law and democracy.</p>
<p>The close and effective counter terrorism and law enforcement cooperation built between Australia and Indonesia in response to the Bali bombings has grown into an enduring partnership, to the benefit of both countries.</p>
