AUSTRALIA Press Statement No. 79<br />
1 May 1973<br />
PUBLIC SERVICE BONDING<br />
The Prime Minister announced today the<br />
discontinuance of bonding of staff in the Commonwealth<br />
Service. Opinion throughout the community is increasingly<br />
opposed to the bonding of trainees. The Karmel Committee<br />
of Enquiry into Education in South Australia in 1970<br />
recorded its opposition to the whole principle of bonding<br />
and thought it should be abolished as soon as circumstances<br />
permitted. The Bell Committee of Inquiry into Teacher<br />
Education in N. S. W. in 1971 expressed similar views. The<br />
Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the<br />
Arts in 1972 concluded that bonding was so financially and<br />
socially wasteful that it should be scrapped.<br />
The Public Service Board considers that in current<br />
circumstances in the Commonwealth Service bonding is no<br />
longer appropriate. Existing bond commitments will not be enforced.<br />
Money paid by people in respect of contracts they have<br />
previously breached will not be refunded.<br />
Other aspects of cadetships and other trainee<br />
schemes are being reviewed in the light of the current<br />
circumstances and where appropriate these will be discussed<br />
by the Public Service Board with staff associations.<br />
