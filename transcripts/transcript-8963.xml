PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIVF Of INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIM4E MINISTER, THE HON. P.<br />
J. KEATINGs ARUiNGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY, WASHINGTON,<br />
US. A, SUNDAY 12 SEPTEMBER 199)<br />
J. Why wson't you be attending the sipnlng ceremony tomorrow?<br />
F'M: BerAuSe I ouly have a couple of days here and so I have rescheduled some of the<br />
Tuesday meetings onto Mooday, to which came for the Trade Secretary, Mr<br />
Kantor and the Secretary of the Treasury. -I'll get a chance to meet them on the<br />
Monday which I wouldik't otherwise do. The President baying scheduled our<br />
meeting on the Tuesday which of course I think Is entirely appropriate given the<br />
weight and circumstauce of what's happening the day before.<br />
3: Did you seek a meeting with the CIA Director, Mr Keating and for what<br />
purpose?<br />
PM: Well that's beena a permanent part of the program, from the time the program<br />
was developed for the purpose simply that this gentleman is director of ali<br />
American intelligecce and we, as you know, have a intelligence partnership witb<br />
the United States and an important one.<br />
J: Will you be us~ drg up with Mr Clintoo the trade issues that have caused friction<br />
in the relationship?<br />
PM: Welk, I think for the President I will leave the discussion on the broader issues.<br />
That is, the broader bilateral aad multilateral Issues and that... mean, the point<br />
of the visit is to get to know him to have the chance to meet an American<br />
Administration in its formnative days at a time when there is a coincidence of<br />
interests between Australia and the United States. These are the things to<br />
concentrate on rather thav scrabble around over a particular issue which I think is<br />
better left to the discussions with the particular ministers who are deating with<br />
them.<br />
J: Won't he have his mind on other tbings? Like the Middle East? J-.41 </p>
<p>.2-<br />
PM: Wellt I thin the Middle Exst ceremony On MOnday Will probably I think<br />
Governnents tend to do things in discrete ways. One handles one issue at a time<br />
one day and something elme the next. I think that the intCests Australia now has<br />
in trade, that is with such thigs as the Uruguay Round and with AYEC also<br />
happen to be on the top of the United States agenda. So I think, therefore, they<br />
are very much contemporary issues and contemporary issues of the Prcsident.<br />
J: Shouldn't you take every opportuity, My Keating, to forcefully put the plight of<br />
Australian rural producers?<br />
PM-, ITl be putting it and I wil mention it probably over the lunch. But for the key<br />
discussiovs I'd 10( e to keep them ou to the big mainframe issues which wil] affect<br />
Australia way into the futurye.<br />
1: On APEC then. will you be tying to get any ind of endorsement from M<br />
Clinton for the Summit in Seattle actually moving towards maing APECa<br />
genuine economic Community?<br />
PM: Well, I think the whole point aboat the APEC m~ inisterial meetings to date four<br />
of them whicb we have had since its inc--pffitb and now the meeting of leaders<br />
and such things as the development of a trade and investment framework<br />
agreement and the work program; all of these things provide the capacity for the<br />
natiorL states of APEC to get to kMOW one Aa6othe, to begin workin cooperative<br />
fratmeworks, to be developing agendas together to develop a sense of economic<br />
community. And that' s the very essnce of it<br />
1: But isn't EB? the most pressing issue in the relationship?<br />
PM: No, I don't tink it is. I think the most pressing issu~ e in the relationship is the<br />
Uruguay Round and APEC to get Australia's long run interests set. EEl' and the<br />
United States' willingness to deal with the Export Enhancement Program~ in terms<br />
of the azeas in which these subsidies go ! I will be making it clear to the<br />
admiinisiration that we've appreciated the assurances we've had in the past of not<br />
extnding EEP into other areas. But I am not bere just simply to make those<br />
trade points. I mean. that's the key point about this visit, it's about the longer<br />
run and ' broader Issues.<br />
J; Mr Keating, bow do you see Austi-alia's relationship with the United States<br />
changin given that the Cold War is over and also Australia's mnaking a bigger<br />
push into Asia?<br />
PM: Well, I thiak it is changing, as the United States' relationship with the world is<br />
changin with the Cold War overlay removed. And that meaxns, therefore, that </p>
<p>3-<br />
events will have a mofe regional focus and the relatiouship the United States has<br />
with countries will aecetsszil change because of xheir regional complion and<br />
regional fit. This is also true of AustraUl<br />
3: Mr Keating, NAMT is also a big issue in the U. S. How do you see APEC fitting<br />
In with NAFrA if the U. S ( inaudible)<br />
PM.-Well. NAFTA is a North Arnerkcam trading agreement and if North America were<br />
to b~ e mterated with APEC it would be an entirely consistent thing. Were it to<br />
be The Ulnited States and Canada and Mexico in an agreement I don't see that as<br />
being in anly way different to the individual parts.-the United States or Canada<br />
being Involved with APEC.<br />
I1 Is there a rea chance that your talks won't be effective as tbey otherwise would<br />
have been bad the Middle East developments not occurred at this time?<br />
PM-don't think that's true. I think maybe the coDverse fs trUe. That is, I think I<br />
now have more time with the President on the Tuesday than I was going to have<br />
on the Monday. And I think the United States appreciates the fact that Australia<br />
= a see the weight of what is being concluded on Monday. I think they<br />
appreciate countries which have az appropriate sense of priority and magnitude.<br />
But bemause the issueji which are on our agenda are also very much on their<br />
agenda and they have been coperatingwith Australia ic tbem. I'm really<br />
looking forward to the meeting and I hope the President is too.<br />
1: Going back to Dr Evart Australia has played, In many ways, a key role in IsraeL<br />
Does the fact that we're not going now reflect our attitude to the Middle East<br />
and Israel Itself?<br />
PM: No. No, we've tot been part of the peace process.<br />
J: Mr K~ eating are you surprised that the Governor General has entered the<br />
republic-an debate?<br />
PM: I haven't caught up on his views.<br />
1. Prime Minister, your predecessor, Mr Hawke, bas suggested that conservatives are<br />
-Lt an aricle in the London newspapers over the weekend winning the<br />
intellectual debate on the republic and that all hes heard from the prorepublicans<br />
is einotionalism. Is that the way you see it?<br />
PM: Well, no and I think that what you'll bear from~ the iepublicas, so to speak, is in </p>
<p>.4.<br />
the first instance tbe report of the task force, the committee, which will look at<br />
ways of making a competent ehange to a republic. And I think the music starts<br />
after that.<br />
J: Do you believe that the mooarchists have made a few bits though?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so. Look, Australia wil] become a republic as inevitably as we<br />
are standing here. And it's about modalities, forms and timing. So I don't think<br />
the monuarchists, as you put it, have made any bits at all.<br />
End s. </p>
