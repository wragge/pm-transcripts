PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No.~ 199<br />
8 March 1974<br />
AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL FOR THE ARTS<br />
The Visual Arts Board of the Australian Council<br />
for the Arts has embarked on an imaginative project<br />
known as " Art in Public". The Board believes it has a<br />
responsibility to provide works of art in areas that are<br />
culturally underprivileged. It wants these works to<br />
be in public places where people will see and enjoy them.<br />
I am happy to announce that I have approved the<br />
first three projects for the " Art in Public" program.<br />
The first of them will be in Adelaide. The Board<br />
will be granted $ 15,000 to commission a major piece of<br />
sculpture at the Regency Park Centre for Crippled Children,<br />
Adelaide. The sculpture will become an important part<br />
of the children's environment.<br />
The Board will also be granted $ 10,000 towards the<br />
cost of erecting a fountain designed by Mr. Robert Woodward<br />
( the creator of the El Alamein Fountain in Kings Cross)<br />
at the intersection of River and Northwood Road, Lane Cove,<br />
and $ 5,000 for a sculpture to be placed in the<br />
garden surrounding the Preston City Library, Melbourne.<br />
