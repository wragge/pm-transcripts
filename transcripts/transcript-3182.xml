    <content><![CDATA[<p>AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL FOR THE ARTS</p>
<p>The Visual Arts Board of the Australian Council for the Arts has embarked on an imaginative project known as " Art in Public". The Board believes it has a responsibility to provide works of art in areas that are culturally underprivileged. It wants these works to be in public places where people will see and enjoy them. </p>
<p>I am happy to announce that I have approved the first three projects for the " Art in Public" program.</p>
<p>The first of them will be in Adelaide. The Board will be granted $ 15,000 to commission a major piece of sculpture at the Regency Park Centre for Crippled Children,<br />Adelaide. The sculpture will become an important part of the children's environment.</p>
<p>The Board will also be granted $ 10,000 towards the cost of erecting a fountain designed by Mr. Robert Woodward ( the creator of the El Alamein Fountain in Kings Cross) at the intersection of River and Northwood Road, Lane Cove, and $ 5,000 for a sculpture to be placed in the garden surrounding the Preston City Library, Melbourne.</p>
