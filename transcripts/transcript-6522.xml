I 76<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
E. O. E. -PROOF ONLY<br />
PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE WITH LOCAL MEDIA,<br />
LAUNCESTON 23 OCTOBER 1983<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, is it Federal Government policy<br />
that the responsibility for nurs~ s education be transferred<br />
from universities to colleges of advanced education by 1990?<br />
PM: It's not from universities.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sorry, put in control<br />
PM: As it exists now, nurses training is hospital based essenitially.<br />
We have responded to requests from the Nurses Federations themselves<br />
and a number of State Governments, that the system of nurse<br />
education should be shifted from a hospital based approach to the<br />
colleges of advanced education. This has been pressed upon us by<br />
the nurses organisations of Australia and, as I say, by some States,<br />
and we have responded to it. And the decision that was taken to<br />
it as a Cabinet is that this transformation would take place with<br />
the last change-over taking place in 1990, so that by 1993 it will<br />
be completely based on CAEs. Now this has met with the approval,<br />
as I say, of the nurses organisations and all other States. Here,<br />
apparently, there has been a suggestion by this State Government<br />
or State Minister that you should have something different, that<br />
you should go into the universities. You can't possibly have a<br />
differential situation like that where the rest of Australia is<br />
willingly through their governments, the Territories and the<br />
Ministers organisations, basing it on the CAE system and here in<br />
this State have a two stream situation of the CAE and the<br />
university. I assunxe that good sense will prevail here and that<br />
the CAEs will be abl'e to negotiate with -the State Government<br />
as will happen in every other State. </p>
