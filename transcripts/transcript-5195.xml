PRIME MINISTER THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 15 1979 v9o<br />
from the Press Office SUMMARY OF<br />
The Opposition today called for the resignation of the Attorney-General.<br />
the Minister for Social Security and the Minister for Administrative<br />
Services. for tailing in their Ministerial responsibilities in<br />
the controversial Greek conspiracy case. Intense questioning<br />
by the Opposition centred on two issues allegations of illegal<br />
phone tapping and the offer of a $ 200,000 reward to an informer.<br />
Senator Guilfoyle today read a three page statement from her<br />
Director General which categorically denied that he or the<br />
Department had done anything to endorse, facilitate or authorise<br />
payment of a reward and that no consideration had been given to<br />
an amount of $ 200,000. Mr Lionel Bowen interviewed. Says he<br />
wants three heads of this issue because there are three Ministers<br />
who either do not know what their departments have done or are not<br />
prepared to find out and in one outstanding case, there is a Minister<br />
who says he does not know what the law is. Mr Bowen questions the<br />
propriety of offering sums of money, for which they are responsible,<br />
as reward money. On the question of ministerial responsibility,<br />
professor of law at Latrobe University believes the concept is more<br />
blurred than it used to be but since the days of the Whitlam, government<br />
ministers are now less likely to ' carry the can and accept<br />
responsibility for any inaccurate advice they may receive from their<br />
departmental heads.<br />
Detective Chief Inspector Thomas was again questioned today about<br />
the involvement of the government in the proposed payment of money<br />
to the police informer and about his dealings with government<br />
departments. Wlhen asked who was to decided what payment should be<br />
made to the informer, he replied, " The Cabinet". Before this<br />
disclosure it had been assumed from documents tendered in court<br />
that this decision would be made by the Commonwealth-Police who<br />
had carried out negotiations with Mr Marcus before the investigations<br />
were properly launched in 1977. After this was made public,<br />
Inspector Thomas was questioned on what criteria would have t~ o be<br />
satisfied before the informer was actually paid by the cabinet.<br />
Thomas agreed that he had written a confidential report in which.<br />
it was stated that: the Police Commissioner had agreed that the<br />
payment of $ 200,000 could ' well be a proper amount if certain<br />
conditions were met'. Thomas conceded du~ ing cross examination<br />
that he personally had destroyed documents relating to discus-sions<br />
with. Mr Marcus in 1977 well before the publicised raids and arrests<br />
and afterwards. HE! said he had done so to maintain confidentiality<br />
essential to relations between the police and their informers.<br />
A report tabled in Federal Parliament blasts both. the Commonwealth.<br />
Police and State police forces for a serious failure to co-operate<br />
and co-ordinate with each other. The report on Australia's capability<br />
against terrorism was prepared by Mr Justice Hope and was-specially<br />
commissioned by Mr Fraser after the Hilton bombing. In his-report<br />
he also criticised the development of the State police paramilitary<br />
forces arguing that capability in that field should best be left<br />
with. the defence forces<br />
Wild storms cut a corridor of devastation costing millions of<br />
dollars across South Australia last night.<br />
There was an outcry in Australia when Australian-. aid destined for<br />
East Timor was being held up in the docks in Djakarta. Now-the<br />
tables have been turned because Red Cross workers in Indonesia say that<br />
./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
urgently food supplies for East Timor are being held up by<br />
shipping delays in Australia. o0o---</p>
