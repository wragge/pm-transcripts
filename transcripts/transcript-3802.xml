SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. E, G. WHITLAM, Q. C, M. P.<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE MEETING OF THE CAPITAL CITY LORD MAYORS,<br />
27 JUNE 1975, AT THE TOWN HALL, CITY OF SYDNEY<br />
My LORD MAYORS,<br />
WE LAST MET 18 MONTHS AGO IN CANBERRA. WE MEET<br />
AGAIN TODAY IN THE TOWN HALL OF THE CITY WHICH GREW<br />
FROM THE FIRST EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT IN AUSTRALIA, 187<br />
YEARS AGO. IN 1842 IT BECAME THE FIRST MUNICIPALITY<br />
IN NEW SOUTH WALES. IT IS INDEED AN APPROPRIATE VENUE<br />
FOR A MEETING BETWEEN THE HEADS OF AUSTRALIA'S CENTRAL<br />
CITIES AND ITS NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.<br />
TODAY, WE WILL BE DISCUSSING IDEAS OF MUTUAL<br />
CONCERN. WE WILL BE IDENTIFYING AREAS WHERE OUR<br />
OFFICERS CAN HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS. THERE HAVE<br />
ALREADY BEEN REGULAR MEETINGS BETWEEN OFFICIALS<br />
OF THE CAPITAL CITIES SECRETARIAT AND THE DEPARTMENT<br />
OF URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND IT IS MY<br />
HOPE THAT THESE COOPERATIVE EFFORTS CAN BE FURTHER<br />
EXTENDED. </p>
<p>-2<br />
THE CAPITAL CjTIES<br />
YOU HAVE NOT COME TOGETHER TODAY TO REPRESENT<br />
LOCAL GOVERNNENT GENERALLY, WLE SEEK DISCUSSIONS Oil<br />
MATTERS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN TO THE CAPITAL CITIES.<br />
YOU ARE SEP-KING RECOGNITION FROM THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT OF THE SPECIAL PROBLEMS WHICH THE CAPITAL<br />
CITIES SUFFER AND THE NEED FOR SPECIAL MEASURES TO<br />
SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS.<br />
WITH THE OBVIOUS EXCEPTION OF BRISBANE, THE<br />
FUNCTIONS PERFORMED BY THE CAPITAL CITY COUNCILS<br />
DIFFER FROM' THOSE SUBURBAN AUTHORITIES IN EACH<br />
METROPOLIS IN SCALE AND LOCATION, RATHER THAN<br />
FUNCTION. AT THE SAME TIME, WE ALL ACCEPT THAT IT<br />
IS DIFFICULT TO GENERALISE ACROSS THE RANGE OF CAPITAL<br />
CITIES AS THEY EACH DIFFER TO SOME DEGREE.<br />
11E ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CAPITAL CITY COUNCILS DO<br />
UNDERTAKE HIGHER LEVELS OF SPENDING DUE PARTLY TO<br />
THE HIGHER COSTS IN PROVIDING SERVICES IN CENTRAL<br />
CITY LOCATIONS. HIGHER STANDARDS OF SERVICES ARE<br />
OFTEN DEMANDED AND THERE ARE, SPECIAL SERVICES WHICH<br />
ARE NOT WHOLLY USED BY RATEPAYERS. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
GENERALLY, YOU HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF<br />
PROPERTY EXEMPT FROM RATING AND THIS INCLUDES PROPERTY<br />
OWNED BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT. YOU HAVE EXTENSIVE<br />
PARKLANDS AND CULTURAL FACILITIES WHICH ARE USED BY<br />
THE PEOPLE OF THE WHOLE METROPOLIS.<br />
ON THE OTHER HAND THESE SPECIAL PROBLEMS ARE<br />
NOT UNIQUE TO CAPITAL CITY COUNCILS. SEASIDE COUNCILS<br />
ARE REQUIRED TO COPE WITH THE INFLUX OF VISITORS<br />
USING THEIR BEACHES AND RECREATION FACILITIES, SOME<br />
SUBURBAN OR COUNTRY TOWN COUNCILS HAVE VERY LARGE<br />
AREAS OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY OR OTHER NON RATEABLE<br />
PROPERTY WdHICH CAN SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THEIR<br />
INCOME PROSPECTS. IN CERTAIN OF THE SMALLER CAPITAL.<br />
CITIES THE ROBLEMS WHICH ARE FACED ARE NOT THAT<br />
DIFFERENT FROM THE PROBLEMS OF CITIES SUCH AS<br />
NEWCASTLE AND WOLLONGONG.<br />
MDDITIONALLY; MUCH OF THE EXPENDITURE OF THE<br />
CAPITAL CITY COUNCILS IS DEVOTED TO WORKS AND<br />
SERVICES WHICH ENSURE THE CONTINUED VIABILITY OF<br />
THE CITY AS A COMMERCIAL CENTRE OF THE METROPOLIS, m / I4 </p>
<p>THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE HIGH LEVEL OF RATEABLE<br />
VALUES WHICH IN TURN RESULT IN ABOVE AVERAGE REVENUE<br />
RAISING CAPACITIES WITH WHICH TO FINANCE THOSE<br />
ACTIVITIES, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US ALL TO RECOGNISE AT<br />
THE OUTSET THAT THESE DIFFICULTIES AND PROBLEMS<br />
COULD BE ALLEVIATED BY MEANS OTHER THAN GRANTS<br />
FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. INSTITUTIONAL<br />
REARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE EXAMINED. THE ADEQUACY<br />
OF THE PRESENT STRUCTURE OF METROPOLITAN LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT AND SCHEMES FOR COST SHARING BETWEEN<br />
THE CAPITAL CITIES AND OTHER AUTHORITIES IN THE<br />
METROPOLITAN AREA ARE TWO POSSIBLE AREAS WORTHY<br />
OF CONSiKDATION.<br />
AuSTRALIAm GRANTS CoMISSION<br />
I RECOGNISE THAT THE ROLE OF THE GRANTS<br />
COMMISSION IS OF CONCERN TO YOU. I SHOULD EMPHASISE<br />
AT THE OUTSET THAT THE COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT<br />
BODY HEADED BY A VERY INDEPENDENTLY MINDED CHAIRMAN. 11 </p>
<p>DECISIONS ON METHODOLOGY REST W JH THE COMMISSION<br />
AND I, FOR ONE, CANNOT 4T4= ATE ITS<br />
REPORT FOR 1975-76,<br />
IN-ITS 1974 REPORT ON FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES, THE GRANTS COMMISSION<br />
RECOMMENDED THE ALLOCATION OF $ 56,4M DURING THE<br />
FOLLOWING FINANCIAL YEAR FOR GENERAL REVENUE FISCAL<br />
EQUALISATION GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES, I<br />
SHOULD STRESS THE WORD " EQUALISATION". WE CONSIDER<br />
THAT THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES WITH THE GREATEST<br />
PROBLEMS AND LEAST MEANS OF HELPING THEMSELVES SHOULD<br />
RECEIVE THE MOST ASSISTANCE, THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE<br />
CHARTER OF THE GRANTS COMMISSION. C-T<br />
HAVE SAID, THAT I CANNOT AaT.'-IP* TE WHAT<br />
RECOMMENDATIONS THE COMMISSION WILL MAKE ON THE<br />
QUESTION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE CAPITAL<br />
CITIES. I RECOGNISE THAT LAST YEAR THE COMMISSION<br />
RECOMMENDED A $ 2M GRANT TO THEBRISBANE CITY<br />
COUNCIL IN RECOGNITION OF THE SPECIAL SITUATION OF<br />
BRISBANE COMPARED TO THE OTHER CAPITAL CITY COUNCILS, ,/ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMISSION HAS HAD THE BENEFIT<br />
OF THE VIEWS OF THE AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL FOR LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATIONS WHICH HAS MADE SUBMISSIONS<br />
ON BEHALF OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT GENERALLY, I WILL READ<br />
THE SHORTLY TO BE DELIVERED GRANTS COMMISSION REPORT<br />
WITH GREAT INTEREST,<br />
SPECIFIC PURPOSE GRANTS<br />
YOU WILL ALL BE AWARE OF THE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE<br />
IN THE LEVEL AND RANGE OF SPECIFIC PURPOSE GRANTS<br />
WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, WE ARE NOW INVOLVED<br />
IN A COMPr-. ENSIVE SYSTEM OF GRANTS TO LOCAL BODIES.<br />
IN 1973-74, GRANTS WERE MADE DIRECTLY TO<br />
LOCAL AUTHCRITIES FOR AGED PERSONS HOMES, DELIVERED<br />
MEALS, HOME NURSING, SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT, CHILD<br />
CARE, ABORIGINAL ADVANCEMENT, AND COMMUNITY ARTS.<br />
ASSISTANCE WAS ALSO GIVEN TO LOCAL AERODROMES<br />
ALTHOUGH THIS CATEGORY IS UNLIKELY TO BE OF GREAT<br />
CONCERN TO YOU TODAY, </p>
<p>-7<br />
PAYMENTS HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE THROUGH THE STATES<br />
FOR SEWERAGE AND ROADS AND IN CERTAIN AREAS, FOR<br />
URBAN DEVELOPMENT GENERALLY AND FOR AREA IMPROVEMENT.<br />
IN 1974-75 my GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED NEW OR EXPANDED<br />
PROGRAMS FOR CHILD CARE CENTRES, PRE-SCHOOLS,<br />
REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT, AND ASSISTANCE TO<br />
REGIONAL ORGANISATIONs, THE AUTAINASSISTANCE<br />
PLAN HAS ALSO PROVIDED FUNDS FOR LOCAL PROJECTS.<br />
IT IS NOT PRESENTLY POSSIBLE TO PRECISELY<br />
CALCULATE IN FINANCIAL TERMS THE GROWTH IN SPECIFIC<br />
PURPOSE ASSISTANCE. THE DIFFERENCES IN FUNCTIONS<br />
CARRIED ON BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN EACH STATE<br />
OR PARTS 3F STATES AND THE WAY IN WHICH FUNDING OF<br />
PROGRAMS -7 SOMETIMES LINKED WITH STATE FUNDED<br />
PROGRAMS, MAKES THE TASK DIFFICULT. SUFFICE TO<br />
SAY THAT THE LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN<br />
CONSIDERA3LE, AND WHEN ADDED TO FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE<br />
FROM OTHER SOURCES, WE BELIEVE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS BEEN GIVEN SUBSTANTIAL HELP IN PROVIDING BOTH<br />
BASIC LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES AS WELL AS<br />
THOSE MORE-* PERSONAL SERVICES WHICH OUR COMMUNITY<br />
HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY DEMANDING. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
IT IS OUR AIM TO KEEP UNDER REVIEW THE TERMS<br />
AND CONDITIONS OF SPECIFIC PURPOSE GRANTS, WE NEED<br />
TO GUARD AGAINST OVERLAP AND DEVISE PROCEDURES<br />
WHEREBY THE DETAILED DECISION-MAKING CAN BE DEVOLVED<br />
TO UNITS OF GOVERNMENT CLOSE TO THE PEOPLE.<br />
ON 18 JUNE 1975 1 RELEASED A STATEMENT OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S POLICY ON REGIONALISM. AMONGST<br />
OTHER THINGS I. SAID THAT A REGIONAL POLICY IS BASED<br />
ON THE CONCEPT THAT SOME PROGRAMS AND SERVICES OF<br />
GOVERNMENT ARE MOST EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY<br />
PLANNED, CO-ORDINATED AND DELIVERED AT A LEVEL<br />
INTERMEDIATE TO THAT OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
AND THAT ThE POLICY IS BASED ON THE CONTINUED EXISTENCE<br />
OF FEDER. L. STATE AND LOCAL STRUCTURES.<br />
AT THE CONFERENCE WITH PREMIERS ON -19 JUNE I<br />
INVITED PREMIERS TO JOIN THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CO-OPERATIVE PLANNING<br />
ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE BETTER ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES<br />
WITHIN FUNCTIONS. ,19/ 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
THE STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE AGREED TO FURTHER<br />
DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN OFFICERS ON THE POSSIBILITIES<br />
OF CO-OPERATIVE PLANNING. I WOULD HOPE THAT<br />
AGREEMENT ON A GENERAL APPROACH CAN BE REACHED IN<br />
THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, OBVIOUSLY FULL IMPLEMENTATION<br />
MAY TAKE SOME YEARS, BUT YOU CAN HAVE MY ASSURANCES<br />
THAT THE PLACE AND ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN<br />
ANY CONSULTATION AND PLANNING ARRANGEMENTS WILL<br />
BE OF PRIME CONCERN TO THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT.<br />
WE ALSO RECOGNISE THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION<br />
ABOUT THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE<br />
WHICH ARE A" VAILABLE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT.<br />
AT OUR 1L' 37S MEETING, YOU MADE COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE<br />
AND AS A DRECT RESULT THE DEPARTMENT OF URBAN AND<br />
REGIONAL 1E'--'/"= LOPMEN4T PRODUCED A BOOKLET IN MAY 1974.<br />
WHICH GAVE DETAILS OF THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS. THAT<br />
BOOKLET IS NOW BEING REVISED AND SHOULD BE AVAILABLE<br />
SHORTLY. </p>
<p>11<br />
IT IS TO BE UNDERTAKEN IN LIAISON WITH THE NEW<br />
ZEALAND DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND A<br />
COMPREHENSIVE WORK PROGRAM HAS BEEN PREPARED<br />
INVPLVING ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT, IT IS INTENDED<br />
TO PRODUCE A REPORT BY THE END OF OCTOBER<br />
ADVISING GOVERNMENTS ON POSSIBLE MEASURES TO TACKLE<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, AND<br />
FURTHER RESEARCH.<br />
URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT<br />
I UNDERSTAND THAT MY COLLEAGUE, MR TOM UREN,<br />
THE MINISTER FOR URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT, HAS<br />
MADE SCi REMARKS ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE CENTRAL<br />
BUSINESS DISTRICTS OF AUSTRALIAN CITIES IN THE<br />
CONTEXT CF THE WHOLE CITY. IT IS CERTAINLY MY<br />
EXPERIENCE, FOR ALL HIS TALK ABOUT GENTLENESS,<br />
THAT TOm UREN CAN BE BLUNT WHEN HE IS TALKING<br />
ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH GREATLY CONCERNS HIM.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMS AND POLICIES<br />
CANNOT BE VIEWED IN ISOLATION, ALONG WITH THE<br />
MAJOR DECISIONS WHICH YOU TAKE, THEY SHOULD BE<br />
DEVELOPED WITHIN A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK IN WHICH<br />
THEY AND OTHER INITIATIVES IN URBAN AND REGIONAL<br />
DEVELOPMENT THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA ARE SEEN AS<br />
PART OF A COORDINATED WHOLE. ,/ 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
THE BREADTH OF RESOURCES WHICH NOW HAVE TO<br />
BE CHANNELLED IN THE DIRECTION OF URBAN AND REGIONAL<br />
DEVELOPMENT AND THE NATIONAL PRIORITY NOW ACCORDED<br />
TO THE PROBLEMS OF CITIES AND REGIONS PUTS A HEAVY<br />
RESPONSIBILITY ON THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO SEE<br />
THAT RESOURCES ARE USED EFFICIENTLY AND ARE<br />
DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA, WITHTHESE<br />
CONCERNS, AS WELL AS ITS POLICIES ON THE<br />
LOCATION OF PUBLIC SERVICE EMPLOYMENT, THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT ITS<br />
DECISIONS ARE NOT TAKEN IN ISOLATION. IN THE SAME<br />
MANNER, THE CAPITAL CITIES COUNCILS SHOULD RECOGNISE<br />
THAT THE EFFECTS AND ACTIONS OF POLICIES OF ALL<br />
CAPITAL.-CITIES DO HAVE FUNDAMENTAL CONSEQUENCES<br />
FOR S! L-=' CUNDING AREAS OUTSIDE THEIR IMMEDIATE<br />
RESPONS:-31LITIES. 0,' LCTHMIES OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THESE<br />
GENERAL ISSUES WITH You. THIS CONSULTATION AND'<br />
DISCUSSION SHOULD CONTINUE AT OUR LEVEL AS WELL<br />
AS BETWEEN OUR OFFICIALS. IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT<br />
AT SOME FUTURE DATE WE SHOULD INCLUDE LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT GENERALLY IN OUR ROUND TABLE DISCUSSIONS. / 113 </p>
<p>13<br />
IAM SURE THAT TODAY'S DISCUSSIONS WILL BE AN<br />
IMPORTANT EVENT IN THE CONTINUED PROGRAM OF<br />
CONSULTATION BETWEEN THE NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS<br />
OF THE GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
