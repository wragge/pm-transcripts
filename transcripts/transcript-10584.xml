    <content><![CDATA[<p> The Federal Government has confirmed its</p>
<p>   commitment to promote job security, with</p>
<p>   a sensible and practical new package for</p>
<p>   the TCF industries.</p>
<p> The package will help to develop sustainable,</p>
<p>   internationally competitive textiles, clothing,</p>
<p>   leather and footwear (TCF) industries in</p>
<p>   Australia.</p>
<p> It is designed to assist in securing jobs</p>
<p>   in the TCF industries by encouraging additional</p>
<p>   investment and promoting the development</p>
<p>   of an internationally competitive TCF sector</p>
<p>   in the lead-up to the free trade environment</p>
<p>   beyond 2010.</p>
<p> The Government's new TCF package provides</p>
<p>   a practical transition, designed to promote</p>
<p>   investment and innovation in the TCF industries</p>
<p>   and encourage the development of long-term,</p>
<p>   sustainable, real jobs.</p>
<p> The key features of the package are:</p>
<p>   * The current schedule for TCF tariff</p>
<p> phasing will continue through to 2000.</p>
<p>   * TCF tariffs will be maintained at</p>
<p> the same level from 1 July 2000 until</p>
<p> 1 January 2005. </p>
<p>   *  The Government will introduce legislation</p>
<p> in the current session to implement a</p>
<p> reduction in TCF tariffs on 1 January</p>
<p> 2005 (see attachment). </p>
<p>   *  Develop forward looking action agendas</p>
<p> with industry for wool, cotton, leather</p>
<p> and fashion to identify what can be done</p>
<p> to make more use of Australia's natural</p>
<p> advantages in these areas. </p>
<p>   *  Establish a TCF Investment Programme</p>
<p> designed to build globally competitive</p>
<p> capacity in the industry. </p>
<p>   *  Establish a $10 million TCF Technology</p>
<p> Development Fund and provide $10 million</p>
<p> for a national centre of excellence for</p>
<p> TCF training. </p>
<p>   *  Establish a new Market Development</p>
<p> Programme with funding of $2.5 million</p>
<p> per year to develop and implement firm</p>
<p> based strategies to increase export capabilities.</p>
<p>   * An expanded Overseas Assembly Programme</p>
<p> to enable increased use of Australian</p>
<p> textiles. </p>
<p>   * Examine removal of anomalies in TCF</p>
<p> by-laws and tariff concessions. </p>
<p>   * There will be a review of TCF tariffs</p>
<p> in 2005 which will take account of our</p>
<p> APEC commitments and progress on market</p>
<p> access. </p>
<p> The period of consolidation between 2000</p>
<p>   and 2005 will enable Australian TCF firms</p>
<p>   to strengthen their competitive position</p>
<p>   after a period of significant change.</p>
<p> The Government is committed to ensuring</p>
<p>   Australia will meet its APEC commitment</p>
<p>   to free trade by 2010. The TCF industries</p>
<p>   have indicated their agreement to this objective.</p>
<p> Entry to the new TCF Investment Programme</p>
<p>   will be competitive, based on a commitment</p>
<p>   to high value-added activities of significance</p>
<p>   to Australia.</p>
<p> The TCF industries, as a result of the</p>
<p>   Government's plan, expect to see $400 million</p>
<p>   per year in new investment.</p>
<p> The Government's plan will encourage more</p>
<p>   value added activity in natural materials</p>
<p>   processing, design, research and development,</p>
<p>   marketing, and product assembly. It will</p>
<p>   encourage strategic alliances, joint ventures,</p>
<p>   and effective value chain management, as</p>
<p>   well as investment in skills development.</p>
