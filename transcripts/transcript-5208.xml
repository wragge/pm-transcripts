PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT TUESDAY, DECEMBER 4 1979<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, 4 TREASURY PLACE, MELBOURNE<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
The cabinet meetinq this morning and this afternoon has<br />
concentrated on making decisions that will be necessary for the<br />
Premiers' Conference and the Loan Council meeting which is being<br />
held on Friday. I believe it is going to be a very important<br />
Premiers' Conference and an important Loan Council 1reeting.<br />
We have made a number of decisions concerning the basic national<br />
development of Australia concering the investment by Australian<br />
governments, State and Commonwealth and the infrastructure that is<br />
necessary to support the much more major and very often much more<br />
costly investment and development by private enterprise concerns<br />
of many different kinds.<br />
We have made a number of decisions which build upon a historic Loan<br />
Council meeting held in Melbourne about this time last year<br />
when $ 1,700 million worth of national development projects<br />
were supported by the Commonwealth and the States working together in what<br />
was a breakthrough conference. It was a histoxic conference.<br />
Before coming to the nature of today's decision, I think it important<br />
to emphasise that these decisions are made necessary by the<br />
position Australia finds herself in at the beginning of the 1980s.<br />
They are made necessary to enable us to capitalise and grasp the<br />
opportunities that are open to us in the 1980s. They are necessary<br />
so that we can prepare the-way to what I believe can be an exciting<br />
and fulfilling decade for Australia.<br />
We would not be making these decisions if Australia was not in an<br />
international position to attract very significant development,<br />
investment funds from overseas so that the great resource projects<br />
can go ahead, so that the great power projects can go ahead now in<br />
an energy short world so that we can capitalise on the favoured<br />
position in which Australia finds herself and by developing<br />
coal-based electricity to achieve greater resource development<br />
in this country than might otherwise have been the case.<br />
That is already happening, notably in aluminium with $ 4 billion<br />
worth of investment and development in that area. Now, if these<br />
great projects are going to proceed, if. you need the power,.. the roads,<br />
the ports, the infrastructure which is necessary to support a much<br />
higher rate of investment and developmefit, and therefore, this is<br />
very much a question of responding to the challenge of the<br />
and looking to the future with confidence and a very great deal<br />
of optimism.<br />
If I can just remind you for a moment, the projects that were supported<br />
last year totalleda bit over $ 1.7 billion and In the coal area,<br />
$ 164 million was in coal loaders. $ 640 million was other resource<br />
development. The Dampier Perth gas line, the Redcliffe projectboth<br />
those are waiting on final decisions still, but the North West<br />
Shelf project is looking morbandmore favourable as each day passes<br />
and the Worslev Alumina project which was finally approved only a<br />
few days ago. $ 869 million of that original program has gone on<br />
power generation -the Loy Yang, hydro electric power in Tasmania, / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
the Eraring power station in New South Wales, power generation<br />
in Queensland and in the generation of power supply generation.<br />
And there are one or two more minor projects.<br />
But you will see from that initial program that the major part<br />
of the approvals were in the support of basic national development,<br />
national investment, in areas which are designed to support the<br />
investmebt and activities of private concerns, the development<br />
of the wealth and the growth of the economic base of Australia.<br />
The decisions that we have made for this forecoming Premiers'<br />
Conference and dependent upon the attitudes of the States, of<br />
course, were designed very much to build upon that. But since<br />
the last Premiers' Conference and Loan Council, the importance<br />
of the world energy position has been re-emphasised the shortage<br />
situation in oil suppl~ ies and the possibility with political<br />
instability that that could worse has led us to want to get<br />
a particular attention to energy based projects and ones which<br />
fit into the general pattern of our energy policies, encouraging<br />
the basic conservation of oil, encouraging the use of other forms<br />
of energy.<br />
Some of the projects that are supported, that we are prepared to<br />
support, will be are again dependent upon what the States do on<br />
Friday, have been very much influenced by the energy policy<br />
we now have in place.<br />
The Commonwealth will be proposing three matters for approval<br />
under the basic development program on its own account. This is<br />
a new venture. All the earlier proposals were State based proposals.<br />
Now on this occasion, we will be proposing the rebuilding on the<br />
standard guage on the Adelaide Crystal Brook railway at a cost of<br />
something like $ 60 million. That is a commercial and it will able<br />
to go ahead as quickly as the rail construction can be accommodated,<br />
and it was necessary because the existing construction team runs<br />
out of work at probably about October next year on the present line<br />
up to Alice Springs. Now, that next phase in the project will complete<br />
that particular link.<br />
But, we are also prepared to support what I believe is a much more<br />
exciting project, one which ought to capture the imagination of<br />
a very large of Australians, and that is the electrification of<br />
the Melbourne-Sydney railway link. Now, this is very much motivated<br />
at this time because of energy needs, energy requirements, saving<br />
in oil and the use of alternative forms of energy. What we will bE!<br />
proposing for Friday is an important study involving New South Wales,<br />
Victoria and the Commonwealth so that the Premiers' Conference and<br />
Loan Council in June can make firm and final decisions about the<br />
phasing, the costs and the rate of progress of construction.<br />
In other words, from our point of view, and subject to the agreement<br />
only of the States, it is a decision to go ahead but we need that<br />
examination, and out of that might well come a special authority for<br />
the construction phase of a kind which was present which the<br />
Snowy Mountains Authority and authorities were established by<br />
three governments.<br />
That is a venture which the. Commcnrwealth will be proposing and<br />
we hope very much will have the support of other States. There is<br />
a smaller project which is important for rural areas to achieve a<br />
greater rate of progress in the modernisation of telephone links / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
in coufttry areas for Telecom. Then, coming to the States, a<br />
very large part of the program again will be for electricity<br />
power generation. The program is upwards of $ 1,000 million,<br />
including the Commonwealth that is excluding the Sydney Melbourne<br />
rail link, that is separate. The tentative figure from the<br />
Department of Transport for that project would be $ 300 million<br />
but it is not included in firm approvals at this stage, ald will<br />
be a matter for later final decision.<br />
But upwards of $ 1,000 million including the other projects for<br />
approval on Friday, electricity generation, a further $ 490 million<br />
on top of the power generation projects approved last year.<br />
Oil powered conversion in a couple of States again is very much<br />
related to our energy objectives, and then rail electrification<br />
in at l~ east two States are again related to efficiency and<br />
energy objectives. Then there are a number of other more minor<br />
projects.<br />
Now, all in all, if these proposals do receive the final approval<br />
of the Loan Council and Premiers on Friday, the meeting last year<br />
and the meeting this year will have resulted in a number of<br />
historic decisions by State and Commonwealth governments which<br />
will enable this nation to move forward into the ' 80s, with<br />
great confidence, with great optimism, supporting in a very<br />
major way, the great national and international investment and<br />
development that has; taken place in Australian resources and<br />
in Australian energy projects.<br />
There are two other points where we propose an eximation with<br />
the Premiers and I have asked the P': emiers or Mr Anthony did<br />
on my behalf asked the Premiers to examine the ratr-. of<br />
electricity generation based on coal because there have been<br />
one or two instances, or certainly one instance in New South Wales,<br />
where a major indust~ rial project could not be sited in New South Wales<br />
because power generation is not kept up with the increased demand.<br />
Now, that is not said as a point of criticism aluminium smelters<br />
are vast consumers of power and new projects have been approved<br />
in New South Wales but there is one project that was running hanging<br />
because power generation would not be adequate under present<br />
arrangements for all the possibilities that were around.<br />
I think it is very important that Australia's industrial<br />
development not be held back because of lack of power, a lack<br />
of coal based electricity. So the Premiers have all been asked<br />
to examine the programs of electrification development<br />
production of electricity to see whether additional projects<br />
should be brought on stream.<br />
Now, that letter would not have had an impact on this particulhar<br />
Premiers' Conference. Some of the Premiers have responded to that<br />
particular approach that the matters would be for final decision at<br />
a later meeting.<br />
And the other matter where we want to make sure that we don't miss<br />
on major export and developmental opportunities by lack of infrastructure<br />
in Australia is in the export of steaming coal. We are inviting the<br />
Premiers to identify the ways, the port facilities, the infrastructure<br />
that is necessary to make sure that we can match the increasing<br />
international for steaming coal over the decades to the end of this<br />
century. So, those two initiatives also, I would imagine, are likely / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
to result in further co-operation between the States and the<br />
Commonwealth in the development of these resource projects.<br />
Question: Prime Minister, I am sorry to interrupt you before you had finished,<br />
but what I was going to ask was, do these decisions, is part of<br />
the thinking behind these decisions to create jobs, and in that<br />
sense, does that represent any change in the Commonwealth's<br />
thinking about spending Commonwealth money to create greater<br />
employment? Question: No, it doesn't indicate any change of policy in relation to that.<br />
Quite obviously, greater investment, more development creates more<br />
jobs. We have always argued that jobs have got to be based in<br />
real growth, real development, and that the government can't<br />
fudge that issue, ie make-work schemes that don't really make<br />
work which could result in some cases in less people'being<br />
employed overall than without the programs. I believe that that<br />
certainly happened in a number of countries in Europe. So, we<br />
want real investment, real growth, real development, real exports<br />
which will add to the number of jobs and opportunities available<br />
to Australians. So, these policies are very much motivated to<br />
get the private sector of the economy, working and moving as it<br />
is to have governments work in partnerthip with that, to consolidate<br />
it, to strengthen the move as I believe is happenind at the moment.<br />
The ldtest figure of private investment and development projects<br />
around Australia, firmly approved and committed or in the final<br />
feasibility stage was, I think, about $ 16 billion. That shows the<br />
extent of domestic and international interest in investment and<br />
development in Australia. But quite obviously, if that is going to<br />
be matched, governments have a role to play on their side of the<br />
major national development projects in seeing that the basic<br />
infrastructure is available, that we don't miss out on investment<br />
because power is not available or roads are not available or<br />
ports are not available or a coal loader is not in place. Therefore,<br />
it is very much a part of our total approach to preparing Australia<br />
for the 1898s, and very much a part of complimenting the other<br />
broad policies of the government get inflation down, keep it<br />
lower than our major trading partners to make it Au~ stralia<br />
competitive so we can sell, so we can have a stable economy<br />
and attract more investment, and against that stable background,<br />
export the fact that we do have major resources, major reserves<br />
of energy and especially coal in this country which can be brought<br />
together, as is happening in the case of aluminium in particular in<br />
a very spectaculor way, which can be brought together to achieve<br />
greater processing and greater activity within this country.<br />
So, it is all very much related to the growth and development<br />
of the Australian economy, to achieving more jobs in the Australian<br />
economy but, it doesn't indicate a change in approach anymore than<br />
the infrastructure programs of a year ago indicated a change of<br />
approach. It is an emphasis on an approach which is dependent upon<br />
the private sector moving forward and the decisions we have made,<br />
so long as they are supported on Friday and I have no reason<br />
to believe that the States will vote aqainst their own proposals,<br />
the decisions we made will certainly re-emphasise the basic<br />
thrust of our policies. </p>
<p>Question Mr. Fraser, is the Commonwealth willing to go ahead with<br />
all the projects ( inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I said we stand ready to support upwards of $ 1,000 million,<br />
which would cover them all. But there are one or two projects<br />
which might well be better financed in other ways, and we will<br />
be raising questions about those. You will note that I have not<br />
spoken about specific projects that had been proposed by<br />
the States, and I don't think it is proper for me to do so.<br />
I have spoken in general terms about electricity generation and<br />
other in broad categories but I haven't itemised.<br />
Question ( Inaudible).<br />
Prime minister<br />
Basically, we are prepared to support them but we do have some<br />
reservations in monetary projects that we think could be perhaps<br />
better financed in other ways. We will be raising those issues<br />
on Friday.<br />
Question Do you have a State figure there? You gave us the figure plus<br />
( inaudible).<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The State figure is about $ 800 million over eight years. The<br />
Commonwealth figures-well, the Telecom and Adelaide Crystal Brook<br />
will be a bit under $ 100 million.<br />
Question Each? Prime Minister<br />
No. The-two. Melbourne, Sydney rail electrification, on a very<br />
tentative figure by the Department of Transport $ 300 million, But<br />
that is not for approval in the firm final stage at this Premiers'<br />
Conference. We want to establish an agreement with the two States<br />
concerned to enable us all to be in a position to make final<br />
decisions in June.<br />
Question Just a couple of points of clarification. Firstly, ( inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I said upwards of 1,000.<br />
Question ( Inaudible) 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I said upwards of.<br />
Question ( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think you are being too specific. Upwards of 1,000 doesn't<br />
mean 1,000, it means upwards of. It means exactly what it says.<br />
Question On the ( inaudible) Melbourne. The Commonwealth has decided that<br />
that electrification will go ahead ( inaudible).<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We have decided thait it should go ahead. We need State agreement<br />
and appropriate arrangements in relation to it, yes.<br />
Question PM, didn't, on the Sydney Melbourne electrification, was that<br />
not vigorously ( inaud) by the States ( inaudible).<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There were some studies that I think Mr. Whitlamr might have looked<br />
at at some point, but the energy situation, the oil supply situation<br />
I think puts it into a much different focus than that in previous<br />
times. The rail electrification projects and there is more than<br />
one in the thing, it is not just Commonwealth involvement in<br />
that area are very much based in energy policies and conservation<br />
of fuel oils. Not only, but significantly, the conservation<br />
reason and as the price of fuel oil rises a very obvious economic<br />
justification for electrification.<br />
Question ( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The State projects are over a period of about 8 years.<br />
Question And the electrification?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That would be subject to decision in June. I would hope that<br />
it could proceed as rapidlyas construction could efficiently<br />
and economically be organised. I think once governments have made<br />
up their minds to undertake that kind of project it ought to be<br />
done as expeditiously as economic construction allows. We / 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
very much found with the construction of railways in South Australia,<br />
on the line up to Alice Springs, that they have operated so<br />
efficiently one is electrification, one is laying new track.-<br />
But they have been doing it so efficiently that we have had to<br />
provide additional funds as a result of them doing it quicker.<br />
If we had stayed within the original limitations it would have<br />
been done less quickly and less efficiently and at greater cost<br />
overall. That is just one example of where construction is best<br />
done really as quickly as the team involved can consummate it.<br />
Question Have you any estimate as to when it will be finished ( inaudible).<br />
Prime minister<br />
No, I haven't. I would prefer that to wait until we have had the<br />
papers put before us as a result of the examination over the<br />
next six months.<br />
Question Have you talked to Mr. Wran and M~ r. Hamer yet.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Not yet, no.<br />
Question Are you concerned that the State Premiers might see this as<br />
something of a sleight of hand. They have already made it clear<br />
that they don't think they are going to be happy with the<br />
allocation of funds if not this year from general revenue taxation<br />
( inaudible), if not this year then certainly next and before<br />
February... ( inaudible) comes into effect. Aren't you really saying,<br />
well, perhaps you are niot going to be happy with the funds you<br />
are getting from this source, but you can get more by borrowing.<br />
It is not money they get for free, so to speak, it is money they<br />
are going to have to pay back.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You wouldn't be able to use taxpayers funds in these sorts of<br />
projects anyway.<br />
Question I'm not saying that.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, but the two things; you suggested that you could use one<br />
instead of the other. I think that you will find that you are a<br />
bit in error, because the 39%, 40% formula is likely to lead to<br />
very substantial increases in funds to the States next year anyway. </p>
<p>8<br />
Question I certainly don't think<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You know quite well that every Premier approaches a Premiers'<br />
Conference in a somewhat dismal state of mind. Now that is<br />
traditional, and I believe and hope that thisowill be an exciting<br />
Premiers' Conference and which can be regarded as one in which<br />
the States and the Commonwealth working together to build for the<br />
1980s in a very realistic way. Now, the infrastructure proposals<br />
supported a year ago were accepted in that vein. I can see no<br />
reason to believe why the whole Premiers' Conference shouldn't<br />
be accepted in that vein.<br />
Question If I could get back to the point about things improving in the<br />
future. If that is the case, why is it suddenly going to change.<br />
Over the last, what, 4 years you have had to revert to the<br />
Whitlam formula.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Income tax collections are up very significantly this year, as<br />
you kniow, and that will mean that out of the normal incentive<br />
basis the States will get a very significant increase next year.<br />
Now that is already in the books and nothing can change that.<br />
So, that increase is there. I think that will tend to make the<br />
States a little happier for next year.<br />
Question If-I could put that a little differently: you are offering the<br />
States something like $ 1,000 million in loan funds, then you<br />
indicate you<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Except for the areas where there are Commonwealth initiatives.<br />
They have sought these projects.<br />
Question Yes, but ( inaudible) of $ 1,000 million.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Upwards of. / 9 </p>
<p>9<br />
Question Can you indicate to us what modifications with tax sharing<br />
arrangements you will be proposing.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Oh no. No.<br />
Question Can you tell us how many jobs you expect those decisions to create?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Mr. Viner will be doing some work on that and making a statement<br />
about it. But that would be after Friday.<br />
Question ( Inaudible) on the question of the re-shuffle?<br />
