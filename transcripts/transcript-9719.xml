PRIME MINISTER 89/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
RESIGNATION OF GOVERNOR-GENERAL<br />
The Queen's announcement of the resignation of the Honourable Bill Hayden<br />
as Governor-General marks the end of a distinguished term of service by a<br />
most highly respected Australian in this high office.<br />
On behalf of the Government, I place on record our appreciation of<br />
Mr Hayden's service to his country and our deep respect for the way in which<br />
he has carried out his duties. He will be relinquishing his appointment after<br />
seven years in office, the second longest term served by a<br />
Governor-General. It was a measure of our admiration for the contribution<br />
that he was making that the Government asked if he would extend his term<br />
for a period of two years.<br />
Bill Hayden's compassionate and inclusive style and his interest and concern<br />
for Australians of all walks of life have been complemented by the warmth<br />
and commitment which his wife, Dallas, has brought to Yarralumla. They<br />
have earned the affection of millions of Australians.<br />
As Bill steps down from office I extend, on behalf of the Australian people, our<br />
good wishes and our hope that he and Dallas will continue to enjoy health<br />
and happiness in the years ahead.<br />
CANBERRA 21 August 1995 </p>
