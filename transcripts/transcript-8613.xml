STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE MION P 0 KEATING MP<br />
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REFURBISH THE INDIAN PACIFIC<br />
The Federal Government has agreed to refurbish the Indian<br />
Pacific passenger trin-at a cost of about $ 12 million.<br />
This will allow the existing transcontinental service to<br />
be marketed as a first class tourist attraction. The<br />
refurbishment will occur at the Port Augusta wvorkshops<br />
over the next two years, providing Significant employment<br />
in that region.<br />
We will also upgrade South Australia's Islington rail<br />
workshops. at a cost of $ 4.4 million. Thie--Isilgt-o-n<br />
workshops will be connected to the national Standard<br />
gauge rail highway being created through the One Nation<br />
package announced in February.<br />
with the $ 3.5 million already being provided through One<br />
Nation for the Port Augusta workshops, these South<br />
Australian rail workshops will be well placed to compete<br />
for NationalRail Corporation work.<br />
These initiatives follow a number of measures for the<br />
rail industry in South Australia which are being<br />
implementeid through One Nation and other Federal<br />
programs. These include redevelopment of rail land no<br />
longer required by Australian National, and $ 8.4 million<br />
f or labour adjustment and regional employment<br />
initiatives. The Australian National Rail Commission has also been<br />
asked to provide the Government with a detailed business<br />
plan outlining an appropriate structure for AN in future.<br />
This will provide for an orderly transition to its new<br />
role with the establishment of the NatilonalRail<br />
C~ orporain<br />
The South Australian Government will be consulted on<br />
those aspects of this plan which affect South Australia.<br />

In addition, the NSW Government has agreed to guarantee<br />
AN access to the Broken Hill-Parkes line until September<br />
1997 to allow the Indian Pacific continued use of that<br />
