    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>DAVID KOCH: </strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull joins us now from Canberra. Prime Minister thanks for your time, you spoke with President Donald Trump yesterday and agreed China is the key to putting more economic pressure on the rogue nation. What if that doesn't work?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well, we don't want to get into hypotheticals, but the reality is, Kochie, that China has by far the biggest economic relationship with North Korea.</p>
<p>China is appalled by North Korea's conduct. They’ve condemned it. This latest nuclear test has sent tremors across the border into China.</p>
<p>They’re defying Beijing just as they are defying the whole global community.</p>
<p>Now China is implementing the most recent round of UN sanctions but we believe, President Trump and I believe that there needs to be more done.</p>
<p>So that’s going to be the focus of the UN Security Council’s discussions over the next few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH: </strong></p>
<p>In that phone call yesterday what did President Donald Trump ask you for?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well we talked about the strategy for bringing North Korea back to its senses, to its senses, and to stop this reckless conduct.</p>
<p>Our alliance is absolutely rock solid. We confirmed and affirmed our alliance. We have America's back, America has our back. We are joined at the hip.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH: </strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>And if there is an attack on America, we will come to America’s aid. If there is an attack on Australia, America will come to our aid. That is our alliance.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH: </strong></p>
<p>Well then how close are we to that happening? How close are we to war?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well, you are asking me how close is North Korea to launching an attack on the United States?</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH: </strong></p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well - I can't speculate on that.</p>
<p>An attack on the United States or its allies by North Korea would be met with overwhelming force.</p>
<p>As President Trump has said and Defense Secretary Mattis has said, it would be a suicide note by Kim Jong-un. It would be a catastrophe. Thousands would die. It would be an unmitigated catastrophe.</p>
<p>We are doing everything we can with our allies and our partners around the world to bring that stronger economic pressure on North Korea.</p>
<p>Our goal is to resolve this without conflict. </p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH: </strong></p>
<p>How scared are you of this situation at the moment?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>I am not someone that get’s scared. I’m very clear eyed about this, this is a very serious threat. Karl it’s the most dangerous time on the Korean Peninsula since the end of the Korean War.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH: </strong></p>
<p>Okay, so is this the equivalent of the Cuban missile crisis of the 60’s? Is that how close we are?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well, look it is in many respects a more challenging situation than the Cuban missile crisis. You see, in the Cuban missile crisis, the two parties that were the United States and the Soviet Union. What we have now is in North Korea a rogue regime that is not taking heed from anybody. It is not a client state of China. This is a very important point. China does not control North Korea. North Korea is not to China what Cuba was to the Soviet Union or what East Germany was to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>So North Korea is defying and challenging China, the United States, Japan, the whole global order and they have to be brought to their senses.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH: </strong></p>
<p>So this is worse than the Cuban missile crisis?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well, it is a more complex challenge-</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH: </strong></p>
<p>So it is worse?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>-than the Cuban missile crisis. Yes, it is. It is a more complex challenge, it really is.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH: </strong></p>
<p>Okay. Alright, let's move on to something a bit closer to home. The High Court is just hours away from deciding whether your same-sex marriage postal ballot can go ahead. If the postal vote is ruled to be unconstitutional, what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well Kochie, we don't have long to wait for the decision.</p>
<p>As you know we are confident in our legal position and we look forward to all Australians having their say and we encourage everybody to vote, to return the survey form and as you know, Lucy and I will be voting ‘yes’.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH: </strong></p>
<p>Okay, but what happens if the High Court says no?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Kochie, I’m not going to get into hypotheticals again. We’ve only got to wait until 2:15 I think until we get the answer.</p>
<p><strong>DAVID KOCH: </strong></p>
<p>Okay, alright, Prime Minister thanks for joining us.</p>
