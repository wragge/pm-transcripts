CONFERENCE OF THE PRESIDENTS OF THE<br />
NATIONAL MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY<br />
ASSOCIATIONS<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. William<br />
McMahon, M. P. 4 OCTOBER, 1972<br />
Mr. President and Gentlemen:<br />
This visit gives me the opportunity to welcome you<br />
collectively to Canberra and also to say something about the<br />
matters of special interest to both Government and industry.<br />
First, let me say that I am giving close attention<br />
personally to the representations you have made in recent months<br />
about the future of manufacturing in Australia, about current<br />
matters like the tariff review and trade practices, and about the<br />
Government's administrative system for dealing with manufacturers<br />
and manufacturing policy, and about the state of the economy in<br />
general. Let me take this last point first because it is against<br />
the background of the state of the economy that we measure the<br />
progress and the prospects of manufacturing industry.<br />
I believe that the worst is well behind us and that<br />
steadily and deliberately the economy will continue to gather<br />
strength, providing there are-no self-inflicted injuries resulting<br />
from prolonged industrial trouble and industrial lawlessness, and<br />
always providing that when wage increases take place, productivity<br />
increases are not far behind.<br />
The level of unemployment is being watched closely and<br />
the Government has already taken corrcctivc measures, through the<br />
Budget and other ways, to ensure that-unemployment falls.<br />
I am completely confident that we can overcome the<br />
problem to the satisfaction of the Australian people and the<br />
discomfort of the Labor Opposition and ' he President of the ACTU.<br />
To my mind it is tragic that there are sufficient numbers<br />
of people about who seem to have a ves~ ted interest in unemployment<br />
for purposes of political advantagi! that they can conmmand<br />
headlines in the media to the ext _ nt t:. iat they do.. 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
This is a time when by word and deed we should<br />
demonstrate confidence, each in our own way and in our own field.<br />
I ask manufacturers to join the Government in approaching the<br />
problems of the day in this fashion because manufacturers have<br />
an honoured place, a vital place, indeed an indispensable place,<br />
in this industrialised society of ours.<br />
Now I want to mention two or three matters<br />
as a positive act of reassurance by me, because i am aware that<br />
some of you are a little uncertain and anxious about the effect<br />
of Government policies on manufacturing industry.<br />
I refer to policies like the Tariff Board<br />
review which is already in progress and the revision to the<br />
Trade Practices legislation which has yet to comb before the<br />
Parliament. Here and now, I want to assure you that our<br />
fundamental political philosophy is unchanged. We are committed<br />
to the free enterprise philosophy, because we know it works to the<br />
benefit of the whole Australian community and that our policies are<br />
related to, and do not displace, that philosophy.<br />
I have told manufacturers on other occasions<br />
that neither I nor the Government will do anything to compromise<br />
the future of economic and efficient Australian industries, and<br />
more than that, we will continue to encourage and provide incentives<br />
to those industries. We seek your counsel and co-operation regularly.<br />
And we are Prepared to give the most careful consideration to<br />
ways and means of developing both those practices, if necessary<br />
by new arrangements. Mr President, in the last eighteen months, the<br />
Government has taken a new look-at every major field of Government<br />
activity. We have restored the investment allowance<br />
decided to continue the financial incentive<br />
provided under the Industrial Research<br />
and Development Scheme for a further five<br />
years<br />
-decided to extend the export incentives<br />
scheme beyond 30 June, 1973<br />
-made the most significant amendments to the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Act since 1947<br />
-announced important new measures on overseas<br />
takeovers<br />
and we will table the llono-, Dlies Commission and Trade Practices<br />
Bill and we will give time for informed public de-bate before we<br />
legislate. </p>
<p>3<br />
This to my mind is a sensible way because we get<br />
the benefit of public reaction, suggestions and criticisms before<br />
the final commitments are made.<br />
Of course, you have to live with criticism that<br />
you can't make up your mind quickly. But surely there is merit in<br />
such a course. A " hit and miss" policy would be as dangerous as<br />
the application of doctrinaire socialism to the business life of<br />
this country. And, believe me, those are the only alternatives<br />
to the way we act. Now, Mr President, may I say a word or two about<br />
tariffs. It's pretty clear to me that our tariff policy is still<br />
under fire from some groups. So let me go over some of the ground<br />
again very briefly. As a general principle, let me say this. In<br />
all industry matters within its jurisdiction, including tariffs,<br />
the Government is the body which makes the final decisions. It<br />
does so with a full exposure of the facts. It does so after taking<br />
the advice of its experts and considering the recommendations of<br />
its committees, tribunals and appointed authorities.<br />
The advice it seeks is objective and non-political.<br />
It comes from specialists, researching, studying and examining<br />
specialised fields. It is a major factor in political decisionmaking<br />
but it is not the only one. The decision a Government<br />
takes has to be made in practical terms. The theorist has his<br />
value and he is important. But he is not the decision-maker.<br />
The Government is the decision-maker and has to<br />
take into account the national interest, the industry interest<br />
and whether a proposal can really work or not. It has to make<br />
its decision against a far wider background than the one against<br />
which its advisers, by the nature of their specialty and their<br />
brief, have tD work. Now, I've heard the Tariff Board described as<br />
a " bunch of theorists". That isn't fair to the able men on the<br />
Board. And I think that kind of criticism stems from an over-ready<br />
assumption that a Board recommendation becomes the Government<br />
decision as a matter of course.<br />
The Tariff Poard's current review of the high areas<br />
of the tariff which should be completed in about six years is, as<br />
you know, concerned with identifying any excess protection which<br />
may exist. </p>
<p>-4<br />
In recent months, some manufacturers have sail"<br />
they would like to have advance indication of the timing of the<br />
enquiries under this review as far ahead as possible to help them<br />
in their policy making. Yesterday, as you no doubt know, the Tariff<br />
Board issued a publication which sets out its timetable for the<br />
thirty-five industry references which will take it up to 1978.<br />
The Board's programme gives proposed. sequence and duration of<br />
individual enquiries. This publication is avaiable from the Tariff<br />
Board in Canberra and I hope it will go a long way to meeting<br />
your wishes in this matter of timing.<br />
You will appreciate as the Deputy Prime minister<br />
has said yesterday, that it was desirable to have a broad<br />
timetable and that somne flexibility will be needed by the<br />
Government in the exact timing of references. I want to assure<br />
you, too, that you will have advance indication of the timing<br />
of review enquiries as far ahead as Practicable.<br />
Now I want to emphasise that the Government does<br />
not see this review as challenging either the principle of the<br />
practice of protection. The Tariff Board works in the knowledge<br />
that the Government's long-established policy is one of full<br />
adequate protection for economic and efficient Australian<br />
industries. That hasn't been changed and won't be changed.<br />
Both my colleague, t%-he Minister for Trade and.<br />
Industry, and I have repeatedly stated this in the past year or<br />
SO. But what I do want to do today is to stress<br />
those " other factors" which arc taken into, account when the<br />
economics of an industry are under study. These " other factors"<br />
have their relevance in any study of the best way to allocate<br />
and use our national resources.<br />
One is a defence consideration. An industry<br />
which has a 3otential contribution through somne sector of its<br />
operations to our defence resources is entitled to, and will<br />
get that potential recognised in any tariff decision.<br />
Another is the industry which may not be able<br />
to survive without protection above the level assessed exclusively<br />
in terms of its cost disability against imports, but which employs<br />
special classes of labour which we want to encourage, or which<br />
may be developing special skills and technology.<br />
I remind you of our recent decisicns in the<br />
case of woven and knitted shirts. We decided that to achieve an<br />
orderly transition to a lower level of protection, the existing<br />
level would be maintained for a longer period than was recommended<br />
by the Tariff Board. </p>
<p>In the meantime, the Government negotiated for<br />
voluntary restraint arrangements with low-cost countries to ensure<br />
that the manufacturers were able to keep going. However, despite<br />
these negotiations, it was not possible to reach acceptable<br />
agreements, and the Government therefore decided to establish tariff<br />
quotas on competing imports to ensure that the local industries did<br />
not " go to the wall". The point I want to emphasise over and over again<br />
is that if tariff actionisconsidered necessary by the Government to<br />
achieve rationalisation, then firms would not be expected to adjust<br />
overnight. Special care would be taken not to put job opportunities<br />
for Australians at risk.<br />
Mr President, there are other examples, but my time<br />
is short. The message I want to leave with you is that the Government<br />
regards a strong, growing and prosperous manufacturing industry<br />
as a great pillar of economic strength and wants it to grow and<br />
expand. I state further that in the Tariff review and the<br />
Government's approach to it, and in the proposed Trade Practices<br />
reforms, the Government is encouraging healthy progress in a<br />
competitive, free enterprise economy.<br />
Our recent decision on foreign investment in<br />
Australia is, I submit, further clear evidence of our desire to<br />
foster Australian industry and to make it stronger, more efficient<br />
and affluent. </p>
