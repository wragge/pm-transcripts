TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J<br />
KEATING, M. P.,<br />
GLENQUARIE SENIOR CITIZENS CENTRE, MACQUARIE FIELDS<br />
THURSDAY 27 JANUARY, 1994<br />
J: Prime Minister, do you have any thoughts on who might be the new Industry<br />
Minister?<br />
PM: No, I'll make that announccment, probably, by the weekend.<br />
J: When did you find out about the latest allegations....?<br />
PM: I haven't even caught up on that, to be honest. Mr Griffiths is no longer in the<br />
ministry and that's the key point.<br />
J: Mr Keating what is your reaction to the attack on Prince Charles last night?<br />
PM: Well, I was appalled by it. Prince Charles is a good friend of this country and<br />
deserves to be treated as a good friend In this country.<br />
J; What did you think of the efforts of Mr Fahey and Mr Kiernan?<br />
PM: Well, security is always difficult and I think what Michael Hleseltine said today<br />
was pretty right. That is, its never possible to guarantee complete security In thase<br />
circumstances but, as it turned out, the so-called attempt was really a political<br />
demonstration and I think that's how it should be viewed.<br />
J: Prime Minister, how did you interpret yesterday's speech by Prince Charles?<br />
PM: I thought it was a very clear minded speech with a sort of confident detachment<br />
where the Prince said, This is a debate, as the rcpublic,_ which Australians should<br />
decide. And he said, For my part, I think this shows the signs of a mature and<br />
confident country. In other words, For my part it's a good thing you are having<br />
this debate it's a good thing for you that you arc having this debate. I think it's<br />
r. c-J 4 </p>
<p>a very ci car stutentotit by a member of the royal family Niat the~ rcpiihlic iq, of<br />
course, a inatter ( or Australian; mtnd that he, Prince Charic1, thinks thai a debate<br />
like thir. rctflecfs our ec'nfidcncc and maturity. Arnd, com~ ing as It has, dirctly and<br />
forthrightly from him, I think It is an Important vini~ tricoi ( u owui tional<br />
political discussion.<br />
3: Ts John I howard right though when he says that the Prnce wouldn't say anything<br />
else, except that It Is up to Australians.<br />
PM: John Howa. rd ' vIi always~ put the best construction on hiq W ( uitfh e caiSe. John<br />
Howard would not be pieasceda tIhte notion that the Ilri= c thinks this debate is one<br />
of a m., ikire Aincnnfidcnt country, That Is. John Howard docsnt want this dtlmwI<br />
arnd he doesn't want us to be confident even irhu tiks wt aiw mhatuic.<br />
Pritmi Ministci, the media have said that the speech actually reflected the Prince's<br />
suppori for a republic. Do you interpret It as strongly as that?<br />
PM: WCil, he's saying, I( think t1iii; an appropriate debate for a confident and mature<br />
country to havc. He's said that direCtly, absollutely and lie said. It's a matter fur you<br />
to make your mind up abom it.<br />
J: M it's as far as heCango..<br />
PM: 1 think. 11ts a twiwhi or confident dctaehxnent removod frorn the k. muc but Sivang<br />
a wormldcat overview of the debatc. And, I think, we most appreciate that<br />
comment from him.<br />
J: How do you see that comment, though?<br />
PM: As I've just said, I think it's a helpful contribution wo Australia's nalltonal discussion<br />
ahu its idcntity and Its constitutional future.<br />
j Do you chink his trip will suppoi the monarchists? Do you think they'll get a<br />
iitsLt t0h is trip?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think so and I don't think he mecan: it to be so. think he wraarm to<br />
come hero, as ho always dercribes, himiself, as a friend of thist rnontry. % Amnconc<br />
who has nevcr been at odds with its interest; amdc who cnmcsq hcre In a relaxed,<br />
confident way. That's how twe mtn no come, that's how wc should reccivc him.<br />
J: j% th ce-ministcrial reshuffle taking longer than what you first thought considering<br />
that It's now... inaudihlc<br />
PM: kNuoy. In'viact tjeurs tt ol iraLd~ motlvhce ra tnhdi ntghsu t'tso rdeoso. lvMedt . G rAifnfdit, h s1 i hwrese alellfyt tuhpe tmo imnief, i rnyo wso, tthoa dt ewciadse a. i </p>
<p>I I<br />
J; Who will head up the independent inquiry?<br />
PM: Again, I'm thinking about that but I have taken advice from the Commonwealth<br />
police that I should se what the progress of their enquiries is before we set the<br />
terms of rcforcncc.<br />
J; My Keating. when are you likely to amnounce a ministerial inquiry?<br />
PM: As I said, Il be guided by what the Commonwealth police say about this.<br />
1: What do you think of the efforts of Mr Fahey and Mr Klernan helping tackle this<br />
alleged assailant?<br />
PM: I think it's something any person should do and they did it with alacrity and they're<br />
to be complimented for that, commended for that. And they did it, of course, In<br />
the service of a good friend of this country.<br />
Ends. </p>
