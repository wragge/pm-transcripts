PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, w17 JANUARY, 1980<br />
ADDRESS TO LUNCHEON IN HONOUR OF<br />
, HIS EXCELLENCY MR. MASAYOSHI OHIRA,<br />
PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN<br />
The welcome I extend to you today on behalf of the Australian<br />
Government and all Australians, is a very sincere and warm one.<br />
We value your presence amongst us.<br />
At the beginning of a new year and a new decade, your visit<br />
symbolises not only the strength of our past relationship,<br />
but also its growing importance in the years ahead.<br />
This relationship has developed from natural and complementary<br />
trading ties; ties which have been of remarkable benefit to<br />
both our ' countries; ties which have been guided and reinforced<br />
by government to government arrangements. These arrangements<br />
gained their earliest impetus from the 1957 Commerce Agreement.<br />
Looking back now, we are better able to understand the<br />
foresight and vision behind the Agreement.<br />
More recently, I signed a basic treaty of friendship and<br />
co-operation with Prime Minister Miki in 1976. During all this<br />
time, we have worked at and developed the necessary political<br />
and cultural dimension to our relationship. Our institutional<br />
framework, reinforced by active exchanges at all levels, has<br />
enabled us to consult closely; not only on bilateral matters<br />
but also on important internatio ' nal events such as the Tokyo<br />
Economic Summit_-in 1979. I remember warmly our own<br />
consultations in Manila before the Summit.<br />
Yesterday we agreed' to contribute more funds to the Australia,-<br />
Japan, and Western Pacific Economic Relations Research Project.'<br />
I am pleased too that your visit coincides with theannouncement<br />
by my Government of increased funds for the<br />
Australia-Japan Foundation, through which the cultural base of<br />
our relationship is being expanded. one of the aims of this<br />
expansion is to bring the level of understanding between our<br />
peoples to that which exists between our Governments.<br />
We have agreed that our efforts in this regard should be directed<br />
primarily towards our youth. It would be particularly useful if,<br />
as we discussed yesterday, arrangements can be made for working<br />
holidays for our youth, for that would contribute greatly to<br />
the shaping of future attitudes between our countries. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
All these continuous activities, in so many fields and<br />
by so many groups, have given effectiveness-and perspective<br />
to our discussions over the past two days, on a wide range<br />
of important issues.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, you have come here at a time when our<br />
bilateral relations are at a stage of vigorous expansion; and<br />
the very helpful talks we have had, can only give added<br />
impetus to this. More than this, your.. visit coincides with<br />
disturbing developments on the internat . ional scene. We are<br />
all greatly concerned about what is happening in Afghanistan<br />
and Iran. I have welcomed the opportunity to discuss these<br />
problems with you.<br />
The Soviet move into Afghanistan poses dangers to world peace<br />
greater than any in the last 35 years. It presents a challenge<br />
to the collective strength and will of the nations of the world.<br />
We must show that a line can be drawn against Soviet expansion.<br />
only a year ago, we saw Soviet support for the Vietnamese<br />
invasion of Kampuchea. Today, Soviet forces are poised on the<br />
borders of Iran and Pakistan, in a position to take advantage<br />
of any opportunity that offers, or can be manufactured, in areas<br />
of enormous strategic and economic-significance: the Iranian<br />
oilfields, the Straits of Hormuz and the Indian Ocean sea lanes.<br />
Let me state why I believe the situation we now face is more<br />
important than any that has occurred in recent decades. Previous<br />
crises in Berlin, Cuba, Korea undeniably, they involved matters<br />
of enormous significance and concern to the free world.<br />
They challenged the reputation, the strength and the very<br />
credibility of the free world. They struck at its unity and<br />
cohesiveness. Beyond that, these crises were of momentous<br />
political and ideological significance.<br />
All these factors are present in the new crisis in Afghanistan.<br />
But if, in addition, the ruthless opportunism of the Soviet Union<br />
is not checked, -the consequences assume global, strategic and<br />
economic significance of massive proportions. For, if the<br />
U. S. S. R. were to gain control of, or influence over, Middle East<br />
oil production, that would enable it to destroy the economies<br />
of the advanced world. Some may argue that this is a " worst<br />
case" prospect. But in the circumstances of today, all advice<br />
is that we cannot ignore it. It is therefore critical to world'<br />
peace and security that all countries should bring home to the<br />
Soviet Government an understanding that there are clear limits<br />
to its aggressive intentions.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, we share the understanding that this decade<br />
will pose challenges for us. Not only must we meet these<br />
challenges as they arise, but also we must anticipate them<br />
through consultation . with friends and neighbours.<br />
Central to meeting these challenges is our joint pursuit of<br />
stability through economic growth. Nothing undermines stability,<br />
security and the quality of life as much as the absence of<br />
economic growth. For only through economic growth can we provide<br />
the kind of life that maximises freedom and enhances the well-being<br />
of all of us. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
As far as Japan in concerned, even modest projections indicate<br />
that you will remain one of the most significant and growing<br />
economic powers in the world. You have won international<br />
recognition for maintaining the highest economic growth<br />
amongst industrialised countries; and this, in the face of<br />
severe international economic difficulties. Because of this,<br />
your capacity to influence beneficially the economic development<br />
of our region will continue to have very positive consequences.<br />
Yet the scarcity of energy supplies, " Severely aggravated by<br />
political events,_ places possible limitations on this<br />
development. The challenge is to find and utilise alternative<br />
and adequate supplies of energy. The fact that Australia can<br />
help to meet'this challenge, has already been recognised<br />
by many nations.<br />
The electric power companies of several industrialised<br />
countries have already begun to negotiate long-term<br />
contractual arrangements for Australian steaming coal. World<br />
aluminium manufacturers are establishing smelters in Australia,<br />
near the site of abundant blocks of commercial power.<br />
Indications are that other energy-intensive manufacturing<br />
industries are being increasingly attracted by the ready<br />
availability of Australian energy. Nations will increasingly<br />
call on us to help meet their domestic energy requirements.<br />
As well, governments and international corporations will both<br />
recognise the availability of Australian minerals, but more<br />
importantly, energy. The two are coming together in Australia.<br />
Your future requirements for energy; your geographic<br />
proximity to Australia; the dependence of the region on your<br />
economic growth; these lead us to expect a significant<br />
increase in Japanese demands for our resources.<br />
At the same time, Australia is already developing its own<br />
capacity to process many of these resources. For both of us,<br />
this makes good economic sense and energy sense. And from the.<br />
Australian point of view, there are no impediments to your<br />
involvement in this development.. Indeed, the basic treaty of<br />
friendship and co-operation was negotiated to ensure that the,<br />
same opportunities would exist for Japanese interests as are<br />
available to other countries.<br />
We, in Australia, hope you in Japan will take up more of these<br />
opportunities and not just leave them to the Britain<br />
and other European countries.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, we are fortunate to be part of a region<br />
which has unique advantages. The Western Pacific area has<br />
abundant supplies of food,. fibre, and manufacturing capacities;<br />
of energy, technology and human resources. As well, in the<br />
the proximity of the countries in this region to one another,<br />
will be of enormous advantage to us all. / 4 </p>
<p>4-<br />
For your country, as for ours, trade with this region will<br />
accelerate as industrialisation increases. This<br />
industrialisation, already occurring in the Republic of Korea,<br />
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, is rapidly taking place<br />
in other countries particularly in the ASEAN group.<br />
We are adjusting to the opportunities-provided by our region,<br />
and this process will accelerate under the stimulus of<br />
vigorous, market development. Japan and Australia will have an<br />
important co-operative partto play as regional opportunities<br />
grow. It is a new and a challenging role for both of us.<br />
In this connection, I found particularly stimulating our<br />
discussion of the Pacific Community concept, aimed at<br />
promoting greater regional co-operation. The idea is<br />
forward-looking, and, Mr. Prime Minister, we are grateful<br />
for your own and Dr. Okita's personal commitment to<br />
advancing it.<br />
I believe we share similar views about this concept, and<br />
we would like to see it taken further. But much needs to be<br />
done before we can achieve this.<br />
Yesterday we agreed that a first step would be for Australia and<br />
Japan to consult with others of our friends in the region<br />
to ascertain their views. I am pleased to be able to tell you<br />
now, that if our consultations indicate broad interest in<br />
exploring the concept further, then Australia would be happy<br />
to sponsor a seminar for this purpose. I would envisage<br />
this taking place later in the year at the Australian<br />
National University.<br />
Our relationship together has developed remarkably, but we<br />
cannot become complacent. It would be complacent to ignore the<br />
pressures that international events impose on us. But both<br />
Australia and Japan are mindful of their responsibility to<br />
contribute to international co-operation and regional<br />
development. By meeting this~ responsibility together, we<br />
can secure progress and beneficial development, together.<br />
That is why, Mr. Prime Minister, we value your visit to<br />
Australia and why we so warmly welcome your presence amongst us.<br />
