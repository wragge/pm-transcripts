    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Could I just make two announcements. The first is at the meeting a few moments ago I announced that Australia would be supporting a governance programme within the Pacific to the tune of $6 million and we are going to fund 25 specific projects.  They include judicial administration, public service practices, electoral matters, and a whole range of other activities that go to the quality of governance and I'm releasing a statement that contains the details of all of those proposals.  But it's another illustration of the importance that we place on governance and all (inaudible) make between good governance and a good future for the Pacific. It's our very strong view that key to a prosperous and stable future does lie very much in good governance and unless standards of governance are lifted and strengthened and improved then prosperity and higher living standards is going to continue to be very elusive.</p>
<p>The other matter I would like to announce is that I've informed the Forum that Australia will extend the Spartica arrangement for another seven years.  This extension will be particularly welcome by the government of Fiji, some 20,000 jobs depends on the textile, clothing and footwear industry and in large measure on their operation of that agreement.  And after examination and listening to the views put very strongly to Australia by the Prime Minister of Fiji we have decided to make that extension.</p>
<p>  They're all the announcements I have to make.  Are there any questions?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How keen are these leaders to accept the governance matters?</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think they're very keen, I think the lesson of the Solomons, the lesson from PNG arrangement, which is a bilateral one between Australia and Papa New Guinea, the lesson of other countries is that governance is very much at the heart of the future of the Pacific. We hold that view very strongly and we have once again been willing to back our rhetoric with a solid investment of another $6 million Australian dollars.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>... paid with governance, where to (inaudible) see the progress...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is a sensible progression of that, it's not being overbearing, it's simply making the point that governance must be lifted and strengthened and improved and we are prepared to contribute some money towards helping that and I believe that the countries of the Pacific will reciprocate.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible) impact on corruption in the region Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well good governance is a great enemy of corruption, let me put it that way.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what did you say specifically to the leaders on RAMSI at the Forum?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I said that it had been hugely successful and that it had been a wonderful example of Pacific co-operation. It will be something of a benchmark if similar situations arise in the future.  It had the very strong support of the people of Australia and I would say additionally that the reason why it was so successful was that it was a substantial intervention. If it had been a more threadbare intervention then those who were seeking to break down law and order in the Solomon Islands may have continued on their reckless and malicious way.  The fact that it was a very large intervention sent the very strong message that we were serious and we should all learn something from that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>... long term other financial constraints in the long term on the RAMSI...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we are very committed, but it requires reciprocity from the government and the people of the Solomon Islands. We have stabilised the situation, the law and order position has been improved, but there now needs to be a determined pursuit within the Solomons of governance improvements and the changes economically and administratively and fiscally that are needed to put the country on a sound footing.  You can do so much with police and troops but the next step involves good institutions of government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the statement this morning by former senior military men and diplomats calling for more truth in government, or more honesty in government, do you construe that as an attack on your Government?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I've seen a report of that statement and I reject the statement on its merits, I'm not going to talk about the individuals but one statement in it struck me as very peculiar and that is that in some way or other we don't have a strong enough involvement in the region. That strikes me as very strange indeed given the very significant role Australia played in the Solomon Islands intervention and the extraordinary growth of our relations with China, the reaffirmation and strengthening of our strong links with Japan and Korea, the leading role Australia played in the East Timor intervention, and even an apparent improvement at a political level of relations between Australia and Malaysia. I think that...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>... Iraq...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah well I'll come to Iraq, I think the claim that we don't have enough involvement in Asia and that our involvement in America cripples our capacity to work with Asia is a discredited old criticism. As far as Iraq is concerned, well it's just a repetition of the criticism, I've always recognised that some people opposed our decision and for the reasons I've stated ad nauseam there was no pressure put on intelligence agencies, the argument that we took to the country to war based on a lie is itself a misrepresentation and I continue to reject it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, how big do you see Australia's (inaudible) in the region in terms of (inaudible) to Nauru, we've got public servants in the Solomons, do you see that sort of thing growing in the region?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I believe it will and I think it's a responsibility Australia has and there has been a significant change in Australian policy and I make no bones about that.  We are getting more involved, that began last year, at the beginning year, when we began to take a different attitude in relation to the Solomons and I think it's a good change of policy, it's a change of policy that was very much inaugurated at the political level and I'm very pleased that we've done it and the rest of the world sees Australia as having a special role in this area and I believe that the Australian Government and the Australian people should assume it.  I believe also that we are entitled to ask in return that there be reciprocity in relation to governance and issues related to that.  But this is our patch, we have a special responsibility in this part of the world, I believe that very strongly and this is our region.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>In relation to governance, do you see the problem as corruption or is the problem simply as a lack of expertise in the (inaudible)?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look I'm not going to get into a detailed analysis of it, except to say again that governance is very important and if you have sound government, governance, then the likelihood in any society, any society that you have corruption is greatly lessened.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>... reveal the amendments to a (inaudible) Free Trade Agreement, there's been a lot of arguments over this and (inaudible) at the moment but talking about large fines for drug companies, that type of thing.  How willing are you at look at that...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I have simply said I'd like to see the amendment, and I've got nothing to add until I've seen the amendment, except to repeat what I said on Friday, and that is that getting the Free Trade Agreement approved by the Parliament is fair more important than any political advantage I may get or Mr Latham may get out of the tooing and frooing of the past few days.  But bear in mind that it's now Sunday in Australia and we still haven't seen the amendment.  I think everybody would like to see it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But this could be, if this is suitable to use, perhaps the last week that the Parliament will sit to...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It was a terrific rugby win last night.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, how much is greater involvement, Australia's greater involvement in the region linked to the threat of terrorists?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is part of it, but it's not the dominant consideration, it is not in the interests of Australia for a whole range of reasons to have failed states on our doorstep.  And in addition to that because of our historic association with many of the countries in this region and because of our sheer graphical proximity and because of our size compared with the other nations of the region, we do have responsibilities and I see that as an Australian Prime Minister and I'm sure the rest of the world sees it as well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you considered giving further financial aid to Nauru, and have they asked for it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we have fairly recently concluded quite a large package and I think it's a good idea at this stage to see that work its way through before talking about further assistance (inaudible).</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>... Forum Prime Minister, a greater acceptance and encouragement towards Australia's more activist role in the region, there's been a bit of an ambivalent attitude in the past, that seems to be disappearing in my view, what's your view?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think people are very positive about Australia's role, and they should be because we don't come with a desire to push our weight around, we come wanting to help and wanting to be a partner, but there are disproportionalities as far as size and economic clout, that's obvious, but we're not seeking to use that as some kind of leverage, some kind of lever to get an unfair outcome.  We do want to help, we have a lot of compassion towards to the people of the Pacific Islands, there's a lot of sentiment in Australia going back years for a whole lot of reasons towards people in PNG and the Solomons, in Fiji and the like.  So I think it's a very positive development and I'm very pleased that I was able to come to this meeting, not withstanding other activities, whatever that might be.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
