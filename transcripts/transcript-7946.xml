PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 9 MARCH 1990<br />
L. ABOR' S RURAL AND REGIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS<br />
Labor has implemented an effective plan to improve the<br />
primary industries and resources sector over its seven<br />
years in office:<br />
Maximising the sector's competitiveness through<br />
general economic policy decisions<br />
floating the dollar<br />
deregulating the financial sector<br />
lowering company and personal tax rates<br />
setting achievable and economically justifiable<br />
wages targets<br />
fiscal surplus and expenditure restraint<br />
lifting productivity, as the latest OECD<br />
figures show<br />
lifting employment and investment opportunities<br />
Access Economics' list of $ 49 billion in<br />
major investment projects under<br />
construction, or committed includes<br />
$ 7 billion in the mining sector<br />
including in Mount Isa and another<br />
$ 7 billion in the value adding<br />
manufacturing sector also including in<br />
Mount Isa<br />
country areas have fully shared in the<br />
strong job growth we have created.<br />
Maximising returns through both an active<br />
international trade policy and reforms to statutory<br />
marketing authorities<br />
improved access for beef to Japan, Korea and<br />
other major markets<br />

<p>successful GATT case against the US on sugar<br />
support for the Wool Corporation<br />
j flexibility for the Wheat Board<br />
creation of the Australian Horticultural<br />
Corporation development of the Cairns Group of agricultural<br />
free traders<br />
the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation<br />
initiative the Innovative Agricultural Marketing and<br />
Marketing Skills Program to enhance our export<br />
opportunities<br />
Minimising costs<br />
abolition of tariffs on most of the sector's<br />
inputs ( eg mining machinery, tractors,<br />
harvesters) and reductions of most others<br />
the estimated annual cost savings to<br />
agriculture and to mining of our 1988 tariff<br />
cuts is $ 460 million each by 1992<br />
full rebate of diesel fuel excise for primary<br />
producers a workable Income Equalisation Deposits scheme.<br />
Improving the research and development base of the<br />
sector agricultural research programs now receive more<br />
than $ 125 million in dollar-for-dollar<br />
Commonwealth grants; industry directs this<br />
research energy research, including potential<br />
alternative energy sources.<br />
Conservation measures<br />
Labor ( in 1983) recognised the national<br />
significance of land degradation and instituted<br />
direct Commonwealth assistance, via the<br />
National Soil Conservation Program<br />
the Decade of Land Care has brought together<br />
the National Farmers Federation, the Australian<br />
Conservation Foundation and the Commonwealth in<br />
a $ 320 million long term initiative for land<br />
rehabilitation, tree planting and bushland<br />
conservation ( 118 1. </p>
<p>use of export controls to ensure forests are<br />
managed sustainably<br />
the Resource Assessment Commission will serve<br />
to inform and where possible reconcile<br />
conservation and resource development interests<br />
creation of the Murray-Darling Basin<br />
Commission, the Bureau of Rural Resources, the<br />
National Resource Information Centre, the<br />
National Afforestation Program, the forest<br />
inventory administering quarantine: feral animal control;<br />
and biological control of pests and weeds from<br />
a conservation perspective, as well as<br />
completing the brucellosis and tuberculosis<br />
eradication program and upgrading exotic<br />
disease preparedness<br />
effective fisheries management.<br />
Transport reforms<br />
we implemented the recommendations of the Royal<br />
Commission into Grain Handling, with estimated<br />
cost savings to the grains industry of up to<br />
per tonne. It took a Labor initiative to<br />
overturn the anti-competitive practices of some<br />
States. Australia and its grains industry are<br />
the beneficiaries<br />
International shipping has seen the<br />
implementation of pro-competitive elements of<br />
the Trade Practices Act, in order to provide<br />
our export industries with some leverage<br />
against shipping cartels<br />
we are reforming the waterfront by replacing<br />
3000 older, less skilled workers with 1000<br />
better trained staff, tied to company<br />
employment, not a pool. Competition for<br />
labour, and pro-active efforts by the<br />
Waterfront Industry Reform Authority will see a<br />
break-down of inefficient management and work<br />
practices we are also prepared to encourage the States to<br />
both provide greater importer-exporter input<br />
into their port authorities: and to ensure<br />
that the terms and conditions their authorities<br />
offer to private stevedoring firms enhance<br />
competition<br />
13 18; </p>
<p>coastal shipping will achieve OECD-equivalent<br />
manning levels by 1992: up to one-third fewer<br />
crew members than when we took office. With<br />
the large-scale introduction of new and<br />
efficient vessels, multi-skilling and<br />
successful pioneering of new shipping trades<br />
such as BHP's triangular services, our coastal<br />
shipping is becoming increasingly competitive.<br />
Continuing Voyage Permits offer a substantial<br />
opportunity for appropriate use of foreign flag<br />
shipping, including in new resource projects<br />
( eg China Steel).<br />
Social initiatives, as outlined in the December 1989<br />
Rural and Regional Policy Statement, which referred<br />
to measures and programs to<br />
inform country people of their rights to<br />
Commonwealth programs and services<br />
review the current system of tax zone rebates,<br />
in view of apparent anomalies in boundaries<br />
take the special needs of country residents<br />
into account, both in mainstream and special<br />
programs, concerning health, education and<br />
training, transport, communications, women's<br />
affairs and Aboriginal affairs.<br />
Future Reform Prnrces<br />
To further our micro-economic reform agenda, the<br />
Structural Adjustment Committee of Cabinet will meet<br />
early in the next Hawke Government with a broad range of<br />
reports in prospect, as responses to the Garnaut Report,<br />
covering future tariff levels<br />
international aviation deregulation, including<br />
trans-Tasman trade aspects<br />
telecommunications reform, including AUSTEL<br />
reports on common user services; and cellular<br />
mobile phones; also the future role of the<br />
three telecommunications operators<br />
a second international air freight carrier and<br />
management of traffic at Sydney Airport.<br />
We are also pursuing a series of Industries Commission<br />
references on mining and mineral processing, electricity,<br />
domestic pricing of raw materials, statutory marketing<br />
arrangements, dairy, sugar and railways. These reports,<br />
as they become available over the term of our next<br />
Government, will provide the mechanism to approach a new<br />
wave of State-based micro reform issues. We have taken<br />
the tough decisions in the past and we will again. </p>
<p>.1 11 1 We will also<br />
use the report of the Drought Policy Task Force ( due<br />
shortly) as a basis for an explicit and stable<br />
policy on drought that responds compassionately to<br />
major droughts, conserves productive resources, and<br />
encourages farmers to prepare for drought and<br />
mitigate its effects<br />
use the report of the review of Commonwealth<br />
Statutory Marketing Authorities, in consultation<br />
with industry, as the basis of further reforms to<br />
enhance their<br />
achievement of marketing objectives<br />
accountability to both industry and the<br />
Parliament commercial flexibility<br />
role in encouraging further processing in<br />
Australia.<br />
And finally, there is the impact over our next term of<br />
the initiatives which I have announced in recent days<br />
the Provincial Cities and Rural Highways roads<br />
program is for country areas only: $ 100 million per<br />
year for the most important new roads projects<br />
the availability of early breast cancer detection<br />
services in regional areas, designed to save several<br />
hundred lives over the next three years<br />
rural and energy research must benefit from the<br />
national research centres initiative, given that<br />
some of Australia's most important research<br />
priorities lie in that area<br />
assistance for disadvantaged schools<br />
and child care, particularly the commitments to<br />
relief from fees at commercial centres, given that<br />
these are more likely to develop as a result of the<br />
special needs of country towns.<br />
