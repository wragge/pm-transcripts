PRIME MINISTER]<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, OLD MINT, SYDNEY, 13 JANUIARY<br />
1989 Å 0 3-PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you think about the resignation of<br />
Justice Muirhead7<br />
PM: Well I've known about this now for come time that it<br />
was impending. I've had discussions with him and it's a<br />
decision which I understand completely. He has made a great<br />
contribution and he has the opportunity of taking up the<br />
appointment as Administrator of the Northern Territory, a<br />
position for which he is eminently well equipped. I think<br />
the work that he has done in the Commission sets a very firm<br />
foundation for the future work of that commission. The<br />
interim report is a very useful one. He will continue to<br />
work until April. we will receive further reports from him<br />
before the end of this month as his statement has indicated<br />
and at the appropriate time in consultation with the State<br />
Governments will nominate the successor to Justice muirhead.<br />

record my appreciation for the great work that he has done,<br />
for the foundation that he has laid and to wish him well for<br />
the future.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you try and get him to stay Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: I was able to get Justice Muirhead to stay for perhaps<br />
longer than the personal pressures upon him before would<br />
have led him to do, so he stayed, as I say, perhaps longer<br />
than he perhaps thought was possible as a result of the<br />
discussions I had with him. I am confident that, as a<br />
result of the work he has done-and the team that he's got<br />
working with him, that we will be able to nominate an<br />
appropriate successor. me is confident, as I am confident,<br />
that the work will be carried through to a successful<br />
conclusion. JOURNALIST: Sir, why was the decision made to appoint him<br />
to the Northern Territory today? why did the Government<br />
make that decision today?<br />
PM: I didn't make that decision today is the answer to that<br />
question. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
JOURNALIST; Prime miinister, there was talk that there was<br />
some sort of political pressure on Justice Muirhead to<br />
leave, what do you think of those<br />
PH: Wello it's nlonsenseO.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there any implication with the Western<br />
Australian election coming on that the Northern Territory<br />
appointment was made?<br />
PM: None whatsoever. You would need to have even the most<br />
fervid imagination in the silly non-political season to work<br />
that one out. I'd just like to know what the machinations<br />
in your mind are to think that one up. There is absolutely<br />
no foundation for it at all.<br />
JOURNALIST: Who is the likely successor?<br />
PM: That's a matter that we will decide in consultation<br />
with the States.<br />
JOURNALIST: will his departure disrupt the Commission at<br />
all? M No. I thought I'd made it quite clear in the answers<br />
I'd given a moment ago that the work that has been done by<br />
mr Justice Muirheado in consultation and in association with<br />
his colleagues, will mean that the work will go on. I've<br />
already made that quite clear.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, how confident are you that the<br />
$ 250,000 reward can do something in the Winchester case?<br />
PM: we obviously hope it will do something, otherwise we<br />
wouldn't have put it there. But you can't be certain in<br />
these matters. What we have decided to do of course is to<br />
give as much incentive by that step and to ensure that all<br />
the resources are going to be available to maximise the<br />
chances of apprehending the perpetrator of this monstrous<br />
crime. We hope that that will play a part in bringing to<br />
justice whoever is responsible for it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, on the Muirhead matter, do you have any<br />
preference for a likely successor?<br />
PM: Well, it I have I'm not going to announce it publicly<br />
here. I will take that into account in my discussions with<br />
my colleagues and with the States.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, a report too that Mr Fraser, Malcolm<br />
r~. uve wouad Ue alLato to cell * he ahnriainAl rnnnt to<br />
white Australia, do you have any reaction to that? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PM: Again, like a previous question put, rather<br />
inaccurately put, if we can get down to the substance of it,<br />
in discussions that I have had last year with a number of<br />
people including representatives of the Aboriginal people<br />
and with Mr Hand, I had mentioned Mr Fraser's name as one of<br />
a number of people in the community who I thought would be<br />
appropriate in promoting discussion of and also in<br />
soliciting support within the community for the concept of a<br />
treaty. I think that the reputation of Mr Fraser in this<br />
area is impeccable, but his was one of a number of names<br />
that's in my mind.<br />
ends I </p>
