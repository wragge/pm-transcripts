PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW POST-BUDGET DINNER<br />
SYDNEY 24 AUGUST 1988<br />
As my friend and colleague, Paul Keating, and I have always<br />
agreed, economic management has always been the main game in<br />
town. May I say this has been and remains true, as a solid basis<br />
of our prosperity, as a sound basis for higher levels of<br />
targetted sustainable social justice and let me add, as<br />
Prime Minister as a sure basis for political success.<br />
The political scene in Australia in the last few weeks has<br />
been dominated by the morally unacceptable and economically<br />
dangerous opportunism of our political opponents.<br />
My Government will continue to fight and we will beat<br />
that make-or-break threat to Australia's well-being.<br />
And with last night's Budget we passed the make-or-break<br />
point for the Australian economy.<br />
Under Labor's policies the economy is going to make it<br />
Australia is going to make it.<br />
Last night the Treasurer brought down the second instalment<br />
of the Government's economic measures of 1988 the first<br />
having been the May Statement.<br />
Taken together these statements demonstrated once again the<br />
Government's complete mastery on the central issues facing<br />
the Australian nation the issues of economic policy<br />
making. They provide the policy framework needed to maintain the<br />
momentum of economic reconstruction which is underway in<br />
Australia. They promote a sustained high level of investment.<br />
They ensure demand does not unduly hamper the pace of<br />
improvement in our current account position.<br />
They maintain the downward trend of inflation.<br />
I 3 11A </p>
<p>They promote increased productivity, flexibility and<br />
adaptability. They preserve true social cohesion by t he dedicated pursuit<br />
of social justice.<br />
With those policies, Australia will make it.<br />
There is a number of interconnected strands to that policy<br />
approach : fiscal restraint, initiatives to reduce<br />
inflation; initiatives to accelerate economic reconstruction<br />
and major advances in social justice.<br />
Last night's Budget, the culmination of years of work,<br />
achieved a real decline in budgetted outlays of 1.8 per cent<br />
an unprecedented third year of decline, bringing the share<br />
of outlays in GDP back to its lowest since 1973-74.<br />
As a result the Budget surplus has now been lifted to<br />
billion. Equivalent to 1.7% of GOP, that represents a<br />
turnaround of about 7% of GDP from the anticipated deficit<br />
of $ 9.6 billion which we inherited in 1983.<br />
Note that none of this Budget's surplus growth is due to<br />
increased asset sales.<br />
Moreover, contrary to those who assert it is all done with<br />
tax mirrors, budget revenue now forms a lower share of GDP<br />
this year than last for the second year in a row.<br />
In other words this year's achievements principally reflect<br />
the hard graft of earlier years namely real outlays cuts.<br />
Combined with the restraint exerted by the Commonwealth on<br />
other levels of Government, our surplus will reduce the net<br />
call of the public sector as a whole on the domestic savings<br />
to zero.<br />
I say it again: the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement<br />
will be zero.<br />
This year, for the first time ever, the saving of<br />
Australians is available entirely to finance productive<br />
investment in Australia.<br />
Indeed the Commonwealth is now able to repay public debt.<br />
The Budget's reforms to our economic infrastructure have<br />
been delivered in several stages.<br />
The breadth and significance of the package introduced in<br />
May should not be underestimated.<br />
No longer will investment decisions be determined by<br />
artificial props from the tax or tariff systems. They will<br />
increasingly relate to underlying economic returns the<br />
returns which equate to the growth of national wealth.<br />
Coupled with progressive reform of Government Business 1375 </p>
<p>U<br />
Enterprises such as Telecom and Australia Post to make them<br />
more responsive to change, the measures will also help to<br />
contain business and consumer costs.<br />
The effect of such measures will naturally build up slowlytheir<br />
benefit will be felt increasingly in years to come.<br />
There have been further initiatives since the May Statement,<br />
with a particular emphasis on education and training.<br />
The reason we have been paying such intense attention to the<br />
education and training systems is because if we get them<br />
right we get right the basic building blocks of our future<br />
economy, its workforce to say nothing of personal<br />
fulfillment. This Budget provides for a massive expansion in higher<br />
education places some 40,000 places by 1991. Funding<br />
those places will be a major task for any Government.<br />
The Higher Education Contribution Scheme will assist in that<br />
task as well as help disadvantaged students put themselves<br />
through higher education using Austudy.<br />
Under the scheme those for whom higher education is a means<br />
to higher income the students will repay a small portion<br />
of the costs of their education but only if and when they<br />
have the financial capacity to do so.<br />
The scheme is fair. It is sensible. It deserves the<br />
support of the whole community.<br />
It complements steps already taken to lift the quality,<br />
relevance and efficiency of our schools, TAFEs and higher<br />
education institutions.<br />
However the process of economic reform must not rest there.<br />
Although there are many enlightened employers, Australia's<br />
attitude to training and retraining has too often been<br />
short-sighted. Too often training has been regarded as a<br />
cost to be avoided in economic downturn, leading to<br />
shortages when activity has recovered.<br />
The Minister for Employment, Education and Training, John<br />
Dawkins, will be consulting with representatives of business<br />
on options to remedy this deficiency and I take this<br />
opportunity to encourage your active involvement in<br />
addressing it.<br />
An improved training effort will have to accompany any<br />
serious attempt to improve the adaptability of our workforce<br />
through better design of jobs, nulti-skilling and the like.<br />
With the review of awards initiated by the Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Commission in its recent National Wage Case </p>
<p>4.<br />
Decision, and the Government's review of funding of<br />
training, those matters have been placed firmly on the<br />
industrial agenda.<br />
A number of other reports and reviews which affect business<br />
costs and thus our capacity to adapt to change are still to<br />
come before the Government. These include the results of<br />
IAC and other inquiries into our shipping industry and<br />
waterfront, into Government charges and into tourism and the<br />
services sector.<br />
It may be necessary after those reviews, for some of us to<br />
shoulder a greater share of the burden of change.<br />
All of us unions, business people, the community at large<br />
-simply cannot afford to fail to address these reviews<br />
co-operatively and positively.<br />
Our children will rightly indict this generation of<br />
employers, unions and governments if we do not, together,<br />
make the most of the opportunities now before us.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Inflationary expectations are easy to entrench, difficult to<br />
break. This Budget introduces a circuit breaker.<br />
This is possible because the overall Budget outcome is<br />
consistent with the restraint am demand which is necessary.<br />
The reform of excise tax arrangements on beer, costing<br />
$ 400m, are socially responsible and, given the expected<br />
budget surplus, fiscally sound.<br />
This follows several price-cutting initiatives taken in may.<br />
The 2 per cent revenue duty has been abolished,. returning<br />
$ 250m to reduce private sector costs.<br />
A further $ 240m is being returned because of reduced tariffs<br />
on cars and other imports.<br />
Each of these measures is a rational reform to promote<br />
greater economic efficiency.<br />
And together they have the major additional benefit of<br />
knocking down the CPI this year by over 1/ 2 per cent..-a<br />
shock which will secure an inflation rate of about 4 1/ 2 per<br />
cent by this time next year, and even less in the following<br />
year. We aim to convert that achievement in 1989-90 into a<br />
wage-tax trade off which will achieve the slower wage growth<br />
needed to keep inflation low without the need to sacrifice<br />
the real living standards of ordinary workers. 1377 </p>
<p>Personal tax cuts will be introduced from 1 July 198g.<br />
They will be structured to pay particular regard to the<br />
needs of lower and middle income earners the people who<br />
have borne the real brunt of economic reconstruction so far.<br />
But the scale of those cuts necessarily must depend on<br />
achieving appropriate wages growth in 1988-89 and on a<br />
suitably restrained prospect for 1989-90.<br />
After five years of sustained wage restraint there is<br />
understandable impatience on the part of many workers for<br />
further increases in disposable incomes as quickly as<br />
possible.<br />
Those legitimate aspirations can and will be net.<br />
But we must go carefully and sensibly.<br />
The reason, of course, is that we simply cannot afford to<br />
risk all that we have achieved so far by either excessive<br />
wage-price pressures or by a renewed burst of<br />
import-generating demand prompted by ill-timed tax cuts.<br />
This year we need an orderly progress of wage rises,<br />
consistent with the Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Commission's recent Decision.<br />
Next year we will give as large a tax cut as cam be<br />
afforded, in the context of arrangements to ensure<br />
appropriate wages outcomes.<br />
Having laboured so hard to get Australia back on its feet it<br />
would be reprehensible to put jobs and living standards<br />
unnecessarily at risk by a less disciplined approach.<br />
La dies and gentlemen<br />
Too often social justice concerns are greeted with a yawn by<br />
a lot of economic commentators.<br />
That is economically and socially short sighted.<br />
. The Leader of the Opposition is fond these days of posing<br />
under the banner of social cohesion. Unfortunately, as his<br />
incursions into the immigration debate have shown, his<br />
posing is more likely to encourage disharmony than cohesion.<br />
Labor's social justice achievements are designed to promote<br />
real national cohesion in a way that only Labor can.<br />
Our approach these past 5 1/ 2 years has been based on the<br />
reality that commitment to economic change is likely to be<br />
greater, more enduring and more readily achieved if all the<br />
members of our community perceive it to be fair.<br />
1378 U </p>
<p>It recognises also the essential dignity of all Australians<br />
and the right of the disadvantaged to a decent quality-of<br />
life. our impressive record so far in promoting greater fairness<br />
in tax, in education, in health services, in income support,<br />
indeed in access to the full range of Government programs<br />
was spelt out in a publication which I launched in April<br />
called " Towards a Fairer Australia Social Justice Under<br />
Labor". That document also set out the Government's priorities for<br />
further improvements.<br />
I am proud to say that, in this Budget, we have made<br />
substantial progress on each of those priorities.<br />
This Budget will sustain durable employment growth. We will<br />
add significantly to the 1 million jobs we have already<br />
created, and at least preserve the reductions we have<br />
already achieved in the unemployment rAte.<br />
The Budget also includes further steps to meet our child<br />
poverty pledge that by 1990 no Australian child need live<br />
in poverty. That pledge will be honoured in full next<br />
Budget. Last night, we increased the Family Allowance<br />
Supplement and foreshadowed new arrangements to obtain<br />
maintenance from non-custodial parents.<br />
The Budget includes new programs to assist sole parents and<br />
the long term unemployed to break out of poverty by<br />
obtaining meaningful employment.<br />
It includes phased increases in rent assistance for low<br />
income households renting in the private market, recognising<br />
that housing costs are a major contributor to poverty.<br />
It incorporates substantial increases in funding for<br />
Medicare, nursing homes, hospitals and the Home and<br />
Community Care program.<br />
It includes substantial real increases in funding of<br />
programs designed to improve the living conditions and self<br />
esteem of our Aboriginal peoples, including by a major<br />
expansion of self-help programs. Funding has been increased<br />
by about 20 per cent in real terms in this Budget, so that<br />
we have more than doubled real funding in this area over the<br />
life of this Government.<br />
These social justice initiatives show the Budget has a<br />
particular focus on the needs of women and this is<br />
furthered by additional expenditures to promote better<br />
health and an unprecedented expansion of child care places.<br />
That expansion will take Commonwealth child care provision<br />
in significant new directions. 1379. </p>
<p>It will mean that within 4 years Labor will have trebled the<br />
number of child care places that we inherited.<br />
In co-operation with the States, 20,000 of the 30,000 places<br />
to be provided over the next four years will be concentrated<br />
in the all too neglected area of out-of-school-hours care.<br />
There is a further new element in the program of particular<br />
relevance to a business audience.<br />
The Commonwealth is seeking to forge a partnership with<br />
business and is offering a new deal in the provision of<br />
child care facilities for employees.<br />
Employers willing to provide work-based capital facilities<br />
and to contribute to running costs are able to take<br />
advantage of tax concessions, including in certain<br />
circumstances against liability for fringe benefits tax.<br />
Users will now become eligible for fee relief up to a<br />
ceiling of $ 70 per week, with the greatest Commonwealth<br />
subsidy directed to those most in need.<br />
Of course there is no suggestion of compulsion. Employers<br />
are free to take or leave this offer.<br />
Details have been released by the Minister for Community<br />
Services and Health, Neal Blewett.<br />
I urge all employers to look constructively at these<br />
proposals. Ladies and gentlemen<br />
I must at this point call upon the indulgence of my hosts to<br />
pick a bone with them.<br />
Today's Budget editorial in the Australian Financial Review<br />
is seriously wide of. the mark.<br />
We are not relying on faith and hope. We have policies and<br />
results. And social justice is not about charity.<br />
After five years of effort, the Australian economy has the<br />
most favourable base on which to build that it has enjoyed<br />
for some years a base built up painstakingly but<br />
determinedly by the Australian community since 1983.<br />
We do not need faith to forecast, as we do, that at present<br />
commodity prices, we expect a current account deficit of<br />
$ 9 1/ 2 billion in 1989-90. That represents 3 per cent of<br />
forecast GDP less than half the peak of 1985-86.<br />
We do not need faith to demonstrate that inflation is<br />
trending firmly downwards.<br />
We have the evidence, not faith, that business confidence is<br />
high. </p>
<p>We have the evidence, confirmed by no less a commentator<br />
than Brian Noakes of the CAI, that business investment will<br />
grow rapidly this year.<br />
Indeed on current indications, by the end of 1988-89<br />
business investment will have increased by almost 25 per<br />
cent in real terms in just two years, with a heavy emphasis<br />
on the traded goods sector.<br />
Ultimately it is that kind of investment response,<br />
concentrated on the traded goods sector, which is needed to<br />
secure our future.<br />
Our success to date in winding back the current account<br />
deficit, our renewed international competitiveness, and our<br />
determined fiscal record are eroding the risk premium which<br />
once was attached to investment in Australia.<br />
That erosion can only accelerate.<br />
But we do not have a Panglossian view of the future.<br />
We recognise that if we are to remain competitive,<br />
Australian industry will need constantly to reassert its<br />
flexibility and adaptability.<br />
For too long we have relied on rules of thumb from the past.<br />
The only rule of thumb for the future is that if we want to<br />
make a quid we will have to earn it the hard way by<br />
meeting the demands of the world market place.<br />
For example, our history shows that our real exchange rate<br />
fluctuates with real commodity prices. We don't have the<br />
power to abolish the world's commodity price cycle. But we<br />
do have the power to develop within our manufacturing and<br />
services sectors the flexibility and resilience that other<br />
countries have to maximise competitiveness by lifting<br />
productivity. And as a consequence, we do have the power to moderate our<br />
dependence on primary commodity exports. Already,<br />
manufactures as a share of total exports have risen by 3<br />
percentage points to 26 per cent in 1987-88.<br />
That's what we've been working to achieve consistently for<br />
five years.<br />
That is the purpose of our pathbreaking approach to policy<br />
making in this country.<br />
Each of our Budgets and May Statements has gone to the very<br />
heart of what it is that we in the Labor Government want for<br />
Australia a fair and prosperous country, confident in its<br />
future. It is now well accepted that in the early eighties these<br />
aspirations had been thwarted: 1381 </p>
<p>Australia's social cohesion was under threat;<br />
The tax and social welfare systems were seen to be<br />
unfair; The dice was loaded in favour of the relatively<br />
privileged; The legitimate needs of the genuinely disadvantaged were<br />
being ignored;<br />
much of Australian manufacturing was insular and<br />
inefficient in world terms.<br />
Our wage bargaining systems concentrated on the short<br />
term balance of industrial power, which tended to shift<br />
with the commodities cycle, and less with the needs of<br />
the longer term;<br />
And our industrial relations system had degenerated into<br />
an arena of futile Government confrontation and<br />
counterproductive punitive legislation.<br />
What we have done since 1983 is to break the mould which<br />
concentrated Australian minds on confrontation, on the short<br />
term, and on the domestic market. We are lifting our<br />
national sights beyond our shores and beyond the short term<br />
and beyond the purely sectional gain.<br />
Since the fiasco of the Liberals' tax policy in last year's<br />
election campaign, the Federal Opposition parties have been<br />
notable only in their failure to advance a comprehensive and<br />
relevant economic strategy.<br />
Their recognition of their failure in the central economic<br />
arena explains their recent foray into social issues, such<br />
as their breach of bipartisanship on immigration policy and<br />
by their rejection of the policy of multiculturalism.<br />
But within this Budget,.,. political debate in Australia<br />
returns to the mainstream of policy issues: the issues of<br />
fairness and prosperity determined by economic policy<br />
making. Labor intends to continue in this vein until we have<br />
stabilised our debt, solved our balance of payments<br />
difficulties and set Australia on the path to steady<br />
improvements in living standards.<br />
Australia needs, deserves, and from us will get, no less. </p>
