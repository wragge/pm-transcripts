PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD SATTLER, RADIO 6PR 29<br />
JUNE 1992<br />
E AND OE PROOF ONLY<br />
SATTLER: PX1 Can we start at the top, in the toilet?<br />
where?<br />
SATTLERs In the toilet. I have learned today that the<br />
federal government has put a 20% sales tax on rclepaper<br />
products. Now it says to me that the earth sumi was a waste<br />
of time, why have you done that?<br />
I don't know, I would have to just check about<br />
that. SATTLER: PM: SATTLER: Can you got it off?<br />
We encourage recycling of paper and<br />
That's not much of an encouragement is it.<br />
PM: IIt's happening though. We have got now quite a<br />
lot of investment going into recycling of newspaper and<br />
newsprint and I think, I am not sure about it in Perth but<br />
certainly in the eastern states most of the newspapers are now<br />
being picked up and recycled which is a good thing.<br />
BATTLERs Will you have a look at that? That seems to<br />
run contrary to what the earth summit was all about.<br />
PM; sky that one. I will see. That is one f rom out of the blue<br />
SATTLER: Right out of lef t f ield. Lot's talk about a<br />
couple of other issues. I want to get the republican one out<br />
of the way first because people may why do you preoccupy<br />
yourselft talking to people like Paul Keating about the<br />
republic. I say because Paul Keating keeps bringing it up all<br />
the time. You talked I think on Friday night it was at a<br />
literary dinner about the oath of allegiance and you sort </p>
<p>SAT ' LZRs ( cont'd) of alluded to the f act that we should not<br />
be swearing allegiance to the Que we should be swearing<br />
allegiance primarily to our own country. But if I am not<br />
wrong you swore allegiance to the Queen when you became Prime<br />
Minister, didn't you?<br />
PX: Yea, but I served an a minister<br />
SATTLERt A touch hypocritical.<br />
PM: No not at all, Australians don't serve her as a<br />
minister. I am appointed by her representative, the Governor<br />
General. SATTLER: How does that sit with you?<br />
PM: There are lots of other people who would like<br />
to be appointed Prime Minister, so it sits reasonably well<br />
with me.<br />
SATTLERs Wouldn't you just rather be appointed by us.<br />
PM: I think that's the point, that in that the<br />
average person who takes citizenship swears an oth, should<br />
swear it to Australia. They are not dragooned into<br />
ministerial service and don't need to swear it to the head of<br />
state.<br />
BATTLERi So you mean if you had your way you would<br />
eliminate swearing alleoiance to the Queen and just leave it<br />
swearing allegiance to Australia?<br />
PM: That's as I think it should bev desirably for<br />
Australians taking citizenship. That is that we have a s~ t of<br />
values which Australia represents o2and we have that<br />
encapsulated in a statement and people swear allegiance to<br />
Australia and those values.<br />
SATTLERt When are you going to do something about it, a<br />
lot of talk, a lot of rhetoric, when are you going to do<br />
something about it?<br />
PM: Again these things take a bit of thinking about<br />
and I think it helps to have in the public debate an<br />
understanding of the issues. You said Howard that you keep<br />
coming back to these things and I think that's good. I think<br />
people do got<br />
SATTLERt But people think you are beating around the<br />
bush, you are not quite game to go the full step and take the<br />
Queen out everywhere.<br />
PM: I am not being about taking the Queen out as<br />
you put it.<br />
SATTLERtSATToLfE Ro: uOru to ath, right. </p>
<p>PK: Out of the oath but no, I think again these are<br />
matters which are of community interest and they take people<br />
awhile to understand.<br />
BATTLERs You are going to wait until the polls show that<br />
view as the majority, aren't you?<br />
PM: No not nocessaril y~ but I think the debate<br />
matters and it valuable. A Ptralians ought to be clear<br />
about themselves and about some of these issues.<br />
BATTLER: What about this amazing statement that if the<br />
Liberals got into power we could have Los Angeles style riots.<br />
I mean that is surely stretching the bounds of creduld)#<br />
beyond belief.<br />
PM: No I don't think so, i don't think so at all.<br />
You see we had the f ederal director of the Liberal Party on<br />
yesterday confirming yet again that under a Liberal government<br />
people on unemployment benefits will be on the streets after 9<br />
months, no support from the government.<br />
BATTLER: How did he confirm that?<br />
PM: He was on TV yesterday, on the Sunday program.<br />
SATTLERs Me actually said those words?<br />
PM: And he confirmed that after 9 months, well it's<br />
in theEi~ ghtbck document, it's in Dr Howson's document and Dr<br />
Hewson has said it over and over again<br />
SATTLER: that they will put people on the streets<br />
after 9 months.<br />
PM: After 9 months unemployment benefits finishes<br />
and then they go to the voluntary agencies. Now the voluntary<br />
agencies are St Vincent de Paul, the Smith Family and what<br />
have you so you can imagine a person with a wife and say a<br />
couple of kids who is unemployed, no fault of their own, after<br />
9 months they rely on their family, their extended family for<br />
support or they go down looking f or food and in some case<br />
shelter from the voluntary agencies. In other words we<br />
dismantle the social security system we have which picks up<br />
responsibility and pay. unemployment benefits to people<br />
unemployed. if that went on for 5 or 6 years f or instance<br />
under a government, the sort of civil unrest that would<br />
produce would be profound.<br />
SATTLER: But isn't that inciting people?<br />
PM. No it's telling them, Just may read the<br />
document and you will find in there that in what must be one<br />
of the most spiteful policies ever to say to people. See this<br />
is the Liberal Party's view, stigmatise them, say they are </p>
<p>PM: ( cont'd) bludgers, they don't want to work. What the<br />
federal director of the Liberal Party said yesterday was a lot<br />
of theme people are out there, some of them are actually<br />
enjoying it on the public purse not making the effort to find<br />
a job and the taxpayers shouldn't have to fund them, it's<br />
unfair to taxpayers he said.<br />
BATTLER: So is there no strong safety net for the<br />
genuinely disadvantaged as Mr Robb would have us say?<br />
PM: I None, none. There is effectively none, no, so<br />
what happens to them is they go out there and you Just imagine<br />
if you are 45 years of age and you have got a wife and a<br />
couple of kids or you are 40 years of age and you are<br />
unemployed and you have boon unemployed 9 months, that's it.<br />
No money, no money into the household, down you go, down to<br />
the Salvation Army or St Vincent de Paul or the Smith Family,<br />
that's the Liberal Party's policies and if that sort of thing<br />
over a period of time wouldn't produce a different sort of<br />
Australia than we have today, one where there is a lot of<br />
unrest and the same unrest which produced those problems in<br />
the USA.<br />
BATTLERs Why are we having a youth unemployment summit,-<br />
when you reckon the level is only i' 10.6% right<br />
across the board, that would indicate to me and there is an<br />
article in the Financial Review today that Indicates that the<br />
group in the worst trouble are sort of middle aged or adult<br />
blue collar workers. Why don't you have a summit for them, or<br />
are there no votes in them?<br />
PM: What we are doing with the older if you like<br />
unemployed is to try and get the economy growing as quickly as<br />
possible. But the problem about the 15 to 19 year olds is<br />
that the jobs have shrunk, the economy has changed and a lot<br />
of the jobs which were done by young people in the past which<br />
were clerical jobs, or jobs in retailing are now being done by<br />
computers and basically the jobs have disappeared and we, when<br />
I say we, this government has changed the whole retention<br />
rates in schools and the training that follows it but there is<br />
still about 122,000 people out of the 1.3 million.<br />
SATTLER: But haven't you just put them into all these<br />
training schemes to mask the real level of youth unemployment,<br />
they are training for jobs that don't exist, surely.<br />
PM: No that is not true no, no. When we became<br />
the government three children in ten finished secondary school<br />
and when our Liberal friends left the place they were quite<br />
happy for seven children in ten to finish their education<br />
before they completed secondary school.<br />
SATTLER: SATTLEaRr: eW htahte se people training for? </p>
<p>PM: Let me just make this point to you now. Now<br />
nearly eight in ten complete secondary school, 35-40% of those<br />
get university place. and what I am working on now is for the<br />
rest of them to find support in technical and further<br />
education. in other words we are now keeping kids you know<br />
eight out of ten children through secondary school into<br />
universities and to TAPE so that the training they get<br />
qualifies them for the sort of job which the economy has to<br />
offer. it doesn't offer any more the unskilled so called dead<br />
end job and that is what we are basically trying to f ocus on<br />
for the untrained people trying to basically come to terms<br />
with what wage or training wage can be paid to them so that we<br />
get a break through on this and that would encourage employers<br />
to take young people up without skills.<br />
SATTLERo In the Sydney Morning Herald there is a story<br />
this morning that says " stop going it alone', and this is a<br />
message to you from Senator John Faulkner who is on the<br />
national campaign commuittee, he is on the national executive<br />
no well and he is a Left Wing member I think of the NSW Labor<br />
Party. His message to you is stop going it alone and start<br />
consulting a few people, and he cites the summit, the youth<br />
summit if you like and apparent lack of communication between<br />
you and Kim Beazley.<br />
PM: That's not true o there is no lack of<br />
communication between Kim and me.<br />
SATTLERs Kim would never know when you are going to<br />
announce it.<br />
PM: Well he shouldn't have been asked, I should<br />
have been asked.<br />
SATTLERs But he is the employment minister.<br />
PM1 He has the policy but not the arrangements for<br />
the meeting. The meeting is to be conducted by me and we made<br />
the arrangements on it.<br />
SATTLER; He didn't want young people, you did.<br />
PM: and I did and I met a group of young people<br />
last night in Adelaide, young unemployed people and I am<br />
meeting a group today in Perth just to try and get an<br />
understanding of their problems and get the issues ready for<br />
this meeting when we have it. But in terms of consultation I<br />
ma n this government has turned consultation into an art form,<br />
Wekeep consulting.<br />
SATTLERs What is your message to Senator Faulkner?<br />
PM1 If you look at the One Nation statement I set<br />
up a round of consultations for that which went for about<br />
weeks in every capital city, including Perth and that has been </p>
<p>PM: ( cont'd) the same f or all of our policy changes and I<br />
think within the party I try and do the same as veil.<br />
SATTLERt Is it because Senator Faulkner is a Left Winger<br />
and7h is just trying to fire a few sort of guarded shots at<br />
you. You don't always get on with the Left Wing, do you?<br />
PM: These days they have become quite supportive of<br />
me. SATTLER: When did this start?<br />
PM: Years back, they realised a lot of the things<br />
we did in the 70s, social policy and that was very good<br />
policy. SATTLER: I don't know whether you have been keeping a<br />
handle on this major strike we have got in our north west at<br />
the moment. Around about $ 50 million has been lost already<br />
all because the unions up there reckon we should have<br />
compulsory unionism. One man has used his legal right and he<br />
decided he doesn't want to be a member of the union and that<br />
has caused an almighty strike which is now in its third week.<br />
Do you believe in compulsory unionism?<br />
PM1 I believe in the arbitration system and I think<br />
that the parties should accept the decision of the WA<br />
industrial commission<br />
SATTLER: That was go back to work.<br />
PM: Return to work that's what should happen.<br />
SATTLER: What about this man's decision he doesn't want<br />
to be a member of the union. Should he be allowed to<br />
PM: I don't know the issues well Howard but I know<br />
that there was a return to work ordered by the commission and<br />
that's what I think should happen.<br />
SATTLER: They are probably Labor Party supporters up<br />
there and they are listening right now no your message is got<br />
back to work.<br />
PM: Absolutely.<br />
SATTLER: And sort it out somewhere else. You threw<br />
another $ 250 million at the Aboriginal problems the other day<br />
and a large slab was targetted at jobs, that's fine, but how<br />
do you reckon other Australians, unemployed Australians are<br />
going to feel about all that money going to one@ group for<br />
jobs? </p>
<p>PM: I don't think that anybody should feel any envy<br />
towards Aboriginal Australianu, they were in the first place<br />
dispossessed and-th-en as time has gone on they have not had<br />
the opportunities which most other Australians have, and we<br />
have tried to remedy that by their response to theAboginal<br />
Qqt-inQtqy---RQyAl.-Coiuuission, by improving the law and<br />
justice access for them and at the same time trying to improve<br />
the underlying basis of Aboriginal social problems and that<br />
gets down to you know things like education, housing, work<br />
etc. BSATTLER: Prime Minister how do you know it's going work.<br />
You know Malcolm Fraser used to throw money at the problem and<br />
it never seemed to work.<br />
PM: I think it's a matter of trying to get a better<br />
handle on the administration, the policy, design thorn better.<br />
We have tried our best in this statement to do that and I<br />
think, I hope with some success. But we are trying to provide<br />
a more of a sort of a commercial focus to some of the things<br />
which Aboriginals are involved in.<br />
SATTLER: Will someone from the government who has<br />
control of our money be watching over the shoulders of the<br />
people who actually are allocating the money in variou, areas?<br />
It's our money.<br />
PM: Commonwealth funding is administered by ATBIC<br />
which is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission<br />
which is made up of representatives of the community all over<br />
Australia and it dispenses and manages the funding which is<br />
provided by the Commonwealth under the tutelage of the<br />
Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.<br />
SATTLERi So you just give them money and they do with it<br />
as they please?<br />
PM: What they have done I think is develop a very<br />
good system of administration and recently ATSIC was put under<br />
some scrutiny in the Senate and passed with I think f lying<br />
colours. BATTLER: Your predecessor Bob Hawke has been on radio in<br />
our sister station 2UE today in Sydney saying that Nick<br />
Greiner has been hard done by, he is not a corrupt bloke, he<br />
made a stupid decision maybe. He says that if the sort of<br />
rules which have been applied to Nick Greiner forced him out<br />
of office, we won't get good peo-ple -goingi-nto politics. Do<br />
you agree with that him?<br />
Px: Nick Greiner set up these rules for the<br />
Independent Commission Against Corruption. He set the<br />
criteria and the criteria in the end tripped him up. The<br />
Liberal Party in NSW used the corruption issue for all it was<br />
worth, alleging at the time that the Wran government was </p>
<p>PM: ( cont'd) corrupt and of course the ICAC never found one<br />
thing against the Wran government and all it's done ever since<br />
is find things against the Greiner government.<br />
SATTLERs Ioist on its own petard?<br />
PM: Absolutely.<br />
SATTLER: Do you fael sorry for Nick Greiner? You rang<br />
him didn't you?<br />
PM: I rang him, yes.<br />
SATTLERt What did you say?<br />
PM: I just said, just to wish him well and to say<br />
that SATTLER: hang on this is a Liberal man, you are<br />
ringing him up<br />
PM8 Well he is going back into sort ofas a private<br />
member, I had worked with him as Premier/ We got quite a lot<br />
of things done together over the years and I try and work<br />
with, as Treasurer or as Prime Minister, with the Premiers and<br />
get the best thing we can for the place from themznbetween us,<br />
and it was in that context I called him. But I agree with Bob<br />
about this point, it's not making politics any easier for<br />
people and it means that anyone who is public spirited is<br />
interested in public service but who has got ability and real<br />
job opportunities, these things they will find very<br />
discouraging and it can't make the political system better and<br />
stronger. SATTLER: So what is he? Is Nick Greiner naive or<br />
stupid, is he not corrupt?<br />
PM: These are all judgements which are made by the<br />
Commission and I don't want to be drawn into that argument but<br />
the fact of the matter is that the Liberal Party in NSW tried<br />
to set a standard it couldn't live with and I don't think it<br />
has got anyone else to blame for this but itself.<br />
SATTLER: So the rules are too tight, is that what you<br />
are saying?<br />
PM: Well they are their rules, and they were<br />
basically designed to catch a past government, they were<br />
designed as a piece of sticky fly paper for the Wran<br />
government and what happened was of course the Wran<br />
government. I mean the Sydney Morning Herald ran this campaign<br />
for years saying ihe NSW Labor government was corrupt and in<br />
the end the ICAC found nothing against it. All it found<br />
against was the current Greiner government. </p>
<p>SATTLER: Poor bloke. What are you doing in Perth today<br />
apart f rom trying to get a f ow people to vote f or you at the<br />
next election because the Morgan polls and other polls would<br />
indicate you need a bit more support to get up there next<br />
year. PM: Yes but they go up and down Howard, you can't<br />
let the two week polls throw you<br />
SATTLER: But you need to get ahead, you have sort of<br />
been behind for<br />
PM: It's a problem. Unemployment, the recession,<br />
coming out of it and unemployment is a problem but I am happy<br />
to say the trend. in Western Australia are quite good. That<br />
is western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales are doing<br />
more strongly than say South Australia and Victoria and they<br />
don't have the heavy manufacturing base which Melbourne has.<br />
Western Australia is an agricultural and mining state and<br />
services tourism and the rest and it seems to be coming out of<br />
the recession into recovery stronger and faster than some<br />
other places.<br />
SATTLER: You have got to write of f Victoria at the next<br />
federal election surely. It must be a Labor disaster. area at<br />
the moment.<br />
PM: We are not travelling well over there and<br />
obviously the reason for that, there is a couple of reasons<br />
for that but one of them of course is unemployment and the<br />
recession and the fact that Victoria is I think going through<br />
a structural change. That is the nature of its manufacturing<br />
activity is changing and it is producing problems in that<br />
change. BATTLER: I have heard from your strategist that you have<br />
written of f Victoria at the next federal election.<br />
PM: You can never write anywhere of f, only a fool<br />
would write a place of f and we haven't done that but<br />
SATTLER: And you would have loved Nick Greiner to have<br />
stayed in office right up to the next election.<br />
PM: yattd sItk hma hycm. i<br />
they -Myattd isItk thma thycm. f<br />
BATTLER: but wouldn't it have been great if he had<br />
stayed there and tried to fight this corruption thing, you<br />
would have had a field day.<br />
PMT The Liberal Party wouldn't have let him I don't<br />
think. SATTLERtSATTLEHeRw: aJoonh nw ouldn't have let him you mean. </p>
<p>PM: Yea, by and large. Well him and the State<br />
Liberals. Whether the Labor Party there moved no confidence<br />
in the istate government or not, I don't think he would have<br />
stayed because for the reason you say I don't think the<br />
Liberals would have let him stay. So you can't write anywhere<br />
off and the important thing is that Australia is coming into a<br />
recovery, growth is coming back<br />
SATTLER: Hang on, how can you say that. Our deficit, if<br />
I have got it right at the end of May had gone f rom a budget<br />
forecast of $ 4.7 billion last August to now $ 11.2 billion, and<br />
you reckon we are getting better.<br />
FM8 I don't mean the deficit, I am talking about<br />
growth, the deficit is a lag response to growth in the<br />
economy. In other words if activity is down and employment is<br />
down, receipts are down, the deficit gets bigger.<br />
SATTLER: But you reckon our growth will be around about<br />
4.75 and then 4.5 in the next couple of years and the OECD<br />
says no, 2.6 to 3.7. Who has got it right?<br />
PM: The OECD are trying to do a forecast in<br />
Australia from a long distance and I don't think, it's never<br />
been eavy for them to forecast Australia well, but we still<br />
think Australia can grow quite fast through 92/ 3. The problem<br />
in that what happens in all recoveries is that in the first<br />
instance employers work people overtime before they put extra<br />
people on. So there is a lag response for employment and one<br />
of the interesting things that is happening at the moment in<br />
that overtime being worked is getting back to the levels of<br />
the boom year of 1989. That is we are now starting to see<br />
those sort of classic signs of recovery where employers are<br />
working people overtime, the next step being to put an extra<br />
person on. So growth picks up as it will pick up but there is<br />
this lag in between, this lag response to employment as the<br />
overtime phase gets worked first and then after that an<br />
employer starts saying, look I can't work someone more<br />
overtime than I am working so I will add another person,, and<br />
it's that adding of another person which starts to see the<br />
employment start to grow. But there is always a lag.<br />
BATTLERs Would your recent investments indicate we are<br />
going to have a pork led recovery?<br />
PM: I don't think no, no.<br />
SATTLER: Why did you put the money in for?<br />
PM: In the 6 months that I was out of the<br />
government I thought that I should do, I mean I have always<br />
preached don't put you money into property, don't speculate,<br />
don't rely upon inflation. If you want to invest in something<br />
don't buy an apartment or a flat or a house, or<br />
SATTLER: SATTaL EcRl: oOcrk ? </p>
<p>11.<br />
PM: or a c1ocki do something which employs people,<br />
acids value, plays to Australia's comparative advantage and I<br />
thought why don't It I have been preaching this for years, why<br />
don't I put my money where my mouth is.<br />
SATTLERi I have got the slogan f or the Labor Party f or<br />
the next election, home on a pig's back.<br />
PM: I hope that in true, I hope it comes true.<br />
SATTLER: Thanks for joining us on the program today<br />
Prime Minieter.<br />
