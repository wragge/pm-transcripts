THE PRIME MINISTER MIADE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT AT TILE<br />
LEBANESE RALrLY OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT HOUSE THIS AFTERNOON:<br />
I want to thank you for being here to express your very very<br />
deep concern at the time of tragedy in your country. I want<br />
to assure you that the Australian Government is conscious of<br />
the tragedy which is happening in Lebanon and it is happening<br />
because of the existence in your country of foreign forces<br />
there and it is the clear position of the Australian Government<br />
that all those foreign forces should be removed from the Lebanon.<br />
The Australian Government, both in direct submissions to the<br />
countries concerned and at the United Nations, will continue<br />
to put that position, so that the people of Lebanon can have<br />
brought to an end the tragedy which has cost the lives of<br />
thousands and thousands of your fellow citizens.<br />
The people of the Lebanon are the people who have suffered most<br />
in the tragedy of the Middle East and they are suffering not<br />
simply because of internal problems that you have but most<br />
particularly because other countries anJ other forces are trying<br />
to fight their battles in your country.<br />
They should leave your country and allow the people of the<br />
Lebanon to live in peace so they can develop in peace the eccnomy<br />
of Lebanon so that all Lebanese all young Lebanese people<br />
in particular face the opportunity of growing and living in<br />
a country at peace.<br />
Now the capacity of Australia is limited in what we can do,<br />
but as I have told your representatives, your Ambassador, the<br />
reDresentatives of your Church, and the representatives of<br />
your conmunity organisations, I give you the pledge that<br />
everything that the Australian Government can do, will be done. </p>
