MEDIA 17 APRIL 1979<br />
AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE TO YUGOSLAV<br />
EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Fraser, announced today that the<br />
Australian Government is to donate the sum of $ 100,000 to<br />
help relieve the plight of victims of the earthquake<br />
which devastated Yugoslavia's southern Adriatic region<br />
in recent days.<br />
The Prime Minister has written to President Tito expressing<br />
the sympathy of the Australian Government and people for the<br />
tragic loss of life and property sustained by the people<br />
of Yugoslavia in this major disaster, and offering<br />
our assistance.<br />
The Government is conscious of the concern which the large<br />
numbers of Australians of Yugoslav origin are feeling for<br />
the safety and welfare of relatives in the stricken area.<br />
Accordingly, persons wishing to enquire about the welfare<br />
of relatives and friends in Yugoslavia may ring the<br />
Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra on 613474; an<br />
interpreter will be available to assist with inquiries.<br />
As in previous such situations, the Government will act<br />
immediately to assist in relation to immigration cases.<br />
Immediate priority will be given to those nominations already<br />
in the pipeline involving people made homeless by the<br />
earthquake and priority will also be given to other nominations<br />
lodged in the immediate future which are within existing<br />
immigration criteria.<br />
Nominations outside the normal criteria where such compassionate<br />
circumstances exist, such as where families have been deprived<br />
of their breadwinner or where children have been orphaned,<br />
will be accepted and dealt with quickly.<br />
Immigrat ion staff from Belgrade would go to the disaster<br />
areas as soon as possible to ensure speedy handling<br />
of applications. -000--4Si~<br />
