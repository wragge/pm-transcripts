SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE NATIONAL FAMILY SUMMIT, PARLIAMENT<br />
HOUSE, CANBERRA ACT, I11 NOVEMBER 1992<br />
Ita, Summit delegates, fricnds<br />
I appreciate being given the opportunity to deliver the official opening adldress to<br />
this important event.<br />
I know, Ita, that you were motivated to organise this national gathering by your<br />
concern for the social problems you identified as hcing suffc red by many<br />
Australian families today.<br />
I commend your initiativc in gathering together an impressive array of Australians<br />
for this meeting, and trust that these two days will produce fruitful and productive<br />
discussions. I note that you intend to present to me a summary of the Summit proccdings and I<br />
look forward to hearing your thoughts on how wc should all bc rcspoilding to the<br />
changing face of families in Australia today.<br />
For my part, I would like to spend the time available to mc this morning<br />
contributing some of my own thoughts on this challenging subject.<br />
In doing so, I speak as a family mcmber as a husband and a father, as well as a<br />
son and a brother. But T also speak as a member of a Government which has<br />
directed considerable policy effort over the past decade towards addressing the<br />
financial and othcr nccds of familics.<br />
ZO/ TOd 1000N 60: 8 Z6' AON'TI :-1331 </p>
<p>I am proud of my own contribution towards many of these policics particularly<br />
those, such as the establishment of the Child Support Agency and the introduction<br />
of the Family Allowance Supplcm nt which have put money into the hands of<br />
women and children who previously went without.<br />
The record of thc Child Support Agency speaks for itself.<br />
Before it was set up in 1988, only 24 per cent of custodial parents received child<br />
support and the average level of maintenance was $ 26 per child per week.<br />
Today the Agency collcts 70 per cent of the amount on its hooks, and the average<br />
level of support is now $ 48 per child per week.<br />
Similarly, the Family Allowance Supplement has put money into the pockets of<br />
those who really need it. The $ 3 per child per week incrca-.; to FAS recipients<br />
provided for in the ' One Nation' package bcnefited 750,000 low income families<br />
who, between them, have 1.5 million children.<br />
Some of thc government's; biggest programs such as Medicare, Family Allowances<br />
and our housing programs are greatly beneficial to families, especially families<br />
with low incomes.<br />
In fact, it is difficult to think of any of our policics in the income support area, the<br />
health area, the housing area, the community services area that do not benefit<br />
families. This is especially true when wc consider the great variety of family forms that exist<br />
in Australia today.<br />
When we talk about Australian families today. we have to include families of all<br />
sorts and sizes.<br />
Familics with children where both parents are present.<br />
Families with children headed by sole parents women or men.<br />
Families that include several generations living uinder the same roof.<br />
Families where one member cares for another who is frail aged, chronically ill,<br />
disabled or suffering from HI V/ AIDS.<br />
I0/ ZO0d TOO'ON 60: 8 Z6' AON* TT13-131 </p>
<p>And let's not forget all the other combinations, thc single people, the childless, thc<br />
once-or never-married who live alone, the " enipty-ncstcrs" and all the others who<br />
arc equally entitled to be included whcn we speak of the great family of our nation.<br />
In other words, when it comes to caring for people in need be that need physical,<br />
financial, emotional or spiritual let's not overlook anyone just because they<br />
happen not to live in the kind of traditional arrangements that perhaps once<br />
characterised the majority of households.<br />
At the same time, I think we have to acknowledge that families where children are<br />
present are often those where governments have a special rolc to play in providing<br />
financial and other forms of assistance.<br />
Families with children often have greater financial needs, and it is up to us as a<br />
society to ensure that the next generation is clothed and fed and -; hcltcrcd and<br />
educated. That is thc very least we can do.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemcn.<br />
You are no doubt aware that 1994 has been designated by the United Nations as the<br />
International Year of theFamily.<br />
We see this as a most important year because it will enable us, as a government and<br />
as a community, to draw together our ideas and our thinking about families and<br />
help us frame approaches for the future.<br />
We intend that, as far as Australia is concerned, 1994 IYF will be a year in<br />
which we truly try to come to grips with some of the challenges today's families<br />
face.<br />
To emphasise how seriously we intend to treat JYF let me inform you today of<br />
some of the initial decisions we have already takcn in order to be well prepared.<br />
First, I propose to appoint a Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the<br />
International Year of the Family and I have already approached the Minister for<br />
Aged, Family and Health Services, my colleague Peter Staples, ahout accepting<br />
this position.<br />
I am delighted that he has agreed to do so.<br />
TOO00N 60: 8 Z6' AON'TT13:-131 </p>
<p>Secondly, I have decided to establish an JYF S-cretariat in my department so that I<br />
can bc closely involved in thc Ycar's activities. Part of the role of the Secretariat<br />
will be to support an lYF Council composed of members with a variety of<br />
backgrounds and expertisc who will advise the Government and bc a focus for<br />
IYF. I am very pleased to be ablc to announce today that Jennifer Rowe has accepted the<br />
Government's invitation to be Chair of this Council.<br />
For the past fivc years Jennifer Rowe has been editor of Thc Australian Women's<br />
Wcckly, a position sh~ e will leave next month in ordcr to devote herself to her<br />
writing. Ms. Rowe is well known as thc author of adult mystery books, but shc also<br />
deserves recognition for the six best-selling children's books she has written under<br />
the pen name Emily Rodda. Indeed, four of these books have won thc Australian<br />
Children's Book of the Year Award.<br />
Ms Rowe is vitally interested in all aspects of Australian family life and especially<br />
in the challenges faced by the traditional form of the family in today's inceasingly<br />
complex and difficult world.<br />
Her stewardship of the Women's Wcckl-v has put her in touch, with thousands of<br />
familics and she is very alive to the many issuecs families face in a world that no<br />
longer provides tradition or other forms of certainty.<br />
Ms. Rowe is uniquely qualified to lead the IYF Council and I am very plcased she<br />
has agreed to accept this important post.<br />
Thc Government will give careful consideration to the issues nominated by the IYF<br />
Council to address during the Year, but I should like to say today that I will be a<br />
strong advocate for the inclusion of two vital issues.<br />
Domestic violence is one.<br />
How we go about reconciling work and family is the other.<br />
Les's than a fortnight ago I spoke on the subject of violence against women.<br />
I said then, and let me repeat now, that we as a socicty have an obligation to do<br />
something about the terrible toll of violence against women. I singled out domestic<br />
I0/ VO'd 1000ON 60: 8 Z6' AONvr 1131 </p>
<p>violence, saying that we do not know its truc extent, but it is probably greater than<br />
any of us would like to admit.<br />
I say today that I believe we should make the elimination of domestic violence one<br />
of the major aims of the International Year of thc Family.<br />
I don't want to be unrealistic hy setting unreachable goals, but I do believe we can<br />
say that as a society we regard violence within the homc as intolerable and that we<br />
will use the International Year of the Family as our opportunity to take every step<br />
we can to end it.<br />
Womcn and children have the right to safety, the right not to fccl frightened in the<br />
very place whcrc they are entitled to find shclter.<br />
It is surely not too much to ask that wc as a society will strive to make this right a<br />
reality. The second issue I wish to argue for is the reconciling of our work and family lives<br />
for policies and arrangcments on how to make the various aspects of our lives fit<br />
more harmoniously together.<br />
So our lives can become less stressful.<br />
In particular so women's lives can becomc less stressful.<br />
It is women who, these days, are more often the ones who shoulder the " double<br />
burden" of managing the time-tables of family members and who run family<br />
finances in addition to their paid job outside the home.<br />
It is no wonder that many women are just dead tired all the time.<br />
We should be looking for ways to make it easier for them, be they at home all day<br />
with kids or in the paid work-force.<br />
This is an issue on which the government has spoken many times in the past.<br />
I have myself previously advocated that our workplaces become more " familyfriendly".<br />
By this we mean more flexible working arrangements so parents can attend to<br />
children who are sick or need special attcntion. We mean better access to child-<br />
ZO/ SOd 1000ON 60: 8 Z6' AONII : 11331 </p>
<p>care, and child-care where the hours arc compatible with parcnts' working days.<br />
We mean leave that enables women and men to spend time with newborn infants.<br />
As a government we are proud of our rccord in child care.<br />
We have increased the number of places five-fold. We have cstablished a fee<br />
relief system which kccps fees down in community and private sector centres for<br />
low and middle income families. And we have introduced nccds-hased planning<br />
to try to ensure that services arc located where they arc most needed.<br />
Since we came to office we have increased the number of subsidised places from<br />
46,000 to 193,000. By mid 1996 we expect to have over 250,000 child care places<br />
available. This is a record to stand on but we intend to do more.<br />
Already we are planning innovations in our approach. For instance, we have begun<br />
piloting special care for sick kids because we know this is one of the greatest<br />
causes of anxiety in parents what do you do if your child is sick and needs to be<br />
looked after?<br />
Thcrc are many other subjects we could include under this issue of how we<br />
reconcile these two important areas of our lives.<br />
You could almost say it is the crux of modern family life.<br />
It will be one of the more challenging aspects of the International Ycar of the<br />
Family, I believe, to come up with practical suggestions for how to make it easier<br />
for all of us but especially those of us with young children to achieve greater<br />
harmony between these two areas of our lives.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
I do not believe it is necessary to wait until 1993, however, to address another issue<br />
which I know is of great concern to parents.<br />
I refer to the subject of violence in the media.<br />
Last wcek in the Parliament I raised the matter of the amount of violence on<br />
tclevision. Following my remarks, I have been in touch with the Federation of<br />
Australian Commercial Television Stations ( FACTS) and I will bc meeting with<br />
Bob Campbell, its Chairman, next week.<br />
TO000N 60: 8 Z6' AON* IT : 131 </p>
<p>I look forward to a productive discussion with Mr Campbell, and I am confident<br />
we caii address the legitimatc conicerns many parents have within the selfregulatory<br />
framework to which the government is committed.<br />
But my concern about violence on our screens is not confined to what is aircd on<br />
television. I am also worried about what we see on the big screen when we go to the movies<br />
and what we sec in our homes when we rent videos.<br />
I believe that all us should bc ablc to have confidcnce in thc classifications system<br />
so that we are not taken by surprise by the contents of a film or a vidco.<br />
This is important to us as adults who want to decide what kind of entertainment we<br />
are paying for, but it is quite cr itical when it comes to choosing movies or videos<br />
for our children will watch.<br />
For thc past three years the Office of Film and Literature Classification has<br />
enhanced the classifications by providing consumer advice for all films and videos.<br />
This advice is set out on the bottom of video covers and in display adver tiscmcnts<br />
for films.<br />
This consumer advice is important in assisting parents to try and decide what is<br />
suitable for thcir children to see, but it does not make up for a funidamcntal<br />
weakness in our classification system.<br />
I am referring to the far too broad scope of the classification for films and<br />
videos. The category is absurdly broad.<br />
I find it difficult to accept the utility of a system which brackets " Crocodile<br />
Dundee" and " Cape Fcar" in thc same " IM" category.<br />
I am sure many other parent.-would share my lack of confidence in such a system.<br />
But what can wc realistically do about it?<br />
In the past there have been suggestions that a special category be creatcd just for<br />
films which depict violence.<br />
2-1OLd TOO* ON 60: 8 Z6* AQNTT13:-131 </p>
<p>TEL: 8<br />
While this would help to identify violent films, it would ignore the concerns of<br />
many parents in the community about coarse language, or depictions of sex or<br />
drug-use which also feature prominently in the category.<br />
I believe that there should be two levels in the prescnt category.<br />
The first would cover the lower end of the category, would include all films and<br />
videos which contained " milder" material and would like the present " M"<br />
category be advisory only.<br />
The second, which might be called MA, would be restricted rather than advisory<br />
( meaning there would be penalties for allowing children under 15 access to these<br />
films unless accompanied by an adult) and would apply to the<br />
other, more raunchy and more violent end of the spectrum.<br />
At the same time as we were making more sense of these classifications, we might<br />
want to take a look at the recommendation of the formcr Australian Broadcasting<br />
Tribunal for a singlc classification system for television and for films and video.<br />
The present dual system is confusing to all concerned.<br />
I recognise these are difficult issues.<br />
We are not trying to restrict what adults can watch.<br />
But I do think I speak for many parents when I say we need more reliable means of<br />
knowing the contents of films and videos so we can make infornmcd choices about<br />
what our children are subjected to.<br />
In this spirit, I propose to ask my colleagues, the State Premiers and Chief<br />
Ministers, to agree to list film and video classification as an agenda item at the<br />
Council of Australian Govermecnts meeting to be held in Perth on December 7.<br />
I trust they will agree that finding a fair and equitable solution to this subject is in<br />
the interests of us all and is especially in the interests of Australia's children.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
I have great pleasure in declaring this National Family Summit officially open and<br />
I trust the next two days will see you engage in much constructive discussion.<br />
Thank you. T1EL1:. Nov. 92 9: 45 No-005 P. 02/ 02 </p>
