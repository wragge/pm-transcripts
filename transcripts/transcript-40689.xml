    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I am announcing changes to the Ministry that I will be recommending to His Excellency the Governor General.</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce that Greg Hunt will become the Minister for Health and Minister for Sport.</p>
<p>Greg has previously served as Minister for the Environment, and Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science. He has strong policy, analytical and communication skills developed over a long front bench career.</p>
<p>During his time as Environment Minister he demonstrated an ability to grapple with extremely complex policy issues, engage a diverse range of stakeholders and interest groups including State and Territory Governments.</p>
<p>Senator Arthur Sinodinos will take over as Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science. This portfolio is critical to generating the jobs of the future and Senator Sinodinos’ extensive public policy experience gives him a strong understanding of the key drivers of new sources of economic growth.</p>
<p>As Cabinet Secretary, Arthur restored traditional cabinet processes. That being done, he can now turn his talents to a front line portfolio and the Cabinet Secretary function can return to the Prime Minister’s Office as has been the practice of Coalition Governments.</p>
<p>This will reduce the size of the Cabinet by one.</p>
<p>The Special Minister of State, Senator Scott Ryan, will continue to support the work of the Cabinet as ‘Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Cabinet’.</p>
<p>There will be other changes to the outer Ministry.</p>
<p>Ken Wyatt, who has been the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, will become the Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Indigenous Health. Just as Ken was the first indigenous person to be elected to the House of Representatives and the first to be appointed to the executive, he is now the first Indigenous person appointed to a Commonwealth Ministry.</p>
<p>His extensive knowledge and experience as a senior public servant in Indigenous health coupled with his work as an Assistant Minister in this portfolio will make him an ideal Minister for the area.</p>
<p>As senior minister, Mr Hunt will of course represent the Aged Care sector in Cabinet.</p>
<p>Dr. David Gillespie will continue to serve in the portfolio as Assistant Minister for Health.</p>
<p>Michael Sukkar will be appointed Assistant Minister to the Treasurer.</p>
<p>These changes will further strengthen my Ministry by combining experience and new talent. It’s a team that’s focused on delivering for all Australians.</p>
<p>The new Ministers will be sworn in by the Governor General in Canberra on Tuesday.</p>
