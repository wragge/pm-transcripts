<p> Team and the Australian Cricket Team, Jelena Dokic, GST legislation,</p>
<p> ACT Chief Minister</p>
<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>It's a great delight to welcome to the programme the Prime Minister</p>
<p> of Australia, John Howard, good morning, sir.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>How are you? Very nice to be on your programme.</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>It's been a good night for you Â the cricketers, Hockeyroos</p>
<p> yesterday.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, we had a great reception for the Australian Womens' Hockey</p>
<p> Team which, having been world champions for six years in a row, has</p>
<p> probably done something in that sense that no other Australian team</p>
<p> in any sport has done. And as the President of Womens' Hockey</p>
<p> pointed out to me yesterday, they have 127 countries against which</p>
<p> to compete, so it was an incredible performance on their part. And</p>
<p> we had a great reception for Steve Waugh and the Cricket Team last</p>
<p> night which was a tremendous opportunity for us all, as members of</p>
<p> the National Parliament, to honour them. And I think they're</p>
<p> now receptioned out.</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>That's a nice way to put it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And are now going to go away and have a bit of a break which they</p>
<p> certainly deserve. Now that's the sport but, of course...</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>Well, I was also going to say very quickly, Jelena Dokic overnight,</p>
<p> into the quarter finals, terrific.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>She did very well too and proved that first round win was no flash</p>
<p> in the pan.</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>Certainly wasn't.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The other really big news of long-term importance to Australian community</p>
<p> is the new tax system is now just a vote in the House of Representatives</p>
<p> away from reality. It's now cleared through the Senate. It will</p>
<p> go through the House of Representatives, we expect, tonight. It will</p>
<p> then become law. And in a year's time the Australian public will</p>
<p> have the best tax system it's had for 40 years. It will have</p>
<p> big personal tax cuts, $12 billion of them, particularly big cuts</p>
<p> for middle income families, a far more efficient taxation system,</p>
<p> a fairer system, one that helps our exporters, cuts the cost of fuel,</p>
<p> will be seen as a far simpler system. And over the next year we'll</p>
<p> be putting a lot of resources into explaining the workings of the</p>
<p> tax system and how people will benefit so that when it comes into</p>
<p> operation, I'm sure after a few weeks, people will say what was</p>
<p> all the fuss about.</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>Yeah, but as you know, Prime Minister, Gail has taught me to always</p>
<p> read the fine print. As I haven't got into all the fine print</p>
<p> now I'll put it to you, who are going to be disadvantaged? There</p>
<p> always has to be losers.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The crooks will be disadvantaged.</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>Simple as that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They will be heavily disadvantaged because a system that taxes what</p>
<p> you spend more than what you earn is always harder to dodge.</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>And also can we lay another furphy to rest. A lot of people say, Âoh</p>
<p> but look at New Zealand.' New Zealand didn't take out the</p>
<p> wholesales tax. They just top-loaded a GST, didn't they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it was Canada, Canada. That was a mistake Canada made. Quite different</p>
<p> from Canada, we are getting rid of the wholesale sales tax, lock stock</p>
<p> and barrel. So all that 12 per cent, 22 per cent, 32 per cent, 45</p>
<p> per cent, all of that goes out the window simultaneously with the</p>
<p> introduction of the GST.</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>And fresh food, GST free.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Fresh food, GST free.</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>Health, education.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Health, education, yes.</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>So, it's been a long battle.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It has been a long battle.</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>Were there nights where you thought, oh blow this, let's just</p>
<p> stick with what we've got?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no. Once I started on the campaign just on two years ago I was</p>
<p> determined to get it and I never gave up.</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>Now, your Opposition appeared to give up. Have they become irrelevant?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the problem with the Opposition is that the only thing they</p>
<p> can do is say no and in Opposition you've got to learn to put</p>
<p> forward alternative policies. The public is tired of automatic adversarial</p>
<p> politics. I think the public is fed up with that. What the public</p>
<p> wants from both sides of politics are ideas. Now, of course an Opposition</p>
<p> has got to oppose a lot of things, I understand that. When I was in</p>
<p> Opposition I opposed a lot of things the Labor Party did. And I'm</p>
<p> not pretending that I didn't but I also put forward alternatives.</p>
<p> And in Opposition people knew me more for what I was in favour of</p>
<p> than for what I was against. They knew that I was in favour of industrial</p>
<p> relations reform. They knew that I was in favour of privatisation.</p>
<p> They knew that I was in favour of tax reform. Now, I was better known</p>
<p> for those things than I was for the things that I was against. But</p>
<p> I'm afraid the Labor Party at the moment is only known for the</p>
<p> fact that it disagrees with the Government on everything.</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>Yeah, polls earlier this week indicated the young voter is turning</p>
<p> away from Labor and a caller on our open line, Prime Minister, suggested</p>
<p> that perhaps the youngsters are seeing Labor at the moment as a bit</p>
<p> like mum and dad who are forever saying, no, no, no, you can't</p>
<p> do this, you can't do that and this constant bleeding in Opposition</p>
<p> is perhaps turning away some of the younger voters who traditionally</p>
<p> used to be Labor supporters.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I saw those polls. They were encouraging but I never get too</p>
<p> carried away with polls. I work very hard to earn the support of all</p>
<p> sections of the Australian community. There are some signs that younger</p>
<p> people are particularly attracted to the fact that we are willing</p>
<p> to do things and we are willing to change things that need changing.</p>
<p> I'm very much of the view that you should follow an approach</p>
<p> where you change things that need reform but you don't change</p>
<p> just for the sake of change.</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>Now, talking of change, there's a possibility that there could</p>
<p> be a change in the Chief Minister here in the ACT inside the next</p>
<p> 48 hours. Now, you don't always get along with Kate Carnell.</p>
<p> Drug reform is a good public example. So would you be all that concerned</p>
<p> to see her go, if she was to go?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it would be a great shame for the ACT if Kate were to be removed</p>
<p> as Chief Minister. It is true that we don't always agree on some</p>
<p> social issues. We have our disagreements. I don't pretend that</p>
<p> we have identical opinions on a number of issues. But taking a broader</p>
<p> view, she has been a very good Chief Minister for Canberra, for the</p>
<p> ACT. She has turned the economy of this Territory around. She has</p>
<p> overseen the transfer of activity from the Government to the private</p>
<p> sector. The economy of the ACT is now performing very strongly. And</p>
<p> she has shown a capacity, an innovative capacity, to attract new investment</p>
<p> to the ACT. She's got the service industries coming in here in</p>
<p> a big way. And the manner in which I've seen her in three-and-a-quarter</p>
<p> years that I've been Prime Minister alter the structure of the</p>
<p> economy of the ACT in response to the shift away from a bigger public</p>
<p> sector has really been quite admirable. And there's nobody on</p>
<p> the horizon that can touch her as a Chief Minister in the Territory.</p>
<p> And, as I say, we're not going to agree on everything, we haven't</p>
<p> in the past, we won't in the future, but I think it would be</p>
<p> crazy and I think it would be a huge step backwards for her to be</p>
<p> removed. I mean, I just don't think any of the alternatives Â</p>
<p> well, the only alternative is to have a Labor government. And I can't</p>
<p> see, with great respect - and I don't now the Opposition Leader</p>
<p> at all well and I'm not denigrating him personally - but I just</p>
<p> can't see the point in her removal. And I think she's given</p>
<p> an explanation of what happened in relation to the stadium and I hope</p>
<p> that the Assembly rejects the vote of no confidence. I certainly think</p>
<p> Canberra will be the loser is she is removed.</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>Now, last time we spoke, Prime Minister, I asked you and I know you</p>
<p> have been so I'll put it to you again, every opportunity can</p>
<p> you keep hammering for international status of our airport because</p>
<p> it could be so good?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, well that is something that Mrs Carnell...</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>I know she's at you all the time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...whenever she talks to me she's at me and we are, over the</p>
<p> next few weeks, going to be examining the whole question of airport</p>
<p> capacity in eastern Australian, particularly in New South Wales and</p>
<p> the ACT. So, that is something...</p>
<p>GILBERT:</p>
<p>The Capital region want it, sir. Sir, I thank you for your time this</p>
<p> morning. Great delight. Thank you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Nice talking to you. Bye, bye.</p>
