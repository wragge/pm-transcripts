TRANSCRIPT OF PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH AUSTRALIAN WORKERS'<br />
UNION JUBILEE CONFERENCE CENTENNIAL DINNER BALLARAT<br />
24 JANUARY 1986<br />
Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
A notice in the Ballarat Courier on the 12th of June 1886 was<br />
a model of precision. In simple unique terms it said:<br />
' IMPORTANT NOTICE TO SHEARERS: A MEETING OF SHEARERS WILL BE<br />
HELD FERNS HOTEL, STURT STREET THIS SATURDAY EVENING AT<br />
8 O'CLOCK. BUSINESS: RE-ESTABLISHING A SHEARERS' UNION ALL<br />
SHEARERS ARE REQUESTED TO ATTEND. DAVID TEMPLE, SECRETARY<br />
PRO TEM."<br />
When those first forty men ( later in the evening the number<br />
swelled to something like 100) sat down in Ferns Hotel at<br />
8.00 o'clock on that evening in June 1886, they could have<br />
had no idea that they were initiating what would become in<br />
fact-one of the great elements and legends of the future<br />
Australian nation.* They elected W. G. Spence as Chairman,<br />
David Temple as Secretary and a Committee of nine. They<br />
were the products of their time and they were reacting to the<br />
injustices of their time. And in that they provided great<br />
leadership. But like all leaders of greatness, their secret<br />
was in their capacity to get a glimpse of the future, create<br />
a vision and then, on that glimpse of the future, to establish<br />
the principles of organisation and the policies for action upon<br />
that perception of that future and to be relevant for that<br />
future. And this greatness the glimpse of the future those<br />
great leaders had was reflected in two central principles I<br />
believe enunciated by Spence and accepted from the outset by the<br />
Union. They have been referred to already this evening.<br />
Firstly, as a central principle as they put it, the Union must<br />
be intercolonial, ignoring arbitrary political boundaries.<br />
Secondly, the policy of the Union was to be consultation and<br />
conciliation. And associated with those two fundamental<br />
principles came the commitment to political action through the<br />
Australian Labor Party, soon to emnerge to share a similar<br />
unbroken history with the Australian Workers' Union. And it<br />
was because of that far-sightedness, because of their capacity<br />
to get that glimpse of the future which shaped those basic<br />
principles to which I have referred, that a new young organisation<br />
which became the AWU was able to grow. That organisation your<br />
organisation grew with Australian industry. It grew with a<br />
conciliation and arbitration system and it grew to the<br />
Parliamentary Labor Party. </p>
<p>Let me just briefly refer to thbse three aspects of its growth.<br />
Because those early leaders of the AWU had that glimpse of the<br />
future, the sort of organisational constitution which they<br />
established was one which lent itself to involvement with the<br />
diversification of the Australian economy which occurred from<br />
the turn of the last century. So through the consti* tution<br />
which they shaped we have seen throughout this century the ACTU<br />
going into a vast range of industries and there's hardly any<br />
industry of significance of which the AWU is not either direct * ly<br />
or indirectly associated. Secondly, as I said, it grew with the<br />
concilitation and arbitration system because of those early<br />
16&amp; ders that had-the for-esight ' fo under~ stand that the path inthe<br />
future in Australia was going to be one in which the<br />
intekests of those that they sought to serve would be best met<br />
by the processes of conciliation and discussion. And so, in<br />
their own constitution, they were ready to grow with that<br />
conciliation and arbitration system which in fact they were so<br />
instrumental in helping to establish.<br />
And as the Judges of the High Court interpreted our constitution<br />
in a way which allowed that Court the early Arbitration<br />
Court to grow in a way which had never been envisaged by the<br />
founders of the constitution and those interpretations allowed<br />
the jurisdiction to be indited by the serving of paper demands<br />
from their rejection by employers, the AWU was there centrally<br />
involved in that growth. Because of that glimpse of the future<br />
that I referred to, the nature of the organisation of the AWU<br />
lent itself to involvement with the growth of the conciliation<br />
and arbitration system.<br />
May I say by way of parenthesis about the greatest conciliation<br />
and arbitration system in the AWU, I still remember with<br />
amusement and, indeed with affection, the headlines in The<br />
Worker in 1959 when a young academic moved down from the<br />
Australian National University to become the advocate for the<br />
ACTU to take over the role of Dick Eggleston, Queen's Council.<br />
The Worker described the transition with the headline " From<br />
Eggleston to Egghead". I think in a very short time the doubts<br />
of my good friends in the AWU haa been cast aside and together<br />
we were able to work in that position for the advancement of<br />
the working people of Australia.<br />
Thirdly, I said the AWU grew with the Parliamentary Labor Party.<br />
It is a matter of well established record and fact that in the<br />
early days of the Australian Labor Party, both at the State and<br />
the Federal level, the AWU was synonymous with the growth of<br />
that Party. The people who learnt their politics in the<br />
industrial fields of the AWU quickly transferred into the<br />
Parliamentary halls of this countfry at the State and Federal<br />
level. </p>
<p>There were so many great figurqs that emerged provided<br />
three Prime Ministers in Watson, Scullin and Curtin. A range<br />
of great figures and that tradition has been maint-ained by*<br />
one we have here tonight Mick Young. I believe, when the<br />
story of the 20th century political scene is written, there will<br />
be very few, if any, to match Mick in the great wit, insight and<br />
humanity which he has brought to the Federal Parliament.<br />
Let me say of that growth of the AWU, acquired with the growth<br />
of the Parliamentary Labor Party, it depended not simply upon<br />
those periods when Labor was in office long period in the<br />
State Parliament,.-not so long in--the Federal Parliament--buteven<br />
when Labor was not in office, never let it be forgotten<br />
that it was essentially the Labor Party of this country that<br />
set the terms of the political agenda in this country. And<br />
that had to always have been true.<br />
of course it is a matter of great pride now that in so much of<br />
Australia, including at the Federal level, Labor is in power<br />
and we are setting that agenda directly and not indirectly.<br />
It was true of the AWU as it grew in the way to which I have<br />
referred that it grew with Australian industry. And it grew<br />
with the conciliation and arbitration system as it grew with<br />
the Parliamentary Labor Party. It is true of the AWU that it<br />
rejected the extremes of political philosophy. It was essentially<br />
a Party committed to the democratic socialism, social democracy<br />
( describe it as you will). But essentially it was a movement<br />
and organisation committed to the Parliamentary system and if<br />
you wanted to find one single proposition which would describe,<br />
I believe, the philosophy of the AWU from its beginning right<br />
through its history, you don't have to get into complicated<br />
philosophies, but simply to say, it essentially believes in the<br />
equality of opportunity. It believes in an Australia where<br />
young people, irrespective of the background and income level<br />
of their parents, should have that equality and opportunity.<br />
We can say at the end of this 100 years that things have changed,<br />
and with those changes and growth has consistently developed<br />
and grown the AWU. We can say that things have changed but we<br />
can also say that things have stood still. Because just as I<br />
was looking at a few notes in the last couple of days about<br />
the early period of the AWU, I was reminded how much, for some<br />
people, things have stood still. Those of you steeped in the<br />
history of the AWU will recall in those latter days of the 1880s<br />
and the early days of the 1890s that the one central cause of<br />
conflict was the question of freedom of contract.<br />
It is fascinating, isn't it, how the conservatives throughout<br />
history have had this facility for tying up the most reactionary<br />
and conservative position in the most beautiful and liberal<br />
language. They talked about the freedom of contract. That's<br />
what they were fighting for. When~ they talked about the freedom<br />
of contract what they were talking about is the right of the boss<br />
to exclude the union and on their terms to ensure that they got<br />
labour on the worst possible terms. </p>
<p>And that's what the AWU fought about. They have living proof<br />
to the concept of unity being. strength. They weren't going to<br />
leave individuals to be exploited to the whims of. people<br />
waving the great flag of freedom of contract but under that<br />
delightful banner being permitted to establish conditions<br />
socially unacceptable. The AWU fought against that contract<br />
of so-called freedom of contract in the 1880s and the 1890s.<br />
As I say, things have not changed because, if you look around<br />
today, you see the same sort of people wanting to talk about<br />
freedom of contract, to push the unions out of the way, to give<br />
the right as they say, to people just to deal with their<br />
employees. Now-it sounds marvellous but it's just the same in 1986 as<br />
it was in 1886. It's still founded on exactly the same<br />
principle that employers should be allowed under that process<br />
to deal with individuals in a way to try and ensure that they<br />
will not get the sort of benefits that they are entitled to<br />
get from their involvement in the productive process. So I say<br />
nothing has changed.<br />
It always makes me amused when I hear people in that sort of<br />
context say why should they have anything to do with the trade<br />
union. The very basis upon which those people start is from<br />
the standards which have been established-. over the years, the<br />
generations beforehand, by the millions of Australian working<br />
men and women who, through their association in great unions<br />
like the AWU, fought together to ensure that there shall be<br />
decent standards ' in this country. And I believe that as far as<br />
Australia is concerned today, they are no more in 1986 going<br />
to succumb to the blandishments of this misguided and deceptive<br />
language than your predecessors did in 1886. We will not be<br />
decluded by language like that.<br />
Throughout your 100 years you as a Union and those before you<br />
set your sights on objectives which should be pursued to<br />
advance the cause of ordinary working men and women and those<br />
dependent upon them. You have not been static or unimaginative<br />
in the perception of where the duty of the organisation lay in<br />
meeting those interests. And if I could bring you up-to-date<br />
on a matter which is perhaps not so generally understood as it<br />
should be. When we talk about superannuation it is the AWU<br />
which in recent years has been in the forefront of advancing<br />
that concept. You saw that, because of the nature of some of<br />
the industries in which many of your members were involved, being<br />
under very considerable difficulties, they should receive justice<br />
in terms of retirement benefits.<br />
A decade or more ago you devoted-yourselves to developing schemes<br />
which would give universal coverage wherever your members went.<br />
In terms of superannuation you have been so successful I<br />
understand. Industries, employers and others have asked you to<br />
drop the AWU exclusivity provision so that you can bring to bear<br />
the benefits and the very considerable experience that you ' ye<br />
developed in that area. It is appropriate therefore that you<br />
should have taken the lead in an issue which is going to be<br />
predominant in the industrial field in the next year or so. </p>
<p>Let me make it quite clear that . the Government, as is obvious<br />
through its discussions with the ACTU, totally endorses the<br />
principles that have now been arrived at. Remember what the<br />
facts are in regard to superannuation in this country. Half<br />
the people, that is working people have it. But it's very<br />
inequitably distributed in terms of the income levels~ of those<br />
who enjoy it. Of those who are on $ 480 a week or more, over<br />
per cent have superannuation. So if you look at those with<br />
an income of $ 280 or less a week, less than 30 per cent of<br />
those have superannuation. Now that sort of situation is not<br />
tolerable and it was inevitable, given a democracy such as ours,<br />
that-there was going to be-a push-to make-superannuatio-general-<br />
It is not only in the best interests of those who currently have<br />
not got superannuation, but it's also in the interests of the<br />
community as a whole that the extension of this benefit should<br />
now be pursued in a coordinated, regulated way which has regard<br />
to the varying capacities of sections of the Australian industry.<br />
And that's what is at the centre and the heart of the Accord<br />
that's been reached between our Government and the ACT).<br />
Just briefly, there are three things I would like to say about<br />
that, picking up some of the totally misguided criticism that<br />
has been made about the agreement that's been reached between<br />
the Government and the ACTJ. Firstly, it is said that this is<br />
ignoring the rights and the role and the responsibility of the<br />
Arbitration Commission. I want to say before his Hon Mr Justice<br />
Madden that that Accord is not so.<br />
Both the Government and the ACTU have a very clear and proper<br />
understanding and respect for the role of the Commission and<br />
there is a total role for the Commission in its consideration<br />
of the way in which this benefit which is enjoyed by half the<br />
working population of Australia should be extended the timing<br />
and placing and so on. It is accepted and understood by us and,<br />
I believe, by the Commission, that there is a proper role for<br />
the Commission in that regard.<br />
Secondly, there is the misguided proposition which says there<br />
is no capacity, that the Union is talking about past productivity<br />
and that's been used up. Let me make it quite clear that the<br />
cooperation of the trade union movement in the past two or three<br />
years, which has brought Australia to a position where it has<br />
the highest rate of economic growth of any country of the OECD,<br />
has only been possible because of the constructive cooperation<br />
of the trade union movement of this country. And it's<br />
appropriate that now arrangements should be arrived at whereby<br />
over the next two years productivity increases which occur in<br />
that time should be distributed in part to the workers of<br />
this country whose efforts have made our economic growth<br />
possible. </p>
<p>The third thing I should say about it, in terms of the<br />
misrepresentations that have bbeen put about superannuation,<br />
is that there is concern as to the way in which the<br />
superannuation scheme should be run. The Government has had<br />
serious discussions not only with the ACTU but with the<br />
representatives of business. We are developing guidelines.<br />
We have talked with those representatives about these generally,<br />
and in regard to the tax treatment and those guidelines,<br />
where necessary, will in turn be put into legislation so that<br />
not only will workers and employers be able to have confidence<br />
in the integrity of these schemes, but so will the community as<br />
a whole.<br />
If you look back at the history of the 100 years of the AWU,<br />
there is one consistent threat that you can find in terms of<br />
the things you have sought by way of improvements for those<br />
that you represent. That one consistent thing is that it has<br />
always been said about what you thought was appropriate<br />
gradually to improve the conditions of your members either<br />
could not be afforded, it wasn't the right time, or it was<br />
going to bring disaster.<br />
It is right that the trade union movement should be required<br />
to have regard for the economic circumstances of the time and<br />
there is no trade union movement in the world today which has<br />
more constructively and cooperatively been prepared to have<br />
that regard. But we say as a Government that it is appropriate<br />
that in the next two years ahead of us this benefit, now<br />
enjoyed predominantly by the relatively more affluent in the<br />
workforce, should in this coordinated and responsible way be<br />
extended to the rest of the workforce. I have said that it is<br />
a matter of great pride for me now that I can come to you as<br />
you celebrate your 100 years, as you look back on so many<br />
barren years in terms of our non-occupancy of the Treasury<br />
ventures, as a Labor Prime Minister and report to you on what<br />
is now nearly three years of very considerable achievements.<br />
I repeat that that achievement the most outstanding feature<br />
of which is the creation in the five months ahead of schedule<br />
of over half a million new jobs has only been possible<br />
because the people of Australia, through their great organisations,<br />
have responded to our call for cooperation and constructive<br />
conciliation. And foremost of course in that has been the<br />
trade union movement.<br />
And the AWU has been so important within that framework because<br />
of the call that I made to the people of Australia, on your<br />
behalf, for cooperation and conciliation. I hope in its small<br />
way that as well as being a glimpse of our future in Australia<br />
there is a glimpse of the future founded on an understanding<br />
of the past. Because I knew from studying the history of our<br />
great Labor movement in this country, particularly the sort<br />
of commitment that you Union has had to the processes of<br />
conciliation, that that approach could work. And your Union<br />
is entitled to draw much pride from the fact that it's your<br />
experience, it's your commitment to that principle which has<br />
been part of enabling us to get a vision of where this country<br />
can go in the future. </p>
<p>And as you've now finished your first 100 years and you look<br />
to that next 100 years I firmly' believe that those great<br />
principles of those early leaders which they enunciated, and<br />
which were embraced by the membership of this Union, will<br />
clearly serve you in the years ahead and serve this country as<br />
well as they have in the past. Because we must, like those<br />
early leaders of the AWU, ourselves attempt to get that glimpse<br />
of the future. What is the sort of contextgoing to be within<br />
which your Union, our Government are going to be operating. We<br />
know that it's going to be a more complex, more competitive,<br />
tougher environment, but one of great opportunities. There is<br />
no country in the world better placed to meet those challenges,<br />
to grasp those opportunities thanAustralia.<br />
We are uniquely blessed with resources. We have a great people<br />
and we have a commitment to decent processes and the resolution<br />
of conflicts. So as you look back with pride from those 100<br />
years, as you remember the way in which your founders tried to<br />
glimpse the future and were successful and were to produce<br />
such results, I hope that you will join with us in Government in<br />
similarly trying to understand what that future's going to be.<br />
Try with us to apply those principles to which I have referred<br />
and I believe that if we do that we are going to be able to<br />
hand on to those who come after us a great country, a great<br />
opportunity and a more equitable distribution of wealth within<br />
it.<br />
Let me conclude by saying this: that because I and my colleagues<br />
in Government are so conscious of the achievements of this great<br />
organisation; because we understand that you have in part become<br />
an intrinsic element of this nation; that you've become part<br />
of its tradition; that you've served its people so well; we<br />
want to identify with you in this your centenary year. I<br />
therefore have pleasure in announcing my Government will provide<br />
financial assistance in support of up to $ 10,000 for specific<br />
projects being planned by the AWU during 1986.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, I again congratulate this great<br />
organisation on its achievements and I wish you and those that<br />
you will be serving well in the'next 100 years. </p>
