PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 25 DECEMBER 1978<br />
INTERN4ATIONAL YEAR OF THE CHILD<br />
The General Assembly of the United Nations has proclaimed 1979<br />
as International Year of the Child. In the past we have had<br />
international Years devoted to geophysical research and to the<br />
problems and the position of women.<br />
In these " Years" world nations seek to focus international effort<br />
in an area where advances can or should be made in the interests of<br />
mankind generally. The International Year of the Child will<br />
direct attention throughout the world to the needs and problems<br />
of children, their welfare and their opportunities.<br />
Australia is a land of sunshine and prosperity, of beaches and<br />
playing fields, traditionally " a great place to bring up kids."<br />
But even in this fortunate country, there are still some children<br />
who cannot make the most of these opportunities. Some live in<br />
isolated areas. Others have severe handicaps or difficulty in<br />
settling into Australia because of cultural or language<br />
differences. There are also those children who despite our efforts,<br />
still live in poor family or community circumstances. The<br />
International Year of the Child will focus attention particularly<br />
on these children.<br />
1979 has been designated Year of the Child at a time when society<br />
throughout the world is undergoing new strains. We should<br />
see 1979 as a time to reinforce and support the family in its<br />
central role in the development of children.<br />
As pressures and problems develop in our society, we all have a<br />
responsibility to face them with courage and honesty. It is<br />
essential that our education provides children with the confidence<br />
and the ability to develop and mature in an often uncaring<br />
and intolerant world. We must constantly make sure that our<br />
child care services are directed with a real feeling of compassion<br />
and respect for the special needs of individual children.<br />
In Australia the role of voluntary organisations has been a<br />
significant one for they can provide the kind of compassion<br />
and concern that Governments can never match. Parents, voluntary<br />
organisations, governments, must direct our efforts to dealing<br />
with problems quickly as they become identified.<br />
The theme of the International Year of the Child in Australia is<br />
" Care." Through our own individual actions, through Governments,<br />
voluntary organisations, private enterprise, trade unions and<br />
other community groups we can all join together to ensure the theme<br />
of ' care' is fulfilled. / 2<br />

<p>2.,<br />
As a specific measure of support at the launching of this<br />
International Year of the Child, the Federal Government has<br />
decided to allocate $ 1 million to assist in the establishment<br />
of the Child Accident Prevention Foundation of Australia.<br />
This is a trust being established by surgeons, businessmen, and<br />
conmmunity leaders to assist in the coordination of research into<br />
child accidents and their prevention and to educate the<br />
community on child accident prevention.<br />
I believe such a Foundation can do a great deal to focus national<br />
attention on our alarmingly high rate of child accidents, with<br />
their high costs in human and financial terms. Accidents cause<br />
untold misery to children and their families.<br />
My Government will assist with the establishment of the Foundation<br />
by allocating $ 1 million on the understanding that the first<br />
$ 500,000 will be paid immediately and the second $ 500,000<br />
at a later date, and subject to the Foundation gaining State<br />
Government support.<br />
I am sure that this Foundation will receive the wholehearted<br />
support of all Governments and the community. To prevent<br />
some of the human suffering and the cost to the family and<br />
community caused by childhood accidents is, I believe, a<br />
most worthy cause to pursue in the International Year of the Child. </p>
