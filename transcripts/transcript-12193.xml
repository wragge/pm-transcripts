    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce funding of $79,500 for the Brisbane West Youth Partnership, a community drug prevention project working among young people in western Brisbane.</p>
<p>The project will be run by Drug-Arm in conjunction with local schools including Brigidine College, Indooroopilly High, Kenmore High and Brisbane Boys College. The project leaders will build a partnership with community groups and individuals within the local community to prevent illicit drug use.</p>
<p>The project will have three components:</p>
<p>ú        A Youth Roundtable will be established to bring young people together to raise awareness and discuss issues in relation to combating illicit drugs.</p>
<p>ú        Youth Action Teams will be formed in local areas for the purpose of fostering young leaders within the community who will develop practical strategies aimed at preventing drug use in their local area, and finding positive answers to local problems.</p>
<p>ú        Community Youth Forums assisting young people will be held, with a focus on achieving a greater understanding of the issues and problems faced by young people.</p>
<p>The project will involve young people in the training of peer leaders and adult mentors who will drive the initiatives.</p>
<p>The project is funded under the Community Partnerships Initiative, which is an important component of the government's Tough on Drugs Strategy, and another example of the social coalition at work to address difficult issues in the community.</p>
<p>The Community Partnerships Initiative began in 1997 and has marked Australia as a world leader in encouraging responses that involve the whole community working together to solve drug problems. By working in partnership community organisations, schools, committed individuals and governments can be more effective in fighting drug abuse.</p>
<p>I commend Drug-Arm and each of the partners in this project for their work in this difficult area.</p>

<p>BRIEFING ON COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM: DRUG-ARM, THE INDOOROOPILLY &amp; KENMORE STATE HIGH SCHOOLS, BRIGIDINE COLLEGE &amp; BRISBANE BOYS COLLEGE.</p>
<p>1:        BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>This Community Partnership Program brings together two State High Schools, a Private Boys College and a Catholic Girls College together with DRUG-ARM a community alcohol and other drug agency. This community-focussed intervention draws together a broad mix of young people. The young people participating in this Community Partnership Program will be from the three school systems in Queensland, - State, Independent and Catholic education systems - as well as young people who are outside of or excluded from the school system. </p>
<p>The Community Partnership Program will empower a very broad mix of young people. This program will help young people develop an understanding of the issues from another young person's perspective and will encourage all participants in this program to work to develop prevention strategies to help reduce the uptake and harm associated with illicit drug use. </p>
<p>This project builds upon successful youth programs developed and implemented by DRUG-ARM at Bundamba State High School in Ipswich during 2000, as well as work with the youth committee from Indooroopilly State High School. This youth committee is focussing on crime prevention strategies for young people specifically during their leisure hours between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Monday to Friday. </p>
<p>1.1        Local Youth Survey.</p>
<p>DRUG-ARM interviewed 200 young people in the western suburbs of Brisbane and a number of issues were identified. : A brief overview of the results of this survey are:<br />
ù        Twenty-six percent of the young people reported being in a fight over the last month.<br />
ù        Fourteen percent indicated that they had shop lifted in the last month.<br />
ù        Twenty-four percent of the young people reported using drugs in the last month. .<br />
ù        Six percent reported that they had sold drugs in the last month.<br />
ù        Thirty percent reported 'wagging' school in the last week.<br />
ù        Thirty-three percent reported getting drunk in the last week.<br />
ù        Fourteen percent reported having engaged in unsafe sex. </p>

<p>2.2        Youth Round Table </p>
<p>The Youth Round Table will empower this diverse mix of young people from the Western Suburbs of Brisbane to come together to discuss issues involving the use of illicit drugs in the area. This Youth Round Table will also identify youth risk factors within the community and develop strategies to prevent the uptake of illicit drug use as well as strategies to reduce the overall harm associated with illicit drug use. The strength of this Youth Round Table will be the broad cross section of young people who will participate in this Youth Round Table. The participants attending this Youth Round Table will represent:</p>

ú        young people who are unemployed;<br />

<p>2.3        Youth Action Teams</p>
<p>These Youth Action Teams will be formed in the local areas where the Community Youth Forums will be developed within budget guidelines. The Youth Action Teams will empower this broad mix of young people through encouraging them to accept leadership roles associated with the Community Youth Forums, which are an integral part of this project. The empowering of the young people in these Youth Action Teams will consist of the following strategies:<br />

These forums will develop greater understanding and empathy between young people living in western Brisbane. </p>
