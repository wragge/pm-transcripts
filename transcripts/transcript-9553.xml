PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
RETIREMENT OF THE HON ALAN GRIFFITHS MP<br />
Alan Griffiths made a significant and valuable contribution to the Labor<br />
Government, to the Cabinet, and to Parliament during his service as the<br />
Member for Maribyrnong since 1983.<br />
During his period as a Minister and senior member of the Cabinet, Alan<br />
Griffiths worked tirelessly towards the development of good public policy,<br />
especially in the areas of forest policy, oil and gas development, tourism,<br />
and industry policy.<br />
As he has acknowledged today, the allegations which led to his resignation<br />
from the Ministry caused damage to his political reputation. It has always<br />
been my expectation and hope that the current inquiry into those matters will<br />
clear Alan Griffiths of any wrongdoing.<br />
Alan Griffiths would have had sufficient support among his Parliamentary<br />
colleagues to return to the Ministry in due course. I would certainly have<br />
welcomed his return to Cabinet.<br />
Now that Alan Griffiths has taken a personal decision to retire from<br />
Parliament at the next election, I congratulate him on his contribution to<br />
public life, and wish him well in his new career.<br />
