FOR PRESS 7 AUGUST 1978<br />
DEATH OF POPE PAUL<br />
All Australians will wish to join with me in expressing deep<br />
regret on the death of His Holiness Pope Paul VI. The world<br />
has lost a great religious leader and statesman.<br />
Under his Papacy the Roman Catholic Church has continued to<br />
play a major spiritual role in the world and has been a<br />
driving force for the betterment of the lives of many underprivileged<br />
people.<br />
Pope Paul himself strove tirelessly for world peace and for<br />
higher ideals in the conduct of world affairs. He took up<br />
office late in life but this did not stop him from travelling<br />
widely in the service of the Church. Australians remember<br />
with particular pleasure his visit here in 1970.<br />
I was greatly privileged to call on Pope Paul in May last<br />
year. </p>
