    <content><![CDATA[<p>Janette and I will be travelling to the United States to take up the invitation of the President and Mrs Bush to visit their ranch at Crawford, Texas, on   2-3 May.</p>
<p>I also plan to travel to New York for discussions with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, followed by talks in London with Prime Minister Blair and senior British ministers.</p>
<p>I look forward to discussing with President Bush and Prime Minister Blair progress in the coalition's military efforts to secure Iraq, the country's humanitarian and rehabilitation needs, the effective and early transition to an Iraqi administration, and the final elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>There will also be an opportunity to discuss other security and economic issues of international and bilateral concern.</p>
<p>Talks with the UN Secretary-General will focus on how best to involve the broader international community in Iraq's rehabilitation, and the important role the UN should play in that endeavour.</p>
