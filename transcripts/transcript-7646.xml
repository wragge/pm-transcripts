PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
REMARKS BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
THE HON R J L HAWnE AC MP<br />
AUSTRALIAN WAR NENORIAL<br />
VILLERS-BRETONNEUX SUNDAY 18 JUNE 1989<br />
Citizens of France, fellow Australians<br />
The great Napoleon said:<br />
" It is geography alone which decides the policy of<br />
nations".<br />
No nation understands the meaning of this better than France<br />
in this century.<br />
And no place in Europe has seen its results in history more<br />
than the Somme.<br />
Yet, for all its truth, this memorial to Australians who<br />
died fifteen thousand miles from home bears witness that<br />
there are other truths about the spirit of man which<br />
transcend the mere facts of geography.<br />
For why, we must ask ourselves, did so many thousands of<br />
yrntuv Australiana volunteor and lot uo rmao bor that they<br />
were all volunteers to come to fight, so many of them to<br />
die in these foreign fields, so far from home?<br />
The memorials to be found in every city and township around<br />
Australia most far less imposing than this very often<br />
bear the inscription: For King, God and Country. But their<br />
own diaries and letters home give a dirrerent emphasis.<br />
Some oxpress the spirit of adventure.<br />
Rut thpir mnrt eonstant them. one atrenqghonod by the<br />
sufferings of the war is the characteristically Australian<br />
one of mateship expressing, indeed, that ideal of<br />
" fraternite" enshrined by the French Revolution, but,<br />
containing a meaning at once more simple and more subtle,<br />
and one which is uniquely Australian. </p>
<p>Yet, whatever the motives and ideals of indiv iduals, they<br />
came to serve a greater cause, greater perhaps than most of<br />
them realised, or, with their typical Australian diffidence<br />
about their own importance, would have acknowledged or<br />
articulated. The remarkable impression made by these young Australians<br />
was expressed by Prime Minister Clemenceau when he addressed<br />
them in the field in July 1918 after the series of battles<br />
which had saved Amienas and turned the tide of the last drive<br />
upon Paris:<br />
" When the Australians came to France, the French people<br />
expected a great deal of them... but we did not know<br />
that from the very beginning you would astonish the<br />
whole Continent. I shall go back tomorrow and say to my<br />
countrymen I have seen the Australians. I have looked<br />
into their faces. I know these men will fight alongside<br />
of us again, until the cause f or which we are all<br />
fighting is safe, for us and for our children".<br />
Yet the very generation of French men and women and<br />
Australians, of whom Clemenceau spoke, were to face another<br />
and even more terrible ordeal barely twenty years later.<br />
We do not come to these consecrated fields today, to glorify<br />
war. And in no sense does it glorify war to honour the sacrifice<br />
made by those who fought in these wars as vs may regard it<br />
now the long civil war of Europe.<br />
Yet citizens of France, fellow Australians<br />
I ask you to consider with me this great point: that today<br />
we stand on the threshold of a more hopeful era for the<br />
peace, human rights and fundamental unity of Europe<br />
better-founded, more strongly grounded, than at any time in<br />
the past 75 years since the Great War the first World War<br />
began.<br />
It will take much courage and resolution on the part of many<br />
to cross that threshold.<br />
The courage and resolution of those we honour today was of a<br />
different order, facing a different kind of challenge.<br />
Yet it is a great truth that the challenges of peace often<br />
require as much courage as the challenges of war. </p>
