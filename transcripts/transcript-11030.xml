<p>  Well, anything you want to ask me before I go off to this beautiful mountain</p>
<p>   retreat, or it's not a mountain retreat, it's a beautiful country retreat.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  How has the CHOGM sessions been going this morning, Sir? Any developments?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, largely a focus this morning on the international economic outlook,</p>
<p>   the importance of making certain that globalisation takes people along with</p>
<p>   it. There's a general recognition that globalisation is a fact of life but</p>
<p>   there's an understandable concern on the part of the less developed countries</p>
<p>   that the benefits of globalisation are not going to be spread around evenly.</p>
<p>   And that is something that all of us have got to be sensitive towards. Our</p>
<p>   view very strongly is that the Seattle World Trade Round must go ahead to</p>
<p>   produce a comprehensive further relaxation particularly in the area of agriculture.</p>
<p>   But I can understand and sympathise with the concern of the less developed</p>
<p>   countries that the benefits of globalisation are not always apparent. And</p>
<p>   that puts an obligation on all of those more developed countries and very</p>
<p>   developed countries such as Australia to cooperate in the processes of explaining</p>
<p>   and understanding the benefits. And that's one of the reasons why we launched</p>
<p>   an initiative at the Edinburgh conference two years ago. And I'll be making</p>
<p>   a couple of announcements tomorrow at the final session that will underline</p>
<p>   our desire to help the less developed countries improve their governance</p>
<p>   and generally to have a better understanding of the benefits of more liberalised</p>
<p>   trade not only for them but for the whole world.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Do you think that that concern by the less developed countries about the</p>
<p>   impact of globalisation will hinder your chances of getting some sort of</p>
<p>   clear statement from CHOGM about the need for a new trade round?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Oh, I don't think there will be any doubt that there will be a statement</p>
<p>   of general support for the new trade round. A grouping as diverse as the</p>
<p>   Commonwealth is bound to produce a range of views on how far you should</p>
<p>   go in particular directions but I am sure there'll be a general support</p>
<p>   for a successful outcome out of the World Trade Organisation. We really</p>
<p>   don't have any option. Globalisation is with us, it's a fact of life. Nobody</p>
<p>   has an option of saying, well, I won't take globalisation, I'll take something</p>
<p>   else because there isn't anything else. It's the paradigm under which the</p>
<p>   world operates now and we can't avoid it. It's a question of understanding</p>
<p>   it and it's a question of every community in its own way making certain</p>
<p>   that it's citizens understand and that where we can we even out the bumps</p>
<p>   and we soften the blow whilst continuing to go forward.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, is it beneficial for Australia that the new secretary-general</p>
<p>   is from our part of the world?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Is that..</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr McKinnon.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes, but what was the first bit you said?</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Well, is it beneficial to Australia?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Oh, look, I know Don McKinnon well, I think he'll do a very good job. But</p>
<p>   I don't look at these things in terms of regional prejudice. He was the</p>
<p>   person who Australia supported. I think Chief Anyaoku has done a wonderful</p>
<p>   job. He, of course, defeated an Australian for the job 10 years ago but</p>
<p>   I think he has done an excellent job and I think Mr McKinnon will. I don't</p>
<p>   think it matters where the person comes from. As I said last night, one</p>
<p>   of the great advantages of the Commonwealth from our point of view is that</p>
<p>   it gives us an engagement with Africa and this part of the world, the whole</p>
<p>   African continent, and that we wouldn't otherwise have because absent some</p>
<p>   of the sporting links, and they are limited largely but not totally to South</p>
<p>   Africa, we don't have a lot of links with this part of the world. And I</p>
<p>   have found the window into the African mind that this conference has provided</p>
<p>   is one of the more important and one of the more beneficial aspects of the</p>
<p>   meeting.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, on trade, do you think that it is now harder to make progress</p>
<p>   on liberalising trade than it was a few years ago and did you make your</p>
<p>   full contribution on trade today in the debate or is that still to come?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Oh, my greater contribution on that will be at the retreat. I think that's</p>
<p>   the time for the less set piece contributions and the more important exchanges.</p>
<p>   Do I think it's harder now? I think it's always hard because communities</p>
<p>   are, by nature, more protectionist than they are open trade because there's</p>
<p>   a natural human belief that if you put up a barrier you protect what you</p>
<p>   have without realising that what you have can disappear in other ways unless</p>
<p>   you make yourself more competitive. It's always difficult to sell the benefits</p>
<p>   of trade liberalisation but I would say to the Australian public that one</p>
<p>   the reasons why our economy is so strong now is that it is more open. If</p>
<p>   we had not been as competitive and as efficient over the last couple of</p>
<p>   years we would have succumbed to the Asian economic downturn. It was the</p>
<p>   opening up of our economy through a succession of measures by governments</p>
<p>   on both sides of politics and especially the measures we've taken over the</p>
<p>   last few years that have gave us the strength to withstand the tide.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, what will your priorities be and what do you hope to achieve</p>
<p>   out of the retreat?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, an emphasis on the human values part of the Commonwealth. I mean,</p>
<p>   the Commonwealth has proved itself to be quite a protector of the common</p>
<p>   values system of a democratic approach to life. I think it's played a significant</p>
<p>   role. I mean, years ago in relation to South Africa, more recently in relation</p>
<p>   to Nigeria and now in relation to Pakistan, of asserting the importance</p>
<p>   of the democratic process for all citizens irrespective of their colour</p>
<p>   and I think that's important. I think the other value of the retreat is</p>
<p>   to talk perhaps in a more relaxed, direct, pragmatic fashion about some</p>
<p>   of the trade challenges and perhaps to assuage some of those who are more</p>
<p>   sceptical about the value of a more open trading system.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Do you have any bilateral meetings with anybody in particular..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I expect to have a number of bilaterals. I have had a number of bilateral</p>
<p>   meetings already. I mean, the nature of these conferences you suddenly find</p>
<p>   yourself having a bilateral meeting over dinner or over a cup of tea and</p>
<p>   I had a very lengthy discussion last night about politics and so forth with</p>
<p>   Mr Blair and I've had some with Mr Chretien. And I am having a formal meeting</p>
<p>   with the Indian Prime Minister this afternoon and I'll be having a formal</p>
<p>   bilateral meeting with the President of South Africa who I hope will visit</p>
<p>   Australia in the next couple of years. I'll be renewing an invitation to</p>
<p>   him to do so next year. He did come as Vice-President in 1995 but he'd be</p>
<p>   very welcome in our country. And I had a bilateral meeting yesterday with</p>
<p>   Mr Goh Chok Tong, the Prime Minister of Singapore and I expect to accumulate</p>
<p>   even more bilaterals as the day wears on.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, has CHOGM talked about what to do about Pakistan or are you expecting</p>
<p>   that to be..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes, yes. We had quite a lengthy discussion about Pakistan. I think people</p>
<p>   would like to see an acceptance within Pakistan and the need to return to</p>
<p>   democracy. I don't think people want to do anything of precipitate but there</p>
<p>   are naturally great concerns about what has occurred and the pressure of</p>
<p>   Commonwealth opinion will play some part in conditioning the attitude of</p>
<p>   people within Pakistan.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  [Inaudible] some parts of the Commonwealth to apply sanctions? You told</p>
<p>   us yesterday you were.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Not at the moment, there's no really strong push to apply economic sanctions,</p>
<p>   no.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  So is the suspension likely to continue?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, the suspension continues, yes.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  You mentioned the democratic issue proposed at George..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Yesterday you seemed to be quite cautious about applying.giving new powers</p>
<p>   to the Council of Ministers to pursue these issues, are you moving towards.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, I am just always.you have to understand that one of the traditions of</p>
<p>   the Commonwealth is that it doesn't seek in a supranational way to impose</p>
<p>   its decisions on individual members, it seeks to use persuasion and example</p>
<p>   and cajolery but it doesn't set itself up as a supranational body.</p>
