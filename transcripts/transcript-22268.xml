    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was shocked and saddened to learn of the sudden death of Richard Carleton today.</p>
<p>He was a great television personality who had a varied and highly successful career in journalism. Quite literally, he brought us news from the four corners of the globe.</p>
<p>  He was an aggressive and uncompromising interviewer who strove for fairness and accuracy.</p>
<p>Richard Carleton always understood the need to keep the viewing audience entertained</p>
<p>I was interviewed by Richard Carleton on numerous occasions during his time with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Nine Network. He was highly professional, innovative and engaging as an interviewer.</p>
<p>Most people will remember Richard Carleton for his work in recent years with the Nine Network's 60 Minutes program. Previously, however, he made a great impact on Federal politics as a compere with the ABC's current affairs programs This Day Tonight and the Carleton Walsh Report.</p>
<p>He will be greatly missed from Australian television.</p>
<p>I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife Sharon, his three children and colleagues.</p>
