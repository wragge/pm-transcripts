    <content><![CDATA[<p>I’m delighted to welcome the appointment of Michael McCormack as the new leader of the National Party and Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Michael McCormack is a strong advocate for rural Australia. He will continue his party’s long tradition of standing up for farmers and all those living in regional Australia.</p>
<p>The Liberal Party has been in coalition with the Nationals for more than seventy years and our enduring and successful political partnership will continue under Michael’s leadership of the National Party.</p>
<p>I congratulate Michael McCormack on his appointment and I look forward to working closely with him and the entire Coalition team in the interests of all Australians.</p>
