    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am very pleased to announce that the Prime Minister of Turkey, His Excellency Mr Recep Tayyip Erdo#287;an, will make an official visit to Australia from 7-11 December as a guest of the Australian Government.</p>
<p>This is the first visit to Australia by a Turkish Prime Minister, and follows my very successful visit to Turkey in April this year.  In the past year, Australia's relations with Turkey have strengthened and expanded considerably.  Our longstanding and close ties, which have traditionally centred on the important, shared history of Gallipoli, are more than ever being reinforced by closer cooperation on security and strategic issues, economic development and investment, education and cultural exchange and in supporting people-to-people contacts.</p>
<p>  I look forward to discussing with Prime Minister Erdo#287;an our mutual interest in enhancing cooperation on a range of bilateral issues, including ongoing protection and preservation of the ANZAC area and on exploring new opportunities to expand trade and investment links.  It will also provide an opportunity for further discussion on a range of international issues, including ongoing efforts to combat international terrorism and provide support for reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Turkey's interests in further engagement in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
