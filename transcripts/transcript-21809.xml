    <content><![CDATA[<p>I announce changes to the Ministry which I propose to recommend to His Excellency the Governor General. They are consequent upon the resignation of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon John Anderson MP.</p>
<p>The new leader of the National Party, the Hon Mark Vaile MP, will become Deputy Prime Minister while remaining Minister for Trade.</p>
<p>The Hon Warren Truss MP will become Minister for Transport and Regional Services.  The Hon Peter McGauran MP is promoted to Cabinet as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.  He will remain Deputy Leader of the House.  The Hon John Cobb MP is promoted to the Ministry as Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs.</p>
<p>Senator Sandy Macdonald will be the new Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade.</p>
<p>At present, the Hon Bruce Billson is Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Following Senator Macdonald's promotion, Mr Billson will now become Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs as well as remaining Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>These changes take effect on Wednesday 6 July 2005, which is the date of the swearing in at Government House, Canberra.  A revised Ministry list will be issued at that time.</p>
<p>I take the opportunity to again thank the outgoing Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, John Anderson, for his contribution.  He has served the Government very well within the specific portfolio areas of primary industries and transport and regional services.  He has been a strong supporter of the Coalition and contributed significantly to the stability and unity of the Government.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with Mark Vaile and his team in pursuing policies and programmes that benefit all of the Australian people.</p>
