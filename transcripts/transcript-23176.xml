    <content><![CDATA[<p>I congratulate Michael Clarke and the Australian team on sealing an emphatic Ashes series victory in Perth today.</p>
<p>The Ashes hold a special place in Australia’s sporting history and today, Australian sports fans have had an early Christmas present.</p>
<p>The Australian team should be proud of their extraordinary success.</p>
<p>I also congratulate the team’s coaches, support staff and the players’ families because their success on the field is due in large part to the support they receive off the field.</p>
<p>While the Ashes outcome is now decided, the series goes on and I wish both teams well for the remaining Tests in Melbourne and Sydney.</p>
