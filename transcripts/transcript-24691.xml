    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia will reduce greenhouse gas emissions so they are 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.</p>
<p>This is a responsible and achievable target. It is comparable to the targets of other developed countries and allows our economy and jobs to grow strongly.</p>
<p>The target builds on Australia’s excellent record. We met and beat our first Kyoto target and expect to do the same in 2020 through the Government’s Direct Action plan.</p>
<p>Australia is making a strong and credible contribution to the international effort to tackle climate change.</p>
<p>Our emissions intensity and emissions per person will fall further than other developed economies.</p>
<p>Australia’s emissions per person will decline by at least 50 per cent between 2005 and 2030, while emissions per unit of GDP will fall by 64 per cent.</p>
<p>The Government will meet Australia’s 2030 target through policies built on the successful Direct Action plan, in particular the Emissions Reduction Fund and its Safeguard Mechanism.</p>
<p>The Emissions Reduction Fund is already achieving significant emissions reductions – with 47 million tonnes contracted at less than $14 per tonne in the first auction alone.</p>
<p>We are on our way to planting 20 million trees by 2020 and have rolled out more than 350 Green Army projects around the country.</p>
<p>There are many additional ways we can reduce emissions, while saving businesses and households money and lifting productivity.</p>
<p>We will prioritise a National Energy Productivity Plan, working with State and Territory governments to improve energy productivity by up to 40 per cent by 2030.</p>
<p>We will develop a National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy.</p>
<p>The Government will review Australia’s emissions reduction policies in detail in 2017-18, in close consultation with businesses and the community.</p>
<p>We are committed to tackling climate change without a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme that will hike up power bills for families, pensioners and businesses.</p>
<p>At 26-28 per cent, Australia’s target gets the right balance between our economic and environmental responsibilities.</p>
<p>We have a strong and credible target to take to Paris and Australia will work with our international partners to achieve a strong agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in December.</p>
