TRANSCRIPT OF UNEDITED INTERVIEW WITH TOM O'BYRNE, TAS TV,<br />
14 APRIL 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
O'BYRNE: Well Mr Hawke, you've ruled out an election this<br />
year. Have you ruled that election out simply because of<br />
the vote of cynicism about this wage and tax package?<br />
PM: Voted it out for the very simple reason that it's not<br />
due in any sense. The fact of the matter is that it was a<br />
year ago that I promised the people of Australia, Tom, that<br />
there would be tax cuts from July 1, 1989, provided that<br />
there'd been wage restraint in 88/ 89 and that we got<br />
agreement for wage restraint into 89/ 90. Now the wage<br />
restraint has been exercised by Australians to their great<br />
credit. We've got an agreement for similar restraint for<br />
next year so what I'm doing is delivering a promise I made<br />
twelve months ago. That's why we've got the the tax cuts<br />
now, it had nothing to do with an election. The situation<br />
would have been of course, Tom, if I hadn't now delivered<br />
the tax cuts people would say ' Mr Hawke you promised them,<br />
you've broken your promise'. I'm delivering the promise.<br />
There's only one person that's introduced the question of an<br />
early election and that's John Howard. of course he's just<br />
trying to divert attention from the substance of what we've<br />
delivered. O'BYRNE: But do you recognise that there is still deep vote<br />
of cynicism out in the community?<br />
PM: I don't think it's cynicism. I think that the voters<br />
feel that they're having a pretty tough time and in some<br />
respects they are because of high interest rates. I don't<br />
avoid that fact. But I understand that when the tax cuts go<br />
into the pockets as they will from July 1, with the delivery<br />
of the benefits in regard to children and other family<br />
allowances, like the dependent spouse rebate, that they will<br />
appreciate the benefit of what we've done and particularly,<br />
Tom, they will appreciate the fact that this is being<br />
delivered in a way which is non inflationary, which is going<br />
to stop a wages outburst and that's good for the country.<br />
Both Paul Keating and I know that what we're doing is<br />
creating the situation within which, as time goes on, we<br />
will be able to see falling interest rates. It would be<br />
irresponsible to bring them down now. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
O'BYRNE: Well, housing prices aren't as bad in Tasmania as<br />
they are in Melbourne and Sydney, but still interest rates<br />
are at 16 percent. When do you believe they can start<br />
trending downwards?<br />
PM: Well I've said, Tom, before the end of this year. I<br />
don't make any immediate forecasts about what's going to<br />
happen today and tomorrow, because I've always resisted<br />
doing that, because if a Prime Minister says something about<br />
those sort of things it can affect the market of itself.<br />
But we need high interest rates at the moment now. I mean,<br />
I don't want them high, no politician in his right mind<br />
wants them high for a moment longer than necessary. But<br />
we've got to have them high now because we've got to reduce<br />
somewhat the height of economic activity. It's got to come<br />
back a bit so that we don't suck in so many imports.<br />
O'BYRNE: Well how long do we need them that high?<br />
PM: Well, that's going to depend upon how soon we see the<br />
evidence of some cooling off of the economy. I wonder, Tom,<br />
whether I could make the point, with your indulgence through<br />
this program, to your viewers to say that the way in which<br />
they can involve themselves in doing the best for the<br />
Australian economy is, now that these tax cuts, family<br />
allowances are coming through to the extent that they're<br />
saved and that they are spent, I would hope that they would<br />
hope that they would always try and spend them on the<br />
Australian made product if it's possible because what we've<br />
got to try and do, as I say, is to cut down on this high<br />
level of imports which is causing the problem.<br />
O'BYRNE: The Treasurer, in his statement, also mentioned<br />
that part of the burden would have to be borne by States, no<br />
doubt that's the Premiers Conference next month. Where in<br />
fact will those cuts take place?<br />
PM: Well, as to what within States they do, that's a matter<br />
for States but let me make this point. That the reason why<br />
the States have to play their part is that the whole package<br />
that we've brought in has got the two purposes. One of<br />
course is to give to people, Tom, the benefits that they<br />
need and deserve, but also it's done in a way which is going<br />
to reduce the level of wage increases. The States are going<br />
to benefit from that overall package that we've brought in<br />
to the extent that we lower the level of wage increases that<br />
we will, then the States get the benefit and they've got to<br />
play their part in it. But, as always, Tasmania will be<br />
looked at sympathetically as far as we're concerned. I<br />
notice, if I may say so Tom, that we're getting recently<br />
down there the sort of outburst we get from some Tasmanians<br />
at times, they don't understand the meaning of accuracy and<br />
the suggestion that in some of the things that we do in </p>
<p>-3-<br />
( PM cont): regards to our own capital outlays that we're<br />
not giving Tasmania its share. Now I'd just like to make<br />
the point on that Tom, that neither under this Government or<br />
under any previous Government, has Commonwealth own<br />
purposes, capital outlays, been regarded, nor should it be<br />
regarded, as a form of State assistance. Any Commonwealth<br />
Government has to make its decisions about its capital<br />
outlays in terms of what the needs and the priorities are.<br />
The fact is, of course, that with the, generally speaking,<br />
with the concentration of the population elsewhere that<br />
that's where most of the work will be done. It's not done<br />
on a political basis. Let me make it clear. For instance<br />
in this year, on a per capita basis, the largest<br />
Commonwealth own purpose capital outlays will be in the<br />
non-Labor State of New South Wales. I mean, that's the way<br />
it is.<br />
O'BYRNE: Well, some conservative governments, and<br />
particularly the Tasmanian Government in the past, has said<br />
that while the Federal Government takes the knife to the<br />
State Governments, they're not prepared to take the knife to<br />
their own Commonwealth spending.<br />
PM: Well, of course, that's absolutely untrue. The fact is<br />
that there has been a real reduction in Commonwealth outlays<br />
for the last three years. That's never happened before and<br />
that's what I've done with my colleagues. The last three<br />
years, and for the next one coming up, there will be a real<br />
reduction in Commonwealth outlays. It is the States that<br />
have been more profligate. The fact is that in terms of the<br />
public sector borrowing requirement we've got ours in a<br />
position where it's a considerable minus. We've cut right<br />
back. The States are above, it's only our surplus in this<br />
regard which has brought the public sector borrowing<br />
requirement to zero. Now, it is just another furphy that's<br />
put around by rather desperate conservative ministers like,<br />
I understand, and I regard it as remarkable, I hear that<br />
just recently down there some people in the Tasmanian<br />
Government have been saying that we've knocked off the<br />
commitment that I made before to Launceston to have the air<br />
traffic services staff facility put in at Launceston. We've<br />
done that. I did that, may I say, against a lot of<br />
opposition because there was a lot of pressure upon me to<br />
put that on the mainland. They've said there were the<br />
arguments were better to have it here in Canberra and I said<br />
' no, I believe that where we can, we've got to help<br />
Tasmania'. I've done that and what gratitude do I get for<br />
it from those in the Tasmanian Government? They seek to lie<br />
to the Tasmanian people and say I've taken that back.<br />
O'BRYNE: Well if we could just get back to the State<br />
reductions that the Treasurer was talking about a couple of<br />
days ago. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
O'BYRNE: If the Commonwealth goes ahead with those<br />
reductions to the States and the States, particularly<br />
Tasmania then imposes increased taxes and charges on the<br />
community, isn't that simply shifting the blame?<br />
PM: It's not a question of shifting the blame. What that<br />
question implies, Tom, is that there's no responsibility on<br />
State governments to exercise restraint, but all they can<br />
ever do is put up charges. Now, we've had to do it. I<br />
mean, when I came to office in ' 83 we had a deficit of the<br />
best part of $ 10 billion staring us in the face. Now I've<br />
turned that around into surplus and we've done that in large<br />
measure because we've cut back on programs, reassessed<br />
priorities and as far as taxation is concerned, successively<br />
reduced taxation. When we came in the top rate that we<br />
inherited from the conservatives was 60 cents and a bottom<br />
rate of 30. Now I've brought that down, the tops to 49,<br />
will be 47 from next January and the bottom rate from<br />
down to 21. So we've reduced taxation, we've broadened a<br />
base so that those who, under conservative governments,<br />
weren't paying their tax now pay it. Now the Tasmanian<br />
Government can't avoid the responsibility of being decent<br />
managers. They are bad economic managers and they can't<br />
dodge that conclusion.<br />
O'BYRNE: So over the past four or five years you still<br />
believe that the Tasmanian Government, the State Liberal<br />
Government, hasn't shouldered its national responsibility?<br />
PM: It hasn't. What Mr Gray does is just bleat. Bleats<br />
all the time and it's no accident that he has, in many<br />
respects, the worst economic statistics of any State. It's<br />
because he's an incompetent manager and you can't, no State<br />
can do that. I mean, we've set an example, we've reduced<br />
taxes and reduced them considerably from the conservative<br />
levels, we've looked at our own programs and where they can<br />
be amended they have been and we've got things going. Mr<br />
Gray just bleats and he's got to do better than that.<br />
O'BYRNE: Well, an issue still of great moment here in<br />
Tasmania is talk of a pulp mill in Tasmania.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
O'BYRNE: It's now switched from one pulp mill to two<br />
smaller mills. What would you prefer to see in Australia<br />
and particularly in Tasmania, one large project or smaller<br />
downstream processing<br />
PM: It's not a question of one large one or two smaller<br />
ones. Our position is quite simply this. I make the points<br />
in succession. Firstly we do want to see in Australia, Tom, </p>
<p>( PM cont): a situation where there is processing of our raw<br />
material because that is good for Australia. It's good in<br />
employment terms, it's good in balance of payment terms. So<br />
we want to see that. But secondly, you can't make<br />
generalisation about, for instance, pulp mills. In regard<br />
to the proposal that was put up, there was no way that I<br />
with my colleagues, finally studied the environmental<br />
implications of the Wesley Vale proposal, that that could go<br />
ahead in that form. We were not going to tolerate the<br />
pumping into the ocean there each day of 13 tonnes of these<br />
organic chlorines. Now that wasn't on. Now, if in fact,<br />
proposals can be put up whether it's for one large one or<br />
two smaller ones, which satisfy Tasmanians as well as the<br />
rest of Australia but particularly Tasmanians concerned<br />
about these environmental issues, then from our point of<br />
view, it will get our support. But I mean I was down there<br />
in Tasmania, as you know Tom, in the weeks before we finally<br />
made that decision. Now I was very much impressed by the<br />
broad range of concerns. It wasn't just a few environmental<br />
frenetics, if you like, I had representatives of farming<br />
organisations and so on. So I undertook that right across<br />
the spectrum there was a concern, a legitimate concern about<br />
these things and we share them. So the answer to your<br />
question is we want to see processing of our products but<br />
I'm not going to see mills or any other processes<br />
established in this country while I'm Prime Minister at any<br />
price because we've got a responsibility to this and to<br />
future generations.<br />
O'BYRNE: Right Premier I'm sorry, that was a Freudian<br />
slip<br />
PM: That's alright.<br />
O'BYRNE: Just a few<br />
PM: Robin wouldn't mind swapping I think.<br />
O'BYRNE: A few final, brief questions.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
O'BYRNE: Bruce Lloyd has ruled out resigning today. Does<br />
that disunity in the coalition ranks surprise you?<br />
PM: No it doesn't. I say that for these reasons. The<br />
National Party of course are frauds. They parade as part of<br />
the coalition which is concerned with free enterprise, but<br />
they are not. They are agrarian socialists. They want to<br />
in fact have the rest of the community totally propping them<br />
up with subsidy and with regulation which, according to<br />
their mistaken idea, will be better for farmers.<br />
Fortunately farmers have come to realise that that's a bad<br />
bet supporting them because what we are proposing will mean </p>
<p>-6-<br />
( PM cont): very, very considerable savings for the wheat<br />
farmers in this country. It will be more money into the<br />
pockets of wheat farmers. Now you have those frauds there<br />
and you have the Liberals who are the ones who are supposed<br />
to be the deregulators know that what we've suggested is<br />
right. They've got no doubt. I mean they don't argue that<br />
what we're saying is right, they've got to try and keep<br />
alive this shotgun wedding that they have with these<br />
agrarian frauds. Now there it's no surprise to me is my<br />
answer to your question.<br />
O'BYRNE: And on to one final question Prime Minister and a<br />
more personal question.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
O'BYRNE: The nation has seen the first photographs of your<br />
wife's facelift.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
O'BYRNE: At a personal level, what do you think of the<br />
facelift?<br />
PM: Well, let me say this. I thought before that she<br />
looked beautiful. I didn't feel that she needed it, but<br />
once Hazel felt that she wanted it, that was the beginning<br />
and the end of it for me because she has an entitlement to<br />
do what she feels is required. Now having said that, let me<br />
say that the result is beautiful.<br />
O'BYRNE: And do you think she's changed in any way?<br />
PM: She looks even more beautiful and even younger than she<br />
did before.<br />
O'BYRNE: Thanks very much Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: Thank you very much Tom.<br />
ends </p>
