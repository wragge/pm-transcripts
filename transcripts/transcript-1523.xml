STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
HAROLD HOLT, IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
14TH MARCH, 1967<br />
REFEREN DUM<br />
Both Houses of Parliament have now approved the<br />
bills containing the proposed laws to alter the Constitution. The bills<br />
were the Constitution Alteration ( Parliament) Bill and the Constitution<br />
Alteration ( Aboriginals) Bill.<br />
Under the provisions of the Constitution, a proposed<br />
law for an alteration of the Constitution must be submitted to the electors<br />
not less than two months, nor more than six months, after the proposals<br />
have been passed by both Houses.<br />
Before the proposals can be submitted to the electors,<br />
it will be necessary to distribute copies of the arguments for and against.<br />
To this end, the Referendum ( Constitution Alteration) Act provides that<br />
if, within four weeks of the passage of the proposed laws by both Houses,<br />
the arguments in favour of and against the proposed laws are forwarded to<br />
the Chief Electoral Officer, he is to print them and post a copy to each<br />
elector. The Government is presently arranging for the " Yes" case to be<br />
prepared and submitted to the Chief Electoral Officer in the normal way on<br />
behalf of those who voted for the proposals, and no doubt those who voted<br />
against the nexus proposal will be preparing the case against its adoption.<br />
I am glad to say that no vote was cast against the<br />
proposals relating to aborigines.<br />
In all the circumstances, the Government has decided<br />
that the Referendum should be held on 27th May, 1967. The Government<br />
will recommend to the Governor-General that the writ for the Referendum<br />
be issued on 28th April so that, in accordance with the Referendum<br />
( Constitution Alteration) Act, the Chief Electoral Officer may then proceed<br />
to distribute the pamphlet containing the " Yes" and " No" cases to electors<br />
in time for the Referendum. </p>
