ADDRESS TO THE AUSTRALIAN JAPAN RELATIONS SYMPOSIUM, CANBERRA<br />
It is a great pleasure to be here to open the 1977 Symposium on<br />
Australian Japan Relations. As one has come to expect the Symposium<br />
brir. gs together a distinguished group of Japanese and<br />
Australiarn speakers and participants. The attendance at-this<br />
year's symposium demonstrates the interest of a wide cross-section<br />
of the community in Australian Japan relations in general.<br />
The Symposium is a first rate example of the value of forums of this<br />
kind. They encourage discussion of all aspects of Australian Japanese<br />
relations. They enable contacts to be developed amongst many<br />
Australians, and between Australians and Japanese interested in the<br />
relations between our two countries.<br />
In an open democratic society such as we have, foreign relations<br />
are not and cannot be exclusively the product of Government<br />
action. They must be the joint creation of people and<br />
Government if they are to reflect the interests and aspirations<br />
of Australian society. No approach to other nations can possibly<br />
be effective unless it rests on a broad public support.<br />
The work of public and semi-public groups and institutions such<br />
as the Australia Japan Socicty, the Australia . Japan Business<br />
Cooperation Committee and the Centre for Continuing Education<br />
makes a vital contribution both to establishing priorities in<br />
Australian foreign relations and in reflecting and educating<br />
public opinion.<br />
In our first year of office this Government has given pre-eminence<br />
to our relations with Japan. As Prime Minister, my first visit<br />
to a major power and my first visit outside Oceania, was to<br />
Japan. The first visit by any Minister in my Government was a<br />
visit by Mr Anthony, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for<br />
National Resources, and Overseas Trade, to Japan.<br />
We have placed great weight on consolidating our relationship with Japa<br />
and inproving mutua understandinug so as to furt he r strengthen<br />
the links between us.<br />
Clearly the quality of the relations betwleen Australia and Japan<br />
is of enormous importance to both our countries.<br />
Japan is by far OL, largest trading partner, outranking the<br />
United States, and the European Economic Community, including<br />
Britain. In 1975/ 76 more than onc-third of a1] Il Austi-alian / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
exports went to Japan a higher proportion than went to<br />
the United States and the E. E. C. countries combined.<br />
As a source of imports, Japan is only slightly less important<br />
to Australia, standing second to the United States and<br />
accounting in 197S/ 76 for nearly one-fifth of Australian imports.<br />
The development of trade between our two countries in a comparatively<br />
short period of time has been nothing short of remarkable.<br />
It owes much to the vision of the men who twenty years ago<br />
signed the Commerce Agreement between our two nations.<br />
Since the Agreement was signed the trade between us has<br />
grown fifteen-fold. It is now the seventh largest trade flow in<br />
the world. The reason for this is plain. Our trade is<br />
complementary; Australia has become a major source of raw<br />
materials and food stuffs for Japan, and in return, Japan is<br />
a significant source of manufactured goods for Australia.<br />
It has been suggested, on occasion, that because of the importance<br />
of the Japanese market for Australian exports, and of Australia's<br />
natural resources for Japan, there is a substantial degree of<br />
dependence of both our countries on one another. A dependence<br />
that some people regard as being undesirable.<br />
It is my belief that such suggestions misconceive<br />
the benefit both our nations obtain frominternational<br />
trade. It is in both our interests for trade<br />
to be developed on the basis of the most efficient use of our<br />
resources. Australia hs long admired and through international trade benefitted<br />
from the Japanese capacity to grow at a faster rate than any<br />
other country in the Western world. Japan has both stimulated and<br />
benefitted from our primary and mining industries.<br />
While Japanese economic growth in the medium term is not expected<br />
to match the spectacular expansion of previous periods, the prospects<br />
are for significant growth which should provide ample opportunities<br />
for expansion of our bi-lateral trade.<br />
We believe Australia's interests are best served by a sustained growt<br />
in our export markets not a short term boom which would ignite<br />
inflationary pressures, and be followed by a down turn. C<br />
It is of prime importance that the major industrialised countries avo<br />
a resurgence of inflationary pressures. I understand that Japan, und<br />
the guidance of Prime Minister Fukuda, himself a distinguished<br />
economic administrator, has a similar approach.<br />
Japan is important to Australia not only for economic reasons.<br />
Japan is a major power in regional and indeed, in world politics.<br />
This is evident in the attention that Japan comnmands from the<br />
other great powers. They recognise the important role that Japan<br />
has to play in maintaining stability in Asia, and<br />
the influence which Japan can bring to bear on tneir policies<br />
and the outstanding rcs i lienlce tha't Japan has shown in<br />
international pol-itics-.4 </p>
<p>Japan has, however, firmly rejected not only the nuclear weapons<br />
option but any programme of major rearmament. This was<br />
emphasised yesterday by the Japanese Prime Minister.<br />
Japan, he said, relied for its safety and survival on the good<br />
fait'. a of other nations and the Japanese American alliance.<br />
While Australia and Japan trace their cultural inheritance through<br />
different lines, it is clear we have a great deal in common.<br />
We are both democratic, industrialised, island nations.<br />
We are both located in the<br />
Western Pacific and both have great interests in the peace and<br />
security of that region. We both have a special Treaty relationship<br />
with the United States. These common interests between our<br />
nations serve to strengthen our relationship. ' It has been my<br />
Government's concern in close cooperation with the Government of<br />
Japan to develop and further strengthen it by providing a<br />
framework within which our relations can achieve their full<br />
potential; by consolidating and giving new impetus to our<br />
economic relationship by recognising the mutual interests of<br />
both countries in being stable and reliable supp'liers and markets<br />
for one another; by creating the machinery and spirit -to deal<br />
with the strains and differences inseparable from hard bargaining<br />
of commercial matters; and by broadening our contacts in<br />
political, cultural and social areas as a means of promoting<br />
greater understanding between the peoples of our two countries<br />
and to complement and reinforce our economic relations.<br />
Both Australia and Japan hav'e taken important initiatives in<br />
these areas. In 1971, an Australian Japan Ministerial Committee<br />
was first proposed by the Japanese Minister for International Trade.<br />
For Australia, entering such an agreement was a unique undertaking.<br />
During my visit to Japan, the Japanese Prime Minister and I<br />
signed the Basic Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between our<br />
two countries. This was the first Treaty of its kind entered<br />
into by theAustralian Government. Signature of that Trea-: ty<br />
was preceded in February 1976 by ratification of the Australia<br />
Japan Cultural Agreement. In April 1976 we established, by<br />
Act of Parliament, the Australia Japan Foundation. This was<br />
an important step. Together with the cultural agreement, it<br />
represented a pronounced recognition of the need to broaden<br />
and deepen the relationship between the peoples of Australia<br />
and Japan.<br />
The cumulative effect of these steps and the joint efforts by<br />
the Australian and Japanese Governments was most evident in<br />
January this year, when the Australian Japan Ministerial Committee<br />
met for the fourth time. This meeting -at which Australia was<br />
represented by fLour Cabinet Ministers -was of the first<br />
importance both in terms of atmosphere and practical achiievement. 4 </p>
<p>y I note some of thesc achievements. Agreement was reached on<br />
the Australian beef quota. The Japanese Government indicated<br />
that it Would endeavour to ensure that imports of coal and<br />
iron ore from Australia during 1977 would be maintained at<br />
1976 levels. Agreement was reached on the extension of port<br />
access arrangements for Japanese tuna fishing boats.<br />
The Japanese side expressed appreciation of the new climate<br />
that has developed in Australia in the resources area, and<br />
commented favourably on the Government's overseas investment<br />
policy. Australia welcomed the intention of two senior Japanese<br />
missions one on investment and the other on energy matters<br />
to visit Australia early in 1977. On uranium the Japanese<br />
expressed full understanding of the Australian Government's<br />
dcison to await the second report of the Fox Committee.<br />
Agreement was reached to examine the possibility of reducing air<br />
fares between Australia and Japan in the interest of facilitating<br />
contacts between our two peoples. I am happy to draw<br />
particular attention to that initiative as it sets a sequel to<br />
discussion at this Symposium last year.<br />
Beyond these practical achievements, the Ministerial Meeting<br />
reflected,-however, an even more important outcome. It was the<br />
consensus of all participants in the discussions that the<br />
relationship as a whole has been put on a new level and its<br />
importance and potential were now more fully understood. This was<br />
as apparent in the directness and openness of discussions<br />
as it was in the spirit of mutual understanding that prevailed.<br />
Despite the progress already achieved, my Government remains<br />
determined totake a long term view of our relations with Japan<br />
and to ensure that the future is as certain and as productive<br />
as it can possibly be made. Our determination will be evident<br />
from the Government's decision to establish an Ad Hoc Working<br />
Committee on Australia Japan Relations. The Committee has<br />
been charged with two responsibilities: making recommendations<br />
on the machinery that might be necessary to enhance relations<br />
between Australia and Japan; and suggesting measures to avoid<br />
or alleviate areas of possible difficulty in these relations over<br />
the next several years. The persons from outside the Government<br />
whom I have invited to joint the Committee will, because of their<br />
knowledge and experience, be able to make a significant<br />
contribution to the Government's understanding of the direction<br />
of that long term relationship. The Committee is to consult widely<br />
within the Australian community and it will liaise closely with<br />
the Australia Japan Foundation.<br />
Despite the closeness of the ties and interests of our two nations,<br />
there is still a great deal to be done to build a broad<br />
understanding between our two peoples and foster mutual awareness.<br />
I believe that the Australia Japan Foundation will play a<br />
major part in the development of this understanding.-<br />
The Foundation whose members were appointed in 1976, aIjms to<br />
achieve these goals by encouraging people to people contacts, and<br />
by promoting study, and other activities to give the people of<br />
both countries greater access to one another's culture and society.<br />
The Foundation has an unusually broad field to work in. It is<br />
not initended to be a body limite-d to what people conventionall ' y<br />
consider cultural exchange. It i~ s concerned with the<br />
development of a multif aceted and wide-ranging relationship<br />
between the peoples of our two nations. </p>
<p>Cultural life not only exists in the art galleries, the concert<br />
halls, or even the trading table. The Foundation's programmes<br />
reflect this. So far its initiatives include: the establishment<br />
of a one-year intensive Japanese language course at the A. N. U.<br />
geared directly to those already in business, government, or the<br />
professions; the encouragement of studies of the various barriers<br />
to communication between the peoples of our two countries;<br />
and the provision of financial support to assist people in each<br />
country with common professions or other interests, to make<br />
contact with each other. It also has its own travel grant<br />
schene whose first recipients will travel to Japan in the<br />
next month. The Foundation's work is designed to get beyond<br />
the exotic and the unusual to those things in which many<br />
people in both countries can find immediate common ground.<br />
I was pleas. ed to notice a considerable diversity of interests<br />
in the first group of Australians sponsored by the Foundation<br />
to visit Japan shortly: a housewife concerned with child care<br />
schemes; a technical catering teacher; an agricultural<br />
scientist; an art teacher; a musician; a marriage counsellor;<br />
and a prisons administrator. This diversity of interests indicates<br />
that the Foundation is on the right track. A new, and in many ways,<br />
challenging track in the area of cultural exchange.<br />
Work will not be completed overnight, of course, but the attention<br />
paid to culturall matters should do much to complement<br />
conunerci. al rel ations and enrich our own relationshin.<br />
So far today I have mainly concentrated on the bi-laterial aspects<br />
of the Australia Japan relationship. But that relationship<br />
cannot exist in a vacuum, nor do I consider that it should<br />
be an exclusive one. It is a relationship which even as it<br />
bring:; Australia and Japan the mutual benefits of prosperity<br />
and progress, must also be so designed as to lend momentum<br />
to the economic advancement and cooperation of the countries<br />
in Asia and the Pacific as a whole.<br />
As the two major economically developed democracies in our<br />
region, we have a major responsibility in this respect. One which<br />
ultimately requires us to interpret our relationship in the wider<br />
context of global processes and problems. This includes<br />
participation in the dialogue between developed and developing<br />
countries on a new international economic order, which has<br />
become a major issue in economic relations. There are some who believe<br />
that the resolution to the economic problems faced by many less<br />
developed countries lies in fundamentally changing<br />
the international economic system. Australia believes<br />
that there is a . need for change in policies between nations<br />
and sometimes for significant change. To the extent that the call<br />
for a new international economic order is a call for practical<br />
and viable changes in economic policies affecting the international<br />
system, it should have the support of all nations.<br />
But -the Japanese example should make us hesitate to try to effect a<br />
fundamental change in the system itself. The rapid growth of<br />
the Japanese economy over the last 25 years during which time<br />
real per capita income in Japan has increased no less than / 6 </p>
<p>five-fold is an outstanding example of what can be achieved<br />
in a mrarket-orientated system. Japan is, of course, somewhat<br />
differently placed than Australia.. We remain a net importer<br />
of capital. while Japan is moving towards the undertaking of<br />
a traditional capital exporter role that many of the Western<br />
European countries played in earlier years. Unlike Australia,<br />
Japan will need to continue to run a surplus on current accounts.<br />
Only by this means can Japan play the role of a net exporter<br />
of capital.<br />
The Australian Government consequently believes that moves<br />
to force Japan to adjust its external poi~ icies, so as to produce<br />
an external balanced or deficit position, are misplaced.<br />
S ' uch moves would be inconsistent with the long term development<br />
needs, not only of Australia but also of those less developed<br />
countries that need continuing injections of development capital<br />
if they are to lift their standards of living to more acceptable<br />
levels. Australia believes that making improvements within the<br />
essential framework of the existing international eco-nomic system<br />
holds out the greatest hope for the economic progress of all nations.'<br />
Both Austrailia and Japan, each in our separate way, will seek<br />
in their trading in other arrangements to take positive<br />
steps to help meet the needs of countries less strongly placed<br />
than our own.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I accepted this invitation with great<br />
pleasure. In concluding, I express the appreciation which I, and<br />
believe most Australians, feel for the far-sighted imagination<br />
and dedication which bodies like the Australian Japan Socicty and<br />
the Australian Japan Business Cooperation Committee have shown<br />
in pursuing the task of bringing Australia and Japan together.<br />
To an audience well versed in Australia Japan relationships,<br />
as yourselves, there is no need for-me to specify the<br />
substantial work which has already been made in this Symposium<br />
and those dedicated bodies which are its sponsors.<br />
It is sufficient to say that the Australian Japan Businesses<br />
Cooperation Committee together with the commercial interests<br />
which are its individual members, have been largely responsible<br />
for generating within the space of 25 years, the spectacular<br />
trading relationship which we have with Japan. It has been the<br />
work of the Australia Japan Society to complement the growth of<br />
that trading relationship by creating the public interest<br />
in, and information, on Japan, and to give our mutual relations new<br />
breadth and depth expanding * beyond the purely commercial.<br />
The relationship that now exists between Australia and Japan<br />
is a tribute to your efforts as much as it is to those of<br />
Government. In approaching and managing an area of broader<br />
and even stronger relations with Japan, we look to you for . the<br />
same contribution of leadership and inspiration that you have provide(<br />
in the pas-t.<br />
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is with very great pleasure<br />
that I declare the Fif1-th Australia Japan Relationship Symposium, open<br />
