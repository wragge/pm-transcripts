PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 2 FEBRUARY 1988<br />
The Government has decided in principle to appoint three<br />
additional Commissioners to assist the Royal Commission into<br />
Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, following a request by<br />
Commissioner Muirhead.<br />
The additional Commissioners will operate as separate<br />
fact-finding Royal Commissions charged with responsibility<br />
for investigating the circumstances of particular Aboriginal<br />
deaths. Their work will be co-ordinated by Commissioner<br />
Muirhead who will retain responsibility for the final<br />
overall recommendations.<br />
I am writing to each of the Premiers and the Chief Minister<br />
of the Northern Territory to consult with them concerning<br />
these revised arrangements and the names of possible new<br />
Commissioners. These measures follow a significant increase in the number<br />
of deaths identified since the Royal Commission was set up.<br />
The increase raised the prospect of a much more protracted<br />
inquiry than would be acceptable when such important issues<br />
of justice and human rights are under scrutiny.<br />
The appointment of additional Commissioners should allow the<br />
Commission to complete its work in a timely manner and with<br />
a proper degree of care and thoroughness. 004254 I </p>
