PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA3 April 1984<br />
I successfully moved at today's Caucus meeting that the Cabinet<br />
be expanded to 15 to allow for the reinstatement of the<br />
Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr West.<br />
Mr West resigned from the Cabinet on 3 November 1983 on the<br />
grounds that he could not support a particular decision of<br />
the Cabinet.<br />
I have now been given an unequivocal commitment from Mr West<br />
that he will in future observe the principle of Cabinet<br />
solidarity.<br />
The Government welcomes the opportunity to again have the<br />
services of Mr West in the Cabinet. </p>
