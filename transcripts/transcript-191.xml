SSPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. iR. G<br />
MENZIESA HARVAD UNI 16 TH JUNE 16I0<br />
Sir and ladies and gentlemen:<br />
I have had a very, very exciting 22 hours in E: arvar.,<br />
I arrived at 5 o'clock last evering. I came into this famous<br />
yard. I lit a cigar, hoping that there was no local rule<br />
against it, and I occupied any one of the fourteen thouosnd<br />
seats available to me. I had an idea that when there were<br />
other people on the platform, there would be a biggor audience.<br />
But at any rate I sat in a seat and I meditated on . life; and<br />
studied Harvard for the first time, I blush to say. I saw<br />
respectable looking gentlemon, like myself, walking along with<br />
red bands on their hats marked with such symbols as " 1935~:.<br />
( Applause) The mystic puzzled a little, because I noticed,<br />
as a rule, what I took to be a wife who also was " 19351; and<br />
then a quite grown up daughter also branded '" 1935 ( Laughter)<br />
and a somewhat disorderly small child of about 5 years old<br />
( Laughter) also marked " 1935" ( Laughter). A little reflection,<br />
of course, gave me the clue, but it was puzzling for a " tart.<br />
And then I thought I would like to sec the Undergraduate<br />
on the spot. I had made up my mind that all undergraduates<br />
in the United States of America would not only have<br />
the characteristic uhtidiness of undergraduates, but that they<br />
would have nothing to do with any old world customs if they<br />
were here. And so I sat and comfortably thought, "' ell,<br />
there's one thing: this not being Groat Britain, I ,: ill not<br />
see any umbrellas carried". Well my ear was pleasantly<br />
attacked by the choir which was then rehearsing and which I<br />
regret to say started rehearsing and woke me up in the<br />
President's house this morning. ( Laughter) But they had been<br />
rehearsing. And they came out. Do you know that every third<br />
man carried an umbrella? ( Laughter) Oh!' What a disillusionment<br />
this was for me. The only thing that really delighted me was to<br />
discover that no one was so old fashioned as to carry he<br />
umbrella by the handle, by the crook, or whatever you rmay call<br />
it: it was usually seized a little lower down as if for<br />
purposes of self-defence. This delightful reconciliation of<br />
the spirit of the pionjor and the habits of the old world movel<br />
me very greatly. ( Laughter, Applause)<br />
And then of course this morning, when : oung Mr, Davis,<br />
who I should think is destined to be the best known :-an in the<br />
world inside five years, gave his Latin oration do you<br />
remembor? so superbly done that L understood most of it<br />
myself. ( Laughter) Full of a vein of irony which, in my days<br />
as an undergraduate, was reserved e---lusively for classical<br />
Professors. All they had to do tas . o look as if they were<br />
being funny and, so far as we were concerned, they ' woer funny.<br />
( Laughter) Well, Sir, Igive you those somewhat irrelev. nt and<br />
impertinent observations, because really this is a great day for<br />
me. I've had the great pleasure of having a lot to do,<br />
particularly in recent years, with the development of<br />
Universities in Australia and as I am a graduate of ,. n<br />
Australian Univursity nysolf, an honour paid by this most<br />
famous body is one that I appreciate quite beyond tl. puwcr of<br />
words to express. And of course to the political loader, ilrost a chronic<br />
political leader of the Australian nation, it means oven nore,<br />
Because on this day, through you, the most powerful nation in<br />
the world offers a courtesy, so co speak, to one of -he<br />
smallest nations in the world, weak. in numbors, ut strong in<br />
will, a nation whose future is bound up with yours nC. the<br />
body of whose intollectual? and spiritual charactur forr.:. s part<br />
of a great common tradition. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Sir, you have honoured me by asking no to speak. I<br />
would not want to acknowledge that honour by offering you the<br />
coammonplaces of that rather escapist piety of sentiment which<br />
characterises after-dinner oratory. You know what I mean?<br />
Most of you have suffered from it: I have practised it.<br />
( Laughter) And because I want to avoid that I don't want to<br />
say to you that " wo are cousins" because, quite demonstrably,<br />
we're not: we get on much too well for that. I won't say<br />
that we have the same kind of parliamentary democracy, because<br />
we have not" we in Australia live in a constant blur of goodnatured<br />
bowildormont at some of the " oddities" of your<br />
constitutional processes. And in case you think that that is<br />
a gross impertinence, I want to say that that is a bewildernent<br />
that I have found is shared by most of the Americans I moot.<br />
( Laughter) But, Sir, we do have great things in common; so<br />
great that if we avoid insanity in the English-speaking world,<br />
we shall always be friends and allies. ( Applause) To preserve<br />
this friendship, we are to face up to our tasks, accept our<br />
responsibilities with some favour, and I hope with some<br />
affection, but certainly without fear.<br />
Today, Sir, fear is our greatest eneny. So far, a<br />
century of the nost brilliant scientific achievement, of growing<br />
political consciousness, of material advanconent, has been<br />
marred by fear, suspicion, and actual hatred, to a degree without<br />
modern precedent. Many have developed a fear of life and its probloes,<br />
so that if I may say so with respect the psychiatrists<br />
flourish like the green bay tree. Many of us have learned to<br />
fear our own unruly impulses and the individuality which is our<br />
divine gift, and we therefore seek the protection of conformity.<br />
If we seek to " Keep up with the Joneses", it is mostly because<br />
we want to be like the Joneses and avoid the accusation of being<br />
odd, or different, or conspicuous. We fear to be unpopular.<br />
When we do something we regard as generous or helpful, we are<br />
dismayed to find so much ingratitude. On quite a few occasions<br />
I have been asked by prominent Americans why the superb<br />
American international -enerosity of recent years has so<br />
frequently been received in other countries with either covert<br />
resentment or open hostility. My reply has always been that the<br />
world power of the British in the 19th century may well have<br />
inspired respect, but certainly it did not purchase popularity.<br />
Power exacts its own reactions. Friendship cannot be bought,<br />
and groat power however benevolently exercised will always<br />
produce the most puzzling resentments. " Why should this rich<br />
nation, why should this rich man, have more than I have?".<br />
Sir, we are frequently invited to fear the potential<br />
enemy. In destructive technology, we find him so clever, and we<br />
forget that in the constructive sciences the contribution of the<br />
free world is so infinitely greater than his. ( Applause) We<br />
rejoice in power; but we sometimes fear and misunderstand the<br />
responsibilities it brings. We are tempted to withdraw into<br />
ourselves, to enjoy the fruits of our own labour rnd let the<br />
world go by. And this, Sir, brings no to the point that I<br />
want to r. ake today,<br />
Tennyson is now, I believe, unfashionable among the<br />
younger intellectuals. But he once wrote a few lines that have<br />
been much misunderstood co-ionplace lines, if you like:<br />
" io sailed wherever ship could sail,<br />
We founded many a mighty state;<br />
Pray God our greatness may not fail<br />
For craven fear of being great" </p>
<p>.4 0 3.<br />
Now, Sir, that wasn't just tub-thumping; that wasn't just an<br />
old-fashioned forn of imperialism. It was brilliantly<br />
perceptivo. It saw quite clearly that greatness imposes<br />
responsibilities: that power which is morely enjoyod is a<br />
nenace, but that power with responsibility can be, and will be,<br />
the salvation of the w: orld.<br />
The great free powers are on trial today: none more<br />
so than the greatest of then, the United States of Am; erica.<br />
The way in which they survive this trial will depend upon how<br />
they rise to the splendid, but awful responsibility of power:<br />
how bravely they guard the inner liberties of nan; how utterly<br />
they cast out fear; how clearly their light shines before men;<br />
how far they keep the feeling of adventure, and avoid the<br />
dofonsivenoss of riches.<br />
Sir, a desire for power soeems natural in mankind.<br />
Among politicians and I an one it is, I believe regarded as<br />
endoeic, the desire for powor. But the great men and the great<br />
nations are those who, having achieved it, do not weakly recoil<br />
from it, afraid of leadership, or rejoice in power for its own<br />
sake and for the precarious comforts that it may bring.<br />
The twentieth century r. ight so well have been the<br />
golden century of civilisation. It has been bedevilled by the<br />
lovers of power without responsibility. ' Jo don't denounce the<br />
inflaous menory of Hitler because he gained and exercised power.<br />
Much greater mnn than he gained and exercised power to defeat<br />
and destroy him. Hitler is infamous, as are the other i: alrv'lent<br />
dictators of our tine, because with all his power he had no<br />
smallest sense of responsibility for the true good of men and<br />
wo. men. He obtained power, and boca. e a monster.<br />
Today, the communist threat is the result of another<br />
and terrible misconception, or denial, of the duties of power.<br />
If the men who cone and go because they do appear to come and<br />
go as the controllers of the Soviet Union were content to<br />
pursue their philosophy in their own land, because they believed<br />
that their systom, so alien to us, was the one to give peace and<br />
security and social justice and happiness to their own people,<br />
we night well wonder, but we would stand aside, on the principle<br />
of " live and let live". " ut when we see them as an aggrossive<br />
force, aiming at the bending of hundreds of millions of free<br />
people to their own will, we know that we are again witnossing<br />
the search for power without responsibility.<br />
What is the answer to power without responsibility?<br />
It isn't power sirplicitor, though people are prepared to<br />
believe that it is. " Get tough" has an appeal, particularly if<br />
the slogan-makers and I suppose there might be some here if<br />
not in my own country, before the year is out can stigmatise<br />
those who wish to ngotiate as " appeasers". In a world such as<br />
we live in, power is essential, but it is not all. The t-uth,<br />
self-evident though it may be, is that the only answer to power<br />
without responsibility is power with responsibility. ( Applause)<br />
Sir, it isn't sufficient to say that this is the truth though<br />
I believe it is. As usual, it is necessary to say what it means.<br />
It is a matter of famous record, referred to by my<br />
distinguished colloeaue M. Spaak just now, that in this placo<br />
that very great nan George Marshall announced the greatest and<br />
most generous aid plan in history. But greater oven than its<br />
generosity was its intelligence. It was only a great power that<br />
could give great aid to others. But the giving of that aid was<br />
an acknowledgment of the responsibility that goes with power;<br />
a responsibility based on an understanding of international facts<br />
and of the true foundations of peace. </p>
<p>4.<br />
Here we have,. I believe, great scopo for the<br />
inagination. We know that on our side, the groatost of all<br />
wars was fought for froodom. But this did not have a puroly<br />
selfish connotation. It didn't iean froodom for those who<br />
already enjoyed it alone: for aeorica-ns and British and<br />
Frenchaon and Australians and Canadians, and so on. No. It<br />
meant freedon for all mon, including those hundreds of nillions<br />
in countries Loving towards independence, for whom self-governnmont<br />
is the greatest of all adventuros. WJhon you, in your groat<br />
way, and we in our simall -ay, tax ourselves you ' Laxoursolvos;<br />
we tax ourselves to help new nations, we are not being just<br />
noro or less comfortably oenorous, and fooeeling good about it:<br />
we are recognising the one-ness of humanity, and the profound<br />
responsibilities of powor and of possessions. It isn't<br />
philanthropy, but wisdon, to accept the task of guiding and<br />
helping other nations and peoples so that they may acquire, not<br />
only the institutions of frocLdom, but, iuclh mnore importantly,<br />
those rising standards of living and of thought without which<br />
free institutions will wither and 1ocay. True, we oay<br />
properly adnit that we wish to restrain the expansive ., ove of<br />
communisn. To this end, as in the case of the South-East .' sian<br />
Treaty we enter into cilitary onga onemnts and nake nilitary<br />
preparations. But, Sir, these will fail, unless, in those new<br />
nations which stand at risk, oconomic growth is stimulated, the<br />
development of the individual is pursued, and the comi: unist<br />
powers find thornsolvos increasingly 2onfronted by coUnunitis<br />
resolved to accept no slavery of the nind.<br />
In the perforrance of our responsibilities there is no<br />
time to. be lost. Since 1945 the hitherto littlo-known now world<br />
moves rapidly to a series of now n] 7ionhoods. Look at Africa,<br />
until recently a nest of colonies, where a score of now nations<br />
are com. ing to birth. Are we to be just kind to theor, giving to<br />
them that iwhich we fooeel we can comfortably afford, the " crumbs<br />
from the rich nan's table", or will we see in their o; orgenco a<br />
groat challonge to the wisdonm of western civilisation? Isn't<br />
there a wise self-interest to serve, net a narrow selfishness for<br />
self-protection, but a self-interest based on the understanding<br />
that our own frodomn is depondent-upon the froodom of others:<br />
that we can't have peace anL prosperity for ourselves alone,<br />
Sir, i:; ay I venture to remind you of one of the great<br />
econonic phonomona of our time? It is that, nationally speaking,<br />
the gap between the " haves" and the " have nots" is becomiing<br />
greater. I believe that this isn't true inside our own<br />
boundaries, where social responsibilities, expressed in trms of<br />
schenos and social welfare and social justice, have led to a<br />
narrowing of the gap betwooeen riches and poverty. High and<br />
graduated taxation is, within reasonable limits and subject to<br />
logiti te grunblings, that we all understand so well, accopted<br />
More and noro, in our own place, you in your country, I in<br />
mine carry the burden of being " our brother's keepor".<br />
But intornationally this, in spite of groat bfforts,<br />
is not by any means true. Je live in an ag of amazing<br />
technological growth. Aided by the most superb technical skill,<br />
the groat industrial countries nake progress in almost, what I<br />
night describe, as a non-nathematical fellow, gooT: otrical<br />
progression. The luxury of yesterday becomes the i-_ ass-produced<br />
conronplaco of toi: norrow. And so, nationally speaking, and in<br />
the words of the old song, " the rich et richer". You will<br />
remi: obor the second line for yourselves.<br />
But, Sir, what of the new nations, the rcl. tivoly poor<br />
nations, with sketchy or primitive industries, with little<br />
technical skill and with, as yet, slmall facility for increasing<br />
it? At best, their rate of mnatorial i-mprovemoent is arithretic. l </p>
<p>C not geometric. So far from catching up they are, in relative<br />
terms, falling behind.<br />
Now, Sir, this consideration quite clear as it<br />
soees to me must give us all furiously to think. In face of<br />
it, we can't rationally decide to do loss; we must do all that<br />
we can, even though it means wo do a little less for ourselves.<br />
" Charity begins at hom. e" they say. I've heard it many times in<br />
the course of ny political life. It is a cynical proverb, and<br />
in this world it is a shockingly false one.<br />
I never come into the United States without fooling<br />
something of the pulse and drama of your strength and your<br />
growth. Your resources are so boundless; your productive<br />
skill so boundless; your optimism ( that groat driving force)<br />
so all-pervasive. More than any other country in the world,<br />
you could, in an economic sense, go nearer to living to<br />
yourselves and by yourselves. And yet your high destiny is to<br />
use your strength to give light and leading and encourageoment<br />
to the world. The measure of how you fulfil that destiny will,<br />
if you will permit me with all humility to say it, be the<br />
measure of your greatness. You have accepted the greatest<br />
responsibilities in human history. In this famous placeo, the<br />
father ( or mother) of so many who have served in high places<br />
and have, in high or humble places, given leadership in the<br />
fields of the mind and the spirit, may I pray that year by<br />
year there will be more and more of your graduates who will<br />
persuade their fellow-citizens, not only here but right around<br />
the world, that just as rights are loss significant than duties,<br />
so is strength admirable only for the resoonsibilities it<br />
accepts and discharges. The free world, and that great area<br />
of the world which lon. fs to be free, looks to you with<br />
gratitude, but also with hope,<br />
It is an honour, Sir, to be enrolled in your<br />
brotherhood, and a rare privilege to be allowed to speak to you,<br />
not so much for myself, as for Australia, your young but<br />
determined friend. ( Applause) </p>
