    <content><![CDATA[<p>FOR PRESS P. M. No. 75/ 1965<br />LORD W1ARDEN OF THE CINQ~ UE PORTS<br />Statement by the-Prime Minister, Sir Robert M. emi, ies<br />I was deli,-hted to accept this appointment which<br />I feel is as much a tribute to Australia as it is to me personally.<br />The selection of an Australian for a position so steeped in<br />British tradition and history is a real demonstration of the<br />family bonds of the British Commonwealth. I am most conscious<br />of-the honour that has been done to me and it is a particular<br />privilege to assume the appointment in the footsteps of Sir Winston<br />Churchill. I can assure the citizens of the Cinque Ports that<br />I : ill at all times do my best to uphold the finest traditions of<br />this post. The appointment nowadays is purely honorary and<br />no longer involves any judicial or administrative duties.<br />However, I understand that the citizens of the Cinque Ports do<br />like their Lord 61._ rden to visit them from time to time and I will<br />endeavour to resume the practice of the Lord Warden residing'in<br />the area for at least a week each year. I hope to be able to<br />manage this while in Britain for the other matters that will no<br />doubt take me there from time to time.<br />As for the official installation at Dover Caistle,<br />no plans have yet been made for this. However, I hope the<br />installation might be able to take place whlen affairs next take<br />me to Britain.<br />CANBERRA, 7th October, 1965<br />GENERAL BACKGROUND: The following is an extract from " Heritage of<br />Kent", Autumn 1943, describing the functions of the Lord<br />Warden v . e I</p>
<p>2.<br />" At the head of the Cinque. Ports stands the Lord<br />Warden. The holder, in former days, held a dual position,<br />as a Minister of the Crown through whom the Royal<br />commands to the Barons of the Ports were conveyed, and<br />also as the representative of the Confederation, pledged<br />to maintain all the franchises, liberties, customs and<br />usages of the Five Ports.<br />" The appointment includes the offices of Constable<br />of Dover Castle, and Admiral of the Cinque Ports, and<br />carries with it the right of residence at Walmer Castle,<br />of flying a distinctive flag, and of precedence next to<br />Royalty in any of the Cinque Ports or their Liberties.<br />At sea, the Lord W-irden is entitled to a salute of 19<br />guns and to hoist the standard of the Cinque Ports within<br />the limits of his Admiralty.<br />" For the purpose of his formal installation in office,<br />the Lord Wrden still exercises his right of summoning<br />the Ports to Dover Castle and of presiding at their<br />ancient Court of Shepway. On such occasions he wears the<br />full dress uniform of his office specially designed to<br />indicate his high naval and military rank, and has borne<br />before him, instead of a mace, the silver oar of his<br />Admiralty jurisdiction." The Cinoue Ports are an association of maritime<br />towns in the South-East'of England exercising a jurisdiction<br />dating from about the time of the Norian concuests. Five<br />principal ports constituting the body are Hasting s, Romney, Hythe,<br />Dover and Sandwich. It is interesting to note that the office of the<br />Lord Warden includes the right to " Wreck", i. e. flotsam, jetsam,<br />lagan, tc., found within the limits of jurisdiction of the<br />Cinque Ports. There are some excepted areas within the jurisdiction<br />where the rights of certain Lords of LManors ( about twenty<br />in all) have been admitted by the Crown in respect of unclaimed<br />wreck washed ashore. The Office also includes the right to *" Fishes<br />Royal" within the same limits, but these are probably more of a<br />liability than an asset in that they usually have to be buried,<br />and the cost of the burial is a charge to be borne by the Lord<br />Warden. On balance, the proceeds of the wreck, etc. more than<br />cover the cost of burials but the amounts, in normal times, are<br />small, averaging about Å 12 a year.<br />* Fishes Rcyal are whales, porpoises sturgeon, and the like, and<br />were granted to the Lord Warden in 1707.</p>
