    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Â 9 October 1983</strong></p>
<p>The National Party has threatened the future of the QueenslandÂ sugar industry with its support for the growing of sugar in theÂ Ord River region.</p>
<p>Any plan to grow sugar on the Ord could only damage the QueenslandÂ sugar industry and the Federal Government is firmly opposed to theÂ concept.</p>
<p>However, the Member for Dawson, Mr Braithwaite, and OppositionÂ Spokesman on Northern Development, is firmly on the recordÂ as a supporter of Ord sugar development.</p>
<p>In the West Australian Daily News ofÂ 2 August he is reported as havingÂ said that sugar can be grown successfully in the Ord River damÂ region and that growers should get an export licence.</p>
<p>In the West Australian the next day, he is reported as having said thatÂ the Australian sugar industry needed to expand, Queensland hadÂ to acknowledge that Kununurra must fit into that situation.</p>
<p>My Government is totally opposed to growing sugar on the Ord,Â because it can only harm the industry in Queensland.</p>
<p>If Mr Braithwaite was. looking after the sugar industry in thisÂ State, as he is supposed to be, then he should be opposed to anyÂ sugar growing on the Ord.</p>
<p>The Federal Government will also not be implementing the disastrousÂ recommendations contained in the IAC's draft report on the sugarÂ industry.</p>
<p>Our position could not be stronger or clearer.Â </p>
<p>Both my colleague, Primary Industry Minister John Kerin, and I haveÂ repeatedly given that assurance to the sugar industry.</p>
<p>But it appears that the National Party is determined toÂ misrepresent the Government's position.</p>
<p>The Queensland Primary IndustryÂ Minister Â and Mr Braithwaite have bothÂ falsely claimed that we are going to implement the recommendationsÂ contained in that draft report.</p>
<p>I demand that in the interests of the great sugar industry inÂ this State that both of theseÂ men cease their scaremongering andÂ miscepresentations.</p>
<p>They will only succeed in hurting the sugar industry which theyÂ are supposed to support and represent if they keep it up.</p>
<p>I am also most concerned at the way in which the National PartyÂ is behaving towards the sugar industry.</p>
<p>The Federal Government has provided $ 10 million to assist growersÂ in difficulties which is being administered by. the QueenslandÂ Government. But I understand that only about $ 2 million of that money has gone<br />to farmers in need.</p>
<p>My colleague, John Kerin, will be asking the Queensland GovernmentÂ to keep me fully informed of the situation and asking theÂ Queensland Government to ensure that any grower making anÂ application gets sympathetic consideration.</p>
<p>The Fraser/ Anthony Government did nothing for the . sugar industryÂ except to commission an IAC report which, fortunately, came to us.</p>
