PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY TUE PRIME MINISTEKt THE HON J. KEATING, M. P.,<br />
STATE DINNER. DUBLIN CASTLE, DUBLIN, IRELAND<br />
SUNDAY 19 SEPTEMBER, 1993<br />
Taoiseach, Mrs Reynolds, Kathileen, our distinguished Ambassador from Australia,<br />
Terry McCarthy and Margaret McCarthy, distinguished leaders of Ireland, both past<br />
and present and distinguished ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Thank you very much for the warm welcome, Taoiseach, and the warm welcome<br />
particularly from all of you. Its always said in Australia that the warmest welcome<br />
you can have around the world is in Ireland and at first hand Annita and I had tha<br />
experience this evening. We appreciate very much that warmth, the generosity, the<br />
sincerity and the fact that so mnany of you have done us the honour in coming this<br />
evening. It's a great pleasure for someone of my background to come to Ireland in any<br />
capacity, but to come here as Prime Minister is even a more singular honour than<br />
simply coming as a visitor, because one comes representing the Australian nation and<br />
one comes with the thought in one's mind of those great traditions and shared values<br />
which we in Australia have with you the people of Ireland.<br />
So Itfs great to be here and no better day than the grand final of the Gaelic football,<br />
because just an hour off the plane I was trvatc4 to a pageant and It's the only football<br />
stadium in the world, certainly the exception from Australia, where a politician is<br />
warmly received. And I know I was beside such a popular fellow and that's why I got<br />
the claps. I'm sure if I wasn't with you, Albert, there would have been no clapping at<br />
all, but the fkct is that is was warm; and when the band broke to the strains of<br />
' Waltzing Matilda' and the crowd sang the words of that famous Austraan son&amp;, I<br />
couldn't help but be deeply touched by that great sense of kinship betwee us and that<br />
understanding of Australian values,<br />
Those Australians values: support for the underdog, had me barracking for Deny all<br />
through the day. And they are strong right to the e4d and that last ten or fifteen<br />
minutes showed their great athletic form, but rm a member of an Australian rules<br />
football club, which has also been the unedoS club. A great working class club, one<br />
of the great sports clubs of Australia the Collingwood Football Club. And it had<br />
not won a premiership since 1958 and being a Sydneysider of course Fin not a<br />
member of a Melbourne football club. but I joined bcase I could only join the<br />
underdogs club and the year I joined they won the flag. They won the premiership.<br />

So there are great similarities between Gaelic football and Aussie rules, as the<br />
Taoiseach said. No doubt we're sharing a gene pool, somewhere, because the<br />
contortions and the athleticismn and the bounce and the ball control and all of the other<br />
things which are so common , which we saw there today are conmon to both games,<br />
so there's no doubt, for certain, the Irish have influenced Australian sport in terms of<br />
Aussie Rules. So it was a great game, it was more than a game, it was a pagean. To<br />
we all those flags and that great roar when the two teamns came onto the field and then<br />
the singing and the enormous spontaneity of support for Deny at the conclusion was<br />
indeed something to behold. And as visitors, Annita and I were charmed that as an<br />
introduction to this official visit to Ireland we were able to go to Croke Park today.<br />
Thank you Albet, thank you one and all for that rare privilege.<br />
Australia, of course, has an unbroken relationship with Ireland going back a couple of<br />
hundred years but as the Taoiseach said, we are very different countries now.<br />
Australia is very much a multicultural country While, I suppose, Ireland is probably a<br />
more a monocultural country. But, that said, for all the differences the shared values<br />
and traditions and history ame still there. The Taoiseach took you through those<br />
statistics about Irish inumigation to Australia, there is no doubt that Australia is the<br />
most Irish of all countries outside of Ireland. It mightnt have had the absolute highest<br />
numbers of people fronm Ireland settling in Australia, but it had the highest proportion<br />
of any group settling anywhere in the world. And it~ s had an enormous influence on<br />
Australia, on my country, at every stage of its history, and because the Irish arrived<br />
early, relatively early In Austrlias history, in my case, my family in the midnineteenth<br />
century, in the 1950s, we had the opportunity of having an impact on the<br />
whole society.<br />
So, rather arriving as of late, as was the cam with Irish immigration, say to the United<br />
States, the Irish permeated all Australian culture. As the Taoiseach said, through the<br />
professions, through teaching, through education, through literature. through the axts<br />
pervasively across our country, and of course most obviously in politics where talking<br />
18 required of course the Irish have always done so well. They're great talkers, they're<br />
passionate talkers, passionate people, and so where there were not natual barriers,<br />
where there was an open opportuity, of course, their great sense of passion and skill<br />
excelled. And so. the Impact was so broad across the whole nation and across the<br />
wholo society and as a consequence the Labor Party was in many respects influenced<br />
by the great democratic traditions of Ireland, that sens of nationhood, folklore,<br />
egalitarian values, values of fainess and values of decency.<br />
And if's had a greater impact on my Party than any ideology, any ideology that we<br />
could speak of, and there were many of them in the late ineteenth century and they<br />
had a big impact in the twentieth century, but none greater than that Irish sense of<br />
nation, folklore, egalitarianism, what we now call In Australia the ' fair go'. One of our<br />
former leaders, Arthur CalwclL, who led the Labor Party, said the Irish were among<br />
the great colonisers of the world, but not among the imperialists, the exploiters or the<br />
conquerors. And that, of course, is so absolutely true. He said they brought their </p>

-3-<br />
culture and their virtues with them to enrich the heritage of whatever land they chose<br />
to dwell in. That's a vcry large accolade but a true one.<br />
I'm looking forward to the next couple of days as I rarely look forward to anything.<br />
The Taoiseach has said,-wc have our formal discussions but as well as that, apart from<br />
getting to know Dublin better, and having the opportunity of speaking at the Dail, I'm<br />
also having the opportunity to see rural Ireland and Tynagh in Galway, from whence<br />
my famnily came. And I was deeply moved and very honoured tonight that so many<br />
members of the Keating family fromn Galway have come tonight. I'm looking forward<br />
to seeing them and to meeting them in Tynagh in the next day or so.<br />
But before I do that, of course, we do have a chance to discuss our relationship. As<br />
the Taoiseach said, we have more in this relationship than so far we have taken from<br />
it. There's so much warmth and generosity And good feeling between the Australian<br />
nation and the Irish. And I hope this blossoms into a larger economic relationship<br />
than so far we've been able to manage. it's true for many nations that their sons<br />
and daughters, as they've gone to other countries, have managed in some ways to<br />
build a tight relationship which has had social and economic manifestations. We've<br />
had the social but not much of the economic. This is not entirely true of ; ourse<br />
because we are now doing it much more than we've ever done and Australian<br />
companies are now developing In Ireland and Irish companies arm developing in<br />
Australia. And some very famous ones among them who are represented here<br />
tonight. But we need to do more, becuse I think there's a very natural backdrop<br />
there for the Irish doing business In Australia, and I know with the opennms<br />
and warmth of this relationship for Australians doing more in Ireland.<br />
The Taiosech said we've got things to settle in world term and we have. We've<br />
got te GATT round now about to complete after seven years, to provide for what<br />
all of us widlget most and that is to provide a really good backdrop for multilateral<br />
trade. The thin that lifted the Income3 world wide in the post war years for<br />
countries, great countries WiJka pan and Germnany was a firee trade in goods. We're<br />
now tring to do that in servioes, in intellectual property rights and in agriculture.<br />
And that guarantees us the best opportunity ever to actually participate in the world<br />
and through the velocity of trade lift incomes world wide so that we can have a<br />
period of wealth and growth In prospec unparralleled at any time because In the<br />
world today we've lant seen the world lik this before the First World War, with<br />
great nations reJoining the world economy and society like the old Soviet Union,<br />
R~ ussia and the States of the Commonwealth of Independent States. And China and<br />
India and South America, who are now in the world economy as they've never been<br />
in the post war years. Soif we get this rightin the GATT, we can turn this world<br />
into a place wher incomes really do go up sharply andi where many disadvantaged<br />
societies open themselves up to some bounty and advantage.<br />
Now, in Europe, of course, Ireland's focus has been In Europe and on the<br />
Community which is entirely natural and good and correct, as Ausftralia's has bee </p>
<p>ItL--4.<br />
in the Asia/ Pacific. But, these opportunities abound for us but nothing greater tha<br />
the wider one of an international agreement on trade and servies and agriculture<br />
etcetera. We'll both go our ways in our respective areas of the world, In the Asia<br />
Pacific with this enormous weight of population and this huge rate of growth. It's<br />
not just for us to participate in but also for countries like Ireland as well, as we are<br />
participating in the European Community. So I look forward to discussing these<br />
things with the Taloseach in the next day or so.<br />
The other thing we have In common is the blight of Wnmploynnt, and this is the<br />
thing I know which touches the hearts of the people of Ireland, as it does the people<br />
of Australia. We're determined that we will not consign a generation of young<br />
people to unemployment, that wc won't accept the damage, the generational damage<br />
of a generation Impacting on the fabric of our society, with unemployment. And<br />
we're in a world today where, through higher productivity and mechanisation we're<br />
getting more output from fewer people. But we can't be content to say we live in a<br />
more productive world, we're getting more output from fewer people. We have to<br />
say therefore we must produce mre products that means we mnust grow more<br />
quickly. And that means we have to deal with idfltion and all these other things in a more<br />
novel way. Now we've done it in Australia with a wonderful accord between the<br />
Australian trade unions, and this governmen and I ) now in your country this is<br />
your hope too. That is, to develop a long standing relationship with your trade<br />
union movement so that there is a national commitment and consensus to growth<br />
and to employment, so large numbers of people are not left unemployed, bearing<br />
the brunt and carrying the load themselves, of economic change and productivity so<br />
that only those who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed should Oanv the<br />
burden and of course, most particularly the young.<br />
This we can never accep. Blecause if equality, and fairness, and egalitarian values<br />
start In any place, they start withgWp-Lojqnent-The way in our socetes you get a<br />
piece of the action is through employment. And we can never accept high levels of<br />
unemployment as part of, " Well, that's that, we have have to live with it." We can<br />
never have a bar of that attitude. So we're now looKing at novel ways to deal with<br />
unemnploymfent. We've got a task force looking at our experience and hoping to pull<br />
something novel from it and I know that you're thinking in the same termns too. and<br />
lt's hope we can share somne experienc there.<br />
The Taloseach mentioned Mary Robinson's visit to Australia last year, it was, I<br />
think, one of the most succesfal tripsiby a Head of State In recent timnes. And for<br />
Australians, I think, a persuasive Illustration of how a Head of State can be an<br />
ambassador for her country and for her people. I enjoyed very much that visit. It<br />
gave Afuter expression to this great relatiowNsp which we have togeter and<br />
reminded so many Australians of the democratic values and traditions of Ireland<br />

which were expressed in your President and expressed by your President while she<br />
was with us.<br />
I know at the moment she's In New Zealand, back down in the Antipodes. a long<br />
way from here. And no doubt having the same impact there as she had with us.<br />
So, she Invited me here but I'm pleased to say she's there doing her good work in<br />
the Antipodes. while I'm here, trying to do zine. So Taioseach, ladies and<br />
gentleman, It gives me very great pleasure to remember your President's visit to<br />
Australia. To remember, with it, the great warmth in that relationship. Again<br />
visible here tonight in the warmth of the welcome you've given my wife and<br />
myself. And so can I propose a toast to the President of Ireland and the people of<br />
Ireland and to another two hundred years of Irish Australian friendship.<br />
The President and the people of Ireland.<br />
Thank you.<br />
Ends. </p>
