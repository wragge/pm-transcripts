    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government today unveiled details of a $10 million boost to the Personal Helpers and Mentors (PHaMs) program, to give homeless Australians with a severe mental illness greater access to one-on-one support.</p>
<p>Six new services will be established in communities with significant homeless populations in New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia to help people with a mental illness who are homeless, or at risk of homelessness.</p>
<p>In addition, six new dedicated homelessness workers will be shared among four existing PHaMs sites in Victoria and Queensland to work solely with homeless clients in these areas.</p>
<p>In total, 36 additional personal mentors will be on the ground by mid 2010 to provide intensive assistance to homeless Australians with a severe mental illness.</p>
<p>PHaMs is designed to help people with a severe mental illness reconnect with the wider community and live more independent and satisfying lives.</p>
<p>Personal mentors work one-on-one with participants with practical help to achieve their personal goals - for example, finding stable housing, or improving relationships with family and friends.</p>
<p>These new personal mentors will also connect participants with essential clinical and social services, including housing services and health professionals.</p>
<p>The initiative forms part of the Australian Government's efforts to halve homelessness and offer accommodation to all rough sleepers who seek it by 2020.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is absolutely committed to reducing homelessness and has already:</p>
<p>- Made a 55 per cent increase in investment in homelessness and a substantial down payment on a twelve year reform agenda; </p>
<p>- Purchased or built 107 additional homes for homeless families under A Place to Call Home, with 750 dwellings to be purchased or built by June 2013; </p>
<p>- Completed 59,000 renovations to public housing dwellings through the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan;</p>
<p>- Commenced construction on over 8,000 new social housing dwellings across the country through the National Economic Stimulus Plan, with more than 500 completed; and </p>
<p>- Funded 40 new specialist homelessness projects across our housing programs.</p>
