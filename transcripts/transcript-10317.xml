28 April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS TO STATE DINNER<br />
IN HONOUR OF THE PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN<br />
MR RYUTARO HASHIMOTO<br />
E O E<br />
Mr and Mrs Hashimoto, Mr Tim Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia-, Mr<br />
Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition-, my other parliamentary colleagues;, your<br />
excellencies, distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It Is a special pleasure to welcome to Australia the Prime Minister of Japan. I welcome<br />
him as the leader of a nation with which Australia has developed very deep and close<br />
and important relationships over the last 40 years. I do so in the fortieth year since the<br />
signing of that very important milestone in the relationship between Australia and<br />
Japan and that is the commerce agreement of 1957. And I will come to the importance<br />
of that agreement and the part that it has played in laying the foundation of what is<br />
Australia's most important economic relationship in a moment. On a personal note, it<br />
is a pleasure for me to return the great and warm hospitality that the Prime Minister<br />
extended to me last year when I visited Tokyo. I welcome Mrs Hashimoto as well,<br />
and can I say if they revisit Australia, and I certainly hope they do, I am certain that<br />
they will choose to visit us on another occasion and come from a different direction.<br />
You see, they celebrated their wedding anniversary on the 27th of April and they came<br />
from the United ( applause).. well, I don't know that Mrs Hashimoto is going to<br />
applaud quite as warmly about what I am about to say. You see they left the United<br />
States on the 26th of April and crossed the international date line and succeeded in<br />
missing their wedding anniversary. I think there is some diplomatic price that will be<br />
paid somewhere for that. It certainly ought not to be that of our very charming<br />
Japanese ambassador Mr Sarto, who is very warmly and well regarded in the Canberra<br />
community. </p>
<p>But to both of you a very warm Australian welcomne is extended, and can I say that all<br />
Australians will share the sense of relief that I know the Prime Minister and the rest of<br />
the Japanese nation feel about the successful resolution of the very difficult hostage<br />
crisis in Peru.<br />
There is of course no nation in the world with which Australia has a deeper, a richer or<br />
more important economic association than Australia has with Japan. It really began in<br />
earnest when the former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Sir John McEwen, with<br />
great courage at the time pioneered the Japan/ Australia commerce agreement in 1957.<br />
From then the relationship has grown and deepened and diversified, Australia and<br />
Japan have a very close and complementary relationship. Japan is undeniably<br />
Australia's best market. It is a market that's built not only on exports of minerals, but<br />
also a market built upon a very diversified economic association. And of course the<br />
relationship between Australia and Japan epitomises the modern commitment of<br />
successive Australian governments of both political persuasions to the economic and<br />
political association that Australia has developed and will continue to develop with the<br />
nations of the Asia Pacific region. Australia and Japan are both full participants in the<br />
Asia Pacific region. Each of our nations makes its own particular contribution to those<br />
associations. I welcome Mr Hashimoto as a Prime Minister of Japan who has displayed great<br />
political courage and particular political skills. He has embarked upon a very dynamic<br />
and important economic and administrative reform programme. He has been a selfstarter<br />
in economic reform within Japan. It has been his personal conviction that<br />
outward looking economic reforms are important to Japans future rather than a<br />
response to outside pressure. He showed particular diplomatic skill in negotiating a<br />
successful resolution of outstanding matters between the United States and Japan over<br />
the Okinawa bases. And the joint declaration of the Prime Minister of Japan and<br />
President Clinton in May of 1996 gave contemporary and fresh expression and an<br />
enduring quality to the relationship, important as it is to us and to the rest of the region<br />
between the United States and Japan.<br />
There are many attitudes that Australia and Japan share in common. Both of us<br />
appreciate the importance of our respective alliances with the United States. Both of<br />
us value the continued presence, the fulsome presence of the United States in the Asia<br />
Pacific region. Both of us respect and support the overarching importance of the<br />
APEC association. It is the most visible and the most important expression of our<br />
common destiny as partners in the Asia Pacific region. And both of us appreciate the<br />
importance of an effective engagement of China, not only in the affairs of the region<br />
but also in the affairs of the entire world.<br />
There is little doubt that a sensible embrace of China as a full partner in the Asia<br />
Pacific region on proper terms and with proper understandings is an important foreign<br />
policy goal of both our countries. There are areas of course where we share common<br />
concerns and as I indicated earlier today, one of the matters that I will be canvassing<br />
with the Prime Minister in our discussions tomorrow will be the particular concerns<br />
that Australia has about the implications of the proposals for climate change. Australia<br />
is in a particularly difficult position on this issue. Perhaps uniquely, Australia is a<br />
developed country which is simultaneously a net exporter of energy and it is very </p>
<p>important that the very legitimate concerns of Australia and Australians, and not only<br />
of the Australian business community but particularly including them be known not<br />
only by Japan but also by our other trading partners. I would like to take this<br />
opportunity tonight Prime Minister to re-affirm the very strong support that my<br />
government extends to Japan's aspiration to become a permanent member of the<br />
Security Council of the United Nations. That has been a policy position of a number<br />
of governments in Australia for some years and I want to make it plain in your<br />
presence that my Government will continue to give very strong support to your<br />
aspirations in that regard. I have spoken Mr Prime Minister of the very important<br />
economic and political links that exist between our two countries. They are important<br />
and your visit to Australia will help to further cement those links. They will help to<br />
remind Australians of just how valuable a market Japan continues to be for our<br />
country. They will help to bring home to Australians the long continuity of the<br />
contribution that Japanese foreign investment has made to the development of the<br />
Australian economy and it is an opportunity for me as Prime Minister of Australia to<br />
emphasise the continued importance of foreign investment in this country and to reject<br />
some of the simplistic criticisms that are from time to time made of the role of foreign<br />
investment in the development of Australia. And I want to make it clear that without<br />
the constant flow of capital over the years from nations such as Japan and the United<br />
States and Britain and others who have invested in Australia, the standard of living that<br />
we now enjoy in this country would not be nearly so high.<br />
But important as those economic and political links undoubtedly are, there is of course<br />
another dimension to the rich relationship between our two countries. And that<br />
dimension of course is made up of the people to people links that over the years have<br />
developed. Last year 800 000 Japanese people visited Australia. The cultural links,<br />
the sister to sister city links, the educational links, the exchange visits, the growing<br />
recognition of the importance of Japan, the enormous growth in the number of<br />
Australian students who have learnt and can now speak Japanese and the astonishing<br />
way in which the knowledge of and the teaching of and an understanding of the<br />
Japanese language has supplanted that of any other foreign language in Australia over<br />
the last 20 years is an illustration that it is not just a dollar-yen relationship, it is also a<br />
relationship which is built on a growing mutual appreciation of different cultures and a<br />
growing understanding of a shared destiny in our part of the world.<br />
Can I say to you Mr Prime Minister that I enjoyed your company immensely when I<br />
was in Tokyo. I found you a very warm and engaging host. I found the welcome that<br />
you extended to me and my party very touching indeed and I have looked forward very<br />
enthusiastically to the opportunity of welcoming you as Prime Minister to Australia. I<br />
hope you can come again, and come again as Prime Minister. You and your wife will<br />
always be welcome here, not only as the Prime Minister of Japan but also for your own<br />
very delightful personalities. I very much hope that you both enjoy your brief but<br />
important visit to Australia and I have much pleasure in inviting the Leader of the<br />
Opposition Mr Kim Beazley to endorse my remarks.<br />
Thank you. </p>
