TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
PRE-RECORDED INTERVIEW WITH MAXINE MCKEW, ABC tAM<br />
PROGRAM, AUGUST IS, 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
MM: Prime Minister, we seemed to have come a long way in six months from the<br />
pretty heady optimism of ' One Nation'f to I suppose, what you could say the<br />
realistic qualifiers in this Budget.<br />
PM: We've certainly reduced the growth forecast, but I think the important thing<br />
is the economy is growing again and then we had the National Accounts for<br />
the full ycar just a wcek ago growing at about 1.6 per cent. That's the same<br />
as western Europe, but this coming year, the year we're in, this financial<br />
year we're in, wc'rc going to be growing at a round 3 per cent on average,<br />
nearly 4 through the year and in fact, faster than Europe, but about on<br />
average the same as our trading partncrs if you include the North Asian<br />
economics as wcll. So it is a reasonable rate of growth and it will start to<br />
pull employment up.<br />
MM: The task of ecoAver is obviously proving a lot more difficult than you ever<br />
imagined it could be after you took ovcr as Primc Minister.<br />
PM: I think it has bcen harder to ignite the growth that we now have and we<br />
hoped we'd have more, but in the same period the OECD has now twice<br />
revised down its forecasts for OECD arca growth, so has the IMF. This is<br />
now pretty much a phenomenon that is a world wide one, but the main thing<br />
is there is a role for Government, the Government has a job to do in kicking<br />
growth along and protecting the people who have been hurt along the way,<br />
the uncmployecd and also moving our social agenda along by such things as </p>
<p>2<br />
improvement of public hospital access under Medicare. increasing the_!&amp; O<br />
-pension, support for caters et cetera.<br />
MM: You mentioned the unemployed, I suppose you never imagined six months<br />
ago that you would have to face a press conference as you did, what a<br />
month or so ago, and explain a figure of 11. 1 per cent.<br />
PM: No, because that was occasioned by thc number of people looking for work<br />
and one can never make judgements about this participation rate. If we had<br />
thc same participation rate today that John Howard faced, we'd have<br />
unemployment at 8.5 per cent or thereabouts. The fact is we were very<br />
successful in the 1980s in employing Australians. The Australian<br />
workforce is a quarter bigger than it was in 1983, we've kept most of the<br />
1980s jobs and people not unreasonably had the expectation of finding<br />
work. So when things start to look better they've obviously gone out there<br />
looking and that's shoved the unemployment rate up to around I I.<br />
MM: As you see it, it's obviously become a political and a social necessity, a<br />
matter of social justice as you say to spend money on job creation schemes,<br />
but does that go against the grain a little bit in that the jobs you're creating<br />
arc not the new clever jobs that you talk about, they're not the sort of jobs<br />
that will give us export income, that will make us hold our heads high in the<br />
international arena?<br />
PM: No, but in thc 1980s when I was Treasurer in this phase in 1983 we had the<br />
Community Employment Program doing some of those things, we were<br />
then developing the labour market programs which had more of a training<br />
component to them and wc'vc now sophisticated those ovcr the period. So<br />
those labour market programs will reach over 400,000 people this ycar so it<br />
gives all those people a chance of having work experience and training and<br />
that means that they're likely to get back into the full time workforce much<br />
earlier, more quickly.<br />
MM: And are you ready to go into top gear with thesc programs straight away?<br />
PM: They're all programs largely which have bccn developed and which we're<br />
adding to. The new ones were announced a couple of weeks ago in the<br />
youth initiatives which I announced, that is the Career Start Traineeships et<br />
cetcra, but the ones which arc here; Jobtrain, Jobskills, Jobstart arc all<br />
existing ones which wc can wind up quickly. </p>
<p>MM: If you accept that a substantial element of that unemployment is structural,<br />
job creation schemes won't do much about that will they?<br />
PM: There is a ncw Budget initiative there for open universities, open learning<br />
and that means that many Australians will be able to get access to tertiary<br />
education who can't now, that is in addition to the 50 per cent addition to<br />
places we've already put there, the 120,000 extra university places we'vc<br />
created and the total remodelling of TAPE. So if we are, as wc have been<br />
for most of the 1980s now developing a much greater skills base in the<br />
conomy, producing more sophisticated products, it simply follows that the<br />
sort of workforce who'll be producing those products will be a trained one.<br />
We're putting the institutional things in place, I mean there's been a<br />
rcvolution in the change and the participation rate in schools, in universities<br />
and in technical education, and in technical education it's going to be<br />
improved, so of most OECD countries there can be none making such a<br />
transition so rapidly as wc are.<br />
MM: Despite those efforts, some of our employers are saying that the growth we<br />
are likely to see will come via higher productivity meaning they will do<br />
more with fewer employees.<br />
PM-That's true and that means if you want to get unemployment down, you'eve<br />
got to run thc economy fastcr., This is what I keecp saying to the OppositIion.<br />
They want a policy where they have a pool of unemployment as a natural<br />
check on wage growth. They're saying don't open the accelerator up, don't<br />
let the place grow quickly, because a pool of unemployment is actually<br />
handy to keep wages down; that's the Hewson model. Our model says if<br />
you've got more productive businesses with a given level of output bcing<br />
produced by fewer people, to produce more employment you've got to have<br />
even more output, that is even greater growth. And how do you do that<br />
without it spilling into wages and prices? Answer: a wages policy, an<br />
Accord.<br />
MM: But business is not investing in the first place.<br />
PM: It's starting to pick up in these forecasts and part of that pick up we saw in<br />
thc National Accounts for last year, investment starting to stir. But the<br />
notion that we shouldn't be growing and that we should hold it down and<br />
with some sort of miserable view that a pool of unemployment is actually<br />
something that has a depressing effect on wages which ic is a good thing,<br />
thc sort of nark conservative view is a view we won't accept. </p>
<p>pt. pfl,, b.." J~ a. e<br />

MM: What of the growth figure of 3 per cent though? That is not likely to make<br />
much of a dent in unemployment, I mean the Budget forecasts say well<br />
we're still looking at 10 per cent by the middle of next year.<br />
PM; Down to 10 that's true, but again it's the direction which I think is important<br />
and the psychology of the country, the direction Is important particularly<br />
where those labour market programs picking up 400,000 of those people<br />
unemployed. And through the year that's 3 3/ 4, in other words a 3 pcr cent<br />
for year avcrage but the actual speed across the year is nearly 4 per cent.<br />
That will totally change the psychology of thc country and I'm quite surc<br />
that the public expenditure programs now, that is the highways, the $ 2<br />
billion on roads, the national rail system, the ' One Nation' spending, last<br />
week we ordered 3,000 tonnes of rail steel, a million concrete sicepers, that's<br />
all starting to happen. I think as that happens and the Budget spending<br />
happens and this regional policy of spending in the regions all that will kick<br />
the growth along right at the right time.<br />
MM: But Prime Minister there was another chilling commcnt in thc Budget<br />
papers and that was that as wc see the recovery coming through there will<br />
be a kick up in the current account. N~ ow what has the 1980s been about if<br />
not trying to got that currcnt account under control?<br />
PM: Yes, but ' We're now in the last few years ninning a large balance of trade<br />
surplus, we're now running a balance of trade surplus of about $ 4 billion.<br />
Thc current account debt came from the tact that we were running a trade<br />
deficit, we were importing more than wc'rc exporting. This has not been so<br />
of the last two or three years so we've still got a current account deficit that<br />
is true, because of the interest payments on the old debt. But as invcstmcnt<br />
picks up imports will pick up and slow that progress down, but again it's a<br />
pretty modcst increase from 3 3/ 4 per cent of GDP; 3.1 to 3.7.<br />
MM: But docsn't it worry you that we're seeing the growth in private<br />
consumption, in housing?<br />
PM: But again what's the answer? Demand management, sit on the ceonomy,<br />
don't let it grow. the only thing to do is to add to supply, that is be ablc to<br />
produce more goods and services, I mcan the grcat thing about Australia is<br />
we have made this vast transition to elaborate manufactures and<br />
manufacturing exports. Manufactured exports have trebled since 1983,<br />
elaborately transformed manufactures have done the same and all we should<br />
do is continue to add to supply and that's the way we'll beat the current </p>
<p>account. We won't beat it by trying to sit on the economy, that is kill the<br />
imports by killing thc growth and killing employment.<br />
MM: Our pcrformance, of course, Is depcndent on a stable international climate,<br />
and again the Budget papers refer to the fact that if we see a further<br />
contraction in Japan, then the forecasts are at risk.<br />
PM: Well we've got ourselves growing In this, our trading partners arc growing<br />
at 3 per cent on average, that's exactly as we see ourselves growing.<br />
MM: Mmm, but that growth is again dependent on Japan, is it not?<br />
PM: The bulk of it depends on the United States', and some of it on Japan's, some<br />
of it on Westcrn Europe's, and some of It of course in the South Pacific and<br />
North Asia areas. Thcy'rc growing much fastcr than we are, but taken as an<br />
average group it's about 3. Even if there was a shift in Japanese growth it<br />
wouldn't change thc forecast much.<br />
MM: You mentioned the US there. What of the possibility of a Clinton victory in<br />
the US say in November? Now cven thc prospect of that is making the<br />
markets a bit nervous at the moment.<br />
PM: Could be, but one of the things I think Australians should understand, that is<br />
the United States didn't fix their budget deficits in the 1980s, and iii the<br />
good times thcy didn't produce surpluses. We did. And now thcy've got a<br />
budget dcficit this ycar of 6 per cent of GDP, wc'vc got onc of 3.3. Ours is<br />
going to come back towards balance, theirs isn't. And that's now why they<br />
can't use fiscal policy as we can usc it to lift the stimulus and let growth<br />
move in the economy. These are now options Australians have because of<br />
good management in Budget policy.<br />
MM: But if you had a Bill Clinton in the White I ouse next year, he'd be worried<br />
about winning re-election four years hence, not so much worried about the<br />
economy and getting that down from 6 per ent.<br />
PM: Thc US political system has not been able to manage this cconomy, and<br />
there's been this dichotomy between the power of the President, the<br />
Congress, and the Executive. And they've not been able to manage fiscal<br />
policy, and that's why they took no precautionary action in the salad days of<br />
growth, and now why they're basically hoisted with these very high deficits<br />
and no capacity to actually stimulate the economy. </p>
<p>6<br />
MM: Indeed, but if it's bad there it could be bad for us.<br />
PM: It could, but I mean again, they're in a cycle and they'll pick their way out of<br />
the cycle as well as we are. I don't think it's going to change our forecast<br />
much at all.<br />
MM: Well, just to some local comment. Business leaders here have cast doubt on<br />
the 3 per ccnt. Thcy say it could be less optimistic than that<br />
PM: I mean, you'd have to have a huge contraction in growth off our national<br />
account numbers of last year that's the actual growth we've rncasured, the<br />
statisticians measured, for the year to June 30 this year. For the last<br />
financial year you'd need a contraction to produce some of those numbers.<br />
No, we've got here I think conservative numbers, a conservative forecast at<br />
3 per cent for year average growth, and 3 3/ 4 through the year.<br />
MM: Is this Budget a plan for the future, or is it a palliative?<br />
PM: No, no, it keeps the structural progress going, that's the point, and the social<br />
progrcss. That big change to Medicare for hospitals, the change to the<br />
social security programs, the 150 per cent for R D to keep that research<br />
and dlot) cnt component coming through, on top of the huge change in<br />
depreciation rates in the One Nation Statement in February the pooled<br />
development funds, all of the other innovative tax changes which obtained<br />
then and for the general business environment, low inflation, low interest<br />
rates, a competitive exchange rate, a very high profit share and about to go<br />
higher, a set of wage arrangements in place which will hold the inflation<br />
rate below our trading partners. It's a-pretty good scene coming up.<br />
MM: You referred bcforc to the training programs that are in place, and certainly<br />
in the last month you've gone to a lot of trouble to gct a comprehensive<br />
training program in place. Kim Beazley said on this point that what wc will<br />
see in the future is the marr iage of training with national economic goals.<br />
Now, some might say well that's only half the picture, why not go ahead and<br />
marry industry policy to national economic goats, and much more<br />
directional industry policy?<br />
PM: Well it basically is. I mean look, we're saying sell your brains, train your<br />
kids, keep them in school, put them through universities and TAFE, sell<br />
innovative products, sell your brains. John Hcwson is saying don't do that,<br />
let's sell the dumb products, let's cut thc wages to $ 3 an hour, let's cormpetc<br />
in the low orders of the international division of labour, let's compete with<br />
1 w 1 I. </p>
<p>7<br />
the people on $ 15 or $ 20 a week in South East Asia, let's try to make the<br />
things that we shouldn't bc making, and let's keep in the game by cutting the<br />
wages of low paid Australians. We're saying, give that up, let's have a<br />
trained work force doing clever things.<br />
MM: To what industries would you like our young people to sell their brains, in<br />
what areas should we be competitive and getting the exporting going?<br />
PM: Well, all the ones we're doing now elaborately transformed manufactures,<br />
services, education services, health services, tourism, financial services, and<br />
in those clever parts of, you know, computer software programs.<br />
MM: But are we doing enough? We've got the manufactured exports up, but<br />
they're only up to about 25 per cent of our total exports.<br />
PM: Well they're higher now than rural or mining exports for the first time ever.<br />
I mean the Liberals should have hung their heads in shame that for 310 years<br />
the whole post war trade in goods and serviccs passed us by, we were just<br />
basically into producing a bit of wheat and wool and a few minerals. As<br />
important as they are, and remain, they are not enough and they don't<br />
employ people in cities. You can't say get a job at the back of Queensland<br />
or in Wcstern Australia if you live in Sydney or Melbourne. So we had to<br />
re-establish, we had to rebuild the basis of our manufacturing and our<br />
services because this community didn't have its share of intcmnational<br />
services.<br />
MM: Prime Minister, in terms of the political battle you gave a bit of a chestthumping<br />
speech to the Caucus the other day along the lines of ' you ain't<br />
seen nothing yet'. What have you got in mind?<br />
PM: Wc're going to paint Dr Hcwson and his policies, which are basically about<br />
survival of the fittest, the Gordon Gecko view of the world, you know<br />
' greed is good' and if you're not a millionaire you're a layabout stick a<br />
consumption tax on everybody, make the low paid people give tax cuts to<br />
the higher paid people, mnake people pay for their health care regardless of<br />
their income, no Medicare, you have a right to go to university if your<br />
parents can afford full fees 12-15,000 a year. We're saying that's not the<br />
view, that the mix we've got, the blend between an open market economy<br />
introduced by a Labor Government, ironically introduced by a Labor<br />
Govcrnmcnt graftcd together with a really comprehending and<br />
compassionate social policy, with a role for business and a role for the<br />
unions, in an evolutionary change in the labour market. That's the model for </p>
<p>8<br />
Australia. Not some sort of late " 70s. Thatcherite model which is basically<br />
built upon the greed syndrome if there's a quid for you go and get it, and if<br />
there isn't there's no point to you. And that's the difference between the<br />
parties. And that ideological difference is going to become more apparcnt<br />
as the months go on.<br />
MM: Don't you think the electorate, though, with reservations might say we might<br />
as well go for that because we want to punish Labor, they have given us I1I<br />
per cent unemploymcnt?<br />
PM: Look, we get New Zealand thrown up to us as a model by Dr Hewson.<br />
There are the same number of people in jobs in New Zealand today as there<br />
was in 1983, in fact fewer. In fact, by a modest amount, fewer. In Australia<br />
there is 25 per cent more people in work. When I became Treasurer the<br />
work force was 6 million, it's now 7.6 million. We had more growth in<br />
Australia in the 1980s than there is GDP, total product, in the New Zealand<br />
economy. We've madc thc great transition to an externally oriented society,<br />
we've built onc of the best social security safety ncts in the world. 1 mean,<br />
why should the community punish us to reward a set of coalition layabouts<br />
who got us into this hole in the first place, a person who was advising the<br />
then Treasurer for 7 years, who left us with a massive current account<br />
imbalance, ballooning foreign debt, a 10 per cent inflation rate, nearly I1I<br />
per cent unemployment, 10.5 per cent uncmployment, and a hopeless sort of<br />
outlook? Why should that group ever be rewarded by the electorate vis a<br />
vis a government which has taken all the courageous changes and tried to<br />
make something of Australia, to give it a place in the world,<br />
notwithstanding thc fact that the game got overheated in the late 1980s and<br />
the result is the rcecssion. It has been the recession, but the same recession<br />
that we see in Britain did you know that Britain has just slipped back into<br />
negative growth. I mean, we're now growing at 1.6 for the year to June,<br />
they arc actually contracting 1.5. The United Statcs is in a recession, Japan<br />
is in a recession, France is in a recession. This has been part of the dcbt<br />
hangover of the ' 80s and the collapse In asset prices. And to say lct's throw<br />
the baby out with the bath water, let's take the Governmcnt that really made<br />
the post war changes, that made the courageous change to an externally<br />
oriented society, that made all the social changes, the structural changes,<br />
and what will we have back? The Gordon Gecko of Australian politics, to<br />
give us the ' greed is good' syndromc. Thatcher, 1979, who wants that?<br />
MM: Prime Minister, I suppose you're not holding your breath about a Kirner<br />
victory in Victoria. Isn't thcre the same sentiment about the Federal<br />
-7-</p>
<p>9<br />
Governmcnt, to a certain extent, as t~ cre is about the Victorian Labor<br />
Government?<br />
PM: I'd hold my breath for a Goss victoi.* in Queensland, though. What point's<br />
that make?<br />
MM: Prime Minister, thank you.<br />
PM: Thank you, Maxine.<br />
