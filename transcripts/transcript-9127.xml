TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DISCUSSION WITH PANEL PHILLIP ADAMS, FRANK BRENNAN AND<br />
CHERYL SAUNDERS, ANU, CANBERRA, TUESDAY, 22 FEBRUARY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
You have just heard from the Peter Pan of Australian politics who while he<br />
advocates change, changes very little -himself. ' Now, as you know Prime<br />
Ministers' appearances are subjected to rapid aging. I mean Hawke aged a<br />
decade every year, and I think the same thing was true of Fraser.<br />
I am going to remind the Prime Minister of a brief exchange we had 20 years<br />
ago, when he was, I think, the youngest Minister in the Whitlam Government.<br />
I asked him is he was aware that he bore an eerie resemblance to an actor<br />
called Anthony Valentine, who played a really sleazy sinister character in<br />
Callan. Not only was he aware of it, they turned out to both be aware of it<br />
because the two of them had bumped into each other at Foils Bookshop, in<br />
London, and gazed at each other in mutual disbelief.<br />
I have great news for you Prime Minster, he hasn't worn well, I saw him the<br />
other night in a new series called Body and Soul, he now looks like<br />
something the cat dragged in after mastication in the garden, and I think the<br />
press should address not the Gould Prints in the Cabinet Office, but the<br />
Dorian Gray portrait in the Lodge garage.<br />
Now, we are now going to mark the Prime Minister's home work and I am<br />
joined by Professor Cheryl Saunders. Cheryl holds a personal chair in the<br />
faculty of Law at the University of Melbourne, she is Deputy Dean of the<br />
Faculty with special interests in constitutional law, administrative law and<br />
comparative constitutional systems. She doubles as Director for the Centre<br />
for Comparative Constitutional Studies; a specialist centre of the faculty of<br />
law.<br />
Also sitting here with us, I don't know what the Pope thinks of him, but he is<br />
my favourite Jesuit, Father Frank Brennan. For many years he was the<br />
Aboriginal Affairs consultant to the Catholic Bishops of Australia, and legal<br />
adviser to the Queensland Aboriginal Coordinating council. And he is a<br />
member of the Council of the constitutional centenary foundation. </p>
<p>If I can go to you first, Cheryl, given your great interest in institutional matters<br />
would you like to address areas or sins of omission and commission in the<br />
Prime Minister's extemporised chat?<br />
CS: Well, I'm torn Phillip, starting with the little issues or starting with the<br />
big ones so I'll start big and work down. Prime Minister, I spend a lot<br />
of time these days wearing my Constitutional Centenary Foundation<br />
hat talking to people about this constitutional decade that leads to the<br />
centenary of the constitution in 2001 and passes all sorts of other<br />
important milestones along the way and I say that this is a great<br />
opportunity to engage the people of Australia's interest in their own<br />
system of government, to identify issues that actually need change and<br />
if we decide collectively in some way or another that change is<br />
desirable to pursue those matters. I get a range of answers to that, but<br />
having you here it is too good a temptation to miss not to ask you the<br />
same question. How would you like us to use this constitutional<br />
decade?<br />
PM: I have always been one who has believed that with change one has to<br />
whether it be constitutional change or any other change to<br />
proselytise for it; make it popular, make it interesting; gather and<br />
gamner support for it; but there has to be some lead, the leadership<br />
group has to lead, has to step out and bring the community up with it to<br />
be able to make the change stick. Otherwise one is simply moving out<br />
on the limb and the limb breaks off. I mean, you have got to, if you<br />
like, thicken it up, strengthen it so that it can support the weight of the<br />
political change. Therefore, I don't believe that change just comes<br />
from the ether. I suppose if there is any point of disagreement with you<br />
about not with the question, but other things which you have said on<br />
behalf of as you say the constitutional decade, there won't be a<br />
constitutional decade unless a political system wants to embrace a<br />
change-then, I-think, -you can garner support for change, proselytise for<br />
it and move it to an action point. I think, you are in the proselytising<br />
business and that is a good and fair business to be inrespect of the<br />
constitution. But I think one has to set objectives and go after them. It<br />
is a matter about change whether one is objective oriented or whether<br />
one sees a change in the broad and wants to make the change in the<br />
broad. I don't think you can make the change in the broad. I think you<br />
can see the pattern of the change in the broad, but you have got to put<br />
the pieces of the matrix in one after the other and build on them.<br />
This is also true in constitutional change where one decides what is<br />
possible to be done, what isare desirable and possible, get a<br />
commitment to political action for that then bring up the community with<br />
us. I think then we can really get some changes into place. But, I<br />
think were we to rely upon simply seeding the communities mind with<br />
the inadequacies of our current constitution and the benefits of change<br />
will do no more than seed the community's mind about the constitution<br />
and the need for change, but it won't get the change. </p>
<p>3<br />
CS: Yes, I understand that but the problem is in the past we've also<br />
adopted the other method which is getting the little bits of the matrix<br />
and putting them to the community and the community says no. This is<br />
an attempt to try and find some other way around that impasse.<br />
PM: I think with the constitution we'll always need the best we can get it, bipartisan<br />
support in these things and the things you and I have had in a<br />
common discussion in the public debate about the republic and these<br />
sorts of issues are issues which of course, will always be stronger and<br />
better with bi-partisan support. In my terms let me just put a partisan<br />
hat on and say I'd be encouraged if, for instance, our opponents were<br />
interested in that debate rather than resisting what is an inevitable<br />
change in my view. Now, if the political system can move on a broad<br />
front I have got no doubt that we can with the great changes already<br />
passed in this last decade, encourage Australian people to make<br />
changes. I think, if we go with piecemeal referenda which are basically<br />
disputed by the parties at a poll, it is as you say, it will go nowhere.<br />
So, it is a matter of understanding what is core and essential and<br />
garnering support for it and moving ahead with it and Australians have<br />
a great capacity for change and as I said at the beginning of my<br />
remarks, perhaps one of the most fundamental and important of the<br />
institutional changes has been the appetite for the change.<br />
PA: How do you sense the appetite for change on the republican issue at<br />
the moment?<br />
PM: I think there is a tremendous appetite for change in the republican<br />
issue. I think that is no longer appropriate for the head of Australia tobe<br />
t~ ie Monarch of Great Britain. It is as simple as that.<br />
PA: I think we know the arguments, I am just saying the polls at the..<br />
PM: No, I know the arguments..<br />
PA: the polls are vacillating aren't they?<br />
PM: But, you are asking me about whether people have seen it. Well I'm<br />
pointing at it. It is such an obvious thing to see, generally people see<br />
obvious things.<br />
EB: One of the issues that hasn't been raised thus far tonight of course has<br />
been Mabo which surely is a major institutional change.<br />
PA: It is, but I'd like to start by saying I think it is a very welcome thing,<br />
Prime Minister, that we can have an extemporised address by a Prime<br />
Minister on institutional change to the people and then we can have<br />
two lawyers one able to proselytise and the other a cleric who are not </p>
<p>of your stable, where we can sit down and have a discussion about<br />
these things and I think it is about the people that it is most important<br />
in terms of these institutions. So when it comes to something like<br />
Mabo I think that we have to concede that yes, a political leader like<br />
yourself took the ball and ran and that was essential in terms of the<br />
recipe of getting it right, but what has been essential is not just<br />
arrangements or deals between stake holders or politicians, but rather<br />
the public coming with you and the public having to own, for example,<br />
the principal of non-discrimination. That even though your political<br />
opponents didn't support your legislation, all of our elected leaders<br />
nationally after the debate said we insist on non-discrimination and so I<br />
just take that as one example that maybe we need to do more as a<br />
nation in involving the people sooner. For example, on the republic<br />
one, if it is that self evident, rather than leaving the people to the end<br />
and the politicians doing the timing, are we perhaps getting to the<br />
stage as a nation where we need some sort of indicative plebiscite<br />
which just says do you want a change of head of state or not? And if<br />
we can get that out of the way and we then run with that then all of the<br />
complexities and all the rest, we can have five years of flash<br />
constitutional lawyers and all the other arguments, what do you think?<br />
PM: I still think you have got to find a square peg for a square hole. That<br />
is, it is like with Mabo. If I had said at the beginning of that debate:<br />
" Look, the High Court has made a decision let's put a motion through<br />
both houses of Parliament: are we in favour of a legislation to<br />
empower Aboriginal Australians with a title to land vested under this<br />
High Court decision?" It would, I think, probably have been defeated.<br />
Therefore, I think if one has a square hole and one is starting with a<br />
round peg you have got to get the peg squared up to drive it home.<br />
Therefore, that requires all of the skilling, all of the technical dexterity,<br />
all of the ambition, all of the horsepower, all the people muscle that<br />
one can arrange at the particular time so the peg is just outside the<br />
hole and you hit it in.<br />
Now, this happened with Mabo and it can happen too with the republic.<br />
It is like those who say let's have the full referendum now knowing that<br />
the Coalition would oppose it, therefore truncating the public's chance<br />
to really consider the issues and get them clearly in their mind. I want<br />
the change and therefore I think it should come when we've developed<br />
well enough in peoples' minds an understanding of what it is. Then, I<br />
think, you have got the fertile ground to put a referenda of that kind,<br />
but I think if we went early I don't really think we would advance it. It is<br />
all again about spearheading change and pulling up the support<br />
behind it and I don't really think there is any substitute for political<br />
action and general community support, that is, concurrent community<br />
support. </p>
<p>P A: You seem to have got some support from Balmoral. Tell us you are<br />
amongst friends here what you and the Queen discussed when you<br />
sort of worked out what was obviously some sort of deal?<br />
PM: Prince Charles made it very clear. He said he thought that we should<br />
have a debate about this subject and he said who knows, those who<br />
argue for it may be right. Well, I'm sure we think they are, but time will<br />
tell. At any rate, it's a variation on the same theme. That is, how do<br />
you get change? Have we got a community that wants change and<br />
has the capacity to change? The answer is very much in the<br />
affirmative in both counts and therefore it is a great thing. I mean, you<br />
can turn on any talk-back program in this country and find a debate<br />
about such things as non-discrim ination; a debate about the republic<br />
and constitutional change; debate about the micro economy, microeconomic<br />
reform you would never hear this in many other countries in<br />
a general debate. We have a tremendous popular debate going and<br />
therefore, I think, the thing for the political system to do is to recognise<br />
that the community has a great capacity for change provided that it is<br />
prepared properly.<br />
FB: What about for every action there is an equal reaction. Do you reckon<br />
the Mabo debate on open-line radio programs, one was aware of the<br />
vast swelling of bigotry carefully flamed by many of the radio<br />
presenters. Don't you also recognise..<br />
PM: Don't mention names there.<br />
FB: No names, I wouldn't mention Alan Jones if you paid me! But this<br />
appetite for change is also surely shadowed by a repugnance for<br />
change, a growing fear of change?<br />
PM: I don't believe that, I really don't believe that. This Government put<br />
itself at risk in 1987 and in 1990 and to some extent again in 1993 by<br />
running policy changes in short parliaments, which governments in the<br />
post-war years didn't do. And it was done on the simple nostrum that<br />
good policies represent good politics and faith in the Australian<br />
community's capacity to believe in something better. Now, that may<br />
sound starry eyed there are three important election victories to<br />
prove otherwise. I actually think anybody who believes that the public<br />
has had too much change and they are afraid of it sells them short.<br />
That is, not particularly to sell them short, but fails to understand, in<br />
fact, how much they comprehend. This is a most conscientious<br />
electorate, a most serious constituency and it is listening all the time<br />
for value. This is what the pollsters never pick up, it is what the press<br />
galleries never pick up. They ran on herd instinct, on basically what<br />
they think a pollster can deliver, it always needs a politician to<br />
decipher the code. I used to do this with Bob Hogg you'd pick up the<br />
pollster's information, I'd read it and I'd just read completely different<br />
things to him, completely different, completely different things to me. </p>
<p>6<br />
PA: Like a couple of Dead Sea scrolls' scholars.<br />
PM: Exactly. So, yes, one looks at the colour of the paper and the<br />
parchment and style and note the way the questions are put.<br />
Therefore, I think one has to know that there is this great well of<br />
listeners, people listening to bits of value and they hear it and they<br />
register it, but it may not be in the static and the hubbub of public life<br />
that sort of drifts through them. I think if one assumes that I do, that<br />
this, if you like altruism and sense of greater good exists in the<br />
Australian community, therefore one operates in the belief if you can<br />
tap it, you prosper by it.<br />
PA: Cheryl, if the states didn't exist they would need to be invented we<br />
have learnt tonight. This I suspect you would view as not sufficiently<br />
moving down the path of change, a bit to minimal for you.<br />
CS: No, no, the minimalist stuff comes up with the republic Phillip. No, I<br />
was wondering whether we should turn to the states and COAG and<br />
leave some of these other matters behind and I was -very interested in<br />
what you said about that Prime Minister. I am personally of the view<br />
that we have wasted a lot of time as a nation in wondering about<br />
whether we should have a federal system instead of making it work so<br />
any efforts in that regard over this decade are, I think, very welcome.<br />
But the real question still is how. I mean you set out your four<br />
principles, but nevertheless that doesn't really get us there. We have<br />
somehow managed to build up a very adversarial federal system, a<br />
federal system that, I think, to a greater degree than any other federal<br />
system in the world relies on the courts to police it rather than having<br />
political will at both levels. How are we going to actually make COAG<br />
work and the other institutions of inter governmental relations work?<br />
PM: I certainly share the view and I have always, I think, that is, we are<br />
better getting on making it work than seeking to abolish the states<br />
because if you look at the areas I mean we are a most urban ised<br />
country and if you look at the areas of greater Melbourne, Sydney,<br />
Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth et cetera, one would find very large regional<br />
areas to their hinterland. For a start, very large regional greater city<br />
governments and given the fact that most of the populations of the<br />
states are concentrated in these places the greater city government in<br />
fact becomes the government of the provincial area or the state so<br />
really you are into a discussion about what the boundaries of NSW<br />
and Victoria ought to be in the hinterland. Now, it may be if you were<br />
redrawing all this you would have northern NSW relating more to<br />
Brisbane than to Sydney and in north Queensland there would be<br />
another central authority there would be another rather than the<br />
authority being in Brisbane. But that said largely in terms of the<br />
change that would be about it, so therefore given the enormous<br />
constitutional difficulties of trying to rescramble that one it's better to </p>
<p>7<br />
get on with it as you say and make it work. But, one of the things I said<br />
tonight which is central to that is that whether the people who did at the<br />
time understood what they were doing uniform taxation is the glue<br />
that binds the whole thing together.<br />
Now, much of the haggling and arguing of the last ten years, I can only<br />
speak for my time with the states, has been about not really them<br />
acquiring taxing powers, but guaranteed revenue shares from the<br />
Commonwealth et cetera. Some would like now taxing powers. To<br />
give them taxing powers, to give them income taxing powers would end<br />
up with six different economies in this country and not one and when<br />
given half a chance a couple of years ago they wanted actually to have<br />
different rates of income tax in different states.<br />
PA: Well, it worked with the railways didn't it?<br />
PMV Yes, well the thing is that can't happen to us, but that said I believe the<br />
states should be properly resourced and I think then we should sit<br />
down and look at all the functional areas, but sit down as Heads of<br />
Governments and Ministers and see whether what we are doing in<br />
health or supported accommodation or in housing is are we getting<br />
the biggest bang for the buck; are we able to deliver the Australian<br />
community the best programs. I think, that sort of co-operation, we are<br />
already seeing quite great strides. Let me just indicate a couple of<br />
them. In the last few years the development of a national training<br />
authority to do in education in the vocational area what the<br />
Commonwealth has been able to do with the universities but, to do it<br />
co-operatively with the states. A National Rail Corporation for a<br />
national rail highway is another. We are now looking at a national,<br />
certainly an east coast electricity grid. So there is a lot of progress<br />
and one has to underline that progress and then go on to do more, but<br />
it has got to be done on the basis of we're saying look, let's forget this<br />
debate about states, let's make clear that they should be properly<br />
resourced, let's have a central taxing authority and a central economy,<br />
that's fine, let's look at these functional areas, but in the micro areas<br />
where it now does matter about the turnaround times in ports, where it<br />
does matter what the price of electricity is, where it does matter about<br />
the competitive quality of the states, government business enterprises<br />
be they in these areas or in rail these things need to be worked out<br />
between the commonwealth and the states.<br />
The commonwealth can't do this alone, the states can't do it alone.<br />
PA: Frank Brennan, would you like to turn your finely honed Jesuit and<br />
intellect onto micro economic reforms as an area of which you have<br />
some criticism.<br />
EB: I don't have to earn a living. But, I would like to turn it onto is looking<br />
at something of the role of the Parliament as the elected </p>
<p>8<br />
representatives when you are speaking of these sorts of changes and<br />
if I might draw one other from the Mabo discussion if COAG had gone<br />
well and you pushed through Mabo there, I think the chances of<br />
Aboriginal endorsement of it would have been very slight. Whereas it<br />
was because you had a Senate, people like Michael Mansell could<br />
come out and congratulate you on being flexible and saying this is the<br />
sort of legislation we can run with. So, how do we go forward in terms<br />
of insuring that our Parliamentary institutions are strong so that the<br />
voice of the people can really participate in that debate rather than the<br />
elected politicians simply delivering from the executive some sort of<br />
sealed solution?<br />
PM: Even had the COAG meeting endorsed the proposals that I had put,<br />
that was never a Bill or a piece of legislation. Even if there had been<br />
endorsement for that, by the time it had got into the form of a Bill we<br />
would have had these debates and the government had moved well<br />
before the COAG meeting to have most broad consultation with the<br />
Aboriginal community, with the mining industry, with the agricultural<br />
industry, pastoralists, we had already had a very large consultative<br />
structure. I think one of the reasons so much change has been accommodated in<br />
the last decade is the process of consultation. Consultation has<br />
mattered with the workforce, with business, with the states and in this<br />
case with the Aboriginal community. We have seen it in other things in<br />
the forest debate with the forest industry, with the environment lobby et<br />
cetera.<br />
PA: But in terms of institutions, could I suggest that even with a reformed<br />
Labor party, but for a High Court decision and but for a Senate you<br />
didn't control, the Aborigines would not have got from a Labor<br />
government what they got?<br />
PM: That is not necessarily so. They might not have got a native title<br />
springing from the common law which was emanating from the<br />
common law which was then given if you like, turned into a propriety<br />
title by the Parliament, but they may well have been given some kind of<br />
statutory title that is, with a general land rights legislation except<br />
remembering that general land rights legislation existed in every state<br />
of Australia bar Western Australia. So, really, it was always going to<br />
be about statutory land rights in Western Australia. We could have<br />
also at the same time land funds could have acquired pastoral leases<br />
as under the native title legislation. So you have had in a sense,<br />
something of the same result, but maybe not on the broad front that we<br />
got by virtue of the fact that terra nullius was overturned.<br />
But doesn't that prove just another point. When a wrong is righted we<br />
are all better off. </p>
<p>9<br />
PA: Prime Minister I think your homework has been marked quite nicely<br />
tonight. You have got a koala bear stamp which is very rarely given<br />
and I have the privilege of asking you the final question. What is the<br />
single aspect of our character and our culture that we need to change<br />
in your opinion? What do we really lack?<br />
PM: What do we lack? I think we have mostly lacked adequate confidence<br />
in ourselves to be able to represent ourselves or to relate to other<br />
people and other nations as a fully developed culture. I think this is<br />
what we have lacked most. This is changing fortunately, it has<br />
changed, but we still have a way to change it. The fact that we can<br />
have a debate about this question, the fact that there is still a debate<br />
about the flag the flag of Australia with the flag of Great Britain in the<br />
corner means that we are not past this hump and we have to be to be<br />
a fully fledged confident nation.<br />
PA: So it is the cultural maturation process?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
PA: Simple as that.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
PA: I would like to thank my guest tonight. I would like to thank Cheryl<br />
Saunders and Frank Brennan and of course the Prime Minister.<br />
ends </p>
