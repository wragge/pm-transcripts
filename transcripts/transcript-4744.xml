FOR PRESS 30 June 1978<br />
More Staff for opposition<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, announced today that the<br />
Government had decided to increase by 10 to 44 the size of<br />
the pool of staff available to assist the Opposition. He<br />
has written to the Acting Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bowen,<br />
informing him of this decision.<br />
Mr Fraser said that, in coming to this decision, the Government<br />
had given co-sderation both to the Remuneration Tribunal's<br />
1978 Review and to submissions received relating to the<br />
problems beizia faced by both Government and opposition party<br />
committees 1-carrying out their Parliamentary duties without<br />
staffing ass--stance.<br />
In regard to that aspect of the Remuneration's Tribunal's<br />
Review relating to staff for shadow ministers, the Government<br />
had the view that these should be understood as being<br />
recommendatory. It noted the established procedure whereby<br />
the Government of the day has the responsibility of determining<br />
the numbers and classifications of staff for the Opposition.<br />
The question of salary levels for electorate secretaries and<br />
-electorate or legislative assistants, also dealt with in the<br />
Review, was a matter for the Public Service Board, since<br />
these staff are employed under the Public Service Act, and<br />
the Board has the matter under consideration. The continued<br />
provision of such staff to Senators and Members was, of course,<br />
not in question.<br />
As is already the case, it will be for the Leader of the<br />
opposition to decide how the total staff available to the<br />
opposition is to be allocated, including shadow ministers<br />
and party committees.<br />
Mr Fraser said that the Government proposes to provide five<br />
staff to service the Government party committees.<br />
" The decision to significantly increase the Opposition's staff<br />
entitlements will be seen as generous in ' the light of the<br />
difficult budgetary outlook, and as a contribution to the<br />
effective f-' unctioning of Parliamentary democracy," Mr Fraser said. </p>
