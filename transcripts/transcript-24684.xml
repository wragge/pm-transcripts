    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government will contribute $4 million to redevelop the Redcliffe Dolphins Stadium.</p>
<p>It’s an investment in jobs, growth and the local community.</p>
<p>Already, the Dolphins precinct is the second biggest employer on the Redcliffe Peninsular.  The upgrade will generate hundreds of additional jobs – not only construction positions but also new, on-going jobs in hospitality, marketing, cleaning and maintenance.</p>
<p>The club is an important part of the community. Rugby, hockey and soccer teams play and train on its ovals.</p>
<p>The new stadium will be able to accommodate 10,000 people. There will be covered seating, upgraded change rooms and a recreation area for schools and junior player camps.</p>
<p>Sports teams and their fans won’t be the only beneficiaries. The upgrade is part of a long‐term plan to create a precinct on Brisbane’s northside that will be able to host concerts and trade shows.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth contribution will supplement funding from the Dolphins and the Moreton Bay Regional Council.</p>
<p>Luke Howarth has been a passionate advocate of the project. Nearly two thousand people have signed a petition asking for Commonwealth assistance and the Government is proud to be able to deliver it.</p>
