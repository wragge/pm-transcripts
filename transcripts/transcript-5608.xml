EMBARGO: 5. O00 pm<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, JUNE 21 1981<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The meetings between the Commonwealth and the states on Friday<br />
and Saturday were important and productive. I believe that<br />
the decisions that we reached are the right ones for Australia-. as<br />
a whole and.. for each state at this time. The decisions will<br />
have considerable ramifications and benefits for all Australians.<br />
Perhaps the most important issue was the level of borrowings<br />
for Government projects. For some time the Commonwealth has<br />
believed that in the interests of private individuals, of<br />
home builders, farmers and small businesses, governments<br />
should pull back on their borrowing requirements. To<br />
understand this it is vital to realise that in the end there<br />
is only one source of funds for borrowing. When a family<br />
seeks a loan of some tens of thousands of dollars for a house<br />
and when _ a _ goveinme'rt seeks -a loan fora _ few hundred million<br />
dollars for some project that it has in mind, the funds for<br />
both applications, if indeed sufficient funds are available,<br />
must ultimately come from the same source, and that source<br />
is not unlimited.<br />
If Governments want to borrow say, $ 500 million that would<br />
mean other things being equal, that some 20,000 fewer home<br />
loans of $ 25,000 would be available. This example 4. q obviously<br />
an over-simplification, but it does highlight<br />
why the Commonwealth wants to limit borrowing by governments.<br />
In addition the people who do get home loans in a tight<br />
borrowing market may have to pay a high interest rate for them.<br />
For interest rates represent the price of borrowing and as in<br />
any other market if demand exceeds-supply the price of borrowing<br />
money must rise.<br />
I believe that all governments have a responsibility to seek<br />
a balanced programme of economic development in Australia.<br />
Each state government of course has its own particular<br />
respbnsibilities and it is entirely proper thAt each Premier<br />
should put his own state's case with the greatest strength.<br />
There is healthy competition in this. The Commonwealth<br />
Government, by its very nature, has a wider perspective. It<br />
must consider not only its own requirements, and not only the<br />
competing requirements of the states, but als-o the competing<br />
demands between the private sector and government requirements<br />
in their totality. The Commonwealth oa the overwhelming<br />
responsibility to do whll f'is right foi; Aust'ralia as a whole. </p>
<p>2<br />
I understand well that many people wish that Premiers'<br />
Conferences could be conducted with a greater appearance of<br />
co-operatioff.-* ut it needs to be realised that the Commonwealth's<br />
resistznce to a number of state bids for funds and borrowings<br />
is not a resistance designed to weaken the states and advantage<br />
the Commonwealth, but rather to attain overall balance, and to<br />
make sure that taxpayers generally, including small businesses<br />
and homebuyers, have their interests protected.<br />
An equally important item discussed at the meetings was the<br />
Grants Commission Report on Relativities between the states,<br />
which I referred to a few weeks ago. It is now well-known<br />
that this report has recommended a greater share of Commonweal-th<br />
grants for some states, including Victoria, and a smaller<br />
share for others. The Commonwealth recognised that substantial<br />
expectations had been built-up that some action would be taken<br />
to give the states who would benefit from the Report's<br />
conclusionsat least a part of what they saw as their new<br />
entitlements. At the same time, neither the Commonwealth nor<br />
the other states could bear the full cost of immediately<br />
implementing substantial changes. The Commonwealth also<br />
recognised that some states had genuine concerns about the<br />
precise recommendations made in the report, concerns based on<br />
doubts about the data available to the Commission, and about<br />
the methodology it used.<br />
The Commonwealth accordingly proposed, and the states accepted,<br />
two initiatives that represent a responsible and equitable<br />
approach to--the-report----First-, in recognition of the legitimate<br />
expectations of the states whose grants would increase if the<br />
Report were implemented the Commonwealth has provided an<br />
additional payment for 1981-82 of $ 60 million, to be divided<br />
between New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. Justice<br />
and fairness required that some payment be made to these states,<br />
without imposing impossible burdens on the other states.<br />
Second, in recognition of the many concerns expressed about the<br />
Report's conclusions, it has been agreed that the Grants<br />
Cdmmission should be asked to undertake a review of its<br />
conclusions, with the states being given an opportunity<br />
to present their arguments about its methodology. We<br />
expect to receive the results of this further review as<br />
early as possible next year.<br />
I believe-that all states agree that this outcome is appropriate<br />
and fair in the light of the reasonably held expectations of<br />
some, and the equally reasonably held concerns of others.<br />
It was also my pleasure, at the end of the Conference, to<br />
issue a joint statement with Lindsay Thompsor announcing<br />
that the Commonwealth will be making a gift of $ 5 million to<br />
Victoria, as a contribution to the celebration of the<br />
sesqui-centennial of the first settlenent in Victoria, by the<br />
Hentys at Portland, followed a year later by the settlement<br />
at Melbourne. The grant follows discussions with the Chairman<br />
of the Sesqui-centennial Committee, Sir John Holland. The<br />
Commonwealth wishes the gift to be associated with an identifiable<br />
and suitable project aiO further discussions will be held to<br />
determine the nature of this project. </p>
