SIR J0H19 MONASH CENTENARY<br />
HELD AT I4ONASH STATUE, LNLITHGOJ AENU,<br />
MELBOURNE 11TH APRIL, 1i96k5<br />
Speech bZ the Prime Minipter, the Rt. Hogkbet enz es<br />
Sir, Mrs, Bennett and Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Itts a great, though I fear an undeserved, honour<br />
for me to be allowed to speak to you today about one of the very<br />
greatest men of our time. The Chairman has said kind things<br />
about me. He might have multiplied them four times and still<br />
have understated the case for Sir John Monash.<br />
It was my good fortune to know Sir John Monash in<br />
the last period of' his life. Itts quite simple for me to say<br />
to you that he has various memorials., He has an assured place<br />
in military history$ a place founded not only on his brilliant<br />
understanding of the art and science of war, but also on his<br />
unsurpassed capacity for communicating his ideas; in other<br />
words, his advocacy in the greatest sense. That is one secure<br />
place, an overwhelmixrVsecure place that he has in our history.<br />
In the second place, he has a secure position in<br />
the industrial development of this State. His work for the<br />
Electricity Commission, his utter command of it, his lively<br />
capacity for telling politicians where they got off and where<br />
they got on, this contributed so much to the ultimate development<br />
of the KLectricity Commission, now spreading or spread<br />
all over the State of Victoria, that I am perfectly certain<br />
that in that field alone he would never be forgotten.<br />
He had, and has, a secure place in the educational<br />
history of Australia. I remember years ago there was an appeal<br />
being made on behalf of the University of Melbourne, my own<br />
old university, and I was there not, I am happy to tell you,<br />
as a speaker but as a highly interested listener and Sir<br />
John Monash made the principal speech. WVhen he had finished<br />
I turned to my neighbour, whoever it wasand said, " You know,<br />
whatever else in his favour may be said about John Monash, he<br />
is the finest advocate I ever listened to." 1 T hiLs wa s a<br />
tremendous attribute of his. Tremendously involved as I have<br />
briefly indicated in his own magnificent achievements in war, he<br />
was a great advocate. He was a great advocate who knew how to<br />
think who worked out his thoughts and who could then present<br />
them to other people with such compulsion, such persuasion<br />
that they began to wonder why they hadn't thought of it<br />
themselves. He was I venture to say a s one not without some<br />
experience in the field of advocacy, the greatest advocate<br />
I ever listened to,<br />
And on top of that, his name has been honoured in the<br />
creation of the university which bears his name tand therefore<br />
he has a secure place in educational history. Itwas a most<br />
brilliant stroket if I may say so, Chancellor, when this<br />
university was named after him because for a century or two<br />
centuries or three centuries to come, young men and women will<br />
be found to say$ " W1hy was this university named after this<br />
man?" and they will then learn something about him, and in<br />
that sense his great soaring spirit, his superb qualities will<br />
be memorialised for centuries to come. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
And in the fourth place I hope I will be<br />
allowed to mention this. He has this splendid memorial in<br />
bronze, one of our treasures, a constant reminder in this<br />
area which is, in itself full of history of the man who<br />
made more history than most of us will ever be privileged to<br />
make, And so, Sir, he has the enduring respect and<br />
gratitude of all who lived in his time and of all who will read<br />
of him with intelligence and understanding.<br />
I said something just now about his quality of<br />
advocacy. I got to know him a little in that capacity. It<br />
may not be known to many of you but at one stage in his life,<br />
he being the most versatile of people, he was a patent<br />
attorney. I have always thought this was something of a<br />
sideline because he was above all things, a most distinguished<br />
engineer. But in a number of cases in the patent side of the<br />
law, he was called as an expert witness. Now, we had a very<br />
great judicial laiwyer in Victoria in my earlier days, the late<br />
Sir Leo Cussen, perhaps the greatest judicial lawyer we ever<br />
had on our own Supreme Court, and it was well reported that<br />
Cussen had more than once said this was one of' the legends<br />
at the Bar in my time that any solicitor who failed to<br />
retain John Monash as an expert in any patent matter was prima<br />
facie guilty of negligence. Now this was not a rash statement<br />
made by a rash man but a very wise statement made by a very<br />
wise man. I tell It to you because it serves to recall to me,<br />
and I hope will recall to you, the astonishing versatility of<br />
this great man, his immense virtuosity in whatever he touched<br />
and that utter integrity of mind and force of personality which<br />
conveyed with everything he said the stamp of truth and of<br />
conviction. I had another experience I hope you will allow<br />
me to recall it, I was, as you have been reminded, for a little<br />
time in the Legislative Council, a happy state of affairs from<br />
which I have long since escaped. And while I was there, I<br />
was the junior honorary Minister in the McPherson Government,<br />
and next to me was the other honorary Minister, the late Ted<br />
Morley whom some of you knew who was Member for Barwon.<br />
Well, up came a proposal from the Electricity<br />
Commission from Sir John himself about some extension about<br />
some trifling expenditure of Li1M. or something of that kind<br />
which was in those days quite a lot of money, and we rejected<br />
it. It was knocked out by the Cabinet, and the word went outyou<br />
know how things do get out the word went out and it came<br />
down to the S. E. C. and Sir John put his hat on, came up to the<br />
top of Spring Street, arrived at the outer doors of the Cabinet<br />
Room and if I kniow anything about him, demanded admittance.<br />
Anyhow, the word came in that Sir John was outside,<br />
The Premier, that most delightful and amiable of<br />
men, Sir William McPherson said, " Oh, yes. Bring him in", and<br />
he came in and we all stool up instinctively. Wte all stood<br />
up. Ile were in the presence of a man we knew was a greater man<br />
than we would ever be, and we stood up and he was given a seat<br />
at the table. Other people responsible for branches of the<br />
civil service of this State usually sat in the second row and<br />
spoke when they were spoken to but, no Sir John was strong<br />
on this matter. He was given a seat at the table. He looked<br />
round towards the Premier and said, " Jell, Mr. Premier, I gather<br />
that the Cabinet has rejected my proposal." " Well, yes, I<br />
a* e. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
think that's right) Sir Johia." He said, "' 4ellp that can only<br />
be because they have failed utterly to understand it. I will<br />
now explain it." He sat there with that rock-like look, and<br />
he explained it and one by one, we shrivelled in our places;<br />
one by one, we ? Xcame convinced, or at any rate, felt that we<br />
were convinced of the error of our ways, and for half an hour<br />
he went on. He explained this thing step by step by step atid<br />
we were left silent. It is quite true that my friend and<br />
colleague, Ted Morley started impulsively to put a question<br />
and said, in his exciiement, " Now look, John," and 1 ickedly-<br />
I have always been a trifle impudent said, " No, come Ted,<br />
come come, V~ hy dont you call him Jack?" And that settled it.<br />
There was no more, not another word came out. And so Sir<br />
John said, looking at the Premier " Wtell, Sir, I take it that<br />
your decision is reversed and thaZ I now have approval for<br />
my proposal and so that there will be no delay, I have brought<br />
with me the Order-in-Council that will be necessary for this<br />
purpose. He pulled it out of his breast pocket, passed it<br />
around, it was signed and he went out.<br />
Now I know that there are mixed feelings about<br />
political people who are supposed to have all sorts of almost<br />
endemic disqualifications but that is the only time in my<br />
l. ife when I knew a man come in from outside into a Cabinet<br />
and utterly reverse a decision which, at the time he arrived,<br />
had been unanimous, I mention that because I thin. k that this<br />
is something that must have characterised him all his life.<br />
He didntt arrive at conclusions hastily, He<br />
burned the midnight oil. He was reputed to live with a<br />
dictaphone alongside his bed so that if he woke up during<br />
the night, he could dictate a few notes of one kind or another.<br />
He was never guilty of coming to any task inadequately prepared,<br />
This characterised him, I am sure, in every aspect of his<br />
l~ ife, but above all things having done that, he had the force<br />
of character, the utter integrity, the persuasiveness of<br />
language, the clarity of vision which enabled him to take<br />
all the Ideas that he had and put them clearly into the minds<br />
of other people. if you look back over the whole of his<br />
life, I am sure you will agree with me that this remarkable<br />
gift was not his greatest gift but it was a gift ix-rithout which<br />
his even greater gifts might not have found their full effect.<br />
And so Sir, I am most honoured to be here. It<br />
is a wonderful priN4lege for me who happens to be, and who has<br />
been for some time, the Head of the Government of the Commonwealth<br />
of Australia to be able to come here and say a few simple<br />
but honest words about a man who is beyond question one of the<br />
very great men in my life and in yours. It is a great privilege<br />
for us in this city to have had this man among us. It is a great<br />
privilege for this State to have contributed to the life of<br />
Australia and to the life of the world the services of so<br />
notable a man. Sir, I thank you indeed for the opportunity of<br />
speaking today. I would hesitate to describe what I have said<br />
to you as an oration. On the contrary, what I have set out to do<br />
is to convey to you with perfect simplicity and sincerity my<br />
deep feelings about this great and famous man. </p>
