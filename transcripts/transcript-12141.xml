    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was saddened to hear of the death earlier today of Sir Arthur Tange at the age of 86.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur was a very distinguished public servant.  He was Secretary of the then External Affairs Department for some 11 years (1954-65) and of Defence from 1970 to 1979.  He was the only person to have headed both these departments.  He was Australian High Commissioner to India from 1965 to 1970.</p>
<p>Born in Sydney, he was educated at Gosford High School and the University of Western Australia.  He joined the External Affairs Department during World War II.  Sir Arthur was a key player in the evolution of Australia's foreign and defence policies over three decades.  He was at the forefront of policy development over issues such as the decolonisation of West New Guinea, the birth of Malaysia and the development of Australian policy towards Asia.</p>
<p>At Defence, Sir Arthur presided over the integration of separate service and supply departments into the present-day Department of Defence.</p>
<p>A man of independent thought and strong commitment to Australia, Sir Arthur will long be remembered as one of Australia's finest public servants.</p>
<p>I extend my deepest sympathies to Sir Arthur's widow, Lady Tange, his son Chris, daughter Jenny, and their families.</p>
