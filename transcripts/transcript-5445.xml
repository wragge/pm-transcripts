WESTERN AUSTRALIAN DROUGHT ASSISTANCE<br />
TO PRIMARY PRODUCERS<br />
The Prime Minister today announced that following con 4aEj~<br />
of an approach from the Premier, -the Commonwealth Government<br />
has agreed to provide further drought assistance to<br />
Western Australia.<br />
Mr. Fraser said that the Commonwealth has agreed to the<br />
financing of freight subsidies under the Natural Disaster<br />
Relief arrangements in the State's drought-affected central<br />
wheatbelt region, for the transportof stock to and from<br />
agistment and for the transport of fodder.<br />
Mr. Fraser also said that the Commonwealth is deeply<br />
concerned at the suffering being experienced by farmers and<br />
pastoralists in Western Australia whose continued livelihood<br />
is being affected by what has been described by many as the<br />
worst drought in the State's history. The Commonwealth<br />
Government's decision in this matter is tangible evidence of<br />
its willingness to provide assistance to those in time<br />
of need. 000---J-16079y F14C </p>
