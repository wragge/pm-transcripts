<p>MCKENZIE: </p>
<p>Prime Minister John Howard, welcome to North Queensland once again.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you. Very good to be here.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>Actually it's been more frequent, the visits in recent times.</p>
<p>   You've been in that seat many, many times. You've taken</p>
<p>   open line calls before so it will be interesting to hear who wants</p>
<p>   talk to you this morning and what they want to talk about. I'd</p>
<p>   like to talk about some local issues. Firstly, why are you up here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I've come here to open the RAAF Base Scherger which</p>
<p>   is near Weipa. And this is the last of the trilogy of northern air</p>
<p>   bases which were planned to be established a few years ago. It's</p>
<p>   a very large base. It will have a capacity for about 1500 defence</p>
<p>   personnel. I'm very happy to say that the base and all the</p>
<p>   arrangements for it have been developed in direct and very harmonious</p>
<p>   discussion and cooperation with the local Aboriginal community and</p>
<p>   no intervention of bureaucratic bodies or anything, there's</p>
<p>   just been direct negotiation between the Air Force and the Aboriginal</p>
<p>   people and they're very supportive of the Base. It's a</p>
<p>   very important link in Australia's northern defences and I'm</p>
<p>   very proud to be officiating at it. I think defence remains a very</p>
<p>   important thing for Australia and I'll tell the gathering that</p>
<p>   it was the one area that was utterly and completely quarantined</p>
<p>   from any budget cuts when we came to power in 1996. I put a circle</p>
<p>   around it and said former governments have cut defence far enough</p>
<p>   and we weren't prepared to go any further.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>It's interesting, that decision having been made back in,</p>
<p>   what, the late 1980s I presume, what would have then been the Hawke</p>
<p>   Government, the conditions that prevail today, as far as our national</p>
<p>   security is concerned, would be much different from those days.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but not in a sense that makes it a bad decision. If anything,</p>
<p>   the changed circumstances reinforce the wisdom of having this greater</p>
<p>   flexibility in relation to our northern defences.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>I want to talk to you about the GST and you've kindly agreed,</p>
<p>   off air a few minutes ago, to talk, I suppose, obviously in generic</p>
<p>   terms Â you can't get into the detail, we won't know</p>
<p>   that for another week, a week tomorrow Â but in general terms</p>
<p>   and, of course, there's the local application which is what</p>
<p>   you obviously would want to address today. The tourism industry,</p>
<p>   how are you going to appease them? They're very concerned it's</p>
<p>   going to have a detrimental impact on the tourist numbers here.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it won't. It won't. I'm not going to talk</p>
<p>   specifics but the total plan, which is much more than a GST, will</p>
<p>   be of enormous benefit to the tourist industry. I'll tell you</p>
<p>   why it will be of enormous benefit to any industry, because it is</p>
<p>   going to reduce their input costs. And one of the great virtues</p>
<p>   of a big change to the tax system and the introduction of a goods</p>
<p>   and services tax and the replacement of existing indirect taxes</p>
<p>   is that you can get rebates of tax off your inputs. You can't</p>
<p>   do that at the moment. I mean, this is going to be of enormous benefit</p>
<p>   to Australian exporters. This is a change that exporters have wanted</p>
<p>   for years. And we are going to see in Australia, as a result of</p>
<p>   this plan being introduced, the next important building block towards</p>
<p>   making the Australian economy stronger and better. It's not</p>
<p>   just something out there on its own. And the reason we're doing</p>
<p>   it is that it will further strengthen the Australian economy in</p>
<p>   a very difficult world environment. We can't, in the face of</p>
<p>   what's happening in Asia, we can't sort of say it's</p>
<p>   too hard, we'll stop, let me get off, let's put a cocoon</p>
<p>   around Australia, let's pretend that we don't live in</p>
<p>   a competitive world. You can't do that. You really do have</p>
<p>   to keep pushing ahead and offering the Australian people something</p>
<p>   better and something that will better secure their future.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>It's funny, you've got to speak to the Australian people</p>
<p>   still in fundamentals when it comes to a GST. It's very funny.</p>
<p>   I saw a survey last week and I think they said 60 per cent of Australians</p>
<p>   now would acquiesce to a GST but only if there were concessions.</p>
<p>   Well, ever since it was ever mooted back in the 1980s there were</p>
<p>   always concessions, there were always tax concessions.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think some people are a little stung, particularly of the</p>
<p>   experience of the former government in 1993 when it campaigned against</p>
<p>   John Hewson's tax package. You know what it promised, it said</p>
<p>   no GST but we'll give you the personal income tax cuts. When</p>
<p>   it won the election it cancelled half the personal income tax cuts</p>
<p>   and it increased all of the existing indirect taxes. So, I guess</p>
<p>   people still remember that. Now, I ask those people to accept that</p>
<p>   it is now a different government. We are open enough and honest</p>
<p>   enough and upfront enough to put our plan to them before the election,</p>
<p>   not afterward but before, and if they don't like it, well,</p>
<p>   they won't support it. But if they have a look at it they'll</p>
<p>   see that its overall benefits are good for the country and fair</p>
<p>   to them.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>With Fightback, of course, I think you had nearly a couple of years,</p>
<p>   didn't you, to look at it? How long was Fightback released</p>
<p>   before you...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Fightback was released in November '91 and we had the</p>
<p>   election in March '93. So that was a long period of time.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>A long period of time and in the early stages, very popular.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very popular, because it was seen as a plan. Now, what we'll</p>
<p>   be unveiling next week won't be Fightback, it will be its own</p>
<p>   presentation. But it will be a change to the whole system. It won't</p>
<p>   be a new tax, it will be a new tax system. It will be a plan to</p>
<p>   further strengthen the Australian economy and it will obviously</p>
<p>   contain reductions in personal income tax. I said that a year ago</p>
<p>   and I say to the people listening to this programme, look at the</p>
<p>   whole plan, don't just look at one thing in isolation, look</p>
<p>   at all of it together. Don't just see it as a goods and services</p>
<p>   tax, see it as a total plan. Now, it's an honest attempt to</p>
<p>   reform a ramshackle system. Now, if we can't persuade the Australian</p>
<p>   people to support it, then we have to accept that verdict. But we</p>
<p>   will have tried to do something to help Australia. I really do believe</p>
<p>   Australia will be a better and stronger country, economically, if</p>
<p>   the Australian people vote for this plan. But if they don't,</p>
<p>   well, I have to accept that judgement and I will.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>It must be very interesting for you to hear the humourous rumours</p>
<p>   coming out everyday in the media. I mean, no one knows the detail</p>
<p>   yet, obviously you're having a quiet chuckle to yourself, but</p>
<p>   the pressure groups are in there already clamouring for concessions,</p>
<p>   they don't want the GST applying to food or to rent, and they</p>
<p>   haven't seen the fine-print yet.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, well, that always happens and it indicates the enormous public</p>
<p>   interest in the plan and that, in one sense, is good. There's</p>
<p>   nothing I can do about the speculation. It is only speculation and</p>
<p>   none of it has been put out by us. It's pure speculation. I</p>
<p>   won't comment on any element of it but I just make the point</p>
<p>   that it's pure speculation.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>And you're obviously a lot more confident in this than you</p>
<p>   ever were in Fightback!. I mean, you're oozing confidence,</p>
<p>   your Ministers came out the other day oozing confidence.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am confident about this because I believe it is a good plan for</p>
<p>   Australia and that's what really matters. If something is good</p>
<p>   for Australia and if it's fair to people, then I believe you</p>
<p>   can win support for it.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>And if it's easy to understand. Is this easy to understand?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. Well, yes, it will be quite easy to understand, quite easy.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>All right. I want to take you on to another local issue now and</p>
<p>   that's this situation of federation funding. I know, look,</p>
<p>   it's very much a local issue and you may not have been briefed</p>
<p>   on it. We've got an esplanade...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I'm aware of the esplanade, yes.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>...already $5 million from the previous Government. They also</p>
<p>   proffered another</p>
<p>   $4 million to be available if they won the election. And the Labor</p>
<p>   Party now, well, the Labor Government is talking about not providing</p>
<p>   that $4 million. The local Mayor, Tom Pyne, who is, himself, a life</p>
<p>   member of the Labor Party, coincidentally, is very angry about that.</p>
<p>   He feels that $9 million total should be available from the State</p>
<p>   government. And then, on that basis, he was confident of another</p>
<p>   $9 million possibly being forthcoming...federation funding from</p>
<p>   your Government.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there are a lot of requests on the Federation Fund. The only</p>
<p>   thing I can do is to say that it will be considered along with all</p>
<p>   the other requests we've got, and we have got hundreds from</p>
<p>   all over Australia, hundreds. We will consider it. I don't</p>
<p>   want to say and I can't say any more than that.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>All right. I don't know if you want to comment on the Local</p>
<p>   Government Associations across Australia Â he's the Queensland</p>
<p>   Chairman of the Local Government Association - very concerned that</p>
<p>   the GST would be seen as a tax on a tax, they're seeing it</p>
<p>   as a tax on a tax.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I invite them, like everybody else, to hold their fire, have</p>
<p>   a look at the whole plan when it's released and then make a</p>
<p>   judgement. And if it's looked at fairly people will support</p>
<p>   it because it will be the next element in strengthening the Australian</p>
<p>   economy. It will be the next logical step to give Australia further</p>
<p>   protection and strength against a more difficult world.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>Actually, last time you were in the studio we briefly discussed</p>
<p>   these proposed reforms to the Child Support Agency system in Australia</p>
<p>   too. I've talked to Warren Entsch about this recently. There</p>
<p>   have been some modifications, apparently, but the main thrust seems</p>
<p>   to have been postponed because he said, obviously with the new change,</p>
<p>   the new tax package, the whole thing will have to be revisited anyway</p>
<p>   and those reforms that he's been hoping for should be part</p>
<p>   of those deliberations, of these changes, the new tax package reform.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, without, once again, going into detail, anything of this</p>
<p>   kind does need to be looked at against the background of changed</p>
<p>   arrangements concerning taxation. Warren has pushed very hard for</p>
<p>   reform in this area and relief for people who believe they're</p>
<p>   being adversely affected by it. It is a difficult area and it does</p>
<p>   arouse tremendous feeling and passion on both sides. It's a</p>
<p>   very difficult issue and I don't believe you will ever get</p>
<p>   a system that everybody feels happy about. My electorate office</p>
<p>   in Sydney gets an enormous number of complaints from my constituents</p>
<p>   about how this operates.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>More than on anything else I would imagine, similar to this.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is very....because you're dealing here with personal</p>
<p>   feelings, raw emotions, the sense of grievance that people feel</p>
<p>   when a marriage breaks down and the sheer financial difficulty of</p>
<p>   trying to support two households. I mean, it's very difficult</p>
<p>   to support one household on an ordinary income. But if you're</p>
<p>   obliged to support two, it's very, very tough and I understand</p>
<p>   that. On the other hand, the community's entitled to say that</p>
<p>   if people bring children into the world, they have some responsibility</p>
<p>   to look after them. And trying to balance those two considerations</p>
<p>   is very difficult.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>That's only the area of the formula that seems to be the main</p>
<p>   concern but we won't go into that now because obviously that</p>
<p>   will have to await the release of the tax package. Just while we're</p>
<p>   on the tax package for a moment - the Nationals' State Director,</p>
<p>   Ken Crook, has said over the weekend that the Senate wouldn't</p>
<p>   pass a GST anyway and I thought is that too premature to be saying</p>
<p>   that, how do you feel about him having said that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, of course it is. I won't respond specifically, I don't</p>
<p>   give running commentaries on what State secretaries of parties say.</p>
<p>   But the Government will put the plan before the Australian people</p>
<p>   and we will be asking the Australian people at the next election,</p>
<p>   whenever it is held, to give the Coalition a mandate, not only in</p>
<p>   the House of Representatives but also in the Senate. And we'll</p>
<p>   be going flat-out to win very strong public support for the plan.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>Just one simple question Â will anybody be worse off under</p>
<p>   this tax package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Tax cheats will be worse off.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>Nobody else.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't believe anybody, when you look at the generality of</p>
<p>   the package, will be worse off except tax cheats.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>One area that's probably an area of some disdain to you, I</p>
<p>   suppose, One Nation and its figures, once again, I think figures</p>
<p>   out today showing something like above 25 per cent in Western Australia,</p>
<p>   18 per cent in Queensland. It was interesting on 60 Minutes</p>
<p>   on Sunday night, they had a representative of Labor, Nationals,</p>
<p>   Liberal Party, there and Graham Richardson came out with something</p>
<p>   I thought was interesting. He said, look, all of these things that</p>
<p>   all of you disaffected voters are upset about can be fixed by government,</p>
<p>   whether it be a Labor government or a Coalition government, they</p>
<p>   can be addressed, he said, but not by all this, not by all this</p>
<p>   shouting and ranting. Is it too difficult for you to find out what</p>
<p>   these disaffected voters, for example, in Queensland, are upset</p>
<p>   about and go about addressing those concerns one by one?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what you do John is, incidentally, you don't do what</p>
<p>   those three people did and engage in that sort of thing on 60</p>
<p>   Minutes. I wouldn't have done that but that's their</p>
<p>   decision. I think that's quite counterproductive. What you</p>
<p>   do in response to One Nation Â and I'm speaking on behalf</p>
<p>   of the Coalition Government which I lead Â what you do in response</p>
<p>   to One Nation is not search around for some magic formula to knock</p>
<p>   it out of the ring. What you do is, you just offer the Australian</p>
<p>   public something better. My response to my political opponents,</p>
<p>   and I've got two opponents, I've got Kim Beazley and I've</p>
<p>   got Pauline Hanson and I've got others who are against me,</p>
<p>   and my response is to offer the Australian public something better.</p>
<p>And could I also, while on the subject of One Nation, say that</p>
<p>   people who engage in violent demonstrations against One Nation are</p>
<p>   doing One Nation an enormous service. Let me repeat that, you could</p>
<p>   almost imagine that those demonstrators in Ipswich last night were</p>
<p>   being paid by One Nation. I thought it was the most ridiculous demonstration</p>
<p>   in a long line of ridiculous demonstrations. And those people are,</p>
<p>   themselves, doing violence to the democratic process when they engage</p>
<p>   in violence and I think the sight of elderly people being obstructed</p>
<p>   and bashed and prevented from attending meetings is wrong, it is</p>
<p>   anti-democratic and it plays into the hands of the simplistic nostrums</p>
<p>   of the One Nation Party. So, can I just say, as an individual Australian</p>
<p>   as well as Prime Minister, violent demonstrations have no part in</p>
<p>   Australian democratic life. People who engage in them are helping</p>
<p>   the people against whom the demonstrations are directed and they</p>
<p>   are doing their own cause immense disservice. And I can only believe</p>
<p>   that many of the people involved in those demonstrations, that their</p>
<p>   purpose is really to do damage to the Government by bolstering the</p>
<p>   stocks of One Nation.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>Interesting to hear Liberal MP, Tony Abbott, over the weekend,</p>
<p>   virtually echoing the words of former Premier, Rob Borbidge, before</p>
<p>   that last disastrous election for him, he said One Nation will deliver</p>
<p>   government to Labor if it holds that 15 per cent support level,</p>
<p>   well, in fact, today it's up around 18 per cent in Queensland,</p>
<p>   between 25 per cent and 30 per cent in Western Australia. Is that</p>
<p>   how you see it, they are virtually delivering government to Labor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I believe the Coalition will win the next election. I believe it</p>
<p>   will. I have a very confident view about the next election but not</p>
<p>   a smug or complacent view. I don't underestimate the challenge</p>
<p>   but I am very confident that we are going to win. But the answer</p>
<p>   to Labor, the answer to One Nation, the answer to all of our political</p>
<p>   opponents is that the Liberal and National parties have to offer</p>
<p>   the Australian public something better. And what we will be offering</p>
<p>   in the tax plan will be something better. We'll be offering</p>
<p>   people a better tax system, a stronger economy, a fairer tax system.</p>
<p>   Now, that is what the public wants. We shouldn't engage in</p>
<p>   endless debate about the role of One Nation or the role of any political</p>
<p>   party. They have a right, she has a right to go around the country</p>
<p>   putting her point of view, like I have. That's not an issue</p>
<p>   as far as I'm concerned, it's what she says and what she</p>
<p>   stands for. It's what I stand for and what my Government stands</p>
<p>   for that really matters.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, could you put the headphones on for a moment. We're</p>
<p>   going to take some open-line calls now. All the lines are jammed</p>
<p>   at the moment so if you could just hold off for a few moments. Go</p>
<p>   ahead.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hello there.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes, I was wondering, in the new tax plan, what will happen for</p>
<p>   people who are working overtime or are working a second job in order</p>
<p>   to help their families out?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the only answer I can give you at this stage is that there</p>
<p>   will be reductions in personal income tax under the plan, reductions</p>
<p>   in personal income tax. I can't really give a more precise</p>
<p>   answer to your question without going into detail of that that I</p>
<p>   can't, at this stage, disclose. But I can assure you that the</p>
<p>   overall impact of the changes in personal income tax will be to</p>
<p>   give greater incentive to people who want to work harder.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good. Because when I left high school I worked in a job where guys</p>
<p>   worked 12-hour days and they got crib and tea money for doing that,</p>
<p>   their four hours overtime, but their four hours overtime just went</p>
<p>   to tax and they ended up with...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you have a look at the plan when it comes out next week.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>MCKENZIE:</p>
<p>Next call. Go ahead.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Oh hello, John.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>It's Robyn.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, Robyn.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I'm interesting in tax deductions for students at university.</p>
<p>   I mean, up here we don't have a lot of choice. My son can do</p>
<p>   first year here but he has to go away next year.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You realise that under the Â I don't know what your income</p>
<p>   is and I don't want to ask you, it's your business Â</p>
<p>   but under the new Youth Allowance scheme he gets a much higher rate</p>
<p>   if he has to go away and live away from home as part of his study.</p>
<p>   Are you aware of that?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Well, who do I see about that. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you ring Warren Entsch about that and he'll give you</p>
<p>   all the details. But one of the features of the new Youth Allowance</p>
<p>   is that we have significantly increased the rate of the allowance,</p>
<p>   this is a common allowance now. It takes away the incentive that</p>
<p>   used to exist for people to go on the dole rather than study. And</p>
<p>   under this new allowance you can stay...you get a higher amount</p>
<p>   if you have to live away from home.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>But what...because the cut-off point for AUSTUDY's $36,000.</p>
<p>   I mean, you can hardly survive on $36,000. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>As I say, I don't...well, it's a matter for you whether</p>
<p>   you disclose your income, I'm just making the observation,</p>
<p>   if you were entitled to the Youth Allowance then you would be...</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>...but you can't claim any of your fees or anything as</p>
<p>   a tax...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, that is true, that is true.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
