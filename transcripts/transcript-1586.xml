RESULT CF R! T ' R'NDUMS<br />
Comment by the Frime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
On the aborigine question, I was delighted with the overwhelming<br />
vote in every State of the Commonwealth favouring the e~ mination of those<br />
references in the Constitution which smack of discrimination. The grant<br />
of power to the Commonwealth in relation to aborigines which follows from<br />
the vote will enable it to play a useful part in ensuring justice and social<br />
acceptance for people of the aboriginal race.<br />
The vote will not only help the aborigine, it will contribute to<br />
Australia's international standing by demonstrating to the outside world<br />
our overwhelming desire to give full acceptance to the aboriginal people<br />
within our community. The adverse vote on the nexus proposal, while not altogether<br />
surprisiUg, was disappointing. I said prior to the poll that a majority for<br />
NO would be a victory for prejudice and misrepresentation against calm<br />
reasoning and good sense. I still hold that view, and indeed, the detail<br />
of the vote tends to conf irm it.<br />
In New South W~ ales where political forces and press, generally<br />
speaking declared their support for a YES vote, a majority for YES appears<br />
to have been obtained. On the other hand, where press and political<br />
forces waged a campaign of misrepresentation based on prejudice, there<br />
has been a strong NO majority. It is never difficult to whip up opposition<br />
on the slogan " No More Politicians". The fact that the proposal put<br />
forward meant something very different was either ignored or imperfectly<br />
perceived. It seems clear that in the smaller States there was a fear that<br />
their role in the Federation would be diminished in a larger House of<br />
Representatives and an unchanged numerical strength in the Senate. W.. e<br />
attempted to meet this understandable concern by pointing out that each<br />
representative from the smaller States in the House of Representatives<br />
had voted in support of this proposal, and a large majority of Senators<br />
from the smaller States had similarly supported it.<br />
In fact, there was a unanimous majority in the House of<br />
Representatives in support of the YES proposal; there was an overwhelming<br />
majority 45-7 in favour of it in the Senate. It was strongly supported by<br />
the Trade Union movement. It was supported in every State by the<br />
organisation of the Liberal Party. It was supported by several newspapers<br />
which are generally regarded as ranking among the most thoughtful and<br />
responsible in Australia.<br />
The majority of electors chose to ignore the advice of those<br />
to whom they normally look for guidance on political issues. / 2 </p>

The outcome leaves some difficult problems. There is general<br />
agreement that there must be a redistribution of electorates before the next<br />
general election. Due to rapid growth in outer suburban areas of the<br />
capital cities, there are gross dispar~ ties between electorates in the same<br />
State and even in the same city. Some metropolitan electorates J n<br />
Victoria, for example, have only about 40G, 000 voters; others more than<br />
100, 0c, and with continuing population growth, the gaps are widening.<br />
There is an overwhelming case for a redistribution which will produce a more<br />
equitable balance. One conisequence of the varying rates of growth of population<br />
in different parts of the Commonwealth could be an actual reduction of<br />
seats in one or more States and, despite the degree of tolerance permitted<br />
to redistribution commissioners, in rural representation. These are<br />
problems which the Cabinet will have to study closely.<br />
S-' Iaturday's vote was not so much against the breaking of the<br />
nexus with the Senate as a vote against more politicians of the National<br />
Parliament. This view, however ill-advised we might regard it to be,<br />
nevertheless must be accepted as representing a strong persuasive force<br />
at least during the life of the present Farliament.<br />
I shall be consulting my colleagues after my return from<br />
overseas as to the course that should be followed.<br />
CANBERRA, 28th May, 19,67. </p>
