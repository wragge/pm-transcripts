FOR MEIA 2 MARCH 1989<br />
JOINT SMEMAEN1 WITH THE MINISTR FOR SCINC, CUSTOMS AND SMAL<br />
BUSINESS, THE lKCI BARRY JON~ ES<br />
The Government yesterday considered a submission on Australia's science<br />
and technology capacity from Barry Jones, the minister for Science,<br />
Customs and Small Business.<br />
The Government fully agreed to the Minister's proposals to develop a<br />
major Government statement on science and technology policy. This will<br />
be done as a matter of priority.<br />
The Government supported the broad thrust of the submission and agreed<br />
that Australia had to improve its scientific capacity greatly. The<br />
Government fully appreciates the vital role science must play in laying<br />
the foundation for Australia's future prosperity.<br />
In developing this statement the Government felt that input from the<br />
range of portfolios having major interests in science would be needed to<br />
reflect the full extent of Government involvement in scientific<br />
activity. In particular work currently underway on various initiatives<br />
in the Education, Employment and Training and the Primary Industry and<br />
Energy portfolios would need to be closely integrated into the<br />
development of the statement.<br />
overall responsibility for co-ordinating the statement would rest with<br />
Barry Jones while John Dawkins, would be involved with research in<br />
tertiary institutions.<br />
The Government decided that, although a substantial response was best<br />
made in the context of the statement, significant progress could be made<br />
in three areas.<br />
Firstly, the Government has accepted the principle that CSIRO, ANSTO and<br />
AIMS should be permitted to retain all external earnings. Accordingly<br />
CSIRO's budget is to be increased by $ 2.1m, $ 6.6m, and $ 11.6m<br />
respectively in 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91.<br />
Secondly, the Government will provide $ 8.4m in 1988-89 to upgrade<br />
equipment in Government research facilities. Mr Jones is releasing a<br />
separate statement on the equipment involved.<br />
Thirdly, the Government will establish a Science Co-ordinating Committee<br />
and appoint a Chief Science Advisor to chair it. The Advisor will<br />
report directly to Mr Jones. The Co-ordinating Committee will give<br />
particular attention to science issues extending beyond the<br />
responsibility of any one Government portfolio. </p>
