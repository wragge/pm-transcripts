PRIME MINISTER<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE LABOR HOUSE, BRISBANE, 24 OCTOBER, 1984<br />
E 9 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you are ndfdoubt aware of the<br />
latest opinion poll which shows that Andrew Peacock is less<br />
favoured as Opposition Leader than John Howard and even<br />
Malcolm Fraser. Can you see him going the same way as<br />
perhaps Bill Hayden did a few months ago.<br />
PM: Far be it for me to interfere in the problems of the<br />
Liberal Party. But it was interesting to see that John Howard<br />
and Malcolm Fraser were preferred in front of Mr Peacock and<br />
I found fascinating the interview with Mr Fraser. He obviously<br />
is thinking about coming back. He is not satisfied with the<br />
state of the Party thd~ t he abandoned. But that's a problem<br />
for them. I just as an interested spectator, watch the declino<br />
within the Liberal Party, the fight between the Liberal Party<br />
and the National Party, at the national level. And, of course,<br />
here in Queensland the fascinating picture of the distancing biy<br />
Ejelke-Petersen from the federals. They are a very unhappy<br />
bunch of pilgrims, and I am sure that the people of Queensland<br />
will draw the appropriate conclusion from the fact that as<br />
against the cohesive Labor Party team that is offered to them,<br />
you have got these brawling bunch of conservatives.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, do you have any-explanation for<br />
why the Labor Party intended vote fell 5% in the Morgan Gallup<br />
Poll and the conservative vote went up 3%.<br />
PM: I have said for some fime now that I thought that that<br />
which itself was a jump of 5 percentage points from 50, reflected<br />
some pretty immediate, unusual factors. I have felt that wheret<br />
we are now is a couple of points above where we were at the 19813<br />
election. And that's what today's poll shows. That would give us<br />
a significant increase in seats in the federal parliament. And I<br />
think we can probably inprove on that position during the campaign.<br />
JOURNALIST: * So you are not worried by that<br />
PM: Oh, if I had said that the St jump the previous week, taking<br />
us from 50 to 55, and I thought that's it, then of course I'd be<br />
worried. But having said when it happened. that that was an<br />
aberration, then by definition I am not worried by the return<br />
to the normal, which normal position has us significantly ahead<br />
of our position in 1983.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what are those pretty immediate,<br />
inusual factors that you mention. K </p>
<p>Fli oh, I think you had the concentration in the Parliament<br />
on the personal smear tactics that were being pursued by the<br />
Opposition. There were some personal factors involving myself<br />
at that time, and I think that these thing&amp; perhaps concentrated<br />
some attentipn then. But I made it quite clear at the time that<br />
X thought i~ at we'were running comfortably ahead of our position<br />
of 683. And that is wha t the position shows now, and I think that<br />
that will improv9. between now and December let.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you believe Malcolm Fraser has anything ufieful<br />
to offer the Australian political scene?<br />
PHI Well, ina some respects he has something useful to demonstrate<br />
to the Liberal Party in its current leadership because, and I said<br />
this at the time, Mr Fraser did have certain principles to which<br />
he adhered in the area of race and aborigines, I just mention those<br />
things. He took certain standards of p rinciple and he adhered to<br />
-hnmn. Now Mir Peacock, hio ctjgvocoor, ohowa ne preparedneee&amp;<br />
adhere Lo, pxiiuil1 at all, and it is little reason tor surprise<br />
therefore that you have the judgemuents being made about the<br />
current leader of the opposition and have this remarkabla posit-ion<br />
that rnot only does he have his deputy leader being ranked above<br />
him but his predecessor, who has left the Parliament, is being<br />
desired by more people as the leader than Mr Peacock.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well giving your thoughts on Malcolm Fraser's principles<br />
would you welcome his return?<br />
PM: Oh I was sorry about his departure. I would be happy to see<br />
him back. I mean, I felt a little bit cheated, if you like, at<br />
not having the opportunity of having the head to head in the<br />
Parliament. JOURNALIST: Prime minister, given the call for Senator Button's<br />
removal from his portfolio<br />
PM: By whom?<br />
JOURNALIST; Are you satisfied..<br />
PM: By one official New South Wales official of a federal branch.<br />
I mean, I just want to got clear the enormity of the demand, the<br />
breadth of the demand for Iris removal.<br />
JOURNALIST: Given -that, can you give5 a guarantee that he will<br />
retain that portfolio?<br />
PM: Of course I can. I mean I have got to say, first of all,<br />
that the processes of the caucuses have to be followed. I am<br />
assuming that he will be re-elected by the caucuses and of<br />
course he will. And I think he has done exceptionally well<br />
in that area.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there is a report in the paper<br />
today about an opinion poll on the Nuclear Disarmament Party<br />
which shows that it has quite strong support in at least 3<br />
states. Do you think that strong support for the Nuclear<br />
Disarmament Party is showing some failure on your part to<br />
reassure Australia..<br />
PH: It s very hard to draw that conclusion unless you want to </p>
<p>PM conts and of course I know people start off wanting to draur<br />
certain conclusions. Our support ia high, not only for the<br />
Party but for myself. We are not going down. So I don't knout<br />
what, as a matter of logic, what leads you to youar conclusion.<br />
If our support had been going down, and my support had been going<br />
down, then: perhaps there would be some logical basis for your<br />
question. But as the logical basis is not there I don't moe<br />
how you get to the conclusion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you feel under any sort ot pressure to come<br />
up with specifics Boon in the area of tax?<br />
PM8 No, I don't feel under any pressure. I have made it quite<br />
clear well before the election oampaign started as to what our<br />
approach on an overhaul of the tax system was. I am aware of<br />
the feeling of the people of Australia.' And they have a very<br />
Justifiable feeling that the tax syste~ which has grown up<br />
under years of conservative rule, and Iremind you that 30 of<br />
the last 35 years tax has been under the conservatives. And it<br />
has emerged as a very unfair system. And in more reeent years<br />
remarkably unfair because of the deliberate refusal of the<br />
conservatives to smash the tax avoidance industry. T11at has<br />
meant a great super tax upon the citizens. So they think it<br />
is unfair and they are right. They think taxes overall are<br />
generally to high on the average tax payer. They are right.<br />
so what I have been saying is that we will. initiate the debate<br />
on an overall of the tax system. We have started that. That<br />
has been going for some within EPAC, and I have said as we<br />
have got into the election campaign, that after the election<br />
we will continue that and broaden the debate. Now I have been<br />
saying that consistently. As there have been some misrepresent~ ations<br />
by our desperate, fearmongering opponents, I have made it clear<br />
earlier in the campaign that in the near future I will make a<br />
statement on this matter. I will and I invite you to be there,<br />
Heather, you will be very interested.<br />
JOURNIALIST% Prime minister, I wonder if you could comment please<br />
on claims by the Premier about if the Bill of Rights is implemented<br />
that States rights will be overrided, and homosexual marriages<br />
sanctioned, abortion legalised, and so on.<br />
PM:. Well, I think we can Judge how much you should attribute to.<br />
my good friend Joh's hyperbole, if I can put it that, by the<br />
repudiation which has been made of him, that no Christians can<br />
vote for me, or for the Labor Party. Now that is the sort of<br />
measure of how much substance you attach to Joh's statement in<br />
an election campaign. He gives himself full licence, opens full<br />
throttle on hyperbole during an election campaign. And he has<br />
in regard to what he is saying on the Bill of Rights, which is<br />
no more than a broad statement outlining basis for consideration<br />
and Joh knows that he is not speaking accurately on this matter.<br />
He doesn't take himself seriously on it, so why should I.<br />
JOURNALISTt Andrew Peacock has been gaining quite strong<br />
reception from the pensioners..<br />
PM, Oh yes tremendous reception, he had 350) people, 350 pension-era<br />
he had in the Sydney Town Hall, an enormous response. 350?<br />
Look I was in Devonport the day before, and I had what, were<br />
you there, yes I think you were. WEll I had between a hundred<br />
and 200 in Devonport, in Tasmania. if all t: hat Mr Peacock can<br />
get is 350 and you are prepared to give that as evidence of the<br />
ceoat support he in getting, then that suitti me Ciz~ e. </p>
<p>JOURNALISTs ARe you confident though that. there won't be an<br />
electoral back-lash on the Assets Test?<br />
PM: Yes I am certain of it. Because, if you like saying that<br />
Tasmania is npt part of Australia, I mean that was the story<br />
early in the week, that they are different. Now the Sydneysiders<br />
are not part of Australia. I mean, where is Australia. It's,<br />
I take the view that arouhd'Australia generally there is an<br />
increasing understanding of the fact which will become more clear<br />
as the forms go out that 98%, 98% of pensioners are not going<br />
to affected by the Assets TEst. Now statistics are there, you<br />
can't manipulate those statistics and it will be clear that<br />
through time, the majority of pensioners are going to be<br />
better off because we impose an Assets Test which Assets Test<br />
the concept is supported by whom? Supported by Mr Peacock when<br />
he was able to speak the truth as he saw, it as a backbencher in<br />
1981. Supported by Mr Howard, unquestio'nably Mr Howard supports<br />
the concept of an Assets Test. Senator Chaney, when he was<br />
Shadow Spokesman, supported it. The Young Liberals have made<br />
it quite clear that they support it. The Business Council of<br />
Australia said that any group, any political group, which sought<br />
to undermine the Assets Test was doing a grave disservi -ce to<br />
the country. In other words, right across the spectrum of<br />
Australia, including in large sections of the pensioner<br />
population spokesperson themselves, there is the recognition<br />
that a government must have the decency and the courage to<br />
clear the way for it, to do as much as it can for the overwhelming<br />
majority of pensioners who need and deserve the assistance of the<br />
community. Now, as distinct from the conservatives in this country,<br />
I have never feared the intelligence of the Austalian electorate.<br />
I have never tried to delude them with the tactics of fear<br />
and smear and misrepresentation. And it's because I trust<br />
the intelligence of the Australian electorate that I draw the<br />
conclusions on this point that I do.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you worried that. here in<br />
Queensland that Premier Sir Joh Bielke-Petersen may be ready<br />
to pull out a few dirty tricks during the campaign.<br />
PM: No I am not the one that should be worried about Joh's<br />
dirty tricks, it's Andrew and Ian Sinclair who are quivering<br />
in their boots. They don't k~ now how they are going to get<br />
through the next 5 weeks with Joh. They really don't. I<br />
mean they don't know-whether he is going to sort of renege<br />
on his situation where he said early in the year he didn't<br />
want to appear on the same platform with them, they don't<br />
know whether he is going to appear with them or not. He is<br />
obviously repudiated their tax policies. Andrew and Ian don't<br />
know what sort of a blast they are going to get from in the<br />
area of tax and economic policy. I am not worried about the<br />
Premier, I get on very well with him. I mean, in our negotiations<br />
and discussions he starts off and huffs and puffs a bit and<br />
makes some noises, then we sit down and have a cup of tea and wo<br />
work things out. Medicare, look at all the huffing and puffing<br />
that went on. But finally, he sat down, wo worked it out.<br />
His real venom is kept for the federal Liberals and National<br />
Party. lHe just can't see eye to eye with t: hem at all.*<br />
JOURNALIST: He has already taken a couple ok swipes at you<br />
over the Bill of Rights and the Christianity question hasn't he? </p>
<p>r * l<br />
PM: Yeah, and if he wants to go on having a sw ipe about<br />
Christianity, that's okay. As I said, what Job does when he<br />
gets into an election situation, he puts hyperbole into top gear,<br />
and sprays a bit, but he quite clearly doesn't believe half of<br />
what he says,, bimself. I mean he has his tongue in his cheek<br />
a bit. But he doesn't have his tongue in his cheek when he<br />
is attacking the federal Liberals and the federal National PartN.<br />
They are the ones.. that he has got sights on.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on the tax area. DCo you agree in principle<br />
to the concept of tax deductibility<br />
PM: Look I have said to you quite clearly that we will be makirig<br />
our statement on our approach on taxation within the near future.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you have a personal view?<br />
PM: Look I have personal views on the tone of your suit. But<br />
I don't think it is very relevant at the moment, and the shape<br />
of your glasses, are that shatterproof?<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, will that statement be made<br />
before or after the election?<br />
PM: Before the election. I don't how whether, I must have<br />
lost my capacity to express myself clearly. I said the near<br />
future and everyone knows that that will be within a matter of<br />
days. As to our approach. Let me make it clear, that we have<br />
been saying that we are going to be taking the community fully<br />
into our confidence on this matter. We are not going to be<br />
determining these matters now. We are not going to be imposing<br />
decisions on the Australian electorate of them being able to fully<br />
consult with us, put their views about what the overhaul of the<br />
tax system should be. And what I will be doing, I will be indicating<br />
how we will be going about bringing the people into that process.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Land Rights Question. You said in Tasmania,<br />
that you wouldn't introduce the Land Rights Bill until the states<br />
had been consulted. If, for instance, Queensland<br />
PM: Sounds terribly like a hypothetical coming up, doesn't it?<br />
JOURNALIST: extensive consultation the Queensland Government<br />
they wouldn't introdjuce the Bill and conform to your principles,<br />
would you impose a land rights bill on them?<br />
PM: You didn't disappoint me. It's a hypothetical and you know<br />
my strict rules on those. I don't answer them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, are you concerned that with the<br />
continued ebbing of Mr Peacock's popularity, are you concerned<br />
that it may turn around and become a flood tide.<br />
PM: A flood tide, that sounds a bit like my old friend, Sir<br />
Billy Mcl~ ahon in Washington there comes a time and a tide and<br />
and the ebb tide goes and you know he got a bit lost. I'm not<br />
sure what you mean. Is it going to..<br />
JOURNALIST: AS it is going down it may come to a point where it<br />
will stop and turn around and come back again. </p>
<p>A. L 0 \. DL Lu r r, 4 ( o P. U 2<br />
6.<br />
PHI Well I don't know, it has been going steadily. I would think<br />
there must come a point when it doesn't go down just a minute<br />
wait a minute, I am in the middle of answering this one. Gee,<br />
you have got rough rules up here.<br />
JOURNALIST: ' Watch the cricket balls.<br />
PM:. Yeah. Keep your eye on the question. No I haven't I am<br />
Just getting by laughter here. what I am saying is that<br />
I guess there must come a point where you can't go down any<br />
further. I mean he has already created a record. Now I would<br />
think, there must come a point when it stops and there will be<br />
some recovery. No, no come on, not fair.<br />
JOURNALIST: ARe you concerned, Prime Minister, that because<br />
Mr Peacock's popularity is so low, some swinging voters might<br />
vote Liberal because of the secure and certain knowledge that<br />
he i-s going to got dumped after the-election.<br />
PM: Oh, no I wouldn't think that would be part of the thinking<br />
of' any voters. The Liberal Party is pretty consistent about the<br />
way they handle these things. And there tends to be an-assumption<br />
that he will go, but I think no, again, you tend to, as so many<br />
people do, in commenting on politcs to ridicule the electorate<br />
are going to be making up their mind on how to vote on the basis<br />
of comparing the record of this government with the record of<br />
opponents when they were last in government. And they are going<br />
to be looking at how we have performed, how we have turned this<br />
country around, how they are all better off as a result of this<br />
government, as compared with the alternatives. And I think that<br />
is what is overwhelmingly going to be in the minds of the<br />
Australian electorate.<br />
JOURNALIST: PriMe Minister, yesterday in Tasmania you were<br />
attacking Mr Howard for advocating the winding of the tax<br />
base into indirect taxes because of the pressure it would<br />
put on inflation. Do we take it from that that any Government<br />
initiated review of the tax system would exclude winding of the<br />
tax base at this stage into indirect taxes?<br />
PM. Well as I say I will be addressing myself to this issue<br />
shortly of our approach. But I can say two things at this<br />
point. We would not be rushi~ ng into some particular change<br />
in the tax system, without having the detailed opportunity<br />
provided to the people of Australia and their organisations<br />
to address themselves to it. That is point one. Point two,<br />
that it is important that under the Liberals and National<br />
Party, they have of course concocted, and that is the right<br />
word, this series of wishes about taxation without relating<br />
it to the rest of economic policy. And that means that there<br />
is no way that any move towards indirect taxation under the<br />
Liberals could mean other than a significant increase in inflation<br />
because they would have no basis of agreement with the unions for<br />
any discounting of increases in prices which would inevitably<br />
associated with their policy. Now we are, of course, in a quite<br />
distinct position in that our tax policies are related to our<br />
general economic policies and would be part of the consultative<br />
process with business and with the trade unions so that if there<br />
were any move in that direction it would be as a result of full<br />
consultation and in a way which would inhibit adverse inflationary<br />
impact. </p>
<p>7.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, this ia a somewhat local issue.<br />
But the Brisbane City Council Opposition has asked whether the<br />
Government intends to state whether it's going to support Brisbane's<br />
effort for the 1992 Olympics before the election.<br />
Well they' are going to make a formal approach for the<br />
1992 Olympics then we would consider that.<br />
JOURNALIST: They are. The Council's going ahead with<br />
Yes, but what I'm saying, the question of the Commonwealth's<br />
position depends upon an approach from the Council and if it's -the<br />
State Government as well, to the Commonwealth Government saying well<br />
look, we're going to ' make this formal approach what's your<br />
position. well if we get that we'll obviously consider and if<br />
we took the step of supporting and they were successful then they<br />
would have obviously the full support of; the Australian Government.<br />
JOURNALIST; I understand they've already done that.<br />
Done what?<br />
JOURNALIST: They've made that approach to the Federal Government.<br />
Well, what for our support for an approach?<br />
JOURNALIST: For funds.<br />
But the approach for funds to hold-the Olympics. I mean they<br />
haven't got the Olympics.<br />
JOURNALIST; They need the assurance that funds will be forthcoming<br />
before they can make the approach.<br />
Well what I'm saying to you now quite clearly is this -that<br />
the people of Queensland can be assured that if the proper processes<br />
for applying for the Olympics are followed and they seek our<br />
involvement and it goes down the path of an actual application being<br />
made, which hasn't been done, then of course the Australian<br />
Government will be supportive.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister since the issue has been raised by the<br />
State Premier which issue?<br />
JOURNALIST: I'm getting to that.<br />
Oh, I see.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you prepared to restate your own personal views on<br />
religion and<br />
The answer is no on that. I am not going to demean the<br />
political processes by insulting the intelligence of the Australian<br />
electorate. The official spokespersons for the organised churches<br />
of Australia have done that. L UU .. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, in your much awaited. taxation statement<br />
would you be outlining what in effect would be the terms of<br />
reference for the review or principles the Government would liket<br />
to see, or glik-re us'a program for community involvement in the review?<br />
Well I think if I'm going to have a press conference to o~ utline<br />
these things it'sjpretty silly tactics to do it before the Press<br />
Con ference.-<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hlawke can I clear up something about the Accord.<br />
A couple of weeks ago you said that business might be involved more<br />
closely in the Accord and then Mr Willis said something slightly<br />
different. Do we know now whether business is going to be<br />
involved directly in the Accord?<br />
No, that was an attempt to beat up some semantic difference<br />
at the time and it died the very natural death that it obviously<br />
deserved. It had not legs for the running that particular<br />
situation. I'm surprised that you're trying to revivify it. The<br />
situation's quite clear. The formal accord is an accord between<br />
the trade union movement and the Labor Government it was originally<br />
when we were in opposition, and it became between the trade union<br />
movement and the Labor Government. That's the formal accord and it<br />
will remain between the trade union movement and the Government.<br />
What I was saying was that of course in the processes since<br />
Government we have broadened our approaches so that we talk just<br />
as much with the business community as we do with the trade union<br />
movement. Indeed you may recall that at the end of the Summit one<br />
of the leading spokesman for the business community I think it<br />
was Sir Peter Abeles said on his assessment of the Summit we now<br />
will regard ourselves as part of a three way process. And in fact<br />
since April of 1983 essentially our basis of co-operation has been<br />
a three-way one between Government and the trade unions and the<br />
business community. And it's been very productive and worthwhile<br />
for the people of Australia. But in the formal sense the Accord<br />
was and remains between the Government and trade unions.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, people in North Queensland tend to<br />
complain that any Federal Government that gets into power says yes,<br />
we'll look after you, before the election and then quite happily<br />
forgets and sits in Canberra-afterwards. Can you allay their fears<br />
I don't have to start doing it now. I've already done it.<br />
Soon after coming to Government I went up there. I remember I had<br />
a very significant luncheon at Townsville when we announced an&amp;~<br />
this is in 1983 the implementation of a number of initiatives in the<br />
area. And this was greeted with effusive gratitude and praise by<br />
the people of the area as well as it might. Because they've now<br />
got a Government for the first time which delivers. It just doesn't<br />
talk about the importance of North Queensland, but has in fact<br />
delivered. And I'm looking forward to going back there again<br />
tomorrow because I'm the Prime Minister of a Government which has<br />
delivered on its promises to North Queensland. Today for instance<br />
my outstandingly successful and well accepted Minister for Primary<br />
Industry, Mr John IKerin, has announced further assistance in regard<br />
to the sugar industry $ 5.5 million to help in debt reconstruction<br />
and capital works for these sugar cane farmers who are suffering from </p>
<p>U IU L U I 4r, &amp; I. L1 J I 9.<br />
P. M. cont...: very low world prices. So vie don't have to say now<br />
in an election we start doing things. We have consistently since<br />
we've been in Government delivered to North Queensland.<br />
JOURNAL1STz ., 4Prime Minister if you are confident that there's going<br />
to be no community backlash about the assets test are you also<br />
confident that there'll b. e no backlash over the speculation on your<br />
Government introducing a capital gains tax?<br />
As I said from the beginning of this campaign I want the<br />
whole issue of tax to be in the forefront of the electors minds<br />
for every day in this election. And I am certain that tax in<br />
general, including the fear and smear camppign on capital gains<br />
tax, will be a plus for this Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister will you del~ iver to North Queensland.<br />
on the issue of patrol boats and<br />
I've had discussions just a week or so ago with Mr Fry of<br />
NQEA and he expressed his appreciation of our approach and some<br />
of the things we've immediately been able to do. I bel~ eve there<br />
is a complete understanding on the part of Mr Pry of the commitment<br />
of my Government to doing everything we can to assist the<br />
development of what is an outstanding enterprise. </p>
