At j<br />
QUEEN ELIZABETH II FELLOWSHIPS<br />
On the occasion of the visit of Her Majesty earlier this year,<br />
the Commonwealth Government announced its decision to commemorate the<br />
Royal Visit by the foundation in perpetuity of post-doctoral Fellowships<br />
in the physical and biological sciences. With Her Majesty's consent,<br />
these Fellowships will be known as the Queen Elizabeth II Fellowships.<br />
Physical and biological sciences have an increasingly vital<br />
role in national growth and welfare and the Government wishes the present<br />
foundation to make a worthy contribution to scientific progress in this<br />
country and to the professional resources of our universities and<br />
scientific institutions. It is proposed that ten Fellowships may be<br />
awarded each year. They will be tenable in Australian universities<br />
or approved scientific institutions and will be open to Australian and<br />
U. K. citizens. The Government's intention is that these Fellowships will be<br />
awarded only to applicants of quite exceptional merit, young scientists<br />
who have demonstrated outstanding promise and capacity for original work.<br />
Fellowships will normally be tenable for a period of two years in an<br />
Australian university or approved scientific institution. In exceptional<br />
circumstances, a Fellowship may be extended for an additional year.<br />
A Standing Committee to be known as the Queen Elizabeth<br />
Fellowships Committee will be established to consider applications and to<br />
administer awards. The Committee will be appointed by the EBrime Minister<br />
and will comprise principally representatives of the Australian scientific<br />
body drawn from a panel nominated by the Council of the Australian Academy<br />
of Science. The Committee may, asx it sees fit, establish sub-committees<br />
or make other arrangements to assist it in the performance of its functions.<br />
A Secretariat will be provided by the Prime Minister's Department.<br />
Awards will be announced by the Prime Minister on the<br />
recommendation of the Standing Committee.<br />
Apt) ica tions.:<br />
1. Applications will be invited by the Committee from<br />
Australian or U. K. citizens who have completed a<br />
Ph. D., or have obtained equivalent qualifications,<br />
in one of the physical or biological sciences. For<br />
the award of the Fellowships, physical and biological<br />
sciences will be deemed to include mathematics and<br />
the scientific aspects of statistics, engineering,<br />
metallurgy, agriculture and medicine.<br />
2. Applicants should be not more than 30 years of age.<br />
( In exceptional circumstances, an older applicant may<br />
be considered.)<br />
3. Normally an applicant should be sponsored by his<br />
university and his application submitted by that<br />
university on his behalf. An applicant should<br />
therefore submit his application to the Registrar<br />
of the University at which his higher qualifications<br />
were obtained. If the university elects to sponsor<br />
the application, it will forward it to the Queen<br />
Elizabeth II Fellowships Committee with appropriate<br />
endorsement. If in any case it is appropriate for<br />
the application to be sponsored by a scientific<br />
institution at which he has undertaken research, the<br />
application may be made through that institution. </p>
<p>-2<br />
4. An application should state the general nature and scope<br />
of the research which the applicant wishes to undertake<br />
and may be supported by copies of scientific or other<br />
papers which the applicant has published or which are in<br />
the course of publication.<br />
Where an applicant indicates the Australian university<br />
or scientific institution at which he wishes the Fellowship<br />
to be tenable, the Queen Elizabeth Fellowships<br />
Committee will require an indication on the part of the<br />
university or institution that in the event of an award it<br />
will be ready to accommodate the Fellow and accept<br />
responsibility for such supervision of hfis projected work<br />
as is necessary and for disbursing, on behalf of the<br />
Commonwealth, stipend and other payments associated with<br />
the Fellowship. The Committee will stand ready to help<br />
where necessary to secure suitable placement for successful<br />
applicants.<br />
6. The applicant shall arrange for three referees to furnish<br />
statements to the Committee in support of his application.<br />
7. Applica-tions should be lodged with the Secretary of the<br />
Queen Elizabeth Fellowships Committee, Prime Minister's<br />
Department, Canberra. Dates for the lodging of applications<br />
and for the announcement of awards will be determined from<br />
time to time by the Standing Committee,<br />
8. Each successful applicant will be required to sign an<br />
u~ dertaking to accept and observe the conditions on which<br />
his Fellowship is to be held.<br />
Conditions: 1. For the time being, Fellowships will carry a stipend at<br />
the rate of œ 22,500 per annum. In special cases where the<br />
post-graduate experience of a Fellow would justify it, the<br />
Fellowships Committee may approve a higher stipend up to a<br />
maximum rate of œ E3.000 per annum. Dependants' allowances<br />
will also be paid on the basis of œ. 250 per annum for a wife<br />
and œ 2100 per annum in respect of each child under 16 years<br />
of age.<br />
2. Where a Fellowship is awarded to an overseas resident, the<br />
Commonwealth will meet the cost of tourist air fares, including<br />
an agreed luggage allowance, for the Fellow and his family to<br />
Australia and return on completion of the Llowship. In the<br />
case of an award to an Australian resident, the Commonwealth<br />
will meet any reasonable transfer expenses for the Fellow and<br />
his family which may be involved in undertaking the Fellowship.<br />
3. An allowance at the rate of œ. 500 per annum will be paid to<br />
the University or scientific institution where a Fellowship<br />
is tenable in recognition of expenses which may be incurred<br />
by the University or scientific institution incidental to a<br />
Fellow's research work. Any reimbursement of expenses to a<br />
Fellow underthis head will be at the discretion of the<br />
institution in which the Fellow is working.<br />
4. The Commonwealth will make a contribution of up to 10% A of the<br />
annual stipend towards a Fellow's superannuation provisions<br />
under F. S. S. U. or equivalent arrangements.<br />
A Fellow will normally be expected to take up duty within six<br />
months of the announcement of the award and will be entitled<br />
to payment of stipend and allowances as from the date on which<br />
he takes up duty. </p>
<p>3<br />
6 A Fellow shall devote his whole time to the specified<br />
research and may not accept any additional appointment<br />
or emolument without the approval of the Standing<br />
Committee and the University or scientific institution<br />
concerned. A limited amount of time, however, may with<br />
the approval of the Committee be spent in delivering an<br />
advanced course of lectures.<br />
7. At the end of his first year's research, a Fellow will be<br />
required to report to the Standing Committee as to the<br />
progress of his work. The Committee will also receive a<br />
report from the Head of the Department in which the Fellow<br />
is working. If the Committee is of the opinion that the<br />
Fellow has not made good use of his opportunities, it may<br />
at its absolute discretion terminate the Fellowship.<br />
8. At the end of the tenure of a Fellowship, a Fellow will<br />
submit to the Committee a complete report on the research<br />
carried out.<br />
9. A Fellow will be expected to conform to such of the<br />
regulations ( including disciplinary provisions) of the<br />
University or scientific institution in which he is<br />
holding the Fellowship as are applicable to him and the<br />
Committee may terminate his Fellowship if he fails to<br />
conform.<br />
A Fellow shall not be entitled to relinquish his Fellowship<br />
except on and subject to such conditions as are determined<br />
by the Committee.<br />
