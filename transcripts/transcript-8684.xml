PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
ACOSS CONGRESS, CANBERRA 1 OCTOBER 1992<br />
Thank you for the invitation to open your Annual<br />
Congress. I very much appreciate the opportunity to<br />
address a major meeting of representatives of the<br />
communit ywel fare sector.<br />
The theme of this Congress Is ' Social justice in<br />
_ Australia_-the way forward', drid that -is ' what I want to<br />
talk about today.<br />
How we go forward. How we continue to raise the level of<br />
social justice in Australia.<br />
And I can say " continue". Our plans for the next decade,<br />
build on the last one the one in which we transformed<br />
social policy in Australia.<br />
I'm talking about sOcial security, health, housing, child<br />
care, aged care, education, training the areas critical<br />
to Australians' quality of life and opportunities.<br />
of course there is more to do and each year we do more.<br />
As I have said more than once this year, the final<br />
measure of bow successful a nation we are will always be<br />
how well'we care for ech other.<br />
I think we can say with some pride that we have done well<br />
over the decade of Labor.<br />
And I think we can say with confidence that you will see<br />
the progress continue.<br />
You will see more programs and better delivery, more<br />
building blocks of improvement. You will see the social<br />
net made more secure, and the realm of opportunity<br />
extended. Social justice remains at the centre of our approach to<br />
the business and task of governing.<br />

of course we say there is a role for Government and we<br />
reckon it's a very strange philosophy to think that the<br />
art of government is to find, not the means of<br />
engagement, but the means of withdrawal from the life of<br />
the nation.<br />
We think that is quite perverse.<br />
I have always believed that Labor Governments should keep<br />
their shoulder to the door. We should always be pushing.<br />
If you want to be the government of Australia, you have<br />
to want to build things. And know how to build them.<br />
The first principle, we say, is taking the people with<br />
you. We learnt that in the eighties.<br />
We consult with people and interest groups, such as those<br />
represented here today. We act in partnership.<br />
For a decade now this Government has used the principle<br />
of consensus to achieve change, and to ease the passage<br />
of change.<br />
But it has been consensus with purpose and direction.<br />
The Government hias -seen -what has had to be done and<br />
worked with people to bring this about.<br />
it has worked. Consensus does not slow reform it<br />
facilitates it. It exposes the Government to wider<br />
views, helps us see the way through. It alerts us to the<br />
complexities inherent in all social situations.<br />
We get better programs as a result.<br />
The Labor Government believes that-.. social policy and<br />
economic policy are inextricably linked. The point of<br />
economic policy is to lift people up, not to push them<br />
down. when this Government introduced a market ' econom~ y, when it<br />
opened us up to the world, implemented programs of<br />
microeconomic reform every step we took towards a more<br />
Competitive Australia was a step towards a fairer<br />
Australia. We have made hard economic decisions through the last<br />
decade. No one would say that we have never put a foot<br />
wrong but the essential changes, the ones that will<br />
guarantee us a chance in the contemporary world, and<br />
especially in this region have been made.<br />
They are the same changes, of course, that in the long<br />
run will give our young people a future, and the rest of<br />
us security in work and in retirement. </p>
<p>TL: 1. Oct. 92 10: 25 No. 002 P. 03/ 10<br />
3<br />
They are the changes which gave us the growth in national<br />
wealth and the job growth of 1.5 million. Without those<br />
changes a lot of the social policy we have implemented<br />
and a lot of the programs we now contemplate would simply<br />
not be feasible.<br />
what we have done on the economic front, we've done for a<br />
social purpose. For us, economic policy will always be<br />
the servant of a greater goal greater opportunity,<br />
greater care, greater social justice.<br />
This is the recipe for successful countries.<br />
The successful countries of today are the Social<br />
democracies. Not the centrally planned economies. Not<br />
the monetarist experiments.<br />
The successful countries are those which recognise the<br />
complexities of modern society and the clear, though<br />
subtle and often difficult, role for government in<br />
helping to make them work in the interests of the people.<br />
The proper object is to find the right mix to Create an<br />
efficient economy and a comprehensive social policy. The<br />
proper starting point is the realisation that the two are<br />
inextricably connected. Quite simply you can't have one<br />
without the other.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The great aim for all governments now is employment and<br />
proigowh You can't have one without hithro<br />
those either.<br />
We recognise our responsibilities to those who have borne<br />
great hardship in the recession and in the process of<br />
economic reform. It is wrong that they should bear the<br />
burden of change alone.<br />
Care, support and re-training for these people are<br />
Integral parts of economic change, and the greatest<br />
challenge to the advancement of social justice in<br />
Australia. My first priorities as Prime Minister have been to assist<br />
the unemployed and generate jobs and growth.<br />
We began with Oj1e-NatUi. Tile One Nation Statement<br />
included funding for major capital works to create jobs<br />
and projects of permanent benefit to the nation. We<br />
increased income support for families and expanded labour<br />
market programs to assist the unemployed.<br />
Following consultations with young people, community<br />
organisations, business and unions, we extended our<br />
efforts with theNational Employmnt and Training Plan<br />
forYoung__' eople._ </p>
<p>T1EL.: O ct. 92 10: 25 No. 002 P. 04/ 10<br />

And I would like to acknowledge now my appreciation of<br />
the discussions we had with organisations like ACOSS, the<br />
Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Catholic Socialwelfare<br />
Comtmission, and the Australian Youth Policy and Action<br />
Coalition, all of whiich contributed to the development of<br />
thEfe Government's initiatives for young people.<br />
Assisting the unemployed was also the cornerstone of this<br />
year's Budget. The Budget provided an additional $ 1.2<br />
billion over four years for training, jobs and<br />
investment.<br />
we introduced a new 10081 infrastructure program,<br />
providing employment and beneficial community projects<br />
for regions hardest hit by unemployment. We improved and<br />
increased our labour market programs.<br />
A number of groups, including ACOSS, have supported<br />
linking training programs with wage subsidies to improve<br />
Job seekers' chances of finding work.<br />
The Government has taken up this idea, f irst with the<br />
offer of accredited training and wage subsidies for all<br />
long term unemployed young people, and then in the Budget<br />
with a program linking training arnd wage subsidies for<br />
adults. TheJO8SKILLS program which has been so suc cessful was<br />
also expanded. Overall, expenditure on labour market<br />
programs has been increased in real terms by 86 per cent<br />
this year compared with 1991-92.<br />
But a government's responsibilities go well beyond<br />
responding to urgent situations.<br />
A lot of government is, or should be, about quietly<br />
running things making the changes which improve the<br />
quality of people's lives. Government is often about<br />
good housekeeping and nurturing.<br />
This is one of the satisfying things in governing for the<br />
long haul you get to see government programs not just<br />
established but developed and improved. You get to build<br />
on the blocks you have laid.<br />
A good example of what I'm talking about can be seen in<br />
the development of theFamily Allowance Supplement or FAS<br />
program. I'm convinced that FAS is one of the most successful<br />
income support programs in the world for 3low income<br />
families. It offers high levels of payment, additional<br />
support for those in private rental accommodation and<br />
subsidised health care.<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL.: O ct. 92 10: 25 No. 002<br />
Since we have been in government, payments for low income<br />
families have increased in real terms by 43 per cent for<br />
families with two children under 13 years, and 87 per<br />
cent for those with two children aged 13-15 years.<br />
FAS is a program to be proud of.<br />
But from January next year we will improve it even more.<br />
Family Allowance Supplement, additional pension/ benefit<br />
for children and family allowance will be integrated.<br />
This low-key change will make the system simpler and<br />
easier for families to understand. It will give about<br />
37,000 families additional inczome. It will reduce<br />
poverty traps. The payments will also be paid to the<br />
main carer of the children, who is usually the mother.<br />
These are not headline-grabbing changes. They are good<br />
housekeeping changes which will make the lives of a great<br />
many Australians better.<br />
The FAS changes illustrate that often the way forward in<br />
social justice is, as I said, by quietly building on the<br />
successes of the past.<br />
Sometimes,. also, the way forward comes about through<br />
addressing problems that, ironically, have only surfaced<br />
because of the successes of past policies.<br />
An example of this is the Child Support Agency.<br />
I strongly supported the establishment of the Child<br />
Support Agency. It redressed a major wrong that the<br />
burden of family breakdown was being overwhelmingly borne<br />
by the custodial parent, usually the mother.<br />
Before the Agency was set up in 1988 only 24 per cent of<br />
custodial parents received child support. The average<br />
level of maintenance was $ 26 per child per week.<br />
The Child Support Agency is currently collecting 70 per<br />
cent of the amount-on its books. And under the child<br />
support formula, the average level per child is now $ 48 a<br />
week. But with all this success came a problem that is,<br />
there is an initial eight week delay in the Agency making<br />
the first child support payments.<br />
There are some very good reasons for the delay, including<br />
the fairly lengthy process of determining the level of<br />
payment and finding the non-custodial parent. But<br />
understandably for parents dependent on the money, any<br />
delay is very difficult.<br />

<p>TEL.: O ct. 92 10: 25 No. 002 P. 06/ 10<br />
6<br />
It is interesting that the pressure to improve the system<br />
comes mainly from parents who would not have experienced<br />
the old maintenance system.<br />
For parents who suffered under the old system, the Child<br />
Support Agency can seem like a miracle. The other day I<br />
heard that the Child Support Agency has caught up with a<br />
father who had not paid support for his children for<br />
eight years. For custodial parents in cases like this,<br />
the Agency is more successful than they could have ever<br />
hopod. But it is no good telling parents who are now facing a<br />
delay in receiving their first payment, that in the days<br />
before the Child Support Agency they would have been<br />
lucky to get the most paltry amount on an irregular<br />
basis. They just want a system that works. And this is what we<br />
have to keep working to deliver the best.<br />
I'm pleased to say that in this year's Budget the<br />
Government announced that it would change the<br />
arrangements so that custodial parents will receive their<br />
first child support payment two to three weeks earlier.<br />
And we will continue to work to improve the program.<br />
So successes can lead to new problems and new solutions<br />
to them. This is one way the social justice agenda moves<br />
forward.<br />
The work we have done this year on vocational education,<br />
which will continue over the next few years, is another<br />
example of this point.<br />
Education has been one of our successes as a government.<br />
when we came to office, only 36 per cent of kids finished<br />
school. Today, 70 per cent do. A revolution in a<br />
decade. we helped this revolution along with AUSTtJDY and ABSTUDY<br />
which provide financial assistance foFsen1ii-67csecon-da-ry<br />
students in low Income families. We have increased this<br />
assistance and 50 per cent more secondary school students<br />
receive it now than in 1987.<br />
Again success has lead to other problems. Having stayed<br />
to the end of high school, these kids now want a tertiary<br />
education. But the system is not yet fully equipped to<br />
take them the next education step, despite the 50 per<br />
cent increase in Commonwealth funding for higher<br />
education places between 1983 and 1994.<br />
We now need to tackle our vocational education and<br />
training systems to prepare young people for a life of<br />
skilled and interesting work, a world of work which<br />
requires training and retraining over a working life.<br />

The new Australianl National Training Authority is a major<br />
step forward in creating a genuinely national system to<br />
deliver high quality training programs that better meet<br />
the needs and priorities of both students and industry.<br />
But we don't just respond to problems.<br />
we review policy regularly. We want to be sure we are up<br />
to date, responsive, responsible.<br />
Since coming to office in 1983, we have done just this.<br />
We have undertaken major reviews of aged care; social<br />
security; retirement income; programs of support for<br />
people with disabilities; and, more recently, health and<br />
housing and the major review of government policies in<br />
response to the IfoyEA-qommi ss ion. into Aborigirnal Deaths<br />
_ in Cu4~ soy.<br />
Such reviews can lead to fundamental changes to programs.<br />
For example: the shift to support for elderly people to stay at<br />
home through the introduction of the Home and<br />
Community Care Program<br />
the transformation of the unemployment benefit<br />
system into an active program of assistance<br />
and the creation of a new community housing program.<br />
These reviews also provide an excellent vehicle to<br />
consult with groups such as yourselves.<br />
The recent National Health 5trategy is a good example of<br />
this process. The Government Introduced Medicare in 1984<br />
in response to the previous Government's policies which<br />
left nearly 2 million people without health insurance.<br />
_, mpedicarqeprovides a universal, equitable and efficient<br />
system of health care for all Australians.<br />
it is difficult to understand why the Opposition would<br />
want to replace such a system with a policy which would<br />
force people to take out private insurance such as in the<br />
United States.<br />
The Opposition policy would greatly increase the cost of<br />
health care. it would hand over responsibility for<br />
setting health costs to the AMA: to quote their own words<br />
" Basically, our policy requires doctors to set their<br />
own fees".<br />
The Opposition's health policies would increase the total<br />
cost of health care in Australia by over $ 2 billion a<br />
year. The overall impact on household health bills would<br />
be an increase of 23 per cent or $ 1000 a year for a<br />
family with two children.<br />

The Government's approach through the National Health<br />
Strategy is to build on the strengths of Medicare and<br />
ensure it is in good shape to take us into the next<br />
century. Medicare will become more than just a health<br />
financing system; it will become a comprehensive health<br />
care system.<br />
The Government has an agenda of reform to cover<br />
Australia's health needs, including improved access to<br />
public hospitals; better integration of the health and<br />
aged care networks; and implementation of aNational<br />
Mental Health-Policy.-<br />
I have talked today about different ways of taking the<br />
social justice agenda further.<br />
We respond to the urgent problems like unemployment. But<br />
we don't just wait for emergencies to act, we also look<br />
for opportunities to make our programs stronger and<br />
better.<br />
And we don't rest on our laurels; we respond to the<br />
challenges that our successes can give rise to.<br />
Finally, we do not shun open and constructive fundamental<br />
review of our programs, to ensure they are right to meet<br />
the changing demographic, social and economic landscape<br />
of Australia.<br />
We have taken the view that social justice is at the core<br />
of governing, and we have governed for the long haul.<br />
The rewards come steadily and it is to those who most<br />
need and deserve them that they flow.<br />
It is not an approach predicated on the belief that there<br />
is no role for government except to clear the way for the<br />
market. It is not a residuallst approach which believes<br />
social justice is about giving cold charity to the poor.<br />
Dr Hewson's approach is dramatically different.<br />
Dr Hewson does not talk about building on the strengths<br />
of the Family Allowance Supplement. He talks about using<br />
the social security system to compensate people for the<br />
introduction of a highly regressive goods and services<br />
tax. Dr Hewson does not talk about tackling the challenges of<br />
the success of the Child Support Agency. He talks about.<br />
privatising it, removing the one thing that ensures the<br />
very success of the agency: its location in the Tax<br />
Office. </p>
<p>TEL: 1. Oct. 92 10: 25 No. 002 P. 09/ 10<br />
Dr Hewsofl does not talk about advancing the social<br />
justice agenda. He talks about getting out of the<br />
business of governing for social change, selling off<br />
public housing, tearing down the public health system.<br />
Reducing. Limiting. Privatisinig. Wrecking.<br />
The Hewson model of government is to get out of the<br />
business of government. In his own words, it is about<br />
less government.<br />
Integral to this approach is the division of society into<br />
the ' deserving' and the ' undeserving'; into those who can<br />
legitimately claim government assistance and those who<br />
will be shunned.<br />
Two Nations instead of our one Nation.<br />
Dr Hewson says he is all about giving Australians choice,<br />
all about the government getting out of the way and<br />
leaving people to it.<br />
But can we call choice, abolishing unemployment benefit<br />
for people after nine months and throwing them to the<br />
wolves? Can we call choice, forcing sole parents into the<br />
workforce when their youngest child reaches 12?<br />
Can we call choice, giving young people a voucher for<br />
training and telling them to get their own training<br />
course? Can we call choice, selling off public housing and<br />
leaving the elderly, Aboriginals and people with<br />
disabilities to find their own way in the private rental<br />
market? Dr Hewson doesn't understand about choice.<br />
Real choice is not about stripping back support and<br />
abandoning people to their own devices. Choice is about<br />
people being able to take advantage of opportunities. At<br />
times this will mean assisting people to the starting<br />
line; at times it will be about running the race<br />
alongside, helping out; and at times it will mean<br />
intervening when the race is being run unfairly.<br />
This is what governing for social justice is about it<br />
is about being in partnership with people throughout<br />
their lives and providing the support necessary to enable<br />
them to make the choices and take advantage of the<br />
opportunities. With this approach to government, we are committed to a<br />
comprehensive social security system and to maintaining<br />
the level of payments through indexation. </p>
<p>TEL: l. Oct. 92 10: 25 No. 002 P. 10/ 1<br />
we are committed to expanding the provision of quality,<br />
affordable Child care for parents at home and in the<br />
workforce. We are committed to a fair and equitable health system<br />
and to tackling the problem of waiting lists in public<br />
hospitals. we are committed to continuing to expand opportunities<br />
for women, in education, in employment, in every area of<br />
our national life.<br />
we are committed to better housing options for people,<br />
and to moving to more effective assistance for people in<br />
private rental.<br />
We are committed to giving older people opportunities for<br />
an independent and dignified life.<br />
We are committed to building a truly national vocational<br />
education and training system.<br />
We are committed to advancing social justice for<br />
Australians. I think we should be very proud of our achievements. But<br />
we know the process of reform is never over.<br />
We go forward by adding one achievement to the next. We<br />
do not dwell on the past, but strive to understand and<br />
influence the future. </p>
