GREAT HALL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments have<br />
agreed to a grant of $ 5003, 09 to be shared equally by them towards the cost<br />
of a Great Hall at the University of Newcastle.<br />
It is understood that it is the University's intention to<br />
proceed immediately with the preparation of plans so that the construction<br />
of the Great Hall will be able to commence at the beginning of 1970.<br />
1 am pleased that the Commonwealth and New South Wales<br />
Governments have been able to support this project, which has received<br />
very generous support of over $ 500, 000 from a public appeal.<br />
The University proposes to incorporate in the Great Hall,<br />
facilities for general university use as well as for ceremonial and musical<br />
occasions which can be shared with the citizens of Newcastle who have so<br />
generously supported the appeal for funds.<br />
