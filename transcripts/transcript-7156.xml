PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW, PH-ILLIP ADAMS, 2UE, 3 April 1987<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
ADAMS: Good morning, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Good morning Phillip.<br />
ADAMS: 1 must say 1 thought your April Fool's Day performance<br />
was wonderful letting the Libs and the National Party off<br />
the election. It was a remarkably compassionate Bob Hawke.<br />
PM: That's my nature, you know that.<br />
ADMAS.: Were you tempted really to run early or was it just<br />
teasing them?<br />
PM: No, I was tempted, buL as you know I have a long history<br />
of resisting temptation Phillip. It's our training in the<br />
manse. ADAMS: That's right, it's our Congregational. background.<br />
But you're different to me, I have always yeildod<br />
PM: You succumbed, I didn't.<br />
ADAMS: Yes, I've always rolled over anid said " Let it happen".<br />
Prime Minister, we've got a Foster's VFL, Foster's Mclbourne<br />
Cup and it now seems just when John Howard thought it was<br />
safe to go back Into the party room we're going to have a<br />
Fosters'. Liberal Party with John Elliott. WhaL's your attitude<br />
to this?<br />
PM: I don't know if ever one had any doubt about there<br />
being a God this would remove it. if hie comes and throws<br />
his hat In the ring. The only thing one can say about it<br />
it is the only thing * in the world that would unite Howard<br />
and Peacock. The only thing they agree on let's keep out<br />
John Elliott. TIhey have both started to recognise the brilliant<br />
capacities of the existing Member for Higgins and they arc<br />
going around, John Howard and Mr Peacock, saying what a brilliant<br />
man this Shipton is. We have never heard much before but<br />
he is suddenly something extra.<br />
ADAMS: Yes. He hasn't been one of the great stars of front<br />
or back bench, has he?<br />
PM: No, he has not but as I say, two contending current<br />
fellows there in the Party now Lhink he is marvellous becaue<br />
because they don't want Mr Elliott there. But I think it<br />
would be good Lo have him there, don't you? </p>
<p>Wall, ! L vv'juli L6 bi of a laugh, wo.~ uldn't it?<br />
You and the world's best dressed Treasurer have bitten a<br />
lot of bullets in the last few years, you have made a lot<br />
of the hard economic decisions, things that no conservative<br />
government would have been game to do, and yet the business<br />
community aren't being all that nice to you. Does that make-<br />
PM: I think the large business community is very supportive<br />
of this Government. Thai doesn't mean they agree with every<br />
decision we have made. of course they don't. But all<br />
indications we are getting is that the large business sector<br />
in supporiv of Lhi:: CuvwuisviL. IL le,. &amp; oms of the smaller<br />
business people making some noises.<br />
ADAMS: I remember you and I discussing the<br />
pheixometin ttbu a year ago and you weren't that worried<br />
about. ARe you still unconcerned about this small business<br />
aggro that is going on?<br />
PM: We are unconcerned in the sense, Phillip, that when<br />
the election comes the majority of them will be supporting<br />
US. There won't be any altruism or change of ideals, but<br />
rather the old nag self-interest will'be running<br />
ADAMS: Yee,. he wav in on&amp;-of John Tnpn'n tipm this mnrnina.<br />
the old nag self-interest.<br />
PM: well, as the saying goes, it is always trying. Phillip.<br />
We had a report out of Washington this morning that the outgoing<br />
SvvreLariy 01-tte--Navy--is talidAnq -about-thu US-mov. 4 g<br />
its Antarctic base to Hobart. Has that hit your in tray<br />
yet? PM N~ o, it hasn't hit my in tray. There has been speculation<br />
about it. This is Lehmisnn, you are talking about, he has<br />
been making that noise for some time. But there is no proposal<br />
before us, Phillip.<br />
ADAMS: Would it come to you or to Robin Gray?<br />
PM: Robin Gray is already on the record. He has said he<br />
wants Lnem. tio. Lne decisioii INi UiU rUL Lliv Ttwltiii u~ j~ mab<br />
ADA~ MS have. got-. toL. ask..-yz1.. svnOlw toxxgb.. g-t-Jjons now because<br />
othorwioo Alan Jonee gets cr~ nky with me An~ d 1 aim tL'rm4fin.<br />
oif 111111. Aste yuu uvasfidwz&amp; L cifL y%-zt y1., io1 niow<br />
conference that the new two tier wages system will hold?<br />
PM: Yes. Again It Is a matter of the combination of good<br />
things and self-interest because certainly the leadership<br />
of the ACTU knows and they dre very good communicators to<br />
their affiliates. They know that Lhe. alternative to making<br />
this system would be chaos. You would have the temporary<br />
phenomenon, perhaps. of nnmp l~ rgpr w~ ge mnvrem. nts by unions<br />
using their strength but would just destroy the economy and<br />
jobs. Yes, it will hold.<br />
ADAMS: You sound a bit croaky?<br />
PM; No, I am not croaky. Some of my muesli is caught in<br />
my throat but I will negotinto it alright Phillip. </p>
<p>ADAMS: The miners union have decided not to support the<br />
system. Could tL pose problems in our relations with the<br />
Japanese coal buyers?<br />
PM: If they were allowed to get away with it. But the coal<br />
miners will. I think, realise that they can't live as an<br />
isolated little organism in the total trade union movement.<br />
The rest of the trade union movement won't support them.<br />
And as Bill Kelty sald yesterday, ana i couldn't agree with<br />
him more " my heart doesn't bleed for people of $ 800 a week"<br />
and wanting to get more at a time when restraint is what<br />
is required. will act against their own self-interest<br />
and against their own kids self-interest If they carry on<br />
like that.<br />
ADAMS: Prime Minister, earlier in the week it was reported<br />
LhaL Lih Pinance Minister, Vetr Walsh, woo ouggeoting that<br />
the Lax-free tUreshuld be iseuvud for second income earners<br />
which of course means workinq married women. Do you think<br />
this is an equitable way of going about getting more taxes.<br />
why should married women be penalised for working especially<br />
when they've already had to pay large sums of money, which<br />
isn't deductible, for child ui.-u?<br />
PM: I am sorry, Phtilip, but I am not getting inco any<br />
discussions about proposals or any considerations that might<br />
be before the Expondituro Roviow Committon. What you have<br />
got to understand is that in this process bits of paper come<br />
across the desks of Ministers for consideratlut. It duu= n'L<br />
mean that every one of those bits of paper is going to be<br />
acted upon.<br />
ADAMS: Just like those Liberal Party documents that fall<br />
of the back of trucks?<br />
PM: It Is soemthing like that with the difference being<br />
that we do go about Lhe processes of sorting out what has<br />
to be done and doing. If you are going to face the situation<br />
that this country has got where you have this massive loss<br />
of national Income which averages about $ 1500 per family<br />
we have had wiped off uu" mnuLiuital vuoniomic capacity, then<br />
you have just got to looK at the wnole range expenuizure<br />
outlays on the revenue side to make the adjustments that<br />
I I I 1 II I i ili stdbh<br />
that loss of income and get the economy set to move into<br />
the future. Nothing should be regarded as sacrosanct but<br />
if you take the view that everything as it Is now must be<br />
retained then you are just shutting your eyes to the fact<br />
that $ 6bn has been wiped off. You can't wave a magic<br />
wand and say " of course it didn't happen, it is just a<br />
statistician's trick". That is nonsense. We will leave<br />
that sort of vuodoo economics to the other side of politics.<br />
We are going to face up to the job that has got to be done.<br />
ADAMS: I would make the observation that such a proposal<br />
might be at odds with your commitment to affirmative action.<br />
Have you considered looking at some kind of general wealth<br />
tax, Prime Minister? </p>
<p>PM: One of the signif icant things we have done~ In that area<br />
is to Impose a capital gains Lax. That Is the most significant<br />
thing that has been done in this country in the area of ensuring<br />
that wealth accumulation which had previously been untaxed<br />
is now going to pay a contribution to the general revenue.<br />
ADAMS: The Australia Card's fate in the Senate. We heard<br />
a rumour the other day that, in fact, John Howard arid the<br />
boys had been considering something very like the Australia<br />
Card? PM: Vos, It is a sort of cock crowed thrice thing. There<br />
were throe separate occasions during the Fraser/ Howard years<br />
And interestingly. the first one after Howard became Treasurer,<br />
fho first investigation. I think, was in ' 78 and then there<br />
were two other occasions when they investigated It. Of course,<br />
this is consistent with John Howard and Vaider. the President<br />
of the Party. You ought to play it sometime, to your listeners,<br />
the Valder tape. Do you remember it?<br />
ADAMS: Are they as good as the Age Tapes, the Valder Tupes?<br />
PM: The language is somewhat more elegant.<br />
ADAM~ S: Isn't it funny the way the Liberals speak in asterisks<br />
Prime Minister?<br />
PM: it is sort of asterisk tand it Is exulamation marks,<br />
isn't It?<br />
ADAMS: You have never dane that, have you?<br />
PM: No, no.<br />
ADAMS: You call a spade a spade?<br />
PM.. I call a spade a spade.<br />
ADAMS: You don't mince asterisks?<br />
PM: I don't not at all, exclamation marks and all that<br />
sort of thing.<br />
You really ought to play that Valder tape sometime. This<br />
is relevant to what you saying about the Australia Card because<br />
mr Valder made that famous tape which he didn't think was<br />
going to be distributed.<br />
ADAMS: That was the orie for Westpao?<br />
PM: Yes, you ought to get it becauso, essentially, waht<br />
what the President of the Liberal Party said was this " you<br />
have got to have these cuts in the welfare area, you hiuve<br />
got to have this expenditure savings" and he praised the<br />
Government and Mr Keating for what they were doing in the<br />
fringe benefits area. He said that is a disease. And the<br />
Assets Test. All these things. And then he said " isn't<br />
it good, the Labor Party are doing it and we are Protesting<br />
our opposition to it, they will bring thern in and get whacked<br />
behind the ear electorally and then we, the Liberals, will<br />
come in and leave thorn there!~ That Is the Federal President<br />
of the Liberal Party saying that is our philosophy. We believe </p>
<p>PM cont: in these things and we will protest our opposition.<br />
Let the Labor Party do them, keep them there. That is really<br />
John Howard. John Howard believes in the capital gains tax,<br />
he believes in an Assets Test, he believes in the Australia<br />
Card, but he has just become the supreme opportunist of<br />
Australian politics. And that is why I said on the Sunday<br />
program the other day it is not just that the Liberal Party<br />
doens't like him or that the Australian electorate doesn't<br />
like him, in the end the most destructive thing for a person<br />
is thaL you don't like yourself. And that is John Howard's<br />
problem because he knows that what we are doing is right<br />
and he is going through all this nonsense of arguing against<br />
it Publ icly.<br />
ADAMS: Ilie is still a very beleagured man and it looks like<br />
Andrew might have shot his bolt for a while. I was talking<br />
to Laurie Oakes the other day about the possibility of a<br />
third man. It often happens in a time like this. Is therea<br />
possible third Mdri on the front<br />
PM: I must be careful about talking abuut a third man becaues<br />
I referred to s~ ome suggestions that were going around Canberra<br />
and I received a letter from Mr Brown. And IL was interesting,<br />
which will tickle your fancy, the letter the first draft,<br />
of the letter that came from his solitictors. demanded<br />
from me, this is on behalf of Mr Brown, demanded from me<br />
a " Pubic apology". Do you like that?<br />
ADAMS: It is wonderful. I was going to ask you for a joke<br />
later but I have got one already.<br />
PM: That is the Joke for the day. We are neitLher giving<br />
a pubic or any other sort of apology.<br />
ADAMS: I sincerely hope not. That would need some asterisks.<br />
We couldn't have that. Robert Sparkes, the Machiavellian<br />
Sir Robert, has said that the threat of the early electioni<br />
has been removed and now the Queensland National will withdraw<br />
from what is left of the Coalition. if things get much, much<br />
worse for the Coalition, might you be tempted as ani old<br />
Congregationalist to go for an early election again?<br />
PM: No, Phillip.<br />
ADAMS; That is a very short answer?<br />
PM: Yes. It is short, to the point, accurate.<br />
ADAMS: What did the Party polls have to say about our chances<br />
listen to me being partisan against the opposition?<br />
PM; We would have won. And there are a number of factors<br />
in thaL that are somewhat complicated. There wus the analysis<br />
of the Joh Factor and what would happen to that. And the<br />
trend where we are on a steadily rising trend. There is<br />
no doubt, taking a combination of our polls and the others,<br />
that we would have won. But we will win better next year.<br />
this year and next year, probably next year, I guess. </p>
<p>ADAMS: Before the South Australian election, I think it<br />
was, you were very critical. of the Liberal Party for its<br />
privatisation policies. In fact, you had a lot of fun with<br />
thorn. Now it looks as if you and Paul Keating have stolen<br />
some of the Liberals thunder in that area?<br />
PM: No, there are still some fundamental difrerences betwoen<br />
us, Phillip. You take things like Telecom, Australia Post<br />
there arc fundamental reasons, public interest reasons,<br />
why these enterprises shouLd remain in public hands.<br />
ADAMS: Bob, what is so different about selling off things<br />
like airports, the Pipeline Authority?<br />
PM: Airport terminals it is absolutely absurd to suggest<br />
there is any social democratic, ideological reason why we<br />
should run airports, concessions at airports. That is crazy.<br />
There is no public interest involvement in that but there<br />
is a great public interest involvement In the question of<br />
owning Telecom because people in non-metropolitan Australia,<br />
whose needs are very obvious, are able to got services which<br />
a purely profit -oriented Telecom woqld not provide.<br />
ADAMS: So you are not doing a Menzies arid stcallng the<br />
Opposition's policies?<br />
PM: I don't mind being pragmatic. I think I have shown<br />
that in four years. If I believe some existing sort shibboleth<br />
ADAMS: Say that again shibboloth.<br />
PM: I like that word, it is our mutual manse background.<br />
It is there, my son, it is there, we can't help it. So If<br />
the shibboleth is a thing of by-gone days, not something<br />
before which should prostrate ourselves in terms of current<br />
requirements then you don't. I am severely practical when<br />
it comes to protecting the interests of the people of this<br />
country. I am not going to bow before some idol of the past.<br />
That is silly. What I say is something that is now an issue<br />
do we have to do that to protect the interests of the people.<br />
I take Telecom. Quite clearly, the interests of the people<br />
of Australia demand, In my judgement, that that should remain<br />
in the public ownership. But I cannot, for the life of me,<br />
see how the interests of the people of Australia demand that<br />
they, the people of Australia, should, through their government,<br />
own and run airport terminals.<br />
ADAMS: Some time ago we decided that the J-curve stood for<br />
Joke and we wanted to have ajoke-led recovery. The last.<br />
joke I heard from the Prime Minister's own personal lips<br />
was marvellous. What is the difference between a squashed<br />
possum and a dead Politician on the Hlume Highway? And I<br />
didn't know. And he said the difference was there skid marks<br />
before the possum. Now f am sure we are get an even better<br />
joke out of him now so here goes with a big fanfare.<br />
PM: I have no notice about this. 1 haven't got a current<br />
Joke that is tellable. But I will tell you a thing which<br />
will appeal to Your literary background, Phillip. You would<br />
remember Richard Brindsley Sheridan. </p>
<p>ADAMS: Knew him well, he was in my branch.<br />
PM: In your branch. You know1( as a playwright, of course,<br />
don't you?<br />
ADAMS: Yes.<br />
PM: Of course, he was really, in his time, better<br />
known as a politician. H-e was Whig politician. He was one<br />
of these politicians of those, times who didn't seem to be<br />
absolutely bound by the party Whip arid lie used to criticise<br />
his own party. And they brought in this piece of legislation.<br />
And by the way, ho was recognised as one of the greatest<br />
orators not only of his day but, arguably, some have put<br />
him as the greatest oraLor ever in the House of Commons.<br />
And so his party brought in this legislation arid lie didn't like<br />
it. And his comments on it worte very, very critical and<br />
included this memorable phrase. It I. s not a joke, I just<br />
think it is a great phrase. Hie said " It have often heard<br />
of people banging their head against a brick wall, this must<br />
surely be the first time in the whole of history wheni they<br />
have expressly erected a wall for that purpose"<br />
ADAMS: It got a big response Bob.<br />
PM: I just wanted to add to it and say well the twist of<br />
it is with the Liberals and the National Party and the Democrats<br />
voting against the Australia Card bill, this must be the<br />
first time a party and a group of politicians have, by their<br />
action in rejecting a piece of legislation, created a wall<br />
for banging their heads against because I can assure between<br />
now and the day the election is held I will be banging their<br />
heads against that wall because the Australia Card legislation<br />
is the most certain way of beating the Lax cheats and the<br />
welfare frauds. And, by their action. they have made themselves<br />
the protectors of the tax cheats and the welfare frauds.<br />
ADAMS: They have been warned.<br />
PM; They have been warned.<br />
ADAMS: Thank you Prime Minister, it was great to talk to<br />
you. PM: It was great to talk with you, my friend. All the best.<br />
ADAMS: Thanks Bob.<br />
