EMBARGO 8.00 P~ rm. SATURDJAY 90 JUNE 197LI<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
TO THE SECOND NATIONA~ L CONVENTION OF THE INDUJSTRIAL RELATIONS<br />
SOCIETY " INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS THE POWER GAME"<br />
CHEVRON HOTEL, SUJRFERS PARADISE, SATURDAY 29 JUNEF 3,97<br />
THIS IS MY SECOND ADDRESS AS PRIME MINISTER TO THE<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SOCIETY OF AUSTRALIA. SINCE I SPOKE TO<br />
YOU JUST OVER A YEAR AGO AT TERRIGAL, I SUPPOSE I HAVE LEARNED<br />
MORE ABOUT THE SORT OF " POWER GAME" THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE<br />
BRITISH TV' SERIES THAT CARRIED THAT TITLE. IHAVE HAD ONE<br />
EXPERIENCE THAT NEVER SEEMED TO THREATEN THE ORDERED<br />
MACHIAVELLIAN LIVES OF THE PROTAGONISTS OF THAT SERIES-I<br />
HAVE SURVIVED AN ELECTION. HAVING SAID THAT, I WILL IGNORE THE<br />
OBVIOUS ALLUSION To TV DRAMAS CONTAINED IN THE TITLE OF<br />
YOUR SEMINAR, INSTEAD, FOR A MOMENT I W4ILL PURSUE AN ANALOGY<br />
APPROPRIATE TO OUR SPORTS-MINDED NATION.<br />
IN THE POWER GAME OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS A MOST PECULIARLY MIXED ROLE. AS A<br />
LAW-MAKER, IT HAS SOME OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE GOVERNING BODY 0-<br />
A SPORTING CODE. IT HAS SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS OF AN UMPIRE OR<br />
REFEREE IN HELPING . TO SEE THOSE RULES IMPLEMENTED. AT TIMES<br />
IT ACTS AS A COACH IN HELPING TO GUIDE THE OPPOSING TEAMS IN THE<br />
PLAYING OF THE GAME. AND, AS A MAJOR EMPLOYER, THE GOVERThIENT<br />
IS ALSO, OF COURSE, A KEY PLAYER. THE ONLY ROLE IT H4AS<br />
ABANDONED SINCE 1972 IS THAT OF TRYING INEFFECTUALLY TO BE THE<br />
EQUIVALENT OF THlE JUDICIAL TRIBUNAL OF A SPORT IN COLLECTING<br />
FINES FOR WHAT SOME MIGHT JUDGE TO BE FOUL PLAY. DESPITE THE<br />
COMPLEXITY OF ITS POSITION, THE OBJECTIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
ROLE IS CLEAR: IT'MUST SEEK TO REDUCE THE HEAT, MINIMISE THE<br />
CONFLICT IN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. </p>
<p>TO DO THIS IT MUST PURSUE TWO GOALS. IT MUST CREATE<br />
A BODY OF LAWS TO ENABLE AUSTRALIA TO HAVE THE MOST MODERN<br />
INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM TO AV/ OID UNNECESSARY CONFLICTS. IT MUST ALSO<br />
HELP CREATE AN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE<br />
FINANCIAL CAUSES OF MANY DISPUTES ARE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE<br />
ERADICATED. THE PROVISION OF MODERN INDUSTRIAL LAWS WAS THE PRIME<br />
AIM OF THE AMENDMENTS TO THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION ACT<br />
WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED INTO THE PARLIAMENT LAST YEAR.<br />
THESE AMENDMENTS WERE TWICE REJECTED BY THE SENATE AND THE<br />
GOVERNMEN4T WAS OBLIGED TO SHELVE THEM, AT LEAST TEMPORARILY.<br />
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AIMS CONTAINED IN THOSE AMENDMENTS<br />
WAS THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE AMALGAMATION OF TRADE UNIONS.<br />
THE EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF UNIONS IS ONE OF THE GREAT<br />
PROBLEMS DEDEVILLING INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
THERE HAS BEEN A SLIGHT DECLINE IN THE NUMEER OVER THE YEARSFROM<br />
375 IN 1956 TO 305 IN -1972 B3UT THAT IS STILL TOO MANY.<br />
OF THOSE UNIONS, 158 HAD LESS THAN 1,000 MEMBERS; 82 HAD BETWEEN<br />
1,00Q0 AND 5,000 MEMBERS; 28 BETWEEN 5,000 AND 20,000;<br />
23 BETWEEN 20,000 AND 50,000; AND ONLY 14 HAD A MEMBERSHIP<br />
OF OVER 50,0OOR. ONE NEEDS TO LOOK NO FURTHER THAN GOVERN4MENT<br />
INSTRUMENTALITIES TO GET SOME IDEA OF THE EFFECT THIS HAS.<br />
A TOTAL OF 28 UNIONS ARE REPRESENTED IN THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL' S<br />
DEPARTMENT; WORKERS IN THE SYDNEY MAIL EXCHANGE ARE COVERED<br />
BY NO LESS THAN 20 UNIONS. THE WORKFORCE OF TRANS-AUSTRALIA<br />
AI . RLINES IS COVERED BY NO FEWER THAN 26 UNIONS, THiE MEN AND<br />
WOMEN EMPLOYED BY THE COMMONWEALTHi RAILWAYS DELONG TO J14 UNIONS. </p>
<p>I NEED ONLY DESCRIBE AN AIRLINE JOURNEY TO INDICATE THE<br />
ABSURD COMPLEX-ITY THAT EXISTS. IF I WERE TO FLY FROM SYDNEY TO<br />
MELBOURNE I WOULD RUN THE GAMUT OF AT LEAST 3 UNIONS. MY FLIGHT<br />
BOOKING W1OULD BE TAKEN BY A MEMBER OF THE FEDERATED CLERKS UNION.<br />
I WOULD BE DRIVEN TO THE AIRPORT BY A MEMBER OF THE TRANSPORT<br />
111ORKERS UNION. MY PLANE SEAT WOULD BE ALLOCATED BY A MEMBER OF<br />
THE FEDERATED CLERKS UION. MY BAGGAGE WOULD BE TAKEN BY A<br />
MEMIBER OF THE TRANSPORT WORKERS UN'IONI. THE PASSENGER LIST WOULD BE<br />
C HECKED BY A MEMBER OF THE AIRPORT TRANSPORT OFFICERS' FEDERATION.<br />
SECURITY FOR THE FLIGHT WOULD BE HANDLED BY A MEMBER OF THE<br />
FEDERATED MISCELLANEOUS WORKERS' UNION. THE AIRCRAFT WOULD BE<br />
CHECKED BY MEMBERS OF THE PROFESSIONAL PADio ENGINEERS INSTITUTE<br />
OR THE AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY OF ENGINEERS OR THE AMALGAMATED ! AETAL<br />
tIORKERS' UNION OR THE ELECTRICAL TRADES UNION, OR THE ASSOCIATION<br />
OF LICENSED AIRCRAFT ENGINEERS. THE PLANE WOULD BE FUELED BY A<br />
MEMBER OF THE TRANSPORT ! JORKERS UNION. IT WOUJLD BE CLEARED FOR<br />
TAKE-OFF BY THE CIVIL AIR OPERATORS' OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. IT WOULD<br />
BE CREWED BY MEMBERS OF THE FEDERATION OF AIR PILOTS, THE FLIGHT<br />
ENGINEERS ASSOCIATION AND THE AIR HOSTESSES ASSOCIATION, THE FOOD<br />
SERVED ON THE PLANE WOULD BE COOKED BY THE LIQUOR TRADES UNION.<br />
THE EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF UNIONS CREATES PROBLEMS BOTH FOR<br />
THEIR MEMBERS AND FOR THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. THE FRAGMENTATION<br />
OF UNION RESOURCES IN TERMS OF STAFF, FINANCE AND FACILITIES<br />
IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR WORK. THE<br />
RESEARCH RESOURCES OF UNIONS ARE MEAGRE AND SUFFER BADLY IN<br />
ANY COMPARISON WITH HIGHLY ORGANISED EMPLOYER ORGANISATIONS.<br />
THE FRAGMENTA1ION CAN LEAVE UNIONS IN AN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE POSITION<br />
IF THEY ARE DEALING WITH A WILL ORGANISED EMPLOYERS GROUP OR A<br />
A<br />
MAJOR COMPANY. TAKE THIE EXAMPLE OF EM~ PLOYEES OF fM ILT I-NAT IONAL<br />
CORPORDATION. THE AUSTRALIAN EMPLOYEES OF SUCH A CORPORATION MIGHT </p>
<p>WELL BELONG To 6 UNIONS OR MlORE. IN ANY NEGOTIATIONS THOSE UNIONS'<br />
ARE CONFRONTED BY AN ORGANISATION WITH THE BACKING OF ENORMOUS<br />
FINANCIAL POWER AND OTHER RESOURCES. IT PLACES THE EMPLOYEES AT<br />
AN ENORMOUS DISADVANTAGE FOR THEIR INTERESTS TO RE REPRESENTED<br />
BY DIFFERENT GROUPS OF VARYING SIZE WHEN CONFRONTED BY SUCH<br />
CORPORATE COHESION. THE DISPERSAL OF UNIONS MUST ALSO INEV/ ITABLY<br />
DIMINISH THEIR POLITICAL INFLUENCE.<br />
THE COMMUNITY SUFFERS BECAUSE THE LARGE NUMBER OF UNIONS GIVES<br />
RISE TO DEMARCATION DISPUTES WHICH ARE A COMMON OCCURRENCE IN THIS<br />
COUNTRY. AN EXAMPLE OF THE PROBLEM CAN BE FOUND IN THE<br />
POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S TEPARTMENT WHERE AT LEAST SIX UNIONS OR<br />
ASSOCIATIONS ARE ELIGIBLE TO COVER EMPLOYEES IN THE TECHNICAL<br />
GRADES. ACTION BY ONE ORGANISATION TO IMPROVE THE CAREER<br />
STRUCTURE OR TO CHANGE THE RANGE OF WORK OF ITS MEMBERS CAN<br />
IMPINGE ON THE RIGHTS OF MEMBERS OF OTHER ORGANISATIONS.<br />
DEMARCATION DISPUTES ARE A READY SOURCE OF PUBLIC<br />
EXASPERATION WITH UNIONS. IT IS NOT SURPRISING IF THE PUBLIC<br />
BECOMES EXTREMELY ANNOYED THAT IT IS DENIED A BASIC SERVICE FOR<br />
SOME TIME BECAUSE OF A STRIKE FOUGHT NOT EVEN OVER WAGES AND<br />
CONDITIONS PUT BECAUSE OF A POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN UNIONS.<br />
YET THE CONCILIATION AND PREITRATION ACT AT PRESENT<br />
MAKES IT UNNECESSARILY DIFF ICULT FOR UNIONS TO AMALGAMATE.<br />
AT PRESENT, FOR AN AMALGAMATION PROPOSAL TO BE ADOPTED, TWO<br />
CONDITIONS MUST BE SATISFIED: AT LEAST HALF THlE MEMBERS MUST<br />
VOTE AND MORE THAN HALF OF THE FORMAL VOTES MUST BE IN FAVOUR<br />
OF THE AMALGAMATION. IN CONTRAST, THE GOVERNMENT ' S AMENDMENTS<br />
WOULD MAKE IT NECESSARY MERELY FOR A MAJORITY OF THOSE VOTING<br />
TO APPROVE OF AMIALGAMIATION; IT WOULD NO LONGER BE NECESSARY<br />
FOR 50% OF THE UNION MEMBERS INVOLVED TO VOTE ON THE ISSUE. 11/ 5 </p>
<p>ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN TWICE REBUFFED BY THE SENATE, THE<br />
GOVERNMENT WILL PERSIST IN ITS ATTEMPTS TO ACHIEVE THIS VITAL<br />
LEGISLATIVE CHANGE.<br />
THE GlOVERNMENT IS ALSO DETERMINED TO SIMPLIFY THE<br />
PRESENT SYSTEM OF INDUSTRIAL REGISTRATION. AUSTRALIA HAS FIVE<br />
INDUSTRIAL ARBITRATION REGISTRATION SYSTEMS. THE AUSTP LIAN<br />
CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION ACT REQUIRES AN EMPLOYER OR<br />
EMPLOYEE ORGANISATION TO BE REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT BEFORE<br />
IT CAN REPRESENT ITS MEMBERS IN THE AUSTRALIAN CONCILIATION<br />
AND ARBITRATION SYSTEM. THERE IS A S: MILAR REQUIREMENT IN THE<br />
INDUSTRIAL ARBITRATION LEGISLATION IN hIEW SOUTH ' JALES, QUEENSLAND,<br />
SOUTi AUSTRALIA AND ' ESTERN AUSTRALIA. THE EFFECT OF<br />
REGISTRATION UNDER EACH OF THESE LEGISLATIVE SYSTEMS IS THAT<br />
EACH REGISTRATION CREATES AN ORGANISATION WITH ITS OWN LEGAL<br />
IDENTITY. THIS CREATES ABSURD COMPLICATIONS IN INDUSTRIAL<br />
RELATIONS, COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE POINTED OUT BY THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
INDUSTRIAL COURT IN THE CASE OF MOORE V DOYLE IN FEBRUARY ] 069.<br />
AT THE CONCLUSION OF THEIR JUDGMENT IN THAT CASE, CHIEF JUSTICE<br />
SPICER, MR JUSTICE SMITHERS AND PIR JUSTICE KERR ( AS HE THEN WAS)<br />
SAID: " A SYSTEM OF TRADE UNION ORGANISATION IS URGENTLY<br />
NEEDED WHICH WOULD ENABLE THE ONE BODY TO REPRESENT<br />
ITS RELEVANT MEMBERS IN BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE<br />
ARBITRATION SYSTEMS AND IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR<br />
FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES TO EXAMINE THE QUESTION<br />
WHETHER ORGANISATIONS AND TRADE UNIONS'CAN BE<br />
PROVIDED WITH SUCH A SYSTEM.<br />
WE HAVE DECIDED TO REFER OUR JUDGMENT IN THIS MATTER AND </p>
<p>6.<br />
THESE REMARKS TO THE ATTORNEY-C-ENERAL FOR THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
IN THE HOPE THAT IT MAY BE POSSIBLE, AFTER CONSULTATION<br />
BETWEEN COMONWEALTH AND STATE ATTORNEYS-GENERAL, THE TRADE<br />
UNIONS, BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE, AND OTHER INTERESTED<br />
GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES TO ARRANGE FOR THE EXAMINATION OF<br />
THE IMPORTANT ORGANISATIONSL MATTERS TO WHICH WE HAVE<br />
REFERRED.<br />
DESPITE THIS URGENT APPEAL THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT AND<br />
THE NON-LABOR STATE GOVERNMENTS DID NOTHING. SO IN JANUARY LAST<br />
YEAR I WROTE TO THE PREMIERS OF NEW SOUTH WALES, QUEENSLAND AND<br />
WESTERN AUSTRALIA SU3GESTING THAT THEY MIGHT CONSIDER ADOPTING A<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN PROPOSAL AIMED AT PROVIDING SOLUTIONS TO THE<br />
PROBLEM. THE PROPOSAL PROVIDED FOR THE " RECOGNITION" OF A STATE<br />
BRANCH OF A FEDERAL UNION UNDER STATE INDUSTRIAL ARBITRATION<br />
LEGISLATION. A " RECOGNISED" STATE PRANCH WOULD NOT HAVE A LEGAL<br />
IDENTITY DISTINCT FROM THE FEDERAL UNION BUT WOULD EXIST AS A<br />
PORTION OF THE FEDERAL UNION AND ACT AS THE FEDERAL UNION WITHIN<br />
THE STATE INDUSTRIAL JURISDICTION. THE PREMIER OF OUEENSLAND<br />
INDICATED THAT HIS STATE DID NOT FAVOUR THE FEDERAL BODY OF THE<br />
UNION BEING THE BODY RECOGNISED UNDER STATE LAW. THE OREMIER OF<br />
NEW SOUTH '! ALES SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS STILL CONSIDERING<br />
THE MATTER.. HESTERN AUSTRALIA DID NOT REPLY.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS APPOINTED AN INQUIRY UNDER<br />
MR JUSTICE L. B. SWEENEY TO EXAMINE THE PROBLEMS DISCLOSED DY THE<br />
MOORE V DOYLE CASE. THE JUDGE HAS BEEN ASKED TOEXAMINE THE<br />
DESIRABILITY OF A SYSTEM OF ORGANISATION AND/ OR REGISTRATION WHICH<br />
WOULD ENABLE THE ONE BODY TO REPRESENT ITS MEMBERS IN BOTH<br />
AUSTRALIAN AND STATE ARBITRATION SYSTEMS, HOW THIS COULD EE<br />
ACHIEVED, THE EFFECT OF EXISTING REGISTRATION SYSTEMS ON EMPLOYER </p>
<p>AND EMPLOYEE ORGANISATIONS AND THE PROBLEMS AND DIFFICULTIES TO<br />
WHICH THE P. RESENT SYSTEMS GIVE RISE. WESTERN AUSTRALIA AND<br />
N~ EW SOUTH WALES HAVE INDICATED THEY WOULD CO-OPERATE WITH THE<br />
COMMITTEE, WHILE THE Q~ UEENSLAND PREMIER SAID, AFTER THE OUEENSLAND<br />
INDUSTRIAL REGISTRAR HAD INFORMED M4R JUSTICE SWEENEY OF THE<br />
STATE GOVERNMENT' S POLICY, THAT THE QUESTION OF HOW HIS GOVERNMENT<br />
IVOULD BE ABLE TO FURTHER ASSIST THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE KEPT<br />
UNDER REVIEW. HIS REPORT IS EXPECTED ABOUT THE END OF THIS<br />
MONTI]. ITURN NOW TO THE SECOND GOAL WHICH THE GOVERNMENT<br />
MUST PURSUE TO HELP MAINTAIN HARMONIOUS INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS:<br />
THE CREATION OF AN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH<br />
THE FINANCIAL CAUSES OF MANY DISPUTES ARE MINJIMISED. IT<br />
SHOULD BE CLEAR TO ALL BY NOWI THAT MUCH OF THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
ACTIVITY IS DEDICATED TO THIS END. OUR POLICIES AND PROGRAMS<br />
HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TOWARDS. REDUCING AND EV/ ENTUALLY ERADICATING<br />
INEQUALITIES IN OUR SOCIETY WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAINTAINING<br />
A HEALTHY PATTERN OF EFFICIENT ECONOMIC GROWTH. AT THIS POINT<br />
I WOULD LIKE PARTICULARLY TO EMPHASISE OUR EFFORTS TO CREATE A<br />
MORE EQUAL SOCIETY.. THE ACHIEVEMENT OF EQUALITY MEANS MUCH MORE<br />
THAN SIMPLY PROVIDING HIGHER WAGES AND SALARIES. IT MEANS<br />
PROVIDING A RANGE OF COMMUNITY SERVICES TO SATISFY THE<br />
REASONABLE NEEDS OF ALL CITIZENS A1ND TO CREATE REASONABLE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL CITIZENS. -THIS IN TURN MEANS THE<br />
CREATION OF THE BEST COMMUNITY SERVICES THAT THE COUNTRY<br />
CAN AFFORD. IT IS NO COINCIDENCE THAT IN OUR FIRST iSMONTHS<br />
IN OFFICE WE HAVE CONCENTRATED SO MUCH OF OUR EFFORTS IN THE<br />
FIELDS OF EDUCATION, HEALTH AND URBAN AND REGIONAL DFVELOPMENT. </p>
<p>AN INCREASED WAGE ALONE IS NOT GOING TO ENSURE THAT A WORKER'S<br />
CHILDREN WILL RECEIVE A PROPER EDUCATION. AN INCREASED WAGE<br />
WILL NOT GUARANTEE THAT WORKER'S FAMILY ACCESS TO HIGH OUALITY<br />
MEDICAL AND HOSPITAL CARE AT A REASONABLE COST. AN INCREASED<br />
WAGE WILL NOT GRANT HIM ADEOUATE TRANSPORT, ROADS, CHILD CARE<br />
FAC&gt;' flIES, RECREATION OUTLETS AND THE LIKE. IT WILL NOT<br />
EVEN NECESSARILY GUARANTEE HIM PROPER HOUSING, PARTICULARLY<br />
I t~ TVES IN A CITY WITH RAMPANT INFLATION IN LAND PRICES.<br />
THE PROVISION OF ADEQ7UATE SERVICES AND OPPORTUNITIES<br />
OF THIS KINE ;' 7UST DEPAND ONIBROAD COMMUNITY ACTION; AND THAT<br />
MEANS GOVERNMENTIACTION. THAT IS WHY SO MUCH OF OUR PUBLIC<br />
SPENDING HAS BEEN DIRECTED TOWARDS BUILDING NEW SCHOOLS AND<br />
TRAINING NEW TEACHERS; TOWARDS ESTABLISHING COMMUNITY HEALTH<br />
CENTRES AND HOSPITALS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO WHERE PEOPLE<br />
( NOT JUST DOCTORS) LIVE; TOWARDS THE PROVISION OF BASIC<br />
FACILITIES IN THE MASS OF SUBURBS WHICH HAVE PEEN NEGLECTED<br />
SINCE THEIR EMERGENCE IN THE POST-WAR YEARS; TOWARDS THE<br />
CREATION OF NEW CITIES; AND TOWARDS THE BUILDING OF MORE<br />
HOUSING FOR LOW-INCOME EARNERS.<br />
FORTUNATELY, THE ELECTORATE HAS JUST GIVEN THE<br />
GOVERNMENT A FURTHER THREE YEARS IN WHICH TO PURSUE THESE<br />
GOALS. THEIR FULL ACHIEVEMENT WILL, OF COURSE, TAKE LONGER<br />
THAN THAT. JBUT WHEN THEY ARE ACHIEVED, WAGE AND SALARY<br />
EARNERS WILL NO LONGER BE QUITE AS DEPENDENT ON THEIR PAY<br />
PACKETS FOR THE SATISFACTION OF THESE NEEDS. THIS WILL, IF<br />
YOU LIKE, MOVE ALL OF US AT LEAST SOME DISTANCE AWAY FROM<br />
WHAT MIGHT BE TERMED AN INCOMES MENTALITY. EQUALITY OF<br />
OPPORTUNITIES AND SERVICES MUST IN ITSELF REDUCE SOME OF THE<br />
CAUSES OF CONFLICT IN OUR SOCIETY AND IN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. </p>
<p>TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS AND INDEED TO ACHIEVE ANY<br />
KIND OF RE-ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WE MUST, OF COURSE,<br />
MAINTAIN A HEALTHY ECONOMY. W'OULD EMPHASISE MY USE OF THE<br />
WORD MAINTAIN IN MY LAST SENTENCE.. CONTRARY TO WHAT SOME<br />
PROPHETS OF DOOM ARE NOW SAYING, ' IUSTRALIA HAS AN ESSENTIALLY<br />
HEALTHY ECONOMY. D) ESPITE WHAT OUR ECONOMIC JEREMIAHS MIGHT<br />
SAY, THE LAST 18 MONTHS HAVE BEEN MARKED BY EXCEPTIONALLY<br />
RAPID GROWTH. LET ME GIVE A FEW EXAMPLES TO DEMONSTRATE THIS.<br />
GROSS NATIONAL EXPENDITURE ROSE IN REAL TERMS BY 12.4 PERCENT<br />
IN THE YEAR TO THE MIARCH QUARTER OF 19/ 4, COMPARED WITH<br />
IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND PERCENT IN TH E YEAR BEFORE THAT.<br />
GROSS NON-FARM PRODUCTION INCREASED BY PERCENT COMPARED WITH<br />
4.2 PERCENT AND 3.3 PERCENT IN THE PREVIOUS TWO. YEARS. CIVILIAN<br />
EMPLOYMENT INCREASED BY MORE THAN 200,000 OR 4., 5 PERCENT, THE<br />
LARGEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN ANY COMPARABLE PERIOD SINCE 11I<br />
ALTHOUGH THE SHARE MARKET . MIGHT NOT REFLECT IT, COMPANY INCOME<br />
HAS INCREASED BY 18. q PERCENT.<br />
SOME PROBLEMS DO EXIST IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES. RUT I T<br />
WOULD BE WRONG TO SEE ALL OF THOSE DIFFICULTIES AS INDICATING<br />
AN OVERALL ECONOMIC PROBLEM OR, TO BE DEFENSIVE FOR A MOMENT,<br />
TO BLAME THE GOVERNMENT FOR THEM. IT IS SURELY AT LEAST<br />
QUESTIONABLE FOR A CAR MANUFACTURER TO BLAME THE 93OVERNMENT FOR<br />
ITS FAILURE TO CAPTURE A LARGE ENOUGH SHARE OF THE MARKET FOR<br />
ITS PRODUCTS WHEN THE LATEST FIGURES FOR MOTOR VEHICLE<br />
REGISTRATIONS SHOWS THEY ARE RUNNING AT A HIGH LEVEL. I I/ i q </p>
<p>THE FACT REMAINS, HOWEVER, THAT AUSTRALIA, IN COMMON<br />
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, IS UNDERGOING A PERIOD OF EXCESSIVE<br />
INFLATION,' IN CASE ANYONE SHOULD THINK THAT THIS IS A NEW<br />
DISCOVERY FOR US, SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER'MY ADDRESS TO THE<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SOCIETY IN ( MAY LAST YEAR" " IT HAS<br />
ALREADY BECOME CLEAR," I SAID THEN, " THAT THE THREAT OF<br />
INFLATION WILL BE THE MOST SERIOUS ECONOMIC PROBLEM FACING<br />
OVER NMENT." AT ANOTHER POINT IN MY ADDRESS I SAID:<br />
" LET THERE BE NO DOUBT OF HOW SERIOUSLY my GOVERNMENT REGARDS<br />
THIS PROBLEM OR THE STRENGTH OF OUR DETERMINATION TO TACKLE IT."<br />
' E HAVE EXHIBITED SUCH A DETERMINATION EVER SINCE WE CAME INTO<br />
OFFICE. As SOON AS WE-WERE ELECTED IN 1972, WE REVALUED THE<br />
DOLLAR TO CUT THE PRICE OF IMPORTS AND WE ESTABLISHED THE<br />
DEPOSIT REQUIREMENT TO REDUCE THE INFLOW OF FOREIGN MONEYS.<br />
WE EFFECTIVELY REVALUED THE DOLLAR TWICE AFTER THAT. V! E HAVE<br />
TIGHTENED MONETARY POLICY TO REMOVE THE EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF<br />
MONEY IN THE ECONOMY, IN JULY WE CUT ALL TARIFFS By 25/ 1 IN<br />
ORDER TO DECREASE THE PRICE OF IMPORTS AND TO RESTRAIN LOCAL<br />
PRICE RISES BY INCREASING COMPETITION. W" E HAVE ESTABLISHED THE<br />
PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL WHICH HAS UNDOUBTEDLY PLAYED A<br />
SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN RESTRAINING PRICE INCREA-0ES. ',-;. ITEVER OUR<br />
CRITICS MIGHT SAY,. WE EVEN RESTRAINED THE GROWTH IN GOVERNMENT<br />
EXPENDITURE, / 11 </p>
<p>DESPITE THESE MEASURES, WE NEED TO TAKE FURTHER<br />
ACTION TO BEAT INFLATION. THE VERY BUOYANCY WHICH HAS BEEN<br />
A FEATURE OF OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS HAD ITS DISADVANTAGES;<br />
DEMA1ND HAS CONTINUED TO BE EXCESSIVE. THAT IS WHY, AT THE<br />
PREMIERS CONFERENCE EARLIER THIS MONTH, I ANNOUNCED FURTHER<br />
MEASURES TO CURB INFLATION. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
IS EXAMINING ITS OWN EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS SO THAT IT CAN PLAY<br />
ITS PART, SAID THEN THAT WE WOULD LIMIT THE BUDGET ALLOCATION<br />
FOR THE POST OFFICE IN 107LI-1075 TO NOT MORE THAN THE ACTUAL<br />
AMOUNT ALLOCATED IN 1973-1974; WE WOULD PUT RESTRAINTS ON<br />
CAPITAL WOtR-KS AND OTHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURE BY THE GOVERNMENT;<br />
WE WOULD ABOLISH THE PETROLEUM PRODUCTS PRICES SUBSIDY SCHEME;<br />
WE WOULD LIMIT THE GROWTH OF THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC SERVICE;<br />
WE WOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT RECOMMEN DEDFOR SPENDING ON ROADS<br />
BY THE BUREAU OF ROADS. AT THE SAME TIME THE GOVERNMENT FOUND<br />
IT NECESSARY TO HOLD DOWN THE INCREASE IN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE<br />
TO BE PROVIDED TO THE STATES IN 1074-1975, IN DOING THIS, I<br />
CALLED ON THE STATES TO PLAY THEIR PART IN BEATING INFLATION.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S MEASURES HAVE INEVITABLY AROUSED SOME<br />
HOSTILITY. IT TAS BEING SAID THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS<br />
FORCING THE STATES TO RAISE TAXES AND CHARGES. IT IS ONLY FAIR<br />
TO POINT OUT THAT IT COULD BE JUST AS EASILY SAID THAT THE STATES<br />
ARE TRYING TO FORCE THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT T'O RAISE IT'S TAXES<br />
AND CHARGES. FOR IF MORE MONEY IS NEEDED FOR STATE SERVICES<br />
IT CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE IN ONE OF ONLY TWO WAYS: EITHER BY THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH RAISING MORE MONEY A1ND PASSING IT ON TO THE STATES<br />
OR BY THE STATES THEMSELVES RAISING EXTRA MONEY. IT IS ALL VERY<br />
WELL FOR THE STATES TO EXPECT THE COMMONWEALTH TO CARRY THE FULL<br />
OPPROBRIUM FOR UNPOPULAR MEASURES AIMED AT RAISING EXTRA MONEY. </p>
<p>IDO NOT THINK IT IS UNREASONABLE OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
TO EXPECT THE STATES TO SHARE IN SUCH PROBLEM. THERE IS ANOTHER<br />
POINT TO BE MADE ABOUT THE ACCUSATION THAT THE* AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT IS FORCING THE STATES TO RAISE TAXES AND CHARGES.<br />
OUR MAIN EMPHASIS HERE IS, IN FACT, ON ECONOMIC RATIONALITYPUBLIC<br />
ENTERPRISES -BOTH COMMON4WEALTH AND STATE MUST GO CLOSER<br />
TO PAYING THEIR OWN WAY; THEIR SERVICES MUST BECOME MORE CHARGES<br />
G4rU4S ERS AND LESS CHARGES ON TAXPAYERS. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY<br />
MUST BECOME MORE EFFICIENT. ADMITTEDLY ALL GOVERNMENTS IN<br />
AUSTRALIA FACE THE PROBLEM THAT IT IS LEFT TO THEM TO CONDUCT<br />
THE LEAST PROFITABLE ENTERPRISES. BUT THIS SHOULD BE wo EXCUSE<br />
FOR AVOIDING RATIONAL CHARGES AND EFFICIENT OPERATION. THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS ACCEPTING ITS SHARE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY<br />
IN THIS DIRECTION. IT ASKS NO MORE THAN4 THAT OF THE STATES.<br />
AT LEAST SOME OF THE CRITICISM THAT HAS BEEN-DIRECTED<br />
AGAINST US HAS COME FROM THE VERY PEOPLE WHO HAVE URGED ACTION<br />
UPON US AND EVEN AT TIMES OVER THE VERY MEASURES THEY HAVE<br />
SUGGESTED. THiE PRICE OF LAND AND HOUSING IS A GOOD EXAMPLE$<br />
ONE OF THE MOST DAMAGING ELEMENTS IN THE INFLATIONARY BOOM<br />
IN THE PAST YEAR OR SO HAS BEEN THE SOARING PRICE OF HOUSES.<br />
NIOW, DUE TO THE CUTTING DOWN OF-THE PREVIOUSLY EXCESSIVE FLOW<br />
OF FINANCE INTO BUILDING., HOUSE PRICES APPEAR TO BE TENDING TO<br />
FLATTEN OUT. PRICES OF COSTLIER HOUSES HAVE TENDED TO DROP.<br />
WHILE NO GOVERNMENT LIKES TO SEE INTEREST-RATES FOR HOME-BUYING<br />
INCREASE UNDULY, WE MUST PURSUE THIS SITUATION FOR A WHILE<br />
IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY CHANCE OF DELIVERING A SOLID BLOW TO<br />
INFLATION IN THIS AREA.-W~ E MUST DESTROY THE SELF-FULFILLING<br />
PROPHECY OF MANY PEOPLE THAT THE PRICE OF LAND WILL ALWAYS RISE<br />
MORE RAPIDLY THAN INFLATION. WE MUST ALSO REDUCE THE EXCESS DEMAND<br />
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR OF THE BUILDING INDUSTRY IF WE ARE TO </p>
<p>NONE OF THE DECISIONS THAT WE HAVE HAD TO MAKE HAVE<br />
BEEN EASY. WE WILL BE EXTREMELY VIGILANT. TO MAKE SURE THAT, IF<br />
ANY. UNPREDICTABLE OR EXTREME RESULTS FLOW FROM OUR MEASURES, WE<br />
CAN TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION. I CERTAINLY GIVE THAT PLEDGE IN<br />
THE AREA OF EMPLOYMENT. TESPITE THE MORE SENSATIONAL HEADLINES,<br />
DOES ANYONE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY,<br />
WHICH OWES ITS EXISTENCE AND SURVIVAL TO WAGE AND SALARY EARNERS,<br />
WOULD PURSUE POLICIES DESIGNED TO PUT THOSE PEOPLE OUT OF WORK?<br />
VE CAME INTO GOVERNMENT, PLEDGED TO RESTORE FULL EMPLOYMENT.<br />
WE ACHIEVED THAT OBJECTIVE VERY QUICKLY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO<br />
PURSUE IT. THE KIND OF ADJUSTMENT WHICH WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE<br />
TO THE USTRALIAN ECONOMY IS A COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT EXERCISE.<br />
WE HAVE ALREADY SHOWN A FLEXIBILITY OF APPROACH TO MEET<br />
CHANGED NEEDS OR OVERCOME PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT ARISE, OUR<br />
RELAXATION OF THE OVERSEAS CAPITAL DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS AND<br />
OF STATUTORY RESERVE DEPOSITS ARE EXAMPLES OF THIS FLEXIBILITY,<br />
THERE CAN BE NO DENYING, HOWEVER, THAT DEMAND INFLATION HAS<br />
BEEN A PROBLEM FOR SOME TIME AND ACTION TO COUNTER HAS BEEN<br />
NECESSARY. WHAT WE MUST DO NOW IS AVOID ANOTHER PROBLEM, COST-PUSH<br />
INFLATION. TO DO THIS, WE WILL NEED THE CO-OPERATION OF THE<br />
WHOLE COMMUNITY. INDUSTRY MUST MODERATE ITS PRICE INCREASES,<br />
As. I HAVE MENTIONED, THE PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL HAS HELPED<br />
IN THIS AREA, IF THE SENATE IS WILLING, WE WILL BAN COLLUSIVE<br />
PRICE FIXING BY COMPANIES, EMPLOYEES MUST ALSO PLAY THEIR PART.<br />
WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO HAVE ANNUAL WAGE AND SALARY INCREASES OF<br />
THE ORDER OF 20%. </p>
<p>-14-<br />
EMPLOYEES SEEKING THESE INCREASES ARE IN DANGER OF BECOMING<br />
LIKE SQUIRRELS IN A CAGED WHEEL: NO MATTER HOW FAST THEY RUN,<br />
THE WHEEL ( INFLATION) ONLY GOES FASTER THEY STILL DO NOT<br />
ADVANCE. IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS<br />
INTERESTED IN THE IDEA OF SOME FORM OF REGULAR COST OF LIVING<br />
ADJUSTMENTS TO WAGES AND SALARIES, OR WAGE INDEXATION, TO USE<br />
THE CURRENTLY POPULAR TERMa EMPLOYEES WOULD NO LONGER FEEL<br />
COMPELLED TO SEEK HUGE INCREASES AS A HEDGE AGAINST INFLATION<br />
IF THEY WERE OFFERED SOME REAL INCOME PROTECTION. ' 4E THEREFORE<br />
WELCOME THE DECISION OF THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION<br />
COMMISSION IN ITS 19/ LI ' NATIONAL WAGE CASE JUDGMENT TO CALL A<br />
CONFERENCE "/ TO-SEE WHETHER CONSENSUS CAN BE REACHED ON THE TWO<br />
COUNTERACTING ISSUES WAGE FIXATION METHODS AND WAGE<br />
I NDEXAT ION" THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT A REVIEW OF THESE ISSUES IS<br />
TIMELY. THE ' ATIONAL WAGE INCREASE OF ABOUT WEEK<br />
BECOMES QUITE MEANINGLESS IN PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF THE<br />
LOWER PAID WORKERS WHILE INDUSTRY AWARDS ARE BEING INCREASED<br />
BY AGREEMENT IN INDEPENDENT NEGOTIATIONS AT LEVELS RANGING<br />
FROM $ 15 TO $ 25 A WEEK. THE ULTIMATE RESULT OF THIS PROCESS<br />
WILL BE THAT THE WAGES OF WORKERS IN INDUSTRIES COVERED BY<br />
STRONG UNIONS WILL INCREASE DISPROPORTIONATELY TO THOSE OF<br />
WORKERS WHO RELY ENTIRELY ON THE COMMISSION FOR WAGE MOVEMENTS.<br />
THE IDEA OF WIDENING THE WAGE NEGOTIATING PROCESS WHICH TAKES<br />
PLACE IN SUCH INDUSTRIES AS THE METAL TRADES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS<br />
TO INCLUDE ALL SECTORS OF INDUSTRY IS, IN THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
VIEW, A GOOD ONE IF IT CAN BE ACHIEVED. </p>
