TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,<br />
MONDAY, 11 JULY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PMV: Well, we've had a real spectacle over the weekend, haven't we?<br />
Alexander Downer said he was going to take the fight up to the<br />
Government on ! he monarchy and before the bell goes for round one<br />
he is scurrying back to the seconds and throwing in the towel. And he<br />
says look, really, we don't really need this contest, both ideas are<br />
compatible, the Queen isn't really our head of state. To the<br />
monarchists he says look, I'll keep the Queen for you, tucked away, as<br />
long as you don't mind me labelling her quaint and irrelevant, and to<br />
the republicans he'll say, you don't really need a republic at all, our<br />
effective head of state is the Governor-General. It is riot The Queen.<br />
Now, can I just say that this is in contrast to a couple of things he said<br />
last month. He said the monarchy was a foundation stone of the<br />
Constitution June 3, The Canberra Times If you want to change<br />
to a republic you have to take away a foundation stone of our<br />
Constitution which is the monarchy." And, of course, over the weekend<br />
and under pressure, " Well, the monarchy doesn't matter at all it's<br />
irrelevant," he says. He says the Governor-General is our effective<br />
head of state, so he is not simply just leaving us to borrow the<br />
monarchy of another country, but he wants to damn Australians to<br />
having as their head of state the deputy of a foreign monarch. In other<br />
words, the anachronism is good enough, we just keep on rolling along<br />
with the anachronism.<br />
But, as I said this morning on radio, what this really reveals is how<br />
Alexander Downer would be under real pressure. Here he is on a<br />
debate on the republic and the monarchy, early in the piece, slipping<br />
and sliding around on the unarguable that the Queen is our head of<br />
state. And you wonder on the big decisions in the economic and </p>
<p>social areas as the Government has conducted them in the past the<br />
big buy down in fiscal policy in the 1980s, the removal of exchange<br />
control, the removal of tariffs, Mabo, the Uruguay Round. I mean,<br />
where would this sort of weakness and vacillation get us in terms of<br />
the prosecution of major national interests of Australians? As I said<br />
earlier today, Alexander Downer is a policy free zone. He is all words<br />
and no thoughts and no policies. And Mr Costello said, his deputy,<br />
after they were elected on 27 May, " In six weeks time we will be giving<br />
you a broad statement of principles and directions," and Mr Downer<br />
himself said " well, in a couple of months, I hope, a directional<br />
document which will make things quite clear." Well, they've been in<br />
office seven weeks and we haven't seen anything of the kind from<br />
either one of them.<br />
So, the fact of the matter is and the other thing, of course, if you<br />
actually have an empirical argument with him where he says the<br />
Queen is not our head of state and I say well, I beg to differ she is,<br />
she's central to our Constitution, he says I am personally abusing him<br />
and I am in the gutter. In other words, he will not even have a proper<br />
policy debate. If anyone crosses any of the policy lines I mean, he<br />
expects to go through life without being challenged on policy and once<br />
challenged says oh, this is shocking, I've been personally attacked by<br />
someone in the gutter.<br />
So, what I say to Alexander Downer is, show us the colour of your<br />
polices and let us at least on this issue see you stand for something<br />
honest. If you believe in the monarchy, say so. You've said so, stand<br />
by it and understand what it means that you're saying to the Australian<br />
community that this generation and the next generation, that we will<br />
continue to borrow the monarch of another country and under a<br />
Coalition government the effective head of state of this country would<br />
be the deputy of a foreign monarch and that's good enough for<br />
Australians. Now, that's where he stands. The Government stands four square<br />
against him on this and as I've said in the policy speech last year and<br />
subsequently, the Government believes that we owe it to Australians,<br />
to this generation, and particularly the next to our children, that their<br />
aspirations and their ideals and their identity ought and can best be<br />
reflected by Australians taking full charge of their own affairs with an<br />
Australian person as our head of state.<br />
J: Prime Minister, why isn't Alexander Downer right that the Governor-<br />
General is the effective head of state. Can you name an instance<br />
where the Queen or King before her has actually stepped in and over<br />
turned a decision of the Australian government? </p>
<p>PM: The head of state of this country is a monarch of another country. The<br />
head of state of Australia is the monarch of Great Britain. That's a<br />
simple, clear fact..<br />
J: hasn't made any difference ( inaudible)<br />
PM: And as the well, look, the fact has made all the difference in the<br />
world, it's made all the difference in the world because the powers of<br />
the monarch were the powers that were used on a number of<br />
occasions in this country and last, severely, in 1975.<br />
J: When he said no decisions made here are influenced at all by the<br />
royal family, that's not right?<br />
PM: . The central question is, here, there's only one question here,<br />
whether Australia should and can continue with its head of state<br />
Australia's head of state, the Queen of Australia, so called being the<br />
monarch of Great Britain. And not an Australian person.<br />
J: Well, the decisions of December 1975 were taken at Yarralumla, they<br />
weren't taken at Buckingham Palace.<br />
PM: They were taken under the monarch's powers.<br />
J: Would you seek to limit those powers, then?<br />
PM: Well, that's a different question.<br />
J: But that goes to the heart of it...<br />
PM: Well, let me decide what goes to the heart of it, thank you very much<br />
at least in this instance, seeing I'm giving the answers. The first thing<br />
is that the Government said that it would commission an expert group<br />
to look at these issues. It did. That. expert group has now reported<br />
and the government is considering that rerp-rt. And, in due time the<br />
cabinet will make a judgement about how such a shift to a republic<br />
ought best be executed.<br />
J: Prime Minister, Mr Beazley said yesterday that it would be a minimalist<br />
change; you, yourself have said that it is a simple proposition. If it is<br />
so simple why can't we see it?<br />
PM: Well, because, firstly, it hasn't been put together the change. And<br />
why should it be? We've struggled along now for, until 1993 with the<br />
monarch of Great Britain as our head of state. And the Labor Party, at<br />
its national conference, said it should be an objective of a Labor<br />
government to see Australia become a republic by the centenary of our<br />
federation. So, it is on that basis that the government has said that we<br />
should move towards a republic and that we will exercise these, our </p>
<p>consideration of these issues. But, the question minimalist, and the<br />
change, is not about a change to the way our system of government<br />
works. It is not about a change to the states, it is not about a change<br />
to the Senate, it's not about these things at all. It's about a change to<br />
an Australian head of state.<br />
J: Prime Minister, the Turnbull Committee saw all sorts of problems in a<br />
popularly elected president, accepting that the government is yet to<br />
take a final position, do you have a personal view on this? Would you<br />
be prepared to allow the Australian people to elect their own?<br />
PM: My personal view at this point doesn't matter very much because the<br />
cabinet is in the process of considering all of these issues and that is<br />
not the point. You've got here, the leader of the Opposition arguing<br />
weakly, the unarguable, that the Queen is not our head of state.<br />
J: But, Mr Downer did challenge you last week to rule out the possibility<br />
that you wanted to appoint the President?<br />
PM: I gave you the answer then and I'll give it to you now. There are two<br />
questions to be asked here. Do you believe in an Australian republic<br />
or do you believe in the monarchy? If the answer to the first question<br />
is in the affirmative, you move to question two. That is, how such a<br />
change should be executed and what the modalities might be. But, if<br />
you say in answer to question one, " No, I believe in the monarchy",<br />
you are disqualified from a debate about question two.<br />
J: You have signalled in the past being personally more disposed<br />
towards the idea of parliament electing a head of state rather than a<br />
popular election, is that still your inclination?<br />
PM: Well, this is a matter for the cabinet, not for here. But, Laurie Oakes<br />
wrote a column on my view about this some months ago and how I see<br />
it. But, again, these are preliminary thoughts. But, can I say this, no<br />
debate about this is going to save Alexander Downer slipping and<br />
sliding in his weakness all over the landscape, trying to say to his party<br />
and to the country, " Look, if you want the monarchy, I can keep it as<br />
long as I can brand it as quaint and irrelevant." And to the republicans<br />
he'll say, ' You don't really need a republic at all, a monarchy is good<br />
enough.<br />
J: Those preliminary thoughts which favour the Parliament over popular<br />
election haven't changed, have they?<br />
PM: Well, that's a matter for the cabinet, not for here.<br />
J: Is it a matter for the people, ultimately, will they be given that choice to<br />
make? </p>
<p>PM: Well, this is all going to be by referendum, that is the key point. This is<br />
a matter for the Australian people, in the end, to decide. This is why<br />
all this stuff about the constitution and how its... I've never seen more<br />
cowardly references to the constitution than from Mr Downer. And,<br />
then, we find on ABC radio today, he says, " Written constitutions aren't<br />
the be all and end all at all. It is the conventions."<br />
J: Do you think it is a fair enough question for people to say, if we're<br />
going to have a republic, if they ask what sort of republic?<br />
PM: No, I think the key question is whether Mr Downers assertion can be<br />
sustained in Australian political life. That is, whether or not the Queen<br />
of Great Britain is or is not the head of state of this country. That is the<br />
central question.<br />
J: ( inaudible).., what sort of republic?<br />
PM: Well, just wait your turn, Tom. I mean, it's all there in the report. Go<br />
and pick up the Turnbull report and have a read through it.<br />
J: Can you give them a reassurance that what we're talking about is<br />
something as simple as whether or not we have an Australian as a<br />
head of state and they'll be able to decide the rest?<br />
PM: Between now and the year 2001, or certainly between now and the<br />
time a referendum will be put, the Government will make its position<br />
abundantly clear on all of these things. As I said a week or two ago,<br />
forensically clear.<br />
J: Will it be clear before the next election?<br />
PM: Well, that's a matter for the cabinet to think about.<br />
J: Will there be a referendum about whether or not the President should<br />
be elected?<br />
PM: You weren't listening, David, I just told you, there will be a referendum<br />
put to the Australian people in due time so that Australia may become<br />
a republic by the year 2001.<br />
J: You also said, Mr Keating, that it's all going to be decided by<br />
referendum. Do you think that the question of how a president would<br />
be elected would actually be put to the people at a referendum, so<br />
they'd have the choice?<br />
PM: Well the Parliament will decide what referendum proposals go to the<br />
public. There's a very democratic process here. There are first of all<br />
referendum proposals that are put to parliament, parliament then<br />
carries them and they are put to the public. </p>
<p>J: Do you agree that until you've got your position, or the government's<br />
position, in the open, you are vulnerable .( inaudible)<br />
PM: Not at all, not at all. I've got a mandate for my position. I stood up in a<br />
national election, and a tightly fought one one where, in fact, at the<br />
time, everybody believed that the Government was behind and said<br />
I believe that Australia should become a republic, my party believes<br />
that, and we will set up an expert group to look at the machinery, we'll<br />
get some documentation there doesn't currently exist, we'll have a<br />
national debate. That's my position. I stand here with a mandate for<br />
that.<br />
J: But Mr Downer says you're plotting, that you're seeking to lI mean,<br />
can you say that<br />
PM: Well, Mr Downer's even...<br />
J: Can you say now that something as simple..<br />
PM: Well, take.. let's just..<br />
J can you say something as simple...<br />
PM: Well, lets just cast Mr Downer's view to one side by his weak assertion<br />
that the Queen of Great Britain isn't our head of state. I mean, that's<br />
the state of him.<br />
J: But nevertheless, can you reassure people now that the change you're<br />
looking at is as simple as whether Australia has an Australian as head<br />
of state? Just that no more, no less.<br />
PM: I'm here giving full expression to the Government's mandate. And the<br />
Government's mandate is to look forward to a republic by the year<br />
2001, to have a public debate which we've already generated -I<br />
mean, we're having it, aren't we? By having the documents, quite<br />
voluminous and tightly-written documents, in the political market place<br />
for the first time ever, and the Government has undertaken, and I<br />
repeat the undertaking, to have referendum proposals, in due time,<br />
proposals passed by the parliament. See the thing is this about Mr<br />
Downer. He thinks he can skate through life without policies and the<br />
country, the Australian community, can't get a move on, can't get a kick<br />
along without leadership. It can't get a kick along without decisions. It<br />
can't get a kick along without victories. And it is the victories, whether<br />
they be in Mabo or in the Uruguay Round, or in opening the economy<br />
up, we move ahead by decisions and leadership. You don't move<br />
ahead by vacillation and trying to please everybody at once,<br />
shillyshallying and compromising, as he's seeking to do. I mean, if<br />
that's the best the Liberals have to offer, after now 7 weeks in office, a </p>
<p>leader who can't even stand to defend a position he's taken on the<br />
monarchy, then the Liberal Party has, as I've said before, from<br />
Peacock to Howard to Peacock to Hewson to Downer, soft to hard to<br />
soft to hard to soft.<br />
J: Mr Keating, later this year when Cabinet gives it's response to the<br />
Turnbull Committee, do you expect it will indicate a preference to the<br />
way in which the present...<br />
PM: Look, in due time, the Government will make its thoughts on this<br />
subject known. I mean, this has been on for, now, a debate about our<br />
future has been on for over a century. And given that the government<br />
has said in 1993 that it considers that the full expression of Australian<br />
sovereignty can't be achieved and our aspirations can't be met by<br />
other than an Australian head of state, it's doing that which it has a<br />
mandate to do, that is embark upon a process where there is a debate<br />
and a set of proposals put and that will happen.<br />
J: By refusing to rule out the possibility of personal benefit inaudible...<br />
PM: Well, look, I'm not going to, look, look, let me tell you this. I'm not<br />
going to argue Alexander Downer's case for him, and nor should you.<br />
The key point is ' this-that you've got, I mean this must be, I can't<br />
imagine any other Western world leader in a democracy, particularly a<br />
Westminster style one, where you have the leader of the alternative<br />
government saying that the head of state isn't as the constitution says<br />
itis<br />
J: Iwas..<br />
PM: I mean that's where we are.<br />
J: I was going to put Graeme Campbell's view to you that you're doing<br />
this as a power grab?<br />
PM: Well, let me tell you this. There's, let me tell you this. Seriously and<br />
jocularly, there would be no way, no way whatsoever, no matter what<br />
the outcome is, that there is more power for the government or for me<br />
in this. But what I want to see is young Australians, in the main our<br />
children, have the chance to grow their own society with a full<br />
expression of Australian sovereignty and the full, and their full<br />
aspirations, and not have it compromised by an anachronism of having<br />
the deputy to a borrowed foreign monarch. OK, I'll take one more...<br />
J: You talked earlier about leadership, and also about what's owed to<br />
future generations of Australians in those terms, shouldn't the revamp<br />
of the Australian constitution, a 19th Century document as you said,<br />
written in the British foreign office, shouldn't it involve more than simply<br />
the head of sate... </p>
<p>8<br />
PM: Well, the constitutional...<br />
J: . shouldn't it involve things like four year terms and updating things like<br />
relations between the states and the Commonwealth....<br />
PM: Well, these things are all...<br />
J: . inaudible...<br />
PM: well look, it's a matter of how one prioritises any such thing. There's a<br />
constitutional centenary foundation, a bi-partisan group, which is<br />
engendering now a discussion about the constitution and all of its<br />
parts, fine. The Government supports that, it thinks its a good thing.<br />
But there is a central question, and in the Government's terms, a<br />
priority question, and that is should the Australian head of state be an<br />
Australian person? Now the Governments answered that question in<br />
the affirmative.<br />
J: Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
J: Prime Minister, inaudible. . the situation in North Korea?<br />
PM: Well, I'd just say that we're watching developments there closely. It<br />
seems by early signs that Kim Jong 11is succeeding to the leadership<br />
of North Korea. It seems, also, that the third round of talks between<br />
the United States and North Korea and the North-South Leaders<br />
Summit, is going to continue, if with a delay. So, I think there's a<br />
choice here for North Korea that's one of greater openness, or taking<br />
the uncertain path of developing a nuclear capability and isolating<br />
itself from world opinion. So I hope they see advantages in the former<br />
rather than the latter.<br />
ends. </p>
