EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 16 APRIL 1978<br />
ADDRESS TO THE NATION<br />
On Tuesday I will be leaving for Japan to hold discussions<br />
with the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr. Fukuda. These<br />
discussions will be of significance for Australia and tonight<br />
I wanted to tell you something about them.<br />
The discussions won't be about the bilateral matters between<br />
Japan and Australia. Mr. Anthony discussed these last month<br />
in great detail and indeed, a team of Japanese ministers will<br />
be here in a little while for further discussions with the<br />
Australian Government.<br />
The Japanese Prime Minister and myself will be discussing<br />
matters of wider importance; the world economy and trade.<br />
Some current trends in the world economy are indeed. disturbing.<br />
Last year factories, industries and mines produced much le-s<br />
than they were capable of producing. Although production<br />
did increase, it didn't increase anything like enough to<br />
create new jobs for all the young people enterirc the work forc<br />
As a result of that, unemployment remains much too high,<br />
especially amongst the young. 1<br />
A nuwmber of countries, including Auastralia, have had ika<br />
success in getting inflation down but inflation also a<br />
much too high.<br />
Furthermore, we have a situation in which there have buzn r. arkc$<br />
changes in international currency values, especiallv of the<br />
United States dollar. Against that total background a number<br />
of countries have reacted by increasing trade barriers t,;<br />
protect their own producers and that hurts the exports frora<br />
other countries.<br />
World leaders are concerned about these problems and have been<br />
stressing the need to find solutions. Over the next few months<br />
the world trading countries will be taking part in formal<br />
discussions and negotiations designed to increase world tradet<br />
designed to get national economies growing faster. It's vital<br />
that these discussions and negotiations be successful because<br />
if they are not there will only be increasing bitterness and<br />
increasing disillusionment as countries fight for a larger<br />
share of existing world markets. / 2 </p>
<p>In the preliminary sessions that have already been held<br />
very little progress has in fact been made and that's why<br />
I am concerned and the signs are that unless there is<br />
a major change of heart on the part of a number of countries<br />
the formal negotiations may fare little better. That's why<br />
discussions are urgently required between world leaders; to<br />
probe new ideas; to make sure that every avenue is explored<br />
that might lead to a solution. That's why I am going to<br />
talk with the Japanese Prime Minister.<br />
A little later, in the Caribbean, a selected group of countries,<br />
including Australia, will. be meeting to discuss the same<br />
matters to get the negotiations moving forward in a constructive<br />
way and later~ still there will be further discussions amongst<br />
other world leaders in the United States and in Europe.<br />
All of these meetings, and the actions that major countries<br />
take as a result of them, will be very important for Australia<br />
because we depend so much on international trade. We are<br />
so much affected by changes in international trade.<br />
Naturally, our own fight to overcome our economic problems will<br />
be made that much easier if there is sus4tained and lasting<br />
international economic recovery enabling us to sell substantially<br />
more of our own produce to the markets of the world. That will<br />
establish the circumstances in which our factories, our farms<br />
and our mines can create more jobs for more Australians.<br />
Accordingly, Australia is taking every opportunity to promote<br />
her own views responsibly and constructively in these major<br />
international forumas. In particular, we are looking at the<br />
position of ' Less developed countries because with their huge<br />
populations crying out for more food, for better roads, for<br />
more hospitals and schools, they have a very significant role<br />
to play in any sustained and lasting world recovery.<br />
I am hopeful t-Lhat the series of informal, vital discussions<br />
now beginning will help to create a new momentum, a new<br />
commitment to increasing world trade and restoring sound economic<br />
growth. There will be no quick and dramatic results because<br />
there are no simple and easy solutions, but solutions must be<br />
found and we will be doing everything we can to help find them.<br />
1978 is a critical year in deciding how quickly the world<br />
economy can return to the growth and stability that we enjoyed<br />
in the past, because the decisions made this year can well set: the<br />
pattern for the next ten. With so much at stake, Australia must<br />
be involved and we will be applying ourselves to these problems<br />
with vigour and determination. I know that I will have your<br />
support in this task which is so important to all of us.<br />
Goodnight. </p>
