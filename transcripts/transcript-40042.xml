    <content><![CDATA[<p>I welcome Tony Nutt’s appointment as the Liberal Party’s new Federal Director and thank him for taking on this vitally important role in our Party.</p>
<p>Tony is one of the Party’s most experienced professionals having been Deputy State Director in Western Australia, State Director in South Australia, Victoria and currently  New South Wales for the second time, where he oversaw the successful re-election campaign of the Baird Government earlier this year.</p>
<p>Tony was principal private secretary and later chief of staff in the office of Prime Minister John Howard. Most recently he has provided invaluable assistance as the Director of Transition in my office.</p>
<p>Tony steps into the shoes of departing Federal Director Brian Loughnane who has been an outstanding, invariably unflappable and highly successful Director for more than 12 years.</p>
<p>The Liberal Party’s Federal Executive unanimously endorsed Tony Nutt’s appointment today.</p>
