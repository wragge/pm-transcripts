PRIME MINISTER 77' 94<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN EMBASSY BEIRUT<br />
I am pleased to announce the Government has agreed in principle to re-open the<br />
Australian Embassy in Beirut in 1995. The Governiment is planning that the Embassy<br />
will be operational by around July next year.<br />
The Embassy was closed in 1984 as a result of the deteriorating security situation<br />
caused by Lebanon's civil war. Since then, Australia's interests in Lebanon have been<br />
handled through the Australian Embassy in Damascus. A small non-diplomatic office<br />
was established in Beirut in January 1993 to assist with visa processing and consular<br />
services. The decision wil be of immediate assistance to the 250,000 people of Lebanese origin<br />
who live in Australia and who have a strong interest in ease of communications<br />
between Australia and Lebanon.<br />
The Government's decision to re-establish an official Australian diplomatic presence in<br />
Beirut represents an expression of confidence in Lebanon's future and in the prospects<br />
for Australia's relations with Lebanon,<br />
Australia has welcomed the recent positive developments in the Middle East peace<br />
process and hopes that these developments will1 provide the impetus for the early<br />
conclusion of a comprehensive settlement, including a peace treaty between Lebanon<br />
and Israel. Australia also hopes that the Lebanese Government will press ahead with<br />
its program of national reconciliation after nearly two decades of sectarian conflict.<br />
The presence of an Australian Embassy in Beirut will help to foster trade and<br />
commercial links between the two countries. Lebanon's reconstruction program offers<br />
many opportunities for foreign construction and engineering companies. The<br />
Government hopes that Australian companies will be able to compete more effectively<br />
for a part in Lebanon's reconstruction with the assistance that an official Australian<br />
presence in Beirut can provide.<br />
