    <content><![CDATA[<p>I welcome the announcement today of the election of His Excellency U Htin Kyaw as President of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. I congratulate the people of Myanmar on this historic step in its ongoing political transition.</p>
<p>I also wish to acknowledge the role of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her long struggle for a democratic Myanmar. Her ongoing unifying role in Myanmar’s political and economic development will be vital.</p>
<p>I recognise too the leadership of outgoing president, His Excellency U Thein Sein, in Myanmar’s remarkable reform process since 2011 and in facilitating a peaceful transfer of responsibility to the National League for Democracy.</p>
<p>Australia will continue to work with Myanmar to support its ongoing development and reform for the benefit of all the people of Myanmar.</p>
