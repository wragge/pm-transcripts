PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 16 February 1985<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, and the Premier of South<br />
Australia, Mr John Bannon, today announced joint funding of<br />
a $ 2.8 million Riverboat Museum and educational display<br />
centre at Goolwa, adjacent to the mouth of the Murray River.<br />
Mr Hawke and Mr Bannon said this important historical<br />
project was part of the $ 5 million Commonwealth contribution<br />
to fund Bicentennial commemorative projects in South<br />
Australia which are intended to provide lasting testimonies<br />
to the Bicentenary in 1988.<br />
Mr Hawke said that the Commonwealth Government has allocated<br />
nearly $ 200 million for the Bicentennial activities which<br />
will include the development of many projects at a local level.<br />
" This is the first of a number of exciting projects in<br />
South Australia which will enhance and enrich the lives of<br />
ordinary Australians for generations to come", Mr Hawke said.<br />
The project consists of the River Murray Interpretive Centre<br />
and a River Boat Museum at Goolwa, the last town on the<br />
Murray River before it meets the Southern Ocean. It was<br />
partly as a result of Captain Charles Sturt's dream of using<br />
this access to the Southern Ocean as an outlet for the trade<br />
of inland Australia that South Australia was founded.<br />
The River Murray Interpretive Centre will be located on a<br />
site overlooking the river and will interpret the river system,<br />
the largest in Australia, covering the themes of exploration,<br />
transport, irrigation, domestic water supply, environmental<br />
issues and the history and culture of the coastal Aborigines<br />
who lived around the Coorong, the river and lakes of the<br />
Murray Mouth.<br />
The River Boat Museum will consist of both a fixed display and<br />
a working paddle steamer to recreate the era of the River Boats.<br />
The complex, apart from catering for the tourist, will also<br />
provide an education facility for students who, with the aid<br />
of a permanently employed education officer, will be provided with<br />
an exciting and instructional program on the history and issues<br />
relating to the River.<br />
