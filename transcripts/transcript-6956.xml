EMBARGOED UNTIL 10.00 PM JjAUSTALIA<br />
SPRIME MENISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 32 JUNE 1986<br />
The Report of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group was<br />
released in London today ( 12 June).<br />
The Group performed its task with great determination and<br />
integrity. I wish to express my personal appreciation of the<br />
role of the Australian member and Co-Chairman of the Group,<br />
Mr Malcolm Fraser, in this process. He and his colleagues<br />
tackled a difficult task with energy, sensitivity and skill.<br />
The Report is a powerful and compelling . ccount pf the daily<br />
agony brought about by the apartheid system in South Africa,<br />
of the conscientious and dedicated attempts of the seven<br />
members of the Group to carry out the Commonwealth's mandate<br />
from Nassau, and of the obduracy and intransigence of the<br />
South African regime.<br />
Tragically, the Group was given no option but to conclude<br />
that this obduracy and intransigence have wrecked the<br />
Commonwealth initiative and that Pretoria's attitude offers<br />
no present prospect of a process of dialogue leading to the<br />
establishment of a non-racial and representative Government<br />
in South Africa.<br />
At the very moment the Group's Report is being released, the<br />
monstrous roll-call of violence and destruction in South<br />
Africa continues to mount. The latest manifestation is the<br />
violence of vigilantes, who, with the connivance of the South<br />
African security forces, are mounting brutal attacks on black<br />
communities around Cape Town.<br />
On top of this, there are tonight ominous reports of a<br />
crackdown on dissent in advance of the commemoration of the<br />
Anniversary of the deaths at Soweto on 16 June.<br />
In this deteriorating situation, Commonwealth leaders will be<br />
meeting in London from 3-5 Atugust to consider what further<br />
measures we can adopt to bring the South African Government<br />
to its senses.<br />
Before this meeting, Cabinet will again be considering Australia's<br />
relations with South Africa with the aim of considering concrete<br />
steps that we can take. " Unless there is dramatic change in<br />
the two months remaining before Heads of GoVxelrrIent meet, I<br />
shall be taking to London the view that strong further measure::,<br />
on a Commonwealth-wide basis, should be applied.<br />
NIMWA </p>
<p>I e<br />
2.<br />
My conviction that this is the path which we must take is<br />
strengthened by the unanimous conclusion of the seven members<br />
of the EPG, drawn from across the breadth of the<br />
Commonwealth, that concerted action of an effective kind may<br />
offer the last opportunity to avert an appalling catastrophe<br />
in South Africa. 0 </p>
