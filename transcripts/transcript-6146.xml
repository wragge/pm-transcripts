PREMIERS' CONFERENCE AND LOAN COUNCIL MEETING<br />
JUNE 1 JULY 1983<br />
The heads of government of the Commonwealth of Australia<br />
and of the six states today reached agreement on important<br />
fiscal policy aspects of the Commonwealth Government's<br />
national economic recovery programme.<br />
After two days of discussions in the Premiers' Conference<br />
and the Loan Council, the heads of government agreed that<br />
the Commonwealth Government has designed its macro-economic<br />
policies to promote national economic recovery. In<br />
particular, they agreed that significant fiscal stimulus<br />
to promote recovery, while avoiding excessive strain<br />
on financial markets, would be provided within a budget<br />
deficit of $ 8.5 billion. They agreed that any deficit<br />
significantly above this figure would bring into question<br />
the durability of recovery through its possible effects<br />
in raising interest rates.<br />
The heads of government agreed upon revenue-sharing arrangements<br />
that represent the current . distribution of financial<br />
resources under the control and influence of the Premiers'<br />
Conference and Loan Council. The parties noted the severe<br />
budgetary environment for all governments, both Commonwealth<br />
and State. Within this environment, the substantial increase<br />
in the real value of transfers from the Commonwealth to the<br />
States would require reductions in other Commonwealth<br />
outlays or increases in Commonwealth revenues, or some<br />
combination of the two. The States argued, and the 2/ </p>
<p>2.:<br />
Commonwealth accepted, that difficult measures along these lines were<br />
justified by the severity of the States' budgetary problems. The States<br />
agreed that in these circumstances the Connnwealth had gone as far as it<br />
reasonably could in meeting their claims, but stressed that increases in<br />
State taxes and charges could be necessary as their responsibility.<br />
The States accepted that payment of a special revenue assistance grant of<br />
$ 155.5 million in 1983-84, in recognition of the unusual severity of<br />
the States' own budgetary difficulties in 1983-84, would be a once-for-all<br />
transfer. All agreed that this additional $ 155.5 million would be<br />
distributed among the States as in Table I attached and that it would<br />
not be counted in the base for determining tax sharing grants in 1984-85<br />
or beyond.<br />
The heads of government agreed on the revised proposals for Medicare as<br />
outlined by the Minister for Health in Premiers' Conference, including<br />
the basis for compensation payments to each of the States as outlined<br />
by the Minister, on the need for review of compensation arrangements<br />
before the end of 1984-85, and on guarantees on compensation payments<br />
until the end of financial year 1986-87. There will be further<br />
consultations with Queensland on the appropriateness of the<br />
compensation offered to that State.<br />
The heads of government further agreed on Loan Council<br />
borrowing programs for 1983-84 on the basis set out in<br />
the final Commonwealth offer attached. </p>
<p>The heads of government also agreed on a Working Group<br />
of Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory Treasury<br />
officers to examine without commitment longer-term issues<br />
of the distribution of taxation powers between the<br />
Commonwealth and State governments and advise by end<br />
October 1983 on terms of reference for a review by<br />
February 1985 of the distribution of the tax sharing<br />
and identified health grants.<br />
The heads of government welcomed the spirit of co-operation<br />
in which the Premiers' Conference and Loan Council had been held. </p>

Committed special addition for salvaging bushf ire affected timber ( SA).<br />
One half of States' bids for new expenditure on previously approved infrastructure projects.<br />
An increase of 15.1 per cent.<br />
Victoria has a slightly lower growth rate than NSW due to completion of Wurdee Boluc and World Trade Centre infrastructure<br />
projects, and the fact that Victoria had a $ 20 million temporary special addition in each of 1981/ 82 and 1982/ 83 as part'of a<br />
$ 110 million package of grants and loans.<br />
Small net growth rate is explained by Queensland's large infrastructure allocation in 1982/ 83 ($ 60m cf $ 17m in 1983/ 84) and the<br />
fact that 1982/ 83 allocations included a temporary special addition for the Burdekin million).<br />
Growth rate affected by the once only temporary special addition of $ 22 million ( see footnote<br />
Ci) Negative growth rate due to completion of Kwinana-Koolyanobbing rail project million in temporary special additions in<br />
1982-83) and the completion of two minor non-electricity infrastructure projects.<br />
