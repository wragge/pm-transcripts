    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that President Clinton and I have agreed</p>
<p> to a joint approach in the development of electronic commerce. By</p>
<p> agreeing to cooperate more closely in the field of electronic commerce,</p>
<p> Australia and the US have recognised, at the highest level, the importance</p>
<p> of the internet and electronic commerce to our nations' future</p>
<p> economic and social development.</p>
<p>The growing information economy is a truly global phenomenon, which</p>
<p> has the potential to improve the lives of all citizens, whether they</p>
<p> live in our cities, or rural and regional Australia. Harnessed effectively,</p>
<p> the information economy will continue to provide more and more opportunities</p>
<p> to businesses large and small, and employment growth.</p>
<p>Co-operation will take place in a range of areas designed to accelerate</p>
<p> the growth of the information economy and electronic commerce, to</p>
<p> promote better standards of livings for all in our emerging networked</p>
<p> economies.</p>
<p>The statement finalised today builds on the close cooperation between</p>
<p> the US and Australia on a range of internet and e-commerce related</p>
<p> issues, such as domain names and opposition to "bit taxes".</p>
<p> The statement demonstrates both countries' commitment to putting</p>
<p> in place a safe and secure environment so that e-commerce can flourish.</p>
<p>The statement is aimed at:</p>
<p> providing certainty and building confidence for government,</p>
<p> business and consumers in key areas of e-commerce;</p>
<p>   * facilitating progress in key areas, particularly a transparent</p>
<p> and consistent legal and regulatory framework; and</p>
<p>   * promoting a dialogue between Australia and the US on e-commerce</p>
<p> issues which will benefit government, business and consumers.</p>
<p>Australia and the United States have reached agreement on key policy</p>
<p> principles of private sector leadership, minimal government intervention</p>
<p> and self-regulation wherever possible.</p>
<p>Agreement has also been reached on the underpinning principles behind</p>
<p> a range of specific policy issues including taxation in relation to</p>
<p> the internet and electronic commerce; custom duties on electronic</p>
<p> transmissions; enforcement of electronic transactions and electronic</p>
<p> authentication methods; privacy with regard to processing of personal</p>
<p> data and consumer protection in the online environment; online content</p>
<p> and government services and information.</p>
<p>Whilst bilateral cooperation is important in ensuring the sharing</p>
<p> of information and building confidence, multilateral fora will also</p>
<p> have a key role to play. Governments will need to work together with</p>
<p> the private sector in developing a global framework for electronic</p>
<p> commerce. Australia and the United States have been actively cooperating</p>
<p> in APEC, the OECD and the World Trade Organisation to this end.</p>
<p>A copy of the joint statement is attached.</p>
<p> 1 December 1998</p>
<p> Australia and the United States believe that the growth of the</p>
<p> information economy is a significant and positive development for</p>
<p> both countries and, generally, for society and global business. The</p>
<p> benefits of e-commerce, in particular, include access to new markets,</p>
<p> quality of service, encouragement of innovation, more efficient management</p>
<p> of supply and distribution and better customer service. These benefits</p>
<p> should accelerate economic growth in all sectors, and across all regions</p>
<p> and communities.</p>
<p>I. PURPOSE OF STATEMENT</p>
<p>This joint statement is being made in order to accelerate the development</p>
<p> of e-commerce in both countries and empowerment of individual citizens</p>
<p> by:</p>
<p>   * providing certainty and building confidence for government,</p>
<p> business and consumers in key areas of e-commerce;</p>
<p>   * facilitating progress in key areas, particularly a transparent</p>
<p> and consistent legal framework;</p>
<p>   * promoting a dialogue between Australia and the US on e-commerce</p>
<p> issues which will benefit government, business and consumers.</p>
<p>II. POLICY PRINCIPLES</p>
<p> * The growth of electronic commerce will be led by the private</p>
<p> sector, and its continued development depends on leadership by</p>
<p> the private sector in key areas both domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>   * Competitive market-based solutions to specific issues for the</p>
<p> information economy will promote optimal growth and benefits.</p>
<p> Governments should avoid imposing unnecessary regulations. When</p>
<p> regulation is necessary, they should rely on a "light touch"</p>
<p> regulatory environment.</p>
<p>   * Where the market alone will not solve problems, self-regulation</p>
<p> gives maximum control and responsibility to the individual and</p>
<p> should be the preferred approach. In some cases this may need</p>
<p> to be facilitated by legislation to ensure effective arrangements.</p>
<p>   * In light of the global nature of e-commerce, government-based</p>
<p> or industry-based approaches should be coordinated and harmonised</p>
<p> domestically and internationally, as far as possible.</p>
<p>   * Government should actively pursue excellence in the online delivery</p>
<p> of government services and in its dealings with business.</p>
<p>III. POLICY ISSUES</p>
<p>Australia and the United States agree on the following approaches</p>
<p> to key areas of electronic commerce and the information economy:</p>
<p>1. Taxes and Tariffs</p>
<p>  A: Rules for the taxation of the Internet and electronic commerce</p>
<p>   should be neutral, efficient, simple to understand and should promote</p>
<p>   certainty. Governments will cooperate closely to ensure effective</p>
<p>   and fair administration of their tax systems in relation to electronic</p>
<p>   commerce, including prevention of tax evasion and avoidance. In</p>
<p>   support of this the Australian and US national tax authorities should</p>
<p>   continue to consult and cooperate on the taxation issues associated</p>
<p>   with electronic commerce in international fora, such as the OECD</p>
<p>   and other bodies, and at a bilateral level in accordance with the</p>
<p>   exchange of information provisions of the 1982 Australia-US Double</p>
<p>   Tax Convention.</p>
<p>  B: Australia and the US support the indefinite extension of the</p>
<p>   WTO declaration of May 1998 not to impose customs duties on electronic</p>
<p>   transmissions.</p>
<p>2. Developments in International Fora</p>
<p>  A: World Trade Organisation (WTO): The international trading</p>
<p>   system under the WTO should foster the growth of electronic commerce</p>
<p>   by reducing the scope for trade-distorting government intervention</p>
<p>   and to give enterprises greater access to the global marketplace.</p>
<p>   Australia and the United States are actively participating in the</p>
<p>   WTO work program on e-commerce, with the shared objective of undertaking</p>
<p>   a comprehensive review of the implications of e-commerce for the</p>
<p>   application of WTO agreements and for mandated negotiations, taking</p>
<p>   into account the application of the established body of trade rules</p>
<p>   to electronic commerce and the importance of further expanding market</p>
<p>   access and trade liberalization commitments within the WTO framework.</p>
<p>   The program should also consider the potential contribution of e-commerce</p>
<p>   to development objectives, and means to promote greater access for</p>
<p>   enterprises in developing countries to the global digital network.</p>
<p>   The General Council should continue to coordinate the work program,</p>
<p>   avoiding duplication with work done elsewhere, focussing on workable</p>
<p>   outcomes, and keeping open the possibility of adding new issues</p>
<p>   to the work program.</p>
<p>   B: Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC): Both governments</p>
<p>   welcome the ongoing e-commerce work program in a range of APEC sub-fora,</p>
<p>   including agreement to the key themes and future work program outlined</p>
<p>   in the APEC Blueprint for Action on Electronic Commerce.</p>
<p>3. Business and Consumer Confidence</p>
<p>It is essential that business and consumers have confidence in transactions</p>
<p> conducted electronically. This will be facilitated by action in the</p>
<p> following areas:</p>
<p>  A: Electronic Authentication: Governments should work towards</p>
<p>   a global framework that supports, domestically and internationally,</p>
<p>   the recognition and enforcement of electronic transactions and electronic</p>
<p>   authentication methods (including electronic signatures). At an</p>
<p>   international level this should include exploring the possibility</p>
<p>   of a convention or other arrangements to achieve a common legal</p>
<p>   approach that will support electronic transactions  as well</p>
<p>   as a variety of authentication technologies and implementation models.</p>
<p>  This approach should:</p>
<p>a. Remove paper-based obstacles to electronic transactions by</p>
<p> adopting relevant provisions from the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic</p>
<p> Commerce;</p>
<p>b. Permit parties to a transaction to determine the appropriate</p>
<p> authentication technologies and implementation models for their</p>
<p> transaction, with assurance that, to the maximum extent possible,</p>
<p> those technologies and implementation models will be recognised</p>
<p> and enforced;</p>
<p>c. Permit parties to a transaction to have the opportunity to</p>
<p> prove in court that their authentication technique and their transaction</p>
<p> is valid;</p>
<p>d. Take a non-discriminatory approach to electronic signatures</p>
<p> and authentication methods from other countries.</p>
<p>  B. Privacy: Ensuring the effective protection of privacy</p>
<p>   with regard to the processing of personal data on global information</p>
<p>   networks is necessary as is the need to continue the free flow of</p>
<p>   information. With regard to frameworks for personal data protection,</p>
<p>   governments and businesses should consider consumers' concern</p>
<p>   about their personal information. Governments should support industry</p>
<p>   in implementing effective privacy protection. Personal information</p>
<p>   should be collected and handled in a fair and reasonable manner</p>
<p>   consistent with generally accepted privacy principles. The OECD</p>
<p>   Privacy Guidelines provide an appropriate basis for policy development.</p>
<p>  C. Critical Infrastructures: Protection of information, as</p>
<p>   well as the information systems and infrastructures themselves,</p>
<p>   is a key element in building user confidence. In some cases information</p>
<p>   infrastructures are critical to public safety and national economic</p>
<p>   well-being. The preferred approach to information security is through</p>
<p>   industry awareness and industry based solutions. The OECD Guidelines</p>
<p>   for the Security of Information Systems should be the basis for</p>
<p>   national approaches to information security. Governments should</p>
<p>   provide leadership and provide advice on threats, vulnerabilities</p>
<p>   and security responses to ensure that critical information infrastructures</p>
<p>   are protected.</p>
<p>  D. Consumer Protection: Consumers should receive effective</p>
<p>   protection in the online environment which can be promoted through</p>
<p>   enforcement of existing consumer protection laws, modification of</p>
<p>   these laws as necessary to accommodate the unique characteristics</p>
<p>   of the online market, consumer education, and industry supported</p>
<p>   mechanisms to empower consumers, and resolve consumer complaints</p>
<p>   and concerns.</p>
<p>4. Content</p>
<p>  A. The internet is a medium for promoting, in a positive way, diffusion</p>
<p>   of knowledge, cultural diversity and social interaction, as well</p>
<p>   as a means of facilitating commerce. Governments should not prevent</p>
<p>   their citizens from accessing information simply because it is published</p>
<p>   online in another country.</p>
<p>  B. Empowerment of users, including parents in relation to material</p>
<p>   which may be unsuitable for children, should be achieved through</p>
<p>   information and education, as well as through the availability of</p>
<p>   filtering/blocking systems or other tools. Industry self-regulation</p>
<p>   will assist in the promotion of content labelling.</p>
<p>  C. Industry will need to deal appropriately with complaints about</p>
<p>   prohibited content. We encourage international cooperation between</p>
<p>   law enforcement authorities to prevent, investigate and prosecute</p>
<p>   illegal activities on the internet and the illegal use of e-commerce</p>
<p>   by criminal and terrorist organisations.</p>
<p>5. Government Services and Information</p>
<p>  A. Good administration is promoted by governments ensuring that</p>
<p>   they pursue excellence in delivery of government services and information</p>
<p>   online in a citizen-friendly way rather than reflecting bureaucratic</p>
<p>   structures. Governments can also contribute to the development of</p>
<p>   the information economy by acting as role models and market catalysts.</p>
<p>   Business and user confidence will be enhanced by effective government</p>
<p>   use of electronic payments systems.</p>
<p>  B. Government led developments in public key and other authentication</p>
<p>   technologies should be encouraged to facilitate trade through the</p>
<p>   use of secure electronic exchange of permits and licences.</p>
<p>  C. Both countries recognise the value of, and will continue to support,</p>
<p>   international cooperation in electronic delivery of government services</p>
<p>   through bodies such as the International Council for Information</p>
<p>   Technology in Government Administration, and through collaborative</p>
<p>   work such as the G7 Government Online Project.</p>
<p>  D. Governments consider the remediation of the Year 2000 computer</p>
<p>   date problem as a matter of critical importance to both countries</p>
<p>   and international communities. The exchange of appropriate information</p>
<p>   and expertise would provide significant assistance in addressing</p>
<p>   this issue.</p>
<p>6. Domain Name System (DNS)</p>
<p>Both countries agree on the following guiding principles:</p>
<p>  A. Stability: The US Government should end its role in the</p>
<p>   internet name and numbering system in a manner that ensures the</p>
<p>   stability of the internet. The introduction of a new management</p>
<p>   system should not disrupt current operations or create competing</p>
<p>   root systems. During the transition and thereafter, the stability</p>
<p>   of the internet should be the first priority of any DNS management</p>
<p>   system. Security and reliability of the DNS are important aspects</p>
<p>   of stability, and as a new DNS management system is introduced,</p>
<p>   a comprehensive security strategy should be developed with input</p>
<p>   from the private sector.</p>
<p>  B. Competition: The internet succeeds in great measure because</p>
<p>   it is a decentralised system that encourages innovation and maximises</p>
<p>   individual freedom. Where possible, market mechanisms that support</p>
<p>   competition and consumer choice should drive the management of the</p>
<p>   internet because they will lower costs, promote innovation, encourage</p>
<p>   diversity, and enhance user choice and satisfaction.</p>
<p>  C. Coordination: Certain management functions require coordination.</p>
<p>   In these cases, responsible industry self-regulation is preferable</p>
<p>   to government control and is likely to be more flexible and responsive</p>
<p>   to the changing needs of the internet and of internet users. The</p>
<p>   self-regulatory process should, as far as possible, reflect the</p>
<p>   bottom-up governance that has characterised development of the internet</p>
<p>   in this area to date.</p>
<p>  D. Representation: Private sector mechanisms should be developed</p>
<p>   to ensure that domain name system management is responsive to internet</p>
<p>   stakeholders worldwide.</p>
<p>7. Intellectual Property Rights</p>
<p>Adequate protection of intellectual property rights on a technology-neutral</p>
<p> basis is essential for the development of e-commerce. The new WIPO</p>
<p> Copyright Treaty and the Performances and Phonograms Treaty provide</p>
<p> a sound basis in this regard. Further consideration of implementation</p>
<p> of the measures in the treaties will be a positive step.</p>
<p>8. Infrastructure</p>
<p>The supporting infrastructure for online transactions must be technically</p>
<p> and commercially suitable, particularly in terms of adequate bandwidth</p>
<p> and competitive pricing. The optimal outcome will be achieved through</p>
<p> competitive provision of infrastructure and telecommunication services</p>
<p> within a pro-competitive regulatory framework.</p>
<p>IV. WORK PROGRAM</p>
<p>Recognising that bilateral cooperation can complement the development</p>
<p> of essential multilateral frameworks, Australia and the United States</p>
<p> will:</p>
<p>  A. Work with the private sector and consumer groups in both countries</p>
<p>   to promote dialogue and cooperation on the issues contained in this</p>
<p>   statement, and facilitate the translation of such dialogue and cooperation</p>
<p>   into meaningful international frameworks.</p>
<p>  B. Cooperate closely in relevant international fora to support the</p>
<p>   growth of and access to global e-commerce; these may include, for</p>
<p>   example, the WTO, WIPO, OECD, UNCITRAL, UNCTAD, and APEC.</p>
<p>  C. Actively promote exchange of information and views at government</p>
<p>   level on all relevant e-commerce issues. This could include economic</p>
<p>   and trade issues such as how e-commerce affects small and medium</p>
<p>   sized enterprises, including their ability to develop markets and</p>
<p>   generate employment; and the broader economic and social impacts</p>
<p>   of e-commerce.</p>
<p>  D. Work to ensure that the benefits of such exchanges are shared</p>
<p>   more broadly, particularly in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
