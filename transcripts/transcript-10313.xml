THE HON. DR CARMEN LAWRENCE<br />
Having been charged with perjury, the Hon. Dr Carmen Lawrence,<br />
Member for Fremantle, like any other Australian citizen is entitled to a<br />
presumption of innocence. She should have her day in court.<br />
Dr Lawrence is, of course, entitled to remain a Member of the House of<br />
Representatives unless or until she were to be disqualified by operation of<br />
section 44 of the Constitution. Longstanding precedent has been observed<br />
in her standing down from membership of the Shadow Cabinet whilst the<br />
charges against her are dealt with.<br />
The presumption of innocence is a key tenet of the criminal justice system<br />
in Australia.<br />
In the circumstances any further comment on the matters involved in the<br />
charges against Dr Lawrence would not be appropriate.<br />
