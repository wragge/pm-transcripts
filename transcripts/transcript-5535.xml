OF THE PPkT kUNISTER BY MH MINISTER FOR<br />

0 I am' glad to be here at the official opening of the " Myer:'<br />
Salutes Australia" fortnight<br />
I think that Australia ought to be saluted more often than<br />
it-i: s. Australia is the bezountry_' ijithe world to live<br />
in, and much the best for brin-Cjing up a family. We all know<br />
this, even the ' knockers' know it. It doe-s. us no harm to have<br />
a few ' k" ockers', But I sometimes think it might do us some<br />
good ilz we hadI a few more -7salufLers'l--P7opl Veparedto Say<br />
straigt out how good ihis country is.<br />
But althou.--h we don't alway-.--y t,--utt--n are--proud<br />
of: hir nation. We are proud to be called Australians.<br />
Arid there are many thing that we are entitled to be proud of.<br />
This fortnight when Australia is being saluted offers us a<br />
good excuse to beat our own drum more loudly than usual, and<br />
Iam pleased to m ke the most of the opportunity.<br />
There was a time vffien-many Australians tended to think an<br />
imported article would be superior to one rilade in Australia.<br />
Our igclation from Europe an, ri&amp; fr-ba-y aC. amour<br />
to their products. And our small local market made it difficult<br />
for local f irms to manufacture a wide range of high quality<br />
g oodls.<br />
But now the picture ig different. We now have behind us a<br />
wealth of. exp~ eri ence, and in tile primiary, ranuf acturi-ng and<br />
* service sections a well-earn-tid-r-putati. on-for wlality. Weic still<br />
have a comparatively small domestic market, but the initiative<br />
of Australians has led to some_ brilliant ideas and designs.<br />
Some of our manufactured goods have hd n~ in u~ s~ i<br />
managing to break into international markets, even if sometimes<br />
only in a.. small way. Who would have thought that Australian<br />
cultured pearls are exported to Japan? Who would have thought<br />
that we sell shirts in Hong Kong, or " hI668 ' 61cT s inw<br />
Singapore? Who would have thought that German equestrians<br />
would be passing up local saddles for Australian ones? But<br />
you will niot be surprised to-harthat--ei-exp-4---cricket---.-<br />

' I<br />
12 I. I, Ii It i I 2 I 2 4e, all know that on display in this store are Australian-m-ada<br />
roductes as good as any of their kind, in the world. Australian<br />
foods ar-e. outstanding by any standards. It-is a-pity that the<br />
governr~ nts of Europe are not welcomiung towards them. Mcany<br />
) f our manufactured goods can stand conarison anywhere.<br />
Elnd we are winning increasing recog-nition in overseas<br />
narketB because of this.<br />
kustralian wines have recently won important international<br />
3marcls and there is a growing recog4-n ove-x-seas. Athat<br />
top wines are amongst the best in the world.<br />
The Government has been anxious to foster greater public<br />
awareness of these developments, of ' the qualit. y of AUstaln<br />
products. It has sought and encouraged Australians to show<br />
support for their country in a practical way. And what better<br />
way is there to salute Australia tha~ tl-buY-MAtral-i.-Fr,--<br />
not only does this foster national pride but also it helps-<br />
Australiani industries and creates more jobs for Axvstraliai<br />
workers. Since August 1979, the Government har, funded the " Project<br />
Australia Campaign" through the Project Australia Committee<br />
a national comittee of people who are : Lead&amp; T9in-T;-tr<br />
individ-aal fields. When Project Australia began, there were<br />
Tnany setc. There were smart article s which said thecre<br />
was no -: ni it. But we stoodbytiea-Ad---wy<br />
it has taken hold, as pride in Auistraliwi achievement grows.*<br />
The objjectives of " Project Australi" Lare-beinguZSued throu( 3gh<br />
a variety of means including nation-wide adverti-sing, shop-front<br />
displays and prorimtional events, Project Australia awarda<br />
have -been given for inventions ranging from an int-ernzatiJonal.<br />
language of symbols for handi capped c19Mhi&amp; n t6d-le TV-Tai: T-<br />
. wine cask, and for contributions ranging from children's<br />
literature to solar energy technology.<br />
A promotion to salute Australia f its in very well with the overall<br />
thrust of our * campaign to ' project Australia. -It focusses again<br />
on the need to nake Australians, more dwsie of. What Our country<br />
bas to offer, and what we, in our turn, can do or our country,<br />
As employers and employees, as producers and consulners, we<br />
have common objectives. We do ourselves no good if vie forget<br />
that we are working for t%-he good of Aust ra~ ia and-o-f ,-r<br />
Australians and not just for our oern good.<br />
The Project Australia campaign is eempementd-by-other<br />
measures such as the work of the Industrial Design Council<br />
of Australia. This council ainis to create an awareness and<br />
an appreciation of good design so that PAstralian industry<br />
can. produce better and more internationally<br />
goods. The council offers a wide range of services to<br />
industry and bag initiated two important, and much coveted<br />
design awards . the Australian r,-an-ediF-te--P-rtnce<br />
Philip Prize. The Au-stralian Design Award ise what it suggeatn,<br />
a recognition and a promotion of well desigiied, high quali. ty.<br />

as innovative design becomes more widespread, and this will<br />

In February 1979, 1 launched the " Export Now" campaign,<br />

when coirmrc itself contributes to the same cause,<br />
Australians are obviously developing a much stronger awareaess<br />
of what this couintry and its people have to offer of the<br />
high quality and the real value of Autralian products.<br />
Prorn~ tions such as this can only further that cause. </p>
