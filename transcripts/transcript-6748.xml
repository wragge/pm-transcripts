TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH MIKE WILLESEE 2* 7 SEPT 1985<br />
WILLESEE: Is it satisfactory that a man who has been<br />
working for a relatively short time with a government<br />
authority gets sacked with a half a million dollar, mostly<br />
tax free, golden hand shake.<br />
PM: In the circums-t. ances it is not satisfactory Mike. And<br />
I think I have made it clear that it is not satisfactory.<br />
WILLESEE: What went wrong?<br />
PM: Well, let me give you the sequence of events as briefly<br />
as I can. I spoke with Mr Reid and said to him that on all<br />
the evidence available to me, it was best if Dr Armstrong's<br />
employment should be terminated. I have deliberately not gone<br />
into the details of that because, I think you know me over<br />
many years, I don't seek to impose hurt on people if I can<br />
possibly do it, and I haven't gone to details. I discussed<br />
it with Mr Reid. Hie came back to me on the 19th and said<br />
alright, that is what would happen because he had the<br />
authority. I could not instruct him under the law, but I<br />
made my point of view known. He said, very well, it will<br />
cost a fair bit of money because there will be 6 years of<br />
a contract to buy out and associated things like long service<br />
leave.-Now that was put to me that that what was required<br />
and that is what he would proceed to do. So that is the<br />
point about the amount. Then secondly, there is the question<br />
of tax. When Mr Reid gct in touch with me and said, at the<br />
end of August, well here is the amount. It was an amount<br />
which was of the order that was represented by what hie had<br />
said before. It was a somewhat different composition but<br />
because I didn't have any feeling at all that there would<br />
be any question of tax minimisation I didn't go to it.<br />
And when I did speak to Mr Reid on the 10th of Septem-, ber,<br />
I said to him then that I was puzzled by the difference<br />
in the composition, because the amounts that were broken<br />
up only had a small amount in regard to salary and long<br />
service leave and had this big hunk, $ 240,000, in another<br />
category. And I was puzzled by this change. And then<br />
there was reference made by him to tax advantage. And I<br />
to h~ 2anyt to ao Ia'i~ l<br />
tax minimisation or avoida. nce. I wa nt you to give mc<br />
in writing a detailed account of what is involved.<br />
And I wrote to him then on the 17th, spelling that out. </p>
<p>PM cont: Now I find, last night, when I see the contract for<br />
the first time, that it is not a question of 6 years or<br />
years, but termination by either side with 4 months notice.<br />
Now, I am simply saying, there are the facts. And it was<br />
not acceptable to me. I am not going to questions about<br />
Mr Reid's integrity. I am not going to that. I am simply<br />
saying it was not a satisfactory answer and inthose<br />
circumstances I had to ask more and I received/' tnd I<br />
thank Mr Reid for the way in which he did respond. Because<br />
I think it was the appropriate response.<br />
WILLESEE: What responsibility do you take personally for<br />
this matter in toto?<br />
PM: Well, I have explained my actions and I accept the<br />
responsibility and am proud of the fact that I have discharged<br />
the responsibility in a way which is appropriate at all times<br />
in terms of the information available to me. And when, at the<br />
first moment, there was any suggestion of improper course of<br />
action in regard to tax matters, I immediately within the<br />
second, went to it. And I have now referred the correspondence<br />
on the matters to the Solicitor-General to be advised as to<br />
whether in regard to what has happened there is anvthing which<br />
should be done in regard to this amount.<br />
T. ZLLESEE: Afe you now concerned that you may face a censure motion in the House?<br />
PM: I tell you what, nothing could please me more<br />
because on the basis of what Mr Howard has done today in<br />
his statements, if there is a censure motion it will be the<br />
Opposition by us, because he has deliberately misled the people.<br />
He is saying that in the papers that I tabled that we left out<br />
a page of the document. Mr Howard knows that I went to him<br />
in the House and I said this document is in here by mistake,<br />
the first page had been put in, it was put in by mistake. He<br />
knew that that was there by mistake because it contained a<br />
reference to a personal matter. He agreed to the deletion of<br />
the personal matter. The one paragraph that was on the second<br />
page that wasn't tabled, because this page had got in by<br />
mistake, the one matter that was covered in that had been<br />
totally covered by me in all that I had said in the Parliament<br />
and outside.<br />
WILLESEE: But in a press statement or press notes on<br />
SEptember 11, you said that Mr Reid and Dr Armstrong had<br />
concluded that the best interests of the ABA would be for<br />
Dr Armstrong to leave its service?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: Now was that really the truth?<br />
PM: It was a totally accurate statement and a statement, let<br />
me say, that was cleared with Mr Reid. My whole concern from<br />
the beginning of this matter Mike, was to ensure that what<br />
was done, that was necessary for the welfare of the Authnrity<br />
should be done. yXo t io to add to s-a,<br />
anything that would unneco2u:, zily cause hurt emb* arr. t.., s<br />
to Dr Armstrong. And that statement was cleared by Mr Reid. </p>
<p>WILLESEE: Why would Mr Reid agree with that when he made<br />
it clear in his discussion with you and in the notes<br />
of that discussion recorded by your staff that he wanted<br />
to keep Dr Armstrong?<br />
PM: You see, get the sequence right that I have put to you.<br />
I spoke to him on the 15th of August. And I put to him that<br />
for the reasons that I advanced, I believed it was in the<br />
best interests of everyone that there should be this termination.<br />
I could only put that view to him. I could not instruct him.<br />
Held listen to what I had to say and put points in defence of<br />
Dr Armstrong. And he said, well I will go away and think about<br />
it. And he then came back to me on the 19th. and said well I have<br />
thought about what you have said. We will go ahead and do it.<br />
But he insisted and rightly insisted because that was what<br />
the legal position was, that the negotiations now in regard<br />
to this matter was entirely for him and must be with him.<br />
And it is in that context that the statement was made and<br />
the statement is a statement of total accuracy.<br />
WILLESEE: So he changed his mind from his discussion with<br />
you until a day or two later?<br />
PM: You can ask whether he changed his mind. It may still<br />
be that he would think rather not to if he had his way. But<br />
he had listened to the Prime Minister who had no legal<br />
authority to dismiss Dr Armstrong. I had no authority<br />
because under the legislation passed by our predecessors<br />
the Authority was put away from the government and the<br />
Parliament. So I had no rights. All I had was a responsibility<br />
in terms of the public interest, to out a view and I put it<br />
strongly to Mr REid. Now he went away and thought about that<br />
and talked with Dr Armstrong and reported back to me on the<br />
19th and said alright this is going to be done, but Mr<br />
Prime Minister it is my responsibility and I will proceed<br />
to the negotiations.<br />
WILLESEE: You are clearly not happy with the amount paid<br />
to Dr Armstrong let alone the manner in which it was paid.<br />
But it seems that you were first made aware of that when<br />
Laurie Oakes revealed it on television on September<br />
PM: Well, that is no-one's understanding, Mike. The position<br />
is this. That when I spoke on the 19th of August to Mr Reid,<br />
and he said alright I am going ahead with this. He said it<br />
will be a large amount of money because there is 6 years of<br />
the contract to buy out. And at the salary of Dr Armstrong<br />
plus the long service leave entitlements etc, that is associateA.<br />
with it, that is the sort of ball-park figure, because there<br />
is 6 years of the contract to be bought out. And so he said,<br />
I am going away and negotiating on that basis because that<br />
is what is required. So off he went. When the letter came<br />
to me at the end of August, the amount was in that ball-park<br />
that he talked about and I noticed that there was a different<br />
or in the a~ olunts. He ~ hve fiqrmcr<br />
question of tax siiniply did. n't ari-L,, in rciy: thc.. tt<br />
would be any suggestion of minimisation of tax. It was only<br />
then when I spoke to Mr Reid on the 10th, I said to him,<br />
look I am puzzled by this change in the composition of this<br />
amount and it was in response to that observation of mine </p>
<p>PM cant: about my puzzlement as to the amount that he<br />
referred to tax advantage for Dr Armstrong. I said, wait<br />
a minute and I immediately said this Government is not going<br />
to be any part of any contrivance to minimise tax or avoid<br />
tax. I want you to get in touch with me and set out the<br />
facts of this matter. And I then followed that up with a<br />
letter on the 17th of August saying exactly that. Now it<br />
wasn't until last night that I got the written response from<br />
Mr Reid and attached to it, the letter which dealt with the<br />
terms of the contract which was certainly not in the terms<br />
that had been talked about on the 19th.<br />
WILLESEE: But bairk on August 19, you got a letter from<br />
Mr Reid which detailed those relevant parts of the settlement<br />
and one was a restraint of trade.<br />
PM: There was nothing in that letter which indicated any<br />
change from the structural basis, that is 6 years of salary.<br />
If you want to..<br />
WILLESEE: But it said restraint of trade?<br />
PM: But, if in addition to the things that he mentioned to<br />
me, he was saying there were certain things that had to be<br />
taken into account, well that was for him to undertake in<br />
the negotiation. But what I am saying is that the amount,<br />
the order of the amount that he talked about was in terms<br />
of 6 years of salary, in the event the amount that he came<br />
up with was virtually the same as would have been arrived at<br />
by the six years time salary, but differently composed. And<br />
the difference in te composition which I went to when he<br />
referred to tax advantage was simply that if it had been<br />
done in the way that was put to me of six years salary there<br />
would have been tax attached to it. When it was made up<br />
in the way it was, this 240,000 didn't attract tax at all.<br />
WILLESEE: But the fact is that on August 19 you had from<br />
Mr Reid a letter which, among other things, said that he<br />
wouldn't be allowed to work in competition etc, etc, a<br />
restraint of trade. Now did you know that restraint of<br />
trade invokes a tax free allowance.<br />
PM: I don't know whether you are trying to avoid the point.<br />
What I am saying to you, I spoke to him on the same day.<br />
The letter was telexed up. I spoke to him. And it was in<br />
that conversation that he put to me that what would be involved<br />
was a large amount, he put the order of it, over 400,000,<br />
because it was 6 years times the salary. Now that was put<br />
to me on that day, the 19th of August, that you are talking<br />
about. And that established the ball-park of the figure.<br />
Six years of the salary at that amount, with the associated<br />
figures of long service leave. Now that was the explanation<br />
that was put to me on the phone. And to be totally fair to<br />
Mr Reid, he has never in any subsequent discussion including<br />
last night, challenged at all, he2 has agraeod that tht--Is h'<br />
was said. Now the amiount turnsun it is thC'e same<br />
waa talked about by that sort of method. But when I talked<br />
to him about it and said well look I am puzzled by the<br />
difference in composition. He said, oh well, tax advantage. </p>
<p>PM cant: And tax advantage, as it emerges, because if you<br />
explain it that way and describe it that way, the 240,000<br />
doesn't attract tax. And it is that which is unacceptable.<br />
WILLESEE: But that is the point of my question. That I<br />
accept what you are saying, but we don't expect the Prime<br />
Minister to analyse every line of every document, but<br />
did your advisers not pick up that restraint of trade factor.<br />
PM: Because there was no point, in terms of the conversation<br />
which I had with him on that day, Mike, which you don't<br />
seem to grasp..<br />
WILLESEE: But I have read the letter.<br />
PM: Sure. But the letter of the 19th had been written. He<br />
then spoke to me on the phone. And so this was the same day.<br />
And so in regard to that day's conversation, the position that<br />
you have is that the-p~ rime Minister was told there will be this<br />
amount of money of this sort of order because it is six times<br />
the annual salary, that gets up with the other associated<br />
long service leave and so on. Now, and there are other<br />
conditions and so on in regard to a contractual basis. And<br />
it was in that context WThere I said to him that I understood<br />
there was some contractual arrangement. I said if there are<br />
entitlements make sure that you err on the side of generosity.<br />
Because if there are entitlements, I believe that that was<br />
appropriate. Now what changed was not the proposition that<br />
you had to pay these things to achieve a position in regard<br />
to restraint of trade. Nothing of the sort. The amount of<br />
money was no different. What was different was that if it<br />
had been, as was put to me, six years times the salary, then<br />
there would have been tax attracted to it. When you rearranged<br />
it and described it in this way which couldn't relate to the<br />
fact any rate, then there was no tax. Now, as soon as that<br />
question of tax was raised on the 10th, I said wait a minute<br />
that is not on.<br />
WILLESEE: When were you first aware that the basic requirement<br />
to pay Dr Armstrong out was of four months notice?<br />
PM:. I got that letter last night for the first time.<br />
WILLESEE: But you were asked a question in the House on, I<br />
think, August the 19th?<br />
PM: On August the 19th?<br />
WILLESEE: SEptember 19, I amn sorry.<br />
PM: I was asked a question. What I am saying is that last<br />
night for the first time we got from Mr Reid the letter which<br />
was of-the, I think, the 12th of October 1979, in which the<br />
full reference had been set out. I don't know whether you<br />
want me to read it. t!-ere it ,. as for the first t~ l-e.<br />
An-l let r. c say to y~ ' muf~~ i~~<br />
a numbier of occasions thi -ae sc, 1, cnt datail . incd<br />
about these sorts of contracts but they had been told by<br />
the Authority that they were documents of a personal nature.<br />
It was not until last night that we had the document put before<br />
us which set out the contractual relationship between the<br />
Authority and Dr Armstrong. </p>
<p>WILLESEE: Do you recall-on SEptember 19 being asked about<br />
the four months provision?<br />
PM: No, I don't recall being asked about it. But what I<br />
am saying to you is this. That as far as the Department<br />
was concerned there had been an attempt to get all the<br />
details about the contractual relationship. They hadn't<br />
been provided because it was said they were of a personal<br />
nature. If you are faced with a situation where'you are told<br />
by the Chairman directly on the phone that the requirement<br />
is to pay out six years, then what reason did I have in fhose<br />
circumstances not to accept what I was told. That was on the<br />
19th of August.<br />
WILLESEE: Prime Minister, I suppose most people are concerned<br />
about the fact that here we have massive funds being spent<br />
to what will be a very important event in our history and<br />
we have all these problems and nobody knows what is going<br />
to happen. You have now replaced the Chief Executive and<br />
the Chairman. The Chairman has just had the support of the<br />
Board by a vote and you replaced him with a man from the<br />
Board who voted for him.<br />
PM: Well, when I rang Mr Utz last night he immediately<br />
accepted my request. He responded positively to my request<br />
to accept the chairmanship in this interim way. So I think<br />
that answers your question, doesn't it?<br />
WILLESEE: Well, does it? He had just voted his support for<br />
Mr Reid.<br />
PM: Well, what I am saying to you is that subsequently to<br />
that, and given the action I have taken, he immediately accepted<br />
my invitation to take the chairmanship. And that was subsequent<br />
to the vote to which you refer.<br />
WILLESEE: Last Thursday on this program you said you supported Mr Reid.<br />
PM: And I said on the program, and I said consistently<br />
to all the media, that I was not going to be making a judgement<br />
about Mr Reid. You will recall I have said consistently, it is<br />
substantiated time after time, and transcript after transcript,<br />
that it is not fair to Mr Reid to be making a judgement until<br />
I see him. I said I am waiting until I see him on Thursday.<br />
I waited until I saw him.<br />
WILLESEE: Last question Prime Minister. You have got this<br />
massive bicentennial authority with massive funds, none of<br />
us have any idea what is being achieved apart from those<br />
things which would have happened anyway like roadworks and<br />
bridges. PM: Now that is totally unfair to Mr Reid and Dr ARmstrong and<br />
everyone associated with the Authority. There are many things<br />
that are already known. Just for example, let me tell you<br />
that a couple of weeks ago in I'elbourne, I opened tho:<br />
Australian exhibition. NO, 0w this is a i ccornXCC-,<br />
funded in part by BHP, whom I have publicly thanked. This<br />
is just a magnificent concept. It is going to be a travelling<br />
exhibition, a number of pantechnicons which C2( C going to travel<br />
all round Australia and expose to Australians. in1I think, it is </p>
<p>PM cont: 50 to 60 locations right round the countrythe<br />
story of Australia's achievements, its vision, its future.<br />
I just use that as an example. There are many other things.<br />
There are 500 community organisations established around<br />
Australia in regard to the bicentenAry. I am just making<br />
a point MIke. It isn't fair to say that a substantial of<br />
important work hasn't already been done.<br />
WILLESEE: Prime Minister, are you satisfied that by the<br />
end of 1988 the Australian people will say well done, well<br />
spent. PM: Yes I am Mike. And I am glad you asked that question in<br />
the end. Because while there have been problems Ernd some<br />
legitimate criticisms that have to be dealt with, / Ind we<br />
are making the changes which are going to improve it. The<br />
basic work has been done. tlot all the basic work, but basic<br />
work has been done, upon which now with improved leadership,<br />
improved communication, and accountability that we have got<br />
to get by agreement. We can't get it under the law because<br />
the previous government brought in this legislation which<br />
set the Authority apart from the Parliament and the Government.<br />
And I believe that in discussions with Mr Utz and with the<br />
new Chief Executive when appointed we will be able to get a<br />
greater degree of accountability and reportability. Yes<br />
Mike I am certain that in 1988 we will have a great year.<br />
It will not simply be a year of celebration, but it will<br />
also be a year<br />
of the creation of permanent projects which will be a<br />
reminder to future generations of the importance of 1988.<br />
WILLESEE: Prime Minister, thanks for your time.<br />
PM: Thanks Mike.<br />
