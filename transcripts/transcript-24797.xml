    <content><![CDATA[<p>Mr Speaker, I do wish on indulgence to mark the passing of Bart Cummings just a few days ago.</p>
<p>Bart Cummings AM was one of Australia's greatest horse trainers, if not the greatest trainer in our horse racing history.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker, few people have dominated a sport the way Bart Cummings has.</p>
<p>He won his first major race way back in 1958 and went on to dominate horse racing for almost six decades.</p>
<p>He was the trainer every jockey wanted to ride for, every owner wanted to engage and every punter felt safe betting on.</p>
<p>Twelve Melbourne Cups, Mr Speaker, he had to his name, more than twice as many as any other rival.</p>
<p>He also holds the record number of wins in the Caulfield Cup, the Newmarket Handicap, the Australian Cup and the VRC Oaks, and, Mr Speaker, in 1989 and 1990, he achieved the unprecedented treble of topping the Trainers Premiership in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker, horse racing was in the Cummings familyâs blood and it is still in his family's blood.</p>
<p>Bart's father, Jim, taught him and Bart taught his son, Anthony, and Anthony and Bart taught grandson, James.</p>
<p>As Anthony once said of his father, <em>âDad showed me and told me everything I know, but he didn't show and tell me everything he knows.â</em></p>
<p>Mr Speaker, Bart was a man of few words but they were often very well chosen ones.</p>
<p>For instance, when the jockey Darren Beadman told Bart that God wanted Beadman to go to Bible college and leave jockeying behind, Bart said to him that he needed to, and I quote, âSeek a second opinion.â</p>
<p>Bart was appointed a member of the Order of Australia for service to the racing industry way back in 1982.</p>
<p>He was inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame and the Sports Australia Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>I, certainly, on behalf of the Government, extend sympathy to Valmae and to Bart's children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.</p>
<p>Race day will not be the same without him.</p>
