TEXT OF ADDRESS TO TIHE NATION BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE RT. H-tON J. D. NTHONY H P.<br />
As Christmas approaches, our thoughts are with family and<br />
friends. Regrettably, many will not be with us after the<br />
holidays. Death and injury caused through road crashes is the greatest<br />
epidemic of our time. The sad facts are that some 3,000<br />
Australians are killed, and 90,000 injured, on our roads each<br />
year. The tragic reality is that most Australians who die between<br />
the ages of five and 34 are killed on the roads.<br />
No matter how good we think we are as drivers, we cannot<br />
ignore these statistics. Impatience, aggression, speed, fatigue,<br />
unfamiliar vehicles or road conditions, not wearing seat belts<br />
and driving after having too much to drink are recognised<br />
killers. Governments in Australia are making every effort to improve<br />
road safety, and the nationwide Bicentennial program to improve<br />
our roads is an important part of this. But the success of<br />
government and community efforts will depend on each of us as<br />
road users. I cannot over-emphasise the need to take particular<br />
care over the next month. We all have to understand that it is<br />
up to each of us to act sensibly. We cannot assume that " it<br />
can't happen to us".<br />
I urge all Australians to think before getting behind the<br />
wheel. Driving sensibly will take a little more time, patience<br />
and care but it will pay dividends. Try to avoid hazardous<br />
situations, take a short break during long journeys and celebrate<br />
after you have reached your destination.<br />
The most dangerous thing is driving after having too much to<br />
drink. Because all governments in Australia are so concerned<br />
with the drink-driving problem, they have co-operated in an<br />
Australia-wide television campaign, featuring four award-winning<br />
commercials. The commercials have been shown previously, but<br />
their message can well. afford to be repeated regularly over the<br />
next few months.<br />
When you see these? co), mercials, please think about them.<br />
They could save lives.<br />
I wish you every happiness for the festive season and safe<br />
motoring, I hope ttha you will all be with us after the holidays<br />
but remember, it's up to you.<br />
Good evening. </p>
