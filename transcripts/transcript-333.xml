A TALK TO THE NATION<br />
Telecast and Broadcast by the Prime Minister, the<br />
Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies.. on 8th June, 1961<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
For once in my life, as you might say, I'm going to talk<br />
about politics not about party politics, but about the policies<br />
of the Nation, the policics that you have been rc ading about,<br />
hearing about and many of you, I've no doubt, have been<br />
criticising most heartily.<br />
Political policies of these large proportions have a<br />
great effect on your job, on your income, on your whole standard<br />
of life, and therefore you have a perfect right to be told<br />
occasionally by those whom you have elected to Governm-ent what it<br />
is they are doing; and how itts going on.<br />
Therefore in the first place I would just like to say to<br />
you, because I haven't very much time, I would just like to say<br />
something to you about the policy: what is the basic objective<br />
that we are after? After ten years, I think you will agree, of<br />
unexampled prosperityin 1960 we ran into a bom, a boom that was<br />
large and threatening. We all felt, no doubt, very happy about<br />
I it except those who were contemplating what would occur when it<br />
burst. And what we have been setting out to do in these last 12<br />
months is to quell that boom to bring it down to a normal state<br />
of prosperity and advancerien not an inflationary condition that<br />
hurts so many people, but a slable condition<br />
Now stability doesn't mecan that you are just going to<br />
get down to a dead level and stay there. Stability, by itself,<br />
is no good to Australia. Our population is going up; we have an<br />
enormous territory; year by year all sorts of new things are<br />
being discovered. This is really the most exciting country in the<br />
world. And people overseas, more and more, think so. Thcrefore<br />
when I say " stability" Itm talking about stability as the<br />
foundation for a tremendous growth and expansion. But we believe,<br />
p atnhda t wet het hiinnkf lraitgihotnl yi, s ntohta t ruunnlneisnsg aywoauy hwaivte h sytoaub ilsoi tyt haitn tthhee wsheonlsee<br />
value of money changes all the time, unless you have that, you<br />
will never attract the investment that you need, you will never<br />
have the confidence that you need for developing the country.<br />
Now that is what the policy has been in the broad. That<br />
policy, of course, has to vary in its application because<br />
circumstances change so frequently, particularly in the case of<br />
Australia. Here we are, an exporting country, with exports that<br />
are primarily the products of the land. If there is a drought,<br />
our income falls; if the price of wool goes down, our income<br />
falls. We are very very subject to fluctuations of this kind and<br />
therefore the Governm-ent has the immensely complicated task I<br />
think more complicated than most people realise of doing what<br />
it can in its own fashion to stabilise conditions.<br />
Now we have applied this policy in various ways. I<br />
won't go into them tonight because you are familiar with them.<br />
But perhaps I should say something to you about, first of all,<br />
why I believe that it is essential to get rid of the boom because<br />
and here are my reasons as quickly as possible in a boom<br />
costs rise, prices rise. This is all right for people who can<br />
stand it; it's no good to people on fixed inco. es; it's no good<br />
to people on social sorvices; it's no good to the savings that<br />
you have in so many hundreds of millions in the Savings Banks, and<br />
otherwise invested. And, above all, it's no good to our export </p>
<p>industries, because when the cost of their production goes up they<br />
can't pass it on to somebody else. Their price is what the world<br />
will give them; just as it is in the case of wool.<br />
Because of that, it is essential from our point of view<br />
that we should keep the inflatio) nary processes under control. It<br />
would be a terrible thing for Australia and a very bad thing for<br />
our future if some day we found that wool itself had been priced<br />
out of the world's market; or that the taxpayers in a~ ustralia had<br />
to subsidise the production of wo. ol. This would be a deplorable<br />
state of affairs. Well we have applied these anti-inflationary measures,<br />
and, I think, with some result.<br />
First of all our overseas funds were running down. Now<br />
those overseas funds sound a little mysterious, but in reality<br />
they are substantially what has been paid for our exports<br />
overseas, less what has been paid out for the imports that cone<br />
into Australia. You always have to preserve some sort of'<br />
substantial balance overseas. Some people think you ought to have<br />
the cost of six months' imaports; some may put it a little lower.<br />
But at any rate you can't afford to have your overseas funds<br />
running down so fast that overseas people lose their confidence;<br />
or you are not able to pay for your imports. So that it is very<br />
important that the overseas funds should be maintained, themselves,<br />
in a stable position.<br />
Well, at the beginning of November when the last<br />
measures were announced we were quite apprehensive about what was<br />
happening to the balance of funds.<br />
But as a result of the various measures, as a result of'<br />
the effectiveness of the credit restrictions as the greatest antiinflationary<br />
measure, our reserves have not been running down to<br />
the extent that we feared, and will, in fact, end the financial<br />
year in a healthy state. So that that particular danger has, I<br />
think I can say quite cinfidently, been averted.<br />
In the second place we th:) ught that the most effective<br />
fairest way of reducing an excess of imports, particularly of<br />
consumer goods, was credit restriction in Australia. And that has<br />
proved to be right because in the month of May that vie have just<br />
concluded there has been quite a notable " turn down" in the<br />
volume of imports into Australia.<br />
Now you may say, " Well all this business in Aiustralia<br />
has created great trouble; there's a little unemployment;<br />
there's some less of confidence" and I'll say something about<br />
that in a moment " Isn't this a great price to pay for<br />
controlling your overseas funds, and controlling the inflation?"<br />
Well it isn't a great price to pay. Do you know this: are<br />
here or I'm here and you're there I'm available to be<br />
criticised, I don't mind it, I'ri usod to it, we have a lot of<br />
critics from time to time in Alustralia. But the people outside<br />
Australia who are shrewd, hard-bitten investors, who are looking<br />
for a country in which they see oppirtunities for expansion and<br />
development, these people, so far frema being frightened off by<br />
our policies, have come in more and more. Do you know that in<br />
1959/ 60, the previous financial year, the investment of overseas<br />
capital in Australian business -I dintt nean borrowed by<br />
Governnients but actually in hiustralian factories, businesses<br />
was an all-time record? It ran into hundreds of millions. This<br />
year, in spite of the events, in spite of the criticisms there<br />
is such approval of policies of stability and development in<br />
Australia, that the investmient of funds is larger than it was last<br />
year, </p>
<p>3.<br />
Quite frankly I didn't expect that. I thought that with<br />
the inevitable arount of dislocatioDn that must occur when you are<br />
dealing with a boom because you have otto hit something if you<br />
arc going to deal with a boom I thought " Well, this may nako<br />
people a little wary outside". On the contrary! Obvi:) usly our<br />
credit in the rest of the world has never stood higher.<br />
Now the only other thing that I want to say to you in<br />
the time that I have is this. Don't let people persuade you,<br />
don't let anybody persuade you that you are living in danger of a<br />
depression. If the boon had been allowed to on it could easily<br />
have produced a burst. Our grandfathers could have told us about<br />
that in the nineties, in the great land boon and bank smash. The<br />
right way to deal with these matters is to avoid the excess of the<br />
boom, press it down to get it back on to an even keel. Aind if we<br />
do that, as we are doing, then of course we are not g; oing to have<br />
a depression. We won't have a depression unless the people of<br />
Australia lose faith in themselves. Now I don't. mind you losing<br />
faith in me you've been very k'ind to me; you've had some faith<br />
in tie for a long time. But whatever you do don't lose faith in<br />
yourselves. Every material element in Aiustralia marks us for<br />
another 10 years of the most remarkable national 1growth. These<br />
troubles are passing troubles. I'm not denying that there has<br />
been some lack of confidence. We're conscious of that. That,<br />
indeed, has been one of the real reasons why some productive<br />
industries in the manufacturing side in Australia have had orders<br />
falling off. Not because people are unable to buy, but because<br />
there is a little hesitation: " I wonder what is going to happen:<br />
I wonder how long this is ,-oing on".<br />
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I tell you I understand that<br />
feeling. I don't think it is well-founded. I beg, of you, go<br />
about your affairs in a normal fashion, do your spending in a<br />
normal way, because these policies are temaporary policies. Its we<br />
recover from the inflationary pressures, sowill all these policies<br />
be diminished. They are not put on forever; they are not put on<br />
for fun. They are put on for a purpose, and as the purpose is<br />
achieved so they become no longer necessary.<br />
Now I am a complete optimist about our future. I under.-<br />
take to say that by this time next year many thousands of people<br />
in Australia will wonder what they were worried about, because I<br />
believe that the maladjustmients, the little bits of difficulty<br />
that occur here and here, the amiount of unemployment that exists,<br />
and which nobody likes, these are temporary things. The permanent<br />
thing in Australia is that we have a remarkable country, a rich<br />
country it's going to be increasin'gly rich as we work at it.<br />
But the g reat elements that we need are a good foundatian<br />
to build on that's stability, that's cutting out booms a clear<br />
vision of growth and expansion in the future, and in the individu.<br />
heart a decent confidence in your own country. Aill I can say is<br />
I have an unlimited confidence in an unlimited future for our<br />
country. Goodnight ladies and gentlemen. </p>
