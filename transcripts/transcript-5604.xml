FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 14 JUNE 1981<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The first Parliamentary session for this year ended last<br />
Friday. We began the sitting with a great deal to do and<br />
mwe have achieved all our objectives. It has been one of the most<br />
siginificant and constructive legislative sessions for many<br />
years. 118 Bills were passed during the twelve sitting weeks and<br />
these Bills demonstrate in'the plainest terms the Government's<br />
direction and its determination to act in the interests of<br />
all Australians. Our legislative programme re-affirms our<br />
vision of growth and development for Australia, a vision of<br />
opportunity, security, prosperity stability and concern for<br />
those in need. This legislative programme also underlines<br />
unmistakably our commitment to strong and effective, yet<br />
limited, Government.<br />
The historic and visionary review of Commonwealth functions<br />
set the overall pattern of the session's legislation based<br />
upon Liberal principles. That review led to some 350 decisions<br />
which were aimed at elimihating duplication between Commonwealth<br />
and state governments, passing to private enterprise activities4<br />
which it can handle better than Government, and rationalisingA<br />
the functions which properly belong to the Commonwealth.<br />
Limited Government does not signify mean or ungenerous government.<br />
What it does is establish the conditions under-which there<br />
can be increased opportunities for all and better care for those<br />
in need. It must not be forgotton that while the review will<br />
lead to some expenditure cuts, it does not lead to any reduction<br />
in income security arrangements.<br />
The Government's new health policy again expresses our philosophy.<br />
It provides incentives to insurance and encourages people to<br />
look after themselves. But at the same time our health policy<br />
looks after those * in need, afid indeed it provides for free<br />
health care for about 3 million people. And, it eliminates<br />
the situation where the health costs of the well-to-do<br />
were entirely borne by taxpayers and means that one bureaucracy,,<br />
rather than two, will be involved in running each state's<br />
public hospitals. / 2 </p>

A further major achievement in this session has been the new<br />
financial arrangement between the Commonwealth and the states.<br />
The Commonwealth has legislated to provide a more stable basis<br />
for'. thegrants which the states receive from the Commonwealth.<br />
Since 1975, the Commonwealth Government has been fundamentally<br />
concerned to curb its own expenditure, for the Government<br />
believes that taxpayers cannot be regqiired to pay more and<br />
nore every year. It is the Government's view that all levels<br />
of Government must share in the task of easing the tax ' burden.<br />
And while talking of taxes there is for the coming year a<br />
tpaoxc kectust, whaincdh twhiel lr eblaetaev e on$ 50h0e amlitlhl iionns umroarnec e ini s teaxxppaeycetresd' ' to<br />
reduce the Commonwealth's revenue by a further $ 500 million<br />
in the following year. In recent years a considerable number<br />
of gross and anti-social tax-avoidance schemes have come into<br />
-existence, and in this session the Government was able to bring<br />
forward a comprehensive new anti-tax avoidances provision<br />
designed to eliminate these schemes.<br />
On top of these measures, this session has seen legislation<br />
for the new Human Rights Commission, and for freedom of<br />
information. Both these pieces of legislation are important<br />
Liberal initiatives, and the freedom of information legislation<br />
in particular makes an important start in an area in which<br />
Governments have talked for a long time and done nothing.<br />
It was this Liberal Government which acted, where other<br />
governments had only talked.<br />
In addition there were new airline arrangements which<br />
established an independent airfares committee, and which will<br />
convert TAA into a public company and increase competition<br />
in the airline industry.,<br />
It is true that there were pressures during the session, that<br />
is inevitable when such a volume of legislation is presented<br />
for debate and passage through Parliament. But it has been<br />
possible to achieve a most satisfactory result. It has been<br />
an exceptionally productive session, which will have<br />
far-reaching effects of tremendous benefit to all Australians. </p>
