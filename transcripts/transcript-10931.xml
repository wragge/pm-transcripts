    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..........................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Katie. I suppose, some corners are a bit longer</p>
<p> than others as far as election dates are concerned. To Ian Armstrong,</p>
<p> the Leader of the New South Wales National Party, my Federal colleague,</p>
<p> Judi Moylan, the Minister for the Status of Women, other distinguished</p>
<p> guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Today is an opportunity for me to put into context some of the decisions</p>
<p> that my Government has taken over the two and a quarter years that</p>
<p> we have been in power. And it's very important whenever you look</p>
<p> back on what a Government has done to remember as well as what it</p>
<p> has done, what things might have been like if some of the things it</p>
<p> had done over that period of time had not been done. And that is particularly</p>
<p> important against the backdrop of what is now occurring in the Asia</p>
<p> Pacific region. It's not possible to say anything about Australia,</p>
<p> about Australia's economic future or Australia's political</p>
<p> future without a few words about the very momentous events in Indonesia</p>
<p> over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>The resignation yesterday of President Soeharto was in every sense</p>
<p> of the word a moment in the history of that country and also a moment</p>
<p> in the history of our entire region. Whatever has been said about</p>
<p> him - and a lot has been said critically, and what will be said in</p>
<p> the future - nothing can gainsay the fact that that brought great</p>
<p> stability and a lot of well measured economic progress to the people</p>
<p> of Indonesia. It is no mean feat to be the governor for 32 years of</p>
<p> a country of over 200 million people, the fourth largest nation on</p>
<p> earth, comprised of an archipelago of more than 3000 islands with</p>
<p> an enormous amount of religious and ethnic diversity. He did bring</p>
<p> to that country a great deal of measured improvements for the poor.</p>
<p> Certainly the democratic processes that we take for granted were not</p>
<p> there but equally, it's very important in our relations with</p>
<p> the countries of the world to understand that our philosophical approach,</p>
<p> as much as we revere it, can be very different from the approaches</p>
<p> of other countries.</p>
<p>We quite sensibly, in my view, gave up the cheap option of giving</p>
<p> kerbside public political advice to the people of Indonesia about</p>
<p> who should be their government and we won't be departing from</p>
<p> that practice in the future. There must be more openness, there must</p>
<p> be more personal liberty and there must be a continued growth of economic</p>
<p> freedom in Indonesia if bloodshed and civil strife is to be avoided</p>
<p> in the future. We regard Indonesia as a very important country to</p>
<p> Australia, not so much because of trade, because our bilateral trade</p>
<p> is only about 2.5 per cent, but geographic proximity, historical experiences,</p>
<p> the fact that Australia was one of only three countries in the world</p>
<p> that contributed to the IMF bailouts of Thailand, Indonesia and Korea</p>
<p> is a demonstration that Australia is part and parcel of the Asia Pacific</p>
<p> region forever, and also in relation to Indonesia that Australia is</p>
<p> a reliable and durable friend in times of difficulty.</p>
<p>When I became Prime Minister I said that one of the things I wanted</p>
<p> to do with Australia's foreign relations was to move away from</p>
<p> what I saw on occasions as being a rather obsessive Asia-only approach,</p>
<p> which was adopted on occasions by the former Government, to a broader</p>
<p> and more sensible Asia-first approach, recognising that Australia</p>
<p> also had very important economic, historical and political relationships</p>
<p> with the nations of Europe and the nations of North America because</p>
<p> it's long been my strong personal conviction that Australia occupies</p>
<p> a rather unique intersection of history, geography, culture and economic</p>
<p> circumstance. We have deep cultural roots with the nations of Europe.</p>
<p> We share the common commitment to personal liberty and democracy with</p>
<p> the nations of North America yet geographically, we are part of the</p>
<p> Asia Pacific region and we have been able, to our great benefit to</p>
<p> welcome into our nation many tens of thousands of people from the</p>
<p> nations of the Asia Pacific region and they have added a very rich</p>
<p> and important cultural dimension to the modern Australia and I think</p>
<p> it's very important in the projection of our foreign relations</p>
<p> that we remember that unique intersection that we occupy and I think</p>
<p> we have understood that every well in the events of the past few weeks.</p>
<p>We will work with the Government of Indonesia appointed by the people</p>
<p> of Indonesia and that applies irrespective of the identity of the</p>
<p> people who are members of that Government. So it's really against</p>
<p> a background of what is happening in the Asia Pacific region, not</p>
<p> only in Indonesia but throughout the entire region that you must really</p>
<p> see what my Government has done over the past two and a quarter years.</p>
<p> If there is one very clear message that comes out of that turbulence</p>
<p> and that is that Australia needs a government that will give it economic</p>
<p> security, economic stability and economic safety. We don't want</p>
<p> a government, we don't want a set of policies that will play</p>
<p> fast and loose with Australia's economic stability.</p>
<p>Now what has happened in the Asia Pacific region has really dramatically</p>
<p> strengthened the case for on-going economic reform in Australia. So</p>
<p> far from what is happening in those countries taking the pressure</p>
<p> off us to change and reform, what has happened in those countries</p>
<p> has really increased the tempo and the nature of that pressure. And</p>
<p> that is why we adopted the approach that we did when we came to power</p>
<p> in relation to a number of areas. And I frequently ask the rhetorical</p>
<p> question, where would Australia now be if we had not taken the measures</p>
<p> we did more than two years ago to reduce the budget deficit? Where</p>
<p> would Australia now be if we had brought down two weeks ago a budget</p>
<p> with a deficit of $5 - 10 billion? Where would Australia have been</p>
<p> if we had not undertaken the measures to reduce the very, very large</p>
<p> Federal Government debt that we faced in March of 1996. And all of</p>
<p> the adverse developments in our region have totally vindicated the</p>
<p> economic approach the Government has adopted, sometimes in the face</p>
<p> of fierce criticism and always in the face of political obstruction</p>
<p> from the Senate the measures that the Government has taken over the</p>
<p> past two and a quarter years. Because if we had taken a looser, more</p>
<p> permissive approach to economic management, if we had said: we will</p>
<p> let the budget deficit correct itself in a cyclical fashion, if we</p>
<p> had not undertaken some unpopular spending reductions which affected</p>
<p> different sections of the community, if we had adopted that looser,</p>
<p> more permissive attitude, you really have to scratch your head and</p>
<p> wonder what the rest of the world would now be thinking of the Australian</p>
<p> economy against the background of what has happened in the Asia Pacific</p>
<p> region. Because in the global economy of the late 1990s you can suffer</p>
<p> the penalties of geography, irrespective of the virtue of your own</p>
<p> domestic economic policies. What has happened in our part of the world</p>
<p> has made it all the more necessary that the sort of reform measures</p>
<p> that we have undertaken be undertaken.</p>
<p>What we have done by reducing the budget deficit and what we have</p>
<p> done by tackling the debt problem is to create in many respects in</p>
<p> Australia, which is seen as a safe, reliable, secure economic haven</p>
<p> in a very, very turbulent part of the world.</p>
<p>I don't want to weary you with statistics but let me just give</p>
<p> you one. In 1995, the total federal Government debt of Australia represented</p>
<p> about 20 per cent of our GDP, that is 20 per cent of our annual wealth</p>
<p> generation. On current projections, and factoring in the acquisition</p>
<p> of the remaining two thirds of Telstra by the men and women of Australia,</p>
<p> that figure by the year 2001 will be reduced to a bare 1.5 per cent</p>
<p> of our annual wealth generation, or 1.5 percent of our gross domestic</p>
<p> product. And we often talk as we look forward to the next millennium,</p>
<p> and we look forward to the 21st Century, we often talk about futures</p>
<p> and visions and legacies. I would hope that one of the great legacies</p>
<p> of my Government for the children, particularly of the next millennium,</p>
<p> will be a debt-free millennium and I can't think of a surer economic</p>
<p> foundation for the 21st Century than for the people of Australia to</p>
<p> believe that they can go into that century on the basis of this nation</p>
<p> being a relatively free-of-debt nation.</p>
<p>That's not a mere academic exercise because when you reduce debt</p>
<p> and when you get rid of deficits, you create more favourable circumstances</p>
<p> in a lot of areas. I had the opportunity the other night of attending</p>
<p> one of those great sporting functions that comes the way of a Prime</p>
<p> Minister. I am very proud of the fact that I am the patron of the</p>
<p> greatest rugby league club in the world, that's the St George</p>
<p> Rugby League Club, and I went out there for the testimonial dinner.</p>
<p> I didn't get many arguments when I said that last Tuesday night</p>
<p> saying I went out there for the testimonial dinner for Mark Coyne,</p>
<p> the Captain of St George. And during the course of the evening is</p>
<p> the great opportunity at gatherings like that to get some free advice,</p>
<p> and you always do. And one thing you can be certain of if you go to</p>
<p> a sporting event in Australia that you'll always get plenty of</p>
<p> free advice. It's always free, it's not always friendly,</p>
<p> but it's always free.</p>
<p>And in the course of the evening, quite a number of people spoke to</p>
<p> me about something that really is the direct consequence of what I've</p>
<p> been talking about and that is the sharply lower interest rates that</p>
<p> Australian homebuyers and Australian business are now enjoying. Now</p>
<p> I know that there are a lot of you in the audience today who would</p>
<p> say that they're still not low enough and I know that none of</p>
<p> you would want me to ever say to any banker I run into that interest</p>
<p> rates in Australia are low enough. But I think it is indisputable</p>
<p> that over the last couple of years we have seen the most significant</p>
<p> falls in the interest rate structure of this country that I can certainly</p>
<p> remember. And they're worth, when you are talking about buying</p>
<p> the average home, certainly in Sydney, and on a national average they</p>
<p> are worth a gain of about $300 a month for somebody paying off a home.</p>
<p>And what is good is that the competition in the banking industry,</p>
<p> the greater competition, has now resulted in those reductions flowing</p>
<p> through into the small business area and they have been particularly</p>
<p> sticky and particularly resistant to reductions over recent years.</p>
<p> Now that would not have happened if it hadn't been for our Budgets</p>
<p> in 1996, 1997 and 1998. Because when you reduce government debt, you</p>
<p> get the governments out of competition for monies in the financial</p>
<p> markets and you create the circumstances, or you help create the circumstances,</p>
<p> for lower interest rates all around. So again and again you have to</p>
<p> see what we have done against the background of making this a more</p>
<p> secure, stable and safe economy.</p>
<p>You must see reform to the Australian waterfront, which we are absolutely</p>
<p> determined to see through to the end because we believe it is in the</p>
<p> national interest. We are not on some kind of ideological binge in</p>
<p> trying to reform the Australian waterfront. We have no desire to destroy</p>
<p> unionism. We have no desire to destroy individual unions. It's</p>
<p> a cornerstone of our approach that every Australian should have the</p>
<p> right to join or not to join a trade union. It should be a matter</p>
<p> of personal, individual choice. And our goal on the waterfront has</p>
<p> not been to destroy the Maritime Union of Australia. Our goal on the</p>
<p> waterfront has been to give to the Australian nation, to the economy</p>
<p> of Australia, the sort of efficient, economic waterfront that exists</p>
<p> amongst our competitor nations. And many of you have heard over recent</p>
<p> weeks and months the comparisons about the performance of the Australian</p>
<p> waterfront and waterfronts around the world.</p>
<p>And that has been our goal, and the reason why we are committed to</p>
<p> it is that it's part of the exercise of making Australia a more</p>
<p> stable, secure and safe economy.</p>
<p>And it's made all the more necessary, not less necessary, by</p>
<p> what has been happening and the turbulence that's been occurring</p>
<p> in the Asia Pacific region. And it's really against that background</p>
<p> that we come to what I have described in the past as the greatest</p>
<p> piece of unfinished economic business in Australia and that is taxation</p>
<p> reform. I've now been in Federal Parliament for 24 years and</p>
<p> over that period of time I have seen major reform in many areas affecting</p>
<p> the Australian economy. I've seen the opening up of the Australian</p>
<p> economy through a very extensive dismantling of tariff barriers. I</p>
<p> have seen the dramatic transformation to greater openness of the Australian</p>
<p> financial system. I have seen tremendous changes in many other areas.</p>
<p> I have seen the extensive privatisation programme embraced on occasions</p>
<p> by both sides of politics but pursued very persistently by the Coalition</p>
<p> since the mid 1980s. I've seen, particularly under my Government,</p>
<p> and I am very proud of the achievements in this area, a change in</p>
<p> our approach to industrial relations, an overturning of the rather</p>
<p> cloistered, inward looking industrial relations system that we inherited</p>
<p> in 1996 to a more open system. And reforming the waterfront is an</p>
<p> individual projection of that industrial relations reform.</p>
<p>But there does remain one very big piece of unfinished economic business</p>
<p> and that is to reform Australia's taxation system. And this shouldn't</p>
<p> be seen as some kind of economic revolution. It shouldn't be</p>
<p> seen as something that involves turning conventional economic practice</p>
<p> on its head. What it should be seen as is the next logical, inevitable,</p>
<p> absolutely necessary step in the process of making Australia a more</p>
<p> secure, stable and reliable economy.</p>
<p>We can no longer afford an old fashioned inefficient taxation system.</p>
<p> And what is happening around us drives that point home all the more.</p>
<p> I mean it's going to be a harder world in which to compete so</p>
<p> therefore you should arm yourself with a modern, competitive taxation</p>
<p> system. It's got nothing to do with ideology. It's got an</p>
<p> enormous amount to do with competitive survival and it's also</p>
<p> got a great deal to do with fairness.</p>
<p>I've always believed that you can sell major reform to the Australian</p>
<p> people if you satisfy two criteria. First of all, you have to persuade</p>
<p> them that it's in Australia's interests because Australians,</p>
<p> despite their reluctance sometimes to be too overt about it, are deep</p>
<p> nationalists and deeply concerned about the welfare and the future</p>
<p> of their country. And if you can persuade them that it's a good</p>
<p> thing for Australia that we have a new taxation system, that's</p>
<p> half the battle. The other half of the battle is to persuade them</p>
<p> that the change is going to be fair to all Australians.</p>
<p>If I could deal with the first part of those criteria and that is</p>
<p> the national interest criteria and the case on national interest grounds</p>
<p> for a new modern taxation system is overwhelming. There's hardly</p>
<p> a credible commentator on taxation left who would argue seriously</p>
<p> against the need for reform. The wholesale tax system of Australia,</p>
<p> which is the principle vehicle through which indirect taxation is</p>
<p> raised in Australia, the wholesale tax system is outdated, outmoded,</p>
<p> and in every sense of the world, unfair and old fashioned. It is a</p>
<p> system which severely penalises Australian exporters. It is a system</p>
<p> which is lopsided in its treatment of different industry sectors.</p>
<p> It is a system of indirect taxation that has parallels in only a handful</p>
<p> of countries around the world and we wouldn't normally like to</p>
<p> compare ourselves economically with those nations. It was a system</p>
<p> that was introduced at a time when services bulked very small in the</p>
<p> Australian economy, and it was introduced at a time when the dynamics</p>
<p> of a global economy in which we now live were literally light years</p>
<p> away. And on every score it has to go and it has to be replaced, and</p>
<p> many other indirect taxes along with it, by new and a better, and</p>
<p> a different system.</p>
<p>If we really want to do well as exporters in the Asia-Pacific region</p>
<p> if we really want to nail down the gains that we have made over the</p>
<p> last few years, if we really want to permanently waterproof ourselves</p>
<p> against the turbulence of that region, we have to undertake taxation</p>
<p> reform. We've got to give ourselves a system that gives a competitive</p>
<p> edge with that part of the world. We can't, to use the example</p>
<p> that I frequently used, have a taxation system that is so lopsided</p>
<p> and indiscriminate, it taxes the family car at 22%, but taxes a Lear</p>
<p> jet at zero. Or taxes orange juice concentrate at 20% and taxes caviar</p>
<p> at zero.</p>
<p>And one could spend the whole afternoon giving examples of that sort</p>
<p> of lopsided treatment and of the disparate way in which different</p>
<p> industry sectors are treated. So the case for that reform on national</p>
<p> interest grounds is overwhelming and there comes a time in the political</p>
<p> and economic life of any country, and in the political life of individuals</p>
<p> on the political stage, where you really have to ask yourself, what</p>
<p> is the point of being in public life on either side of politics unless</p>
<p> you are prepared to embrace some kind of national interest concern.</p>
<p>I mean we have debated this taxation issue for years and years in</p>
<p> this country. I can remember it being debated when I was the Treasurer</p>
<p> in the Fraser Government. I can remember that when Mr Keating was</p>
<p> the Treasurer in the Labor Government he advocated reform and as the</p>
<p> Opposition spokesman on economic matters then, I supported him. And</p>
<p> I think Mr Beazley and Mr Evans also supported him very strongly.</p>
<p> I can remember it came back again in 1993 when John Hewson led the</p>
<p> Coalition. And it is now back on the agenda and back on the table.</p>
<p>In many respects, this is our last, best opportunity for half generation</p>
<p> to do something sensible about our taxation system and if we lose</p>
<p> that opportunity I think we're selling ourselves short. If we</p>
<p> lose the opportunity I think we're doing a lot of damage to Australia's</p>
<p> economic future and we aren't providing that big extra element</p>
<p> that is going to deliver the stability and the security and the safety</p>
<p> that we all know is necessary and we have all been reminded is necessary</p>
<p> as a result of the turbulence which has occurred in our part of the</p>
<p> world.</p>
<p>It is often said, fairly or unfairly I never quite know, that Australia</p>
<p> is the lucky country. And we are lucky that we have been able to survive</p>
<p> some of the worst effects of what's occurred in our region. But</p>
<p> it's also said that you've got to make your own luck and</p>
<p> the fact that we have been able to survive some of that impact is</p>
<p> a direct result of many of the measures the Government has taken.</p>
<p> But we can't rest on what we so far achieved. We've got</p>
<p> to embrace the next necessary element of reform. And the next necessary</p>
<p> element of economic reform is, of course, reforming Australia's</p>
<p> taxation system and that is why we remain very, very strongly committed</p>
<p> to it. And there are a host of reasons, of course, you are all aware</p>
<p> of, other reasons why we need a new and better taxation system.</p>
<p>It is quite ludicrous that 30 to 40 years ago you didn't pay</p>
<p> the top marginal rate of tax unless you earned something like 16 to</p>
<p> 17 times average weekly earnings. There aren't all that many</p>
<p> people in Australia in that situation and there weren't then.</p>
<p> Now you pay the top marginal rate if you hit one-and-three-quarter</p>
<p> times average weekly earnings. And in the early years of the next</p>
<p> century, if we don't make any change, that is going to be an</p>
<p> even lower proportion.</p>
<p>Now that is a plainly ludicrous personal taxation system. And it does</p>
<p> need change. I don't pretend that you can wave a magic wand and</p>
<p> get rid of all the problems of the taxation system by reform. But</p>
<p> I do believe that if you identify a national economic need to change</p>
<p> something and you make a compelling case, than I believe that it will</p>
<p> be embraced by the Australian community.</p>
<p>And it can be done in a way that is fair to low income earners. And</p>
<p> I want to repeat an undertaking I gave a couple of weeks ago, and</p>
<p> that is that there is no way that we are going to change the taxation</p>
<p> system to hurt the poor in Australia. I do believe that Governments</p>
<p> and the rest of the community have social obligations to those in</p>
<p> the community who are less fortunate than the rest of us. Those social</p>
<p> obligations have to be delivered in a targeted way, they have to be</p>
<p> delivered in a sympathetic way and they have to be delivered in a</p>
<p> efficient way, but they must, nonetheless, be delivered. And part</p>
<p> of that process is to have a taxation system and a taxation reform</p>
<p> that takes proper care of the less well-off in the community. And</p>
<p> it can be done. The idea that there's something immutably fair</p>
<p> about the present system which can't be delivered in some other</p>
<p> system is absolutely illogical. Of course you can have fairness in</p>
<p> any system if you build in safeguards and you build in protection</p>
<p> for the less well off and we certainly intend to do that.</p>
<p>So ladies and gentlemen, as you may have gathered, I remain rather</p>
<p> committed to the cause of taxation reform. Not once again because</p>
<p> it's some kind of ideological beacon not because I want to win</p>
<p> some kind of ideological argument, but because with all the sincerity</p>
<p> and conviction I can muster I believe it is important for the welfare</p>
<p> of my country, particularly against the background of the economic</p>
<p> and political turbulence of our region, that we do everything we possibly</p>
<p> can to make this a more secure, stable and safe society economically</p>
<p> as well as socially. And the only way you can do that is to tackle</p>
<p> obvious problems. Governments are elected to govern, they are elected</p>
<p> to lead, they are elected to deal with problems. And when I became</p>
<p> Prime Minister in March of 1996 I identified a number of problems</p>
<p> with the Australian economy. I identified a big budget problem. I</p>
<p> identified the need for changing our industrial relations system.</p>
<p> I identified the need for the Government to get out of those business</p>
<p> undertakings that are not properly the business of Government. And</p>
<p> I also identified the need to have a more balanced approach to environment</p>
<p> concerns and development. And I also identified the need in our foreign</p>
<p> relations to bring about more balance in relation to the various regional</p>
<p> interests that we had.</p>
<p>And one by one we have tackled those problems and they've been</p>
<p> tackled against the backdrop of what was then unexpected turbulence</p>
<p> in our part of the region - in our part of the world. And what that</p>
<p> unexpected turbulence has done is to reinforce the need, the urgency,</p>
<p> the necessity to undertake fundamental reform to make us a stronger,</p>
<p> safer community. And that's why we did what we did in relation</p>
<p> to the Budget. That's why we had to take some decisions that</p>
<p> some people, including some in the business community, I guess some</p>
<p> people in this gathering didn't like in the 1996 Budget. And</p>
<p> we have offended, in the process, different sections of Australian</p>
<p> society but those decisions were taken out of concern for the mainstream</p>
<p> Australian national interest. And that's why we fixed the Budget.</p>
<p> That's why we are trying to reform the waterfront. And lastly</p>
<p> and most importantly, it is why we are so committed to the cause of</p>
<p> changing the Australian taxation system.</p>
<p>Can I finally say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that I have greatly</p>
<p> appreciated, and my Government has greatly appreciated, the links</p>
<p> that it has developed with the business community of Australia. I</p>
<p> came into office with a very strong personal commitment to the cause</p>
<p> of small business. I've had that commitment all of my life. I</p>
<p> guess it's something to do with the fact that I grew up ve</p>
