    <content><![CDATA[<p>Subjects: The death of Sir Donald Bradman</p>
<p>E&amp;OE................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, can I ask you about Don Bradman.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. Firstly can I say on behalf of all of the Australian people that we sympathise with and send our love and condolences to the Bradman family. I spoke a few moments ago to Sir Donald's son, John, and I expressed those sentiments to him. His father was an extraordinary person. He had an enormous impact not only on the cricketing world, but the sporting world generally. More than that, he had a great impact on Australian life especially during the desperate years of the depression. His prowess on the cricket field lifted the hopes and the spirits of the people who at times felt they had little else. It's not possible at a time like this to find the words to adequately express the impact that he's had on this country. He dominated its sport. He became, in every sense of the word, a legendary figure in his own lifetime. And his death after a very long life, and a life that was touched with personal sadness on a number of occasions. A very full life. I can only express the gratitude of all Australians and I know cricket lovers and people all around world in thanking him for what he did for us, and thanking God for him.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You visited only two weeks ago.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How was he?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he was, I saw him last Friday week and I had the opportunity of taking over and giving to him the Australian Sports Medal. He was obviously very ill but he was comfortable. He was being very well cared for. He had 24-hour nursing help in his own home. His son and his grandson were there. He was being given the emotional support and love that we would all hope to get at a time like that in our own lives.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What's your happiest personal memory of Sir Don?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well in a cricketing sense seeing his last innings on the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1949. The one and only occasion I saw him was his last appearance. Also a wonderful afternoon that Janette and I spent with Don and Jessie at their home in Adelaide in 1997. Not long after I became Prime Minister I went to the Adelaide Test that was then being held on the Australia Day weekend and we spent a very pleasant time with them.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What did knowing the Don mean to you as a cricketer?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It meant everything. I mean he was the greatest. There will be nobody anywhere near him. And to have the privilege as I did over the years, one very memorable occasion to have lunch with him and a number of other people, and then to visit him at his home, it was an enormous privilege because he was a hero to me as a young child and remained a hero to me all of my life. I'm not alone, there are millions of people around the world. Bradman is the best known Australian name on the Indian Sub-Continent. The famous remark attributed to Nelson Mandela when he came out of captivity after 27 years when he saw I think it was Malcolm Fraser and he asked whether Don Bradman was still alive. It shows the reach and the impact of the man.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, have you discussed a State Funeral with the family?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There will be a State Memorial Service. I've discussed that with the family and it is the least a grateful nation can do. There will in accordance with his wishes there will be a private funeral and then there will be a State Memorial Service. And enquiries about the details of that should be made to the Australian Cricket Board, and the family has been in discussion already with the Cricket Board and the Bradman Foundation about those arrangements.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Personally what has been the impact on you of this news?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he was 92 years of age and he was not well and in that sense it was not unexpected. But he's been such a significant figure that it is very much a moment in the history of this country.</p>
