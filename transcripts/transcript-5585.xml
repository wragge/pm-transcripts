L ~ PRIME<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 11 MAY, 1981<br />
SIR JOHN WILTON<br />
I was saddened to learn of the death of Sir John Wilton.<br />
He was an outstanding Australian who served his country well<br />
in war, as a fighting soldier and in peace, as a military<br />
strategist, administrator and diplomat.<br />
Hie had a most distinguished career. After active service in<br />
the Second World War and in Korea, he occupied the highest<br />
military posts in Australia.<br />
I first came to know him personally in 1966" when he was Chief<br />
of the General Staff at the time that I was appointed Minister<br />
for the Army. Later he became Chairman of the Chiefs of<br />
Staff Committee. In these roles he contributed greately to<br />
our defence organisation, and to the well-being of Australia's;<br />
armed services.<br />
I had a great respect for his wide-ranging capabilities, and<br />
I greatly valued our personal relationship when he was one<br />
of my most senior advisers.<br />
I extend my sincere sympathy to hiE; widow and family.<br />
