    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Randolph, can I commence my address by congratulating</p>
<p>   you for your re-election as chairman of this organisation, and I</p>
<p>   would like to acknowledge the presence this morning of representatives</p>
<p>   of many organisations, most particularly jil Djekurra and Evelyn</p>
<p>   Scott as leaders of ATSIC and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation.</p>
<p>I am particularly pleased to be here this morning and have the</p>
<p>   opportunity so soon after the Government's re-election to discuss</p>
<p>   our approach to immigration and other policies which are very important</p>
<p>   to the members and supporters of the various organisations that</p>
<p>   are represented this morning.</p>
<p>The next three years does provide all of us with tremendous opportunities</p>
<p>   to celebrate and showcase the Australian achievement. Our achievement</p>
<p>   as a nation of immigrants will be central to our national celebrations</p>
<p>   during that time. 1999 will mark the 50th anniversary</p>
<p>   of Australian citizenship, and the year will provide the chance</p>
<p>   to reaffirm the value of Australian citizenship and its role as</p>
<p>   a unifying force in our culturally diverse Australian community.</p>
<p>   The Olympic Games in the year 2000 will be an opportunity to showcase</p>
<p>   our success as a harmonious and united nation with a commitment</p>
<p>   to shared values, excellence and respect for each individual. And</p>
<p>   of course most importantly, the centenary of federation in 2001</p>
<p>   will allow us to reflect on the Australian achievement and how far</p>
<p>   we have come as a nation and what our aspirations are for the new</p>
<p>   century.</p>
<p>Above all, in observing these things and celebrating these events,</p>
<p>   we must celebrate the values and principles that have made us such</p>
<p>   a cohesive nation. We are a society united in the belief that each</p>
<p>   of us should have the same opportunity to reach our full potential</p>
<p>   and share in what this great country has to offer. Our society is</p>
<p>   underpinned by those uniquely Australian concepts of a fair go and</p>
<p>   practical mateship - integral features of our community and national</p>
<p>   identity.</p>
<p>Ours is a resilient and optimistic community that has extended</p>
<p>   the gift of welcome to people from every corner of the world. Whether</p>
<p>   Australian by birth or by choice we join as one people strengthened</p>
<p>   by a diversity of experience and cultural background.</p>
<p>But above all of this we share a strong set of values:</p>
<p>We honour the importance of family life where the hopes of our</p>
<p>   children can be realised and where our elderly can be given the</p>
<p>   respect that they have earned and deserved.</p>
<p>We dedicate ourselves to the principles of free enterprise, to</p>
<p>   the fruits of working hard and taking risks. We revere our democratic</p>
<p>   national institutions and respond to calls for personal responsibility</p>
<p>   and the provision of practical help for the less fortunate. And</p>
<p>   we are ambitious for Australia to succeed into the next century</p>
<p>   and for all of us to share in that prosperity.</p>
<p>These enduring values hold important messages for all of us.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we are all Australians, and no Australian need</p>
<p>   feel foreign in their own land. No-one is better or worse than any</p>
<p>   other. There exists no qualification by birth or race, wealth or</p>
<p>   heritage, which limits a person's pride in this nation or the</p>
<p>   stake they hold within it.</p>
<p>We all belong to Australia and we all have an equal right to regard</p>
<p>   it as our home, with all the sanctuary that a home provides. There</p>
<p>   is no place within our community for those who would traffic, for</p>
<p>   whatever purpose, in division based on a person's religion, their</p>
<p>   place of birth, the colour of their skin or their ethnic makeup.</p>
<p>   There is no place in Australia for any semblance of racial or ethnic</p>
<p>   intolerance.</p>
<p>In October 1996 the Commonwealth Parliament passed a resolution</p>
<p>   that contained a simple, direct and unambiguous statement of certain</p>
<p>   values and principles including the commitment to maintaining a</p>
<p>   non discriminatory immigration policy and the denunciation of racial</p>
<p>   intolerance. </p>
<p>What I never want to see, and I know no person in this audience</p>
<p>   wants to see, is an Australia where people of a particular racial</p>
<p>   background feel unwelcome. That would be a denial of everything</p>
<p>   that our country stands for. We have welcomed people from all around</p>
<p>   the world and all deserve to be treated equally and with an equal</p>
<p>   share of decency and civility. That is one of our common bonds as</p>
<p>   Australians.</p>
<p>My answer to all of those who feel threatened by our immigration</p>
<p>   programme is that they need not feel that way. I don't call</p>
<p>   them racist. I genuinely believe, however, that there are some who</p>
<p>   seek to prey upon community fears to encourage a sense of hostility</p>
<p>   towards people of particular racial backgrounds.</p>
<p>This is something that we should all oppose very strongly and I</p>
<p>   believe we should be reassured by the message sent by the Australian</p>
<p>   mainstream at the election that we are in essence a great hearted</p>
<p>   people and small minded policies will never hold sway over us.</p>
<p>One of the great virtues of being Australian as we come to the</p>
<p>   close of the century is that we occupy a unique intersection of</p>
<p>   history, geography, culture and economic circumstance.</p>
<p>Australia is a projection of western civilisation in this part</p>
<p>   of the world. We have deep and enduring links with Britain and the</p>
<p>   other nations of Europe and we share much of their great legal,</p>
<p>   cultural and democratic political inheritance. </p>
<p>We have profound links with North America and we have shared many</p>
<p>   experiences with the United States in both war and peace. </p>
<p>We are geographically located in the Asian-Pacific region, and</p>
<p>   we have within the Australian community a vibrant community of people</p>
<p>   of Asian descent who add to the strength and the vitality and the</p>
<p>   tolerance and the great cross section of modern Australia. This</p>
<p>   unique intersection means that we can draw strength from our diversity</p>
<p>   and our understanding of the region. We have an opportunity to use</p>
<p>   these unique characteristics in an effective way to achieve what</p>
<p>   no other country can.</p>
<p>And having just come from a meeting of APEC in Kuala Lumpur, and</p>
<p>   that is an organisation that brings together leaders of all of the</p>
<p>   pacific nations, and therefore a great cross-section of that enormous</p>
<p>   community, it was a reminder to me of just what a special intersection</p>
<p>   of those circumstances of history, geography and culture and other</p>
<p>   things that Australia really occupies. And we do have insights and</p>
<p>   understandings because of that particular background and the diversity</p>
<p>   of that background that gives us an opportunity to project a view</p>
<p>   which is superior and more enlightened and more comprehending of</p>
<p>   what is needed in that part of the world than that possessed by</p>
<p>   any other country.</p>
<p>And it is because of that combined background, our European associations,</p>
<p>   our long association with the nations of North America, our location</p>
<p>   in the Asian-Pacific region and our understanding of the people</p>
<p>   to people contact that that location gives us all of those things</p>
<p>   combined in a very special way to give Australia a capacity to influence</p>
<p>   events that no other country can possibly possess. </p>
<p>Our diversity is a source of great national strength. Particularly</p>
<p>   since World War II, migration has made an enormous contribution</p>
<p>   to Australia's economy, Australia's society and Australia's</p>
<p>   culture.</p>
<p>There is not an example anywhere else in the world of the successful</p>
<p>   absorption of such a diverse group of new citizens. </p>
<p>Multiculturalism involves the principle of mutual obligation. Within</p>
<p>   the framework of an overriding commitment to Australia, it respects</p>
<p>   the right of each individual to celebrate his or her particular</p>
<p>   cultural identity in an atmosphere of tolerance, understanding and</p>
<p>   mutual self respect.</p>
<p>As a Liberal Party Prime Minister I am proud to be the recipient</p>
<p>   of the Liberal Party heritage of compassion and commonsense in relation</p>
<p>   to our immigration programme. </p>
<p>In the post World War II years, both sides of politics pursued</p>
<p>   policies which brought millions of migrants to Australia and greatly</p>
<p>   strengthened Australia. Liberals, in particular, are grateful that</p>
<p>   it was the Liberal Party of Australia that did away with the White</p>
<p>   Australian Policy.</p>
<p>It was under the Fraser Government that Australia realised its</p>
<p>   full humanitarian obligation by taking on a per capita basis, a</p>
<p>   larger number of refugees from war torn Indo-China than any other</p>
<p>   country in the world. </p>
<p>This tradition, which has given Australia a level of tolerance</p>
<p>   and harmony without parallel, lives on today in our own immigration</p>
<p>   programme which seeks to strike a proper balance between compassion</p>
<p>   and the national interest. When the Coalition came to power in 1996,</p>
<p>   we set about making changes to the programme to restore confidence</p>
<p>   in it. </p>
<p>Any sovereign country has the right to determine how it will dispense</p>
<p>   its compassion and determine the level, from time to time, of its</p>
<p>   migration programme. In our view, our predecessors failed to assert</p>
<p>   control over the programme in the national interest and overtly</p>
<p>   politicised aspects of immigration and multicultural policies.</p>
<p>That is why we have now fine tuned programme levels in accordance</p>
<p>   with Australia's economic situation. It is why we altered the skill</p>
<p>   composition and selection criteria to better reflect future development</p>
<p>   requirements. That is why we have not exempted this area from fiscal</p>
<p>   consolidation and why we have cracked down on illegal immigrants</p>
<p>   and overstayers.</p>
<p>During our second term we aim to build on our achievements to ensure</p>
<p>   that the immigration programme continues to be managed with integrity</p>
<p>   and compassion so that it enjoys the confidence of the entire Australian</p>
<p>   community.</p>
<p>We will continue to run the programme in the national interest.</p>
<p>   This means balancing economic and non-economic components of the</p>
<p>   programme and ensuring an appropriate dispersal of our migrant intake.</p>
<p>We will examine the recommendations of a Commonwealth/State working</p>
<p>   party which is due to report next year on options to increase the</p>
<p>   number of skilled migrants in regional areas.</p>
<p>It is important that the immigration programme be managed in an</p>
<p>   open and publicly accountable manner and that migrants are selected</p>
<p>   on an objective case by case assessment of applications against</p>
<p>   clear legal criteria.</p>
<p>To maintain community confidence in our programme we will curb</p>
<p>   the number of applicants who seek to abuse the review process by</p>
<p>   reintroducing legislation in the Senate to restrict access to judicial</p>
<p>   review in all but exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>We will also reintroduce legislation, which was delayed in the</p>
<p>   Senate, to streamline the two-tier review process of non-refugee</p>
<p>   visa decisions to a single review by the Migration Review Tribunal.</p>
<p>We will also continue to balance the humanitarian, family and economic</p>
<p>   components of our immigration programme. The skilled proportion</p>
<p>   of the migration programme increased from 32 per cent to 52 per</p>
<p>   cent in the last financial year. Skills in short supply in Australia</p>
<p>   will continue be the principal determinant of skilled migrant entry.</p>
<p>Employer nomination, where migrants are guaranteed employment,</p>
<p>   will be accorded a higher priority for skilled entry. Minimum thresholds</p>
<p>   will be established to remove anomalies in the current points test</p>
<p>   and we will introduce factors more relevant to gaining employment</p>
<p>   in Australia.</p>
<p>During the election campaign, I committed the Coalition, if re-elected,</p>
<p>   to consult community groups, academics and others on settlement</p>
<p>   and multicultural policies and to engage all sections of the community</p>
<p>   in the settlement process.</p>
<p>The goal of our settlement programme is to allow our newest arrivals</p>
<p>   to fully participate in our community. </p>
<p>Over the next term of office we will maintain the role of community</p>
<p>   organisations in providing settlement services, support for migrant</p>
<p>   resource centres, the community settlement services scheme and funding</p>
<p>   for the Adult Migrant English Programme. </p>
<p>We will tender out the AMEP Research Centre and ensure that the</p>
<p>   eligibility criteria for programmes are sufficiently liberal and</p>
<p>   flexible to achieve more lasting benefits for non English speaking</p>
<p>   migrants.</p>
<p>We will maintain funding to English language and literacy training</p>
<p>   and education.</p>
<p>We will also provide better access to the translating and interpreting</p>
<p>   service as well as put the operation of the service on a commercial</p>
<p>   basis.</p>
<p>Australia is one of the oldest democracies in the world and democratic</p>
<p>   principles are deeply etched in our national character. It is that</p>
<p>   very democratic tradition, so much part of the Australian way, which</p>
<p>   has allowed the cultural diversity produced by our immigration programme</p>
<p>   to flourish so successfully. </p>
<p>Last year the government established a new National Multicultural</p>
<p>   Advisory Council, chaired by Mr Neville Roach, to recommend policies</p>
<p>   and an implementation framework to ensure that cultural diversity</p>
<p>   remains a unifying influence. The Council's report is expected shortly.</p>
<p>As you are aware, after appropriate consultation and research we</p>
<p>   launched the first stage of the 'Living in Harmony' campaign to</p>
<p>   promote community harmony and the enormous benefits of cultural</p>
<p>   diversity within Australian society. </p>
<p>The first stage included a $2.5 million programme of grants and</p>
<p>   partnership projects with the Australian Cricket Board, the New</p>
<p>   South Wales Rural Fire Service and Woolworths. We are committed</p>
<p>   to maintaining this campaign through the allocation of an extra</p>
<p>   $5 million which will take the overall campaign to $10 million.</p>
<p>We are also planning for the celebration of 50 years of Australian</p>
<p>   citizenship in 1999. For this reason we established the Council</p>
<p>   for Australian Citizenship to promote debate on citizenship issues.</p>
<p>We will report to the Parliament on the findings and recommendations</p>
<p>   of the Citizenship Council and I look forward to next year's</p>
<p>   celebrations.</p>
<p>Let me at this opportunity, Mr Chairman, pay particular tribute</p>
<p>   to Philip Ruddock who has been the Minister for Immigration and</p>
<p>   Multicultural Affairs since the Coalition Government took office</p>
<p>   in March of 1996. I believe that Mr Ruddock has handled the portfolio</p>
<p>   with great skill and compassion. He has been very professional and</p>
<p>   evenhanded. Philip's qualities both as a Minister and as person</p>
<p>   who has unique insights and understandings of the area for which</p>
<p>   he has responsibility have been recognised in his promotion to Cabinet</p>
<p>   and his new role in assisting me in relation to reconciliation issues.</p>
<p>   I record with great thanks and admiration Philip Ruddock's</p>
<p>   contribution in these areas.</p>
<p>Mr Chairman, let me conclude by saying a couple of general things.</p>
<p>   I have every confidence as we head towards a new Australian century</p>
<p>   that we can become even stronger and more united. I take a profoundly</p>
<p>   optimistic and positive view about the character of Australian society.</p>
<p>   I believe that the things that unite us as Australians will always</p>
<p>   be more powerful and more enduring than those things that divide.</p>
<p>   Our nation has been immensely enriched through the successive waves</p>
<p>   of immigration over the years that have brought new people from</p>
<p>   every corner of the world. We have succeeded better than any other</p>
<p>   nation on earth in recognising that we are a community of many parts</p>
<p>   and many origins. We do have a level of tolerance and understanding</p>
<p>   that is the envy of most nations. We are essentially a united people,</p>
<p>   but we respect the different cultural heritage of those within our</p>
<p>   community and we recognise and support their right to celebrate</p>
<p>   their own particular culture and their own heritage in a completely</p>
<p>   tolerant and open fashion. </p>
<p>We are a nation like any, not without our blemishes. We have within</p>
<p>   our ranks those who are intolerant, and those who would seek to</p>
<p>   exploit differences based on race for their own particular purposes.</p>
<p>   As a community we face the challenge of achieving an effective and</p>
<p>   widely accepted reconciliation between the indigenous people of</p>
<p>   this country and the rest of the Australian community. And I particularly</p>
<p>   welcome the presence here today of Gatjil and Evelyn in that context.</p>
<p>But it is important that we approach these issues in a spirit of</p>
<p>   both optimism and hope. The Australian achievement, and I believe</p>
<p>   it is a glorious one, is quite special, it is unique. There is an</p>
<p>   Australian way, there is an Australian character and all have made</p>
<p>   a contribution to it. And whether you were born in this country</p>
<p>   or your parents and grandparents were born in this country or whether</p>
<p>   this is your country of choice, it is equally our own and we all</p>
<p>   have a right to share in its benefits and we all have a right to</p>
<p>   enjoy both its tolerance, its respect and its protection. </p>
<p>I have great confidence that the next century hold enormous prospects</p>
<p>   for Australia. I have a great belief that the unique intersection</p>
<p>   of which I spoke gives a capacity to leave a mark, not only on this</p>
<p>   part of the world, but on the world generally which would be denied</p>
<p>   to any other community.</p>
<p>I thank the Federation for inviting me here today. We will continue</p>
<p>   to have as a government and at a political level as two coalition</p>
<p>   parties we'll continue to have a constructive ongoing dialogue</p>
<p>   with your organisation. We will agree on some things, we will disagree</p>
<p>   on others. You will like some of the things we do, you will dislike</p>
<p>   some of the other things we'll do. That is in the nature of</p>
<p>   public office and public life. But I come on behalf of the Government</p>
<p>   in goodwill, with a positive attitude to all of the organisations</p>
<p>   and all of the different groups that are represented here today.</p>
<p>I thank you for inviting me, I wish you and your deliberations</p>
<p>   well and I look forward to three years of constructive co-operation.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
