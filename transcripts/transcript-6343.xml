CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EBRODUTL8PM<br />
AUSTRAIA(<br />
SPEECH AT NSW ALP ELECTION CAMPAIGN LAUNCH, SYDNEY, 13 MARCH 1984<br />
FELLOW AUSTRALIANS, Just over a year ago I spoke at another policy ' Launch fo<br />
the Australian Labor Party in this great city of yours in this<br />
great city of ours.<br />
I pledged myself and our Party to an unremittinqi effort<br />
to bring Australians together to beat the economic crisis and to<br />
end the politics of division and confrontation.<br />
Twelve months later, the Australian community is more<br />
cohesive, more united, than it has been in living memory.<br />
Industrial disputation has fallen to historically low<br />
levels. And through this process of reconciliation, consultation<br />
and co-operation, we have turned the nation's economy around.<br />
E14BARGOED UNTIL 8 P. M. </p>
<p>The confidence and self-confidence of the Australian<br />
people has been restored.<br />
In all this effort, the people of New South Wale3, the<br />
business community of New Sout~ h WaleS, the union movement of New<br />
South Wales, and the Wran labor Government of New South Wales,<br />
have made a magnificent contribution.<br />
Within a month of the swearing in of our Government on<br />
the eleventh of March 1983, I convened the National Economic<br />
Summit Conference. All the participants made tneir contribution, but some<br />
were outstanding. And central to the success of the Summit not just its<br />
work but its spirit was the role played by the Premier of New<br />
South Wales, Neville Wran.<br />
And Neville Wran and his Labor Government of New South<br />
Wales have continued to play a crucial role in the great work of<br />
building upon the Summit the great task of national<br />
reconciliation, national recovery, and national reconstruction.<br />
And it is absolutely vital for the future of Australia<br />
that Neville Wran and his Government continue that work in the<br />
critical years ahead. </p>
<p>We know all too well the alternative.<br />
We know all too well the utterly negative attitudes of<br />
the Liberals and the Nationals the Parties of confrontation and<br />
conflict, the Parties of denigration and detraction.<br />
They denigrated the Summit.<br />
They derided the concept of consensus.<br />
They denounced the Prices and Incomes Accord the very<br />
key to our strategy for economic recovery.<br />
And now, in their desperation, they are denouncing,<br />
deriding, denigrating and defacing the very institutions which<br />
make up the fabric and foundations of our free, open, democratic<br />
society. And when we say that experience is a major issue in this<br />
New South Wales election, we mean not only the vast experience of<br />
Neville Wran and his team in dealing with the immense and complex<br />
problems involved in governing Australia's largest State. </p>
<p>We mean your own experience your own knowledge of<br />
what our opponents really stand for the old politics of<br />
divisiveness and confrontation, inplace of the co-operation and<br />
consultation on which we, as the Government of Australia and the<br />
Government of New South Wales, are building a better nation for<br />
all Australians. Eight years ago, Neville Wran won a watershed victory<br />
which paved the way for Labor's great resurgence throughout<br />
Australia and ultimately to the historic victory of the fifth of<br />
March 1983. So that is something every Australian should be grateful<br />
for and I stand here tonight to acknowledge my own debt.<br />
But much more important has been the contribution and<br />
co-operation from Neville Wran and his Labor Government of New<br />
South Wales in the task of rebuilding Australia over the past<br />
year. And without that co-operation, the continuing work would<br />
suffer a tremendous blow.<br />
New South Wales needs a Labor Government.<br />
But all Australia needs a Labor Government in New South<br />
Wales. </p>
<p>There must be an end to the spurious campaiqn of<br />
villification, this new McCarthyism, Liberal-style.<br />
And the people alone can now end it.<br />
And they can end it once and for all by returning Neville<br />
Wran and the Labor Government on the 24th of March.<br />
I need Neville Wran. New South Wales needs Neville Wran.<br />
Australia needs Neville Wran.<br />
Let him get on with the job the real task of building a<br />
better New South Wales and helping our Government build a better<br />
Australia. </p>
