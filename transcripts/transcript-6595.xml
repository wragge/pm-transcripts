E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW THE MIDDAY SHOW WITH RAY MARTIN<br />
21 FEBRUARY 1985<br />
MARTIN: The Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke has for the past<br />
two days been involved in close discussion with all the parties,<br />
and he has joined up in our Parliament House studio with us now,<br />
so welcome to the show Mr Hawke.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Thanks Ray.<br />
MARTIN: I know that you have spent the last couple cf hours,<br />
the last hour or so with the Federal President of the AMA and<br />
with Mr Mulock, the NSW-Minister, do you have good news for us?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, talks are continuing Ray, I don't want<br />
to at this stage say anything by way of public comment to prejudice<br />
those discussions, but I have some optimism.<br />
MARTIN: Well, that's good. We'll leave it at that then.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Thank you.<br />
MARTIN: I don't want to be too melodramatic about it, but cuite<br />
clearly we have reached the twelFth hour, there is the prospec:-<br />
that someone will die in a NSW hospital soon.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I have a great senseogesperation, in one way<br />
about the position that has been reached and-I have a great<br />
feeling of compassion for those people who have suffered so far<br />
and may suffer more. I don't think however, that by me engaging<br />
at this stage in blame attribution and criticism that I am going<br />
to help things. As I say there are some discussions going on,<br />
and I hope that as a result of the dedicated efforts of both<br />
the Government here and Premier Wran and his Ministers and our<br />
opportunity to talk to those people who do really want to get th-e<br />
matter resolved that we will be able to do that. I certainly<br />
am prepared to bend all our best efforts to that end. I think<br />
we will get there, and I hope soon.<br />
MARTIN: The fact that you are putting so many hours into this<br />
is indicative of your concern, that you do see it as a major<br />
crisis. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: It is a very, very serious crisis. A lot Of<br />
crises that face the nation and so on, can be seen in ceneral<br />
economic terms, they don't have an immediate personal dimension,<br />
but this does. It is innocent kids and mothers, old people Nf.! o are<br />
suffering and we want an end brought to that.<br />
MARTIN: Again, I hesitate to ask you this question. It may<br />
be too soon because of the discussions you are talking about<br />
is it a case of Dr Blewett having to go or Medicare having to go.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No certainly Dr Blewett doesn't have to go and<br />
will not go. Unfortunately there has been a section of the<br />
profession in NSW who I believe have wanted to use this dispute<br />
as a method of trying to smash Medicare. Now, the situation<br />
is that the people of Australia have endorsed that and that scheme<br />
is here and it is here to stay. But it was no intention of<br />
the Government in giving effect to the will of the people in regard<br />
to a universal and fair system of medical and health irnsurance.<br />
It was no part of our intention to inflict income losses, serious<br />
income losses on Doctors, who conduct part of their practice<br />
in public hospitals. We don't want them to carry the b urden<br />
and we therefore are open to discussions about how we can meet some<br />
problems that have emerged in that area. And it is in this, I<br />
believe responsible way of negotiation and discussion with them<br />
that we can get a resolution bf the problem.<br />
MARTIN: Now, Linsday Thompson is the Federal President of the<br />
AMA, but does he speak for the surgeons.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, we have to concede Ray, that there is<br />
some medical politics going on, there's some demarcation disputes,<br />
if I can use the language of the trade union movement. And that<br />
has increased the difficulties. We have tried ourselves not<br />
to make worse that conflict within the medical profession and<br />
therefore we have been prepared to speak as well as to the AMA,<br />
to representatives of the procedural specialists. Now, I spoke<br />
on two nights in succession with the procedural specialists and<br />
their representatives here in Canberra. We weren't able to get<br />
anywhere because they seemed to be more concerned with the idea<br />
of smashing Medicare, and so we are now in discussions with<br />
Lindsay Thompson and I believe we, as I say we've got the chance<br />
of getting somewhere.<br />
MARTIN: There seemed to be of course, good arguments on both sides,<br />
but I guess ordinary Australians are saying, look we don't want<br />
your excuses we just want those doctors back.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, of course the people want the doctors back<br />
and of course My Government and Mr Wran's Government wants the<br />
doctors back. We want the public hospital system working and<br />
working well and producing the good and efficient service to the<br />
people of NSW that it has so markedly done in the past. And in<br />
so far as there are real problems concerning the impact upon<br />
doctors of the transition to Medicare which has affected adversely<br />
their income, they are entitled to be heard and we are discussing .13 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER cont: those matters with them. What cannot happen<br />
though is there cannot be a use of this particular dispute to try<br />
and smash the whole system of Medicare. Now, I think we have reache&amp;<br />
the point where we are sorting out those two issues, separating<br />
them as they must be done, and I repeat Ray it is a little bit<br />
difficult I can't go into more details at the moment, but there<br />
are serious discussions going on with Dr Thompson and his<br />
colleagues. I think there is a chance of success there.<br />
MARTIN: Alright let's go further north of the border Mr Prime<br />
Minister. Sir Joh has asked you for help strange bed-fellows<br />
I would have thought with the I am thinking of the electrical<br />
workers strike in Queensland, are you going to help him out?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course I am not going to help out in those<br />
terms. Now let's be quite clear about this position, earlier<br />
this week Sir Joh got in touch with me and he was talking about<br />
wanting to bring in people from overseas, and what would be the<br />
position in regard to visas. Now, I said well you send me something<br />
in writing about it and we'll look at that. Now, I have had my<br />
Minister, Mr Ralph Willis across this issue and in the event<br />
yesterday I issued a statement calling upon all parties that was<br />
not just the unions, but the employers and the Government there<br />
to respect the decision of the independent umpire.* Now, let's<br />
have this quite clear, so everyone has the facts clearly in their<br />
mind the State Industrial Commission is the arbitral tribunal<br />
in Queensland, not appointed by any Labor Government. All the<br />
appointments under the term and time of Government of Sir Joh,<br />
so it is his appointed tribunal. Now that tribunal, on two<br />
occasions on the 7th and 13th February, I think are the dates,<br />
are the latest decisions the tribunal said to all parties<br />
here are our recommendations our instructions to you return<br />
to work on these terms. Now it is very interesting that the<br />
workers and the unions and the employers both said yes, we accept<br />
that. In other words the unions employed in the SEQEB said yes,<br />
we accept that. The SEQEB which is the South Eastern Queensland<br />
Electricity Board that's the direct employer said yes, we<br />
accept that. So in the classic industrial relations dispute<br />
situation you had the unions and the employer saying yes we accept<br />
the decision and the recommendation of the independent umpire.<br />
Now in any other state of Australia or in the Commonwealth<br />
jurisdiction that would be the end of the matter, because when<br />
you have the employer and unions saying yes, we accept to go<br />
back, but what happened here the Premier intervened and said<br />
no. So despite the fact that you had agreement between the<br />
employer and the unions, yes this will settle it the Premier<br />
stopped it. Now in those circumstances, it is quite clear Ray,<br />
that no responsible Prime Minister or Commonwealth Government<br />
can intervene and try and override the independent tribunal and the<br />
agreement of the employer and the unions.<br />
MARTIN: Put it in shorthand for us then Mr Hawke, I mean you've<br />
said that some surgeons are trying to break, bust Medicare, is<br />
Sir Joh trying to bust the unions in Queensland? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER; Well, I am a reasonably ambitious person in<br />
terms of -and am reasonably confident in terms of my ca-pacitvy<br />
to understand things. I think I am reasonably intelligent, but<br />
it justifies my ambition and imagination to understand precisel-i<br />
what is in the mind of Sir Joh. Certainly many of his own<br />
Cabinet colleagues can't understand what he is about, they<br />
are in dispute with him, and increasingly so are employers in<br />
Queensland. Now, since I have been Prime Minister I haven't<br />
tried to pick fights with Sir Joh. I have tried as far as I can<br />
to be co-operative because my concern is the interest of the people<br />
of Queensland and of Australia. But I am not going to get -: nt* c<br />
a position where I am going to be aligned with Sir Joh in tryinz<br />
to smash the arbitration system, because that's what's involved.<br />
He may have in mind trying to smash some trade unions, but z-uc--<br />
more fundamentally than that as far as the people of Queenslaand<br />
are concerned he is trying to smash the arbitration system andc<br />
that's not on. I mean the BLF are about that too I suppcse you<br />
could say. Some strange bed-fellows in these attacks upcn the<br />
arbitration system and I reject the attempts of the BLF to smash<br />
the system. I reject the attempts of Sir Joh to smash it.<br />
MARTIN: Did it tickle your sense of humour though that he shoul; d<br />
say to you, come on Bob give us a hand.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I have witnessed Joh in action now, for a<br />
couple of years from the vantage point of Prime Ministership.<br />
I think really I've reached the poi* nt%. where nothing amazes e<br />
about Sir Joh.<br />
MARTIN: Alright Mr Hawke, just between you and me.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, and a couple of million other people, yes.<br />
MARTIN: Are you having fun in this job?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I enjoy it. I worked hard I guess to get<br />
here, and I've enjoyed it. Basically if I can very qu-' ckly say<br />
why I enjoy it is that you are in a position where you can waJra<br />
great deal of assistance, from a great range of decert oecple<br />
I mean not only in Parliament, but in the business ; uun.<br />
organisations of Australians, trade unions, a whole range of<br />
people there' has been a great deal of co-operation to try an:<br />
get this country going again. I think we have turned it arcund.<br />
We had inherited a very, very severe recession. We are creati. ng<br />
more jobs, we have brought inflation down, we are creating more<br />
opportunities for young people and that, I mean it is very hard<br />
to explain Ray, what an enormous of sense of satisfaction and 7I<br />
think legitimate pride that can give to you. And I repeat it<br />
not something you do yourself, but I feel I have been able to<br />
generate an enormous amount of co-operation and co-operative<br />
spirit amongst the people in the organisation of Australia, an:-<br />
that is very satisfying.<br />
MARTIN: We had an old mate of yours on earlier in the progra...,<br />
George Negus.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Old George, yes how is he going?<br />
MARTIN: Old George suggested you were more fun when you were<br />
drinking. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: It may have been more fun for him and it may<br />
at-times have been more fun for me, but I think I am a -more<br />
efficient Australian since I have stopped.<br />
MARTIN: What about your hide Mr Hawke, is the hide thicker now,<br />
do you handle I mean we have got a cartoon for example<br />
from this week's Bulletin you must have seen. " Look I am not<br />
Jesus Christ". -" That's another broken promise."<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I hope that's not revealing a state secret.<br />
MARTIN: But I mean is the hide thick now, do you handle those<br />
headlines that say, Hawke does a back-flip, MX missile stuff.<br />
When you see the headlines that you vehemently disagree with, can<br />
you handle that now?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Sure, I have always been able to handle that.<br />
I mean I was a fairly public figure before I went into Parliament.<br />
I had ten years as President of the ACTU. I mean there was no<br />
absence of cartoons then Ray. I can handle it and let me say<br />
I appreciate the cartoonists art. I think it is a great feature<br />
of Australian life, I enjoy them.<br />
MARTIN: Alright well did you enjoy the gallop polls. The latest<br />
gallop poll in fact has you way down from that<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, Ilexpected that the events of the last<br />
week would cause a slump for me and the Government and so I was<br />
not surprised. We'll come back, you mentioned the KX, could<br />
I just take a couple of moments briefly to make a point you talk<br />
about a back-flip. The situation there Ray, that is that in good<br />
faith, three Ministers myself, Gordon Scholes, who was then the<br />
Defence Minister and Bill Hayden. We made a decision that we<br />
thought in all the circumstances was in the best interests, not<br />
just of the Government, but of the country. I was then faced when<br />
I got to Brussels with a situation where with the release of that<br />
proposal it was not only in my party, it wasn't just the ' leftwing',<br />
it was right across my party, but it was much broader<br />
than that. There was a concern, and what I could see was that<br />
two important things were in danger, one was the central importance<br />
which I attach and will always continue to attach to the alliance<br />
relationship with the United States which involves the bases here,<br />
ship visits, that's central and I wasn't going to allow something<br />
to develop which would endanger that continuing central issue,<br />
which I regard as fundamental to Australia's external position<br />
buit something which was transient. And secondly, and very<br />
important I think for all the people of Australia, my Government<br />
is about seriously in the relevant international forums trying<br />
to see what we can responsibly do gradually to reduce the level<br />
of nuclear armaments in the world. And I was coming to the<br />
view with all the reaction to that first decision that our integrity<br />
and capacity to work hard internationally, to advance the causes<br />
of disarmament may also be impaired. So, for those two reasons<br />
I changed the decision and I don't think it should be taken as a<br />
sign of weakness, the original decision was taken in good faith.<br />
I think it was the correct thing to do in the circumstances, but then<br />
1--was faced with a new circumstance and I believed then, and when<br />
I got to Brusrels that Australia's best interest in those<br />
circumstances in regard to those two things the centrality<br />
of keeping the United States alliance, the ANZUS intact, with all ./ 6 </p>
<p>a 6.<br />
PRIME MINISTER cont: it entails, and secondly, our capacity<br />
to pursue disarmament proposals in the realm of international<br />
quarters-those were overwhelmingly important. They were more<br />
important and the United States Government understood that they<br />
were more important than adhering to the first decision. So I<br />
want to say, if I can through you to the people of Australia,<br />
I don't believe that the change in the decision was a sign of<br />
weakness. It was the rightful thing to do, and I believe that<br />
as time goes on that will be accepted.<br />
MARTIN: A yes . or no answer, do you think that it affected your<br />
popularity, your poll, that is in this week's Bulletin.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, my change of decision didn't, but what<br />
did affect the Party adversely was the public squabbling and<br />
airing of different views. That certainly hurt it.<br />
MARTIN: Is that going to stop?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
MARTIN: We heard from Mr Lange, the New Zealand Prime<br />
Minister, early this week. He announced on the program~<br />
broke the news that in fact he is coming to Australia. Are<br />
you looking forward to a game of tennis with him?<br />
PM: Yes, as I said, I think I might be a bit quicker on<br />
my feet than David, but<br />
MARTIN: I'm not sure. He is pretty good. And I<br />
understand as well that you are playing cricket again this<br />
coming weekend.<br />
PM: Yes, there is a re-match of the game against the press<br />
in which there was a certain incident back there a couple of<br />
months ago.<br />
MARTIN: Is it true that you are in fact wearing one of the<br />
Ned Kelly helmets?<br />
PM: Not Ned Kelly, but I have had a couple of cricket helmets<br />
sent to me, Ray, and amongst other people Hazel suggested that<br />
it would be appropriate that I should wear it, so I'usually<br />
do what she tells me.<br />
MARTIN: That's good to hear and it's good to have you home,<br />
Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: It's good to be here, thank you. And may I say to you,<br />
Ray, all the best for your new program.<br />
MARTIN: Thank you. </p>
