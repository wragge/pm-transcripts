PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 7I/ 3(<br />
Prime Minister interviewed by Press on Oil Tanker Drivers dispute.<br />
Question: Wilson)<br />
P. M. why have you decided to ask the Arbitration Commission<br />
to adjourn the National Wage Case?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well I think we need to understand that there is a particularly<br />
unreasonable dispute on, which is now tying up oil supplies<br />
right throughout Australia. This isn't an argument really<br />
between employees and an employer, it is an argument within<br />
a union within one union, it's not even a demar-cation dispute<br />
between two unions and the Transport Workers Union's Melbourne<br />
branch are virtually saying that members of thle same union in<br />
the country, in Victoria but employed by a distributor in<br />
Victoria, are not entitled to drive petrol trucks. This is<br />
the height of absurdity, and it is the height of unreasonableness<br />
when you get a situation in which the whole of this nation can<br />
be held up by the executive act of one union because they want<br />
some members of their own union not to be able to do certain<br />
work. I think this particular dispute highlights in a way that<br />
we haven't seen for a long time the utter irresponsibility and<br />
the total selfishness of some people in the union movement,<br />
and it's hard even to say that they are putting their own self<br />
interest first, because it's difficult to see any interest in<br />
this particular case. But their action will certainly result<br />
in a number of people becoming unemployed for different<br />
periods as oil dries up, and it makes a farce of trade union<br />
claims to be concerned about unemployment.<br />
Question: Power)<br />
Mr Fraser, is the Government considering other options to deal<br />
with the dispute?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Tony Street and myself commissioned a report from officials<br />
the middle of yesterday afternoon, and I think they were<br />
working on that late last night, and I expect the reports on my<br />
desk and Tony Street's desk now.<br />
Question: Wilson)<br />
What will you gain by having the Wage Case adjourned though, Sir?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think it will show that we are serious about these particular<br />
matters. It will be up to the wage case to determine whether<br />
it will be adjourned or not, but the Victorian Premier has<br />
told mec that he will certainly support us in that particular<br />
move, and maybe other people will in addition. We need to / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
understand the seriousness of the situation in which one union<br />
says oil supplies to Australia must cease. That's not just<br />
oil supplies to motorists who use petrol to get to work, it'-s<br />
also oil supplies to all industries, small industries and<br />
large industries, and it's an act that can tie up this nation.<br />
Let's get back to the reason why, because this particular union<br />
in Victoria is saying that members of the same union, but who<br />
happen to live in the country part of Victoria instead of in<br />
Melbourne are not entitled to do the same work as their union<br />
brothers who live in Melbourne are entitled to dop. Now, surely<br />
that is about one of the most unreasonable causes for a<br />
stoppage that one has ever heard. If it was a local stoppage<br />
affecting one small part of Australia it would be bad enough,<br />
but take a stoppage of that kind and make it a national strike,<br />
I believe it is the height of absurdity. The tragedy of it is<br />
it can do a great deal of harm, and as we have seen on other<br />
occasions, when you have a major dispute of this kind many<br />
businesses, small businesses, can be so grieviously hit that<br />
people who are stood down as a result of the dispute sometimes<br />
fail to regain their jobs because the businesses are unable<br />
to re-employ as a result of the financial damage.<br />
Question: Power)<br />
Mr Fraser, do you support Mr Hamrer's action in asking Mr Gorman,<br />
the Seymour Services proprietor, to withdraw his actions?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
If all bans were withdrawn that would not be an unreasonable<br />
action, that is the basis of Mr Hamer' s request. But there<br />
should be no suggestion that that action should be withdrawn,<br />
and the union win in relation to this issue, because the<br />
Seymour proprietor is taking this action not necessarily'in<br />
defence of his own financial interests, but in defence of<br />
his own employees who have been driving his petrol trucks and<br />
who are members of the Transport Workers Union. So this again<br />
gets back to the crux of the issue. It is in this particular<br />
instance the section of the law, section 45B, is being used<br />
to protect the rights of Trade Unionists against the predatory<br />
and unreasonable actions of their fellows in the same union.<br />
If the union withdraws all its bans, if the union indicates<br />
that Mr Gorman' s employees, members of the T. W. U.,, are entitled<br />
to do the work, then I would believe there is no further cause<br />
for Mr Gorman' s action to continue. But in the face of a<br />
continuation of union's bans I would believe that Mr Gorman<br />
has no alternative, and certainly nobody should suggest to<br />
him in those circumstances that he should withdraw his action.<br />
I know that what Mr Hamer has said is on the basis of all<br />
bans being withdrawn. </p>
