ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Australia has long been concerned at the almost total exclusion<br />
of our farm products from European markets markets which<br />
were once ma-ior ones for our produce. We are equally disturbed<br />
by the fact that European countries have also been exporting<br />
increasing volumes of heavily subsidised agricultural produce<br />
to third markets, in many cases markets which Australian<br />
exporters have fought hard to build up after their virtual<br />
exclusion from Europe.<br />
Obviously, these concerns were among the issues that we<br />
discussed with the current President of the European Communities,<br />
His Excellency, Mr. Gaston Thorn, during his recent visit to<br />
Australia. It is a matter of regret to Australia that we<br />
should have aL continuing dispute with the European Community<br />
over trading miatters, for in many ways, in many fields, we<br />
have relation~ ships that are substantial and important. Of<br />
course, this is not suprising. Australia and the European<br />
Communities have a shared history and shared cultural values,<br />
and we share a commitment to democracy as partners in the<br />
Western alliance.<br />
In the past year a delegation of the European Parliament<br />
visited Australia; Australia signed an important nuclear<br />
safeguards acreement with EURATOM ( that is the European<br />
Community's A~ tomic Energy Commission); and Australia and<br />
the European Community have held talks at ministerial level<br />
twice, in Brussels last December, and here in Canberra last<br />
week. Moreover, * one of the main duties which President<br />
Thorn performed during his visit was to open officially the<br />
Canberra offices of the Commission's delegation to Australia.<br />
Australia is one of the very few countries outside Europe<br />
where the Commission has established an office responsible<br />
for relations with a single country, and its establishment<br />
must surely contribute to better understanding and more<br />
constructive relationships between Australia and Europe.<br />
President Thorn and I spoke about the international political<br />
situation as well as about economic matters. We discussed<br />
Afghanistan and Poland and the important processes of consultation<br />
among the Western allies following those events. We agreed<br />
that in the present international situation,-the unity of<br />
the Western alliance is more important than ever, and we<br />
agreed that this means that special efforts need to be madeto<br />
avoid disputes among Western-countries in all fields, and<br />
to solve them if they arise. / 2 </p>

Trade disputes in particular can place additional and unnecessary<br />
strains on Western unity. In this regard there has been a recent<br />
dispute in relation to Australia's import policies on footwear and<br />
motor vehicles. The European Community has raised the matter with<br />
the GATT in Geneva. However, during President Thorn's visit it was<br />
agreed that any action on this should be deferred pending further<br />
study and consultations between the two sides. Despite our broad<br />
agreement on a wide range of issues, the fact remains that the<br />
European Community's policies with respect to agricultural products<br />
have cost our. farmers many hundreds of millions of dollars annually<br />
in lost export earnings. Indeed, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics<br />
has estimated that in respect of sugar alone, the trading, policies of<br />
the European Communities have cost Australia $ 130 million annually in.<br />
lost export earnings during the past decade. These losses are a<br />
direct consequence of the Community's common agricultural policy<br />
which provides assistance and protection to agricultural producers in<br />
Europe. It has been estimated that assistance to those producers from<br />
the European Community and from national governments, amounts to some<br />
billion annually, and imposes a huge burden on individuals in<br />
Europe in the form of higher taxes, and higher food prices.<br />
The common agricultural policy pursued by the European Community<br />
involves setting very high domestic prices for the full range of<br />
temperate agricultural products, and applying variable levies which<br />
effectively prohibit imports except in rare cases where there are<br />
shortfalls in domestic production. Not surprisingly, thes; ce policies<br />
have led to surplus production of many agricultural products by<br />
Europe's farmers, which are then exported, with the farmers receiving<br />
further subsidies on these sales in the form of so-called export<br />
refunds. Sc, not only are our farmers' products effectively excluded<br />
from Europea-markets, they also face competition on unfair terms in<br />
other parts c~ the world market from European farmers who are being<br />
subsidised for exporting.<br />
I was very pleased that President Thorn assured me during our discussions<br />
of his own personal commitment to the goal of ending the subsidisation<br />
of European farm exports to international markets, and, generally, of<br />
reforming the common agricultural policy to put firm upper limits on<br />
overall European farm production. On the other hand; the President<br />
also emphasised that the economic situation in Europe at present is<br />
Srather bleak, with 10 millions unemployed and the likelihood that<br />
this will rise to 11 or even 12 millions by later this year, levels<br />
which could place considerable strains on political stability in<br />
several European countries. He stressed that these circumstances<br />
mean that there are limited possibilities at present for the ten<br />
sovereign European Governments to implement significant early structural<br />
changes in industry or agriculture.<br />
We understand Europe's problems. We are not asking the European<br />
Commission to force farmers out of farming. But we do ask that<br />
policies of excessive protection and assistance be reformed, and that<br />
change is not indefinitely deferred. Most importantly we ask that<br />
the consequences of those policies are not exported outside Europe,<br />
undermining the returns to efficient agricultural exporters in markets<br />
around the world. I am pleased that the European Commission has now<br />
at its helm a man committed to work towards reforms in these areas.<br />
