FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 14/ 1969<br />
LORD CASEY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
satisfaction Casey to be I believe all Australians will share a sense of<br />
at Her Majesty's gracious appointment of Lord<br />
a Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.<br />
It is fitting that this great Australian, at the<br />
close of his most remarkable, varied and distinguished career<br />
of devoted public service, both at home and abroad, should be<br />
appointed to this, the most ancient and noble order of Chivalry.<br />
On behalf of us all I am conveying to Lord and<br />
Lady Casey our deep gratitude and admiration for their lifetime<br />
of service and our affectionate congratulations on this most<br />
signal honour which Her Majesty the Queen has conferred upon<br />
him. CANBERRA February 1969 </p>
