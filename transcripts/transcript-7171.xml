PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
AUSTRALIAN FINANCE CONFERENCE ANNUAL DINNER<br />
CANBERRA 4 MAY 1987<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
It is now nearly three years since I last had the pleasure<br />
of addressing the annual dinner of the Australian Finance<br />
Conference. Perhaps by more than anything else, those three years have<br />
been characterised by an increasing acceptance throughout<br />
the whole nation of the fact that if governments are to<br />
succeed, they must get the economic decisions right.<br />
when I last spoke to you in July 1984, my Government had<br />
already proven, over fifteen months in office, that it<br />
recognised and accepted the fundamental importance of the<br />
economic task it faced.<br />
Today, we romain committed to it, confident in the knowledgo<br />
that our efforts are yielding fruit.<br />
It is not just that the majority of the community now<br />
accepts that the prime question facing the nation is indeed<br />
an economic one. What has also happened is that the<br />
evidence for the success of our policies, despite the<br />
difficulties we have endured as a nation, is now starting to<br />
accumulate. Since we meet today at a time of crucial economic decision<br />
making, in the lead-up to the May Statement and the Premiers<br />
Conference, it is appropriate that I take this opportunity<br />
to reaffirm the fundamental principles which, through our<br />
whole time in office, we have brought to this central task<br />
of government.<br />
At the same time, let me acknowledge the great assistance we<br />
have received from organisations such as your own.<br />
The finance industry along with most other parts of the<br />
national economy has undergone significant reshaping. New<br />
competitors and the reduction of rules which previously<br />
created artificial distinctions within markets have probably<br />
made the daily task of a finance manager more challenging.<br />
But at the same time those reforms have provided significant<br />
new opportunities to a more competitive national economy. </p>
<p>Because economics is such a central and at the same time<br />
relatively complex task, it is not surprising that it has<br />
spawned a thousand analogies. Journalists, commentators<br />
even politicians on rare occasions have resorted to the<br />
analogy of allocating slices of the national cake, walking<br />
the tightrope of monetary policy, juggling rival priorities,<br />
and so on.<br />
But to describe what we saw when we came to office in March<br />
1983, no analogy seems more fitting that that of a jigsaw<br />
puzzle where all the pieces had been shaken out of place. We<br />
saw excessive inflation, disastrous levels of unemployment<br />
and a profoundly uncompetitive industrial structure.<br />
It was our task, and our achievement, to rebuild that jigsaw<br />
puzzle. indeed, we set ourselves no less a task than the<br />
revitalisation of Australian industry to prepare it for the<br />
new challenges of our time. We put particular emphasis on<br />
innovation, on restructuring our most highly protected,<br />
least competitive industries, and on opening up Australia's<br />
trading opportunities at a time when many in the world were<br />
seeking to close them down.<br />
We had the courage to float the dollar and to even up the<br />
playing field between competing types of financial<br />
institutions. We increased competition, especially through<br />
the admission of foreign banks.<br />
In short, we proposed and began to implement a radical<br />
reshaping of Australia's economic structure.<br />
Since those early days of Government however, we have had to<br />
manage a second majoir economic challenge the sudden<br />
collapse in our terms of trade, which inflicted immense<br />
damage on the Australian economy.<br />
Put simply, the decline in our export prices has by now<br />
stripped around $ 9 billion from our national economic<br />
capacity. Completion of the economic jigsaw puzzle was made<br />
much harder.<br />
The current account deficit ballooned to an<br />
unsustainable 6 per cent of GDP in 1985-86;<br />
Under the weight of a declining currency the rate of CPI<br />
growth expanded from a low of just over 5 per cent<br />
during 1984* to a temporary peak two years later of 9.8<br />
per cent,<br />
And interest rates, which we had been bringing down in<br />
1984 and 1985, rose again.<br />
My message to you tonight is that despite these temporary<br />
setbacks, our macroeconomic strategy demonstrably is<br />
working. of course, much remains to be done. But tonight,<br />
I want to report on how much progress we have achieved. </p>
<p>As I said in my Address to the Nation last June, the initial<br />
task we faced as a nation after the terms of trade collapse<br />
was to begin to adjust to our lowered standard of living<br />
our lowered national economic capacity by reducing<br />
domestic spending on goods and services, particularly<br />
consumption spending.<br />
There was, and is, no realistic alternative to that course.<br />
It would have been unacceptable and dangerous to embark on a<br />
course of increased borrowing and spending. Equally<br />
unacceptable would have been indiscriminately slashing<br />
government spending without regard to the effects those cuts<br />
might have on needy people who depend on Government support<br />
for their well-being.<br />
I want to underline again that this Government is not about<br />
to abandon Labor's traditional commitment to the<br />
underprivileged and the needy.<br />
Indeed, we are determined that the rigorous disciplines we<br />
are applying to our budget will produce, as far as we can, a<br />
fairer society and one where the limited resources are<br />
fairly applied to those who need them most.<br />
The need to reduce private consumption spending which is<br />
around 60 per cent of GDP also requires wage and salary<br />
earners to accept lower increases than they would have<br />
expected in easier times.<br />
Despite the progress which has already been made in reducing<br />
real unit labour costs 6 per cent since 1983 continued<br />
wage restraint is still required.<br />
In summary, two key areas of restraint needed to promote<br />
successful economic adjustment are fiscal and wage<br />
restraint. I am aware that your Budget submission urges the Government<br />
to make a substantial contribution to allowing sustained<br />
reductions in interest rates.<br />
Nobody is more aware than I that high interest rates bring<br />
hardship to businesses, farmers and home buyers.<br />
But let me make it clear that no one in Government would be<br />
crazy enough to want interest rates a jot higher than is<br />
absolutely necessary.<br />
If interest rates were expected to remain high indefinitely,<br />
the damage to business investment prospects would be<br />
unacceptable. But the Government will not be pushing for a premature, but<br />
ultimately counterproductive, easing in monetary policy.<br />
Experience shows that such action only delays the day when<br />
sustained reductions in interest rates are achieved. </p>
<p>There is some evidence that rates are beginning to fall.<br />
Ten year bond rates are down by a percentage point from<br />
their peak earlier this year. Recent Treasury note tenders<br />
have posted the lowest yields this financial year. The bank<br />
bill market has followed this trend. Bank prime rates are<br />
down by around half a point from the peak in December 1986.<br />
Having mentioned the exchange rate and the Australian dollar<br />
in passing, let me make a comment specifically about them.<br />
The weakness of the US currency has greatly reduced the<br />
significance of movements of that currency as an indicator<br />
of changes in the average value of the Australian dollar.<br />
Greater attention needs to be focussed -by markets, by<br />
policy makers, by potential exporters -on the trade<br />
weighted value of our currency. The value of the $ A<br />
measured in TWI terms, although it has risen significantly<br />
agains. the US dollar, is in fact little changed from its<br />
level of a month ago.<br />
on average recent currency movements have not adversely<br />
affected the competitiveness of Australian producers<br />
though they do reduce the profitability of those exporters<br />
who sell in markets quoted in US dollars and who compete<br />
against producers in the United States.<br />
Earlier, I said that the most important short term task was<br />
to stem the growth of domestic spending, particularly<br />
consumption spending.<br />
Let me outline the success we are enjoying in that regard.<br />
In 1985-86, Australia's real Gross Domestic Product grew by<br />
an estimated 41.2 per cent, Domestic demand contributed<br />
of these percentage points of growth, with consumption<br />
private and public accounting for 2.4 percentage points.<br />
Significantly, net exports contributed only 1.2 percentage<br />
points to growth in that period.<br />
By contrast in the six months to the December quarter 1986<br />
domestic demand actually fell to record a negative<br />
contribution to growth of around 1.5 percentage points in<br />
annual terms. At the same time there was a virtual doubling<br />
in the contribution to growth from net exports in only six<br />
months. That shift towards production for export and towards lower<br />
demand for imports is one important piece of the economic<br />
jigsaw puzzle that we have locked into position already.<br />
The pay-off is already to be seen in our current account<br />
position. Manufacturing exports are 30 per cent higher so<br />
far this financial year than a year ago. And our net<br />
services deficit, that is, our net expenditures on tourism,<br />
freight insurance and other services has fallen 21 per cent. </p>
<p>The current account deficit in the March quarter 1987 was<br />
almost $ 500 million below that of the March quarter 1986.<br />
Indeed, the improvement in the balance of payments over the<br />
past few months has been such that latest estimates of the<br />
1986-87 current account deficit are about $ 1 billion less<br />
than the Budget forecast of $ 144 billion.<br />
A substantial decline in Budget outlays as a proportion of<br />
GDP is expected in 1986-87. Moreover we have reduced the<br />
Budget deficit from the 5 per cent of GDP which we inherited<br />
from our predecessors to around 12 per cent in 1986-87.<br />
I would add that that is an achievement which virtually no<br />
other comparable country has matched over the period.<br />
A further demonstration of the Government's commitment to<br />
fiscal restraint will be provided on Wednesday week when the<br />
Treasurer announces a package of savings measures to the<br />
Parliament. This statement, in advance of the usual Budget date, has<br />
been chosen to give our savings measures maximum impact in<br />
1987-88 so that we can continue our efforts to reduce the<br />
deficit as a proportion of GDP. It is intended to show<br />
clearly that this government is serious about the<br />
painstaking task of reviewing its expenditure.<br />
Many of the cuts the Treasurer will announce could involve<br />
short term political costs for the Government. But we have<br />
never allowed fears of temporary unpopularity to deter us<br />
from making tough but necessary decisions.<br />
As everyone knows, I contemplated calling an early election<br />
which I am certain, and all the available statistics<br />
indicate, we would have won. Indeed the continuing chaos in<br />
the Opposition ranks makes me certain we would have won an<br />
increased majority.<br />
However, I resisted the tempation to grab at short-term<br />
political advantage for this reason: to do so would have<br />
been inconsistent with our long-term strategy to restructure<br />
the economy.<br />
I repeat what I said in my Address to the Nation last June<br />
I would rather risk electoral defeat than implement policies<br />
which would prevent successful economic adjustment.<br />
We have accepted the responsibility of ensuring that welfare<br />
payments do not go indiscriminately where they are not<br />
needed. I don't suppose there is a single person here from the<br />
business community who has any doubt about the correctness,<br />
and the validity, of that approach to ensure that no-one<br />
gets something to which they are not entitled. We will do<br />
our job there. I I </p>
<p>But I trust that there will be a symmetry of attitude in the<br />
business community.<br />
By this I mean I hope there will be an equal acceptance in<br />
the business community of the decisions that we have taken<br />
to ensure those who ar'e better off also don't get something<br />
they don't need.<br />
I hope the clarity of vision which nearly everyone in the<br />
business communitcy has about the need to crack down on the<br />
welfare cheats will be matched by a clarity of vision about<br />
the inappropriateness of providing Government assistance<br />
through the tax system to those who don't need it.<br />
In particular, I hope we will see indeed we are already<br />
seeing significant diminution in the nonsense and the<br />
hypocrisy that has been expressed about the assets test and<br />
the Fringe Benefits Tax.<br />
After the May Statement we will be again playing host to the<br />
Premiers.<br />
There has already been some public comment about the<br />
Premiers' Conf2rence and I do not wish to engage in much<br />
public debate about it now.<br />
The reality is that the. total Public Sector Borrowing<br />
Requirement must decline ais a share of GDP not simply-the<br />
Commonwealth's share of it, as has so frequently been the<br />
case in recent years.<br />
To return to the economic jigsaw, let me return to that very<br />
important piece namely the role of wage and salary<br />
increases.<br />
Widespread commurity acceptance of the new two-tiered<br />
structure of wage fixing demonstrates the continuing<br />
relevance to Australia's changing economic circumstances<br />
both of the consultative mechanism of the Accord, and of our<br />
centralised wage fixing arrangements.<br />
The new system provides for overall wage restraint while<br />
allowing some flexibility at the workplace. In other words,<br />
the decision addresses Australia's economic difficulties at<br />
both the macro--economic level, where there is a need for<br />
continued labour cost restraint, and at the micro-economic<br />
level, where Australian industry needs to become more<br />
competitive and productive.<br />
The two tiered wage system will place a heavy responsibility<br />
on all the industrial relations players to ensure that it<br />
delivers the desired wage outcomes.<br />
Ultimately it is for the Commission to ensure that any<br />
claims made under the second tier are genuine and are not<br />
aimed at circumventing the intent of the wage principles. </p>
<p>I and other members of my Government have made it clear to<br />
both these parties that Australia requires them to act<br />
responsibly in this matter. The Government will not<br />
tolerate agreements which do not comply with the principles.<br />
The arrangements in the second tier also represent a<br />
challenge to improve productivity in the Australian<br />
workplace. Last September I called a meeting of the peak employer<br />
groups and the ACTU to discuss work and management<br />
practices. I was encouraged by the fact that all those<br />
parties accepted the need to remove restrictive work and<br />
management practices and to promote work place reforms<br />
designed to lift Australia's productive potential.<br />
The importance of this commitment must not be underrated.<br />
Australia's future living standards will depend on how<br />
productively we work together.<br />
If we cannot compete with the best technologies and best<br />
working methods abroad we will permanently fail to reach our'<br />
national potential. The cost will be felt in fewer jobs,<br />
lower standards for those in jobs and a reduced ability to<br />
care for the disadvantaged. There are enc-ouraging signs of<br />
real progress being made. But because more needs to be done<br />
I again call on all parties to redouble their efforts.<br />
The constructive approach which has typified progress on the<br />
productivity front has sprung from the new atmosphere of<br />
co-operatior in industrial relations a co-operation which<br />
has also produced the sustained wage restraint of the past<br />
four years.<br />
Previous periods of shrinking national income have usually<br />
been accompanied by massive job losses. Consider, for<br />
example, that in the last year of the Fraser/ Howard<br />
Government, unemployment increased by two hundred and fifty<br />
thousand.<br />
By contrast some 3/ 4 million new jobs have been created<br />
since Labor came to office including some 147,000 over the<br />
past year.<br />
AS predicted, the March quarter CPI at 1.9 per cent, on<br />
average was significantly below the levels of late 1986.<br />
As the impact of past depreciations continues to pass<br />
through the pricing system we expect further reductions in<br />
the rate of inflation during 1987 and into 1988.<br />
The present gap between Australia's inflation rate and that<br />
of our major trading partners will be considerably smaller<br />
in a year's time. Lower inflation will signal another<br />
important piece of Australia's economic jigsaw falling into<br />
place. </p>
<p>of course a crucial element in Australia's capacity to pay<br />
our way in the world in the medium term will be an<br />
appropriate level of business investment.<br />
The boom in non-residential construction in recent times has<br />
been well timed to permit the Australia * n hospitality<br />
industry and other service industries to take full advantage<br />
of their substantially improved competitive position. It is<br />
pleasing also to note the sharp lift in manufacturing<br />
investment, especially in plant and equipment, which has<br />
taken place.<br />
Nevertheless we clearly need to do more here. This<br />
Government's policies have been consistent, well articulated<br />
and constructive. We are doing what can be done to rectify<br />
the financial and structural imbalances inherited from our<br />
predecessors and exacerbated by our reduced terms of trade.<br />
on any reasonable judgement those policies are succeeding.<br />
It is time for men and women of foresight to back Australia<br />
and take the investment decisions which only they can take.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
I want to leave you with some thoughts and some evidence<br />
about the comparative ability of Labor and our conservative<br />
predecessors to manage the nation's economic challenge.<br />
As you would romember, the previous Government had to manage<br />
a significant decline In the terms of trade between the June<br />
quarter of 1976 and the December quarter of 1977.<br />
Though some improvement took place in the following<br />
quarters, the previous government over their first four<br />
years had to fashion economic policies to cope with a net<br />
decline of 7.3 per cent in the terms of trade. But they<br />
failed to see the writing on the wall. They failed to set<br />
in train the necessary policies to restructure the<br />
Australian economy and revitalise Australian industry.<br />
The fruits of their economic management over that period<br />
were real GDP growth of 13.4 per cent and employment-growth<br />
of 4 per cent -about 4million jobs.<br />
By contrast the decline in the terms of trade during Labor's<br />
period has been much sharper and more protracted. The net<br />
fall over the first four years of this Government is<br />
expected to be of the order of 17 or 18 per cent more than<br />
twice that of our predecessors over the same period of time.<br />
How has Labor managed? Real GDP seems set to rise by some<br />
19 or 20 per cent over our four years in office 40 to<br />
per cent more than in their first four years and<br />
employment growth under my Government has been three times<br />
what it was under them.<br />
So this Government has produced more growth and more jobs in<br />
the first four years despite more than double the fall in<br />
the terms of trade. I </p>
<p>Even more conclusively we have achieved it in a world<br />
environment which has been less conducive to export sales.<br />
Real GDP growth in OECD countries rose 16.2 per cent over<br />
those Fraser/ Howard years but, on current forecasts, only<br />
13.4 per cent during our first four years.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
It would be remiss of me if I failed to give you some<br />
thoughts about current events in Parliament House.<br />
I. don't want to turn this dinner into a partisan event. But<br />
I have to say, as Prime Minister of a country which still<br />
faces a profound economic challenge, that it is disturbing<br />
that the business community and the rest of the community<br />
for that matter cannot get clear answers to legitimate<br />
questions about the alternative Government's policies on<br />
taxes, spending cuts and wages policy.<br />
I have said throughout that we will not be distracted from<br />
the central task of Government by the divisions and<br />
diversions of the Opposition.<br />
That central task lies before us. We have a clear goal and<br />
a clear strategy to reach it.<br />
We must continue to restructure the economy.<br />
We must continue to govern with fairness and compassion.<br />
We must continue to provide stability and strength in<br />
government.<br />
And we must continue to govern for the long-term future even<br />
at the expense of copping some of the flak for decisions<br />
which do not please everyone along the way.<br />
We are doing that and we are determined to continue that<br />
mission. That way, Australia will emerge from its difficulties with<br />
renewed strength, renewed competitiveness, and renewed<br />
confidence to build a prosperous future.<br />
