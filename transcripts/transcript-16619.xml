    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today the Prime Minister announced the completion of the first Defence homes to be built under the Nation Building - Economic Stimulus Plan (NB - ESP). He made the announcement visiting one of the homes in Brisbane.</p>
<p>These houses are the first completed out of the 802 Defence homes being constructed nationwide with funding from the Stimulus Plan. They have been completed ahead of schedule and on budget.</p>
<p>The Nation Building Plan will inject $104 million into Queensland's construction industry to build Defence houses. This will support over 200 local construction jobs and many more jobs in supporting industries.</p>
<p>The Brisbane region will receive $32.5 million worth of investment to build 103 new Defence houses.</p>
<p>As part of the Defence Housing Australia Apprenticeship Support Scheme (DASS) launched in early 2009, 20 new apprenticeship places are being created in the residential construction industry, including four in Brisbane and four in Townsville.</p>
<p>Suppliers, manufacturers and the building and construction industry have all responded to the challenge in difficult economic times and through the stimulus plan have cooperated to support employment and stimulate economic growth.</p>
