PRIME MHAINISTE Press Statement No. 384<br />
26 November 1974<br />
NEW COMMUNITY HEALTH PROJECTS<br />
The Prime Minister and Member for Werriwa, Mr Cough<br />
Whitlam, today welcomed the new grants for community health<br />
projects in the Western Metropolitan Region of Sydney. These<br />
were announced in Canberra yesterday by the Acting Minister<br />
for Health, Dr Moss Cass.<br />
Mr Whitlam, said that he had always believed that the<br />
health care obtainable everywhere in Australia should be as good<br />
as the health care obtainable anywhere in Australia. ' Too often<br />
in the past there had been inadequate health facilities in the<br />
rapidly developing outer suburban areas of Australia's cities,<br />
and an over-concentration in other areas.<br />
The Australian Government's real commitment to the<br />
improvement of health care facilities was already illustrated<br />
by yesterday's announcement of $ 8,232,148 for community health<br />
projects throughout N. S. W.<br />
Mr Whitlam. said the Western Metropolitan Area would<br />
receive the lion's share of the total grant of $ 8,232,148 for<br />
community health projects in New South Wales.<br />
The largest N. S. W. grant is $ 291,300 for a Community<br />
Nursing Program in Werriwa/ Prospect. These funds have been made<br />
available to recruit, train and employ 50 community nurses in an<br />
expansion of the project.<br />
Several other grants would also boost nursing<br />
programs in the Western suburbs, Mr Whitlam said. Primary Nursing<br />
Centres will receive $ 82,200 for the establishment of Community<br />
Nurse facilities throughout the region. The Macquare Fields Health<br />
Centre will get $ 58,418 to provide accommodation for community nurses<br />
and to establish a health centre base for secondary services.<br />
Specialist Community Nursing in the Western Metropolitan Region<br />
will benefit from a $ 27,644 grant towards the establishment of<br />
a Community Nurse Support service.<br />
Mr Whitlam. said he was glad that proper attention was<br />
finally being paid to the importance of community nursing<br />
programs and to upgrading facilities for nurses. For too long<br />
nurses had been regarded as the poor relations in health care,<br />
despite the fact that they were in closest and most constant<br />
touch with people in need of care. </p>
<p>Two grants had been announced of particular interest<br />
to women, Mr Whitlam said. A grant of $ 74,100 has been allocated<br />
to establish a Women's Community Health Centre in the Western<br />
Metropolitan Region. This follows the success of the Women's<br />
Community Health Centre in Leichardt which is run by women and for<br />
women. Another grant of $ 41,400 will go towards providing<br />
co-ordinated family planning services in Liverpool, Mt Druitt,<br />
Penrith and Fairfield Health Centres.<br />
Smaller grants will go towards promotipg community<br />
involvement in community health projects in the area and to<br />
establish integrated health education in industry. A grant of<br />
$ 9,525 is to employ a nutritionist working with the health<br />
education team to develop a nutritional education program for<br />
special risk groups in the western suburbs region.<br />
Finally, Mr Whitlam said, $ 34,650 had been recommended<br />
for feasibility studies and the preparation of briefs and<br />
tender documents for a community health centre at Fairfield/<br />
