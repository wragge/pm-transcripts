    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE............................................................................................</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well, it is an immensely courageous step one I have to say which</p>
<p>   has been widely supported by editorial comment right around the</p>
<p>   country today, demonstrates again that the electorate takes underestimates</p>
<p>   John Howard at their own peril. But he has come to this with some</p>
<p>   credit. He has been advocating tax reform for the bulk of his parliamentary</p>
<p>   life. Now he holds the reigns and he has put something on the table.</p>
<p>   He is on the line in Canberra. Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Alan.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Can we just try, because it is complicated and the purpose of talking</p>
<p>   to you is to try and simplify it, we will just start with the simple</p>
<p>   things first. The income tax scales, just a comment on that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the best thing about them is that you can now go from $20,000</p>
<p>   a year income to $50,000 and that is probably 60 to 70 per cent</p>
<p>   of wage and salary earners in Australia without going into a higher</p>
<p>   tax bracket. So for that group of people we have effectively abolished</p>
<p>   bracket creep and that is a massive reform, it is a big cut in income</p>
<p>   tax but for low and middle income earners to be able to increase</p>
<p>   your income through overtime, getting a better job, working harder</p>
<p>   and know that you won't go into a higher tax bracket until</p>
<p>   you hit $50,000 a year is a terrific reform.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Right, put it another way, you are shifting the emphasis from income</p>
<p>   tax are you not to indirect tax and you are taking out $13 billion</p>
<p>   out of income tax?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we are making the whole system more efficient. One of the</p>
<p>   dividends of a GST is that you collect more tax because it is harder</p>
<p>   to dodge and that enables you to spend the extra money you collect</p>
<p>   on giving income tax cuts. The shift that you talk about is not</p>
<p>   as marked as some may imagine is a real dividend out of the black</p>
<p>   economy and in other areas of efficiency of having a GST and that</p>
<p>   is very important for the future debate because others will come</p>
<p>   along and say: oh you can have these tax cuts, you can have all</p>
<p>   of these changes without a GST. You simply can't because without</p>
<p>   a GST you don't get the huge tax savings for business, which</p>
<p>   is important for jobs, nor do you get the efficiency gains through</p>
<p>   getting money out of the black economy....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I'll come to the GST in a minute, we'll just do that</p>
<p>   specifically. Just t he personal things. So income tax, and I say</p>
<p>   to our listeners the margins are quite clear, the rates are clear,</p>
<p>   check your own position because the tables are everywhere. Let's</p>
<p>   go to private health insurance which is a matter of crisis. You</p>
<p>   are going to provide a 30 per cent tax rebate on private health</p>
<p>   insurance premiums?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes we are. That is a huge injection of support into private health</p>
<p>   insurance and this is available to everybody. There is no income</p>
<p>   test on it.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>And that'll start immediately?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That will start in January of next year. It starts 18 months ahead</p>
<p>   of the tax package and it will mean that if you have got a policy</p>
<p>   of $2,000 a year you will get $600 back from the tax man or you</p>
<p>   can get it earlier by going along to the Government office and presenting</p>
<p>   the receipt for the payment of the health insurance premium. The</p>
<p>   beauty of this is that it is equal to or better than full tax deductibility</p>
<p>   for 81 per cent Â 81 per cent Â of the entire Australian</p>
<p>   community. It is a real injection and when you add it to the $915</p>
<p>   million extra that the Government put into the public hospitals</p>
<p>   last week it means that our credentials in supporting health care</p>
<p>   in the Australian community are second to none.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Okay. Right now families, people out there listening to you, there</p>
<p>   is mum, dad. Just take mum, dad and three children could we by way</p>
<p>   of simplifying it and have one of the children under the age of</p>
<p>   five. Now under your family tax initiative that you introduced in</p>
<p>   January last year, that has been going for about 18 months, you</p>
<p>   provided did you not, you increased the tax-free threshold by $1,000</p>
<p>   for each child and by $2,500 for each child under the age of five.</p>
<p>   So could we just take our listeners through what this means now.</p>
<p>   Firstly, your tax-free threshold for that family has gone up hasn't</p>
<p>   it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the tax-free threshold for each child irrespective of age,</p>
<p>   under 16, has gone up by an additional $1,000. In other words, we</p>
<p>   have doubled it.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Yes, the overall tax-free threshold for the income earner has gone</p>
<p>   from $5,400 to $6,000 hasn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The basic threshold has gone from $5,400 to $6,000 then on top</p>
<p>   of that you now get $2,000 for each child and on top of that if</p>
<p>   it's a single income family, in other words, mum or dad at</p>
<p>   home looking after the children you now get an additional $5,000....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>For the child under five?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>For the child under five you get $5,000. So if you have got a single</p>
<p>   income family one child under five your tax-free threshold is $13,000.</p>
<p>   And then on top of that for each additional child you can have another</p>
<p>   $2,000. So your example, if my calculations are correct, your example</p>
<p>   you are up to $17,000.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>That's correct.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And then on top of that, that man gets the taxation cuts of which</p>
<p>   I spoke of earlier. And you are looking at somebody in the $35,000</p>
<p>   to $40,000 a year range and there are a lot of families in Australia</p>
<p>   that are living on that with one income and three children and it</p>
<p>   is not easy and they will get in the order of $45 to $50 a week</p>
<p>   tax cut after the GST out of this deal. And, of course, if they</p>
<p>   have got private health insurance they will get the benefit of which</p>
<p>   I spoke earlier and also there is built into that $45 to $50 a week</p>
<p>   a significant increase in some of the family benefits that they</p>
<p>   are also getting.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Yes, and the one final thing on that, just keeping it simple, the</p>
<p>   income test because many people out there on low incomes qualify</p>
<p>   for a family allowance. You have raised...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's been liberalised. Instead of it starting to cut out</p>
<p>   at $24,000 odd it now starts to cut out at $28,000. And instead</p>
<p>   of cutting out at a rate of 50 cents in the dollar the taper rate</p>
<p>   has been reduced to 30 cents. It eliminates the poverty traps of</p>
<p>   which many of the groups like the Salvation Army and ACOSS have</p>
<p>   quite correctly spoken. And very importantly it gives people a greater</p>
<p>   incentive to find a job because under some of these arrangements</p>
<p>   in the past you could actually be worse off with a job than being</p>
<p>   on welfare and there is nothing worse than that.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Absolutely. Childcare, just a quick one there because that affects</p>
<p>   a lot of people.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well for low income families there will be an increase of about</p>
<p>   $7.50 a week per child and we are simplifying the payments. </p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Maximum payment of over $116.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>$116 and then extra loading for each additional child. Any suggestion</p>
<p>   that we have sort of in any way not fully looked after working parents</p>
<p>   is wrong. We have simplified the benefit, we have protected existing</p>
<p>   levels and in relation to the lower income people there is an increase</p>
<p>   of about $7.50 a week. And, of course, all parents Â all parents</p>
<p>   Â share in the doubling of the tax-free threshold for children</p>
<p>   and, of course, the cuts in personal income tax. And bear in mind</p>
<p>   if you have got two incomes you get two increases in the tax-free</p>
<p>   threshold. Both of you get the benefit of the personal tax cuts.</p>
<p>   If you are both earning between $20,000 and $50,000 a year you can</p>
<p>   both work as much as you want to extra and up to $50,000 you don't</p>
<p>   go into a higher tax bracket. That capacity to move from $20,000</p>
<p>   to $50,000 without going into a higher tax bracket will do wonders</p>
<p>   for peoples motivation in relation to things like overtime. How</p>
<p>   often do you hear somebody say to you: Âoh it's not worth</p>
<p>   working overtime, the taxman takes half of it.' Well the taxman</p>
<p>   won't take half of it under these scales.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>[Commercial break]</p>
<p>Prime Minister, for those people on benefits and pensions, this</p>
<p>   package would increase the maximum rate of all income support payments</p>
<p>   so...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes it increases them by 4 per cent and that 4 per cent is paid</p>
<p>   on the 1st of July 2000 when the plan starts so that</p>
<p>   pensioners have the additional money in their pocket as some of</p>
<p>   the price rises occur. We have calculated that that amount is well</p>
<p>   ahead, at least 1.5 per cent or more ahead of the estimated CPI</p>
<p>   increase and we are going to guarantee to pensioners that at all</p>
<p>   times their pension will be in real terms 1.5 per cent above any</p>
<p>   increase in the CPI. So if the CPI goes up by 3 per cent which we...it</p>
<p>   won't but if it does, then we'll make certain that the</p>
<p>   continuing increase and the increase is 4.5 per cent so they are</p>
<p>   always 1.5 per cent ahead. And they have got that as an extra buffer,</p>
<p>   an extra bonus if you like. Now that's....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Plus the cash bonus.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>In addition to that anybody who has got investment income and who</p>
<p>   is 60 years or more will get a $1,000 untaxed upfront payment. Over</p>
<p>   and above that, if you are a self-funded retiree and you have got</p>
<p>   an investment income and most of them do you will get another $2,000</p>
<p>   if you are of pensionable age. And that is subject to an income</p>
<p>   test, it is fully available under $20,000 a year and it phases out</p>
<p>   between $20,000 and $30,000. And then on top of that, of course,</p>
<p>   for retired people we are going to abolish provisional tax. Say</p>
<p>   that again, abolish provisional tax. It's the bane of existence</p>
<p>   of a lot of retired people, a lot of farmers, a lot of small business</p>
<p>   people...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>A lot of people with income outside wages.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Indeed, income outside wages and then also for retired people a</p>
<p>   lot of them have shares and under this franking credit system as</p>
<p>   it is called, sounds complicated but the company pays the tax at</p>
<p>   36 cents and then you get the dividend with the tax paid on it.</p>
<p>   But if your tax rate is less than 36 per cent you don't get</p>
<p>   the full value of that. And what we are going to do now is arrange</p>
<p>   for it to be refunded from the tax department so if there is a tax</p>
<p>   of 36 cents paid and you are only paying 20, we'll get the</p>
<p>   tax department to send you the 16 per cent, send you a cheque. Now</p>
<p>   that will be of enormous assistance to many modest income retired</p>
<p>   people. And, of course, also for retired people the private health</p>
<p>   insurance rebate will be very beneficial. Many of them have paid</p>
<p>   for private health insurance all their lives, they need it, they</p>
<p>   feel it gives them security. It's very expensive now. A 30</p>
<p>   per cent cheque from the Government to help you pay for it will</p>
<p>   be of enormous assistance.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Good on you. Well let's just sum up there what we have tried</p>
<p>   to do. And we are not here to start challenging, we are here to</p>
<p>   try and seek some explanation. So that's the personal tax scales,</p>
<p>   we are talking about pensioners, those without work, we are talking</p>
<p>   about health, we are talking about self-funded retirees. Let's</p>
<p>   now go to the central component of the package, Prime Minister,</p>
<p>   the GST.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Now the revenue from that you say will go to the States. I have</p>
<p>   some questions this morning about which taxes it will abolish. I</p>
<p>   understand that you have said that conditional upon them getting</p>
<p>   the money is that FID goes, debits tax goes, stamp duty goes, stamp</p>
<p>   duty on mortgages, on bonds, on leases, bed tax goes. Some asked</p>
<p>   me land tax, land tax is not included in it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, land tax is not included. But it is a condition of the States</p>
<p>   getting the money that they abolish all of the taxes that you have</p>
<p>   mentioned and, of course, first and foremost we will abolish all</p>
<p>   of the wholesale sales tax which is a Federal indirect tax. But</p>
<p>   we will say to the States: you can have the GST revenue in full</p>
<p>   provided you get rid of all of these taxes like stamp duty on shares,</p>
<p>   stamp duty on business conveyancing, cheques, promissory notes,</p>
<p>   bills of exchange....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>And on your mortgage.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And on your mortgage. The financial institutions duty, the bank</p>
<p>   accounts debit tax, the dreaded bed tax in New South Wales which</p>
<p>   is a tax on the Olympic Games in a sense. And that must be removed</p>
<p>   by the 1st of July in the year 2000 before the Olympic</p>
<p>   Games starts, and the tourist industry will like that. So all of</p>
<p>   those taxes have got to go for the States to get the proceeds of</p>
<p>   the GST and I think that is a very good arrangement.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Okay, now it won't apply to the export...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>...of goods or services consumed outside Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it will make Australian exports cheaper to the tune of $4.5</p>
<p>   billion a year. See what a lot of people forget is that if you are</p>
<p>   in export and you buy a computer and you pay 22 per cent sales tax</p>
<p>   on that, now you don't get that back. Whereas under this system</p>
<p>   you pay 10 per cent on it, you'll get it back and that means</p>
<p>   that your export when it is finally produced is cheaper to the tune</p>
<p>   of all the tax that you have recovered. And we calculate that that</p>
<p>   will make Australian exports cheaper to the tune of $4.5 billion.</p>
<p>   Now at a time when Australia must trade to survive that's a</p>
<p>   terrific boost.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Right so the inputs in anything that is exported won't be</p>
<p>   taxed?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's right and also it is not just exports but it is also</p>
<p>   any business operator can get the tax paid on his or her inputs</p>
<p>   back. So the gain for business out of this is enormous.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>GST credits?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>GST credits.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Right now just for business out there listening they have to collect</p>
<p>   this stuff. It is collected, as I understand it, every quarter and</p>
<p>   they have got up to 21 days following the end of the quarter so</p>
<p>   business will have access to that revenue for an average of 66 days?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They will. It's a very big cash flow gain for businesses.</p>
<p>   If you have got a turnover of less than $20 million a year, and</p>
<p>   that is more than 99 per cent of all businesses in Australia, you</p>
<p>   will remit on a quarterly basis if you are a very big company such</p>
<p>   as Coles or Woolworths you will remit on a monthly basis. The cash</p>
<p>   flow gain from this is huge and as you say small, well $20 million</p>
<p>   is not small, but any company with a turnover of less than $20 million</p>
<p>   is remitting quarterly, $20 million remitting quarterly will have</p>
<p>   the money for an average of 66 days. That will improve their cash</p>
<p>   flow position. That will help them in all number of ways.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>[Commercial break]</p>
<p>Okay Prime Minister, we chop off the wholesale sales tax and that</p>
<p>   is replaced with a GST. Things should be cheaper, the customer out</p>
<p>   there is saying how can I be sure the wholesale sales tax is going</p>
<p>   to be removed.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we are going to give the Australian Competition Commission</p>
<p>   additional powers to enforce that with fines of $10 million for</p>
<p>   unscrupulous people who try and exploit the change. I can tell the</p>
<p>   Australian people that we will leave no stone unturned to make certain</p>
<p>   that there is a full passing on of the price benefit of the removal</p>
<p>   of the wholesale sales tax. And certainly a lot of items will fall</p>
<p>   in price, a family car for example now has a wholesale sales tax</p>
<p>   of 22 per cent, under this there will be a GST of 10 per cent so</p>
<p>   that car will fall quite significantly in price. Other items, of</p>
<p>   course, will go up, we don't deny that. But we calculate that</p>
<p>   across the board the price increase will be a one-off 1.9 per cent</p>
<p>   and, of course, all of the figures I have used earlier about tax</p>
<p>   benefits are after allowing for the price effect of the GST.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Right, now a lot of the big cost in business and in daily life</p>
<p>   in trying to make a quid is the cost of fuel. You're providing</p>
<p>   a diesel fuel credit for registered business?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are but before I come to that can I make the general point that</p>
<p>   all businesses, whether they use diesel or not will find that there</p>
<p>   fuel is, on average, 7 cents a litre cheaper. If you are running</p>
<p>   an ordinary suburban business now and you buy petrol you have got</p>
<p>   to pay the full bid on it, full excise. Under our plan the excise</p>
<p>   will be reduced to accommodate the GST so that it is no dearer at</p>
<p>   the pump for any motorist Â no dearer at the pump for any motorist</p>
<p>   - but the business man will be able to get a refund of the GST component</p>
<p>   and that means that petrol for business use will be 7 cents a litre</p>
<p>   cheaper.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>That's right, if the fuel is used in production....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>In business, in production it will be 7 cents a litre cheaper whether</p>
<p>   you are in diesel or not. Now on top of that we are going to provide</p>
<p>   a special cut in relation to the use of diesel. Diesel fuel will</p>
<p>   be...the excise will be 25 cents lower in heavy road transport</p>
<p>   and rail and in relation to what is called off-road use, that's</p>
<p>   farmers, miners, power generation, things like that, then the diesel</p>
<p>   excise will be completely refunded. Completely refunded. That particular</p>
<p>   change all up, when you take all of the fuel things into account,</p>
<p>   is worth about $3.5 billion. Now what it does is to dramatically</p>
<p>   reduce the cost of transporting items around Australia. Now isn't</p>
<p>   that sensible with such a big country, particularly if you live</p>
<p>   in the outback you need your goods. It costs more to carry them,</p>
<p>   you pay more often. By reducing the cost of carrying them we're</p>
<p>   helping people in the more remote parts of Australia and we're</p>
<p>   recognising that in a big country you should not lose the opportunity</p>
<p>   of reducing the cost of fuel.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just have a breather for one moment if you don't</p>
<p>   mind because we've had a bad accident this morning and the</p>
<p>   M4 has reopened but the traffic is a shambles...</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just one point to clarify on vehicles, there is</p>
<p>   an argument from some because luxury vehicles are taxed at 45 cents</p>
<p>   in the dollar. You have now determined that that luxury cars shouldn't</p>
<p>   come as cheaply as people imagine. As I understand it will be an</p>
<p>   extra tax on cars over $60,000. So if the cost of your car plus</p>
<p>   GST reaches $60,000 you'll then pay what?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You'll pay an extra 25% at the retail level, so-called luxury</p>
<p>   car tax. The cost of it will still come down but the dollar reduction</p>
<p>   will be about the same as a family car just below $60,000. So the</p>
<p>   ÂBeema' will still be cheaper but it won't be dramatically</p>
<p>   cheaper, it will just be ordinarily cheaper, which is fair enough.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Okay. Now let's just do now, in the time that's remaining</p>
<p>   Prime Minister, some quick ones from listeners who've asked</p>
<p>   some questions. You've said that an average of 66 days the</p>
<p>   business will be able to keep the GST revenue and you said that's</p>
<p>   a bonus. What if the business goes broke, what cover do you have</p>
<p>   for keeping...for claiming your own money?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you always get your own inputs back, there's...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>You the Government? You the Government, how will you get your.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you'll just have to take a punt like everybody else.</p>
<p>   I mean why not. Where there's no money, you can't do anything.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Right. How will this new tax system deal with the cash workers</p>
<p>   such as house cleaners, gardeners and the flower seller by the side</p>
<p>   of the road? What's to stop them from simply adding the 10%</p>
<p>   to existing prices and pocketing the extra.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they won't get any of their inputs back unless they get</p>
