<p>Your Excellencies, Premiers, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. In this magnificent setting, on this most beautiful of Australian days, I can only express to you I believe to be the emotion of many Australians on this very special occasion as we reflect upon what has been achieved over the last 100 years. It is an occasion to recall the important historical events that we celebrate today. It's an occasion to honour the tradition of that day 100 years ago and to honour what has been achieved and what is observed today.</p>
<p>But it is also an occasion, my fellow Australians, to look back with both pride and gratitude on what our nation has achieved during its 100 years of existence. To express as one Australian to thousands of other Australians my very simple pride in the way in which this country has remained true over the last 100 years to the principles of freedom and individual liberty.</p>
<p>As we think of that 100 year period, we think of the sacrifices of many, we think of the sacrifices of the thousands of young Australians who died defending the liberty of this country, and defending the cause of freedom around the world. We also think with pride and gratitude of the wisdom of our political leaders 100 years ago who bought the then six colonies of Australia together. We reflect upon the simple fact that Australia is one of but a handful of nations around the world that has remained continuously democratic for 100 years. It is one of but a handful of countries that has remained faithful and true to the principles of the rule of law and representative democracy.</p>
<p>But it's also an occasion to reflect upon the other great Australian achievements. To reflect upon the remarkable way in which this country has absorbed people from 140 nations around the world, in a social experiment without parallel in modern history which has produced a degree of social cohesion which is the envy of the rest of the world. And might we also celebrate that marvellous capacity we have as Australians to choose many of those things from our past and our heritage that work and are of value. And yet we exercise the discretion and the wisdom to put aside those that do not suit the Australian ambience and the Australian attitude.</p>
<p>Though we have many reasons, my fellow Australians, to be very grateful today, we look back with pride and gratitude on what has happened, we reflect upon the astonishing artistic achievements of Australians. We reflect, of course, on the astonishing sporting achievements of the men and women of Australia who represent us on the sporting field with such great distinction. It is in every sense of the word, and a day that unites all of us, and reminds us of that enduring truth that the things that unite us as Australians are always more important and more substantial than the things that might from time to time divide us.</p>
<p>I hope that throughout this day and in the weeks and months to come celebrating the Centenary of Federation, we enjoy ourselves, we look back with pride and gratitude and above all we celebrate together the simple joy of being an Australian.</p>
