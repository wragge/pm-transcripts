PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE 11 APRIL 1985<br />
E. O. E. -PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: Well Ladies and Gentlemen over to you.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister what did you mean last night when you<br />
said " we can't be talking about in 1985, giving some increases on<br />
productivity grounds to productivity which occurred in the past".<br />
PM: Well I was trying incapulate a very brief form the concern<br />
that the Government will have in the conduct of wages policy<br />
generally in regard to the producLivity case whenever the ACTU<br />
decides to take it. That we will wanting to ensure that the<br />
outcome of that case will be consistent with the economic<br />
achievements that have characterised the first two years of<br />
Government. That is, economic growth with low inflation. And you<br />
know that I have had some experience in the Arbitration Commission<br />
and to the way they go about thes things. And I think I was<br />
reflecting in my shorthand statement that experience. It is the<br />
case the way the Commission considers productivity is that they<br />
look back, they look forward; they iook back to get some<br />
assessments, some attemfpts to measure how productivity has been<br />
moving in the economy as a basis for making some assumption about<br />
how, its likely to be moviig in the period within which any<br />
decision the'y take will operate and so I was indicating that the<br />
Government when it appears in this case will be making its<br />
submissions. conscious of the way the Commission does look at these<br />
things. But knowing that importantly for the Commission, for the<br />
Government and I would suggest for the ACTU will all be wanting to<br />
ensure that the de-cision that is taken is consistent with it<br />
economic capacity of the economy in the period in which it<br />
operates.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you be saying at all Sir that there haven't been<br />
improvements in productivity, appreciable improvements in<br />
productivity over the last two years. Enough to take account of<br />
it.<br />
PM: I'm not saying that there haven't been, in fact the answer<br />
that I have just given should indicate that I believe that when<br />
the Commission does entertain the hearing of the ACTU's case that </p>
<p>all the parties wi. Ll be concerned with an analysis of how the<br />
econom has been operating. And the best way of trying to get<br />
some understandit. g the environment within which any decisi. on<br />
that a Commission makes will operate is to try and get some<br />
picture of the past and the relatively recent past. I believe<br />
they will be doing that again, to do it would be consistent it<br />
with the way the Commission has approached these things in the<br />
past. I wanted to emphasise and I take this opportunity again of<br />
emphasising that this Government has been at great pains to turn<br />
the Australian economy around. Its been remarkably successful in<br />
doing that. We've got record growth and employment increase with<br />
very distinct lowering of the inflation rate, a halfing of the<br />
inflation rate. what we'll be concerned about and I believe all<br />
parties there including the Commission will be about, will be in<br />
looking at the past, making decisions which will enable the future<br />
pattern of movement in the Australian economy to maintain that<br />
sort of momentum within those sorts of parameters.<br />
JOU RNALIST: Today's unemployment figures aren't all that terrific<br />
are they.<br />
PM! Its going to be very interesting, you know I'm a reasonably<br />
ke ! n media watcher, I will be watching very carefully to see if<br />
there is total symmetry in coverage between the figures of March<br />
and the figures for February. I mean in February we had an<br />
increase of 44,000 in employment, it wpsn't much coverage of that,<br />
so I presume an equal lack of interest in the fact that the<br />
figures for this month are disappointing. Now I concede that what<br />
you have got to say is that the movements month by month in this<br />
series are somehwhat erratic. Y. ou have got take, therefore, I<br />
think if you are going to gat a picture of how things are moving.<br />
You have got to take the longer term, if you take the March<br />
quarter, which is now available. The March quarter has provided<br />
about half of the increase of some 90,000 new jobs that hav; e<br />
occurr-ed so far in the financial year 84/ 85 and if you take the<br />
longer period back to April 1983, 340,000 increase in jobs. So<br />
we're confident that looking at the other statist-ics that are<br />
available about economic activity that there will be a<br />
continuation of employment growth through time. I am disappointed<br />
that in this particular month it has gone down, obviously must be<br />
one of disappointment, one would rather have seen an increase.<br />
But I am totally confident that if you take the longer term trend<br />
there will be a continuation of employment growth. I still<br />
believe that the target which I set at the beginning of 1983/ 84 a<br />
1/ 2 million new jobs in the first three years of office will be<br />
achieved. We are ahead of that target.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does it undermine your attempt last night to restore<br />
confidence.. PM: No not unless you make the assumption that the market is<br />
entirely irrational in that they say oh this month is down in a<br />
series which has been notably erratic over the last nine months or<br />
so and if they are going to be guided by that month, why after an </p>
<p>increase of 44,000 last month did the market not, if you are<br />
talking abouL the dollar go through the roof. Now I don't think<br />
that they are as irrational as that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke going back to productivity, the ACTU is<br />
talking about a 3% claim phased in. Do you believe thats<br />
reasonable.<br />
PM: I think that such a claim would be a perfectly reasoniably for<br />
the ACTU to What you have got to remember, its not merely a<br />
question of the principles that have been outlined by the<br />
Commission. But lets go to that, the principles of the Commission<br />
itself acknowledge that through a period of time would be<br />
appropriate of the Commission to consider whether under their<br />
auspices there is room for an improvement in real terms in<br />
conditions of employment of the great bulk of the workforce for<br />
which they are responsible. They recognise that and lets also<br />
observe that employers have traditionally recognised that as well<br />
in the opposite position only needs to be stated to be seen to be<br />
qui Ite unreal. If you don't agree that through time there is room<br />
forf reflecting a growth in the economy in real terms, then the<br />
logic of that is that you have no improvement in real standards<br />
ev~ r through time. Now that is an absurdity, no one would suggest<br />
that. The critically important thing is as I gave in my earlier<br />
answers is that you ensu're and this should be the responsibility<br />
of Governments-, Arbitration Commissions, i believe also of the<br />
trade union movement and of employers. But you have got to ensure<br />
that the reflecticn of underlying economic realities through time<br />
is implemented in a way which does not upset the objectives which<br />
are important for everyone, including the trade union movement in<br />
workers. That is increasing employment at low rates of inflation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, last night you said the Government would take<br />
the impact of devaluation into account when you were deciding your<br />
attitude to the productivity case, and today Mir Willis told us the<br />
result of approximately 3% productivity trade off would be<br />
improved super benefits phased in sequentially over 2 to 3 years.<br />
How do you plan to fit the devaluaLion impact consideration in<br />
wi * th the productivity super trade off? Where is there room for<br />
it? 1<br />
PM: Well the actual methods that the Government will adopt, the<br />
positions that the Government will adopt either in indexation<br />
cases or in productivity cases, as I have said on many occasions<br />
and as Mr Willis has said, will be a matter for a* decision at the<br />
time when those cases are being prosecuted. It would be an<br />
exercise in economic managerial irresponsibility to say now<br />
precisely what the best approach is for a position 6 months or 12<br />
months down the track. What the Australian community can be sure<br />
of is that this Government, having achieved better economic<br />
results than there have been in recent memory, is not now going to<br />
adopt positions which would dissipate those achievements or make<br />
it less likely to be able to continue that sort of achievement.<br />
So you can be assured that at the time when we have to put a<br />
I IV z a p </p>
<p>4<br />
position to the Commission that we will put them in . a way which<br />
achieves those results. Now you talk about the possibi,, ity of-a<br />
productivity improvement of that order being brought in over a<br />
period of say 3 years, well obviously if the calculations were<br />
such that the productivity increases in that time could<br />
comfortably accommodate that then you would have one attitude. if<br />
you had doubts because of particular economic circumstances at<br />
that time about the capacity of the economy so readily to<br />
accommodate, then the submissions and positions that you would be<br />
putting would be somewhat different. But let me say this, we are<br />
confident of the future course of the Australian economy and I<br />
want to repeat here again what I said on the program yesterday<br />
that there is a totally firm adherence by this Government to the<br />
commitments it made to the Australian people as to the conduct of<br />
economic management in this country. The trilogy will be adhered<br />
to. There will be a reduction in the deficity. Now it follows<br />
that if we are going to be adhering to the sound and firm economic<br />
management, that we are going to be having an economy which is<br />
performing strongly through 1985. And I believe through 1986.<br />
And it is just precisely how we see the economy performing which<br />
will fashion the exact nature of the submissions that we make.<br />
And I go back to the general observation that I made it is an<br />
accepted fact within the Commission guidelines, within the<br />
attitude of Governments, and the attitudes of employers and trade<br />
unions, that through time you don't simply have an adherence to<br />
the same real L~ tandard. It doesn't happen in this country and it<br />
doesn't happen anywhere else.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke do you accept that one of the consequences<br />
of the devaluation and the Government's offsetting action will be<br />
a higher level of interest rates than the Government would have<br />
previously liked to see?<br />
PM: It is the case that with the greater devaluation than has<br />
been expected, yes there has been more of a movement of interest.<br />
rates that you otherwise would have expected. There is the<br />
relaticnship between what happens to the levels of exchange and<br />
the level of interest rates. We nevertheless believe that given<br />
the fundamental strengths of the Australian economy and I think,<br />
the increasing perception of the strength of the adherence of Lhle<br />
Government to the fiscal management which is embodied in the<br />
triology, that we can expect through the period ofl this year that<br />
there will be, I would expect, a lowering of the level of interest<br />
rates. But also understand that we are right now in the tax<br />
rundown period and you appreciate the impact that that:-of itself<br />
has on the interest rates.<br />
JOURNALIST: So do you think the present increase is in fact<br />
temporary. I mean is this simply a function of the tax rundown<br />
period or would you expect interest rates including mortgage rates<br />
to stay higher for some time after that?<br />
PM: No, I don't expect them to stay high for a long period into<br />
the future. No-one I believe at this stage, Paul, is able to<br />
Pr., -v </p>
<p>weigh each of the factors which is operating in re~ pect of both<br />
the value of our currency and of interest rates. I kno% of no~<br />
economist who would be prepared to weight those facto:-s. But to<br />
the extent that the seasonal rundown, for tax reasons, is<br />
operative, it would be logical to expect that once that factor is<br />
out of the way, that therefore there would be an easing of<br />
pressure. I expect that to be the case. I also expect it to be<br />
the case that to the extent that there has been, that one of the<br />
factors in the lowered level of the value of the dollar has been<br />
some perception of, if you like, non-adherence to previously<br />
stated economic policy approaches. To the extent that that<br />
perception diminishes, as I believe it is now diminishing, and<br />
that there is an acceptance of the commitment of the Government to<br />
firm economic policy, and to the extent that that has been a<br />
factor, I would also expect that therefore to mean an improvement<br />
in regard to interest rates.<br />
JOURNALIST: How did that develop?<br />
PM: HOw did that perception develop? Well as I said yesterday,<br />
and as I have said before, the market as distinct from some views<br />
of it being a collection of very hard-nosed operatives, I think at<br />
times operates in a somewhat irrational way. There may have been<br />
some perception that because of one particular incident or<br />
another, that the Government had departed from adherence and<br />
strong adherence to its economic policy framework. If they<br />
thought that then they were wrong. Now I can't help it if thcy<br />
make a wrong assessment about what is happening to economic policy<br />
making, but I would think that increasingly, as the days and weeks<br />
go ahead, the-, will see the evidence of the Government's continued<br />
commiitment to the trilogy and to a significant reduction in the<br />
money level of the deficit in 1985-86. And to the extent that is<br />
seen, and it is seen that the Government by its action will be<br />
reducing pressures in the public sector borrowing requirement and<br />
giving more room to the private sector then logically certain<br />
consequences should flow in regard to interest rates.<br />
JOURNALIST! Mfr Hawke, do you see the devaluation putting, if<br />
continued, putting so much pressure on that the trilogy just won't<br />
q hold? P. M: The trilogy will hold.<br />
JOURNALISTr: Prime Minister what action does your Government plan<br />
in support of the trade union movement and trade union principles<br />
inQueensland?<br />
PM: Well at this stage I-don't want to go into any detail. Let<br />
me say simply this, that certain discussions are going on I will<br />
be in a position to say more in the relatively near future.<br />
4 JOURNALIST: Will Senator Macklin have your support for his<br />
Private Members Bill?<br />
11.-</p>
<p>PM: Well I hope that this doesn't come as a shock to Senator<br />
MTacklin but I don't follow assiduously everything that he says or<br />
proposes. Which particular pLoposa. is this?<br />
JOURNALIST: The Bill relating the concept of one vote one value?<br />
PM: Yes, well.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you believe in that concept?<br />
PM: I think it is an excellent concept. I wish more people<br />
b-elieved in it. We will be discussing, as a Government, our<br />
attitude towards that. And that will become clear at the<br />
appropriate time.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think it is likely you might support it?<br />
PM: Now, you have been around long enough to know that you can't<br />
jump ahead like that and get me to answer what is likely to be a<br />
Cabinet decision.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on your damaging incidents, presumably..<br />
PIM: My damaging incidents?<br />
JOURNALIST: The incidents which you feel that perhaps leave thc,<br />
PM: That might have been seen.<br />
JOURNALIST: You are presumably referring things like the MX<br />
matter and tertiary fees decisions. How can you guarantee that<br />
now that these sorts of incidents have started that they won't be<br />
repeated in the future?<br />
PM: Well I think that one operates first of all from the basis<br />
that people who have been involved in certain circumstances in<br />
reacting in particular ways look at the results of their actions<br />
and the reactions and I am simply making the judgement, that I<br />
think is~ particularly well founded, that we will not see any<br />
circumstance arising which will be capable of a misperception<br />
about the fact, which has always been the fact, that the<br />
Government is firmly in control of economic policy and that the<br />
basic framework, which I set down in the election campaign will be<br />
adhered to. And I remind all the people who are viewing and who<br />
are going to read your written words, that I think it is true to<br />
say that there is no government in the western world which has<br />
imposed upon itself such a stringent framework of economic policy<br />
and we are entitled to be believed, on the basis of our<br />
performance over two years, we are entitled to be believed that we<br />
will adhere to it, because we will adhere to it, we have shown<br />
that we are prepared to take the range of decisions in the<br />
economic field which are necessary to produce beneficial economic<br />
results. And it would be an exercise in stupidity for the </p>
<p>government, having achieved those resulits, which in-many respects<br />
are the envy of. most of the res.. of the world, to suddenly depart<br />
from that stringent approach. We don't ii~ tenJ to.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke do you now foresee the Reserve Bank playing<br />
a larger role in monetary policy than one of bimply smoothing out<br />
fluctuations.<br />
PM: I don't think you seriously expect me to speculate on what<br />
the role of the Reserve Bank will be in the future.<br />
JOURNALIST: But you said last night that it had played..<br />
PM: I answered a question yesterday in respect of what had<br />
happened, what was my observation about what had happened. I say<br />
you don't seriously expect me to talk about the future role of our<br />
central banking institution. And I am not going to.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister would the Government ever consider<br />
going to the Arbitration Commission<br />
PM: I'm sorry.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would the Government consider going to the next<br />
national wage case and arguing that full indexation increase<br />
should be discounted to<br />
PM: I have addressed that question several times in the past, I<br />
suggest that you look at the transcript of the number of answers I<br />
have given that, you will see what our position is on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could you tell me what that was.<br />
PM: No I suggest that you do your own reading, I mean I've<br />
answered the questions specifically on a number of occasions and I<br />
am not here to do your homework for you.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you had any discussions with any representatives<br />
of the ACTU about your latest views on productivity.<br />
I have spoken with Mr Crean.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you give us any indication of his response, we<br />
are having trouble getting Mr Crean too.<br />
PM: I'm here to do your telephone work for you.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the question of Bang<br />
PM: On the question of Bang.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Bang.<br />
PM: Oh, well. Lets say that we know that we are talking about<br />
a.~ </p>
<p>the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China Hu Yaobang,<br />
yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: The same bloke who was reported in the press this<br />
morning.. PM: Hey this is getting very chummy. This is an indication of<br />
w-hat he is to expect at the Press Club on Tuesday is it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you be seeking clarification of his reported<br />
remarks that American Warships will be welcome in Chinese ports<br />
and about the nuclear weaponary.<br />
PM: Well I think the matter may come up in general discussion, I<br />
mean. I haven't pencilled it down on my agenda, but I think it may<br />
arise in our discussion.<br />
JOURNALIST: What would your view be.<br />
PM: I think my view in respect of what happens between China and<br />
the United States if I seek to express a view about relations<br />
between China and the United States is something that I would<br />
convey to Hu Yaobang.<br />
JOURNALIST: Hnw' detailed will be the May economic statement if it<br />
goes ahead. Will it just be on expenditure cuts, or are you<br />
planning to make other economic announcements?<br />
PM: Whenever any statement is made right before the budget in the<br />
expenditure, it would be in the expenditure area, in other words<br />
it is not going to be a mini-budget covering the whole range of<br />
issues that would normally be in budget. But I believe that it<br />
would be appropriate to make some of our announcements in the<br />
expenditure area early, and if for no other reason that of course<br />
you then get the full yeair benefit of the effect of those cuts.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it appropriate to consider family allowances in<br />
this expenditure review process or because of their tax<br />
imp) lications would they be a question left for the summit?<br />
PM: I couldn't answer that at this stage because we haven't<br />
considered that issue. And I am not going to by some answer now<br />
pre-empt consideration of the expenditure review commitee and the<br />
Cabinet on that. But you are right in referring to the<br />
implications in the tax area, but I'm simply not in a position to<br />
give you an answer on that because we just haven't gone to it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just fudging on Prime Minister..<br />
PM: Just fudging on, just sneeking one more.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you tell us your opinion of the program you </p>
<p>appeared on last nijht.<br />
PM: I didn't seit.<br />
JOURNALIST: How was the program.<br />
PM: Oh the program generally rather than my support.<br />
JOURNALIST: Your appearance was wonderful.<br />
PM: Thank you, thank you you are entitled -to extra questions when<br />
you ask questions on that basis.<br />
PM: Let me say there is considerable room for improvement, I did<br />
say to the interviewer who was equally excellent if I may be<br />
gratuitous as you. I did say that if there were more segments<br />
like that then the hope for the program would be enhanced.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would there be hopes for more ABC money in the Budget<br />
do you think.<br />
PM: You're a trier son, your a trier. </p>
