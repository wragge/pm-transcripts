    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth and Western Australian Governments today signed an agreement to establish a National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) trial site in Western Australia from 1 July 2014.</p>
<p>A trial site for the NDIS will be established in the Perth Hills area, alongside a trial site for Western Australiaâs My Way scheme in the Lower South West region and Cockburn/Kwinana regions.</p>
<p>These trial sites are crucial to the National Disability Insurance Agencyâs ability to ensure the scheme is built on strong foundations and key lessons from the trials are taken on board.</p>
<p>Around 8,400 Western Australians with disability will benefit from the two trials and even more will benefit from the full rollout of the NDIS.</p>
<p>The trial sites in Perth are key milestones in the continued national rollout of the NDIS.</p>
<p>People with disability and their families should be able to access the NDIS and its benefits regardless of where they live.</p>
<p>The Perth trials will be independently evaluated by a Joint Steering Committee comprising representatives from the Commonwealth and Western Australian Governments and community representatives from the trial sites.</p>
