_ Goverm-ent would implement if returned to office after<br />
18 October, were a continuation of Australia's substantial<br />
long-term support for Papua tow Guinea's developrent.-As--with--<br />
the 1976 aid arrangement, the new five-year coZnitmet would<br />
enable the Papua New Guinea Government to pursue its economic<br />
and social development policies with advance knowledge of the<br />
r1e ources available to it from Australia while also meeting<br />
Papua New Guinea's objective of increasing selfremliance<br />
through a gradual decline in Australian aid in real terms.<br />
