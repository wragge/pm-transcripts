PRIME MINISTER THURSDAY 1* 5 NOVEMBER 1979<br />
From the Press Office SUMMARY OF ABC's* NEWSVOICE<br />
The Federal opposition has called for the resignation of three<br />
ministers over their handling of the alleged Social Security<br />
fraud by more than 100 people. Mr. Bowen called for the<br />
resignations of Senator Guilfoyle, Senator Durack and Mr. McLeay.<br />
The call accompanies a demand for a judicial enquiry into the<br />
handling of investigations. Peter George reports: Today's<br />
attack in Question Time began in the Senate and the House of<br />
Representatives. Senator Durack admitted that it was apparently<br />
unprecedented for a police informer to be granted a pardon and<br />
to be paid a reward for information. He was referring to a<br />
pardon granted Mr. Nakos in 1977 for any illegal acts in the<br />
alleged fraud and to negotiations with the Commonwealth Police<br />
for a reward of up to $ 200,000 on completion of a successful<br />
prosecution. Senator Durack said his Department was unaware<br />
that Mr. Nakos was the same man with whom the reward negotiations<br />
were being conducted. -He expressed his concern of the matter<br />
and said he woul~ d pursue it tomorrow. In answer to further<br />
questions Senator Guilfoyle read a letter from her Department<br />
Head, Mr. Lanigan. Broadly he denies involvement in the<br />
negotiations on the reward but he does say a Department officer<br />
did find out in 1977 that a figure of up to $ 30,000 might be<br />
available through the Department of Finance with the approval<br />
of the Treasurer. Later when the larger figure was suggested<br />
Mr. Lanigan said he feared a confidence trick and that lives of<br />
officers might be endangered if they became improperly involved<br />
in the negotiations. Senator Guilfoyle said Mr. Lanigan recalled<br />
mentioning a reward to her but she had no recollection of it and<br />
Mr. Lanigan agreed she would never have approved a reward-payment.<br />
In the House, Mr. McLeay was subject to questioning by Mr. Bowen<br />
or, the alleged use of phone tapping in the investigation. Mr.<br />
McLeay replied that there was a grey area developing on what<br />
was a phone tap and what was a ' listening device' and he would<br />
not become involved in questions of law. Then this afternoon<br />
Mr. Bowen made the call for the three ministers resignation,<br />
claiming they had failed in their ministerial responsibilities<br />
and he explained why to Duncan Fairweather.<br />
Mr. Bowen:<br />
The first gave untrue information to Parliament and then<br />
made the excuse she did not know that Senator Guilfoyle. ( sic)<br />
The second one appears'to be Senator Durack who said he didn't<br />
know to whom he had given the pardon. I would have thought<br />
you would have been able to at least find out to whom you gave<br />
a pardon, and on what basis, particularly when you are the chief<br />
law officer in Australia and the third one is Mr. McLeay, the<br />
Minister in charge of the police, who said he doesn't know what<br />
the law is and accordingly he really doesn't care whether his<br />
officers act in accordance with the law or not. It is a<br />
ministerial responsibility to Parliament. It means that minister's<br />
can't rely on answers that they don't know or they are ignorant<br />
of the situation, whether it be facts or law. They are accountable<br />
to their Departments, they are accountable to the people of<br />
Australia. If they don't perform they should be dismissed. .2 </p>
<p>The Commonwealth Police Officer in charge of-investigating the<br />
alleged Greek Conspiracy case, Detective Chief Inspector<br />
Donald Thomas, said in court in Sydney today, that Federal<br />
Cabinet would be the final arbiter on the amount of payment to<br />
be made to the police informant, Mr. Nakos.<br />
Under cross examination Chief Inspector Thomas said Cabinet<br />
would consider the value of Nakos' evidence at completion of all<br />
court proceedings. He said Cabinet would make a realistic<br />
appraisal of Nakos' contribution whether or not the Crown was<br />
successful in obtaining convictions. Thomas said one of the<br />
criteria for the then Commonwealth Police Commissioner's approval<br />
in principal, that a payment of $ 200,000 could well be a proper<br />
amount, taking all relevant considerations into account, was<br />
contained in the letter written by Nakos' solicitor. In the<br />
letter his solicitor wrote that the amount was .76% of what the<br />
Commonwealth would save over ten years if the fraud would stop.<br />
Thomas said any notes he had even taken of conversations between<br />
himself and Nakos had been destroyed. He said he did not want<br />
to risk revealing the informant's identity to anyone, not even<br />
Commonwealth Government officers. The Crown Prosecutor told<br />
the court earlier today that an application had been made to have<br />
Nakos recalled to give further evidence. Nakos would not be<br />
recalled until after the Christmas break. Susan Curran: Sydney.<br />
A full bench of tL-he Arbitration-Commission today granted 26,000<br />
Telecom workers, wage rises which for most workers mean an<br />
increase of between $ 117 $ 12 a week. The increasesranging from<br />
$ 7.50 to $ 20 a week were backdated to 17 July and will apply<br />
for 17 months. The Telecom workers had asked for rises of at<br />
least $ 27 a week for tradesmen. After the decision the Federal<br />
Secretary of the Australian Telecommunications Employees<br />
Association said he was disgusted and there was a distinct<br />
possibility that his members would take further industrial action.<br />
Interviewed. The stand-off between the United States and Iran continues amid<br />
intensive diplomatic activity at the United Nations and speculation<br />
that the deposed Shah may be well enough to leave the United States<br />
in ten days. In earlier developments Iran announced that it was<br />
withdrawing billions of dollars in foreign currency reserves<br />
from American banks and President Carter countered by saying that<br />
he was freezing Iranian assets and declaring the crisis a<br />
national emergency. Ian Maclntoch from New York: After a day<br />
of discussion the 15 members of the United Nations Security Council<br />
has yet to announce their decision on Iran's request for an urgent<br />
meeting to hear grievances against the United States. Further<br />
consultations are expected tomorrow but informed sources at the<br />
United Nations still expect the Council to reject the Iranian<br />
request or defer any such session until after the hostages at the<br />
American Embassy in Teheran are released. While Iran continues<br />
to demand the extradition of the deposed Shah and the United States<br />
refuses to negotiate until the hostages are freed it is<br />
understood that the Security Council members including the Soviet<br />
Union, China and non-aligned countries are in basic agreement with<br />
the American contention that they should not hear Iran's views<br />
whilst the hostages are being held. But it is not known why if<br />
such a concensus exists a formal announcement to that affect has<br />
yet to be made. 3 </p>

Senator Martin and Senator Ryan accompanied a United States<br />
delegation to Kampuchea and returned today. Senator Ryan<br />
was ill on the flight home but Senator Martin spoke to a reporter<br />
in Canberra about what she described as the incredible suffering<br />
and hardship she saw. Senator Martin said she would ask<br />
Australians to give money to the aid agencies as it is being<br />
very well used.<br />
A big clean up is underway in areas of South Australia hit by<br />
wild storms which caused millions of dollars of damage late<br />
yesterday and last night. In the worst hit township Port<br />
Broughton an estimated 300 holiday shacks were smashed by the<br />
wind and another 200 damaged. Ten people needed hospital<br />
treatment for severe cuts and another 60 suffered minor injuries.<br />
Another big mergure has been proposed between two leading<br />
Australian companies. Brambles Industries Ltd. is to join<br />
forces with the building supplies company, Acmil Ltd. The<br />
mergure involves a share swap arrangement in which Brambles will<br />
offer two of its shares plus 20 cents cash for every two shares<br />
in Acmil. At current market prices the offer values Acmil at<br />
$ 143 million, the biggest offer for an Australian industrialbased<br />
company. </p>
