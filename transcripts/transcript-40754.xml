    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Turnbull Government has reaffirmed its strong commitment to energy security by providing $54 million from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) to support a large-scale solar development with the potential for pumped hydro storage. </p>
<p>Developing storage technology for renewables is important for stabilising the grid as electricity can still be used when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing.</p>
<p>The solar development will take place at Genex Power’s Kidston Renewable Energy Hub, 270km north-west of Townsville.</p>
<p>The Australian Renewable Energy Agency has provided $4 million for a study into the next phase, a 250 MW pumped hydro-storage project.</p>
<p>Co-locating a large-scale solar farm with a large-scale pumped hydro storage project will be an Australian first.</p>
<p>At the Turnbull Government’s request, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and the CEFC, agreed to work together on a priority new funding round for large-scale storage and other flexible capacity projects including pumped hydro.  </p>
<p>The Coalition Government has already spent or committed more than $220 million in funding for a suite of energy storage projects across the country.</p>
<p>Now, more than ever, we have to ensure that renewable energy is being properly integrated into the grid following a series of blackouts in South Australia.</p>
<p>Unlike the Labor Party we are taking a technology neutral approach to energy security and affordability and realise the importance of developing and mobilising storage technology to deal with the challenges of intermittency posed by renewables.</p>
<p>Only the Coalition can be trusted to deliver energy security and affordability as we transition to a lower emissions future.</p>
