PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP PARLIAMENT HOUSE, TUESDAY 1 APRIL 1986<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister when will Cabinet make a decision on<br />
the star wars research......<br />
PM: When we get a submission on it.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's your view?<br />
PM: I haven't got a view until we get the submission.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you agree with John Button?<br />
PM: You heard what I said.<br />
JOURNALIST: Should Senator Button have made the comments that he<br />
did? PM: We don't try and impose curfews on people, like that. I<br />
think that it was just a very brief observation he made and the<br />
matter will be properly considered when it comes before Cabinet.<br />
It's been some time, as you know, since we had the letter from<br />
Secretary of Defence Weinberger. We're not in any great hurry<br />
about this matter and we're certainly not going to be cascaded<br />
into a decision because of one observation.<br />
JOURNALIST: What do you think is the possibility of Australian<br />
companies becoming involved in star wars research?<br />
PM: I've got no comment to make on the matter before Cabinet's<br />
considered it.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's your view of Gerry Hand's comment that it<br />
looks like the MX issue all over again?<br />
PM:: I've got no comment on Gerry's comment.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will Caucus be consulted before or after the Cabinet<br />
decision, Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: The normal processes will be followed. I don't think<br />
there's anything to worry about.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister do you agree with the thrust of the<br />
statements in the EPAC report?<br />
PM: About the need for expenditure restraint, I think we've been<br />
on that particular platform before they were. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Sir, are you worried about Mr Howe's comments at the<br />
broad left conference.<br />
PM: No not particularly. I haven't had the opportunity of<br />
reading the full text of what he had to say. I'd like to have a<br />
look at that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you worried about your ministers criticising<br />
Government policy<br />
PM: Well as Mr Howe is reported as saying, he wasn't attacking<br />
the Government, or criticising the Government and so if he says<br />
that I guess he means it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you believe that?<br />
PM: Well I couldn't imagine he'd say something he didn't<br />
believe. JOURNALIST: It's not because it's April the first then?<br />
PM: No, no. I'm fully conscious of the date Laurie.<br />
JOURNALIST: Should Mr Howe be so outspoken, do you think?<br />
PM: Well as I say I'd like to have a look at his text. I think<br />
he's entitled to me reading the full text before I make any<br />
observations on the basis of newspaper reports. Not that you<br />
people don't always get it 100 per cent accurate.<br />
JOURNALIST: He made the speech last Friday.<br />
PM: Yes, well you may have a different sense of priorities for<br />
the use of my time than I have.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you expect to give Mr Weinberger a final decision<br />
in relation to the invitation next week?<br />
PM: I don't know. I wouldn't expect that our timing will be<br />
determined by his presence. It will be determined by the time<br />
which the ministers involved need to take in considering this<br />
matter. JOURNALIST: Prime minister are you going to revert to ! the idea<br />
of having a weekly press conference?<br />
PM: I'm at your disposal. You know that. It was there. You<br />
didn't always want it every week. I don't think we need, as much<br />
as we enjoy one another's company, necessarily to meet every<br />
week. JOURNALIST: I think we enjoy yours more than you enjoy ours.<br />
PM: Well you see you might be wrong again. I think you're all<br />
lovely. Well most of you.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would it be better for you to have a weekly press<br />
conference, rather than for us to doorstop you? </p>
<p>PM: Well it's really up to you. I'm your humble servant, just<br />
whichever way you'd like it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well it takes up a lot of our time if we have to<br />
doorstop you. It would be very helpful if you had a weekly<br />
press conference.<br />
PM: Does it? It's nice in weather like this though isn't it?<br />
JOURNALIST: Oh not too bad. Do you think perhaps you could<br />
revert to that?<br />
PM: Well we'll see.<br />
ends I </p>
