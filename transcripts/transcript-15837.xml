    <content><![CDATA[<p>Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Treasurer Wayne Swan and Employment Participation Minister Brendan O'Connor today released a road map for the reform of vocational education and training.</p>
<p>The Skilling Australia discussion paper launched today sets out the delivery of the Rudd Labor Government's additional 450,000 training places.</p>
<p>It highlights a new industry demand driven approach to training delivery rather than the old supply driven approaches of the Howard Government.</p>
<p>Close consultation with business is a key component of our efforts to build a world class training system and a modern economy that delivers for Australian families.</p>
<p>The new demand driven approach will better match up training to the needs of industry  -  finally providing businesses with a solution to on-going problems with skill shortages.</p>
<p>It will work with businesses to identify their needs and tailor training to address skill gaps in the workforce.</p>
<p>The independent Skills Australia advisory body and strengthened Industry Skills Councils will be central to the new demand driven reforms.</p>
<p>Combined with new targets to halve the proportion of Australians aged 24 to 64 years without qualifications at Certificate Level III and above and double the number of higher qualification completions (diploma and advanced diploma) by 2020, the reforms will also lead to better jobs for working Australians.</p>
<p>The roll-out of the first 20,000 training places also begins today with the initial batch of contracts to be delivered to registered training organisations who will provide the training.</p>
<p>Unemployed people will benefit from this first batch of training places and could be in the workforce as early as June.</p>
<p>Registered Training Organisations have shown strong support for the scheme which will provide much needed skills to those looking to work in occupations currently in severe shortage.</p>
<p>Industries such as childcare, building and construction and the mining industry are currently facing a chronic shortage of skilled workers.</p>
<p>This next roll- out of training places will give Australians currently in the workforce the opportunity to gain formal training and accreditation, helping to address skill shortages and boost Australia's productivity levels.</p>
<p>Submissions commenting on the discussion paper close 30 April 2008.</p>
