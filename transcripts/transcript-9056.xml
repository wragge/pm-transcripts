PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH FRAN KELLY, ABC AM PROGRAM<br />
26 NOVEMBER 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
FK: Prime Minister, this latest account from Conrad Black makes you look<br />
bad, doesn't it?<br />
PM: No, it doesn't at all. The 35 per cent that he mentioned was mentioned in<br />
the meeting, but mentioned by him. And as you made quite obviously<br />
clear in the conversation with Dr Hewson, the Government then<br />
considered this, that conversation took place in 1992. In April 1993 the<br />
Treasurer put a statement out saying the Government had considered Mr<br />
Blacks requests, the Government agreed to the Telegraph increasing its<br />
share holding in Fairfax among the 15 per cent to 25 per cent, and he<br />
finished it with a sentence saying the Government will not countenance<br />
further increases in the permitted level of foreign involvement in mass<br />
circulation newspapers.<br />
FK: You confirmed last week in Seattle that it was 25 per cent ownership you<br />
had been discussing as relying on balanced coverage. Mr Black now<br />
says that condition was applied to consideration of 35 per cent.<br />
PM: Mr Black wants to buy up-to-4OO.. per-cen4-, up-to--00 -per-cent of John<br />
Fairfax and Sons.<br />
FK: He said that you said you might be disposed to consider such an<br />
application if there was evidence that the company was encouraging<br />
professiona4 -standards.<br />
PM: That is not right, and as a consequence what proves it not to be right was<br />
four months later when the Government considered this it said 25 per cent<br />
and no more. But let's make this very clear, Mr Black does want to own<br />
majority control of John Fairfax and Sons, and that's what he told me the<br />
Leader of the Opposition had promised him. He said on the Sunday<br />
program, Business Sunday, a week or two ago, he said, " I wrote in my<br />
book about Dr Hewson's position which was that this was not an issue<br />
with him, and he in an agreed phraseology" that's where he and Hewson </p>
<p>had agreed to what to say " was very relaxed about our level of<br />
ownership would be, in the event that he won the election". In other<br />
words, Hewson said to him, " you can have control, I am very relaxed<br />
about the level, I won't nominate any particular level, you buy what you<br />
want."<br />
FK: That's not the same as saying Dr Hewson said he would 100 per cent.<br />
Mr Black said himself that no ceiling was ever mentioned by Dr Hewson.<br />
PM: The ceiling is not the point, it is control. " I wrote in my book that this was<br />
not an issue with him, " in other words it was not an issue that John Fairfax<br />
and Sons newspapers, The Age, Sydney Morning Herald, The Financial<br />
Review, should pass to the control of a foreign person. Now, the<br />
Government wouldn't let it pass to the control of a foreign person, John<br />
Hewson was going to let it pass the control of a foreign person by going<br />
beyond 50 per cent which gave Mr Black a majority of the stock. And<br />
then, with all the hypocrisy in the world, John Hewson is on your program<br />
this morning and running around radios and television a week ago talking<br />
about me when the Government has had a Cabinet discussion, decided<br />
on 25 per cent, put out a statement saying no more then 25 per cent, he<br />
has offered 50 per cent up to 100 per cent, unlimited, and now he is<br />
backsliding on a Senate Committee because he knows if he goes he will<br />
need to purjure himself when questioned under oath about whether he<br />
offered control of John Fairfax and Sons to Conrad Black.<br />
FK: Aren't you going too far though, by saying that he has offered 50 per cent,<br />
100 per cent, unlimited, when in fact both Dr Hewson and Conrad Black<br />
agree that no ceiling was ever mentioned in their conversations. No<br />
percentage at all.<br />
PM: The percentage was clear control, do you understand? He was saying it<br />
was not an issue with him, and he says today in his letter, Mr Black, that<br />
the Opposition had not expressed a preference for any specific ceiling on<br />
such ownership. In other words, no limit. Do you understand the<br />
connotation of no limit?<br />
FK: Well John Hewson has called you an unmitigated liar. And isn't it true<br />
that you have said that you would consider 25 per cent, Conrad Black<br />
now, today says, you promised to support 25 per cent. That is quite a<br />
difference, isn't it? Promise to considering, or promising to support.<br />
PM: liar on a dozen times every day. He has got no control of himself on<br />
radio, in the Parliament, anywhere else. One of the things he said was,<br />
we lied about the tax cuts. They were delivered last week. People got<br />
their tax cuts last week. He will go on radio and say anything. Look, let<br />
me just make this clear, Mr Black mentioned 35 per cent, he mentioned<br />
control of John Fairfax and Son which is over 50 per cent, and he told me<br />
that he could buy up to 100 per cent on the say-so, with the agreement of </p>
<p>John Hewson, but he didn't need 100 per cent, something over 50 per<br />
cent would be enough for him.<br />
FK Conrad Black told you that?<br />
PM: He told me that.<br />
FK Prime Minister, can I just clear this one thing up? Did you say to Conrad<br />
Black that you would consider 25 per cent, or as he says did you say you<br />
would promise to support it?<br />
PM: Meetings with Mr Black, Mr Black wants to get control of John Fairfax and<br />
Sons, he swans into Australia about every three months and each time he<br />
comes, every three or four months he seeks to see me and no doubt he<br />
seeks to see the Leader of the Opposition and other people. And all the<br />
game is about is whether he can lift his limits above 50 per cent, so that<br />
he can control of John Fairfax and Sons. Now, I made it quite clear, I said<br />
look, Mr Black, just understand this, that where you're from in Canada the<br />
interests of Canada strategically are covered largely by the plurality of the<br />
United States, and the general side for the US population and its<br />
defences and foreign affairs and strategic interests. This is not true of<br />
Australia. Australia doesn't have 230 million people bordering it. Its<br />
broadsheet newspapers must keep a peculiarly Australian attitude. They<br />
must be controlled by Australians. And that's why he always stumbles<br />
with me, because I said to him you're a Canadian who lives in London,<br />
you are not an Australian, and the Government is not going to pass<br />
control of John Fairfax and Sons to you. John Hewson couldn't care less<br />
about Australia's national interests. You have got to go back to these<br />
months just before the last election, the arrogance with which Dr Hewson<br />
was strutting around the Sydney business community and all of the high<br />
spots of Sydney and Melbourne saying he had the election in the bag.<br />
Black came in to see him: look don't worry, we don't have any hangups<br />
about levels of ownership, we don't have this economic nationalism<br />
nonsense which the Labor Party goes on about, we are very relaxed<br />
about. what level you want,.. there. is . no. particular. ceiling from us, tell us<br />
what you want, you can have it.<br />
FK With all due respect, Prime Minister, isn't the issue now for you and<br />
people of Australia and your Caucus whether you promised Conrad Black<br />
to support him in his bid for. 25 per cent promised that support and then<br />
indicated that you would then later consider 35 per cent.<br />
PM:. Let me just put the hypothetical. If you were right, I broke the promise,<br />
didn't I? Because when the statement came out in April, on April the<br />
it was 25 per cent, after a full Cabinet discussion. The fact is I never told<br />
Conrad Black that I would consider his 35 per cent, he wanted 35 per<br />
cent, he wanted 50 per cent, he wants 50 per cent plus, he wants<br />
wantever number gives him complete certainty, and he particularly wanted<br />
them because he thought John Fairfax and Sons were cheap. Now, the </p>
<p>fact is the Government has considered this, the real issue is this, will Dr<br />
Hewson now appear before the inquiry which he has fostered by the<br />
Liberals in the Senate, because the Democrats want to write a line into<br />
the terms of reference that the questions about my discussions with Mr<br />
Black should also be questioned about the Leader of the Opposition<br />
discussions with Mr Black. Now, when you put that question to him, he<br />
says he wasn't debating these things, it was done by somebody else.<br />
What you will find is, if Dr Hewson mentions, in the terms of reference by<br />
the Democrats, which he should be, he won't appear. And he won't<br />
appear because he knows that under oath Mr Black is going to testify that<br />
Dr Hewson was prepared to pass control of John Fairfax and Sons to him,<br />
and Dr Hewson will either have to purjure himself or confirm the fact that<br />
he was prepared to pass the control of John Fairfax and Sons over to<br />
Conrad Blacks telegraph interests. Now, key question.<br />
FK: PM, just briefly on another matter, will you apologise to Malaysian Prime<br />
Minister, Dr Mahatir?<br />
PM: Don't ask me these things. Can I just say, on the program yesterday you<br />
also had Kerry Stokes on there. There was a question put to him, I don't<br />
know whether it was by you it said Conrad Black said Mr Keating has not<br />
compromised the integrity of his office. Do you agree with that<br />
assessment? He said: I certainly do not in other words, he's suggesting I<br />
compromised the integrity of my office. Look, the Leader of the Opposition<br />
uses the word ' liar' about 100 times every day. I let him run his silly race.<br />
But Mr Stokes is a different person, he's got a very big and loose mouth<br />
and let me use your program to tell him I'll put a very big writ in it, if he<br />
keeps speaking in these terms. The Government acted with complete<br />
probity on this. It was considered by the full Cabinet on a submission by<br />
the Treasurer, and a decision was announced and it was announced with<br />
the line: the Govt will not countenance further increases in the permitted<br />
level of foreign involvement in mass circulation newspapers. Let me make<br />
quite clear again, I believe that the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age in<br />
particular are the premier broadsheets in this. country and I don't believe<br />
they should be majority foreign-owned. That's the difference between<br />
John Hewson and me he believes they should. Basically in a<br />
conversation where he didn't give a tinker's cuss for Australia's national<br />
interests, he decided simply to slip them away to Black because he<br />
thought it would shore him up in the election campaign.<br />
