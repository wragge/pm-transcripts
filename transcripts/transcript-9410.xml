STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 8 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
THE DEFENCE WHITE PAPER<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
The White Paper on defence which is being presented in this chamber sets<br />
out a framework for developing Australian defence policy over the next<br />
decade, and for making force structure and capability decisions which will<br />
shape our defence force well into the next century.<br />
All Australian Governments have a core responsibility to defend this country.<br />
Uniquely among the nations of the world, we have a continent of our own to<br />
protect. In defence terms, this gives us some real advantages, not least the moat<br />
around us. But it also imposes enormous responsibilities. The way we meet<br />
those responsibilities is in a very real sense a measure of our sense of our<br />
nationhood. Defending Australia is a substantial document, and I congratulate the Minister<br />
and those officials and members of the Defence Force who were involved in<br />
its preparation.<br />
It is a document for this time a time of rapid change in the region and the<br />
world. A period of less obvious threat than the Cold War years, but of less<br />
certainty as well.<br />
The White Paper reflects that underlying strategic uncertainty. The rapid<br />
growth in the Asia-Pacific region and the changes in regional relationships<br />
confronts Australia with both opportunities and challenges in its defence<br />
planning For example, the very fluidity of the post-Cold War world gives us an<br />
opportunity for the first time to build 6p organisations like APEC and the </p>
<p>ASEAN Regional Forum. But that same fluidity makes it even more important<br />
that we succeed.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
The White Paper therefore reflects this Government's strong determination to<br />
ensure that Australia maintains the most effective possible defence<br />
capability. Defendinq Australia sets out comprehensively how this will be done, and the<br />
details have been outlined in this House by my colleague, the Minister for<br />
Defence Science and Personnel.<br />
The Government will sustain defence spending at about two per cent of GOP,<br />
and for the first time ever we will institute a five-year defence budget<br />
commitment from 1996-97.<br />
At the core of Australian defence policy is self-reliance, by which we mean<br />
the capability to defend ourselves against any credible attack on Australia<br />
without relying on the combat forces of other countries.<br />
The White Paper's defence equipment decisions are all directed towards<br />
strengthening that self-reliant capability.<br />
These decisions include the purchase of airborne early warning and control<br />
aircraft, the replacement of the Macchi lead-in fighters, new transport<br />
aircraft, helicopters for the ANZAC frigates, minehunters; and improved<br />
command, control, communications and intelligence networks.<br />
We will also review the need for additional Collins class submarines in the<br />
context of our first five-year defence budget.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
Just over a year ago I attended the launch of the first of the Collins class<br />
submarines in Adelaide, and earlier this year I saw the launch of the first<br />
ANZAC frigate.<br />
Both programs are clear evidence of how Australian design, technology,<br />
construction techniques and workforce skills can excel against the best in the<br />
world. Collins is the most advanced conventionally powered submarine in the world<br />
a clear demonstration of this country's ability to produce world-class<br />
technology at competitive prices.<br />
I believe that by building up our national ship-building base through projects<br />
like these, and the coastal minehunters, we are also building up a capability<br />
that can be a real resource for co-operative programs with our neighbours. </p>
<p>And the capabilities of Australian industry are not limited to large-scale<br />
construction programs. We are also developing state-of-the-art skills in high<br />
technology areas such as weapons and sensors.<br />
The Jindalee Over-the-Horizon radar system and the NULKA active<br />
expendable decoy are both examples of the innovation and ingenuity of<br />
Australian defence science.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
The White Paper is about more than enhancing our defence self-reliance,<br />
however. Our security also depends on the extent to which we can improve our<br />
strategic environment, both by building bilateral regional defence<br />
relationships and working multilaterally to enhance regional and global<br />
security. The White Paper outlines how the Government is doing these things.<br />
Multilaterally, we continue to support the United Nations, both its preventative<br />
diplomacy and its peacekeeping operations.<br />
We do not structure the Australian Defence Force for such operations, but<br />
the ADF has shown that its force structure and readiness levels are sufficient<br />
to undertake United Nations tasks. Men and women from the ADF, as well as<br />
from the Australian Federal Police, have already served with distinction and<br />
effectiveness in many peacekeeping operations around the globe, and<br />
continue to do so today.<br />
Regionally, we have been working to build institutions which will provide a<br />
framework for co-operation in the very different environment we now face.<br />
APEC is one important development. Although it does not itself have a<br />
p6litical or security role, and Australia is not seeking this, APEC certainly has<br />
strategic benefits. By bringing both sides of the Asia-Pacific into a broad<br />
economic partnership it makes less likely the attenuation of security ties<br />
between the United States and its Asian allies as a result of trade frictions.<br />
Australia has also been a very active proponent and supporter of the ASEAN<br />
Regional Forum. When this group met for the first time in Bangkok injulythis<br />
year, it was the first time the countries of the region had sat down at the<br />
same table to discuss security issues.<br />
The Forum is still at a very early stage of its development, but we think it has<br />
the potential to help us deal more effectively with future problems or tensions<br />
in the region. </p>
<p>Mr Speaker,<br />
The strength and durability of our bilateral defence relationships with our<br />
neighbours has been critical in underpinning the growing regional consensus<br />
on security issues which in turn made the ASEAN Regional Forum possible.<br />
One of the key elements in the White Paper is the Government's commitment<br />
to strengthening defence links with the countries of the region to strategic<br />
partnership.<br />
The general approach outlined in the White Paper has been welcomed by our<br />
neighbours.<br />
A senior adviser to the Indonesian Defence Minister recently described<br />
Defending Australia as a ' watershed in the strategic outlook of Australia,'<br />
paving the way for a strategic partnership with Indonesia.<br />
I agree. And I agree with the Indonesian Defence Minister, General Edi<br />
Sudradjat, who said' a good relationship between Indonesia and Australia is<br />
not a matter of choice. It is a must.'<br />
In my view, that is true across the board, not just in the defence area.<br />
Earlier this year the Indonesian and Australian Defence Ministers agreed to<br />
hold annual meetings, and the potential exists to expand areas of practical<br />
co-operation between our military forces.<br />
We are also building our defence relationship with other neighbours in the<br />
Asia-Pacific.<br />
Singapore is already conducting air force and army training in Australia, and<br />
Prime Minister Goh and I have talked about other areas of defence cooperation.<br />
With Malaysia, too, we have a long and mutually rewarding defence<br />
relationship, both through the Five Power Defence Arrangements and<br />
bilaterally. In 1995, for the first time, regional countries will participate in our major<br />
military exercise, Kangaroo.<br />
And the White Paper underlines the continuing importance of our defence<br />
alliance with New Zealand, involving mutual commitment by each country to<br />
the security of the other. </p>
<p>Mr Speaker,<br />
Some commentators have seen a tension in the two objectives of defence<br />
self-reliance and greater strategic engagement with the countries around us.<br />
But no such tension exists.<br />
In defence policy no less than in other areas of Australia's engagement with<br />
Asia, our efforts to improve our own capacities as a nation and our ability to<br />
operate successfully in the region are two sides of the same coin.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
The security and stability of Asia will be increasingly determined by the<br />
policies and activities of countries in the region.<br />
But in the Government's view, this cannot, and will not, be achieved without<br />
the continued and constructive engagement of the United States, which<br />
remains the world's largest economy, Asia's largest single trading partner,<br />
and the world's most capable military power.<br />
This Government believes that continued engagement by the United States in<br />
the Asia-Pacific through its network of alliances around the Western Pacific is<br />
important to regional stability and security. As I said earlier, our concern<br />
about the consequences for strategic links across the Pacific of any increase<br />
in trade and economic friction is one of the reasons we think APEC is such a<br />
good economic model for the region.<br />
But the United States alliance is important for reasons much more particular<br />
to Australia. Although we do not rely on the United States for the defence of<br />
Australia, the deterrent effect of the alliance to any possible enemy makes a<br />
central contribution to our national security. And it also provides Australia<br />
with very important access to intelligence and technology.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
The White Paper underlines the importance not just of equipment and the<br />
strategic environment, but of our people.<br />
That is exactly as it should be, because the highly trained and highly<br />
motivated men and women of our defence force are the key to the ADF's<br />
capabilities. And in the new environment our capabilities will depend more<br />
and more on the human factor better commanders, higher levels of skill,<br />
more individual initiative and more effective teamwork.<br />
I was very proud earlier in the year to be able to farewell in Townsville some<br />
of the Australian forces going off to Rwanda to serve with the United Nations<br />
mission there. </p>
<p>6<br />
The men and women at the airport were on their way to conditions which very<br />
few Australians have experienced, and many would find difficult to imagine.<br />
But the enthusiasm and morale of the troops, as well as their obvious high<br />
level of competence was very evident. It reflected very well on them and on<br />
those who recruited and trained them. And it has been reflected, too, in their<br />
performance since they arrived in Rwanda, as their colleagues have shown<br />
earlier in Somalia and Cambodia and elsewhere.<br />
The Government understands that military life continues to place particular<br />
and difficult demands on those who serve in the ADF and on their families.<br />
So the Government will provide Australian Defence Force personnel with a<br />
package of pay, conditions of service and other benefits, including housing,<br />
designed specifically to address the special features of military service.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
Defending Australia also includes the most comprehensive and significant<br />
statement on reserves ever made by an Australian Government.<br />
The reserves are important indeed they are an integral and essential part of<br />
the force structure comprising more than one-third of the uniformed strength<br />
of the ADF.<br />
As the White Paper makes clear, the reserves are no longer just a back up to<br />
the regular forces, or an expansion base, but with the regular forces, form a<br />
total force in which all elements work together in a coordinated and<br />
complementary effort. That is an important change in the structure of the<br />
ADF. Mr Speaker,<br />
National security depends on more than the capacity of our defence force. It<br />
depends on the strength of our economy; the cohesiveness of our society; the<br />
effectiveness of our national institutions, the unity, sense of purpose and<br />
confidence of our people.<br />
' Defending Australia' is, therefore, closely related to other government<br />
policies. The White Paper on Employment and Training, ' Working Nation',<br />
and the Cultural Statement, ' Creative Nation', and no less-the development<br />
of APEC, have the same overall purpose of this Defence White Paper to<br />
strengthen the fabric and resolve of Australia, to enlarge our capacities and<br />
to create a more prosperous and secure future for our children.<br />
