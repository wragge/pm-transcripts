TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH MIKE CARLTO0N -2GB -24/ 1/ 86<br />
MIKE CARiLTON:<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE:<br />
CARLTON: Just when you think the economy is off anid<br />
runnIng smoothly in top gear along comes<br />
another spanner in the works.<br />
This time it's oil. There is In the world today<br />
too much oil about there's s. glut of the stuff<br />
and overseas the price of oil is dropping like a<br />
stone. That can be a mixed blessing for Australiat.<br />
It may reduce our Inflation rate that'r goodbut<br />
it may also coat the government hundreds<br />
of millions of dollars In lost revenue&amp; maybe<br />
maldng for a tight budget this year.<br />
There are other straws in the wind for the<br />
economy too come very good. some not so.<br />
For a look at them#, on the, line from Canberra<br />
this morning# the Prime Minister.<br />
Good morning.<br />
Good morning. Mike.<br />
Thanks for your time.<br />

PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Pleasur'e.<br />
CARLTON: PRIME MINISTER H-AWKE:<br />
CARLTON: PRIME MINISTER H* AWKE:<br />
CARLTON: Can you see the price of petrol dropping<br />
soon? Well. the next adjustment Is to be made on the<br />
list March, Mike, and on the way in which<br />
international price has been moving that's<br />
what would be required.<br />
You rightly say that that's a good thing in<br />
Itself. We have to look at the revenue<br />
implications. The relevant statistics roughly<br />
are, Mike, that the price of oil per barrel<br />
has to faU by about $ R-10 and be maintained<br />
at that, which is the sort of drop that's<br />
happened, as you know.<br />
That could cost us up to about $ 1.6 billion<br />
in revenue and if you lose that revenue and<br />
you want to provide and the people want<br />
the same level of services. well then you've<br />
got the difficulty that that creates.<br />
So we'll be looking at the situation In time<br />
for that March Adjustment.<br />
But you're absolutely spot-on In your analysis.<br />
It's a mixture of good news and bad news.<br />
But you do believe the price will come down?<br />
I think so, to some extent, yes.<br />
Can YOU put a figure on it, roughly? </p>

PRIME -MINISTER HAWKE:<br />
CARILTON:<br />
PRIME MINISTER J1AWXl(.;<br />
CARLTON~:<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWXEt I can't at this stage for two reasons. We<br />
don't know what will have happened to oil<br />
prices by the time we come to make the<br />
adjustment for the 1st March, and al80 as<br />
you appreciate, the Australian dollar to<br />
a combination of two things. The price<br />
which is made up of 80% of-. the spot price<br />
and 20% of the official price which to $ 28<br />
US a bar'rel, and what happens to the exchange<br />
rote. So it would be misleading to say at this<br />
stage, Mike, what the drop would be.<br />
On the plus side. the good side, that I guess<br />
would be good news for farmers particularly.<br />
also for small business. anyone who I guess<br />
freights goods about.<br />
Yes, sure.<br />
And the Inflation rate -could you see it<br />
easing that off?<br />
Obviously if you have the bort of drop In<br />
petrol prices that have been talked about<br />
that would go with that which Is of the order<br />
of 6 cents, somnething like 8 cents a litre.<br />
at that figure I mentioned before, that can<br />
mean about a half a per cent in the CPI.<br />
So yes. that can be quite significant If we' re<br />
In a position to be able to do that sort of<br />
thing. 1 24,01,86 10: 02 P. 03 </p>

CARLTON:<br />
PRIME~ MINISTER HAWKECARL-<br />
TON:<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: side if you wind up losing<br />
dollars in revenue that meant;<br />
tight budget this year, doesn't<br />
It does mean a tight budget and we're<br />
approaching a tight budgetary situation<br />
anyway, because we've got the commitments<br />
that you know of In regard to the deficit<br />
and the levels of government expenditures.<br />
so yes, it means a tough budget and we're<br />
going to have to make, as we have In the<br />
previous three years, the right mix of<br />
decisions which Is going to maximise growth<br />
at sustainable levels of Inflation.<br />
Can you still keep to the trilogy though?<br />
Yes.<br />
Without a doubt?<br />
We'll keep to the trilogy.<br />
It's going to make It very hard to deliver<br />
on those tax cuts though. Isn't it? You're<br />
going to have to count every cent.<br />
Well, this io the nature of economics though.<br />
Mike. I repeat, you were on the ball in<br />
your first comments that In this complex<br />
world in which we live there's hardly<br />
any significant economic variable which Is<br />
simply good or bad, It has its pluses and<br />
Its minuses and the success of this government<br />
has been in this three years In adjusting the<br />

we're going to be able to continue to<br />

PRIME MINISTER HAWKE:<br />
CARLTON:<br />
PRIME MINiSTER HAWKE:<br />
CARLTON: meet those<br />
a way<br />
I think<br />
do that.'<br />
Is it too ' early to put any sort of figure on a<br />
budget deficit next time around?<br />
Yes.<br />
AU right. I thought it might be. Again or%<br />
the brighter side, the Australian dollar Is<br />
rising again now. It closed at about 71.4 cents<br />
US New York. Do you expect that trend to<br />
continue? Again, just let me make this first point, Mik~ e.<br />
You say, " on the gobxI side". Yes, there are<br />
obviously good features of that.-You were<br />
talking about the farmers before. The farmers<br />
will say It's not pood news.<br />
As that rises that means a lowering in the<br />
Austratlian dollar result they get, so on balance<br />
we think that it's pood that the dollar is coming<br />
up to what we think is about getting towards<br />
its right level.<br />
Which would b~ e about what?<br />
W~ ell. you ask six economists you'll probably<br />
get six~ different answers. But T guess the<br />
range of opinion, Mike, Is of the order of<br />
12 to 75 * onto.<br />

i-n ri'ib UFFI Ub2 ? 32923 No.<br />
CARLTON:<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKEl:<br />
CARLTON: -a-<br />
I think that would be the sort of order that<br />
the Majority of economists would say is perhaps<br />
the appropriate level.<br />
In other words they're saying that when it<br />
went down to the 65 and 68 there'd been an<br />
over adjustment.<br />
But you'll get different answers, as I say. to<br />
just precisely what it should be.<br />
But you're right, in balance It's a good thing<br />
but I can't give you an answer as to how much<br />
that will keep going. I think the answer I've<br />
just given you about the general range of<br />
opinion probably Is relevant to your question.<br />
But the signs are better than they were, say.<br />
even a month ago?<br />
Yes, but -you'll remember that I've expressed<br />
confidence about what would happen because<br />
I have said consistently, as you'll recall, that<br />
the basic elements of Australia's economic<br />
policy have been found.<br />
I've kept saying that during the latter part<br />
of last year. I said because the economy was<br />
basically sound, doing better than most other<br />
western ecvonomies, I thought these other things<br />
would come Into place and that's whatte<br />
happening. The next, I suppose, variable if you like here<br />
we go again -is the exchange rate. Sorry, not </p>
<p>' 4, UuI, 6 iU: Ub P. 07 I-I J<br />
-7-<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE:<br />
CARLTON: PRIME MINISTER HAWKE:<br />
CARLTON: exchange rate interest rates. Can you see<br />
those maybe easing off in due course?<br />
Well, I must be careful in answering this,<br />
as you know, because a prime minister's<br />
statement or a treasurer's statement about<br />
their expectations In regard to Interest rates<br />
can of themselves have impacts you don't<br />
want to be trying to push markets.<br />
But let me say this, Mike I think it's the<br />
fair answer that with the increasing strength<br />
of the Australian dollar this was an essential<br />
element of the change In the pressures here<br />
and Internationrdly on interest rates.<br />
So the condition for a downward movement<br />
in interest rates has emerged.<br />
That may help get the farmers off your back<br />
again. Let me just quickly say this about the<br />
farmers. I don't have any feeling of upset<br />
about the expressions of concern by farmers<br />
because many of them are going through a<br />
very tough time. basically because of the<br />
corruption of international markets by the<br />
Europeans and now to some extent by our<br />
friends, the Americans.<br />
Just on another related topic, do you regret<br />
the shemozzle over the fertilizer business.<br />
the West Australian thing? </p>
<p>124,01,86 10: 06 P. 08<br />
PRIME MINISTER HIAWKE: No-Let me Make it quite clear, there's<br />
no ahemozzle except in the minds of what<br />
passes for an Opposition in this country.<br />
The position Is quite clear. At the beginning<br />
of this year the Cabinet processes weren't<br />
In operation and we weren't going to meet<br />
until the 20th January.<br />
I was approached by the Premier of Western<br />
Australia who had an election on and I've<br />
made no secret about the fact thatt within an<br />
election context he came, he said, " Look, we've<br />
got a problem -as a result of the imposition of<br />
that anti dumping duty".<br />
Cabinet was not going to be meeting till the<br />
so I got the two relevant ministers<br />
together and said, " There is a problem here,<br />
it's wider than Western Australia. We can<br />
deal with the whole problem when we get to<br />
Cabinet but we've got a real problem now in<br />
regards to Western Australia. Something ought<br />
to be done".<br />
We agreed to take a course of action there<br />
at the request of the West Australian Premier<br />
and on the clear understanding that the full<br />
Issue would be looked at by the Cabinet at the<br />
firet opportunity.<br />
CARLTON: But it was a wrong decision. wasn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: It was not a wrong decision, Indeed it's quite<br />
clear that what was being done was to give </p>
<p>I. 7<br />
CARLTON: PRIME MINISTIER HAWKE~: effect to anti dumping legislation which had<br />
been in there under our predecessors and<br />
which they'd administered In exactly the same<br />
way. You can't have a system whereby this country<br />
does not have protection against having goods<br />
dumped hero at Uncompetitive prices. You would<br />
destroy Australian Industry.<br />
So the decision wag not wrong. but what we had<br />
to do and would have done when the Cabinet<br />
met was to see what next step in action had to<br />
be taen M~ ike, to protect farmers particularly<br />
in this situation.<br />
So the steps were entirely logical to deal with<br />
the problem that was put to us In regard to<br />
Western Australia. at the first full Cabinet<br />
meeting to deal with the situation as a whole.<br />
That's what's been done and the decisions<br />
have been right.<br />
Laot question if I may, Prime Minister, and<br />
this is pretty general. I guess. but It is<br />
Australia Day coming up this weekend, a new<br />
year along with it.<br />
is it going~ to be a &amp; ood one? Do you feel a<br />
good year coming on in your bones, if you<br />
like? I feel a good year coming up. Milke. and<br />
basically for the reasons I put to you before. </p>
<p>PM.. PRESS OFF 062 732923 No. 1 24,01,86 10: 07<br />
t don't want to repeat them at length, but I<br />
say that the fundamentals of economic policy<br />
are sound. We are well ahead of our job<br />
creation programme, more than a half a million<br />
new jobs and the surge in employment is<br />
increasing. We give our commitment to the people of Australia<br />
on this Australia Day weekend that we'll keep<br />
sound economic policy in place so that we can<br />
create more and more jobs for Australians.<br />
CARLTON:-PRIME MINISTERI HAWKE:<br />
CARLTON: Prime Minister, thanks very much.<br />
Thank you, Mike.<br />
Bob Hawke there on the line. I said there<br />
from Canberra. He wasn't, he was from<br />
Tasmania. A small slip of the tongue there.<br />
On balance a healthy economic outlook.* but<br />
some fine tuning to be done and a tight<br />
budget coming up. There'll be not a cent<br />
to play with for the Treasurer Paul K~ eating<br />
and the Finance Minister, Peter Walsh.<br />
But it could be a bell of a lot worse.<br />
