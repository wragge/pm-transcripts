TRANSCRIPT OF THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER, THE HON KIM BEAZLEY<br />
MP, DOORSTOP, DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE, PERTH, 19 JULY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
KB: Well last night Mr Howard kept his promise to make no publication of his<br />
views on just about any serious policy matter confronting the nation,<br />
except one area. He did elaborate his position on industrial relations and<br />
what he effectively undertook, or promised, was to remove an essential<br />
underpinning to the wages and conditions of a very large number of<br />
Australians. There is no reason why this should be so, we have just had<br />
a set of figures come out on industrial disputation which shows it at just<br />
about its lowest level ever historically. We have a very high profit share.<br />
We have real productivity gains, some 25 per cent, over the last decade.<br />
A 40 per cent improvement in our international competitiveness. Ordinary<br />
working Australians do not deserve this uncertainty, this attack,<br />
effectively, on their lifestyle. Any questions?<br />
J: Do you think ordinary Australians should be paying Carmen Lawrence's<br />
legal bills?<br />
KB: I think ordinary working Australians should not be having to pay for this<br />
Royal Commission at all not one cent. But this was started by Richard<br />
Court as a political log-rolling exercise to the detriment of the taxpayers of<br />
Western Australia and a cynical usei -on his part, of the Royal<br />
Commission powers and it has proved nothing and there is, of course,<br />
now a proceeding in the Supreme Court which puts us in a situation<br />
where it is extraordinarily difficult to sensibly comment on these things<br />
except, of course, to go to the motives of the Government in establishing<br />
this Royal Commission.<br />
J: What about her motives? Dr Lawrence has gone to extraordinary lengths<br />
to stop this Royal Commission. Surely that must raise serious questions<br />
about what she did. </p>
<p>KB: This is the equivalent, on Richard Court's part, of when we came into<br />
office we decided that it would be a matter of great public interest if we<br />
inquired into the proceedings of the Cabinet, which had met and<br />
repeatedly refused to address the ' bottom of the harbour' tax evasion<br />
schemes. If a Commonwealth Government had decided to put a<br />
Royal Commission on that in place, you would have accused us of<br />
introducing dictatorial star chamber powers in Australia and you would<br />
have been right.<br />
J: How long can you support Dr Lawrence, given what has been said about<br />
her in the Commission?<br />
KB: Well you know very well that you shouldn't be discussing matters which<br />
are obviously now going to be the substance of argument in the Supreme<br />
Court. But Dr Lawrence has got over the years a very substantial level of<br />
confidence amongst ordinary Western Australians and she has got that<br />
by the dignity with which she held her office and the effectiveness with<br />
which she ran a Government and I don't think that the proceedings of a<br />
Royal Commission given the motives, the obvious political motives, that<br />
went to its creation are going to alter that.<br />
J: Does the Federal Government have a bottomless pit of money that it can<br />
use to kick the ( inaudible]?<br />
KB: Does Richard Court have a bottomless pit of money to keep putting one<br />
fanaticism, or one obsession, of his after another up for public<br />
expenditure, along with his taxation. I mean, the question is who started<br />
it? Who started rolling in? You know very well when you set up a Royal<br />
Commission that people are going to defend themselves before the Royal<br />
Commission, they are going to take a legal position there, in fact, as I<br />
understand it, Richard Court has offered those who are participants<br />
before it, some form of legal assistance. So he has obviously anticipated<br />
that the many millions of taxpayers money that is going to be spent on<br />
this particular political exercise of his, is taxpayers money worth<br />
spending. But there are consequences. Once you start that process<br />
rolling, once you start a process that goes to the heart of the difference<br />
between the Parliamentary operations and the judicial system, once you<br />
go down the road of a Royal Commission that is based not on an<br />
investigation of impropriety, illegality, maladministration or whatever,<br />
which are the normal reasons why you call a Royal Commission, these<br />
situations will occur.<br />
J: Is it not an advantage to Carmen Lawrence, particularly as the evidence<br />
already heard will go unchallenged for at least a week?<br />
KB: Well I think that at the end of the day you are going to see, if there is any<br />
discussion on these matters, there will be of course counters put into any<br />
particular proposition which is raised. But I think you have got to take a<br />
step back from the Royal Commission and its proceedings and go to the<br />
issues that caused its creation, or the motives that underlay its creation.<br />
And when you do that you are going to see I think the public have a<br />
-71-. 771 .7. </p>
<p>very considerable discount on any particular outcome that comes from the<br />
Royal Commission.<br />
J: The Commission is not about Richard Court, the Commission is about<br />
Carmen Lawrence. If she has shown to have behaved improperly or<br />
abused her power, will she continue to enjoy the Federal Cabinet's<br />
support?<br />
KB: No this Commission is about Richard Court. This Commission is a<br />
Commission that was established for political reasons, by Richard Court<br />
and for that reason there will be a high level of political discounting on<br />
any outcome.<br />
J: [ inaudible] for political reasons as well?<br />
KB: Carmen is challenging to defend herself, which she is entitled to do.<br />
If somebody sets up a political Royal Commission, or political basis in his<br />
motive in setting up a Royal Commission, and sends it after you, do you<br />
just stand mute?<br />
J: [ inaudible]<br />
KB: Look, don't ask me for analyses of public opinion. You go out there and<br />
read it yourself. In so far as I can see public opinion around Carmen<br />
Lawrence, two things stand out. The first is that she has a very high level<br />
of public regard in this State, for good reason. Secondly, I think that there<br />
is an understanding by the public of the political motivation that underlay<br />
the creation of this Royal Commission and there will consequently be,<br />
whatever the outcome, a discount attached to it and whatever is said in<br />
evidence, a discount attached to it because of the underlying motives that<br />
went into setting it up and I don't think anything that is going to be said at<br />
the Royal Commission, if indeed-it proceeds, is going to make any<br />
difference to that at all.<br />
J: Can I just ask you about the funding again? Is there a limit? Has the<br />
Federal Government set a limit on how much it will spend on these legal<br />
challenges?<br />
KB: Has Richard Court set a limit on how much it will cost for the Royal<br />
Commission?<br />
J: He has said 1.25, somewhere around there?<br />
KB: Oh, yes, and the rest.<br />
J: But I am talking about the Federal Government funding<br />
Carmen Lawrence's challenge. Has there been any talk of a limit on how<br />
much money people will spend?<br />
KB: Obviously, nobody is going to go through an unlimitless exercise. But the<br />
fact of the matter is, and this is not an exception in the case of this Royal </p>
<p>4<br />
Commission, it has been found in most of the Royal Commission's<br />
established, that is why you need to have a very good reason to set up a<br />
Royal Commission. That is why you need to have it as a Royal<br />
Commission operating with serious intent. But when you set up a Royal<br />
Commission it is going to be extremely difficult to put a price tag on it. It<br />
is very important, therefore, to remember who started this.<br />
J: merchandise imports What is your comment on that?<br />
KB: Well the import figures are, of course, in line with the figures the<br />
Government put out when it revised its views about the current account<br />
deficit earlier in the year and that was announced by Ralph Willis. There<br />
are some encouraging signs in the import figures that have come in.<br />
Consumption imports are down. The capital imports are up to a degree.<br />
But, overall, imports have fallen in the course of the last month and that is<br />
encouraging.<br />
J: Is it a sign that the economy is slowing down?<br />
KB: Well, it is a sign that we was predicted by the Government in the Budget<br />
that the current account deficit would peak during the course of this<br />
financial year and start to decline in terms of a percentage of GDP is<br />
probably going to come true. That, in part, does reflect some slowing in<br />
the economy to the extent that it was predicted by the Government in its<br />
Budget.<br />
J: Mr Beazley do you still have every faith in Carmen Lawrence's version of<br />
events leading up to the Commission?<br />
KB: I have absolute faith in Carmen Lawrence. I mean she is a very good<br />
person. She has been a very good Premier of this State and she<br />
deserves better treatment by her successor.<br />
J: So her press secretary is lying?<br />
KB: Oh don't be silly.<br />
J: [ inaudible]<br />
KB: The question of the legal support for Carmen Lawrence was a matter that<br />
was determined by Cabinet, yes. Now the extent to what those legal<br />
costs involve is, of course, going to be a matter kept constantly under<br />
review. But there are important issues at stake here and those issues, of<br />
course, go in fact although I don't expect people to be terribly interested<br />
in this to the very heart of the relationship between Parliament, the<br />
Cabinet and the judicial system. These are issues which cannot be likely<br />
glossed over by the initiative of one particular person involved in the<br />
process. They are hard issues which, when they get raised, have to be<br />
teased out and they will be teased out to their conclusion. Now, as I said<br />
before, we didn't start this. It was started by Mr Court and we warned at </p>
<p>the point of time when it started, Iall these sorts of ramifications were likely<br />
to flow, now they are flying.<br />
J: But has Dr Lawrence got Cabinet's unanimous support as far as the<br />
funding goes?<br />
KB: Oh well with her exception, of course, she wasn't there. But as far as the<br />
question that she would be allowed to be supported in her legal activities,<br />
yes that was the unanimous decision of Cabinet.<br />
J: [ inaudible]<br />
KB: It is not for me to characterise the Royal Commission. I mean the Royal<br />
Commissioners are of course, have their own views about their own<br />
integrity and I don't think it is appropriate if these issues are canvassed.<br />
But what we can canvass is what went into their creation and that is what<br />
I have been canvassing very solidly here for the last five minutes.<br />
J: [ inaudible].. budget blow out in superannuation costs?<br />
KB: What was assumed in that particular paper was a much high level of<br />
growth in jobs than the Government was predicting and what it did its<br />
figuring on. Of course if that was to occur, that would be terrific news and<br />
were it to occur, it wouldn't just mean an increase in the amounts that the<br />
Commonwealth would have to set aside for superannuation. Vastly<br />
beyond that would have been a substantial increase in revenue receipts,<br />
so there would be no blowout if those figures were in fact to be achieved.<br />
J: So the article is too optimistic as far as job growth goes?<br />
KB: Well it is not the Commonwealth's figures on job growth anticipation, no.<br />
Well somebody was asked, some Treasury official was asked, well what if<br />
the job growth is better than the Commonwealth thinks, what will happen?<br />
Well, obviously, on one side of the ledger, the Commonwealth will have to<br />
pay out more money for its superannuation undertaking. But, on the other<br />
side of the ledger and vastly greater amounts, would come in revenue<br />
from the taxation receipts with more people in the workforce.<br />
J: Hasn't the Treasurer admitted that the Government has underestimated<br />
the costs of superannuation?<br />
KB: I think the Treasurer has said that the particular paper that was produced<br />
was based on a set of estimates that was well beyond what the<br />
Government's estimates were. But I mean that would be unmitigatedly<br />
good news were it to occur. The increase in the cost of the<br />
superannuation payout would be neither here nor there, alongside the<br />
increase in the receipts, but would pay for it, they would pay for it many<br />
times over if that was the sort of job growth that we were going to see. It<br />
would be great if it happened. But we are not anticipating it happening.<br />
