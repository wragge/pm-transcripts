TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP,<br />
JANUARY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST; M-came out today# last<br />
month and .6f over the past three months. Are you happy<br />
with that?<br />
PK': Well I wouldn't say I'm in a state of euphoria. I'm<br />
reasonably neutral about the figures in the sense they don't<br />
of themselves suggest an excessive level of demand but then<br />
the economy is running strongly and the indicators are a<br />
little bit inconsistent in that respect. I mean for<br />
instance if you look at motor vehicle sales they are high<br />
and as housing activity is still high, the retail sales<br />
figures are consistent with an economy which is operating at<br />
a reasonably acceptable level of activity where as in fact<br />
we're running a bit too strong.<br />
JOURNALIST; Is there any need to<br />
any further?<br />
PK: No I am content at this stage with the way in which<br />
it's playing its role in the management of the economy. I<br />
mean the most important set of statistics that's on the<br />
horizon now is the CPI figures for the December quarter,<br />
which will be coming out at the end of the month, they'll be<br />
very important. But I just want to repeat what I've said<br />
consistently. That whenever any particular set of<br />
statistics come out and people say, " oh you're to do<br />
something in particular now". I simply say look we've been<br />
in office for nearly six years and our record shows that we<br />
watch and monitor the economy and we make the decisions that<br />
are necessary to keep up responsible economic management.<br />
Nothing's going to change on that. We will continue to<br />
watch and do those things that are necessary to keep the<br />
economy moving at the level which is consistent with<br />
handling the major problem of the Australian economy which<br />
is the external account. We can't have the Australian<br />
economy operating at too high a level of activity which is<br />
going to be sucking in imparts at too high a level and<br />
imposing further strains on the external account. That's<br />
the major task that we've got. 25,01,89 15: 51 No. 015 P. 01 </p>

JOURNALIST: On the I P front, are iou at<br />
all concerned with the position adopted by<br />
in respect of the new Commission.<br />
P14: Well I don't want to really comment on that. I mean I<br />
can understand Mr justice Staples' position. It's'been a<br />
problem though for successive governments of both political<br />
persuasions and so I can understand his concern but it's<br />
been a problem there that has been recognised by all<br />
governments and I don't want to say anything more about<br />
that. JOURNALIST: But would you support his inclusion in the new<br />
Industrial Relations commission or not?,<br />
PM: Well we've made the decision on that haven't we. We<br />
didn't include him.<br />
JOURNALIST: He's going?<br />
PK; Well that's the decision, yes.<br />
