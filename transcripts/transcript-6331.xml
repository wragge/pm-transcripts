CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED [ JTL 11 A. X.<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON R. J. HAWKE AC, MP<br />
TO THE QUEENSLAND STATE COUNCIL<br />
BRISBANE<br />
3 MARCH 1984<br />
DELEGATES, IT IS JUST ONE YEAR AGO MONDAY, TO BE EXACT<br />
THAT THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE MADE THEIR HISTORIC DECISION<br />
AND PUT LABOR IN CHARGE OF THE AFFAIRS OF THIS NATION.<br />
THE QUEENSLAND CONTRIBUTION TO THAT RESULT<br />
WAS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.<br />
QUEENSLAND GAVE US PROPORTIONATELY THE SECOND<br />
HIGHEST GAINS IN AUSTRALIA AFTER WESTERN AUSTRALIA.<br />
WE DOUBLED OUR REPRESENTATION IN THIS STATE<br />
FROM FIVE TO TEN,<br />
AND WE RETURNED TO THE POSITION ALL TOO RARE<br />
DURING THE PAST THIRTY-FIVE YEARS WHEREBY LABOR NOW HOLDS<br />
A MAJORITY OF QUEENSLAND'S NINETIEEN FEDERAL SEATS.<br />
THAT IS QUEENSLAND'S ANSWER TO THOSE WHO WOULD<br />
HAVE YOU BELIEVE THAT QUEENSLAND IS DIFFERENT THAT<br />
QUEENSLAND IS ANTI-LABOR, THAT QUEENSLAND IS THE DOMAIN<br />
OF CONSERVATISM AND REACTION IN AUSTRALIA. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
AND IT'S THE ONLY ANSWER THAT MATTERS<br />
THE ANSWER OF THE PEOPLE OF QUEENSLAND.<br />
THE FACT IS., DELEGATES, THAT THE ONLY THING THE<br />
PEOPLE OF QUEENSLAND NEED TO SHOW THE STRENGTH OF THEIR<br />
SUPPORT FOR LABOR IS A FAIR REDISTRIBUTION AND AN HONEST<br />
ELECTORAL SYSTEM.<br />
AND IT WAS THE REFUSAL. OF THE LIBERALS IN THIS<br />
STATE TO GIVE THE PEOPLE THE CHANCE OF A DECENT,<br />
HONEST, FAIR SYSTEM WHICH LED TO THEIR DEVASTATION<br />
LAST OCTOBER. DELEGATES, WHAT HAPPENED ON THE FIFTH OF<br />
MARCH 1983 WAS MORE THAN A LABOR VICTORY: IT WAS<br />
A WATERSHED IN OUR HISTORY. WE HAVE SET THIS NATION ON<br />
A PATH OF CHANGE, REFORM AND RECONSTRUCTION WHICH WILL<br />
DETERMINE THE SHAPE OF AUSTRALIA FOR THE REST OF THIS<br />
CENTURY AND BEYOND.<br />
AND I BELIEVE WE CAN SAY AS A GOVERNMENT AND<br />
AS A PARTY THAT NO GOVERNMENT IN THE ISTORY OF AUSTRALIA<br />
HAS MOVED SO PROMPTLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO HONOUR THE<br />
UNDERTAKINGS WE GAVE TO THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA JUST<br />
ONE YEAR AGO, / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
AND DELEGATES TO THIS REPRESENTATIVE GATHERING<br />
OF LABOR MEN AND WOMEN THE OFFICERS, BRANCH OFFICIAL"<br />
AND RANK AND FILE MEMBERS WHO WORKED SO HARD TO ACHIEVE<br />
THAT VICTORY, YOU KNOW THAT THE EFFORTS OUR GOVERNMENT<br />
YOUR GOVERNMENT -HAS MADE OVER THE PAST YEA.-Z HAVE BEEN<br />
DIRECTED UNSWERVINGLY TOWARD) S THE FULFILMENT OF THE<br />
POLICIES, PROGRAM, PLATFORM AND PRINCIPLES OF THE<br />
GREAT AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY,<br />
EVERYTHING WE HAVE DONE HAS REFLiECTED OUR<br />
ABSOLUTE COMMITMENT TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF LABOR'S CAUSE.<br />
DELEGATES, WHEN YOU REMEMBER OUR INHERITANCE<br />
OF SEVEN YEARS OF FRASER AND FRASERISM, WHEN YOU REMEMBER<br />
THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS CONFRONTING AUSTRALIA<br />
ONLY A YEAR AGO,-IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY EASY FOR US TO<br />
CONCENTRATE SIMPLY ON THE IMMEDIATE TASK IN HAND -THAI<br />
FIRST TASK FOR WHICH WE WERE ELECTED, THE TASK OF CLEANING<br />
UP THE ECONOMIC MESS THE CONSERVATIVES LEFT US.<br />
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO, USE THE ALIBI OF THE<br />
RECESSION -THE WORST FOR FIFTY YEARS AS AN EXCUSE FOR<br />
PUTTING THE REST OF THE LABOR PROGRAM AND THE WORK OF<br />
SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, ELECTORAL AND LEGAL REFORM<br />
ON THE BACK BURNER.<br />
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO USE THE MASSIV'E INHERITED<br />
DEFICIT TH-E CONCEALED $ 9.6 BILLION AS AN EXCUSE TO<br />
DEFER INDEFINITELY LABOR'S PROGRAM FOR ECONOMIC AND<br />
SOCIAL REFORM. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
BUT THAT HAS NOT BEEN OUR WAY, IT IS NOT<br />
MY WAY. AND IT IS NOT THE LABOR WAY.<br />
WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND WHAT WE WILL CONTINUE<br />
TO DO IS TO WORK FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND THE<br />
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LABOR PROGRAM, SIDE BY SIDE.<br />
AND OF COURSE DELEGATES., THEY ARE INTERLOCKING<br />
OBJECTIVES. THE ULTIMATE FULFILMENT OF OUR UNDERTAKINGS<br />
TO THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA MUST DEPEND ON THE RESTORATION<br />
OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND A SUSTAINED RECOVERY WITH STRONG<br />
GROWTH IN EMPLOYMENT, WITHOUT A NEW ROUND OF SELF-DEFEATING<br />
INFLATION. SO WE HAVE GIVEN TOP PRIORITY TO THE ACHIEVEMENT<br />
OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY AS THE PRECONDITION FOR THE FULL<br />
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LABOR PROGRAM.<br />
BUT AGAIN, I EMPHASISE THAT, ' TO THE LIMIT OF<br />
OUR RESOURCES, AND WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE CONSTRAINTS<br />
IMPOSED ON US BY THE LIBERAL LEGACY, WE HAVE MOVED<br />
SIMULTANEOUSLY, PROMPTLY AND PR9, RESSIVELY, TO FULFIL<br />
THE UNDERTAKINGS ON WHICH WE WERE ELECTED. </p>
<p>THE RESULT HAS BEEN A RECORD OF PERFORMANCE OF<br />
ELECTION PROMISES THAT NO PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HAS MATCHED<br />
IN THE HISTORY OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
ALTHOUGH OUR PROPOSALS WERE PRESENTED AS A<br />
PROGRAM FOR OUR FIRST PARLIAMENTARY TERM, THE OVERWHELMING<br />
MAJORITY NEARLY 90 PERCENT OF THEM HAVE BEEN HONOURED<br />
IN FULL OR SET IN TRAIN BY THE END OF OUR FIRST YEAR.<br />
AND DELEGATES, JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE<br />
IMPLEMENTATION OF SPC CIFIC PROMISES, IS THE APPROACH,<br />
THE SPIRIT, THE PHILOSOPHY WHICH WE HAVE BROUGHT TO THE<br />
WORK AS A WHOLE.<br />
AND THAT APPROACH, THAT SPIRIT, THAT PHILOSOPHY,<br />
HAS BEEN UNIQUELY AND AUTHENTICALLY THE LABOR APPROACH,<br />
THE LABOR SPIRIT,, THE LABOR PHILOSOPHYi THE LABOR WAY,<br />
AND FUNDAMENTAL TO EVERYTHING WE HAVE DONE HAS B3EEN<br />
THE EFFORT TO BRING AUSTRALIANS TOGETHER AND TO REPLACE<br />
CONFRONTATION WITH CO-OPERATION.<br />
AND THAT IDEA THE IDEA OF* THE CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETYLIES<br />
AT THE VERY HEART OF THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE<br />
LABOR PARTY AND THE LABOR MOVEMENT. THAT IS THE TRUE MEANING<br />
OF " THE LIG1HT ON THE HILL".. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
WHAT WE HAVE TRIED TO DO IS TO<br />
TRANSLATE THAT I. ABOR IDEAL THE-IDEAL OF THE TRULY.<br />
CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY INTO PRACTICAL TERMS.<br />
AND NOWHERE IS THIS UNIQUELY LABOR APPROACH<br />
BETTER ILLUSTRATED THAN IN THE AREA OF ECONOMIC<br />
POLICY. THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT CONFERENCE<br />
AND ALL THAT FLOWED FROM IT, THE PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD,<br />
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ECONOMIC PLANNING ADVISORY<br />
COUNCIL, WAGE INDEXATION WITH ALL ITS SIGNIF ICANCE<br />
FOR THE FUTURE OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IN THIS<br />
COUNTRY ALL THESE TOUCH AT EVERY POINT UPON T-HE<br />
CENTRAL LABOR IDEAL OF THE CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY,<br />
THE BUILDING OF A COMMUNITY IN WHICH ALL SECTIONS ANI)<br />
INTERESTS RECOGNISE THEIR INTERDEPENDENCE.<br />
IT IS TRUE THAT EACH OF [ HE MEASURES JUST<br />
MENTIONED, AND THE REST OF OUR ECONOMIC DECISIONS,<br />
WERE MADE IN THE IMMEDIATE CONTEXT OF THE MASSIVE ECONOMIC<br />
CRISIS WE INHERITED. BUT THERE IS NOTHING AD HOC<br />
ABOUT THEM. THEY FORM PART OF A' CONSISTENT AND<br />
COHERENT POLICY. AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE FOR THIS NATION,<br />
IN THE WAY WE WORK TOGETHER, AND BUILD TOGETHER, WILL<br />
ENDURE LONG AFTER THEIR INITIAL PURPOSE HAS BEEN SERVED<br />
AND WE HAVE FINALLY CLEANED UP THE ECONOMIC MESS WE<br />
INHERITED A YEAR AGO. 17 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
DELEGATES, J SAID BEFORE THAT NEARLY NINETY<br />
PERCENT OF THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS CONTA INED IN THE POLICY<br />
SPEECH LAST YEAR HAVE ALREADY BEEN CARRIED OUT IN FULL<br />
OR IN PART. BUT THE POLICY SPEECH I PRESENTED ON BEHALF<br />
OF THE PARTY A YEAR AGO WAS NOT JUST SOME SHOPPING LIST<br />
OF ELECTiON PROMISES DRUMMED UP OVERNIG; HT FOR THE CAMPAIGN.<br />
IT WAS NOT PRODUCED IN A VACUUM. IT BROUGHT TOGETHER THE<br />
MONTHS AND YEARS OF WOR~ K BY THE COMMITTEES, COUNCILS AND<br />
CONFERENCES OF OUR PARTY.<br />
THAT WORK FINDS PARTICULAR EXPRESSION IN<br />
THE PLATFORM. AND JUST AS WE HAVE AN UNPARALLELED RECORD OF<br />
PERFORMANCE IN HONOURING OUR ELECTION UNDERTAKINGS,<br />
THIS LABOR GOVERNMENT, IN ITS FIRST YEAR, HAS DONE MORE<br />
THAN ANY PREVIOUS FEDERAL LABOR GOVERNMENT IN A COMPARABLE<br />
PERIOD TO GIVE EFFECT To LABOR PO'LICIES.<br />
ANY EXAMINATION OF OUR ACHIEVEMENTS, VIEWED<br />
AGAINST THE PERSPECTIVE EITHER OF THE POLICY SPEECH OR<br />
THE PLATFORM FROM WHICH IT SPRANG, WILL AMPLY DEMONSTRATE THIS,<br />
s a / 8 </p>
<p>IN THE ECONOMIC FIELD, THE PRIMACY THE PLATFORM<br />
GIVES TO ECONOMIC PLANNING, TO ECONOMIC GROWTH, TO EXPANDED<br />
CAPITAL WORKS PROGRAMS, TO INCREASED ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES<br />
TO HOUSING, TO WAGE INDEXATION, TO PRICE SURVEILLANCE, TO<br />
THE ERADICATION OF TAX AVOIDANCE, TO FAIRNESS AND EQUITY IN<br />
RELATIONS WITH THE STATES AND BETWEEN THE STATES, TO MORE<br />
EFFECTIVE AUSTRALIAN PARTICIPATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
AUSTRALIA'S INDUSTRIES AND RESOURCES ALL THIS AND MORE IS<br />
FAITHFULLY REFLECTED IN OUR GOVERNMENT'S PRIORITIES AND OUR<br />
GOVERNMENT'S DECISIONS.<br />
WE HAVE GIVEN'PARTICULAR PRIORITY TO EXPANDING<br />
EMPLOYMENT AND REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT. SINCE THE SUMMIT<br />
LAST APRIL, SEASONALLY ADJUSTED EMPLOYMENT HAS EXPANDED<br />
BY OVER 2 PERCENT BY* MORE THAN 130,000 JOBS AND<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN CUT FROM 10.3 PERCENT TO 9.5 PERCENT.<br />
WE HAVE THEREFORE ALREADY GONE A GOOD WAY TOWARDS REALISING<br />
OUR ELECTION COMMITMENT TO SEE 500,000 NEW JOBS CREATED<br />
IN OUR FIRST THREE YEARS IN OFFICE. INDEED WE ARE AHEAD<br />
OF THE RATE REQUIRED TO MEET THAT4TARGET.<br />
IN SOCIAL WELFARE, AN HEALTH, ' N EDUCATION,<br />
TREMENDOUS STRIDES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TOWARDS THE FULFILMENT OF<br />
THE PLATFORM. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE TO BRING THE BASIC PENSION<br />
RATE TO A MORE SATISFACTORY LEVEL.<br />
WE HAVE INDEXED PENSIONER FRINGE BENEFITS. / 9 </p>
<p>WE HAVE INCREASED THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT FOR<br />
SINGLE ADULTS BY OVER 20 PERCENT.<br />
WE HAVE INCREASED ASSISTANCE FOR THE CHILDREN<br />
OF PENSIONERS BY 20 PERCENT.<br />
MEDICARE IS NOW AN ESTABLISHED FACT, AND I SAY<br />
WITH ABSOLUTE CONVICTION THAT THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA<br />
NOT LEAST THE PEOPLE OF QUEENSLAND WHO WILL BENEFIT SO MU2H<br />
FROM IT WILL NEVER AGAIN PERMIT IT TO BE DISMANTLED OR<br />
SABOTAGED. WE HAVE BOOSTED EDUCATION FUNDING AND REDIRECTED<br />
FUNDS ON THE BASIS OF NEED. IN THE PROCESS, WE HAVE<br />
REDISTRIBUTED FUNDS TOWARDS GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS AND THE GREAT<br />
MAJORITY OF NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS WHOSE NEEDS ARE GREATEST.<br />
WE ARE COMMIT-ED TO-ACHIEVING THE PARTY'S BASIC OBJECTIVE OF<br />
PROVIDING EQUALITY OF EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL AUSTRALIAN<br />
CHILDREN. AND, DELEGATES, IN THAT NOBLE WORD " EQUALITY"<br />
GENUINE EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS YOU HAVE<br />
THE VERY TOUCHSTONE OF OUR PARTY'S PHILOSOPHY.<br />
WE HAVE MOVED RAPIDLY TO PROMOTE REAL EQUALITY OF<br />
OPPORTUNITY REGARDLESS OF SEX, RACE, OR ETHNIC BACKGROUND. </p>
<p>WE HAVE INTRODUCED THE PATHBREAKING SEX<br />
DISCRIMINATION BILL-IT HAS ALREADY PASSED THE SENATE AND-IS NOW<br />
BEING CONSIDERED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.<br />
WE HAVE RATIFIED THE KEY UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION<br />
ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST<br />
WOMEN. WE HAVE REINSTATED THE NATIONAL WOMEN's EMERGENCY<br />
SERVICES PROGRAM TO CO-ORDINATE EMERGENCY SERVICES FOR WOMEN<br />
AND CHILDREN ESCAPING INTOLERABLE DOMESTIC SITUATIONS.<br />
WE HAVE APPOINTED MORE THAN FIFTY WOM'EN TO IMPORTANT<br />
STATUTORY POSITIONS WITH GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES SUCH AS<br />
THE ABC, THE TERTIARY EDUCATION COMMISSION* AND EPAC$<br />
WE WILL SHORTLY ISSUE A GREEN PAPER SETTING OUT<br />
OUR PLANS FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR WOMEN.<br />
WE BOOSTED COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR<br />
ABORIGINAL PROGRAMS By 28 PERCENT THIS FINANCIAL YEAR AND<br />
MADE AVAILABLE A FURTHER $ 130 MILLION FROM OTHER COMMONWEALTrH<br />
SOURCES. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A WORKING PARTY TO EXAMINE<br />
REQUIREMENTS FOR A UNIFORM COMMONWEALTH APPROACH TO ABORIGIN4AL<br />
LAND RIGHTS. / 11 </p>
<p>-11-<br />
OUR HISTORIC DECISIONS TO GRANT LAND TITLE TO<br />
AYERS ROCK AND MT OLGA TO THE TRADITIONAL ABORIGINAL OWNERS<br />
SHOWS OUR WILLINGNESS TO RECOGNISE THE JUST AND LEGITIMATE<br />
CLAIMS OF A PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DISPOSSESSED OF THEIR LAND.<br />
WE HAVE PROVIDED 60 ADDITIONAL GRANTS TO ETHNIC<br />
AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY AGENCIES HAVING EXTENSIVE CONTACT<br />
WITH MIGRANTS TO IMPROVE THE ACCESS OF MIGRANT TO WELFARE<br />
SERVICES. i WE HAVE BOOSTED FUNDING FOR THE ADULT MIGRANT<br />
EDUCATION SERVICE TO IMPROVE ENGLISH LANGUAGE SERVICES<br />
FOR MIGRANTS. WE HAVE APPOINTED A MIGRANT WOMEN CO-ORDINATOR<br />
TO DEAL WITH THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF MIGRANT WOMEN.<br />
WE ARE STRENGTHENING THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION,<br />
WE ARE STRENGTHENING THE RACIAL DISCRIMINATION ACT<br />
TO MAKE IT A MORE-EFFECTIVE WEAPON FOR FIGHTING RACIAL<br />
DISCRIMINATION. AT LAST, AUSTRALIA HAS A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT<br />
DETERMINED TO CARRY OUT ITS CONSTITUTIONAL AND MORAL<br />
RESPONSIBILITIES TO OUR ABORIGINAL PEOPLE. ,/ 12 </p>
<p>-12-<br />
DELEGATES, WE CAN GO THROUGH THE PLATFORM<br />
VIRTUALLY PAGE BY PAGE AND SEE A RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT<br />
NOT EXCELLED IN THE HISTORY OF LABOR GOVERNMENTS OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
INDEED, I REQUESTED my DEPARTMENT TO DO JUST THAT,<br />
AND THE DOCUMENT THEY HAVE PROVIDED AMOUNTS TO-. A. MAS-S-4E<br />
CONFIRMATION OF A RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT OF WHICH I BELIEVE<br />
EVERY MEMBER OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY THROUGHOUT<br />
THIS NATION CAN BE JUSTLY PROUD PROUD OF OUR ACHIEVEMENT,<br />
PROUD OF OUR PARTY, PROUD OF OUR. GOVERNMENT.<br />
BUT I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE CAN BE PROUDEST OF<br />
ALL ABOUT, IS THE WAY THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE HAVE IkESPONDED TO OUR WORK<br />
ON THEIR BEHALF. THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT GIVEN LEADERSHIP FROM LABOR..<br />
WE CAN WORK TOGETHER, WE CAN REDUCE CONFRONTATION, WE CAN<br />
RESOLVE CONFLICT, VIE CAN CO-OPERATE WITH EACH OTHER TO<br />
BUILD A BETTER FUTURE.<br />
IN PARTICULAR, THE RESPONSE OF THE BUSINESS<br />
COMMUNITY AND THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT HAS BEEN OF TREMENDOUS<br />
ENCOURAGEMENT AND IS TREMENDOUSToY SIGNIFICANT FOR THE FUTURE.<br />
INDUSTRIAL DISPUTATION IN THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN<br />
AT QUITE HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS. / 13 </p>
<p>-13-<br />
THERE HAS BEEN A GENUINE EXERCISE OF RESTRAINT.<br />
IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THAT SPIRIT CONTINUES IF THE<br />
RECOVERY IS TO BE FULLY ACHIEVED AND SUSTAINED.<br />
AND ONLY IF THAT HAPPENS, WILL WE BE ABLE TO<br />
CONTINUE OUR WORK OF CARRYING OUT THE PROGRAM AND<br />
PLATFORM OF THE PARTY TO ITS COMPLETION.<br />
FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR AS LONG AS MOST OF US<br />
( AN REMEMBER, AUSTRALIA NOW HAS A REAL CHANCE OF PUTTING<br />
BEHIND US THE NEEDLESS DIVISIONS AND CONFRONTATIONS THAT<br />
HAVE IMPEDED OUR PROGRESS, MARRED OUR SOCIETY AND REDUCED<br />
OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST DECADE.<br />
THIS IS A CHANCE, A CHANCE FOR NATIONAL RECOVERY,<br />
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION AND NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION, WHICH<br />
MUST NOT B~ E THROWN AWAY.<br />
IN PARTICULAR, DELEGATES, T. HE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE<br />
MUST RESOLUTELY OPPOSE THE EFFORTS OF THOSE FEW WHO SEEK,<br />
FOR THEIR OWN ENDS, TO UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN OUR<br />
DEMOCRATIC, INDUSTRIAL, POLITICAL, LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL<br />
INSTITUTIONS. ./ 114 </p>
<p>-14-<br />
THIS WEEK THE NATIONAL PARLIAMENT WAS DISGRACED<br />
BY A SQUALID ATTEMPT TO BESMIRCH THE ENTIRE JUDICIAL SYSTEM<br />
IN THIS NATION. IT IS NO COINCIDENCE, DELEGATES, THAT THIS<br />
ATTEMPT TO UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN OUR INSTITUTIONS COMES<br />
AT A TIME OF HISTORIC ASCENDANCY OF OUR PARTY<br />
AT A TIME WHEN, BY OUR SCRUPULOUS ADHERENCE TO THE<br />
PRINCIPLES AND THE SYSTEM OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY,<br />
WE HAVE WON THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, THE GOVERNMENTS OF<br />
FOUR STATESj AND ARE WI. THIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF GOVERNMENT<br />
IN QUEENSLAND. THE PEOPLE, EXPRESSING THEMSELVES THROUGH THE<br />
DEMOCRATIC'SYSTEM, HAVE DECISIVELY REJECTED OUR CONSERVATIVE<br />
OPPONENTS THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA.<br />
AND IN THEIR DESPAIR AND BITTERNESS, SOME ELEMENTS<br />
AMONG THESE SO-CALLED CONSERVATIVES ARE PREPARED TO SABOTAGE<br />
THE SYSTEM ITSELF AND THE INSTITUTIONS ON WHICH IT IS BASED.<br />
DELEGATES, I AM CONFIDENT THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA<br />
WILL REJECT WITH CONTEMPT THE DISGRACEFUL TACTICS OF THESE<br />
DISCREDITED PEOPLE. </p>
<p>IT IS SIMPLY AN ATTEMPT TO REVIVE THE POLITICS<br />
OF DIVISION, THE POLITICS OF SUSPICION, THE POLITICS<br />
OF CONFRONTATION IN A DIFFERENT, AND EVEN MORE DAMAGING,<br />
FORM. AND JUST AS THE PEOPLE REJECTED THOSE POLITICS<br />
SO DECISIVELY A YEAR AGO, SO WILL THEY REJECT THEM NOW<br />
AND IN THE YEARS TO COME YEARS, DELEGATES, THAT<br />
WITH YOUR CONTINUING SUPPORT AND THE SUPPORT OF YOUR<br />
FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE PARTY THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA, WILL BE<br />
GREAT YEARS FOR OUR GOVERNMENT, OUR PARTY, AND OUR NATION.<br />
