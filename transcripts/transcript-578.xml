OPENING OF TWELFTH WORLD POULTRY CONGESSI<br />
SHOUGROUNDS_ 9 SYDNEY.<br />
13TH AUGUST. 1962<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt, Hen. R. G. Menzies<br />
Mr. Chairman. Mr. Minister Mr. World President Mr. President<br />
Playfair that's quite a decent mouthful Laes and<br />
Gentlemen About a fortnight ago, I began to assemble a fqw<br />
ideas in my mind for this afternoon because I -knew that the<br />
Governor-. General himself, as your Patroncould not be here.<br />
As you know he's abroad but will be back, I am happy to say,<br />
early in OctLber or more accurately, at the end of September.<br />
I began to say to myself " Now, my you know one<br />
speaks to oneself quite lrankly ( Laughter) in the sile<br />
watches of the night " what do you know about fowls?"<br />
( Laughter) I was speaking to myself in an entirely nonpolitical<br />
sense, you understand, ( Laughter) and I drew on<br />
my boyish recollections there were always a few chooks, as<br />
I am afraid we called therm, rurnning around, I was familiar<br />
with such . respectable names as Buff Orpington and Rhcde Island<br />
Reds and White Leghorns and Wyandottes and with that I ran<br />
outs I couldntt think of any more,<br />
This morning, I had forty minutes looking around<br />
the various exhibits and I want to tell you that I arrived<br />
here as ill-informed as a Prime Minister could reasonably be,<br />
and I learnt more in forty minutes about your industry than<br />
I otherwise would have learned in ten years0<br />
This, I think, is a most exciting Congress and a<br />
most exciting collection of exhibits. You, of course, are<br />
all very familiar with this industry, you are all very<br />
familiar with its extraordinary developments, particularly<br />
in the last ten or twenty years; but to the layman there is<br />
something dramatic about what has gone on. I can remember,<br />
and some of you can, a time when gentlemen would be heard to<br />
say, when asked " VWhat are you going to do when you retire?"<br />
11h; I'll think Ill run a chicken farm." Just like that,<br />
you see, And I used to suffer from the illusion that the:<br />
worldvs perfect chicken farm would be one in which white fowls<br />
rambled around on lovely green swards, presenting quite an<br />
artistic picture to the eye. Then, later on, when I found<br />
myself, years back, being driven from the Canberra airport<br />
into the city of Canberra, I would see bright lights running<br />
along in rows where I knew there was a chicken farm and I<br />
would say, " That fellow is imrking late tonight," ( Laughter)<br />
only to discover that he wasn't the one who was working,<br />
( Laughter) But Sir, I think I might be right in saying that<br />
except for a few highKLy-qualified peop] e a great deal of<br />
this great industry was conducted in Australia in a sort of<br />
part-time fashion, with a limited number of poultry, limited<br />
equipment perhaps a very limited knowledge of the scientific<br />
problems involved, Today, i ha-ye been told by my col. eague,<br />
the Chairman, Mr0 Adermann9 who is infallible on these matters,<br />
that in 1960-61 the total product of this industry in Australia<br />
itself was valued at Å 67 million.-a very perceptible percentage<br />
of the entire output of primary industry in Australia. 0a 0 0a0 o 0 a/ 2 </p>
<p>22--<br />
Now this has happened I think I am right in saying,<br />
in a very limited period of years. Sc that today, what was<br />
regarded by so many people as a sort of amateur exorcise, has<br />
become a major primary industry with an enormous production<br />
and a quite substantial export trade. What is going to happen<br />
to export trades in these fields we don't yet know because<br />
in all countries, all advanced countries at any rate there<br />
has been a very great increase in production and self-sufficiency<br />
in fields of this kind.<br />
Great Britain which used to be a very large export<br />
market for Australia has now, herself, developed the production<br />
in this field which was out of imagination fifteen years ago,<br />
But there are many parts of the world and many, many hundreds<br />
of millions of people in the world not so far away from here<br />
who, as their standards of living rise, will feel more and<br />
more the need for the production of this industry, bearing as<br />
it does so closely and with such immense value on the problem<br />
of the feeding of mankind. o And that's a great problem,<br />
By the end of this century we are told by the<br />
statisticians by the demographers, that the population of<br />
the world will nearly double and people must eat if they are<br />
to liveo Sir, I believe that the wonderful work, of which I<br />
will say a little in a moment, that is being done in this<br />
industry, reachi. ng out into these new and populous countries,<br />
in a helpful way, by expert assistance, by training, will<br />
ultimately make a powerful contribution to the happiness of<br />
mankind. Unless these hundreds and hundreds of millions of<br />
people who will be added to the world's population between<br />
now and the turn of the century are able to eat are able to<br />
be clothed, are able to live in a reasonable, civilised<br />
fashion, then the problem: that the world may have in the<br />
rest of this century may be even greater than the ones we've<br />
already had.<br />
Therefore, every industry which contains in itself<br />
such skill and such enthusiasm and such a willingness to<br />
raise the level of knowledge, every industry of this kind<br />
is, I believe, making a notable contribution to the welfare<br />
of the world for the rest of the twentieth century.<br />
Now Sir, I thought I would just like to say a few<br />
words in elaboration of one aspect of that matter, It is<br />
very easy for people like me, and I represent I hope I may<br />
say the average layman in Australia some of them even vote<br />
for me ( Laughter) but at any rate I am like them in this<br />
respect, that we have rather thought of this industry as a sort<br />
of catoh-as-catch-can, I didn't know until I came here this<br />
morning to what extent scientific research had been applied<br />
to an industry of this kind and wiTh such superb resultsÃ¸<br />
Here is something that has become a highly-organised industry.<br />
I walked around, fortunately, for part of the time<br />
with Sir Frederick White who is the head of C. SI. R. O,, the<br />
greatest scientific research establishment in this country<br />
and one of the greatest in the worldo He has for years now,<br />
with a rather despairing note in this voice, been trying to<br />
make me understand that we not only need more and more<br />
scientific research in Australia, but we need more and more<br />
application of it to the problems of the man on the land and<br />
that perhaps we have fallen down a little in not being able<br />
to convey to the man on the farm the full benefits, quickly<br />
enough, of pure scientific research and of research into<br />
oo. o0t o / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
applied science, into technology. Today, I have seen it<br />
brought into a small compass. I would wish to hope, though<br />
of course I can't9 that most of the people in this c'ity<br />
might have the opportunity of looking at what can be seen<br />
here. They would come to realise, as I have, that here is<br />
an outstanding example I am not sure that it isn't the<br />
outstanding example of the application of scientific<br />
enquiry to the end of production, preparation, packaging<br />
and selling of a primary product. This is really the most<br />
tremendous thing.<br />
As I have admitted to you frankly, I used to feel<br />
a little sorry for the incarcerated hen, sitting in a battery<br />
with the lights on, laying eggs ( Laughter). I thought,<br />
" Dear me, you know, this is awfully like being a politician".<br />
( Laughter) Except that we don't have any handling system<br />
that automatically tells you that the egg is addled.<br />
( Laughter) ( Applause) But I realise now, having looked<br />
around, that all this demcnstrates what I believe is the<br />
greatest revolution in productive and handling techmiques<br />
in a primary industry that I have seen in my time. And all<br />
the credit must be given to thoseuho have led the way in<br />
converting something that was a little casual, a little<br />
sketchy, even a little amateurish, into a magnificent<br />
industry scientifically and technically abreast of the<br />
times and therefore able to present to the people a result<br />
far more stable, far more satisfactory than they have ever<br />
had before and, at the same time, enable how many people<br />
did you say, Mr. Adermann? a hundred thousand people to<br />
be directly or indirectly connected with this industry in<br />
Australia is that right? a hundred thousand.<br />
We must give up I would like to say this to any<br />
layman wrho is here we must give up the idea that raising<br />
poultry, either as boilers ( I've been learning, you see,<br />
this morning) ( Laughter), broilers or boilers, or raising<br />
them for eggs and so on we must give up the idea that this<br />
is a casual part-time occupation on the fringes of cities,<br />
This is a notable industry, and I am sure that the head of<br />
the CÃ¸ S. I. R. O. would agree with me when I say that when in<br />
each primary industry we can say, with the same confidence,<br />
that the work of the scientist and the technologist has been<br />
married to the work of the actual operator in the field, when<br />
we can say that about all our primary industries that will<br />
be a very happy day for a very great primary-producing<br />
country. There is just one other aspect of that, We, in<br />
Australia, are of course as we always are, and I hope we<br />
always will be presentea with problems, Life consists of<br />
encountering problems and battling with them and trying to<br />
overcome them. And one of our problems, not peculiar to<br />
us, is that as the world goes on, as ou&amp; w secondary industries<br />
develop as they must if this country is to grow, we find<br />
constantly, don't weg the pressure of costs on the primary<br />
producer. The pressure of costs whether he's a woolgrower,<br />
a wheatgrower or a chicken-raiser or whatever it may be.<br />
You can't solve the problerm of increased costs just by some<br />
brutal decree that nobody's wages are ever to be increased.<br />
This is nonsense, You can! t solve it by some mechanical<br />
step which, for example, by abolishing the tariffs, puts<br />
half the primary industv-". Js out of business. The long-run<br />
answer to costs is increased efficiency of production through<br />
increased output and a higher level of scientific skill and<br />
of scientific managementÃ¸ This 1s the lesson for us all to<br />
0.0 000/ </p>
<p>learn. It will have to be l. earned by every exporting<br />
industry in Australia, It won't always be easy. The<br />
people who conduct these industries are not fools. They<br />
have lived their lives in them, they know far more about<br />
them than I do, but the one thing that I know in the broad,<br />
general sweep, is that if we are tc meet the competition<br />
of the world and reach out with our products into other<br />
countries then we must become, in tne widest sense of the<br />
word, applied scientists; because science is learning<br />
and teaching at a rate of geometrical progression today,<br />
There is so much to be learned, so much advantage to be<br />
got from what is being discovered,<br />
As I have had those ideas in my mind and I have<br />
spoken about them mora than once. i want to tell you with<br />
all sincerity that thirty or forty minutes this morning,<br />
going around to see what's been done, what is being done,<br />
how it's being done, has excited me, I have eeen here,<br />
within a small compass, the living proof of the kind of<br />
thing that I have been talking, to you about,<br />
And so I hope that you will allow me to say to all<br />
those who organised this Con&amp; ress, the first W4orld Congress<br />
of a prnay industry to be held in Australia " Thank<br />
you for a magnificent piece of organisation" and I hope<br />
you will allow me to say to those engaged in this industry,<br />
not only '" T'ank you" but " Congratulations" on what I think<br />
will be looked back upon as one of the great achievements<br />
in Australia in the last fifteen or twenty years.<br />
Sirg I have the greatest possible pleasure in<br />
declaring the Congress open, </p>
