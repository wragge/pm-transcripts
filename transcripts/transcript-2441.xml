114TERVIEW GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MR WILLIAM McMAHON<br />
ON TVW CHA NNEL 7 PERTH 3 JULY 1971<br />
interviewers Mr. John~ Hudson<br />
Mir. Syd. Donovan<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, do you and the Government intend this rugby tour,<br />
and then the cricket tour to go on, despite the protests of demonstrators?<br />
PM So far I've only looked at the problem of the rugby tour, and it will go on,<br />
and it will complete the number of matches that it said it would go into. We are<br />
not going to be intimidated and blackmailed by certain sections of the Trade<br />
Union Movement, and for reasons that I've made abundantly clear both on radio<br />
and to the media.<br />
Q. In other words you believe that the police will be able to maintain sufficient<br />
control regardless, to keep this tour flowing?<br />
PM Yes, I do. And not only do I think the police will be able to maintain<br />
control, but I'm certain that the vast majority of the Australian people want the<br />
tour to go on and to be successful. We're a great sporting country, and we're<br />
not going to let the few intimidate the rest of us.<br />
Qr For those people Prime Minister, who are anxious about Australia's<br />
attitude to apartheid, who have done their best to show the world that Australia's<br />
against it. What do you say to them tonight?,<br />
PM I believe that the attitude to apartheid is one of individual conscience. Now<br />
we as a Government dislike the system, we think it is a bad one. But we think that<br />
so far as Australians are concerned, and their consciences are involved, then it<br />
must be a matter of individual judgment what they do within the law. In other words,<br />
providing that they make up their minds they don't like it, if they like to persuade<br />
their friends too, that their friends should not like it then let them stay away from<br />
the matches, but don't let others, whose motives perhaps are not yet fully disclosed<br />
to the Australian people, don't let those other people exploit the position, and try and<br />
intimidate people not to go. In other words, conscience is a matter of very deep<br />
personal concern, and that personal conscience shouldn't be affected by the<br />
judgments and the influence of others.<br />
Q. The bigger attitude that's arisen out of this, of course, is the people who<br />
wonder why the Government was so quiet in the early days of the proposed tour<br />
according to the ACTU, and then the much broader issue of whether such power<br />
policies in Australia will be effective is the Government is the crude way of<br />
putting it.<br />
PM Well you used the words " according to the ACTU". The point is that<br />
from the very earliest days when I became the Prime Minister, I made it clear ./ 2 </p>
<p>that we would place no impediment whatsoever in the way of the tour proceeding and<br />
being successful. From then on it generated, I believe, into a struggle for power<br />
by certain elements within the Trade Union movement, and blatantly and obviously<br />
they showed that they were prepared to force a kind of tyranny on this country.<br />
And from that moment on, the question of apartheid degenerated into a squabble<br />
between these members of the AGTU, some of them, and the people of Australia<br />
as a whole. And I'm abundantly certain of this that the people resent the fact<br />
that this small group of people want to force their opinions upon others. Now we<br />
are the Government. But we hear very little from the Opposition today. In other<br />
words instead of the Opposition being able to express a view they've abdicated<br />
their position to Mr. Hawke, and a few people like him. And if ever an Opposition<br />
has given way to a small minority, we see it in existence in Australia today. But<br />
we are the legitimate Government, elected by the people, and we will do what we<br />
think is right in their interests, rather than the interests of that small minority<br />
who obviously are hell-bent on tyranny.<br />
You seem to be saying that there's an important principle at stake here,<br />
one of the most important principles that we've ever been confronted with perhaps.<br />
It's not just a matter anymore of wihether a few football matches should go on or<br />
not. It's degenerated now into three principles -four perhaps if I can put it that<br />
way. The first one is the right of Australians themselves to choose, providing<br />
they obey the law and act within the law. And why shouldn't they? They were born<br />
free, and they want to remain free. Why should someone else deprive them of the<br />
opportunity of free choice, and the opportunity to do what they want to do to watch<br />
a football match, it doesn't matter whether it happened to be the Dynamos from the<br />
Soviet, or whether it happened to be a football team from South Africa. The<br />
second one is far more important who does govern . this country? Is it to be a<br />
very small minority of people, or is it to be the duly elected people of this country<br />
representatives of this country. I believe in a liberal democracy here, and<br />
consequently when it comes to the question of Government, I believe it is the<br />
representatives of the people themselves who are to govern, and we're not to be<br />
coerced by a small section of the Trade Union movement. And there is another<br />
question involved too. I don't like people to prostitute their political position by<br />
saying there's some moral issue involved. I think sport ought to be divorced from<br />
politics and I believe that's the view of the Australian people, too. If people like to<br />
mix the two up together, driven purely by a political motive, and in the attempt<br />
to use this as a way in which they can enforce their views on the Australian people,<br />
then we have to resist it, and we've done so. And the last one, and I know I'm<br />
taking a long t ime in this, and consequently you have to forgive me. Frankly this<br />
is not the way to go about ensuring that the South African people themselves come to<br />
grips with apartheid, solve the problem to the benefit of all people in South Africa.<br />
I think the way we're going about it is bad. It strengthens the very conservative<br />
elements in South Africa and doesn't give the young people and the liberal elements<br />
an opportunity to express themselves quickly.<br />
Of course, Mr. Hawke answers that and it is convincing to many people,<br />
when he says that the rest of the world has cut itself off from South Africa over this<br />
question of apartheid, and then he enumerates all the sports who have done this,<br />
names a number of other bodies and lets it go at that. And that sounds very<br />
convincing, because in fact this has happened, but what is your answer to that? / A </p>
<p>PM My answer to that is that I've just given the answer. We make up our minds<br />
what we think is right and what is the proper way to go about settling a problem of<br />
the kind that I have just mentioned.<br />
Q. Even if it does happen to conflict with what the United Nations or anyone<br />
else has decided?<br />
PM Yes, even though it might conflict with others. Because we're an<br />
independent country, independently minded and we do what we think is right. But<br />
I can only say this, we've adopted exactly the same attitude to the Chinese coming<br />
here. We've adopted the same attitude to the Soviet coming here, we let their<br />
ballet companies and their football teams come. Now their system is abhorrent<br />
to us too, they're tyrannical and dictatorial but we haven't mixed up the two. And<br />
we hope, we can hope in time, and all of us must hope in time, we'll be able to<br />
solve the problems in a way that gives fereedom of choice to the individual, lets<br />
them exercise their own individual consciences, permits them to go about their<br />
lawful business, in a way that is most pleasing and satisfactory to them. And we<br />
don't believe, and I want to emphasise this, in interfering in the business of other<br />
countries. Because whenever others at United Nations, or anywhere else, start<br />
to interfere in ours, we tell them where to get off and we've been remarkably<br />
successful.<br />
Q. There's the element Prime Minister, which is frightening to a lot of people.<br />
The element is blackmail as called by some. We've reason to believe that the same<br />
principles which have been drawn out the power, fight, protesting could be used<br />
in Australia, after August, to force the Government, or persuade the Government,<br />
to do something more for the aborigines. I think you're aware of this.<br />
PM Yes, L am.<br />
Q. Again from the ACTU of course. Now the country doesn't want that to happen.<br />
So drawing out a stage further, have you promises to offer to our own coloured<br />
people?<br />
PM This would take me quite a long time to answer. But can I go back a little<br />
over the history of this problem? Immediately after I became the Prime Minister,<br />
Mr. W. C. Wentworth, the Minister for Social Services, and then in charge of<br />
Aboriginal Affairs, came to me. And he said, the native councils, the aboriginal<br />
councils have asked me if I can get you to agree to 11 reforms, and to take them<br />
up with the Queensland Government, and to get our own Department of the Interior<br />
responsible for the Northern Territory to carry out some reforms too. Within<br />
a matter of days I was able to go up to Queensland, and 9 of the 11 reforms asked<br />
for by Mr. Wentworth, that had been promoted by all of the Aboriginal Councils<br />
in Queensland were agreed to immediately. Two others were not, and I believe<br />
that the changes were made in the interests of the aboriginals themselves. The<br />
two changes that were not immediately adopted were one regarding alcohol<br />
the -free supply of alcohol on the Reserves. And there it was suggested to me, and<br />
agreed to, that the local Aboriginal Councils should have the right of local option.<br />
The second one was relating to those aboriginals who were given control of their own<br />
property by the Queensland Administration, and here vwe agreed that they would<br />
have a form of protection. If found they had been exploited and people had taken<br />
their money away from them, or otherwise exploited them, we would, that's the<br />
e. 9 / 4 </p>
<p>Queensland Government, would administratively ensure that justice was done. So<br />
on each one of the I I cases put to us, we did what we were asked to do, and<br />
recently Mr. Neville Bonner,. who I believe will be a very distinguished member<br />
of the Senate, or he is now a distinguished member of the Senate, he has said<br />
that. their claims have been fulfilled and their requests have been agreed to. So too<br />
in the Northern Territory we've set aside land for them, we've set aside funds.<br />
I wish time was available to me to explain to you what was done but. 1-think most<br />
thinking Australians would agree that we're acting responsibly and fairly, and<br />
when I go home I'll ensure Mr. Ralph Hunt, my Minister for the Interior, makes<br />
another statement to indicate clearly what we've done and the Australian people will<br />
be pretty procud, because they're the ones who are paying through taxation.<br />
Q. We haven't mentioned the name Bob Hawke, or Mr. Hawke at all, but if the<br />
reply to his letter, or the ACTU letter about land rights and so on is not satisfactory<br />
this was the point I was trying to make he gave reason to believe that protests<br />
would be organised again, and black bans and disruption of industry.<br />
PM I think you can take it that there has been a course of action by Mr. Hawke<br />
and those who go along with him. Since I've been the Prime Minister this course of<br />
action has always been in terms of threats and intimidation, and the kind of action<br />
that he's. tried to drum up over the South African sporting tour. Always force to<br />
be used always coercion. But I'd be prepared to make this statement to you, that<br />
Mr. Hawke hasn't a glimmer of knowledg( ElWhat happened in Queensland or in<br />
the Northern Territory. He's concentrated on the Yirr'kala case, and he's been<br />
critical of the judgment of Mr. justice Blackburn. Now Mr. justice Blackburn was<br />
acting as a lawyer. And I believe it is a brilliant judgment and ought to be read<br />
by every thinking citizen. We should not be criticising him, what we should be<br />
doing is looking for worthwhile ways of reform, and when we get sensible suggestions<br />
we will adopt them. I'll see that Mr. Hunt, Minister for the Interior issues another<br />
statement, and I'll be certain that the Australian people will say " Well done. You're<br />
acting as our representatives, but they ' re native Australians, just the same/' Ryone<br />
else, they're entitled to a fair go, and they're entitled to justice and we'll ensure<br />
that they'll get it.<br />
Q. In a moment, Mr. Prime Minister, I'd like to switch topics, but firstly,<br />
just one final apartheid question Have you or other mem bers of the Cabinet perhaps,<br />
had any discussions with top Ministers in the South African Nationalist Government<br />
over the question of apartheid, and particularly over the question of these tours?<br />
PM Not that I'm aware of, but I have written to the South African Prime<br />
Minister, and I've informed him of the views of the Australian people, because<br />
I said they were bitterly disappointed when the ban was imposed upon native South<br />
Africans that's coloured South Africans taking part in the tour. But we haven't<br />
had any personal discussions with them, face to face. : They know our views anyhow,<br />
they know our dislike of apartheid, and they know that we'd like a much more liberal<br />
system introduced, and equality introduced there as soon as it was practicable.<br />
Q. All this then has thrown into highlight a whole range of Australia's life.<br />
And here's a good opportunity for pensioners who are watching, and farmers and<br />
others who feel out of it a bit in this country, give some good words for them. 0 </p>
<p>PM Yes, I can. First of all as to the pensioners. I confess immediately, that<br />
I felt that in the last Budget, we had not been -fair to them. And the first action I<br />
took as the Prime Minister was to increase the pension for the married couple and<br />
the single couple too. And I gave also certain assurances relating to the base rate<br />
pensioner, and the changes we would introduce the kind of changes we would<br />
introduce with the next Budget. Naturally I can't tell you exactly what can be done<br />
because I think the Budget has to remain secret. But nonetheless this is one of the<br />
problems we have to give careful attention to. As to both the woolgrower and other<br />
sections of Primary Industry.<br />
Q. Mr. McMahon may I interrupt you just for a moment....<br />
PMV Yes, of course you can.<br />
Q. Mr. Wentworth's statement then about the superannuation scheme is<br />
a very much long-term plan.<br />
PM Well, look I haven't read what Mr. Wentworth has said, and I understand<br />
that on radio today, television anyhow, he has said that he'd been misunderstood.<br />
I wouldn't like to make a comment about superannuation until I hear from him. But<br />
what I can say is that there is no Bill before the Government, and we have no<br />
proposals, at present before the Government, that I know of, relating to<br />
superannuation. But nonetheless, I come back to what I said My funda mental<br />
responsibility is to look after the more needy sections, and I regard that as the<br />
paramount objective of Government.<br />
Q. Farmers then?<br />
PM On farmers what we have done and I took a leading role in this myself<br />
was to ensure that the strongest interdepartmental committee we could get together<br />
would look at the problems of the wool industry, and of rural industries in general<br />
or those rural industries who want or who are in need of assistance. I understand<br />
the papers are just about completed, and we will set aside a special Cabinet meeting<br />
to consider them. This should be done within the course of the next two to three weeks.<br />
Q! Might I mention Vietnam? It's not so long ago Mr. Prime Minister, that<br />
moratorium marchers stirred the same sort of scenes that we're now seeing with<br />
apartheid. But now people seem to be accepting them fairly peacefully. And in fact,<br />
almost saying, Well perhaps we were wrong, perhaps we should get out of Vietnam<br />
generally speaking, the allies, right now. And certainly Labor is making a lot<br />
of capital out off this. What's your attitude?<br />
PM My attitude is a clear one. I've stated before why we are in Vietnam. And<br />
-if you'd like me to refer to the principles involved I'll mention them now. I believe<br />
we're taking the correct attitude. -What we are doing is trying to ensure that the<br />
people of South Vietnam have the right to determine their own future? We want to<br />
determine our own future why shouldn't they have the right. And I believe we've<br />
been remarkably successful Who would have thought two years ago that South<br />
Vietnam would soon be able to stand on its own feet. To be able to protect itself.<br />
To be able to give their citizens the right of choice in the same way as ours have<br />
got the right of choice too. But Vietnamisation is being successful, and our own<br />
role is steadily diminishing. We've already withdrawn one battalion. The Americans<br />
are withdrawing their forces quickly too. </p>
<p>Q. Are you impressed by the latest Viet Gong offer?<br />
PM I haven't read I've read it and I haven't been able to give it enough<br />
consideration to be able to be precise about it, to be definitive. I can't do that just<br />
yet.<br />
Q. Seems to be impressing the American Government, if we can believe the<br />
reports we're getting. They seem to be accepting the Viet Gong as being at last<br />
realistic, and perhaps genuine, in saying that they will allow American troops to be<br />
handed over, prisoners of war that is, providing American troops withdraw in<br />
other words the whole thing simultaneously. Now this seems to be impressing<br />
President Nixon...<br />
PM Well I have to go this far. I didn't get that impression from the cables<br />
that I've received. But I don't want to be precise because I only received the cable<br />
rather late last night, and you know you can't read them,. and give an immediate<br />
judgment about them. But if we could get to the stage when the North Vietnamese<br />
will say " We will leave the South Vietnamese alone", and we could get assurances<br />
that there would be freedom for both the North and for the South, well then of course<br />
we'd want to get out as quickly as we could and we'd want to give aid and assistance<br />
programmes to the South Vietnamese so that they could build up their standards<br />
of living, so that they could give their own people the opportunity to have the kind<br />
of life that we'd want for them.<br />
Q. I wonder whether you've been in touch with the United States recently about<br />
further withdrawals. That there's a chance that more of our troops will be<br />
coming home soon?<br />
PM I have had, since I've been the Prime Minister, under constant review the<br />
problem of the withdrawal of Australian troops. And the Defence Committee keeps<br />
it under constant review on behalf of the Government. We will, as soon as we've<br />
made up our minds what we're to do, announce it to the Australian people, most<br />
probably in Parliament, because Parliament will be sitting at the time when we'll<br />
make our decision. I've been watching the problem carefully, I've been asking<br />
myself the problem when can we get out of Phuoc Thuy Proviyice, when will the<br />
South Vietnamese there be able to look after themselves?~ Based upon all the facts,<br />
and the implications that are put to me, we'll make up our minds what we're to do.<br />
I want to assure you that of course it's our objective to get out. The problem is<br />
one of timing when we can do it, and above all when we car, give the South<br />
Vietnamese the opportunity to live in peace and in freedom.<br />
Q. Now Labor is saying " We told you so", Mr. Prime Minister, and making<br />
-capital out of recent revelations from America published by American newspapers.<br />
And to some this might be seen as a way of damaging your image at the ne-xt<br />
Federal poll. Could it?<br />
PM Well I don't believe that. Labor will of course jump on a bandwaggon and<br />
say " I told you so". But Labor never thought that South Vietnam could be preserved<br />
as an independent and free coury. They wanted to get out and to let them be<br />
overrun by the North. In other words they were prepared to have a tyrannical<br />
and dictatorial government in North Vietnam dominate the freedom of the people<br />
of South Vietnam. We're not lik-e this. Australians traditionally have fought in </p>
<p>the cause of freedom World Wars I and 11 in the case of Malaysia, in the case<br />
of South Korea and South Vietnam. And now that victory is there and we're giving<br />
the South Vietnamese the opportunity of freedom, surely we just don't want to run<br />
out now run out on them now, and ensure that the North Vietnamese have a better<br />
chance than they should be, given. But this doesn't really matter. The point is<br />
Vietnamisation has been successful, and as soon as we find that the South<br />
Vietnamese can protect Phuoc Thy Province themselves, of course as soon as that<br />
happens, and it won't be too far distant either, as soon as that happens of course<br />
we'll go through our proposals for withdrawal of Australian troops and announce<br />
them to the Australian people.<br />
Q. I'm not sure Prime Minister, whether after having been involved with all<br />
the finer detail of Government and Australia's policy in the whole range of life,<br />
whether you step back every now and again and look at the general picture.<br />
Certainly with regard to the democratic system, the international scene, who we're<br />
going to be friendly with next, or with whom we can be friendly. First the<br />
democratic principle in this country. Are we too cumbersome? Are elections as<br />
we conduct them now, and elected Governments and so on, an anachronism in our<br />
way of life? Isn't there something better we could have?<br />
PM No I don't think so. I happen to be a liberal democrat and I have fought<br />
for liberal democracy ever since I've been in Parliament. This is the greatest<br />
goal one of the greatest goals we can fight for, apart from making certain that<br />
none of our people go short of all the things that are necessary in order to survive,<br />
and to give them the opportunities of a better life too. But I'm sure you'll achieve<br />
your purposes far more easily and quickly under a democratic system of government<br />
than by permitting some element of tyranny to creep in.<br />
Q. But we can't exist as an island. And although we were in Asia a pretty good<br />
example of a liberal democratic system, we know that we've got to deal with<br />
other countries...<br />
PM Yes.<br />
Q. And it seems more and more there's an insistence that our political<br />
system should be aligned with their political system. And if there's a growing<br />
tendency to national socialism in the world, doesn't this put us in a precarious<br />
position?<br />
PM I don't think it does, because I think we'll do ever so much better as a<br />
liberal democracy than we would do with the kind of system that would be forced<br />
on us if Mr. Hawke and people like him, dominate the Labor Party, and compel<br />
us or try and compel us to introduce -the systems of socialism or even of communism.<br />
Q. What's the best thing to fight it then? Is it education, or is it simply a<br />
liberal democratic system ad nauseam almost? Which part of our society can<br />
preserve what we've got now?<br />
PM By keeping a liberal democratic government in power. And it is a<br />
fundamental duty of a liberal democratic government to educate the Australian<br />
people and keep them informed of what they are doing, and why they are doing it.<br />
0,9 0 / 8 </p>
<p>And similarlytoo, and you obviously recognise this because of the questions you<br />
asked at the beginning of this discussion you pointed out, or implicit in what you<br />
said to me was the fact that today there is an element that waits tyranny to be<br />
established here, and wants to enforce ft~ will against the wishes at the<br />
Australian people. When you get television of the kind you had here a few days<br />
ago with Mr. Hawke appearing on It,, then that alerts the Australian people of the<br />
dagrsand it ts once they are alerted you can make abnatycertain that they<br />
wor agree to it and they wcm't permit it to be the kind of Government that's<br />
operative in this country.<br />
Q. Are you saying that Mr. Hawke damaged himself from what you saw of<br />
I that Interview we did with him last week, and the Labor cause in this country?<br />
PM I am sure he did. But Ildon't want to comein very much against<br />
Mr. Hawke I'e known him for a long, long time. I was Minister for Labour<br />
for about eight years,, I you know haven't got a very great regard for him, but<br />
I'd rather leave him out of it and draw attention to the Issues In sight and thp<br />
political issues.....<br />
Q. In terms of life and deathMr. Prime Minister,, perhaps of far greater<br />
problems even than Vietnam I mean~ for examplej we see the enormous death<br />
toll on our roads here which makeathe Vietam toll pae into almost Insiginficance.<br />
Is there anything that you have in mind to perhaps do about that nationally?<br />
PM * There are several things that we have done When I was the Treasurer<br />
wihwasn't very long ago, we decided that we would give a very big increase in<br />
the grants for roads to the State Governments to let them have a better road system<br />
In this country. I think the phrase I then coined -an addtuioi~ dhalf<br />
a billion it is a catchy phrase, but catchy phrases are rather good these days<br />
we gave them half a billion In order, over a period of three to five years to be able<br />
to better the roads system of this country and so to reduce the toll. For the rest<br />
of it such as seat belts and control ot the roads and safety measures that can be<br />
taken, these reside within the field of the State Governments.<br />
Q. Would you personally like to see seat belts compulsory all over Australia?<br />
PM I don't mind. I don't thinklIknow enough about itto be able tobe precise.<br />
But If the safety authorities think it is desirable then I believe we should enact the<br />
laws to make them necessary -and rd be one of the first to admit thatif they want<br />
it done it ought to be done.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, time goes by very very quickly. But again in order to<br />
improve the country roads, Vietnam, labour relationships I was trying to fish<br />
in the previous question towards education I was thinking that In our country most<br />
of the-money ough to be spent perhaps on education. And more and more and<br />
more for my children, for your children. Do you agree?<br />
PM You can never spend enough on education. But I think you have to take<br />
a balanced view as to where the money should be spent. Well first of all we must<br />
remove pockets of poverty wherever we can. We must see that we've got a<br />
first class and? an improving health system. We must have increasingly better<br />
education because we've got a wonderful lot ot people with pretty high K~ s native<br />
intelligence of the highest order. And I say this as a man who's travelled the<br />
world and knows the capacity of the Australian in comparison with others.<br />
Arnd of cwre We then-have to make our provtsion for defence. Bu~ t what we always<br />

have to remember, is that we are not a very big country, and we have to act<br />
within the limitations of our natural and physical resources and our people. What<br />
we want to do is to ensure thcat we get that happy blending that blending that<br />
means that it's in the best interests of the Australian people as a whole. And we<br />
will increasingly give a greater advance, a greater amount of money for education.<br />
I think you know that only a few years ago we did give the States enormously<br />
increased advances what they call general revenue grants. And out of that we<br />
hope they'll be able to develop a better education system.<br />
Q. If we had a federal election any time between now and the arrival say of<br />
the Springbok cricket team.-do you believe that you could win on one simple<br />
platform law and order who's running this country myself the Prime Minister<br />
and his Government or the ACTU lead by Bob Hawke?<br />
PM It' my own belief tha: if we had an election today we would win at least<br />
two seats in Western Aust:--' Uia, and we would win seats in very nearly every other<br />
State as wellwnnn at Least three in New South Wales. So it does show that<br />
the Australian people are interested in the problem of public order, they are<br />
interested in ensuring that a truly democratic system is protected and they want<br />
the right of freedom of choic~ e within the law themselves. In other words we're a<br />
pretty responsible and decent community and we don't want thelarrikin few the<br />
demagogue or the brash we don't want them to be telling us what we're to do.<br />
Q. And this suggests that you should have an election quick and lively.<br />
Q. Why not today?<br />
PM Well, you know you can't have elections in a matter of days. I once, if<br />
I could now make a simple confession to you, did contemplate one shortly after<br />
I became the Prime Minister. I felt, well, this was the day. But we weren't very<br />
well organised, and there were other views, that felt it was too soon after<br />
becoming the Prime Minister, too precipitate, and of course I thought about it, but<br />
never got to the stage where a decision had to be made. But if I had I know what<br />
the consequences would have been. It would have been a very, very unhappy day<br />
for the Labor Party, and an extremely unhappy day for the socialist left, and for<br />
those who Mr. Hawke told what he should do during the course of the last few<br />
weeks.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you.<br />
PM Thank you too. </p>
