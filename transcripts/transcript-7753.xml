PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENc, UTILUX FACTORY, SYDNEY<br />
SEPTEMBER 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, I believe you've invited the Raiders<br />
over tomorrow night.<br />
PM: Yes, they'll be coming over, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, three banks have suggested that<br />
the Government drop its 13.5% interest rate ceiling.<br />
Do you see any value in that?<br />
PM: I see they've made the suggestion but I'm not talking<br />
about monetary policy on the run here.<br />
JOURNALIST: What did you think of yesterday's game?<br />
PM: 1 thought it was a great game. I think it was one<br />
of the great all-time finals. It had everything. It<br />
had the toughness, the directness, the physical clashes<br />
of rugby league, but it also had great character I think.<br />
The Raiders more of the play in the first half but<br />
were well behind and then they fought back. To get that<br />
equalising score just a minute and a half before the end<br />
and then get it in the play-on period was just something<br />
very special.<br />
JOURNALIST: The banks seem determined to raise interest<br />
rates despite your appeal last week<br />
PM: I don't know where you get it that they seem determined<br />
to do it. They were certainly talking about it. We'll<br />
see what happens.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think they're being greedy if they<br />
are, given your appeal last week?<br />
PM: I'm not making any comments about that. I'll be<br />
talking with the Treasurer tomorrow when I get back to<br />
Canberra. I don't want to make any comments on the run<br />
about moneta. ry policy. </p>
<p>2<br />
JOURNALIST: On an associated matter Mr Hawke, Mr Elliott<br />
has suggested the Australian dollar is too high. Do you<br />
see any merit in that one?<br />
PM: Mr Elliott on matters international which he's talking<br />
about can be regarded as having no basis for recognition<br />
at all but can be tested by the fact that he is economically<br />
illiterate and racially offensive. Because he said that<br />
Australia should Join the European market, the European<br />
community which in itself is an absurdity but his<br />
offensive remark said, he said ' after all they've taken<br />
in Turkey. If they'll take in Turkey, anyone can be a<br />
member.' Now that's the character of Mr Elliott's understanding<br />
that we here could join the European community and his<br />
comments about Turkey. I mean Mr Elliott should stick<br />
to his business of making money. He seems to do that<br />
pretty effectively.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you believe hie's a racist?<br />
PM: I didn't say that. I said that I found his remarks<br />
offensive about Turkey.<br />
JOURNALIST: About your meeting tomorrow with Mr Keating.<br />
Is there anything the Government can do to exert pressure<br />
on the banks to keep their interest rates down..<br />
PM: We'll talk about It tomorrow and Just see what our<br />
perception&amp; are of where things are going. I'm not talking<br />
about what we're going to be doing in that discussion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are there things that you could be<br />
PM: Look, I've said three times I'm not making comments<br />
on monetary policy on the run, and even for a good persuasive<br />
questioner like you my friend I'm not going to.<br />
