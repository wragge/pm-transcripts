STATDEEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE MYN P. J. KEATING MP<br />
CST CONFUSION HKWSON MUST RELEASE COLE COMMITTEE REPRT<br />
For the Past three days the Opposition Leader and his<br />
frontbench have failed in spectacular fashion trying to<br />
explain how the GST will work.<br />
They have confirmed the comunxity's doubts about the GET and<br />
highlighted even more anomalies in the system.<br />
Dr Howson has maid he will spend 18 months aftern the election<br />
explaining the GST to the community. This is not good enough.<br />
People have a right to know before they vote how the GST will<br />
affect them personally and how it will affect small business.<br />
I want Dr Hewson to be heard. I want Australians to hear him<br />
In total silence. I want Australians to hear him try to<br />
explain the unexplainable and make sense of the senseless.<br />
I want to hear him say why a 15 per cent tax slug is good for<br />
them. why abolishing Medicare is good for them. Why the<br />
laoro youth is worthf Sfiiihour.<br />
Dr Hewson wants to look people in the eye and tell them bad is<br />
good. Dr Hewson is fond of saying he will look people in the eye.<br />
I now call upon him to truly look the Australian people in the<br />
eye by releasing the Cole Committee<br />
recommendations and the Su~ bmissions put to that committee.<br />
If he doesn't people will be right in concluding that Dr<br />
Howson wants to hide the full Story Of the GST.<br />
If he doesn't release the report and the submissions made to<br />
the Committee it will be because it shows the GST to be not<br />
only unfair, but absurd.<br />
Nowhere is this better illustrated than with food.<br />
Since Fightbacc Mark II, the Opposition has been proposing to<br />
zero rate certain food for home consumption other than<br />
takeaway food.<br />

<p>What does that moan for something like the Australian pie?<br />
In Canada if you buy a Cold meat pie, it's not taxed. But if<br />
you buy a hot meat pie, it's taxed. The same is true for the<br />
UK. So if You buy a cold moat__ pie and take it home and heat it up.<br />
you only pay GST on tiheelectricity or gas to heat it. But If<br />
you buy a hot meat pie and take it home and re-heat it, you<br />
pay tax on the pie as well as the electricity or gas.<br />
What about an apple pie? In Canada, it depends on whether it<br />
Is hot or cold. If it is hoft thanit in taxable. If it is<br />
cold, then it depends how big It is and ho-wmany you buy. If<br />
you buy one Individual cold apple pie, you pay GST. If you<br />
buy five individual cold apple pies, you pay GST on them. But<br />
if you buy six or more at once, then they will be GST free.<br />
If you buy a family size cold apple pie and take it home, then<br />
it is GST free.<br />
In the United Kingdom, it depends on where you intend to * at<br />
the coldapi pie.-If you sit down at a table at the bakery,<br />
then you pay tax on the pie. If you intend to take It home<br />
then it is tax free.<br />
Dr Hewson hasn't told us exactly~ how he intends to tax pies,<br />
but the Canadian and British examples provide a good guide on<br />
the ludicrous nature of his tax.<br />
Dr Howson's GST is an absurdity tor small1 business,<br />
particularly small business in the takeaway food industry.<br />
These small businesses will not only carry the fully<br />
compliance cost of this tax, they will also have to Cary the<br />
additional burden of dividing their sales into food and<br />
takeaway food items.<br />
On top of that a 15 per cent GST on what they sell will<br />
depress sales.<br />
Par from strengthening small business as Dr Hewson claims, his<br />
GST will force small business to lay off staff to cope with<br />
the higher costs and lower demand.<br />
Dr Howson ignores the takeawey food industry. In fact in<br />
Australia, more than 25 per cent of household expenditure on<br />
food Is on takeaway and restaurant food and more than half of<br />
this is on takeaways. It is therefore totally misleading to<br />
claim am the Opposition does that Dr Howson's GST exempts<br />
food. Food is but one area of massive confusion over the GST. If Dr<br />
Hewson does not release the Cole Committee report the<br />
Australian people will be right in concluding that there are<br />
many more.<br />
