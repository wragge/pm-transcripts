The Gillard Labor Government today released the 2011 Productivity Commission Report, Caring for Older Australians.</p>
<p>The Government thanks the Productivity Commission for their final report, which provides analysis of the aged care sector and detailed proposals for aged care reform. The recommendations in the report will be considered as part of the Government's broader ageing agenda.</p>
<p>The Government will develop its response to the report's recommendations guided by four overarching principles:</p>
<p> * 	First, every older Australian has earned the right to be able to access quality care and support that is appropriate to their needs, when they need it.<br />
 * 	Secondly, older Australians deserve greater choice and control over their care arrangements than the system currently provides.<br />
 * 	Thirdly, funding arrangements for aged care need to be sustainable and fair, both for older Australians and for the broader community.<br />
 * 	And finally, older Australians deserve to receive quality care from an appropriately skilled workforce.</p>
<p>The Government is determined to begin to make the necessary reforms to our aged care system in this term of government as part of a broader ageing agenda.</p>
<p>The Government will seek the views of the community as it develops its response to the final report. Minister Butler will tour the country to engage in conversations with the broader community about care and support for Australians as they age.</p>
<p>The Government will also engage with industry stakeholders through their peak bodies, the National Aged Care Alliance and the Ageing Consultative Committee.</p>
<p>With older Australians leading longer, healthier and more prosperous lives than ever before, it's essential that government looks carefully at how to provide the best possible care and support for older Australians.</p>
<p>There is huge potential to provide older Australians with greater choice and control over their lives than has been afforded by the system in the past. We are also focused on ensuring older Australians are provided the ability to age with dignity and security.</p>
<p>The release of the Commission's report will form an important part of the national conversation about how to promote opportunities for healthy and positive ageing.</p>
