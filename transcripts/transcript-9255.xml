TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH RAY MARTIN, A CURRENT AFFAIR, CHANNEL NINE<br />
14 JUNE, 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
RM: Prime Minister, welcome home. You have come back to a barrage, a<br />
media release today from the Leader of the Opposition saying the<br />
Keating Government is in a shambles, it is about time you showed<br />
some leadership.<br />
PM: Yes, well that's what they all say. That's what they all say, Ray. I<br />
mean, as you know on my European trip I met a lot of the leaders of<br />
Western Europe, I mean, nobody there had 5 per cent growth, 1 per<br />
cent inflation and 3.5 per cent employment growth. When they hear<br />
those numbers they say, " Well, gee, if only we could have that". That<br />
is the sort of problem that I am quite sure that Alexander Downer would<br />
love to be wrestling with.<br />
RM: All right, well let's borrow a phrase from Mr Downer, did the grovelling<br />
with the Europeans work?<br />
PM: Well the point is, you see, this gets back to Mr Downer's view of the<br />
world, which was Mr Fraser's view of the world, and Mr Menzies view<br />
of the world, that Australia should stay at home. You have a country<br />
ringed by a high tariff wall, you don't have foreign investment in, and<br />
you don't have foreign investment by Austraiians dbrbd. That's their<br />
view. Whereas the view the Government has had is that you become<br />
a competitive country, which we now are, and you go out to the world<br />
and you take positions in it, and you invest in it. What has happened<br />
to us in Western Europe is, I think, particularly in continental Europe,<br />
they don't know enough about the modern Australia. They don't know<br />
how we have progressed, how we have become independent as we<br />
have been in an economic sense, how we are now back to a high rate </p>
<p>of growth, low inflation, and how we have made this cultural change to<br />
the rest of the world.<br />
RM: But Prime Minister, the French are pretty sophisticated, as we all know,<br />
they would realise that we have liberty, equality and fraternity in<br />
Australia, they would know we were independent, you don't have to tell<br />
them that.<br />
PM: Yes they know that, they also think, particularly the French, that<br />
Australia is basically a sub-club of Britain.<br />
RM: That's an old fashion, do they really think that? I mean, does the<br />
President think that, does the Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Part of the point of me going there was to say, " well hang on, let me<br />
bring you up to date." Australia is not a mono-culture, it is now a plural<br />
society, it is outward going, it is internationally competitive, it is making<br />
structures for itself at home and abroad. I talked about APEC and the<br />
Asia Pacific and President Mitterand said to me, " I have never heard<br />
an Australian talk this way before." Let me repeat from the horses<br />
mouth, Ray, Francois Mitterand said to me, " I have never heard an<br />
Australian speak this way before."<br />
RM: But he would be briefed, the same as you are briefed before someone<br />
comes here. He would know as much as you are going to tell him,<br />
wouldn't he?<br />
PM: But it is not the briefing, people live by impressions. They live by their<br />
own life experiences and they live by what they know. I mean, we<br />
could all pick up a piece of briefing paper, I mean, I went to see him<br />
and I could get a briefing paper about him and his Government, or<br />
about his country, but it is not like talking to him, and that's the value of<br />
going.<br />
RM: So, is this why you raised the issue of the republic there?<br />
PM: Well, amongst other things, simply to say that Australia has now<br />
changed its orientation from the ' 60s and ' 70s from an inward looking<br />
closed place, to an outward looking confident place, that we pull the<br />
tariff barriers. down, that we have made a big shift to exports, that we<br />
are a multicultural plural society, and I said the Governmnent policy is to<br />
reflect this by moving towards a republic by the year 2000.<br />
RM: Did you expect to get the grovelling, cringing, sucking up to the French<br />
attacks?<br />
PM: Well, I suppose I did. But I mean, you always get that from people who<br />
have basically always shied away from dealing with the rest of the<br />
world. And the thing about the Alexander Downers of this world, and </p>
<p>the Malcolm Erasers and the Bob Menzies is they kept Australians at<br />
home, and the consequence was that we have fallen from having the<br />
second largest income per capita in the Western World to number 18<br />
by 1983. We just kept simply back as that rest of the world moved on.<br />
RM: But then whatever happened to the so-called London convention? The<br />
idea that you don't raise domestic issues when you are overseas,<br />
clearly the republic is a hot domestic issue?<br />
PM: That was only something Bob Hawke said to suit a particular<br />
circumstance at the time. The London convention isn't anything.<br />
RM: So it is fair game. If you are overseas you can call Mr Downer two<br />
faced, anything you like?<br />
PM: Well you see Mr Downer was over here saying he wants clean politics,<br />
while he is trying to link Graham Richardson with prostitutes in the<br />
Senate. He is saying he -wants-an-' economically reformed country<br />
while he is saying we shouldn't have foreign investment. And I just<br />
thought it was time to point those inconsistencies out.<br />
RM: But isn't this a bit rich from a bloke like you who, in the one sense,<br />
wants to get rid of the monarchy, but then accepts a ride on the royal<br />
yacht Britannia to look at the Normandy re-enactment?<br />
PM: Of course not. I am the Australian Prime Minister, I was invited by the<br />
Government of Britain.<br />
RM: As against the Queen. It is the Queen's yacht isn't it?<br />
PM: And the Government of France. And the Queen as Head of State of<br />
Britain was involved in those ceremonies. So, anyway I don't accept to<br />
be I noticed some journalist said, " Oh isn't it shocking, Mr Keating is<br />
talking about a republic after enjoying the Queens hospitality."<br />
Apparently if you have a cup of tea and a scone, that's it, she has got<br />
you for life.<br />
RM: But if you call Alexander Downer two faced and then turn around and<br />
do that, aren't you guilty of the same crime?<br />
PM: I don't follow you.<br />
RM: Well if you say that you want to get rid of the monarchy, and in the<br />
same breath you say, yes, I will have a ride on the Royal Yacht<br />
Britannia?<br />
PM: I don't think there is any inconsistency there at all. I have said this to<br />
the Queen directly. Remember I met the Queen in Scotland, in<br />
Balmoral a year ago, and had a long and frank conversation with her </p>
<p>about how Australia could no longer make its way as a sort of society it<br />
has become with the Head of State of another country. I made that<br />
clear. And I said to her that itzwas the Government's policy that we<br />
should move towards a republic by the year 2000. And you might<br />
remember the Queen authorised me to say that these were matters for<br />
the Australian people and she would accept the advice of our<br />
Ministers, and you might remember, Ray, that Prince Charles said<br />
much the same thing when he came to Australia. This is a matter for<br />
Australians, and why shouldn't they have such a debate he said. In<br />
fact the Queen knows exactly where I stand on this.<br />
RM: She still invites you on the yacht?<br />
PM: The meetings I have had with her have always been absolutely first<br />
class.<br />
RM: Are the fl. g_ and the republic as one, are they combined? Do they<br />
have to go together?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so. But were Australia to become a republic, you will<br />
probably see a manifestation of that in all of its symbols, including the<br />
flag.<br />
RM: Are you still sticking to the target of the year 2000 for a republic?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
RM: And what about the flag, is there a timetable for that?<br />
PM: No, I mean, I have got an opinion on the flag, but I don't have a plan<br />
for the flag.<br />
RM: What's your opinion? How close to your heart is a new Australian<br />
flag?<br />
PM: Well, whenever I'm asked I always say what I've said before and that<br />
is, that I don't think that I mean, this was essentially, the flag we had<br />
was essentially the flag of the British Merchant Navy, to which we<br />
added some stars for the Southern Cross. There was a very<br />
interesting article in today's Australian making that very point.<br />
RM: What about the nervous nellies as you like to call them in the Labor<br />
party the flag waiverers. Are you being told by anybody to back off<br />
on the flag issue?<br />
PM: No, not by anybody. But, you see Ray<br />
RM: Malcolm Turnbull says that he told you that. That he asked you to<br />
please move away. </p>
<p>PM: I can't recall Malcolm saying this to me, but whether he did or not<br />
doesn't move heaven and earth-Look, the fact of the matter is that<br />
Australia is an independent, plural country. It is now economically<br />
competitive, we've made a huge shift to exports, we've changed the<br />
culture of business in the work place, we are a much more dynamic<br />
society and we've made great linkages into Asia and, indeed, into<br />
northern America and to western Europe. It just follows that one can't<br />
go on in the future marketing Australia saying that we are an<br />
independent place while our head of state is the head of another<br />
country. In fact, just in passing coming back in the plane reading the<br />
British Economist, in an article about Australia it just said in the last<br />
line, not with any great fanfare, but just as an attitude from a journalist<br />
only colonies continue to borrow the monarchies of other lands<br />
Now, Australia is not a colony, but we are still borrowing the monarchy<br />
of another land.<br />
RM: What about Bob Hawke's suggestion that the new flag and the republic<br />
are inevitable, but there is no need to divide the nation.<br />
PM: Well, I don't think it divides the nation. I think it is an issue, it's a good<br />
sound cultural issue for this country to actually declare itself a republic.<br />
It is something that would make the country not only feel better about<br />
itself, but be better.<br />
RM: But what about if a majority of Australians right now don't want that?<br />
PM: Well, we are not going to have it now.<br />
RM: But to the year 2000?<br />
PM: Well, I think the majority will.<br />
RM: And will we have a new flag then too?<br />
PM: Well, the Government has no plans to bring in any legislation other<br />
than as I've said in the past. First of all we have no plans to do it.<br />
Secondly, only when there is popular support for it. But again, don't<br />
under estimate Ray, the fact that the Olympics are coming up in the<br />
year 2000 and the whole sense of nationhood and national pride is<br />
going to be there, let alone the changes we've made in the last 10 or<br />
12 years.<br />
RM: Do you fear at all that the flag and the republic are going to be major<br />
issues in the next election campaign?<br />
PM: Well, I think, it is Mr Downer who fears they might.<br />
RM: You'll be quite happy if they were? </p>
<p>PM: Remember this, leaning towards the republic was part of my policy<br />
speech in the 1993 election.-<br />
RM: But it wasn't an issue, the GST was the only issue then. But now if<br />
they make this a prime issue, does that worry people in the Labor<br />
party?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think so, no. Let me tell you this, as sure as you and I are<br />
speaking here Ray, Australia will become a republic. Now, sensible<br />
people in the Liberal party like Nick Greiner say this any day you want<br />
to ask them, the only discussion is about the timing. What Alexander<br />
Downer is saying is no, we should keep the monarchy of Great Britain<br />
as our head of state.<br />
RM: Have you seen a flag design that you like, a new flag design?<br />
PM: I haven't, no.<br />
RM: Not up tonow?<br />
PM: No, I mean I don't take any notice of flag competitions. There is a lot<br />
of them.<br />
RM: But clearly the point that Malcolm Turnbull and others make is that it is<br />
hard to sell anything if you don't have something to show people. If<br />
you can't say this is the flag we should have.<br />
PM: That's probably -right, but I'm not out there selling a flag. Let me just<br />
repeat the point. I have an opinion about the flag, but I don't have a<br />
plan for the flag.<br />
RM: What would you like to see on the flag?<br />
PM: Well, I've never really refined my own thoughts about it.<br />
RM: Kangaroo? Southern Cross? Emu? Didgeridoo?<br />
PM: I don't think so, but I've never seen a design that actually suits me.<br />
But, the key point is this Ray, Australia is now a modem plural society<br />
with an inflation rate of 1 per cent and 5 per cent growth, we in this<br />
country are doing something right. All of us. We've made a great leap<br />
into the Asia Pacific, we are now setting up structures like APEC. -In<br />
other words we are remodelling Australia inside and we are<br />
remodelling, recasting it from the outside. It is untenable to wander<br />
around then saying, oh by the way, excuse us, we'ye done all these<br />
things, but by the way our head of state is the monarch of another<br />
country. </p>
<p>RM: Let's go to some of those things, on the front page of the papers today<br />
the report that the Government is looking at a radical plan to make<br />
elderly and chronically ill peopletin Australia pay more for Medicare or<br />
for health care. Is that true.<br />
PM: No basis to it. Carmen Lawrence debunked that today.<br />
RM: Absolutely no basis?<br />
PM: No basis.<br />
RM: What about a wealth tax?<br />
PM: There was no basis for that. I noticed that Duncan Kerr one of my<br />
ministerial colleagues was reported as referring to that over the week<br />
end. He never did. In fact, I don't know where that came from.<br />
RM: So, he didn't refer to it?<br />
PM: He didn't even refer to it.<br />
RM: No reference to the rich actually being taxed heavier?<br />
PM: No, what he said was that Australia was going to have to keep an eye<br />
on its revenue base. But he never talked about wealth taxes or<br />
inheritance taxes of any kind.<br />
RM: But that's widely reported?<br />
PM: I know, amazingly.<br />
RM: Well, can you do a George Bush and say'read by lips, no new taxes?'<br />
PM: Well, certainly not those taxes.<br />
RM: Certainly not, maybe some other taxes?<br />
PM: No, no, just that what the Government Ray, what the Government<br />
has done just less than a year ago is give major income tax cuts,<br />
reductions in tax.<br />
RM: So, how are you going to pay for things? What about privatisation?<br />
Are you going to sell off 49 per cent of Telecom?<br />
PM: No, but that is not to say we won't sell some things.<br />
RM: Telecom, part of Telecom? </p>
<p>PM: No, what we are thinking of is the Federal Airports Corporation and<br />
' Australian National Line and in this year we will be selling Qantas and<br />
last year part of the Commonwealth Bank. I mean, the Commonwealth<br />
is always acquiring assets, it's got to sell some too, particularly where<br />
we think they can be more advantageously managed by the private<br />
sector.<br />
RM: But, can you rule out tonight selling off any part of Telecom?<br />
PM: It has never been on our agenda Ray.<br />
RM: And is not, all right. Now, what about an old mate of yours the old<br />
Labor stalwart Jack Ferguson, said at the weekend, it's still a case of<br />
us against them, the workers against the millionaires. Do you agree<br />
with that sentiment?<br />
PM: Well, Australia has right at the moment the highest profit share it's ever<br />
had in its history. That's the highest share of national income going to<br />
profits. It has no historical precedent. So, therefore, the notion that<br />
the Labor party is sort of somehow run by the politics of envy against<br />
people who invest is wrong. Now, it is a minority view now and I think<br />
it has always been a minority view.<br />
RM: So, it's not us against them?<br />
PM: Of course not. If it ever is, we'll never develop as a country probably.<br />
RM: Is privatisation, just quickly getting back to that, is that going to be a<br />
major issue, a battle ground for the Labor party in Hobart at the<br />
national conference?<br />
PM: You'll always have these, I mean, you've been reporting national<br />
conferences of the Labor party for years and most people in public life<br />
have. Every two years we have a national conference. Every two<br />
years we have some matter which gets the focus, or a couple of<br />
matters which get the focus of the debate and no doubt, privatisation<br />
well get a good run for its money.<br />
RM: All right, but you're confident that its not going to split the party?<br />
PM: No, it never does.<br />
RM: All right, a bigger worry then, how close to war are we in Korea?,<br />
PM: I don't think we are close to war. What's happening there is that the<br />
Koreans are defuelling a nuclear reactor the so-called spent or old<br />
fuel rods can be reprocessed for weapon grade material and the<br />
international agency inspecting all this, International Atomic Energy<br />
Agency wants to see that there isn't a diversion of these materials from </p>
<p>spent fuel rods into weapons. Now, the North Korean government<br />
won't allow the inspections and it is that which everybody is upset<br />
about.<br />
RM: But, there appears to be one of those inevitable movements we have<br />
infrequently thankfully, but a movement towards confrontation.<br />
PM: Well, there is an element of confrontation about this, but part of it is, I<br />
think, the United States and others saying unless there is international<br />
inspections here there should be a movement towards some<br />
international sanctions.<br />
RM: Would we be part of that, economic sanctions?<br />
PM: We would be because we believe that there should be curbs upon<br />
nuclear proliferation and weapon proliferation and that all states<br />
should be subject to the scrutinies of the IAEA, particularly states<br />
which are signatories to it.<br />
RM: What about if it became a bilateral sanction between the Japanese<br />
and the Americans. Will we join that?<br />
PM: If there is a set of UN sponsored actions we would join that.<br />
RM: But the Americans, the Japanese acting independently, we wouldn't<br />
join that?<br />
PM: We'd have to see what was proposed, but it would be unlikely.<br />
RM: What about troops, would we commit troops?<br />
PM: I don't think we are at that sort of stage.<br />
RM: Are you in touch with Washington, are they keeping you up to date on<br />
that?<br />
PM: We keep in touch with the developments and have been, but I think,<br />
that the United States wants to move towards some kind of sanctions<br />
and I think, the United Nations will consider that this week.<br />
RM: All right, just quickly while on Asia, there is a copy of Asia-Week<br />
arrived on my desk, someone showed, me with a horoscope, your<br />
horoscope in there. Do you realise that you are a water sheep?<br />
PM: I'm a Capricorn.<br />
RM: Apparently 1944 makes you a water sheep. You are not aware of<br />
that? </p>
<p>PM: I'm not aware of that, no.<br />
RM: Let me just read you what your-horoscope says then. They say that<br />
water sheep are infinitely adaptable and can, if they decide, make their<br />
neighbours love them.<br />
PM: Well, I hope that is a good omen because our neighbours are pretty<br />
important. Not just at home, but abroad.<br />
RM: Well, I thought I should let you know about that as you're about to go<br />
to Indonesia.<br />
PM: I'll tuck that one away Ray.<br />
RM: All right. PM thanks very much for your time.<br />
PM: Good on you Ray, thank you.<br />
