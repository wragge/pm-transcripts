OF'NING OF E: UvIOUTH TO--INSHIP,<br />
r-' S AUTSETPRLANL IA G) RA<br />
16th S1"* EPTEMBER, 1967<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Colonel Murdochi Mr. Premier and Mrs. Brand; Mr. Ambassador;<br />
Fellow M. 1inisters of the Commonwealth Government and State<br />
lvinisters; Eembers of the Par-.-liaments of the Commonwealth<br />
and of the 6tate.; Distinguished Forces representatives of<br />
the Australian and United States Forces and so very many<br />
Distinguished Guests around me; Ladies and Gentlemen; Boys<br />
and Girls: I really, despite that rather imposing introduction,<br />
have a relatively minor part to play in this particular ceremony,<br />
because very properly this is the occasion in which the 1Premier<br />
of the State is the star both attraction and personality.<br />
But having come so many miles and speaking for so many of our<br />
fellow Australians, I know the Premier will allow me to indulge<br />
myself for a few minutes with you, the more particularly as I<br />
think that what I feel or have to say is not without some<br />
continuing advantage for the State which he so ably represents.<br />
It is not very often that I have the opportunity to<br />
come to an official opening in the North WJest of Australia.<br />
This is only my second visit in a long public lifetime. I<br />
hope that thanks to the facilities which an improving V. I. P.<br />
fleet provide for me I'll be here more often. But it has been<br />
several years in between visits and in ' 60 or ' 61 I made my<br />
first, and there was nothing, of course, of this development<br />
here then, nothing of the development which I have been witnessing<br />
in the last few days at Xambalda, at 14' ount Tom Price, at Dampier,<br />
even Port Hedland was in those days not a very exciting port<br />
for one to visit. Eut over these few days of this week I have<br />
developed a new feeling of encouragement and inspiration about<br />
the future of this country, and it is to people like yourselves,<br />
to a Government such as that led by Mr. Brand with his team of<br />
able Ministers, that the rest of Australia which depends so<br />
largely upon the efforts of people who live more remotely from<br />
the great capital cities, who accept their remoteness cheerfully,<br />
who put up with hardships and conditions which would not be<br />
accepted in many instances by those in the capital cities, that<br />
so much of our prosperity and growing national strength have<br />
become due. And so I say first a word of appreciation to you<br />
all. There is a disposition, perhaps, to think of Australia's<br />
pioneering stage as an era of the past. But anybody who has<br />
been around the areas of this State that I have visited in<br />
recent days, is made very conscious that there is a new pioneering<br />
spirit abroad and one which is enriching the nation, strengthening<br />
its capacity to grow in so many different directions. I only<br />
wish that those who are critical of the participation of people<br />
from other countries and after all when you dwell on it<br />
most of that participation comes from the United Kingdom and<br />
the United States, two countries with which we have a great<br />
feeling, of warmth, of kinship and a friendship and whose<br />
ability to merge successfully with us has become a matter of<br />
experience beyond challenge. But if they could sense, as I<br />
have sensed, the growing national strength arising from these<br />
developments, the way in which Australian industry, Australian<br />
enterprise, the technical skills of our country have been<br />
promoted as a result of this process of development, stimulated<br />
by people with, in some instances, a larger vision and a larger<br />
courage in the developmental field thian we have shown ourselves<br />
and contributing from their knowledge and experience to what<br />
we can put to good advantage here in Australia. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Now, in this particular tow,, n of Exmouth, you have a<br />
quite unusual combination. I have been speaking of development<br />
whera we are dealing in matters that come to us from a primaeval<br />
past, the mineral resources which have been down for untold<br />
centuries of time but here in Lxmouth you are reaching out to<br />
the modernity of an outer space era and yet combining it in<br />
circumstances in which you have had to do a pioneering job in<br />
this township itself. For 1Vr. Premier it is no novel experience<br />
to attend an opening of some new area of significance in his<br />
State. To me it is a quite exciting and comparatively rare<br />
event, and I rejoice to be with you here today and take part<br />
in these celebrations because dotted around the State, particularly<br />
the northern part of this State of W.* estern Australia, are names<br />
which were formerly unknown or non-existent but which have now<br />
become part of Australia's story of development and from which<br />
Australia, and an increasingly large body of admiring observers<br />
outside this country, can derive some interest and some satisfaction.<br />
I understand, Mr. *." remier, that my principal task<br />
today is to plant a time capsule. Somebody gave me a list of<br />
the items contained in this capsule. I hasten to add that I<br />
did not make the selection myself but I've no doubt it is of<br />
a discriminating kind ana' for those who are able to open the<br />
capsule at some future point of time, I hope they will derive<br />
both inspiration and interest from our quite energetic endeavours<br />
that have been made to bring this fine township into existence.<br />
It will spell out the history oZf the towln and of the communications<br />
station, the plans of the town and station, it will contain a<br />
letter of good-will from ths Commanding Offficer and from the Civil<br />
Commissioner and to Captain Friedman and to Colonel Iiurdoch<br />
Colonel Murdoch being of course so directly responsible for<br />
the welfare of the town itself. We are delighted to know that<br />
they are going to be immortalized in this way. There will be<br />
the names of the residents I hope they have all earned a<br />
place and will behave themselves in the future to merit it<br />
including the schoolchildren, although we would not want to<br />
curb their normal ebullience or exuberance. There will be<br />
copies of today's newspapers. I suspect that mostly they<br />
will contain leading articles criticising the Commonwealth<br />
Government for not doing enough in one direction or another.<br />
There will be a copy of the WVestern Australian telephone<br />
directory and by the time this capsule is opened, we, will<br />
probably need a battery of telephone books like they have in<br />
New York. There will be private letters from residents to<br />
descendants, seeds of local plants with planting directions<br />
and some shells which will probably be rare in 100 hundred<br />
years' time. So altogether those who open up this capsule<br />
should find much to interest them.<br />
But the final comment I wish to make is that here in<br />
this township we have an embodiment of the partnership between<br />
our two democracies the greatest democracy in size, in power<br />
and economic strength the world has aver known, the United States,<br />
and our own young, thrusting, thriving democracy which we in<br />
our confidence and in our ambition believe will have a major<br />
role to play in this area of the world and perhaps by a force<br />
of our own example with the kind of life we can build together<br />
as a people, provide some encouragement and example for others<br />
who are struggling to achieve the standards which it has been<br />
our good fortune already in Australia to attain.<br />
This is a symbol of a friendship between two peoples<br />
of common heritage of similar ideas in so many aspocts of life,<br />
particularly in the great principles of human freedom, of justice<br />
under the law, of democratic institutions, and of a desire to<br />
live peacefully with our neii-hb ours, thrive and prosper together,<br />
and a willingness to contribute from our own good fortune to </p>
<p>3.<br />
assist others to better standards in the future. And this<br />
quite small township measured in terms of the capital cities<br />
of the nation, embodies that partnership, it maintains a<br />
spirit which I hope in times of difficulty and they will<br />
arise even between two friendly nations will remind us that<br />
here is a part of Australia where our countrymen have shown<br />
they can live together in happiness and to mutual advantage.<br />
May Exmouth long continue to symbolize the Australian/<br />
American alliance and all that our friendship the one with the<br />
other can stand for in relation to the peace, progress and<br />
prosperity of the world. </p>
