PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No.<br />
8 September 1975<br />
INCOME SECURITY REVIEW<br />
The Prime minister, the Hon. E. G. Whitlam, today<br />
announced the terms of reference and the administrative<br />
arrangements for the Income Security Review. Mr Whitlam first<br />
mentioned that the Review would be undertaken in the course of<br />
his Chifley Memorial Lecture which he delivered in Melbourne<br />
on 14 August 1975. The terms of reference for the Review, which<br />
have been agreed to by the Government, are attached.<br />
The Prime Minister said that it had been decided that<br />
the Review would be monitored by a Cabinet Committee of Ministers<br />
comprising himself, the Treasurer, the Minister for Social<br />
Security and minister for Repatriation and Compensation and the<br />
Minister for Labor and Immigration.<br />
Cabinet had agreed that a Committee of officials ( Review<br />
Group) should be drawn from the Department of Social Security, the<br />
Taxation Office, Treasury, the Departments of Repatriation and<br />
Compensation and of Labor and Immigration, the Social Welfare<br />
Commission, and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet,<br />
with assistance from other Departments and authorities as<br />
required. Mr Whitlam said that the Government had decided that<br />
until the Review is completed there should be no new initiatives<br />
or extension of existing policies in the income security area.<br />
Progress of the review will be closely examined at<br />
regular intervals by the Cabinet Committee. By the time of the<br />
1976/ 77 Budget the Government expects to determine its long term<br />
program of reforms and the steps which will need to be progressively<br />
taken to achieve those reforms. ./ 2 </p>
<p>When the Government came to power in 1972 there was<br />
need for immediate improvement in the income security and social<br />
welfare area. Considerable progress has been made to effect that<br />
improvement. Further improvements of a more fundamental kind are<br />
needed. The review process now started will take into consideration<br />
the independent reports already commissioned by the Government.<br />
The Prime Minister said the Review would have regard to<br />
the Government's policies for the abolition of the means test on<br />
age pensions and for the introduction of the National Rehabilitation<br />
and Compensation Scheme covering injuries. In respect of the<br />
latter aspect Mr Whitlam said that the Government was concerned<br />
at the high cost to employers and car-owners of the existing<br />
compulsory schemes for Workers Compensation and Third Party<br />
Insurance and the incomplete, uncertain and time-consuming<br />
remedies for the victims of industrial and highway accidents.<br />
