I I VISIT TO THE U. K. 1969<br />
AUSTRALIA CLUB ADDRESS<br />
GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. JOHN FUIN<br />
AT THE DORCHESTER HOTEL, LONDON<br />
17 JANUARY 1969<br />
Your Royal Highness, the other Lords who were mentioned by the<br />
Toastmaster, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:-<br />
May I first express the great pleasure and the great lifting<br />
in the heart I feel at being in this room with such a distinguished company,<br />
who have come together, as I believe, to demonstrate affection and support<br />
for the country which I lead.<br />
It is indeed a demonstration to warm the heart of any<br />
Australian. But though I come from half a world away, yet I do not stand<br />
here completely as a stranger. As you, Mr. Minister, have said, some<br />
formative years were spent in this country during the course of my edu~ cation<br />
at a college called Brasenose which was then, not noted for learning in any<br />
way at all. But nevertheless judging from the alumni if I may use a word<br />
borrowed from my American wife it does seem to have thrown up a large<br />
number of people leading in a large number of fields, in spite of the fact<br />
that so much of their time was spent either rowing or playing hockey or<br />
engaging in some other enjoyable and agreeable activity.<br />
I was much struck, talking of this kind of agreeable activity,<br />
by the typical British understatement you made, Mr. Minister, when you<br />
said you had thought of Australians as people who just played cricket. I<br />
seem to remember in the course of the years that they played it reasonably<br />
well. Brasenose was not my only early life experience in the United Kingdom.<br />
With a typical politician's desire to make the best of both worlds I engaged<br />
in labouring activities. Indeed the present Lord Tweedsmuir and I shipped<br />
as deckhands on a trawler out of hull and worked our way around the Farao<br />
Islands and back, although at that stage, Sir, it was not absolutely essential<br />
for us to have a union ticket. But we did learn much of this country in that<br />
time, and indeed, to know more perhaps because of that study of history in<br />
which I was engaged at this great university.<br />
It became clear to me, as it must to anyone who studies<br />
history, that it is the British people over the centuries who have internally<br />
and externally engaged in struggle aimed always at seeking to destroy<br />
arbitrary power wherever it may raise its head; who have sought to give<br />
to the individuals who alone are the riches of any country the right fully<br />
to participate in the decisions that their country makes. And from the time<br />
of Cromwell or before, through the Napoleonic wars, through the wars when<br />
at any time absolute and arbitrary power sought to conquer Europe ( which<br />
then was the significant world) it was Britain who stood as the bulwark against<br />
that idea, and this we cart never forget. Nor can we forget, as Australians,<br />
that for nearly two hundred years, we lived in that faraway country completely<br />
under the protection of the British Navy. We had no need to defend ourselves<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>except occasionally when we raised trained bands because it was thought<br />
that Russia might invade us at the time of the Crimean War or something<br />
of that kind history has a habit of repeating itself. And yet the trust,<br />
the faith, the protection, was in the British people and the British Navy.<br />
When the calls came in South Africa, or in the First World War or in the<br />
Second, then naturally we repaid, or sought to repay, that which had been<br />
so generously given to us. And on the whole, I think one can say the books<br />
are reasonably fairly balanced.<br />
We will, I think, as you suggested, Mr. Minister, take more<br />
part in the region in which we live, provide more in the way of defence for<br />
the stability of the regions in which we live. Indeed we have little choice,<br />
but this is not unreasonable and this is not something at which 1, at any<br />
rate, intend to cavill. For we do still revere and we do still uphold those<br />
same institutions of parliamentary democracy, that same reverence for<br />
the rule of law which this country has brought into the world, which you<br />
helped us for so long to retain and which I know should they be threatened<br />
in our own country from some source outside, we could look to you and the<br />
British people to assist us to retain.<br />
So you spoke of the development of Australia, of the<br />
excitement of Australia, of the future of Australia. I would like for a little<br />
while myself to say some words on what I see as a brash, a growing, an<br />
exciting, and exhilarating country; perhaps one of the most exciting and<br />
exhilarating countries in the world, just getting off the launching pad in a<br />
way. Thirty years ago we had a population of 7 million: today we have a<br />
population of 12 million in thirty years we will have a population of 28<br />
million. And thirty years in the life of a nation is but the blinking of an<br />
eyelid and then having attained the population we will go on as I believe to<br />
60, 70 million and be a real power in the world. It will be a power I<br />
hope that will always be exercised for good and always be exercised in<br />
conjunction with the British Government of the United Kingdom itself.<br />
There has been an " explosion" in Australia just recently<br />
and I am going to weary you with some statistics to indicate the extent of<br />
this " explosion". Not so many years ago we were thought to be poor in<br />
natural resources and to be growers of wool, growers of cattle, growers<br />
of cricketers, growers of people who sometimes unjustly criticise the<br />
United Kingdom, but not richly endowed in those dry, arid, inland areas<br />
which make up so much of our continent. Yet now our known oil fields will<br />
be producing about 70 per cent of our own requirements for crude petroleum<br />
by 1970 just two years on. Only a fraction of what is there to be discovered<br />
is I am sure, as yet, discovered.<br />
We have at the same time discovered supplies of natural gas<br />
for industry in our great cities, and this will be available in those cities<br />
Melbourne, Brisbane probably by the end of this year. Cur iron ore<br />
mountains seem to be illimitable and made of a grade unmatched elsewhe-re.<br />
By 1973 vwe will be exporting 35 million tons of iron ore every year and by<br />
that stage or ' 71 or ' 72 these minerals, nickel as well, will be producing<br />
one billion dollars a year of export income for our country. / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
We have more than a third of the world's known deposits of<br />
bauxite, to make alumina and aluminium and the output will rise from about<br />
a million tons which is the present output to 10 million tons in 1972.<br />
Production of coal for export will double. Nickel discoveries, in which I<br />
think quite a number of people in the United Kingdom have done reasolpably<br />
well, will add to this future which lies so close within our grasp. Phosphate,<br />
copper, other minerals have been discovered and will follow.<br />
This is no credit to us. I do not tell this to this distinguished<br />
company in the suggestion that it is something that resounds to Australian<br />
individual's own credit; I say it because I want to indicate that there is ill<br />
my belief an illimitable future, that there will be a doubling in our economy<br />
every thirteen years, and that those who are interested should get in on<br />
the ground floor, as some already have, to take full advantage of the<br />
opportunities which are there in such great abundance. Not opportunities<br />
merely for Australia. Because if it is true that this economic development<br />
is possible and I am sure it is and if it is true that this economic<br />
development in its turn w~ ill enable the influx of population which we so<br />
require and I'm sure that too is true then this vision of a nation in<br />
twenty, thirty years will be of advantage not just to us, but to us and to<br />
that England which will be tied to us forever in general approaches to the<br />
world's require ments and the world's problems.<br />
I did read in one of the distinguished papers of this country<br />
this morning, a leading article suggesting that we regarded the United<br />
Kingdom as a quarry for taking people and population. Well, I suppose<br />
in a sense we do. But it will be to both of our advantages, and indeed it<br />
will be different from what was originally said when the settlers first<br />
came to Australia, because we will be able to say with full truth " True<br />
patriots they, for be it understood, they left their country of our country's<br />
good." But what we I must pause here all the things which I<br />
have said will take place. The speed with which they take place will<br />
naturally depend upon the amount of capital flowing in to enable such<br />
development. And this is the more true because on current account, on<br />
what we sell to other countries and what we buy f~ om other countries, we<br />
don't do so well. The United States places difficulties in the way of us<br />
selling meat and wool and other products, and there are murmurings of<br />
some entry into some kind of association by Great Britain which might cut<br />
down on the prospects of selling our own primary products. And so the<br />
current account does need to be balanced by inflow of capital. Inflow of<br />
capital, which will go to a country as stable as any country in the world,<br />
and be able to be invested in enterprises which will return to those who so<br />
invest an interest as great, I think, as they could receive anywhere.<br />
We want this, and we want it urgently. But we want it, in some respects,<br />
on our own terms. e. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Up until very recently it has seemed to me that the postpre<br />
of Australia in seeking overseas capital has been the posture of a puppy<br />
lying on its back with all legs in the air and its stomach exposed, and<br />
saying, " Please, please, please, give us capital. Tickle my tummy on<br />
any conditions", and this is being re-examined for those who seek and<br />
wish to take the risks and the advantages that are offered, by bringing in<br />
capital for new development, then we are delighted, and we are receptive<br />
for that capital. But we do say and I go no further than to say that we do<br />
say that we would be happy if in such cases when some new great<br />
development were to take place, and capital from here were to come to<br />
help it, and there was an opportunity I say only an opportunity offered<br />
for some equity participation by Australians in that new development.<br />
Should they care not to take it up, that is their business, that is their loss.<br />
Should they wish to take it up at some later stage, after the risks have<br />
been taken and have been successfully overcome, then they must expect<br />
to take it up at a premium, because somebody else has taken the risks.<br />
But initially, it would please us if in such cases an opportunity were given<br />
to get in on the ground floor.<br />
We do not look with complete and utter favour on overseas<br />
corporations, having started development in our own country, having<br />
brought capital from abroad to make that development possible, then seeking<br />
to raise debenture capital inside our own country in order to keep the process<br />
rolling. Well this is not overseas capital, this does not bring in with it a<br />
capacity for us to bring in more migrants. This does not bring the machinery<br />
or whatever it may be that true overseas capital provides. But being<br />
reasonable people, we are amenable to any suggestions that, should such<br />
a situation arise and should debenture capital be sought to be raised within<br />
Australia for purposes of some overseas company, we would look at-. that<br />
with sympathy, as long as it was coupled with the offer of equity to,.<br />
Australian shareholders at the same time.<br />
You may have heard perhaps I gather you have from reading<br />
the newspapers some queries in some minds as to our attitude towardis<br />
portfolio investment, as distinct from development investment. We are<br />
delighted to have portfolio investment, particularly if Mr. Smith, or Mr.<br />
Brown or Mr. Jones, wishing to take a flutter in Great Western, or in<br />
B. H. P. or some other of our great companies, wishes to buy two hundred<br />
shares, three hundred shares, five hundred shares this is marvellous.<br />
We like it. Wie trust no impediment will ever be put in its way. And we<br />
realise that in the case of companies already established, that there are<br />
instances in which such Australian companies could with advantage to them<br />
and to Australia, be taken over. If there are inefficient companies, companies<br />
badly run, companies which need capital they cannot raise inside our country,<br />
companies which need an infusion of technical management, then it could<br />
well be of advantage to all that from abroad somebody who can provide the<br />
required capital and management skill and technology should be enabled to<br />
enter into and if necessary control and certainly have a very great influence<br />
on such a company. But we do believe that there are other companies, well<br />
run, well managed, sometimes under-valued on exchanges in relation to the<br />
assets they have, who can be subject to market raids, to offers of first come, </p>
<p>first served, to cert ' ain shareholders so that the whole company itself does<br />
not have a chance, all the shareholders do not have a chance to examine<br />
the offer that is made, and we do not have a chance to know who is buying<br />
the company. There was a specific instance of that not so long ago and<br />
we had to discover who was trying to buy one of our insurance companies,<br />
who was buying it and whether we thought that such a company should in<br />
such cases be taker. over.<br />
These are under examination, these last two matters at the<br />
moment. They will be worked out. But let there be no doubt in the minds<br />
of anybody in this room, but that we need, wish, welcome, investment<br />
capital, that there is stability of opportunity for those who have it to invest.<br />
And speaking for myself, in spite of what I am told from some quarters,<br />
I think that if we provide a stable government, and if we provide clear<br />
evidence that there is going to be a darn good return on any capital that<br />
is invested, then that capital is going to come to us and not be frightened<br />
off because of the sort of things that I have just now been saying.<br />
We do not want, in twenty or thirty years, to have Americans,<br />
or French, or Swiss or British, owning the major companies in Australia,<br />
for a variety of reasons I do not need now to go into. But I had promised<br />
I would say sometling on this subject, tonight. I know it's dull. I know<br />
it's dry. Now "' ye said it. But when all is said and done, Sir, to come<br />
back to what you said at the beginning, all these things, really, are tools<br />
with which to build the future. The tools with which to make one potentially<br />
great nation realise that potential, so that it can in the future, in conjunction<br />
with an already great nation, make a far greater contribution and effect<br />
on the world, to the benefit of all of us.<br />
And this is essential, I believe, if we are to keep in a world<br />
swinging down the grooves of change, those things of which you spoke and<br />
for which Britain stands. The avoidance of the knock on the door of the<br />
secret police at midnight; the avoidance of the fear of one man to speak<br />
his mind because he may be punished; the opportunity for a man to develop<br />
his own capacity to the top of his bent. And it's a charge laid on all of us<br />
to see that these things are kept. All of us English, Australians, New<br />
Zealanders all those of common stock and of these beliefs. A charge<br />
that was laid in 1939 and ' 45. And can I ask you, as you look at me, to try<br />
not to see me, if I make this point, but instead to see behind me, regiment<br />
on regiment of young men dead in ' 39 to ' 45, and try and hear them saying<br />
burning in tanks and aeroplanes, drowning in submarines, shattered and<br />
broken by high explosive shells we gave, for our full measure of devotion,<br />
that these things of what you spoke, and of which I am speaking, might<br />
continue. And they will continue the better while we stay together,<br />
while we stay in conjunction, while we in Australia reach towards our destiny.<br />
While we convert the vision splendid, of the sunlit plains extended, into a<br />
reality which is now within our grasp. With our work, and your help, to<br />
our common effort, and for the protection of those things, we both, as I am<br />
sure, desire for our children.<br />
Thank you. </p>
