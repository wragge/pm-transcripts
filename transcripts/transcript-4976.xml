~ MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 2 MARCH, 1979<br />
AUSTRALIAN MEMBERSHIP<br />
INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that Australia will become<br />
a member of the International Energy Agency ( IEA).<br />
Australia's application to join was unanimously approved<br />
at a meeting of the lEA's Governing Board in Paris on<br />
1 March. This followed a comprehensive review by the Government<br />
over the last year.<br />
The IEA is an autonomous institution within the framework of<br />
the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development,<br />
and is now the major forum for continuing consultation and<br />
co-operation on energy matters between most of the<br />
industrialised nations which are Australia's principal trading<br />
partners. The Prime Minister stated that Australia would obtain a number<br />
of benefits from membership. These would include participation<br />
in the IEA's long-term co-operation activities, covering<br />
energy conservation programs and joirf ' energy research and<br />
development projects, and participation in the lEA's Emergency<br />
Oil Sharing Scheme.<br />
Membership of the TEA would also be valuable in view of<br />
Australia's position as an increasingly important net energy<br />
exporter, and the Government's determination to make energy<br />
materials available on reasonable terms to its trading<br />
partners. Australia would also derive advantage from access<br />
to information available within the TEA on the international<br />
oil market.<br />
The G-1overnment has made it clear to the IEA that its accession<br />
to the TEA's Agreement on an International Energy Program,<br />
and its acceptance of the subsequent decisions of the TEA's<br />
Governing Board, are to the extent that these are compatible<br />
with '_ ustralia's federal constitution, and the Government's<br />
policies on foreign investment, uranium and other energy<br />
resources.<br />
Mr. Fraser said that the responsibility of co-ordinating TEA<br />
matters had been given to the Minister for National Development,<br />
Mr. Newman, who proposes to make a statement to Parliament<br />
next week on the details of Australian membership. Also the<br />
matter will be taken up in detail with the States and the<br />
Northern Territory through the machinery of the Australian<br />
Minerals and Energy Council. 000---</p>
