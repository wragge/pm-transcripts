    <content><![CDATA[<p>Sydney</p>
<p>PM: It's great to be here at Mary MacKillop College.</p>
<p>I'm joined by local member Chris Hayes, who is certainly no stranger to this school and I've come to this school today to award Who's Your Favourite Teacher?</p>
<p>I called on the nation to tell us stories about who's you favourite teacher; who made a very big difference to your life, and out of all of the entries from that national conversation, we picked a teacher here at this school, Mr O'Connor, as the favourite teacher.</p>
<p>A young student here, Rebecca, nominated him and said what a difference he had made to her study of English and how she now wants to be a teacher.</p>
<p>So it's been a very special opportunity to come here to meet a great teacher, to meet a delighted student whose nomination has had her teacher recognised, and to meet a great principal in Narelle and the teaching staff and students of this school.</p>
<p>So a great spirit, great atmosphere, a great school assembly, so great day all round.</p>
<p>I'm happy to take some questions and then we've got some other things to do before the day is done.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Yes Prime Minister, the Newspoll results must have been disheartening.</p>
<p>Next year looking impossible?</p>
<p>PM: We'll have an election in 2013 and I can tell you one thing about that election for sure.</p>
<p>It won't be decided on yesterday's polls, it will be decided on who has the best plans for the nation's future, who can ensure that the nation in an uncertain world is guided to a stronger future.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: The results were fairly stagnant from the beginning of the year compared to now.</p>
<p>Does it show that your Government isn't making any inroads with voters at this stage?</p>
<p>PM: Well, we'll have the election next year and I'm very clear about what that election will be decided on.</p>
<p>It'll be about Australia's future, and who's got the policy muscle to bring the solutions Australia needs in an uncertain world.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: You talk about negative politics, but will you stop those attacks on Mr Abbott next year?</p>
<p>PM: I don't know what you're referring to.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, how do you think the regulator should deal with the 2Day FM situation?</p>
<p>PM: That's a matter for the regulator, but this is a heartbreaking tragedy all round.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Did you see the interviews last night?</p>
<p>PM: No, I wasn't in a position to, I had commitments, but I've obviously seen the news reports this morning and it's just a heartbreaking story all round, a really heartbreaking set of circumstances.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: The Opposition is saying that the Government is slowly crab-walking away from the budget surplus.</p>
<p>How confident are you of delivering that?</p>
<p>PM: Well we delivered the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and we stand by the forecasts in it.</p>
<p>Okay, thanks very much.</p>
