    <content><![CDATA[<p>Construction of NorthLink WA’s biggest free-flowing freeway-to-freeway interchange has reached a major milestone with the first Reid Highway bridge over the Tonkin Highway opening to traffic this weekend.</p>
<p>The new interchange will deliver a constant average speed of 80km/h and allow traffic to flow in all directions – making trips shorter and safer for motorists.</p>
<p>The Turnbull Government has committed $820.84 million to fund the $1.02 billion NorthLink WA project in partnership with the Western Australian State Government, an investment that will create jobs, stimulate economic growth and reduce congestion.</p>
<p>The entire NorthLink WA project will deliver much-needed extra road capacity to Perth's northeast, ensuring we address future demand as Ellenbrook’s population grows from 23,000 to a forecast 47,000 by 2031.</p>
<p>From the morning of Sunday 12 August, the way motorists use the Tonkin/Reid Highway intersection will change when the new bridge opens to traffic.</p>
<p>The traffic lights will be removed at the intersection and a temporary roundabout put in place until mid-2019, eliminating one of the state’s most dangerous intersections.</p>
<p>The temporary roundabout will be located 500 metres northwest of the current traffic signals, allowing for the permanent switch of traffic onto the new Reid Highway bridge.</p>
<p>New ramps in the interchange will open progressively as construction continues.</p>
<p>Future works on the central section of NorthLink WA include interchanges at Hepburn Avenue, Gnangara Road and The Promenade at Ellenbrook, with flyovers at Beechboro Road North and Marshall Road.</p>
