October 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOIHN HOWARD, MP<br />
LAUNCH OF NATIONAL CARERS' WEEK<br />
WOODSTOCK, HOBART, TASMANIA<br />
E&amp; O F<br />
Thank you very much Judi Moylan, to Peter Mc; Kay, to Paul Calvert, Mrs Avril Fink,<br />
ladies and gentlemen. It's a very special pleasure for Janette and myself having just left<br />
the, I suppose the inevitable political rigour of a National Conference of our own<br />
Political Party, to come to this lunch to share a few moments in helping to launch<br />
National Carters' Week.<br />
When you are in politics you meet a lot of people, some of the interviews you have have<br />
no impression at other interviews leave a mark on you for a little while and then<br />
they're forgotten and then other discussions are ones that you never ever forget Several<br />
years ago whien my eldest child, mrny daughter was doing her HSC, T interviewed a lady in<br />
Sydney who described some of the difficulties she had in a situation in a very small home<br />
when one of her children was doing the HSC and the other of her children was a male<br />
adult who was profoundly handicapped and she was cuing for him, with all the<br />
difficulties and challenges that that involved and at the same time trying to provide a<br />
reasonable, congenial environment for her other child to study for the HSC. And the sort<br />
of description that she gave to me did leave a real impression. And it kindled then, I was<br />
not the Leader of the Opposition then, I was just a Shadow Minister, and it kindled an<br />

Often but not always in a family situation, usually but not always, in relation to a fr-ail<br />
and elderly relative always involvin though a degree of porsonal commitment and a<br />
degree of love and devotion to responsibility and devotion to what they see as their duty<br />
to their family members or otherwise their loved ones. So it is very appropriate that there<br />
be a National Carers' Week.<br />
It's important in a society such as ours to take time out to honour the contribution that<br />
unsung heroes make to keeping our society together. No society can work without<br />
volunteer commitment and effort. There are many, many people in Australia every day of<br />
the week, every week of the year who want to give of their time and their effort and their<br />
talent and their energy and their intellect to help others to look after -others and they<br />
draw a satisfaction from that. But it is important not to take that for granted in a broad<br />
sense the community ought never to take its volunteer effort and devotion for grated It<br />
ought to be wiffing on occasions to publicly honour it and to accord to people who are<br />
willing to do that. the respect and gratitude to which they are entitled, And I am so very<br />
pleased to associate miyself with this because my Government is about a lot of things and<br />
it's not just about getting the economy right that's very important it's not just about<br />
the sort of day-to-day arguments on taxation, industrial relationS; they're all iMportant<br />
too. It is also a Government that is concerned about the kind of society we are and the<br />
kind of people we honour and respect and the sort of value system that we have. And<br />
looking after one another is the most important component of the value systemr of any<br />
society and I would like to think that something like a proper role for carers; in our<br />
community is an issue that straddles any political divide. T don't seek to pretend that this<br />
or that side of politics has done it this or that way or any better than the other. If we can<br />
reach an agreement on this T'd be more than happy to give credit to my political<br />
opponents for anything that they've done in this area.<br />
And I'm happy to say that being seen by others~ as sort of making some cuts and<br />
restrictions elsewhere we have been able to do a number of things in our last Budget<br />
which I just wanted to veMy very briefly mention today becat= s they are an indication of<br />
the commitment we have-We have increased the number of days that a came may<br />
temporarily cease caring in a calendar year without affecting the eligibility for the carer<br />
payment. We're extending ftom 10 to 20 hours the number of hours per week that carers<br />
may spend in employment, voluntary work, educational train&amp; wbilst being eligible to<br />
receive the carers' payment. We've established a National Caters' Programme which wfll<br />
integrate the existing array of respite care programmes into a single programme. And this<br />
will greatly assist family carers who until now have had to find their way through a maze<br />
of individual programmes, each with their own eligibility crite ria and<br />

different bureaucracies. We're going to provide an additional $ 36.7 million to the<br />
National Respite for Carers' Programme over the next four years and this will help to<br />
ensure that there is a wider array of readily available respite options suited to the diverse<br />
needs of individual carers. We're also going to establish a national network of carer<br />
resource centres and with funding of up to $ 700 000 a year nationally these resource<br />
centres will help carers to liaise with came providers in identifying and delivering respite<br />
care most relevant to individual needs.<br />
Now these are just some of the commitments that we make and T do want you to accept<br />
from me a very genuine commitment by the Government to the worth, to the notion of<br />
what corers do, to what it demonstrates about the humanity and the decency and the<br />
values of the people who provide the care. A decent, civilised., humane society always<br />
requires personal sacrifice by individuals but that personal sacrifice ought never to be<br />
taken for granted and it should never go unacknowledged. And the groatest deeds of<br />
personal commitment are performed in the home environment where people care for sick<br />
and frail and dying loved ones and those in their family who have particular disabilities<br />
which the rest of us don't have. And they really do represent some of the most wonderfurl<br />
stories that anybody can tell about the decency and the love and the care of men and<br />
womcn in our community.<br />
And 1 can't think of any cause that is more deserving of respect and honour than the<br />
cause of the Government of this country and the Leader of that Government fbr the time<br />
being, I hope for a while, saying how much we honour and respect your contribution.<br />
And I want to say on behalf of my Government, on behalf of all of the Australian people<br />
thank you for what you are doing; thank you for making it a better and a happier and a<br />
more decent and a more humane society. And I hope that my Governmnent can over the<br />
years ahead continue to provide help, that you have some very articulate advocates on<br />
behaf of your organisation and good luck to them. Articulate advocacy is something that<br />
always ultimately has an effect on Goverrnents and that's very, very important.<br />
But this week is a very important week for you. It's a very important week for those who<br />
believe that Australian soc iety is nmore than just a combination of economic numbers and<br />
arid policies, it's also about values and love and compassion and care and it's a very<br />
important week and I very proud as Prime Minister to have been asked to launch it to<br />
say a few words about my own personal intercst in your responsibilities and also to wish<br />
the Carers' Association the very best of good fortune and to thank all of you for the<br />
magnifcent personal contribution you make and for the collective contribution you<br />
make to a wvarm and more decent and more caring Australan community.<br />
Thank you.<br />
