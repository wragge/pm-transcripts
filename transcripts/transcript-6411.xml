Ibt~. l<br />
: 1. BNCH as you know I've said it will be in February or March, but<br />
tEre will be an early one. Mr. Hawke nice to have you. back in the -studio<br />
and I thank you again for what you did before and said before.<br />
MR. HAWKE Pleasure Derryn.<br />
HINCH I suppose back in the real world. The issues seem to be all around<br />
us. There's the superannuation business, there's the assets test, there's<br />
the doctors' problems in NSW increasinly it seems to te everybody sayd<br />
yes we understand we have to share but nobody wants to do the sharing,<br />
everbody says yes but not me, not us, we are special.<br />
MR. HAWKE Well I don't think that's quite right, I mean you get the<br />
evidence of the concerns and I don't Worry about the fact that people initially<br />
say, they get aprehensive and worried, but I have great faith in human<br />
nature basically that when people understand, learn what thiigs are about<br />
and see that there's a good and decent reason for what is being done they<br />
accept it. I had this experience last week which you would have read about<br />
when I went down to Chelsea here and met a couple of hundred, probably two<br />
or three hundred pensioners there....<br />
HINCH And the reception wasn't good to start with.<br />
MR. HAWKE No that's not fair it was quite a sort of warmish reception<br />
when I started, friendly, but you could just see it as I explained the assets<br />
test, the very few relatively that would be affected, and the reason why it<br />
should be done, the reasonableness of it, the fact that it would enable<br />
governments in the future to have more available to them to help those who<br />
really were in need, they gave me a standing ovation and " for he's a jolly<br />
good fellow" at the end. Now I'm not saying that to talk about myself but it<br />
really, the point I'm making is that once ppople have initial fears or<br />
worries dissipated, and see that this: is a good thing for the country and<br />
it's not really going to hurt them, then they understand it.<br />
HINCH What is it mainly though, is it a fear of a creeping socialism, is it<br />
a fear of a kickback to the early ' 70s or what?<br />
MR HAWKE No it's certainly not a fear of creeping socialism, I mean the<br />
people of Australia know probably who gets attacked more than anyone by the<br />
extreme left of politics in Australia. I mean I'm the number one target, so<br />
that's a non-event. No it's not a return to the ' 70s if there's one<br />
thing that's clear about the public perception of this government it's a<br />
competent, effective economic manager. I mean this is a plus for this<br />
government now as distinct from the apprehensions there were earlier. No<br />
I think it's simply, look, people are the same from when they are young, or<br />
from when we are kids and right through. If you've got something and you<br />
think perhaps you are going to have it taken away from you or something said<br />
that might change a little the habits and the patterns that you've got, your<br />
natural reaction is to say that might effect me not the other bloke and I<br />
don't want to have change, and so the function of good government it seems<br />
to me is communication to get your decision right and then communicate it<br />
and I've said frankly in regard to the assets test that we didn't get it<br />

if<br />
right the first time and I quite straight-forwardly told the people.<br />
HINCH Yeah well in favour of youi government you didn't just plough.. i<br />
ltraight on with it, you changed.<br />
MR. HAWKE That's right, well I've never believed in that. If you make<br />
a mistake, it's human nature to make mistakes. We could have done it<br />
better and as soon as, I could see it developing on my way back from China.<br />
I was sitting in the plane there in February and I mean there has always#<br />
been talk I succumbed to pressure from here and there, I was sitting in'%.<br />
the plane and I thought that's not going right there are problems with<br />
that, so as soon as I got back I said now we have got to drop that, have<br />
some more discussion about that andlget the community into it, and there<br />
is no doubt that what we have done now is right, it's simple, straightforward<br />
and will be to. the long term benefit of Australia.<br />
HINCH I've talked with Senator Grimes in the last few days about the<br />
assets test and also to your opponept Andrew Peacock. Could we talk some<br />
generalities for a change because sometimes listeners get bogged down inthey<br />
think pollies give them facts and figures and they get bogged down<br />
in it. Since you have been in office and you have been there for over a<br />
year now., you have said things li e you beleived that people in their<br />
old age should live well, they should get 25% of the basic wage. You haven'<br />
been able to do it. How does that personally affect Bob Hawke you just<br />
cannot give what you feel is good for the country, what you wanted to do<br />
for the country.<br />
MR. HAWKE Let's be clear about tiat, I don't want to go back into<br />
details, but you know you have acknowleged it with me, the problems we had<br />
with the, when we came to power at the beginning of last year, that we had<br />
that 3.6 billion dollars extra deficit that we hadn't been told about by<br />
our political opponents and that me&amp; nt we couldn't immediately do the<br />
things we wanted to do. But in the; basic, the important area of employment<br />
creation we are well ahead of target and we have got the economy moving<br />
strongly now and that will mean that as we come up to our next budget and<br />
beyond we will in fact be moving significantly towards doing the sorts of<br />
things we are talking about. In the pensions area I obviously can't give<br />
the full details but we will do more than just do what's required to restor<br />
the loss of purchasing power, we will start to move towards that<br />
earnings that is our policy, and th t's clearly accepted now by the people<br />
HINCH When you talk about the economy coming back, there's the economic<br />
summit in London which some people Oee as a bit of a non-event recently,<br />
with leaders like Reagan and Thatcher etc. I notice Max Walsh this morning<br />
pointing nut the fact that despite what pAnple refer to as rhetoric the<br />
stock markets are still very scared I mean Wall Street is still not<br />
believing what the leaders are telling them, Wall Street doesn't believe<br />
Ronald Reagan's optimism.<br />
MR. HAWKE Well as far as the intbrnation stock market is concerned,<br />
what you've got to understand, and ihat is quite clear, one of the major<br />
causes of concern is whether the third world couhtries that are particularly<br />
indebted are going to be albe to service that massive debt which<br />
runs into hundreds of billions of dpllars, the concern there is that with<br />
the private banking system in the United Staten so heavily exposed with. th<br />
high level of debt that the stability of the US private banking financial<br />
is in question and that at the moment I think is the major source of<br />
instability on the stock market internationally....<br />
HINCH How often say can an American govornment come in and prop up one<br />
': ju~~ T~ Ji<br />
r C<br />
m I </p>
<p>bank with like 3 billion dollars, t at's the question.<br />
MR. HAWKE Well you can't keep on doing it indefinitely but if you V.'<br />
look at the performance of the financial system both public and private<br />
the judgement'ust be that over the last few years they've done a very<br />
good job in coping with this massive increase in indebtedness. The secret,<br />
of dealing with it is to get the economy of the developed countries<br />
together moving more strongly so that there is a higher demand f6r the<br />
S exports of these indebted dountries; point one, and I think that that<br />
is happening. Secondly of course in the United States it had to get its<br />
deficit down because every increase; in percentage point interest rate<br />
increase in the United States adds hundreds of millions of dollars to the<br />
interest indebtedness of those debtor countries. Now on that point : tthink<br />
in the longer term there's grounds for optimism, once the US presid-<br />
S ential elections are out of the w~ y I think decisions will be made to<br />
bring that deficit down.<br />
HINCH Closer to home, back at hoie, obviously totally revamping the<br />
taxation system in Australia must be one of your major concerns for the<br />
second term that you presume you are going to get and most people predict<br />
you are going to get. Will you look at areas like single mothers who<br />
want to go to work, it seems crazy to me that a single mother can't deduct<br />
the fees for the babysitter, the childminder, now I've talked to single<br />
mothers who have gone to work and 75% of what they earn has gone to mind<br />
S the children Are you looking at those sorts of areas?<br />
MR. HAWKE The areas affecting women in taxation are being specifically.<br />
examined by the Office of the Status of Women in my department, Prime<br />
Minister's Department, so as we are'preparing the Budget we will have<br />
indication available to us of the areas of the whole fiscal system, tax;.<br />
system which impinge upon women, and that doesn't mean that we willbe<br />
S ble in this budget to remedy every part of the existing tax system,<br />
Iiich may have some relatively harsher impact on women, but it is being<br />
: i specifically dealt with in a way it hasn't been dealt with before, now<br />
S going to the broader area that you 4re talking about, the reform of the<br />
tax system generally, could I make this basic point which is not sufficiently<br />
understood within the community generally, People get very<br />
i complicated ideas of what tax is about, it's essentially very simple and<br />
it's this, tax represents the way i which society through its individuals<br />
and its companies and organisations, pays some of its resources and income<br />
to the government for the government on behalf of the people to do the<br />
things that individuals and organisations want done for them which they<br />
S. can't do for themselves. That's essentiAlly what tax is, however complicated<br />
and sophisticated your economic writers make it, that's what tax isthe<br />
transfer of resources from ourselves as individuals and organisations<br />
to give to government to do the things that we really want done. So what<br />
we have gradually got to do is sit down, the government and the community,<br />
and sort out the two sides of what taxation is about. We have got to try<br />
Sa nd get as much area of agreement a6 we can about the things that we want<br />
government to do and the priorities: that we want and at the same time say<br />
together we think that this is the fairest way for us as individuals and<br />
organisations to transfer our resources and that's really the discussion<br />
i that I'm trying to get going within the community, in the Econ6mic Planning<br />
Advisory Council and other forms of consultation. It's quite silly<br />
people picking out one thing and saying we should do that or we should do<br />
this. We have got to make sure a total framework of the community is<br />
satisfied that these things are beihg done to satisfy the two criteria of<br />
equity between groups and individuals as to how they pass over their<br />
resources and efficiency. It' silly having a tax which in net termir is<br />
going to create more inefficiencies than the capacity of. government to<br />
t </p>
<p>j~<br />
J r O F. .4<br />
4~ 4J<br />
4( INC Well that's one of the cr : it4~ cisms of the assets test.<br />
LHAWKE No I don't know itherethat's come from...<br />
flINCH In the short term the. amou~ t of muoney you. vill have to spend<br />
ZB-Giing money in.<br />
MR. HAWKE No in the first year'there will be a higher expenditure, . butevery<br />
commnentator knows that that'alonly for the first.. year, includling,,,<br />
our friends in the opposition, theyknow that that's' tiue, after the first<br />
year, once you have establishedit it will be a n~ t gain for revenue. Not<br />
only will it be a net gain for reverhue but also importantly it's going.. to<br />
stop those systems where the esitremely wealthy were so arranging-their<br />
assets that they were still ghttinga pension. Now there's not a single<br />
commentator in the country who doe~ n't acknowledge that after the first<br />
year it will be a net gain.<br />
1IN~ CH The figure, I think it wap Max Burr raised the figure that at.<br />
EEWemment 68% of government revenue is now going to social services<br />
1gould that be about right?<br />
MR. HAW'KE I don't think it would : be that high but it is a significant<br />
proportion and it is precisely bec~ ise that is so that Andrew Peacock in<br />
Septembe * r of 1981 when he was hAvin4 his sojourn on. the back benches,<br />
made a very telling speech in the M~ use of Representatives and saying<br />
therefore that governments he said ziust act with courage to ensure that<br />
we didn't pay out unnecessary social welfare benefits to people who didn't<br />
need them. It was an excellent spepch, he was right then, and it's a. pity<br />
he didn't adhere to his principles..<br />
flINCH You know Mir. Prime 14iniste : that all politiciAns youself included<br />
sometimes can't bear the scrutiny of going back ten or fifteen years to<br />
something you said...<br />
MR. HAWKE I don't mind going back to something I've said in an area of<br />
principle about politics....<br />
flINCH Look at a classic case...<br />
MR. HAWKE Let me say there will be for all of us a position where on<br />
a reappraisal of the facts we will come to a different conclusion but on<br />
a question of principle lik6 that there is constancy on the other side<br />
of politics. John Howard, let me s~ iy John Howard has been totally consisteri<br />
about this, he said consistently when he was in government he tried to<br />
move an assets test, a means test# 1w said it was the right principle, he<br />
still believes it, now that's why in the debate in parliament he wouldn't<br />
oppose what we were doing.<br />
HINCH Well I'm sure you can go b~ tck to comm~ entators like muyself and find<br />
c~ aiiges in-' ideas....<br />
MR. HAWKE Well sure....<br />
flINCH But I'm thinking back to ay yesterday there was another French<br />
test -at Mururea Atoll, youv'e been quoted, I think it was M4ax Walsh, dug<br />
out that clip of yours in the ACTU # bout the ban on PFreach shipping etc<br />
hg* 5<br />
J_<br />
things with it. </p>
<p>4'<br />
H MR. HAWKE: Look, you ore not comparing' like with like, and I'm<br />
glad you brought-it yp. Then thety weren't testing underground, they<br />
were testing In the atmosphere * qnd ail the evidence, showed that with<br />
atmospheric testing there was a : potential danger from those atmospheu-ic<br />
tests to us In this country,..<br />
HINCH People were buying canned iilk and powdered milk..-.<br />
14R 1UAWKE and I was proud of ' ite fact that I led th afight in<br />
and internationally at the ILO and one * of the causes of pride<br />
that I have looking back is that from two different sources I was told<br />
and fairly high sources,* from within : Francel that the fight that we led<br />
internationally against atntospheric~ nuclear testing hastened their move<br />
to uinderground testing. Now there Is a very big difference between<br />
underground testing and atmospheric ' so I think you ought to be fatr to rrae<br />
HINCH Can you live with, if at the ALP Federal Conference next month,<br />
can you live with it if the ban con~ inues' against sales to. the' French?<br />
MR. HAWK( E Look I've made it cleai Dex-ryn that I don't want to get into<br />
Public dihnte before the Conference ! about . the issues. I want to donducet<br />
this within the party and I don't think that anyone's cause-is advanced<br />
by a public airing of it. I mean I~ will relax to this point to say that:<br />
it seems to me that if something~ whothere you are talking about the ban<br />
on sales of uranium to France, but let me make the general point, it sems<br />
to me that in any area of activity that an inoividua or a group's involved<br />
in, if they are taling about punith~ ng someone, it doesn'tmjake a hell<br />
of a lot of sense if the action that you take in fact punishes the.<br />
punisbor rather than the punishee.<br />
HINCH A new version of biting off Your nose to spite your face. Two final<br />
poih: Es on two personality issues. q9ne your reaction to the knighthood<br />
recconuended by some mysterious () LD citizen for Premier Joh Ejelke Peterson.<br />
MR. HAWK~ E Well since I've been Prime minister I haven't gone in for<br />
thebsiTndhss of bagging Joh, he's the democratically elected Premier<br />
of the State, if he wants to have a ' knighthood well he's obviously got to<br />
authorize it himself and if he ' thinks it's a good idea to award himself a<br />
knighthood well ok. I just happen to think that the overwhelming majority<br />
of Australians are right in believinig that the time for imperial honours<br />
has gone that we are a sovereign proud and independent nation and that<br />
the Australian system of honours Is very very much to be preferred. But if<br />
be's happy good luck to him.<br />
H INCH,--Would you agree it's like Napolean crowning himself?<br />
14R. HAWKE Except that Napolean lithink perhaps could have fashioned his<br />
own ciaion. I couldn't detect the pen of Joh in that unbelievable<br />
flourish of hyperbole in the English language which characterised that<br />
citation. back in l972, 73 and yet now your standL now on that compared to then<br />
on may supply of uranitim to the Frezlch. 4,. i it' Fm V. 3, </p>

asked~~ h~ progwPecokab-rammue,-that ybu r1-:<br />
relationship, : you don't have to lik4 your opponent, but you'r~ p'erronal<br />
relationship with Andrew Peacock sedme to have changed#, seous to have--_,<br />
* soured onh both stdos since you becavie Prime Ninistipr and be _ beiame Leader<br />
of the opit~. ionuI<br />
MR. HAWKE Yes v6il this has been~ asked of me quite a bit. I In~<br />
realy wnt -to go into the question of personal analysis of the character'Jand<br />
actions of Andrew just let me say that there are certain fundamentals<br />
o f principle over recent times in wh 6h I think he has . shown, a disappoint~ ng<br />
slackness. But it's because of thelthings that are invoived that 1. don'~ t<br />
really want to say anymore bacause t think they go to issues which I<br />
think are important in our community and I don't think really In develiop-<br />
Ing my thoughts about it in relation to Mr. Peacock those fundamentally<br />
important points are helped . and I d6n It think the coumuhity is helped.<br />
Let me just say that, I'm disappointed in what has been in my Judgement<br />
a lack of courage, za lack of couuuit~ ient to principle, a. lack of leadership.<br />
HINCH Was it the issue of Asiadn immigration?<br />
MR. HAWKE Well that was associated with it, there are others but it<br />
was certainly associated with it.<br />
HINCH Because it seems to m~ e that the major deterioration would have<br />
occured around that time.<br />
MR. HAWKE Yep.<br />
HINCH But surely you have been di. sappointed In politico before And'<br />
w OT17be again?<br />
MR. HAWKE Yeah, look in politics just because you have arguments with<br />
peope about day to day things or they accept the responsibility which<br />
they have of attacking you or the governmente or for us the ' opposition,<br />
that's part of life in politics and,. I thrive on it. I think thbre are<br />
certain fundamental commitments and': I think also particularly wher~ e you<br />
give your word on things its very ilaportant, if your word can't be adhered<br />
to, but I think you can appreciate.-just don't want-to develop down that<br />
line.* I hope we can keep a civilisiid relationship, I must say I co-rfess<br />
on the prograimme I owe him $ 5 he -# anted to have a bet on the Essondon-<br />
Swans game in the latter part of the parliament. I tried to negotiate<br />
7 goals, he was very very adament h wouldn't give me more that 5. ' Now<br />
if I had been able to get him to agree * to 7 he would owe me<br />
HINCH You realise of course last w ekend I could have given you 7 goals<br />
and Melbourne still would have beaten you.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister I thank you slncprely for coming </p>
