PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH AT LAND COMMISSION CEREMONY,<br />
HAPPY VALLEY, ADELAIDE<br />
11. 4.<br />
Mr. Chairman, the Deputy Premier, Ministers, Commissioners,<br />
Representatives, our colleagues in the Australian, South<br />
Australian Parliament and Local Council, Ladies and Gentlemen-<br />
I don't mind how often I come to functions like this because<br />
this function is the forerunner of many which will take place,<br />
we hope, throughout Australia and which will have two very<br />
great advantages. One is, that the old Australian dream of<br />
having a house of your own, will be more within the reach of<br />
people because the cost of the land, the biggest single<br />
component of the cost of having a house, will be kept to the<br />
minimum. And the second feature is that people who come to<br />
sub-divisions, like this, developed by the Land Commissions,<br />
can be sure that all the facilities that the Local Council,<br />
the State Government, the Federal Government provide, will<br />
be all co-ordinated and supplied at the same time. There will<br />
be, that is, a good block of land at cost with all services<br />
and then with all the community facilities which the three tiers<br />
provide. It's been most gratifying the way the community has<br />
been involved in the planning of this first sub-division of any<br />
Land Commission in Australia. Their advice has been sought,<br />
it has been given. It is a very good example of full community<br />
involvement.<br />
It is very appropriate that the first Land Commission, the<br />
first sub-division of any Land Commission should be here in<br />
South Australia. There is an historical reason for my saying<br />
that, and that is that Adelaide was the first piece of good<br />
town planning in Australia. It was a magnificent foundatfon<br />
that William Light gave for this city. And it is appropriate<br />
enough that the Premier is over near the area he came from,<br />
Penang, where his father set out another beautiful city,<br />
another beautiful locality.<br />
The other reason why it is so appropriate that we should be<br />
having this opening in South Australia, is that the Government<br />
of South Australia was the first to respond to the proposals<br />
that my Government was making in this regard.<br />
The creation of Land Commissions was proposed at the Federal<br />
election in 1972 and it came from two very obvious propositions.<br />
One is, that the Federal Government had greater financial<br />
resources than the State Governments, and secondly, that the<br />
State Governments had a jurisdiction in land matters which<br />
the Federal Government did not have. So by bringing together<br />
the Federal finances and the State jurisdictions, it would be<br />
possible we thought, to solve one of the great social evils<br />
in Australia today, and do so in a proper economic and environmental<br />
context. </p>
<p>The Federal Government cannot make laws, it cannot administer<br />
laws, in regard to land use. The State Governments can,<br />
and the Local Government bodies, semi-Government authorities<br />
which they have created, play a big role in that as well.<br />
But the limiting factor was that these days, no State<br />
Government, no authorities created by State Governments,<br />
had sufficient finances to provide all the services together<br />
and to acquire the land. Now the Federal Government, while<br />
not having the limitless funds that many people suggest or<br />
suppose, nevertheless did have sufficient financial resources<br />
to make it possible to acquire the land in good time and to<br />
provide all the services which Governments have to provide<br />
at the one time.<br />
Whatever our idealogies, whatever our philosophies, we all<br />
accept that Government authorities of one sort or another,<br />
Federal, State, Regional, have to provide things like roads<br />
and kerbing and guttering. They have to provide sewerage,<br />
they have to provide telephones, they have to provide most<br />
of the schools and most of the hospitals and most of the<br />
public transport and the great evil which has arisen in<br />
Australia since the war, where we have very large cities<br />
and where a greater proportion of our population lives in<br />
cities than is the case in practically any nation in the<br />
world. In Australia we just haven't hitherto coped. Individuals<br />
can't do it by themselves. Families can't. Communities<br />
can't. It requires to bring together all the people<br />
with the necessary responsibilities, authority and jurisdiction,<br />
and that's what we have aimed to do in these Land Commissions,<br />
and before 1973 was out, the basic legislation was passed and<br />
my Minister, Tom Uren, and his counterparts in South Australia,<br />
were able to make the arrangements under that legislation.<br />
Now Adelaide isn't the largest city in Australia. It maybe<br />
the best planned, but it's not the largest, never likelp to<br />
be the largest. But the ways things are going it's likely<br />
to continue to be the best planned, the best serviced. And<br />
I suppose it not too invidious to say here, by way of comparison,<br />
what still has to be done in the larger cities in Australia<br />
because Sydney and Melbourne still haven't been able to secure<br />
the services which are now being provided for new home seekers,<br />
new home purchasers, in Adelaide. We have made the financial<br />
agreement with New South Wales, not without some difficulty,<br />
but we still haven't got a Commission. And then in Victoria,<br />
we have an undertaking to have an Urban Land Council by the<br />
end of Jdne next but nothing really has been done there. Now<br />
it's a great pity that this time is being lost because it means<br />
that thousands of families, in Sydney and Melbourne, are not<br />
able to realise their hopes yet and where they use the existing<br />
facilities that are made available for home seekers, they will<br />
do so at a greater cost and they will get the blocks of land<br />
less serviced with fewer amenities than they would otherwise<br />
get. Now South Australia, true to its tradition of proper<br />
town planning right from the outset, is leading Australia<br />
again in proper town planning, not only in the square mile<br />
in the centre, but right round Adelaide, in all the areas </p>
<p>3.<br />
from which people will commute into the city, in all<br />
the areas where they will have community activities,<br />
there will be accommodation and recreation and occupation<br />
and it's been brought about because there has been, in<br />
South Australia, ahead of anywhere else in Australia,<br />
the necessary consultation and co-operation between the<br />
Australian Government, the State Government and the<br />
regional authorities.<br />
It is a model of what can be done, this is not just a<br />
dream, it's not just a theory, it is practical and it is<br />
real and I am delighted, Mr. Deputy Premier, to be seeing<br />
on an occasion like this, the culmination of the efforts<br />
that you, your Premier, your Ministers, my Minister,<br />
many of our colleagues and I, have sought to achieve<br />
over the years. Your Premier, you yourself, I would<br />
have counted as friends for well over a decade and it's<br />
a proud moment when we are able to show to the whole of<br />
the people 6f Australia and particularly to the people<br />
of your State and your capital, what can be done by co-operation<br />
beltween all the spheres of Government in Australia.<br />
Individuals can't do it. They must depend for some action,<br />
some initiative, some co-operation by those whom they elect<br />
to serve them in councils and the South Australian Parliament<br />
and the Australian Parliament and we are able to deliver<br />
the goods now.<br />
This area, these blocks will be $ 1,000 or more cheaper<br />
than comparable blocks in the Adelaide metropolitan area.<br />
They will be fully serviced. The Australian Departments,<br />
I am happy to say, are co-operating in this effort~ and,<br />
not only will there be the basic services, there will also<br />
be some of the necessary amenities.<br />
We want to see the people who come to live in virgin lands<br />
in beautiful, fresh, new settings like this, and so many<br />
of the natural features have been preserved. They will also<br />
be able to get those things that any community wants and<br />
which hitherto we have had to wait for generations to secure.<br />
There will be, we believe, in the near future, proper<br />
community centres in all these areas cultural, sporting,<br />
and so on, and for those who have to stay closest to home,<br />
in their . early years, I am now able to unveil a plaque<br />
in the playground and in doing so I would like to express<br />
the very great pleasure that the boys and girls who are<br />
born and raised in this area will be able to grow up in<br />
an ideal environment and the people who you have elected<br />
in the various fields to serve you, are very happy to meet<br />
so many of you and to be at your service, able to deliver<br />
the goods in the way, I believe we are showing the whole<br />
of Australia that it is possible to do. </p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm not sure that when I get to<br />
the plaque I'll be able to speak as loudly as for you<br />
all to hear. But I have to leave the microphone, so<br />
what I'm going to do over there is unveil the plaque<br />
I don't know what the wording is. This is always a hazard<br />
in this job. You sometimes take away some screen and<br />
thb Sun cartoon or even something offensive or indecent.<br />
Coming to South Australia I suppose I can do it with<br />
complete safety and assurance. Everything over ' 73,<br />
' 74, ' 75 one's been able to co-operate with South<br />
Australia in complete assurance and safety. So sight<br />
unseen, I'm now going in this distinguished representative<br />
gathering to unveil a plaque for the playground in the<br />
first sub-division opened by any Land Commission anywhere<br />
in Australia. was unveiled by me on the occasion of the opening of<br />
the first sub-division of the South Australian Land<br />
Commission, llth April, 1975. </p>
