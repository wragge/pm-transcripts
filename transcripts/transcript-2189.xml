FOR PRESS: PM. No. 32/ 1970<br />
ANU PERFORMING ARTS CENTRE<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
Mr Duval's gift to the Australian National<br />
University is a generous and heartening gesture. The Performing<br />
Arts Centre will provide a valuable opportunity for students to broaden<br />
the cultural base of their studies.<br />
In recent years the Commonwealth Government has<br />
greatly increased its support of all branches of the arts, It is pleasing<br />
to find private citizens prepared to make substantial contributions<br />
in this field. I hope that this practice will grow and that, as is the<br />
case in many overseas countries, wealthy citizens will assist<br />
education and the arts in this way.<br />
CANBERRA, February 1970 </p>
