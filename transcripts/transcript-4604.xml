FOR PRESS 21 DECEMBER 1977<br />
The Prime Minister today announced that he had notified the<br />
Governor General that he did not intend to proceed with the<br />
appointment of Senator Glenister Sheil to the Ministry.<br />
He had taken this action after consultation with the Deputy Prime<br />
Minister, Mr Anthony.<br />
It had been intended that, upon passage of necessary legislation<br />
allowing an increase in the size of the Ministry from<br />
twenty-seven to twenty-eight, Senator Sheil would be appointed<br />
the Minister for Veterans' Affairs.-.<br />
The Prime Minister said he had informed Senator Sheil that it would<br />
be inappropriate for him to be a member of the Ministry.<br />
The Prime Minister re-affirmed the Government's complete opposition<br />
to apartheid.......<br />
* The Prime Minister recalled his statements earlier this year when<br />
he had described apartheid as a pernicious and evil doctrine which<br />
had long-been condemned from Australia. Sir Robert Menzies had<br />
condemned apartheid as early as 1961 indicating that in his view<br />
it was a policy that would end in the most frightful disaster.<br />
The Prime Minister indicated his Government's policy in relation to<br />
apartheid would not change. Any policy based on the belief that<br />
one race is superior to another is an affront to human dignity<br />
and to the well-being of mankind, and must be condemned.<br />
Mr Fraser-said-that he regretted thesedevelopments and he hoped<br />
that nobody would for one moment doubt Australia's unequivocal<br />
opposition to apartheid...<br />
The Prime Minister indicated, as he had affirmed to the Ministry<br />
yesterday, that once a person was a member of the Ministry team,<br />
whatever his personal or private views might be, he must at all<br />
times support the Ministry view and that there is no room within<br />
his Ministry for a person who is not prepared to accept that<br />
and abide by it. </p>
