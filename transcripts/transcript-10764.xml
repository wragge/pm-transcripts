    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp; OE.............................................................................................</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>May I say firstly thank you for that, it was fantastic to read</p>
<p>   in the Telegraph after a story yesterday, I think in the</p>
<p>   Women's Weekly, that your wife has made a full and complete</p>
<p>   recovery and our best wishes go to her.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's very nice of you. We all hope that's the</p>
<p>   case. She did have a bad operation a couple of years ago. She's</p>
<p>   a private person. She's spoken about it for the first time</p>
<p>   in this interview. She doesn't want to say a lot about it.</p>
<p>   Life moves on, but we are very grateful that the prognosis is very</p>
<p>   good. She's had a lot of love and support from those around</p>
<p>   her and we're very grateful to have her with us and for many</p>
<p>   years into the future we all hope.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>I think your wife probably represents to many people who don't</p>
<p>   even know her, what all our Mums and our wives should be about .</p>
<p>   She cares about her husband, she cares about her home, she cares</p>
<p>   about her family but she's a person who is an individual and</p>
<p>   strong and ....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely. Absolutely. Janette is a very strong, intelligent woman.</p>
<p>   She takes the view that the public voted for me, they didn't</p>
<p>   vote for her, therefore the idea that the wife of a Prime Minister</p>
<p>   rides on the back of his position in order to run her own agenda,</p>
<p>   she takes the view that if you want to run your own agenda, you</p>
<p>   run for office yourself. She thinks one politician in the family</p>
<p>   is enough. But she is a wonderful companion to me, wonderful, and</p>
<p>   an absolutely superb mother and I'm very grateful for all the</p>
<p>   support and the love and the protection that she's given to</p>
<p>   me and to our three children. I couldn't be more grateful for</p>
<p>   that.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>I offered the opinion and the congratulations to yourself and Mr</p>
<p>   Beazley earlier this week over a debate about some words uttered</p>
<p>   by a former Prime Minister about the level to which you men have</p>
<p>   risen in Parliament in Question Time and other areas. How do you</p>
<p>   respond personally, and how do your family respond to the sort of</p>
<p>   demeaning and insulting things that are said about you by someone</p>
<p>   who should know better?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, as always happens in a close family, you are always more</p>
<p>   upset by what is said about those you love than what is said about</p>
<p>   you. So my children and my wife from time to time no doubt get upset</p>
<p>   and angry about what is said about me. They accept that that is</p>
<p>   part of the territory. I try to avoid personal attacks. I disagree</p>
<p>   with Mr Beazley's policies. I don't think I've been</p>
<p>   guilty of personal attacks on him and I don't intend to. There's</p>
<p>   plenty to attack him on on the policy front or his lack of policy</p>
<p>   front, but you won't be finding from me insults of a personal</p>
<p>   kind. I don't think that helps politics at all. In fact, it</p>
<p>   has driven public esteem for politicians and politics down a lot</p>
<p>   and if it is felt in the community that there has been a change</p>
<p>   over the last two-and-a-quarter years on that front then I'm</p>
<p>   very pleased because I've certainly tried and I'll go</p>
<p>   on trying, and you won't get any personal abuse from me directed</p>
<p>   at Mr Beazley.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>I think what people, I think you said just earlier there that it</p>
<p>   is something perhaps people come to expect. Well, maybe we did,</p>
<p>   but I don't think we should.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't. And I think you'll be surprised. I think</p>
<p>   all of us in public life will be surprised at the positive public</p>
<p>   response if we do avoid the personal vitriol.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>Okay, to the most talked about issue on this programme this morning</p>
<p>   and, perhaps, on open line programmes right across the country,</p>
<p>   the GST. I've asked listeners to fax me, to phone me with their</p>
<p>   concerns about it. The GST, there seems to be a great misunderstanding</p>
<p>   from everyone. A retail tax. I had a fellow call me this morning</p>
<p>   and said, "Look the bloke that chops down the tree, mills it,</p>
<p>   turns it into a piece of furniture, is there 10 per cent all the</p>
<p>   way down or just when it gets sold as a piece of furniture?"</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's Â whatever the per cent is Â all the</p>
<p>   way down. But people in the chain until you get to the consumer</p>
<p>   get a refund of what they pay and the tax is ultimately borne at</p>
<p>   the retail or consumption level because that is the nature of the</p>
<p>   tax. But you pay it at every point to make itself enforcing and</p>
<p>   if you are in the middle of that supply chain and you paid it, then</p>
<p>   you have an incentive to collect it from the person you on-sell</p>
<p>   to because you then get a credit. So it has a self-policing characteristic.</p>
<p>   The other thing that's got to be said about it is that if you</p>
<p>   have a GST, the cost of some things will go up but the cost of a</p>
<p>   lot of things will go down because there are a lot of hidden taxes.</p>
<p>   I mean, it is no secret that if we introduce a GST we are going</p>
<p>   to get rid of the wholesale sales tax. Now, the wholesale sales</p>
<p>   tax has rates of 22 per cent, 32 per cent, 45 per cent. Now those</p>
<p>   hidden taxes - they've been there so long people don't</p>
<p>   know they exist - those hidden taxes, when you take them out of</p>
<p>   things like toothpaste, you take them out of household utensils,</p>
<p>   you take them out of videos, TV sets, then the price of those things</p>
<p>   is going to go down. There will be other things where there is no</p>
<p>   GST on them at the moment, I'm not going to go into exemptions</p>
<p>   at this stage, but they will go up. But the overall result will</p>
<p>   clearly be, because of the compensation that we have and the tax</p>
<p>   cuts, the overall result will be that people will not be worse off,</p>
<p>   they will be fully protected and, indeed, they will be pleasantly</p>
<p>   surprised to find how beneficial the plan is to all of them.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>The exemptions, because it has to be broad-based to work, will</p>
<p>   obviously be few and far between. It's been suggested that</p>
<p>   health will be one area, education...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I won't, Ray, for reasons I hope your listeners understand,</p>
<p>   I'm not going to try and tick things off now, to be fair to</p>
<p>   the proper presentation of the plan. It goes without saying that</p>
<p>   the broader the base, the lower the rate. And one of the reasons</p>
<p>   why you have 22 per cent, 32 per cent, 45 per cent rates in the</p>
<p>   present wholesale tax system is a lot of things aren't included</p>
<p>   in the net and you'd have to keep ramping up the rates on those</p>
<p>   other things and you create distortions in the economy. I mean,</p>
<p>   it is a bit crook if you are involved in a business of selling some</p>
<p>   of these items that carry 32 per cent and then other sections of</p>
<p>   the economy are involved where there is no taxation liability at</p>
<p>   all and that just creates absurd anomalies. I mean, the famous one</p>
<p>   about you pay 22 per cent on the family car but if you are wealthy</p>
<p>   enough to buy a Lear Jet you don't pay any wholesale tax on</p>
<p>   that. You pay it on orange juice concentrate at 12 per cent but</p>
<p>   you don't pay it on caviar. Now, those sort of examples just</p>
<p>   scream an old-fashioned, out-of-date system, when the bulk of the</p>
<p>   economy was manufacturing. </p>
<p>And the other weakness of the present system is that it kills our</p>
<p>   exporters because we export overseas normally in competition with</p>
<p>   countries that have equivalents of a goods and services tax and</p>
<p>   their exporters don't bear any tax on the inputs to the production</p>
<p>   of the goods they sell overseas, but ours do. And one of the enormous</p>
<p>   boons out of a goods and services tax system is that the exporters</p>
<p>   are relieved of their taxes on inputs and that is a huge benefit</p>
<p>   for people involved in selling and, gee, the future of Australia</p>
<p>   is all about selling overseas. If we can crack overseas markets</p>
<p>   then we've got a real economic future. If we can't, then</p>
<p>   we haven't. And that's one of the very strong reasons</p>
<p>   why I'm so committed to tax reform.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>Theresa, a caller much earlier this morning, said what about the</p>
<p>   State taxes and she's terrified about stamp duty in New South</p>
<p>   Wales as it stands at the moment. Will there be a GST on the sale</p>
<p>   of houses? If you buy a house for $200,000 are you looking down</p>
<p>   the gun barrel of a GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I guess once I start dealing with one, I'm under a moral obligation</p>
<p>   to deal with all and I won't do that. I can say to her - Theresa</p>
<p>   is it?</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>Theresa.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Theresa. Can I say to Theresa, wait until the whole plan comes</p>
<p>   out and you will see it is very fair, there is full protection and</p>
<p>   compensation for low-income earners. And that is something that</p>
<p>   we've put a lot of effort into because we do not intend to</p>
<p>   hurt the poor. We will protect the poor, encourage the thrifty,</p>
<p>   hard-working, energetic people and give a real boost to Australia's</p>
<p>   export prospects.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>Mimi said, along those lines, not disadvantaging the unemployed</p>
<p>   and elderly, what guarantee that the rebate will match what they</p>
<p>   actually pay in increased food costs...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it will, it will. It will.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>It just will.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It will.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>How long will they have to wait for that rebate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, we're obviously not going to hit people with some kind</p>
<p>   of tax they're not now paying and then say wait six months</p>
<p>   before you sort of get protection. Look, the whole thing will operate</p>
<p>   in a way that people are not left worse off. There will be some</p>
<p>   people worse off. The cheats will be worse off but people who are</p>
<p>   paying their way and working hard and, particularly people on low</p>
<p>   incomes, will be protected. I mean, we have no intention of introducing</p>
<p>   a system that slugs the poor, that rides off the back of the poor.</p>
<p>   We won't do that as a matter of moral commitment, nor would</p>
<p>   we do it for other reasons.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>In various industries at the moment there's a black economy</p>
<p>   and we've had one caller from New Zealand who suggested to</p>
<p>   us, Ann it was, that the black economy is flourishing there under</p>
<p>   a GST. That's in contrast to what we're being told. I</p>
<p>   think there's probably a black economy flourishing under our</p>
<p>   current tax system. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, well there is obviously a black economy in Australia and one</p>
<p>   of the great advantages of a broadly based, indirect tax is that</p>
<p>   you pay it on things...if you are into the black economy and</p>
<p>   you are evading income tax and you buy, you know, some people go</p>
<p>   out and spend an enormous amount of money on restaurant meals, they</p>
<p>   might be into the black economy. Now, if they pay a GST on that,</p>
<p>   I'm not saying whether they will or they won't under our</p>
<p>   system, but for example, if they do, then the bloke who's into</p>
<p>   the black and then spends $300 on an expensive night out for him</p>
<p>   and his girlfriend, he pays a bit of tax that way, whereas under</p>
<p>   the present system, he doesn't pay any. Now, I mean, that is</p>
<p>   one crude example, but nonetheless, relevant example of how people</p>
<p>   get caught and how the black economy gets caught. Now, I think there</p>
<p>   are plenty of examples to demonstrate that the black economy will</p>
<p>   be less under a tax reform plan.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>Still, it'll be there; we can't get rid of it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look, you can't get rid of them. It's like saying</p>
<p>   that any government can abolish all crime or whatever. Of course</p>
<p>   you can't get rid of it entirely but you can massively reduce</p>
<p>   it. And the only way you can reduce it massively is to have a broadly</p>
<p>   based, indirect tax or a goods and services tax.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>Self-funded retirees. I know you can't get into specifics</p>
<p>   but they are worried about land rates, body corporate fees, they</p>
<p>   say they own their car, they own everything else and they're</p>
<p>   not worried about rego, those sort of things...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Ray, I understand all of those concerns. They will all be</p>
<p>   dealt with. And self-funded retirees are a group that we intend</p>
<p>   to fully protect and compensate and when they see the details in</p>
<p>   the plan, they will know that what I'm saying to them this</p>
<p>   morning is absolutely right. </p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>Okay. I was, well, not horrified, but surprised recently at some</p>
<p>   television pictures of David Kemp kissing a baby. Now, when David</p>
<p>   Kemp kisses babies I have a feeling an election is not too far away.</p>
<p>   Nice fella that he is...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, well he is a very nice fellow and he has a couple of fairly</p>
<p>   young children. David was, on that particular occasion, he was actually</p>
<p>   launching a whole set of work-for-the-dole projects and we are very</p>
<p>   proud of the work-for-the-dole scheme. Mr Beazley doesn't like</p>
<p>   it. He'll get rid of it. But we are very proud of it because</p>
<p>   it helps to instill the work ethic in young unemployed people. </p>
<p>When will the election be? My stock response Ray is some time between</p>
<p>   now and when it is due. It's due in March or April of next</p>
<p>   year. I expect that we'll release the plan very soon and then</p>
<p>   I want the Australian people to have a look at it. I don't</p>
<p>   intend to drop the plan and then run off to the Governor General</p>
<p>   the next day. I want people to have a look at it. I want them to</p>
<p>   ask me questions about it. I want to have the opportunity of travelling</p>
<p>   the country to explain it because it is a great plan that is going</p>
<p>   to give Australia a much better economic future.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>We've had, I guess in some respects, some of the bad news</p>
<p>   in the papers today and on radio and on television...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's speculation. I mean, that hasn't come from</p>
<p>   me.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>Would it be good speculation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I neither confirm nor deny speculation but I do want to caution</p>
<p>   people and say that, you know, there is a lot of stuff in papers.</p>
<p>   It is speculation. There have been no authorised leaks. </p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>Well, just say there's an unauthorised leak...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No unauthorised...</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>Just say we've got the bad news today, when is the good news</p>
<p>   going to come about those tax cuts?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The plan will be all announced very soon and it will be announced</p>
<p>   as a whole and I ask your listeners to look at it as a whole and</p>
<p>   when they look at it as a whole, believe me, they'll see it</p>
<p>   for what it is. It is a terrific plan to secure Australia's</p>
<p>   economic future. It will contain personal income tax cuts, yes.</p>
<p>   That was one of the five principles that I laid down. And those</p>
<p>   tax will include especially fair treatment of families. That was</p>
<p>   another principle that I laid down. Clearly it will, and it will</p>
<p>   contain protection for unemployed people and for people who are</p>
<p>   on other benefits. I mean, we're not going to leave those people</p>
<p>   worse off. That would be unfair and it would be rightly criticised</p>
<p>   and you can protect people. And I noticed the remark that was made,</p>
<p>   which I appreciated very much, from Cardinal Clancy this morning.</p>
<p>   I thought that the Catholic Bishops issued a very fair statement.</p>
<p>   They said it was a question of waiting to see the entire plan. They</p>
<p>   expressed their own preference in relation to certain things, I</p>
<p>   understand that, but they then said, "well, we'll make</p>
<p>   a judgment when we see the whole plan." They want the poor</p>
<p>   protected, I understand that, and I say to them we will protect</p>
<p>   the poor. But I thank them for saying that people should have a</p>
<p>   look at the whole plan.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>We've implored people to do that, as well, today and yesterday</p>
<p>   but, at the end of the day, we need taxation reform. If, as a whole,</p>
<p>   the Australian community contributes a thousand dollars in tax,</p>
<p>   under the new plan they are not going to contribute $894 or $906.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can assure you of this at this stage, at least, that the</p>
<p>   total tax burden is not going to rise.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>It's not going to increase?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's not going to increase. That was the first of the five</p>
<p>   principles I laid down. So that is what I am willing to say now,</p>
<p>   I'm willing to say that. When you see the details of the plan</p>
<p>   then I ask people to make a judgment themselves about what's</p>
<p>   happened to the overall tax take. We are not in the business of</p>
<p>   putting up people's taxes. I mean, this government has not</p>
<p>   increased any taxes, we've cut taxes for families, we've</p>
<p>   cut capital gains tax, we've cut provisional tax. We are not</p>
<p>   in the business of putting them up. What we want to do is to give</p>
<p>   the nation a new tax system that will give it greater economic strength</p>
<p>   for the next century. This is good for Australia as well as being</p>
<p>   good for individual Australians.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>I know you are an optimist.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I am.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>St George charge into the grand final on September 27th,</p>
<p>   they beat Brisbane thanks to a Anthony Mundine field goal, and there's</p>
<p>   an election a fortnight later.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Ah, gee. Well, it's a great idea. The only trouble is you</p>
<p>   need to allow longer than </p>
<p>14 days between the calling of an election and the holding of an</p>
<p>   election. Ray, all I can say is that whether you vote Labor or Liberal,</p>
<p>   those followers of St George have been given great heart this year.</p>
<p>   They really have behaved tremendously well and I, as their patron,</p>
<p>   their very proud patron, am certainly cheering for them and I hope</p>
<p>   that I'll be there. Well, I know a lot of Liberal and Labor</p>
<p>   people will be cheering for St George in that last weekend in September.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>Well, that's why I say you're an optimist. See, I know</p>
<p>   you can't do it in 14 days so you do it in a couple of weeks</p>
<p>   and then you say, "Right we're in the grand final, then</p>
<p>   we'll ride on the back of the election just after that."</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think we'll - I'd better be careful what I say - I</p>
<p>   might sort of set the tongues wagging but, Ray, we'll hold</p>
<p>   the election at the right time. Jokes aside, I do want the people</p>
<p>   of Australia to have plenty of time to look at our tax plan. They're</p>
<p>   entitled to that. It is very comprehensive. It is the biggest change</p>
<p>   to Australia's taxation system for a long time but it is not</p>
<p>   a revolution. We don't want a revolution but we do need to</p>
<p>   see it as the next step needed to protect Australia against the</p>
<p>   Asian economic downturn and because of what's happening in</p>
<p>   Asia we must reform the tax system. What's happening in Asia</p>
<p>   is not a reason to stop the process of reform.</p>
<p>HADLEY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thank you very much for your time, we do appreciate</p>
<p>   it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
