PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH TO WILLS FEA LUNCHEON CELEBRATING<br />
ANNIVERSARY AS FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WILLS, ST FIDELIS HALL,<br />
COBURG, 14 OCTOBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: Now I don't resile from the fact, my friends, that at this<br />
moment things are tougher than they've been for some time.<br />
This Labor Government and this Labor Prime Minister would not be<br />
slowing things up, tightening things up, if it were not<br />
absolutely necessary. We have paid to some extent the price of<br />
our previous success. Because of the enormous growth that we<br />
generated, a rate of economic growth which was about twice what<br />
was being experienced by many other countries with which we'd<br />
normally compare ourselves, because of our enormous employment<br />
growth, we were bringing in a level of imports that unfortunately<br />
we were not able to pay for. We had to slow things down. We<br />
have witnessed in these last 12 months a situation where because<br />
of tighter monetary policy businesses have been suffering and<br />
people have been suffering. We've had to do that, we've had to<br />
slow the economy down.<br />
But I'm here today to say to you that we've virtually reached the<br />
end of that point. That we've now reached the stage where we<br />
believe that enough has been done and that the time is coming in<br />
the very near future when that restraint which has been necessary<br />
is going to be able to be eased.<br />
That doesn't mean, because it would be silly, it would be against<br />
all our own best interests and against the interests of our<br />
children in particular, if we just took the brakes off too much,<br />
because until we are in a position where we are going to be able<br />
more to meet demand within our own country rather than relying<br />
upon imports, until we are more in that position we would just be<br />
creating the circumstances for a much worse recession.<br />
But I think the signs are there that we've now gone far enough.<br />
I am totally confident that as we go into 1991 and through 92 we<br />
will see signiLficant economic recovery. We will see Australians<br />
understanding that this temporary restraint has been necessary.<br />
We'll see that: steady resumption of significant employment<br />
growth, of economic growth which is going to restore the sense of<br />
security that we have built up over this period of time.<br />
