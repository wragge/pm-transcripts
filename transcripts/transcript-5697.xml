GIFT OF TRAFFIC MONITORING EQUIP-4, ENT 25 No iV1 S<br />
The Commonwealth Government has decided to presetWto<br />
the State of Victoria the closed circuit television<br />
system which was installed in Melbourne to assist with<br />
traffic monitoring and control and security surveillance<br />
during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.<br />
The equipment comprises 25 remote controlled television<br />
cameras, mountings and environmental" housing plus<br />
extensive monitoring and control equipment installed<br />
in the Melbourne City Council's traffic control room<br />
and at the Russell Street police complex.<br />
The system proved invaluable during CHOGM. I understand<br />
the Melbourne City Council and the Victoria Police<br />
especially want the system to be retained in Melbourne<br />
for the long term benefits in traffic monitoring and<br />
control that it can provide, and for security<br />
surveillance on normal VIP routes in Melbourne.<br />
In total, the system cost the Commonwealth over $ 550,000,<br />
including installation and commissioning costs, plus<br />
a substantial outlay for cabling. The Government has<br />
now concluded, after considering alternative uses for<br />
the equipment, that the best value for the money spent<br />
on it lies in its continued use as an operational unit<br />
to benefit traffic in Melbourne now and in the future,<br />
and for security purposes.<br />
Accordingly, I am delighted to announce that, in<br />
recognition of the co-operation of the State of Victoria<br />
and the Melbourne City Council in the conduct of the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, of the e:-: cellent<br />
work of the Victoria Police and the hospitality extended<br />
by Melbourne to its visitors, the Commonealth GovernmenL<br />
has decided to leave the equipment in Melbourne as a<br />
gift to the State. A .7 V 4 c<br />
