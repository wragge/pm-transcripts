PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO,. 357<br />
October 1974<br />
INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION REPORT -STEAM, GAS<br />
AND WATER FITTINGS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced today<br />
that the Government has accepted the recommendations of the<br />
Industries Assistance Commission in its report on steam,<br />
gas and water fittings, subject to international commitments.<br />
The report was released on 13 August 1974.<br />
The report covers tube and pipe fittings of nonferrous<br />
metals and valves ( including actuators). The fittings<br />
are predominantly of copper or its alloys and, of these, most<br />
are plumbing fittings. The large range of valves varies in<br />
type, size and application.<br />
The Government's decision to implement the<br />
Commission's recommendations will mean that a rate of duty<br />
of 25 per cent will apply to valves and actuators and a rate<br />
of 20 per cent to tube and pipe fittings of copper, nickel and<br />
their alloys. Minimum rates will apply to tube and pipe<br />
fittings of other metals.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that details of the customs tariff<br />
changes and revised by-law arrangements arising from the<br />
Government's acceptance of the Commission's report will be<br />
announced when administrative arrangements to implement them<br />
have been finalised. In the interests of consistency, in<br />
the tariff treatment of valves some minor changes in respect<br />
of certain valves not covered by the Commission's report will<br />
also be announced.<br />
