TRANSCRIPT -PRIME MINISTER AT FRAGRANT HILLS HOTEL, PEKING<br />
FEBRUARY 1Y84<br />
E AND 0 E -PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: PRIME MINISTER THE STEEL PLAN YOU OUTLINED TO PREMIER<br />
ZHAO. HOW REALISTIC IS IT? DO YOU BELIEVE IT CAN SUCCEED?<br />
YES I BELIEVE IT CAN SUCCEED AND THE RA2IC REASON WHY I BEL-<br />
IEVE IT CAN SUCCEED IS THAT THERE ARE MANIFEST ADVANTAGES FOR BOTH<br />
CHINA AND OURSELVELS. IT HAS TO BE UN4DERSTOOD THAT IT'S NOT A TRADE<br />
PLAN AS SUCH, ALTHOUGH IT OBVIOUSLY HAS GREAT ADVANTAGES FOR OUR TRA-<br />
DE. BUT IT REPRESENTS MUCH MORE AN INTEGRATION OF OUR IRON AND STEEL<br />
INDUSTRIES IN A WAY WHICH MAKES A GREAT DEAL OF SENSE FOR CHINA AND<br />
OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A VERZY CONSID) ERABLE EXPANSION OF OUR OWN<br />
INDUSTRY. AND I CAN SAY THAT FOLLOWING OUR TALKS YESTERDAY WITH<br />
PREMIER ZHAO AT THE FUNCTION AT THE EMBASSY LAST NIGHT TALKS WERE<br />
HELD, DISCUSSIONS WERE HELD WITH<br />
SHOE ONE XTHHIEB ITTEADL KSA VCEORUYL D HIGGEHT GDEOGINRGEE, OINTFD HIECIN ATMTEEIRNDEI SSTTAE RAD NEDFS OIRRWE A MNOTEENTD A LHLTIUSOR GOKYWN ONW L PI. AH ORWT NTD O<br />
COME TO AUSTRALIA AND TALK WITH OUR PEOPLE ZRE. AND I HAVE ALREADY<br />
INITIATIED AT OUR END THE ARRANGEMEN4TS TO GET TOGETHER THE<br />
APPROPRIATE GROUP AND I WILL, THIS EVENING, IN MY DISCUSSIONS AT OUR<br />
RETURN BANQUET WITH PREMIER ZHAO BE INDICATItlG THE WAY IN WHICH WE'VE<br />
MOVED AND EXPRESS THE HOPE TO HIM THAT RECIPROCALLY THEY WILL BE ABLE<br />
TO MOVE AS QUICKLY, SO THAT THE ACTUAL JOINT PARTY CAN MEET TOGETHZR<br />
IN rHE NEAR FUTURE.<br />
JOURNALIST: WHAT SORT OF IMPACT DO YOU THINK THIS WILL HAVE ON THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN STEEL INDUSTRYIN TERMS OF JOBS AND PRODUCTION?<br />
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO PUT FIGURES ON IT AT THIS STAGE EXCEPT<br />
TO SAY THIS THAT IF WE ONLY GOT A R~ ELATIV'ELY SMALL PROPORTION OF<br />
THE GROWTH IN THE CHINESE INDUSTRY, TOWARDS THE END OF THIS CENTURY<br />
IT COULD REPRESENT SOMETHING LIKE A DOUBLING OF OUR CAPACITY OF<br />
INDUSTRY IN AUSTRALIA. AND I DON'T WANT TO OPEN UP UNDULY WIDE<br />
EXPE: CTATIONS, BUT I DO MAKE THIS POINT THAT THE CONCEPT OBVIOUSLY IS<br />
ECONOMICALLY ATTRACTIVE TO T( HE CHINESE AS WELL AS TO OURSELVES. AND<br />
IT MUST BE SEEN AS CAPABLE OF SOME SORT OF EXTENSION TO OTHER<br />
COUNTRIES IN OUR REGION. AND WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT AS WELL.<br />
JOURNALIST: RELUCTANT TO MOVE INTO STEEL EXPORTS IN THE PAST.<br />
HY DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THIS<br />
TIME. AND SECONDLY,<br />
WILL AUSTRALIA'S INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BE A PROBLEM IN THIS SORT' OF<br />
PLAN AND DID YOU DISCUSS THIS WITH THE PREMIER? </p>
<p>GOING TO IHE FIRST QUESTION IN THE PAST B( HP, AS YOU RIGHTLY<br />
SAY, HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT LESS THAN IMAGINATIVE AND ADVENTURESOME IN<br />
ITS PLANNING IN REGARD TO EXPORT MARKETS. BUT I THINK ONE MUST SAY<br />
THIS THAT NOW THE ECONOMIC REALITIES OF THE WORLD SITUATION ARE<br />
IMPOSING CERTAIN IMPERATIVES UPON THE PLANNING STRUCTURES AND INTENTIONS<br />
OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING IN OUR REGION. AND<br />
THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS ON THE PART OF THESE COUNTRIES IN OUR REGION<br />
QUITE COMPELLING REASONS WHY. THEY SHOULD NOW BE PREPARED TO DISCUSS<br />
WITH US PLANS ON A LONG TERM BASIS FOR THE SUPPLY RAW STEEL. WE ARE<br />
NOT NOW IN THE PERIOD THAT PERHAPS CHARACTERISED THE 50' AND<br />
AND THE EARLY ' 70' S WERE THERE WERE SORT OF UNLIMITED VISTAS OPEN<br />
TO A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD DO EVERYTHING<br />
THEMSELVES. YOU REALISE THAT IN THE TOUGHER INTERHATIONAL<br />
ENVIRONMENT NOW IT MAKES SENSE TO ALL COUNTRIES TO SEE HOW BY SOME<br />
DEGREE OF INTEGRATION WITH OTHER COUNTRIES THEY CAN REDUCE THEIR OWN<br />
INVESTMENT LEVELS AND DEMANDS AND SO THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE<br />
REASONS ARE GREATER NOW. THE OTHER POINT I WOULD MAKE IS THAT IN THE<br />
PAST YOU'VE HAD CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENTS IN AUSTRALIA WHO HAVEN'T<br />
BEEN COMMITTED TO THE CONCEPT OF AN INTEGRATED PLANNING APPROACH FOR<br />
THE BENEFIT OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY AT THAT PRESENT TIME ANDI INTO<br />
THE FUTURE. YOU PO NOW HAVE A GOVERNMENT WHICH IS CONCERNED IN CONSULTATION<br />
WITH INDUSTRY TO PLAN AND THINK FOR THE FUTURE. SO I THINK<br />
THCSE TWO FACTORS, THE EXOGENOUS REALITIES, IF YOU LIKE, OF THE INTER<br />
-NATIONAL ECONOMIC SITUATION ON THE ONE HAND, AND SECONDLY, THE FACT<br />
THAT YOU DO HAVE A GOVERNMENT COMMITTED TO PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.<br />
THOSE TWO FACTORS MAKE THE DIFFERENCE.<br />
THE SECOND QUESTION THAT MR KELLY HAD ASKED AND THAT WAS IN REGARD TO<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS YES, I SPECIFICALLY RAISED THIS QUESTION WITH<br />
PREMIER ZHAO AND INDICATED THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO ENTER INTO THIS<br />
IN7EGRATION OF OUR IRON AND STEEL ECONOMIES THEN WE WOULD UNDER<br />
-STAND THE DESIRE ON THEIR PART TO HAVE A CONTINUITY OF SUPPLY. AND<br />
I INDICATED TO HIM, INDEED I GAVE HIM THE UiNDERTAKING, THAT PART OF<br />
OUR COMMITMENT IN THIS PROCESS WOULD BE THAT NOT AT THE END, AS SO<br />
OFTEN HAPPENS IN THE PAST, WHERE YOU'VE ESTABLISHED AN ENTERPRISE<br />
AND GET THINGS GOING AND THEN YOU START TO THINK ABOUT INDUSTRIAL<br />
RELATIONS AT THE OUTSET WE WOULD BE TALKING WITH THE UNIONS SO THAT<br />
IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS RELATIONSHIPMENT THERE WOULD BE<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS CONTIRACTS ENTERED INTO WHICH WOULD HAVE GRIEVANCE<br />
PROCEDURES SO THAT THERE WOULD BE A CAPACITY ON THE PART OF OUR<br />
CUSTOMERS AND OUR PARTNERS IN SUICH AN INTEGRATED PROCESS OF KNOWING<br />
THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO HAVE THEIR SUPPLIES INTERRUPTED AS A<br />
RESULT OF AVOIDABLE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS TROUBLES. SO THAT WOULD BE<br />
DONE AT THE OUTSET WE WOULD NEGOTIATE WITH THE UNIONS TO GIVE<br />
CONFIDENCE TO OUR PARTNERS.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( INAUDIBLE)<br />
THE TOTAL INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS CONTRACTS, IN WHICH WE INCLUDE<br />
THE WAGES ELEMENT. BUT, OF COURSE, WE HAVE THAT PART OF THE INDUSTRIAL<br />
RELATIONS SITUATION COVERED BY THE NATIONAL ACCORD AS IT IS NOW.<br />
JOURNALIST: IS THIS JUST THE BEGINNING, PRIME MINISTER. CAN YOU<br />
IDENTIFY ANY OTHER AREAS WHERE WE CAN<br />
OBVIOUSLY IHE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY IS BASIC FOR TWO REASONS<br />
IT IS BASIC TO ALL ECONOMIES. BUT SECONDLY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR </p>
<p>US BECAUSE AUSTRALIA IS BLESSED WITH ' W! E CONJUNCTION OF UNLIMITED<br />
IRON ORE SUPPLIES AND COKING COAL SUPPLI. ES OF TOP QUALITY. AND<br />
THEREFORE IT MAKES SENSE TO START IN THIS AREA. AS I SAID TO YOJ<br />
BEFORE THIS REPRESENTS A CONCEPT THAT I HAVE BEEN THINKIN~ G ABCUT<br />
FOR A LONG TIME.' IT REPRESENTED A PART OF OUR THINKING AND ANALYSIS<br />
IN THE CRAWFORD INQUIRY. AND WHILE THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY LE1NDS<br />
ITSELF MOST IMMEDIATELY AND FUNDAMENTALLY TO OUR THINKING OBVIOUSLY<br />
WE WOULD WANT TO BE THINKING, AS I'VE SAID AS YOU KNOW FOR MONTHS AND<br />
ON THIS TRIP, ABOUT HOW WE CAN ENMESH AND INTEGRATE OUR ECONOMY WITrH<br />
THIS REGION. BECAUSE, I REPEAT, AS IT WOULD HAVE BECOME APPARENT TO<br />
ALL OF YOU NOW I THINK(, OF JUST HOW DUNAIIIC AND RAPIDLY GROWING THIS<br />
WHOLE REGION IS. AND IT'S MANIFESTLY FOR THE FUTURE BENEFIT OF<br />
ALL AUSTRALIANS IF WE CAN INCREASE THIS DEGREE OF INTEGRATION.<br />
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT ON OUR PLATE NOW IN GIVING EFFECT TO THE<br />
AGREEMENT WITH THE CHIN4ESE TO STUD) Y THIS INTEGRATION IN THE IRON AND<br />
STEEL INDUSTRY. AND I REPEAT I HAVE ALREADY INITIATED THE WORK ON<br />
OUR SIDE AND I BELIEVE THAT THE CHINESE ARE READY TO MOVE JUST AS<br />
QUICKLY AS WE ARE. </p>
