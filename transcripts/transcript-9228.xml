TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH NEIL MERCER, " 111 AM", CHANNEL 7, 11 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
NM: Dr Hewson says interest rates will go up as a result of this Budget,<br />
what is your response to that?<br />
PM: That is nonsense. Look, Neil, the Liberals sat there last night like<br />
they'd all sucked on a lemon. They are the sourest looking bunch you<br />
could imagine and one of our wags yelled out ' give them the smelling<br />
salts'. This is the Budget they'd thought would be their own. The<br />
growth they would claim as their own.<br />
NMV: You are looking pretty cocky about all this.<br />
PM: Well, this is a tip top Budget for growth and for employment: 4.5 per<br />
cent growth; nearly a quarter of a Million new extra jobs and the deficit<br />
going down.<br />
NM: So, interest rates won't rise?<br />
PM: No, because you've got..<br />
NM: You are quite sure about that?<br />
PM: Well, you can never say interest rates won't rise, but they won't be<br />
rising on the back of this Budget. That is, you've got low inflation<br />
forecast again that is one of the principal determinants of interest<br />
rates and the Budget coming in as the Government said in the<br />
election campaign under 1 per cent of GDP, now under 1 per cent of<br />
GDP by 1996-97.<br />
NM: Again, the Opposition says you've cooked the books, your growth<br />
forecasts are wildly optimistic 4.5 per cent are wildly optimistic. </p>
<p>2<br />
PM: Well, we are already doing 4 per cent. For the year to March it is 4<br />
per cent. So, their big debating point is whether it is 4 or 4.5 per cent.<br />
This is the same Dr Hewson that told us we'd be now in a double dip<br />
recession. Remember in the election campaign, he was forecasting a<br />
double dip recession. We are growing now as fast as any other OECD<br />
economy, in fact faster than most. The average of the western<br />
countries, they are growing at 1 per cent. We are already growing at 4<br />
per cent and we're forecast to grow at 4.5 per cent.<br />
NM: You've talked in the past about getting up on stage and doing the<br />
Placido Dimingo. How do you think the markets will judge this<br />
performance tonight?<br />
PM: Well, I think, more importantly, the markets in a sense, are not my<br />
principal concern here. It is the business community. They are the<br />
people who employ people. They are the people that do the business<br />
and we've got business investment in here very strong in the coming<br />
year. So, it is that which matters most and people shuffling financial<br />
assets, they catch up with the game always at the end. But the people<br />
who I wanted to influence are those who are making investment<br />
decisions and making decisions to employ Australians.<br />
NM: It has been said it is a very benign Budget, no tax increases. Are you<br />
setting the scene for an early election?<br />
PM: No, no. They are too hard to win without giving away time free of<br />
charge.<br />
NM: On a specific issue, your Government has spent or will spend a lot of<br />
money on breast cancer research, breast cancer screening. Is this an<br />
issue that you feel particularly strong about? I remember when you<br />
won the election, on the night you won, you particularly thanked the<br />
women of Australia.<br />
PM: Yes, I think the women of Australian did support the Government in full<br />
measure. My wife was almost, in public terms, alone on this issue over<br />
the last eighteen months or so. She is very pleased by the $ 209<br />
million program we have over the next four years: to understand how<br />
this disease affects people and how it can be treated, that is in primary<br />
research as well as prevention and extending the screening program<br />
as well.<br />
NM: Well, just talk about that a little bit if you can. How much of an<br />
influence on you was your wife?<br />
PM: In this?<br />
NM: Yes. </p>
<p>PM: Well, I think she pointed out to me the intractable nature of this<br />
problem the frequency of it and the trauma, let alone the loss that<br />
comes from it. So, she has made me more aware of it and as a<br />
consequence of that and, I think, dare I say good policy, I think, we<br />
can allocate money here to a reasonably ambitious program.<br />
NM: And it's something you discussed at home, is that an issue you<br />
discussed at home?<br />
PM: Yes, she has been on my back about this for quite a while?<br />
NM: And what sort of things did she say to you when she was getting on<br />
your back?<br />
PM: The death rate, I mean, once a women contracts this disease it is very<br />
hard to throw it off and so it is either a tragic terminal position or it is<br />
one where people have their life style substantially changed.<br />
NM: And you are confident that the input of money will change what is<br />
happening at the moment?<br />
PM: I think, that it deserves a larger research funding program as well as<br />
extending the screening program, so we actually get to early detection.<br />
NM: On the question of unemployment, you've got a young son who is<br />
around the age, at the youth end of the work force. Is that also an<br />
influence on you when you drew up the jobs package last week. Do<br />
you think about him and say, well, what are his prospects?<br />
PM: I do and I think about my girls too. I think, that there is a view amongst<br />
young Australians that no one is interested in them.<br />
NM: No one cares.<br />
PM: And it is not true because we've now got a much higher level of<br />
retention in schools, many more places in universities, we are now<br />
reforming-TAFE and the Government is very interested in them, but<br />
there is often with many people a sense of either loneliness or that<br />
they are not being included and they get dejected. I think, that<br />
particularly for unemployed people, so case managing personally each<br />
unemployed person under 18 is going to be an important moral and<br />
morale building thing as well as it is going to be a practical thing<br />
seeing them get training and work. So, I think, the notion of saying<br />
" look, the country is interested in you, we are interested in you and we<br />
want to try and manage you into a better situation in life," is, I think,<br />
going to be very important to young Australians.<br />
NM: Prime Minister, given what happened last year with the Senate and the<br />
Budget, it was a bit of a shemozzle, what do you expect to happen this<br />
year, will the Greens and the Democrats support you? </p>
<p>PM: I think so because most of the things we are doing, the big Aboriginal<br />
Land Fund, the Aboriginal health issues, breast cancer, -the<br />
immunisation program, the $ 135 million program for the preparation of<br />
our Olympians coming up to Olympic athletes, all of these things, I<br />
think, would sit rather comfortably with the Democrats and the Greens.<br />
NM: Just on that point, you are spending $ 135 million on our Olympic<br />
athletes, but only $ 62 million on the homeless. For a Labor<br />
Government, shouldn't it be the other way around?<br />
PM: That is $ 135 million over six years. The homeless program is<br />
essentially managed by the states. We complement them and improve<br />
them in some places and we are doing that on this occasion.<br />
NM: Prime Minister, thanks very much for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
ends </p>
