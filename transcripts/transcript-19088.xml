<p>The Gillard Government today announced the appointment of Ms Megan Mitchell as Australia's first National Children's Commissioner.</p>
<p>The Government congratulates Megan Mitchell on this important and historic appointment.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is establishing a dedicated advocate for children and young people at a national level as part of our commitment to giving kids the best start in life.</p>
<p>Ms Mitchell is a strong voice for vulnerable children in her current role as New South Wales Commissioner for Children and Young People and she will bring that experience to the national stage</p>
<p>We want every child to grow up safe, happy and well. The new Commissioner will make sure the needs of children and young people are put front and centre.</p>
<p>Importantly, Ms Mitchell will have a clear focus on vulnerable or at-risk groups of children, such as children with disability, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, homeless children or those who are witnessing or subjected to violence.</p>
<p>The appointment of the National Commissioner is a key achievement under the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children 2009-2020.</p>
<p>The work of the former Attorney-General Nicola Roxon MP in establishing Australia's first ever National Children's Commissioner was acknowledged by the Government.</p>
<p>The National Children's Commissioner will sit within the Australian Human Rights Commission, Australia's national independent statutory body dealing with human rights.</p>
<p>The Commissioner will promote public discussion and awareness of issues affecting children; conduct research and education programs; consult directly with children and representative organisations; and examine Commonwealth legislation, policies and programs that relate to children's human rights</p>
<p>The ACT Children &amp; Young People Commissioner, Mr Alasdair Roy, ran a series of sessions in the ACT with students between the ages of 9 and 11 as part of the selection process.</p>
<p>Ms Mitchell has been appointed as National Children's Commissioner for a period of five years commencing 25 March 2013.  </p>
