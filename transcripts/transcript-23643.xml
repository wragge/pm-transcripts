    <content><![CDATA[<p>Later this year, Brisbane will host the leaders of the worldâs biggest economies at the G20 summit.</p>
<p>This yearâs summit will focus on boosting economic growth â because stronger economic growth is the key to addressing almost every global problem.</p>
<p>The outcome should be more jobs, better infrastructure, freer trade and greater co-operation â because these are the foundations of stronger economies.</p>
<p>As President, Australia is already leading by example.</p>
<p>The Governmentâs Economic Action Strategy is delivering results.</p>
<p>Since the end of last year, 110,000 new jobs have been created.</p>
<p>Weâve also held a red tape repeal day to cut 50,000 pages of unnecessary red tape â as part of our plan to save Australians $1 billion in red tape costs every year.</p>
<p>Weâre also scrapping bad taxes like the carbon tax and the mining tax â and the Government will keep talking to the new Senate so that this can happen as soon as possible.</p>
<p>And the Government has signed free trade agreements with Korea and Japan.</p>
<p>The agreement with Japan will benefit our farmers and our businesses â 97 per cent of Australiaâs exports to Japan will receive preferential access or enter duty-free once the Agreement is fully implemented.</p>
<p>And consumers here will benefit from less expensive Japanese cars and parts, and from lower prices on household items like white goods and electronics.</p>
<p>This coming week, business leaders from around the world will meet in Sydney.</p>
<p>My message to them is that Australia is open for business. Â Together, we can foster growth and we can and will create more jobs.</p>
