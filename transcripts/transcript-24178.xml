    <content><![CDATA[<p>In a boost to northern Australia, from 1 March 2015, Townsville airport will be able to support regular international flights.</p>
<p>Increased visitor numbers will boost the tourism industry in northern Australia, encouraging businesses to invest and helping to unlock the regionâs full potential.</p>
<p>Queensland Airports Ltd has already commenced talks to secure the first international air services into Townsville.</p>
<p>I hope that these plans can now be finalised and flights can commence in the near future.</p>
<p>This announcement follows in-principle agreement of the National Passenger Processing Committee to facilitate international services at Townsville airport.</p>
<p>Opening Townsville airport to international flights helps to deliver on the governmentâs commitment to developing the north.</p>
<p>The White Paper on Developing Northern Australia will set out a clear plan for realising the full economic potential of the north.</p>
<p>We congratulate Ewen Jones MP, Federal Member for Herbert, for his strong advocacy for this important project.</p>
