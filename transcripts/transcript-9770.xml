PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
HANDOVER OF THE EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL HIV/ AIDS<br />
STRATEGY, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
CANBERRA, 27 SEPTEMBER 1995<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
On your behalf, and on behalf of the Commonwealth, I would like to thank<br />
Professor Feachem for the outstanding work he has done in preparing this<br />
Evaluation of the National HIV/ AIDS Strategy.<br />
Professor Feachem has been assisted in his work by dedicated officers of the<br />
Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health, who also<br />
deserve our thanks.<br />
After more than a decade of intensive policy-making, and the completion of<br />
two national HIV/ AIDS strategies, it is very useful to have an expert and<br />
knowledgeable outsider critically assess our achievements and our<br />
shortcomings. An independent evaluation is vital if public confidence is to be maintained in<br />
the essential principles of the national HIV/ AIDS policy. And as Chief Health<br />
Adviser to the World Bank, Professor Feachem is well qualified to provide an<br />
assessment. In preparing his Evaluation, Professor Feachem has travelled extensively and<br />
consulted widely.<br />
Many of the groups and organisations with whom Professor Feachem has<br />
reviewed Australia's HIV/ AIDS policies are represented here today.<br />
There are representatives of the State and Federal political parties, senior<br />
State and Federal bureaucrats, health professionals, academics, indigenous<br />
Australians, the State and Territory AIDS Councils and the Commonwealth's<br />
formal HIV/ AIDS advisory bodies. </p>
<p>Professor Feachem's report brings to the Government all your views. It<br />
brings the views of the Haemophilia Foundation Australia, and the bodies<br />
grouped around the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations the<br />
National Association of People Living With HIV/ AIDS, the Scarlet Alliance,<br />
the Australian IV League.<br />
The views of Australians living with HIV/ AIDS are perhaps the most important<br />
of all because they are, in all senses, closest to the daily challenges of the<br />
epidemic. Since 1982, their strong and distinctive voices of people have helped shape<br />
our national HIV/ AIDS policies.<br />
People living with HIV/ AIDS could be excused for concentrating solely on<br />
personal and family concerns.<br />
But they haven't. Over the past decade, people with HIV/ AIDS have<br />
transcended their circumstances, and the daily burden of coping with the<br />
virus, to make often outstanding contributions to our HIV/ AIDS policies not<br />
to mention the general life of the nation.<br />
We can learn something from their bravery. And even as we show our<br />
support for them, we can derive strength from them.<br />
As Professor Feachem has outlined this morning, Australia's response to<br />
HIV/ AIDS is recognised as being amongst the best in the world.<br />
A decade of hard and unremitting effort in this country has resulted in a<br />
welcome reduction in the rates of incidence of both HIV and AIDS.<br />
In per capita terms, we are in a much better position regarding HIV infection<br />
than, for example, Canada, France, the United States, Spain and Switzerland.<br />
And as we look to the future Australia also seems to have passed the peak<br />
incidence of AIDS infection, while the United Kingdom and the United States<br />
appear to be experiencing continuing increases.<br />
So we can be quietly pleased to have done relatively well in the fight against<br />
HIV/ AIDS.<br />
However, while ever the virus is amongst us, there can be no room for selfsatisfaction<br />
or complacency.<br />
There are presently some 14,700 people living with HIV/ AIDS. And a much<br />
larger number know people and love people afflicted with the virus.<br />
People living with HIV/ AIDS are members of the Australian family. </p>
<p>They are workers in factories and players in orchestras. They are teachers in<br />
schools and students in universities; they are clerks and journalists and<br />
artists and labourers and lawyers. They are fathers and sons and brothers.<br />
We enjoy and profit from the things they create.<br />
HIV/ AIDS affects us all in our families, our workplaces and our communities.<br />
In a sense, we are all living with the virus.<br />
HIV infection has cost Australia dearly and not only in human terms.<br />
In one year alone, 1992-93, the cost of providing treatment and care was<br />
$ 130 million.<br />
In the same year, the total indirect cost from earnings lost because of<br />
HIV/ AIDS illness and death was estimated at $ 313 million.<br />
I am convinced the human and financial cost would have been even greater if<br />
not for the partnership which has been forged between governments, the<br />
medical, scientific and caring professions, and the affected communities.<br />
Community involvement and consultation in decision-making has ensured<br />
that our actions have generally been well-founded, well-directed and wellexecuted.<br />
Where delicate balances have had to be struck, we have always engaged the<br />
public in dialogue.<br />
Some who were opposed to the shape of our policies claimed that, if the<br />
treatment of HIV/ AIDS was to be met effectively, we had to choose to protect<br />
either general, or individual, rights. They believed that the protection of the<br />
community could only be ensured by imposing sanctions, controls and<br />
ultimately isolation upon those most at risk of HIV infection.<br />
Our experience so far has demonstrated the opposite the greater the<br />
protection we afford to individual rights and responsibilities, the greater the<br />
benefit to the entire Australian community.<br />
At all times, the Commonwealth Government has acted in the firm belief that<br />
our paramount consideration must be the health and well being of the<br />
Australian people.<br />
No sectional or political consideration has ever, or will ever, stand in the way<br />
of the Government taking whatever steps are necessary to contain the spread<br />
of H IV/ AIDS. </p>
<p>However, our achievements to date as recorded in the Evaluation Report<br />
demonstrate that the best results are achieved by consultation, not coercion.<br />
Within the Federal Parliament, the spirit of bipartisanship will, I trust, continue<br />
to guide the deliberations of the Parliamentary Liaison Group on AIDS.<br />
This Group provides the best forum in which to resolve the differences that<br />
inevitably arise during the preparation of public education campaigns which<br />
involve the frank discussion of human behaviour.<br />
Nevertheless, this Government will never shrink from the need to work with<br />
and through the communities most affected by this virus.<br />
We owe this duty of care to our fellow citizens, and to our children.<br />
As we look ahead, there is little prospect of the early development and<br />
distribution of effective vaccines or cures for HIV/ AIDS, despite the welcome<br />
developments in combination treatments of HIV infection.<br />
And there are some disturbing signs, including some in the Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islander communities.<br />
And, of course, every year sees the emergence of a new group of young<br />
Australians who may be exposed to risk of infection.<br />
So we cannot lose our resolve, or drop our pace. It is clear to the<br />
Government that there remains an overwhelming need for a national<br />
HIV/ AIDS strategy.<br />
I am pleased to announce that, as recommended by Professor Feachem, the<br />
Commonwealth Government will support the establishment of a Third<br />
National HIV/ AIDS Strategy, with dedicated, secure and adequate funding for<br />
five years.<br />
As Professor Feachem has reported, the four key elements of the Strategy<br />
are: education and prevention;<br />
treatment and care;<br />
research; and<br />
international assistance and cooperation. </p>
<p>The detailed components of the Third National Strategy will be decided upon<br />
after consideration of the recommendations contained within the Evaluation,<br />
discussions between all governments, and consultation with non-government<br />
organisations and the general public.<br />
These processes must be conducted responsibly but also quickly.<br />
The over-riding objectives of the Third National Strategy must be:<br />
to care for those affected by HIV/ AIDS;<br />
to conduct further research into the nature of the virus and its<br />
transmission; to redouble efforts to prevent new infections within the national territory<br />
of Australia; and<br />
to assist in the international effort to contain the spread of the virus,<br />
particularly within the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
It is tragic to think of the people Australia has lost to HIV/ AIDS and with<br />
those people, all of their energy and creativity and strength.<br />
It is important to remember the lives we have lost.<br />
But it is also important to remember the lives we have saved through<br />
intelligent government policies and generous community cooperation.<br />
I think Australians can derive some measure of pride from the way we have<br />
fought this virus. In the best Australian tradition, we have shown our belief in<br />
practical, constructive measures.<br />
We have stuck together as Australians.<br />
And in that spirit we should go forward.<br />
Thank you. </p>
