ACCEPTANCE OF THE SIR HUBERT MURRAY PAPERS<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR JOHN GORTON, ON<br />
BEHALF OF THE INATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA<br />
Canberra, A. C. T._ 6 DECEMEF 1968<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
Sir Grenfell, Mrs Pinney, Dr West and Members of the National Library<br />
Council This seems to be fundamentally, at any rate ostensibly, a<br />
strictly family occasion, as it were, and I feel very privileged indeed to be<br />
able to share in it and to accept on behalf of the Council these historical<br />
letters which you have so generously donated.<br />
It is appropriate, I think, that on such a day you, Sir, as the<br />
eminent biographer of Sir Hubert Murray should be with us, and perhaps<br />
even more appropriate that you should be with us on this occasion in this<br />
place as the son-in-law of Harold White who adds to the flavour of this<br />
gathering. Mr Harold White's acquisitive instincts, of course, are quite<br />
well known, as far as the Library is concerned, but I am not sure whether<br />
in this case he was the chief hunter after the letters which are before us or<br />
whether indeed they were freely offered, as I believe they were, by Mrs<br />
Pinney and by Dr West.<br />
Sir, you have described Sir Hubert Murray as a great pro-consul<br />
as indeed he was a great colonialist, It is not a word which tends to be<br />
in fashion nowadays, to be a colonialist, but I think that looking back on the<br />
times of which we are speaking, it has to be accepted that the colonial rule<br />
which Sir Hubert carried out was of immense benefit to Papua at that time<br />
and that it would have been impossible for that country to have developed to<br />
the state where colonialism is no longer acceptable had it not been for the<br />
guidance of this man.<br />
He was a man of many parts. We hear cif him first or I hear<br />
of him first when he was at school, from which, if I am not inr"' rrectly<br />
informed, he was ejected for taking a punch at one of his masters a thing<br />
for which I envy him very much because it was something I always wanted to<br />
do when I was at school. I can only think that the master concerned was a very<br />
lucky man indeed that he was missed because I gather that Sir Hubert went on<br />
to become a heavyweight champion and able to ta~ ke on any iiumber of masters<br />
should he so have wished.<br />
He had, of course, a very distinguished and interesting career<br />
in the field during the Boer War, and you have indicated to me that there were<br />
some most interesting letters here letters from the field written at that time.<br />
Hie also took over the running of Papua, the bringing of Papua towards its full<br />
stature at a time of enormous challenge. So he was a man who contribued<br />
greatly to that country and we must hope and I believe by contributing to<br />
that country gave the opportunity for those further contributions which will be<br />
a contribution to Australia iin the years ahead and the relations between Australia<br />
and Papua. 2 J </p>

You mentioned, Sir, a time when he died in Samarai and<br />
when there was a mourning festival held, and I would like to quote in<br />
part from what was said at that time. This is a quote of what was said<br />
by a village councillor on this occa3ion<br />
" But who is like him in Papua? There is none. There will<br />
never be one like him. He came among us and saw our lives.<br />
Sometimes when he was younger, he hunted and fished with us.<br />
He knew us in all our ways. Sometimes when his work was done,<br />
Ihe met us on the roads as we came home from our gardens and he<br />
greeted us. Now we have lost him, for he is dead. We shall not<br />
know his friendly ways He was the best of men; our<br />
children and their children will talk of him. He promised us all<br />
' I will not leave you. I will die in Papua' His words were the words<br />
of a true man for his body lies in our ground.<br />
Now the record of the work he did lies in the National<br />
Library of Australia. With that history and with that feeling among the<br />
people for what he did when he was alive, may I renew the protestations<br />
of the gratitude we feel that these records of his work lie in the national<br />
archives for all time.<br />
Thank you, Mrs Pinney </p>
