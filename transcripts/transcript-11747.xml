    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will visit Washington and meet the President of the United States on 10 September 2001.</p>
<p>My visit will be particularly significant as it coincides with the 50th Anniversary of the ANZUS security alliance between Australia and the United States. The President and I will be reaffirming the strength and the relevance of the alliance, which underpins the very close and very broad security relationship between our two countries.</p>
<p>My discussions with President Bush and other senior Administration officials, Members of Congress and business leaders will be wide-ranging. We will be exchanging views on a range of major political and security concerns, and on ways to enhance our economic and trade relations.</p>
<p>I look forward to the visit and the opportunity it will provide to forge closer personal links with the new US Administration and Congress, and to further strengthen Australian-American ties.</p>
<p>12 June 2001</p>
