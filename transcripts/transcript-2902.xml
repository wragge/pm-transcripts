THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 1 MAY, 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ladies and gentlemen, this morning Cabinet<br />
made several appointments, or at least approved recommendations<br />
for appointments to the Executive Council. The Executive Council<br />
won't be meeting until Thursday probably and so I can't announce<br />
them yet. My Press Office is releasing two statements this afternoon.<br />
The first announces that the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh,<br />
at the invitation of the Australian and New Zealand Governments,<br />
will visit New Zealand and Australia in the first quarter next<br />
year. The second is announcing the discontinuance of bonding of<br />
staff in the Commonwealth Public Service.<br />
Cabinet today decided to refer the Meat Board Report on<br />
meat prices to the Joint Committee on Prices. That's the<br />
Parliamentary Committee which will operate once the opposition<br />
parties have chosen their members. Cabinet authorised Senator<br />
Wriedt to release the Report. Cabinet spent a considerable amount<br />
of time discussing v~ rious proposals concerning prices. When<br />
finalised, these will be announced at the special Premiers'<br />
Conference on Thursday next week. A preliminary draft of<br />
legislation to establish the Prices Justification Board was also<br />
considered today.<br />
Are there any questions?<br />
Q: Mr Prime Minister, was the Government serious when it asked<br />
a producer-exporter dominated Meat Board to bring a recommendation<br />
on meat stabilisation, and is it prepared to carry the question on<br />
further, such as asking its officials in the Department of Primary<br />
Industry to bring down their own scheme?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Meat Board is the only statutory body<br />
responsible for the Commonwealth. Therefore it was the only body<br />
( only official body) on whom the Australian Government could call<br />
for advice. You can see the Report as it is. Obviously the<br />
Government will also get advice from its officials on these matters.<br />
Q: Gordon Bryant has been reported several times in the last<br />
couple of weeks as saying that the Australian Government will<br />
not hand over the Torres Strait Islands to New Guinea and that<br />
there'll be an enclave arrangement adopted. Is this the firm<br />
policy of the Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will not answer questions based on summaries<br />
of what other people have said whether they are my colleagues<br />
or not. As I've said very many times to you and also in other<br />
public places the border between Australia and Papua can at the<br />
moment be determined by the two Governments if the Queensland<br />
Government will co-operate. The Queensland Government shows no<br />
signs of co-operating. In fact all the actions it takes seem<br />
designed to inflame the issue. When Papua New Guinea is </p>
<p>independent the matter will fall for determination through<br />
international channels such as the International Court of<br />
Justice where only the Australian and Papua New Guinea<br />
Governments will have the right to be heard.<br />
Q: Sir, on that subject I asked you several months ago<br />
actually at your first press conference whether something<br />
could be done about whaft's called the Offshore Legislation<br />
in time for the conference on the Law of the Sea, and I now<br />
ask you again when you think the Commonwealth is likely to<br />
put up its own legislation so that the test case can be made<br />
so that some of this stuff can go to International Courts?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The legislation was approved by the Legislation<br />
Committee of Cabinet this morning. I expect it will be introduced<br />
this week or next week. I'm not so optimistic that we can in<br />
this Session introduce the companion legislation about<br />
fisheries, but the basic legislation incorporating the<br />
Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill which was brought<br />
in on behalf of Mr McMahon three years ago this month I think<br />
that will be brought in this week or next.<br />
Q: Does it go much beyond the Bill which was brought in by<br />
the previous Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: it includes mineral legislation too, other than<br />
oil, which is the subject of existing legislation.<br />
Q: Sir, you aim to put that through this Session?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
Q: on the question of the executions, Sir, are you contemplating<br />
any action against Mr Bijedic for not contacting you or the<br />
Department of Foreign Affairs over the matter of executions and if not,<br />
why not?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This was, as I said in the Parliament, both<br />
the Attorney and the Ambassador assumed that the other would<br />
tell the Foreign Affairs Department. Now I'm certainly not<br />
contemplating any action against either. This was a misunderstanding.<br />
Of course the proper procedure should be for the Ambassador to<br />
approach the Foreign Affairs Department. I notice in some of<br />
the papers while I've been away that there was the allegation<br />
that I'd been too busy to see the Ambassador or had declined to<br />
see him. There is no truth in tlis whatever. Nobody from the<br />
Embassy asked the Department or my office to see me, and we<br />
checked with the Embassy and they agree that there was no approach<br />
to see me or the Department at any time.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, why then did they go and see the Attorney-<br />
General? Do you have an explanation for that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I can only assume that since they didn't<br />
approach me and I was away that weekend and Senator Willesee<br />
was abroad with ECAFE that they approach the third Minister<br />
who had been involved in all the discussions when the Yugoslav<br />
Prime Minister was in Australia. </p>
<p>0: Sir, are you perfectly satisfied with Senator Murphy's<br />
handling of the whole situation regarding the Yugoslavs,<br />
beginning with the ASIO raids and concluding with the fact<br />
that he did not inform you of the executions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You've already heard me and I've got nothing<br />
further to say about the ASIO. About the other, Senator Murphy<br />
should have told me or should have told the Department it<br />
doesn't have to be me. But as I said in the House, these are<br />
all side issues. They don't affect any major issue between<br />
Australia and Yugoslavia or within Australia. It was quite<br />
irrelevant.<br />
Q: Mr Whitlam, having spoken to Senator Murphy last night<br />
do you accept that the information was given to him unofficially?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No information between an Ambassador and a<br />
Minister and a Minister's Office can be unofficial.<br />
Q: Sir, are you confident that this will not occur again?<br />
Have you taken steps to ensure it will not occur again?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm certain that their Ambassador and other<br />
Ambassadors and the Attorney and other Ministers will see that<br />
the information which they wish to exchange comes to the<br />
notice of the Department of Foreign Affairs.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, was this issue discussed in Cabinet this<br />
morning? If so, what was the tenor of that discussion and can<br />
and can you tell us what was said when Senator Murphy dropped<br />
round to your Office yesterday to welcome you home?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will say nothing of what happened on either<br />
occasion. You know I wouldn't.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, you mentioned that these were side issues<br />
which did not affect our relations with Yugoslavia. A number of<br />
people however are concerned that the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia<br />
visited and had discussions with you only three days after the<br />
executions. Does that not affect our relations with Yugoslavia?<br />
Will you make a further protest that he didn't inform you then?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I will not make a further protest on this.<br />
I was asked in the House about this matter and I pointed out as<br />
evexybody knows that the Yugoslavian Prime Minister had left<br />
Yugoslavia some days before the executions took place. As a<br />
result of the discussions that Senator Willesee, Senator Murphy<br />
and I had with the Yugoslavian Prime Minister we have now got<br />
information which we hadn't got before. The incursion into<br />
Yugoslavia took place in June or July last year and no information<br />
could be elicited before in fact they came here. As a result of,<br />
the discussions that took place when they did come here we now<br />
have all the information which has come out.<br />
Q: Wouldn't you agree, Sir, that he was less than frank however<br />
in not telling you that these men were about to be executed<br />
when he left Yugoslavia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think he could have said that they'd been<br />
convicted yes. </p>
<p>Q: Sir, will you consider any form of compensation to the<br />
families of the executed men?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This hasn't arisen.<br />
Q: Will it arise?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Wait till it is raised.<br />
Q: It was raised in the Senate this afternoon, Sir.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It hasn't been considered by the Government.<br />
One can't assume one just doesn't know but one can't assume<br />
that the convictions were wrongly based. What we object to is<br />
the fact that people whom we claim to be Australian citizens<br />
were not put in touch with Australia's representatives in<br />
Yugoslavia. That's what we complain about, and it's what my<br />
Government has complained about all along, and now at last the<br />
issue is being discussed between our Ambassador in Belgrade and<br />
the Yugoslavian Ministers there following on the discussions which<br />
took place between the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia and the<br />
Assistant Foreign Minister when they were in Australia.<br />
Q: Sir, as these trials which culminated in the executions<br />
were in secret and we have a number of citizens of Yugoslav<br />
extraction, would you approach the Yugoslav Government to ask<br />
at least that diplomatic representatives be present at these<br />
secret trials, that which we protested in countries other than<br />
Yugoslavia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know w1&amp; ther they were secret trials.<br />
They were certainly not publicised. I don't know who could<br />
attend the trials. None of us know that. It's something we're<br />
trying to find out. But of course we are trying to ensure that<br />
whenever any persons whom we acknowledge to be Australian<br />
citizens are arrested in Yugoslavia then our representatives will<br />
be informed. As I said in the House this question of dual<br />
nationality with the dominant nationality being that of the<br />
country where people are residing at the moment this is not<br />
just a matter which concerns Australia and Yugoslavia. It also<br />
concerns Australia and Italy, Australia and Greece, Australia<br />
and the United States. Those other three countries as well as<br />
Yugoslavia have always taken the attitude that if a person whom<br />
they regard as one of their citizens and whom we regard as one<br />
of our citizens visits one of those countries then he can be<br />
called up if he is in the proper age group for military service.<br />
Now this is not nearly as serious a matter as a trial and an<br />
execution. This is just the latest, the gravest manifestation<br />
of this problem of dual nationality. It affects a great number<br />
of our naturalised citizens. Now it might help if I were to say<br />
at this stage that there is provision under Yugoslavian law<br />
for Yugoslav citizens to renounce Yugoslav citizenship.<br />
There is provision for that and any Australians of Yugoslav<br />
origin who want to renounce their Yugoslav citizenship should<br />
take steps to do so. The Yugoslav Government takes the attitude<br />
and so too do other Governments which adhere to this principle of<br />
dual nationality, that it is not sufficient for the person and<br />
the Government of the country of his adoption to agree that he<br />
should renounce his original citizenship. That must also be<br />
terminated by agreement between the person and his country of </p>
<p>original citizenship. People should take these steps, and<br />
it is available under Yugoslav law.<br />
Q: Do you think Sir that the renunciation has to take place<br />
on Yugoslav territory or can it be done<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think so. I think it can be done<br />
through the Yugoslav Consulates and Embassy in Australia but<br />
this is something where if anybody in Australia is concerned<br />
he should seek the advice of the Department of Immigration.<br />
Mr Grassby has been very actively considering this matter.<br />
Q: Have you seen or spoken to the Yugoslav Ambassador since<br />
your return?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q: Well through what means do we know that Mr Bijedic thought<br />
that Senator Murphy had told the Foreign Affairs Department?<br />
Has he spoken to Foreign Affairs since then, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know the exact details of what<br />
communications there have been. I've been away as you know<br />
for a fortnight. I saw Mr Bijedic at his request on the 16th.<br />
I left that night.<br />
Q: Sir, do you know whether any other people in similar<br />
circumstances are being held in Yugoslavia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well we are trying to find out.<br />
Q: You don't know?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, if we knew, we would tell the people<br />
concerned the relatives and if they wished we would<br />
announce it publicly. But we don't know. We are trying to find out.<br />
Q: Sir, it's more than a fortnight since you sent off your<br />
protest to Yugoslavia. You still haven't had a reply I think?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, on the contrary, we have had some<br />
information and further action is being taken. For instance,<br />
as a result of the protest which I think went on Friday 13th<br />
and as a result of the interview with Mr Bijedic on Monday 16th<br />
I have got the information which was given to you yesterday and<br />
which I read in the House today, namely the date of the<br />
executions. I wanted to know that of course because there are<br />
Australians who will want to have that information for legal<br />
purposes quite apart from the point of view of setting their<br />
minds at rest and that information has been secured, and I<br />
announced it in the House in full and some of it was given to<br />
you yesterday.<br />
Q: It wasn't a formal reply to your protest note though?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There's no written reply yet but this<br />
information has come as a result of my discussion with Mr Bijedic<br />
on Monday 16th.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, there are reports from Paris today that </p>
<p>the French Government is about to resume its nuclear tests at<br />
Mururoa Atoll. There are also reports that the scheduled<br />
number of tests will be reduced. Do you as Prime Minister have<br />
any information on this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. The French Government refuses to give<br />
any information to anybody on this subject. Senator Murphy<br />
could give it to you more predisely because he received it<br />
orally. The French Foreign Minister said personally he gave<br />
his assurance that the tests would not take place during the<br />
scientific discussions which are to take place between French and<br />
Australian scientists in Australia next Monday and the following<br />
few days.<br />
Q: Sir, how will you decide whether those talks have broken<br />
down and therefore you intend to go to the International Court?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We'd come to this conclusion in a very few<br />
days I would expect.<br />
Q: A few days?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
Q: Mr Whitlam, Mr Barnard announced yesterday that the Supply<br />
would go with New Zealand as a last resort<br />
PRIME MINISTER:. Yes.<br />
Q: did you endorse the statement and how close will the<br />
Supply go to the test zone if it does go?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I discussed this matter with Mr Barnard when<br />
he was in New Zealand yesterday. I don't know how far. This<br />
is a matter for discussion between New Zealand and the<br />
Australian navies.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, when do you plan to table the Report by<br />
the three Australian scientists who went to the French test site?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not sure.<br />
Q: why you haven't up till now?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: All these matters bear upon the court case.<br />
Q: Sir, has Cabinet or any of its Committees yet considered<br />
the detailed proposals for new Trade Practices legislation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I hope we'll do it next week.<br />
Q: I think in your absence Sir, Ampol entered into a contract<br />
with XL to refine oil and as a result of that XL has<br />
substantially cut prices in Melbourne garages. The Victorian<br />
Automotive Chamber of Commerce, I think is the correct title,<br />
claims that you were somewhat taken aback by this cut-price war<br />
and have proposed a full-scale investigation. Are these facts?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I've made no such proposal. I wasn't aware of<br />
the general situation. I haven't had the opportunity to be<br />
taken aback. </p>
<p>My emotions are described, in various terms while I'm away.<br />
I see I'm angry, I'm furious. I hadn't heard that I was so<br />
moderately affected as to be taken aback.<br />
Q: You're not upset at the cut-price war then?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Not in the least.<br />
Q: Sir, would you like to correct the descriptions of your<br />
state of mind while you were away about the Murphy incident?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: As you know I don't bother to confirm or<br />
deny any of these emotions which are attributed to me.<br />
I don't engage in long-distance controversy.<br />
Q: Did you think it was an anti-climax in the House today<br />
the Murphy uproar?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, completely.<br />
Q: Sir, on that-subject...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I know it's too unsporting of me to disclose what<br />
our predecessors have said in writing to each other. I'm<br />
supposed to keep that from you as they kept it from the public<br />
insofar as they could.<br />
Q: Do you believe that should be made public.., this<br />
correspondence<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think it's a reasonable reposte for those<br />
people that try to insinuate there are differences about us.<br />
The fact is that Mr Grassby, Senator Murphy and I are trying<br />
to do something about it and we have done something. We want<br />
to do more, but we are completely in agreement on wanting to<br />
secure the rights of people who accept Australian citizenship<br />
or who are given Australian citizenship. Secondly, we are<br />
completely at one in wanting to stamp out political terrorism.<br />
Q: Sir, I think you said in the House today that you found out<br />
on Saturday April 14 that Senator Murphy had advance knowledge<br />
of the announcement about the executions. It has also been<br />
reported that you talked to Senator Murphy not long before he<br />
left Australia about 7 o'clock on that day. The implication is<br />
that you knew about this before he left. Could you say if<br />
that's so, and if so did you raise it with him on the phone<br />
and if not, why not?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I didn't know before he left. I didn't raise it,<br />
therefore with him before he left. I spoke to him on the phone<br />
about his mission to Paris about the French nuclear tests.<br />
Q: I got the impression you might have made a mistake when<br />
you said the 14th.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It might have been Sunday the 15th. I don't<br />
remember this. It was sometime at that weekend and I learnt<br />
as I said from a cable from Belgrade our Ambassador in Belgrade<br />
and I looked in my diary to see what day it was. I can't be<br />
sure what day it was, but it was on that weekend. I think it's </p>
<p>more likely that it's the Saturday, because I notice I was<br />
rather freer in my engagements on Saturday than I was on Sunday.<br />
Q: I thought you'd only learned when you say the Ambassador<br />
on the Monday?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I might have learned of it on the Sunday.<br />
I think it was the Saturday.<br />
Q: Will Australian sailors on H. M. A. S. Supply be in any danger<br />
when they go into the French nuclear test zone?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I hope not. They'll be volunteers so they<br />
would be accepting such risks as there might be but I don't know.<br />
Q: When you say they'll be volunteers, they will be asked to<br />
volunteer for the trip or what?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Any persons going into any danger zone will<br />
do so as volunteers. There will be no compulsion on any R. A. N.<br />
personnel. There will be no orders given to R. A. N. personnel<br />
to go into this zone.<br />
Q: But there will be R. A. N. personnel...?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, but I don't know if they'll be in the zone<br />
because the French have not said where the tests will be.<br />
Their practice hitherto has been I think to issue orders for<br />
aircraft and shipping a couple of days beforehand.<br />
Q: Would we break those orders. I mean would we sail within<br />
the zone?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Every nation shares the high seas and no<br />
nation has the right to close them to any other nation. </p>
