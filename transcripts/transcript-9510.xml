SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTERl THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
BUSINESS SPEECH AT KASTEEL DE WITTENBURO<br />
THE HAGUE -MONDAY, 13 MARCH 1995<br />
It is a groat pleasure to speak to you today here In The<br />
Hague. Au3tralia has very old links with the Netherlands. They<br />
go back more than 350 years but it has to be said that<br />
your countrymen in those days refused to see the<br />
potential of the place.<br />
In two years' time it will be the 300th an~ niv~. ersary of<br />
the landing on the West Australian coast by the Dutch<br />
explorer Willem de Vlamingh. Next month Her Majesty<br />
Queen Beatrix will be launching a replica of Lhe Batavia,<br />
the Dutch ship which was wrecked off the coast of Western<br />
Australia in 1629.<br />
In between those two events the most famous of Dutch<br />
explorers in Australia, Abel Tasman, visited our southern<br />
shores and discovered what is now known as Tasmania.<br />
Tas-rian's impression unfortunately was not a favourable<br />
one: he is reported to have said as he sailed away,<br />
" There Is no good to be done here." And he went on to<br />
trade with Japan,<br />
One of the reasons for my coming to the Netherlands today<br />
is to tellI you that Tasman was wrong there is much<br />
good to bo done in Australia.<br />
Tasman of course was exploring out of Indonesia. So a<br />
nice circle has been turned. Australia's relationship<br />
with Indonesia these days Is deep and full of commercial<br />
promi se.<br />
We recognise that the Netherlands itself has very old<br />
connections with Asia; but these days Australia's active<br />
engagement with the burgeoning economies of the region<br />
can provide a perfect environment for European businesses<br />
wanting a base in the fastest growing markets of the<br />
world. Of course, our links with your country are already well<br />
established. They are more than simply commercial. In<br />
the year3 after World War II Australia welcomed thousands </p>
<p>of Dutch migrants, and they have made a great<br />
contribution to modern Australian society. We feel at<br />
home among the Dutch and I hope you won't mind me<br />
saying, very much at home in the Netherlands.<br />
We share a set of social and political values. In<br />
politics we incline towards the liberal, egalitarian,<br />
social democratic model. There is plenty of room for<br />
differences within that broad philosophical canvas, of<br />
course; but I think it is true to say that we share the<br />
same notion of what constitutes a good society. And I<br />
think that, in our own ways, we have both gone closer<br />
than most to creating one.<br />
So we have a lot in common including business.<br />
We have been doing business in fact for years, and very<br />
successful business.<br />
The Netherlands is the sixth largest investor in<br />
Austral ia and, amrong the countries * of the EU, the second<br />
1largest. The great Dutch companies like Shell, Unilever and<br />
Philips have been established for a very long time in<br />
Australia. These days companies like Rodamco, Flexovit,<br />
ABN AMRO, and the ING Group are among the 70 other Dutch~<br />
companies who are active.<br />
And increasingly Australian companies are setting up<br />
their European operations in the Netherlands. The<br />
transport firm, TNT, has its headquarters he~ re. Another<br />
Australian company, Mayne Nickless, I understand is about<br />
to become a logistics supplier in the Netherlands for<br />
Unilever.<br />
Goodman Fielder Wattie is another Australian company<br />
operating here in fact it has become the largest flour<br />
miller In Europe and the largast bread maker in the<br />
Netherlands. The Australian company Boral, which has<br />
recently made a $ 100 million investment in Germany, is<br />
also a substantial investor in the Netherlands.<br />
The point I want to make today is that these examples of<br />
the substantial two-way investment which already exists<br />
between us can be multiplied many times over. If we<br />
seize the opportunities which now exist, in time in a<br />
very short time I am sure we will be able to say that<br />
this was just the beginning.<br />
For on the eve of the 21st century Australia is uniquely<br />
placed as a country in which and with which to do<br />
busi ness.<br />
We have made great changes in the past decade. I am<br />
talking about a new Australia: with an economy which<br />
grew at more than 6 per cent last year and is expected to<br />
grow at 5 per cent this year; with employment growing at </p>
<p>3. S per cent; investment forecast to grow at 24 per cent;<br />
and with an underlying inflation rate at just over 2 per<br />
cent. We are a pro-growth Government, and my visit to Europe<br />
has more than ever convinced me that we are right to be<br />
so. We are right to aim for high growth, in a low<br />
inflation environment. We were also right, I believe, to<br />
pull down the tariff walls which for so long constrained<br />
our industries.<br />
Australia is now open to the world and competing in it<br />
successfully. in the past decade our exports of goods<br />
and services have grown from about 14 per cent to nearly<br />
22 per cent of GDP. Our international competitiveness<br />
has increased by around 38 per cent since the early<br />
1980S.<br />
These figures also speak of a cultural change. We are<br />
talkirig about a country which has been prepared to make<br />
the changes necessary to engage successfully in the<br />
global economy.<br />
We know about change in Australia. We have developed<br />
something like a culture of change. As never before In<br />
our history we are conscious that our future is in our<br />
own hands, and we are extremely confident of our ability<br />
to succeed.<br />
I can tell you this Australia in the first decades of<br />
the next century will be very strong.<br />
We will still be a competitive and reliable producer of<br />
minerals and energy, and of the products from our great<br />
pastoral and zgricultural industries,<br />
But we will be much more than this. We are much more<br />
than this already. Let me give you a couple of examples<br />
which in a sense tell the story.<br />
Australian exports of elaborately transformed<br />
mariufbctures have nearly tripled in the past decade and<br />
tourism exports have doubled as a share of GDP. In<br />
1993/ 94 Australian exports of computers and office<br />
equipment increased by around 30 per cent. Our exports<br />
of telecommunications equipment increased by 34 per cent,<br />
We find that it sometimes comes as a surprise to European<br />
audiences that Australia is in the forefront of<br />
information technology and communications.<br />
I was at the CeBIT Trade Fair in Hanover last week.<br />
Australia is the partner country this year. There are<br />
170 Australian companies represented none of them,<br />
perhaps, quite so famous as Philips, or Eriecson, or<br />
Siemens, but every one of them a measure of Australia's<br />
expertise in information technology and communications.<br />
Collectively, they are helping the European perception of<br />
I </p>
<p>Australia to catch up with the contemporary reality of<br />
Australia. It is true to say that Australia is not seen in the world<br />
as an outstandingly high technology country. But in fact<br />
it is. Australians enjoy one of the most advanced<br />
telecommunications networks in tho world. What is more,<br />
they export their expertise.<br />
Telephone networks in Germany and other European<br />
countries rely on switching systems developed in<br />
Australia. Australians have developed high-tech<br />
solutions in fields like geographic information systems<br />
and satellite navigation. They have developed the<br />
world's most advanced traffic monitoring and control<br />
systems; and built pcwerful, flexible world class<br />
software applications for banking, transport and retail<br />
industries,<br />
AUStralian software runs air and ground traffic control<br />
at Schiphol Airport. The " smart cards" and PIN pads used<br />
in banks and sup -markets throughout the Netherlands were<br />
produced by an AL, tralian company called Intellect.<br />
I could list many more examples which w. ould illustrate<br />
this essential point about contemporary Australia: that<br />
we have taken on the information revolution with a<br />
passion. And with great success.<br />
Perhaps It has something to do with our being for so long<br />
remote from the world and, living ort a vast and sparsely<br />
populated continent, remote from each other. In such<br />
circumstances people learn the value of communi cations.<br />
Our embrace of the information revolution is certairly<br />
related to the boost we have given in recent years to<br />
research and development through such measures as tax<br />
concessions; the establishment of Co-operative research<br />
centres to link various strands of business arid industry<br />
with our scientific institutions; and to the Governmnent's<br />
encouragement of information technology and<br />
communications and the new media In a wide range of<br />
policy initiatives including last year a major<br />
statement on employment and industry, and another on<br />
cultural development.<br />
There are myriad reasons why Australia has developed its<br />
interest and expertise in information technology and<br />
telecommunications. We have a healthy independent film<br />
and television industry which increases our potential to<br />
provide content for the new media. We have a highly<br />
sophisticated system of closely targeted social services<br />
which the new media can serve; and we have people in<br />
remote communities who are entitled to the sorvices in<br />
health and education and the arts which mainstream<br />
Australia enjoys, and which the new technology can<br />
provide. </p>
<p>I said In Hanover, and I know the Dutch would understand,<br />
the new information technology switz cur tncial ambitions<br />
as wellI as our economic ones. Notwithstanding its traps<br />
and limitations, it has enormous democratic potential.<br />
And it is where the jobs of the 21st century are going to<br />
be. The outstanding reason for our enthusiastic embrace of<br />
information technology and communications is the future.<br />
The information highway is the highway to the world<br />
Australia has always needed. It eliminates the<br />
disadvantage which distance has always imposed upon us.<br />
With instant international communications our handicap is<br />
gone. Along with the new markets of the Asia-Pacific, the new<br />
information technologies are the keys to Australia's<br />
success in the 21st century.<br />
it is only natural that we should have pursued both. As<br />
I said, we are at the doorstep of the fastest growing<br />
region on earth. Indeed, we are rapidly becoming part of<br />
it; and for this reason we are uniquely placed to help<br />
Dutch business people like yourselves to pursue the<br />
extraordinary opportunities which lie there.<br />
The explosive development of the Asia-Pacific may well be<br />
the most important phenomenon of the second half of the<br />
century. Asia's development will shape the 21st<br />
Century. It will shape the world's economy, its culture,<br />
environment and security.<br />
You will be aware of the development of APEC Asia<br />
Pacific Economic Co-cperation. The member countries of<br />
APEC account for half the world's production. By the<br />
year 2000 they will account for 60 per cent of world GDP,<br />
per cent of world trade.<br />
I am sure you will all know about the historic decision<br />
which APEC leaders made in Bogor, Indonesia, last year:<br />
they agreed to achieve free and open trade and investment<br />
in the region by 2010 for industrialised countries and<br />
2020 for the developing countries. This is an<br />
extraordinary development, It will mean a dynamic and<br />
integrated market of two billion people.<br />
I don't think APEC's objectives and rationale are<br />
sufficiently understood in Europe. It has developed very<br />
rapidly and in quite a different way to the EU. It Is<br />
not a community in the EU sense. It has little<br />
infrastructure and few bureaucrats.<br />
But it is no less serious. One of its great strengths is<br />
that it brings together both developed and developing<br />
economies in one framework. It sets a new standard for<br />
co-operation in what is known as the North-South<br />
dialogue: it turns that dialogue into a concrete<br />
creative reality. </p>
<p>understand the sc ,' 1snism about APEC which exists in<br />
Europe. But then twelve months ago there were sceptics<br />
saying that what was achieved at Bogor wculd never be<br />
achieved; and, twelve months before that$ there were even<br />
more sceptics saying that we would never get the leaders<br />
of Japan, the United States, China and the other 12<br />
together for a meeting in Soattle.<br />
Scepticism is a healthy sentiment of course, but APEC has<br />
defied it and I expect the pattern to continue when the<br />
Heads of Government meet again in Osak~ a in November this<br />
year I expect that we will agree on a comprehensive<br />
agenda for reaching our free trade and investment goals.<br />
The comnmitment we have made is not like any other trade<br />
negotiation. We have set the end point for<br />
liberalisation -comprehensive free and open trade in<br />
goods, services and capital. So, unlike the Uruguay<br />
Round, we will not be haggling about the Sxqn to which<br />
we remove trade barriers.<br />
We are not about to form an inward-looking or<br />
protectionist trade bloc. All APEC leaders agree that<br />
the trade and investment liberalisation we are<br />
undertaking should feed into and fuel further global<br />
trade liberalisation. What we want is a more open and<br />
liberal multilateral trading system.<br />
I think it goes without saying that Australia would like<br />
to see non-APEC countries come to the same view and match<br />
our efforts.<br />
Australia's fut~ ure is in the Asia-Pacific. That is<br />
unde~ rstood these days by all Australians, 6S per cent of<br />
our exports now go to east Asia, and about half of our<br />
mi grants now come from the region. In the process of our<br />
integration we have learned a good deal, and that is one<br />
of the reasons why Australia is a good place for European<br />
companies to establish their headquarters in Australia.<br />
They will find that Australians are comfortable doing<br />
business in Asia.<br />
They will also find a great many other advantages,<br />
including a standard of living and quality of life<br />
comparable to their own. Becaulse We share a long<br />
tradition and a common cultural heritage, they will find<br />
that they are working within a very fami liar frame~ work.<br />
They will find commercial advantages, such as a highly<br />
competitive corporate tax rate, generous research and<br />
development concessions and, perhaps most valuable of<br />
all, that sophisticated telecommunications system and<br />
highly developed information technology which I have<br />
already described to you.<br />
It seems to us that a circle really has been completed.<br />
Australia has spent the best part of 200 years on the </p>
<p>7<br />
outer reaches of Europe's influence. We are no longer in<br />
that rbit. We look to Asia and the Pacific. And it is<br />
precisely that shift In our priorities which now makes<br />
the potential for a productive and mutually beneficial<br />
relationship with European countries so much the greater.<br />
In other words, nothing In our European past comes close<br />
to matching the potential which now exists to do business<br />
with Europe in our Asia-Pacific future.<br />
And In that future, it goes without saying, we see the<br />
Netherlands as a most important partner. </p>
