The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) today agreed to a streamlined forward agenda that will ensure the effective implementation of national reforms.</p>
<p>These reforms focus on issues of national strategic importance, shaped by five themes: </p>
<p> * 	a long-term strategy for participation;<br />
 * 	a national economy driven by our competitive advantages;<br />
 * 	a sustainable and liveable Australia;<br />
 * 	better health services and a more sustainable health system for Australians; and<br />
 * 	closing the gap on Indigenous disadvantage</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said today's agreement builds on the strong history of reform achieved through cooperative federalism.</p>
<p>COAG acknowledged that success will require strong buy-in from leaders of government at all levels with a greater focus on implementation and delivery.</p>
<p>To achieve this, the Commonwealth and the States and Territories have committed to prioritising the passage of legislation to give effect to agreements reached by COAG.</p>
<p>New COAG Ministerial Councils</p>
<p>COAG will reform its system of Ministerial Councils so that emerging national issues can be addressed promptly without jeopardising COAG's longer-term agenda.</p>
<p>Under the new system, enduring issues of national significance will be addressed through councils with a long life (Standing Councils), while critical and complex issues will be addressed through councils with a limited life (Select Councils).</p>
<p>The Standing and Select Councils will assist COAG in developing a sustained and collaborative reform agenda for long-standing challenges while providing the flexibility needed to address urgent challenges as they arise.</p>
<p>The new arrangements will put a greater emphasis on implementation in a tighter relationship between COAG and its Councils.  There will also be an increased focus on performance and delivery.</p>
<p>Long-term Standing Councils will be established in the areas of:</p>
<p> * 	health;<br />
 * 	community, housing and disability services;<br />
 * 	school education and early childhood;<br />
 * 	tertiary education, skills and employment;<br />
 * 	transport and infrastructure;<br />
 * 	police and emergency management;<br />
 * 	law and justice;<br />
 * 	federal financial relations;<br />
 * 	energy and resources;<br />
 * 	environment and water;<br />
 * 	primary industries and<br />
 * 	regional Australia</p>
<p>Shorter-term Select Councils will be established to cover:</p>
<p> * 	homelessness;<br />
 * 	workplace relations;<br />
 * 	climate change;<br />
 * 	immigration and settlement;<br />
 * 	women's issues; and<br />
 * 	gambling reform (which has been previously established and will continue)</p>
<p>These new councils clearly outline the priorities for COAG in the 21st century and the format for addressing them.</p>
<p>Separate ongoing bodies known as Ministerial Legislative and Governance Fora will manage ongoing legislative and governance functions where they are outside the scope of Standing Councils.</p>
<p>Building a Seamless National Economy</p>
<p>COAG today welcomed the release of an independent report by the COAG Reform Council (CRC) on the progress of the National Partnership Agreement to deliver a Seamless National Economy.</p>
<p>The report found that good progress has been made in 21 of 27 deregulation priorities and six of eight competition reforms, with seven regulatory reforms and one competition reform completed. </p>
<p>Since the report was finalised, a further six regulatory reforms have been completed or reached the implementation stage. </p>
<p>Recognising the good progress being made in implementing the Seamless National Economy reforms, COAG agreed to bring forward its final completion date from June 2013 to December 2012. </p>
<p>Given the high priority all governments attach to boosting productivity and the competitiveness of the economy, COAG has asked for options to be developed for a further wave of regulatory and competition reforms. </p>
<p>COAG must continue to drive national competition and regulatory reform to improve Australia's economic productivity through a clear, prioritised agenda of reforms. </p>
