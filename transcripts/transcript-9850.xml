STATEMENT BY THE PREWE MINSTER, THE HON IP J KEATING9 NT<br />
AFEC BIJSINSS TRAVEL CARD<br />
Australia will introduce an APEC business travel card to facilitate entry into Australia by<br />
accredited business people from APEC economies.<br />
This follows the recommendations of the Pacific Business Forum for easier access for<br />
business travellers.<br />
Australia is developing the following arrangements to make short-term business travel<br />
easier a system of accreditation for business travellers run in partnership between the<br />
business conmmities and participating member economies<br />
a business travel card rather than a visa as a means of identifying business travellers<br />
and facilitating entry.<br />
Over 200,000 business people visited Australia last year and this number is rising rapidly<br />
each year. Australia is commnitted to streamlining and accelerating its visa and entry<br />
arrangements and the application of advanced technology to this task.<br />
Australia is proposing the establishment of a working group with all those APEC<br />
economies interested in jointly developing such a system. Not every APEC memnber might<br />
be able to join such an arrangement immediately, but all would be welcome when ready.<br />
Australia also endorses the recommendations of the PBF on business temporary residence.<br />
We are already simplifying our entry rules and streamlining processing for longer term<br />
temporary residence, as recently recommended by the Roach Committee and accepted by<br />
the Governent.<br />
Greater ease of travel will help APEC meet its aims of stimulating trade and investment in<br />
the region. Beyond the greater ease of travel for our business people an APEC business<br />
travel card would be a symbol of APEC's potential to build bridges in our region.<br />
