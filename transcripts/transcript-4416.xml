FOR PRESS 6th June, 19'/ 7.<br />
The next scheduled meeting of the Federal Cabinet<br />
will take place in Brisbane on Tuesday 14th June 1977.<br />
It is understood that the only previous occasion<br />
when there has been such a meeting in Brisbane was a meeting<br />
of the Ministry in Ju. 1957 at a time when Sir Arthur Fadden<br />
was Acting Prime Minister.<br />
Premiers and other State Ministers meet in Canberra<br />
relatively often. The Cabinet's business on 14th June is<br />
not particularly related to Queensland it will be the<br />
routine weekly meeting but it will give Federal Ministers<br />
an opportunity to meet Queensland Ministers in their own<br />
State and to further develop the associations between them. </p>
