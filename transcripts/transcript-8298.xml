PRIME MINI lp L61<br />
FOR MEDIA 22 MAY 1991<br />
I was deeply shocked and saddened to hear the tragic news of<br />
Rajiv Gandhi's assassination. Rajiv Gandhi had already<br />
given much to his country as Prime Minister and as an<br />
opposition leader. But his murder is particularly sad and<br />
wasteful because of his youth, and the continuing.<br />
contribution which he was in a position to make to India and<br />
to the wider world.<br />
I worked closely with Rajiv, particularly in the<br />
Commonwealth, where I valued greatly his insights and<br />
cooperation on issues such as South Africa.<br />
Australians have particular reason to remember his<br />
commitment to our bilateral relationship, of which he spoke<br />
again only w~ eeks before his death. That commitment was<br />
demonstrated during his visit to Australia in 1986 and in<br />
the warm reception we received when Hazel and I visited<br />
India in 1989.<br />
Rajiv and his wife, Sonia, were close personal friends.<br />
Hazel and I feel particularly the dreadful loss that his<br />
wife and family are suffering.<br />
My thoughts and best wishes go to those who must now guide<br />
India through this crisis. India's remarkable democracy has<br />
endured many challenges in the past. I am confident that<br />
the people of India and their leaders will again demonstrate<br />
their capacity to overcome the forces that are confronting<br />
India's democracy and unity.<br />
I have sent a message of condolence to Prime Minister<br />
Chandra Shekhar, and Hazel and I have passed our personal<br />
sympathy to Sonia Gandhi and her family.<br />
The Government will be represented at the funeral by the<br />
Foreign Minister, Senator Evans, and Hazel.<br />
A copy of my message to Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar is<br />
attached. </p>
<p>MESSAGE TO INDIAN PRIME MINISTER, MR CHANDRA SHEKHAR<br />
I was appalled to learn this morning of the assassination of<br />
Mr Rajiv Gandhi. At this moment of tragedy, on behalf of<br />
the Australian Government and people, I would like to convey<br />
to you and your fellow countrymen and women our heartfelt<br />
sorrow. Rajiv Gandhi had to assume great responsibilities<br />
unexpectedly and in difficult circumstances. He rose to the<br />
challenge and made his own outstanding contribution to<br />
Indian public life.<br />
I came to know him personally as a friend, and respected and<br />
valued him as a constructive colleague in Commonwealth<br />
forums. The vitality of India's democracy has been an inspiration to<br />
us all. I am confident that the democratic system in your<br />
country will be strong enough to overcome this latest and<br />
violent provocation.<br />
Please convey my condolences to the Gandhi family, to your<br />
Government and to Rajiv's colleagues and associates. </p>
