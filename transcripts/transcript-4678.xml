EMBARGO: 1.00 p. m.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 12 APRIL 1978<br />
ADDRESS AT PARLIAMENTARY LUNCH FOR WESTERN SAMOAN<br />
HEAD OF STATE<br />
Your Highness, on behalf of the Australian people I offer our<br />
warmest welcome. We are delighted you are in Australia on the first<br />
visit by a Western Samoan Head of State. I also welcome<br />
your Minister for Finance, The Hon. Vaovasamanaia Filipo and<br />
officials. In recent years there has been a notable strengthening of relations<br />
between Western Samoa and Australia. An Australian High Commission<br />
has been opened in your capital and an Australian Foreign<br />
Affairs officer has been seconded to the Foreign Affairs unit<br />
in the Prime Minister's Department of Western Samoa. My own<br />
contacts with your Prime Minister, Tupuola Efi, have been frequent<br />
and close.<br />
Your Highness, the South Pacific region is of high importance to<br />
Australia. We are determined to live up to our responsibilities<br />
towards the countries of the region. At the same time, South<br />
Pacific nations are taking the initiative in establishing<br />
links with countries outside the region. Western Samoa has been<br />
leading the way in the movement among the independent island<br />
countries of the region towards developing new-diplomatic and<br />
other links with other countries and with multilateral organisations.<br />
I know for example, that Western Samoa recently opened in New York<br />
a permanent mission to the United Nations, the United States and<br />
Canada. This is an initiative that Australia strongly welcomes.<br />
It highlights the need for regional cooperation to safeguard and to<br />
protect the perceptions and viewpoints of the region.<br />
Your Highness, you can be assured that the Australian Government<br />
will continue its efforts to sustain and extend its relations with<br />
the countries of the South Pacific, both bilaterally and through<br />
existing regional organisations. This function is an appropriate<br />
occasion to acknowledge the valuable and most constructive<br />
contribution that Tupuola Efi made at the recent Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government Regional Meeting in Sydney. Tupuola Efi<br />
as keynote speaker on the item " Special Problems of Small States"<br />
pointed out the constraints on economic development commonly<br />
shared by the island states of the Pacific.<br />
These include a small area and population; heavy reliance on<br />
external trade; as well as transport and communication difficulties. / 2 </p>
<p>Australia is aware of these problems. We agree that a regional<br />
approach is indispensible'in tackling them. At the same time,<br />
it is essential for, the problems of small states to attract the<br />
attention of larger'regional countries. As Tupuola EfL'i pointed<br />
out, countries in the Asian-Pacific region share many common<br />
experiences. The problems facing villages in India or Malaysia<br />
are similar in many ways to the problems facing villages in<br />
Western Samoa.<br />
The Cormmonwealth Regional Meeting focussed attention on the<br />
problems of small states and a series of productive discussions<br />
took place. Various important initiatives were announced with<br />
particular relevancte to small states. These included the<br />
secondment of a Commonwealth Secretariat officer to the South<br />
Pacific Economic Commission, a CHOGRMK Regional Consultative Group<br />
on Trade, and an Australian offer of a loan of $ 180,000 to the<br />
Pacific Forum Shipping Line, to meet its outstanding requirements<br />
for working capital.<br />
Australia's development assistance programme to Western Samoa<br />
is substantial. It was considerably raised in 1976 whpn my Governne:-<br />
increased its aid to the South Pacific fourfold. Western Samo isapoahn<br />
its development tasks in a confident spirit of self-reliance,<br />
diversifying its economic base through further development of<br />
export industries, and expansion of trade in7 order to increase<br />
foreign exchange earning and employment opportunities.<br />
Australia too is mindful of our obligations for development in the<br />
South Pacific. A review has been commissioned by our Department of<br />
Trade and Resources to examine the possibilities for increasing<br />
the two-way trade between Australia and the Pacific island<br />
countries. Another area of particular importance to Western Samoa is<br />
fisheries. Australia will continue to cooperate closely with<br />
Western Samoa and the other Pacific Forum countries in establishing<br />
a South Pacific Regional Fisheries Agency.<br />
Your Highness, we warmly welcome the recent steps towards a<br />
genuine strengthening of relations between our countries.<br />
Our relationship is based on a mutual friendship and a desire to<br />
encourage understan'fing between our nations. I hope that there! Will<br />
be an early opportuaity for a visit to Western Samoa by the<br />
Australliia roreign Miinister.<br />
May I again welcome you and your party to Australia and wish you<br />
a happy stay here. </p>
