    <content><![CDATA[<p>Sir Iain Lobban KCMG CB will join the independent panel of experts that is advising the Government on our review of Australia’s cyber security.<br />
 <br />
As the former Director of the United Kingdom’s Government Communications Headquarters, Sir Iain’s experience will be extremely valuable to the Review as we shape Australia’s strategy to better protect Australia’s networks from cyber attack.<br />
 <br />
Australia faces real and growing cyber threats.<br />
 <br />
By 2017, more than nine out of ten Australians will be routinely online and Australian businesses and consumers benefit from the opportunities that an interconnected world delivers.<br />
 <br />
However, there are also risks.<br />
 <br />
Since I announced the Government’s Cyber Security Review late last year, the Australian Cyber Security Centre has responded to 164 incidents involving government agencies and helped businesses respond to 2,981 incidents. There are many more incidents that businesses have managed themselves.<br />
 <br />
Sir Iain Lobban joins a strong group on the Government’s Expert Panel, which includes the CEO of the Business Council of Australia, Ms Jennifer Westacott; Chief Security and Trust Officer at Cisco Systems in the United States, Mr John Stewart; the Chief Information Security Officer at Telstra, Mr Mike Burgess; and the Director of the International Cyber Policy Centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Dr Tobias Feakin.<br />
 <br />
So far, the Review team has talked to over 140 large and small organisations across Australia and overseas.<br />
 <br />
Its work continues and will be strengthened with the participation of Sir Iain Lobban to the panel.<br />
 <br />
The Cyber Security Review will be completed in mid-2015.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
18 April 2015<br />
