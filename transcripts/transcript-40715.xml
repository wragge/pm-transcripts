    <subjects>Australian passport holders travelling in the United States; attack in Canada</subjects>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, good morning. You speak about preserving Australia’s multicultural character but do you think our alliance with the US is threatening our multicultural values?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>We are the most successful multicultural society in the world. Our values are very, very clear - our values of mutual respect. The harmony we’ve been able to maintain here, in a very diverse society is remarkable given the state in many parts of the world at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Is it at risk though Prime Minister?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Can I just say, though, as you know -  and I’ve just announced this when I was on Sky - we have received confirmation from the White House this morning that Australian passport holders will be able to travel to and from the United States in the normal way. They won’t be affected by the recent Executive Order of the 27th of January, regardless of whether they are dual citizens of another country or where they were born.</p>
<p>So that’s an important assurance that we’ve received from the White House this morning and that underlines the way in which my Government is working constantly with the new administration to advance and protect the national interests of Australia and the interests of Australian citizens. That's what we're doing and we're delivering.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>That conflicts with advice that individuals are receiving though from the US embassy in Melbourne. A schoolboy was yesterday was told his visa application could not be processed because he -</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, I've seen that report and of course we don't know all the facts surrounding that. But in the light of the assurance that has been given today, it may be that that case can be reconsidered. There may be other factors, but that is really an individual case.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, you're saying your lack of public commentary about the ban has nothing to do with the resettlement program?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Look, what is important for me to do, as Australian Prime Minister, is to deliver for Australians and to deliver for the Australian national interest. That's my job.</p>
<p>When I have frank advice to give to an American President, I give it privately, as good friends should, as wise Prime Ministers do when they want to ensure they are best able to protect Australians and Australians' national interest. Others can engage in commentary. My job is to stand up for Australia, Australian interests and deliver. That's what we've done today. Now I must leave you, I have a call with the Prime Minister of Canada and I will be conveying our condolences to him on the shocking attack in the mosque in Canada just over the last 24 hours.</p>
