PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
CANBERRA, 20 MAY, 1975<br />
Prime Minister: Perhaps I should express my great satisfaction at<br />
the progress that the Family Law Bill has made yesterday and today.<br />
The central parts of the Bill have received the approval of both<br />
the Senate last year and now the House of Representatives.<br />
Australia, in consequence, will have the most advanced, most<br />
enlightened matrimonial and family law in the world. The<br />
medieval concepts of guilt and fault will be removed from divorce<br />
proceedings. The sole ground for divorce will be the irretrievable<br />
breakdown of marriage, manifested by 12 months separation. An<br />
entirely new court, the Family Court of Australia, will be se~ t<br />
up to handle divorce proceedings and to administer an extensive<br />
machinery for reconciliation. The whole tragic business of<br />
divorce will be handled in an atmosphere now of dignity and
compassion, taking full account of the welfare of children and<br />
the interests and feelings of the partners. By recognising the<br />
fundamental status of marriage as a profoundly personal human<br />
relationship, a relationship requiring the full consent, the<br />
continuing consent,. of two partners, a contract founded on the<br />
free, voluntary and absolute commitment of both sides yet vulnerable<br />
to the human frailties of * either side, the Bill will give frash and<br />
meaningful stature -Lo -the institution of marriage itself.<br />
This has been an essehtially non-party measure; it was in the<br />
Senate, it was in the Senate Committee which considered it, it<br />
has been in the House of Representatives, both on the second<br />
reading and now in the Committee stages. Yet I see it as the.<br />
most progressive and extensive social reforif achieved during the<br />
-term of my* Government. I believe Australians owe a lasting debt<br />
to the architect of the Bill, the former Attorney--General,<br />
Mr. Justice Lionel Murphy. We have come a long way since the<br />
marriage and divorce laws in this country were dispersed in a<br />
confused and-generally repressive tangle among the statute books<br />
of the six different States and the different Federal Territories.<br />
And on this occasion I don't forget the role played by Mr. Justicoe<br />
Joske, by the present Chief Justice of Australia, Sir Garfield<br />
B~ arwick, when he was Attorney-General and I think abbve all now,<br />
Mr. Justice Murphy.<br />
Are there any questions?<br />
Question: Will you give an assurance now, Sir, that you will<br />
honour your election promise to abolish the means test in the life<br />
of this Parliament?<br />
Prime Minister: Yes. This Parliament has until the middle of 1977<br />
to run. And by that time I'm certain that every man and woman of<br />
or above will have the age pension without means tests.. I've<br />
given that undertaking on behalf of the party so often that I<br />
shouldn't think that anybody would now doubt it. </p>
<p>Question: It's a subject of discussion at the moment,<br />
Sir, that's why I raised it.<br />
Prime Minister: Maybe, but you asked me and I gave the answer<br />
that I would have given throughout.<br />
Question: Are you satisfied with the performance of<br />
Dr. Cass as Minister for the Environment?<br />
Prime Minister: I believe that the question of the environment<br />
will be handled more effectively and expeditiously from now on.<br />
Question: In view of your apparent acceptance that sand<br />
mining will not harm the environment at Fraser Island, can you<br />
state your attitude now to oil drilling on the Barrier Reef?<br />
Should the Queensland Government grant leases?<br />
Prime Minister: Now, you misrepresent my attitude. I'm not<br />
saying that I'm satisfied with sand mining on Fraser Island.<br />
I've never said that. What I have asserted is that it is not<br />
possible, constitutionally or legally, in my view, and the<br />
view of the Government, to make our procedures retrospective.<br />
That's what I've saidaand the companies which were given<br />
authorisation by the responsible Minister to export sand<br />
minerals from Fraser Island had been engaged in preparation<br />
for that for many years. The dates were given at question<br />
time today. And they had completely complied with the law.<br />
Now the attitude that my Government has taken throughout has<br />
been that in respect to contracts for sales overseas, it will<br />
not break those contracts, it will not force the breaking of<br />
those contracts. It will see that contracts are honoured. And<br />
we have taken that attitude throughout. We can't take a different<br />
attitude on Fraser Island to the attitude we have taken previously.<br />
You mention the question of the Barrier Reef and oil drilling<br />
there. The legal position is different there. There has not<br />
been drilling there in recent years, it has been suspended for<br />
over four years pending the Royal Commissions issued by the<br />
Australian and the Queensland Government to Mr. Justice Wallace<br />
and his two colleagues. The Australian Government will be<br />
considering those Royal Commissions report on Friday morning.<br />
I would expect that we will adhere to the point of view which<br />
I had forecast that we will accept Mr. Justice Wallace's recommendation<br />
that in the present state of knowledge, oil drilling<br />
should not take place on the Barrier Reef. Now in our view,<br />
and it has been asserted, of course, in the Seas and Submerged<br />
Lands Act, at present under challenge in the High Court,<br />
substantially, almost precisely, the same Bill that Sir Reginald<br />
Schwartz introduced under Foreign Minister McMahon, under Prime<br />
Minister Gorton in April 1970, the sea bed there is within Federal<br />
jurisdiction. And therefore, the granting of permits of this<br />
character in the sea bed around the Great Barrier Reef is a<br />
matter of Federal jurisdiction. Similarly, of course, it's a </p>
<p>matter of Federal jurisdiction in respect of the Northern<br />
Territory, in particular in respect to uranium and bauaxite found<br />
which are principally in -the Northern Territory. Now there's<br />
a different situation as regards sand mining, coal, iron ore<br />
and so on, in the States. My Government...<br />
Question: Why wasn't export approval given for those two<br />
leases?<br />
Prime Minister: Because there was no legal grounI to refuse<br />
the export authorisation. No legal ground. The companies<br />
had for years, before my Government was elected, complied w:!-th<br />
the reautrements of the Queensland law. There has been an<br />
environmental public inquiry about three or four years ago,<br />
before we came in, under Queensland law. All the leases and<br />
all the conditions had been granted, observed under Queensland4<br />
law. In those circumstances it was not possible for us to set<br />
the law aside. The position is different on -the Barrier Reef,<br />
or at least the sea bed i~ n our view, because we believe<br />
that's Federal jurisdiction and in the Northern Territory where<br />
everybody agrees it's Fede~ ral jurisdiction.<br />
Question: What led you to believe that . the environment<br />
would be better managed i~ n the future?<br />
Prime Minister: Because I bi . ieve the delay by the Departrnent<br />
and the Minister have now been brought sufficiently to theirattention.<br />
Question: When you say that there is no legal ground to<br />
refuse exports surely that flies in the face the export powers<br />
you have which Mr. Connor has used, on other occasions, and<br />
has threatened to use, for instance, in relation to coal with<br />
Utah State onshore mining, with gas onshore from central Australia,<br />
etc. etc., and South Australia exports, the power has been plantCed<br />
on a num ber of occasions to clearly lie with the Federal<br />
Governfment. EHow can you say that there'are no legal grounds to<br />
refuse exports?<br />
Prime Minister: Well if you don't mind, I don't want to argue<br />
the constitution law in detail with you<br />
Question: Just very briefly would do<br />
Prime Minister: No well, I'll bear with you. The constitution<br />
gives the Federal Parliament the responsibility to pass laws<br />
with respect to trade and commerce with other countries. There<br />
may be some other powers which don't apply in this case, for </p>
<p>instance, the external affairs power, but there's no treaty<br />
or international convention covering Eraser Island, or<br />
defence power. But there's no aspect of defence power involved<br />
in Fraser Island. Now the whole question is do environmental<br />
factors come within trade and commerce with other countries?<br />
Quite-apart from that, there is the question of making a law<br />
retrospective. There was no Federal law, until last December,<br />
none at all, and in those circumstances, whatever the constitutional<br />
situation may be, it would be quite wrong to make<br />
a law retrospective, that is a basic tenet and any court would<br />
lean against making it, making an action or contract illegal<br />
retrospectively. Question: Does your decision mean that you'll grant<br />
export permits for the remaining leases of Dillingham Murphy<br />
Ores, and with all due respect to your legal expertise, Sir,<br />
do you think you compromise your party's environmental impact<br />
policy? Prime Minister: No, I don't think we have. We were the<br />
Government which extended the export prohibitions from iron<br />
ore and uranium, where they were under our predecessors, to<br />
coal and to bauxite and to beach sands. I mean, we did that,<br />
and we brought in the law, the Environment Protection Impact<br />
Proposal Act last December. We amended it again last week.<br />
We are bringing in, probably this week, the Great Barrier Reef<br />
Marine Park legislation. We are drafting marine environment<br />
protection legislation. We are doing this. I must emphasise<br />
that you jeopardise a very great deal if you purport to make<br />
anything which was legal, illegal retrospectively. Incidentally,<br />
export permits or authorisations and they are the same have<br />
not been sought in respect to the other leases. There will now<br />
be a public inquiry under the Federal legislation, and that ought<br />
to be concluded within the next few months, and it may be that<br />
shortcomings in the mining on Fraser Island would be revealed<br />
by that inquiry as they were not revealed by the State inquiry<br />
of 1971, and if they are, then public opinion or State pressure,<br />
or coordination, cooperation, Federal and State, might preclude<br />
any damage.<br />
Question: You mentioned the Marine Environment Bill and<br />
the Barrier Reef Bill. Those Bills I take it, are proceeding<br />
on the basis that you already have power over the offshore<br />
areas despite the fact that the High Court hasn't made a<br />
decision on the Seas and Submerged Lands Bill.<br />
Prime Minister: Yes that's right, that is so.<br />
Question: Are you worried at the suggestions that the<br />
High Court may take up to a year to make that determination?<br />
And in the meantime, how are you going to stop the States<br />
granting and renewing leases in offshore areas? </p>
<p>Prime Minister: I'm not going to speculate how long the<br />
Hfigh Court may reserve its decision in this matter. The<br />
l] egislation which is about. ' to come in -it was approved by<br />
the Legislation CommittLee this morning -is based on the<br />
assumption that successive Federal Govern~ ments have made<br />
for over five years now, that the sea bed is within Federal<br />
jurisdiction.<br />
Question: Regarding the Mayaguez affair. Do you bealieve<br />
that President Ford was justified in sending in the M'arines, or<br />
do you think -that his action was precipitate, coul d have rislked<br />
the securilty of the area, and finally have you sent any note<br />
or any message or any communication or cable to President Ford<br />
about thc mat-ter?<br />
Prime Minister:, No, I've sent rno communication, note, cable<br />
or let-ter, to use -the terms of the Melbourne ' Age', and I<br />
have no comment -to offer.<br />
Question: Have you been appraised as-yet of -the A. C. T. U.' s<br />
decision on indexation in Perth?<br />
Prime Minister: No.<br />
Question: I understand -that it was announced by Mr. Hawke<br />
about 45 minutes ago, and th~ at they support the principle of<br />
indexation. and call on all Australian trade unionists to do<br />
the same.<br />
Prime Minister: Good.<br />
Question:. Apart from good, do you have any comment?<br />
llrimne Minister: No, I'm very pleased. They've done the right<br />
-thing as the Government did.<br />
Question: In view of reported denials this morning of your<br />
allegations concerning the Vietnamese family's entering Australia,<br />
could you tell us when and how the Australian authorities were<br />
misled in regard to this incident?<br />
Prime Minister: I'll quote what I said to the Joint Parliamentary<br />
Committee on Parliamentary Committees last night<br />
" I should refer to what Senator Mulverhili says about this<br />
Austral. ian of Vietnamese origin. What happened there was<br />
-that ho misled -the authorities. He said that the Acting<br />
Prime Minister, hie said Connor, had given authority for him </p>
<p>to bring certain extended relatjves. Connor denies it, so<br />
for greater precaution I thought he might have meant Cairns<br />
Cairns denies it too. He got them in by misrepresentation."<br />
The situation is that a cable came from Guam to the Department<br />
of Labor and Immigration on 11 May from an experienced officer.<br />
" Sponsor travelled to Saigon after speaking to acting Prime<br />
Minister, Connor. Sponsor claims to have been told by Acting<br />
Prime Minister that should he succeed in getting rest of family<br />
out of Vietnam they w. ould also be approved." Mr. Connor denies<br />
that he ever spoke to him or that he ever told him anything<br />
of the nature.<br />
Question: Soon after Labor came to power a uranium mining<br />
company in Australia entered into a contract which was signed<br />
and written with a Japanese electricity firm for the supply of<br />
uranium. So far Mr. Connor has refused to honour that contract.<br />
Under what law is he refusing to do so, other than the export<br />
powers? Prime Minister: lie assured the House today that he would honour<br />
it, and it will be honoured. The uranium<br />
Question: I'm talking about a contract entered into after<br />
Labor came to power, he's only previously said that he will<br />
honour contracts entered into before Labor came to power.<br />
Prime Minister: Well the contract to which you refer will be<br />
honoured. It was approved by the Government. The uranium<br />
which the company is entitled to receive by whatever ' date<br />
it is will be received by that company. The Australian<br />
Government is in a position to ensure that that uranium will<br />
be delivered in the terms of the contract. I made it plain<br />
earlier, that in regard to the Northern Territory, the<br />
Australian Government has all the powers that any State<br />
Government has in these matters, in addition to export powers.<br />
Question: What is your attitude to the application by<br />
B. H. P. for a price rise?<br />
Prime Minister: The Australian Government is responding to the<br />
suggestion that it should provide counsel to assist the tribunal<br />
in determining this application, and I expect in the next few<br />
days to be conferring with the relevant Ministers on the general<br />
terms of the view that will be put by the Government.<br />
Question: Efforts are being made to get the trade unions<br />
to prevent any mining on Fraser Island. If they succeed what<br />
would the Government's attitude and actions be?<br />
Prime Minister: The Government has responsibilities in this<br />
matter and I don't see that unions do. </p>
<p>7.<br />
Question: Have you received any communication from the<br />
U. N. on the distribution of refugees from Guam and can you<br />
give us any idea on the numbers although you've said that<br />
this is going to be left up to the U. N. largely. Have you<br />
had any discussion about the numbers that are likely to come<br />
to Australia?<br />
Prime Minister: No, I can give no estimate of that at all..<br />
There might have been some communications with the United<br />
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the last day I<br />
haven't seen it. The UNHCR's representatives have been<br />
operating rather in Hong Kong, and have been trying to operate<br />
in Singapore rather than in Guam. One feature which has not<br />
been sufficiently emphasised is that it is quite likely that<br />
increasing numnbe:-s of refugees and they're the only categories<br />
with which the Australian Government would be concerned, and<br />
even of evacuees, might be returning to Vietnam. All the<br />
forecasts and in fact the propaganda about bloodbaths and<br />
holocausts have not materialised and there may, therefore,<br />
be a very considerable number, very considerable increase in<br />
Vietnamese returning to their own country. That of course<br />
would be the best outcome.<br />
Question: Are you satisfied with Mr. Connor's performance<br />
as Minister for Minerals and Energy?<br />
Prime Minister: In the matters we have been discussing here<br />
which is all I suppose you are asking about, of course. I<br />
think he has been a very effective and successful Minister.<br />
He has gone as far in asserting the national interest as the<br />
law allows. I know that some people choose to disparage him.<br />
There was some reference to Utah by one of the earlier questioners.<br />
Let me point out, that the previous Labor Government federally<br />
made the Joint Coal Board arrangement with New South Wales, and<br />
because of that, in New South Wales, Mr. Connor is able to assert<br />
proper environmental conditions. In Queensland there is no such<br />
arrangement and, therefore, he has to rely on persuasion alone.<br />
Mr. Connor has a longer experience and a deeper involvement in<br />
environmental matters than any of us.<br />
Question: What mechanisms exist for the Department of the<br />
Environment to be made aware of projects for the export of mining<br />
products and at what stage of the projects proposal to the<br />
Federal Government do those mechanisms come into operation?<br />
Prime Minister: I don't know the details here. You should ask<br />
the Ministers concerned. The Fraser Island one, of course,<br />
the Fraser Island chronology, I know well and I cited it at<br />
question time today. </p>
<p>Question: Suppl. ementary quest ion regarding the Viet -axese<br />
question You did say they gained entry by misreprcse-fLation<br />
or words to thatE effect, " Out what was tChe actual misrepresentation?<br />
H-ow did they get in 24 of then.?<br />
Prime Mini'ister: I have no suj-p. emn. ente,-ry answer.<br />
Question: Dur-ing your discussions with the President of<br />
the World Bank, Mr. Robert 14cNamara in Washingto,, n, was the<br />
question of thE Bank's Third Window Project raised w,. ith you?<br />
Prime Iinisterc: Yes.<br />
Question: Did 71r. McNamnara ask yvou for a contribution,<br />
dLid hie ask fort Australia to contribute towards that projecL-?<br />
And to. what extent wo7(, uld Austraiia hDeco-rite financiallyv involved?<br />
Prime Minister: He raisedl these matters with me. I pointed<br />
out, of course, that no commnityen;: could be made except in<br />
the Budget context and the Budget %, ouidn' L be announced until<br />
19 August. But I did ltell him that I would,. qu it c soon, let<br />
him have a tent~ ative response, but not as to amounts.<br />
Question: When 6o you hope to renew the aids programmRes<br />
in South VietLnamr, the civil aid p-fograiXmC?<br />
Prime Minister:. As soon as we can establish cortmunications with<br />
the Revolutionary Goverrnmert of South Vietnamn. Wie have, toflay,<br />
inStl'UcLed our Ambassador-in Hanoi-to estciblish contact with<br />
the representatives of the Revo: lutioiiary GovernmentL of South<br />
Vietnam. When we have that contact, then of cour-se, we w. ill<br />
be able to resume the quite extensive aid programmes we ha-ve<br />
in the South. We also, of course, will be able to mnake our<br />
own asses: sment about cond-itions for reconstruct'Cion, ' resettlement,<br />
repatridtLion.<br />
Question: Are you concerned that the Government's o'vertulres<br />
to the now rulers,_ the new Governmeint ini Phinom Penh, have yet<br />
to be acklicwledged?<br />
Prime MinistLer-. think we are having the same time lag as<br />
every other country is flaying in establishiLng relations with<br />
the new Governme,-nt. in Phnomn Penhi. </p>
