    <content><![CDATA[<p>53RD CONGRESS OF THE R. S. L.<br />CANBERRA, A. C. T. 28 OCTOBER 1968<br />Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />Your Excellency, Sir. Arthur Lee, Mr. Whitlam, Ministers, Members,<br />Service Chiefs of Staff, and Ladies and Gentlemen:-<br />My task is merely to say a few supporting words after<br />the Governor-General has opened this Conference. And I will keep<br />them brief, as I know you would wish them to be kept brief.<br />it is for me a great distinction to be able to stand today<br />and talk to the representatives of an organisation which has, since it<br />was formed, had three major objectives at least in my mind three<br />major objectives. The first, to see that those who were maimed by war,<br />and the dependents of thos e who were maimed or did not return at all<br />from war, were looked after by the nation. The second, to try to<br />ensure that the defences of this country were, insofar as our resources<br />permitted, kept at a level which would help us to retain what in the past<br />members of this organisation have so dearly fought to retain. And the<br />third, to see that that which was retained in two world ware is used<br />properly in peace for the benefit of the nation.<br />In neither of the great wars fought did we win anything<br />new, nor did we seek to. What we did was to retain something old and<br />something precious, the right to live in freedom and to develop ourselves<br />according to our people's will. We might not have retained that in my<br />view we would not have retained that but for the sacrifices twice made.<br />And it is therefore a most significant objective of this organisation to<br />see that the foundation upon which, and upon which alone a great nation<br />can be built, the foundation of freedom and participation in decisions....<br />to see that that foundation is used to build an enduring structure. These<br />are three great objectives.<br />As to the first two, the Governor-General has already<br />indicated the difficulties of getting a quart out of a pint pot. But, I am<br />sure, that insofar as this organisation is concerned, they will never<br />stop squeezing if I can change the metaphor and regard it as a tube of<br />toothpaste never cease squeezing the tube to endeavour to get from it<br />the utmost possible. One thing of which His Excellency spoke was the number<br />of items on your agenda. One of them will not need to take up much of<br />your time the item concerned with the extension of tuberculosis<br />benefits to those who have fought in special areas or in Vietnam. The<br />legislation was amended last week in order to extend these benefits to<br />these people. As to defence, I know that everyone present is concerned<br />with the changed situation which faces our nation as a result of the decision<br />of the British to withdraw from our near north. I know that everyone here<br />realises that meeting a changed situation and a new challenge requires<br />decisions which cannot be lightly arrived at and ought not to be too quickly<br />rushed into. And that is all I propose to say on that matter. / 2</p>
<p>-2-<br />But it may be appropriate, Sir, to conclude by announcing<br />here something which I believe has a significance for the organisation<br />and for the nation itself. This November there is an anniversary, and<br />that is the anniversary of the ending of that great war fought some half<br />a century ago. We have been asked by the French Government to<br />contribute from Australia a contingent of troops who will represent<br />this nation, together with a contingent from New Zealand. They will<br />march through the streets of the city of Paris and give visible evidence<br />of the sacrifices made by this nation for a country 10, 000 miles away....<br />but for a cause which is just as significant whether it is 10, 000 or<br />miles away. And so there will be on this 50th celebration representatives<br />of the Australian Army and the New Zealand Army providing to the<br />people of Europe an indication, a reminder of that continuing concern<br />of this nation for the maintenance of freedom, which cost so dearly at<br />that time and which will be commemorated by this march. I hope that<br />our decision to send this contingent meets with the approval of this<br />gathering and indeed I am sure it does.<br />BACKGROUND POINTS ON PARIS CONTINGENT:<br />This will comprise about 150 men representing the<br />three services. A party of 84 soldiers and airmen will leave by<br />air on 6 November. The Naval contingent of some 40 officers and<br />men will be made up of R. A. N. personnel serving in Britain.</p>
