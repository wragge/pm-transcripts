    <content><![CDATA[<p>The death of Don Chipp at the age of 81 has taken from the Australian political scene a colourful, compassionate figure.</p>
<p>He was elected to the House of Representatives in a by-election in 1960, succeeding Mr Thomas (Frank) Timson, as the Member for Higinbotham. For many years a Liberal minister, serving in the Holt, Gorton, McMahon Governments and the caretaker Fraser Government, Don Chipp will be best remembered as the founder of the Australian Democrats.</p>
<p>Don Chipp could not be readily typecast on issues except perhaps his very strong commitment to the environment. He believed that there was an important place for a third force in Australian politics. The validity or otherwise of that proposition will quite naturally be subject to continuing debate.</p>
<p>To me Don Chipp's most enduring quality was his relentless passion and commitment to issues. Until the very end he had strong beliefs and strong opinions concerning issues of public policy.</p>
<p>Don Chipp made a significant contribution to public life in Australia. I know that his many friends and colleagues in the Australian Democrats will miss him greatly.</p>
<p>To his wife Idun and Mr Chipp's six children, Debbie, John, Greg, Melissa, Juliet and Laura, I extend for myself, my wife and the Government as a whole our deepest sympathy for their great loss.</p>
<p>Don Chipp's family has accepted the Government's offer of a state funeral.</p>
