For Media<br />
COMMONWEALTH DAY<br />
Commonwealth member countries today cnmumorate this unique<br />
association of countries which vary widely in their geography<br />
and racial and cultural backgrounds.<br />
My Government sees the Commonwealth as an instrument for peace<br />
and understanding, and for the political, social and economic<br />
advancement of all its members. I have written to the<br />
Commonwealth Secretary-General, Mr Ramphal, in response to<br />
his message of congratulations to me following the election,<br />
to inform him that the Government will aim particularly to<br />
develop relationships within the Commonwealth in a manner<br />
beneficial to the less advantaged member countries.<br />
The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in New Delhi from<br />
23-30 November, will provide a most useful opportunity to pursue<br />
this objective. </p>
