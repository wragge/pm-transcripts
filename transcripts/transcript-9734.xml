PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DAME PATTIE MENZIES<br />
I was saddened to learn of the death today of Dame Pattie Menzies.<br />
Dame Pattie was a fine Australian, a model and an inspiration to her<br />
countrymen and women.<br />
During her marriage of over half a century to Sir Robert Menzies and in the<br />
years since his death, her concern for her fellow citizens, particularly women,<br />
and her charm and warm personality earned the deep affection of the<br />
Australian people.<br />
Her family has accepted the Government's offer of a State Memorial Service<br />
to be held in Canberra shortly.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government and the Australian Labor Party I<br />
extend my sympathy to her daughter, Heather Henderson, and all her family.<br />
