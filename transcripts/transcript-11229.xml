    <content><![CDATA[<p>I welcome last night's agreement between NATO and Yugoslavia</p>
<p> on the conditions for achieving peace in Kosovo.</p>
<p>The agreement provides for the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from</p>
<p> Kosovo and the deployment of an international security force. It is</p>
<p> an important step towards the eventual safe return of the hundreds</p>
<p> of thousands who have been forced to flee their homes in Kosovo and</p>
<p> take shelter elsewhere - including in Australia.</p>
<p>Clearly our strong hope is that the end to hostilities will enable</p>
<p> the early release of Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace.</p>
<p>Passage in the next few days of the United Nations Security Council</p>
<p> resolution, agreed by G8 ministers, will be essential in securing</p>
<p> a peace settlement. The government encourages all members of the Security</p>
<p> Council to move expeditiously.</p>
<p>The government hopes that the commitments made by the government of</p>
<p> Yugoslavia will be adhered to so that peace can be brought to Kosovo</p>
<p> as soon as possible.</p>
<p> 10 June 1999</p>
