TRANSCRIPT OF UNEDITED INTERVIEW WITH MARIE MILLS, RADIO<br />
6WF, 29 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
MILLS: Good morning Mr Hawke and thanks very much for<br />
your time on WF.<br />
PM: My pleasure, Marie.<br />
MILLS: Now we've collected these questions from<br />
listeners and I don't think we should go past, first of<br />
all, the results in the polls. How much notice do you<br />
take of the polls?<br />
PM: Every political leader and politician worth his salt<br />
looks at them, is interested in them, I am. I recognise<br />
that we're down at the moment but we've just come through<br />
our fourth victory and we've got a long time to go to the<br />
next one. The economy's going to be recovering, I think,<br />
strongly next year and we've now got in place a<br />
significant lowering of the inflation rate and employment<br />
will pick up next year. I think that the economic and<br />
political cycle will come together well when it matters.<br />
MILLS: Well it's not just the Labor Party who's lower.<br />
You personally have a particularly low rating at the<br />
moment. Are you going to be Prime Minister as the Labor<br />
Party moves into the next election?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
MILLS: Are you going to anoint anyone as the next in<br />
line? PM: You've heard what I've had to say about that. I<br />
don't anoint, the Caucus appoints. I don't think there's<br />
any doubt that: when I call it a day that they will<br />
appoint Paul. I've always thought that and I still think<br />
that.<br />
MILLS: Another critical issue of course for Australia at<br />
the moment, as it is for every nation in the world, is<br />
the Middle East crisis. Secondly, there still seems to<br />
be a great deal of concern amongst community members that<br />
we're just on America's coat-tails and the decision as to<br />
whether or not: there is to be a war comes closer, that<br />
seems to grow larger. </p>
<p>PM: I haven't any evidence to sustain that proposition<br />
or evidence polling that's been done shows that the<br />
clear majority of the Australian people support the<br />
position the Government's taken.<br />
MILLS: Well certainly at least one of our listeners is<br />
concerned that this is going to be another Vietnam, that<br />
it may reach the stage of conscription and if it reaches<br />
the stage of war, will it reach the stage of<br />
conscription? PM: No.<br />
MILLS: Categorically?<br />
PM: Well I think that sounded pretty categoric.<br />
MILLS: It did indeed. Let's look beyond the Middle East<br />
crisis. A number of people want to know what sort of a<br />
long term vision you have for Australia, whether it<br />
reaches past -the next election, past the next crisis for<br />
the Labor Party?<br />
PM: Well that was made quite clear before and during the<br />
last election when I spelt out the long term goals of<br />
this Government. In a sense I didn't really need to do<br />
that because I'd done it since 1983. We've made clear<br />
what those goals are, they are fairly clear. They are<br />
firstly, that we develop a more diversified, strong<br />
economy which is going to reduce Australia's exposure to<br />
wildly fluctuating prices for our commodities. Secondly,<br />
that it become, as part of the first goal it becomes the<br />
clever country which has a highly skilled workforce<br />
capable of undertaking the tasks that are necessary to<br />
achieve the more competitive economy. Thirdly, that it<br />
be a country which is increasingly enmeshed with this<br />
region, with -this dynamic region. Fourth, that it be a<br />
country which plays an important part in international<br />
affairs and we've shown that we are doing that in a<br />
number of ways. Firstly, it is Australia who's provided<br />
the basis of -the peace plan for Cambodia. Secondly, it<br />
is Australia, particularly myself, that's established the<br />
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council which is<br />
bringing together the countries of the Pacific Rim.<br />
We've taken the lead now in becoming increasingly<br />
effective in saving the Antarctic from mining. We are<br />
increasingly a nation who is taken note of in the<br />
international councils of the world for our capacity to<br />
make a relevant and constructive contribution to<br />
important issues. These are the goals. It's not the<br />
goals that we conjure up today for tomorrow. It's<br />
something thatL we've been working on consistently since<br />
we've been in Government.<br />
MILLS: When you talk about saving the Antarctic from<br />
mining, we've had a couple of listeners who have been<br />
very concerned about your commitment to the environment.<br />
Can you clarifEy that? </p>
<p>PM: Clarify what? My commitment to the environment?<br />
MILLS: Yes indeed.<br />
PM: Well how long have you got? Saved the Franklin,<br />
saved Kakadu, saved Daintree, saved Tasmania's forests,<br />
have now got a situation where the International Union<br />
for Conservation has said this; that no country has done<br />
more than Australia to advance the causes of the world<br />
environment movement. I mean how's that for starters?<br />
MILLS: Well how about not allowing Japanese ships which<br />
are heading down to catch whales into Australian ports?<br />
That's a request from one of our listeners.<br />
PM: We've taken a leading role in regard to getting an<br />
international convention in regard to whaling and our<br />
position on that is well known, well established.<br />
MILLS: Will our ports be open to those Japanese ships<br />
which need to refuel or want to refuel in our ports?<br />
PM: Not if they are operating contrary to the<br />
international convention.<br />
MILLS: Certainly one listener will be pleased to hear<br />
that. Now another question. Why do we keep our<br />
migration levels, our immigration levels at that which<br />
they are when, according to one listener, we're already<br />
full to the brim, that Australia is heading towards a<br />
situation where we're going to have more than enough<br />
people? PM: Well of course if people would listen to that sort<br />
of argument which has been going on since the end of the<br />
last war we wouldn't have a significant population. We<br />
had seven million people at the end of the war and there<br />
were people who were crying out and said no, no, no we<br />
musn't have more migrants. If we listened to that sort<br />
of argument we'd be back in the backwoods. We've got to<br />
keep the migration program, be prepared to adjust it in<br />
terms of an assessment of our economic circumstances, as<br />
indeed we have at this time. Immigration in the whole of<br />
the post war period has made Australia a very, very much<br />
stronger, richer, more diversified country than it<br />
otherwise would've been. We'll continue to do that.<br />
MILLS: Economically have we hit the bottom? Are we<br />
going to use that word?<br />
PM: I find it rather boring, this word. I mean I<br />
haven't avoided the word. I've simply said what is<br />
the truth and that is that according to the economists<br />
their technical definition of a recession is two<br />
successive quarters of negative economic growth. That<br />
hasn't occurred yet, it may occur tomorrow when the<br />
figures come out. But I haven't worried about the word. </p>
<p>If people want to use the word that's perfectly OK by me<br />
because what we have done is to slow down the economy.<br />
We deliberately did that because we couldn't sustain the<br />
level of imports that we were having in the country and<br />
we're now getting the results. Sure, there's been pain<br />
and that's unfortunate. But the thing is that we had to<br />
slow the activity down. We've now got continuing<br />
lowering imports which is necessary. Our exports are<br />
growing. Our inflation rate is coming down and our<br />
balance of payments situation is improving. Those things<br />
had to be done and the economy will certainly go into<br />
significant recovery next year.<br />
MILLS: So we've hit the bottom, we're on the turn?<br />
PM: Well you can't ever point to the exact week or month<br />
and it would obviously be wise to wait to see what the<br />
figures are for the national accounts.<br />
MILLS: A specific question now regarding seamen. We had<br />
a question from one listener asking why seamen don't<br />
receive the same sort of repatriation rights and pensions<br />
and so on that regular soldiers, regular navy personnel<br />
get? PM: You're talking about merchant seamen during the<br />
previous conflicts. They do get benefits but they<br />
haven't always got exactly the same benefits as members<br />
of the armed forces. That's the position. As it is now<br />
it's been one which has been recognised by successive<br />
governments. MILLS: It's been a very brief visit to Western<br />
Australia. I wonder if you've had time to consider our<br />
Royal Commission here, the terms of reference and perhaps<br />
whether you think Carmen Lawrence has gone down the right<br />
track, making that Royal Commission stretching back ten<br />
years? The Royal Commissioner at this stage looks like<br />
it's going to a West Australian. Is that the way she<br />
should've gone?<br />
PM: These matters are decisions for State Governments.<br />
We don't try and tell State Governments how to run their<br />
affairs. I tend to think she's made the right decision<br />
to appoint a Royal Commission. It was for her and the<br />
Government to make that decision. I guess no-one should<br />
be worried about how far it goes back.<br />
MILLS: John '. Dawkins it seems would like to tell the<br />
State Government here how to run their affairs. He's<br />
asked them to re-think the decision which means they are<br />
giving a gift of $ 7M worth of land to a Catholic<br />
university here.<br />
PM: I've had no opportunity other than to see the<br />
headlines in -the West Australian newspaper. I wouldn't<br />
be making any comment until I was more informed on this<br />
both from the Premier of Western Australia and from my </p>
<p>j1I Minister. When I've had the chance of listening to them<br />
both I will be able to perhaps say something that's<br />
useful. Until I've done that I can't.<br />
MILLS: There's been a call to bring Brian Burke back<br />
from Ireland. What do you think of that?<br />
PM: I don't think anything of it. I mean when the Royal<br />
Commission is set up, if the Royal Commission makes a<br />
decision that they want him, that's for them to decide.<br />
If they make that decision obviously he'd come back.<br />
MILLS: Mr Hawke, thanks for your time. It's good to<br />
have you on WF.<br />
PM: Thanks.<br />
ends </p>
