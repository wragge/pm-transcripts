TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, RAAF BASE FAIRBAIRN, 13 FEBRUARY<br />
1989 E 0 E -PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke will housing be one of the things<br />
you'll take on now that you are back? I<br />
' PM: Yes, well that will be one of the things we will be<br />
looking at.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Elliott, probably one of your dear<br />
friends, has suggested that there is a tax loophole by which<br />
he rents-<br />
PM: Rents his stubbies? I saw that yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: what's your reaction?<br />
PM: Well I don't know. I mean I obviously haven't got all<br />
the details of that at my fingertips but I'm sure those who<br />
know about it, Mr Boucher and others, are looking at it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think perhaps it's morally wrong?<br />
PM: Well let me wait and see, until I've got more<br />
information on it.<br />
E JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how do you think it went?<br />
PM: From our perspective it went very well, thank you. In<br />
each of the countries we were able to establish a much<br />
firmer base I think for relations of Australia with them,<br />
that's with the Republic of Korea and Thailand and Pakistan<br />
and India. Now on a more substantial basis I think the<br />
opportunities for developing our economic trading<br />
. relationship have been enhanced, as well as relations in a<br />
whole range of other fields, cultural, sporting and so on.<br />
It's been very very worthwhile from Australia's point of<br />
view. JOURNALIST: Inaudible<br />
PM: It was hard work but yes I enjoyed it. I think<br />
everyone else did.<br />
