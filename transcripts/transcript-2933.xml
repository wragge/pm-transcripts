THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 22 MAY 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Gentlemen: When nearly six months ago<br />
I promised to have a press conference every Tuesday that<br />
I was in Canberra, I had hoped that I would be able to<br />
have them alternating between Tuesday morning and<br />
Tuesday afternoon so that the afternoon papers and the<br />
morning papers could share the benefits. As you know,<br />
it has proved impossible to have any in the morning<br />
because there has been no break between the Cabinet<br />
meetings on Tuesday morning and then Question Time and<br />
the necessary proceedural matters in the House. However,<br />
last week and, of course, this week and next week there<br />
will be Cabinet meetings on Monday. I had hoped that we<br />
would be able to get through the Cabinet meeting yesterday<br />
in time to have the Press Conference on Monday afternoon.<br />
We weren't able to do so, so then I thought we would have<br />
this one this morning after Question Time. We can't<br />
have a Question Time until the Speaker lands, so I hope<br />
it hasn't inconvenienced you we can have it now.<br />
Now I have got no information to give you because the<br />
decisions of the Cabinet were released to you yesterday.<br />
You know my principle I don't release these until<br />
after Question Time, and if people don't have the gumption<br />
to ask questions at Question Time about Cabinet decisions<br />
then you are the first recipients of them. But they have<br />
been given to you.<br />
Q. Could I ask you whether your Government<br />
approached the States to try and settle areas of difference<br />
on the Off-Shore Resources legislation. If not, why not,<br />
and what have you to say about the South Australian Premier,<br />
Mr. Don Dunstan's comments on Sunday night that the new<br />
Federal Labor Government should have held such talks with<br />
the States?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Any such talks would have been futile.<br />
Mr. Gorton found that. We decided to go ahead. The States<br />
are completely intransigent on this subject, and in my policy<br />
speech well, I will go back further. The Labor Party<br />
declared its attitude towards this legislation at its last<br />
Federal Conference at Launceston in June 1971. I mentioned<br />
that we were going to enact the legislation if the people<br />
returned us. I said that in my Policy Speech in November.<br />
The Governor-General's speech opening this Parliament undertook<br />
that his Government would introduce the legislation. He used<br />
the same words as he used in opening the previous Parliament in<br />
February 1970. In the meantime, the Cabinet had made the<br />
decision. I think it was in January it was one of the very<br />
early decisions that we made. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
PRIME MINISTER CONT... The decision was communicated to<br />
all the Premiers. Without conferring with the Australian<br />
Government, one of the State Government's did in fact seek<br />
to approach the British Government about this I think<br />
in February. But in all events gentlemen, the Labor<br />
Party's attitude on this has been known ever since the<br />
legislation was first introduced over three years ago<br />
by a Minister representing Mr. McMahon who was then the<br />
Foreign Minister. It remained on the Notice Paper for the<br />
whole of the rest of the last Parliament. Throughout<br />
the three years of the last Parliament the Labor Party<br />
supported the legislation. Everybody has known and expected<br />
that we would enact it, and this is our intention. Any<br />
consultations with the States on this subject would have<br />
been as futile now as it proved in 1970, 1971 and 1972.<br />
The whole reason for it is this: That Australia is<br />
believed to have valuable resources under the Territorial<br />
Sea and in it, on and under the Continental Shelf. We don't<br />
want to have the situation which has applied to our on-shore<br />
resources, particularly Mr. Court as he then was and<br />
Mr. Bjelke-Petersen enabled overseas interests to get access<br />
to Australian on-shore resources under terms which were to<br />
the disadvantage to our country. We don't want the same<br />
situation to arise if 7 Governments in Australia exercise<br />
or purport to exercise Jurisdiction over our off-shore<br />
resources. There ought to be one national Government<br />
dealing with this. We shouldn't allow a Federal system<br />
to distract us from that issue and to dissipate our<br />
resources once again. You don't want this sort of break<br />
of gauge position arising in respect to those resources<br />
where this country is fortunate, particularly minerals and<br />
fuels. Q. On the Victorian State elections, Mr. Whitlam.<br />
There was an apparent drop of about 6 per cent in support<br />
for the Labor Party since the Federal election. Were you<br />
concerned about this, and do you attribute it to a lack<br />
of confidence in either the State Labor Party or the<br />
Federal Labor Party?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No I don't attribute it to either. Of<br />
course I was disappointed in the Victorian result. We got<br />
only a marginally improved percentage of the vote over the<br />
last State elections, but I will certainly give, and we<br />
should all give credit to Mr. Hamer for having the good<br />
sense to pick the eyes out of Labor policy. He is a very<br />
different man to Sir Henry Bolte. He sees a good idea,<br />
he identifies it and he adopts it. In fact, on the<br />
relevant issues as everybody was saying before the<br />
election there was very little difference between<br />
Mr. Hamer and Mr. Holding and for that matter, myself.<br />
Q. I refer to reports in this morning's press<br />
about the cost of Commonwealth cars for ministerial staffs<br />
and staffs of Opposition leaders, and I ask you whether you<br />
are concerned about this misuse of Commonwealth cars, has<br />
Cabinet discussed the matter, and are any new controls on<br />
the use of these cars by the staffs of ministers and Opposition<br />
leaders being considered? </p>
<p>-3<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There has been no Cabinet discussion on this,<br />
and I haven't seen the report on which the story is based.<br />
I was naturally very interested in the report. I notice<br />
that it was said that Mr. Lynch's staff has spent some<br />
thousands of dollars on taxi orders. Yes, well I have<br />
been unable to verify it I don't know what the strength<br />
of this report is. I haven't seen it. I mean I've seen<br />
no report upon which this story could be based.<br />
Q. In view of the shortages of labour apparent<br />
in the BHP and GMH factories, are you considering any<br />
reassessment of the migrant intake, particularly<br />
unskilled migrants?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is a matter where really I think it would<br />
be more helpful if you were to discuss the matter with<br />
Mr. Grassby or Mr. Cameron. There has been difficulty in<br />
recruiting unskilled labour for some of these remote or<br />
unattractive jobs, and both ministers have made cormments on<br />
this. I believe there are discussions taking place on it.<br />
I have not been involved in them and the Cabinet hasn't<br />
discussed them.<br />
Q. I was told this morning that Cabinet decided<br />
to support the Senate Inquiry into the Croation issue.<br />
Does this recognise the right of the Opposition to determine<br />
business of the Senate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is a matter which will come before the<br />
Caucus tomorrow. It is not a matter which Cabinet decides by<br />
itself, the Caucus decides whether it will participate in<br />
Parliamentary committees which are proposed by any or several<br />
of the Opposition parties, so that is something which I would<br />
expect to be determined at Caucus tomorrow.<br />
Q. Yesterday the retiring President of the Arbitration<br />
Commission was asked about the penal sanctions, and he said that<br />
they didn It really matter either one way or another and that it<br />
was a matter of political ideology and not of reality. In the<br />
context of the Victorian election results, would you be prepared<br />
to hold a double dissolution on the issue of the penal clauses<br />
being rejected by the Senate, and would you be prepared to have<br />
the election campaign fought on that issue?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The crucial part of the Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Bill which has been passed by the House of<br />
Representatives and is now awaiting the Senate doesn't turn<br />
on the penal clauses. There have been penal clauses for many<br />
years now, I think since 1951, and in recent years throughout<br />
the history of the McMahon Government, and I think throughout the<br />
greater part of the history of the Gorton Government, they were<br />
never used, so they generate a very great deal of heat and<br />
they have very little effect. What Sir Richard Kirby said was,<br />
I think, as in most things he says, good sense. But the crucial<br />
thing, the central thing which the Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Bill aims to do is to remove the barriers the union amalgamation<br />
which were introduced in the Lynch law of last year and in fact<br />
to facilitate union amalgamations. one of the very great<br />
impediments to economic advance and industrial relations in<br />
Australia is the fact that we have over 300 unions. If we only<br />
had 30 unions we would be a much more orderly and prosperous<br />
community. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
PRIME MINISTER CONT Inevitably jurisdictional disputes,<br />
demarcation disputes arise when there are so many unions, and<br />
European countries in particular, marvel at the archaism, the<br />
anarchy, of the dispersion of our industrial organisations.<br />
Now I believe that is something recognised by people in the<br />
employers side and everybody interested in industrial relations,<br />
that we would be very much better off if we had 30 unions in<br />
Australia instead of 300. I think there are only about 14<br />
unions in Australia which have more than 50,000 members.<br />
That's/ far too attentuated form of industrial organisation.<br />
There are, I think, a hundred or a couple of hundred unions which<br />
have less than 1,000 members. I don't know the exact figures but<br />
if you are interested I can get them for you, of course.<br />
Now that is an absurd position. Now you mention the position<br />
about a double dissolution. Everybody should know, and I do<br />
believe that you gentlemen of the press should play your part<br />
in letting people know if they don't know already, that the<br />
circumstances for a double dissolution arise when the Senate<br />
has twice rejected a bill from the House of Representatives<br />
or twice made a unreasonable delay in dealing with a Bill<br />
from the House of Representatives, or has twice unacceptedly amended<br />
a Bill from the House of Representatives. Each of those actionsthe<br />
rejection, the delay, the amendment having a clear three<br />
months interval. No what's happened at this stage is that the<br />
Senate has rejected one Bill, the Electoral Bill, and that will<br />
be introduced as early as possible, probably the first day again<br />
in the Budget session. Now is those circumstances, if it is<br />
rejected again, there would be the circumstances for a double<br />
dissolution. If a double dissolution takes place it will<br />
obviously be in the context that there has to be an election<br />
before the end of June next year for half the Senate anyhow.<br />
Now let there be a bit of rationality about this. The<br />
circumstances haven't yet arisen, they may not, but they can't<br />
arise for a few months yet.<br />
Q. In your foreign affairs role. Have you sought<br />
any support from other countries for the Australian case to<br />
the ICJ through diplomatic channels, and specifically, will you<br />
be seeking the support of the Danes when you see the Danish<br />
Foreign Minister, I think on Wednesday?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We have already, of course, sought the<br />
participation and achieved the participation in the proceedings<br />
by New Zealand and by Fiji. You will recall that I discussed<br />
this matter with Mr. Kirk in Wellington last January and our<br />
respective Attorneys General, Dr. Finley and Senator Murphy<br />
have discussed it a few times in between and I've been on the<br />
telephone to Mr. Kirk a few times and I also discussed it<br />
with him in APIA at the meeting of the South Pacific Forum.<br />
I also discussed the matter with Ratu Mara, the Prime Minister<br />
of Fiji when he was in Sydney about three months ago, and also<br />
in APIA and there haw~ been telegraphic communications with the<br />
Fijians. So, in fact, the application is three-fold:<br />
Australia, New Zealand and Fiji. When I see the Danish Foreign<br />
minister this week I expect to raise it. As you will remember,<br />
I did raise it with Mr. Trudeau in Vancouver on Holy Thursday,<br />
with the Foreign Secretary of Britain on the Tuesday after<br />
Easter, and with Mr. Colombo in Rome on the Thursday in Easter<br />
week and with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of<br />
Mauritius over that following weekend. </p>
<p>5<br />
Q. Sir, when you say you raised it with them, did<br />
you seek their diplomatic support in perhaps their moving<br />
against France as well?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: None of the States even in the Common<br />
Market support France. They all think France ought to sign<br />
the partial test ban treaty which was accepted by the United<br />
States, Soviet Union and Britain ten years ago. Perhaps I<br />
should add this here, that there is a very great deal of<br />
confusion and deliberate obfuscation about the attitude of the<br />
Australian Government to Chinese nuclear tests in the atmosphere.<br />
I made it plain to Mr. Chi Peng-fei in July 1971, and<br />
Dr. Cairns has done so to Mr. Chou En-lai last week, that we<br />
believe that these tests are objectionable whoever carries<br />
them out, but we are taking proceedings in the International<br />
Court of Justice. We are doing so on the advice of some of<br />
the leading practitioners before the Court, and leading<br />
academic men in the field of international law. We are<br />
doing so because there is a 1928 Agreement to which both<br />
France and Australia are parties and New Zealand also, which<br />
permits use by each of the parties to have their disputes<br />
settled by the World Court. China is not a<br />
party to that 1928 Agreement. Again, we are parties to the<br />
Statute of the International Court of Justice, so is New<br />
Zealand, so is France, so is Fiji. China is not. So<br />
the things that we are doing about the French nuclear<br />
tests are not available against any Chinese nuclear tests<br />
in the atmosphere.<br />
Q. Sir, I realise the demand for funds from<br />
various sources is a matter that has not probably been sorted<br />
out by the Cabinet or the Government in its entirety, but<br />
the go-ahead for the re-development of Brisbane airport appears<br />
to have been delayed or deferred by the Cabinet. You may<br />
have even heard of some of this concern during your visit<br />
to Eagle Farm race course last Saturday. If there has been<br />
a delay or deferral, when do you expect Cabinet to deal with<br />
this long-standing matter and can you give any assurance<br />
that this long delay delayed for many years by the previous<br />
Government for the re-development of the Brisbane airport<br />
to bring it to full international standard will not be affected<br />
by any decision to have a second airport for Sydney?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Cabinet has completed its deliberations<br />
on this matter. There will be no further ones for some months.<br />
At any rate, the decision, I think, was announced after the<br />
meeting at which we considered it. That would have been three<br />
or four months ago, I think. Now I don't want to be more<br />
precise on this because I'm not sure if I haven't been in<br />
correspondence with Mr. Bjelke-Petersen about this and after<br />
the conference is over I will see if there is any more I can<br />
tell you about this including the question of correspondence.<br />
You will realise that I don't want to say anything on this<br />
subject which would produce any inflation of land prices in<br />
any relevant area. In answer to a previous question, I was<br />
referring to this 1928 treaty, to which Australia, New Zealand,<br />
France are parties. The precise title is the 1928 General Act<br />
for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Q. Have you received any indication yet whether<br />
President Nixon will invite you to the White House when<br />
you are on your way to Ottawa in August. How do you see<br />
the present state of Australian-American relations?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There has been no communication either way<br />
on this subject. I will be in North America between the<br />
engagements I have accepted in Mexico and those, of course,<br />
which I have undertaken as a Commonwealth Head of<br />
Government in Ottawa.<br />
Q. Does your answer to the double dissolution<br />
question mean that you won't now go ahead with your threat<br />
to recall Parliament during the winter recess, to consider<br />
any Bills that may have been thrown out by the Senate between<br />
now and the end of the sitting?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, let me clarify that one. If the<br />
Senate rejects a Bill from the House of Representatives,<br />
the Representatives knows that fact, it is informed of that<br />
fact, no action is required by the House of Representatives.<br />
It can, after a lapse of three months, following the rejection,<br />
introduce the Bill again. That is what we will be doing in<br />
respect of the Electoral Bill which the Senate rejected last<br />
week. The only circumstances in which the House of Representatives<br />
will be recalled before the Budget Sittings are if the Senate<br />
makes amendments to any Bill from the House of Representatives<br />
and then the Cabinet believes that those amendments are<br />
unacceptable in those circumstances to save time we could recall<br />
the Caucus and then we could recall the House of Representatives<br />
and we would reject the amendment which the Senate had made.<br />
In those circumstances we could three months later introduce<br />
the Bill in its original form or with any amendments which<br />
commended themselves to us. But you don't recall you don't<br />
have to recall it would be completely superfluous,<br />
irrelevant to recall the House of Representatives if a Bill from<br />
the House of Representatives was rejected outright by the Senate.<br />
The three months. dates in the case of rejection from the date<br />
of the rejection. The three months date in the case of an<br />
unacceptable amendment from the date when the House of<br />
Representatives refuses to accept the Amendment.<br />
Q. You told last week's Caucus you would recall,<br />
now you say " could". Which is it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That will depend on the actions, the<br />
nature of the amendment.<br />
