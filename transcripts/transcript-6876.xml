EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
AUSTRALIA: APPROACHING 1988<br />
MELBOURNE 5TH APRIL 1986<br />
MR CHAIRMAN, MR PREMIER, MINISTERS, PARLIAMENTARY<br />
COLLEAGUES, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, FRIENDS.<br />
FIRST, MR CHAIRMAN, LET ME THANK AND CONGRATULATE THE<br />
VICTORIAN BRANCH FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER, IN THIS VERY<br />
REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY OF VICTORIANS AND AUSTRALIANS, WITH<br />
THE TIMELY THEME OF APPROACHING 1988 THE BICENTENNIAL YEAR<br />
OF THIS NATION.<br />
I SAY ' TIMELY', BECAUSE, WITH THE YEAR ITSELF LESS THAN TWO<br />
YEARS AWAY, AND WITH PLANNING AND ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES WELL<br />
ADVANCED AT BOTH THE NATIONAL AND STATE LEVELS, THERE IS A<br />
NEED FOR US ALL TO BEGIN TO THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT THE<br />
MEANING AND PURPOSE OF THIS EVENT ITS MEANING AND PURPOSE<br />
FOR AUSTRALIA AND AUSTRALIA'S FUTURE.<br />
WITHOUT THAT CONTENT OF THOUGHT AND SELF-EXAMINATION, THE<br />
CELEBRATIONS THEMSELVES, HOWEVER MEMORABLE I HOPE AND<br />
BELIEVE THEY WILL BE FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS, WOULD BE HARDLY OF<br />
MORE SIGNIFICANCE TO AUSTRALIA THAN THE VISITATION OF<br />
HALLEY'S COMET SOMETHING WORTH SEEING OF COURSE, AND<br />
SIGNIFICANT IN ITSELF BUT ESSENTIALLY IRRELEVANT TO OUR<br />
COUNTRY'S FUTURE.<br />
AND NOW IS THE TIME WELL BEFORE THE DAWN OF 1988 TO<br />
BEGIN THAT PROCESS OF NATIONAL STOCK-TAKING WHERE WE HAVE<br />
BEEN AND) WHERE WE ARE GOING SO THAT BY THE BICENTENNIAL<br />
YEAR THERE WILL HAVE EMERGED A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING, BY ALL<br />
AUSTRALIANS, OF THE MEANING AND TRUE SPIRIT OF THE<br />
BICENTENARY. MUCH OF THAT MEANING AND SPIRIT IS I BELIEVE, ENCAPSULATED<br />
IN THE THEME NOW ESTABLISHED FOR THE BICENTENNIAL.<br />
ONE OF THE EARLIEST DECISIONS I TOOK ON BECOMING PRIME<br />
MINISTER THREE YEARS AGO WAS TO CHANGE THE DESIGNATED THEME.<br />
YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT UNDER THE PREVIOUS DISPENSATION IT HAD<br />
BEEN DESIGNATED AS " TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
ACHIEVEMENT". I HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT INAPPROPRIATE NOT<br />
BECAUSE OF ANY LACK OF LEGITIMATE PRIDE IN WHAT WE HAVE </p>
<p>ACHIEVED ( QUITE THE CONTRARY), BUT BECAUSE, IN MY VIEW AND<br />
IN MY COLLEAGUES' VIEW, IT WAS PAR TOO NARROW AND INDEED<br />
BACKWARD-LOOKING, A FOCUS.<br />
SO AT MY SUGGESTION, ON AUSTRALIA DAY 1984, THE BICENTENNIAL<br />
AUTHORITY ESTABLISHED A NEW THEME OR TO BE MORE CORRECT<br />
REVERTED TO ITS ORIGINALLY PREFERRED THEME " AUSTRALIANS<br />
LIVING TOGETHER".<br />
AND I THINK THE REALLY IMPORTANT POINT TO NOTE IS THAT THIS<br />
REPRESENTS MUCH MORE THAN A STATEMENT ABOUT AUSTRALIA AS IT<br />
HAS GROWN OVER THE LAST 200 YEARS. IT IS THAT, BUT MUCH<br />
MORE. IT IS AN AFFIRMATION FOR THE FUTURE.<br />
BECAUSE, OUR CAPACITY TO LIVE TOGETHER, TO WORK TOGETHER IN<br />
OUR INCREASINGLY DIVERSE SOCIETY, IN A GENUINELY<br />
MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY, IS THE VERY CONDITION FOR OUR FUTURE<br />
SUCCESS AND SURVIVAL AS A COHESIVE COMMUNITY.<br />
SO THE BICENTENNIAL THEME, " LIVING TOGETHER" IS NOT JUST A<br />
DESCRIPTION OF MODERN AUSTRALIA IN 1988 BUT, IN A VERY REAL<br />
SENSE, A PRESCRIPTION FOR AUSTRALIA FAR BEYOND 1988.<br />
AND I BELIEVE THAT THE AUSTRALIAN ACHIEVEMENT OVER THE LAST<br />
3 YEARS HAS PROVIDED AN OUTSTANDING EXAMPLE OF THAT<br />
PRESCRIPTION IN ACTION.<br />
MY FRIENDS, IT IS EXACTLY 3 YEARS NEXT WEEK SINCE THE<br />
HISTORIC NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT.<br />
BEHIND THE CONCEPT OF THE CONFERENCE LAY MY LONG-HELD BELIEF<br />
THAT AUSTRALIA COULD NO LONGER AFFORD TO GO DOWN THE PATH OF<br />
CONFRONTATION AND FRAGMENTATION WHICH HAD EMBITTERED AND<br />
DISFIGURED SO MANY ASPECTS OF OUR NATIONAL LIFE, FOR MUCH OF<br />
THE PREVIOUS DECADE.<br />
AND I SAID WHEN OPENING THE SUMMIT ON 11 APRIL 1983 THAT THE<br />
NEED FOR NATIONAL RECONCILIATION WENT FAR BEYOND THE<br />
ECONOMIC CRISIS WE THEN FACED AND NEED I REMIND YOU THAT<br />
AUSTRALIA WAS THEN EXPERIENCING ITS WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS<br />
FOR 50 YEARS.<br />
I SAID THEN THAT WHAT WAS AT STAKE WAS NOT ONLY THE URGENT<br />
AND IMMEDIATE TASK OF ACHIEVING ECONOMIC RECOVERY, BUT THE<br />
FOUNDATIONS WE COULD LAY FOR THE WHOLE FUTURE OF THIS GREAT<br />
COUNTRY OF OURS INTO THE 21ST CENTURY.<br />
YOU WILL RECALL THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF SCEPTICISM<br />
AND CYNICISM ABOUT OUR APPROACH, AT THE TIME AND IT WAS<br />
NOT CONFINED TO THE RANKS OF OUR POLITICAL OPPONENTS, WHO OF<br />
COURSE HAD A DEEP VESTED INTEREST AS THEY STILL HAVE IN<br />
THE FAILURE OF OUR APPROACH.<br />
IN SOME QUARTERS, THE WHOLE THING FROM THE CONCEPT OF THE<br />
SUMMIT TO THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS WHICH EMERGED FROM THE<br />
COMMUNIQUE AND THE ACCORD WAS DISMISSED AS MERE RHETORIC<br />
SOMETHING THAT COULD NOT WORK, SOMETHING THAT COULD NOT<br />
LAST. </p>
<p>LET ME SAY THIS: IF THE IDEA OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION AS<br />
THE PRECONDITION FOR NATIONAL RECOVERY AND NATIONAL<br />
RECONSTRUCTION WAS MERE RHETORIC, THEN IT SPEAKS VOLUMES FOR<br />
THE PRACTICAL POWER OF RHETORIC IN THE ECONOMIC, INDUSTRIAL<br />
AND SOCIAL LIFE OF THIS NATION.<br />
BUT OF COURSE, IT WAS NOT RHETORIC AT ALL. THE WORDS, THE<br />
APPROACH, THE CONCEPT CLOTHED CLEAR AND PRACTICAL PROPOSALS,<br />
AND EFFECTIVE MACHINERY, FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF OUR NATIONAL<br />
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL GOALS AND OBJECTIVES.<br />
AND I EMPHASISE THE TWIN NATURE OF THE GOALS THE SOCIAL<br />
GOALS HAND IN HAND WITH THE ECONOMIC GOALS; SUSTAINED AND<br />
SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH AS THE MEANS TO OUR WIDER SOCIAL<br />
ENDS AND OBJECTIVES OF A FAIRER, MORE EQUITABLE SOCIETY.<br />
WHO COULD NOW DISMISS AS RHETORIC AN APPROACH THROUGH WHICH<br />
MORE THAN 600,000 JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED WITHIN 3 YEARS?<br />
AN APPROACH WHICH HAS REDUCED INDUSTRIAL DISPUTATION TO<br />
ITS LOWEST LEVEL FOR 16 YEARS;<br />
AN APPROACH WHICH HAS RESTORED THE PROFIT SHARE AND<br />
REDUCED REAL UNIT LABOUR COSTS TO THE LEVELS OF THE LATE<br />
1960' S AND EARLY 19701S;<br />
AN APPROACH WHICH HAS RESTORED AUSTRALIA'S INTERNTAIONAL<br />
COMPETITIVENESS TO THE LEVELS OF 15 YEARS AGO; AND<br />
AN APPROACH WHICH HAS CREATED THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY A<br />
NEW AWARENESS AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEED FOR FUNDAMENTAL<br />
RESTRUCTURING OF KEY SECTORS OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY.<br />
THESE ARE THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THE ECONOMIC RECORD OF<br />
THE PAST 3 YEARS.<br />
BUT WHAT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT NOW, AS WE APPROACH 1988,<br />
AND AS WE PLAN FAR BEYOND 1988, IS THE CAPACITY OF OUR<br />
APPROACH TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE FUTURE.<br />
THE PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD IS OF COURSE THE. CENTRAL PART<br />
OF OUR APPROACH THE KEYSTONE OF THE ARCH.<br />
BUT THE ACCORD ITSELF IS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO<br />
DECISION MAKING.<br />
IT PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE THOUGH BY NO MEANS AN EXCLUSIVE<br />
ROLE IN THE REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT OF STRONG GROWTH<br />
WITHOUT INCREASED INFLATION. IT WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY THAT<br />
ROLE. BUT THE SUBSTANTIAL IMPORTANCE OF THE ACCORD NOW LIES<br />
IN ITS CAPACITY TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK OF CERTAINTY AND<br />
PREDICTABILITY, YET AT THE SAME TIME TO PROVIDE A<br />
FLEXIBILITY TO COPE WITH UNFORSEEN CHANGES IN ECONOMIC<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS WHY IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE ACCORD SHOULD BE<br />
MAINTAINED. </p>
<p>YET WE NOW KNOW THAT OUR POLITICAL ADVERSARIES PROPOSE TO<br />
STRIKE AT THE VERY HEART OF THE ACCORD AND UNDERMINE THE<br />
FOUNDATIONS UPON WHICH ALL THAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED SO FAR HAS<br />
BEEN BUILT.<br />
I MUST SAY I FIND IT ALL VERY FASCINATING.<br />
THE POLICY MAKING PROCESSES OF THE LIBERAL PARTY ARE NOW<br />
QUITE REMARKABLE. THESE DAYS, IT APPEARS, THEY DECIDE HOW<br />
TO MARKET A POLICY BEFORE THEY MAKE THE POLICY.<br />
PERHAPS SOMEWHERE IN THE INNER RECESSES OF THE LIBERAL PARTY<br />
SECRETARIAT I SUPPOSE WE CAN CALL THEM THE " FACELESS<br />
MEN" THERE IS A DOCUMENT CONTAINING THE LIBERAL WAGES<br />
POLICY. BUT THE PARLIAMENTARY LIBERAL PARTY HAS YET TO BE<br />
INFORMED. MR VALDER HAS YET TO TELL THEM NOT ONLY HOW TO<br />
VOTE, BUT WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE VOTING ON. NO DOUBT<br />
THE POLICY WILL BE LEAKED IN DUE COURSE.<br />
BUT AT PRESENT THEY HAVE NO POLICY.<br />
YET THEY DO HAVE, AS YOU NOW KNOW, A STRATEGY TO MARKET<br />
THEIR NON-EXISTENT POLICY.<br />
YOU HAVE ALL BEEN WARNED.<br />
YOU ARE TO BE NEUTRALISED!<br />
SERIOUSLY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY<br />
BUSINESS IT ALL IS!<br />
NO POLICY, NO PROPOSAL, NO PLAN BUT A MARKETING STRATEGY.<br />
AND, THIS, FROM THE ONCE GREAT LIBERAL PARTY THE PARTY OF<br />
MENZIES, THE PARTY EVEN OF BOLTE.<br />
I MIGHT SAY IN PASSING THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND FROM A CERTAIN<br />
BIZARRE INCIDENT THIS WEEK, HOW SIR HENRY BOLTE MUST HAVE<br />
FELT WHEN THE FINANCIAL REVIEW, A MONTH OR SO AGO HEADLINED<br />
AN EDITORIAL " SIR HENRY BOLTE TURNS IN HIS GRAVE".<br />
BUT THE EDITORIAL DEALT COMPREHENSIVELY WITH THE APPALLING<br />
DECLINE IN STANDARDS AND CAPACITY OF THE LIBERAL PARTY AND<br />
THEREFORE WAS IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS COMPLETELY ACCURATE.<br />
BUT WHILE WE STILL AWAIT IN BREATHLESS EXPECTATION, I AM<br />
SURE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE LIBERAL WAGES POLICY, WE KNOW<br />
ONLY TOO WELL WHAT IT REALLY MEANS.<br />
WHATEVER ITS FINAL FORM, ITS MEANING AND PURPOSE WOULD BE<br />
RETURN TO THE CONFRONTATIONISM OF THE 1970' S AND ALL THAT<br />
THAT PRODUCED.<br />
SO WHAT EMERGES WITH CRYSTAL CLARITY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
THE ALTERNATIVE IS NO ALTERNATIVE AT ALL. NEITHER IN TERMS<br />
OF MEN OR IN TERMS OF MEASURES. </p>
<p>I DO NOT DISGUISE, FOR A MOMENT, THAT WE FACE, AS A<br />
GOVERNMENT AND AS A NATION, A TIME OF DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX<br />
DECISION MAKING.<br />
I DO NOT DISGUISE THAT SOME OF THESE DECISIONS MAY BE<br />
UNPALATABLE UNPALATABLE TO MAKE, UNPALATABLE FOR SOME OF<br />
US TO TAKE.<br />
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING FOR US, FOR AUSTRALIA AND FOR THE<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENTS OF AUSTRALIA, FOR THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR<br />
PARTY, FOR THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR MOVEMENT AND FOR THE WHOLE<br />
AUSTRA LIAN COMMUNITY IS THAT THE CRUCIAL DECISIONS ARE<br />
MADE WITHIN A COHERENT AND CONSISTENT FRAMEWORK, WORKING<br />
TOWARDS COHERENT AND CONSISTENT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL<br />
OBJECTIVES. A COHERENT FRAMEWORK AND A CLEAR COMMITMENT TO<br />
LONG-TERM GOALS ALONE CAN ENSURE THAT THE DECISIONS, HOWEVER<br />
DIFFICULT, ARE THE CORRECT DECISIONS.<br />
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT FRAMEWORK. WE ARE COMMITTED<br />
IRREVOCABLY TO THOSE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THE ECONOMIC AND<br />
SOCIAL OBJECTIVES OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY AND THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT.<br />
AND IN CONTINUING THE WORK OF ACHIEVING OUR GOALS, I BELIEVE<br />
THAT THE SPIRIT OF CO-OPERATION BETWEEN ALL SECTIONS OF THE<br />
COMMUNITY, WHICH HAS BEEN AT THE HEART OF SO MUCH THAT HAS<br />
BEEN ACHIEVED DURING THE PAST 3 YEARS, WILL BE JUST AS<br />
IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY, IN THE YEARS TO 1988 AND BEYOND.<br />
THERE IS NO WAY AHEAD AT LEAST NO VIABLE WAY AHEAD FOR<br />
AUSTRALIA BY ANY REVIVAL OF THE CONFRONTATION AND<br />
FRAGMENTATION OF THE PAST, OR BY THE PURSUIT OF PURELY<br />
SECTIONAL SHORT-TERM INTERESTS.<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, A VITAL ASPECT OF THE PROCESS OF<br />
CO-OPERATION AND CONSULTATION WE HAVE ESTABLISHED OVER THE<br />
LAST 3 YEARS HAS BEEN THE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN OUR LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA.<br />
MR PREMIER, I CONGRATULATE YOU AND YOUR MINISTERIAL AND<br />
PARLIAMENTARY COLLEAGUES ON THIS 4TH ANNIVERSARY OF YOUR<br />
ELECTION AND ON A MAGNIFICENT RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT FOR THE<br />
ADVANCEMENT OF LABOR'S CAUSE IN VICTORIA AND IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
I SHOULD MENTION HERE THAT TOMORROW NIGHT THE PREMIER WILL<br />
JOIN ME IN LAUNCHING THE NATIONAL DRUG OFFENSIVE A PROGRAM<br />
FOR A COMPREHENSIVE AND RELENTLESS CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE<br />
ILLEGAL DRUG TRAFFIC IN AUSTRALIA. THIS IS A MATTER OF<br />
PROFOUND IMPORTANCE TO OUR FUTURE AND OUR CHILDRENS'<br />
FUTURE AND ONE WHICH, OF COURSE, UTTERLY TRANSCENDS ANY<br />
POLITICAL OR REGIONAL CONSIDERATIONS. AND I ACKNOWLEDGE THE<br />
WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT AND CO-OPERATION WE ARE RECEIVING FROM<br />
ALL STATE GOVERNMENTS IN THIS GREAT NATIONAL EFFORT.<br />
BUT, AS MUCH AS THE IN THE WIDER ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ISSUES<br />
OF OUR TIME, THE SUCCESS OF THAT EFFORT REQUIRES, IN THE<br />
FINAL ANALYSIS, THE CO-OPERATION AND SUPPORT OF THE WHOLE<br />
COMMUNITY. </p>
<p>6<br />
IT NEEDS THE VERY KIND OF COMMUNITY CO-OPERATION SUPPORT AND<br />
GOOD WILL WHICH BROUGHT US OUT OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AFTER<br />
MARCH 1983 AND WHICH WE STILL NEED AS A NATION TO ENSURE<br />
THAT OUR EFFORTS ARE AS EFFECTIVE IN THE FUTURE, AND TO<br />
ENSURE THAT THOSE EFFORTS ARE NOT DISSIPATED IN SECTIONAL<br />
POINT SCORING.<br />
I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES, AND I SAY AGAIN TO THIS<br />
REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY, THERE IS NO AUTOMATIC GUARANTEE OF<br />
SUCCESS FOR NATIONS OR-FOR THAT MATTER, POLITICAL<br />
PARTIES IN OUR HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND CHALLENGING WORLD.<br />
WE MAY DESERVE SUCCESS BUT WE CANNOT COMMAND IT. IT HAS TO<br />
BE WORKED FOR, AND WORKED AT, UNREMITTINGLY.<br />
AND I BELIEVE THAT NOW, AS MUCH AS AT ANY TIME IN THE PAST<br />
THREE YEARS, THE KEY TO ALL WE HOPE FOR, ALL WE STRIVE FOR,<br />
IS THE MAINTENANCE AND FOSTERING OF THE SPIRIT AND FACT OF<br />
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION AND NATIONAL CO-OPERATION.<br />
I AM CONVINCED THAT THAT SPIRIT OF CO-OPERATION IS THE<br />
NECESSARY FOUNDATION FOR THE SUCCESS WE ALL SO DEEPLY DESIRE<br />
FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND FOR THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF WHAT IS<br />
NOW A UNIQUELY AUSTRALIAN EXPERIENCE AND A UNIQUELY<br />
AUSTRALIAN EXPERIMENT. IT IS ACKNOWLEDGED THROUGHOUT THE<br />
WORLD TO HAVE BEEN A REMARKABLE SUCCESS IN THE PAST THREE<br />
YEARS. THE TASK AHEAD IS TO BUILD ON THAT SUCCESS, IN<br />
ADVANCING AND ENHANCING THE EXPERIENCE AND EXPERIMENT OF A<br />
GENUINELY MULTICULTURAL NATION PERHAPS, IN-THAT RESPECT<br />
THE MOST DIVERSE ON EARTH LIVING TOGETHER, WORKING<br />
TOGETHER, BUILDING TOGETHER AN EVEN FAIRER, MORE SECURE AND<br />
MORE EQUITABLE SOCIETY IN THIS GREAT COUNTRY OF OURS. </p>
