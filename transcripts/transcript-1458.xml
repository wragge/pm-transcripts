    <content><![CDATA[<p>FOR PRESS P. M. No. 126/1966</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER'S CHRISTMAS MESSAGE TO AUSTRALIAN FORCES</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, Mr. Holt has sent the followingÂ message to Australian servicemen and women at home andÂ overseas: " To all Australian servicemen and women I convey, asÂ Prime Minister, the thanks and appreciation of the Australian people,Â and their warmest good wishes for your well-being and happiness<br />through the time of Christmas and throughout the coming year.<br />Australia is grateful to you for the personal contribution you are<br />making to the security of the nation. Behind the shield of protection<br />which members of our fighting services and our allies provide, this nation<br />is able to advance steadily in strength and prosperity.<br />" Some of you are actively engaged in operations of war.<br />We have followed with pride the story of your exploits, a story brightened<br />by the gallantry and devotion to duty you have demonstrated. Those of<br />you who are absent from Australia, whether on military operations, on<br />other active duty or joining in the tasks that enable us to honour our<br />international obligations, all have a special place in our regard. This<br />is true at all times, but you are much in our thoughts at that time of<br />year when most of your fellow -Australians can happily enjoy the love<br />and companionship of their families. We hope this deprivation will be<br />softened in some degree for you by the knowledge that you have our<br />heartfelt gratitude. " May the coming year bring a just, honourable and enduring<br />peace enabling many of you to be united with your families again in<br />1967." 1 HAROLD HOLT,</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER.<br />Canberra, 23rd December, 1966.</p>
