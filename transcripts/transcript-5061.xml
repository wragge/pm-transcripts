PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 4 JUNE 1979<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED: RADIO STATION 2EA, SYDNE-Y z-<br />
( SPECIAL BROADCASTING SERVICE)<br />
Question-I'm sure you realise it is an honour for the Special Broadcasting<br />
Service to have the Prime Minister of Australia to interview<br />
and of course it is a great pleasure for me personally.<br />
No doubt the world is going through a period of hardship and<br />
economic crisis. Each country more and more comes to the point of<br />
view that something more is needed a vision, a philosophy.<br />
A country without an ideal is surely stranded. President Roosevelt<br />
gave the Americans a New Deal in the Twenties to take them out<br />
of their crisis. Kennedy ushered in the New Frontier. What<br />
does today's Australia have?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think Australia is looking forward to the 1980' s now, with a<br />
very great deal of confidence. We went through a period where<br />
people felt that Governments could do everything; that you only<br />
had to ask and Government could provide. I think we now know that<br />
that is not really true, because what we have in Australia is<br />
what we all you and I and everyone else makes of it. Therefore,<br />
it is a question of defining what Governments ought to do and<br />
what people ought to do for themselves. Quite clearly, for those<br />
who are disadvantaged,' in special need, Governments have a<br />
responsibility, but communities often do too. I think in Australia<br />
we have, in a sense, a working out of what Government can do,<br />
must do, and then what the community ought to do, what<br />
individuals ought to expect to do for themselves. I think this<br />
lies behind, in my view, a vision of Australia where people are<br />
independent; they go their own way; where we are building a<br />
different and a better society as a result of the great<br />
migration of the post-war era. Australia can never return to<br />
the sort of country it was in the 1930' s. I don't think we would<br />
want it to, because then it maybe a somewhat narrow, somewhat<br />
insular, Anglo-Saxon society. Now we are certainly not that.<br />
Our culture has been enormously broadened. Our material<br />
well-being has been greatly strengthened by tens, indeed hundreds<br />
of thousands, of people who have come to us from Greece and from<br />
Italy and nearly every country around the world. I think the<br />
vision for Australia is a determination by all of us to make<br />
this a good country,% a better country to bring up a family, but<br />
to make it above all an example to the world of what a free<br />
people can achieve.<br />
Question Australia suffers from the tyranny of the distance. Isolation<br />
is a major handicap in everything, from importing new ideas<br />
to exporting Australia, whether it is ideas or products.<br />
Shouldn't the Government revard air transport as a community<br />
service that should be subsidised in some way? / 2 </p>
<p>2EA 2-<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't really think so. We are, of course negotiating, and<br />
have been very successfully, to get cheap air fares especially<br />
in the off-peak periods between Australia and a number of ports<br />
overseas. I think this is especially important, again, for<br />
a number of new settlers who have their friends and relatives<br />
in countries in Europe. I'm glad to see that the cheap airfare<br />
policy is becoming widely accepted. It is certainly<br />
attracting a great number of adherents tens of thousands of<br />
people are buying their tickets and I think it will do a very<br />
great deal to enable family reunions to take place and for people<br />
to meet their old friends. This is really bringing international<br />
travel within the reach of all Australians but it is doing it in<br />
a way that is still commercial. It's giving us the advantages<br />
of cheap air fares but doing it in a way that isn't subsidised.<br />
When you say ' shouldn't the Government do something about this'.<br />
you are not really asking the Government to do it, they asking<br />
us to take some funds from all taxpayers to get them to do it,<br />
because if we say we are going to fund something we have to take<br />
the funds from your taxes and everyone else's taxes. I think we<br />
need to use greater discretion in the way Governments spend<br />
taxpayer's dollars than sometimes we have in the past.<br />
Question The same effects of distance and isolation apply internally<br />
as well.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Oh yes, they do.<br />
Question Fares and costs are going up and isolating Australians from<br />
each other and now it's cheaper to fly excursion. from Sydney to<br />
London than to Perth.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't know about the excursion rates, but that wouldn't apply<br />
for other rates. took out some comparisons of fares across<br />
the United States the other day, and say, from London to Moscow,<br />
and the internal fares have all been much higher not just in<br />
Australia also in other places than the international fares.<br />
Part of this is the responsibility on domestic airlines to<br />
country towns, small centres,. places where you don't<br />
get much traffic but where-the service is terribly important.<br />
I think to an extent therefore, that the airlines probably<br />
equalise out--the general charges--but they do recognise a very<br />
real responsibility not just to service Melbourne and Sydney<br />
and Sydney and Perth, but also to service the country areas.<br />
I think your question recognises the importance of that. It is<br />
expensive, but on the other hand I think people are now travelling<br />
around Australia more than they ever have. only this morning<br />
I had 30 children to breakfast at the Lodge and they came from<br />
Ingham, from Townsville, from Perth and Darwin, from Alice Springs,<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>2-E-3 -<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
Tasmania, Sydney, Kirribilli, they came from all over.<br />
years ago I don't think anyone lthis was something as<br />
part of the International Year of the Child but 20 years<br />
ago people would have just said ' it's too difficult, travel<br />
takes too much time, air transport is too unreliable' and<br />
it wouldn't have happened. Now people are moving around,<br />
I think much much more than they ever have, and I think it is<br />
a good thing that they do.<br />
Question The recent mini-budget abolished the 40 percent Commonwealth<br />
subsidy for medical charges and increased hospital charges.<br />
Do you agree with the general opinion that the new system<br />
inevitably hits people on the lower income scales, particularly<br />
migrants? Prime Minister<br />
No, I don't think so, not at all, because the average hospital<br />
charge in State hospitals now is about $ 150 a day and the charge<br />
is going to be much less than that. It's in many cases won't<br />
be over half the actual cost, again, to the taxpayer. It's a<br />
question therefore how much of the health charge should come out<br />
of your own pocket or from insurance and how much should come<br />
from taxpayer's funds generally. Now, it ought to be noted I think<br />
that pensioners are protected through bulk-billing arrangements<br />
and disadvantaged people are also protected through bulk-billing<br />
arrangements that have been specially made with the medical<br />
profession. If it wasn't for those two protections I would have<br />
agreed with you that lower income people would be hit, but those<br />
two things protect lower income people. As for the rest, we've<br />
basically said in relation to the taking 40 percent off, people<br />
can pay the smaller bills themselves or insure. It's their<br />
choice, your choice and mine, but for the large bills, the<br />
calamatous bills that could destroy the financial capacity of<br />
a person or of a family, there is the complete protection there<br />
for each procedure no charge will be more than $ 20 because<br />
anything above that, whether it $ 1,000 or whatever, the Government<br />
will pay. One of the things I think it is around about<br />
percent of everyone is insured in one sense. I would like<br />
once befor-e in earlier times the percentage insured was over<br />
percent. I hope that what we've done will encourage more<br />
people to insure because I think when you do this it helps people<br />
to be aware of what the cost of services are and in some parts<br />
of the medical profession in pathology and hospital not in<br />
the treatment given . patients so much but in the way the hospitals<br />
are run there has been enormous extravagance and waste. There<br />
are many hospitals in Australia that have only got a 60 percent or<br />
percent bed occupancy but they are manned for 100 percent.<br />
Again, we've got to make sure that everyone has the best health<br />
care which we can devise but I think we've also got a responsibility<br />
to do it in a way which protects the revenue and which is<br />
economical. People also want lower taxes. I've heard a bit about<br />
that over the last few days. We certainly aren't going to / 4<br />
2EA </p>
<p>2EA -4-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
be able to meet that sort of wish for lower taxes unless<br />
the Government funds we spend, whether it is on education or<br />
hospitals, is spent efficiently and economically. I think that<br />
is what we are after.<br />
Question It has been repeatedly claimed that the present method of<br />
selecting migrants stresses three main factors: ability to<br />
speak English, the profession of professional qualifications<br />
recognised in Australia and the need to have capital. In other<br />
words, a new concept of immigration that discrimates against<br />
traditional immigration, the policy of open door for poor people,<br />
unwanted, oppressed and so on. What is your view on this?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I don't think the new policy is designed to do this. Certainly,<br />
of course, we place very high priority on family reunion, which<br />
w asn't really mentioned amongst the three criteria and personally<br />
I would place a higher priority on that because I think it is<br />
almost than anything else. I think it is very difficult if<br />
people have got their families partly here and partly half way<br />
' run the world. But at the moment, as you know, we do face<br />
employment problems and it would be difficult to sustain the kind<br />
of open door policy we might have had in the 1950s and<br />
without achieving a better employment position in Australia. If<br />
we tried to have an open door policy now, with a significant number<br />
of people in Australia unemployed, I think that we would get a<br />
lot of opposition from the trade union movement and basically<br />
the thrust of Australia's immigration policy has had support from<br />
all political parties. I want to make sure it stays that way.<br />
We are trying to increase the number coming in a bit and we want<br />
to go on doing that. I think one of the tragedies was winding<br />
down the migration programme when other things were running down,<br />
and that tended to make people contract and I think it contributed<br />
to the recession. But, building it up slowly, maintaining support,<br />
giving high priority to family reunion, then I think those other<br />
areas are given weight at the moment largely because of the<br />
economic circumstances in Australia. Nothing will suit me more<br />
when we get bac k . to the position in which there can be a freer<br />
flow of miaratioi to this country once again.<br />
Question The Ga-lbally Re port recommended that the. Committee on Overseas<br />
Professional Qualifications-should also investigate and advise<br />
on the sub-professional and technical qualifications. This is an<br />
area that applies to thousands of old migrants. Has the<br />
Galbally recommendation been implemented?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We've been doing a good deal of work through, in, the industrial<br />
relations arena because this gets into the question of trade<br />
union acceptance of overseas qualifications quite apart from the<br />
fact of whether the training is adequate, because if the trade </p>
<p>2EA Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
and training arrangements that have been introduced overseas<br />
the Government can accept them but if the trade union doesn't<br />
then there is going to be industrial trouble all around the place.<br />
There has been a great deal of patient work going on, not only<br />
since Galbally, but on a continuous basis, and Tony Street's<br />
Department has been very much involved in this and Employment<br />
and Youth Affairs is also involved. We are trying to get to a<br />
situation where there can be greater acceptance of overseas<br />
qualifications. But it is not just a question of a Government<br />
decision, it is not just a question of coming to a decision by<br />
Government~ that a particular trade qualification is adequate, it is<br />
also a question of bringing the trade union movement along with us.<br />
Therefore, we have been working through tripartite groups involving<br />
employers, employees and Government. I think the process and<br />
the progress in these areas is often much too slow, but I think that<br />
also appreciating the number of these areas where particular<br />
trade groups have a position which has been built up over the years,<br />
they are concerned that it is not going to be too much or too<br />
rapidly broken down. They feel an obligation to preserve the<br />
position of their existing members, people who have gained their<br />
skills in Australia. That attitude has to be broken down. I think<br />
progress is being made but again, not as much as the Government<br />
would like.<br />
Ques-tion<br />
It's a general situation.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It is a question of bringing people along in agreement because<br />
if we brought in people who have'skilled trades from Europe and<br />
then we find that the local trade union movement won't accept those<br />
skills, or for that matter the employers won't accept, then they<br />
won't be able to apply their skills in Australia or if they try<br />
to, it could lead to significant industrial dispute. So that is<br />
not really the way to go about it.<br />
Question Another recommendation on the Galbally Report is the one to<br />
give all migrants equal voting rights. What action has the<br />
Fra=-= er Government taken so far in this regard?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The Government is looking at this now, and I know the Minister for<br />
Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has given a great deal of attention<br />
to it. It is a difficult and a sensitive issue because, as you<br />
would understand, even though Australia has changed very greatly<br />
the earlier links with the United Kingdom are obviously much<br />
closer than links with other countries. That was so for many<br />
Australians and that is a fact of life. The question really is<br />
as to whether any residual element of that ought to remain in the<br />
recognition in relation to voting rights, whether all people should<br />
be put on an equal footing. It is possible, because of Australia's<br />
historic development, to have a legitimate argument both ways I think,<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>2EA -6-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
but the Minister for Immigration has been giving a lot of<br />
attention to it and the matter will be before the Government<br />
fairly shortly.<br />
Question Normally we say that we can vote for local Governments because<br />
we are taxpayers. Shouldn't the same principle apply at State<br />
and Federal level, being a taxpayer?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I think a good deal can be said for people being citizens in<br />
the full sense. Being an Australian citizen and being able to<br />
vote in State and Federal elections I don't know that it comes<br />
merely as a right because somebody lives in Australia. I think<br />
if a person does want to live here and if they want to participate<br />
in our own democratic processes, if they really want to contribute<br />
to Australia, then it is fair enough to take out Australian<br />
citizenship and to -become an Australian in the full sense of the<br />
term and really embrace this country. So I am not really in favour<br />
of something which just gives a person the vote just because they<br />
happen to be in Australia. I think a demonstration is needed<br />
on the part of the citizen that they are taking their living in<br />
Australia seriously, that this is really where they want to live.<br />
You could take an absurd position with somebody who is a traveller<br />
around the world and if you did it really on residence, and let's<br />
say there was a residential qualification of 12 months or something,<br />
he could one election be voting in Australia, another election voting<br />
in Canada, another election voting in Europe, but having no real<br />
home anywhere. That just demonstrates part of the difficulty<br />
I have with residential qualifications.<br />
Question Do you think the refugees flow should be totally absorbed by<br />
the ' Lew traditional countries of immigration which are obviously<br />
underpopulated and richer in terms of economic resources, like<br />
Australia, or should the whole Western world accept the<br />
responsibility? Prime Minister<br />
I think for a major refugee problem, the whole world has got<br />
a responsibility. We've been trying to internationalise the<br />
refugee problem from South East Asia. It is very difficult because<br />
apa-rt from America, Canada, Australia, and France, maybe one or<br />
two others, there are very few countries that are showing any<br />
interest at all. They are saying ' look, this is a problem remote<br />
from us, we are not really involved in it so we are not going to<br />
contribute to its solution'. Now, that makes it difficult because<br />
Vietnam has been actively promoting the export of its own<br />
citizens. There are some signs that on a Government basis they<br />
are again moving forward to encourage people to leave, to pay<br />
the Vietnamese Government for the privilege and therefore the<br />
/ 7 </p>
<p>7-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
numbers could be very large. Generally in a refugee situation<br />
governments have tried to prevent people leaving. We know the<br />
great exodus from Eastern Europe to the West and across to Berlin<br />
and the construction of the Berlin wall. Four million people or<br />
more ( inaudible) to get but of Eastern Europe. But there people<br />
East European countries Soviet Union was trying to prevent<br />
the exodus. Vietnam has adopted a different approach and if<br />
people don't like their regime well" go as quickly as you can fellow".<br />
That carries the possibility of very very large numbers being<br />
involved, which would obviously cause great difficulty for<br />
Indonesia and South East Asia and for Australia. We are very<br />
grateful for the assistance and help and the attitude being taken<br />
by South East Asian countries. I think Indonesia in particular<br />
has helped stop people landing unheralded and unannounced the way<br />
the boat people on the northern coast. They don't stop all the<br />
boats but they stop some of them, I think most. So in our own<br />
region we have a good deal of cooperation but we don't have the<br />
international concern which I believe the size of the problem<br />
demands. Question<br />
According to official figures in Australia, there are about<br />
50,000 illegal migrants. It is practically impossible to deport<br />
all of them I suppose. Wold' it be better to let them<br />
legalise their position, after all they would become 50,000<br />
taxpayers as well?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
For all I know, they might already be paying taxes. I hope some<br />
of them are. But, there are two problems with this. It is not<br />
a simple question. We had one amnesty and people could have come<br />
forward. Quite a large number did; not as many as we had hoped.<br />
If you are going to have another amnesty people will say " oh well,<br />
there will be another amnesty and another and another" and<br />
in a sense therefore illegal migration would be encouraged. Now,<br />
secondly, if illegal migrants are going to be enabled to stay in<br />
Australia by one means or another, that in my view acts against<br />
the interests of * t hose who seek to migrate in the normal way; who<br />
put their name down and within the system. They go on a waiting<br />
list-because they recognise we can't have everyone at once. I think<br />
we've got to protect the rights of those who want to do it the<br />
normal way, because if you are going to accept all the illegal<br />
migrants it will greatly reduce the number who could come in and<br />
who do wait and go through the normal-processes. When people<br />
come here on a visitor's visa wanting to try and stay and they<br />
do it because " we can get to Australia quickly on a visitor's visa"<br />
I know quite well that you get some difficult cases, in a sense<br />
heartbreak cases by applying a policy rigidly but I think a<br />
Government is in a dilemma. There is a policy. Those who are from<br />
other countries who are sticking to the policy and wait their<br />
turn to come here need to be protected. Their interests won't be<br />
if we make it too easy for those who come here illegally. Again,<br />
a lot of the problem I think gets back to economic circumstances.<br />
If we had greater employment prospects well then we would be<br />
/ 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
delighted for more people to come. The waiting lists would be<br />
less and I suppose there wouldn't be the pressure on illegal<br />
immigration.<br />
Question A specific question on Radio Station 2EA. With the present set-up, th<br />
41 different language groups we are covering for have not enough<br />
broadcasting time and not everyone enjoys prime listening time.<br />
The Federal Government has already made money available for<br />
a new and more powerful transmitter which will start operating<br />
as from July, the next. Also in July 2EA will have a different<br />
frequency. Our problems could be solved, I suppose, retaining the<br />
present frequency and transmitter together with the new one.<br />
It has been estimated that the extra cost would be almost<br />
irrelevant. Could we have some comment on this?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I'm not sure that the Treasurer would say that the extra cost<br />
would be irrelevant, but what you are really saying since there<br />
is going to be a new and more powerful transmitter, can't you keep<br />
the old one so you will have two transmitters, and there will be<br />
two ethnic radios.<br />
Question No actually. Just two frequencies which will give us more<br />
time to distribute, to allocate, to these language groups we have,<br />
particularly prime time, because some of them are suffering<br />
from the sort of...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I would be happy to take that up with the Minister for Post<br />
and Telecommunications. There are already inquiries launched<br />
about that because I was asked that same question at an ethnic<br />
press conference that I had in Sydney a little while ago, but I<br />
will make sure that I get an answer as quickly as possible.<br />
Question Don't you find it is ironic that despite the fact that most<br />
migrants come from Europe, Australia is having problems entering<br />
into trade with the European Economic market?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I think it find it very odd indeed. If there are any ways in<br />
which migrants can bring some pressure to bear on their<br />
home governments within the European Economic Community I would<br />
be delighted, because we have had a very difficult time. But a<br />
few days ago we did initial an agreement with the European<br />
Community on trade matters which doesn't give Australia great<br />
access but it does open the door a little bit. We get better<br />
provision for a number of commodities and a more secure provision.<br />
Also, I believe, the cost of the Common Agricultural Policy is<br />
9 </p>
<p>A 4 -9-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
going to break the European Community. It's almost unbelievable<br />
that now they spend $ 25 billion a year on either export<br />
subsidies or wage subsidies supporting particular industries.<br />
That's almost an inconceivable amount in Australia's terms.<br />
We've been arguing very vigorously for better access, as you know,<br />
over the last three years. We do this because we were a<br />
traditional supplier to Europe. It is a very large trading group.<br />
We do have many economic and social links with Europe. It is<br />
a very wealthy group of 200 million to 300 million people.<br />
The markets are important to us. But we have made progress. There<br />
is an initialled agreement. But at the same time, through your<br />
own contacts with various European countries, I hope the point<br />
will be made that some of the policies have not been very<br />
reasonable. Que-stion<br />
How can we argue our case for access to the Common Market when<br />
our own levels of protection are so high.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
But they are not really you know. We've measured protection<br />
in tariff terms or in qualitive restrictions and if you take all<br />
protective devices in, I think Australia stands up pretty well.<br />
it is really the level of access into a market that determines<br />
whether it is protective or whether it isn't what people<br />
ultimately end up by selling. Let's take the motor vehicle<br />
industry. We reserve 20 percent of the local market for imports.<br />
If you take France, they will allow imports in to about 7% or<br />
8% at the most; Britain, 12% or 13%; Italy Germany is<br />
more open door and one or two of the other countries are more<br />
open door, but in spite of the European Community individual<br />
countries have their own protective devices in the motor industry.<br />
If you take employment sensitive areas like textiles, apparel<br />
and footwear, Australia imports much more per capita than any<br />
other developed country. If the ASEAN countries to our near<br />
north had the same access to Europe and North America and Japan<br />
as they did to Australia they would be exporting an extra<br />
$ 1,000 million worth of goods a year. Their exports to us have<br />
been growing at-between 30% and 40% a year. I know there is a<br />
common view that Australia is a highly protected country, but<br />
our tariffs are marginally higher than Europe's only marginally.<br />
We don't have all the levies and protective devices, the new<br />
techniques of protection which Europe has developed. We don't<br />
have.-= the-w! a. g e subsidies. We don't have the export subsidies.<br />
We can spend a lifetime developing a Tharket in South East Asia;<br />
flour as we had in Sri Lanka, and then Europe came along and said<br />
we would like that flour market in Sri Lanka, how much subsidy<br />
would we need to push the Australians out of the market. That's<br />
just the question they ask; how much subsidy? We don't enter into<br />
that kind of competition. 14 million people cannot subsidise<br />
their exports against 260 million people in Europe. </p>
<p>2EA 10<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
While there is protection in Australia very obviously, and<br />
again during depressed economic circumstances you can't alter<br />
that radically and Austral ' ian industry needs a certain level of<br />
protection which we have indicated and made plain we will give it<br />
by and large, I think Australia's reputation is much bet-ter<br />
than a number of journals would indicate. We've got some free<br />
trade newspapers in this country. They write editorials on<br />
saying how protectionist we are, and they get quoted overseas<br />
and then it gets picked up. I think when that happens that we<br />
are arguing against Australia's own interests because on any<br />
objective judgement there are many countries around the world<br />
infinitely more protectionist than Australia.<br />
Question The last question is for our younger listeners. We have a special<br />
weekly programme in the English language for children. Would you<br />
like to send them a special message.<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
Yes, I especially welcome that opportunity, because this is<br />
the International Year of the Child and the future of any<br />
country is very much dependent upon children. It's not your future<br />
and mine, it is the children's future which is going to count<br />
and really determine what sort of country this is going to be.<br />
I would like to wish you all the very best of good fortune<br />
wherever you may be. I hope you work hard at school and I hope<br />
you enjoy it a bit because you've got to go through the process<br />
anyway and it is much happier if you can do it and enjoy it at<br />
the same time. It is very important because how well you do<br />
at school and afterwards depends what you do when you leave;<br />
what sort of job you can get. I would just like to wish you all<br />
the best for whatever you want to do and to make the point tha~ t<br />
whether it is going to be bricklaying or labouring or a lawyer<br />
or an accountant or a doctor or a schoolteacher, it is important<br />
to Pick 5, omething that you are going to enjoy doing. A job should be<br />
noGre than just work and a means of getting a livelihood. I think it<br />
is terribly important to at least be able to enjoy a fair part<br />
of what you are doing and then it is much easier to put the effort<br />
into it which is required if you are going to do it well.<br />
Nothing is worth doing unless you do put some effort into it.<br />
Gocod luck to you all, and especially for those who are leaving<br />
school at the end of this year.<br />
