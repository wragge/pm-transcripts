    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce today that the Australian Government will fund an innovative new programme to encourage the development of future leaders in the mining industry at a cost of around $500 000.</p>
<p> The centrepiece of the initiative will be bursaries worth $500 a year for potentially four years for 30 students who demonstrate an interest in pursuing careers in Australia's mining industry.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government Mining Career Bursary (CGMCB) scheme will commence in 2005.</p>
<p>Students commencing year 10 will be invited to apply for a CGMCB after demonstrating their ability and interest in pursuing study in mathematics, physics and chemistry in year 11 and 12.</p>
<p>Successful applicants will receive a $500 bursary towards books and other related expenditure in years 10, 11 and 12.</p>
<p>The bursary holders will also attend, at no cost to them, a four day workshop in Kalgoorlie at the internationally recognised Western Australian School of Mines (WASM) in the July school holidays in both year 11 and year 12.</p>
<p> Activities will include mine visits hosted by industry and specialised subject mentoring by highly qualified industry personnel.</p>
<p>Bursary holders who choose to go on from school to pursue the undergraduate mining program at the Western Australian School of Mines in Kalgoorlie will receive free accommodation for their first year and $500 towards study costs.  </p>
