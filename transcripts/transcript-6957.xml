TRAN'SCRIT OF IM'ERWrl WITH-GWXJFM NEGUS, 2UE/ 3AK, 12 JUNE 1986, E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
N. After all the blood sweat and tears of the last few weeks on the economy<br />
yoii must feel pretty let dollntg~ s universally actoss the country<br />
today, at aeast on page one, what you put to us last night has been<br />
thoroughly rejected.<br />
Well let's say this that some union spokesmen have, some business<br />
spokesmen, have the editorials have, been like the curate said, partly<br />
good, partly bad. I think the ground work has been laid and I think a<br />
number of them quite correctly say the time for judgement is along the<br />
.4I track. And the first time for judgemnent, I guess, will be tomorrow<br />
night.<br />
N. But you say some oF the unions have been negative in their response.<br />
Simon Crean is already saying that discounting is not on, which would<br />
appear to put you back in square one, because that's the cornerstone of<br />
what you have been getting at?<br />
I'm not back at square one, the position of the Govt. is quite clear.<br />
We have made the judgemnent as we see the economic situation now. But<br />
4hat<br />
in addition to the discounting involved and the delay in this case,<br />
lo further case betore next year, that there will need to be further<br />
A discounting the next case. That's the Govt. position.<br />
iN. So where does that leave you with the unions, because M~ r Crean is<br />
making it very clear, and of course the left wing unions are, that<br />
discounting, so far as they're concernedg is no longer negotiable?<br />
H. Well if that's what they say, I think we'll have to see what the Arbi.<br />
Comm. says because afterall neither Govt nor the Ubions. make the decisions<br />
for the Comm., the Commission makes it's own. I hope that they, in<br />
regard to this caselwill be impressed with what we're putting-that there<br />
should be the discounted And the positive finding on the<br />
II productivity. The alternative and this is what the business community<br />
of this country has just got to have the good sense, begin to understand<br />
that they couldn't possibly in the absence of this system have a 1986,<br />
calender 1986~ with no more than a 2.3% National Wage Case decision.<br />
That ' s all it will be.<br />
on the union front, Simon C. has said that he thinks it's askingj a bit<br />
much for the unions to make any further sacrifices. Now youtako<br />
L4. them last week, obviously you didn't get very far?<br />
I. well, it's a slow process. All I'm saying is that we are going to adhere<br />
1 on our judgement of the economic situation as we see it, to the </p>
<p>A<br />
-2-<br />
proposition that there needs to be-a further discount. The simple and<br />
unavoidable economic fact is that the world, by it's reduction in the<br />
prices they pay us for what we have to sell the world, has marked down<br />
our national income by We are 3% less able to sustain the standards<br />
of the past. NOW it's no good us trying to say that it hasn't happened,<br />
I wished it hadn't. But that's what's happened to our National Economic<br />
capacity as a result of that fall in our export prices. i ea l wi,( uaou.<br />
Simon Crean can't wish it away, George Negus with all his great powers<br />
can't wish it away. And so if George Negus and Bob Hawke can't<br />
wish it away, noone else can.<br />
N. But being very serious about it, are you asking Australians, the<br />
great bulk of Australians, those 6,000,0000 of them that are trade<br />
unionists at least, to take a cut in their living standards? I<br />
H. It was there in the speech, we will have to reduce our standards for<br />
the time being, it's there right at the very beginning of the speech,<br />
you can'-t say it more clearly than that.<br />
N. But their argument is that they're being asked to take the full force<br />
of tlis?<br />
H. Well unfortunately the fact is that wage and salaries earners constitute<br />
the overwhelming proportion of our national income and our nat. expenditure.<br />
so by definition it's amongst those of us who are employed that the<br />
lowering of standards will have to take place.<br />
N. on another though you're asking unionists to front up to the<br />
Arbi Comm and have the full force of the Industrial laws come upon them,<br />
but you're simply requesting business to help?<br />
H. Well the constitutional and institutional fact is that we have as a<br />
Govt as a society, the institutions' . to deal with wages and salaries. We have<br />
no constitutional or institutional framework to control business. r<br />
what we've got to do is exhort themand I certainly say this to the<br />
business community, if as a result of what I'm saying and if as a result<br />
of the AC. decisions we get this restraint in wages that I'm talking about,<br />
there is an overwhelming onus and responsibility upon the business<br />
community to respond in the area of their own incomes and salaries,<br />
2 iirectors' fees firstly. The onus upon them I believe, in the area of<br />
prices, to exercise price restraint, and thirdly to take advantage of<br />
the improved investment climate to increase their investment so we<br />
can broaden our export and import competing base.<br />
But you can see the point, all you can do is exhort, as you say,<br />
exhort business to do that? k<br />
TO act6 I a o r9 g , ht AtreO &amp; t rO e a( X. t S e tel i n s tit cie h e t walt h' wagUel<br />
The fact is George that there are the institutions to deal with wage<br />
-1 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
and salaries earners and we've got to use them,<br />
N. Would you liXe-to have thegal power to contr6l things like prices<br />
and executivesincomes and fees and profits?<br />
H. Well I don'tthe concept of price control is sensible and indeed, I must<br />
that. we haven't been pressed on that point by the representatives<br />
of the trade unionmovement, they're not really seeking price control<br />
as such. What we want to see is an economy which is freed up so that<br />
there is enough competition to ensure that those forces do bring<br />
about price restraint. In the areas where there's not'sufficient<br />
competition we will try respond more to anything that the Prices<br />
Surv. Auth. puts to us to see that their Aers in this area are<br />
improved. Now what the business communitj 7does have to understand, I<br />
is that the alternative to cooperation by them on this front, if they<br />
get this sort of restraint, the alternative is if the restraint's<br />
not exercised there will be a break away from the centralised wage<br />
fixing system and you'lll get a return to the period og the past ( AltJ$ AS:<br />
a free for all) Let's quantify it. Under the, under our conservative<br />
opponents they had that sort of system and they had a wages explosion<br />
of about 17%. Under the Liberals the average wages increase, earnings<br />
increase~ was over 11% per annum. We've got it down to And that's<br />
in a period of high economic growth. So it's quite clear that business<br />
would be confronted if this system breaks down, with chaos. Much<br />
higher wages o,' tcome, and then an eventual slow down and breakdown in<br />
I activity. The whole community has got to understand the facts. The facts<br />
are that there is this cut back in our Nat Economic Capacity. There's<br />
one of two ways that the economy will adapt to what the world has dqe.<br />
Either in this cooperative and measured way that we're talking about<br />
where we recognise the factSand still keep growth going, by holding<br />
back our standards and expectations, we do it that way. Or the other<br />
way is chaos where you have an attempt to keep up pre-existing standards,<br />
keep up your levels of expenditure by further borrowing, in that situation<br />
your exchange rate collapses interest rates go through the roof and the<br />
economy grinds, not merely to a halt but goes backwards. 1J,-d 0 1ttd<br />
Mr Hawke you say that some union leaders and some business people<br />
reacted negatively, I have to put it to you that if you look at any<br />
paper in the country and I've seen the Sydney and Melbourne papers at<br />
least, they have rejected what you have put to them almost out of hand.<br />
Tinsel and trust package. Tub thumpinq. Not even a modest molehill.<br />
Unions and Business rejects Hawkes plea, Biggest fizzer since Halley's<br />
Comet. etc. I mean you can hardly feel encouraged by that sort o. " 1 </p>
<p>,4 4<br />
n. well you see I have a somewhat more balanced view about the people of<br />
Australia, some of the statements you included there are those of the<br />
leader of the opposition, what can you expect from him. I'm siiplY, L,|<br />
saying that on my reading of the Australian ptudb leCi&amp; Oict IA" s~ Ak hat the ordintazrry d<br />
rank and file worker will understand that in these circumstances that<br />
there is need for further restraint. I believe that people have to<br />
make statements to their constituencies, including may I say the business<br />
leadWLS. Let me give you an example. I find the representatives of the<br />
Business Council coming out, in the reactions in this mornings paper,<br />
and condemning us for saying that there should be a positive finding<br />
by the Arbi. Comm. in the superannuation caser Now that's not what they<br />
tell us privately, they quite clearly outline it that it's much more<br />
sensible that this be done because they know that if it's not done<br />
in a controlled way over two years by*: the Arbi Comm that it would come<br />
in anotier way. So there is all the difference in world between<br />
things that some people feel they have to say publicly to what they<br />
really meall.<br />
N. But could I put this to you<br />
H. As the actual decisions are taken. As they see the firmness at : the<br />
Premiers Conference, the firmness in the Budget, see I hope an Adbitration<br />
decision which reflects the sort of approach which is sensible, as these<br />
things actually come into place, I believe, the reactionswill be<br />
positive.<br />
N. Could I put this to you. I talked to a lot of people this week and<br />
over the last couple of weeks about the flipp-flopping that's been going<br />
on in the economic policy arid the discussions you've been having with<br />
all sorts of people and ordinary blokes are saying to me. " I used to<br />
think Bob Hawke knew what he was doing, now I'm nbt at all sure" Other<br />
people have said it sounds like he's trying to make up his economic<br />
policy as he goes. And this whole thing is just an economic cosmetic<br />
effect that he's giving us here. Not any real policy. Does he really<br />
4'<br />
know what he's about?<br />
i've had discussions with you beforetthis question of what people say<br />
to you. I could just as easily say to you some of the things which have<br />
been said to me, which are quite in the oppositEdirection and from some<br />
very substantial people. Now that would be putting my quotation, my<br />
reference against yours9I don't think that get's us very far.<br />
But people would be a bit intimidated talking to you: the3 might be<br />
only interested in saying the right thing?<br />
I've never noticed that, I ' ye never seen you being intimidated.<br />
People talk very frankly to me. I get to the point which is this.<br />
7../ S7 </p>
<p>4<br />
People will make the judgemuents and they will be entitled to make the<br />
Judgements in terms of the delivery or non-delivery in the weeks and the<br />
months ahead and they can start making theirjudgement as from tomorrow<br />
night on that, after the Premiers' Conference.<br />
N. You say delivery or non-delivery, you'd have to acknowledge that at this<br />
point at least, the whole economic exercise that you've been going<br />
through has damaged you politically?<br />
H. No I don't aceept that. I think the judgements will be made about me<br />
And thisqovt. in the terms of what we have done. I just a~ sk you to<br />
remember we're now talking after we've been in Govt for a little over<br />
three years and I will stand on the record of achievement of this<br />
Govt. in any forum anywhere. The...<br />
N. Even though people are saying we' re facing a recession you will say<br />
you'll stand on your record?<br />
H. We're not facing a recession in terms of what we've been able to do<br />
in the economy. What has happened is, as the most recent Nat. Accounts<br />
say,-it has marked down the international world because 6f the lower<br />
prices they are paying for our products has marked us down by 3%.<br />
That's where our problem has occurred, now we have to make the'internal<br />
adjustments again to meet that challenge.<br />
Can I ask you this, is it possibly the case that for many years nowp<br />
say at least the last ten, Australians have been expecting too much<br />
that we are in the long run an extremely materialistic country<br />
and now we're paying the price?<br />
H. Well that is a far too simplistic a statement, what is the correct thing<br />
is that over a fairly long period there has been a gradual deterioration<br />
in our termis of trade and * we haven't, successive governments haven't made<br />
the adjustmentswhich are necessary to diversify our economic structures<br />
so that the composition of our exports are better able to protect us.<br />
Now that's been going on for some time, and because every now and<br />
then something~ happens and you get a lift people say well it's going<br />
to be all right. Well. it isn't going to be alright if we simply adopt<br />
that attitude. we've got to face up to the fact, now, that with this<br />
decline in our National Economic Capacity, brought about by this fall<br />
in our export prices we can't simply go on expecting to maintain the same<br />
standards by borrowing more,,<br />
You've talked to me this morning about the possibility of chaos if this<br />
ihole arrangement with the unions is not worked out on discounting<br />
and future national wage cases; last night on TV you talked about us<br />
living in a time of crisis it's a pretty bleak picture of Aus. that<br />
you're painting7 </p>
<p>6c<br />
H. ' No, ryou're emphasizing part of what I said. I said I belidve that<br />
Australians have the capacity to meet this challenge. I mean just let<br />
me go back to the point I made. Do you 4i~ exber what it was like<br />
in February ' 83. ; 1just before you took office) We had the worst<br />
economic crisis for So years, we had double digit unemployment and<br />
double digit inflation, the oountry in absolute despair.<br />
M. So why are people saying now that we ' re going down the gurgle hole and<br />
f ast?<br />
H. Well~ can you have a 30% depreciation in you currency a-14% decline in<br />
your Lerms of trade in the last year, and 9% decline in your terms of<br />
trade since last June avu*. say that's not having an adverse effect<br />
upon you? I mean that is a massive impact in a very short period<br />
imposed fromi outside on this economy. ( Negus overtalking) including the.<br />
thatfactandadjust it's policy settings accordingly.<br />
F nly sworking out this whole discounting and national wage<br />
problem with the unions the keystone of this whole thing, and if that<br />
doesn't work out over the next few weeks and months is the Accord in<br />
strife, and is your whole economic strategy in strife/<br />
* well ok'viously the question of wages is central to what happens to our<br />
macroeconomic atrategy. We've got to have a lower wages outcome.<br />
X believe that the next important point, in working it out is the<br />
Commissions decision.<br />
~. How do you tink the trade union movement would feel hearing an old<br />
ACTU President like yourself, telling them that they're the blokes who've<br />
got to vop all this7<br />
I think that the overwhelming rank and file will understand. I believe<br />
that the leadership of the Trade Union movement will come to understand.<br />
But I repeat it's difficult and I understand it. It is difficult for<br />
the trade union leadership to be in virtually anything other than<br />
the position they're adopting now until they see the decision by.-<br />
the Commission.<br />
Could you blame them for thinking...<br />
At this stage there has been no national Wage Increase in 1986. If they<br />
were not to get anything in this case that would mean nothing in 1986.<br />
Now they can't therefore finalize positions. If they get the 2.3%<br />
and some sort of indication that the superannuation will come over<br />
will spread over a period of some two years, then that creates a<br />
different framework within which they can formulate their position.<br />
Finally, You couldn't bl~ ime them in many cases for thinking that Bob </p>
<p>w7-<br />
Hawkess got into bed with business and has sold out the union movement?<br />
u. well then they ought to look at what the business community is saying<br />
you can't have it both ways. The business community's not saying that.<br />
Mr Hawke thank you.<br />
