. C. AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY POLICY SPEECH<br />
1993 FEDERAL ELECTION<br />
presented by<br />
PAUL KEATING<br />
PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
At<br />
Bankstown On<br />
Wednesday 24 February 1993.<br />
ADVANCING AUSTRALIA<br />
Building On Strength </p>
<p>Let there be no mistake. This IS the most important election in memory.<br />
Today we stand against radical right-wing proposals which are hostile to fundamental<br />
Australian beliefs and Australian institutions and all that we have achieved in recent<br />
years. Not new proposals, but old ones.<br />
Proposals which have been tried in other countries and which in every case have failed<br />
at great social and economic cost.<br />
Dr Hewson says these other countries did not try hard enough. He is nothing if not<br />
zealous. In this election there is Dr Hewson Dr Hcwson and Tim Fischer or there is Labor.<br />
I ask every Australian to think about this:<br />
When you wake up on March 14, whoever has won the election, there will still be<br />
unemployment. There will still be problems to solve.<br />
If Labor is re-elected there will also be an Accord between the unions and the<br />
Government, guaranteeing industrial peace, low inflation, and a continuation of that<br />
spirit of cooperation.<br />
There will still be Medicare, guaranteeing quality health care to all Australians<br />
regardless of age or circumstance.<br />
There will still be equity and access in education.<br />
There will still be a social safety net providing care for the aged, the sick, the les<br />
well-off and the unemployed.<br />
There will still be social policies expressly designed to manage the change we are<br />
going through, to alleviate the hardship and minimise the social damage.<br />
And there will be every reason to believe that we will continue to succeed in our<br />
ambition to become a great trading nation, a great Australian social democracy, a<br />
proud and independent country, united and cohesive and able to deliver to all our<br />
people living standards and a way of life unequalled in the world.<br />
And there will be NO GST. No miserable 15 per cent tax on virtually everything you<br />
buy. But if the Coalition is elected, within six months there will be no Accord instead<br />
discord no universal health system, no safety net.<br />
And there WILL BE a GST. </p>
<p>There will be much less equity and access in education.<br />
Workers will lose the protection of awards and be forced to negotiate individual<br />
contracts with their employers or take the sack.<br />
Everyone will be paying A 15 PER CENT TAX on virtually everything they buy.<br />
And you can be absolutely sure, NOT ONE NEW JOB will have been created by these<br />
measures. That is why this is the most important election in memory.<br />
T'here really never has been a clearer choice: between the Australian traditions of<br />
fairness and equity, and the economic and social jungle of Reaganism and Thatcherism<br />
which other countries have just abandoned.<br />
Fairness and equity have served Australia well, and never better than in this difficult<br />
period of change.<br />
We believe in change. To meet the national necessity we instigated it. But we believe<br />
it should be managed: we believe it should be moderated by supportive social<br />
policies. We think it should be calm.<br />
Recognising, that all change should have a social purpose, we take account of the social<br />
consequences. I lived here in Bankstown for forty years.<br />
This suburb of Sydney had all the best qualities of an Australian community. It still<br />
has. It is a microcosm of modern urban, multicultural Australia.<br />
Now, as then, it draws its strength from the people, and the people draw their strength<br />
from Bankstown.<br />
Perhaps because Banlkstown was such a strong community, there was a certain<br />
fearlessness about it, a great sense of security, a sense of self-sufficiency. One of the<br />
home-truths I picked up was that the world owes no one a living.<br />
Today a whole generation of Australians know that the world does not owe us a living.<br />
We arce the first generation of Australians to really understand what it means.<br />
I think I began to understand towards the end of the 70s it was then I began to form<br />
what was for me at least a new idea about Australia.<br />
The thought took hold of me that we could be a creative country, as well as a so-called<br />
lucky country. </p>
<p>I thought that we could become a great manufacturing country, a country which made<br />
things for the world to buy. Things which bore the stamp of Australian work and<br />
genius. I becamne convinced that Australia could be more than a quarry and a farm; that we<br />
could find a place in the front rank of trading nations.<br />
This of course was contrary to the prevailing wisdom.<br />
Yet in the early 1980s it very rapidly became apparent that the idea was not an option,<br />
but an absolute necessity. We no longer had any choice.<br />
The story since then has been a remarkable one. The Australian people are bringing<br />
into being a new Australia.<br />
An Australia which has more than doubled exports in nine years. An Australia which<br />
has tripled exports of manufactures and services.<br />
We still export the raw materials and much more effectively than before. But we<br />
also export high technology medical equipment and high-speed ferries, processed<br />
food, cars, computers, electronic and chemical products information, education,<br />
television programs, tourism.<br />
And increasingly those exports go to the fastest growing economies of the world<br />
those in our own region, Asia.<br />
These things have happened with remarkable speed.<br />
And so have these things: we have the lowest inflation in thirty years. The highest<br />
productivity in thirty years. The lowest number of industrial disputes in thirty years.<br />
We are far more competitive than we have ever been.<br />
What is more, we have a population with a proven capacity for change, and a proven<br />
willingness to meet the challenges Australia faces.<br />
But in the face of this success, our opponents talk incessantly of failure. Where there<br />
is hope they counsel despair. To sell their plan, they think it is necessary to talk<br />
Australia down to extinguish people's faith.<br />
My counsel is hope. These days it is more than hope it is belief.<br />
Belief in what the 90s hold for us all.<br />
rye always said that I wanted to be around for the 90s to see it all come true, to be<br />
part of the transformation.<br />
Our opponents say they have a plan. The word plan is forever on their lips. Their<br />
pollsters demand it. But they have the wrong plan. </p>
<p>Labor has more than a plan we have a whole national change a sea-change, born<br />
of national necessity, happening now. A change sustained by faith in Australians.<br />
A change not shaped by a computer model or a textbook, but bedded in reality and<br />
commonsense. A change that does not break the mould of Australian society, but reshapes it by<br />
drawing on its strengths.<br />
One that does not look back to the values of Thatcher's Britain or Reagan's America,<br />
but forward to the next century.<br />
I see Australia growing on the dual foundations of energy and care.<br />
Our energy flows from the genius and ambition of our people which the combination<br />
of liberal democracy and free markets alone can deliver.<br />
Our care flows from a spirit we have in common as Australians.<br />
You can see the energy emerging now in those remarkable figures I have quoted.<br />
You can see it in 700 dynamic small to medium sized Australian businesses, born of<br />
this era, dedicated to innovation, earning last year $ 8.6 billion in export revenue, and<br />
expected to double in five years.<br />
The same energy is apparent in the $ 130 billion worth of applications received by the<br />
Government for project development.<br />
It exists in the new, much more clever business culture in Australia a culture we<br />
ourselves have developed.<br />
The " Australian company" is today a much more innovative, dynamic, export-oriented<br />
entity than it has ever been.<br />
It will be the engine of growth and the pacemaker of employment.<br />
That is why two weeks ago we gave a further break to capital and innovation. We<br />
lowered the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33, providing Australian industry<br />
with a business tax system competitive with any in the world.<br />
This is where the energy will come from. And we will do everything we can to<br />
stimulate it and, where necessary, provide strategic support.<br />
We will make sure that Australia keeps its car industry.<br />
Toyota has already committed itself to a new state-of-the-art plant at Altona in<br />
Melbourne. Mtsubishi is poised to make major investments at its plant in Adelaide. The<br />
Government I lead will work closely with Mitsubishi to bring this about. </p>
<p>But no government incentive can match the opportunity offered to Australian<br />
companies by the emerging markets of Asia and the Pacific.<br />
Never in our history have we bad such an opportunity.<br />
I have no doubt that if we are wise I mean governments, business and the people of<br />
Australia we will see in the nineties manufacturing and trade on a scale<br />
unprecedented in our history.<br />
But it will not happen of its own accord.<br />
As much as it will need leadership, it will need nurturing and encouragement.<br />
We will need to grow companies committed to Australia, with workers committed to<br />
Australia. Our success as a nation will depend upon our companies, but equally it depends upon<br />
the degree to which we care about Australia and Australians.<br />
In an era of change the watchwords of good government should be care, support,<br />
cooperation. We must take the people with us. That is a Labor article of faith.<br />
We also recognise that on the way to our great social goals there have been problems<br />
as well as successes, and we recognise our responsibility for them. As Prime Minister,<br />
I recognise My responsibility for them.<br />
Governments in Australia in the eighties were not always as prudent or wise as they<br />
should have been.<br />
Nor were all companies: in the newly deregulated economy, a lot of their behaviour<br />
was not in the best interests of Australia.<br />
The excesses of the 80s must not reappear in the 90s. The last thing we need now is a<br />
return to the 80s philosophy of " greed is good" and that the only useful interest is selfinterest.<br />
As in other countries, in Australia a lot was wasted in the boom. And as in other<br />
countries, the recession nearly stopped us in our tracks.<br />
It is also true to say that even some of the gains we made had their social cost those<br />
productivity gains of the last few years are now adding to the level of unemployment.<br />
Industry is getting more product from fewer people.<br />
Unemployment is the greatest problem we face. It is the problem of the era. It is,<br />
overwhelmingly, the principal concern of the Government. </p>
<p>We have managed to achieve more economic growth than most other comparable<br />
countries. We have had four consecutive quarters of growth. But it has not yet begun<br />
to create enough jobs.<br />
And we're not helped by a sluggish international economy.<br />
What then is the answer? What is Labor's jobs strategy for the 1990s?<br />
Over the next three years Labor will place the emphasis where it has to be.<br />
On business and on incentives to invest.<br />
Labor's jobs strategy is ' designed to assist recovery in business. Under Labor, business<br />
will pay a tax of 33 per cent on profits compared with 42 per cent promised by the<br />
Opposition.<br />
Under Labor, business will be able to obtain an investment allowance of up to 20 per<br />
cent on all investment in the next two yea's.<br />
An incentive the Opposition will not be providing.<br />
And with Labor there will be no GST to weigh down business and depress spending.<br />
No big new taxes, no industrial conflict just sensible practical things to help business<br />
investment. But there is no doubting the magnitude of the unemployment problem.<br />
It will not be easy to reduce and no one should expect speedy results.<br />
But in the search for solutions, there could be no greater Moy than to proclaim the task<br />
an eay one, as Dr Hewson did last week when he promised getting " jobs rolling from<br />
day one".<br />
And no greater shame than to throw away the progress we have already made.<br />
It would be a tragedy if we let the recession crush our faith or ruin our work to date.<br />
There is the other lesson I learned growing up in Bankstown. In hard times you stick<br />
together. When you're confronted with a challenge, unity is strength.<br />
Every time Australians cooperate, every time they form a partnership, every time they<br />
agree on a common goal, every time they combine their ideas and their energy, they<br />
make Australia stronger.<br />
If one word describes Labor's policy for Australia, it is " cooperation'.<br />
Our policy must never be to undo the ties that bind us but rather to strengthen them as<br />
we did with the Accord between Government and the unions last week. </p>
<p>A new Accord committed to jobs, but built on the same fundamental principle of<br />
cooperation. Under the new Accord, wage increases will depend on progress towards creating jobs<br />
and reducing unemployment.<br />
This is what the Accord has given us. Our opponents in their anger will strike it down.<br />
And as it goes, the century long protection of awards will go with it.<br />
It is incomprehensible to me why anyone should wish to destroy it.<br />
But ladies and gentlemen<br />
Labor's quest for social equity goes on.<br />
Our recently announced child care policy recognises that the future growth of the<br />
Australian economy and the living standards of Australians need women's<br />
participation in the workforce.<br />
We recognise that child care is essential if women are to take a job, undertake training<br />
or study or look for work.<br />
Our commitment to meet total demand for work-related child care by 2001 will aid<br />
women's participation in the economy, as our 30 per cent cash rebate on fees will make<br />
child care more affordable especially for middle income earners.<br />
It is not good enough to say that a woman is either in the paid workforce or in the<br />
home. Chances are these days, in the course of their lifetimes, most women will spend<br />
periods of time doing both.<br />
The needs of mothers caring for children at home are often overlooked in the child care<br />
debate. But we have not forgotten them.<br />
I recognise and appreciate the important role played by women who choose to stay at<br />
home while their children are growing up.<br />
We propose to introduce a new cash payment of $ 60 each fortnight to be called the<br />
Home Child Care Allowance.<br />
This allowance is more generous than the Dependent Spouse Rebate it will replace,<br />
and has the added advantage of being paid directly to the mother at home. This will<br />
provide a source of independent income for women while they are out of the paid<br />
workforce caring for children. </p>
<p>In a further measure to meet the needs of women at home caring for children, we will<br />
extend fee relief to occasional care. This is in addition to my earlier announcement<br />
that we will double the funding for playgroups.<br />
Labor's child care policies recognise the reality that different families choose to deal<br />
with the responsibilities of work and family in different ways.<br />
Medicare is another concrete expression of the quality of our society and of Labor's<br />
commitment to it. Medicare is a statement as much as it is a system. It's a measure of<br />
our social progress. A measure of our care for one another.<br />
It is not yet the perfect health system, but it is without doubt among the very best in the<br />
world. The Coalition will pull it down. They say they won't. But, as everyone here knows,<br />
they will.<br />
They will abolish the foundation upon which Medicare rests. They will abolish bulkbilling<br />
for everyone but pensioners. 13 million Australians will have to pay their bills<br />
up-front. $ 32 a visit.<br />
The Coalition is determined to take our health system towards the American model<br />
the model that costs far more than ours, delivers infinitely less, and which the<br />
Americans are determined to replace.<br />
The Coalition would cut $ 1.3 billion a year from public hospitals while they cry<br />
crocodile teams over waiting lists. And they want to give $ 1 billion to the AMA<br />
specialists. Three dollars an hour for Australia's youth, three dollars a minute for<br />
doctors that is their policy.<br />
We will never abandon Medicare we will go on improving it.<br />
Today I announce an important improvement for Medicare. We will open Medicare<br />
up to the private hospital system, so that it can purchase an estimated 10,000 private<br />
hospital beds per year for people on waiting lists.<br />
We will also fund post-acute and palliative care patients in private hospitals a step<br />
which will at once increase options for palliative care and free up public beds.<br />
In addition, a new Commonwealth dental health program will be established for<br />
emergency and basic dental care for health card holders.<br />
In education, we will continue to pursue the goals of access and equity which in the<br />
last decade saw th e number of young Australians completing secondary school rise<br />
from three in ten to nearly eight in ten; the creation of an additional 120,000 university<br />
places; and, last year the establishment of an Australian National Training Authority to<br />
provide vocational training of the highest standard for all Australians.<br />
In doing this we met the challenge of the new economic order. Education is our great<br />
comparative advantage. We must keep it and build on it. </p>
<p>Thbese broad egalitarian goals create not only opportunities for all, they also create the<br />
lift that Australia must have.<br />
Not only are we raising standards, but the guarantee of fair access to education is a<br />
principle from which we will never resile.<br />
Under Labor, wealth will never determine one's chance to get a decent education.<br />
We want our universities and TAFE to remain educational institutions not private<br />
business organisations.<br />
We will not introduce a voucher system for our universities. We will not put a tax on<br />
books. We will not put a tax on knowledge.<br />
We will not cheapen the values of education, or enlightened social democracy, by<br />
making it subject to the principles of the market place.<br />
In Australia we have built one of the best and fairest social welfare systems in the<br />
world. in the next term, we will introduce new measures for unemployed people, including<br />
older men, and today I can announce further initiatives to assist other older<br />
Australians, including a more generous pensions assets test and a new seniors health<br />
card. Looking after people in need has always been Labor's strength, and it is a proud record.<br />
But we should never forget the people in the middle. Those Australians on average<br />
incomes struggling to bring up their families, pay their bills and keep their heads above<br />
water. I am referring to families whose total income is between $ 30,000 and $ 60,000 who<br />
will miss out under Dr Hewson.<br />
Who will miss out on the health care rebate, who will lose their Family Allowance,<br />
who will have their Dependent Spouse Rebate income-tested, who won't get the<br />
Coalition's child care rebate.<br />
I fail to understand why the Coalition is so down on these Australians. Dr Hewson<br />
cuts them out of his compensation package, yet they are the ones who will be most<br />
affected. Labor stands in direct contrast to the Coalition when it comes to meeting the financial<br />
needs of these people. Medicare, the award system, our child care rebate, our<br />
education system and our 1994 and 1996 tax cuts. Our policies provide for the people<br />
in the middle.<br />
A tax rate of 30 per cent, not 38 per cent as now and all without a GST. </p>
<p>For all pensioners, Labor will also introduce fringe benefits from April, giving 380,000<br />
older Australians valuable discounts on everyday services.<br />
There is one simple fact which all Australians should not forget: Dr HCwsoD intends<br />
to cut $ 9.4 billion from government spending.<br />
Almost half of this will come from social security, health, housing and labour market<br />
programs. This was the level of Dr Hewson's cuts before he delivered his revised package in<br />
December the package he funded with a proposed sale of Telecom for $ 20 billion.<br />
Yesterday it was revealed that Telecom is worth $ 8 billion less than that, which simply<br />
means Dr Hewson's plan is unaffordable.<br />
1-us principal pledge to abolish state payroll tax cannot be achieved.<br />
Business it seems is to get the booby prize. A 15 per cent GST, a 42 per cent company'<br />
tax and no payroll tax relief. And timed local phone calls into the bargain.<br />
As our success depends on the bonds between us, it depends on the strength of our<br />
culture. Labor guarantees support for those great Australian institutions which preserve the<br />
nation's heritage, encourage ideas, disseminate information and strengthen national<br />
cohesion. I mean such organisations as the ABC, the CS[ RO, the Australia Council and the<br />
Special Broadcasting Service. All on Dr Hewson's hit list. Labor will also extend the<br />
services of Radio JJJ to Australian regional areas.<br />
Our cultural life and our quality of life in Australia is uniquely determined by our<br />
environment. Whatever separates us, we have this continent in common. We share<br />
responsibility for it.<br />
tn December, Labor delivered its Environment Statement, the centrepiece of which<br />
was a major program to renew and revive our greatest river system, the<br />
Murray-Darling Basin.<br />
In Labor's next term, improving the quality of the urban environment will be a major<br />
priority of the Government. as will identifying areas of habitat important to the<br />
national estate.<br />
Labor will not be joining the liberals in their rush to uranium enrichment and<br />
engaging the nuclear fuel cycle.<br />
This Government has long spoken of the need to address the historic and continuing<br />
injustice done to Australia's indigenous people. </p>
<p>Over the years a great deal of money has been spent and a great deal of good will<br />
expended, but the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people continue to suffer the<br />
consequences of two centuries of injustice, prejudice and neglect.<br />
Any Government that I lead will be determined to complete the process of<br />
reconciliation Labor has begun, and at last return to the indigenous people of Australia<br />
the dignity, social justice, health, opportunity and living standards to which all<br />
Australians are entitled.<br />
To fail in this is to betray not just the Aboriginal people, but ourselves, all that we<br />
profess to believe, everything Australia stands for.<br />
We are determined not to fail this time.<br />
It has been Labor's consistent theme that our success as a nation depends on our ability<br />
to harness all our resources, human as well material.<br />
It depends on having faith in our institutions and confidence in ourselves and in each<br />
other.<br />
As I have said, we need only look to the last few years to find the reasons why we<br />
should have faith in ourselves. We need only look to the next few new years and the<br />
opportunities ahead to see why we should be confident.<br />
It is perhaps in part because Australians are growing in confidence that more and more<br />
of them are questioning whether it is appropriate for Australia to have as its head of<br />
state the monarch of another country.<br />
Many Australians some surveys suggest a majority believe that we will be better<br />
able to succeed in the world with the unique and unambiguous identity which an<br />
Australian head of state, chosen by the Australian people, could provide.<br />
While it is far from the most pressing matter facing the nation, it is nevertheless<br />
important that we do not let this decade leading to the centenary of the Federation pass<br />
without advancing the debate.<br />
To do this we will set up a broadly based committee of eminent Australians, including<br />
representatives of the States, to develop a discussion paper which considers the options<br />
for a Federal Republic of Australia.<br />
Any options developed by the committee would not seek to change our way of<br />
goverrnent; only to have an Australian, chosen by Australians, as Australia's head of<br />
state. I would like to extend an invitation to the Opposition to participate in the workings of<br />
this committee.<br />
It would be the intention that as a result of this committee's deliberations and the<br />
public discussion that would follow, the Australian people would be in a position to </p>
<p>decide by referendum later in the decade whether Australia should become a Republic<br />
by the year 2001.<br />
Early in the speech I said that this community was remarkable for being so strong and<br />
so cohesive.<br />
it has changed dramnatically in recent years, and no change has been more dramatic<br />
than the arrival in Banlcstown of people whose culture and experience is so very<br />
different. Bankstown has accommodated the change.<br />
And just like every other community in Australia, Bankstown is accommodating the<br />
economic change the nation is going through.<br />
Bankstown has drawn on its people, it has drawn on its community spirit, it has drawn<br />
on its sense of justice and fairness on those traditions common to all Australians to<br />
make the transformation from one world to another.<br />
We will only be strong, we will only be able to make the necessary change, and the<br />
change will only be worth making, if we keep the bonds between us strong.<br />
In the end, this is the only way we will get where we want to go. It is the only way we<br />
will solve our problems. It is the only way to avoid creating new ones.<br />
To my mind, it is because Australians know these things and for so long now have<br />
practised them that Australia is a great country, and a country with great prospects.<br />
It is because we have the wisdom both to succeed in the world and to live together in<br />
Australia. And in the end I think that is at the heart of our pride, and why we love<br />
Australia. And why we must make sure that the ties that bind us are never broken. </p>
