STATEMENT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
WILLIAM McMkHON, CH MP<br />
TRAVELLING ALLOWANCES FOR MEMBERS OF<br />
PARLIlAMENT 26 APRIL 1972<br />
In response to representations from both sides of the<br />
House, the amounts of travelling allowances paid to Members of<br />
Parliament have been reviewed.<br />
Along with his recommendations for increased salaries,<br />
Mr Justice Kerr in his report tabled in Parliamont on 8 December<br />
1971 recommended that travelling allowances payable to Membors and<br />
to ministers and office-holders be increased. The Government<br />
subsequently decided not to proceed with any of the three hills<br />
relating to increases in Parliamentary salaries and allowances.<br />
That remains the position. Travelling allowances are not covered<br />
in this legislation and can be regarded separately from salaries,<br />
electorate allowances and Ministerial allowances.<br />
The travelling allowance, or Canberra allowanqe, paid<br />
to Members of Parliament for living expenses and out-of-poqket<br />
expenses incurred in attending Parliamentary Sittings has b~ een<br />
a day since 1968. Mr Justice Kerr recommended $ 22 a day. In several<br />
areas of the Commonwealth Service in Canberra in the less Tenior<br />
grades, the travelling allowance now paid is higher than th~ e<br />
Canberra allowance paid to Members of Parliament. It has bqen put that<br />
to meet Members' increased living costs in Canberra and the increased<br />
costs of out-of-pocket expenses, the current rate of Canberra<br />
allowance should be increased. It has been decided to accqpt this<br />
view and to increase the allowance to 822 a day as recommended by<br />
Mr Justice Kerr. M~ r Justice Kerr made recommendations about the payment<br />
of Canberra allowance for Party and Committee meetings held when the<br />
Parliament is not sitting. These recommendations will be accepted.<br />
It was also recommended that the conditions of payment<br />
of travelling allowance be clarified. With this objective, a<br />
review of the conditions of payment will be undertaken.<br />
As part of his general review, Mr Justice Kerr<br />
recommended that Members of Parliament residing in the ACT should<br />
receive half the Canberra allowance. As this matter is now being<br />
treated in isolation, it has been decided that Members of Parliament / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
residing in the ACT will not receive any increase in Canberra<br />
allowance but will not have the allowance reduced. These Members<br />
will continue to receive $ 15 a day.<br />
Mr Justice Kerr recommended increased travelling<br />
allowances for Ministers and office-holders. In general, the<br />
amounts of these allowances have not changed since 1964. The<br />
allowances are paid for travel away from Canberra on official or<br />
Parliamentary business. The recommended allowances were<br />
PRIME MINISTER $ 42 A DAY<br />
SENIOR MINISTERS AND THE<br />
LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION $ 36 A DAY<br />
MINISTERS, THE PRESIDING OFFICERS,<br />
THE DEPUTY LEADER OF THE<br />
OPPOSITION AND THE LEADER OF<br />
THE OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE $ 33 A DAY<br />
DEPUTY LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION<br />
IN THE SENATE AND THE LEADER<br />
OF THE SECOND NON-GOVERNMENT<br />
PARTY IN THE SENATE $ 28 A DAY<br />
THESE RECOMMENDED AMOUNTS OF TRAVELLING ALLOWA7NCE<br />
WILL BE PAID. The current travelling allowance of $ 21 a day<br />
payable to Members of some Parliamentary Copumittees for n etings<br />
away from Canberra will be increased to $ 25 a day. Travelling<br />
expenses will be reimbursed to Assistant Ministers to a maximum<br />
of $ 25 a day. The new rates will be payable from tomorrow. </p>
