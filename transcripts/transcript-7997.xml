I.~ FOR MEDIA 29 MARCH 1990<br />
I note that the Leader of the Opposition has today conceded<br />
the defeat of the Liberal/ National Party Coalition in the<br />
Federal election and I thank Mr Peacock for that concession.<br />
Although the count of votes remains to be completed, it is<br />
obvious that the Australian Labor Party will have a clear<br />
workable majo) rity in the House of Representatives. The<br />
Labor Party therefore in a position to proceed to form a<br />
fourth Governiment.<br />
I have today informed the Governor-General accordingly and<br />
he has agreed, in those circumstances, that the caretaker<br />
period is now over.<br />
I have informied the Governor-General that I expect the party<br />
processes foj-the selection of a new Ministry to be<br />
completed by early next week in time for the formal swearing<br />
in of the Ministry on Wednesday 4 April 1990.<br />
I wish to express, as I did on election night, my deep<br />
appreciation to the people of Australia for entrusting to us<br />
the responsilhility of a fourth term in Government. It is my<br />
firm intention that this will be a Government concerned<br />
above all with the pursuit of the national interest and a<br />
government for all Australians.<br />
I repeat the pledge which I made during the election<br />
campaign that the Government will devote all its energy,<br />
creativity and determination to pursuing our vision of the<br />
sort of Australia we want in the 1990s to take us asa<br />
people into the 21st century. The Government will move<br />
quickly to begin the implementation of the new policies for<br />
a fourth term which were announced during the campaign in<br />
areas ranging from economic management and economic reform<br />
Tho social justice andi the protection of the environment.<br />
It is the commitment of myself and my colleagues that we<br />
will, from the first day of the new Government, set about<br />
undertaking the hard work needed to secure an Australian<br />
future of greater prosperity, social justice, fairness and<br />
security. </p>
