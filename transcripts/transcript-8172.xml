    <content><![CDATA[<p>00j<br />PRIME MINISTER<br />FOR MEDIA 24 OCTOBER 1990<br />In my Statement on the Environment of July 1989, I<br />foreshadowed an inquiry by the Resource Assessment<br />Commission ( RAC) into the use of coastal zone resources.<br />The coastal zone presents some of the most complex<br />natural resource management issues facing all levels of<br />government in Australia. Over the next few years our<br />success or failure in achieving sustainable development<br />and conservation in the coastal zone will have a major<br />and lasting impact on the quality of life of present and<br />future generations.<br />Because of the range of issues involved, it is not<br />possible for the RAC to cover them adequately in a single<br />inquiry. The first reference will therefore deal with<br />the Building, Tourism and Associated Development aspects<br />of the use of coastal zone resources. I have written to<br />the Premiers and Chief Ministers seeking the involvement<br />of the States and Territories in the development of the<br />terms of reference for this inquiry. Industry, union and<br />community groups are also being invited to participate in<br />the broad-ranging process of consultation, before the<br />terms of reference are formally settled.<br />Because of the complexity of the issues, and the need to<br />take account of work already done, or in hand, over the<br />next few months officials from my Department and the RAC<br />will be discussing the proposed terms of reference with<br />State and Territory representatives and with other<br />interested organisations. These consultations will<br />encompass key issues, the information sources, research<br />needs, timing and other arrangements for the proposed<br />inquiry. On the basis of that information the Government<br />will finalise the Terms of Reference and appoint Special<br />Commissioners. The inquiry is expected to start early<br />next year.<br />2668</p>
