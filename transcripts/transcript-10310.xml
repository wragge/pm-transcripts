21 April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW<br />
OLD PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
PRIME MINISTER:~<br />
Well, good morning.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible) it's not looking very good for the Senate,... ( inaudible).., the handling of<br />
the affairs, the government seems to be comning up with legal advice to stop it from<br />
looking into Colston matter?<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
No. JOURNALIST:<br />
Why not?<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
This Government has allowed this matter, in fact this Government has sent this matter<br />
off to the police. We behaved differently from Gareth Evans~ and Kim Beazley 13<br />
years ago who deliberately ignored the advice available to them from the bead of the<br />
Attorney General's Department to send this matter off to the police. The only thing<br />
that we are arguing with the Opposition about is whether a Senate Privileges<br />
investigation should be allowed to occur while the police investigation is going on.<br />
Now we have been told by Henry Burmester who is the Chief General Counsel that<br />
such a course of action could prejudice the police investigation and I agree with what<br />

Robert Hill said on radio this morning, let's get the police investigation out of the way<br />
and if after that the Senate believes that there are matters which should be looked at by<br />
the Senate, then let that occur. So it seems to me to be an open-shut case. What the<br />
Labor Party is advocating is a course of action that might provide a technical let out at<br />
the end of the day and I think that's stupid.<br />
JOURNALIST: But the police investigation could take nine months or so, which leaves Senator<br />
Colston still there..., still able to vote on federal legislation.<br />
PRIE MINISTER:-<br />
Well, I've made it clear that we won't accept his vote.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PRIM[ E MINISTER:<br />
I'm not disputing the rights of the Senate. I am supporting the proper procedures and<br />
we've been given legal advice by somebody who is the Governent's Chief General<br />
Counsel and surely people who want this thing dealt with properly don't want a<br />
situation to arise where somebody who might be charged, and I stress might be<br />
charged, with an offence can argue that his case has been prejudiced by a Senate<br />
investigation. That would be a very perverse result. It seems to me that you have the<br />
right course of action, the best of all worlds if you let the police investigation proceed<br />
and when that's been disposed of, then if the Senate believes some other matter should<br />
be looked at, then the Senate can look at it. Now that's the advice of the Chief<br />
General Counsel. It's the advice of the director of Public Prosecutions. We are the<br />
people who sent this to the police. Evans and Beazley refuised to send it to the police.<br />
Evans and Beazley covered up. Evans and Beazley ignored the advice of the head of<br />
the Attorney Generals' Department. Evans and JBeazley decided that a little private<br />
counselling to a young mistake maker, as they described it, was preferable to sending it<br />
to the police. They are the last men on earth who can lecture us about proper handling<br />
of this issue, the last men on Earth.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Prime Minister on Wik, you are meeting aboriginal leaders later today, do you believe<br />
you ( inaudible).., negotiated outcome?<br />
PRDM MINISTER:<br />
Well I hope so but I don't know yet. I have, as you know, invested an enormous<br />
amount of time and effort into this issue. I want an outcome that respects Native Title<br />
but delivers certainty to farmers.<br />
Fax from </p>
<p>Faoxm 21/ 04/ 97 17: 26 Pg: 3<br />
JOURNALIST: So are you any closer to that then?<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Well I2w ill be able to answer that probably more fuldsomely later on today after I've met<br />
the leaders of the Aboriginal community again. There's a working group discussing<br />
the issue at the moment. I meet them at 12 o'clock today and I am prepared to make<br />
availale plenty of hours of my time this afternoon to try and reach a settlement and<br />
the important thing is really to try and reach a settlement that delivers on those two<br />
things. That is, we respect Native Title. I've said that all along but we must deliver<br />
certainty to farmers. We must accept that they were told in 1993 that they had<br />
certainty. They now find they don't have certainty and we have to have an outcome<br />
that delivers on those two things.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible).., does the National Party decision announced ( inaudible)...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I'm not conscious that the National Party has taken any separate decision. The<br />
National Party doesn't take separate decisions on these things any more than the<br />
Liberal Party does. I am putting forward a Government position and the Government<br />
position I outlined to the Cabinet last week and the Cabinet gave general endorsement<br />
to that position including the members of the National Party. There's no such thing as<br />
a separate National Party position any more than there is a separate Liberal Party<br />
position. But I know my National Party colleagues well. They are representing their<br />
constituents with vigour and energy and I congratulate them for that and so are a lot of<br />
rural liberals and they have good will, they want to respect Native Title, but they also<br />
want security for their farmers and so do I, and I just repeat again, I'm not going to<br />
allow that insecurity to continue and what I am trying to do very hard is to have a<br />
compromise which delivers on those two key elements and what I've put forward does<br />
that. What I've put forward does not involve blanket extinguishment, it doesn't. I<br />
wouldn't be putting it forward if it did, because I know that that would be<br />
unacceptable, but it does deliver security to farmers. So I believe the niodel that I am<br />
seeking agreement to fulfils the proper goals of the two parties and I think it is a fair<br />
proposal, it is a reasonable proposal and it is an honourable proposal which all<br />
Australians I believe can support because it respects Native Title, it respects the Mabo<br />
decision, it doesn't involve a blanket extinguishment of Native Title and I hope that the<br />
Aboriginal leadership canl accept it because it is a very fair proposal.<br />
JOURNALIST-. What was your reaction to the threats of trade sanctions?<br />

PRIME Look I'll let them go through to the wicket keeper at this stage?<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you believe that was just public posturing<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look I don't intend to comment. I mean, the important thing is to get a sensible<br />
outcome, not sort of conduct a running exchange of rhetoric on the past to that<br />
outcome. Nothing is achieved by some of the running loose rhetoric that has in a sense<br />
come from both sides on this issue. I'm working hard to get a fair outcome for<br />
Australia. I'm working hard to do the right thing by the Aborigines, but I'm also<br />
working hard to give to the farmers of Australia the security they believe they had in<br />
1993, the security they were told by some of their leadership they had, the security<br />
they were told by Paul Keating they had, and the security they were told by the<br />
preamble of the Native Title Act they had. One moire, two more questions.<br />
JOURNALIST: The indigenous leader are saying you've got a 10 point plan.. inaudible<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We are meeting at twelve o'clock.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister just on the Colston matter, what would you say to Senator Colston<br />
now, it7 s been at least two weeks since you asked the Senator to stand down<br />
. inaudible. and he won't even speak to the Senate President?<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Well, my position is that he should stand down as Deputy President and if he hasn't<br />
done so by the time the Senate meets, I have no doubt he'll be voted out of that<br />
position. That's what I said the night I had my 9.00pm news conference announcing<br />
that this matter was going off to the police, and my position hasn't changed. And this<br />
is the last question.<br />
JOURNALIST: When the Government won't accept Senator Colston's vote in .( inaudible)<br />

<p>Faoxm 21/ 04/ 97 17: 26 Pg: S<br />
PRVM MINISTER:<br />
Well that's a matter you'll have to pursue with him. Look we don't have any power to<br />
expel him from the Senate. I can't make him go. That's a matter for the law and for<br />
the people of Queensland. I mean do you really want a situation where the<br />
government of the day can use its numbers to throw anybody they like out parliament.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
No but I'm asking....<br />
PRIME AMSTER:<br />
Well,. I've answered your question. The question of whether he comes or goes is a<br />
matter for him, a matter for the law and a matter for the operation of the Constitution<br />
and the attitude of the people. Now, it is people who elect members of parliament and<br />
if in due time he is found to be ineligible well he will go then. I don't think it is for me<br />
to say, to put myself in his shoes. You ought to go and ask him, you ought to get him<br />
to have a news conference and ask him.<br />
JOURNALIST: We have...<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Well, I know, do that. But I can't answer for him. That's a matter for him. I mean, I<br />
have done all I can do. I've said we won't accept his vote, I unlike Beazley and Evans,<br />
I sent this thing to the police, unlike Beazley and Evans who sat on it and ignored the<br />
advice of Pat Brazil, the head of the Attorney-Generals department to send it to the<br />
police. I haven't done that. At all times I have behaved properly and quickly and<br />
speedily. The thing was going to be considered for dispatch to the police before Mrs<br />
Smith made her statement. This crazy idea that until she made her second statement<br />
we in some way were obstructing the thing going to the police is wrong. All we said<br />
was that on legal advice again we should wait until the administrative services<br />
department had got the whole thing together and then had a look at it as a whole to<br />
decide whether it ought to go to the police. Now obviously the second statement by<br />
Mrs Smith changed that but I have sent it to the police, I've behaved properly.<br />
Heazley and Evans buried it. They buried it for thirteen years, they allowed their party<br />
to re-endorse him, they got together with the Democrats to break a convention and<br />
elect him as Deputy President in 1991 over the nominee of the Coalition parties and<br />
now they've got the gall to lecture us about what we ought to be doing. I mean we<br />
have done everything that could have been done, everything. We don't have power to<br />
expel him. The only people who can expel him are the people, because the people<br />
elected him. The Labor Party took the power of expulsion away in 1987, there's only<br />
been one person to my recollection expelled from the Parliament by a vote of the<br />
Parliament since federation and that was the Labor member for Kalgoorlie in 1920 and<br />
he was expelled in circumstances that involved a very vicious sectarian fight at the<br />
height of the anglo-Irish dispute over Irish home rule and so it was a very interesting<br />
Fax from </p>
<p>saga, and it's only happened once. Now I think the Labor Party's track record on this<br />
is grubby, it is hypocritical, they could have done something 13 years ago. When<br />
Kevin Newman as a Fraser Government Minister got allegations, he wanted to send it<br />
to the police and he was advised not to. Evans and Beazley were advised to send it to<br />
the police and they decided not to. That's the difference.<br />
Thank you.<br />
