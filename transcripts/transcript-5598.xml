FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 31 MAY, 1981<br />
ADDRESS TO NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DRAMATIC ARTS<br />
DINNER, SYDNEY<br />
This I think is the unfairest night of all. How can a rank<br />
amateur be asked possibly to get up and address you. You have<br />
had all the advantages. You have been through that terrible<br />
place with all those frightful facilities, and you are all<br />
professionals. But I am just the amateur; an amateur from the<br />
country, from the bush. To have to speak in front of those<br />
who really know how Tamie suggested that I get a few quick<br />
lessons from Kate at dinner. I thought that I have got too<br />
set in my ways and that I needed more than a few quick lessons<br />
at dinner.<br />
When I saw that film, it reminded me rather of our Party Room.<br />
That is that they were crowded in together, because we use our<br />
Party Room for all sorts of purposes too. But then a year or<br />
so ago the Parliament decided that it should get a new Party<br />
Room and they were going to have a new building for that, so I<br />
suppose it would-be rather unfair to insist that you continue<br />
to use your old one.<br />
That film, I think, takes an enormous risk; the one we have<br />
just seen. It was done by the A. B. C. and they are very expert<br />
and very professional. I just wonder whether they had some<br />
subterranean reasons: did they really think that this was going<br />
to help NIDA get that extra money or did they really think that<br />
as a result of that film, the Government would take the money<br />
away from NIDA and give it to the because they made it<br />
quite plain that in those awful, terrible facilities which are<br />
beyond belief, with no equipment whatsoever, but you have done<br />
all these wonderful things and produced all these great films and<br />
great artists. Now, how you could ever justify a new building;<br />
I just want it written down, I just want those cast-iron guarantees<br />
for the 10 and 20 years ahead after this new building is completed.<br />
How are you going to give me those guarantees so that we know that<br />
you will take Australia's reputation that much higher than it is<br />
right at this very time. That I suppose is going to be a challenge<br />
for those in charge of the school, those who will go through it,<br />
those who will be producing our plays and writing our plays and<br />
producing Australia's films.<br />
There is a bit of a sore point about films right at this moment.<br />
If I could tell you how it all began. ]' efore the last election I<br />
wasr being made up for one of tho-se terrible commercials that<br />
politicians try to do but which they never should. We had not<br />
finalised the policy speech for the last electi. on at this time.<br />
JThio girl who was making me up had done it on a number of occasions<br />
and always at election times because she had always been successful.<br />
That is the way you Xwin elections; you have the right make-up. </p>
<p>2<br />
But I just said, how is she going and what was happening.<br />
She said ' no good at all'. ' Why not'? Because she had just<br />
had 16 films cancelled. I think she used to contract doing<br />
her make-up work to'fihns and whatever. John Howard, in his<br />
keenness to stop all those terrible tax-avoiding cheats, had<br />
caught up with scheme which had been used quite successfully to<br />
fund Australian films. I thought, well that is no good, I had<br />
better really find out what the score is because we want<br />
Australia's films to go on being made, with a high reputation<br />
right around the world. Then, Bob Ellicott, as a result of that,<br />
proposed policies which we adopt. Then everyone advised us that<br />
there were going to be people who will do things that they<br />
should not and that that would discredit the scheme. As a result,<br />
some modifications were made, and as a result of that there are<br />
some people in trouble; and as a result of that John Howard has<br />
had discussions over this last weekend. As a result of that we<br />
will have another discussion tomorrow morning or on Tuesday morniAg.<br />
There is no promise in that except the consciousness of a problem,<br />
and also a very firm desire to make sure that the professionals<br />
in this room are to be able to go on doing great things for<br />
themselves, but for Australia also.<br />
I do not really know what to say about the Razor Gang, because<br />
before I came along here tonight, I said " what am I allowed to<br />
say about NIDA". We promised $ 3 million but we did not specifically<br />
say when we were going to give the money. We could keep that<br />
promiise after the election in the year 2001 or something or other.<br />
But Wal Fife has told me that you would not be able to start<br />
building under two or three or four months anyway. He assured me<br />
he believes that he can have all the necessary support<br />
aVv ailab le to enable you to start building when you want to start<br />
building. I put it that way because John Howard rather frightens<br />
me, but I am sure he does not frighten Wal Fife, so he would<br />
expect the funds.<br />
There is one other thincg which I have discussed with both Ministers<br />
concerned, and that does involve the future recurrent funding<br />
for the school, for NIDA. Some sort of compromise I think has<br />
been reached. I will give you the good news first and the bad news<br />
after. The specific responsibility of NIDA will be transferred<br />
to Home Affairs and the Environment, where I think it ought to be.<br />
Theiib ad news is that unofficially and informally the Tertiary<br />
Education Cominission will still be asked to give advice on the level<br />
of recurrent funding. That does not necessarily mean that advice<br />
w. ill be fo. lowd, but it does mean it will be sought. If you can<br />
co0 on co-opera ing with the ABC to produce films like the one you<br />
just did, I suppose you will not have any trouble with the Tertiary<br />
Eciucation Comrnui. ssion either..<br />
There is only one other thing " that I would like to say. I suppose<br />
in many ways my Government over the years has got the name or I<br />
hope it has for trying to run the economy better. But that is<br />
not an end in itself. It is only the start. We try and run an<br />
economy betL.. r so people can look after their own affairs; so<br />
that the company you have asked along here tonight can rake profits<br />
and there coniiribute to that miillion-dollar appeal. do not think<br />
lthcy will. cont-ribute very much if they are not making proLfii-s. They<br />
mni. giht, but they would be strange sorts of companies I think if they<br />
r. idC. But a. lso so thati the nation will have resources to do the thing.<br />
tlhat: it needs to do and wants to do wvell and more effec: tively than<br />
: it otherwise could; and supporting the National InsLi. lute of / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Dramatic Arts, supporting the Australian " iBallet, the Australian<br />
Opera, supporting the arts in general. terms through the Australia<br />
Council, and so many other things which Australians can do well<br />
whether it is medical research or marine science or whatever.<br />
Without resources, without managing an economy well, we are not<br />
going to be able to do any of these things. Doing that, is just<br />
the first thing, but the end result is so that we can all build<br />
a better Australia, but more particularly so that Australians<br />
with talents, with energies, with initiative, with imagination'<br />
and heart can go about doinfg the things they. want to, to create--<br />
a better society and to provide some fulfillment to themselves<br />
and to give enjoyment to their fellow Australians.<br />
That, in my unprofessional and amateurish way, is perhaps my<br />
understanding of what your profession is about. It gives great<br />
* pleasure to many tens of thousands of people. But it also gives<br />
pride; pride in what Australians can perform in a way which is<br />
recognised around the world as of world quality and better than<br />
most. Good fortune to all of you. 000---</p>
