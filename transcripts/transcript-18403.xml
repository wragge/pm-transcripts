    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM: I'm on my way to a plane so I've only got time to make a short statement, and then I'll take questions at a media event later today.</p>
<p>The choice that my colleagues will make on Monday is about who should be Prime Minister of this nation. It is a choice about who's got the strength, the temperament, the character, the courage to lead this nation. Who's got the ability to get things done even in the face of] adversity. This is not an episode of Celebrity Big Brother, this is about who should be Prime Minister.</p>
<p>As Prime Minister, I have got big reforms done that languished under my predecessor. These big reforms include putting a price on carbon and seizing a clean energy future, health reform, the minerals resource rent tax, making sure that our telecommunications system was ready for the 21stcentury. As Prime Minister, I have got the hard things done, and as Prime Minister after Monday I would intend to do that.</p>
<p>I've been speaking to a large number of my colleagues over the last day, and when I've spoken to them they are going to come to Monday's caucus meeting exercising their best judgment about who should be Prime Minister and who should lead this nation for the future. Pre-selections should not come into this. This should be about people coming to Monday's caucus meeting making the determination as to who's got the strength and ability to do the job of leading this nation.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
