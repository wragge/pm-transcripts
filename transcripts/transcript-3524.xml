JAUSTRALIA~ g Press Statement No. 396<br />
December 1974<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR BRISBANE FLOOD MITIGATION<br />
WORKS<br />
The Australian Government has approved up to<br />
$ 1 million for the first stage of a flood mitigation<br />
measures program in Brisbane this financial year.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam announced this is Canberra<br />
today. Assistance of $ 800,000 will be provided for works<br />
on the Enoggera/ Breakfast Creek, and $ 200,000 for<br />
assistance towards an early warning program and flood<br />
mitigation and evacuation measures on the Brisbane Creek.<br />
The Enoggera/ Breakfast Creek works will involve<br />
the first stage of the reconstruction of the Enoggera<br />
Dam and associated dredging works for the lower reaches<br />
of the Breakfast Creek.<br />
" If we are to protect people in future from<br />
floods of the kind Brisbane has suffered in the past<br />
couple of summers, we must take a comprehensive approach<br />
to the problem," Mr Whitlam said.<br />
" This must include an examination of land use<br />
controls, of flood monitoring and of evacuation<br />
techniques and equipment, as well as physical works on<br />
dams and drainage.<br />
" The Brisbane flood disasters of 1972 and 1974<br />
showed that the city lacks an adequate system of flood<br />
plain management. " As I said in Brisbane on 21 November, we have<br />
made repeated requests at official level to the<br />
Queensland Government to furnish firm works proposals<br />
on which we could base decisions regarding further<br />
mitigation projects.<br />
" This is why it is possible to go ahead with<br />
only the Enoggera/ Breakfast Creek works at this stage.<br />
It also explains why no other major works can be<br />
announced at this stage, and particularly why no major<br />
physical works can be carried out before the coming<br />
wet season." </p>
