The Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr E. G. Whitlam,<br />
has sent the following messages to President Nixon and Mrs Truman on the death<br />
of the former President:-<br />
Message to President Nixon<br />
The Government and people of Australia join with those the world<br />
over who deeply regret the passing of a very great President and a most<br />
distinguished American.<br />
President Truman assumed office in times of unparallelled complexity<br />
and difficulty and was faced during his Presidency with a number of decisions<br />
that profoundly affected the future and the well-being of mankind.<br />
SHis inauguration of the Marshall Plan, which rebuilt Europe, stands<br />
as one of the geatest and most generous acts of statesmanship of modern<br />
times. Under his guidance the United States steadily assumed her post-war<br />
Srole as leader of the Western democracies.<br />
The sympathy and condolences of all Australians go out to the late<br />
President's widow and family in their bereavement.<br />
Message to Mrs Truman<br />
Please accept the deepest sympathy of my Government and of the<br />
people of Australia on the passing of your distinguished husband.<br />
President Truman has rightly earned a lasting place in history for<br />
the great role of leadership he played during a most critical period in<br />
world affairs. We share the grief and sorrow that you and your family are<br />
experiencing at this time. </p>
