<p>[Tape starts]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh fairly moving. A very emotional function. A wonderful tribute to</p>
<p> a wonderful person. Betty Cuthbert is in every way the golden girl</p>
<p> and Australians feel for her and the support evidence today is just</p>
<p> a demonstration of just how she's touched the emotions of sports</p>
<p> lovers all around Australia. She really is the ultimate example of</p>
<p> what the Olympic ideal should be. That is superb sportsmanship, great</p>
<p> talent, and courage and tenacity in the face of human adversity, that's</p>
<p> what the Olympic ideal is really all about and she is a magnificent</p>
<p> reminder of it.</p>
<p>JOUNRALIST:</p>
<p>Premier Kennett has said today that the Victorian Government will</p>
<p> put up half the money for the Geelong road. They'll fix half</p>
<p> of it and if you don't put up the rent we'll put up a sign</p>
<p> saying: the rest of the road's down to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Colourful Jeff, you can't beat him. Anyway we'll consider</p>
<p> it. We'll consider it. I had a pleasant chat with him on the</p>
<p> subject the other day, but we have a lot of requests and we'll</p>
<p> consider it along all the other requests. We make these decisions</p>
<p> in the interests of all Australians wherever they may live.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, John Brumby is holding a press conference and is expected</p>
<p> to resign as Victoria's Labor leader.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I wouldn't worry about the Labor Party down here. The State's</p>
<p> in the very best of hands.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, on the Olympics there's been photographic evidence</p>
<p> that Mr Coles now may have been in receipt of jewellery. Does that</p>
<p> harden your personal position against Mr Coles and whether he should</p>
<p> remain on SOCOG?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's not for me to start saying who should or shouldn't</p>
<p> stay in positions that are not within my gift. The Prime Minister</p>
<p> of the country can't run around making ex cathedra announcements</p>
<p> on this or that occupancy. People will make their own minds up about</p>
<p> this whole thing. There's no doubt in the world it has done the</p>
<p> perceptions of the administration of Olympic sport both here and overseas</p>
<p> a lot of damage. But it doesn't alter the fact that the games</p>
<p> will be a huge success because Australians are interested in athletes,</p>
<p> they're interested in Australian sporting victories, they're</p>
<p> interested in the Olympic ideal, but I don't care to say anymore</p>
<p> than that.</p>
