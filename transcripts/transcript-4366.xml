PRIME MINISTER<br />
P'OR PRESS 15 APRIL 1977<br />
ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF NAURU) HOUSE, MFJ. BOUWJ'JE<br />
it is a great pleasure for me to be here this evening,<br />
to share with you t-his very happy occasion. I shotild like to<br />
thank you, Mx President, and your piedecessor, Mr Hanmer<br />
De Robur-t, for honouring me w. ith your invitation to join you<br />
and our friends -from the South Pacific at this ceremony-<br />
This is in every sense an im~ portant and historic moment for<br />
Nauru. It marks the bringing to fruition of a ma-jor<br />
overseas investment project'by Naaru anid create-, in Melbourne<br />
a most impressive symbol. of tha t country. But Nauru House is<br />
more than just a symrbol. it is an eXpre ion of Nauru's<br />
faith in the future. It is a tang ibleA ffirmation of the hopes<br />
and aspirations of the Nauruan people-and of their determination<br />
to provide an assured futuxe for th~' ir coming gEnerations.<br />
iis a project in which all who have pa. rtfipaedcnfe<br />
strong and well eax-ned sense of pxid.<br />
M, 1r President, your Minister of Finance, ~ Ki nza Clodum r,<br />
spoke recently in the Nauruan Parlizment of Nauru House as<br />
symbolising both the unity and strength of the Nauruan people and<br />
the strengthening of the ties of friendship between our two<br />
countries. He stressed the Nauru Goveximentts view tha. t<br />
it was f itting and proper that this b-ailding should be erected<br />
in the City of Melbourne. I agree entirely with the<br />
sentiments expressed by your Minister. There is a special<br />
relationship between Nauru and Australia. it is a relationship<br />
based on long-standing close links of friendship and joint<br />
endeavour1 a relationship, which I am confident will long-endare.<br />
. I am not simply speaking of contact at Government level.<br />
Ouir relationship is firmly under-pinned by the many persconal<br />
friendships which exist between Nauruans and Australians.<br />
The City of Melbourne occupies a special -place in the heaxts of<br />
Nauruans, a feeling which is reciprocated by the citizens of<br />
This building, flo) W the tallest in Melbourne, will provide a<br />
constant and highly visible remainder of. those bonds of friendshLip.<br />
It is significant that with us this evening are the<br />
distinguished HeAds of Government and other senior representatives<br />
of the inerr: ber countries of the South Pacific Fo-rm. As the<br />
regional political organisation, the Forum brings together all </p>
<p>2.<br />
the independent and self-governing states of-the South Pacific.<br />
The presence here this evening of our friends from all<br />
corners of the South Pacific testifies not only to the<br />
warmth and esteem in which Nauru is held by its Forum<br />
partners, but also to the strength of Forum solidarity.<br />
Also with us are th6 Secretary General of the South Pacific<br />
Commission and the Director of the South Pacific Bureau<br />
for Economic Cooperation. Both. these organisations, of which<br />
we are all members, are playing a crucial role in the progress<br />
and development of the region.<br />
In the near future, several of the self-governing states of<br />
the South Pacific are to achieve independence, considerably<br />
swelling the ranks of South Pacific. independent nations.<br />
Australia welcomes the gathering pace of constitutional change<br />
in the South Pacific.<br />
The region is of high importance to Australia and we are<br />
determined to live up to our responsibilities towards the countries<br />
of the region. The South Pacific is rapidly becoming<br />
an increasingly important region of the world, and the<br />
major powers are showing a greater awareness of it.<br />
Similarly, the South Pacific nations are establishing links with<br />
countries outside the region and with such international organisatioN<br />
as the United Nations, its agencies and the European community.<br />
This is to . be welcomed, ad highlights the need for regional<br />
cooperation in order to safeguard and to project South Pacific<br />
viewpoints and perceptions. The Australian Government will<br />
continue its efforts to sustain and extend its relations with<br />
the countries of the South Pacific, both bilaterally and<br />
through such regional organisations as the South Pacific Forum,<br />
the South Pacific Commission and the South Pacific Bureau for<br />
Economic Cooperation.<br />
Nauru is'an active members of these regional bodies. Through its<br />
activities in the organisations, and through its wide network<br />
of shippingend aviation services, it is playing a<br />
constructive role that far outweighs its size.<br />
It is then, because of the close links which Nauru has with this<br />
city, and this country, that the opening of this striking building<br />
has a special significance. Australians and Melburnians in<br />
particular, are grateful for and honoured by the trust that<br />
Nauru and the Nauruan people have shown in us. I-am especially<br />
pleased to welcome President Dowiyogo to Australia on this occasion.<br />
It is appropriate that his first visit to Australia as President<br />
of the. Republic of Nauru should be in connection with this<br />
visible expression of Nauruan enterprise and foresight.<br />
I have great pleasure in declaring open Nauru House.<br />
