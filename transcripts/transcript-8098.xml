PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF UNEDITED INTERVIEW WITH IAN MCMINN, RADIO<br />
3AW, 22 AUGUST 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
McMINN: Prime Minister, thank you for joining me from<br />
Canberra. Last night's Budget seems to be between two<br />
distinct areas and that is in terms of the popular Press,<br />
Paul Keating being regaled for pinching pensioners and<br />
yet from the Australian Financial Review, if you like, it<br />
doesn't go far enough.<br />
PM: Well that's been a lot of the reaction. Either you<br />
wimped it or we've been too tough and that's reflected of<br />
course, in the media release of John Hewson which he put<br />
out last night. It was an economic statement that<br />
Peacock would've been ashamed of I must say. He started<br />
of f on the first page by attacking us for further cuts in<br />
living standards and then spent the rest of it saying we<br />
should've cut further. Now let me make the point, Ian,<br />
in regard to those who say we should've been tougher.<br />
There is no point in just being hairy chested for the<br />
sake of saying look how many hairs I've got on my chest.<br />
The point of good government and good economic decision<br />
making is to exercise that degree of restraint which is<br />
necessary to address the problems of inflation and your<br />
current account deficit but without allowing the economy<br />
to dive into recession. I believe that we've walked that<br />
fairly difficult, tight path effectively.<br />
McMINN: Well what do you make of the criticism that it's<br />
half a Budget? There seems to be a fair bit put off in<br />
it. PM: I've been quite open with the Australian public<br />
about that. We've had a situation where we have<br />
initiated more micro economic reform than has ever been<br />
done in this country before and a lot of that is still<br />
continuing. For instance, Bob Collins, the relevant<br />
Minister, is accelerating work in the waterfront area.<br />
But in two respects, that is in regard to Telecom and<br />
telecommunications and the question of the airlines, we<br />
require a decision of our conference, of our Party, to<br />
enable us to make changes in that area. I've quite<br />
openly said to the people of Australia, well until we've<br />
done that we can't properly incorporate something into<br />
the Budget on the assumption that we would get the.<br />
authority of the Party. Now what we'll be doing is<br />
having that conference next month and I'm confident that </p>
<p>we'll get a sensible decision from the Party and then<br />
before the end of this year we'll be making decisions<br />
that will accelerate that process of reform.<br />
McMINN: There seems to be a lot of assumptions though,<br />
Prime Minister. One of the assumptions, of course, is<br />
oil and the Gulf crisis. I mean to what degree can there<br />
be any guarantees that the figures that you're suggesting<br />
that is the basis of the Budget will actually be<br />
sustainable. PM: All we can do in a situation like that, Ian, is to<br />
make the best sort of assumptions using the best advice<br />
available to us in regard to oil and on that basis we've<br />
used a figure of $ 23.00 that's US dollars a barrel.<br />
Just let me make a couple of points to your listeners<br />
that I made in the Parliament yesterday and add something<br />
to it. The first statistical point to understand is that<br />
the loss of oil from Iraq and Kuwait is about 4 million<br />
barrels per day. Now fortunately, in a sense, this<br />
crisis arose at a time when world oil stocks were at<br />
about their highest level ever and in that situation it<br />
is assessed that we could de-stock at the rate of about<br />
one billion barrels per day relatively comfortably and<br />
that would leave about 3 million barrels a day to be made<br />
up by increased production from within the OPEC<br />
countries. There's a fair bit of evidence that the other<br />
oil producers are not only prepared but want to do that<br />
McMINN: The Saudi's.<br />
PM: Well there's not only the Saudi's, they are<br />
certainly going to do it but others as well. Now if that<br />
shortfall in production is made up, as it well could be,<br />
then there is no reason to expect a continuing high<br />
figure, it's very volatile, it was $ 20.00 a barrel before<br />
the crisis. It shot up at one point to 30 but it's back<br />
to about the mid 20' s and the $ 23.00 which we've used as<br />
an average for 90-91 is consistent with prices staying<br />
high for a while now and then falling back in the second<br />
half of this financial year. What we've got to<br />
understand is that the world is certainly less dependent<br />
on oil today than it was 10 years ago. We haven't got<br />
the same sort of parameters of crisis that existed then<br />
but 10 years ago, Ian, the oil accounted for 5-1/ 2% of<br />
the GDP of all the OECD and today it's The world<br />
has become much more flexible today than it was 10 years<br />
ago. It's digested the impact of the two oil shocks of<br />
the ' 70' s and there's an ability to move to oil<br />
substitutes in production. So all those reasons are<br />
behind the figuring of the $ 23.00 per barrel.<br />
McMINN: Are you concerned at all in the ACTU the<br />
President position you occupied for some time? The<br />
President, Mr Ferguson, turns around and says that the<br />
union movement will not accept any moves to discount<br />
wages if oil continues to rise. </p>
<p>PM: I noticed Martin's general reaction to the Budget<br />
last night and I thought it was very positive and<br />
constructive. Let me say this, that we're now in our<br />
eighth year of government and I don't know how many times<br />
the prophets have and predicted the death of the<br />
accord. Now the accord has been a very, very flexible<br />
instrument and there has been a great deal of<br />
responsibility on the part of the trade union movement<br />
and flexibility on the part of the Government to deal<br />
with changing circumstances. Now I think that the most<br />
likely situation is that the predictions that we've made<br />
and on which the Budget is based will be brought out and<br />
therefore the existing arrangements will not need any<br />
reconsideration. McMINNf Well what do you say when you hear or read<br />
headlines saying the elderly, the sick and the unemployed<br />
will bear the brunt of Paul Keating's hold the line<br />
Budget?<br />
0 PM: Well you're in Melbourne, I come from Melbourne, I<br />
remember the vicious and unfounded campaign that was<br />
particularly run by the Melbourne Press and<br />
particularly the Melbourne Herald at the time of the<br />
assets test. As I've said looking back to that, you<br />
would've believed that it was the end of civilisation as<br />
we know it. Now it was unfounded and unfair, that<br />
campaign, just as it would be to try and mount any such<br />
campaign here. Let's look at the two elements of the<br />
Budget which affect pensioners. The first in regard to<br />
pharmaceutical scripts. Perhaps the most single<br />
important statistic in the Budget speech of Paul<br />
Keating's last night was his reference to the fact that<br />
it took almost 40 years from 1948 to 1985 almost<br />
years for the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme<br />
to rise to 40 years to get to It then only<br />
took another 4 years for it to rise by another<br />
This country would've been faced with the disintegration<br />
9 of a scheme of protection for those most in need in this<br />
country if we hadn't taken some action to try and contain<br />
these costs. Now we've done that it two ways, not just<br />
by dealing with the question of pensioners scripts and so<br />
on but also with the restructuring of the pharmaceutical<br />
industry. But as far as pensioners are concerned, the<br />
simple fact is that no pensioner will be worse off<br />
because the question of the $ 2.50 per script up to<br />
$ 130.00 and then it cuts out, it's free, will be<br />
compensated exactly by the $ 2.50 a week increase in the<br />
pension rate. Now it's quite clear therefore that this<br />
is an important and absolutely necessary structure of<br />
reform but which is not being implemented at the expense<br />
of the pensioner. Now the other decision which affects<br />
pensioners of course is deeming. Now the fact is, Ian,<br />
as I think you'll appreciate is that under the system<br />
that existed until last night, the pensioners of this<br />
country were simply subsidising the banks. They were<br />
putting millions and millions of dollars into very, very<br />
low interest bearing accounts, 3 to and the banks </p>
<p>lending it at 18%. 1 mean that was just a straight<br />
subsidy by the elderly of the banking system and through<br />
the banking system of others.<br />
McMINN: Well presumably they were trying to minimise the<br />
amount of money they made.<br />
PM: No, no. It was so that they would be able to retain<br />
the benefit card. Now no pensioner will lose those cards<br />
but under this system over the longer term there will<br />
obviously be savings but not at the expense of pensioners<br />
because what they can do is invest their money at the<br />
higher amount and if they do that then as the statistics<br />
in the Budget showed last night, many of them will be<br />
better of f than as it is now. What they are doing is<br />
simply subsidising the banks. Now* I concede that this<br />
will be somewhat bewildering for some pensioners-<br />
McMINN: Very confusing I would've thought.<br />
0PM: and so we're spending money. We're spending<br />
money to increase the resources within the Social<br />
Security Department to give financial counselling<br />
services to our elderly citizens so that they will know<br />
exactly what they need to do so that they'll be<br />
protected. McMINN: But they've reached the end of their working<br />
life, Prime Minister. They would be confused, they'd be<br />
upset. All of a sudden the rules have changed again.<br />
PM: Yes, well the logic of what you're saying is that if<br />
something is not operating properly, is operating against<br />
the interests of the community and against the interests<br />
of the pensioners themselves, you don't change it because<br />
there may be confusion. I mean if government didn't act<br />
because there would be either confusion or<br />
misrepresentation about their decisions, we'd be back in<br />
the cave. We would never progress. You can't, if you're<br />
going to be a responsible government, decline to make<br />
decisions on the basis that there may be either<br />
misunderstanding or criticism. I mean, as I say, if you<br />
acted on that basis you would never do anything.<br />
McMINN: Prime Minister, Paul Keating made much of last<br />
night saying that it's a championship fight, you can't do<br />
it in one round. But I'd put it to you that the<br />
Australian public has had round after round after round<br />
of saying we'll hold the line, we'll be OK. I mean at<br />
what point does the Australian public turn around a say<br />
well we've had enough?<br />
PM: Well let's look at round after round. Round after<br />
round of economic decision making by this Government.<br />
What fundamentally single most important statistic<br />
emerges, it's this, that we've created 1.6 million jobs<br />
which is a rate of job creation more than twice as fast<br />
as the rest of the world. That's what's come out of </p>
<p>round after round of tough but proper economic decision<br />
making. It's just no accident that Australia has a rate<br />
of employment growth twice as fast as the rest of the<br />
world from the decisions that we've taken. It's no<br />
accident that we are now in a situation where we are able<br />
significantly to increase our exports and reduce our<br />
imports because in that way we're tackling the problem of<br />
our external account and we'll be bringing our current<br />
account deficit down by a full one percentage point of<br />
GDP, or $ 3B, in this coming financial year. The proof of<br />
economic management, whether in this country or in any<br />
other, is that no decisions and set of decisions<br />
calculated to meet the economic challenges confronting a<br />
country are capable of being introduced without causing<br />
some difficulties. Whether you look at the United<br />
States", whether you look at Europe, whether you look at<br />
the Soviet Union, there is no country in which proper<br />
economic decision making can be done without causing some<br />
difficulties. The essential thing that you've got to do<br />
is to have you're target clearly in mind and the targets<br />
are bringing down inflation, restructuring the economy so<br />
we're more competitive and dealing with our external<br />
situation. Those are the targets, those are challenges<br />
and if we're going to make Australia equipped to meet<br />
those challenges of the present and the future then all<br />
of us have to be prepared to do things which for some of<br />
us may involve some restraint and the delay of the<br />
satisfaction of some of our aspirations.<br />
McMINN: Prime Minister, I'd like to talk to you about<br />
the crisis in the Gulf.<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
McMINN: Before we get to that, you look at it from a<br />
national perspective even in the answer to that question<br />
you were talking about the United States, the Soviet<br />
Union, Europe. From a position in Victoria, if I can<br />
bring you to that, I mean here there is clearly a crisis<br />
of confidence and you've got a situation where the<br />
Budget's made certain financial statements, what hope for<br />
the business community in Melbourne particularly, in<br />
light of the fact that people just simply aren' t<br />
investing. They're very, very concerned about the way<br />
they live.<br />
PM: Well just on the question of investment, let's look<br />
at the scene nationally and that embraces Victoria. What<br />
we have seen over recent years is record levels of<br />
investment. In 1988-89 business investment as a share of<br />
GDP was the highest<br />
( tape break)<br />
PM: as Victoria itself is concerned, Ian, I<br />
obviously do not seek to intrude on the budget making and<br />
economic decision making process of the Government of<br />
Victoria. I have confidence that Joan Kirner and those </p>
<p>around her will make the decisions and some of them<br />
tough decisions that need to be made to deal with the<br />
particular problems that she's inherited in Victoria.<br />
McMINN: She's inherited indeed. Prime Minister, looking<br />
to the Gulf crisis, I am concerned, as anyone in<br />
Australia would be concerned about the fact that we have<br />
Australians there that could be used as human shields. I<br />
mean what, if anything, can be done to well not stop it<br />
but try to bring it to a position where some common sense<br />
can prevail?<br />
PM: I wish I was able, Ian, to be able to say to your<br />
listeners and particularly to any of them who may have<br />
relatives or loved ones in Kuwait and Iraq that I've got<br />
an optImistic story to tell them. ' It would be dishonest<br />
so I don't say that. I mean it is an extremely serious<br />
situation. There is evidence of the disposition of a<br />
number of foreigners being held as hostages there to<br />
possible target areas although as far as we know at this<br />
stage this does not apply to Australians, but I have no<br />
reason to assume that it may not. Now the answer to your<br />
question as to what do we do is that we do not succumb to<br />
the totalitarianism of Saddam Hussein and condone his<br />
acquisition by force of Kuwait. Because if our history<br />
teaches us anything, it is that appeasement of dictators<br />
is the certain route to an enlarged conflict. If the<br />
relevant nations, particularly the British and the<br />
French, in the 1930' s had stood up to Hitler when he made<br />
his first move as he did in March of 1936 into the<br />
Rheinland, breaking every solemn commitment he'd<br />
previously made, then if the British and French had stood<br />
up to him then that would've been the end. I mean it's a<br />
fascinating fact of life that the German military command<br />
had made a decision at that point on the basis that they<br />
expected the British and the French to move in a stop<br />
him, that they were themselves going to depose Hitler.<br />
But the appeasement which really effectively started then<br />
in March of 1936 and then went from the Rheinland to<br />
Austria and then to Czechoslovakia, that led to the<br />
greater conflict. That is a clear lesson of history and<br />
we have to understand that in this present situation that<br />
if we do not stand firm as a community of nations against<br />
this horrific aggressor then the price subsequently paid<br />
will be the greater.<br />
McMINN: But it would appear to me and I mean I'm just<br />
a journalist it would appear to me from all the reading<br />
and listening and watching that I do that we're looking<br />
at a conflict. I mean the US is building up forces<br />
PM: Not necessarily so. I mean I have expressed the<br />
hope and I specifically put this point to the Iraqi<br />
Ambassador when he came to see me yesterday, I said look<br />
just examine this in terms of the interests of the Iraqi<br />
people, there is no way that a continuation of this<br />
situation can be other than disastrous for the people of<br />
Iraq. One must hope, Ian, that there are going to be </p>
<p>A 7<br />
sufficient people there in Iraq, if not with the Leader<br />
himself around him, who will rationally come to<br />
understand that a continuation of this situation must<br />
mean disaster for the people of Iraq. I mean either way<br />
if it's merely a continuation of the embargo's, their<br />
economy will gradually disintegrate, their capacity to<br />
feed themselves will diminish and this will be a<br />
disaster. of course if there were an escalation of the<br />
conflict, so would that be a disaster. There is no way<br />
in which a continuation of the present Iraqi course can<br />
be other than disaster for the Iraqi people. Now that<br />
reality must, one hopes, be increasingly dawning if not<br />
upon Saddam. Hussein himself at least upon many of those<br />
around him. Therefore I don't think we have to be<br />
totally pessimistic and say that conflict is the only<br />
answer: But equally we must be honest with ourselves and<br />
say that is a possibility.<br />
McMINN: Prime Minister, I know you're very busy but one<br />
last question, and I mean this with the greatest of<br />
sensitivity. If an Australian dies over there and as I<br />
say I mean this with sensitivity I mean what will go<br />
through your mind?<br />
PM: Enormous sadness. I can't begin to convey to, as I<br />
say, the relatives and the loved ones of the Australians<br />
that are being held as hostages the two feelings I have.<br />
That is one of absolute repugnance at the action of<br />
Saddam Hussein and the depth of my feelings of concern<br />
for these people. I just hope as deeply as I possibly<br />
can that the sort of scenario that you envisage will not<br />
occur and that sanity and rationality will prevail.<br />
McMINN: And just looking back at the Budget, you're<br />
happy that it's not a half-way house?<br />
PM: Yes, I think we have struck the appropriate balance.<br />
It would be easy to be, as I say, hairy chested and say<br />
look how much hurt and harm I can inflict. But<br />
inflicting hurt and harm for the sake of doing it is no<br />
criterion of statesmanship or economic management.<br />
You've got to exercise that degree of restraint which is<br />
consistent with meeting the objective of keeping the<br />
level of activity to sustainable levels but not plunging<br />
the economy into recession.<br />
McMINN: And hoping it will work.<br />
PM: I believe it will work.<br />
McMINN: Well let's hope it does. Prime Minister, thank<br />
you very much for joining me on the program.<br />
PM: Thank you very much, Ian.<br />
ends </p>
