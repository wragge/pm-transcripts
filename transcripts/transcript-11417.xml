    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much Mr Finemore, ladies and</p>
<p> gentlemen.</p>
<p>It is a real pleasure not only to be amongst you</p>
<p> today but to realise I am the first Prime Minister of Australia to</p>
<p> have addressed a national trucking convention.</p>
<p>  People have often spoken of the tyranny of distance that was</p>
<p> a famous and evocative phrase created by that great Australian historian</p>
<p> Geoffrey Blainey.  And</p>
<p> if ever space and distance has defined the character of a nation then</p>
<p> the space and the distance between population centres has had a huge</p>
<p> impact on the character and the spirit of the Australian people.</p>
<p>  And there is no industry in Australia which in a way is more</p>
<p> conscious of the vast distances and the vast space and the impact</p>
<p> of that on our national psyche than your own industry.</p>
<p>I want to thank you for the major contribution</p>
<p> you make to the economic strength and vitality of the Australian community.</p>
<p>  You are an industry comprised in the main of people who are</p>
<p> fiercely committed to the free enterprise ethic.</p>
<p>  You are fiercely committed to the ideals of hard work in the</p>
<p> hope of a decent return.  And</p>
<p> in that sense and in that spirit you are part of the business free</p>
<p> enterprise background of the Australian nation.</p>
<p>Your contribution has been significant and your</p>
<p> contribution can be even greater if the Government can secure passage</p>
<p> through the Australian Parliament of its fundamental reform of the</p>
<p> Australian taxation system.</p>
<p>  I will come to that proposal in just a moment but before doing</p>
<p> so I want to say one or two things briefly about the general economic</p>
<p> backdrop against which this convention takes place.</p>
<p> The Australian economy at the moment is performing</p>
<p> very strongly, more strongly than it has for probably 30 years.</p>
<p>  We have very low inflation, much lower interest rates, a high</p>
<p> level of business investment, a lower rate of unemployment than the</p>
<p> case three years ago, a reputation around the world and particularly</p>
<p> in our region of a country that was able to stare down the worst of</p>
<p> the Asian economic downturn.</p>
<p>  That has not happened by accident, it has happened through</p>
<p> a combination of the hard work of business Australia represented here</p>
<p> today, the contribution of the employees of Australia and also through</p>
<p> sensible on occasions stoic government policy in the face of fierce</p>
<p> criticism for taking some initially unpopular measures.</p>
<p>You remember some of the outcry three years ago</p>
<p> when we set about cutting the budget deficit of $10.5 billion that</p>
<p> we inherited.  Just imagine</p>
<p> where we would now be if we were still in deficit.</p>
<p>  Just imagine where our interest rates might now be if we still</p>
<p> had a deficit of $10.5 billion or more.</p>
<p>  Just ask yourselves whether we would have been able to stare</p>
<p> down the Asian economic downturn if we had not set about putting our</p>
<p> books in order.  And so</p>
<p> it has been in relation to so many policy areas.</p>
<p>  We have changed fundamentally Australia's industrial relations</p>
<p> system. And the benefits of that are now being seen in the rising</p>
<p> productivity of Australian workers where it's possible for me as Prime</p>
<p> Minister to say without any fear of contradiction that Australian</p>
<p> employees are better off, truly better off, than they were 10 or 15</p>
<p> years ago.  Because they</p>
<p> have enjoyed the double benefit of increases in real wages and also</p>
<p> significant reductions in housing interest rates which have a major</p>
<p> impact on the weekly disposable income of most Australian families.</p>
<p>  $320 a month on average has come off the mortgage of Australian</p>
<p> households.  And that</p>
<p> is the equivalent of a payrise of $100 a week for average wage and</p>
<p> salary earners.  So they</p>
<p> have been real material benefits that have flowed from economic reform.</p>
<p>And today my colleague, Tony Abbott the Minister</p>
<p> for Employment Services, will give a report card on another reform</p>
<p> success that was achieved despite the ridicule and the derision of</p>
<p> our critics when the reform was introduced.</p>
<p>  And that is the result one year after its introduction of the</p>
<p> privatised job market or job network which replaced the old Commonwealth</p>
<p> Employment Service.</p>
<p>And I am happy to say that the Job Network has</p>
<p> been 50 per cent more successful in placing unemployed Australians</p>
<p> in work than the old CES.  And</p>
<p> that's been achieved in the face of fierce ridicule, derision and</p>
<p> criticism not only from our political opponents but from most of the</p>
<p> media of Australia in the early months of the operation of that scheme.</p>
<p>  It was, in fact, a world first.</p>
<p>  We were the first country to seriously try the notion of privatising</p>
<p> our labour exchange, our job market.</p>
<p>  And of course there was some teething troubles and difficulties</p>
<p> at the beginning but we persevered and the benefits of that very important</p>
<p> reform are now being seen.  And</p>
<p> I congratulate and praise my Minister, Tony Abbott, on the work that</p>
<p> he has done since being appointed to that job six months ago.</p>
<p>So there are rewards for reform.</p>
<p>  There are always marks given in the long run if governments</p>
<p> are prepared to take a lead and commit themselves to fundamental reform.</p>
<p>And that, of course, brings me to the burning political</p>
<p> issue of the day and that is whether the verdict of the Australian</p>
<p> people in October of last year is going to be listened to and obeyed</p>
<p> by the Parliament of Australia.</p>
<p>  Last October we went to the Australian people having released</p>
<p> a detailed plan to reform the Australian taxation system.</p>
<p>  We didn't put out a generalised commitment for taxation reform,</p>
<p> we didn't try and skate on thin ice, we didn't try and say to the</p>
<p> Australian people, if you re-elect us we will do something about Australia's</p>
<p> indirect tax system, we'll try and reduce personal income tax, we'll</p>
<p> try and reform the business taxation system.</p>
<p>  What we did last October was to explain in total detail what</p>
<p> we would do with the Australian taxation system if we won that election.  We told people what the rates would be, we told people what</p>
<p> taxes would be abolished, we told people how income tax would be reduced,</p>
<p> we told people how family benefits would be lifted, we told your industry</p>
<p> of the great benefits of taxation reform.</p>
<p>  We laid it out in detail and we went through the fire of an</p>
<p> election campaign with all the dangers during an election campaign</p>
<p> of an hysterical response on occasion to what in reality can only</p>
<p> be side issues.</p>
<p>But our plan remained intact.</p>
<p>  We won that election and we are now saying to the Senate of</p>
<p> Australia, it is your duty to obey the wishes of the Australian people.</p>
<p>  Because the Australian people had an opportunity to scrutinise</p>
<p> that plan.  And I want</p>
<p> the focus to be in the weeks ahead as that debate goes on in the Senate</p>
<p> and comes to a crescendo before the 30th of June.</p>
<p>  I want the focus to be on the fundamental benefits in reform</p>
<p> of taxation change.  Not</p>
<p> on emotional side issues that are the stuff of good headlines but</p>
<p> do nothing to improve the fundamental structure of fairness or equity</p>
<p> of the Australian taxation system.  I want the focus to be on the fact that tax reform will reduce</p>
<p> the annual fuel bill of this vast nation of ours by $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>  I want the focus to be on the fact that as a result of the</p>
<p> introduction of our taxation reform plan the price of fuel for business</p>
<p> will fall by seven cents a litre.</p>
<p>  I want the focus to be on the fact that for your industry the</p>
<p> effective excise rate will be reduced from 43 cents a litre to 18</p>
<p> cents a litre.  That indirect</p>
<p> taxation reform in Australia under our plan will reduce road transport</p>
<p> costs by 6.7 per cent resulting in cost savings of around $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>  That the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and the introduction</p>
<p> of a goods and services tax will result in an initial 8.3 per cent</p>
<p> fall in vehicle prices.  During</p>
<p> the transition to a GST the eligibility for tax credits will be phased</p>
<p> in over two years and once businesses are eligible for the full input</p>
<p> tax credits the price of vehicles will fall by 16.9 per cent on average.</p>
<p> There are unarguable benefits for your industry</p>
<p> in these reforms.  These</p>
<p> reforms will make your industry more competitive. These reforms recognise</p>
<p> the size of Australia.  These</p>
<p> reforms will help regional Australia like no other reforms any government</p>
<p> has proposed.  These reforms</p>
<p> are sensitive to the cost pressures faced by people who live in rural</p>
<p> and distant areas of our country.</p>
<p>  In other words, these reforms attack the fundamental difficulties</p>
<p> of the cost structure of regional and rural Australia.</p>
<p>  At a time when we are concerned about the de-population of</p>
<p> the regions of Australia I cannot for the life of me understand that</p>
<p> any political party in Australia would oppose the introduction of</p>
<p> reforms and changes that will do more to revitalise the regions of</p>
<p> Australia than any taxation reform that has ever been proposed.</p>
<p> But the benefit of these reforms do not stop</p>
<p> in the areas that I have mentioned.</p>
<p>  Under our taxation plan there will be a fundamental change</p>
<p> to the operation of the personal taxation system.</p>
<p>  Under our plan 80 per cent - 80 per cent - of Australian wage</p>
<p> and salary earners will be on a top marginal rate of no more than</p>
<p> 30 cents in the dollar.  The</p>
<p> impact of that on incentive for middle Australia will be enormous.</p>
<p>  Under our plan there will be significant increases in the tax</p>
<p> benefits available for people with children.</p>
<p>  It is a tax reform plan that is more sensitive than any before</p>
<p> it for the undeniable cost that Australian families incur in raising</p>
<p> young children.  It is</p>
<p> a tax reform plan that will remove many of the poverty traps in the</p>
<p> existing tax welfare system in our country.</p>
<p>  Whereby if you get a wage increase, such as the living wage</p>
<p> safety net increase awarded yesterday by the Australian Industrial</p>
<p> Relations Commission, some of the benefit of that raise is gobbled</p>
<p> up through people going into a higher income bracket and, thereby,</p>
<p> losing some of the family allowances they were previously receiving.</p>
<p>  Because under our plan the income limits in relation to those</p>
<p> additional family allowances are significantly increased.</p>
<p>  And the combination of that plus reductions in marginal tax</p>
<p> rates will remove the theft of the benefits of living wage increases</p>
<p> which are involved and operate under the present system.</p>
<p>Reforms under our plan do not stop at that.</p>
<p>  The benefits overall to our exporters - and as a nation we</p>
<p> need incessantly to remember that we need to export to survive - and</p>
<p> our plan will reduce exports costs by $4.5 billion.</p>
<p>  Our plan, overall, will reduce business costs throughout Australia</p>
<p> by about $10.5 billion.  But</p>
<p> the benefits, of course, do not stop there either.</p>
<p>  Under our plan the States of Australia will receive the biggest</p>
<p> single beneficial reform to Commonwealth/State financial relations</p>
<p> since federation.  Under</p>
<p> our plan, once the transition phase has been passed through the States</p>
<p> will receive significantly larger amounts than they would if the existing</p>
<p> Commonwealth/State financial relations continued.</p>
<p>  And that is because under the plan every last dollar of the</p>
<p> proceeds of the GST will go to the Australian States.</p>
<p>  And what that means is that they will have more resources to</p>
<p> spend on government schools, on police services, on hospitals and</p>
<p> on other important community services that are the ongoing responsibility</p>
<p> of the Australian States within our Federal arrangement.</p>
<p>I find it puzzling, I find it bizarre, indeed,</p>
<p> perplexing that our plan should be criticised by so many in the welfare</p>
<p> sector yet under our plan we are providing a guarantee of the revenue</p>
<p> base for the Australian States, the like of which they could receive</p>
<p> under no other arrangement, that will enable them to increase the</p>
<p> support they give to the less well off in the Australian community.</p>
<p>  And I say to some of our critics in the welfare sector, do</p>
<p> you really believe that by knocking over the GST you are helping the</p>
<p> less well off in the Australian community.</p>
<p>  Because every time you strike a blow against this reform you</p>
<p> are putting at peril the possibility that the Australian States can,</p>
<p> in fact, receive more and therefore have more to support the less</p>
<p> privileged in our community.</p>
<p>  I'm pleased to say that the criticism from the welfare sector</p>
<p> is by no means uniform and there are many who are realising the value</p>
<p> of the changes that the Government is proposing.</p>
<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, this particular reform</p>
<p> plan is the most comprehensive change to the Australian taxation system</p>
<p> that has ever been proposed by any government.</p>
<p>  And there's not a man or woman who understands politics in</p>
<p> this country or understands taxation, who understands the needs of</p>
<p> the Australian economy, that wouldn't in their silent, private moments</p>
<p> acknowledge that we have needed taxation reform for many years.</p>
<p>If we don't embrace taxation reform now the opportunity</p>
<p> will not come our way in our generation again.</p>
<p>  This is the great opportunity this country has to embrace taxation</p>
<p> reform.  I will have been</p>
<p> in Parliament 25 years in May of this year and we have been debating,</p>
<p> one way or another, the need for taxation reform for a quarter of</p>
<p> a century.  Only a few</p>
<p> months after I entered Parliament there was a document called the</p>
<p> Asprey Report which was a detailed investigation of the Australian</p>
<p> taxation system commissioned by former Liberal Treasurer, the late</p>
<p> Billy Snedden which recommended the introduction of essentially what</p>
<p> the Government proposed to the Australian people last October and</p>
<p> that's a broad-based, indirect tax; recommended the introduction of</p>
<p> lower rates of personal income tax and drew attention to the weaknesses</p>
<p> of our existing wholesale tax system and the inequities it imposed.</p>
<p>  Now, that was 25 years ago.</p>
<p>  And we've debated it.</p>
<p>  It's been proposed from both sides of politics.</p>
<p>  I argued for it unsuccessfully as a member of the Fraser Government.  Paul Keating proposed it at the tax summit with my support.</p>
<p>  He was rolled by Bob Hawke and the unions.</p>
<p>  And then in 1993 John Hewson campaigned for it from Opposition</p>
<p> and he was defeated by the most vicious and ferocious fear campaign</p>
<p> waged by the one-time believer, Paul Keating, in taxation reform.</p>
<p>And fast forwarding to 1998 we finally got the</p>
<p> verdict of the Australian people.</p>
<p>  We took it to them, warts and all, and we ran all the risk</p>
<p> involved in it.  And if</p>
<p> our political system means anything it means that when you take those</p>
<p> risks, you win that support, you put your political future on the</p>
<p> line in the national interest, you are entitled to have that plan</p>
<p> implemented.  Not as some</p>
<p> kind of reward to the Prime Minister but because it's for the good</p>
<p> of Australia.  It's because</p>
<p> the nation supported it.  It's</p>
<p> because the nation decided that you have to embrace changes of that</p>
<p> kind in order to go forward economically.</p>
<p> I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that you</p>
<p> can always persuade the Australian people of the need for fundamental</p>
<p> reform if you satisfy two criteria.</p>
<p>  Firstly, you must persuade them that it is good for Australia</p>
<p> because all of us, deep down, care about the collective future and</p>
<p> welfare of our nation.  And</p>
<p> you must also persuade them that it is fundamentally fair to different</p>
<p> sections of the Australian community.</p>
<p>  Now, that is the responsibility that we undertook before the</p>
<p> last election.  And that</p>
<p> is why we laid it out in detail.</p>
<p>  And that is why I ignored the warnings of some so-called strategists</p>
<p> and advisers who said you don't campaign on a new tax.  Well, of course, it wasn't a new tax.  It was an entirely new taxation system.  But we ignored those warnings and we campaigned and we won</p>
<p> and we won because people ultimately saw that it was good for Australia</p>
<p> and they accepted that it was fair.</p>
<p>And they do believe that you have to change.</p>
<p>  The art of good government is to hang on to those things that</p>
<p> continue to work and continue to serve us well but at the same time</p>
<p> display a willingness to get rid of those things that are no longer</p>
<p> helping the country and are holding back its progress.</p>
<p>  And that has been the genius of this country for so many years,</p>
<p> that we've been able to do that and we must now face doing it in relation</p>
<p> to taxation reform.  We</p>
<p> cannot go on forever putting it off and that is why I'm so committed.</p>
<p>  And I want to ensure that I have no intention of backing away</p>
<p> from the plan that we put to the Australian people last October -</p>
<p> no intention at all.  Of</p>
<p> course in this or that area we can fine-tune it but the essentials</p>
<p> and the comprehensive character of the change that I've outlined to</p>
<p> you today of which I'm sure so many of you are very familiar, that</p>
<p> they are not going to be touched because each is so dependent on the</p>
<p> other.  It's not the sort of thing where you can have the one bit but</p>
<p> take away another.  It</p>
<p> is an integrated whole and that is its great appeal and that is its</p>
<p> great benefit for the Australian people.</p>
<p>We have achieved a lot economically over the last</p>
<p> few years.  We have come</p>
<p> through the worst downturn in the Asian economic experience without</p>
<p> being seriously dented.  And</p>
<p> that has happened because in so many areas we have reformed and strengthened</p>
<p> our economy.  But there's</p>
<p> only one thing that matters in the modern, globalised world economy</p>
<p> and that is not how you compare with how you were a few years ago,</p>
<p> or not some hypothetical comparison between where you are now or where</p>
<p> you might have been if something had occurred, what really matters</p>
<p> is how you compete and compare in present day circumstances with the</p>
<p> rest of the world.  And</p>
<p> we have no option to stop reform in this country.</p>
<p>  We have to go on changing to remain competitive and relevant.</p>
<p>  And the great challenge for Australia is to consolidate the</p>
<p> strong economic positions we now have.</p>
<p>  We can't afford to sit back and say, well, we don't really</p>
<p> need all of this extra reform, look how well we're doing.</p>
<p>  Once we start doing that we'll lose the comparative advantage</p>
<p> we now have.  The only</p>
<p> way that we can keep ahead of the game and retain that comparative</p>
<p> advantage is to continue further reform.</p>
<p>  And that, ladies and gentlemen, means unavoidably, inevitably</p>
<p> and overwhelmingly embracing taxation reform.</p>
<p>  And that is why it is the single most important thing on the</p>
<p> Government's economic and reform agenda at the present time.</p>
<p>  And it will remain on that agenda until we succeed in implementing</p>
<p> it.  Because we're not</p>
<p> going to walk away and I'm not going to give up or surrender on something</p>
<p> that I know in all of my being is important to the long-term economic</p>
<p> future and economic strength of the Australian nation.</p>
<p>  There's no point in holding high office in this country if</p>
<p> you don't use the authority that that office gives you to bring about</p>
<p> reforms that you know in your heart and your understanding are important</p>
<p> to the future of the Australian community.</p>
