MESSAGE TO BE INCLUDED IN ADELAIDE " ADVERTISER"<br />
S3' O'IL SUPPLEEN TO M TH OCCASION OF<br />
SOUTH A LIA'S REACHING A P01' UTION OF<br />
ONE MILLION<br />
This is a most significant moment in the<br />
history of a great State. It is not often that a simple<br />
statistic can be exciting but the achievement by South<br />
Australia of a population of one million evokes mental<br />
images that can be a matter of pride for those of us<br />
who are growing old, and of stimulus for the young.<br />
When 126 years ago your first settlers under<br />
Captain Hindmarsh stepped ashore at Holdfast Bay, they<br />
brought little but faith and courage. To them and to<br />
their successors, native-born or immigrant, we owe<br />
thanks for the works and development we have inherited.<br />
Against the competition of sister communities<br />
in more richly-entdowed parts of our nation, South Australia,<br />
under wise guidance, and with strength and spirit, has<br />
built well-a flourishing economy with a growing balance<br />
between the fruits of the soil and the products of the<br />
factory. It is indeed a time when South Australians may<br />
congratulate themselves. To those congratulations I would<br />
like sincerely to add my own, R. G. MENZIES<br />
CANBERRA, 17th November, 1962. </p>
