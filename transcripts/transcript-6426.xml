TRANSCRIPT GOOD MORNING AUSTRALIA -LAURIE OAKES<br />
13 July 1984<br />
E 0 OE Proof Only<br />
OAKES: Mr H-awke you've won on everything that matters this<br />
week. I think you'd be fairly happy with the Conference.<br />
Yes, I'm very happy with it Laurie indeei6.<br />
I think it's been good for the Party# good for the country.<br />
DAKE~ S: What do you thiynk the Party's got out of it.<br />
Well it's got sensible policies and sensible, I think,<br />
has to be judged, if I c an put it in termq of the speech I<br />
made to the Conference,. of what's relevant to the Party's<br />
basic principles and tailored to the needs and expectations<br />
and aspirations of the Australian people. And I think we've<br />
struck the right balanc ' e because, as I zaid in the speech<br />
Laurie, I think the two really are identical and we haven't<br />
been diverted from the real aspirations of people by<br />
irrelevancies I think.*<br />
OAKES: Well, specifica * lly, what's come out; of ib'th~ t' iil. be good<br />
or the country.<br />
P. M4.: Well in the area of economic policy we've got zan<br />
endorsement of the Government'rs economic strategy in general,<br />
the mandate to pursue that and, specifically in that area,<br />
we've got the mandate to make a fiorp competitive, effective,<br />
efficient, finrancial sectl-or by the bringing in of foreign<br />
banks. And that must benefit Australians ac individuals<br />
and Australian business. So in that important area I think<br />
we've a great advantage,<br />
OAKES; bid you expect to win as easily an you did on all<br />
these issues on your * economic policy, uranium, Timor, U. S.<br />
bases they were all big wins weren't they.<br />
They were Laurie. Well we've don~ e a lot of work and may<br />
I address myself to an issue that's been talked about a fair<br />
bit jsbereaduring the Conference. May I say that I<br />
and Paul IReatirig in the economic area for instance, and myselt<br />
particularly I suppose iii the uranium. areal beforehand had<br />
done a lot of work in these areas. I acknowledge the iassistance<br />
that we have received from the disciplined way in which others<br />
who X think, in the absence of a formbilisation of the Centre<br />
Left w6uld have voted w~~ ith us. Nn-vertheless it has been the ./ 2 </p>
<p>P. M. cont...: fact, which I acknowledge readily, that having<br />
fonralised and having adopted the discipline, if you like of<br />
the Caucus vote, that's been helpful. But it's reflected a lot<br />
of hard work that's gone on in respect of each of these issues<br />
over a fair period of time.<br />
OAKES: I know that a lot of people around the Conference were<br />
referring to it by the end of the week as the Centre Right.<br />
Do you agree with that?<br />
Well I think you know from conversations that we've had<br />
over many years, I find pretty unhelpful the flicking onto to<br />
someone of a tag and to think that you've exhausted your<br />
intellectual responsibility by saying well there's the tag<br />
and it means something. I . think if you look at different<br />
issues, Laurie, you'll see that people have taken positions<br />
which, if you want to fit in the spectrum, some of them might<br />
be described as right of centre, other a little bit left of<br />
centre I don't think the tag itself mepns much.<br />
OAKES: Well you yourself used the tag about the Left. What<br />
do you think of their performance. Are they a spent force.<br />
Well I don't want to be disruptive. I think the<br />
disappointing feature of the contribution of the Left has been<br />
that well I don't want to say intellectual bankruptcy but I<br />
think that, let me put it this way, if I was just engaged in<br />
an academic exercise which is the last thing I'm engaged in,<br />
but if I'd had to be briefed as it were to put a case for a<br />
so-called, radical economic position for the Left<br />
OAKES: You used to I think.<br />
Well I don't know if that's right. I don't believe that<br />
I for instance in the banks was putting the conservative position,<br />
I think the conservative position was being put by the Left which<br />
is the point I'm making. I think we were putting the radical<br />
position. I'm merely making the point that I think there was<br />
in an academic sense a better case to be put. I think that there<br />
has been a tendency for them to hot to face up to the present<br />
and the realities and to think their way through on that a pretty<br />
tired position I think.<br />
OAKES: Do you think they lack leaders?<br />
Well, they've got leaders. They don't lack leaders.<br />
But I think that there is a generation problem. there to some<br />
extent in the Left. Some of the older ones don't, I think, seem<br />
to be so respected by the younger ones. But I think the calibre<br />
of the contributions that were made were somewhat disappointing.<br />
OAKES: You got together with one of the younger leaders of the<br />
Left, Peter Duncan, to end what's been a running scre in the<br />
Labor Party the Combe affair. Are you happy about that now,<br />
that it's over.<br />
Yes, I wasn't as you know personally directly involved<br />
in the negotiations.. but they ent on with my blessing. Of course<br />
I'm glad it's over. I think you know Laurie, because you've had<br />
a pretty direct interest, at no stage from the very beginning, / 3 </p>
<p>P. M. cont... from that first fateful day, if you like, when I<br />
received a briefing have I have any animus against David Combe<br />
as I've said to the Conference today. How could I? I mean all<br />
along...<br />
OAKES: You were friends for years.<br />
Yes, and I think it's recognised that I saved him in<br />
1976 and did it gladly I received a fair bit of abuse across<br />
the spectrum for doing so. But I've had no animus against<br />
David. I had a responsibility to the people of this country and<br />
national security considerations in regard to an aspect of that<br />
issue in which he was involved. I never wanted to hurt him or<br />
his family. I know that he suffered hurt and-' m not surprised<br />
that he's had some pretty rough things -to say about me. That's<br />
human nature. I hope now that, as we've said, David can come back<br />
into the mainstream of events. He's entitled to.<br />
OARES: Are you going to help him do that though, say offering<br />
a Government job or a contract?<br />
It won't be a question no, no, I won't be offering<br />
any contract or jobs. I think David Combe has his intrinsic<br />
merits and capacities. If something arises and he is an<br />
applicant fcr that, well what's been cleared up now is there's<br />
no blackball there in the way.<br />
OAKES: So he's entitled to apply.<br />
He's entitled to apply.<br />
OAKES: One thing I'd like to pursue to end this interview<br />
the Conference has kept you away from running the country for<br />
a week. How serious is that for example, the dollar has<br />
dropped alarmingly in value. Have you been able to keep abreast<br />
of that? Oh yes. I don't think I've missed a minute of the<br />
Conference, I've been there the whole time which I think I have<br />
a responsibility to be there. But I also have a responsibility<br />
to keep myself informed of what's going on, so I'm in fairly<br />
constant contact with my staff. If anything's arisen where they<br />
need my guidance or decision, then it's been there. Obviously<br />
one will be glad when the Conference is over so that you can<br />
make the effort; more to be fully involved.<br />
OAKES: Have you been briefed on the dollar situation. Is it<br />
serious? No, it's inevitable. It's not an attack upon the Australian<br />
dollar. It's the residual effect of what's happening to the United<br />
States' dollar. That is going up because of reasons that are well<br />
known, internal reasons there, and what is happening to the Australian<br />
dollar is happening to other world currencies.. Let me just make<br />
two points about it. Of cource, as far as Australian exporters are<br />
concerned, that this is a pluj for them, but we've got to understand<br />
that on the side of of our domestic economy that the weaker the<br />
Australian dollar becomes because of the strength of the United<br />
States' dollar then that makes imports lore expensive and that<br />
will have some impact on our pricing structure. So I hope that ./ 4 </p>
<p>P. M. conlt...: the American dollar ssttles do-un. -We've alluded<br />
to this volatility, this upward volatility if you lizxe, and that we<br />
can see the Australian dollar coming up again. That will happen.<br />
OAKES: With the. Conference out of the way you now get down to the<br />
task oE preparing the Budget. Will the new economic policy approved<br />
by the Conference be relevant to the Budget, effect you planning<br />
there? Nool think it's fair to say that our planning was going<br />
ahead, would have gone ahead. What the Conference has done overwhelmingly<br />
of course# as they've hau to do given the outstanding success<br />
of the policies we've been pursuing they've endorsed those.<br />
We'll go ahead in the knowledge that the Party has not only<br />
endorsed but is proud of the way we've been goiftg...<br />
OAKES: Thanks Mr Hawke.<br />
Thanks Laurie. 0 </p>
