FOR MEDIA 20 NOVEMBER 1984<br />
The Prime Minister today totally rejected a claim by the<br />
National Secretary of the RSL, Mr Ian Gollings, that the<br />
Department of Veterans' Affairs was to be cut back. It<br />
would continue to have full and unchanged responsibility<br />
for the care of the ex-service community.<br />
He said Mr Golling's comments were utterly wrong, with no<br />
foundation whatsoever.<br />
" I find it extremely disappointing considering<br />
that Mr Gollings knows how closely this Government<br />
has worked and consulted with ex-service organisations,<br />
in particular the Returned Services League, and its<br />
President, Sir William Keys. It is a relationship<br />
that I look forward to continuing in a constructive<br />
fashion after the election."<br />
" I draw Veterans' attention to the fact that only<br />
last week I promised to continue the upgrading of<br />
repatriation hospitals. I can also reiterate this<br />
Government's commitment to full consultation with<br />
the ex-service community and the promise that a<br />
draft of the new Veterans' Entitlements legislation<br />
will be provided to the ex-Service community for<br />
comment and discussion as soon as it is finalised." </p>
