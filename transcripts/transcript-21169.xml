    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce today Australian Government funding for four projects totalling $2.25 million in the Playford/Salisbury region.</p>
<p>The Sustainable Regions Programme was announced by the Deputy Prime Minister in August 2001 as the key element of the 'Stronger Regions, A Stronger Australia' package.  Together with the Australian Government's Regional Partnerships Programme, these programmes provide a framework for developing Australia's regions over the next decade.</p>
<p>The successful projects are:</p>
<p>The Adams Creek and Edinburgh Parks Flood Mitigation and Stormwater Re-use Project ($1.32 million) which will protect key infrastructure against flooding and reduce water supply costs through the construction of an aquifer storage and recovery system.  The harvested stormwater will be available for urban renewal, community and industrial uses.  It will also enable the establishment of a wetlands habitat, increase biodiversity, contribute to environmental sustainability and reduce the region's reliance on the River Murray.</p>
<p>The Northern Innovation System Project ($431,904) will develop the skills and systems of small to medium sized businesses through the application of innovative technologies, marketing and business research.  This project will assist in commercialising new products and services for export and establish collaborative industry networks.</p>
<p>The Value Adding Adelaide Plains Project ($336,600) aims to improve the region's economic base by identifying innovative production methods and developing networks in the horticulture, viticulture and food related industries.</p>
<p>The Northern Sound System Project ($161,700) will involve the community in planning a performing arts and music centre and an interactive museum of historical and contemporary music.</p>
<p>These projects will provide the Playford/Salisbury region with opportunities to work together to build economic growth, foster environmental sustainability and encourage social inclusion throughout the region.</p>
<p>I congratulate the Playford/Salisbury Sustainable Region Advisory Committee and all those involved with these worthwhile projects.</p>
