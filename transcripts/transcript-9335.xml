SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
TOURISM TASK FORCE LUNCH, PARK GRAND HOTEL SYDNEY<br />
FRIDAY 26 AUGUST 1994<br />
When I first entered Parliament you would have been hard pressed to find a reference<br />
to the Australian tourism industry in any of our newspapers.<br />
If people wanted to visit Australia and find themselves a spot on the beach, that was<br />
fine by us, but we didn't go out of our way to sell our country as a tourist destination.<br />
And once the visitors arrived, well it was up to them to make their own way around<br />
Australia. It was, at best, marketing by osmosis.<br />
Back in 1973, the main reason international visitors made the trip to Australia was to<br />
visit friends and relatives.<br />
Three in every four visitors made their way from either Europe, North America or<br />
New Zealand while only one in eight came from Asia.<br />
It was a case of visiting the safe and familiar with just a twist of the exotic.<br />
Of course, that's all changed now.<br />
And, in so many ways, what's happened to our tourism industry reflects the wider<br />
internationalisation of Australia and its economy.<br />
As Australia has opened up to embrace the world, and particularly Asia, so too has our<br />
tourism industry.<br />
It's clearly one of our great success stories and it holds great hope for the future.<br />
A decade ago we welcomed 1 million visitors, today it is 3 million and by the centenary<br />
of Federation it should be more than 7 million. </p>
<p>The image we now present to the world is of an extraordinary array of natural beauty and<br />
charm backed up by a sophisticated and diverse multicultural society.<br />
It's a niche shopper's holiday paradise.<br />
The World Travel and Tourism Council has forecast that between now and the year 2005<br />
travel and tourism combined will create 112 million jobs in the Asia Pacific alone.<br />
Obviously, Australia is very well placed to capture a slice of that action we have one of the<br />
most competitive tourist industries in the world.<br />
And as the focus of world economic activity has shifted to Asia, so too has our tourist<br />
promotion. Today, one in every two visitors comes here from Asia.<br />
Obviously, globalisation is driving the tourism boom.<br />
As global comm-unications and information highways increase our exposure to other cultures,<br />
languages, and landscapes, so grows our desire to experience these things first hand.<br />
The more time we spend at home with our televisions and computers, the more we want to<br />
travel and experience the world.<br />
That goes some way to explaining why tourism is, and will remain, one of the world's fastest<br />
growing industries.<br />
But what is particularly exciting for us is the rate of growth in Australia in 1993 our tourism<br />
market grew at three times the world average.<br />
Tourism now accounts for 12 per cent of our total export earniings and is, without doubt,<br />
central to Australia's economric prosperity.<br />
But I don't need to remind anyone here that many others are in the race, with a good number<br />
of them just as desperate to capture the global tourist dollar.<br />
So what can the Government do to facilitate the continued expansion of the industry?<br />
Well, let me touch today on just four areas where I think the Government can make a<br />
difference. And they are training, regional tourism promotion, infrastructure development and the<br />
preservation of our heritage buildings.<br />
Let's start with training because this decade tourism should create around a quarter of a million<br />
new jobs in Australia. </p>
<p>If our tourism workers display world class service standards, there's no doubt we'll secure a<br />
place in the front rank of tourist destinations.<br />
As we demonstrated in the White Paper on Employment and Growth, Working Nation,<br />
training more highly skilled workers and delivering a more flexible and productive workplace is<br />
a Government priority.<br />
Indeed, we have no higher priority.<br />
In Working Nation, We suspended the training guarantee, introduced a training wage,<br />
increased funding for the Australian National Training Authority, doubled the number of labour<br />
market and vocational training places and increased the'number of entry level training places by<br />
50,000. And let me take this opportunity to congratulate the tourism industry and the Tourism Task<br />
Force for their role in leading the way in workplace reform.<br />
It was, after all, the Tourism Task Force that brought together some of Australia's leading<br />
hotels to draw up new workplace agreements that should come into place later this year.<br />
These new agreements will benefit staff, management, and tourists.<br />
I should also mention that in May this year, under a new Workplace Bargaining Program, we<br />
decided to provide an additional $ 27 million to further promote productive and cooperative<br />
bargaining in Australian workplaces.<br />
This should lead to a range of agreements across the tourism industry from high profile 5 star<br />
hotels to smaller properties in the hotel-motel sector, both unionised and non-unionised.<br />
In Working Nation we also paid particular attention to the regions of Australia. We did that<br />
for the fundamental reason that forms the basic philosophy of Working Nation: that is, we want<br />
al] Australians to share in the recovery.<br />
And that means we make sure we bring the people of regional Australia along with us.<br />
Clearly tourism provides regions with an excellent opportunity to create jobs and diversify their<br />
economic base.<br />
And Australia offers a host of diverse and unique holiday experiences away from our capital<br />
cities and major tourist gateways.<br />
Through responsible planning and management, regions can develop tourism opportunities that<br />
guarantee sustainable tourism enterprises and long term employment.<br />
To this end, we included a $ 42 million regional tourism package in the Federal Budget, eight<br />
million dollars of which has already made its way to some 89 projects right around Australia.<br />
And the cornerstone of this package, the Regional Tourism Development Program wili help<br />
regions develop integrated tourism plans.-</p>
<p>Extension of the EMDG scheme to tourism operators, which we also announced in Working<br />
Nation, should also make a difference in the regions.<br />
But if more regions of Australia are to benefit from the tourism explosion then we need to<br />
ensure we have a world class infrastructure.<br />
That's why, in Working Nation, we allocated $ 70 million dollars to a Regional Strategic<br />
Infrastructure Fund and freed up the arrangements governing infrastructure bonds.<br />
It's also why we introduced greater competition to our aviation industry.<br />
Several years ago now, this Government recognised the need to restructure our aviation<br />
industry.<br />
We amalgamated Australian Airlines and Qantas and opened international services to<br />
competition from Ansett so as to increase the range of marketing opportunities for the tourism<br />
industry. And I might mention that I'll be back here in Sydney on Monday to attend the acceptance<br />
ceremony for Ansett's first Boeing 747 aircraft.<br />
These reforms to the aviation industry have already delivered major benefits to Australian<br />
consumers and our international visitors.<br />
Since 1990, the number of domestic passengers has more than doubled, air fares have<br />
decreased by 25 per cent in real terms, and flights have increased on our 50 busiest routes.<br />
But the reform must continue.<br />
And that's why the Government has announced its intention to sell all the Federal airports and<br />
the airport at Badgerys Creek, subject to the outcome of a scoping study.<br />
The in-principle decision to sell the Federal airports is directed primarily to improving the<br />
efficiency of airport investments and operations.<br />
This should result in Australia's airport system developing into one of the most innovative<br />
private airport industries in the world.<br />
But to those of you here who are concerned that the benefits from the sale of the ' big' airports<br />
may be outweighed by the impact on some of the so called ' loss makers', let me say I am<br />
confident that we can adequately address the issue of loss makcing airports without<br />
disadvantaging local communities.<br />
The final area that I want to touch upon is the importance of heritage buildings to our tourism<br />
industry. </p>
<p>By preserving the best of our heritage buildings, by looking after those things that give our<br />
cities their special character, we give to future generations a sense of place, a sense of our<br />
urban heritage, and a sense of our unique national culture.<br />
At the same time, we make Australia an even more attractive place to visit.<br />
This was the thinking that lay behind the Historic Properties Restoration Program which we<br />
announced in One Nation.<br />
Importantly, this was the first Federal initiative specifically directed to the preservation and<br />
restoration of significant heritage buildings.<br />
This program has already brought about the splendid restoration of the Old Treasury Building<br />
in Melbourne, a great example of what we can achieve when we get co-operation from State<br />
Governments. The Customs House here in Sydney, which is one of the city's oldest and best-loved buildings,<br />
is anbther heritage building receiving assistance.<br />
Under the program, the Federal Government is providing $ 24 million towards its restoration so<br />
that it can serve as an important tourist and cultural centre.<br />
Through programs like this one, we're giving Australians, and international visitors, a better<br />
appreciation of our history and culture.<br />
At the same time, we're providing jobs and investing fiirther in our cultural and tourism<br />
industries. The Government initiatives that I have touched upon today are all designed to build on the<br />
hard work of the industry to ensure that tourism continues to be a driving force in Australia's<br />
economic and cultural development.<br />
And while the Government has played an important role in all this, it has been largely a<br />
facilitating role.<br />
The credit for the current strength and the potential of tourism in Australia must go in the<br />
main, to you, the industry, who have worked so hard to establish Australian tourism as a<br />
dynamic, prosperous and internationally competitive industry.<br />
I'm very excited by the prospects for our tourism industry and I have a very strong sense that if<br />
we can build on our many great competitive strengths, we can go a long way to passing on a<br />
much better Australia to those who come after us.<br />
Thank you. </p>
