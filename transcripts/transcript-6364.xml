FOR MEDIA 11 APRIL 1984<br />
The attached letter was sent to the Opposition Leader today. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA,<br />
1 0 APR .1984<br />
The Hon. A. S. Peacock, M. P.,<br />
Leader of the opposition,<br />
Parliament House,<br />
CANBERRA A. C. T. 2600<br />
Dear Mr Peacock,<br />
Thank you for your letter of 6 April, concerning the<br />
proposed visit of three South African politicians to<br />
Australia. I note that you have declined to give the written<br />
assurance, which I requested, that the visit would<br />
not be exploited by the politicians concerned to<br />
promote apartheid doctrine and policies. I note also<br />
that Mr Durr, a Member of the South African Government<br />
Party, who has apparently been the spokesman for the<br />
South Africans involved in this exercise, is reported<br />
as having similarly declined to give such an assurance.<br />
These developments confirm the Government's view that<br />
the principal purpose of the visit, as originally<br />
conceived by the South African Embassy, was to promote<br />
apartheid. In such circumstances, the Government<br />
will not be able to grant entry visas.<br />
In my letter of 5 April I outlined in detail my<br />
Government's policy of not granting visas to South<br />
African official representatives who seek to come to<br />
Australia to promote apartheid. Mr Durr has since<br />
been quoted as claiming that " the conception of<br />
so-called apartheid, as it is apparently perceived by<br />
the Australian Government, is a conception that is as<br />
dead as a dodo".<br />
You may be aware of the report on the weekend of the<br />
detention for three years of two South African children<br />
under five years of age, while their racial identity<br />
was determined. Such horrifying reports confirm only<br />
too clearly that the obscenity of apartheid remains the<br />
policy and practice of the South African Government. </p>
<p>I attach South African Government statistics received<br />
from the Australian Embassy in Pretoria, which confirm<br />
in appalling detail the basis of the Australian<br />
Government's policy and give the lie to Mr Durr and<br />
other apologists for apartheid.<br />
In your letter, you state that your own record in<br />
opposing apartheid is unimpeachable. It is certainly<br />
true that the Fraser Government had a very good<br />
record on Southern African issues. I am disappointed<br />
that the Coalition Parties appear to be walking away<br />
from it under your leadership.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
&amp; 0z" jJ<br />
R. J. L. Hawke </p>
