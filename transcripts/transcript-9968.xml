    <content><![CDATA[<p>31 March 1996</p>
<p>I announce today that I have written to the New South Wales Minister for theÂ Olympics, the Hon. Michael Knight NT, nominating Mr Donald McDonald AO andÂ Mr John Valder AO CBE for appointment by the New South Wales Governor to theÂ Board of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games ( SOCOG).</p>
<p>The SOCOG Act provides for the appointment of 15 directors, two of whom theÂ Prime Minister is able to nominate.Â </p>
<p>I also take the opportunity to re-affirm the Commonwealth Government's undertakingÂ to honour the commitments entered into by the previous Government in relation toÂ Sydney 2000 Olympics and Paralympics.</p>
<p>I will be writing to Premier Carr in the near future outlining the Commonwealth'sÂ strong desire to work co-operatively with the New South Wales Government, SOCOGÂ and the Sydney Paralympic; Organising Committee ( SPOC) to ensure the successfulÂ stagingÂ of the 2000 Giames.</p>
<p>My two nominees have strong credentials for the positions, particularly in the areas ofÂ financial management and the broader cultural aspects of this major event.</p>
<p>Mr McDonald, who has been the General Manager of the Australian Opera since 1987,Â has a wvide business and artistic background and has been nominated with an eye to theÂ longer term cultuiral significance of the Sydney 2000 Games, in particular the culturalÂ Olympiad wvhich is to be conducted over the next four years. Mr McDonald was aÂ member of the Olympic Bid Committee and has been chairman of SOCOG's CulturalÂ Committee sinceÂ 1994.</p>
<p>Mr Valder, a former chairman of the Sydney Stock Exchange and the New SouthÂ Wales Australia Day Council from 1989 to 1995, was the principal corporate fundÂ raiser for the Olympic Bid Committee between 1991 and 1993. He is also a formerÂ Federal and State President of the Liberal Party. His wide and varied experience inÂ business and politics will make him a valuable addition to the SOCOG Board.</p>
<p>They will replace the previous Prime Minister's representatives on the SOCOG Board,The Hon John Brown AO and Ms Samantha Moyston, who have resigned.</p>
