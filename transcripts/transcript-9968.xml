    <content><![CDATA[<p>31 March 1996</p>
<p>I announce today that I have written to the New South Wales Minister for the Olympics, the Hon. Michael Knight NT, nominating Mr Donald McDonald AO and Mr John Valder AO CBE for appointment by the New South Wales Governor to the Board of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games ( SOCOG).</p>
<p>The SOCOG Act provides for the appointment of 15 directors, two of whom the Prime Minister is able to nominate. </p>
<p>I also take the opportunity to re-affirm the Commonwealth Government's undertaking to honour the commitments entered into by the previous Government in relation to Sydney 2000 Olympics and Paralympics.</p>
<p>I will be writing to Premier Carr in the near future outlining the Commonwealth's strong desire to work co-operatively with the New South Wales Government, SOCOG and the Sydney Paralympic; Organising Committee ( SPOC) to ensure the successful staging of the 2000 Giames.</p>
<p>My two nominees have strong credentials for the positions, particularly in the areas of financial management and the broader cultural aspects of this major event.</p>
<p>Mr McDonald, who has been the General Manager of the Australian Opera since 1987, has a wvide business and artistic background and has been nominated with an eye to the longer term cultuiral significance of the Sydney 2000 Games, in particular the cultural Olympiad wvhich is to be conducted over the next four years. Mr McDonald was a member of the Olympic Bid Committee and has been chairman of SOCOG's Cultural Committee since 1994.</p>
<p>Mr Valder, a former chairman of the Sydney Stock Exchange and the New South Wales Australia Day Council from 1989 to 1995, was the principal corporate fund raiser for the Olympic Bid Committee between 1991 and 1993. He is also a former Federal and State President of the Liberal Party. His wide and varied experience in business and politics will make him a valuable addition to the SOCOG Board.</p>
<p>They will replace the previous Prime Minister's representatives on the SOCOG Board,The Hon John Brown AO and Ms Samantha Moyston, who have resigned.</p>
