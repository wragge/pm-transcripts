    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Allow me to welcome the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard,</p>
<p>   good day John, good to see you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, it is very nice to be here.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>It is terrific to see you. And I think you have done the right</p>
<p>   thing in cancelling the trip, I think people would rather have you</p>
<p>   at home at this time?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, that is the decision I came to, I didn't like doing it.</p>
<p>   But to be in Malaysia when decisions might be taken either, that</p>
<p>   as I hoped that the peace effort has bourn fruit, or alternatively</p>
<p>   that it hasn't, I really do need to be on the spot. And I am</p>
<p>   quite sure that the Malaysian Prime Minister understands that. I</p>
<p>   rang him, spoke to him for a while on Saturday afternoon to explain</p>
<p>   the situation and I intend it to be a postponement only because</p>
<p>   Malaysia is an important country. But my place is here.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Well you were the one who sent the troops off.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>You, in fact, were probably the last one to talk to them.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I was.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Their spirits were good when they left?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Their spirits were fantastic. I have to say that as highly trained</p>
<p>   professional soldiers they were eager to go, they were conscious</p>
<p>   of what lay ahead of them, they were a very intelligent bunch of</p>
<p>   men and one woman. Who asked me a lot of questions about the background</p>
<p>   of the Government's decision, not critically but inquiringly,</p>
<p>   and that is good. And they were a very inspiring group of Australians</p>
<p>   to talk to.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Well that Bulletin poll that we talked about last week show the</p>
<p>   majority of Australians approve of our involvement, 64 per cent,</p>
<p>   that is a fair approval rating isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is an approval rating, in the circumstances, better than I</p>
<p>   expected.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>If we have any casualties, and touch wood we don't, do you</p>
<p>   think that approval rating might be watered down considerably?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know but I just hope we don't, I hope it</p>
<p>   doesn't happen. I hope that no shots are fired in anger. I</p>
<p>   am hopeful, out of what the news tells us this morning. My internal</p>
<p>   advice is that we really have to look at the fine print of the agreement</p>
<p>   to be satisfied. And you also have got to ask the question that</p>
<p>   Saddam Hussein is capable of saying one thing and doing another.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Time and time again.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Indeed. And it may well be that what happens is that his commitment</p>
<p>   and that agreement has to be tested by an inspection before people</p>
<p>   can be completely satisfied that he is as good as his word. And</p>
<p>   it is one thing for somebody in his position to sign a document</p>
<p>   saying, I will allow you unhindered access to sites in my country,</p>
<p>   it is another thing for him to actually allow that to occur. And</p>
<p>   there having been a large build up in the Gulf it may well be the</p>
<p>   view of the United States and others, well let us test this agreement,</p>
<p>   if the agreement is what it is apparently suggested it is, before</p>
<p>   we accept that there has been a change of heart.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>One must assume that obviously he has what he shouldn't have</p>
<p>   stored otherwise he would open the doors wide for anybody.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You would assume that. And that has been the basis of my thinking,</p>
<p>   the American thinking and the British thinking and the thinking</p>
<p>   of most Australians. Look what has been on the airwaves this morning</p>
<p>   is encouraging.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Very.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because nobody wants a war. I don't want a war, I really hate</p>
<p>   the very idea of Australian service personnel being exposed to danger.</p>
<p>   I don't want innocent Iraqis killed and that is always a possibility</p>
<p>   no matter how finely honed the strike is. And if the Secretary General's</p>
<p>   mission has been successful, then good on him, good luck to him.</p>
<p>   But it is too early to make that judgement. You have got to see</p>
<p>   what is in the agreement and you have also got to be satisfied that</p>
<p>   the agreement will hold in substance.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Are we simply supporting the United States or are we supporting</p>
<p>   the United Nations first and the United States second?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are supporting the United Nations first. The prime objective</p>
<p>   of what we are doing is to deny Saddam Hussein the capacity to maintain</p>
<p>   and potentially use weapons of mass destruction. Now he has clearly</p>
<p>   got something otherwise, as you rightly say..</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>The doors would be wide open.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If you were being accused by the world of perfidy and you weren't</p>
<p>   guilty of perfidy you would say, come and have a look and you wouldn't</p>
<p>   muck around, would you?</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>No, you wouldn't.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean that defies commonsense and that is why there has been the</p>
<p>   allied military build up. We are not simply complying with the United</p>
<p>   States request, there is a legitimate case.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yes, well there are many people who are saying, we are simply doing</p>
<p>   that, why are we doing it? Well even if we were simply doing that,</p>
<p>   we would be very wise to do it, would we not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well of course we would be but that is not the main reason we are</p>
<p>   doing it. The main reason we are doing it is to deny him the weapons</p>
<p>   of mass destruction. To support the authority of the United Nations,</p>
<p>   and if in the process it sees us working in concert with the United</p>
<p>   States well that is in Australia's national interest.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>What is your view of those Middle Eastern migrants protesting against</p>
<p>   our troops going to the Gulf, rather loudly and to a degree unpleasantly?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What they do of course do quite starkly is demonstrate why Australia</p>
<p>   is the best country in the world. See we allow peaceful dissent</p>
<p>   and this is what it is all about. In an inverse, unintended way</p>
<p>   they are really demonstrating what we stand for. See people can</p>
<p>   do that in this country.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yes they can.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You can peacefully dissent, you can say the Prime Minister is wrong</p>
<p>   and not get shot in the back. Now that is the difference between</p>
<p>   Australia and authoritarian countries like Iraq. Isn't that</p>
<p>   something that is worth defending, isn't that something worth</p>
<p>   standing up for. I saw those people demonstrating and I know some</p>
<p>   people, said oh they shouldn't be doing that, well you have</p>
<p>   a right to say that too and people can disagree. But the fact is</p>
<p>   we allow lawful dissent in this country and we are the stronger</p>
<p>   and the better for it.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Do you approve of the waterside workers doing much the same?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't approve of the waterside workers breaking the law.</p>
<p>   I don't agree with them throwing stones at people going about</p>
<p>   their lawful business. Anybody has the right of lawful dissent but</p>
<p>   equal people have a right to work and you have a right to work on</p>
<p>   the waterfront even if you don't belong to a trade union. You</p>
<p>   have the right to start a new business.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>So where do you draw the line between people who strike, withhold</p>
<p>   their labour and then affect other people who don't want their</p>
<p>   labour withheld. I mean where do you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we have drawn the line, we have drawn the line with a law</p>
<p>   called the Secondary Boycott Law, which exposes people who do that</p>
<p>   sort of thing to very, very severe damages.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Is this going to happen, do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I find what is occurring on the waterfront fascinating. Firstly,</p>
<p>   it is terrific that the farmers have shown the guts.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Don't you think the Government should have shown the guts?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we did, we changed the law.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean the farmers led it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>John we are not stevedores.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>No but, I mean the farmers...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are the Government and our job is to change the law. I mean,</p>
<p>   until my Government came into office it wouldn't have been</p>
<p>   possible for anybody to do what the farmers have done. We made it</p>
<p>   possible. We made it possible for the monopoly on the supply of</p>
<p>   labour by the wharfies, the MUA, to be broken and for non-union</p>
<p>   labour to come on to the waterfront. John Coombs says all along</p>
<p>   that non-union labour has always been welcomed, nonsense. Non-union</p>
<p>   labour has not always been welcome and every man and his dog knows</p>
<p>   that and we changed the law and made it possible. And we showed</p>
<p>   the guts to do that. We got the law through and now, to their eternal</p>
<p>   credit, the farmers of Australia are taking advantage of that new</p>
<p>   law and I applaud what the farmers are doing and I think most Australians</p>
<p>   applaud what the farmers are doing.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Do you think that the farmers and big business and Patricks will</p>
<p>   take action against the union? Because if they do they can break</p>
<p>   the union.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well so far the farmers and Patricks have shown enormous strength.</p>
<p>   Our goal and the farmers goal is not to destroy the MUA. What we</p>
<p>   are intent on doing is to destroy monopoly power on the wharves,</p>
<p>   not the union as such. I have no argument with unionists working</p>
<p>   on the wharves. I have got no argument with members of the MUA working</p>
<p>   on the wharves. My argument is the situation where they have a stranglehold,</p>
<p>   which means that it is more expensive to move goods through our</p>
<p>   wharves than it ought to be, and that is destroying jobs. The end</p>
<p>   test of all of this is whether it will generate jobs for Australians</p>
<p>   and I believe it will.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>It seems that they are going to be quite defiant about it all though?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but they don't have as much public sympathy...</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I think they have none.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...as their rhetoric would claim, I don't think they have</p>
<p>   got any public sympathy, because people can see through it. People</p>
<p>   know that for years they have supported rorts and unproductive practices</p>
<p>   on the wharves. They know that for years Australians have lost jobs</p>
<p>   and have lost export markets because of their behaviour and at long</p>
<p>   last you have got A) a Government with the courage to change the</p>
<p>   law and B) the farmers of Australia to take advantage of the new</p>
<p>   law.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>What can you do if there is a national strike and there is the</p>
<p>   threat of a national strike?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't believe there will be.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because the wharfies understand that there is little public sympathy</p>
<p>   and they don't really have the level of support from the ACTU</p>
<p>   to justify, I think, a prolonged national strike, or to produce</p>
<p>   a prolonged national strike. I hope I am right in that prediction.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Ok, a couple of things, the Federation Trust, we're hearing</p>
<p>   that you're being encouraged to use some of that billion dollar</p>
<p>   fund, the Federation Fund, to buy up the Defence Force land around</p>
<p>   Sydney Harbour and turn it into national park. I think everybody</p>
<p>   would think that it is a terrific idea. Are you heading in that</p>
<p>   direction?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there is an interesting coalition emerging on that, one of</p>
<p>   the strongest supporters of it is Bob Carr.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Bob Carr.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>So, if it does come about I don't think people will be able to</p>
<p>   accuse us of political favouritism because some of the areas where</p>
<p>   the land might be are Liberal held. Look, it is one of the things</p>
<p>   that is being looked at. The foreshores are one of Sydney's</p>
<p>   prized assets, indeed one of the nation's prized assets, and</p>
<p>   we obviously are looking at a number of proposals in that area because</p>
<p>   it would be a great gift to the people of Sydney and to the people</p>
<p>   of Australia, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yeah, that Middle Head area, you wouldn't like to see that</p>
<p>   cut up and sold off to private development, would you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is not the most attractive idea in the world that, no.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Well, if you find it unattractive, is it unlikely it will happen?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I find it very unattractive, you have got to weigh a number</p>
<p>   of things up and we're doing that right at the moment but it</p>
<p>   is a very, it is a jewel in the Australian crown - the Harbour foreshores</p>
<p>   of Sydney - a real jewel in the crown. And it is the sort of thing</p>
<p>   that we could be confident of doing without attracting a political</p>
<p>   controversy because everybody seems to want it. It is a question</p>
<p>   of doing the sums and making sure that it is financially responsible.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yeah well, if you have got all that money, that billion dollars</p>
<p>   of the Federation...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We don't have a lot, oh no, no, but that has come out of the</p>
<p>   sale of Telstra. The sale that the Labor Party so bitterly opposed.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Are you going to call on Telstra to give you some money, to pay</p>
<p>   some dividends?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we are looking at selling some more. The first sale was so</p>
<p>   popular, you know that 92 per cent of the employees of Telstra bought</p>
<p>   shares in that float, 92 per cent, and you had 630,000 Australians</p>
<p>   bought shares for the first time in their lives when they participated</p>
<p>   in that float. </p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Will you now sell the other two thirds of it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it is open to us to do so and we said at the last election</p>
<p>   that if we were to sell more we would say so at the time of the</p>
<p>   next election and get a mandate from the people to do so.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I remember when John Fahey was Premier of NSW, he is now your Finance</p>
<p>   Minister, he demanded big dividends from part privatised agencies,</p>
<p>   do you think that is reasonable in the case of Telstra?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think it is reasonable, of course it is. I think Telstra</p>
<p>   is doing very well but the Australian public has done very well</p>
<p>   out of Telstra. Each one of those mum and dad investors has already</p>
<p>   enjoyed, at a minimum, a capital gain of $1,000 in the few months</p>
<p>   that they have owned those shares. And there was an absolute stampede</p>
<p>   for those shares.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Tell me about it!</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It was fantastic. And you had all these young people, middle aged</p>
<p>   people, old...</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Who had never bought shares before.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It was fantastic and talk about owning a slice of Australia. People</p>
<p>   feel a more direct ownership in something when they personally have</p>
<p>   shares in it than they do being told, oh well look, the Government</p>
<p>   owns it on your behalf. I mean that is a very chilling kind of,</p>
<p>   cold and personal kind of share ownership.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>When are the next two thirds going to be sold?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we haven't made a decision to sell the whole lot. </p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Could you give it a bit thought? Sort of now.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have given a lot of thought to it, John. Look I am, you know</p>
<p>   my views on privatisation, but you have got to take into account</p>
<p>   the capacity of markets to digest, you have got to take into account</p>
<p>   the phasing of things but clearly, the part privatisation of Telstra</p>
<p>   has been a win for the Australian public. It's been a win for</p>
<p>   the shareholders and it has been a win for the company because the</p>
<p>   company is now more competitive.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Do you think that the climate, economically, has changed, the investment</p>
<p>   climate has changed, because of the collapse in Asia and do you</p>
<p>   feel that you need to tread a bit more wearily because of this?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well only a little more wearily when we were already treading wearily.</p>
<p>   I think there is a feeling in the community that thank god the Government</p>
<p>   got the budget in order. We inherited a $10.5 billion deficit and</p>
<p>   we are now heading for a surplus after three years. Now, if we had</p>
<p>   ignored that deficit, as what the Labor Party told us to do and</p>
<p>   pretended it didn't exist, as Kim Beazley does, then I think</p>
<p>   we would have been a lot more vulnerable. World financial markets</p>
<p>   are both instantaneous and unforgiving.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>You don't think the collapse in Asia is going to have a drastic</p>
<p>   affect on Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I wouldn't say drastic, obviously it has some flow through,</p>
<p>   but the flow through would have been greater and we would now be</p>
<p>   feeling the pain of it if we hadn't got our own economic house</p>
<p>   in pretty good order.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>I have talked to property investment people who are concerned that</p>
<p>   there would have been a lot of Asian investment, a lot of buying</p>
<p>   off plans, particularly in Brisbane and in Sydney, with development</p>
<p>   that may now not come to fruition, which could affect the property</p>
<p>   market. Do you have a feeling on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is one way of looking at it, another way of looking at</p>
<p>   it is that some of those investors might choose to invest even more</p>
<p>   so, overseas, than in their own economies. It depends a bit on the</p>
<p>   individual. If you are an Australian investor with a lot of money</p>
<p>   and the Australian economy were doing badly and a neighbouring economy</p>
<p>   were doing very well, you might be inclined to invest in the neighbouring</p>
<p>   economy, mightn't you?</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yes, that is true.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>So, it really does cut both ways. Increasingly, Australia is being</p>
<p>   seen as a very strong country, economically, and a country that</p>
<p>   has taken some hard fundamental economic decisions, they might not</p>
<p>   have been popular - some of them weren't - but they have prepared</p>
<p>   us well for what has happened in Asia and for the medium and longer</p>
<p>   term, it looks a lot brighter than it would otherwise have been.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Just back to domestic matters again, this Telstra thing, what sort</p>
<p>   of dividend would you look from for Telstra?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, a healthy one. I can't really, just off the top of my</p>
<p>   head, put a figure on it. Look, Telstra is doing well. As the, still</p>
<p>   the principle shareholder, we're entitled to a decent dividend</p>
<p>   but what is really good is that we're spreading the joy around.</p>
<p>   The shareholders are getting a capital gain and everybody is happy.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>And you will get a dividend?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course we should.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yeah, well I think you should. Another domestic matter. You can't</p>
<p>   be too happy about the Auditor-General looking at the allocation</p>
<p>   of grants.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What, for the Natural Heritage Trust?</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't mind that all.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Don't you find it a bit concerning. I do understand that the</p>
<p>   Coalition has the majority of rural seats. But when they account</p>
<p>   for something like 90 per cent of the allocation of the Heritage</p>
<p>   Trust Fund compared with six per cent for Labor seats, I mean, doesn't</p>
<p>   that cause you some concern? Maybe on the surface, it surely must?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, not if you understand a couple of things about this Natural</p>
<p>   Heritage Trust. The first thing you've got to understand about</p>
<p>   it is that the Labor Party's never liked it. So this attack</p>
<p>   on it is really an attack on the Fund.</p>
<p>LAWS:</p>
<p>Well, you've only given t</p>
