FOR PRESS: PM 103/ 1971<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MR.-WILLIAM McMAHON<br />
ON THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR<br />
The Government has decided to establish the market<br />
rate-for the Australian dollar on the U. S. dollar at an<br />
appreciation of 6.32% on the Previous parity relationship. This<br />
means an overall depreciation in relation to the parities of our<br />
trading partners as a whole of approximately 1.75%.<br />
On this basis, the Government has decided that the<br />
Reserve Bank will fix market limits for buying and selling centering<br />
on a mid point of U. S. $ 1.1910 equals $ 1 Australian.<br />
The Government has also decided that, in future,<br />
exchange rates for the Australian dollar will be fixed on the<br />
Uni ' ted States dollar rather than on sterling as has previously<br />
been~ the Practice. on this basis the daily quotations for the<br />
Australian dollar will maintain a fixed relationship with the<br />
U. S.,-dollar. Turning to the other aspect, i. e. the gold parity, and<br />
havihg in mind the margin of 2h% about parity recently approved<br />
by ti-i International Monetary Fund, the Government's decision is<br />
consistent with the maintenance of AustrAlia's gold parity in the<br />
Fund. Australia's gold parity shows an appreciation of 8.57% on the<br />
previous'parity relationship with the U. S. dollar. The gold parity<br />
of a country's currency is, of course, a matter for its own<br />
determination. Nevertheless, as a member of the international<br />
Monetary Fund Australia, like other members, also has an obligation<br />
under the Articles of Agreement of the Fund to obtain the Fund's<br />
concurrence to any change we might wish to make in the parity of the<br />
Australian dollar. Having regard to the Present strength of our<br />
balance of payments, there would not have been any possibility of<br />
demonstrating to the Fund that we are suffering from a fundamental<br />
disequilibrium, the condition that must be satisfied to gain the<br />
Fund' s concurrence. At the same time, however, the Government has noted that<br />
the strength of the balance of payments over the past eighteen mor-. hs<br />
has been the result, in no small measure, of an extraordinarily high<br />
rate of capital inflow. The Government has already indicated its<br />
concern as to some aspects of this matter by its public indication<br />
that it has the whole subject under urgent examination. .9e./ 2 </p>
<p>We shall. in fact be pressing ahead with that examination and I can<br />
say now that we will not hesitate to take what action we consider<br />
to be necessary. The changes in international exchange rates will<br />
adversely affect some of the rural industries in which producers<br />
re. already experiencing difficult times. The Government is<br />
therefore.. prepared to. examine and consider the position of those<br />
rural. industries which are-seriously affected.<br />
