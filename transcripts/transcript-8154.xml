    <content><![CDATA[<p>6 OctoberÂ 1990</p>
<p>Sixteen months ago, I stood with many others in the GreatÂ Hall of this Parliament House, to remember with sorrow andÂ outrage the brutal massacre that polluted Tiananmen Square<br />and disfigured the face of China in the eyes of the world.Â As we meet tonight, those terrible events still cast a darkÂ shadow over us.</p>
<p>The bright candle of democracy that in May and June 1989 hadÂ shone so brightly, in Beijing, Shanghai, and elsewhereÂ throughout China, remains snuffed out. The path towardsÂ freedom and human rights that was then being opened up,<br />remains blocked.</p>
<p>And of course those thousands of young Chinese citizens whoÂ were so brutally killed by their own leaders live no moreÂ except in our memory, where their vision of a better futureÂ remains fresh and bright.</p>
<p>China's decision, in the late 1970's, to embark on new,Â outward-looking, and more liberal policies especially inÂ the economic sphere put it years ahead of other centrallyÂ planned economies.</p>
<p>This preparedness to enhance the basic well being of theÂ Chinese people through modernisation, openness and, in<br />particular, contact with the West, laid the foundations for<br />the exceptionally close relationships that developed with<br />Australia in the 1980' s and which my Government did all it<br />could to foster.</p>
<p>What a tragedy it is not just for China but for China's<br />relationship with Australia that those policies of<br />liberalisation, and that exceptionally close relationship,<br />were brought to a premature end by the events in Tian'anmen<br />Square. Yet in the face of all these real and profound reasons for<br />sorrow, we * meet tonight in a spirit of companionship and<br />even, of relative confidence for the future.</p>
<p>That confidence has three strong sources.<br />First, there is the knowledge that Australia is doing what<br />we can as a nation to reverse the unacceptable conditions<br />that prevail within China today.<br />Second, there is the knowledge that we have safeguarded the<br />future of those Chinese residents who were stranded in<br />Australia sixteen months ago.<br />And third, there is the knowledge that as the world changes<br />so dramatically, so in time must change inevitably come to<br />China too. Because surely the fundamental lesson taught to<br />us by the recent events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet<br />Union is that economic and political freedoms go hand in<br />hand; and to the extent that China today is continuing to<br />achieve economic liberalisation, that attempt cannot<br />ultimately succeed unless it is accompanied by social and<br />political freedoms.<br />I know you share the confidence derived from those three<br />sources, and I appreciate both your expression of support<br />for what the Australian Government has done, and is doing,<br />in the wake of these terrible events in China, and the<br />opportunity you have given me to speak on these matters this<br />evening. In the days following Tian'anmen I gave, you recall, two<br />firm undertakings.<br />First, I said that no resident of the People's Republic of<br />China in Australia at the time of the massacre would be<br />forced to return to China against his or her will. Second,<br />and of equal importance, I said that no-one would be forced<br />into making a premature choice between China and Australia.<br />Those undertakings were borne out in the subsequent<br />decisions of Federal Cabinet and I want to acknowledge, in<br />Gerry Hand's presence tonight, his crucial role in reaching<br />those decisions.<br />Residents of the PRC in Australia on 20 June 1989 will be<br />able to remain in Australia for four years under a special<br />category of temporary residence permit. The conditions<br />under which they can remain are as generous as any granted<br />by any country in the world. Holders of these special<br />permits are allowed to work. They can apply for their<br />spouses and dependent children to join them in Australia.<br />They are provided with access to social services, labour<br />market programs, English language training and education.<br />But the door also remains open for those who want to return<br />home to China. A significant number have already done so.<br />But many others need time to think about their future; to<br />watch developments in their homeland; to seek assurances for<br />their safety. We have given them that time.</p>
<p>The situation for PRC residents who have come to Australia<br />since June 1989 is equally clear. They can apply and<br />numbers are applying for refugee status on exactly the<br />same conditions as all other refugee applications.<br />These decisions were correct morally, administratively and<br />economically. They were right for those Chinese residents<br />directly affected; they had the overwhelming support of you,<br />Australians of Chinese descent; and I confidently predict<br />that they will come to be seen as right for Australia. For<br />those Chinese who stay will undoubtedly contribute<br />significantly to the well-being of our economy and our<br />country. There is really only one group that has looked upon the<br />decisions with some dismay and that is, not surprisingly,<br />the Chinese leadership, which has responded with assurances<br />about the safety of students who return home to China.<br />Such assurances can ultimately only be assessed by<br />individuals as they make their own decision about whether or<br />not to return to China; if they turn out to be well-founded<br />assurances and I want to make clear I hope they will<br />many more will no doubt be encouraged to return. But the<br />point is that it is up to the individuals to decide; our<br />arrangements to give them time to decide will remain in<br />place. So let the Australian message be very clear. We do not want<br />China to continue down the path of repression. We want to<br />see China resume the path of reform and modernisation. As<br />Australians, we will do all we can to discourage the former<br />and to encourage the latter.</p>
<p>This determination has underpinned all we have said and doneÂ as a Government since June 1989.</p>
<p>Australia has enduring interests political, strategic and<br />economic interests in our relations with China, derived<br />from our geographical position, our trading environment, and<br />from our wide variety of people-to-people links.<br />As early as July last year, we made the fundamental decision<br />to keep open Australia's lines of access to as many sections<br />of Chinese society as possible, and to maintain economic,<br />educational and cultural exchanges. To do otherwise to<br />embark on a policy of mindless isolation of those in China<br />with whom we can cooperate and maintain bridges of dialogue<br />would not be in our interests, or the interests of the<br />people of China for whose future we deeply care.</p>
<p>So in the months that have followed we have, withÂ considerable success, encouraged China to contribute to aÂ peaceful resolution of the tragedy of Cambodia; we haveÂ voiced our support for China's participation, with theÂ economies of Hong Kong and Taiwan, in the process of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation which I launched in Canberra inÂ November last year. We have hosted a visit to Australia byÂ the Chinese Minister to Metallurgical Industry last May forÂ the opening of the Channar Iron-Ore Joint Venture, and theÂ Australian Minister for Trade Negotiations, Dr Blewett,Â visited China recently for discussions about our keyÂ economic interests.</p>
<p>But at the same time as we have done all this, we haveÂ maintained our emphatic, consistent and principledÂ opposition to the continuing repression of democracy and the<br />suppression of human rights in China.<br />We have taken every opportunity, in bilateral and<br />multilateral forums, to make known this opposition to the<br />Chinese. And it was plain that the Government's judgement,<br />at this stage, that Dr Blewett should not meet with the<br />Chinese Premier was a most eloquent and effective statement<br />of our views.<br />While we recognise that ministerial contacts actively<br />contribute to the pursuit of the enduring interests to which<br />I have referred, we allow such contacts only after a<br />considered analysis of the balance of Australia's interests.<br />Such assessments involve real difficulties, including the<br />incidental difficulty of leaving the Government open to the<br />cheap shot from those in the Federal Opposition who find it<br />easy to theorise but who do not have to implement their<br />policies in the real world.<br />But let no one doubt that we will continue to pursue<br />Australia's interests with diligence and judgement,<br />including our very real desire for China to resume its<br />process of reform, and to realise its huge potential.<br />I know many of you will be meeting tomorrow with members of<br />the Federal Opposition. That's entirely appropriate, and I<br />am sure it will be a stimulating meeting. May I preface<br />that meeting with a few comments about Dr Hewson's views on<br />China. I have read the press reports of Dr Hewson's recent visit to<br />China the suggestion that he accepted the Chinese<br />assurances about the safety of students who return to China;<br />his rejection of a special visa category for Chinese<br />students in Australia in favour of an impractical and<br />undesirable case-by-case approach; and his extraordinary<br />characterisation of some Chinese students in Australia as<br />" shish kebab" students. These are all of some concern to<br />me.</p>
<p>But when you look beyond these various elements at the basic<br />view Dr Hewson seems to have about how Australia should deal<br />with China, you find an even more surprising thing. Because<br />when you boil it all down, what Dr Hewson apparently<br />advocates is that we should push the Chinese hard on human<br />rights, while seeking openings for continued commercial<br />contacts. In other words, you have the basic elements of<br />the Government's policy that we have pursued since July last<br />year. Now I could say I welcome Dr Hewson's support. But frankly<br />I'm disturbed by the Opposition Leader's apparent attempt to<br />carve out a separate partisan position where there is no<br />essential policy difference in overall posture towards<br />China. Grandstanding is a cheap trick but in foreign policy terms<br />it's an unwise one. Dr Hewson has not yet plugged his<br />credibility gap on foreign policy, and he certainly has not<br />displayed any sense that he understands the totality of this<br />country's interests in regard to China.<br />The fundamental fact is this: the Australian Government has<br />responded to the tragic reversals in China decisively and<br />appropriately. We are doing what we must to ensure China<br />sinks no further into the past. And no one will be happier<br />than I will be when China can once more resume a totally<br />positive involvement in the region and the world.<br />My friends,<br />Since Gold Rush days, Chinese migrants and their descendants<br />have played an important part in Australia's history. In an<br />often hostile environment they have helped to build the<br />wealth of our nation and the richness of our community.<br />I want to say, tonight that Chinese Australians have much<br />more to contribute to Australia's future.<br />One of the underlying principles of my Government's National<br />Agenda for a Multicultural Australia is that it is in the<br />interests of all Australians that we fully use the valuable<br />skills and talents of our ethnic communities.<br />I know that multiculturalism means different things to<br />different people. But of one thing there can be no doubt.<br />Australia today is a culturally diverse society in which<br />four out of every ten people were born overseas or have<br />parents born overseas.<br />And we are a richer nation for it. Australia today has an<br />excitement and vibrancy which is the equal of any country in<br />the world.</p>
<p>6.<br />Last year I launched the Garnaut Report on Australia's ties<br />with North East Asia. The report underlined the fact that<br />our trading partnerships will be enhanced by a greater<br />understanding of the different values and cultures of the<br />countries we deal with. And it noted that Australia's Asian<br />communities are a key resource which needs to be employed to<br />assist us in involving ourselves in the economic, social and<br />political life of our region.<br />So the Chinese-Australian community has a special role to<br />play. Your understanding of Asian society, the language<br />skills that you have maintained and passed to your children,<br />coupled with your undoubted commitment to this nation, can<br />only enhance our ability to build a stronger position for us<br />in our region. That is multiculturalism at work.<br />Friends I am aware that many of you have travelled to Canberra from<br />Cabramatta. As many of you will be aware, the " Pailau"<br />Beautification Association plans to erect a ceremonial<br />Chinese archway at the entrance to the Cabramatta Mall.<br />The plan features a pair of golden bronze lions to mark the<br />entry, according to ancient Chinese tradition.</p>
<p>Just outside the House of Representatives, two marble lionsÂ stand in the Chinese gardens, a gift from the people ofÂ China to mark the opening of the New Parliament House.Â The lion, a symbolic guardian of the community, is a symbol<br />both of your commitment to Australia and of Australia'sÂ commitment to a multicultural society.Â It is in that spirit that I am pleased to announce myÂ personal support for the Cabramatta Pailau Committee's plansÂ and to dedicate one of the lions to Australia'sÂ multicultural future.</p>
<p>And it is in that spirit that I express my appreciation forÂ your invitation to address you this evening, and my bestÂ wishes for your safe return home.</p>
