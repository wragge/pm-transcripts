COMMONWEALTH OF. AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEEC JA<br />
BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
F Ill AIRCRAFT<br />
( Ministerial Statement)<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 23 September 1969]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-This House will know that the<br />
Government recently sent a high level mission<br />
to the United States of America to<br />
discuss matters concerning F1 11 aircraft.<br />
That mission has now submitted its report<br />
to the Government and the Government<br />
has considered it. However, before detailing<br />
the matters discussed and the<br />
conclusions reached there is one matter<br />
which I believe should be made clear.<br />
Because of the great publici * ty which has<br />
been given to any accident in which any<br />
Fll aircraft has been involved there has<br />
grown up a feeling that the aircraft is itself<br />
unsafe. The record shows that this belief<br />
is simply* not true. The United States Air<br />
Force fleet of Fl 11 aircraft have now<br />
been flying for a total of more than 40,000<br />
hours, including more than 25,000 hours in<br />
the, operational command, and it now has<br />
an accident record better, for example, than<br />
the Super Sabre or the Phantom and better<br />
than any other F century series of aircraft.<br />
On the record the aircraft is not unsafe<br />
and this should be known.<br />
The matters discussed by the mission<br />
related to the aircraft's range, its weapons<br />
load, the assurance of a continuing supply<br />
of spare parts during its service life and<br />
the fatigue performance of the wing carry<br />
through box. Our military advisers are<br />
completely satisfied that the range and<br />
22518/ 69 weapons load of the aircraft will meet the<br />
requirements of the Air Force, as set down<br />
when the decision to order the aircraft was<br />
made. It will do the job which the Air<br />
Force wanted an aircraft to do. Our<br />
military advisers are also completely satisfied<br />
that there will continue to be a full<br />
availability of spares, readily available,<br />
during the full period of service of this<br />
aircraft with the Royal Australian Air<br />
Force. Furthermore, our advice is that the Fll,<br />
both in practice and during operations, has<br />
demonstrated a capacity to deliver a bomb<br />
load in any weather conditions with unprecedented<br />
accuracy, whether the target can<br />
be seen or not. For this purpose it is the<br />
best aircraft in the world, and our military<br />
advisers after evaluating other possible aircraft<br />
types tell us that there is not in being<br />
or in prospect any aircraft that would<br />
approach the already.. demonstrated performance<br />
of the Fl 11I as a strike aircraft<br />
of the kind the RAAF requires.<br />
The Government believes that the RAAF<br />
must have an ultra modem bomber strike<br />
aircraft to replace the Canberras which are<br />
now the RAAF's only strike force. The<br />
Government knows that the Canberras are<br />
approaching the limit of their service life,<br />
and the considerations which I have set<br />
out above all point to the Fll as the best<br />
aircraft to be this replacement, without<br />
exception. </p>
<p>But there remains the problem of the<br />
fatigue performance of the wing carry<br />
through box. This has been a matter of<br />
concern to us because it indicates that we<br />
would not get the length of service from<br />
the aircraft which we require, or anything<br />
approaching it; and our concern has been<br />
shared by the United States Air Force,<br />
although the United States already has over<br />
120 F111 aircraft operating with the<br />
present wing box.<br />
As a result of this concern two matters<br />
are in progress. Firstly, the wing box which<br />
gave an insufficiently long life under test<br />
has been modified as a result of information<br />
gained and is to begin a new series of<br />
fatigue tests next month. Secondly, more<br />
far reaching activity has been undertaken<br />
to overcome the fatigue problems identified<br />
as limiting the service life of the aircraft.<br />
Action has been comprehensive and has<br />
included the participation of groups of<br />
technical experts from universities, industry<br />
and government, all. participating in detailed<br />
reviews of the test results and the proposed<br />
actions to resolve those technical problems.<br />
These groups, Mr Speaker, have been<br />
assisted by Australian structural experts.<br />
As a result of these investigations a new<br />
design of the wing carry through box is<br />
under way and it is intended that this new<br />
design will be fitted to Fill aircraft by<br />
1972. But, of course, the new design box,<br />
which our mission has advised us it confidently<br />
expects to be successful, has not yet<br />
been proved in practice. The question posed<br />
now is whether we should accept our F 1 ls<br />
with the modified wing box which is due<br />
to begin testing next month. If we do it<br />
is expected that this box will give our Fl 1 ls<br />
a longer service life than the present wing<br />
box but not the length of service life we<br />
require. Modifications seen to be required<br />
would be made to the wing boxes already<br />
fitted to our aircraft without additional cost<br />
to the RAAF.<br />
The Government has decided that, provided<br />
the modified wing box to be tested<br />
next month lives up to expectations, we<br />
should accept the aircraft. This, however,<br />
is conditional on an agreement which has<br />
already been reached that whatever ii<br />
needed to finally overcome the wing bo<br />
problem will'be incorporated in our aircraft<br />
at the appropriate time and at no<br />
increase to the ceiling price under the formula applicable to the purchase of our<br />
aircraft. That is to say that unless the<br />
modified wing box we now propose to<br />
accept meets the endurance requirements<br />
for which it is designed, the United States<br />
Air Force will replace it with the new<br />
design box to be available in 1972-again<br />
with no increase to the ceiling price under<br />
the formula applicable to the purchase of<br />
the aircraft.<br />
A further safeguard is the agreement that<br />
should one or more of the wing boxes we<br />
now propose to accept become unserviceable<br />
due to a design deficiency before the<br />
new design wing box is ready for fitting<br />
then the United States will replace those<br />
boxes at no cost to us-and as often as<br />
may be necessary until the new wing box<br />
is available for fitting.<br />
As a result of these agreements we have<br />
therefore decided to accept delivery of our<br />
FllIs as soon as the fatigue tests to begin<br />
next month have proved successful. We<br />
believe that in so doing we will be greatly<br />
strengthening the defence capacity of Australia<br />
and that the remaining problems of<br />
the aircraft which is not one of safety but<br />
of service life will have been overcome by<br />
the arrangements to fit new boxes or to fit<br />
replacement boxes until the new boxes are<br />
ready. I believe I should, in this statement,<br />
remind honourable members that the<br />
arrangements made with the United States<br />
Air Force for these aircraft were that the<br />
ceiling price was to be $ US5.95m plus<br />
escalation of labour costs and materials<br />
after 1965, plus modifications requested by<br />
the RAAF and improvement modifications<br />
proposed by the USAF and accepted by the<br />
RAAF. The combined effect of this item<br />
will approximate $ USI. 5m per aircraft. I<br />
would also add that the USAF has decided<br />
to go to an RF1 I IA version for the reconnaissance<br />
aircraft and that this decision now<br />
makes it possible for the RAAF to proceed<br />
to a reconnaissance version of the F lC,<br />
as originally contemplated, which will be<br />
common with the reconnaissance aircraft in<br />
the USAF inventory. Before, however, the<br />
Government makes a decision on this<br />
matter we would require far more information<br />
as to costs.<br />
Sir, I hope the House and the country<br />
iwill agree that our Air Force needs a strike<br />
Sbomber most effective in operations. I hope </p>
<p>they will accept the advice of our military<br />
experts that the F111 is far and away the<br />
best such bomber available, and I believe<br />
they will agree that our acceptance of the<br />
bomber subject to the conditions I have set<br />
out will be a powerful addition to our capacity to defend ourselves in time of<br />
need. May I add, Mr Speaker, that should<br />
the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr<br />
Barnard) wish time to study this statement<br />
and to reply to it tomorrow, then that time<br />
will be accorded to him.<br />
