Wcould become an election Issue in the final week?<br />
PRIME MINISTERt I have reacted, I have with controlled anger<br />
Jaufdteyr. haTvhine g aknnsowwenr tthoa t yothuirs qhuaess tiboene n isi n ptrheseu maraebnlya Mfor. r sPoemaec octw, eo<br />

say is that he is being recklessly opportunistic in deliberately<br />
misrepresenting what thin proposalt is about. The proposal Ins<br />
something which has certain principles laid down about it, and<br />
one of those fundamental principles in that anything that may<br />
develop should not be in any sense an enclave because such a<br />
concept is abhorrent to everything for which I and the Government<br />
and I believe the people of Australia stand. So those have been<br />
commissioned from Government and indust ryt and we have all our<br />
leading business enterprises involved in this# have the clear<br />
agnudi diynegt phreirnec icpolmee st hMatr. thPeeraceo ciks tsoi xb ed anyos sbuegfgoerset iaoMn eolfe catni oenn# c laavned<br />
says he's against this because he's against the concept of an<br />
enclave. Mrs Peacock was given the opportiu~ ity Judy, laist<br />
September, to be fully briefed personally on eve~ ything involved<br />
in this, he declined that opportunity to be so briefed. And it<br />
is very interesting now that you have the situation today where<br />
his col league in the State of New South wales has repudiated himu,<br />
Mr.-: reiner has completely repudiated him.<br />
TIERNEY; Yes well Mr. Greiner is in favour of course.<br />
PM: As is any reasonable person in favour of what is happening<br />
and what is happening is that a concept is being investigated.<br />
No decision has been made but what is being investigated is<br />
Simple this is there a way in which Australia can attract to It </p>
<p>-2<br />
PH conts in a very concentrated f orm, the leading edge<br />
technology not only of Japan but of the United State. and, ofE<br />
Europe so that there can be united with an increasingly educated<br />
and trained Australian workforce the best technology of the rest<br />
of the world, and anyone who purports to lead a major political<br />
party in this country and who says now just an the eve of aim<br />
election for obvious opportunistic reasons, that they would cut<br />
dead the investigation into the possibility of attracting leading<br />
technology to Australia, in being grossly irresponsible.<br />
TIERNEY1 All that accepted, I think the interesting thing is<br />
that it's become such a big deal simply because there's perhaps<br />
nothing else has taken off as an issue in the loot few days up to<br />
the election?<br />
PM; No I wouldn't put it that way Judy, I wouldn't put it that<br />
way at all. if you look for instance at today's Australian<br />
nespaper, both the front page article by Paul Kelly, respected<br />
political journalist, and the editorial of the Australian, what<br />
has seized theme people and others I might say, is the enormity,<br />
the sheer enormity and reckless adventurism and opportunism of<br />
Mr. Peacock, and these people are repudiating it. Not in terms<br />
of wanting to take sides with the Government but simply in terms<br />
of looking at Australia's future interests. They are Saying if<br />
there is one thing that Australia must do that's going to protect<br />
the future for our children and their children is to make sure<br />
that we get the best technology into Australia so that we can add<br />
to our great extractive industries and our rural industries and<br />
increasingly competent manufacturing industry and services<br />
industry. And to do that we' ve got to ally to our own resources,<br />
human and natural resources, we have to ally the best available<br />
technology. And what these people are saying it in almost beyond<br />
belief. The man who leads a major party and who aspires to the<br />
prime ministership of this country should so recklessly put at<br />
risk the future interests of this country, This is not a<br />
peripheral issue.<br />
TIERNEY: Apart from that though, most commentators are as one in<br />
declaring this as a particularly boring campaign?<br />
PM Well I can't really recall an election over recent years in<br />
which the media hasn't said that. I mean let me say this, we ais<br />
pol.. ticians have to accept responsibility to a very large extent<br />
f or what the calibre of the campaign is. But to some extent tthe<br />
media has to too. Let me make one particular paint, as you ' ve<br />
opened up with an issue Judy, properly which has international </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PH contt implications, the Multi-Function Polis. I have in the<br />
early parts of the campaign at times tried to talk aboult<br />
international aspects of Australia's position as related to thisa<br />
campaign( but the media hasn't been interested at all in talkin,<br />
about those issues. Now I think that the internationaLI<br />
ramifications of the position of the Government and of the<br />
Opposition are terribly interesting and very important for the<br />
future of Australia, but the media doesn't seem to be interested<br />
in carrying anything about it. Now I can't do anything about<br />
that. TIERNEY$ So what do our, listeners think then. Good morning<br />
Edward.<br />
CALLER: Hello. Mr. Hawke my question is on superannuation.<br />
PM: Yes Edward.<br />
CALLERS Mr. Hawke, on the Nine Network program on Sunday the<br />
eleventh of March, when you were asked if some super funds would<br />
be worse off because of the capital gains tax you said no. You<br />
said the superannuation funds can totally use imputation credits<br />
to offset the fifteen per cent tax. Mr. Hawks this statement is<br />
not correct, not truly correct$ an it does not apply to the many<br />
superannuation funds which are capital guaranteed and only invest<br />
in government and bank-backed securities. As these capital<br />
TIERNEYs Thank you Edward. I think that's quite, get to the<br />
point please and perhaps the Prime Minister would like to answer<br />
it.<br />
PM: Well Edward, let me say this. what has been said in a sense<br />
more importantly than what I've said, look at what's been said by<br />
the major funds the AMP, National Mutual, they've said they<br />
didn't pay any tax in this last year on their super funds and<br />
they've made it quite clear, as is the fact, that because of the<br />
decisions that we made in 1988 Edward, it is up to the management<br />
of the funds to use the law, the provisions of the law in a way<br />
which is going to maximise the benefit for their fund members.<br />
And the simple indisputable fact is this that if a fund chooses<br />
to use the opportunity of investing in Australian equities, which<br />
is _ what we were about in 1988 to increase the fund of savings for<br />
Auiivalian business so that this would reduce the reliance on<br />
overseas borrowings, if they do that they can get the full<br />
strength of imputation credits, And that's the law and that's<br />
what increasingly competitive funds will have to do. </p>
<p>TXERNRYt Thank you Edward. We've got a number of calls, tharik<br />
you very much Edward. Good morning Leigh.<br />
CALLERt Good morning. Mr. Hawke my question gets back to theo<br />
business of manufacturing exports for Australia.<br />
PM: Yes Leigh.<br />
CALLER3 I'd like to commend obviously the initiatives th~ e<br />
government in terms of the leading edge technology and the<br />
science research area.# but 10d put it to you that much of tthe<br />
outcome of that is quite a few year. away, you know# in other<br />
words a lonq lead time to got results from that sort of effort-,<br />
Iem not saying that we shouldn't be making that sort Of effort.<br />
But there are in my view and my immediate experience marty<br />
0 manufacturers or many potential manufacturers with good Ideas<br />
that need to be taken into the worldwide market and yet where<br />
they can't because of the small nature of the Australian markets<br />
the sm4ll size of the market here, they can't got those produclts<br />
out there without some sort of assistance. The film industry got<br />
a one hundred and fifty per cent tax credit, what's wrong with<br />
helping small manufacturers vith new products, new inventions?<br />
TIERNEYt We finally got to the question there. I think the<br />
Prime Minister understands it.<br />
PM: Leigh, I do understand your question. Let me just briefly<br />
refer to the first part of your observations and then come to the<br />
guts of your question. It is the case Leigh of course, that wit~ h<br />
these fifty cooperative research centres that we've setting up<br />
we're going to bring together the beat research capacities of<br />
C8IRO and the universities and the private sector# and I'm<br />
terribly excited about this as is the scientific community.<br />
You're right in Baying we wont get the results tomorrow about<br />
V that but we'll start to create these centres very, very quickly<br />
indeed and I believe it's going to, in the medium to longer term,<br />
have an enormously positive impact upon developing our<br />
Manufacturing export capacity. But coming then particularly to<br />
what you've been saying, we have taken Account of what you're<br />
talking about by adding to the existing scheme which is the<br />
Export Market Development Grant Scheme. We are now adding tie<br />
nebl4L: cheme which we outlined early in the campaign which is<br />
caflvulated directly to take account of what you say. That is b~ y<br />
acknowledging that there are some very swall enterprises which b~ y<br />
themselves may not be able to have the impetus or the </p>
<p>0 5<br />
PM contt dynamic to take advantage of assistance. We are making<br />
provisions whereby associations can bring together groups of<br />
small businesses to get the advantage of the financial assistance<br />
that we are prepared to make available. go you're right in<br />
saying that we need some imagination, new direction in this and<br />
that's precisely what the new scheme is directed to doing Leigh.<br />
TIERNEYt Thank you very much Leigh, and good morning Peter.<br />
CALLERi Yes, good morning, Good morning Mr. Hawke.<br />
P1s Good morning Peter,<br />
CALLER: I voted for a change seven years ago and I'd like to<br />
congratulate you and your team for the excellent Job you've<br />
performed in turning around our economy and our overall livin~ g<br />
standards which X feel have definitely improved. However three<br />
yars ago you asked a percentage of the Australian population who<br />
had decided to either refinance their mortgages or become new<br />
homeowners to suffer for the surge in the economy which youir<br />
government was responsible for. I for one, have done so during<br />
this period and have found it progressively harder as mortgage<br />
rates have increased. The question I'd like you to answer for ge<br />
if you can, is why have our percentage of the population of<br />
Australia had to do our bit, pull our horns in to put it bluntly,<br />
while the remainder of the population who in large I guess would<br />
have smaller mortgages than those with floating interest rate.,<br />
have not had to suffer these mortgage increases. Why<br />
TIERNEY: Thank you Peter, I think the Prime Minister understands<br />
69<br />
CALLERs Why can you not give us some tax relief from the<br />
interest rate we pay over thirteen and a half per cent, or<br />
alternatively after three years lift the thirteen and a half per<br />
cent ceiling which will probably drop the rate slightly?<br />
PMs Peter, a fair question. Let me make these points. It's a<br />
complex area of issues that you've raised. Lot me go to thlLs<br />
question of, part of what you're putting about possible<br />
deductions in tax in relationship to interest. That was<br />
something that was raised last year, you'll recall, when Xr.<br />
Peacock started his mini campaign and it was soon dropped becauise<br />
/ 66.9 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM conts as we know from our work that we'd done in Treasury<br />
there were just so many complications on both sides of the ledger<br />
that it's simply not possible to do it. Lot me now go to the<br />
point more generally though Peter that in this economy it was i<br />
situation where the level of demand had increased so much in the<br />
housing area and the investment area that, if I could give you<br />
just a simple statistic Peter, in that last year consumption in<br />
Australia had increased by eight per cent and our production had<br />
only increased by four per cent so we had, right across the board<br />
Peter, in the area of housing, in the area of other investment,,<br />
in the area of consumption more generally, we had to tighten<br />
monetary policy, lift interest rates so that we brought down the<br />
overall level of activity, in housing included because if we<br />
hadn't done that Australia would have continued to have a leveL<br />
Of imports which was simply unsustainable. And Peter it wasn't<br />
as though we didn't have the other two arms of policy fairlir<br />
tight that is fiscal policy, for the fourth successive year mfp<br />
government as distinct from the blatantly dishonest advertising<br />
that I saw on television last night from Professor Hewson where,<br />
he said we weren't cutting government expenditure. We've done<br />
what's never been done before, four successive years of real<br />
reductions, a seventeen billion dollar surplus, so that we were|<br />
doing our bit there to try and help the savings exercise. And,,<br />
as you know, restrain wages policy, we still had to tighten<br />
monetary policy. The important point for the future Peter, is<br />
this. That as a result of the tough decisions we've taken, and<br />
which you have shared in and I acknowledge the hardshipi<br />
involved, the banking system itself is now saying that and<br />
that interest rates will be coming off under the governmentus<br />
policies straight after the election. But the alternative Peter,<br />
i that with a wages blow-out and the blowing of the budget<br />
surplus which is involved in Peacock's policies, there must be<br />
not Just a maintenance of high interest rates but a further<br />
increase. Those are the unavoidable facts.<br />
TIERNEYs Thank you very much Peter. And it's interesting that<br />
we haven't had any calls on the MFP, on the Multi-Function Polis,<br />
very interesting indeed. Good morning Reg.<br />
CALLERs Cueod morning Prime Minister.<br />
PMi__ Good morning Reg. </p>
<p>-7<br />
CALLERt I would have to preface my question by saying that Itm ak<br />
f if ty-three year old chap who at the moment is unemployed,, and<br />
who is currently bottling with his mortgage interest rates, 3:<br />
want to ask you since I've been a Labor supporter for all og my<br />
life, I ask you simply this how this time around Can you expect~<br />
Me to support you yet again?<br />
PM: Well Rego very simple. What you've got to ask yourself, i:<br />
Ugues, in not just the past but the future, and so Itll just<br />
" efor brief ly to the past which you raise and I'll refer to the<br />
Vast as a basis for looking to the future which in important for<br />
you. Reog when I came to office in 1963, in the previous twelvci<br />
months there had been an increase of a quarter of a million in,<br />
the level of unemployed in Australia and we had a situation where<br />
there wasl the best part of eleven Oer cent of our population<br />
unemployed. Since I've been in office Reg, I've created jobai<br />
with my colleagues at a rate unheard of before in this country,<br />
and more than twice as fast an the rest of the world, fiLve timer;<br />
faster than the conservativ es, and twice as fast as the rest of~<br />
the world. Now that's what we've dones and I'm saying for the<br />
future, which is important for you# that under the policies of my<br />
government growth will continue, more jobs will be created<br />
whereas you have the certainty under Mr. Peacock of a wage;<br />
explosion and a destruction of the budget surplus which wil.<br />
destroy the economy. They destroyed it at the beginning of thel<br />
1980a because they had wrong economic plicies, and they havet<br />
exactly the same prescription nov. And leot me say in regard toi<br />
you in Tasmania, what you need to ask yourself is this questionnow<br />
can you possibly vote for Mr. Peacock who in terms of hi. s<br />
commitment to take billions of dollars out of the revenue which<br />
would be available for helping you in Tasmania and taking<br />
billions of dollars out of the Commonwealth revenue and shovingr<br />
it into the pockets of the wealthiest in this country, the<br />
wealthiest one per cent and loe of the population. To help pal,<br />
to do that he's going to take another fifteen point seven million<br />
dollars off the Commonwealth grants to Tasmania. In my case)<br />
every promise I've made in this campaign I've funded by my own<br />
savings, not another cent of f the states, But you in Tasmania,<br />
and every listener In Tasmania should remember this -you will,<br />
have fifteen point seven million dollars taken off you by Mr.<br />
Peacock to help him shove billions of dollars into the pockets of'<br />
the-wealthiest one per cent.<br />
TIERNEYs Thank you very much Rego and good morning Fred. / 64h.. </p>
<p>e<br />
CALME: Good morning Judy# good morning Bob. I'mD oeventy-six<br />
yare of age Bob, not a member of any political party. Wq'ves<br />
formed a group consisting of retired bankc managers, investment<br />
officers etcetera, and we've come down strongly in favour of you<br />
continuing in government, Bob, Andrew Peacock stems to me to ba<br />
cutting everything. He wants to cut the ABC in expenditure and<br />
sell to private enterprises Medicare cuts, the rich may opt out<br />
therefore there'd be no funding and it would collapse. Social<br />
Security, cuts in expenditure# pensioners and those most in needi<br />
will suffer. Rnvironment out down our children's forests.<br />
Nothing on export$* And I'm worried on preferences* Bob, peoplo<br />
should take care I think, voting iIG or Democrats# return tho<br />
votes to Labor. What do you comment on that Bob?<br />
PMs Fred# thank you very much for your comments. Can I pick up<br />
the major point in one sense. I think you nay that you'rel<br />
seventy-six years of aeand you're talking in some sense not<br />
just on behalf of the olerly but obviously you're concerned<br />
about the nexct generation by your reference to the environment.,<br />
Can I just make this point in regard to our senior citizens Prod,,<br />
that would reflect your concern. I guess again as regard to the<br />
previous listener, if you're going to make some Judgement Fred,<br />
about the alternative parties, that is my Labor Party in thei<br />
Government, or the conservatives, an a senior citizen you'd need<br />
to ask yourself well what did they do when they were ifk<br />
Government for seven years# wehat did they do? Well I'll1 tell You<br />
what they did. They cut, they cut, and deliberately cut the real<br />
value of the pension by two and a half per cant. s They had the<br />
opportunity of giving substance to their rhetoric of concern<br />
about senior citizens but in seven years they deliberately out;<br />
the purchasing power of the pension by two and a half per cent.<br />
In my seveni years I've increased it by over seven per cent,<br />
between seven and eight per cent, in real terms i've increased<br />
its value. And as a result of the increase to the pension that'si<br />
coming in next month, that's already legislated for, the pension<br />
will become over twenty-five per cent of average weekly earnings<br />
which will be the highest proportion the pension will have had of'<br />
average weekly earnings for more than forty years. So Fred on<br />
that area you are absolutely right to have this concern. Now,<br />
going to the last point you made Pred,, about preference votes.<br />
Agaigj you're absoLutel y right. I can understand Fred, as no<br />
doubtr you can, that if there is a person who really wants to cast<br />
a vote about environmental issues for instance, that they would<br />
cast their vote for a candidate who they think has that as their<br />
overwhelming concern. But in the end if you are concerned about </p>
<p>PM conts the environment then you've got to make sure that your<br />
Preference goes to the party which has the best record and the<br />
best policy on the environment, and there is no doubt where that;<br />
is because on every major decision that my Government has made in<br />
Tasmania to save the Franklin, in Queensland to save the<br />
rainforestu, the Daintree rainforests, from logging, to save thu<br />
Kakadu from mining, to save the tall forests of Tasmania, onr<br />
every single one of those decisions we have been vehemently<br />
opposed by the Opposition so Fred, you're absolutely right.,<br />
People who want to vote their first preference for art<br />
environmentally inclined candidate they must give their effective<br />
vote, their second preference to Labor otherwise they will bie<br />
voting against their own Interests.<br />
TIERNEYs Thank you very much Fred, and good morning Lance, 3:<br />
believe you're a pensioner. So what do you think of the PM1<br />
comments? CALLERt Yes I'm an invalid pensioner and, well what I think of<br />
him I've already voted by post and I voted for Labor. I know<br />
TIERNEYs But have you got a question? Have you got a question<br />
for the PX Lance?<br />
CALLIRi Yel. You've promised that a time will come when<br />
pensioners wont pay tax at all. Does this Include tax on savings<br />
accounts? PMt The'position is quite clear Lance, and I thank you for your<br />
question. By the next year eighty per cent of people who are in<br />
receipt of pension or part pension will pay no tax and you have<br />
the com! itment of the Government which we announced last year<br />
that by 1995 no person in receipt of a pension or part pension<br />
will pay any tax. No pensioner or part pensioner will pay any<br />
tax Lance.<br />
CALLERs That includes savings accounts?<br />
PM: Any person in receipt of a pension, pension or part pension,<br />
will not pay tax.<br />
CALL Ms No tax at all,<br />
PM: That's the commitment. </p>
<p>TIERNEY; Good morning Vin.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Judy, Prime Minister. Vin Barron,<br />
Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce<br />
PM: Yes, Vin.<br />
CALLER: Prime minister, it appears that Government is<br />
desperate for cash. I refer to small business and<br />
taxation arnd you have imposed required companies to pay<br />
percent of their tax 28 days after the end of their<br />
financial year, that will cause between two billion and<br />
two and a halt billion to be taken out of circulation on<br />
28th July. That, to our reading will put more pressure<br />
on interest rates to rise and that is in fact if small<br />
businesses are able to borrow the money and we can say in<br />
Tasmania there are many small companies who will not be<br />
able to do so, but who will go out<br />
TIERNEY: Vin, yin, I think the PM knows what you are<br />
talking about.<br />
CALLER 85 percent in 28 days and reintroduce<br />
quarterly company tax payments.<br />
PM: Vin, let me, I understand your question, let me go<br />
to the various ramifications of it. It is-true, as you<br />
say, that we have introduced changes which will require<br />
business to pay their, to meet their tax obligation<br />
somewhat earlier than they had before but I make these<br />
points about it. Firstly, you will still have an<br />
advantage over individual taxpayers in, in terms of the<br />
delay that you will have which is not available to<br />
individual taxpayers, individual taxpayers pay as they<br />
earn, businesses will still have a period of grace. Now,<br />
come on, Vin, lot me answer the question please. And as<br />
far as international comparisons are concerned,<br />
Australian business will be still relatively advantaged<br />
compared to what the situation in most overseas countries<br />
is. Now thirdly, in regard to impact upon interest<br />
rates, these things have been taken into account by all<br />
that are making their predictions about interest rate<br />
impact and the fact is that the banking industry is<br />
making it quite clear, Vin, making it absolutely clear,<br />
that their assessment is on the basis or the policies of<br />
this Government that interest rates will fall after the<br />
eler~ tion. And that is because, Vin, of two basic<br />
factors. One, that the policies that we've had in place<br />
before have achieved their result. In other words, we're<br />
getting a slowing down of the economy which means that we<br />
can therefore ease rates and the second thing is, of<br />
course, is that the cost of money to the banking system<br />
has been reduced since the early part of this year. so<br />
the assessment that has been made by the banking industry<br />
is the correct assessment, and that is that interest<br />
rates will fall. </p>
<p>CALLER: Banks here in tact, small businesses have been<br />
told that the banks are concerned that they will not be<br />
able to either lend them additional money because they're<br />
in so far now or the banks soe problem with it, but<br />
the fact of the matter is that most of the small<br />
businesses just will not be able to and secondly the<br />
delay that business has in collecting its money. I mean,<br />
this isn't taken into account, it is taken into account<br />
in reintroducing quarterly payments.<br />
PH: All I'm saying to you, Vin, is that, as you know,<br />
and you're not disputing what I'm saying, is that<br />
business will still have a period of grace and they're<br />
not required to pay their tax immediately. That is, that<br />
is an indisputable fact and it is also true that compared<br />
with the rest of the world, Australian business, in terms<br />
of the time when they have to meet their tax obligation,<br />
is favourably treated.<br />
TIERN4EY: Thanks Prime Minister and thank you Vin. And<br />
now to Mark in Devonport. Good morning, Mark.<br />
CALLER: Good morning, Mr Hawke.<br />
PH: Morning, Mark.<br />
CALLER: My question is the largest problem in the world<br />
is overpopulation. our representatives to the world<br />
forum, what's your opinion of this problem?<br />
PM: well Mark, it is undoubtedly true that one of the<br />
major elements in the growth environmental problems,<br />
like the growth of Greenhouse emissions is a function of<br />
the rapid increase in the world population and that is a<br />
fact which is acknowledged by all the people who have<br />
been engaged in research in this area. I don't dispute<br />
that and indeed programs are being undertaken in many<br />
countries to, to try and get a reduction in the rate of<br />
g rowth of the world's population. In India, for<br />
instance, I could just give you some pretty dramatic<br />
illustrations of this, of the dimension of the problem.<br />
Their annual population increase now is more than the<br />
total population of Australia and they are pursuing<br />
policies there to try and restrict that rate of<br />
population growth and try and reach a point of stability.<br />
But that is some way ahead. Now, as far as Australia is<br />
congerned, I don't think it follows that because there is<br />
a population problem for the world as a whole that that<br />
means we should say that our population of 17 Million in<br />
Australia is all that we should have. r mean, we are a<br />
very, very large continent. We have vast natural<br />
resources and I believe that there is a capacity to<br />
increase the population of Australia. So I think you've<br />
got to put it into two different categories. There is<br />
without question, a problem about explosion or population<br />
in the world as a whole it doesn't mean, necessarily,<br />
that we haven't got room to increase our population in<br />
Australia. </p>
<p>CALLER: world's population is going to increase or<br />
double in about five or ton years time?<br />
PH: No, not in, no, that's getting your, your geometric<br />
progressions in a rather explosive factor, but it is the<br />
case that we will be doubling the population in, in a<br />
period. I mean, if the present trend. were to continue<br />
in a period which wouldn't be, wouldn't be congenial I<br />
mean, it is the case that, as I say, all science<br />
concerned with it attribute the population explosion as<br />
one of the most significant factors in the growth of the<br />
Greenhouse effects and the problems that is causing for<br />
the rest of the world.<br />
TIERNEY: And thank you mark. Now we've got the calls<br />
banking up here so could you please keep your questions<br />
and answers very short?<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
TIERNEY: And Jackie. Good morning.<br />
CALLER: G'day. You've changed your damning statement of<br />
last election to no child has to live in poverty in the<br />
19905. of* tell me why my two children still only have a<br />
week growth in budget and I what I can do to<br />
alleviate it?<br />
PM: Well, Jackie, let's get the facts right and then<br />
ve'll get the facts also about what I've done about it.<br />
The facts are that on the same day, not subsequently<br />
changed, so please get your facts right. On the same day<br />
in 1987 my policy speech, in the statement that was<br />
released, the statement was released, simultaneously with<br />
my speech, the words were there, spelt out in full.<br />
There will be no financial need for a child to live in<br />
poverty. Fact two<br />
CALLER: I'll accept that, but<br />
PH: Well, fact two, fact two, Jackie<br />
CALLER: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: fact two let me go, go to the facts. The three<br />
major organisations in the community concerned with this<br />
ar6. i of welfare have said that the Prime Minister's<br />
financial pledge has been delivered. Pact three, that<br />
under the delivery of that pledge over $ 2 billion per<br />
annum is being paid out to low income families. Fact<br />
four, what that means, that national aggregate term, let<br />
me give you what it means in terms of a low income<br />
family. A low income family where the single income is<br />
$ 320 a week with three children, it means that that<br />
family is receiving, under my policies, $ 110 a week tax<br />
free, which is equivalent to a wage increase of $ 170 a<br />
week. And that is why the Brotherhood of St Laurence, </p>
<p>the Australian Council of Social Services and the<br />
Australian Institute of Family Studies have said and<br />
asserted last year that the Prime Ministerial promise has<br />
been delivered.<br />
CALLER: Mr Hawke, my family is definitely a low income<br />
family, we have $ 190 a week to live on and I have two<br />
children. Nov you can't tell me that that<br />
PM: I an telling, I0ll tell you exactly what you get,<br />
I'll tell you exactly what you get from here, from the<br />
studio, without the figures I'll tell. What are the<br />
age of your two children? You tell me the age of your<br />
two children, so I'll tell you what you get per week?<br />
CALLER: 1, 1<br />
PM: you tell me what the ages of your children are,<br />
Jackie, and 1011 tell you what you get?<br />
CALLER: nine. I know what I get.<br />
PM: Well, what are the ages of your children and I0ll<br />
tell you what you get.<br />
CALLER: Five and nine.<br />
PM: Well, I'll tell you, Jackie, that for those two<br />
children, five and nine, for each of them you'd get an<br />
amount of $ 24.15 a week for each of them, which is, you<br />
get under, just under $ 50 a week tax free in respect of<br />
those two kids.<br />
TIERNEY: What's your income Jackie?<br />
CALLER: My total income, including what Mr Hawke just<br />
stated, my child allowance supplement, is $ 190 a week.<br />
TIERNEY: not a lot to live on is it Jackie?<br />
CALLER: It's not a lot to live on, no. I have two<br />
mortgages to pay, I gave up my rent allowance in order to<br />
buy my house so that I could be a little bit self<br />
sufficient and, as I say, I lost my rent allowance in the<br />
effort now I pay rates and taxes instead.<br />
PM:, You're paying two mortgages, Jackie?<br />
CALLER: Paying two mortgages.<br />
PM: You're paying<br />
TIERNEY: Why two mortgages?<br />
CALLER: Paying two mortgages<br />
PH: Jackie, just let's get this straight then. You're<br />
paying two mortgages, two mortgages of f. </p>
<p>CALLER: Pardon.<br />
PM: You're paying two mortgages a week off?<br />
CALLER: I'm paying off two mortgages.<br />
PM: How much, how much do you pay on the mortgages?<br />
CALLER: I pay a total of $ 134 a fortnight of f my<br />
mortgages, both of them.<br />
PM: So two mortgages a week. So that's 75, that's $ 77 a<br />
I'm sorry, $ 67 a week you pay in mortgages.<br />
CALLER: That's right. It's more than I was paying rent,<br />
that I got a rent allowance to help me with.<br />
PN: You certainly get a rent allowance. You get a, you<br />
Vief t yoau rweenrt, e urnednetri ngo urp ripvoaltiecliye, s , yoyuo ug ogto t a ar ernetn t alallolwoawnacnec. e<br />
CALLER: Yes, when I was renting privately I got a rent<br />
allowance. PM: Of course you did.<br />
CALLER: taken away as soon as I bought a home.<br />
PM: Well, if you'd bought a home and, and you've got<br />
your home, by definition Jackie, an allowance which is<br />
paid to a person renting privately, by definition,<br />
doesn't apply. I meant you weren't expecting it as well<br />
as paying the highest amount ever that any Government's<br />
ever paid in child allowances and that where we were<br />
paying also an additional allowance to persons renting<br />
privately, that you should be allowed to keep the private<br />
rent allowance if you'd bought a house. You're not<br />
suggesting that are you?<br />
CALLER: Mr Hawke, that is exactly what happened to New<br />
Zealand.<br />
TIERNEY: Jackie interested in what happens in New<br />
Zealand. Look, we've got a number of calls. I think<br />
Sou ' ye had a fairly good go there and we go now to Helen<br />
nJLaunceston. Morning Helen.<br />
CALLER: Morning. Good morning Mr Hawke.<br />
PM4: Good morning Helen.<br />
CALLER: Unfortunately the coalition has only recognised<br />
prior to this election that there are women in the<br />
community and that we have needs and that we have a real<br />
voice at the next election held next, on Saturday. My<br />
question is that I recognise what's been done by the<br />
Labor Party through RoB Kelly and Sue Ryan. I just ask </p>
<p>a-a~ ayou<br />
Prime minister for a continued commitment to provide<br />
retraining opportunities for women who wish to return to<br />
the workforcet to retain the family allowance and to<br />
continue with the commitment that you've already shown.<br />
TIERtNEY: That's two questions, Helen. Perhaps just a<br />
PM: I give you that commitment, Helen, and let me, let<br />
me make this point that there are two principles Helen,<br />
and may I say Judy to you and all your listeners, there<br />
are two principles that have driven as and my colleagues<br />
in our attitude to our, our policies for women. one is<br />
social justice and social equity. I mean, it is<br />
absolutely intolerable that we should have a society that<br />
I should have inherited to Government in 1983 where there<br />
were barriers to women in employment and the range of<br />
occupations which they could fill. So it was socially<br />
intolerable that 50 percent of the population should have<br />
these barriers against them. So, that's been..<br />
Secondly, there's also a question of economic good sense.<br />
This country was not making it possible to tap into the<br />
great talents of 50 percent of the population and so<br />
we've done all the sort of things that you've talked<br />
about, Helen, and I give you that continuing commitzent.<br />
But in, in a continuing sense, into the future, I think<br />
the most important thing that we're doing, Helen, is that<br />
we're ens~ yng, in cooperation with the States, the whole<br />
education system is going to be transformed so that when<br />
a girl goes to school she will be confronted with the<br />
same opportunities throughout her educational life to be<br />
trained and equipped for any vocation or profession or<br />
calling that she wants to follow. I mean, what Australia<br />
has to understand is that of course women are going to<br />
find their fulfilment, in one sense, in being the wife<br />
and mother, some of them that's all they will want to<br />
do and that should be respected but increasingly in our<br />
Australian society and in the rest of the world, women<br />
are also seeing their opportunity for fulfilment in doing<br />
as well as that, also having jobs in the paid workforce.<br />
And as a concerned and intelligent society we must pursue<br />
policies which are going to enable them to do that. And<br />
we will.<br />
TIERNEY: Thank you very much, Helen. Good morning,<br />
Steve. CALLER&amp;* Good morning, Sue.<br />
TIERNEY: Judy actually.<br />
PM: Good morning Steve.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Bob. Look I'd like to take you<br />
away from the very important things you've been talking<br />
about to something which is important in a different way.<br />
OTC is closing down quite a number of marine radio<br />
stations. Melbourne, Hobart, Adelaide and Brisbane.<br />
Eugene Alexander has given a commitment to have this </p>
<p>decision reviewed and to prevent the closure of the<br />
Hobart marine radio station which, if it is closed, will<br />
threaten the safety of Tasmania's many, many fishermen<br />
and even more pleasure boat<br />
TIMRNEY: Yes, so what's your question, Steve?<br />
CALLER: Well, will the Prime minister confirm that a<br />
review of this action would be taken especially for<br />
Hobart and would he try to please prevent this happening?<br />
PH: Steve, I, V1ll be quite honest. I wasn't aware or<br />
that decision that you're talking about of closing down<br />
these. I will give you the undertaking that I will<br />
certainly personally undertake to have a look at what the<br />
factual situation is. I will certainly ask for a review<br />
of it to be qiven. I mean, if that decision has been<br />
taken I'll ask for the reasons and if I'm not persuaded<br />
that there are compelling reasons, I would ask for it to<br />
be changed.<br />
0 TIERNEY* Has been a big issue down here Mr Hawk. and it<br />
does, on the surface at least, seems to put fishermen<br />
especially at risk in some or our waters around the<br />
coast. PM: Well, yes, well that's not something that on its face<br />
I find acceptable. But, Steve, I always try to be<br />
absolutely honest in these things. what I'm say to you<br />
so you understand what I'm committing myself to. I'M<br />
committing myself to become acquainted with, I'll be<br />
asking to be told what the facts are and I'll indicate<br />
that prima facie I'm not happy about it and unless I can<br />
be satisfied that there are the compelling reasons for<br />
doing it, I would ask for the decision to be changed.<br />
CALLER: Well, thank you very much.<br />
TIERNEY: If the decision isn't changed, fishermen will<br />
have to spend I think it's six to eight thousand dollars<br />
per boat to tap into the system.<br />
CALLER: And<br />
PM; Steve, you can be assured that I will have the<br />
question looked at.<br />
CALLER: Thank you.<br />
TIERNEY: Thank you very much Steve. Good morning Joyce.<br />
CALLER: Good morning. Good morning Mr Prime minister.<br />
PH: Good morning Joyce.<br />
cAUME: I'm an old age pensioner.<br />
PM: Yes. </p>
<p>CALLER: paying a mortgage Of f. NOW I am paying off<br />
$ 267 a fortnight out of pension. Now with mortgage<br />
and rates, that's $ 118 a fortnight goes out of that,<br />
which does not leave me very much to live on with, by the<br />
time you buy your food, you pay your telephone<br />
TIEIRNEYz So what's your question Joyce?<br />
CALLER: what I want to know, is a Labor Government<br />
ina the future, intend those people who can't help<br />
themselves by putting a roof over their heads,<br />
particularly if they're on a pension.<br />
PH: Joyce, I mean, I hope you were listening to what I<br />
said earlier. The, the performance of this Government in<br />
the seven years we've been in office has been quite<br />
outstanding. Look at the things that we've done. I<br />
contrasted it with what happened before where they<br />
slashed the real value of the pension. we've increased<br />
it by about eight percent, increased the real purchasing<br />
power of the pension. When we came to office, the<br />
pension, as a proportion of average weekly earnings was<br />
22.7 percent. Now, next month, as a result of the<br />
decisions already taken, that will go to over 25 percent<br />
of average weekly earnings which, Joyce, will be the<br />
highest proportion that the pensioners had of average<br />
weekly earnings in more than 40 years. In addition to<br />
that, as you would have heard me say, we've also made<br />
arrangements for additional entitlements where people<br />
are renting privately and we've also moved to a situation<br />
Where by 1995 no person in receipt of a pension or part<br />
pension will be paying any tax. Against that record of<br />
unsurpassed achievement you have a situation where Hr<br />
Peacock has got unfunded promises of about $ 7 billion<br />
which include, may I say, this sort of proposition,<br />
Joyce, that they'll take billions of dollars out of their<br />
own revenues which would be available to assist the aged,<br />
to shove those billions of dollars into the pockets of<br />
the wealthiest one percent in the population so that that<br />
will take it away from a capacity to help you.. In<br />
addition, I'll tell you what their tax policy is and I<br />
would hope that all the people in Tasmania would, would<br />
note this and understand the significance of it. They<br />
are promising to change the tax system to bring in what<br />
they are pleased to call a flatter rate two tiered<br />
sy stem. And what that means that Hr Peacock, as Prime<br />
Minñ ster, would give himself a cut of over $ 100 a week in<br />
tax and that a person on average weekly earnings, at<br />
about $ 28,000, a cut of$ 4,73, In other words, he'd give<br />
himself $ 100 a week greater tax cut than he would to the<br />
average person out there. So whether you're an aged<br />
person or a person in employment, what you see is the<br />
stark picture of a group of conservatives dedicated to<br />
increasing the privileged the few in this country at<br />
the expense of the many, including the pensioners of<br />
Australia. </p>
<p>TIERNEY: Thank you Joyce, and Prime minister, do you<br />
have time for one more call?<br />
PM: Just one more, yes, thank.<br />
TIERNEY: Good morning, Beryl, you're the lucky last.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Judy, good morning Hr Hawke.<br />
PH: Good morning Beryl.<br />
CALLER: I am, I've just been made a war widow, but<br />
I've just discovered that I'm 40 percent better off under<br />
a Labor Government. it was something I'd never searched<br />
into<br />
TIERNEYs So what's you question, Beryl?<br />
CALLER: The question is, as I am petrified of a<br />
coalition government wrecking what was once a marvellous<br />
hospital care, not for me, but for mine.<br />
PH: Well, thanks, Beryl. I can assure you that as far<br />
as I'M~ concerned, personally and my Government, we have a<br />
total and continuing commitment to those of our veterans<br />
community and I0m pleased to say that Sir William Keys,<br />
who was the head of the RSL for so long and a man with<br />
whom I established a close working relationship, has, has<br />
said that the record of this Government is outstanding in<br />
this area. And as far as the veterans community is<br />
concerned, let me say this that I give an unqualified<br />
commitment to keeping the, the Ministry of Veterans<br />
Affairs as a separate, as a separate portfolio and that<br />
as far as the hospitals are concerned, we will continue<br />
to ensure that they provide a, a basis for giving the<br />
service that all members of the veterans and their widows<br />
need. It's been for me a matter of continuing concern<br />
because Ilia a soft touch in this area, Beryl, as every<br />
member of my cabinet will tell you. My late father was a<br />
chaplain in the Hollywood Repatriation Hospital for a<br />
period of some 30 years and so I grew up, as a child,<br />
knowing the importance of what our community owes to our<br />
veterans tour veterans themselves and to those<br />
dependent upon them. So you have my continuing<br />
commitment, Beryl.<br />
TIEB1NEY: Thank you Beryl. And you say you're a bit of a<br />
softie, Prime minister, you got the, got a touch of the<br />
last minute nerves this week?<br />
PM: No, not nerves. I'm neither cocky nor complacent,<br />
Judy. 1, I have tried my hardest in this campaign to do<br />
the two things that I think I have to do. I think what<br />
Australians want of their Prime Minister in a campaign is<br />
two things. They want him to tell them what the policies<br />
are, why he's done the things he has and what he promises<br />
for the future of this country. I've tried to do that.<br />
I think they also expect me to expose what I see as the </p>
<p>V inadequacies of the Opposition. I've tried to do that,<br />
but overall my campaign has been a, a deliberately<br />
positive one in which I have been available at all times<br />
to answer questions that anyone, including the media,<br />
want to put to me. r hope I've done that well. I feel<br />
confident without being cocky.<br />
TIERNEYz Well thanks much for spending time with us.<br />
PH: It's been a great pleasure Judy. Thank you to you<br />
and your listener&amp;.<br />
ends.<br />
