FOR MEDIA 15 OCTOBER 1985<br />
STATEMENT BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER<br />
I have this morning sent the following message to<br />
President Reagan:<br />
" Dear Mr President<br />
The Government of Australia understands and shares the<br />
deep concern of the Government of the USA at the acts<br />
of the terrorists who illegally seized the<br />
" Achille Lauro" and murdered an American passenger.<br />
It agrees with, and has complete sympathy with, the<br />
declaration of the Government of the USA that<br />
terrorists should be proceeded against according to the<br />
established legal processes and that all countries in<br />
the international community should meet their proper<br />
obligations in this process. Australia certainly will<br />
meet its responsibilities in this respect and we have<br />
conveyed this commitment to your Government. The<br />
Government of Australia understands the concerns of the<br />
Government of the USA to make these terrorists subject<br />
to legal accountability.<br />
This incident is the latest in a cycle of violence and<br />
counter-violence in the Middle East which will not stop<br />
until the underlying causes of the Middle East dispute<br />
are addressed and resolved.<br />
Lionel Bowen<br />
Acting Prime Minister." </p>
