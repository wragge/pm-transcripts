19 March to 23 March.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that he looked forward to continuing<br />
the fruitful discussions he had had with President Nyerere in<br />
Ottawa at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting last<br />
year. " President Myerere has indicated a particular interest<br />
in various aspects of Australia's development which are of<br />
relevance to Tanzania's own situation", Mr. Whitlam. said.<br />
" These and other aspects of Australian life and<br />
development will be covered in the intensive program which has<br />
been arranged for him.<br />
" I am sure that all Australians will warmly welcome<br />
President Nyerere as a distinguished African and world leader.<br />
We recall with admiration the unique role he has played in the<br />
attainment of independence by his own country and his role in<br />
Tanzania's subsequent development. His personal contribution<br />
to the philosophy and practice of self-reliant development,<br />
embodied in the ujama program of Tanzania, has been a source of<br />
hope to many in the developing world.<br />
The State Visit program of engagements will be announced<br />
when details have been settled with the Tanzanian authorities". </p>
