INTERVIEW<br />
With Messrs Bob Baudino and Brian Johns, Perth, 7 May 1972<br />
PM The Leaders of the Federal Parties in the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament to find out if they would take part in a convention.<br />
I wrote to the Leaders of the Country Party, the Labor<br />
Party and the D. L. P. and I havenow received letters from<br />
each of them expressing their willingness to take part in a<br />
Conference. But the Government also made a decision, at<br />
least we made a decision, as the Government, that we would be<br />
represented. Shortly afterwards, on 19 April to be precise,<br />
we considered a submission by the Attorney-General., and I<br />
was given authority to convey the decision to Sir Henry, to<br />
make an announcement at the appropriate time<br />
Q You have done that<br />
PM I think a letter is ready now. I had to wait until we<br />
got one additional letter at that time, and I received tlat<br />
just before I came here. I think I can stress the importance<br />
of. this Convention because of the rapid change in conditions in<br />
Australia, and the need to develop a Constitution that is<br />
appropriate to the times, both from the point of view of the<br />
Commonwealth and the States, and the desirability of giving<br />
some voice to Local Government Authorities.<br />
We took our de6ision against the background that the<br />
fundamental Constitutional role must lie with the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament because only the Commonwealth can take the necessary<br />
action to have a referendum presented to the Australian people.<br />
So that whilst we are willing and anxious to participate, we<br />
must do so on the basis that the convention could not bind the<br />
Commonwealth. Shortly I will be submitting a paper to the Leaders ol.<br />
the other Parties so that we can have preliminary discussions<br />
. prior to having the proposals submitted to the members of<br />
each Party for consideration. I've already told the States,<br />
after receiving a question in the House, that there was a<br />
strong-feeling that Local Government should be represented.<br />
Q Can you tell us in the Sir Henry Bolte letter,-the<br />
points he made<br />
PM Well, fundamentally, we would ask the Leaders of the<br />
various Parties in the Parliament....<br />
Q Would you spel out where he would like thd Constitution<br />
altered<br />
PM No, so far it's only in a preparatory stage. I'd like<br />
very much if subsequent matters could be dealt with in depth.<br />
Q You don't expect anything this year<br />
PM We'll have meetings, yes, but to establish the kind of<br />
forum, to establish the rules and the framwork and the number<br />
of representatives from the States and Commonwealth, I. doubt<br />
whether we can get on to the subject this year. ./ 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Q So this is a long term -it will be right at the<br />
top level?<br />
PM Yes.<br />
Q It will be yourself, and the State Premiers<br />
PM Yes.<br />
Q All State Premiers involved<br />
PM Yes. I think we will find though there will be<br />
Parliamentary Delegations, for example, we have been<br />
thinking of this Preliminary Conference that there should<br />
be probably as many as fifteen or eighteen representatives<br />
from the Commonwealth Parliament, but th~ at would be-witliout<br />
prejudice to larger representations, at a later date.<br />
Q Eighteen representatives from the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament<br />
PM Fifteen to eighteen<br />
From the Comm*' nwealth alorie<br />
PM Yes. We are thinking of it. I'm not saying we are<br />
committed to it yet.<br />
Q This is designed to cover all avenues of the Constitution-<br />
All possible points of discussion.<br />
PM Well, that's going too far yet. I think we wouldn't<br />
touching subsequent matters just at the moment, but this is<br />
the number of peoplethat we think we could cope with at a<br />
preliminary conference.<br />
Q Well, could I ask what would be the breakdown on this<br />
party would it be Ministerial or official levels?<br />
PM No, it would be members of both Houses, and members<br />
of each of the Parliamentary groups, each of the Parliameneary<br />
Parties: drawn from each of-the Parliamentary Parties.<br />
QWhen do you think this meeting might take place<br />
PM I could not tell you when it's. likely to be, but I<br />
~ understand, THIS PART IS OFF THE RECORD, I rang Greenwood<br />
yesterday, because he had been at a conference sbme time in<br />
April, and he'd written to meq telling what happened at<br />
the Conference and making several recommendations to me.<br />
Q That was the Conference in Adelaide -Attorney-Generals.<br />
just looking at Constitution review<br />
PM Yes.<br />
Q And this follows on from that I take it -obviously<br />
Sir Henry's Attorney-General has gone back and briefed him?<br />
./ 3 </p>
<p>PM This followed this must have happened in the last<br />
few weeks because this is the Attorney-General's meeting<br />
and I have not yet recehived I've seen the press release<br />
made by the Attorney-General, but I haven't yet got a report<br />
from the Attorney as to what happened, or any recommendations<br />
that he m ay have made.<br />
Q What I'm questioning is the timing of Sir Henry Bolte's<br />
letter. Sir Henry Bolte wrote to you after the Attorney-<br />
Generals' Meeting?<br />
PM No, before. He wrote to me on the 22nd March.<br />
I don't have the date the Attorneys met, but it would have<br />
been in the lastcouple of weeks. U<br />
