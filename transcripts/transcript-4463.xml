ADDRESS TO TASMANIAN STATE COUNCIL, ULVERSTONE, TASMANIA<br />
It is twenty months to the day since the Government was so<br />
resoundingly elected to office, and when all five Tasmanian<br />
seats in the House of Representatives were won by Liberals.<br />
I am very mindful of the magnificent contribution which Tasmanian<br />
Liberals made to our election victory people like Senator Reg<br />
Wright who is leaving Parliament in June next year after a long<br />
career in politics. Senator Wright is determined, sometimes<br />
irascible, a dogged fighter for those values important for the<br />
Liberal cause a man independent in mind and action. If<br />
sometimes he is judged wrong, the integrity of his support<br />
for the Tasmanian cause can never be denied.<br />
The Liberal Party won the 1975 election because we were committed<br />
to a new direction in government, because we were committed to<br />
increasing people's independence, and their ability to achieve<br />
a better society. We rejected the view that the way to solve<br />
Australia's problems was more Government spending, and bigger,<br />
more intrusive government. Labor believed this and it almost<br />
stifled Australia, almost suffocated the creativity and energy<br />
of the Australian people. And after the Perth Conference, it<br />
is clear that Labor would do it again.<br />
We have made a beginning in fulfilling our commitment to create<br />
a better Australia. We have halted the growth of big government.<br />
Estimates indicate that the Government's share of gross national<br />
product has fallen, and the number of Commonwealth employees has<br />
been reduced by 12,000. This is 31,000 less than it would have<br />
been under Labor's policies. We have fundamentally reformed the<br />
taxation system. Tax indexation now prevents taxes rising simply<br />
because of inflation. Our reforms of company taxation are preventing<br />
businessmen being taxed on the illusory profits produced<br />
by the effect of inflation on their stocks. We have provided<br />
greater protection for individuals. The Ombudsman and the<br />
Administrative Appeals Tribunal have commenced work. The<br />
Federal Court system has been reformed. Procedures for the<br />
review of administrative decisions have been simplified. / We have </p>
<p>-2<br />
we have provided aid to those who are in real need, in ways<br />
increasing their independence and providing greater opportunities<br />
for choice. Our Family Allowance Scheme makes a direct cash<br />
payment to all mothers and benefits the poorest sections of the<br />
community most. The concentra-tion of power in the hands of the<br />
Government has been reversed. Our policies have given greater<br />
financial independence and responsibility to the states and to<br />
local government.<br />
The Government has done much to help the rural sector which has<br />
suffered so acutely from falling real incomes and decreasing<br />
competitiveness in overseas markets. We have introduced a numnber<br />
of measures to provide essential short-term assistance, including<br />
carry-on loans at concessional rates of interest to beef and dairy<br />
producers; abolition of the Meat Export Levy; underwriting of<br />
prices for certain dairy products; drought and other natural<br />
disaster relief. At the same time we have reintroduced the superphosphate<br />
bounty, and are assisting longer-term structural adjustments<br />
under our new Rural Adjustment Scheme.<br />
We have introduced Income Equalisation Deposits to help farmers cope<br />
with the problem of sharply fluctuating incomes. We have secured<br />
improved access to overseas markets for many of our agricultural<br />
products. Sales have been concluded for more beef to the United<br />
States, the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, more<br />
wheat to China, more cheese to Japan, more lamb and live sheep to<br />
the Middle-East.<br />
Last weekend, during my meetings with ASEAN Heads of Government,<br />
I had extensive discussions with Japan's Prime Minister Fukuda on<br />
beef and sugar. I pointed out to him that the present arrangement<br />
of negotiating beef quotas every six months was disruptive to the<br />
beef industry's ability to operate effectively. An industry which<br />
has to plan for the long term cannot be properly based on a six<br />
months decision-making process. I put it to Mr. Fukuda that our<br />
officials should work together closely to devise a system which<br />
would better serve the needs of stability. He agreed. We shall<br />
shortly be sending a team of officials to Japan. We will be arguing<br />
for stability of access, for example, a base quota together with a<br />
growth factor related, say, to beef consumption in Japan.<br />
With respect to the current negotiations on sugar, I stressed that<br />
the security of long term contracts as bankable documents should<br />
not be comprised in any way, and as a result of my conversations<br />
with Mr. Fukuda we agreed that the commercial parties should continue<br />
their negotiations. I emphasised to Mr. Fukuda that I<br />
considered that C. S. R. had made concessions enough, and -that any<br />
changes which are made in the contract relating to sales up to<br />
1980 must be compensated for by advantages to our sugar industry<br />
after 1980. I believe that our talks laid the foundation for<br />
commercial agreement between the parties, including what happens<br />
after 1980. The Australian Government continues to give very strong<br />
support indeed to C. S. R. as * the holder of a valid contract. I am<br />
sure that this is understood and there is a strong desire on the<br />
part of Japan and Australia to have the matter settled by commercial<br />
negotiations. / At home, </p>
<p>3-<br />
At home, the Government has paid particular attention to<br />
Tasmania. Tasmania relied heavily on a small number of<br />
businesses, and on the shipment and sale interstate and<br />
overseas of a few major commodities. This dependence makes<br />
Tasmania acutely vulnerable to changes in demand for those<br />
products. High costs and uncertainty in transporting goods<br />
to the mainland have meant all too often that Tasmanian goods<br />
suffer first when buyers cut the level of their purchases.<br />
Last year, Mr. Justice Nimmo reported that Tasmanian shippers<br />
suffered a cost disadvantage. In response to this finding,<br />
the Government introduced the Freight Equalisation Scheme.<br />
In the financial year just ended, the Government paid<br />
$ 16 million in subsidies under the Scheme for goods shipped<br />
to the mainland. This assistance has enabled many Tasmanian<br />
producers to compete in mainland markets and is providing a<br />
strong boost to the state's economy. In addition, an<br />
estimated $ 3 million per year will be payable for the<br />
southbound subsidy. The subsidy will be payable with<br />
respect to certain Tasmanian imports of non-consumer<br />
materials and equipment from the mainland where producers<br />
suffer a transport disability. The benefits to the state<br />
of the southbound scheme will be widespread. Major mining<br />
and manufacturing firms will benefit; farmers can claim<br />
assistance on tractors and other major items of capital<br />
equipment; those'engaged in forestry operations can claim<br />
on heavy equipment; manufacturers of furniture and other<br />
timber products can claim on capital equipment; and food<br />
processors and a variety of other small industries will benefit.<br />
Assistance to all primary producers and most businesses engaged<br />
in manufacturing and mining will be retrospective to 1 July<br />
last year. This means that over the next twelve months,<br />
Tasmanian producers will receive about $ 6 million in south<br />
bound subsidies.<br />
Even more importantly, the Government has allocated to<br />
Tasmania, in recognition of its special difficulties, a<br />
far higher amount per capita than for any other state.<br />
During the financial year just ended, grants and loan funds<br />
to this state amounted to over $ 1,000 for every Tasmanian.<br />
This is one and three quarter times the amount per person<br />
allocated to my own state, Victoria, and higher than for any<br />
other state. The Government has also adopted a deliberate<br />
policy of locating appropriate Commonwealth-funded organisations<br />
in this state. We are locating the main site of the<br />
Australian Maritime College at Newnham. We are committed to<br />
moving the centre of our Antarctic operations from Melbourne<br />
to Kingston. This will inject over $ 7 million into the local<br />
economy, and the Secretariat to the Advisory Council for<br />
Inter-Government Relations is being established in Hobart.<br />
Numerous other capital grants have been made for the Tasman<br />
Bridge, the Launceston General Hospital for the Inveresk Urban<br />
Redevelopment Scheme, and the total of all these grants, when<br />
work is completed, will be over 100 million. We have also<br />
given substantial financial support to the softwood, dairying,<br />
fruit growing and tourist industries. / We </p>
<p>-4<br />
We commissioned the Callaghan Enquiry to establish what<br />
more might be done to help Tasmania's positions. The<br />
Government has recently received the report from that<br />
enquiry and we are considering its recommendations.<br />
Like all Australians, Tasmanians have benefitted from our<br />
success in reducing inflation. Inflation is corrosive of<br />
our society. It harms the weak, it undermines confidence<br />
and security, it stifles business. In the first half of this<br />
year, excluding hospital and medical services, the annual<br />
inflation rate was 10.4%. In the last half of 1974 by<br />
comparison, inflation was running at In 1976, private<br />
investment for plant and equipment rose in real terms by 6.8%.<br />
Company profits were up 27% in the March quarter compared with<br />
the preceding year, and we have restored real growth to the<br />
economy...-But. there is still much. to be done. Inflation must<br />
be reduced further and unemployment must be reduced.<br />
A number-. of innovative schemes-have been introduced to<br />
alleviate youth unemployment, with encouraging results.<br />
The Community Youth Support Scheme-now involes some 15,000<br />
young people. The NEAT Scheme has been expanded to cover<br />
18,000 people,' three quarters of whom have found a job at<br />
the end of their term under the Scheme. NEAT's special youth<br />
employment training programme is particularly successful. it<br />
subsidises employers to hire young people who have been unemployed<br />
for a lengthy period of time. Over 70% of them retain their<br />
jobs when the subsidy expires. The CRAFT scheme for pr-omoting<br />
apprenticeships now covers over 41,500 apprenticeships, and<br />
apprenticeships are up A total of 101,000 people have<br />
now directly benefitted from these schemes. No-one has been<br />
turned away from help under these schemes for lack of Government<br />
finance,, and we shall place no arbitrary limit on funds available<br />
for these very important programmes in this financial year.<br />
in addition to these.-programmes, the Government's Education<br />
Programme for unemployed youth is -taking shape. Young people<br />
who have been unemployed for four months or more are being<br />
vocationally tested to ascertain potential abilities and<br />
defects in basic skills. They are then placed in. small groups<br />
in technical colleges where they experience remedial training<br />
and receive personal advice and guidance. But if there are to<br />
be-jobs for all those who want to work, we must face the fact<br />
that in recent years wage increases have priced many people out<br />
of work. We are still suffering from the excessive wage increase<br />
Labor promoted, when, in the two years to October 1975 award<br />
wages in manufacturing industry increased by 53%. One survey<br />
published last month revealed that one-third of companies<br />
absorbed the recent wage i ncreases awarded by the Arbitration<br />
Commission by laying off workers. The message is clear:<br />
recent wage increases have directly led to further unemployment,<br />
and have far outstripped gains in productivity. In the<br />
financial year just ended, average weekly earnings increased<br />
8%. / Iicw long </p>
<p>How long must it take for union leaders to realise that<br />
only high and rising productivity can sustain a high wage<br />
structure. Trade union wages policy is designed to perpetuate<br />
the distortions which occurred under Labor the very distortions<br />
which moved Australia from habitual full employment to<br />
an economy of high unemployment. A responsible union approach<br />
to industrial disputes is also vital. Unwarranted strikes and<br />
stoppages contribute to unemployment, and impose hardship on<br />
Australians. The air controllers strike was a blatant example<br />
of the selfish attempt by a powerful minority to circumvent<br />
accepted methods of dispute settling, and impose their will<br />
on the community. This strike was resolved only after we<br />
indicated that we would bring down emergency legislation as<br />
a matter of urgency, and would intervene if necessary to<br />
ensure that Tasmania was not stranded without air links to<br />
the mainland. Stoppages have disrupted mining in the Pilbara.<br />
The seamen's dispute has halted the $ 250 million Norwich Park<br />
project. Industrial disputes of this type harm Australia.<br />
The overwhelming majority of Australians, the overwhelming<br />
majority of trade unionists, opposes them. The lack of<br />
reason and common sense inherent in the initiation of many<br />
strikes entitles Australians to ask whether such strikes are<br />
deliberately striking at our country's well being. It is time<br />
the selfish minority recognised that they are members of a<br />
civilised community not a jungle in which the most militant<br />
can get their way, irrespective of the cost to others.<br />
We have legislated to bring greater justice, common sense<br />
and consultation to industrial relations. We have established<br />
the Industrial Relations Bureau, and the National Labour<br />
Consultative Council. We have legislated to provide for<br />
secret postal ballots for the election of officers registered<br />
under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and to limit their<br />
term of office to four years. We have amended legislation to<br />
make it easier for the Government to intervene in cases before<br />
the Arbitration Commission to ensure that the public interest<br />
is adequately protected, and we have amended the Trade<br />
Practices Act to ban damaging secondary boycotts by employees<br />
which do not concern disputes over conditions of employment.<br />
Our approach has resulted in a significant reduction in the<br />
level of industrial disputes. During the first five months<br />
of 1977, we had by far the lowest level of industrial disputes<br />
and the lowest total of working days lost during this decade.<br />
559,000 working days have been lost, compared to almost<br />
4 million days lost for the comparable period in 1974. The<br />
Government will be bringing down further industrial relations<br />
legislation in the coming session of Parliament.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, much has been done to implement Liberal<br />
policies in all areas of Government. But it is only a<br />
beginning. There is still much to be done. More needs<br />
to be done to ensure that assistance is given to those most<br />
in need. We have already acted in many areas to protect<br />
civil liberties, but we shall implement further reforms. / we </p>
<p>6<br />
We cannot afford to take our fundamental liberties for<br />
granted. More needs to be done for our aboriginal<br />
conmmunities. We shall train more aborigines as field<br />
workers for our programmes, and the Law Reform Commission<br />
is examining the feasibility of recognising aboriginal<br />
customary law as part of the law of the land.<br />
We will go further in establishing the conditions in which<br />
our rights as individuals are fully protected, in which<br />
individual initiative is recognised and rewarded, in which<br />
Government can effectively serve the community. In this<br />
great challenge, we need your wholehearted support. We<br />
rely on the constant stimulus of new ideas, new solutions<br />
which Liberal Party Councils across the country can provide.<br />
The central theme of Liberalism concern for the individual<br />
has never lost its relevance. It is the responsibility of<br />
all of us the inheritors of a great Liberal tradition<br />
to keep alive the ideas and ideals of Liberalism, and, by<br />
so doing, maintain the vitality and leadership which this<br />
great party of ours has displayed ever since its inception. </p>
