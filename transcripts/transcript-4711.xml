FOR PRESS 16 MAY 1978<br />
TELEGRAM TO DANE P-ATT NEJ NZIES<br />
My Cabinet colleagues join with me in expressing our<br />
deepest sympathies to you and your family at this sad time.<br />
We all remember well the leadership and example of Sir Robert.<br />
He was a prime exemplar of the practice and principles of<br />
Cabinet Government. Above all, we all remember his<br />
friendship, and his passing has touched each one of us in many<br />
different ways.<br />
On behalf of my colleagues, many of whom served with Sir Robert,<br />
I express our deepest sympathies. ( Malcolm Fraser) </p>
