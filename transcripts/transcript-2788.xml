THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 23 JANUARY 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ladies and gentlemen: I haven't had time to see<br />
today's Australian papers yet, so I am not sure what cover there was<br />
given to the decision by the New Zealand Government at its Cabinet<br />
meeting yesterday which I attended to help the Australian Government<br />
get a start with a Dental Therapist Scheme in the schools a School<br />
Dental Service as they call it in New Zealand. The sum total of it<br />
is that they will agree to take 50 Australian students in March this<br />
year and another intake of 50 in September. This follows the<br />
announcement I made a week ago after our own Cabinet meeting that<br />
we would be taking specific steps to accelerate the intake of preschool<br />
teachers in this academic year. So, therefore, while we have<br />
been frustrated in undertaking any steps this academic year to increase<br />
the output of social workers or of youth leaders, we have succeeded<br />
in taking the necessary steps in respect to school dental nurses and<br />
pre-school teachers.<br />
Today our Cabinet ratified the arrangements which I have been able<br />
to make over the last week with the New Zealand Government and the New<br />
South Wales Government to have a committee of inquiry to prepare a<br />
National Compensation Scheme in Australia to provide compensation for<br />
personal injuries including injuries sustained on the road, at work,<br />
in the home, in the school or elsewhere. I want to thank very much<br />
indeed the co-operation I have received from the Prime Minister of New<br />
Zealand, the Attorney-General of New Zealand and the Chief Justice of<br />
New Zealand and the Premier, Attorney-General and Chief Justice of New<br />
South Wales. Because of that co-operation, we have been able to secure<br />
the services, as members of this committee, of Mr. Justice Woodhouse,<br />
from New Zealand and Mr. Justice Meares from New South Wales.<br />
The third member of the committee will be Professor Patrick Atiyah,<br />
Dean of the Faculty of Law at the Australian National University here<br />
in Canberra. Mr. Justice Woodhouse was the Chairman of a Royal Commission which<br />
in December 1967 brought down a report on compensation for personal<br />
injury in New Zealand. It was a pioneering and epoch-making report.<br />
It has been read with very great interest in all common-law countries,<br />
and we are very fortunate to have Mr. Justice Woodhouse serving on our<br />
committee. Mr. Justice Meares is the Chairman of the Law Reform<br />
Commission of New South Wales. He is a member of the expert group on<br />
road safety which was appointed by our predecessors. You will remember<br />
the report it brought down last September on the road accident situation<br />
in Australia, a national review.<br />
Professor Atiyah is serving under Mr. Justice Meares on the New<br />
South Wales Government's Consultative Committee on Motor Vehicle<br />
Accident Compensation. He has given evidence to the House of<br />
Representatives Select Committee on road safety.<br />
These gentlemen are acknowledged throughout the English-speaking<br />
world in every common-law country as being experts, innovators in this<br />
field. There have been, as you will appreciate, negotiations by letter<br />
and telephone on this subject with both the Prime Minister of New<br />
Zealand and the Premier of New South Wales and, in particular, the<br />
wording which I can read to you if you like of the proposed terms of<br />
reference have been drafted by the New South Wales Attorney-<br />
General as weli as myself. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
In fact the idea of having Mr. Justice Meares and Professor Atiyah<br />
on the Commonwealth's committee of inquiry came from a letter which<br />
the Premier of New South Wales sent to me at the beginning of the<br />
month inquiring about the proposals that we were making for a national<br />
compensation scheme.<br />
Mr. Justice Woodhouse will come to Australia in about a fortnight's<br />
time and he will confer in Sydney with Mr. Justice Meares and, I trust,<br />
I haven't on this point had the opportunity today since the Cabinet rose<br />
to speak with Professor Atiyah but I would expect that he would also be<br />
able to be there with the two judges as they look at the terms of<br />
reference. They will be invited to make any other suggestions to make<br />
this report as complete and helpful as possible and it is quite likely<br />
that at that time they will be able to make some preliminary<br />
arrangements for the conducting of the inquiry, and where they should take<br />
evidence and from whom. The other members of the New South Wales<br />
committee will be invited to give evidence to this committee and, no<br />
doubt, the advice and documents which they have already been able to<br />
give will be very much in Mr. Justice Meares' mind as he takes part<br />
in this inquiry with Mr. Justice Woodhouse and Professor Atiyah.<br />
Now I can read the terms of reference if you like or you can get<br />
them afterwards.<br />
Well Mr. Walsh can give you the text of them afterwards.<br />
Gentlemen; I very much appreciate, as I said at the beginning, the<br />
co-operation of the New Zealand and the New South Wales Gover nments<br />
and judiciary.<br />
There were a couple of other decisions which Cabinet made.<br />
one is to fix a price for the sale of the Nomad-aircraft. We<br />
take quite a pride in the quality and the success which this Australian<br />
aircraft has achieved. We will welcome purchases at $ 285,000 each.<br />
Mr. Barnard can give you further details of these arrangements.<br />
You will remember that in my policy speech I placed particular<br />
emphasis on our desire to build up some basic industries in Australia<br />
for which there is certain to be a great demand in Australia, light<br />
and fighter aircraft was one subject, pipelines, rolling stock,<br />
shipping were the others I mentioned.<br />
Also we decided to defer the hearing of the application for a<br />
second commercial broadcasting station licence in Canberra.<br />
Senator McClelland, the Minister for the Media, reported to us that<br />
there are quite serious deficiencies in the present act. There maybe<br />
conditions laid down for the grant of a licence. It is extremely<br />
doubtful if those conditions can be sustained if challenged, and we<br />
believe that before any new licences are granted that the statutory<br />
position should be clarified and re-enforced.<br />
There is one other matter I should mention to you.<br />
I am pleased to announce that arrangements have been made for<br />
Australia to ratify today two treaties relating to the control of<br />
nuclear weapons, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Seabed<br />
Arms Control Treaty.<br />
The first one, the N. P. T. you will remember was supported by the<br />
Australian Labor Party over the last four years. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
We have said that not only should the treaty be signed which Australia<br />
did after some hesitation but should be ratified. Well we are now<br />
doing that. The instruments of ratification are being deposited today<br />
by Australia's representatives in London, Washington and Moscow<br />
the three depository capitals. This action fulfills a longstandin6<br />
policy of the Australian Labor Party and the pledge, you will recall,<br />
that ' I made in my policy speech before last year's elections. It<br />
reflects my Government's strong and unequivocal support for efforts<br />
to check the spread of nuclear weapons and for the principles of arms<br />
control contained in both treaties. A press release on this matter is<br />
being issued to you by the Department of Foreign Affairs.<br />
Any questions?<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, may I ask you two related questions concerning<br />
the French nuclear tests in the Pacific. Firstly, Sir, were you<br />
disappointed that the Prime Minister of New Zealand didn't join you<br />
in your proposed approach to the International Court of Justice. And<br />
the second point is: you said during the election campaign that if<br />
this approach failed the next step would probably be cessation of<br />
relations with France. Does that still stand?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: On the first one, the Prime Minister of New Zealand<br />
has not declined I think that was your word to join in the Australian<br />
approach to the International Court of Justice. The Prime Minister of<br />
New Zealand has already said that he will make available to Australia<br />
the considerable scientific data that New Zealand has collected on this<br />
matter. It's quite probable that New Zealand can make out a stronger<br />
case for nuisance in the legal sense nuisance arising from the<br />
French tests than Australia can do. The Attorney-General of New Zealand,<br />
Dr. Martyn Findlay, is awaiting the return of Senator Lionel Murphy,<br />
our Attorney-General from London and Washington to concert further<br />
approaches in this matter. Senator Murphy, as you know, has been<br />
discussing this matter with likely witnesses and likely counsel in<br />
London. Dr. Findlay will be taking an early opportunity to discuss<br />
these matters with Senator Murphy and other matters which as you know<br />
Senator Murphy has been raising in London. I never used the word in<br />
the policy speech about cessation of diplomatic relations. I think I<br />
used the word suspension. This is one of the contingencies. I want<br />
to emphasise that we do not assume that France will in fact go ahead<br />
with these tests. And furthermore if a favourable decision is given<br />
by the World Court still less would we assume that France would not<br />
obey the Court's decision.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, on that question can we take firstly that the<br />
ratification of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty is linked with<br />
the possible approach to the World Court in the sense that it will<br />
strengthen Australia's hand?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. It's part of a pattern that we will adopt to<br />
strengthen all means of arms limitation not least nuclear arms<br />
limitation. Q. Well, sir, New Zealand I understand one of the contingencies<br />
mentioned was the possibility of sending w.. arships into the testing<br />
zone if the tests go on. Has Australia ruled out any possibility<br />
of joining such a move?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is a contingency. Australia has not ruled<br />
out co-operation in such a contingency. New Zealand, however, takes<br />
the same attitude as Australia. She does not assume that France will<br />
not heed the resolution of the General Assembly last November and<br />
particularly any decision by the World Court. </p>
<p>Neither country assumes that France will carry out further nuclear<br />
weapons tests in our hemisphere.<br />
Q. Sir, on a different subject, there are suggestions that the<br />
submissions to the late Mr. Justice Moore in the Steel Price Inquiry<br />
will not be made public. Does this procedure meet with your eicpressed<br />
hope, for open government and for a public prices justification and<br />
in answering this question, I wonder whether you might go on and tell<br />
us whether you received any applications for similar inquiries from'<br />
other industries and would you expect to, and would you like to?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't heard any more about the B. H. P. matter which<br />
Mr. Justice Moore is reporting upon since last Friday. I don't know if<br />
there has been anything further on this matter. I haven't got the<br />
letter to Mr. Justice Moore with me. My memory is that we said that he<br />
could conduct the inquiry in any way he saw fit, and my memory is that<br />
he made a public statement saying that he would be sitting on one day<br />
in public when any interested persons could make oral submissions to<br />
him.<br />
And I think this also involved oral submissions on written submissions<br />
which had been made to him. So whether these documents are made public<br />
before Mr. Justice Moore makes his report depends on Mr. Justice Moore.<br />
Furthermore, whether he refers to them in his report, of course,<br />
depends on him. Or if he incorporates them, or quotes them in his<br />
report. But the report will be public. There has been a letter from<br />
another company. I discussed what the reply should be with Mr. Crean<br />
and I haven't seen the reply I imagine it's been sent but perhaps<br />
I shouldn't say any more until I know whether it was sent or what<br />
suggestions or responses were made in it.<br />
Q. You might answer which company, if you can, sent the letter to<br />
you and if you've replied to it, and I'd like to know whether the<br />
Government is going to put its own submission to Mr. Justice Moore<br />
on these?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, we hadn't prepared a submission last Friday.<br />
I don't know what the position is since then as I told you. I think<br />
the company's name was mentioned, wasn't it? Will you wait has<br />
it been mentioned?. . the name hasn't been mentioned, so I won't give<br />
you the name.<br />
Q. On the same subject, it's been suggested that the B. H. P. inquiry<br />
is going to be somewhat self-defeating simply because if you want Mr.<br />
Justice Moore to report as quickly as you've suggested you won't really<br />
have time to do much more than look over the B. H. P. books and the third<br />
term of reference of any other material he considers relevant is really<br />
quite meaningless in this context. Could you comment on that, and is<br />
it possible that although obviously you want to get this inquiry<br />
completed quickly, you might have a second run at it over a longer and<br />
more comprehensive look at B. H. P. and the steel industry in general<br />
before the next application for a price increase?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Gentlemen, I frankly didn't expect that you'd be<br />
asking questions still on this matter because it was announced I think<br />
on Friday week and we did have a press conference last Tuesday and I<br />
haven't got the letter in front of me. I do remember some criticisms<br />
such as you've stated. I don't believe that anything but good can come<br />
out of Mr. Justice Moore's inquiry. His report clearly it can't be<br />
as effective as a report by a standing statutory commission, but it is<br />
the first time that any company has agreed to have such an inquiry<br />
that the Government has been able to provide such an inquiry. </p>
<p>It will be open to the tribunal to look at the steel industry in the<br />
light of everything that has transpired in the last month and between<br />
then and the functioning of the tribunal itself. I don't think I used<br />
the word tribunal I should have used the word tribunal. It will be<br />
open to the tribunal to take all these things into account, including<br />
the matters that Mr. Justice Moore is inquiring into and reporting on.<br />
But, unequestionably, Mr. Justice Moore's report will be very helpful<br />
to the Government in framing the legislation.<br />
Q. Sir, did Cabinet consider the question of export incentives to<br />
manufacturers, which are worth about $ 90 million a year and do you<br />
feel that these should be retained?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Cabinet has not considered this matter. I'll express<br />
a collective view if and when the matter is considered.<br />
Q. Sir, did Mr. Kirk approach you in New Zealand and ask you to modify<br />
your stand on the transit through Australia of the South African Rugby<br />
team to New Zealand?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q. It wasn't mentioned at all?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There was no mention about any modification of the<br />
Australian Government's policy in this matter none at all.<br />
Q. Are you agreeable to modify your stand, before that you wouldn't<br />
allow them transit through Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Not at all.<br />
Q. You won't modify it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. We will not condone the South African Government's<br />
policies of apartheid in any form.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, looking beyond the inquiry into the national<br />
compensation case would it be envisagel that this would replace Third<br />
Party Insurance or be in parallel withiThird Party Insu] rance?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is a matter for the committee to inquire into<br />
and report on. As you', 1ll see from the suggested terms of reference,<br />
it is being asked to look into the question whether rights under the<br />
scheme should be in substitution for all or any rights now existing.<br />
The Commonwealth Parliament if I may venture an opinion myself<br />
would not be able to pass laws which would preclude negligence actions<br />
in the Courts of the States. The Co* m monwealth Parliament can, however,<br />
under the social services paragraph of Section 51 inserted at the<br />
referendum in 1946 and, I hope, under the insurance paragraph which<br />
has been in the Constitution from the outset be able to provide<br />
attractive alternatives to such expensive, incomplete, time-consuming<br />
procedures as actions in court for injuries arising from accidents<br />
on the roads ( Third Party) or at work ( Workers' Compensation).<br />
Therefore, if I may hazard an opinion, it is likely that the<br />
Commonwealth's National Comppnsation Scheme will make other forms of<br />
compensation redundant. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Q. Sir, is the Commonwealth intervening or contemplating intervening<br />
in the oil tanker dispute in New South Wales in view of the fact that<br />
a national stoppage is being threatened?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The oil tanker dispute of course is one which only<br />
concerns governments insofar as they've been tardy, in fact irresponsible<br />
in bringing in legislation Commonwealth and State to cover this<br />
situation. The dispute arises through a demarkation or<br />
representational issue this quite absurd position that we have in<br />
Australia where unions can be separate legal entities in the Federal<br />
arbitration system and in four of the State arbitration-. systems<br />
New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia.<br />
I've been appalled to see yet another instance such as this arising<br />
from this situation. The Labor Party's commitment as you'll know from<br />
the platform, as amended at Launceston in June 1971, is to pass laws<br />
for the integration of organisations registered under the Federal Act<br />
and their branches registered under State legislation, and the<br />
registration of a Federal registered union or its branch under any<br />
relevant State legislation. You might remember that Mr. Cameron and I<br />
have raised this matter throughout the lifetime of the last Parliament<br />
in questions and, in Mr. Cameron's case, in speeches. I'd like to<br />
quote from the judgment of the Commonwealth Industrial Court on<br />
February 1969 in the leading case of Moore and Doyle: " A system of<br />
trade union organisation is urgently needed which would enable the<br />
one body to represent its relevant members inh both the Federal and<br />
State arbitration systems and it should be possible for Federal and<br />
State authorities to examine the question whether organisations and<br />
trade unions can be provided with such a system. We'have decided to<br />
refer our judgment in this matter and these remarks to the Attorney-<br />
General for the Commonwealth in the hope that it may be possible after<br />
consultation between Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General, the<br />
trade unions both Federal and State and other interested Government<br />
authorities to arrange for the examination of the important<br />
organisational matters to which we have referred". That was a unanimous<br />
judgment by Chief Judge Spicer, Mr. Justice Smithers and, I think,<br />
Mr. Justice Kerr, now Chief Justice of New South Wales, and I regret<br />
to say that Federal and State Governments have not given the necessary<br />
legislation to their Parliaments, and in particular, as I understand<br />
from inquiries I've made this afternoon through Mr. Cameron, New<br />
South Wales and Queensland are objecting to giving State legislative<br />
status to unions registered under the Commonwealth system. ' I have it<br />
in miild to communicate with the two Premiers About this matter which<br />
has been outstanding for four years, come one month and two days from<br />
now. South Australia has passed some legislation which helps quite<br />
considerably. The Commonwealth can not pass legislation which covers<br />
the whole position by itself. We'll do what we can. But frankly,<br />
if occurances like this are to be avoided in the future, then the New<br />
South Wales and Queensland Parliaments have to pass laws as well as the<br />
Australian Parliament and we will see if we can do something about it.<br />
There is a meeting of the Labor Ministers Australian and State<br />
a month from today when another attempt will be made to deal with this<br />
subject then. But it's my hope that I'll be able to write to the<br />
Premiers well before that, pointing out that the public is suffering<br />
once again from the failure in our Federal system of the State<br />
Parliaments to co-operate with the Commonwealth. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Q. Sir, when you mentioned the decision on the fixing of the price for<br />
the Nomad aircraft, you mentioned it in-the context of an earlier<br />
statement of your own the fostering of production of areas in which<br />
I think you said there would be clearly local demand and you<br />
mentioned rolling stock, pipelines, shipping and fighter and light<br />
aircraft. Will policies relating to. producti ' on in these areas be<br />
subj'ect to strict analysis in terms of the economic efficiency of<br />
Australian production?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I hope so.<br />
Q. And particularly in the shipping industry. will you recommit<br />
the former Government's decision its second, decision to go against<br />
the Tariff Board Report on the Australian shipbuilding industry?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't want to comment.. on'th e-second one the<br />
shipbuilding. I'd like to talk to Mr.* Jones About this. I think he<br />
is considering this matter. But I am unable to commit him and it's<br />
not been discussed in the Cabinet. Can I give you the instance of<br />
rolling stock?<br />
There can be no question that the metropolitan railways in Australia<br />
are becoming less attractive because of ' the'age of the rolling stock.<br />
I forget the percentages, but it is something like 50 per cent of the<br />
rolling stock in Sydney and Melbourne is over 40 years old. In one<br />
State ( I think it's Victoria) nearly half the rolling stock dates from<br />
the First War and then we suddenly find a panic about wanting to order<br />
new rolling stock. There is a continuing need for decent rolling stock,<br />
signalling equipment and so on in the metr . opolitan railways and it will<br />
be our objective to consult with the States in having a proper program<br />
to see that there are carriages built-suitable for all these metropolitan<br />
systems on an efficient, competitive basis for a continuing program.<br />
It's quite absurd for a State Government all of a sudden to call tenders,<br />
maybe only in its own State and without any consultation with the other<br />
States or any consideration of tenderers in other States. We all know<br />
that there is a crying need to have replenishment of all this rolling<br />
stock and we ought to have a program in which all the authorities<br />
running the railways collaborate. I myself believe that that would be<br />
probably the Commonwealth.<br />
Q. Well, Sir, if I may ask a supplementary question to that on that<br />
specific issue of the rolling stock could you be a little bit more<br />
precise about what you mean by a program. Is this some Common-. zealth<br />
aid to companies or are you envisaging... what ' do you have in mind?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, no, no. The Bureau of Transport Economics has<br />
made a report you remember on some of the metropolitan railways systems.<br />
I think they're the systems of Sydney,. Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth.<br />
The Victorian Government didn't give enoug~ h information about<br />
Melbourne's metropolitan system. One of lhe features should be rolling<br />
stock and I would believe that the Bureau of Transport Economics, which<br />
has reported on the age of the rolling stock, should make recommendations<br />
on a program for adequate vehicles to meet the demand, particularly<br />
the demand, if rail transport becomes more attractive and competitive.<br />
For instance, it is quite likely that we would be able to have a tenyear<br />
program to see that all rolling stock in the metropolitan areas<br />
was at least built since the last war. But there are several companies<br />
which would be attracted to tool up for sudh a program in several of<br />
the States and this could I can't myself see why the rolling<br />
stock can't be effectively planned on the basis of all the State<br />
capitals. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
Q. Sir, in view of the failure of one of the engines on the two-engine<br />
BAC-111 to New Zealand on Friday, have you considered getting an<br />
aircraft with more engines a larger aircraft for Prime Ministerial<br />
use and overseas trips?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, well these things don't worry me of course.<br />
I've flown as you know for so many years I'm quite inured to these<br />
things.. The most distressing incident I can remember was coming from<br />
Sydney in a Friendship when both motors stopped. And there was<br />
another, I believe that some of you will recall, going across Bass<br />
Strait when all the motors in a Viscount stopped a minister believed<br />
to be at the controls. But nobody could remain unmoved at the<br />
reaction of the young men and women who were jravelling with me.<br />
They have their lives before them. I have an obligation to them and<br />
to those who depend upon them and those whom they may hereafter beget.<br />
There were some persons of more mature years advisers from the<br />
Public Service I thought that the Treasury would cop . anything, but<br />
I was distressed how they went to pieces under this stress. I did my<br />
best to comfort them. Ladies and gentlemen; this is too distressing<br />
for me to discuss further. It's enough for me to say that I conducted<br />
myself with the usual savoir faire and aplomb. The only thing that<br />
distresses me is that so many of you gentlemen that were proposing<br />
to come with us to Djakarta in this type of aircraft have cancelled<br />
your reservations. I will consider the matter. But I can say that<br />
there was a Defence representative with us and the emergency<br />
concentrated his mind wonderfully on this incident.<br />
Dr. Johnson would be proud of him. / 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
Q. Prime Minister, I'd like to go back to the oil dispute.<br />
You've mentioned long-term solutions to this type of problem<br />
but will you be taking any action in the short-term to get these<br />
men back to work?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not contemplating any sudden ad hoc approach<br />
on this matter. It is a basic fault in our legislation, one which<br />
the Commonwealth Industrial Court highlighted and stressed in very<br />
strong terms which I quoted to you nearly four years ago. Well, the<br />
new Australian Government will be doing something about it and asking<br />
the State Governments which are in default to do something about it<br />
too. It is a very clear example where the public have been let down<br />
by inaction for four years.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, on your Cabinet announcement regarding the<br />
commercial broadcasting licence in Canberra, am I correct from the<br />
way you expressed it, it seemed to me that you were saying that<br />
you couldn't proceed with it because Senator McClelland had indicated<br />
to Cabinet that any decision would be subject to legal appeal and<br />
that you were concerned that this legal appeal would perhaps be<br />
successful. Is that a correct interpretation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I didn't forecast it would be subject to legal<br />
appeal but what I amn saying is that the Australian Broadcasting<br />
Control Board has been reluctant, and many people would think ineffective,<br />
in insisting upon conditions which it has laid down for<br />
radio and T. V. licences because it believes, and I forget the name<br />
of the trade body concerned but it's the organisation of commercial<br />
radio stations, has given'legal opinions to the Board saying, ah, you<br />
can't do that to us'. The Act is weak. Well, we want to oblige<br />
them. We want to strengthen the Act.<br />
Q. Sir, Mr Gordon Bryant, during his tour of northern Australia<br />
just recently said that the Federal Government should take direct<br />
responsibility for the Palm Island Aboriginal settlement.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: He's quite right.<br />
Q. The basic response of the Queensland Government to this is<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh. It's all right. I haven't read the papers but<br />
I know what it'll be.<br />
Q. What they've said is basically that they'd be prepared to accept<br />
this if the Commonwealth Government would take responsibility for<br />
all Aboriginal settlements. Have you considered this or are you<br />
likely to do this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, but I think it'd be a great improvement.<br />
Q. You are likely to do this?<br />
PRIM4E M4INISTER: Well, I haven't discussed it with Mr Bryant,<br />
but we are prepared to take all action which is necessary or<br />
desirable to discharge the obligations which the Australian people<br />
imposed overwhelmingly upon the national Parliament in the<br />
referendum in mid-1967. The national Parliament has the<br />
obligation it certainly has the opportunity we believe it has<br />
the obligation, to see that the Aboriginal residents of Australia<br />
have every opportunity that the Australian people as a whole can </p>
<p>10<br />
make for them in their country.<br />
Q. And this would include a direct Commonwealth financial<br />
responsibility? PRIME MINISTER: Well, the Commonwealth can conduct any<br />
reservations insofar as reservations are still an appropriate<br />
form of advancement for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders.<br />
I don't want there to be any suggestion that this is a matter<br />
of State sovereignty. That is garbage. The Australian Parliament<br />
was given this responsibility. We intend to discharge it.<br />
By the way, I'm told that this is being broadcast and I should<br />
therefore make it quite plain that my references to my staff and to<br />
my advisers on the Tasman crossing were completely facetious. They<br />
didn't refer to any living persons.<br />
Q. Sir, I hope this is non-political to the extent that<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh I'm sure coming from you... Is Channel 9<br />
taking this?<br />
Q. To the extent that both sides of the Parliament are involved,<br />
have you any views on the principle of employing close relatives on<br />
personal staff, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You mean Ministers' personal staffs?<br />
Q. Not necessarily ministers, also the other side of the<br />
Parliament as well.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, I mean people who are ministers in a<br />
government of any political complexion. I accept that your remarks<br />
are completely bipartison and dispassionate.<br />
Whom a Minister appoints, or any parliamentary office bearer<br />
appoints to his staff is entirely a matter for him.<br />
Q. I accept that Sir, but have you any views on the principle<br />
of it?<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER: No. I just state the only principle there can be.<br />
In this case Ministers are given the right to appoint people of<br />
their own choice and to sack people if they like and whom they<br />
appoint and whom they sack is a matter for them.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, last month you wrote to the Premier of..<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm sorry, there's someone<br />
Q. Oh. It's all-right he's my boss.<br />
Q. May I continue, Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, well I mean I don't want to come into any<br />
of these industrial disputes<br />
Q. Last month you wrote to the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Reece,<br />
recommending an urgent joint Commonwealth/ State inquiry into the<br />
preservation of Lake Pedder. Mr Reece has declined to join in that.<br />
Do you personally believe it is still important that such an inquiry<br />
be held? </p>
<p>11<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not going to express any personal views<br />
in these matters at all. I'll express a collective view. It<br />
doesn't come within my own ministerial responsibility and if whenthis<br />
matter is considered by the Cabinet I will express the Cabinet<br />
view. Q. Sir, Mr Cameron, the Minister for Labour, has forecast that<br />
unemployment will rise to a record 150,000 this month. Does the<br />
Government consider that further economic stimulus is warranted?<br />
PRIME MI1NISTER: I believe that if you want to have a more<br />
significant answer on this matter you ought to discuss it with<br />
Mr Cameron or Mr Crean in whose responsibilities this subject mainly<br />
falls. The great difficulty which has emerged, perhaps I myself<br />
can say is, that there can be a situation where economic conditions<br />
in general are favourable but there is still a large number<br />
unemployed by Australian or Western European standards, and there<br />
is a particular difficulty of course in people of maturer years<br />
getting another job if they lose one. And they can still remain<br />
unresolved where general conditions are quite prosperous or buoyant.<br />
Now it is this sort of matter where Mr Cameron and Mr Crean are<br />
particularly giving their attention. They want to see that there<br />
are retraining schemes made available in Australia such as there<br />
are in many Western European countries Scandinavia in particularand<br />
I think now in the United States. There are new structural<br />
features about the unemployment situation.<br />
Q. Sir, one questicn on staff again. Have you yet decided how<br />
big the staff of the opposition should be. Have you approved any<br />
staff arrangements there and if so can you tell us how you see the<br />
proportions, the cut up say between the Liberal and Country Parties<br />
and the D. L. P.?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I've only given a general attention to this since<br />
our last Press Conference. I'm looking at the increased number and<br />
status of the staff accorded to the 27 ministers in this Government<br />
compared with the 27 ministers in the late Government and, I would<br />
offer my present information is to offer to the non-government<br />
parties in each House/ gimilar proportionate increase in numbers and<br />
status of their staff. I can't at this stage make any suggestion<br />
as to how this would be split up, but my general idea is that there<br />
should be a similar increase in numbers in let me use the word<br />
non-government parties. I don't want to be drawn into this argument<br />
as to which party or parties constitute the Opposition.<br />
Q. Sir, on that subject, you said that who a Minister appoints<br />
to his staff is a matter for him alone but we, the taxpayers pay<br />
the salaries, could I ask you the reasons for the appointment of<br />
Professor Harry Messel as a part-time adviser to Senator Murphy at<br />
I understand a salary of $ 11,000 a year with overseas trips as<br />
optional extras?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Professor Messel is not a member of Senator<br />
Miurphy's staff in the sense as are people about whom the previous<br />
questions w. ere asklled. Professor Messel is in the same position as<br />
any otner advisers. He is of course very well known in his<br />
consideration and exposition of scientific matters and he has<br />
been engaged by Senator Murphy to advise him on scientific matters<br />
particularly of course the pending litigation about the French<br />
nuclear tests. He is helping in finding witnesses in this case.<br />
My memory is'that his fee is not what you say, but I don,' t know </p>
<p>12<br />
what it is. But anyway I shouldn't rely just on my memory of<br />
what his fee is in this matter.<br />
Q. To clarify that, Sir, are you saying that the appointment<br />
is only while the fuss over the French tests lasts?<br />
PRIM1E MINISTER: I think it's only for this year<br />
Q. Because I would have thought it would be more appropriate<br />
to advise Mr Morrison, the Minister for Science.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, but the litigation is in the hands of the<br />
Attorney-General.<br />
Q. Sir, it's only a temporary appointment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well he's engaged for this year. There are a<br />
great number of advisers that the Government engages in all fields.<br />
This is one scientific adviser on litigation.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Gentlemen I think you have had a statement from<br />
me on the death of President Lyndon Johnson. I don't know if you want<br />
me to repeat it here.<br />
Gentlemen, Lyndon Johnson will be remembered as one of the<br />
great reforming presidents of the United States. Nothing should<br />
be allowed to diminish the memory of his achievement. He came to<br />
office in the most difficult and tragic circumstances and he assumed<br />
his great responsibilities with valour and distinction. He went on<br />
to secure in the Presidential election in 1964 the greatest plurality<br />
in the history of the Republic. Under his administration the<br />
Congress was among the most active in his country's history with a<br />
record of achievement and innovation in social and welfare<br />
legislation unmatched in our generation. In all such domestic<br />
matters he was the greatest president since Franklin D; Roosevelt.<br />
President Johnson involved his country more deeply in the Vietnam<br />
War than his predecessors. He was in a real sense a victim of this<br />
disastrous conflict yet no one would have welcomed more warmly the<br />
present steps towards a peaceful settlement. Australians have vivid<br />
and cordial memories of his visits to Australia in 1942, in<br />
October 1966 :. tnd in December 1967. He was the only American President<br />
to have visitel. this country while in office and he visited it twice<br />
in office. His presence at the memorial service for the late Prime<br />
Minister Harold Holt was a signal demonstration of his affection<br />
for the Australian people and his own high estimation of the value<br />
of the Australian-American alliance. On behalf of the Australian<br />
Government I extend to his family and to the American people our<br />
profound sympathy in the loss they have sustained.<br />
Q. On that very question, is there any proposal by yourself, your<br />
Ministers or members of the non-government parties to attend the<br />
funeral?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: At the moment I am inquiring to see what other<br />
countries are doing. </p>
