STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE NON P J KEATING,<br />
EXPANSION OF UNITED STATES EXPORT ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM<br />
The Australian Government strongly objects to the increased<br />
allocation of subsidised wheat under the US Export<br />
Enhancement Program ( EEP) 7id the extension of the program<br />
to new markets, as announced by the US Administration early<br />
this morning ( Australian time).<br />
With US wheat exports in 1992-93 expected to be around<br />
32 million tonnes, the announcement of a 29.1 Million tonne<br />
allocation of subsidised wheat means that export subsidies<br />
will now be available to cover almost all US exports in this<br />
commodity. We deeply regret that domestic political pressures have<br />
overridden a US commitment to the pursuit of a less<br />
corrupted international trading environment for farm<br />
products. The latest measures are hard to square with<br />
assurances by the US Administration that the EEP will be<br />
implemented in a way that minfimises the effects on<br />
Australia's interests. They also threaten to escalate<br />
further the trade-subsidy war between the United States and<br />
A major concern to Australia Is the inclusion of new markets<br />
within the scope of the EEP. Australia has frequently<br />
argued to the United States that it should not extend the<br />
EEP to new markets or new products. The extension of the<br />
EEP to South Africa and Pakistan is particularly<br />
regrettable. In Australia's view an expansion in the quantity and<br />
coverage of the EEP sends a very negative signal regarding<br />
the US commitment to the key Uruguay Round objective of<br />
securing an4 effective rollback on the use of export<br />
subsidies. TEL </p>
<p>TEL 2<br />
Australia and the United States both recogrnise the critical<br />
importance of the Uruguay Round to the liberalisation of<br />
international trade, including agriculture, and Australia<br />
urges the United States to recommuit its very considerable<br />
political strength to the conclusion of the Round.<br />
The Australian Government will register its concerns about<br />
this announcement most strongly and at high levels with the<br />
US Administration. The Minister for Trade and Overseas<br />
Development, Mr Kerin, will take up these issues during a<br />
visit to Washington later this month. The EEP will be a<br />
major item on the agenda of the Australia-US bilateral<br />
agricultural trade consultations which are scheduled to be<br />
held in Canberra on 15 September.<br />
Australia will use every available opportunity including<br />
action in the GATT to pursue vigorously with the Units&amp;<br />
States and the European Community its longstanding concerns<br />
about the use of export subsidies in agricultural trade.<br />
