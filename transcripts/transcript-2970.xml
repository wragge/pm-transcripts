J , AUSTHALLIA Press Statement No. 112<br />
13 July 1973<br />
NATIONAL ABORIGINES DAY<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today issued the<br />
following statement to mark National Aborigines Day<br />
( Friday 13 July).<br />
In my election policy speech I said that<br />
' There is one great group of Australians who have<br />
been denied their basic rights to the pursuit of<br />
happiness, to liberty and indeed to life itself<br />
for 180 years...' I referred to the Aboriginal<br />
Australians whose ancestors settled this continent<br />
at least 30,000 years ago.<br />
It is appropriate on National Aborigines Day<br />
that newer arrivals to this country recall that we<br />
have dispossessed the Aboriginal Australians, and in<br />
our settlement and development of this country have wrought<br />
great damage to Aboriginal society.<br />
The Australian Gove'rnment is undertaking programs<br />
which will be developed in consultation with them, to ensure<br />
that the Aboriginal people shall enjoy the rights and<br />
opportunities they are entitled to as Australian citizens<br />
and shall enjoy a full and free life in Australian society.<br />
I hope that 1973 will come to be seen as a watershed<br />
in Aboriginal affairs. The Australian Government is assuming<br />
the responsibilities to Aboriginal pepple accorded to it by<br />
the Referendum of 1967. The Australian Government now accepts<br />
full responsibility for policy in Aboriginal affairs and is<br />
establishing a direct relationship with Aboriginal communities,<br />
and indi , viduals throughout the nation. We will maintain this<br />
special rdsponsibility to and relationship with Aboriginal<br />
people for as long as they themselves, desire it.<br />
The Government's undertakings in Aboriginal affairs,<br />
as defined in the Labor Party's policy platforms' are clear.<br />
We are carrying out these commitments. </p>
<p>The underlying principle of the Australian Government's<br />
-approach in Aboriginal affairs may be briefly described as self<br />
determination. We believe that Aboriginal communities and<br />
individuals must themselves decide the pace and nature of<br />
their future development. The situation where policies have<br />
been developed and special programs administered exclusively<br />
by whites must be changed. At the local and at the national<br />
level emphasis must shift towards Aboriginal control and<br />
responsibility. At the local level, to assist Aboriginal people to<br />
exercise autonomy in matters of interest to them, we will be<br />
introducing into the Parliament legislation to enable Aboriginal<br />
groups and communities to incorporate forlthe conduct of their<br />
own affairs. These incorporated societies will be set up for purposes<br />
chosen by their Aboriginal members and will return them their own<br />
decision-making processes. They will enable them to choose their<br />
own leaders and executives in ways they will themselves decide.<br />
At the national level, Aborigines will be choosing the<br />
members of a national consultative body to advise the Government.<br />
Increasing numbers of Aborigines will also be recruited both into<br />
administrative positions connected with Aboriginal affairs and<br />
into other areas of the Australian Public Service.<br />
Self determination implies a degree of economic independence.<br />
Economic deprivation is one of the most crippling of Aboriginal<br />
handicaps. Programs to support and encourage Aboriginal<br />
enterprises and to enable Aboriginal people to continue their<br />
education and vocational training are vital.<br />
There are many Aboriginal communities whose way of life<br />
depends on their land being secured to them. It is my<br />
Government's firm policy to vest such land in the Aboriginal<br />
communities concerned. We appointed an Aboriginal Land Rights<br />
Commissioner to investigate how this might best be done and<br />
expect to receive his prelimi'nary report within a few weeks.<br />
In the meantime, we are helping Aboriginal communities to<br />
acquire land outside reserves, and are providing $ 5 million<br />
per year for the next ten years for this purpose.<br />
We believe that Government services to Aboriginal<br />
communities should be of comparable standard t6 those enjoyed<br />
by the general population. Adequate services must be provided<br />
by the appropriate Government and local authorities in fields<br />
such as health, education, social welfaite and communications.<br />
The Government trusts that all Australians will<br />
support it in the pursuit of these objectives.<br />
