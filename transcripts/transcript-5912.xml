&amp; AAhI ECHECK AGAINST DELIVER1Yo<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 21 SEPTEMBER 1982<br />
STATEMENT ON THE ROYAL COMMISSION<br />
INTO THE AUSTRALIAN MEAT INDUSTRY, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
I present the Report of the Royal Commission into the Australian<br />
meat industry. I seek leave to make a statement. In mid-August<br />
1981, discoveries were made in the United States of horse meat<br />
having been substituted for beef by an Australian meat export<br />
establishment. Immediate steps were taken both in the USA and<br />
Australia to retain meat from the establishment concerned. As<br />
a result of these discoveries the Minister for Primary Industry<br />
took a number o-fimmediate steps to which I shall later refer in<br />
more detail. When this substitution became public knowledge in<br />
both countries there was a public outcry, particularly in<br />
Australia. Allegations of widespread malpractice were made in<br />
this Parliament and in Victoria. Despite the immediate<br />
effectiveness of the measures taken at that time the Australian<br />
meat industry had been severely tarnished.<br />
It was imperative that Australia's international reputation<br />
be cleared. The Government believed that the only means by<br />
which this could be achieved to the satisfaction of everyone<br />
in the community was through the establishment of a Royal<br />
Commission of high standing and repute to examine the matter.<br />
Letters patent appointing the Honourable Mr Justice Woodward to<br />
conduct the Royal Commission were issued by his Excellency<br />
the Governor-General on 12 September 1981.<br />
The Commission was charged with inquiring into:<br />
WIfether administrative arrangements and procedures<br />
for the supervision of the handling of meat for<br />
export are adequxate to ensure that all meat exported<br />
from Australia meets the requirements prescribed by-law;<br />
Whether malpractices are occurring, or have occurred,<br />
in the handling of meat for export or the exportation of<br />
meat; Allegations made, whether in public or to a Minister,<br />
Department or Authority of the Commonwealth, of<br />
malpractices alleged to have occurred during the past<br />
ten years, in the handling of meat for export or in the<br />
exportation of meat; / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Whether such allegations were dealt with in a manner<br />
that was adequate and effective;<br />
Whether in response to such allegations, any illegality<br />
or corruption occurred."<br />
As allegations had also been made in relation to malpractices in<br />
the Victoria LMeat Inspection Service, His Excellency the<br />
Governor of Victoria issued, on 15 September 1981, a Royal Commission<br />
which-ecomplemented the Commonwealth Commission but<br />
which related to meat for human consumption in Victoria. In<br />
November 1981, the Governor-General issued a further<br />
Commission in relation to meat for human consumption in the<br />
Northern Territory. Because of the considerable degree of<br />
overlap between the three commissions, enquiries in relation<br />
to all three were conducted jointly and concurrently. The<br />
Commissioner has discharged his three separate obligations by<br />
presenting a single Report. However, his concluding recommendations<br />
relating to the three separate governmental jurisdictions are<br />
set out separately..<br />
The Commission's Report was presented to the Governor-General<br />
and the Gocvernr of Victoria and forwarded to the Chief<br />
Minister of the Northern Territory on 17 September. The Caunissioner<br />
recommended that Appendix H, which is a separate volume to the<br />
Report, not be released until after criminal proceedings against<br />
those named or referred to in it have been completed.<br />
At the outset I should say that on a dispassionate reading the<br />
findings of the Royal Commission are overwhelmingly<br />
positive. The Commission has commended the Department and<br />
the Minister in relation to their actions in the wake<br />
of the substitution incident. while there was a great deal<br />
wrong with the meat inspection system prior to the substitution<br />
incident, the Royal Commissioner has found that actions taken<br />
since then have been the appropriate ones. He has also endorsed<br />
most of the proposals advanced by the Department of Primary<br />
Industry for further improving the systmu. The positive suggestions<br />
the Commissioner has made are being and will be followed up<br />
vigorously.<br />
Before going into the Royal Commission Report in detail it would<br />
be useful for Honourable Members if I recalled the total<br />
background against which the Royal Commission enquiry was held.<br />
The. meat industry is one of Australia's vital rural industries.<br />
The estimated value of production last year was $ 3.2 billion<br />
more than a quarter of the gross value of rural production. It<br />
is a substantial export earner with exports of $ 1.3 billion<br />
to some 60 overseas markets.<br />
The problem of wasteful dual meat inspection services in the<br />
four larger states has bedevilled the industry for many years.<br />
Following overseas complaints many years ago, thoriginal Camrcnwealth<br />
Veterinary Service was expanded to an export inspection service<br />
in all states. New United States laws in 1963 and 1967<br />
required greater Commonwealth controls. In 1964 some states,<br />
concerned at the increased Commonwealth role in meat inspection,<br />
sought and obtained agreement that state and Commonwealthi<br />
inspectors work side by side in export establishments. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Over the years this situation has led to costly duplication<br />
and some fragmentation of administrative controls. Between<br />
1972 and 1978 there were no fewer than six major state or<br />
Commonwealth enquiries into meat inspection. At* all these<br />
times the objective of the Commonwealth was to participate in any<br />
reasonable arrangements to achieve a single inspection service.<br />
However because of the attitude of some states no progress was<br />
made in this direction. In November 1978 the then Minister for<br />
Primary Industry, in yet another attempt to resolve the issue,<br />
established a Committee of Enquiry with terms of reference<br />
specifically directed to the solution of problems of meat<br />
inspection administration.<br />
I want to address this particular Enquiry in some detail<br />
because it was material in relation to an adverse finding by<br />
the Royal Commission against the Minister for Primary Industry.<br />
The importance of this matter will become clear later in my<br />
statement.<br />
The Chairman of this Enquiry, the Hon C R Kelly and the other<br />
Committee member, Mr W B Buettel presented their Report to the<br />
Minister for Primary Industry on 11 February 1980. The whole<br />
thrust of their Report tabled in Parliament on 27 February<br />
1980 was directed to the establishment of a new type of single<br />
meat inspection system, an Australian meat Inspection Service<br />
or " AMIS". In the presentation of the Report to the Minister On<br />
11 February 1980 evidence shows that the discussion was centred around<br />
the principles and proposed structure of a new AMIS. Mr Kelly<br />
also, at this brief meeting, raised the general issue of<br />
malpractice in meat inspection as reflected on pages-12, 13 and<br />
66 of his Report.<br />
However, at the time and as indeed evidenced in his Report, these<br />
allegations were of a most general nature, and have remained so.<br />
Neither in his Report, nor in his meeting with the Minister<br />
did Mr Kelly put forward any positive or specific evidence<br />
of names-of people engaged in serious malpractice. Even at<br />
the Royal Commission Mr Kelly was not able-to present any<br />
specific information and he has not done so'' since. If. he had they<br />
would have been passed on to the police for investigation.<br />
Some matters of immediate administrativa concern that arose<br />
in tria Kelly Enquiry were passed on to the Department by<br />
Mr Landos, the Departmental executive officer to the Kelly<br />
Committee. I havu been advised that--the Bureau of Animal Health<br />
followed up with their field staff, but as later events showed<br />
not vigorously enough. The notes taken by Mr Landos during<br />
the Enquiry were never referred to Mr Nixon by Mr Landos, or<br />
Mr Kelly. Mr Kelly's key recommendation for the establishment<br />
of an AMIS was studied but rejected by the states. The Commonwealth<br />
was prepared at all times to support AMIS. In further pursuit of<br />
an improved system, a Commonwealth/ state Committee of the<br />
Australian Agricultural Council, set up in 1980 following<br />
the Kelly Report, still failed to resolve the issue of a<br />
single service.<br />
At a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council in Hobart in<br />
February 1981 the Minister for Primary Industry took yet another<br />
initiative to resolve the issue. A high level working group was<br />
established to consider further options. Yet again, however, no<br />
satisfactory consensus emerged. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
It is quite clear that the central pre-occupation and the<br />
priorities attached to both the Kelly Report and the<br />
Commonwealth consideration of it was the achievement of a<br />
single meat inspection service.<br />
This is clear in Mr Kelly's evidence to the Royal Commission and<br />
I quote from page. 10264 of the transcript:<br />
" We were much more interested in the problems of administration<br />
and having inspectors available at the * right time and at-the<br />
right place than we were at that time about the bribery<br />
and corruption. That was a secondary matter to: us. Getting<br />
the machinery to construct it to work well was our first<br />
requirement."<br />
It is even more explicit on page 10267 of the transcript where<br />
Mr Kelly says,<br />
" I was much more interested in the welfare of AMIS than I<br />
I was of the comparatively minor skullduggery that I<br />
knew about."<br />
It is also explicitly clear on page 66 of the Kelly Report<br />
itself: " Starting a new system would give us the opportunity to<br />
turn over a new page."<br />
Mr Kelly goes on to say on page 66 that when the new page is<br />
turned, some specific problems in relation to inspector s and<br />
industry behaviour should be tackled with firm resolution.<br />
The priorities of the Kelly Committee were explicitly-clear.<br />
Their major concern and the thrust of their deliberations was<br />
on a single inspection service.<br />
As I have said, the Commonwealth Government has vigorously<br />
pursued the central recommendation of the Kelly Report. That<br />
is the issue of a single inspection service. Unfortunately,<br />
however, because of jurisdictional problems with some states<br />
these efforts met with little success.<br />
Let me now turn to the so-called issues of malpractice.<br />
As I will demonstrate in more detail not one specific allegation<br />
was put to the Minister ) 11 Mr Kelly. I will further demonstrate<br />
that the inherent problem oi, -hese matters has all along been the<br />
fact that-specific allegations which could . be pursued in an appropriate<br />
way were never given to the Minister. In the Royal Commission Report<br />
itself to which I shall shortly turn the Commissioner confirms<br />
in Paragraphs 2.34 and 2.35 that much of the information supplied<br />
initially on malpractices was " little better than rumour".<br />
And that it finally took a major joint police task force, including<br />
32 detectives from the Australian Federal Police and the Victc~ rian<br />
Police to produce satisfactory evidence.<br />
r-et me again emphasise that the Kelly Report was not a confidential<br />
document. It was tahled in Parliament shortly after it was<br />
received and sent to the stat-es a-d industry for public discussion.<br />
It is easy nowq to be wise after the event but I think it significant<br />
that to the best of my knowledge no question was asked of the Minister in<br />
this House on the malpractice allegations in the Kelly Report<br />
until the publication of an article by Alan Reid in the Bulletin<br />
on 22 September 1981. </p>
<p>I should also point out to the House that the Commissioner<br />
himself reports in Paragraph 2.75 that if he had had<br />
to report in April of this year, after seven months of<br />
investigations with the full powers of the Royal Commission that:<br />
" on the basis of the-evidence then avaibable I would have reported<br />
that malpractice in the industry was rare and felt compelled<br />
to recommend that, in the light of that finding many of the<br />
present security measures were unnecessary and , that no<br />
fundamental change in administrative arrangements was<br />
required to prevent or detect malpractices."<br />
In other words, in April 1982, some 26 months after Mr Kelly<br />
presented his Report-to the Minister for Primary Industry, the<br />
Royal Commission after seven months investigation still did not<br />
have any substantive_. evidence of malpractices. It took three<br />
more months of the.-investigations by the Royal Commission, with the<br />
full powers that such a Commission has, to satisfactorily uncover<br />
the malpractices of sections of the meat indiistry and of corrupt<br />
activities of some members of the-Mat Inspection Service and of<br />
some members of the-police.<br />
In relation to malpractices, I would-particularly like to draw<br />
attention to what the Commissioner said in Paragraph 7.4 of<br />
his Report:<br />
" The malpractice which led directly to the setting up of the<br />
Royal Commission, namely species substitution, _ proved to be<br />
the most serious malpractice which the Commission uncovered."<br />
The Commissioner goes on to say in Paragraph 7.6 that:<br />
" So far as the most serious cases of species substitution<br />
are concerned thereis no.. evidence-. thatthis occurred in the<br />
export trade before late 1979."<br />
Significantly therefore, according to the Commission, in<br />
relation to the most serious malpractice ever to come to light,<br />
species substitution in the export trade, there was little or<br />
no evidence to show that it occurred before Mr Kelly brought his<br />
Enquiry to an end.<br />
It is worth not'ing. that there is no reference to meat substitution<br />
in the Kelly Report and~ there is-absolutely no suggestion<br />
whatsoever that Mr Kelly raised this most serious malpractice'<br />
with the Minister. Let me now turn to the events of August<br />
1981 which led to the establishment of the Royal Commission.<br />
Following the first ever confirmed finding on 13 * August 1981<br />
of horsemeat in a shipment of Australian boneless beef to the<br />
United States the Australian meat industry found itself in<br />
a crisis situation with the potential of immense damage to<br />
it. The Minister for Primary Industry took immediate action.<br />
Establishments were de-registered, spot checks were introduced<br />
in all states, security and surveillance were immediately<br />
increased. </p>
<p>-6<br />
Further measures were introduced within days., A-new system was<br />
devised for security seals, a special task force was set up to<br />
co-ordinate a nationwide sampling and species testing programme, and<br />
police investigations were intensified.<br />
Shortly afterwards the Minister for Primary Industry introduced<br />
legislation to substantially increase penalties.. for illegal<br />
export of up to $ 100,000 fine or five years imprisonment or<br />
both; stringent* new security control measures were introduced<br />
in cold stores with the sealing of meat transport vehicles<br />
and containers; and an outside consultant was appointed to review<br />
these measures. The Minister for Primary Industry convened<br />
a special meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council on<br />
4 September to review the measures taken and to examine policies<br />
and practices for controlling knackeries, denaturing pet<br />
meat and identifying game meat for human consumption.<br />
The Minister for Primary Industry is to be commended for his<br />
prompt and decisive actions on this matter. As early as<br />
17 August the US Special Trade Representative Ambassador Brock<br />
expressed to him satisfaction with the way in which the Australian<br />
Government was dealing with this issue. This confidence of the<br />
United States administration was reflected in the release to the<br />
United States market on 4 September of 24,000 tonnes of<br />
Australian beef valued at $ 40 million.<br />
The Parliament now has before it the Report of the Royal<br />
Commission presided over the by the Honourable<br />
Mr Justice A E Woodward. I propose to take the terms of<br />
reference of thie-Royal Camiaission in the form the Royal Commission<br />
dealt with them and address myself to the Commissioner's findings<br />
in each.<br />
Firstly " the adequacy of administrative arrangements and<br />
procedures for the supervision of the handling of . meat<br />
for export"... The Commissioner's findings are that, whilst<br />
once seriously deficient, administrative procedures are now<br />
adequate for their purposes although still with room for improvement.<br />
The Government generally endorses the Commissioner's recommendations<br />
and will be pursuing them vigorously In doing so I point<br />
out that many of the recommendations have been or a~ e in the<br />
process of implementation.<br />
I would also like to point out that on the--central<br />
issue of a single inspection service, the Royal Commissioner<br />
has not made recommendations that went beyond what the<br />
Government is already doing. He has recognised the inherent<br />
nature of the problan arising from the need for the " Commonwealth<br />
to be involved to protect export markets, and the traditional<br />
position which the states take in relation to what they<br />
regard as their sovereign responsibilities. Nevertheless,<br />
that matter will also be pursued with full vigour, </p>
<p>-7<br />
I might point out that in respect of the matters I have already<br />
referred to, the Commissioner acknowledges in paragraph 1.19 that<br />
" Returning to the Department of Primary Industry<br />
itself, it is only fair to say thatunder instructions<br />
from its Minister, it acted promptly and effectively<br />
when the meat substitution scandal erupted."<br />
The Commissioner goes on in paragraph 1.21 to state that<br />
" Since then, &amp; nd during the Commission's hearings, the<br />
Department has, for the most part, reacted promptly<br />
and appropriately to problems that have been brought<br />
to light. It has not, as it might have done, sat<br />
back to await the Commission's recommendations. Instead<br />
it has, while keeping the Commission appropriately<br />
informed, continued to carry out its proper functions of<br />
administering the service and forward planning. This<br />
has culminated in the proposals set out in the Department's<br />
final submissions, which reflect the determination<br />
of the Minister and the Department to resolve the<br />
problems which -now stand revealed."<br />
What the Commissioner has said is clearly reflected by the<br />
establishment in March 1982 in the Department of Primary Industry<br />
of the Export Inspection Service which has been structured under<br />
a new legislative framework, the Export Control Act. The new<br />
Export Inspection Service was created with characteristics<br />
designed to overcome problems and inadequacies disclosed in the<br />
Commissioner's investigations. Features of the new inspection<br />
service are a strong decentralised management system, a strong<br />
compliance program, and an investigations unit capable of<br />
pursuing allegations of malpractice in co-operation with Federal<br />
Police and the Meat and Livestock Corporation.<br />
Further measures are being pursued to raise the calibre of<br />
inspection staff such as new inspection procedures and standards;<br />
new award and employment conditions, better aligned to industry<br />
requirements, and new training programs. Innovations proposed<br />
to increase the general efficiency of the industry include the<br />
introduction of Australia wide objective measurement and product<br />
descriptions for carcasses and meat, and the electronic<br />
transmission of all documentation and monitoring of product.<br />
In order that the industry itself should become more involved<br />
in the inspection process, and me more conscious of the costs<br />
of providing inspection services, the Department of Primary<br />
Industry has proposed arrangements to provide services as a<br />
tailor made package to each establishment, under contract, on<br />
a fee for service basis, and progressively transfer responsibility<br />
for the preparation of hygiene, quality control and product<br />
description to the companies themselves.<br />
The full implementation of many of the above arrangements still<br />
requires the agreement of unions, state governments and<br />
the meat industry. The Department of Primary Industry is<br />
currently engaging several consultants on key aspects of the<br />
revised system. / 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
I now wish to turn to the next of the terms of reference<br />
relevant to the Commonwealth " Malpractices in the Australian<br />
Meat Industry." In reference to this I would-first like to<br />
quote paragraph 7.2 of the Commissioner's findings:<br />
" I should say at the outset that I have no doubt that<br />
the industry has never been more free of malpractices<br />
than it is today. All references, unless otherwise<br />
stated, are to the past most of them applying<br />
particularly to the last two or three years."<br />
Further, I quote paragraph 1.22 of the findings:<br />
" I believe that, in consequence of the strong reaction<br />
of the Minister and the Department, and the<br />
establishment of this Royal Commission, the current<br />
level of malpractice in the industry is lower than<br />
it has ever been. This desirable situation should be<br />
vigorously maintained."<br />
There is not much doubt as evidenced in the Royal Commission<br />
hearings that there have been malpractices in this industry.<br />
By the very * nature of the industry and its widespread. geographical<br />
locations it may well be difficult to totally eradicate all<br />
instances of malpractice.<br />
However, it is to the full credit of the Minister for Primary<br />
Industry that the Commissioner considers the measures he has<br />
taken to have reduced the incidence of malpractice to an all-time<br />
historical low. Moreover, as the Commissioner points out in<br />
paragraph 8.15 the matter should be kept in some perspective,<br />
and I quote: " In order to help keep the whole question of export<br />
quality in perspective it is worth noting that,<br />
against an overall rejection rate in USA of 0.5% in<br />
recent years, Australia's rate has been This<br />
compares with Canada's experience of 0.8% and New<br />
Zealand's<br />
I point out that the measurement in question is over a period<br />
of recent years. As the Commissioner says in paragraph 8.17<br />
" the record seems quite reasonable". Nevertheless, the Commissioner<br />
does refer to certain areas of malpractice where greater attention<br />
needs to be given and recommendations relevant to them will<br />
be processed as a matter of urgency.<br />
The Commissioner dealt with the next three terms of reference<br />
in one section of his Report and I will follow the same practice.<br />
These are " the handling of allegations of malpractices and<br />
whether they were dealt with in a manner that was adequate and<br />
effective, or, on the other hand, whether any illegality or<br />
corruption occurred." Taking the last point first, in paragraph<br />
1.66 the Commissicner concludes that apart from the possibilityand<br />
he puts it no higher than that of corruption relating to<br />
certain police officers and of a senior meat inspector and I<br />
quote: </p>
<p>9-<br />
" There is no evidence to suggest that there was any<br />
illegality or. corruption on the part of any Minister<br />
of the Crown, or any official, in response to any<br />
allegation of malpractice in the meat industry."<br />
On the point of allegations made to departments, the Commissioner<br />
has certain criticisms in relation to the Department of<br />
Primary Industry and the Federal Police. The deficiencies<br />
he points to will, I believe, be overcome by the new organisational<br />
procedures that I have referred to.<br />
Let me now turn to the question of ministerial responsibility.<br />
At the outset I want to define precisely what the Commissioner<br />
has actually said. The Commissioner in paragraph 1.61 says that:<br />
" Generally, such matters as were referred to<br />
Commonwealth Ministers were dealt with adequately<br />
and ef fectively.<br />
In paragraph 8.39 the Commissioner says:<br />
" Insofar as allegations were reported by the<br />
Department to Mr Nixon, I do not consider any<br />
criticism can be levelled at his handling of them."<br />
In paragraph 1.19 the Commissioner says:<br />
" Returning to the Department of Primary Industry<br />
itself, it is only fair to say that, under instructions<br />
from its Minister, it acted promptly and effectively<br />
when the meat substitution scandal erupted."<br />
And in paragraph 1.22:<br />
" I believe that, in consequence of the strong reaction<br />
of the Minister and the Department, and the establishment<br />
of this Royal Commission, the current level of malpractice<br />
in the industry is lower than it has ever been."<br />
As far as the Kelly Report is concerned, although he does so in the<br />
cntct of a passage wich is critical of action taken in relation to malpactices,<br />
the Caiuissicn makes the point in paragrapn 8.48 that:<br />
" They ( the Minister and is senior advisers) seem<br />
to have given all their attention to the central issue<br />
dealt with by the ( Kelly) Committee."<br />
That is, the question of a single meat inspection system.<br />
Evidence before the Commission clearly showed the strong and<br />
determined efforts made by the Minister to deal with these matters.<br />
It is clear that in respect of all of these matters, the Royal<br />
Commissioner has found that Mr Nixon behaved responsibly and<br />
effectively. There is only one point which the Commissioner<br />
is critical of the Minister and that is his handling of the<br />
Kelly Report in relation to malpractices. As the Commissoner says<br />
in paragraph 8.39: </p>
<p>" The only possible criticism of his handling of his<br />
responsibilities in this area relate to his<br />
reaction to the Report of the Kelly Committee of<br />
Enquiry in 1980."<br />
I will now examine in detail those areas where the Royal<br />
Commissioner has been critical of Mr Nixon. In paragraphs<br />
1.62 to 1.64 the Royal Commissioner says, first, that<br />
Mr Nixon paid insufficient attention to the findings of Mr Kelly<br />
and Mr Buettel. According to the Royal Commissioner, the<br />
Minister, having heard from a responsible source that there had<br />
been cases of bribery and abuse of power in his Department,<br />
should have taken more adequate and effective steps to deal with<br />
the matter.<br />
Let me again state unequivocally that the matters covered in<br />
these paragraphs had nothing whatsoever to do with meat<br />
substitution. If Mr Kelly had unearthed significant information<br />
about meat substitution, I am quite sure that he himself a<br />
farmer would have jumped up and down more than we ever saw<br />
him do in this House in relation to tariffs. He most certainly<br />
would-have made very strong representations to the Minister,<br />
or if not to him then to me. He did not.<br />
In addition, he would not have sat on such information until<br />
his Report was completed. He would have known the immense<br />
significance of such information, andhe would have acted on it<br />
immediately. The fact is. that Mr Kelly did not draw any such<br />
evidence to our attention.<br />
The conclusions drawn by the Royal Commission relate to different<br />
matters and-the Commission's-argument supporting its conclusions<br />
is to be found in paragraphs 8.39 to 8.45. This evidence boils<br />
down to two points:<br />
1. In relation to certain statements in the Kelly<br />
Report itself ( pages 12, 13, 66) the Minister did<br />
not act adequately and effectively; and<br />
2. That certain statements were made to the Minister<br />
in a meeting with Mr Kelly on 11 February 1980 and<br />
that these were not adequately followed up.<br />
To examine the Royal Commissioner's conclusions we must turn<br />
back to the specific evidence on the statewnts that were alleged<br />
to have been made to the Minister on 11 February 1980 and to<br />
the specific information contained in the Kelly Report. I shall<br />
deal with the 11 February meeting first. Let us be clear in<br />
dealing with this matter, that we are dealing with the issues which<br />
the Kelly Committee itself regarded as secondary to the major<br />
conclusions of the Report. This is evident from Mr Kelly's<br />
own evidence to the Royal Commission. For example on page 10264<br />
of the transcript he says: / 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
" We were much more interested in the problems of<br />
administration and having inspectors available at the<br />
right time and at the right place than we were at that<br />
time about the bribery-and corruption. That was a<br />
secondary matter to us. Getting the machinery to<br />
construct it to work well was our first requirement."<br />
And on page 10267:<br />
" I repeat it was a minor part of our duty that was laid<br />
on us when we were doing the Report and I was much<br />
more interested in the welfare of AMIS than I was of the<br />
comparatively minor skullduggery that I knew about."<br />
In assessing the significance of his meeting with the Minister,<br />
it is important to note what Mr Kelly himself said about<br />
various aspects of it. In his primary evidence on page 10243,<br />
Mr Kelly said:<br />
" The primary purpose of the meeting was to present<br />
the Report and any discussions had in relation to<br />
areas outside the terms of reference of the Committee<br />
would have been general and merely coincidental to the<br />
meeting."<br />
Then, in relation to the discussion itself, Mr Kelly referred<br />
to a minute prepared by Mr Landos which he said recorded that<br />
at the. meeting with the Minister, the Committee expressed<br />
strong views as to the sordid nature of the meat industry and<br />
meat inspection. However, later Mr Kelly was asked:<br />
" Is the position this in reality that you, apart from<br />
Mr Landos' minute or document that was referred to have<br />
no independent recollection of precisely what was said<br />
at the meeting with the Minister on 11 February at all?"<br />
He responded: " That is right, no precise memory." ( Transcript 10259).<br />
When he was then asked whether he was prepared to accept<br />
that what was in Mr Landos' document must be accurate he said:<br />
" No. I am not saying it must be accurate. I am<br />
prepared to say I repeat, I was startled and<br />
gratified to find that I myself had refreshed my<br />
own memory."<br />
As to the specifics discussed with the Minister, the question was<br />
put: Mr Kelly, you were asked whether or not at the meeting<br />
with the Minister you provided the specific names of<br />
particular places where malpractices were said to have<br />
happened, and my recollection is that you said that<br />
you either did not or that you had no recollection of<br />
doing so; is that correct?" / 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
Mr Kelly said:<br />
" That is right". ( Transcript page 10275)<br />
And when asked why he had not reported his findings tothe<br />
Commonwealth Police or to the Federal Police, Mr Kelly said:<br />
" Never even thought of it. It has nothing to do<br />
with me. My responsibility was to chair my Committee<br />
that had to examine this question of dual inspection<br />
problems. That was all I was worried about." ( Transcript<br />
page 10272).<br />
Mr Landos Lalso gave evidence ( page 10277A of the transcript) that:<br />
" By far the great majority, if not all, of the<br />
allegations received by the Committee were based on rumour<br />
or on second-hand evidence. The Committee found a great<br />
reluctance to for any people to pass on first-hand<br />
experience."<br />
He also stated ( page 10288 of the transcript) that the real<br />
purpose of the meeting was<br />
" to present the Report to the Minister and to stress<br />
to him the necessity of structural change with<br />
regard to the meat inspection arrangements."<br />
Mr Landos, when asked whether any examples of graft or misuse<br />
of inspector power were raised at the meeting, replied: ( page 10282)<br />
" I do not believe any specific examples were raised with<br />
the Minister."<br />
I should mention at this point that in the transcript of the<br />
Royal Commission evidence, and in paragraph 8.41 of the Report<br />
reference is made to notes prepared by Mr Landos during the<br />
Kelly Inquiry and to a minute he wrote sometime after the meeting<br />
between Mr Kelly and the Minister. This minute was designed as<br />
Mr Landos' final overall impressions of the Kelly'Enquiry. It<br />
was not a response to the meeting etween Mr Kelly and the Minister.<br />
It was prepared for internal Departmental use after a discussion<br />
with Mr Cleary<br />
The Royal Commissioner said of the suggestions in this minute:<br />
" They never reached the Minister" ( paragraph 8.43)<br />
Similarly, Mr Landos' notes never reached either the Minister<br />
or the Secretary of the Department.<br />
The evidence actually given by Mr Landos that no specific examples<br />
were raised with the Minister adds emphasis to the fact that the<br />
primary purpose of the Kelly Committee was to look into the<br />
structural change needed to make meat inspection arrangements<br />
effective. The Committee was concerned with the causes of any<br />
problems evident in meat inspection and regarded symptoms of<br />
malpractice as incidental to the primary purpose. 13 </p>
<p>13<br />
This if further confirmed by Mr Gee in giving evidence before<br />
the Royal Commission. In responding to a question of<br />
whether many of his discussions with the Minister were directed<br />
to the AMIS recommendation for a single inspection service, he<br />
respsponded: yes, that is correct and it is important,<br />
I think, to get that completely in context. That<br />
was the absolutely overriding public and political<br />
issue, to find a solution to the meat inspection<br />
administration." ( page 10338). / 14 </p>
<p>14<br />
Notwithstanding the fact that there was no specific information<br />
given the Minister the<br />
evidence clearly shows that the Minister spoke with Mr Gee<br />
and asked if there was anything that could be followed-up.<br />
When Mr Gee was asked whether in fact he followed-up problems<br />
of the kind raised by the Kelly Commnittee, he replied<br />
did not follow it up with Mr Kelly. I went to<br />
Mr Landos and enquired of him as to what evidence, what<br />
data they did have from their hearings and from their<br />
conversations and from the submissions they raised and<br />
John Landos related to me that there was nothing substantial,<br />
that there was nothing of what we would call hard evidence<br />
and I said, ' are you sure?' to my recollection, ' are you<br />
sure there is nothing that would warrant us investigating<br />
further or going to the police?' and he was of the<br />
opinion that there was not anything of that nature. On<br />
the basis of his advice I did not pursue it directly<br />
with Mr Kelly." 10339 of the transcript).<br />
Now I ask you how could the minister, given no specific<br />
information, have taken any further action to deal with these<br />
allegation3? I submit that on the basis of all the available<br />
evidence he could not have. Where is the substance on<br />
which a Minister could be blamed and condemned?<br />
There is another matter in the Royal Commission Report<br />
which disturbs me.<br />
The Report, on the top of page 259, quotes half of Mr Kelly's<br />
diary entry. I have confirmed that with Mr Kelly, whom I<br />
contacted on Sunday night, and it is confirmed in the full<br />
transcript of the evidence, *( page 10244). It is the half<br />
that is damaging toMr Nixon, rather than the half that<br />
would offer support for his action.<br />
The quote contained in paragraph 8.40, is as follows:<br />
" I went to Melbourne for the day to present meat<br />
report to the Minister, Peter Nixon. It was worth<br />
it because it gave me the chance to tell him a few<br />
of the notes that we could not put in the report,<br />
such as the bribery and blackmail which is so prevalent<br />
in the meat inspection game. Poor Peter is now to see<br />
what can be done."<br />
However, the full entry also contains the following words<br />
immediately after the previous sentence:<br />
" We were gratified today to hear that the Victorian<br />
Minister of Agriculture has stated bluntly that the<br />
present position cannot be allowed to continue. I told<br />
Nixon that both of us, Buettel and I would be prepared<br />
to help him get something done." </p>
<p>15<br />
Mr Kelly has advised me on the telephone yesterday that<br />
it is almost certain that the statement referred to by the<br />
Victorian Minister would have related to problems of dual<br />
administration of the Meat Inspection Service the central<br />
thrust of what the Kelly Committee Report was all about.<br />
Clearly, the full diary entry reinforces the priorities of<br />
the Committee. They were' concerned with the overwhelming<br />
complexity of the major problems of fixing up the administration<br />
arrangements for meat inspection.<br />
In my view the last reference in Mr Kelly's diary entry to<br />
helping get something done, clearly related to the develcpment<br />
and implementation of AMIS.<br />
The preoccupation of the Kelly Committee with the AMIS proposals<br />
is confirmed by Mr Buetell's account of the meeting. In a<br />
telephone discussion with the Secretary of the Department<br />
of Primary Industry on 19 September, Mr Buettel confirmed<br />
that the bulk of the meeting was concerned with the Committee's<br />
recommendations of AMIS. Mr Kelly spoke only in very general<br />
terms about " a lot of nonsense around the ridges".<br />
Having regard to the fact that the Minister took broad,<br />
vague allegations, indeterminantly made, and subsidiary to<br />
the main elements of the report having regard to the fact<br />
that he took these allegations sufficiently seriously to<br />
pass them on to Mr Gee, and that Mr Gee consulted Mr Landos<br />
who confirmed that there was nothing in the allegations<br />
that could be put to the police, I suggest that it is not<br />
possible to condemn the Minister on the grounds of failure<br />
to act. I suggest it is not possible to condemn him on<br />
the evidence about what was said at that meeting. I remind<br />
the House of Mr Landos' evidence, stated above, that the<br />
great majority of the evidence received by the Committee<br />
was based on rumour or second-hand evidence.<br />
I now come to the actual Report itself. As the Royal<br />
Commissioner has put it in paragraph 8.46:<br />
" I think it may be that Mr Kelly did not hammer home<br />
his concern in any very emphatic way, but he obviously<br />
said something about the problems he saw and the Report<br />
was there to be read; ! it was clear enough."<br />
Indeed the Report was there to be read but let us see if it<br />
has been properly read and if it was indeed clear enough.<br />
Presumably, the Royal Commissioner was referring to those<br />
paragraphs of the Report which he himself quoted. His first<br />
quotation was taken from the top of page 12 of the Kelly Report.<br />
This was as follows:<br />
" Complaints were received of excessive zeal at times stemming<br />
from a grievance, real or fancied, on the part of an<br />
inspector. It is a fact that production can be slowed by<br />
unwarranted stoppage of chains to the annoyance of employees;<br />
or condemnations, allegedly unwarranted, to the annoyance<br />
of management." ( page 12) </p>
<p>16<br />
If the Report had gone back a sentence or two, it would<br />
also have included in this particular quotation:<br />
" The Committee recognises the inspector's task to be<br />
a difficult one exposed to friction with both works'<br />
management and works' employees." ( page 11)<br />
And then the first sentence from the paragraph that<br />
the Report quoted is also omitted. This sentence reads:<br />
" Inspection is a matter of individual subjective<br />
judgment and opinion."<br />
In my view these two sentences give a quite different perspective<br />
to that first paragraph on page 12. Without specific evidence,<br />
what can a Minister do in relation to a sentence of that kind?<br />
The Royal Commissioner then quoted from the bottom of page 12<br />
and on to page 13. The quote reads:<br />
an inspector, if he wants to be vindictive, can<br />
press the stop button on a killing chain. This puts<br />
meat inspectors in positions of considerable industrial<br />
power. That this power has not been used more often is<br />
a tribute to the sense of responsibility of most meat<br />
inspectors, but it has been used. The feat that it may<br />
be used has encouraged some abattoirs managers to give<br />
inspectors gifts of meat, or to sell them meat at<br />
ridiculously low prices. It has been alleged that some<br />
managers have given inspectors this kind of inducement<br />
not only to ensure industrial peace, but to induce<br />
inspectors to turn a blind eye to procedures that give<br />
considerable financial advantage to management."<br />
I want to draw particular attention to one sentence in that<br />
quotation by the Royal Commissioner. It reads:<br />
" That this power has not been used more often is<br />
a tribute to the sense of responsibility of most<br />
meat inspectors, but it has been used."<br />
Here the Kelly Committee would seem to be saying that problems<br />
posed by excessive use of such power were rare, especially<br />
against the background that all works strenuously denied that<br />
they indulged in such practices as the next paragraph quoted<br />
by Commissioner Woodward makes plain.<br />
I do not believe in the light of all the circumstances, in<br />
the light of the fact that the priorities in the Kelly Report<br />
relatted to the establishment of AMIS and in the light of<br />
community concern at the existence of two meat inspection services<br />
rather than one I do not believe in the light of these<br />
facts that the quotations on pages 12 and 13 amount to sufficient<br />
substance to require Mr Nixon to take more action than he did.<br />
This view is significantly reinforced by the treatment given<br />
to a certain paragraph taken from page 66 or Mr Kelly's Report. </p>
<p>17<br />
As quoted by the Royal Commission that paragraph reads:<br />
one aspect of the meat industry which should be<br />
tackled with firm resolution is the problem of<br />
some managers trying to buy the co-operation of<br />
inspectors by giving them meat at ridiculously low<br />
prices, or countenancing excessive overtime claims,<br />
or of meat inspectors demanding cheap meat backed<br />
by the implied threat of slowing the killing chain<br />
or forcing higher offal or other condemnations if<br />
management is not compliant. Legislation should<br />
include heavy punishments for administrators, VO's,<br />
meat inspectors and management. That this kind of<br />
practice has been too common in the past we know<br />
too well. It must be stopped in the future." ( 8.42)<br />
I agree fully that if you take the words as quoted in the Royal<br />
Commissioner's Report, they seem to be saying in very plain terms<br />
that there is a certain matter that should be tackled immediately<br />
with firm resolution and that certain malpractices were mentioned.<br />
In fact that is not what the Kelly Committee said. That<br />
particular quotation does not accurately represent the findings<br />
of the Kelly Report.<br />
There were two critical omissions from this quotation. They<br />
have the effect of substantially modifying the meaning of<br />
that paragraph especially when placed in the context of the<br />
paragraph that preceded it. I now quote the paragraph as it<br />
was actually written in the Kelly Report, along with the preceding<br />
paragraph, " Starting a new system would give us the opportunity<br />
to turn over a new page. We know that the firmly held<br />
stances of the past will not be lightly abandoned but<br />
at least there is more chance of this happening in a<br />
new situation.<br />
There is one aspect of the meat industry which should be<br />
tackled with firm resolution when the new page is<br />
turned, and that is the problem of some managers trying<br />
to buy the co-operation of inspectors by giving them meat<br />
at ridiculously low prices, or countenancing excessive<br />
overtime claims, or of meat inspectors demanding cheap<br />
meat backed by the implied threat of slowing the killing<br />
chain or forcing higher offal or other condemnations if<br />
management is not compliant. AMIS legislation should<br />
include heavy punishments for administrators, VO's,<br />
meat inspectors and management who try to extract improper<br />
advantages out of the system in this manner. That this<br />
kind of practice has been too-common in the past we know<br />
too well. It must be stopped in the future."<br />
In the first place, the words " when the new age is turned" are<br />
omitted. It is worth noting [ hat tis-significant and particular<br />
omission occurred not only in the Royal Commissioner's Report<br />
but also in the primary evidence given by Mr Kelly ( Page 10249). </p>
<p>18<br />
Without the omitted words, the injunction from the Kelly Committee<br />
would have been that the Minister should move immediately to<br />
tackle certain problems with firm resolution. Now with those<br />
words, the injunction is consistent with the whole UihFuTst of everything<br />
Mr Kelly said in his own report and with much of what he said<br />
before the Royal Commission. That was that attention should<br />
first be given to creating a new system. Then and indeed as<br />
a part of the' new system, attention should be given to those<br />
instances of skullduggery, using Mr Kelly's word.<br />
Indeed there was some discussion in the Royal Commission about<br />
what these words meant. I refer you to page 10266 of the<br />
transcript.<br />
The other omission, which is in no way even indicated in the<br />
quotation in the Royal Commissioner's Report, is that the Kelly<br />
report said " AMIS legislation should include heavy punishments<br />
for administrators, VO's, meat inspectors and management who<br />
try to extract improper advantages out of the system in this<br />
manner." The fact that Mr Kelly said such Punishment should be included<br />
in AMIS legislation again shows plainly that the thrust of<br />
the injunction from the Kelly Committee was that the creation<br />
of a new system was the first priority. it happened that<br />
I think it is reasonable to ask how/ Mr Kelly, in his primary<br />
evidence, and how it happened that the Royal Commission report,<br />
omitted, in two placas, words of such stark and significant<br />
importance, especially when the reputation of a Minister was<br />
at stake. ./ 19 </p>
<p>19<br />
If all the omitted words had been included, they would have<br />
altered the balance of the evidence substantially in the<br />
Minister's favour. The fact that they were not included is<br />
a sad and unhappy omission, with a most unfortunate consequence.<br />
Mr Speaker, -there can be no doubting that the Royal Comrmissioner<br />
acted in good faith in drawing the conclusion that he did.<br />
But on the basis of the evidence that I have outlined, I cannot<br />
accept that the one adverse finding against the Minister has<br />
been substantiated. I unequivocally reject it.<br />
The object of the Royal Commission's criticism of the<br />
Minister was that Mr Kelly had said certain things in<br />
the meeting of 11 February, or that the Report itself said<br />
certain things, that were not adequately followed-up. That, as<br />
the Royal Commissioner said, was the only point of cricitism.<br />
I believe I have rebutted it adequately and effectively.<br />
In summary, Mr Speaker, the Report of the Royal Commission<br />
is a very positive and valuable document. The Very conduct<br />
of the Commission an~ d the response that it stimulated, has<br />
been of great benefit to the meat industry.<br />
Overwhelmingly, the Royal Commissioner's findings have been<br />
positive in character. Since the subtitution incident,<br />
the actions of the Minister and his Department have been<br />
found to be appropriate and by and large effective. The<br />
Department's recommendations for further improving the<br />
service have also been favourably commented upon. The<br />
Royal Commissioner has rightly emphasised that there is<br />
further room for improvement and he has suggested avenues<br />
for the pursuit of this improvement. These avenues will<br />
be followed up vigorously.<br />
We are of course, still left with the difficult and complex<br />
problem of dual inspection. That matter must be resolved.<br />
The Commissioner's comments will be drawn upon heavily in<br />
our efforts to resolve that matter with the States.<br />
We are indebted to the Royal Commissioner and his staff<br />
for their efforts. Let me stress again that I believe the<br />
Commission has been a very productive one, notwithstanding<br />
my reservations in relation to one finding.<br />
I turn now to a broader consideration of which meat<br />
substitution was one symptom.<br />
Mr Speaker, it makes me very angry indeed to see people<br />
who have been treated well-in this country, who are largely<br />
prosperous, and who are often in control of affluent<br />
businesses seeking for no other reason than greed to become<br />
even wealthier by means which are unethical and dishonest.<br />
Those people are undermining our whole system.<br />
In the case of those involved in meat substitution, they run<br />
the risk of destroying the livelihoods of many honourable<br />
people in the meat industry and in the farming and pastoral<br />
world, because these practices have the potential of destroying<br />
our markets. </p>
<p>20<br />
The Royal Commissioner has indicated that current penalties<br />
for those people are severe. Personally I would not mind<br />
if they were very much more severe. The people who have<br />
been involved in meat substitution have exhibited the same<br />
corrupt attitude towards society as those who have sought<br />
to evade paying their taxes. This Government ia determined<br />
to do everything It can to make these practices unprofitable<br />
for the participants. it would want to do whatever it can<br />
to eradicate these practices once and for all.<br />
In conclusion, Mr Speaker, there is one general point<br />
that I want to make.<br />
We all know quite well that in the last decade or so, there<br />
have been significant breakdowns and administrative failures<br />
in a number of areas of government administration. The<br />
Narcotics Bureau and the Federal Police have been reorganised<br />
and the recent issues concerning the Crown Solicitor's Office<br />
provide a further example.<br />
These are matters of the gravest concern to all Australians.<br />
There have obviously been considerable strains on the Public<br />
Service and I want to emphasise that I do not think the<br />
Public Service, with its traditional modes and manner of<br />
operation, can or should necessarily be blared for these failures.<br />
Overwhelmingly members of the Public Service do their<br />
jobs honourably and with a degree of dedication and commitment.<br />
That is not recognised as it should be in the broad community.<br />
But I also believe that in recent years the Public Service<br />
is having to face new and difficult challenges, and it needs<br />
to be equipped to meet the changes that have occurred.<br />
The business ethics of a minority have deteriorated and it<br />
is quite clear that unethical people who wish,. to cheat on<br />
their obligations to others have * left Ministers and the Public<br />
Service with a massive problem in'attempting to catch up with,<br />
and overtake, their unethical practices.<br />
They have at times, as we have found in this Report, found<br />
people who will assist them from within the Public Service,<br />
but I should emphasise that Public Servants like that are<br />
a small minority who will be ' condemned by the overall membership<br />
of the Public Service.<br />
But because there have been these breakdowns and because there<br />
would seem to be elements in the community able to manipulate<br />
the increasingly complex and diverse business world, some<br />
significant changes may well be needed within the Public Service<br />
to put it in a position of being ahead of rather than behind those<br />
who seek to despoil that system which is important to all of us.<br />
This is a very broad proposition, but it is a matter which is<br />
receiving my own urgent and vigorous attention and I will<br />
be saying something more about it shortly. </p>
