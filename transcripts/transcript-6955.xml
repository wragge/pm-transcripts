PRIME MINISTERA<br />
AGREEMENT ON TASMANIAN WOODCHIP L-ICENCES<br />
A Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU) between the Commonwealth<br />
and Tasmanian Governments about the conditions for expor--ts of<br />
woodchips was signed in Canberra today.<br />
The Memorandum was signed by the Feaeral minister for Primary<br />
Industry, Mr John Kerin, the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Robin Gray,<br />
and the State Minister for Forests, Mr Ray Groom.<br />
Mr Kerin said the industry could now proceed on a firm basis.<br />
" The community can be assured that the woodchip operations will<br />
be carried out in an environmentally responsible manner.<br />
The development of the Memorandum followed negotiation to<br />
ensure that the Commonwealth's demands, announced on 16<br />
December 1985, would be met.<br />
" Included in the Memorandum is an agreed buffer zone to protect<br />
the wilderness values of the South West National Park".<br />
Commenting on the Memorandum, the Prime Minister,' Mr Bob Hawke,<br />
stressed that in the event of disagreement with Tasmania where<br />
forestry operations would adversely affect National Estate<br />
values all the Commonwealth's powers would be used to protect<br />
those values.<br />
Mr Hawke emphasised decisions would be taken by the<br />
Commonwealth only when appropriate consideration had been given<br />
to environmental aspects.<br />
" As part of this process a Commonwealth consultative committee,<br />
which will include environmental experts, will be set Up," he<br />
said. " No logging in the National Estate areas will be permitted<br />
before the formal process of consultation, as set out in the<br />
Memorandum, has been completed and the Commonwealth is<br />
satisifed that the National Estate values will be protected.<br />
Other items covered by the Memorandum include the supply of<br />
information and the monitoring of woodchip operations,<br />
compliance with management prescriptions, introduction of<br />
improved forest practices, five yearly reviews of forest<br />
operations, requirements for regeneration of Crown and private<br />
land, provision of adequate reserves to protect rare and<br />
endangered species and implementation of a program of research<br />
into matters of environmental concern. 2/ </p>
<p>-2-<br />
" These are all matters that the Minister for Arts, Heritage and<br />
Environment, Mr Cohen, had recommended to me as a precondition<br />
for the renewal of Tasmanian export licences," Mr Kerin said.<br />
" I believe the Memorandum and the export licences provide a<br />
means of ensuring that the issues raised by Mr Cohen in his<br />
assessment of the environmental impact statement on Tasmanian<br />
woodchip operations, will be covered in a practical and<br />
effective manner.<br />
" As I said at the time of the decision, the Government's<br />
approach is to seek an appropriate balance between the<br />
interests of workers, industry and the environment.<br />
" The Memorandum enables industry and employment to be<br />
maintained, while the environment is protected and subject to<br />
continuing review", Mr Kerin said.<br />
" Now the document has been settled, I will be looking to<br />
quickly put in place the necessary supporting mechanisms<br />
including research arrangements and a consultative committee."<br />
