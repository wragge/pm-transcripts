<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, thanks for joining us.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Now, this is obviously a budget you're very proud of. I note</p>
<p> the Treasurer last night spoke of what could be a very special decade</p>
<p> ahead for Australia. But how much of that rosy vision depends on what</p>
<p> happens in the rest of the world, can we really prosper independently?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, we are influenced by what happens in the rest of the world but</p>
<p> as we've demonstrated with the Asian economic downturn, if we</p>
<p> do things well domestically we can dramatically reduce the impact</p>
<p> of bad events overseas. So whilst we can never say the rest of the</p>
<p> world doesn't matter, the extent to which the rest of the world</p>
<p> does matter depends crucially on how we run our own economy. And if</p>
<p> we keep our own economy running well, if we keep the will to reform</p>
<p> things like the taxation system and industrial relations, then we're</p>
<p> better placed, if things go wrong overseas, to keep out the bad developments</p>
<p> and the nasty tides.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Yes, you're suggesting that if you do run the economy well, so</p>
<p> well in fact, we could be debt free by 2003 and as a consequence of</p>
<p> that the Treasurer's even suggested we might have tax cuts. Could</p>
<p> you foreshadow the extent of those cuts...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. I think what the Treasurer is saying there is that if you get</p>
<p> rid of debt your capacity to do other things is greatly increased.</p>
<p> There are tax cuts promised by this Government, $13 billion of them,</p>
<p> 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers on a top marginal rate of 30 cents</p>
<p> in the dollar. And they are part of our tax reform plan and if only</p>
<p> the Senate will pass it Australians, from the 1st of July</p>
<p> next year, can have $13 billion of personal tax cuts and a top marginal</p>
<p> rate of 30 cents in the dollar for 80 per cent of taxpayers.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Now, Mr Howard, since the budget was delivered last night commentators</p>
<p> and other interest groups have had time to digest its contents and</p>
<p> the fine print. Youth allowance has emerged as an important issue.</p>
<p> Senator Harradine, you'll note, is very angry. He says he's</p>
<p> ashamed for supporting your bill last year because last night you</p>
<p> failed to adequately compensate families who lost the allowance. What's</p>
<p> your response to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, anything I'd say in response to that to Senator Harradine</p>
<p> I'd prefer to say to him personally. It's not been my habit</p>
<p> to conduct a dialogue with him or, indeed, anybody else over a television</p>
<p> programme.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Well, what about the figures themselves, Mr Howard, $18.75 a week</p>
<p> is a long way short of $153?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if I could just finish. We haven't broken any promises.</p>
<p> We've kept faith with all of our promises to everybody. But,</p>
<p> again, this is in an area where, frankly, I'll prefer to talk</p>
<p> directly to the Senator.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Well, apart from your dialogue with the Senator, what about addressing</p>
<p> the figures Â the $18 a week that you put on the table last night</p>
<p> in a year from now is a long way short of what you took away, anywhere</p>
<p> from $88 to $133?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I'm not going to get into a debate on that because it is</p>
<p> germane to the observation made by the Senator and I'm simply</p>
<p> not going to engage in a dialogue on it. I've said that and I've</p>
<p> made that very clear and I don't intend to depart from that approach.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Just finally on jobs, Mr Howard. Treasury's predicting unemployment</p>
<p> will stay at 7.5 per cent despite another year of growth, what will</p>
<p> it take to move it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it will take two things. It will take continued strong economic</p>
<p> growth, which we've got a real prospect of enjoying. It will</p>
<p> also take further reforms to the labour market, the Senate passing</p>
<p> our unfair dismissal law, the Senate passing our law to entrench youth</p>
<p> wages and the Senate embracing the further reforms to the labour market</p>
<p> which the Government will be putting forward. The onus is now very</p>
<p> much on the Labor Party and the Democrats in the Senate. We can make</p>
<p> further inroads into unemployment but only if we attack it on two</p>
<p> fronts Â reform to the labour market as well as strong economic</p>
<p> growth. We've delivered the strong economic growth. We have put</p>
<p> up the reforms to the labour market. We now need them to be changed</p>
<p> to be passed through the Senate.</p>
<p>CAMERON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thank you for joining us this morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
