E. -PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCEr BRISBANE, 26 JUNE 1985<br />
PH: Just before we are open for questions, ~ I thought I<br />
might help you today by an opening statement. I have had<br />
the opportunity of meeting with my colleagues of the<br />
Queensland State Parliament and in that meeting I indicated<br />
. to them that.. we had been-drawing-. atentlaon-. in.Ã± he -Federal<br />
Parliament and would continue to be doing so to the grosg<br />
economic incompetence of the Premier of Queensland and of<br />
his Government. As I pointed out to them, the evidence is<br />
overwhelming and it goes a considerable way, I believe, to<br />
explaining the pathetic diversionary attempts that the<br />
Premier is increasingly engaging in. But those attempts<br />
to attack the trade unions or to attack Canberra or to<br />
attack journalists for non-existent interviews that he<br />
didn't give and some phantom Premier gave, those things are<br />
not going to divert attention from the facts. And the<br />
facts are overwhelming that Queensland is the worst<br />
managed economy of all the State economies ang has the worst<br />
results and that the very fine people of Queensland are now<br />
increasingly paying a very heavy price for the incompahtence<br />
of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen and his Government. Just let me<br />
go to some of the relevant statistics. Employment, of course,<br />
is a very important area. They have the worst. unemployment<br />
rate here of any State in Australia 9.9% against the<br />
national average of 8.4. Now that is a very significant<br />
difference. Where employment is rising in the rest of<br />
Australia, here in Queensland employment has actually fallen.<br />
If you look at inflation it has one of the worst ratos in<br />
Australia. Over the last year the Australian average 4.4.<br />
increase. Queensland If you look at the registrations<br />
of new motor vehicles -always taken as a significant<br />
indicator of what is happening in the level of econoydic<br />
performance the health of an economy over the past year<br />
the Australian growth in the registration of new motor vehicles<br />
18.3% 7 Queensland lO. t. The building industry again a<br />
very significant-indicator of what is happening in the economy.<br />
As far as Australia is concerned there have been significant<br />
increases, but here, measured in the last quarter, the March<br />
quarter, whereas for Australia as a whole in regard to the<br />
number of dwellings approved in Australia -0.9t increase.<br />
Almost a 20% decline in Queenslanxd 19.8t decline. </p>
<p>So it doesn't matter what you look at employment,<br />
unemployment, prices, registrations of newainotor vehicles,<br />
dwelling industry Australia is doing very well. Queensland<br />
is doing worst of the States generally speaking and certainly<br />
much worse than the Australian average. As I say, these are<br />
the reasons why this Premier and this Government seek to<br />
divert attention from their own incompetence.<br />
The second thing briefly that I would like to go to is to<br />
share with you my amusement at the latest offering of this<br />
poor: Federal Leader of the Opposition whose contribution to<br />
the tax debate has been to this stage so irrelevant and<br />
pathetic. His latest contribution is to say that Mr H~ awke<br />
did not get a mandate from the Australian people for option<br />
C. Well what a magnificent irrelevancy because I never claimed<br />
that we and the Government got a mandate from-the Australian<br />
people for Option C. What I have been saying is that we got<br />
a clear unequivocal mandate from the Australian people to<br />
undertake the task of tax reform. And it would be much<br />
better if the Leader of the Opposition could get his own act<br />
together and make some comments which are relevant to the great<br />
debate which is properly taking place in Australia today.<br />
Over to you. I<br />
JOURNALIST: Given what you have said then, Prime Minister,<br />
and the level of concern expressed at today's meeting about<br />
Sir Joh's tacking, is it now fair to suggest that the ALP<br />
has pinpointed the Queensland Premier as its biggest political<br />
foe. Given that you often claim that Mr Peacock is<br />
politically'irrelevant. PM: Oh I don't regard him as my biggest political foe, but<br />
as far as Queensland is concerned, he has become a danger.<br />
Not to the ALP, he has become a danger to the people of<br />
Queensland. I mean, I think it is evident from the amount of<br />
time I spent over the years coming to Queensland, not only to<br />
Brisbane but particularly to the north of Queensland, that I<br />
have a very soft spot for Queensland and its people. And I<br />
think it is becoming an increasing tragedy that Sir Joh is<br />
becoming the enemy of Queensland. There is no reason,<br />
looking at the resources of this State, and comparing them<br />
with the resources of the other States, as to why their<br />
economic performance should be so bad. Queensland is blessed<br />
with resource endowments ' at-least as good as those of the<br />
other States of Ai1dtralia better than most. Why is it<br />
therefore that you have such an abysmally bad economic<br />
performance compared with the rest of Australia. Nowi he can't<br />
have it both ways. Hie can't say that the quality of economic<br />
management has got something to do with the parties in power<br />
and then have the evidence showing. within your own State you<br />
are doing worse than everyone else in all the major indicatoro. </p>
<p>There is only one conclusion that can be drawn. And that is<br />
that the very fine people of Queensland are paying a very<br />
heavy price for the Government and the Premiership of Sir Joh<br />
Ejelke-Petersen. So, he's not my foe. He is increasingly<br />
becoming a very heavy price that the-people of Queensland are<br />
paying. JOURNALIMT Yesterday the Premier indicated that when the<br />
Tax Sumimit took place next week he would be taking a proposal<br />
to a single rate of tax. Have you a response to that?<br />
PM: Well yes. It is not surprising that he will because he<br />
has been talking that sort of nonsense for a very long<br />
period of time. And it is consistent with the position of<br />
the sort of people that he represents because it would be<br />
massively inequitable. It would impose a relatively very very<br />
much greater burden on the poorer people of the conmmunity and<br />
represent.. a very distinct advantage to the more privileged in<br />
the community. So it is no surprise that that would be the<br />
extent of his contribution.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, were you able to offer any advice to<br />
the Queensland Labor Party about their failure to. get into<br />
government over the past few<br />
PM: Well, I don't put it in those terms, but I did say that<br />
I believed that there should be a concentration upon the<br />
exposure of the sorts of things that I have been talking about.<br />
After all, what people are concerned about in politics is<br />
basic economic performance. You can talk about all the other<br />
things, but in the end, people are concerned about jobs, about<br />
prices, about housing and about their capacity to improve their<br />
standard of living. And of course registration of new motor<br />
vehicles is an-indication of that sort of thing. Now,, what<br />
I am saying to them is what they should concentrate on is<br />
those issues. And once the people of Queensland come<br />
understand that they are being, and have been taken for an<br />
enormous ride by this Government and this Premier, they~ will<br />
start to draw the right political conclusions. I repreat, there.<br />
is no reason why the people of Queensland should be getting<br />
such a rough deal compared with what is happening to the people<br />
of the other States of this country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Back on the tax* will you let Mr Ejelke-Petersen<br />
put his views on single rate tax at the Summit?<br />
pM: of course I Vill. And I will even allow him his knighthood-<br />
Sir Joh. I will not only allow him to put his views, I will<br />
welcome the putting of his views. I am glad he is coming.<br />
At least you can say. that much in his favour'compared with the<br />
Federal opposition. He is coming.<br />
JOURNALIST: Yesterday the ACTU Secretary, Mr Keltyo indica,;,-ithat<br />
the union movement wouldn't be stampeded into an early<br />
d'ecision on the consumption tax issue. He says there might be<br />
a special unions conference called as late as September. I<br />
aWnido~ ring. given the importance of the ACTI decision to<br />
Government plans, whether thoc Government xs prepuxiud wcilt<br />
unti]. September to make a decision, and if it isn't, is it<br />
prepared to make a decision before the ACTU finalises its own<br />
nosition. </p>
<p>4.<br />
PM4: Very fair question. I noticed the report in one of<br />
the papers today that Mr Kelty had mnade the observation<br />
that the members of the trade union movement and their<br />
dependents would have to live with the tax decision for very<br />
many years to come. And that therefore they won't going to<br />
be stampeded. That seems-. to me to be a perfectly reasonableobservation<br />
for Ur Kelty to make on behalf of the trade union<br />
movement. obviously, we have a responsibility to come to<br />
our decision as quickly as possible so that we can move to<br />
get the appropriate legislation into the Parliament and<br />
carried and the work done to make the changes which we regard<br />
as appropriate. We are not going to be demanding an<br />
immediate response from the ACTU, but I don't know that there<br />
are any questions about waiting until September. I think<br />
that may be too long. But obviously it is appropriate that<br />
the trade union movement representing so many millions of<br />
Australians does have the opportunity properly to consider<br />
this matter. I don't think it should take until September.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, President Reagan has called for a<br />
world-wide reaction campaign against terrorism. Given that<br />
one group has targetted Australia as a possible target, have<br />
you directed your mind to this subject yet, as to what part<br />
Australia will play?<br />
PM4: Yes, I have. I understand that Vice President Bush<br />
is visiting some countries to discuss these matters with<br />
them. He won't be coming here and I think that that's probably<br />
a reflection of the fact that the United States Adminstration<br />
makes the judgement that we are probably better placed than<br />
most in regard to the arrangements that we have for security.<br />
And. I think that's a judgemnent that is well placed. However,<br />
Secretary of State Shultz will be coming here in July and I<br />
will be talking about these matters with him then. It is<br />
appropriate that President Reagan should be expressing concern<br />
about these issues. I think the world is increasingly coming<br />
to the conclusion that we cannot tolerate the increasing use<br />
of this tactic of terror as an instrument to try and achieve<br />
desired political results. ITis has got an increased poignancy,<br />
if you like, for Australia because of the tragedy of the death<br />
of those two children in the Frankfurt tragedy and attrocity.<br />
And so, I say this on behalf of the Government and I am sure<br />
the people of Australia, that we will be totally co-operative<br />
in any approach which seeks to eliminate from the affairs of<br />
men . and women in this world the use of this tactic of terror<br />
which is so indiscriminate in its impact. It is Of itself<br />
intrinsically obje~ ztionable and it becomes more objectionable<br />
when you see innocent children paying a price for the mindless<br />
stupidities and bastardry of terror groups.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the White House is talking about<br />
economic sanctions against Lebanon. How do you feel about that? </p>
<p>PM: Not of economic sanctions against Lebanon. I mean,<br />
I would want to obviously look at any proposals that were<br />
put. I don't dismiss proposals just out of hand without<br />
seeing them, but let me say this, that when you are talking<br />
about Lebanon you are talking about a country which in many<br />
respects can be regarded as the most tragic in the world<br />
because you have there the two sets of considerations. You<br />
have the interconfessional rivalries which have a degree of<br />
bitterness which is almost incomprehensible. And in<br />
addition to that you have the fact that external forces are<br />
using Lebanon as . a-.. ground for the playing out of their own<br />
intense and bitter rivalries. And the upshot of those two<br />
considerations is that the people of Lebanon, particularly<br />
the women and children of Lebanon, are paying a massively<br />
disturbing price for those things. And one couldn't easily<br />
contemplate sanctions which would add.. to the burden of those<br />
women and children of Lebanon.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke you indicated yesterday that you<br />
expected the Summit to discuss the distribution of the tax cuts<br />
through the incomes scales.<br />
PM: Yes I would think that would be one thing they want to<br />
talk about.<br />
JOURNALIST: How much flexibility is there there though<br />
and you also said yesterday that you believed that the<br />
distribution proposed by the Government was the highly<br />
desirable one. Could you elaborate on why you think<br />
( inaudible).<br />
PM.* Let me say this, you say how desirable is it. I mean<br />
you can't put a measure on these things, but it is clearly<br />
appropriate that that be talked about because after all if<br />
you are talking about tax reform, in the end you are talking<br />
about how people at different levels are going to benefit<br />
from whatever package is adopted. And that to a considerable<br />
extent, almost overwhelmingly, be reflected in what happens to<br />
the changes in the tax scales. So inevitably for that reason<br />
there would be a considerable amiount of discussion about that.<br />
As to the second part of your question, how much room is there<br />
for change. Well, we have come to that prima facie position<br />
and the preferred option that that seems to be the way to do it.<br />
As we have in regard to A and B . said, well those seem to<br />
be appropriate ways of changing the tax scales if the amount<br />
of revenue available is what it is at Option A which is 1.8,<br />
3.3 million at dption B and about 6.7 at Option C. With<br />
that level of revenue available that change in the tax scale<br />
seems the most appropriate. But we will listen closely to what<br />
is said and if we could be persuaded that somte other sort of<br />
change in the tax scales was on the balance of consideration<br />
better, well we will take that into account. As to that part<br />
of your question which says how much room is there for change,<br />
I think it should be remembered that the change in thc tax<br />
benef its which occurred in the tax cuts last year were very<br />
significantly skewed towards the bottom levels. And so that's<br />
not ~ Rnyn-hini; that you can continue to do indefinitely. But<br />
having said that, I will listen carefully to whatever argume~ nts<br />
are put forward for some different sort of distribution ofC<br />
b enef its.-</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, still on tax how significantly<br />
have the mobilisation of farmers in recent days in rallies<br />
that were claiming tax been in convincing you that they<br />
have a genuine case for some economic relief.<br />
PM: As I said to the rural representatives who met me yesterday,<br />
the rallies haven't changed my thinking at all. I have<br />
welcomed the rallies, however. As I said to the representatives<br />
yesterday, over some months now I have spent very very many<br />
hours with the representatives of the rural community through<br />
the National Farmers' Federation and then again yesterday at<br />
a regional level. And itathat sort of putting of submissions<br />
and arguments which I find impressive. And I am not being<br />
my thinking is not being formed by the rallies but nevertheless<br />
I welcome them. And I welcome them for these reasons.-that<br />
this is a democratic society within which different groups<br />
historically have regarded the form of rallies as a legitimate<br />
way of bringing to the community's attention the concerns of<br />
those involved in the rally. And there is absolutely no reason<br />
why the farmers shouldn't themselves use this perfectly<br />
appropriate mechanism within our democratic society. And the<br />
second point is that on the evidence so far the farmers have<br />
been very responsible in the way they have conducted themselves.<br />
They have now had these rallies in Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne.<br />
And all the evidence suggests that they have conducted<br />
themselves sensibly and responsibly and have tried peacably to<br />
bring to the attention of the community and governments their<br />
concerns. And that is to be welcomed. If thats all they were<br />
doing it would be rather futile but as I say, they are backing<br />
up that sort of form of activity with very detailed submissions<br />
being put to Government. And I respect them for that. And,<br />
as I have said, I believe that they have got some legitimate<br />
concern in the area of farm costs. Let me use this forum to<br />
repeat what I have said elsewhere. The economics of farming<br />
are very straightforward in terms of the outcome for them<br />
that counts what is their net income position. It is an<br />
interaction of what happens to their prices and what happens<br />
to their costs. And what concerns the farmers of Australia<br />
and what concerns me is that they are amongst the most<br />
efficient producers in the world and yet their price level<br />
their products are going into an international pricing<br />
mechanism w,, hich has been increasingly distorted by the operations<br />
of the Europeans. So that the fact that they are amongst the<br />
world's most efficient producers is not being reflected in their<br />
capacity to obtain markets and-reasonable prices. And it is<br />
inevitable in that situation when their prices are being<br />
distorted in that way and they are being discriminated against<br />
that they will be concerned even more on Lhe sight of what<br />
happens to their cost inputs. And they have, as I say,<br />
legitimate cause for concern and that's why the Government will<br />
be paying serious 4ttention to what they are saying in that area. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: low against the American dollar and there<br />
is no sign do you think its fairly inevitable that the<br />
unions will have to accept discounted wages national wage<br />
case. PM: Well, what I've said is that I believe on the evidence so<br />
far that's most appropriate in regard to the September hearing<br />
that the normal processes go ahead. Once that is done then<br />
the Government and the trade unions and the business community<br />
are going to have to do a lot of serious talking about what<br />
happens in the control of the economy generally, because as far<br />
as the Government is concerned we are not going to dissipate<br />
the great benefits of growth that have occurred since we came<br />
to office. We now are going into our third year of growth in<br />
non farm GDP of over We are not going to dissipate that<br />
by movements in the area of wages and salaries which could have<br />
counter-productive results. And I believe that in discussions<br />
with the trade union movement and with the business community<br />
both outside and within the Commission we will be able to<br />
achieve a result which will be in the best interests of this<br />
country. And I believe that the trade unions will be<br />
responsive tc what we've got to say. And the final point I make<br />
is this that if the comununity is going to be making judgements<br />
in this area about what's best for the conununity, they have got<br />
to contrast the capacity that this Government has within a<br />
centralised wage fixing system to get some appropriate<br />
relationship between wage movements and other economic<br />
variables as compared with the chaos that would exist if the<br />
Opposition had its way. And that is that they would abolish<br />
the centralised wage fixing and leave the level of wage<br />
movements to the free play of market forces. That is an<br />
undiluted recipe for chaos. And we, having established<br />
appropriate mechanisms will see tJhat those mechanisms are used<br />
in a way which benefits the Australian community.<br />
JOURNALIST: A number of State Labor politicians have expressed<br />
concern that they could suffer electorally if the Federal<br />
Goverruent decides to introduce its consunption tax at the same<br />
time as the State election next year. Was this discussed today<br />
and is this a legitimate claim.<br />
PM-The point was raised about the timing of any introduction<br />
of any changes, ycs. The basic point is this. The<br />
Australian community, of which I have always regarded Queensland<br />
as a part, has suffered grievously from the existing system.<br />
And they will continue to suffer more if this existing system<br />
is not. ch-anged. And that is thie case simply because those<br />
who pay taxes ordinary wage and salary earners will have a<br />
greaLer burden imposed upon them. There will be more and more<br />
of them who will go into the 46 cents bracket and more if<br />
changes are not made. So therefore it should be regarded as a<br />
plus not only in Queensland but anywhere else for a Party which<br />
is bringing in a reform of the tax system which is going to make<br />
the bulk of the taxpayers better off. And I believe the<br />
situation will be that . in the post Summit situation wbn my<br />
Government considers all tat is said at, the urnmit at thef<br />
Summ: it and befor-e and makes its, dec: is ion will be makinq<br />
a dIeCi; ion whicih unque.; tioriab. y wi. i] improve the lot of the<br />
over-whelminq majority of Australians taxpayers and t. hose<br />
dependent uponi them. </p>
<p>And that will be a context in which the Party here in Qu ensland<br />
associated with the bringing in of those changes, will benefit.<br />
I repeat here what I said in Rockham~ pton yesterday. I amn<br />
certain that in the period ahead this tax issue and what is<br />
done about it Will be a political plus for Labor and a<br />
devastating minus~ for the conservatiLve coalition whose<br />
responsibility the existing tax syStem'is. Blecause the first<br />
question that has to be asked in this whole issue is this.<br />
Why are we having tax reform now. Why is tax reform necessary<br />
now. And the answer to that question is, the Australian<br />
society has to have tax reform now because the conservative<br />
coalition for thirty of the last thirty-five years has been<br />
in power. The existing tax system is their-system. They are<br />
responsible for the inequity, the unfairness, the economi-c<br />
inefficiency and the lack of simplicity. And the Party,. that<br />
is the Labor Party, which will be getting rid of the inequities<br />
and unfairnesses and producing economic efficiency will be the<br />
Party which gets the benefit of thie political1 judgemnents of<br />
the Australian people.<br />
JOURNALIST: Between the time of the Summuit, the time the<br />
Government makes ' its decision and the time the decision<br />
starts to take effect, are we likely to see any sort of large<br />
scale public relations campaign launched by the Government<br />
through television and the newspapers to try and explain these<br />
things in more detail.<br />
PM4: Yes indeed you will. it will b<br />
but the responsibility of the Govern<br />
are taken as to changes in the tax s<br />
Australian people about those change<br />
exercise that right but discharge th e, not only the right<br />
ment when the decisions<br />
ystem, to inform the<br />
a. We will not only<br />
at responsibility. T 1) -r R 14 7 i_ </p>
