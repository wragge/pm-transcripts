    <content><![CDATA[<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Good afternoon.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good afternoon, Mike.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>I'm not sure I should question you today. There's an</p>
<p>   opinion poll that says we no longer trust you, you're no longer</p>
<p>   Â‘Honest John'.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we'll find out about that at the next election, won't</p>
<p>   we?</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Mmm, we might.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Does it worry you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>People don't trust you any more.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I checked when I got home the other night and they still</p>
<p>   let me in.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Your family likes you...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. (laughs)</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Could it be that this business of the Resources Minister, Senator</p>
<p>   Parer, has undermined people's trust in you? You've changed</p>
<p>   the rules of your Code of Conduct, haven't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I look to the substance of what he's done and he hasn't</p>
<p>   done anything wrong. He's not been involved in any conflict</p>
<p>   of interest. What the Labor Party is really saying is, that in order</p>
<p>   to remain Resources Minister he's got to throw away something</p>
<p>   that provides an income stream to his seven children. And it's</p>
<p>   unreasonable to ask any person to do that.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>But that's what your Code of Conduct demands...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if you look at the Code of Conduct in its totality, one element</p>
<p>   of the code allows you to retain interest in a family company -</p>
<p>   this is a family trust - another says you can't have any direct</p>
<p>   shareholding or the like interests.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>It doesn't say direct shareholdings, it says all shares...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes well, of course, he doesn't own a share. He doesn't</p>
<p>   own shares in a resource company, he doesn't. What the situation</p>
<p>   is, that his family trust owns a collection of investments and he</p>
<p>   has an interest in the family trust.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Yeah, but I suggest to many Australians, that's a pretty dodgy,</p>
<p>   round-about way.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't think it's dodgy at all. Something is only</p>
<p>   dodgy when you're dishonest or you cheat. And he's neither</p>
<p>   dishonest nor has he cheated and there has been no conflict of interest.</p>
<p>   Nobody, nobody, despite all the noise over the last few weeks -</p>
<p>   few days, rather - has been able to point to any example where Warwick</p>
<p>   Parer has used his ministerial position to enrich himself, where</p>
<p>   Warwick Parer has made a decision specifically designed to advantage</p>
<p>   the company in which his trust, his family trust hold shares - nobody.</p>
<p>   And until they can do that then I'm going to stand by him because</p>
<p>   I don't believe that he's doing anything wrong.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>No. And he hasn't made a buck out of it, sure enough, but</p>
<p>   the Labor Party...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think it's very important because Gareth Evans and</p>
<p>   others are running around saying he's been dishonest. He hasn't</p>
<p>   been. I mean, what effectively they are saying is that a farmer</p>
<p>   can never be the Minister for Primary Industry and a person who</p>
<p>   has any involvement in a resource company can never be the Minister</p>
<p>   for Resources. The reason I made him the Minister for Resources</p>
<p>   is that he knows more about the resource sector than any other person</p>
<p>   in Parliament. What am I to do - run away from people who've</p>
<p>   got business experience? Do we really want a Parliament made up</p>
<p>   of former trade union officials and political staffers? Because</p>
<p>   that is the way we are heading because we are denigrating people</p>
<p>   of assets and we are denigrating people who've had business</p>
<p>   experience. I'm not going to allow that to happen.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Yeah, but the trouble is you set the bar too high in the first</p>
<p>   place, didn't you? Ministers are required to divest themselves</p>
<p>   of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved</p>
<p>   in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. It's black</p>
<p>   and white, you know.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the company in which he holds the interest is an investment</p>
<p>   company, is a trust and that, in turn, holds shares in a whole variety</p>
<p>   of organisations including one that has coal mining interests. Now...</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>But is this a similar offence to one that cost other Ministers</p>
<p>   their job, Jim Short...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it's not. Well, the difference is that there's no</p>
<p>   evidence at all and Senator Parer's assured me that at no stage</p>
<p>   has he involved himself in the affairs of this coal interest while</p>
<p>   he's been a Minister. And he hasn't been ringing people</p>
<p>   up on behalf of the interest. He hasn't been specifically promoting</p>
<p>   the interest.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>But he was chatting to these Japanese partners of the coal mine</p>
<p>   just the other day.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean, if you've had an association with somebody for 10</p>
<p>   or 20 years, you don't ignore them if you come across them.</p>
<p>   I mean, I'm chatting to people always when I'm in the</p>
<p>   middle of taking decisions that might affect their interests. But</p>
<p>   the fact that I speak to them - I mean, I take a decision - we took</p>
<p>   a decision a few weeks ago on an issue involving communications,</p>
<p>   does that mean to say I can never talk to the Chairman of the ABC,</p>
<p>   that I can never talk to Kerry Packer or to Rupert Murdoch or to</p>
<p>   the management of Fairfax...</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>But you haven't got shares...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean, I don't have any shares but I do have a capacity to</p>
<p>   influence the outcomes.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>True. All right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And I just think this idea - I mean, all this who ha about him</p>
<p>   having talked to somebody, well, as far as I'm concerned, he</p>
<p>   should not apologise ever for retaining contact with people with</p>
<p>   whom he's had a past social association. </p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>So Senator Parer will stay.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Senator Parer has not been involved in any conflict of interest</p>
<p>   and therefore I will stick by him and I will support him and he</p>
<p>   will stay.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Okay. Moving along. Your decision to sell off the rest of Telstra,</p>
<p>   if that's blocked in the Senate - and it's quite an intricate</p>
<p>   manoeuvre for various reasons, isn't it - but if that's</p>
<p>   blocked in the Senate, will you go to an election on it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It will be our policy at the next election whether in the form</p>
<p>   of one of the bills on which we obtain a double dissolution or simply</p>
<p>   as a commitment to do it after the election. But whatever the circumstances</p>
<p>   we will be going to the next election with a policy that will allow</p>
<p>   the men and women of Australia to buy the remaining two-thirds of</p>
<p>   Telstra, yes.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>But if the Senate blocks - in the next couple of months, and for</p>
<p>   whatever reason you can't get it up in the Senate or perhaps</p>
<p>   it fails in the Senate, will you then go to the Governor-General</p>
<p>   and say: this is our policy, we want an election on these grounds...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not going to tell you precisely when I'm going</p>
<p>   to the Governor-General but I can assure you, Mike, at the next</p>
<p>   election one of the policies will be, if the Bill has been passed</p>
<p>   by the Senate then we'll be promising to implement the legislation,</p>
<p>   if it hasn't been, the promise will be to present it to the</p>
<p>   new Parliament. So either way...</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>But it could be a double dissolution trigger.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it could be, it could be, yes. If there's a double dissolution</p>
<p>   it could be. It will depend on how speedily the Senate deals with</p>
<p>   it. If the Senate wants to mess around and delay and obstruct and</p>
<p>   obfuscate, well I suppose they can do that for a few weeks or even</p>
<p>   a few months. But I don't think the Australian public appreciates</p>
<p>   that. If the Australian public doesn't like our policy, well,</p>
<p>   they can vote against it. And that applies with a whole lot of things.</p>
<p>   And I think what I'm saying to the Australian people now is</p>
<p>   that there are clear differences emerging between us and Labor.</p>
<p>   We're prepared to be innovative and active in the policy area.</p>
<p>   We're prepared to take decisions to project into the next century.</p>
<p>   I want Australia to be the greatest share-owning democracy in the</p>
<p>   world in the next century. And I also want to bequeath to the children</p>
<p>   and grandchildren of the next century a debt free Australia. And</p>
<p>   you can achieve both of those goals with the policy that I'm</p>
<p>   offering.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>What's the social bonus? You've talked about that a lot.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we haven't decided yet. I have a few innovative, positive</p>
<p>   ideas and I'm taking some advice and we'll be announcing</p>
<p>   that down the track.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Tax cuts?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, tax cuts are things that go on from year to year. They're</p>
<p>   not one-off.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Tax rises occasionally go on...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Tax rises occasionally go on from year to year.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there haven't been any under us.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There were under Mr Keating, remember? L-A-W and remember the campaign</p>
<p>   against indirect tax.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And he put them all up in heroic proportions in the Â‘93 budget.</p>
<p>   But coming back to the present, the social bonus will be a capital</p>
<p>   contribution to something that is important to the social infrastructure</p>
<p>   of Australia - social and physical infrastructure of Australia.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>You must have ideas to be tossed around?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Well give us a hint.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I think I will save that for another one of your programs.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>That is very kind of you. I'd like to talk about the Premiers'</p>
<p>   Conference...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>...and health, coming up in just a minute but can I just get to</p>
<p>   this, I don't know if you are aware of this but the 24 hour</p>
<p>   strike on the Sydney waterfront, next Tuesday, has now expanded</p>
<p>   to an eight day strike, what's your comment on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, two things, despite your rather humorous introduction, I</p>
<p>   should tell you that in 1997 the number of industrial disputes,</p>
<p>   and this is under my Government's new legislation, fell to</p>
<p>   an 85 year low. Can I say that again, in 1997 under the Howard Government's</p>
<p>   new industrial laws the number of industrial disputes were lower</p>
<p>   than they have been for 85 years.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>They might be on the way up again?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I mean sometimes a dispute or a stoppage gets a lot of publicity</p>
<p>   but it doesn't have a huge impact. Now that is the first comment</p>
<p>   I make. The second comment I make is that the law prevents a company</p>
<p>   paying people who are improperly placing a ban on overtime and that</p>
<p>   is what the MUA has done. And what Patricks are doing is to act</p>
<p>   in accordance with the law. The law says that if you pay those people</p>
<p>   with that ban then we, the legal authorities, the Government, will</p>
<p>   fine the company a large amount. I think it is $10,000 a day, but</p>
<p>   anyway it is a very significant penalty. So it is illegal now, under</p>
<p>   of the law of this country, if people are engaged in an improper</p>
<p>   strike and they put a prohibition on a particular activity - and</p>
<p>   that's improper and not agreed to - then it is unlawful for</p>
<p>   them to be paid by their employer during the currency of that prohibition.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>So, is it just that though, or is it a spin-off of the NFF dispute,</p>
<p>   the Webb Dock...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...Obviously it is a projection of that but I totally defend and</p>
<p>   support, indeed I applaud, what the National Farmers' Federation</p>
<p>   is doing. I mean, for years we have wanted a new law which allows</p>
<p>   the monopoly of the wharfies to be broken. We are not trying to</p>
<p>   drive the unionists off the waterfront. </p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>You wouldn't mind if they did though, would you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is not our goal. Our goal is a more productive waterfront</p>
<p>   which will produce more jobs and more investments and the way you</p>
<p>   get that is to have competition and that's where the NFF comes</p>
<p>   in. And you also get it by having non-union labour and if the MUA,</p>
<p>   years ago, had agreed to a higher level of productivity on the waterfront,</p>
<p>   this dispute would not now be occurring.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Chris Corrigan is saying, this afternoon, this eight day strike</p>
<p>   is thuggery that it is trying to send Patricks broke.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, of course it is. There is no doubt about that. There is no</p>
<p>   doubt in the world that the MUA is determined to stop the productivity</p>
<p>   increases on the waterfront and they're determined to stop</p>
<p>   non-union labour that they've made no bones about that and</p>
<p>   they are determined to stop Patricks and they are determined to</p>
<p>   stop the National Farmers' Federation.</p>
<p>I mean, at the moment we have a crane rate to containers of 18</p>
<p>   a day, the average of our Asian competitors is 30. It is not that</p>
<p>   we are incapable of doing it, it is not that we don't have</p>
<p>   the resources and the equipment to do it because on occasions, when</p>
<p>   the mood has struck them the MUA has been able to achieve much higher</p>
<p>   crane rates than that of our average [inaudible] in Asia.</p>
<p>So, it is just a result of their whole attitude and all we're</p>
<p>   asking for is that we have a more productive waterfront because</p>
<p>   that means more jobs and more investments and greater exports and</p>
<p>   a stronger Australian economy. And the only way you can do it is</p>
<p>   the way we have done it. We've changed the law. We've</p>
<p>   now got the NFF behaving very courageously with the total support</p>
<p>   of the Government.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>There is a Premiers' Conference tomorrow, or whatever they</p>
<p>   are called these days.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well this is a Premiers' Conference. There is another Conference</p>
<p>   of Premiers..</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Which is called?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A meeting of the Council of Australian Governments, but this is</p>
<p>   a Premiers Conference.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>It's wonderful hair-splitting, isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is indeed.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>Health looks like being the big issue, I think you would acknowledge</p>
<p>   that, and the states are asking you for, I think, an extra $5.5</p>
<p>   billion for their public hospital systems. You're standing</p>
<p>   firm saying they can't have any more and it seems, at the moment,</p>
<p>   that never the twain shall meet. Will it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Mike, they are already getting more under our offer. We are</p>
<p>   offering them, over the next five year period, we are offering them</p>
<p>   a three per cent real increase, that's three per cent over</p>
<p>   and above the current rate of inflation. On top of that we are promising</p>
<p>   that if during that period there is a one per cent fall in the number</p>
<p>   of people in private health insurance we will pay them an additional</p>
<p>   $83 million for every one per cent fall in the number of people</p>
<p>   in private health insurance. And that is over and above the increased</p>
<p>   offer.</p>
<p>CARLTON:</p>
<p>The Queensland Premier, Rob Borbidge, said the offer is a dud,</p>
<p>   a son of dud was his quote. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know the exact context of that but that sort of</p>
<p>   comment and observation is not helpful. I really think that the</p>
<p>   Australian public expects an approach which deals in facts and maturely</p>
<p>   addresses the issue.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But you're going to get that sort of comment and that sort</p>
<p>   of angst from all the Health Ministers, Liberal, Labor...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have been to Premiers' Conferences for years. I was there</p>
<p>   as the Federal Treasurer, I know the sort of public posturing that</p>
<p>   goes on from states beforehand. I just want to deal in the facts</p>
<p>   and the facts are that we have made a very generous health offer</p>
<p>   to the states. It's overall three per cent real increase. On</p>
<p>   top of that we're giving them guarantees against further falls</p>
<p>   in the number of people in private health insurance and we're</p>
<p>   also giving them guarantees in relation to abnormal increases in</p>
<p>   hospital costs.</p>
<p>So it's a very generous offer.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can it equally be said that you and your Federal Minister are posturing</p>
<p>   as well. This is the other side of the state-federal coin, you know.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I haven't sort of used flippant language. I'm just dealing</p>
<p>   with facts. I mean, it is not posturing to explain the basis of</p>
<p>   our position. It's not posturing to say that over the life</p>
<p>   of the last five year agreement, the Commonwealth will have spent</p>
<p>   $3.25 billion more on hospitals than it would have spent if it had</p>
<p>   maintained the previous agreement while the states have spent only</p>
<p>   $355 million more. Given that they are a state responsibility, and</p>
<p>   every night I see on Sydney television the Health Minister, whenever</p>
<p>   Mr Refshaughe, whenever anything goes wrong, no matter what it is</p>
<p>   and no matter how remote it is from Canberra, he sort of does a</p>
<p>   300 kilometre flick pass and says it's Canberra's responsibility.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yes but certainly the Victorian Health Minister, the NT Health Minister,</p>
<p>   the WA Health Minister, none of them are...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is part of the ritual for states to say the Commonwealth is short</p>
<p>   changing them but is it short changing them when you're offering</p>
<p>   them a three per cent real increase and guarantees in relation to</p>
<p>   people falling out of private health insurance or rising costs...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And they are still falling out of private health insurance, aren't</p>
<p>   they. Those commitments of yours didn't work.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>At a much slower rate. I don't accept that the final verdict</p>
<p>   is in on that. The rate of decrease has certainly slowed a great</p>
<p>   deal and it's unfortunate that something had not been done</p>
<p>   about it five years ago when the former Government, led by Mr Keating</p>
<p>   was warned by Graham Richardson that unless something was then done</p>
<p>   and that was in 1991, the numbers would continue to fall quite precipitously.</p>
<p>   We lost a bit of critical mass in membership then and if something</p>
<p>   had been done then the situation now would be a lot better and even</p>
<p>   Bob Carr, the soul Labor Premier in New South Wales, acknowledges</p>
<p>   that.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I don't know that he does.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He did, I am sorry, he did in fact acknowledge that some months</p>
<p>   ago. He probably doesn't acknowledge it now. His acknowledgments</p>
<p>   are Premiers' Conference-adjusted.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>PCA as they call it.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Something like that, yes.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The other question concerns a great many Australians for tomorrow</p>
<p>   is gun control.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It seems that Victoria is trying to water down its laws and possibly</p>
<p>   South Australia and Queensland. Are you standing firm?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely. I will be asking all of the Premiers and Chief Ministers</p>
<p>   to reaffirm the national agreement that was completed two years</p>
<p>   ago. The Commonwealth is strongly opposed to any watering down in</p>
<p>   substance of the laws. We don't want any changes that are going</p>
<p>   to in turn increase the pressure for further changes.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And Victoria's proposals would do all that, wouldn't they?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I was particularly worried about the suggestion that you should</p>
<p>   extend the opportunity for the use of semi automatic weapons to</p>
<p>   field and game shooters because on some estimates that I have been</p>
<p>   given, that could open up the field for a large number of people,</p>
<p>   and that in turn will lead to other groups saying, well if you're</p>
<p>   giving it to them you've got to give it to us. There's</p>
<p>   always...</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The thin edge of the wedge.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's the problem. The Australian public wanted this agreement.</p>
<p>   They applauded all of the Governments of Australia for negotiating</p>
<p>   it. I hope that we don't have an argument over this because</p>
<p>   I think everybody wants to see violence reduced as much as possible.</p>
<p>   Everybody wants to see this agreement maintained but our position</p>
<p>   is we are against any watering down of the agreement.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is there any possible sanction you could take against the state</p>
<p>   of Victoria if they did it?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't want at the moment to talk about sanctions because...</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But it may come?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't wish to talk about sanctions at the moment because</p>
<p>   what I am interested in is trying to have a sensible, calm discussion</p>
<p>   about it. I will be meeting the Premiers over dinner tonight at</p>
<p>   the Lodge. I will be extending the hospitality of the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   to my state colleagues and I will be very, very happy to have a</p>
<p>   talk to them informally about some of the issues that you and I</p>
<p>   have been discussing. On guns, I imagine it would be a cry from</p>
<p>   the heart of all Australians that this is something that transcends</p>
<p>   party politics, that transcends the divisions between Commonwealth</p>
<p>   and State. They thought they had a wonderful, historic, once in</p>
<p>   a lifetime agreement two years ago and they really don't want</p>
<p>   it undermined.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Very true. All right, when is the next election?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Don't know yet. Sometime between now and March of next year.</p>
<p>   At the right time.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You can't blame me for asking. </p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't and you will ask me again.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And everyone else will as well.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have a nice dinner. Don't serve them any fake Grange, will</p>
<p>   you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No chance.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thanks very much.</p>
