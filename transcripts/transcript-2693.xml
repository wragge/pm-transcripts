    <content><![CDATA[<p>AUSTRALIA/ JAPAN MINISTERIAL COMMITTEEÂ OPENING STATEMENT<br />By the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. William McMahon, CH, MP.<br />12 OctoberÂ 1972</p>
<p>Good Morning! On behalf of the Australian Government, I welcomeÂ to Australa five Japanese Ministers the Foreign Minister,Â Mr Ohira; the Minister of Agriculture and Fishery, Mr Adachi;Â the Minister of International Trade and Industry, Mr Nakasone;Â the Minit.; er of Transport, Sasaki, and the Minister of StateÂ for Economic Planning, Mr Arita.</p>
<p>This is the largest group of Ministers ever toÂ have come to Australia from any single country-and I can assureÂ you, we in Australia welcome you just as the Australian delegationÂ of eight AMinisters is, I understand, the largest group we have hadÂ at an international conference in Australia.<br />This important gathering is the inaugural meeting<br />of the Australia/ Japan Ministerial Committee which it was agreed<br />last year should be established:<br />" to hold consultations on bilateral and multilateral trade<br />and related proble s, as well as other matters of common<br />interest concernin the trade and economic relationshio<br />between the two countries that may subsequently be<br />considered necessary."<br />In accordance with this policy, the Committee is<br />to discuss economic and financial issues, multilateral trade<br />matters, bilateral trade, energy and natural resources, transportation<br />matters and Papua and New Guinea. / 2</p>
<p>2<br />The creation of the Committee underlines the great<br />importance of the many-faceted relationship between Australia and<br />Japan. Our trade has grown to the point where Japan is our largest<br />trading partner and Australia is Japan's second-largest trading<br />partner after the United States. Australia recently had its first<br />loan placement ever in the Japanese capital market.<br />But while the economic relationship forms the bulk<br />of te bilateral contacts between our two countries, our dealings<br />with each other extend into many other fields political,<br />scientific and cultural, and we co-operate extensively and intimately<br />in international organisations.<br />So we look at this Ministerial Committee Meeting<br />as a particularly important means of supplementing the established<br />pattern of Ministerial visits, and of way of furthering the frank<br />and friendly exchanges which are now a settled part of our<br />relationship that is the relationship between our two countries.<br />I am confident that Australia and Jaran can enlarge<br />their friendship and co-operation to the benefit of both nations,<br />and can together contribute, each in its own way, to the prosperity<br />and peace of the region in which we live.<br />If I can make this comment to you, Mr Foreign Minister,<br />Mr Ohira, I very much welcome the statement you made yesterday<br />immediately after you arrived in Australia. It was, I think, a<br />very helpful beginning to what I can hope to be a successful meeting<br />between your Ministers and my own, and I am sure that our belief in<br />success will turn out to be a reality.</p>
<p>As Treasurer, it was my -llr. sure to be involved with<br />many contacts in economic and financial matters between the<br />Australian and Japanese Governments. And in truth, I think I can<br />take credit for the formation and the subsequent working of the<br />official meetings as between the officials of the Government of<br />Japan and my own officials which were established at the time I<br />was the Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>And at that time, too, as Foreign Minister, I was evenÂ more closely involved with the strengthening of the warm relationshipÂ between our two countries, and was able to give a great deal of thoughtÂ to the methods by which that relationship should be able to develop.Â It was during my period as Foreign Minister, as IÂ have said, that the initiatives by our Governments were taken toÂ establish the Ministerial Committee as well. As Prime Minister, IÂ was naturally delighted to give my full backing to the proposalÂ to establish this Committee.</p>
<p>I am certain that it will prove to be one of theÂ most significant steos our peonles have taken in furthering ourÂ common goals of friendship, co-operation, prosperity and of peace.Â It therefore gives me great pleasure, Mr Chairman,Â to declare open the inaugural meeting of the Australia/ JapanÂ Ministerial Committee.</p>
