<p>Thank you very much to Mr McLelland and Mrs Henderson. To Mr and Mrs</p>
<p> Durham, Mr and Mrs Herbert; to Mr Kevin Sheedy, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p> Can I start my remarks by congratulating all of the young men and</p>
<p> women here today who will receive awards and recognition as a token</p>
<p> of your qualities, as a token of your professionalism and as a proper</p>
<p> recognition by your peers of your particular skills and your specialities.</p>
<p>It is for me quite an honour to address this awards ceremony and to</p>
<p> take the opportunity of saying what an enormous store the Government</p>
<p> places on apprenticeships and traineeships within the Australian community.</p>
<p> I endorse in the full the remarks that were made by Mr Durham about</p>
<p> the responsibility of all people in Government to ensure that the</p>
<p> maximum employment and apprenticeship opportunities are available</p>
<p> to young people.</p>
<p>I am particularly proud to say in that context that in the time that</p>
<p> the Government has been in office, the number of apprenticeships and</p>
<p> traineeships available will have risen from about 143,000 just over</p>
<p> two years ago, to in the order of 200,000 towards the end of this</p>
<p> year, and a result of our new apprenticeship and training system,</p>
<p> we have placed a much greater emphasis on improving the opportunities</p>
<p> for people - for men and women - in apprenticeships throughout all</p>
<p> areas of the Australian economy and throughout all areas of Australian</p>
<p> industry.</p>
<p>We have endeavoured to produce within the community a new ethic, a</p>
<p> new approach, a new era in relation to training and the options that</p>
<p> are available particularly to young people. We have, as I've</p>
<p> just mentioned, placed a greater emphasis on apprenticeships and traineeships</p>
<p> and we've tried to model those apprenticeships and traineeships</p>
<p> to suit the needs and the convenience of individual employers and</p>
<p> their employees, rather than trying to mould the desires and the needs</p>
<p> of individuals to a preconceived set notion of what ought to amount</p>
<p> to the right way of going about apprenticeships.</p>
<p>In addition to that, we have in recent weeks introduced a new system</p>
<p> of youth allowances which has profoundly altered the incentive that</p>
<p> used to exist under the old system away from that old system, where</p>
<p> the incentive was really to go on unemployment benefits rather than</p>
<p> to remain at school or to go into some kind of training. And the way</p>
<p> in which we have altered the system now means that there is a much</p>
<p> stronger incentive for young people to undertake training and far</p>
<p> less of an incentive for young people to go on unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>We have also introduced a work-for-the-dole scheme, whereby the community</p>
<p> in implementing the principle of what we call mutual obligation. And</p>
<p> that is if somebody can't get work in Australia, a decent society</p>
<p> has an obligation to give those people a decent level of social security</p>
<p> support, but it also has the right to ask of those people if it is</p>
<p> reasonable that they provide something in return for that social security</p>
<p> support.</p>
<p>We've also integrated into the apprenticeship system the notion</p>
<p> of school to work transition, and a number of the young men and women</p>
<p> who are receiving awards today are examples of that. And it is very</p>
<p> important that we see a greater connection and continuum between what</p>
<p> people learn at school and the skills that are required when they</p>
<p> leave school and enter the workforce. It is a trite expression for</p>
<p> any public figure to say today that we live in a world that is undergoing</p>
<p> great change. It is undergoing great change and whether we like it</p>
<p> or not, and there are some in our community who don't like it</p>
<p> - and I understand why they may not like it - but whether we like</p>
<p> it or not, every nation and every society must adjust itself to change.</p>
<p>There are some things in our society that quite properly we not only</p>
<p> want to hang on to but we should hang on to. As an Australian community,</p>
<p> we have certain received values that bind our society together. Those</p>
<p> values of decency, of recognising the individual worth of people irrespective</p>
<p> of their ethnic background, of encouraging tolerance and respect for</p>
<p> difference, of recognising that mateship and equality of treatment</p>
<p> have always been part of the Australian ethic, and hanging on to many</p>
<p> of those traditional values and attitudes that are so important to</p>
<p> keeping our society together. But hand-in-hand with that we must recognise</p>
<p> that we do live in a globalised world economy and unless Australia</p>
<p> competes, unless Australia is efficient, unless Australia's industries</p>
<p> are efficient, unless our training is modern and our training methods</p>
<p> are efficient and up-to-date we're not going to provide the jobs</p>
<p> and opportunities that particularly our young people will need as</p>
<p> the years go by.</p>
<p>That is why taking a few moments off for all of us, and particularly</p>
<p> the parents and friends of those who are receiving awards today, to</p>
<p> honour their abilities, to pay respects to the industry with which</p>
<p> they are associated, and to thank them for the contribution that they</p>
<p> are making to contemporary Australian society is so important.</p>
<p>I think part of a civilised society is to recognise and to honour</p>
<p> achievement and to honour success and today I know will be a source</p>
<p> of particular pride to the mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters</p>
<p> and friends of those who are going to receive awards. And I want all</p>
<p> of those people to savour this occasion and to enjoy the moment, because</p>
<p> you have played a role as we all know, as parents, as we live through</p>
<p> school and university examinations and other examinations with our</p>
<p> children, we all understand what it is like and we all have that great</p>
<p> sense of exhilaration when what our child or our brother or sister</p>
<p> has done is publicly recognised, and that is what today's ceremony</p>
<p> and awards presentation is all about. It is about recognising particular</p>
<p> skill and particular achievement. It is about honouring the importance</p>
<p> within our society of stable levels of employment. It is recognising</p>
<p> the importance of skilled trades within our community and it is also</p>
<p> recognising the restoration of the importance within modern Australia</p>
<p> of apprenticeships and traineeships.</p>
<p>To be quite frank, we went through a period in this country where</p>
<p> the importance of those things were down-graded. We became obsessed</p>
<p> as a society with university education to the detriment of other methods</p>
<p> of education and the other pathways to fulfilling employment. I'm</p>
<p> very happy to say that in recent years there's been a re-awakening</p>
<p> within the community of the importance of apprenticeships and traineeships</p>
<p> and a growing recognition that a holistic approach to learning and</p>
<p> education and instruction within the Australian community requires</p>
<p> a renewed emphasis on the sort of contributions that are going to</p>
<p> be honoured today.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen it is a particular privilege for me as Prime</p>
<p> Minister to be here today. The association that is staging today's</p>
<p> presentation ceremony is of course of very very long standing, as</p>
<p> Mr Durham mentioned. It predates the formation of most professional</p>
<p> and trade organisations within Australia. And those who receive the</p>
<p> awards today are joining a very long and distinguished list of Australians</p>
<p> who've gone before them within this particular calling. So I</p>
<p> congratulate again all of those young men and women who are receiving</p>
<p> recognition today. I thank you for the contribution that you are making</p>
<p> towards a positive image of the modern Australia. I thank your association</p>
<p> for the contribution that it is making to the Australian economy and</p>
<p> I wish all of you well in your future professional careers, and in</p>
<p> your personal lives I wish you great success, good health and great</p>
<p> happiness.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
