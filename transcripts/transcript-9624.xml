PRIME MINISTERTRANSCRIPT<br />
OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PRU GOWARD, " DAYBREAK", RADIO NATIONAL<br />
8 JUNE 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PG: Mr Keating, Mr Howard makes the point that a referendum for a<br />
republic will only succeed if it has bi-partisan political support how<br />
likely do you think that is?<br />
PM: Well, I did hope that tonight John Howard would answer the essential<br />
question does he believe an Australian should be the Australian<br />
Head of State? Now, if he had answered that in any way if he had<br />
said yes, then we are in agreement and we could then sort out<br />
between us, at least, as political parties, how that might best be done.<br />
If he said " no, I believe Queen Elizabeth 11 of Great Britain should be<br />
the Australian Head of State", we could have then made clear where<br />
both parties stood. What we had from him, in the event, was a<br />
discussion about some process. That is, whether he would have a<br />
People's Convention, and then he went on to tell us he would appoint<br />
half the people. So, he's not going to make it easy he's not going to<br />
make it easy. He's opposed to an Australian being head of state, and<br />
he's going to rough it up I think in terms of having a debate about<br />
process, within which he discusses not only whether Australia should<br />
be a republic, but also the power of the States, Commonwealth-State<br />
relations, 4 year terms, external affairs power, and all the other bits<br />
and pieces.<br />
PG: So in other words, so long as he refuses to take a position one way or<br />
the other, the republic is doomed?<br />
PM: No. I just think that the Liberal Party has got to take another defeat<br />
before they come to their senses.<br />
PG: So, can you win a referendum without Mr Howard taking a position?<br />
PM: Mr Howard won't be the Leader of the Parliamentary Liberal Party if he<br />
loses the next election, and I think that's the key point. It will take<br />
another election defeat for them to understand that the well-spring of </p>
<p>Australian sentiment in favour of us being independent truly<br />
independent in every respect has to be satisfied, and it won't be<br />
satisfied by obfuscation, indecision by the Liberal Party.<br />
PG: Now, do you agree, though, that the worst outcome for a referendum<br />
as John Howard says, would be a narrow win, or a narrow loss this<br />
must be decisive?<br />
PM: I think you can have a better gauge of that in a couple of years time. If<br />
we were having this discussion two and a half years ago, you wouldn't<br />
have given probably those in favour of a change as much chance as<br />
they have in fact had, and come as far as they have been able, in this<br />
time. In a couple more years, the debate and the mood of the debate, I<br />
think is going is change dramatically. And I think... . you know, what I<br />
think is a pity a pity for him, his Party, and the country is that it's like<br />
pulling teeth out. You know, they have got to be dragged along to<br />
everything. They believe that the Australia Act shouldn't have been<br />
introduced. They believe that, you know, appeals to the Privy Council<br />
that was a dreadful thing when that was dropped. Of course, all of<br />
these changes have now gone on unremarked, and no-one would go<br />
back on them. As no-one in fact will ever go back when we have an<br />
Australian Head of State.<br />
PG: So you are saying that you think it will be, in the end, overwhelming?<br />
PM: I think so, because how can we go on with our Head of State being the<br />
Monarch of another country, and yet try and say to ourselves seriously<br />
" here we are, independent, representing that sense of ourselves, you<br />
know, what we have become"?<br />
PG: I guess what Mr Howard is saying, though, is that if you want an<br />
overwhelming result, you are not doing the debate a service by<br />
pushing it into a three year time frame too much too soon?<br />
PM: No. I don't think it is. And you see, there's another important point<br />
here too, Pmu the proposal I put last night was the minimalist change.<br />
That's the minimal change that is, you virtually cross out the word<br />
Governor-General, write in the word President, the system of<br />
Government functions as it does now. What could a Convention do<br />
that is more simple than that? What a Convention could only do is<br />
something more complex than that, and that is what Mr Howard said<br />
tonight. He said, " what we ought to look at, too, is Commonwealth<br />
relations with the States, the external affairs power it's been abused<br />
4 year terms" having voted against that a few years ago himself.<br />
Whereas at the same time he says " oh, hang on this proposal of<br />
yours is, you know, not going to be well understood". Yet, it is the<br />
most simple one the most simple proposal. So, there is going to be<br />
no process which is more simple than this, because any other<br />
proposition must be more complex. I mean, if the head of state is to be<br />
elected, and the reserve powers codified far more complex. You<br />
know, almost any other modality of change any other mode of change<br />
will be far more complex. Therefore, the notion that you have a </p>
<p>Convention which makes it simple and better understood is, of course,<br />
nonsense.<br />
PG: So, in other words, you are saying you think that if you keep it simple,<br />
you can get it up in three years?<br />
PM: Yes. And the important value in keeping it simple is that it doesn't<br />
change the relationships within our system of Government.<br />
PG: Well, let's look at that because, of course, he argues that it will that<br />
the reserve powers that you say can be just transferred to a republic,<br />
he argues are vested in the Monarchy, not in a person?<br />
PM: This is a sort of, what I think is, essentially a silly argument. That there<br />
is some sort of mystical power there is a mystic transfer, you know.<br />
Where, in fact, the Republic Advisory Committee report which I have<br />
with me covered the point, I thought, very well. It said, in discussing<br />
it, it had some proposed words. It had " the head of state shall exercise<br />
his or her powers, and perform his or her functions, in accordance with<br />
the constitutional conventions which related to the exercise of the<br />
powers of performance of the functions of the Governor-General". In<br />
other words, we say that expressly in new words to be inserted. And,<br />
let me just remind your listeners, that a similar provision was included<br />
in the South African Constitution in 1961 as the Republic Advisory<br />
Committee Report reminds us. Where it became a republic with the<br />
Westminster system and then it had this to say in their Constitution<br />
the Constitutional Conventions which existed immediately prior to the<br />
commencement of this Act, shall not be affected by the provisions of<br />
this Act other words, those Conventions which existed while<br />
South Africa had the Monarch of Great Britain as the Head of State,<br />
those Conventions will not be affected by this change.<br />
Now, as far as I know, Mr Mandela is motoring along quite well as<br />
President of the Republic of South Africa. He didn't need some<br />
mystical transfer from Westminster. That was just John Howard at his<br />
manipulative worst trying to put a red herring legal argument across<br />
the trail.<br />
PG: But, of course, he says it George Winterton's, who is a republican.<br />
PM: Yes, that is fair enough, but he did sign this report and in that report<br />
he was party to the report he might have also been party to the<br />
argument, but they suggest here that words the sort of<br />
constitutional provisions which might be included Now, those words<br />
came from the acting Solicitor General, the Commonwealth Crown<br />
Solicitor who is our best, those words were his suggestion. So, we can<br />
all pull our lawyers out and say he says this and someone else says<br />
that, but in the end if Australia decides that the head of state shall<br />
have the same powers as the Governor-General formerly had and<br />
enjoyed and excised then we could do that. </p>
<p>PG: But, it is divisive isn't it. The community isn't yet set on a course, there<br />
is a range of views.<br />
PM: I think they are very interested.<br />
PG: They are interested.<br />
PM: They are interested, I don't think it is divisive.<br />
PG: There are a lot of people who still want to stick to the Monarchy.<br />
PM: Yes, but that is an opinion. It is not division, I don't think. There may<br />
be some people who feel hot and bothered about this, but by and<br />
large, I think most people are interested and that is a good thing.<br />
PG: But, I guess his point is that you can't have a divisiveness over<br />
constitutional changes because it is better to wait until you can have<br />
them.<br />
PM: Yes, but that is the little implied threat. You see, unless you get us on<br />
side, Prime Minister, you won't get any change here. You are going to<br />
have to cuddle up and kid to us and by the way, we have got this black<br />
hole convention where this issue will get lost along with arrangements<br />
with the States, external affairs powers, et cetera. So, what do you<br />
reckon about that? And, I'm supposed to say ' oh, that is profound.' It<br />
is nonsense. All John Howard had to do tonight was provide just a<br />
modicum of leadership. All he had to do was say was say ' look..<br />
PG: Well, you call it leadership, he has shown his own leadership.<br />
PM: No, no, he didn't show any leadership. Leadership would have been<br />
him saying he was in favour of the retention of The Queen or he<br />
was in favour of an Australian being head of state. Either position was<br />
a position of leadership on the issue. I think the leadership can only<br />
really be, in the national interest, that an Australian should be the head<br />
of state. But, he wouldn't even say that. What he came at was a<br />
colourless speech laden with cliches, about how it has all got to go to a<br />
Convention and when we got down to it, it was a convention half<br />
appointed by him. And, then just to make sure it was dripping with<br />
cynicism, he then said that 10 per cent of them would be young<br />
Australians between 18 and 25 years of age. Making certain in his<br />
model that not any of them would ever be, that he would never let any<br />
of those young Australians ever be the head of state of this country.<br />
PG: How democratic is your proposal though? He says it is not, you offer<br />
no choice, it is either a two-thirds vote of Parliament for the head of<br />
state or nothing. Is he right that that will put people off right from the<br />
beginning?<br />
PM: I think Jeff Kennett said it all very eloquently today when he said there<br />
is growing recognition, the issue is going to be resolved. Now, that will<br />
be done through a referendum and the public, each and every one of </p>
<p>us, will be able to make our own decision. That is the democratic act.<br />
It is not me saying it, it is the conservative Premier. He was asked<br />
' Why do you think Mr Howard is supporting a peoples convention?' He<br />
said it is only going to be able to really express their personal<br />
views. They may argue they represent a greater number of people,<br />
but finally this is going to be decided by each and every one of us. A<br />
convention to me is just another committee ' So, there is not much<br />
point calling out 400 people out of a community of 18 million, sitting<br />
them down saying ' now what do you think about that?'. In other words,<br />
what he is saying is the democratic expression, the ultimate democracy<br />
or democratic act is a vote we all get on this. There can be no greater<br />
strength than that.<br />
PG: But arguing a referendum, that is the only vote we get.<br />
PM: That's it. That's the vote that matters. But, to have a rinky dink<br />
convention, chosen half by a Coalition government and then sifting<br />
down and saying ' oh, we might discuss that republic, but we have got<br />
other issues to discuss as well, we'll make that item number five, after<br />
we go through the States and the external affairs power.' I mean, to<br />
use an old Australianism, he is not fair dinkum. He is not fair dinkum.<br />
He doesn't want to do this and he doesn't want to help and he is like<br />
every other conservative we have ever had. It could have been<br />
Stanley Melbourne Bruce up there saying that today or anyone else<br />
back in our history. It is like pulling teeth to get them to agree to<br />
anything. I<br />
PG: But, in the end, this is the big test as John Howard put it at the<br />
beginning of his speech The system of government must produce<br />
unity, stability and tolerance', all of which we have at the moment.<br />
How can you better that with a republic?<br />
PM: By making clear that we can never be the independent nation we<br />
believe we are when one of us is not our head of state.<br />
PG: Prime Minister, thank you for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you indeed.<br />
