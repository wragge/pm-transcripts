PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 26 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
I welcome and applaud the decision of the New Zealand<br />
Government to set aside ratification of the Antarctic<br />
Minerals Convention and work with Australia to protect<br />
Antarctica from mining.<br />
As one of the seven Claimant States, New Zealand is a key<br />
party to the Antarctic Treaty. Mr Palmer's decision to<br />
set aside ratifying the Minerals Convention ( known as the<br />
Wellington Convention) will give even greater impetus to<br />
Australia's efforts with France to create an Antarctic<br />
Wilderness Reserve a Land of Science.<br />
Mr Palmer and I discussed this possibility during my<br />
recent visit to New Zealand.<br />
Last Saturday, Commander Jacques Cousteau and I discussed<br />
the increasing international support snowballing<br />
support that Australia and France have been getting for<br />
our proposal to create an Antarctic Wilderness Reserve.<br />
Other European countries such as Italy, Belgium and<br />
Greece are comining in behind us. Soviet Prime Minister<br />
Ryzhkov expressed a keen interest in our proposal when I<br />
met him in Canberra in mid-February. And Judging from<br />
developments in the Congress, the United States appears<br />
increasingly unlikely to ratify the Convention.<br />
Our push for a Wilderness Reserve is looking very strong<br />
indeed. With New Zealand's support, we can look forward<br />
with even greater optimism to keeping Antarctica free<br />
from mining.<br />
