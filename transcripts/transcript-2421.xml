FOR PRESS PM. NO. 55/ 1971<br />
AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL GALLERY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr William McMahon<br />
The Government has approved the preparation ef<br />
final design drawings based on sketch plans for the Australian<br />
National Gallery in Canberra.<br />
It is expected that this design work will take<br />
eighteen months to complete.<br />
The approval is in accordance with the earlier<br />
Government decision of April last year, directing that the design<br />
of the Gallery should commence.<br />
The Government decision that design work should<br />
proceed does not involve any commital of funds nor does it<br />
constitute any approval for construction to take place. These<br />
matters will be the subject of subsequent Government consideration<br />
after the completion of the detailed design work now authorised.<br />
CANBERRA, 21 May 1971 </p>
