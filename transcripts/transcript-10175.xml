Mr HOWARD ( Bennielong Prime Minister) ( 4.10 Mr<br />
Speaker, Madam President, it is only the second time in the<br />
history of this parliament that the two houses have sat<br />
together to hear an address from a visiting head of state or<br />
visiting head of government. That circumstance itself is a<br />
token of the particular esteem in which the office of the<br />
Presidency of the United States of America is held by the<br />
Australian people, and it is also a markedly special<br />
relationship that exists between our two countries.<br />
Mr President, when the six colonies of Australia<br />
federated in 1901 to form the Commonwealth of Australia, we<br />
adopted a Westminster system of parliamentary government. But<br />
we borrowed extensively from the United States of America in<br />
relation to our other constitutional forms. We named our lower<br />
house the Rouse of Representatives and our upper house the<br />
Senatet after the pattern of your country. We decided to<br />
assign specific powers to the central government with the<br />
residue to the state governments, after the pattern of your<br />
country. We borrowed heavily on your federal experience. The<br />
history of Australia from the parliamentary point of view has<br />
been that mixture. But out of that amalgam of British and<br />
American tracts has emerged a distinctive and characteristic<br />
Australian parliamentary democracy. It has been an echo of the<br />

aspirations of the Australian people over the long years since<br />
Federation. There are only a very small number of countries which<br />
have continuously been democratic through the 20th century.<br />
The United States of America and Australia are two of that<br />
small and very select number of nations. For that reason,<br />
above many other reasons, your presence here today is warmly<br />
received, warmly welcomed and warmly applauded by all of the<br />
Australian people, irrespective of their political beliefs. It<br />
is rare indeed that we have an assembly of all members and<br />
senators across the party divide unanimously to welcome the<br />
leader of a great nation, a nation which has led the cause of<br />
freedom and the battle for freedom and the values we all share<br />
in common over such a long period of time.<br />
We both belong to a robust democratic tradition, We both<br />
belong to nations that believe in individual liberty, believe<br />
in personal values, believe in the freedom of the press,<br />
believe in the separation of the judiciary from the<br />
legislative and the executive. For all of those reasons, and<br />
many others, you are indeed a very welcome g-uest. I<br />
I hope, Mr President, that your time here in Canberra is<br />
one that you remember fondly. We certainly will. I hope both<br />
you and Mrs Clinton enjoy your time and carry with you a<br />
special recollection of your addressing this joint sitting of<br />

Mr BEAZLEY ( Brand Leader of the Opposition) ( 4.12 p. m.)<br />
Mr Speaker, Mr President, Madam President, honourable<br />
members and senators; Mr President, you are most welcome on<br />
this historic occasion as the Prime Minister pointed out,<br />
one of only a couple and we are very proud to be here with<br />
you. I should say that there are more than simply the<br />
government and opposition represented here. There are a number<br />
of independent members and also members of two other political<br />
parties, the Greens and the Australian Democrats. This is a<br />
great gathering of all Australian opinion to hear you in this<br />
place, and nio better forum than this.<br />
George Schultz once said to me, ' How could anybody spend<br />
a $ 1 billion on a building?' We took him through the building<br />
and he worked out how we managed to spend it. it is a place of<br />
which we are enormously proud and is a great symbol of our<br />
nation and the unity of our nation and the hopes and<br />
aspirations of our people. It has within it a very specific<br />
Australian design.<br />
It is of course not the f irst time your visit here or<br />
the visit of your predecessor George Bush that there has<br />
been the involvement of the United States in our parliamentary<br />
process, and I think it is useful to reflect on that.<br />

THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 20 NOv 1996<br />
Throughout World War II we did have a number of parliamentary<br />
briefings given by General Douglas MacArthur, who is a man<br />
whose name rings in the halls of fame of this nation and a<br />
name that is remembered with gratitude. Which brings to mind<br />
the fact that we ought to in this place appreciate through<br />
yourself the role of your nation over the last 50 years or so<br />
of international history.<br />

qMr B3eaz lay in ccntinuatiowz<br />
You now preside over a nation which has produced probably<br />
the most unselfish gesture that any nation has in recorded<br />
history that is, your people have been prepared to lay<br />
themselves on the line when they could have been secure in<br />
isolation and to risk for themselves nuclear devastation on<br />
behalf of their friends. It ought not go unrecorded that we do<br />
appreciate that.<br />
it should be said that that sat lightly on this couttry<br />
because I do not think we have ever been in recent times<br />
likely to have enemies that would cause the United States to<br />
riske that nuclear devastation in assisting us. Nevertheless,<br />
we have thought it important for ourselves to play a part in<br />
that. I have often argued, particularly when I was the<br />
Minister for Defence, that we have never been consumers of<br />
American security except in that one period.<br />
I also like to point out to my American colleagues that<br />
General Douglas MacArthur had more Australian troops under his<br />
command until late 1943 than American. His great victories<br />
early in the war in New Guinea were fought substantially with<br />
Australian troops. Hie set that matter at rest and changed the<br />
ratios in the Philippines, But, until that point in time,<br />
there had been a very substantial contribution. we have made<br />
our contribution over those years, too.<br />

THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVrES 20 Nov 1996<br />
We very much appreciate the remarks I heard you make in<br />
your press conference that you had praise for the Australian<br />
government and Successive Australian governments for the role<br />
they now wish to play in removing from the American people and<br />
the world that terrible obligation. Your praise for the role<br />
of our government recently in the comprehensive test ban<br />
arrangement was very welcome on all sides of politics herea as<br />
is your commitment to ensuring that your people and the world<br />
generally have that horror removed from them.<br />
You have been man who has exercised leadership in this<br />
region whose leadership we all count on. You go from here<br />
with our Prime Minister to APEC the leadership component of<br />
which you had so much to do with in initiating. That forum is<br />
now broadening its wings from simply-a consideration of<br />
economic matters, as critical as those are, to broader<br />
regional considerations.<br />
we have always sought American engagement in this region.<br />
We have never always agreed with you on the things that you<br />
have chosen to do in that time, but we have always sought it<br />
because we have always believed that at the end of the day the<br />
values we share are the same, Those values are decent human<br />
values. Those values are egalitarian values that recognise the<br />
rights of all people of all backgrounds. Those values are<br />
values which at the end of the day ensure world peace and<br />
