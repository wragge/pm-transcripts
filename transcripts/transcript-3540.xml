4JAUSTRALIA(<br />
PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 409<br />
9 DECEMBER, 1974.<br />
POLITICAL RIGHTS OF WOMEN<br />
The Australian Government has taken action to<br />
accede to the UN Convention on the Political Rights of Women<br />
and to ratify ILO Convention No. 100 ( Equal Remuneration).<br />
Announcing this today, the Prime Minister, Mr.<br />
Whitlam, said 10 December 1974 was a fitting date for<br />
Australia to become a party to those two Conventions.<br />
It was on 10 December 1948 that the United Nations General<br />
Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The<br />
purpose of that Declaration was to ensure fundamental rights<br />
and freedoms for all persons, without discrimination of any<br />
kind, arising from race, sex, religion and political or other<br />
opinions. Since it came to power, the Government has sought to<br />
pass legislation to guarantee fundamental rights without<br />
discrimination on grounds of sex and to take other steps to<br />
ensure that it acted in the spirit of the Universal Declaration<br />
of Human Rights. Mr. Whitlam said that the Government's decision to<br />
become a party to these two Conventions was evidence, of its<br />
desire to ensure that Australia's policies were soundly based<br />
on respect for, and on the protection and enhancement of, civil<br />
liberties and basic human rights for all its people, regardless<br />
of their sex. The Government had signed the International<br />
Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic,*"<br />
Social and Cultural Rights and would proceed to ratification<br />
of them as soon as enabling legislation had been passed by<br />
Parliament. Australia would also ratify the International<br />
Convention of the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination<br />
as soon as Parliament had passed the appropriate legislation.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said 1975 had been designated by the<br />
United Nations as International Women's Year. The Government<br />
had, since it came to office, been active in promoting equal<br />
opportunities for women in all fields of public life and<br />
ensuring that all discriminatory legislationf was removed which<br />
might prevent women from taking their rightful place in society.<br />
