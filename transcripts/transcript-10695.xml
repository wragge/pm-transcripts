<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, thank you for your time. Now you are doing the hard</p>
<p>   sell in Queensland. How are you gauging the feelings at the moment?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Very positive. This plan's greatest appeal is that it will</p>
<p>   be good for the whole of Australia. It will reduce the cost of producing</p>
<p>   goods and services in Australia and that will make it more competitive</p>
<p>   and stronger, and generate more jobs. Its benefit for all Australians</p>
<p>   is its most appealing feature.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Well, let's look at Queensland though. Queensland is crucial</p>
<p>   to the survival of your Government at the next election and we all</p>
<p>   know what happened at the State poll Â– humiliation. What makes</p>
<p>   you think that you can turn that around and sell this tax to Queenslanders?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well just put the politics aside. The benefit for Queensland of</p>
<p>   this package is enormous. It's the most decentralised State</p>
<p>   in Australia and it will benefit more than any other State from</p>
<p>   the huge cuts in fuel costs. I can't understand why Mr Beattie</p>
<p>   is against it. He should be grabbing it with open arms. It is a</p>
<p>   huge boon to Queensland.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  You are trying to sell to a very very cynical electorate.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I haven't found them cynical, I've found them interested.</p>
<p>   It is not just a tax cut. The days of having tax cuts without reform</p>
<p>   are gone because they just disappear, but what you want is an integrated</p>
<p>   plan to make the system work better.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Well, like it or not One Nation is on the rise in Queensland. We</p>
<p>   had Pauline Hanson coming out today saying she didn't believe</p>
<p>   it was good for middle Australia. What do you have to say about</p>
<p>   her comments? You were fairly scathing earlier today.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, the ones I've heard she just doesn't have the facts</p>
<p>   correct.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  So she doesn't understand.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, what I heard this morning was wrong on every score just about.</p>
<p>   The suggestion that it is bad for self-funded retirees is wrong.</p>
<p>   It makes it harder for overseas tax dodgers to take place, the suggestion</p>
<p>   that foreign investors are let off lightly is wrong. It is very</p>
<p>   good for middle Australia because you will now be able to increase</p>
<p>   your income from $20,000 a year to $50,000 a year without going</p>
<p>   into a higher tax bracket. That is a huge bonanza for middle Australia.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Well, she is coming out with a tax package later today, do you think</p>
<p>   she can come up with anything better than you've come up with?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  In one word, no. Okay. What about, there seems to be some cynicism</p>
<p>   about the 10% -guaranteeing the 10%. Can you really do that?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I don't think you can get a stronger guarantee than requiring</p>
<p>   the agreement of every State Government and both Houses of the Federal</p>
<p>   Parliament and the Federal Government. My experience in 24 years</p>
<p>   is if that hasn't happened then it is not likely to happen</p>
<p>   in the future.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  But you haven't convinced the National Party national president</p>
<p>   Don McDonald and he came out today and said why not a referendum,</p>
<p>   lock it into the constitution?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Mr McDonald last night said he thought the present mechanism was</p>
<p>   fine.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Well, this is what he said today: lock it into the constitution.</p>
<p>   Is that not a good idea?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  You don't need to do that because the mechanism we have is</p>
<p>   quite adequate.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  So we should believe you -10% will stay?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes. Absolutely. Absolutely.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Okay. Just getting back to the cynical electorate, I mean, we get</p>
<p>   a lot of calls, I heard you on radio this morning. There was a lot</p>
<p>   of aggression out there that people aren't going to be better</p>
<p>   off.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  You've got to bear in mind that on talk back radio some calls</p>
<p>   are organised.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Certainly I understand that, but you've got the Newspoll, every</p>
<p>   Newspoll is different, but it looks like the nation is quite clearly</p>
<p>   divided. You have a huge job on your hands.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I don't take too much notice of the polls. I tend to judge</p>
<p>   the community's mood by my dealing with people. The message</p>
<p>   I get is that people are interested, they like the idea that it</p>
<p>   is for the good of the whole country. They are worried about the</p>
<p>   country's future and they want more information and we are</p>
<p>   providing them with that information through an education campaign.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Okay Prime Minister. My understanding is that you could win or lose</p>
<p>   on Queensland's votes at the federal poll. You are convinced</p>
<p>   that you can convince us that this is good for us.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I'm seeking to persuade all Australians, not just Queenslanders,</p>
<p>   but all Australians that this is good for their country and that's</p>
<p>   its great appeal because it will make us a more competitive stronger</p>
<p>   country into the 21st Century and that more than anything</p>
<p>   is why I would like people to support it.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  All right we'll be seeing a lot you up until now and October</p>
<p>   when the rumoured election date is.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I haven't decided when the election is but I come to</p>
<p>   Queensland regularly no matter what the electoral calender is and</p>
<p>   no matter what the policy issue is. I've been a regular visitor</p>
<p>   to Queensland in the 24 years that I have been in public life. Now</p>
<p>   is no different.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  All right Prime Minister, thank you for your time.</p>
