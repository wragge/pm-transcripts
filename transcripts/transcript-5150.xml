PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT THURSDAY, 27 SEPTEMBER 1979<br />
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW<br />
CANBERRA Prime Minister-<br />
It's been a very difficult evening. It's been a very difficult<br />
evening f or Ian Sinclair. He has had the best interests of<br />
the Government very much in mind and that is appreciate by<br />
Doug Anthony and myself.--by all his colleagues. He believed<br />
that the action that he has action is in the best interests<br />
of the Government and I haven't the slightest doubt that<br />
that was foremost in his mind. We need to remember, I think,<br />
that the N. S. W. Government has published a report which has<br />
left very much up in the air. It makes charges, it makes<br />
allegations, it comes to conclusions, in a sense, and. as I<br />
am advised it is not a document that could be used as evidence<br />
in law-. and the N. S. 11. Government needs to take action so that<br />
the matter can be finally determined one way or another. I am<br />
sure Ian Sinclair would want that action taken, because he<br />
would want the opportunity to clear himself. Now, that can't<br />
happen or it is very difficult to see how it can happen<br />
unless the N. S. W. Government does what it ought, and that is<br />
allow the processes to unfold so that the matters in<br />
Mr. Finnane's Report can be truly and properly tested.<br />
Question Mr. Sinclair spoke to you tonight. Did he agree with the<br />
decision that he should resign?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
It was his decision, didn't you read his letter?<br />
Question Did you agree that he should resign.<br />
Prime Ministerof<br />
course I did, because there was no argument about that.<br />
He believed that that was in the best interests for the<br />
Government as a whole.. I've got no doubt that that was the<br />
consideration foremost in his own mind. : There was discussion<br />
between Mr.. Sinclair, Mr. Anthony, Mr. Lynch and myself.<br />
Mr. Nixon was there. There was no disagreement, but the<br />
decision was very clear Mr. Sinclair's own, and as my letter<br />
has shown, with great regret again in the interests of the<br />
Government I will be making certain recommendations to<br />
the Governor-General in the morning.<br />
Question Is there any effect on the Coalition because of the resignation?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, none at all. 0 00---</p>
