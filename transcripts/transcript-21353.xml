    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Could I just start by saying that I welcome very much the announcement that's been made by Gunns about a feasibility study into a chlorine-free, environmentally friendly pulp mill.  I know the processes in that will take some time but I would indicate that if that feasibility study turns out to be positive then the Federal Government would consider contributing some $5 million to the project costs of the development of an environmentally friendly, chlorine-free pulp mill.  Now that is dependent naturally on the rules in relation to the EIS and of course the feasibility study turning out to be positive.  But this industry is hugely important to job security all over Tasmania. I have no doubt that the signing of the Regional Forest Agreement between my Government and the former Tasmanian Government back in 1997 has delivered the investment certainty that has resulted in the heavy investment in the industry and therefore the employment stability and the employment security of so many men and women in northern Tasmania and indeed all over the State and any suggestion that the RFA would be disturbed or challenged will threaten the job security of hundreds and indeed thousands of people in this state.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> ... very critical of the Tasmanian forestry industry, he's concerned that there is intimidation, that perhaps (inaudible) down here are not good for the environment, nor are they good for Tasmanian forests. Do you agree with some of Bill Heffernan's criticisms?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No I don't agree with his criticism of the industry, no.  The Federal Government's policy is very clear.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Do you regret the decision to go to war?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> What in Iraq?  Certainly not.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> One issue with Gunns, will you meet with Bob Brown and go on a tour...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well Bob Brown does not speak for every environmentalist in Australia, Bob Brown is a politician who has the most radical policies on so many issues and this idea that somehow or other when you say environment you immediately say Bob Brown is ridiculous.  No, I visit all parts of Australia, I don't need invitations from Mr Brown or indeed anybody else to visit any part of what is part of our country.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Would the $5 million in assistance for project costs be in the form of infrastructure or a grant?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well that's something that we'll look at when the time comes, but it's an earnest of our support and it's an earnest of our belief that continued investment is critical to job security.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Some people might be cynical about this announcement on the eve of an election, saying that it's a grab for votes in Tasmania.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well they would be entirely cynical, might I point out to you 15 years ago when I was Leader of the Opposition I happened to be in Burnie when the decision was taken by the former government not to go ahead with the pulp mill and I've always thought that an environmentally sensitive and, in the case of what is now in contemplation, chlorine-free pulp mill is of enormous long term benefit to Tasmania. But we also have a huge deficit when it comes to exports in this area and if we can develop an environmentally friendly pulp mill, and there's no reason why we can't, that would be a very good thing and I just want to make it clear that it's something the Federal Government is sympathetic towards.  But the other thing you've got to remember is that if it hadn't been for the Regional Forest Agreement we would not have had the stronger investment and economic climate in Tasmania in the forest industry that we are now so evidently enjoying.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Is the Coalition united behind you in not regretting to go to war?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Yes.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Prime Minister, why won't the Government attempt to recover some of the accidental overpayments of the $600...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well that article in the paper this morning caused me some concern and I have sought information. I don't accept that if somebody is accidentally overpaid they shouldn't pay the money back and I've sought advice and information. I think if somebody is accidentally overpaid they should be encouraged to pay the money back. I think it sets the wrong tone. Now as to why that memorandum was sent in those terms I'm seeking information, but speaking as Prime Minister, I am in favour of people who are overpaid paying back the overpayments.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Why only encouragement, why shouldn't they be forced to pay their overpayments back?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well I'd have to have a look at the legislation, I'm getting some advice on it.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> The Supreme Court ruling in the US on the Guantanamo Bay detainees. Does that have any  implications for the Australian detainees.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well as I understand it, and I'm seeking some further advice on this as well, and I'm just going on media reports, but as I understand it what the Supreme Court has said is two things, that the detention is not unlawful, but consistent with that people can appeal within the American court system against their detention.  Now that's the extent of my understanding at present.</p>
<p> Okay.</p>
