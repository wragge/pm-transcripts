    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Minister for Youth Kate Ellis today announced $10 million to set up five new youth community centres across Australia.</p>
<p>This idea was one of the top ten ideas at the 2020 Youth Summit in April 2008, in which 100 young Australians came together in an historic meeting to help shape our national agenda.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government is committed to listening to young people and working with them to deliver their innovative ideas to help shape the nation's future.</p>
<p>The combined arts, business and community centres will be established in Priority Employment Areas and will provide opportunities for young people to take part in community activities.</p>
<p>The centres will offer a safe place for young people to make friends and develop new skills to support their education, training and employment</p>
<p>The youth community centres may be existing buildings that are refurbished or newly built premises. Young people will also get training and employment opportunities during the design and construction phase.</p>
<p>The centre locations will be decided based on their ongoing sustainability, existing local facilities and the level of youth disadvantage in the community.</p>
<p>The five youth centres are part of the $300 million Local Jobs funding secured by the Greens as part of the Government's economic stimulus package.</p>
<p>The announcement coincides with the launch of a nationwide youth consultation - the National Conversation - which is part of the National Strategy for Young Australians.</p>
