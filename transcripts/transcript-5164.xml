PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 14 October 1979<br />
AUSTRALIAN FEDERATION OF BLIND CITIZENS WHITE CANE'SAFETY DAY<br />
It gives me great pleasure to again join with the Australian<br />
Federation of Blind Citizens in recognising the 15th October<br />
as White Cane Safety Day.<br />
There is a need for all of us to care more about the problems<br />
of the visually handicapped and to do all we can to help them.<br />
This day is in no sense related to any fund raising programme<br />
but rather is designed to heighten the Australian public's<br />
interest and awareness of the meaning of the use of the white<br />
cane.<br />
The need for the motorist and fellow pedestrian to respond<br />
to the display of white cane is, of course, of great<br />
importance.<br />
White Cane Safety Day gives all of us an opportunity to reflect<br />
on what we would experience in our everyday life if we were<br />
visually handicapped or blind. Not just the day-to-day<br />
difficulties of moving about, but of missing those sights<br />
which help to enrich our environment changing landscapes,<br />
the smiling faces of our children and friends, flowers in<br />
bloom as well as the enjoyment of films and television.<br />
our awareness and acceptance of the visually handicapped should<br />
extend in a special way to children, in this the--Y6-Arf-f the<br />
Child. We should all remember that they have a difficult<br />
road to tread while learning to cope with their disability.<br />
The knowledge, the very awareness of his or her acceptance<br />
by fellow citizens can only serve to brighten the handicapped<br />
child's outlook to the future.<br />
I hope that White Cane-Safety Day will-be the focus for<br />
increasing public awareness of the needs of all blind and<br />
visually handicapped people in our community. </p>
