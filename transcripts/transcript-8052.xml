FOR MEDIA 6 JULY 1990<br />
I will attend the 21st South Pacific Forum meeting in<br />
Vanuatu from 29 July 1 August. The South Pacific Forum<br />
is the premier organisation of the region and its annual<br />
meeting provides the opportunity for regional Heads of<br />
Government to exchange views and deliberate on matters of<br />
regional concern.<br />
While in Vanuatu I will hold discussions with Prime<br />
Minister Father Walter Lini and members of his Government<br />
on questions of mutual interest, including bilateral<br />
issues and broader regional developments. Australia has<br />
a close and constructive relationship with Vanuatu. I<br />
look forward to the visit and to attending Vanuatu's<br />
tenth independence celebrations.<br />
At the invitation of the French Prime Minister M Michel<br />
Rocard, I shall make an official visit to New Caledonia<br />
on 27-28 July while en route to the Forum.<br />
I will take the opportunity there to meet government<br />
officials and elected representatives from the<br />
Territorial and Regional Assemblies including members of<br />
the FLNKS and RPCR political groupings.<br />
My Government has been encouraged by the process of<br />
reconciliation in New Caledonia set in train by the<br />
Matignon Accords. We welcome the continuing commitment<br />
of all parties to the political and economic<br />
accommodation now occurring in the Territory. </p>
