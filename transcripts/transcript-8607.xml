TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JUDY TIERNEY, ABC RADIO, HOBART<br />
AUGUST 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
IT: The Prime Minister is with me now, and welcome to Tasmania Paul Keating.<br />
PM: Thank you very much, Judy, it's nice to be here.<br />
JT: You lose marks for being late around here, you know.<br />
PM: Well, as I just said to you, if you are an announcer and you're late you don't come<br />
back, but if you're the Prime Minister and you're late, you can get away with it.<br />
Fr: Well I don't know about that. First question today to you, and I think I'll go right<br />
into It because therc are a number of things I want to put to you, and I hope you<br />
can stay with us for the half hour, can you?<br />
PM: I can) yes.<br />
JT: Terrific. Increase in the -Medicare levy, is that the first move to taking over all<br />
health insurance in Australia?<br />
PM: Well that's speculation. This time at each year before the Budget there is always<br />
speculation about Budget measures. But there is a bit of focus on Medicare now,<br />
and It's because the Opposition propose to force people into private insurance.<br />
Whereas this scheme has worked very well now for just on a decade, all<br />
Australians can get medical protection regardless of income. and we have been at<br />
pains over the years to keep the scheme relevant and good, but an increase in the<br />
levy Is at this stage just simply speculation.<br />
iT: Just speculation, no more substance to it than that? </p>
<p>TEL: 5. Aug. 92 13: 49 No. 013 R. 02/.<br />
2<br />
FM: Well, as I said to you, every time this year we always get asked about Budget<br />
measures.<br />
IT: Well is it going to happen?<br />
PM: The only reply I can give you is that there is no point in mne speculating about<br />
rumoured Budget measures.<br />
IT: Yes, but you know about it already. Is there, just to extrapolate that ther, even<br />
further, is there a plan to take over all health insurance in Australia?<br />
PM: No, there's never been a plan to take over all health insurance in Australia. We let<br />
Australians privately insure if they choose, but the great majority don't because<br />
Medicare covers them for medical and hospital protection. And one of the things<br />
which people do is insure themselves privately, for private hospitals or private<br />
treatment in hospitals, quite often when they don't have to. And I think the one<br />
point to get across about that is that many people arc privately insured and they<br />
don't have to bc.<br />
JT: Still on health, on June 2 the AMA wrote to you asking if you'll establish a<br />
national task force to look at and act on the health effects of the uncmploye. Now<br />
you haven't responded to that, why?<br />
PM: Well, I mean all sorts of bodies write to us about all sorts of things.<br />
IT: It's a pretty Important issue right now.<br />
PM: Oh yes, but governments can't spring to attention the moment some lobby group<br />
writes to you about something. I've got no doubt that unemployment produces<br />
stress amongst sonic people.<br />
IT: Can I give you sonmc of the figures then, that were collected by the Institute of<br />
Health and Welfare: 17 per cent higher death rates for unemployed males; 50 per<br />
cent higher number of visits to the doctor if you'rc unemployed; 37 pcr cent higher<br />
number of admissions to hospital if you're unemployed; 3.6 times more likely to<br />
have a serious stress-rclated illness if you're unemployed, but you haven't even<br />
addressed that letter from the AMA.<br />
PM:. The way to address the problem is to get people back to work. And we've<br />
addressed it in a substantial way because there's about 120,000yung poplec,<br />
15-19, who are unemployed. When I announced the Youth Package a week ago I<br />
announced 170,000 places, that is an additional number of places to bring the total<br />
to 170,000. So there are 170,000 places in those programs for 120,000 people. So<br />
the likelihood is that most young people who wish to have training or some job<br />
experiene can and will now be taken up under those schemes. So, if we're going </p>
<p>T5EL.: Aug. 92 13: 49 No. 013 P. 03/<br />

to the AMA's concern at source, It is to actually give young people job<br />
opportunities.<br />
IT: Most of these figures, though, would relate to people perhaps who have taken<br />
redundancies, thirties, forties, fifties, can't get back into the workforce.<br />
PM: I think you're talking about the young unemployed, generally.<br />
JT: No, this is overall, these are the overall figures. I mean you're not going to get a<br />
high death rate with people who are very young. I mean, stress-related illnesses<br />
that come with being out of work in your forties and fifties, it's pretty tough then.<br />
PM: Absolutely, absolutely. But in the first instance, young people are a real problem<br />
and we've tried to deal with those by simply creating enough places in the labour<br />
market pM1onams to take thenm up, and to train them, and to push home the skilled<br />
work transition. For mature aged people, we've also got now a substantial program<br />
of labour market support. We turn through about 400,000 Australians through<br />
those programs a year. And, as I said, we're looking at those in the Budget as well<br />
to see how we can Improve them so that we may be able to more. As well as that,<br />
the primary inmprovemenh would bc a discernible pick up in employment in the<br />
economy, that starts to create opportunities for people. But there's no doubt, I<br />
think, that people do lose self estccni and they worry.<br />
JT, Do you blame them?<br />
PM: No, not at all. And that's why thc quicker we get back to growth the better. But<br />
the only way to long tcrm jobs is simply growth. Now the economy is growing<br />
now. We've had 1.5 per cent growth for the three quarters of the last financial<br />
year. We're just waiting now on the Junc Quarter accounts, so that will give us a<br />
picture for the full year to June, that's last financial year. And I think it will<br />
probably bc growing somewhere around 1.7 2 per cent. That being the ease,<br />
we're growing as fast or faster than West European economies. And in the coming<br />
year, this is the finiancial year we're now in, we expect to be growing of the order<br />
of about 4 per cent. Now that being the case, we'll actually be growing faster than<br />
the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and most other places. But the problem<br />
with a lot of this is that you get'more output for fewer people. In other words, in<br />
the first phase of a recovery there is more productivity, the system is more<br />
productive.<br />
iT: And fewer jobs,<br />
PM: -And fewer jobs. So, there's a lag before employment catches up again with the<br />
growth. That's the position we're In now, we're living through that lag.<br />
IT: OK, just still on health, though, and just a quick aside really, but why have you<br />
doubled the price of the pill for pensioners?<br />
TEL: </p>
<p>TEL: 5. Aug. 92 13: 49 No. 013 R. 04/.<br />

PM: Which pill?<br />
iT: ' Me contraceptivc Dill.<br />
PM: rye got no Idea about it. 11ms things are donc by the National Health and<br />
Medical Research Council.<br />
JT': $ 2.60 to $ 5.08, it's doubled in price.<br />
PM: Well, in the end drugs have somc reflection of their cost. We have a free list of<br />
drg for pensioners, that Is a diminished price way below the commercial price.<br />
Of course, everyone argues that every drug that ever came Into existence should be<br />
on that list. What goes on that list is recommended to the government by I think<br />
the National Health and Medical Research Council.<br />
IT: OK. Getting onto wider issues, Joan Kirncr is she going to win the next election?<br />
PM: Well I don't know, but we'll soon see though, won't we?<br />
IT: Do you think she's got a chance?<br />
PM: She's got a battle, I think she knows that. But she's doing her best.<br />
JT:. What support are you giving her, though? I mean she's not too happy about fiscal<br />
equalisation remaining, is she?<br />
PM: Yes, she kicked a goal at thc Premiers' Conference. She said that the money that<br />
was being paid to Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia was unfair on<br />
Victoria. That the reason fiscal cqualisation in part was there was because New<br />
South Wales and Victoria enjoy the protection of the tariff. As the tariff has come<br />
down, the argument therefore for fiscal equalisation had enieliarated, and therefore<br />
It was unfair that Victoria should subsidisc everybody else to the tune that they<br />
were now doing. We said, wcll there is no doubt that the formula, as Is now<br />
constructed, is working to increase the payments out of Victoria and New South<br />
Wales, and We'll examine it. So we've now got a rcvicw on the methodology, not<br />
the principle because I actually believe in the principlc of fiscal equalisation.<br />
JT:. As you said yesterday, Tasi is not miqsing out. It's a good thing to say while you're<br />
in Tasis, isn't it?<br />
PM: Well, I've spent 8 years paying the chequcs over, so I did put my money where my<br />
mouth was as far as Tasmania was concerned. But, think the principlc is right,<br />
that people in the outlying States, outlying from the main population centres,<br />
should have the opportunity of services comparable with those that you obtain in<br />
New South Wales and Victoria. Joan Kirnr's complaint is that the formula, the </p>
<p>TEL: 5. Aug. 92 13: 49 NO. 013<br />
current methodology is exacerbating the trend when in fact Victoria's capacity to<br />
pay Is weakening. That's fair enoughi, so we're examining that.<br />
JT: Still when you look at what Joan Kirnier, she may miss out this time, she may go<br />
down In a scivaming heap after this election. What will that do to you, will that<br />
have any bearing whatsoever on when you go to an election?<br />
PM: No, we'll make our mind up. I think the public want value from these Parliaments,<br />
they don't want us all going carly, so to speak. And we've got plenty to do, and<br />
we've been trying to do It as quickly as we can and as effectively as we can, and<br />
we'll just keep doing that. There are a number of State elections that are going to<br />
be on, and that's just the coincidence of Parliamentary terms expiring.<br />
JT: Any likelihood of going in March?<br />
PM: T7here's no point In me speculating about election dates either, it's just pointless.<br />
IT: The climate would be right though, wouldn't it? It's summer, everybody feels<br />
pretty good, school leavcrs figures havcn't come out yet.<br />
PM: It's still summery in most of Australia way past March.<br />
JT:. Not down here it's not. Any chance of it being March, though, early in thc year?<br />
PM: No, T don't think so. My thinking would be we would take the Parliament to its<br />
logical conclusion, and we'vc done that a number of times. I mean it's a very<br />
chequcred history, Australian Parliaments, they don't run their full three years<br />
often but It Just depends on the conditions.<br />
iT: Well, conditions are pretty grim, it's going to be tough for you to go any time, isn't<br />
it?<br />
PM:. But the economy is picking up, growth is coming through.<br />
JT. You're going to Bernie later today, thcre's been a suggestion that if you ease back<br />
on tariffs for APPM, because tariff cuts alone between 1989-1997 will cost APPM<br />
more than $ 300 million, that's $ 6U million a year. Now, is there any way of giving<br />
Bcrnie a break, because it's on its knees at the moment?<br />
PM: I think everybody, the whole country has paid through the nose with tariffs. I<br />
mean, people forget that. And we've reduced tariffs since 1998, gradually. To<br />
give an example, a standard Falcon car today is $ 23,000, it would have been<br />
$ 33,000 had the tariff cuts not come through. Tariffs are basically a tax on<br />
ordinary Australians. In the public dcbate it's not as brutally understood as that.<br />
It's essentially a tax everyone pays for the protection of these industries. Now, to </p>
<p>TEL: 5. Rug. 92 13: 49 No. 013 P<br />
6<br />
make Australia more competitive we have reduced It. But I shouldn't believe that<br />
APPM's problems are tariff problems, or tariff problems exclusively.<br />
iT: $ 600 million, though, that could go Into buying quite a lot of plant and equipment.<br />
PM: Well, who's number is that? That's their number. The fact of the matter is, some<br />
of these companies have been not as well managed as they should have been, not<br />
as productive as they should have been, and they're now making productivity<br />
changes as the market requires them to make, and a simple explanation that this is<br />
all because of tariff changes Is, I don't think, correct.<br />
JT: Where then has APPM gone wrong in Bernie?<br />
PM: I don't know, but Australian Newsprint Mills is reforming itself just In the same<br />
way as APPM is required to reform itself, but without the brouhaha and the<br />
heartache which has accompanied changes at APPM. So, I mean they're both<br />
doing the samec thing, one's doing it obviously more successfully than the other.<br />
JT: You've given tariff breaks, though, for the sugar industry and other industries like<br />
that. Isn't there a chane that just to help out thc people in Bernie, that this time<br />
APPM needs a break?<br />
PM: We're not dispensing tariff breaks, but what wc're not doing is taking tariffs to<br />
zero. What my friend Dr l-ewson is about is taking the whole structure to zero.<br />
Now we've still got in there 35 per cent, even at the end points, and that's 1997,<br />
per cent for clothing, textile and footwear, 15 for motor cars, 5 for general<br />
manufacturing. He is arguing for zero for everything. So I don't think that for<br />
Instance, a car Industry would survive at zero, it will survive at 15, sections of<br />
clothing, textile and footwear, which is well represented in this State, won't<br />
survive at zero but may survive at 20, 15 and 35, and the end point on papcr<br />
products is also not zero, I'm not sure what it Is but it's not zero. Can I just say that<br />
the largest change In tariffs in the last year in the phase downs came in clothing,<br />
textile and footwear. It changed by 3 per cent. But the exchange rate has<br />
depreciatcd this year by 8 per cent. So the protection afforded by the exchange<br />
rate, that is when the exchange rate depreciates then it adds extra protection, the<br />
protection afforded by the exchange rate changed at 8 per cent is more than 2 1/ 2<br />
times the reduction In the tariff. So complaints by paper manufacturers that at the<br />
moment the tariff is actually hurting them is nonsense because the exchange rate is<br />
more than compensating for a tariff change.<br />
IT: OK, so you're going to Bernie today empty handed?<br />
PM, Well I'm not going out there to dispense goodies, no.<br />
JT: So there will be no relief at all for Bcrnie, no special dispensation, nothing that you<br />
can do for Bernie? </p>
<p>TEL: 5. Aug. 92 13: 49 No. 013 P. 07,<br />
7<br />
FM: It's not a matter of relief, rm just visiting the town. As far as I know the company<br />
has said that to get to a level of competitiveness thcy believe Is important, they<br />
think a number of people, a couple of hundred people have got to be either over<br />
time not replaced..<br />
JT: 400, actually, 400 in a year.<br />
PM: Well they said 400, which would either be through non replacement or<br />
redundancies, or maybe that number doesn't need to go if in some way they can<br />
run the plant more productively. So obviously think there is a point of discussion<br />
there for the employers and the unions about how that plant can run more<br />
productively to obviate the need for people to leave,<br />
IT: 0OC, so Bernie can expect an empty handed PM to visit today?<br />
PM: I don't think Prime Ministers should be running around writing cheques out. I<br />
mean, wandering around saying what Is your problcem, please sit down and I'll<br />
write you a cheque. That's not the way goverrnent in this country runs.<br />
if: So you won't give $ 4 million to a footy club?<br />
PM: Well, leavc that to one side, and thc fact is one has to, I think as a government,<br />
articulate rational, sensible, long term policies and we're doing that. And all the<br />
Issues In competitiveness which affect this company, likc wages, and we've got an<br />
Inflation rate now of 1.5 per cent, we've got a competitive exchange rate<br />
mechanism, we've had a depreciation of the exchange rate recently.<br />
if: If people haven't got a job then they're not interested in those figures.<br />
PM: But it's for the company, you're making a claim on behalf of the company that it<br />
needs support. ANl I'm saying to you is that it's had morc support than it could<br />
have likely expected from the Government in the hardest thing to dcliver low<br />
inflation, a competitive exchange rate. For a company like that they're the things<br />
that It needs, and they're the things that wc've given It.<br />
JT: Anothcr issue here is Benders Quarry. What are YOU going to do about that, close<br />
it down?<br />
PM: I'm not surc. I think that our view is tha~ t there should be no more damage to the<br />
cave structure of this area by explosions and the rest, and we've been assured by<br />
the Premier, by the Government of TFasmania, that they won't permiit any further<br />
detonations or damage, and that what we're looking at in thc short term in some<br />
relocation assistance for the company.<br />
IT: So the last blast will not take place? </p>
<p>TEL: 5. Aug. 92 13: 49 No .013 F'. 08/ 1<br />
PNS Well, that's what Wre told.<br />
JTs Will the funds, though, to relocate it come out of world<br />
heritage funds?<br />
PI: I'm not sure what the funding source will be, but I don't<br />
think we've talking about gigantic amounts here. Some of the<br />
relocation assistance we can handle one way or the other.<br />
MT Just move on now to listeners' questions and we asked'<br />
listeners to phone in yesterday with some questions so that we<br />
could sort of go through them and sort out the wheat from the<br />

ntroducing national service?<br />
PX; Sorry, decreasing?<br />
MT Decreasing the amount of unemployment by introducing<br />
national service,<br />
PM Well the question implies that there'sa some sort of a<br />
penalty, that people are unemployed because they don't want to do<br />
anything. That is if one threatens them with national service<br />
they might get themselves employed. And I think that's very<br />
unfair. I mean Australia is going through a cyclical, has been<br />
through a cyclical recession and is going through structural<br />
change. And we've got cyclical unemployment and we've got<br />
unemployment coming from the structure of change in the economy.<br />
This is not the fault of the people who are unemployed. And it's<br />
unfair I think to say to them that they can quickly employ<br />
themselves otherwise we'll shove them in the army. I mean I don't<br />
accept that. I think society has got a responsibility to support<br />
people who the economic system has made unemployed or redundant.<br />
And the way to help them is to teach them new skills so they can<br />
go back into the labour market. And that's exactly what the<br />
government is doing.<br />
JT: No more nasho then?<br />
PM: No. No more nasho.<br />
JTs Another fellow phoned in and said I'm sixty one, I have been<br />
unemployed for twelve months, I've been hassled by the CBS and<br />
the DSS during this period. I would like to know is there a<br />
future policy in respect to the age group fifty five to sixty<br />
five being able to take earlyr_ retirement and get an _ gLnsioq_._<br />
Pi'i well to get an age pension, no. But fifty five is the age<br />
where superannuation benefits are treed under the preservation<br />
rules. But it is harder obviously for older people to when they<br />
are unemployed to get back into the workforce. And obviously </p>
<p>TEL: 5. Aug. 92 13: 49 No. 013 P. 09/.'<br />
I<br />
there needs to be some real buoyancy in the economy and the<br />
labour market before that can ha ppen. But we are seeing just in<br />
the various technical and further education colleges, I was<br />
yesterday at the TAPE at Clarence, and we are seeing quite a<br />
number of mature age people going back to learn new skills so<br />
they can f ind their way back into the labour market. But it to<br />
harder. JTt Wihy do all parties still speak of growth when everyone knows<br />
that our world is finite?<br />
PM: Well this comes from so~ ebody who's never had to handle a<br />
low growth economy. And it's very difficult I think to well<br />
almost at this stage impossible to run an economic s ystem with<br />
employment without growth. Otherwise we've got to find new wiya<br />
of distributing wealth and obviously the wealth will be<br />
diminishing as the growth is diminishing. Now I believe that you<br />
can have growth and you can at the same time protect the<br />
environment which I think is the point of the question. And you<br />
can have it by the sort of services which are now proliferating,<br />
which are environment friendly. Tourism for instance which is a<br />
large employer, a labour intensive industry, is an<br />
environmentally friendly industry, it's not a smoke stack<br />
industry. it's not a polluter. And all manner of other services.<br />
I mean I noticed yesterday at the same TAFE college I was talking<br />
about students coming in from abroad paying full fees. Solling<br />
education services is growth. But again it's a non-polluter. So<br />
we're having, and even in the industrial production we're seeing,<br />
you know, a much cleaner sorts of Industrial structures today<br />
than we saw years ago. so one shouldn't assume therefore that we<br />
have to go to zero growth or to contract to sort of save the<br />
environment. I think what we've got to do is keep that happy<br />
balance between the environment and growth and the needs of<br />
people for a job.<br />
MT How serious are you about keeping our land, our companies<br />
and our assets in Australian hands when you have taken all the<br />
teeth out of the foreign investment r. eview board and the<br />
Australian Securitiei7 Commission?<br />
PM: Well teeth implies that you've got to bite people you see.<br />
And the question sort of has the penalty notion. You've got to<br />
exact a penalty on people. We've developed this place, this<br />
country of ours in the last two hundred years by relying on<br />
someone else's capital. Capital we never had. In the first<br />
instance it was British capital and British industry which<br />
invested here and gave us the chance to develop this country. And<br />
this is still true. This is a large continent. We don't have a<br />
savings base and an investment pool adequate at this stage to<br />
fund our needs, and so foreign investors come and buy assets and<br />
they bring technologies and often they bring businesses. This I<br />
think's a good thing.-And you know you see this ebb and flow. Z </p>

mean there wag A time, let Me give YOU An OXAMPle, not int<br />
Australia but there was a time when during the OPEC one and two<br />
oil rice shocks when the income of the Arab states rose sharply,<br />
so they then amongst other things bought a stack of real estate<br />
in Britain, in London, and what have you. It's largely now all<br />
been sold. Similarly the Japanese in the eighties bought real<br />
estate all round the world. They're now largely selling it.,<br />
.7Ts Well they have to.<br />
PX1 Well that's right. So I mean I don't know why people worry.<br />
I mean we've got to fund the current account deficit some way. So<br />
it either comes with debt or-It comes with equity.<br />
So if you say no to equity and no to foreign investment it just<br />
means that Australians somewhere have got to borrow more debt.<br />
JTs Have YOU any idea though how much land is owned by foreign<br />
investors? IPM: No there's no land register. But in my eight, years as<br />
Treasurer the amount of purchases by foreigners of Australian<br />
open space land wae quite small. I don't think it's a problem at<br />
all. JTs NOxt question. With the differing wage stru~ cturea between<br />
Australia and South Cast Asia our main manufacturing competitor,<br />
the COst of production in Australia, the cost of production is I<br />
should say, nkneteen times greater than those in south east Asia.<br />
How then does the PM expect Australian manufacturers to become<br />
competitive with this millstone around their necks. Are they to<br />
slash wages or move production off shore and import?<br />
PM Neither. They are to produce the right forts of things. That<br />
is we should be investing in our creativity, in our brains and<br />
selling innovative products that would attract a premium and not<br />
trying to compete with the countries that make things, employ<br />
people at seven and ten dollars a week. Now that's what Dr Rewson<br />
wants to do. What he wants to do is cut the wage of Australians<br />
so that we can compete with these low-wage countries for lowvalue<br />
products. What we're trying to do is to educate<br />
Australians, take them through secondary school, tertiary<br />
institutions, TAFE, so that we can produce innovative products<br />
that sell in--teee markets at a premium. And that's now<br />
happening. You know we're seeing the likes of Telecom Australia<br />
moving strongly through Indonesia, Malaysia# all these countries<br />
to our near north. We're seeing lots of companies in the service<br />
area, civil engineering construction services going there because<br />
they don't have them. Education, educationalists and education<br />
services. These are things which you don't have to compete seven<br />
dollars or ten dollars a week for, So the clever thing to do is,<br />
to make certain that the comparative advantage Australia now has<br />
in education is continued. And not to do the dumb thing which as 1. 4 </p>

to mature people, we'll out you back to three quarters of average<br />
weekly earnings and then you might be able to compote making<br />
shirts with the Indonesians or somebody else. The truth of the<br />
matter is we ought to be making things that attract a premium<br />
Where we put our creativity and our brains into the product and<br />
Where we invest in our greatest resource which is our own people.<br />
JM If we are concerned about four hundred job looses at AP?) I<br />
that is less than two days of imiLgration. I don't know if those<br />
figures are right actually. Should we not be taking in only<br />
Immigrants with guaranteed job tenure?<br />
PM: Well the migration program has been a source of great<br />
strength to the' Austrailan economy. We've had workcforce growth in<br />
this country with migration of about one int six to two percent<br />
a year, Which means if you're an Austrafioan business if you do<br />
nothing but grow your business naturally it should be growing one<br />
point six or two percent a year as the population grows. Whereas<br />
if you're a European business and you ve got static population<br />
growth you've got to actually take someone else's market share to<br />
grow, You've got to take the market share of another business.<br />
You've got to take it of f themi to grow. So migration has been a<br />
source of economic growth and strength to Australia. And the<br />
Srogram is essentially a long-term one. Now we can vary it and we<br />
ave quite substantially. we were taking a hundred and forty<br />
thousand people a year in two years ago. We're now taking about<br />
eighty thousand a year in. Just over eighty thousand a year in.<br />
And that I think comprehends the fact that the labour market is<br />
under stress and it's therefore more difficult to accommodate<br />
migrants as well as Australians. But the problem is if you wind<br />
the program down less than that it'd take years to wind it up<br />
And if you look at the late 1980s when we had shortages of skill;,<br />
in demand, tradesporsons, qualified people where the labour<br />
market threatened to blow inflation apart again, the migration<br />
program helped to complement our labour market, 6o one has to<br />
take a medium term view of it. And governments should basicly<br />
keep the program and adjust it for the contemporary condition of<br />
the economy. Which is what we've done.<br />
JTs Do you think Bob Hawke will ever rue the day he said that<br />
all those Chinese students could stay here? And nlow you've had to<br />
clamp down on them bringing in families and going Into the<br />
marriage arrangements.<br />
PM1: Oh I don't know what his view of it is now. It's just one of<br />
those things, a contingency which arose because of the Tianenmen<br />
Square thing.<br />
JT: Do you think emotion though took priority there instead of </p>
<p>T5EL.: Rug. 92 13: 49 No. 013 P.. 12/.<br />
12<br />
rational thought?<br />
PM1 Well it was considered. It was considered at Cabinet level.<br />
Oh, it's something we can handle. We can handle it. I mean you'll<br />
always got People trying to * xploit the system I Suppose. And<br />
whatever they try we try and check them.<br />
JTs Quickly then on to another couple of questions because we ' ve<br />
got a very short amount of time. Given the youth job summit will<br />
the PX be making money available to the community groups ' that<br />
Work with and on behalf of the unemployed?<br />
U1s ' Well we try and support certainly the volun~ tary agencies. We<br />
gave them the One Nation package a substantial increase to the St<br />
Vincent de Paul, the Salvation Army and those sorts of people.<br />
But I think this question Is a question from the welfare industry<br />
employees, the people who work In it.<br />
Well and again we ye treated them well over the period. But T<br />
think the primary concern now is with their clients# not with<br />
them, You know, with the unemployed themselves. I mean it should<br />
be remembered, people tend to think with unemployment now that<br />
sort of the gains of the eighties have been lout. That's not<br />
true. You see in 1983 when 1; became Treasurer we had a work~ orce<br />
Of Six Million, Today we've got a workforce of seven point five<br />
million. It's a quarter bigger.<br />
JTi Yes but there was two hundred thousand roughly unemployed<br />
When you came in and now it's a million.<br />
PM. N4o no. No no, No that's not true. There were six hundred<br />
thousand. Six or seven hundred thousand. It's just not growing.<br />
But we've largely kept the employment. The place is twenty five<br />
percent larger in size. The economy itself when I became<br />
Treasurer In 1983 the total size of the economy# that's gross<br />
domestic product, the production of the Country was two hundred<br />
billion. This year it's four hundred and twenty five billion. So,<br />
and inflation was ten and a half percent and now it's one and a<br />
half. Imean thera are great gains there. We've had a great shift<br />
to manufacturing which we didn't have in the early eighties. But<br />
with the slow growth, the negative growth of the last year or so<br />
we've lost the growth in employment and we've got to get that<br />
back, But as we get it back we can just consolidate those<br />
eighties changes and gains and move them into the nineties. So<br />
people shouldn't be too forlorn about this. It's a matter of<br />
trying to get the economy growing again and once we do we will as<br />
I said there'll be a lag in the first instance and then that<br />
employment response should come through.<br />
M~ And talking about being forlorn the last question, tongue in<br />
cheek I would imagine from a listener. Are you any relation. to<br />
the Hobart undertaking firm of Pearce and Keating?<br />
TEL: </p>
<p>TEL: 5. Aug. 92 13: 49 No. 013 P. 13/ 1<br />
PM. Never heard of them. Never heard of them. But they must, the<br />
Keating family are spread all round the place buit I rarely find<br />
any of us related, We or* obviously somewhere back there. They're<br />
a&amp; I black Irish of course.<br />
JTs i thinkX it might be through come of the caricatures making<br />
you the undertaker. I don't think it was really a serious<br />
question. It was interesting to read Laurie Oakep today saying<br />
ou're becoming the now warm and fuzzy PM now to try and got away<br />
from Hewson's what has been depicted as a fairly cold image. Axe<br />
you becoming a new warma and fuzzy PM?<br />
MK in the 1980# one of the probleme about the Treasury and the<br />
Treasurer's job is that the social policy we're all involved with<br />
becomes the product of someone else. But all the things which I<br />
vas involved with such as Medicare, the family allowance<br />
supplement, the provision of occupational superannuation in the<br />
workforce, childcare, aged care, the home and community care<br />
program, the hostel program, the changed basis of geriatric<br />
asesment, increases in basic rate pensions, the child support<br />
agency through the Tax Office these are all things I was well<br />
involved in. But that's not comprehended I don't think in the<br />
debate. And people tend to think now when I'm out there<br />
supporting those things that in some way I've changed my tune.<br />
Many of those are there because I was involved with them. And to<br />
I've always believed that society can only move along together<br />
that we can't have a thing which is a survival of the fittest<br />
policy. If you're not a millionaire you're a layabout, you know<br />
this is the sort of iNewson deal. If you're not a millionaire<br />
you're not working and the state owes you nothing. Well I think<br />
people have got a right of access to health care. They have got a<br />
right of access to education. They've got a right of access to<br />
support in their old age. And those policies I've supported and<br />
I'm not going to be cast in a position where people say well<br />
because you introduced an open market economy into Australia in<br />
the 1980s you're like Dr Hewson. I'm~ not like Dr Hewson. I mean<br />
he is a clinical technician and good on him. If that's what he<br />
wants to be fine. I'm not. I'm in there looking after the broad<br />
group of the community as I always have.<br />
JT: Paul ) Xuating thank you very much indeed for your time this<br />
morning. PH: Thank you very much.<br />
