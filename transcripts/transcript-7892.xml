Within 3 months, and many pundits are predicting sooner<br />
rather than later, Australia must vote in what' s shaping<br />
up as the closest Federal election in years. So<br />
Sunday's first studio guest in this important year is<br />
the Prime Minister. With better trade figures, easing<br />
interest rates, and the longterm Labor leadership again<br />
being discussed much to talk about. Here to talk with<br />
Mr Hawke is Alan Ramsay of The Sydney Morning Herald, as<br />
well as Sunday's political editor Laurie Oakes.<br />
OAKES: Mr Hawke, welcome again to Sunday.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Thank you very much Laurie.<br />
OAKES: The Macquarie Radio Network has been reporting<br />
this morning that you are going to announce on this<br />
program today the date of the elections. Here's your<br />
chance. PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Thanks. ( amusement all round)<br />
OAKES: You're not going to take it up?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: No, no, I think I'll see the<br />
Governor General first.<br />
OAKES: And when will you do that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: When I think it's appropriate,<br />
Laurie.<br />
OAKES: Well can I ask you this: Parliament is<br />
scheduled to meet on Tuesday week.<br />
PRIME : MINISTER HAWKE: Um ( affirmative noise)<br />
OAKES: Will the Parliament meet then? Are you going to<br />
do that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well, if I answered that question<br />
one way or the other it would give you some sort of an<br />
answer to the timetable. I'm not going to make any </p>
<p>announcement about the timing of the election until I<br />
think it's appropriate, Laurie, either directly or<br />
indirectly.<br />
OAKES: That refusal leaves open an election on the 17<br />
March? PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: I suppose hypothetically it does.<br />
OAKES: Do you want to leave that open?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well, I just... um... am not going<br />
to deviate from what I said to a number of pressing<br />
inquirers. None of them is sort of devious as you or<br />
clever as you Laurie, in trying to get there, but it's<br />
the same answer. I'll make my announcement when I'm<br />
ready to.<br />
OAKES: But you said a few weeks ago that Parliament<br />
would sit?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well, it will have to sit<br />
sometime, won't it?<br />
RAMSAY: Prime Minister, if we can try another way.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Yes.<br />
RAMSAY: the climate has improved for the<br />
Government lately...<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Yes<br />
RAMSAY: and your opponents seem to be doing all they<br />
can to help you. Is it tempting although we're only<br />
talking about 3 months is it tempting to go soon<br />
rather than later?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: I ' spose the honest answer must<br />
be that when they are making just a mess of things, I<br />
think that what's really happening, Alan, is that<br />
they're revealing... ar... what people knew about them;<br />
that is, they hadn't done their work. And as that<br />
becomes more apparent I suppose there's some temptation.<br />
But you've got to take a whole range of things into<br />
account. Quite... quite clearly the... er... this<br />
Parliament is, in everyone's judgement, now run its<br />
term. So any time between now and May is acceptable.<br />
Now, there hasn't been a Prime Minister, I guess, in </p>
<p>history who won't operate on the basis that he'll chose<br />
the time which he thinks he can maximise the opportunity<br />
of.. of.. of victory, and that's what I'll do.<br />
OAKES: Your momentum seems to have stalled in the<br />
last few days, as a result of Senator Button's comments<br />
on... on this alleged deal for the succession......<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: I don't feel that judgement. I<br />
mean I made it quite clear that Senator Button didn't<br />
know what he was talking about. And I think in this<br />
sort of.. er.. context, the electorate will say that the<br />
Prime Minister probably knows more about his intentions<br />
than Senator Button does. I mean, that's so obvious that<br />
it hardly requires any more conversation, I think.<br />
OAKES: But what is it about John Button. I mean this<br />
is not the first time, far from it, that he's<br />
embarrassed you with this sort of frank comment. Why<br />
does he enjoy this sort of immunity? Is it because<br />
he.. er.. his role in planting the knife in Bill Hayden<br />
all those years ago?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Oh, I don't know about planting<br />
a knife. That's your assessment, not mine. But John is<br />
one of the foreleaders, he's leader of the Government<br />
in the Senate. I guess he feels that in that role he<br />
has a little bit more... discretion. I'm not sure that<br />
he's always used it as wisely as he might, but my<br />
relations with Senator Button are good. I mean, let's<br />
when we're talking about John Button, understand that<br />
he's been an outstanding Minister for Industry.<br />
Absolutely outstanding. And I value his contribution to<br />
this Government enormously.<br />
OAKES: Seriously, though, despite what you're saying<br />
for election reasons, we've got to expect, haven't we,<br />
that Paul Keating will become leader sometime in the<br />
next term if you win? You've got to make the changeover<br />
sometime? PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Become leader in the next term?<br />
OAKES: If you win. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well, I believe we'll win. And<br />
I've also said that I will remain leader for the whole<br />
of the term. Now, I'm not going to change that<br />
statement.<br />
OAKES: If there's no chance of becoming leader, then<br />
why is Paul Keating there in the tabloids every day with<br />
his kids, engaging in all that fairy floss that in the<br />
past he's refused to be part of?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well, you'll have to ask Paul<br />
that. But....<br />
OAKES: He clearly wants to be leader...<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well.. er.. he has made no secret<br />
of the fact, but the question is of time.<br />
And.. ah.. after I've, as I say, hopefully, and I believe<br />
I will, have the led the party to victory in this coming<br />
election, I'll take it through the full term. Then the<br />
er.. party will be in the fortunate position<br />
of.. ah.. having there a person in Paul Keating who wants<br />
to be leader, who has eminent capacities for that job.<br />
But that will be.... and that timetable that I'm talking<br />
about. And to the extent that he is showing his human<br />
face, that's no more than I've suggested for a long time<br />
that he should do, because as you know, both of you, he<br />
has very great human qualities which.. er.. are not always<br />
apparent because he's seen as the tough, hard,<br />
calculating Treasurer. But underneath that there's a<br />
very warm human being.<br />
RAMSAY: Prime Minister, back in 1983 you were asked<br />
you had been Prime Minister 3 or 4 months and you were<br />
asked how long you'd like to remain Prime Minister, and<br />
you said 3 terms.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Um ( affirmative noise)<br />
RAMSAY: And that if you couldn't do in 3 terms what you<br />
wanted to do, then you thought it was reasonable then to<br />
get out and give somebody else a go. Now, why do you<br />
now not take your own advice?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well.. ah.. 3 terms, you've got to </p>
<p>remember the first term was rather short, where you had<br />
the election in March of ' 83 and the next election was<br />
the end of ' 84. Um.. and.. ah.. these things ought to be<br />
said now, that.. ah.. the party clearly wants me to stay<br />
as leader. And if I can say so, modestly as far as the<br />
polls are concerned, the people want me as leader. And<br />
I must say I've never felt fitter physically, or more on<br />
top mentally. And I'm a better leader now than I was<br />
when I started; by definition, I mean, you'd be a fool<br />
if you weren't. So if you take all those things<br />
together I think.. ah.. ah.. it adds up to doing this next<br />
term. RAMSAY: Only one extra term?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Oh, I think so, Alan, yeah.<br />
OAKES: Why are you so sensitive about this succession<br />
question? Is Paul Keating really that much on the nose<br />
that you.. you..<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: I mean, I would have thought that<br />
if you.. if you just played the reel which showed Hawke<br />
absolutely relaxed about this issue, and a couple of<br />
interviewers who seem to be agitated about it,<br />
not sensitive, I'm totally relaxed about it.<br />
You know my relations with Paul are excellent...<br />
OAKES: But do you think that if.. if people believed he<br />
would become leader in the next term, that the Labor<br />
party would suffer electorally?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well, I see that that's written,<br />
and that's why of course.. er.. an Opposition which is<br />
devoid itself of policies, who can only reveal its own<br />
ineptitude, is trying to divert attention from those<br />
facts by asserting what isn't true; that is, that if<br />
you vote for Bob Hawke, it's really a vote for Paul<br />
Keating. Now there are 2 things about that: one, as I<br />
say, it shows an attempt on their part that they can't<br />
talk about their own policy positions, they've got to<br />
divert. And of course it's... I must say it's a<br />
backhanded compliment to me, and I thank Andrew for it. </p>
<p>RAMSAY: Prime Minister, assuming Peter Dowding, the<br />
West Australian Premier, gets the chop tomorrow, you're<br />
not going to be displeased, are you? It's going to help<br />
you over in Western Australia in the coming election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well, Alan, ( couple of unclear<br />
words) when I went to Western Australia during the week,<br />
it was a very difficult situation for me because there<br />
move was on for. . ah. . replacement of Peter. I<br />
tried really to.. to be as standoff as far as I could<br />
from that. I was asked a question about.. ah. . Carmen<br />
Lawrence. I answered what I had to about her in terms<br />
of my truthful understanding of her, ah. . what I know of<br />
her, ah. . answered that. But it's a matter for them.<br />
If.. if that happens, um.. indications seem to be that it<br />
may happen, well I guess the people of Western<br />
Australian will have some different perception<br />
about.. ah. the state Government there. I guess that's<br />
right. I mean it would be silly for me to deny that.<br />
RAMSAY: And you would gain from a Carmen Lawrence<br />
honeymoon? Is that what you're saying?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well, I'm not. . ah. . putting it<br />
that way. But, wouldn't it be silly for me to get up<br />
and try and say to two blokes like you who follow<br />
politics closely, who know that the indications are that<br />
the state Government over there is not looking too<br />
brilliant, to try and say to you, now if there's a<br />
change of leadership that may not be a plus. I mean,<br />
I'm not going to be as silly as that; I think it<br />
probably will be a plus, but I can't put<br />
myself, and I'm not going to put myself in a position of<br />
being part of that process over there. I mean, that is<br />
for the state parliamentary Labor party....<br />
RAMSAY: Well, the Victorian Labor party isn't looking<br />
too flash either. Does the same thing apply to them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: No it isn't,<br />
absolutely. . analogy there, I think, and<br />
again there'Is no suggestion, as f ar as. er. er. Victoria </p>
<p>concerned, as far as I know, that.. er.. wanted it<br />
changed, their leadership there. I haven't seen or<br />
heard anything to that effect.<br />
RAMSAY: No, but aren't the same sort problems besetting<br />
the John Cain Government down in Victoria, the same sort<br />
of problems that they've got over in Western Australia?<br />
Allegations and.. and persistent and continuing<br />
allegations of economic mismanagement?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Oh.. I think they're somewhat<br />
different. Let.. let me say this at any rate, I mean,<br />
the important point as far as I'm concerned if this<br />
Alan, and Laurie, that, and I made the point while I was<br />
in Perth, that.. er.. you've got to take a rather peculiar<br />
view of your viewer ordinary Mr and Mrs Australia to<br />
believe that.. um.. we're going to be punished, or<br />
punished in any significant way, for some perception on<br />
the part of the West Australian voter, or a Victorian<br />
voter, that they don't like something that the state<br />
Governments have done. I mean, it means, as I said in<br />
Western Australia, that people are unintelligent, are<br />
masochist, that they're going to say: we know that this<br />
election is about Federal issues, and I'm going to vote<br />
to give myself the abolition of Medicare and all that's<br />
involved in the nonsense of the.. er.. Opposition on<br />
health.. OAKES: But Prime Minister...<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: on education. I'm going to do<br />
that, I'm going to punish myself.. er.. by.. to.. to punish<br />
Dowding or Cain.<br />
OAKES: ( overtalk gabble) people in Queensland will<br />
vote for you because they like Wayne Goss. The<br />
Opposition must...<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: I believe there is simply no<br />
analogy there. Let me make the point in regard to<br />
Queensland, as I have to others who have raised this<br />
point, that in.. ah.. ah.. Western Australia, Laurie, and<br />
Victoria, there is not and never has been any suggestion </p>
<p>of venality, or corruption. None whatsoever. Whereas<br />
in Queensland, what you were faced with was a generation<br />
of conservative corruption. There's no analogy<br />
whatsoever. OAKES: Except over in Western Australia. I mean,<br />
you're well aware, some of your people say, federal<br />
people have been giving it an ubdulong ( phonetic) there<br />
lately simply because the climate against Labor is so<br />
strong. PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: The climate against the state<br />
Labor Government.. er.. er.. was not, was not good, and<br />
there's been some perception that a change of leadership<br />
would be helpful. I considered that earlier in the<br />
program, yeah.<br />
OAKES: Prime Minister, interest rates.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Yep.<br />
OAKES: Can home buyers expect mortgage relief soon?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well, I'm not going to dodge the<br />
question or answer, but I must give, you know, a preface<br />
to my answer, that I have to be extraordinarily careful<br />
in anything I say in this, because I don't want to be<br />
saying something which of itself can influence the money<br />
market. But let me, with that preface Laurie, make<br />
these points, briefly. Ah.. interest rates, as you know,<br />
have been kept high by us under Government policy, with<br />
tight fiscal policy and tight wages policy, because the<br />
simple statistic, and let me put it this way: last<br />
year.. er.. we.. er.. er.. we consumed about 4% more than we<br />
produced. There was about an 8% increase in<br />
consumption, 4% increase in production, and that gap<br />
more imports. Now we can't keep on doing that, so high<br />
interest rates to slow things down. Now, it has been<br />
evident, recently, that those policies have been<br />
working, therefore, the change which has seen a<br />
reduction in the cash rates and the bill rates, and<br />
obviously mortgage rates, are related to what the banks<br />
themselves have to pay for their working capital. Now, </p>
<p>the conditions are there for a reduction in mortgage<br />
rates, but when that is made will be a decision by the<br />
banks in the light of any further changes that may take<br />
place in the level of the cash rates and the associated<br />
bill rates. I think the conditions are there for it,<br />
and obviously the market, if you look at the<br />
relationship between the 90 day bill rate and the cash<br />
rate, the market is expecting that situation to occur.<br />
RAMSAY: Prime Minister, how to you get people to<br />
believe you? How do you convince people that.. er.. it's<br />
not all a fiddle? That they're going to ease the<br />
conditions before the election and then as soon as the<br />
election is over, and if you win, up they go again.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well there it's very easy. I<br />
mean, don't depend upon me, look at what the market's<br />
saying. The market has been saying, the whole range of<br />
analysists, in fact they were ahead of us, a lot of them<br />
were saying: look you should be easing them now. We<br />
were the ones who really waited. So the markets have<br />
er.. have er.. validated by their comments and by their<br />
actions, the policy decision that we've taken.<br />
OAKES: Prime Minister we'll take a break there. We'll<br />
be back in just a moment.<br />
OAKES: Welcome back. Prime Minister, 6 months ago on<br />
this program you said that because of the budget surplus<br />
tax cuts could again be on the agenda in the next round<br />
of wage negotiations with the ACTU. Now those<br />
negotiations are under way, can we still expect more tax<br />
cuts? PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well, it's obviously.. er. . er.. and<br />
that'll be on the agenda. And.. er.. we are in the<br />
fortunate position, I mean, well I can say to your<br />
viewers, well, look, don't speculate about what we might<br />
do, look we've been there for 6 years, and on each<br />
occasion we've been able to negotiate with the ACTU and<br />
then have confirmed by the Commission an arrangement </p>
<p>which means, in essence, that is distinct from the past,<br />
under the conservatives, where the cost of employment<br />
was simply loaded onto the employer and therefore onto<br />
inflation. Part of the remuneration, if you like, the<br />
total disposable income situation of employees comes<br />
about as well by a relationship of tax cuts and the<br />
social wage, so it'll be, it'll be on the table.<br />
RAMSAY: What about childcare, Prime Minister? That's<br />
going to be an issue.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well, I've talked about that,<br />
Alan, yeah, and we're in the fortunate position, as you<br />
know, of having a good story on childcare. We've more<br />
than doubled the number of places....<br />
OAKES: But the Opposition's going to... sorry Alan...<br />
RAMSAY: they're going to quadruple the spending<br />
that you've already promised.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well, errrr, I'll deal<br />
with.. er.. what the Opposition may or may not be doing in<br />
that area, at the appropriate time. But it's a fair<br />
comment, that childcare will be one of the things they<br />
will want us to look at. And we'll have some<br />
discussions with them about it.<br />
RAMSAY: And will you be making a commitment during the<br />
election campaign, on this particular issue?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: It's.. er.. one of the issues that<br />
we may be addressing. But I just want to make it clear,<br />
Alan, in regard to that or any other issue, as distinct<br />
from the Opposition, if we are making any commitments,<br />
whether it's in regard to childcare or anything else,<br />
we'll be making it absolutely clear how those things are<br />
funded, as distinct from, as you both know, the.. ah..<br />
credibility gap, fiscal gap, that the Opposition now<br />
have, which is over $ 6 billion.<br />
OAKES: Well, Prime Minister, the present wage deal<br />
doesn't expire until September. So why are you<br />
negotiating accord mark 6, 7 months ahead of time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Look, if you look back over the </p>
<p>period, you always negotiate in advance. You can't wait<br />
until the thing's I mean, what a funny...<br />
OAKES: But you'd wait until you were sure you were<br />
in Government, surely?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: But.. but that sounds like the way<br />
the Opposition do business: I mean, we haven't got a<br />
policy, we'll think about it, and then after the event,<br />
we'll then tell you we haven't got one. What you do<br />
when you're managing an economy, is you have your fiscal<br />
policy, your wages policy in place, you see that if<br />
that's going to expire in advance, you say, now what's<br />
the next step. That's what we're doing.<br />
RAMSAY: Seven months ahead of time is a long time?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well, it's not, it's not unusual<br />
in terms of what we've done in the past....<br />
RAMSAY: So it's not just the wave of a fistful of<br />
dollars in front of the voters there at election time?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: No, it's certainly isn't. I<br />
mean, it.. er. . obviously isn't. We.. er.. did a.. er.. er.. a<br />
wage tax deal last year, and you remember all the talk<br />
there was from the Opposition? That was when Howard was<br />
the leader, and the tax cuts were going to be there in<br />
front of next ( phonetic), and we gave the tax cuts last<br />
year because we were going to have an election. Now,<br />
it's a nonsense. When you're conducting economic<br />
policy, you've got to be able to let the business<br />
community know, as well as employees, what the picture<br />
is so that they can plan both in their places as<br />
consumers and employers in terms of their cost. And<br />
they need to know not on the day, they need to be able<br />
to plan in advance. Now, it's responsible for us, in<br />
the early part of 1990, to work these things out so that<br />
your viewers, in their role as wage and salary earners<br />
and in their role as employers, are going to know the<br />
economic environment in which they're operating. And<br />
it's only from the Hawke Labor that they'll know that.<br />
How in the hell would they ever know from this </p>
<p>uncoordinated, unfunded, mish-mash, which is the<br />
Opposition position.<br />
OAKES: How did your election strategies show the<br />
Coalition as knowing nothing about industrial relations;<br />
the Government is the expert in the field, the ones who<br />
can deal with the unions? That being the case, why do<br />
you keep following in the footsteps of the Opposition?<br />
I mean, now you're talking about enterprise bargaining;<br />
you're embracing that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well, it's a nice, provocative<br />
way of putting it, and you know it's not right because<br />
we have, in fact, been into this before the Opposition<br />
were talking about it. Under the Section 115 agreement,<br />
this sort of thing's been going on. Who was it that<br />
introduced.. ah.. award restructuring? It was us. We<br />
don't talk, as the other people do, as they do about<br />
health, announce yes, we're going to have a health<br />
policy, and not have it; talk about enterprise<br />
bargaining. In a gradual, evolutionary way, we have<br />
introduced the elements of enterprise bargaining under<br />
the overall umbrella of award restructuring. Because<br />
when you take the metal trades, for instance, now what<br />
did you have there? You had about 350 different<br />
classifications. We said you're going to get that down<br />
to about 8 or 9. Now you don't do that by having<br />
negotiations simply at the national level. That's then<br />
got to be reflected down in the enterprise. And that's<br />
what's been going on. We haven't been making noises<br />
about enterprise bargaining, we've been bringing it in,<br />
in an evolutionary way. But the difference, Laurie and<br />
Alan, between our action and their talk, is that at all<br />
points, the relationship between enterprise bargaining<br />
and national aggregate wage outcomes has been there,<br />
enabling us to say, this is what for the nation the<br />
aggregate wage outcome will be. You don't have the<br />
Prime Minister, when you ask him a question about<br />
outcome, doing the Andrew Peacock. When you ask the </p>
<p>crucial question at the press conference, the absolutely<br />
critical question, what's going to be aggregate wage<br />
outcome leader of the Opposition: who's to know? At<br />
least it's an appropriate response because no one would<br />
know under their position. Under ours, where you have<br />
a relationship between enterprise bargaining and the<br />
centralised system, we're able to tell employees and<br />
employers and everyone who's planning the economy, what<br />
the aggregate wages outcome is going to be.<br />
RAMSAY: Now, Prime Minister, something a bit more<br />
basic: road funding.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Yep.<br />
RAMSAY: It's become a lively issue since those 2 big,<br />
terrible bus crashes<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Yes, it has, Alan<br />
RAMSAY: How about a commitment on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Well, let me just preface the<br />
answer to that by saying what the facts are: that in<br />
our period of government, we've spent 18% more in real<br />
terms on roads than in the 7 years of the Fraser<br />
government. That's not an opinion, that's a fact. So<br />
let's... RAMSAY: We've still got a lousy road between Sydney<br />
and Brisbane.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Alan, I'm not saying that the<br />
road system is perfect, my friend. I'm simply setting<br />
the scene by saying, the fact that under the Hawke 7<br />
years of government there's been 18% more in real terms,<br />
that's almost a 1/ 4 billion more, spent on roads than by<br />
our predecessors. That doesn't mean that we've got to<br />
be complacent. Now, we will be prepared to discuss with<br />
the states this issue. I mean, I've made $ 110 million<br />
available for the black spot program, but I think most<br />
concerned people, and I hope you would agree, that we've<br />
related that to trying to get them, the states, to come<br />
in to accept national standards in regard to road<br />
safety. So we're prepared to cooperate with the states, </p>
<p>but maybe that we'll need to go further than the $ 110<br />
million that we've talked about.<br />
OAKES: Prime Minister, another issue that's arousing<br />
some heat. The question of foreign investment in<br />
commercial television networks. The.. er.. your Minister<br />
Ralph Willis has made conflicting statements, keeps<br />
moving the goal post. When's the Government finally<br />
going to make up its mind on the issue?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Um.. the Minister is having<br />
further discussions on this issue. I expect he'll be<br />
coming to us within a fortnight with some consideration,<br />
but I'm obviously not going to, even on a program which<br />
is as interested in these issues as I know this<br />
program, this station is. I not going<br />
OAKES: Well, every network's affected by this.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Sure, sure, sure. Well, er.. what<br />
we're faced with of course, as you know, in the<br />
television industry, in this country, is that because of<br />
some unreal.. um.. um.. pricing decisions that were taken,<br />
um.. the fundamental, what I believe is the fundamental<br />
health of the television, I mean, I believe we've got a<br />
magnificent television industry, fundamentally, in this<br />
country. But its capacity to operate has<br />
been.. er.. disrupted by some unreal pricing decisions,<br />
and loaded with interest burdens which are.. are.. are<br />
unreal in relation to the nature of the operation. Now,<br />
ummm.. that is.. ah.. colouring, if you like, people's<br />
perceptions about ownership, because they are saying the<br />
only we're going to be able to deal, ah, with, ah,<br />
ownership, and perhaps ownership threats, is by opening<br />
up.. ah.. ownership.. ah.. some say almost an unlimited way<br />
for owners. Now you've just got to understand in this<br />
issue that I think the Australian people, generally,<br />
have some fairly strong thoughts about how far they're<br />
prepared to have, er, their media in general and<br />
television in particular, owned overseas.<br />
RAMSAY: But do you acknowledge that by the Government </p>
<p>delaying on this decision, by procrastinating if you<br />
like, that you're helping Kerry Packer's attempt to<br />
regain the Nine Network?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: What I, what I acknowledge is<br />
that if I make any decision, one way and another, it's<br />
going to be seen to be, and in a sense.. in effect would<br />
be. I mean, put the question in another way, Alan. If<br />
I were to say unlimited overseas ownership, that would<br />
be helping Bond media, and so where do you win in that<br />
situation?<br />
OAK ES: Prime Minister, we're almost out of time, but<br />
your wife Hazel.' s over the front pages of all the papers<br />
today, and going on 60 Minutes tonight, that she once<br />
consulted a divorce lawyer.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Yep.<br />
OAKES: I mean, what did you do that drove her to that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Oh, I think that's fairly<br />
recorded. had the.. the opportunity this morning<br />
of hearing Hazel on the subject, and she is rather irate<br />
about the way it's been represented. That's it's saying,<br />
as I think when you read the story, she... er... she took<br />
that course of action to see what her options were, and<br />
she asserts that she never had any intention, she file,<br />
she didn't seek to.. er.. I think that my life is a pretty<br />
well-documented sort of thing. As I've said<br />
before.. er.. Laurie, there are parts of it of which I'm<br />
not particularly proud, there are many parts of<br />
which.. of which I'm very, very proud. And I think the<br />
fact is that.. er.. after 40 years or more, Hazel's,<br />
through that period, made the decision, sure there have<br />
been some warts, but the pluses, in her judgement, and<br />
I'm very glad she's made it, fairly significantly<br />
outweigh the.. the minuses. I thank her for making that<br />
decision because she's been a marvellous partner.<br />
OAKES: And we thank you for appearing on the program.<br />
We'll see a lot of you in the election campaign.<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAWKE: Thank you very much Laurie, Alan. </p>
