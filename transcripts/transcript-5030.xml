PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 27 APRIL' 1979<br />
PRIME MINISTER ON " TALK TO THE GIANTS", PERTH-.<br />
INTERVIEWED BY SCHOOL CHILDREN<br />
( VIDEOCASSETTE FIELD IN PRESS OFFICE)<br />
John Hludson,<br />
In this series young Australians have the opportunity to<br />
discuss with the nation' s leaders the decisions which will affect<br />
their future life in this country. We are delighted to bring<br />
together an audience of over 120 and a panel of four young<br />
people whose ages range from 12 to 17, and they will " talk to<br />
the giants". On this programme we have a very special guest. Will<br />
you please welcome the Prime Minister of Australia,<br />
Mr. Malcolm Fraser.<br />
Prime Minister, thank you very much for being with us. Let<br />
me set the field a bit. All the questions which are going to<br />
be fired at you tonight have been prepared by the people here.<br />
They've researched them, they've gone into them very thoroughly,<br />
as I think you know. I reckon the next best thing is for you<br />
to meet the panel, if you will.<br />
Panel<br />
Leon Cohen 17-year old student<br />
Megan Simpson 16, from Perth College<br />
Evelyn 14<br />
David Monohan Madington High School.<br />
Question<br />
Mr. Fraser, what is the Australian Government doing to stop<br />
strikes? Prime Minister<br />
Stopping strikes is a continuous battle -if you like to put itand<br />
I think there will always be some unions that go out on<br />
strike. One of the things we are doing now in the Commonwealth<br />
employment is to make sure that anyone who doesn't do their<br />
full job, as directed, as asked, immediately gets stood down<br />
and doesn't get paid. So there is a financial penalty if<br />
people act in that way. We've tried to strengthen the law<br />
so that individuals in a union can have a greater say in that<br />
union's affairs and we will continue to do that.<br />
Question<br />
Do you think the unions are more powerful than the Government?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, they are not more powerful than the Government, but they<br />
are sometimes very powerful and they sometimes behave with<br />
total disregard for their effect on other people people<br />
working in other industries and for the harm they can cause<br />
throughout the whole community. I strongly believe that unions 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
cannot and must not be placed above the law. They've got<br />
to be responsive to it, just as you are, just as I have<br />
to be.<br />
Question The thought of atomic radiation and leakages and things<br />
like that it kinds of scares me for my future. Why was there<br />
no referendum on uranium?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Governments are elected to govern and if you had a referendum<br />
everytime there was an important question, then I don't think<br />
Government decisions would ever really be made. You've got<br />
to make a decision, you've got to argue that decision, and<br />
if people like it they will presumably go on supporting you.<br />
If they don't like it, they presumably won't.,<br />
Question Sir, but don't you think this matter was of sufficient<br />
importance to have a referendum?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, not more important than a lot of other decisions, no I don't.<br />
The'only decision the Commonw~ ealth Government has made is<br />
for mining and export of uranium. I've got no doubt that at<br />
some stage-and I know this State has made a decision to move<br />
into nuclear power for peaceful purposes it is worth noting<br />
that in spite of the accident that took place at Harrisburg,<br />
the nuclear power industry has to this point been the safest,<br />
more safely developed, as a power industry for peaceful<br />
purposes than any other form of pow., er. I saw Professor Titterton<br />
on television the other night making a point that a petroleum<br />
truck had exploded in Spain and 100 people had been killed.<br />
The record, in terms of not hurting people, in the nuclear<br />
power industry, is a tremendously good one and that needs to<br />
be understood.<br />
Question<br />
With respect sir, I can't contain myself. You said the uranium<br />
issue was not of sufficient importance to have a referendum.<br />
Are you implying that it is of less importance than the<br />
National Anthem?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think that's a good question and you've probably got me<br />
there. But I felt even though I was in favour of Waltzing<br />
Matilda because this is the song that stirs Australian hearts<br />
right around the world and which is recognised as Australian..<br />
I think this seemed to be a decision which is something that<br />
belonged is personal to all Australians. But the nuclear<br />
matter was one which was complex, difficult and we believed<br />
it was a matter that Governments ought to decide in terms of<br />
the mining and export of uranium. .1.3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
Qulest io n<br />
But sir, democracy is rule by the people of the people.<br />
Now, this is a decision which is going to affect us all<br />
and if there is obviously such contention over it, shouldn't<br />
it be put to the people rather than you making a decision<br />
which perhaps they could totally reject?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
If they wanted to totally reject it, they can do something<br />
that's what a ballot box, that's what a vote, an election is for.<br />
Question With the next election coming up very soon, how do you think<br />
the people...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Not too soon. It's not next week.<br />
Question Coming up in a while how do you think the people will react<br />
to your judgement, the decision you have made?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I believe when the next election comes around,. we will end<br />
up with a pretty good majority after that-election.<br />
Question Don't you think it's really like a totalitarian Government,<br />
if you say we know what's best for the people, we will make<br />
the decisions for them?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It's only totalitarian when you don't have elections. One of<br />
the very odd things I've been told the last two elections<br />
were democratic. I hope people aren't going to go on telling<br />
me that elections are not democratic because that's almost<br />
an incitement not to have any more elections. That would be<br />
a terrible thing.<br />
Question<br />
This is related to the questions of elections. To be able to<br />
live up to all of the promises which a Government must make<br />
around election time, a Prime Minister would either have to be<br />
a Solomon or a second Messiah. Do you ever regret always having<br />
to make these promises? 14 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think in one or two things that maybe we were over-ambitious,<br />
but basically I try to say nothing which I don't believe can<br />
be fulfilled. I have enormous confidence in the capacity for<br />
judgement of the Australian people and I believe that politicians<br />
who promise too much will certainly be seen through, and<br />
quite quickly.<br />
Question Sir,' in all probability, the public is using this criterion<br />
as a method of gauging how successful the Government is.<br />
Can you think of a better way for them to guage how successful<br />
a Government is?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It's not just a question of what you say at an election time.<br />
It's also a question of what you are doing between elections<br />
in the whole period of Government; whether you respond to the<br />
problems that face the country and how the way you govern<br />
generally affects the lives of Australians in every corner of<br />
this country.<br />
Questions from Audience<br />
Question Why is so much money being poured into nuclear power and the<br />
research into it, when surely solar energy would be<br />
Australia's most valuable and safest form of energy?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Australia isn't puttin~ g all that much money into nuclear power<br />
research. We need to stay up with modern technology. We would<br />
be putting more money I think into research into alternative<br />
uses of coal. But for many countries overseas that haven't got<br />
different that haven't got coal, they don't have much oil,<br />
and they've come to believe the only way they can keep their<br />
factories going and their homes heated in the winter is through<br />
the use of nuclear fuel. A number of European countries will<br />
have a very very high proportion of their total fuel requirements<br />
supplied by nuclear reactors in five or ten years time. I don't<br />
think they've got any option, as~ it is at the moment. The<br />
scientific advice available to me indicates that solar power is<br />
not really feasible as a source for major production of power<br />
for maybe 30 years or more; for heating your hot water, for<br />
doing some other household things of that kind, yes, there is<br />
a role.<br />
Question<br />
A great number of Vietnam boat people have arrived in Australia<br />
and many of us feel that they have been deliberately sent by<br />
their Government. What views have you got of this? </p>
<p>Prime Minister<br />
I don't think deliberately sent by their Government in a sense<br />
that they were wanting to get people into Australia but I do<br />
think for a while the Government of Vietnam was actively trying<br />
to move people out who were dissidents in Vietnam and was<br />
co-operating in a sense of art export of people. That was a<br />
pretty horrible sort of way for a Government to go on. I think<br />
you've got obligations refugees from Vietnam and we seek<br />
to meet those obligations as best we can.<br />
Question Your inflation policy seems mainly to benefit big business<br />
and then they use their benefits to increase technology which<br />
increases unemployment. Do you follow this policy as closely<br />
as you do, because they fund a lot of your campaigns and<br />
therefore tend to dictate to you-a bit?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, but I don't think you are right in the original assumption.<br />
An anti-inflationary policy helps everyone and nobody does<br />
well if there is too much inflation. One of the significant<br />
local industries in Perth right at this moment has just<br />
signed contracts for fishing boats to Burma. It has been able<br />
to do that,, the Managing Director wrote to me, because inflation<br />
was down, there is a stable labour force and because there<br />
are export incentives. Now, that's a middle-ranking Australian<br />
company doing a very job with Australian labour. There are many<br />
companies in the same position. Getting inflation down will<br />
enable all businesses to do better and sell more of their<br />
products in Australia and more of their products overseas.<br />
That's the only way we are going to be able to have Australians<br />
fully employed again.<br />
Question How can Australia possibly put up with the indiscrimate<br />
acceptance of refu gees into our country, many of them who may<br />
not be true refugees, having the power and the money to buy their<br />
way onto these boats and obtain a fairly simple way of migrating<br />
to Australia compared to the orthodox channels.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We try and check to make sure they are proper refugees and<br />
do qualify. If it is found that they don't then different<br />
judgements are made about it. There is a very real refugee<br />
situation coming out of South East Asia and I think we have to<br />
recognize the facts of life of that.<br />
Question Sir,, with the age of technology here to stay, wouldn't it be<br />
better to hand over the Government to IBM?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, I don't really think so. I think that Computers are very<br />
inhuman things and there is much nmore to Government than technology. 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
Technology is something that we've got to use for the<br />
benefit of people. It enables us to do some things better.<br />
It enables us to free resources that can be used in other<br />
ways. We've got to make sure that technology doesn't take<br />
over.<br />
Question Can you ever see a machine taking over the Prime Minister?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Not in the sort of world I would want to live in.<br />
Question If we are to cope with our ever-expanding technology, how,<br />
can youever justify cuts in education.. We've an excess of<br />
unemployed teachers, and we certainly have plenty of schools<br />
and children who need them. Is it all some sort of a plan to<br />
make people less educated so they will be forced to accept<br />
more ( inaudible) jobs?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, I don't think so. I think people are better educated today<br />
than they have probably ever been. I think, hope, that that<br />
will go on being so. Cuts in education it's really a question<br />
of talking about the rate of increase in expenditure more than<br />
talking positively about cuts, I think, because enormous<br />
additional sums have been spent on education. I think the<br />
increase in part started when I was Education Minister quite<br />
a large number of years ago. The facilities available, the<br />
classrooms today, the number of teachers, the class sizes,<br />
all are infinitely better than was the case even five or ten<br />
years ago. I think this process is going to go on.<br />
Quest ion<br />
You have already said that there are children who aren't<br />
receiving the attention they need. Now, surely if we have<br />
these extra teachers, it's wicked not to use them to help<br />
these children.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
One of the problems with the numbers of teachers that arc<br />
available I think is that when there was very high employment<br />
in Australia and very little unemployment, a lot of people<br />
entered the teaching profession and then went on to do something<br />
else because other jobs were available. Therefore to have<br />
enough teachers all the State Governments and the Commonwealth<br />
Government also, because we were involved, had teaching colleges<br />
and teacher training in universities and in fact were teaching,<br />
or had a capacity, to produce more teachers, than the system<br />
needed. 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
Quest ion<br />
You were saying before that there is better education and<br />
everything like that. Why is there so much unemployment, if<br />
everyone is better educated?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There is unemployment for a number of different reasons.<br />
One of them is that wages went up too much; female rates<br />
went up 37 percent one year, and male rates went up 27 percent<br />
in the same year and Australian factories just couldn't sell<br />
what they were producing because the costs were too high.<br />
So Australians started to buy more from overseas. Australian<br />
manufacturers lost their markets overseas. If Australian<br />
manufacturers can't sell what they are trying to produce, they<br />
won't be able to employ people. Now we had to get all that<br />
right so that Australian industry can sell and compete again<br />
in Australia and in markets outside.<br />
Question I understand that the Colombo Plan still finances a large<br />
number of foreign students studying at our University.<br />
This is at a time when many of the Australian students are<br />
finding it difficult to obtain a tertiary allowance. Do you<br />
think that is a fair situation?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes I do. The number of foreign students in Australian<br />
universities I think is roughly the same as it was in about<br />
1960-61 and the numbers and places available at Australian<br />
universities and colleges of advanced education has grown<br />
enormously since then. The proportion is smaller than it used<br />
to be and I am not sure that I like that because I think Australia<br />
has got an obligation to South East Asian and Asian countries.<br />
I think we've got an obligation to developing countries. I also<br />
believe that if kids from these countries can come and study<br />
at Australian institutions and make friends in Australia that<br />
this is one of the best long-term things to guarantee a good<br />
relationship between Australia and countries of Asia to our<br />
north and other places. I am strongly in favour of the Colombo<br />
Plan and overseas students being able to come to our. institutions.<br />
Question Do the Asians provide a money scheme for us, if we go to<br />
their universities?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, but they wouldn't have many universities and we would have<br />
a much higher proportion of our population going to universities<br />
and colleges than they would.. In some Asian countries the<br />
average income might be $ 200, $ 300, $ 400 a year, per head.<br />
Compare that with the position in Australia. The standard of<br />
life is so very different. I think it is hard for us sometimes<br />
to understand. The technical aid, the aid through higher<br />
education, I think is one of the obligations that Australia<br />
owes to other countries that aren't quite so well off as we are. </p>
<p>8-<br />
Question was Britain's protege, and now it looks like we are<br />
trying to lick the boots of the United States. D~ O you believe<br />
that Australians are a dependent people, that we need to<br />
forever to tag along in the shadow of some larger nation?<br />
Prim~ e Minister<br />
I don't really think we are tagging along in the shadow of<br />
any nation. We are Australian, we are independent, we make<br />
our own decisions. Certainly we have an alliance with the<br />
United States and New Zealand but we gain out of that alliance<br />
and we play our part in relation to it. But on many international<br />
policy issues, Australia takes here own path completely, argues<br />
with the United States or argues with Britain, or countries<br />
in Europe and will continue to do that.<br />
Question With respect sir, could you say that when you make your<br />
decisions on international policy, especially trade, that those<br />
decisions are completely free of consideration with the<br />
alliances and the concessions that you give the United States,<br />
that they demand of you?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
If you'd heard some of the discussions that have gone on over<br />
trade matters between ourselves and the United States in<br />
particular, but also between ourselves and Europe or other<br />
countries,, or Japan, you couldn't for one minute believe that<br />
what we were saying is modified or softened because of other<br />
considerations of a strategic kind or of an alliance kind.<br />
Question But isn't it true that the United States'companies, large ones,<br />
for example UTAH mining, pay much receive tax concessions<br />
they pay much less tax that all other countries?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, they get the same taxes as other countries as other<br />
companies and UTAH pays vast sums in taxes and royalties.<br />
Don't hold me to ransom it's something like $ 160 m $ 200 m<br />
a year in taxes from UTAH going into either the Queensland<br />
Treasury or the Commonwealth Treasury. There are no concessions<br />
available that I am aware of, to foreign companies, that<br />
aren't aLvailable to Australian. W&amp; do try and treat all<br />
companies the same.<br />
Question H-ow do you feel about being depicted like this?<br />
( Picture from Pickering's Calendar).<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
That's Pickering's that's his old calendar, isn't it?<br />
1/ 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
Question Last year.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I was a little bit hurt becaulse l1e left Me out Of this<br />
last one.<br />
Que stion.<br />
You haven't quite answered the question. How do you feel<br />
about being depicted like this?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, it's just like being depicted any other way, isn't it?<br />
People draw cartoons of you sometimes they put clothes on,<br />
sometimes they take clothes off. Larry Pickering can do it<br />
either way as far as I am concerned.<br />
Question Did Tamie and the kids see it?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
If they did they hid it from me. They probably thought I<br />
would have been embarrassed.<br />
Question I come from a family of three children and my father has a<br />
great influence on all of us. How does you job as Prime Minister<br />
affect your children and how to find the time to guide and<br />
discipline them?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I was a politician when I first got married and I've got to<br />
pay most of the credit for keeping the family, and I hope keeping<br />
everyone sane, to Tamie. It's really only since I have been<br />
Prime Minister that she has come around much with me and done<br />
some things in her own right as the Prime Minister's wife.<br />
She's been able to do it over the last three years because<br />
our eldest boy was leaving school and going out and starting<br />
to make his own way. The other kids were a bit older and they<br />
were at boarding school. But this is something that it really<br />
has it's worried me all my political life because I have seen<br />
kids, I think, get into trouble because parents haven't been<br />
at home enough maybe both parents working and politics just<br />
wouldn't be worth it if that happened to your own kids. It wouldn't<br />
be worth it so far as I was concerned. So I think what you<br />
try and do is those times when you can bc together, you've got<br />
to try and make sure your own children know and understand that<br />
they are the most important thing to you. It might be only<br />
for a short while, for a weekend or whatever, but while you<br />
are there, they are the things that are important. </p>
<p>10<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
I have always tried to do some things we mentioned fishing<br />
earlier that's something you can do as a very old man, so<br />
you can always do it with your kids. We took a camping trip<br />
up through the Northern Territory as a family. I pay most<br />
of the credit to Tamie. I think she's held all this together.<br />
Question every year we hear of young people overseas imprisoned<br />
in some countries for things they don't really know what<br />
they are doing, they are looking for different lifestyles and<br />
they break laws in countries which have in some cases,<br />
corrupt legal systems. What is your attitude towards these<br />
Australians. Do you try to help them and if they are in prison,<br />
does the Australian Consulate keep a continued check on their<br />
welfare when imprisoned?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes. This is one of the jobs of the consulate service right<br />
around the world. But I would like to make one point and make<br />
it's a warnihg also that's been made by the Government on a<br />
number of occasions. If people do trangress the laws of other<br />
countries there isn't always a great deal that you can do<br />
about it. If people are going into other countries they do<br />
need to try and understand what the laws are. That applies<br />
especially if anything to do with drugs in involved.<br />
In a number of South East Asian countries where there has been<br />
a real drug problem, the laws are very severe, very strict,<br />
and they are upheld very vigorously indeed. I am afraid that<br />
in spite of warnings, a number of young Australians have got<br />
into trouble because of that in places like Bangkok.<br />
Question When they do get into trouble, does the Australian Government<br />
try to get them out of it?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You try and help, but at the same time, if they've plainly<br />
transgressed the laws of the country and if there is clear<br />
evidence, for example, that they have been involved in drugs<br />
against the laws of the country, I don't think it is setting<br />
too good an example to say becau'se they are Australians they<br />
should get off free. I really do feel very strongly about<br />
people who are involved in the drug trade in one form or another.<br />
Somebody who's sick and peddles...<br />
Question It isn't always drugs. / 11 </p>
<p>11.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, not always, but quite a number have been caught involved<br />
with drugs in places like Thailand and that's what I'm saying.<br />
But the consular service is there in country's around the<br />
world, designed to protect Australians. It will use its<br />
resou-rces as vigorously as it can. But people can't expect<br />
to go into other countries and break their laws and just because<br />
they are a foreigner get off scot-free. If people come from<br />
other places into Australia and break our laws, and their<br />
consular service comes down and says ' he's a foreigner, he didn't<br />
really know' we say well, he broke our laws,, he will have to<br />
answer in the courts.<br />
Question Do you rely on your own judgement when making decisions or do<br />
you take the advice of your consultants and advisers?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It depends a lot on what the particular issue is, but on important<br />
issues I think you don't want to make a judgement too quickly.<br />
You want to make sure you've got all the advice you can. That<br />
advice will come from the Public Service. It might come from<br />
your Party organisation, it might come from your Parliamentary<br />
colleagues. Certainly it comes from your Cabinet colleagues,<br />
and then having got all the information you can, all the advice<br />
you can, the Cabinet sits down to make up its mind. But you<br />
try and gather in all the information that's available, hopefully<br />
so that you make the best and wisest decision.<br />
Question Generally, how many advisers do you have.?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
A lot of people would say too many because they say all the<br />
Public Service are technically advisers. That numbers tens<br />
and tens of thousands, but the numbers that you actually are<br />
in touch with would be relatively few.<br />
John Hudson<br />
You've certainly got enough.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There are enough advisers, yes. But you can always go to people<br />
outside in the community if there is a particular thing, a<br />
technical matter, you need advice on. You can go to people in<br />
industry, you can go to people in universities, and really all<br />
the wisdom of a country is available to a Government is only<br />
a Government is prepared to try and tap it, find it, and use it.<br />

Question<br />
This is a question you have probably never been asked<br />
before and will probably never be asked again you are<br />
tall, dark and handsome, do you find this helps you to relate<br />
to women in politics<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't think I know.<br />
Question Would you find this helped you to relate to women in general?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You just talk with people and whether it's men or whether<br />
it's women, you meet them as they are and try and treat people<br />
as they are. Hopefully, they will do the same with you. So<br />
whether you are long, whether you are short, whether you are<br />
fat or whether you are thin, I think how you react to people<br />
and how they react to you very often depends a lot on your<br />
own feelings and having respect for people. I think its the most<br />
important thing in any relationship and I think that's probably<br />
much more important than your shape or your size.<br />
Question Thi_ is the first time that you have had this sort of<br />
discussion with young people like us. Why haven't you talked<br />
to us before and how can you possible legislate about our<br />
problems if you don't have enough contact with us to find out<br />
what they are?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think the programmes a good idea. I haven't done this sort<br />
of programme before because I haven't been asked before. I do<br />
go on talk-back programmes. I have been on other interview<br />
programmes of different kinds, but I don't think with people<br />
under sort of university or senior college age before. I think<br />
it's a good idea and people are interested in politics I think<br />
much younger than they used to be, certainly much younger than--<br />
when I was school people didn't talk about politics. We talked<br />
about football, who was going to win cricket on Saturday, and<br />
that was nearly the end of it. I think people's interests are<br />
much wider today and I think that is a good thing.<br />
Question Do you feel that you are in contact with the feelings of the<br />
youth of Australia?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We try to be. We have established a Department of Employment<br />
and Youth Affairs and Ian Viner will be announcing fairly shortly<br />
a National Youth Council which is designed to try and help us<br />
keep in touch. As a memnber of Parliament I advertise still / 13 </p>
<p>13<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
even as Prime Minister I still regard my representative job<br />
in my own electorate as a very important one. I still advertise<br />
if I am going to be in a certain place in one of my country<br />
towns at a certain time for a few hours so that constituents<br />
of all sizes and shapes and ages can come and speak to me<br />
if they want to, and put whatever problemns they want to. Quite<br />
often young people come and talk to me just as much as their<br />
parents do or other people might. I've always regarded it<br />
as important to try and keep in touch. You make yourself<br />
accessible, it's up to people to take the opportunity. People<br />
can write. You would, I think, surprised, how many letters<br />
I get from kids who are at school putting a point of view<br />
about one thing or another and when they write I try and answer.<br />
Question You've said in the past that you've been greatly influenced<br />
by the late Sir Robert Menzies. Would it be fair to say<br />
that your are into his philosophy of strong leadership and<br />
authoritarian command, right up to the Menzian eyebrows?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't know. I think other people would have to judge that.<br />
But I do believe very very strongly that the collective wisdom<br />
of a group of people is going to be much better than the<br />
judgement of a single person. That's why you have Cabinet<br />
Government, collective responsibility and you discuss things<br />
and people go into that room with certain. views. They come out<br />
of it with one view having discussed it fully. I think, again,<br />
that's the way it should be, because no one person's got<br />
certainly all wisdom or all the best of judgement.<br />
Question Will your kids ever receive a dole cheque?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I hope not. I hope they will be able to get themselves a<br />
job. My eldest boy, Mark, is jackarooing he did three<br />
years jackarooing, two years in the Riverina and once in the<br />
Snowy Mountains area one year. He is now at Glen<br />
Agriculture College and he wants to go on the land. I think<br />
he's learnt a good deal about that. Angela is at the Royal<br />
Melbourne Institute of Technology doing interior design.<br />
The other two kids are still at-school. The boys have always<br />
seemed to be able to get a bit of work. Hugh is at boarding<br />
school in Canberra. But if he wants to make some pocket money<br />
he manages to get some weekend work around Canberra.<br />
" Question Do you think this is due to you being the Prime Minister? 14 </p>
<p>14<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, I don't think so. I think the problem with employment<br />
at the moment is very often the problem it's not a problem<br />
of the whole age groups it's a problem of say ten or<br />
maybe 15 percent of an age group who mightn't have quite the<br />
samec motivation, mightn't Present them-iselves quite so well,<br />
mightn't have so much confidence in themselves, mightn't<br />
have been helped so much by their parents not because it's<br />
their parent's fault--and if kids are doubtful about their<br />
own capacity, their own ability, I think these days it can be<br />
difficult for them to get work. That's one of they reasons<br />
why we have a whole range of training programmes. I also think<br />
the schools ought to pay more attention than they do to this<br />
in the sense 10 or 15 percent of an age group who are the ones<br />
that might find it difficult to get work. ' So often some schools<br />
pay attention to the bright, the able, and they are the ones<br />
who are going to get scholarships or exhibitions and<br />
distinctions. But everyone is a person. I think it is often<br />
people at the other end of the capacity level who need most<br />
help. They haven't always got it from schools or from other<br />
institutions. Quest ion<br />
My name is Allan Logan. The defence of the north coast of<br />
Australia, particular Western Australia, seems to have been<br />
neglected. What do you propose to do about this?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't think it's neglected. We are slowing d eveloping a Navy<br />
that can operate in two oceans. Major naval facilities have<br />
been built on the West Coast. We've also got Orion aircraft.<br />
We will have better patrol boats that are being built in<br />
Australia. Question What was your reaction to the book that was written about<br />
you " The Wit of Malcolm Fraser"?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There really couldn't be much reaction because there was nothing<br />
on it, was there?<br />
Question<br />
My name is Melinda Riddle and I, like most people of my age,<br />
are very concerned with the current employment situation in<br />
Australia. I was wondering, what are you going to do about<br />
discrimination between teenagers and adults. I notice that<br />
a lot of women whose husbands are able to support their<br />
families, are getting jobs in preference of the teenagers who<br />
have just left school. What are you going to do about this?<br />
/ is </p>
<p>15<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Two things I would like to say; I think a lot of teenagers<br />
got jobs because the rates of pay are less and so I think<br />
it would tend to even up a bit. Now, it would be very hard<br />
to say to a woman, because you are married, because your<br />
husband has a job, you can't get some work. A person is<br />
a person as an individual and you can't get away from-,<br />
that. What we have got to do is to get to a position where<br />
people who want to work can get a rewarding job. I think<br />
that's starting to happen.<br />
John Hudson<br />
Prime Minister, that is a pretty sharp area there. Youngsters<br />
do find it difficult. They can get a job if they are paid<br />
cheaper rates, but then adults can come along get part-time<br />
labour and the younger people are penalised so often.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Maybe, but if the younger person can do the job I think very<br />
often the employer will go for the younger person because the<br />
award rates are less for the younger person. That gives the<br />
younger person a chance. Also, we talked about this earlier,<br />
for each age group it's not the total age group, it's the<br />
ten or fifteen percent who find it difficult, out of the<br />
ago group. We do have special training programmes. I think<br />
schools need to give more attention to it and we have to<br />
keep the economy right so that industry can employ more.<br />
Question I realise most of the people here are wondering about most<br />
of Australia's what's going to happen to them in the future.<br />
I am wondering about Australia's amateur athletics and all<br />
the rest of the things. I know the Government puts some<br />
nominal amounts of money into different sorts of sporting<br />
fixtures what does the Government plan to do with future<br />
programmes for amateur athletics, putting money into it<br />
like most other countries do and making us more of a powerful<br />
nation in this aspect.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We've started, in recent times, different policies and I think<br />
policies that are much better.' For the Olympic Games we are<br />
providing much more than every before and we have given the<br />
money in advance so that the various sporting associations can<br />
have pre-Games training . and select-ion going . on over a period<br />
of years, not just months before the Games; then of course<br />
support for the team during the Games. We hope, on this basis,<br />
to develop for the major international events, long-term<br />
programmes which the various sporting bodies can manage and<br />
operate. Hopefully Australians will then get back on top<br />
where they ought to be. / 16 </p>

., Question<br />
Do you consider yourself a " giant".<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I just consider myself a person I suppose. I am a bit<br />
bigger than you are, but I am older and I am heavier than<br />
I ought to be.<br />
John Hudson<br />
Does your question mean '" does the Prime Minister feel that<br />
he is very powerful", a big man in that sense?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The job doesn't make me feel that at all.-I just think there<br />
is a job to do. The decisions you make are important for<br />
people like yourselves, for people all around Australia and<br />
you try and make the best decisions you can.<br />
Question<br />
My name is Sally Lynch. I was just going to ask you why are<br />
the refugees channelled into the cities when they are more<br />
accustomed to a rural way of life?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It's a question of where there can be work and most of the<br />
refugees have been able to get work without too much trouble,<br />
in factories and whatever. I don't know that it would be<br />
they have mostly been accustomed to a rural way of life in<br />
Vietnam. There are some large cities. I don't know that a<br />
majority of them have come from farms at all.<br />
Question Getting to a more personalised question. Why did you enter<br />
into Parliament?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
On one side I thought it would fit in well with running a farm<br />
and I soon found it didn't that it was much more than a<br />
full time job. When I was at un~ iversity I became interested<br />
and concerned with politics and I think interested and<br />
concerned about the future of Australia.<br />
John Hudson<br />
You've never thought about going into television?<br />
* Prime* Minister<br />
I've never thought about going into television, no. / 17 </p>
<p>-17<br />
Question If a war broke out and our allies didn't come,, would we<br />
really have a hope?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It would depend on the war. Australia is going to be<br />
alright and Australia will survive long after me and long<br />
after you. I don't believe there is going to be a war.<br />
Question No but taking for granted that there will be, we will have<br />
a hope, according to you?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Of course we will, but the whole art of Government, the<br />
whole purpose of foreign policy and defence policy, is to<br />
look ahead to see what the dangers might be and then avoid<br />
those dangers to see that they don't occur.<br />
Question How close are you to Bob Hawke?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We talk.<br />
Question I think it is very good if two people who are on opposite<br />
sides, if I may say that, can be friendly. Are you friendly<br />
with Bob Hawke?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes, when we meet in private, certainly.<br />
Question And what have you discussed in these meetings?<br />
Prime MinisterI<br />
They wouldn't be private if I said, would they? It is important<br />
to have the capacity to-be able to speak with people in<br />
positions such as Mr. Hawke's and to be able to do it plainly<br />
and to understand each other. Tony Street does this with them<br />
all the time. I do it occasionally when it is necessary.<br />
It won't work unless the confidences that take place then<br />
are kept.<br />
~ Questi'on<br />
You are here to find out what the young people of Australia<br />
feel and I feel, I think I am speaking for about all of us,<br />
/ 18 </p>
<p>-18<br />
Question ( continued)<br />
when I say quite simply that we don't want uranium in our<br />
country, we don't want hugc sprawling foreign companies buying<br />
Australia out from uinder our feet and we want to know more<br />
about what is going on behind the closed oaken doors of your<br />
Government office.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think that is a statement and not a question. You don't<br />
want uranium and I can understand your concerns there, but<br />
I think they are wrong. You don't want foreign companies<br />
to buy out Australia, and we have foreign investment rules<br />
to make sure that investment opportunities for Australians<br />
are kepts as wide and as open as possible. But there will be<br />
many less jobs for Australians if you don't have investment<br />
from countries overseas. There you might have to make a choice<br />
as to whether you want jobs to be available or whether you<br />
want overseas people to invest in Australia which will help<br />
to make more jobs available. There is a Freedom of Information<br />
legislation. It is being debated by a Senate Committee. I think<br />
something will come out of that. You asked me the questions<br />
that you want to know the answers to. This has been your<br />
opportunity, so what do you want to know that you don't know?<br />
Question This may be a depressing area for a politician to talk about,<br />
but when it eventually comes time for you-to step down from<br />
politics, what is the greatest legacy which you could leave<br />
behind? Prime Minister<br />
I think a country that has been well governed but with a<br />
good succession. I think that might be more important.<br />
So often politicians leave and there isn't a quite succession,<br />
there isn't a smooth transition for Government to go on well<br />
after you have departed the scene; to let your successor<br />
govern and not stay about in his hair.<br />
John Hudson-<br />
It's not an obituary programme, not yet, you've got plenty<br />
of time to do things Prime Minister. It strikes us, some of<br />
us, that it would be a good opportunity, if you like it, to<br />
ask questions of the panel1, because-this is such a rare<br />
occasion. Prime Minister<br />
One quick one because from the second last one is there<br />
any particular thing of Government that you want to know.<br />
Question I just feel I know you are Prime Ministeraid you have to<br />
guard your speech, but I don't really feel / 119 </p>
<p>p19 Question ( continued)<br />
we've received direct answers to all the questions that<br />
we ' ye asked you.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
What question haven't you received a direct answer to?<br />
Question You say that you feel that my views on uranium are wrong,<br />
but why are they wrong? We are really concerned. We think<br />
that... Prime Minister<br />
Well alright, why are they wrong? They are wrong because there<br />
are many countries that will not be able to heat their homes<br />
in the winter. There are many countries where they will not<br />
able to keep the power going for their factories if they don't<br />
use nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes. It's as simple<br />
as that. Therefore, this trade is going to go on. We want<br />
it therefore to go on in the safest way possible and we can<br />
influence that if Australia is involved in it because then we<br />
can get the most secure non-proliferation regime if we've<br />
got a powerful voice in the trade and making sure that it is<br />
as safe as it can possibly be.<br />
Question I could quite simply accept that if you just tell me the<br />
answer to one question. What are you going to do with all<br />
the nuclear waste which is going to live on after your<br />
memory is completely gone?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The nuclear waste at the moment is going into a glassified<br />
form,, solidified and it is being buried underground.<br />
Question But it will still be there?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It will be there. But I am told by people who have much<br />
more competence to judge than I have, because they have the<br />
technical expertise, that that is a safe manner of disposal.<br />
John Hudson<br />
Are you satisfied with your question which you have<br />
asked of the panel? </p>
<p>20<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It's so easy' to say the Government is secret and doesn't tell.<br />
I like to know whlat the secrets are that we are meant to be<br />
telling so we can talk about it. Again, that is partly<br />
challenge. D_-vicl, is there something you want to know<br />
about government that you have felt I haven't spoken about.<br />
David No comment sir.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There is one'other thing that I do want to say. At the<br />
beginning I said " why haven't I come and spoken to you<br />
before" and I said I haven't been asked. So, am I going to<br />
be asked to come back in six months and do it again?<br />
Same panel, same audience.<br />
Question We accept the challenge.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
L have enjoyed it, have.. you?<br />
Audience Ye s.<br />
John Hudson<br />
There's nothing really more for me to sa y except to thank you<br />
very much, because this is a history-making programme. It's<br />
not been done before, we are very grateful to you for making<br />
it possible.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think it's been a good programme and I have enjoyed it and<br />
I have enjoyed the questions. I think some of them have been<br />
well thought out and well put. But there is I think a lot<br />
of the questions are much better ~ than I get from I was<br />
going to say more adult programmes but that is the wrong way<br />
of putting it when the questions have been put by older<br />
people because they sometimes stick on one point, they try to<br />
get some admission out of you that you are not going to make<br />
so they stay on that point for ten minutes, fifteen minutes<br />
and I think it gets plain dull. I have enjoyed it and I have<br />
enjoyed your questions.<br />
John Hudson<br />
Thank you very much. From the audience good night and from<br />
the panel good night.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Good night till six months. 000 </p>
