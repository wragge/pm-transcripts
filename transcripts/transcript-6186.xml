I AM VERY PLEASED TO HAVE BEEN INVITED TO ADDRESS<br />
THIS GATHERING OF THE AUSTRALIA JAPAN BUSINESS CO-OPERAi TION<br />
COMMITTEE " ND THE AUSTRALIAN NTIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE<br />
PACIFIC BASIN EcoNcMic COUNCIL. I DO SO AT A TIME WHEN<br />
THE FOCUS OF NATIONAL ATTENTION IS ON THE BUDGET AND WHEN,<br />
INTERNATIONALLY, THE COUNTRIES OF THE VAST PACIFIC REGION<br />
ARE MOVING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY NOW<br />
UNDER WAYFOR AUSTRALIA, THE EMERGING GLOBAL ECONOM1IC<br />
RECOVERY LED BY A SHARP RESURGENCE OF DEMAND AND ACTIVITY<br />
IN THE UNITED STATES, AND PICKING UP AT A FASTER RATE THAN<br />
EVEN THE MOST OPTIMISTIC FORECASTS, IS ESPECIALLY TIMELY.<br />
WE AIM TO EXPLOIT FULLY THE OPORTUN'lITIES IT PRESENTSIN<br />
THIS RESPECT THE BUDGET' WE HAVE JUST BROUGHT<br />
DOWN MUST BE SEEN AS A NEW BEGINNING FOR AUSTRALIA.<br />
IMPORTANTLY IT AIMS TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE-IT HAS DONE SO<br />
BY ESTABLISHING AN I-4TEGrATED SET OF POLICIES FOR STEADY<br />
GRCWTH IN OUTPUT AND EMPLOYMENT, ACCOMPANIED BY A FURTHER<br />
MODERATION I N INFLATION* </p>
<p>THE PROSPECT mr 1983-84 IS FOR A GOOD RECOVERY IN<br />
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, GATHERING PACE ' THROUGH THE FINANCIAL<br />
YEAR:--EMPLOYMENT SHOULD GROW THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE<br />
YEAR AS ACTIVITY PICKS UP. INDEED THERE IS<br />
EVIDENCE THAT THIS PROCESS HAS ALREADY B3EGUN, WITH<br />
THREE CONSECUTIVE MONTHLY INCREASES, IN EMPLOYMENTINFLATION<br />
SHOULD COME DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ! TS<br />
PRESENT UNACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF 11%. OUR PRICES AND<br />
INCOMES POLICY IS DESIGNED TO HELP KEEP INFLATION<br />
ON A DOWNWARD PATH DOWN AS THE RECOVERY GEFS UNDER<br />
WAYMy GOVERNMENT'S OVERRIDING CONCERN HAS BEEN TO<br />
ESTABLISH THE BASIS OF SUSTAINED ECONOMIC RECOVERY-WE HAVE<br />
AIMED TO LAY FIRM . FOUNDATIONS FOR THE'ACHIEVEMENT OF THE<br />
OBJECTIVES WE SET OURSELVES FOR THE FIRST TERM OF THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT AND BEYOND.<br />
CENTRAL TO THIS STRATEGY HAS. BEEN THE SIMULTANEOUS<br />
ATTACK ON THE TWIN EVILS OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION-WE<br />
HAVE ALWAYS STRESSED THAT THERE WERE 140 OVERNIGHT SOLUTIONS<br />
FOR THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS WE FACE NO MIRACLE CURES. THE<br />
BUDGET MUST BE SEEN PART OF THE CONTINUING PROCESS OF<br />
PUTTING AUSTRALIA BACK ON ITS FEET-</p>
<p>3.<br />
ACHIEVING A SOUNDLY BASED RECOVERY IN ECONOMIC<br />
ACTIVITY MEANS ENSURING A STRONG PRIVATE SECTOR RESURGENCE<br />
IN ACTIVITY, WHILE RESTRAINING INFLATION AND THEREBY<br />
ACHIEVING RISING LIVING STANDARDS AND CREATING THE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES NECESSARY TO REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENTWE<br />
HAVE TAKEN AS A MATTER OF FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE<br />
THAT THE MAIN BURDEN FOR ACHIEVING THIS OBJECTIVE MUCT BE<br />
SHARED BY THOSE PEOPLE RELATIVELY WELL PLACED TO BEAR ITBOTH<br />
THE 19 MAY STATEMENT AND THE 1983-84 BUDGET REFLECT<br />
T H I S THUS: OUR INCREASED SPENDING OF $ 315 MILLION ON<br />
EMPLOYMENT CREATION SCHEMES AND EXPANSION OF<br />
GOVERNMENT CAPITAL EXPENDITURE BOTH DIRECTLY VIA<br />
COMMONWEALTH SPENDING AND THROUGH THE STATES;<br />
ADDITIONAL SOCIAL WELFARE PAYMENTS TOTALLING $ 224<br />
MILL ION CONCENTRATED ON THE SINGLE UNEMPLOYED AND<br />
PENSIONERS WITH CHILDREN;<br />
A FAIRER FINANCING OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM BASED ON<br />
ABILITY TO PAY;<br />
REFORMS IN THE ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO HOME BUYERS<br />
BOTH TO IMPROVE EQUITY AND STIMULATE HIGHER<br />
ACTIVITY; </p>
<p>INCREASES IN EDUCATION4 ALLOWANCES AND FUNDING, WITH<br />
A MORE EQUiTAF1LE DISTRIB3UTION OF RESOURCES<br />
ACCORDING TO INEED; AIND FINALLY,<br />
ABOLITION OR REDUCTION OF SOME OF THE MORE BLATANT<br />
HAND-OUTS AND TAXATION IN4EQUITIES INTRODUCED OR<br />
IGNORED BY OUR PREDECESSORS. THUS WE HAVE TAKEN<br />
LONG-NEEDED ACTION ON SUPERANNUATION TAXATION, ON<br />
ASSET TESTING OF PENSIONS, ON RESTRICTED<br />
ELIGIBILITY FOR THE' OVER 70' s PENSION TO THOSE IN<br />
MOST NEED, ON TIGHTENED TAX AVOIDANCE LEGISLATION,<br />
ON STRENGTHENING SECTION 26( A) SO AS TO IMPROVE THE<br />
CAPACITY TO TAX CAPITAL GAINS, AND IN REDUCING A<br />
NUMBER OF OTHER SECTIONAL TAX OR SPENDING<br />
CONCESSIONS. THESE MEASURES ALL REFLECT THE COMMITMENT OF THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT TO MAKING AUSTRALIA A MORE EQUITABLE SOCIETYIT<br />
IS CRUCIAL TO THIS STRATEGY T-HAT1 WE SUCCESSFULLY<br />
ESTABLISH THE FOUNDATIONS FOR FUTURE' GROWTH. WE ARE<br />
DETERMINED TO AVOID AN4 ATMOSPHERE OF UNPREDICTABILITY AND<br />
INSTABILITY. THE BUDGET HAS THEREFO* RE CONTINUED THE PROCESS<br />
OF ENSURING AN ADEQUATE, BUT NOT EXCESSIVE, STIMULUS TO<br />
ACTIVITY. AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS LAID THE BASIS FOR<br />
REINING IN THE BUDGET DEFICIT IN4 FUTURE YEARS IN SUCH A WAY<br />
AS TO ENSURE THAT RISING PRIVATE SECTOR ACTIVITY WILL NOT BE </p>
<p>FACED WITH EXCESSIVE COMPETITION FROM THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR<br />
IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. PRESSURES OF 1HIS KIND MUST BE'<br />
CO0N TA IN ED. THE BUDGET PROVIDES FOR SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH IN<br />
GOVERNMENT OUTLAYS OF 15.8%, ONLY A FEW PEIRCEN4TAGE POINTS<br />
BELOW THE INCREASE OF 18.5% i~ 1982-83. WE BELIEVE SUCH<br />
GROWTH IN OUTLAYS IS APPROPR! ATE IN A SITUATION OF LOW<br />
DEMAND AND CAPACITY UTILISATION-BUT THE RATE OF INCREASE<br />
IN OUTLAYS WILL CLEARLY NEED TO BE REDUCED AS THE RECOVERY<br />
GATHERS STRENGTHTHE GOVERNMENT ALSO SOUGHT TO AVOID LARGE INCREASES<br />
IN TAXATION. THIS HAS PARTICULAR RELEVANCE TO OUR INTEREST<br />
IN ESTABLISHING A STABLE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. SUCH AN<br />
ENVIRONMENT IS VITAL IF BUSINESS IS TO INVEST AND CREATE JOB<br />
OPPORTUNITIES. ACCORDINGLY, AND SO AS TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT<br />
TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS, WE HAVE CONCENTRATED ON CL. OSING THE<br />
LOOPHOLES AND ON CORRECTING ANOMALIES IN-THE INCIDENCE OF<br />
BOTH EXCISE DUTIES AND SALES TAXES. THIS FOLLOWED SIMILAR<br />
MEASURES IN RELATION TO CORPORATE AND PERSONAL INCOME IIN THE<br />
MAY STATEMENTISHOULD PERHAPS BE MORE SPECIFIC-WE HAVE SOUGHT<br />
TO MAINTAIN THE REAL LEVEL OF EXCISE RATES ! N FUTURE YEARS<br />
WITHOUT THE DESTABILISING JUMPS IN RATES THAT HAVE OCCURRED<br />
IN THE PAST. </p>
<p>THE SMALL DISCRETE RISE IN PETROLEUM EXCISE LEAVES<br />
OUR FUEL PRICES WELL BELOW THOSE IN MOST COUNTRIES. I{ is<br />
AND I BELIEVE YOU WILL AGREE PREFERABLE TO A FURTHER RISE<br />
IN THE PROPORTION OF REVENUE RAISED BY PERSONAL OR COMPANY<br />
INCOME TAX. WE CON4SIDERED A NUMBER OF POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE<br />
TAXATION MEASURES, BUT CONCLUDED THAT THIS WAS AN AREA WHERE<br />
IS WAS PREFERABLE TO PROCEED FIRST WITH A CAREFUL<br />
EXAMINATION OF ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF IMPROVING AUSTRALIA'S<br />
TAXATION4 SYSTEM AND OF WIDENING THE REVENUE BASE.<br />
IN THE MEANTIME WE FELT COMPELLED TO TAKE SOME<br />
IMMEDIATE STEPS TO IMPROVE THE EQUITY OF THE PRESENT SYSTEMHENCE<br />
OUR MEASURES IN THE FIELDS OF SUPERANNUATION, TAX<br />
AVOIDANCE, SECTION 26( A), AND IN THE EXCISE AND SALES TAX<br />
AREASWE HAVE 1NOT HELD BACK FROM UNPOPULAR DECISIONS<br />
WHERE WE CONSIDERED THEM NECESSARY EITHER FOR NATIONAL<br />
ECONOMIC RECOVERY OR FOR ACHIEVIN4G A MORE EQUITABLE AND<br />
EFFICIENT AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY IN THE LONGER TERM-ONE IS<br />
THE ASSETS TEST.-WANT, HOWEVER, TO. ASSURE PEOPLE,<br />
PARTICULARLY ELDERLY PEOPLE, THAT ON4LY PENSIONERS WITH<br />
SUBSTANTIAL ASSETS, WHO ARE ARTIFICIALLY AVOIDING THE<br />
CURRENT INCOME TEST FOR PENSIONS, WILL BE AFFECTED IN4 ANY<br />
LARGE WAY-STRESS: WE WILL NOT BE COUNTING AS ASSETS THE<br />
PENSIONER'S HOME, CAR, BOAT, CARAVAN,. JEWELLERY, FURNITURE<br />
AND OTHER PERSONAL EFFECTS-</p>
<p>As TO OTHER ASSETS, A S! NGLE PENSIONER CAN HAVE<br />
$ 17,000 AND STILL RECEIVE THE FULL PENSION AND UP TO<br />
$ 106,000 AND STILL RECEIVE A PART-PENSION. A MARRIED COUPLE<br />
CAN HAVE $ 28,000 AND STILL. RECEIVE THE FULL PENSION AND UP<br />
TO $ 177,000 AND STILL RECEIVE PART-PENSIONAND<br />
I REPEAT: THE ASSETS TEST WILL TOTALLY EXCLUDE<br />
THE PENSIONER S HOME, CAR, BOAT, CARAVAN, JEWELLERY,<br />
FURNITUkE AND OTHER PERSONAL. EFFECTS.<br />
IN FACT MOST PENSIONERS WILL NOT BE AFFECTED AT<br />
ALL-ON OUR BEST CALCULATIONS ONLY ABOUT ONE-QUARTER OF ALL<br />
PENSIONERS WILL BE AFFECTED, AND PERHAPS ONE-THIRD OF THEM<br />
WILL BE BETTER OFF.<br />
THE ASSETS TEST WILL NOT BE INTRODUCED UNTIL, AT<br />
THE EARLIEST, NOVEMBER 1984. I ASK THE OPPOSITION TO STOP<br />
PLAYING POLITICS WITH THIS ISSUE, AND N'EEDLESSLY CAUSING<br />
ANXIETY TO PENSIONERS IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
NEVERTHELESS FURTHER HARD CHOICES AND DECISIONS CAN<br />
BE EXPECTED IN SOME AREAS EVEN AS THE RECOVERY PROCEEDS.<br />
THERE IS NO EASY WAY TO REMOVE THE DIST. ORTIONS OF THE KIND<br />
THAT HAVE DRAGGED DOWN THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY AND SOCIETY IN<br />
RECENT YEARS. THE BALANCE HAS TO BE STRUCK BETWEEN REDUCING<br />
THE BUDGET DEFICIT TO AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL, AND PROVIDING A<br />
STIMULUS TO THE ECONOMY, WHILE HELPING . THE LESS WELL-OFF IN<br />
THE COMMUNITY. </p>
<p>THE BUDGET AIMS TO REDUCE PRESSURE ON INTEREST<br />
RATES AND IS SUPPORTED BY A NON-INFLAT IONARY MONETARY<br />
POLICY. THE MONEY GROWTH TARGET ADOP-rED MAINTAINS<br />
SUFF ICIE[ NT MONETARY GROWTH TO ALLOW THE -ECONOMY TO REAL ISE<br />
ITS FULL POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH IN OUTPUT, WHILE ALLOWING FOR<br />
THE MINIMUM FEASIBLE RATE OF PRICE INCREASEOUR<br />
APPROACH TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE ECONOMY IS<br />
BASED ON OUR CONVICTION THAT STRONGER PRIVATE SECTOR<br />
ACTIVITY IS CRUCIAL TO LONG-TERM GROWTH-PUBLIC SECTOR<br />
SPENDING FIN4ANCED BY LARGE DEFICITS IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE<br />
LONG-TERM BASIS FOR GROWTH, ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE IMPORTANT IN<br />
THE SHORT TERM IN SUPPORTING ACTIVITY AND HELPING IN THE<br />
TURNAROUND TO RECOVERY.<br />
IF WE ARE TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL INROADS INTO<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA, RECOVERY MUST BE UNDERPINNED BY<br />
STRONG GROWTH IN. PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT.<br />
THAT WILL TAKE TIME TO ESTABLISH, IT IS AN<br />
IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE STILL TO BE ACHIEVED. BUSINESS<br />
INVESTMENT HAS BEEN FALLING-WHILE INVESTMENT IN DWELLINGS<br />
IS SET TO RISE STRONGLY THROUGH THE' COMING YEAR, PRIVATE<br />
SECTOR DEMAND OVERALL IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN WEAK IN THE<br />
SHORT TERM WITH BUSINESS FIXED INVESTMENT LIKELY TO RECORD A<br />
FURTHER FALL. AS AGAINST THIS THERE SEEMS LITTLE DOUBT THAT<br />
OUTPUT THIS FINANCIAL YEAR WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER<br />
THAN LAST YEAR, EVEN IT ITS GROWTH WILL BE SOMEWHAT PATCHY<br />
AND UNEVEN. </p>
<p>MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE GROUND HAS BEEN PREPARED BY<br />
OUR NEW APPROACH TO POLICY-MAKING TO ALLOW CONFIDENT<br />
LONG-TERM PLANNING BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR-CONSULTATION AND<br />
CO-OPERAT ION MUST CONT INUE ALONG THE LI NES ESTABLI SHED BY<br />
THE NATIONAL Ecor~ omic SUMMIT CONFERENCE. ACCORDINGLY THE<br />
BASE FROM WHICH NATIONAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY CAN BE LAUNCHED<br />
HAS NOW BEEN FIRMLY ESTABLISHEDWE<br />
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTEMPLATE EXPANSIONARY<br />
FISCAL AND ACCOMMODATING MONETARY POLICIES ONLY IN THE<br />
CONTEXT OF THE ACCORD WITH THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT ON<br />
PRICES AND INCOMES. THIS IS A KEY PART OF THE VERY REAL<br />
CHANGE my GOVERNMENT HAS WROUGHT IN POLICY MAKING lN<br />
AUSTRALIA. WE SEE THE REPLACEMENT OF THE CONFRONTATION WICH<br />
HAS MARRED AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY ! N RECEVJT YEARS WITH<br />
CO-OPERATION AS BEING INDISPENSIBLE FOR THE RESTORATION OF<br />
SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND FULL EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT<br />
INFLATIONOUR RECOMMENDATION TO THE ARBITRATION COMMISSION<br />
FOR A 4.3 PER CENT COST OF LIVING ' ADJUSTMENT IN THE SECOND<br />
HALF OF 1983 SHOULD BE SEEN AS INVESTMENT IN THE RETURN TO A<br />
CENTRALISED WAGE FIXATION SYSTEM AND TO FUTURE WAGE<br />
MODERATION-MAKE NO MISTAKE: IT IS A TWO-WAY ACCORD. MY<br />
GOVERNMENT EXPECTS THAT, IF ITS RECOMMENDATION IS ACCEPTED<br />
BY THE COMMISSION, THE QUID PRO QUJO OF THAT INCREASE WILL BE<br />
THAT WORKERS FOREGO THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLAIM ADDITIONAL WAGE<br />
I NCREASES-</p>
<p>THE STRONG POLITICAL POSITION OF my GOVERNMENT<br />
PROVIDES A BASIS FOR GREATER POLICY CONTINUITY THAN<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS KNOWN FOR blrNY YEARS. AND OUR SEARCH FOR<br />
CO-OPERATIVE SOLUTIONS 1ro AUS~ TRALIAN NATIONAL PROBLEMS,<br />
SYMBOLISED IN THE PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD, THE SUMMIT, AND<br />
THE PREMIERS' CONFE. RENCE, SHOULD REDUCE THE HUGE COSTS TO<br />
LONG-TERM GROWTH OF THE DEBILITATING CONFLICTS IN INDUSTRIAL<br />
RELATIONS AND THE FEDERAL-STATE AND INTER-STATE RIVALRIES<br />
THAT HAVE IMPEDED AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL GROWTH IN THE PASTIHAVE<br />
SAID BEFORE THAT IT is NOT POSSIBLE TO<br />
EXAGGERATE THE COST OF THE CONFRONTATION AND CONFLICT OF THE<br />
KIND WHICH CHARACTERISED OUR SOCIETY FOR MUCH OF THE PAST<br />
DECADE-THE COST, NOT JUST I MATERIAL TERMSNTEM<br />
OF N4ATIONAL COHESION AND PURPOSE-BELIEVE IT WAS<br />
RECOGNITION OF THE COST OF AVOIDABLE CONFLICT AND<br />
EMPHASISE AVOIDABLE CONFLICT -THAT MOTIVATED THE<br />
OVERWHELMING MAJORIJY OF THE PARTICIPA NTS AT THE SUMMIT. I<br />
THINK THIS IS A POINT WHICH WOULD BE WELL UNDERSTOOD I1N<br />
-JAPAN, WHICH ALREADY HAS A SECURE TRADITION OF CONSULTATION<br />
IN ECONOMIC DECISION-MAKINGTHE<br />
WORK OF THE SUMMIT WILL CONTINUE THROUGH EPACTHE<br />
ECONOMIC PLANNING AND ADVISORY COUNCIL. As IT DEVELOPS,<br />
EPAC's GENUINE ADVISORY ROLE WILL REINFORCE, AS PART OF THE<br />
NORMAL PROCES OF ECONOMIC DECISION-MAKING IN THIS COUNTRYTHE<br />
TWO ELEMENTS WHICH WERE THE KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THE </p>
<p>SUMMIT CONSULTATION AND KNOWLEDGE-SHARING. EPAC WILL<br />
ENSURE THAT THESE PROCESSES OF CONSULTATION AND<br />
iNFORMATIONSHARING WILL BE PLACED ON A CONTINUING BASIS,<br />
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN AUSTRALIA'S HISTORYWHAT<br />
WE HAVE DONE AND IT IS UNPRECEDENTED INAUSTRALIA<br />
IS TO ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED<br />
BASIS FIJR CONSISTENT, LONG-TERM ECONOMIC PLANNING-IN<br />
ESTABLISHING THAT ALL-EMBRACING FRAMEWORK, WE HAVE SOUGHT TO<br />
INVOLVE, ON A CONTINUING BASIS, THE RELEVANT SECTIONS OF THE<br />
COMMUNITY OTHER GOVERNMENTS, BUSINESS, INCLUDING SMALL<br />
BUSINESS, THE UNIONS, THE RURAL SECTOR, COMMUNITY GROUPSALL<br />
OF WHICH HAVE SUCH A HIGH STAKE IN THE SUCCESS OF OUR<br />
POLICIES, IN BOTH THE SHORT AND LONGER TERMMR<br />
CHAIRMAN, FOR AUSTRALIA, INTERNATIONAL F INANCIAL DEV'ELOPMENTS<br />
ARE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF LONG-TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH AS<br />
WELL AS SHORT-TERM ECONOMIC CONDITIONSWE<br />
CAN EXPECT THAT A SUSTAINED AMERICAN RECOVERY,<br />
REINFORCED AND REFLECTED IN OTHER GREAT INDUSTRIAL ECONOMIES<br />
SUCH AS JAPAN, WILL PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT BOOST TO WORLD<br />
TRADE, COMMODITY PRICES AND, ULTIMATELY INVESTMENT FLOWSEVENTUALLY<br />
THIS WILL F: LOW ON DIRECTLY INTO THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
ECONOMY, PRINCIPALLY BY WAY OF STRONGER DEMAND FOR OUR<br />
EXPORTS AND REDUCED INTERNAL PRESSURE ON OUR IMPORT<br />
COMPETING SECTORS-</p>
<p>IT IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT To AUSTRALIA THAT THE<br />
STRENGTHENING OF THE UN ITED STATES ECONOMY AND THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC RESURGANCE TO FOLLOW IN COUNTRIES<br />
SUCH AS JAPAN BE MAINTAINED.<br />
THE PERSISTANCE OF LARGE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS IN<br />
MANY COUNTRIES POSES THE BIGGEST THREAT TO THIS RECOVERYAs<br />
PRIVATE INVESTMENT PICKS UP, INTE[ REST RATES WILL<br />
INEVITABLY COME UNDER PRESSUREBUT<br />
THE TREND IN REAL INTEREST RATES ELSEWHERE IS<br />
ULTIMATELY OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL. AUSTRALIA BENEFITED FROM A<br />
DECLINE IN UNITED STATES INTEREST RATES DURING THE LAST<br />
YEAR. THAT APPEARS NOW TO HAVE CEASED, DESPITE LOW<br />
INFLATION RATES IN THE UNITED STATES ( BELOW 4% IN THE LAST<br />
YEAR)-INTEREST RATES THERE REMAIN AROUND 10% OR SO A<br />
MARGIN OVER INFLATION OF AS MUCH AS THERE IS THUS A<br />
REAL RISK THAT THE LON4G EXPECTED CLA* SH IN THE UNITED STATES<br />
BETWEEN PRIVATE SECTOR RECOVERY AND : CONTINUING LARGE FISCAL<br />
DEFICITS MAY BRING ABOUT FURTHER RISES IN THE REAL AMERICAN<br />
INTEREST RATES IN THE COMING YEARTHIS<br />
HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS NOT ONLY FOR<br />
WHETHER RECOVERY IS SUSTAINED IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT ALSO<br />
FOR WHETHER INTEREST RATES IN OTHER INDUSTRALIZED COUNTRIES<br />
WILL PERMI1T A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMEN T IN PRIVATE SECTOR<br />
INVESTMENT AND WHETHER DEVELOPING NATIONS WILL HAVE IMPROVED<br />
CAPACITY FOR DEBT SERVICING. </p>
<p>1<br />
THERE IS ALSO THE DIFFICULTY OF ENSURING THE<br />
CONDITIONS FOR GLOBAL ECONOM IC RECOVERY( AND TRADE EXPANS ION<br />
WILL BE MUTUALLY REINFORCING THE MULTITUDE OF BARRIERS TO<br />
INTERNATIONAL TRADE ESTABLISHED DURING THE RECESSION MUST BE<br />
CONFRON4TED IF A STRONG EXPANS ION OF MAJOR I NDUSTR IAL<br />
ECONOMIES IS TO BE ACHIEVEDLONG-<br />
TERM IMPROVEMEN4T IN AUSTRALIAN LIVING<br />
CONDITIONS IS ONLY FEASIBLE IF WE ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OPEN<br />
INVESTMENT AND TRADE POLICIES-INDEED THE RECOVERY NOW<br />
STARTING COULD WELL BE THWARTED IF THE SPIRIT QF A4 LIBERAL<br />
MULTILATERAL TRADING SYSTEM CANNOT BE RESTOREDAS<br />
A MAJOR TRADING NATION AUSTRALIA HAS A<br />
PARTICULAR INTEREST IN SUSTAINING AND DEVELOPING CONDITIONS<br />
FOR MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL TRADE. NOWHERE IS THIS MORE<br />
IMPORTANT FOR AUSTRALIAN THAN IN ITS, TRADE RELATIONSHIP WITH<br />
JAPAN. THAT RELATIONSHIP MUST BE REVITALIZED AN D<br />
DIVERS I FIEDACCOUNTING FOR 27% OF OUR TOTAL EXPORTS AND 20% OF<br />
OUR TOTAL IMPORTS, JAPAN MUST BULK ' LARGE IN ANY ASSESSMENT<br />
OF AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC INTEREST. IMPORTANT STRUCTURAL<br />
CHANGES HAVE TAKEN PLACE, HOWEVER, IN THE JAPANESE ECONOMYWE<br />
MUST RECOGNISE AND ADJUST TO0 THE IMPLICATIONS FOR<br />
AUSTRALIA-</p>
<p>LOWER, THOUGH STILL SIGNIFICAI GROWTH RATES IN<br />
JAPAN, AND A REALIGNMENT OF JAPANESE ENERGY AND INDUSTRY<br />
POLICIES ARE OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE ro AUSTRALIAMOST<br />
IMPORTANTLY, THE GROWTH PROSPECTS FOR<br />
AUSTRALIAN RAW MATERIAL EXPORTS TO JAPAN, ARE DIMINISHEDALTERNATIVE<br />
SUPPLEMENTARY MARKETS MUST BE SOUGHT AND, WITH<br />
JAPAN, NEW GROWTH SECTORS WE CAN PROFITABLY SUPPLY<br />
IDENTIFIEDMy GOVERNMENT IS KEEN TO BREAK DOWN UNNECESSARY<br />
BARRIERS TO THE EXPANSION OF TRADE. FOR~ EXAMPLE, THE<br />
RATIONALIZATION OF FISCAL ARRANGEMENTS IN THE COAL INDUSTRY,<br />
AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF COAL EXPORT INFRASTRUCTURES, WOULD<br />
HELP AUSTRALIAN PRODUCERS' EFFORTS TO SECURE NEW AND<br />
ADDITIONAL RAW MATERIAL EXPORT OUTLETS-PROGRESS IN THESE<br />
AND MANY OTHER AREAS REQUIRES CO-OPERATION BETWEEN FEDERAL<br />
AND STATE GOVERNIgENTS. THE ATMOSPHERE FOR SUCH CO-OPERATION<br />
HAS IMPROVED RECENTLY, AS SYMBOLIZED IN THE AGREEMENT AT THE<br />
PREMIERS' CONFERENCE. BUT THERE IS-A LONG WAY TO GOTHE<br />
SCOPE FOR AUSTRALIAN PENETRATION OF PREVIOUSLY<br />
UNTESTED JAPANESE HIGH GROWTH SECTORS HAS USEFULLY BEEN4<br />
ENHANCED BY THE RECENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN MR BOWEN AND<br />
JAPANESE MINISTERS TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE AIMED AT<br />
EXAMINING CONCRETE WAYS OF ASSISTING AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURES<br />
AND OTHER EXPORTERS TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES AND MEANS OF<br />
PENETRATING THE JAPANESE MARKET-. </p>
<p>14.<br />
IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, HOVEVER, MUCH GREATER<br />
RESOURCEFULNESS AND IMAGINATiON WILL BE NEEDED IF THE<br />
ECONO'MIC AND TRADING REALTIOINSHIP WITH JAPAN IS TO REALIZE<br />
ITS FULL POTENTIALTHE SAME IS TRUE MORE GENERALLY OF OUR TRADING<br />
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COUNTRIES OF THE PACIFIC Rim. WHILE<br />
THEIR S;. ARE OF AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS HAS RISEN FROM 37% IN<br />
1961/ 62 TO 55% IN 1981/ 82, THE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE<br />
CHARACTER OF THOSE MARKETS COMBINED WITH THE MAJOR<br />
OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATIVELY HIGH GROWTH<br />
RATES MANY OF THEM HAVE SUSTAINED, PUTS PARTICULAR PRESSURE<br />
ON THE INGENUITY AND DRIVE QF AUSTRALIAN EXPORTERS.<br />
IN THIS REGARD SUGGESTIONiS FOR FURTHER ECONOMIC<br />
CO-OPERATION AND EXPANSION OF TRADE AMONG THE COUNTRIES OF<br />
THE PACIFIC REGION ARE RELEVANT. SUCH SUGGESTIONS STEM<br />
FROM: A WISH TO MAXIMISE THE BENEFITS OF THE ECONOMIC<br />
INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES OF THE<br />
REGION; RECOGNITION OF IMPLICATIONS FOR THE REGION OF THE<br />
FORMATION AND CONSOLIDATION OF THE EUROPEAN<br />
ECONOMIC COMMUNITY, AND </p>
<p>INTEREST IN PROMOTING THE PACIFIC REGION AS A NEW<br />
u" ENGINE FOR I NTERNAT I ONAL ECONOM IC GROWTH AND<br />
DEVELOPMENT"-<br />
WHILE SPECIFIC IDEAS ABOUT HOW CO-OPERATIONJ MIGHT<br />
BEST BE PROMOTED STILL AWAIT FURTHER REFINEMENT; THE<br />
UNDERLYING THRUST OF THIS INTEREST IS FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH<br />
OUR OWN FOREIGN POLICY AND ECONOMIC GOALS. AN MOVE TOWARDS<br />
CLOSER ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION IN THE PACIFIC WOULD OF COURSE<br />
NEED TO BE NON-DISCRIMINATORY AND THEREFORE CONS ISTENT WITH<br />
OUR WIDER INTERNATIONAL OBJECTIVESYET<br />
IF REGIONAL CO-OPERATIVE ECONOMIC AND TRADING<br />
RELATIONS COULD BE PUT ON A FIRMER FOOTING THE BENEFITS TO<br />
EACH AND EVERY COUNTRY CONCERNED WOULD'SEEM INDISPUTABLETHE<br />
TIMELINESS OF ACTION AIMED AT<br />
INSTITUTIONALISING ANY SUCH INTEREST AND THE RECEPTIVITY OF<br />
KEY PART IC IPANTS TO ARRANGEMENTS OF ANY K IND NEVERTHELESS<br />
SHOULD BE MOST CAREFULLY CONSIDERED-INITIATIVES IU THIS<br />
AREA COULD OTHERWISE PROVE OUITE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.<br />
THIS IS NOT TO RULE SUCH INITIATIVES OUT OF COURTIN~<br />
AUSTRALIA, WITH my GOVERNMENT'S FIRST BUDGET AND<br />
FOLLOWING THE TREASURER'S MAY 19 STATEMENT WE HAVE ACHIEVED<br />
A TRANSFORMATION A TRANSFORMATION IN POLICY EMPHASIS, IN<br />
THE APPROACH TO ECONOMIIC DE. CISION-MAKINJG, AND IN THE MEANS </p>
