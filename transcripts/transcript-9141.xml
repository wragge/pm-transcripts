TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KIZATINQ MP<br />
RADIO SWP, RIUCHARD UTTING I MARCH 1II4<br />
E AND OE PROOF ONLY<br />
= T~ NO: Will her resignation finish this affair clo you think?<br />
PM; I think so, If' s sntlally a Canberra poitical dust storm Which I think<br />
Ros Kelly graclousiy hosed down yesterday and I think It More Is any lesson to be<br />
loorned out of this the House of Representatives Cgmmlttee sold In its report that In<br />
.11 future grants programs, this Is a grant progiram, there ought to be a sort of<br />
schedule of appicatins that evaluates such projects and contains<br />
recommendations to guide the ministes decisions. Now I think that I&amp; probably<br />
right and that some good Will come from It<br />
UTTING; But Paul that should have been obvious some weelks ago and No<br />
been a running sore as far as the Government Is oonoerned, hasn't it<br />
PM. Well except thet things of course were z0 dsAffbuted last year and<br />
the year before that so Whot'l dlStubut$ 4 can't be undistilbuted but essentilly tee<br />
were relatvely small grants to amateur sporting organisations and you know there<br />
has got to be some basis of evaluation. Now the evaluation was done by the<br />
minister herself, whet the committee looking at this taid, well she should do It may<br />
be but the administration should largely be Vith the department and well I think<br />
tat' something we can take note of from this episode. The main thing Is that there<br />
was no fraud involved In tttl. no Impropriety because these monies had to be<br />
expended -befbre they woerahibursed. Oet a lot of programs, monies are<br />
expanded to the U1mit and they are not then fully spent, well spent This one, the<br />
local people had to spend the money and only after it was spent were they<br />
reirnbursed by the Commonwealth so therefore Mie oceoson at fr~ ud was very<br />
diminished, There IS no Indication, no hint of fraud or Impropdety Just In a sernse<br />
dIssatisfact~ on with the way In which, with the ministees choice.<br />
UTTI NG: It does appear that Labor. marginal -Labo electorates were favoured<br />
by the allocation of gnnmts.<br />
PM: I Well mostly Labor marginal electorates have a dearth of these sort of<br />
fucilitie6, rietball courts and basketall courts end what have you whereas<br />
established areas, you know your sort of Peppemnt Grove&amp; and Dalkeiths, and<br />
these sort of areas have got these things and they don't need them.<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL.: Mar. 94 13: 23 No. 019 P. 02/ 03<br />
2. LrrTING; It surely means that there should be Proper guldelind3 for the<br />
allocation of thiese grants s0 that there Is no perception of poflica Wias-.<br />
PM: Yes well thats a point I think In a sense I was making a moment ago<br />
In refenlng to what the House of Rpreentatves Commite, said was this. in all<br />
fMure grants programs there ought to provide a schedule of application that<br />
evaluates the proposed pruJects and contains recommendations to guide the<br />
ministers decuisone, In other words the minister Is just not sittng there himself or<br />
herself saying yea or may to this one or that one.<br />
IJTTING; But as Prime Minister Paul, you should have been aware of the<br />
problems In this program some time ago and doneO something to remedy ft.<br />
PM: Well the program lhes had great popular support Richard, You take<br />
any of the sporting dlubs. I mean I sad the other day the way the Liberal Party haed<br />
beaten up this thing you would mwar blind It was a terrlble thing to give money to<br />
amsaur spairting dlubs. How does on amateu ' r sporting club that is looking for a<br />
notball court or a basketball court or a bowling groen or call It what you like, raise<br />
that sort of money, under what programs do ty get ft? Now as I said this thing<br />
has a lot of virtue this program, a tremeindous amount of virtue. So It's really only<br />
with t process of evaluation end not the program of t essence. The Liberal<br />
Party put no money Into sport, never, they put peanuts In the 70s, they had two and<br />
three million, we have got sort of sixty, eighty Million dollars a year going Into sport<br />
now, that's both into elit, sport and Into amateur sport. They have attacked all<br />
these programs as If ther Is something terribl, about giving funds to amateur<br />
sporting themes whic I think are the salt of the earth type orgmnisations to give<br />
funds to and therefore they don't really cam about areas which have been deprived<br />
or groups who ara financlally strapped who have had these programs made<br />
available to them. I think you have always got to keep an eye on what Is basically a<br />
decet policy mnollvaton.<br />
UTTING: Now you stood by Roo Kelly for a long Orme ever this. ' Met was the<br />
straw that broke the earners back?<br />
PM: The likelihood Is that she would have probably faced continuing<br />
questioning about this and the House of Represetatives Committee cAine down<br />
end sald there was adminIstrtve deficiencies In t way In which these wore<br />
Issued but they made ft quite clear there was no frud or no Impropriety, so she<br />
would have had that to deal with and of eourse we had t Opposifion with their<br />
Piinka in the Senate. so It may have gone on for much longer at her expense. I<br />
think that was her decision but Richard I thinK its worth concentrating on this point.<br />
The real story in today's papers I* the penl of The Austalin and this Is what Is<br />
running the Liberal Pa" t. I wAl just read you the first paragraph It says, despite the<br />
Coalition's politeal success In forebig the resignation of the cabinet miniser over " i<br />
so called spoats torts afar, voter dIssaifacton with the Leader of the Oppositon<br />
Dr Hewson has reached an all time highi.----<br />
LifTING: This Is the whole point Isn't kt you nlow can take the attack up to the<br />
Opposition rather than having t1he hoomorrtaging 0f tne &amp; pan&amp; s rtn thing distrctng<br />
evelytIng. TEL: </p>
<p>TEL<br />
3, PM: That's right I spenlt last Friday in Hobart w" t? the Premiers putting<br />
together what was a lanidmark~ change In the adoption of competon policy within<br />
ths great Overnment buisiness enterprises of this country, that Is the electricity<br />
authorities, the water authorities, the ports, all of thees orgaisatione. Now tais.<br />
huge change, they have always been cosattad these organlsatloris. They charge<br />
mostly monopoly prices, you could sM whom the Commonwealth Imtrouced<br />
competition Into telecommunications West Australians would nodie most particuany<br />
how STD prices have come down to the rst of Australia because of competition to<br />
Telecom. We In the Federal Government have been tyilng to got t States to<br />
agree to competitin within those Mtate authorifies. This was agreed In prl~ pie last<br />
Friday In Hobart Now it Is these matters of substance Richard, like the other thing<br />
we are doing now, looking at the Wog term unemployed which maters and The<br />
Australian poll Is basicall right Wile ever the Oppositon wants to basically get<br />
Involved In Canberra dust storms of this variety thiey have not been able to translatel<br />
it Into any political success and the poll published this morning basicaly would mean<br />
that If we went to an election this week the Government would win.<br />
LITTING: Now talkIng about peraps not long term unemployed but someone<br />
who Is taking it a bit easy I guess, whers Ros Kellys political future now?<br />
PM: she win remin a member of the House of -Representative. for<br />
Canbeirr which Is the prImary role a person In Paiament has and she can just<br />
make het own mind up then about what she thinks, what she wants her career<br />
prospects to be. But she has been a very aignificlant Minister for the Envirnment<br />
ane of the core matters agreed upon lost Friday was lhe adoption at the Council of<br />
Austral Ian Qlovermmnt tt Is the Commonwealt and the States of standards for'<br />
air and water uality and nwo pollution which ame care environmental mattr.. The<br />
quality of water and th. quality of alt and national standards, This It one of the<br />
things that thi country needed, this is someth'ing, a milestone thing she negotiated<br />
as environment minister so silo has haed a very Important career In public life had<br />
four year* as Ministeir for the Environment In Cabinet and chalked up great<br />
succeuses and most particlarly last Friday the very day she was under attack,<br />
