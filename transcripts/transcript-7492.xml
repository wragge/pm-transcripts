TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, FATEHPUR SIKRI, AGRA 11 FEBRUARY<br />
1989 E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you left Canberra hopeful of<br />
opening all sorts of doors for Australian business on this<br />
trip. Have you succeeded?<br />
SPM: Yes, in each of the countries we've been. In the<br />
Republic of Korea and Thailand and Pakistan and India<br />
without any question there are very very many more<br />
opportunities now. In fact, during the course of the visit<br />
specific contracts have been signed and accelerated even<br />
beyond the expectations that we had when we left.<br />
JOURNALIST: You were critical of Australian businessmen in<br />
Thailand for not making advantage of the window of<br />
opportunity that they had. Do you think that this visit is<br />
going to make them do so or are they going to fall back into<br />
bad old habits?<br />
PM: I think that this will have a useful impact upon them.<br />
Certainly those who've been with us on the trip, the<br />
businessmen, have seen the opportunities that are there.<br />
The fortunate thing is that in all of these countries, and<br />
particularly here, including in India, we've got the impetus<br />
from the top. My counterpart in each of the countries that<br />
I've visited is equally committed as I am to the stimulation<br />
of the trading relationship between our two countries. , So<br />
it won't be a transient thing at the Australian level. Our<br />
impetus will remain and in each of these countries from the<br />
Prime Minister down through the bureaucracy, I think there<br />
now is a commitment to enhancing the relationship. So the<br />
opportunity is there for Australian businessmen in each of<br />
these countries. There is growth in each of them, economic<br />
growth, growing population, and in each of these countries<br />
the opportunity not only of the substantial market of the<br />
countries themselves but as a base for the regions around<br />
them. Very great opportunities.<br />
JOURNALIST: Considering the competition that we've got<br />
though from Japan and the United States, do you think we're<br />
up to it, we can do it? </p>
<p>2<br />
PM: I don't think we have to speculate about that. Take<br />
the case here in India with the contract that we were<br />
seeking for the significant development of the Seabird naval<br />
project here. We had tough competition from that, the<br />
French, and we've beaten them. So we should because we're<br />
better. JOURNALIST: Has that been confirmed?<br />
PM: I think you'll find that we're there.<br />
