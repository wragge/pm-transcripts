PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
BEFORE LEAVING FOR OVERSEAS 27 OCTOBER 1971<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T.<br />
Q. Now that* China's in the United Nations, Sir., how<br />
does this affect our dialogue with Peking? Does it mean that<br />
we'll have to move-quicker towards recognition of the Chinese<br />
Government?<br />
PM No, I don't think it does. I think it would create<br />
a bad impression with the Chinese if it looked as though we<br />
were over-anxious to respond. In any event, I think it's now<br />
become common gossip that there have been discussions in Hong Kong<br />
about the possibility of closer trade relations. I've said before<br />
that we'll proceed cautiously, and trying to ensure that at each<br />
step that each step taken is to the advantage of this country.<br />
I'm sure it's better to handle this carefully, particularly as the<br />
People's Republic are a very careful people, Ney take their time<br />
over making decisions.<br />
Q. Sir, how far off would you think recognition is, within<br />
months, or years?<br />
PM Nobody can make an appre-ciation, because the rapidity<br />
-of. the movement will depend very largely on the actions of the<br />
V Government of the People's Republic.<br />
Q. You mentioned the talks in Hong Kong, Prime Minister,<br />
can you tell us what the outcome of those talks was?<br />
PM No. Because while it has been agreed that I can<br />
go as far as I have gone this morning, we've been consistently warned<br />
that the prudent course is to day as little as possible.<br />
Q. Is there any possibility of a trade mission qoing-to<br />
China this year?<br />
PM I don't know. I. </p>
<p>. PM How long has this been going on Sir, weeks or months?<br />
It depends what you mean. Talks have taken place<br />
in several areas as well as Hong Kong.<br />
Sir; has your Government decided in principle that<br />
it wants to recognise China?<br />
We've decided to commence a dialogue to improve the<br />
relationships between the two countries, we have gone no further.<br />
Will you pursue this on your visit overseas, for<br />
example I expect the Chinese will be seated at the United Nations<br />
by the time you get there. Willyou try....<br />
That is doubtful, very doubtful.<br />
I wondered if as you are in the United States....<br />
No I would not, because my timetable is full. I want<br />
to be back here for the last three weeks of the House, or for the<br />
opening of the next three weeks Session, and this is a subject that<br />
could not be raised. Will you come back ready to make a statement to the<br />
House., Sir? On China?<br />
On your mission generally.<br />
Yes, of course I will. t<br />
Sir, could you tell us your itinerary?<br />
I understood that Reg MacDonald had given yo~ u a<br />
document setting up an itinerary in some detail.<br />
Reg MacDonald: RIegt ' sac ~ oianld : the boxes now Sir. </p>
<p>3.<br />
On the economy 7<br />
PM Now wait a minute, can I finish this one. Also<br />
I've asked Mr. MacDonald to give you a list of the people who'll<br />
be travelling with me. That will be available this morning, if<br />
it's not in the boxes already It is in the boxes already,<br />
and I will be drawing on the assistance of Dr. Coombs not in<br />
matters that involve him in the arts and similar matters, but as<br />
a kind of guiding philosopher, if there's any problems I feel<br />
he can make a contribution about.<br />
The international monetary crisis Sir?<br />
PM That will be not I'm-not going to go to any<br />
details about what I will ask him to do, but he'll be ready<br />
to give advice if I want him to give it. over there, and with<br />
me I'll have technical experts with me, who I think are as well<br />
up in the problems of the international monetary problems as<br />
I could want to get.<br />
Q. Sir, why are you taking Dr. Coombs specifically<br />
then. It seems very unusual.<br />
PM Is it. I've just explained to you why I ' ye done<br />
it and I go no further than that.<br />
Q. Sir, who will you be seeing over there who's<br />
connected with the Arts. We haven't seen your itinerary, who<br />
will you be seeing who's connected with the Arts in America<br />
and Britain.<br />
PM Well I didn't-say with the arts necessarily, over<br />
a wide range of subjects. I value his advice very much. I've<br />
been able to use his advice to very good effect over the course<br />
of the last few months, and I'll continue-to use it.<br />
Is this going to be a permanent role for Dr. Coombs<br />
sort of a roving adviser? </p>
<p>PM I will be using Dr. Coombs' advice in the future<br />
to a considerable extent.<br />
Q. Will he become Australia's Dr. Kissinger Sir?<br />
PM I would use his advice to the maximum, 1 and I believe<br />
I can use him in the interests of the Australian people.<br />
0. Will he have a position within the Public Service,<br />
or will it just be as an outside adviser?<br />
PM He's already got a position with the various positions<br />
with the Aborigines and the Arts. That will be supplemented<br />
he will supplement those activities. Giving advice to me when I<br />
think it is desirable.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, it has been suggested that Sir John<br />
McEwen might take on some sort of<br />
PM I haven't heard it. I haven't heard it<br />
Look what are we doing with this. I'm going away on a momentous<br />
visit. Are we going to turn it into a somewhat frivolous exercise<br />
or are we going to try and deal with things that are of great<br />
importance to this country. Now I want to remind you that on the<br />
last occasion that I had one, the then Chairman had to say to me<br />
that we didn't conduct them in a way that really warranted repetitior<br />
I please ask you if you want me to go on consistently giving them,<br />
can we keep them to what is relevant and what's important.<br />
Q. Can I bring up an important matter Sir. Our correspond<br />
ent in Washington reports today that President Nixon will ask you to<br />
send Australian military advisers to Cambodia to train the Cambodian<br />
Army. He also says that the Americans have secretly sounded out<br />
the Australian Government on this matter. Could you tell me.<br />
PM To the best of my knowledge there has been nIo secret<br />
sounding out of the Australian Government, and I believe I would<br />
have known as soon as anyone. Secondly, I have not heard any<br />
suggestion that we would be asked to make a contribution of a trainin </p>
<p>TEAM or instructors to Cambodia. It is hypothetical, and I can't,<br />
give answers to hypothetical questions. l<br />
Q. Mr. McMahon you've described your visit your<br />
coming visit as a momentous visit. Could you outline to us the<br />
principle things you hope to achieve'while you're overseas?<br />
PM I've said in the first conference that I've had<br />
here, that I would not be trying to forecast what is likely to<br />
happen. In the first place, we haven't got a precise agenda for<br />
the meetings. But what I did say at the last meeting that the<br />
press have been pretty close in its speculation about the kind<br />
of event that had occurred and would establish the foundations<br />
on which discussions could take place. Both in Washington, and<br />
in London. I'll go no further than that.<br />
0. Mr. McMahon, do you expect that by the time you get<br />
back, Cabinet will be able to make a firm decision on the parity<br />
question. The Australian dollar?<br />
PM I don't know. Nobody could tell you.<br />
0. It's a possibility though?<br />
PM It's a possibility. Angthing's a possibility. But<br />
I think you know as well as anyone that the critically important<br />
factor is for the major countries the dominant countries in the<br />
international monetary markets at the moment particularly the<br />
Japan, the Germans. It is critically important that they<br />
come to some arrangement as to parities which are likely to stand<br />
ov~ r a considerable period. Until these parities are established<br />
it is difficult if not impracticable for any other country to<br />
try and establish a rate which can be continued over a long period.<br />
0. Can we give any consideration to. a temporary<br />
arrangement between the yen and the Australian dollar pendin g the<br />
long term solution?<br />
PM No, I stand by what I said in the House. ' There'll<br />
be no alternation to the policy decision the policy decisions </p>
<p>TO DEAL WITH THIS interim phase -not change whatsoever.<br />
Q. Are you likely to go to Japan to discuss this?<br />
PM No, I will not have time to. I'll just have<br />
time to go to the United States, the United Kingdom and then<br />
come straight home.<br />
Q. You'd agree that the parity question apropos the<br />
yen and the Australian dollar, is probably more important than<br />
sterling and the Australian dollar. What would be your principal<br />
mission in the UK. then Sir?<br />
PM First of all, I've already answered the question,<br />
I don't think the critical one, or the only one is the change<br />
in parities between the yen and the Australian dollar. I donot<br />
think that it is practicable to have a solution between two countries.<br />
There has to be a general rearrangement of parities and that is k<br />
what the Group of Ten and the I. M. F. are trying to achieve. But<br />
not necessarily fixed parities there can be a greater tolerance<br />
than previously.<br />
Q. Will you have time to Go to Brussells Sir.<br />
PM None at all.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, you describe your trip as momentous<br />
Why do you use that word, why do you think it's momentous.<br />
PM Because it's momentous in a sense that these are<br />
momentous occasions. There have been big changes in the United<br />
Nations, there's been the initiation of visits by the President<br />
to the People's Republic. He will also pay a visit to Moscow.<br />
He will be making another announcement on policy relating to further<br />
withdrawals of Amercian troops from South Vietnam. The British are<br />
re ady to enter into the European Community. If these are not<br />
momentous occasions, then other people have got differences of<br />
opinion from mine. What I will be doing is being in Washington </p>
<p>and in London at a time when so many decisions are being made<br />
about the future course of events in the areas I've mentioned.<br />
Sir, you announced a couple of economic measures<br />
yesterday, can you foresee other measures being announced while<br />
you are away?<br />
PM I won't go any further than that, but I would like<br />
to emphasise this. That fundamentally the Australian economy<br />
is strong. We've said it before, and it can bear repeating. That<br />
what was said yesterday was dealing with marginal problems, but<br />
directly oriented towards showing that we would take action in<br />
these areas where we thought it was desirable but above all, to<br />
establish the degree of confidence which is so essential in order<br />
to achieve the purposes set by the Budget. -Confidence is the most<br />
important element we need in the community today.<br />
Q. Could Cabinet take any decisions if it felt it was<br />
necessary on the economy?<br />
PM of course it could. But I think they would also<br />
consult me before they took them. But when a Prime Minister is<br />
out of the country the Government of the country remains with the<br />
Cabinet.<br />
Q. There were some new building figures released<br />
yesterday, Prime Minister. Were these brought to your attention,<br />
they did appear to be quite disturbing in that they've got a very<br />
high rate of non-residential building for the second month in<br />
a row.<br />
PM IWe've already emphasised that in the HOuse. We knew<br />
of the trend that is occurring., But there is also outside informatioi<br />
which seems to indicate, however reliable it might be, and I make<br />
no judgment about how reliable it is, that the phase might be<br />
starting to slow down. I see no evidence of: c* it yet.<br />
Q. I see. Because last February I think, one of the things<br />
that the Government intended to do was to dampen down this office<br />
building by attempting to get overseas investors to consult with<br />
Treasury.... nothing was done about this because it seemed to be </p>
<p>dying out.<br />
PM Are you sure that not~ hing was done?<br />
0. I thought you said in the House...<br />
PM No I didnt say that nothing was done, I said. that...<br />
when you say that nothing was done, it depends what you mean<br />
Q. The Government took no action.<br />
qM That's right it took no action, because it found that<br />
it was not ynt due in any substantial extent to overseas investment<br />
It's purely a domestic matter.* And I dont know of any easy means<br />
that you can take in order to see that in these commercial and<br />
industrial buildings that you can slow down construction too<br />
quickly. In the public area of course, as you know we severely<br />
restricted the rate of growth of the action by the States, and<br />
we have substantially restrained Commonwealth expenditure too.<br />
Q. You're not taking any direct action therefore, as you<br />
say it's difficult to suggest one. I was just wondering if there was<br />
anything you were contemplating.<br />
SM Well isn't it a little bit peculiar that we've heard<br />
some people say recently that there is no inflation, and here are<br />
you in one area now urging that separate action should be tdken. NO<br />
at the moment it's not a matter that I can discuss in any great<br />
detailL. If you want to get a more full answer on this, you should<br />
ask thie Treasurer.<br />
Q. Sir, in Washington, will you be looking at the<br />
effectiveness of the wage and price freeze that President Nixon's<br />
imposed?<br />
PM I've been... Qf course we'vye given a lot of consideration<br />
to them. But I'd be fairly certain, other than unless it happened<br />
to rise casually, but I wouldn't be discussing these matters with<br />
President. </p>
<p>Q. But you are meeting Mr. Connally though aren't you<br />
PM I have doubts about meeting Connally, but I will be<br />
meeting other people from the Treasury, I understand Mr. Con~ lly<br />
will probably/ 86er seas.<br />
Q. You're likely to discuss the effect of the<br />
surcharge on imports the effect on Australia?<br />
PM I've said a few moments ago I'm not prepared to<br />
forecast what I might be discussing with President Nixon. I thinkit<br />
would be bad politics, I think it would be bad tactics to<br />
start....<br />
Inaudible<br />
PM I wouldn't be prepared if I do something there,<br />
I will certainly let those members of the press who are present<br />
with me, know to the maximum I can what has taken place.<br />
Q. In Westminster Sir, will you raise the question<br />
of the E. E. C. transition-&amp;-period effecting Australia?<br />
PM I have no doubt at all that that will be one<br />
of the subjects raised.<br />
Q. Any new proposals to put to the British Government?<br />
PM I've said three or four minutes ago, that I will<br />
not under any circumstance try and forecast what proposals I'd<br />
be likely to put, or for that matter what the what was likely<br />
to be said to me. I'd rather keep those until I know what the<br />
results of the discussions are, and what kind of result is likely<br />
to emerge from them.<br />
0. Sir, on the wage and price freeze just to clarify<br />
it. I think you said you'd considered what had been done ine the<br />
States. Does that mean that you've looked at the possibility<br />
of doing it here? Has it gone that far? </p>
<p>PM NO.<br />
Q. Does the idea appeal to you?<br />
PM We have a totally different system to them. As I've<br />
tried to say that ~ If you look at the Australian position, basically<br />
our problem at the moment resides first of all around what we<br />
call wage/ cost inflation. We have an Arbitration Court they have<br />
haven't got one. And we have a constitutional restriction on our<br />
power that they haven't got. The difference between the two<br />
economies are substantial. In the Budget we took action to try<br />
and prevent I've gone through this story before, but to prevent<br />
9 demand inflation superimposing itself on cost inflation. I can't<br />
go any further than that at the moment. But the Treasurer's<br />
remaining here, if you want-to get any further action on the<br />
economy, and details of it, ask him. And here, if I can, I'd<br />
make one point. I am a great believer in a Cabinet System of<br />
government ministerial responsibility. I want as afar as I can<br />
ensur&amp; it, that questions of details of this kind should be directed.<br />
to the Treasurer. He's well capable of being able to understand<br />
them. not only understand them, but answer them.<br />
Q. Mr. McMahon could you give us any back ground on<br />
W why it's taken the Attorney-General's Department almost two months<br />
to decide on the legality of the Tariff Board using outside<br />
consultants? And could you tell us further if they decide that it<br />
0 is illegal, would the Government be prepared to legislate to make<br />
PM it legal?<br />
PM First, I can't tell you why the Law Department has<br />
taken so long, other than/ tlI have been considering it for some<br />
time. It's apparently a difficult legal problem, and you'd<br />
have to ask the lawyers why. The Attorney would give you the<br />
answer I'm sure. Secondly, to the second part of your question<br />
I gave the answer in the House the other day. </p>
