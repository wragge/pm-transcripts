EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY ( APPROX. 7: 30 PM)<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ. KEAING MP,<br />
TO THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW DINNER, SYDNEY,<br />
19 AUGUST 1992<br />
My long experience of this forum is that many of you will have questions to put to me<br />
about our economic strate y, and I want to leave as much time as I can to answer them<br />
after dinner. But I do want to say something now about the thinking behind the Budget,<br />
and what it means for our future.<br />
All Budgets are significant, but this one is uniquely so, because it marks the beginning of<br />
a new phase of economic reform in Australia.<br />
Certainly the Budget is our annual financial statement and our annual forecast for the<br />
economy. It does the things Budgets always do, and no doubt you will be quizzing me on<br />
the forecasts and other numbers later.<br />
But this Budget is also a declaration.<br />
It is a statement of some of our principal policy goals for the nineties and what we will do<br />
to attain those goals.<br />
If I can put it in the most general way, I would say that our policy and material resources<br />
as a government will be focused on enhancing the value of the work we do in our shops,<br />
offices, factories, mines and farms throughout Australia, now and into the future.<br />
We want to improve the quality of our workforce, and the way in which it is used.<br />
In this next stage of reform we have four priorities:<br />
1400 </p>
<p>to create good jolbs and get the unemployed back into productive work<br />
to improve the training opportunities for people new to the workforce, and<br />
retraining opportunities for those already in the workforce.<br />
to encourage a wholesale transition into w aieargainingb etween the parties<br />
as the principal industrial relationship in this country.<br />
to continue the redesign of Australian indiustry so it provides the right jobs for a<br />
more highly skilled and productive workforce.<br />
The priority today is uremploymrent, not only because it is good economics but because it<br />
is the right thing to'do.<br />
It is the unemployed who are disproportionately bearing the cost of changes like<br />
disinflation, productivity improvements and a more diverse industrial composition from<br />
which the rest of us benefit.<br />
It is the unemployed who are bearing the consequences of the world wide asset price<br />
unwinding of the late eighties.<br />
So we do this because it is our responsibility to the unemployed, because as Australians<br />
we want to move forward together.<br />
But as unemployment comes down we will continue to invest in ourselves, because<br />
improving the quality of the workforce is the best investment we can make in meeting and<br />
beating global competition.<br />
It is at the heart of our economic strategy for the nineties and beyond.<br />
Over the next two years we will give the young a better chance and Australia a brighter<br />
future. We offer every teenager who has not found a job within a year a vocational training<br />
course of at least six months, with a job subsidy at the end. By the end of next year we<br />
plan to have given learning and job chances to at least 100 000 kids who might otherwise<br />
be the long term unemployed adults of tomorrow.<br />
We will enhance the skills of young Australians now, and we are putting in place the<br />
programs to continue to enhance them through the decade.<br />
Through the. new. Australian National Training Authority, through pilot programs to<br />
inrouihe e uaiy rinn i ndsry, Throug a higher level of funding we will<br />
entrench the commitment by creating a stronger and better vocational training system.<br />
1401 </p>
<p>We have already increased the number of young people staying on to the end of secondary<br />
school from three in ten when we came to office to seven in ten. The number of<br />
Commonwealth-funded university places will have increased by half between 1983 and<br />
1994. Ten years ago 349,000 people were participating in university and college<br />
education. Today the number is 559,000.<br />
Now its time for vocational training.<br />
We will give young Australians a better chance, and we will give adult Australians a<br />
second chance.<br />
This year we will offer around 200,000 training places unemployed adults, targeted<br />
especially at those who have not found a job within a year. We have doubled the number<br />
of places under our wage subsidy program to over 100,000 in 1992-93, to help in the<br />
transition between retraining and a job.<br />
In regions that have been particularly hard hit by the downturn, we will create jobs as well<br />
as offer training programs. We will spend $ 345 million with 411 Local Government<br />
Councils, funding a refit of regional and community facilities. We will also create jobs in<br />
a program which combines training and paid work experience for unemployed adults.<br />
Young unemployed people will receive direct job assistance in programs to improve the<br />
environment. We will enhance the skills of adult Australians now, and continue enhancing them over<br />
the decade.<br />
As our industry becomes more complex, training and retraining throughout our working<br />
lives will become as customary as repainting the house.<br />
What we do in workforce training will be complemented by changes in work practices and<br />
job design.<br />
Over the next two years we will encourage the proliferation of workplace bargaining to<br />
cover more than half of the workforce, while asking the AIRC, the employers and the<br />
ACT1J to confine the exercise of the compulsory arbitral powers of the Commission to<br />
general adjustments in minimum rates.<br />
Those of you here from industry will know that more changes have taken place in the<br />
workplace in the last few years than took place in several decades before, and that there<br />
really is a new spirit of cooperation and willingness to change. You may say its not<br />
enough. You may say we can do more. And let me tell you right now that I agree with<br />
you. We must do-more, we can do more, we will do more and the workplace<br />
agreements at GMH, Toyota, ICI, ITT' Sheraton, and the oil industry are showizig us the<br />
way.<br />
1402 </p>
<p>Our goal is not merely to improve on what we have done, but to match the international<br />
best. Let me say in passing that I regard our tax rate changes planned for 1994/ 5 and 1995/ 6 as<br />
quite crucial to our success in transforming the workplace and enhancing the quality of the<br />
workplace. The cuts, you might recall, are targeted at bringing the current 38 cent second<br />
bracket to 30 cents. It is this rate which most affects work incentives for middle incomes<br />
earners, and the rewards from productivity bargains.<br />
Finally, we,% yill continue to encourage the transformation of Australian industry to match<br />
the supply of better trained and more productive workers with smarter products for them<br />
to make. We are making permanent the 150 per cent tax deduction for research and<br />
development and increasing export incentives, all on top of a One Nation program in<br />
which we legislated more generous depreciation rates, a development allowance for major<br />
projects, tax benefits for private companies in public projects, and pooled development<br />
funds for medium sized business.<br />
The government makes the economic policy, but it is the private sector which produces<br />
the goods. Of the growth we forecast this year, less than one third will be contributed by<br />
government spending and most of that additional spending is anyway in the private<br />
sector. It is the private sector which is now making the concrete sleepers and steel rails for<br />
the national rail freight highway, it is the private contractors who are out pouring the<br />
concrete and spreading the bitumen for our national highway system, and private<br />
businesses which are taking advantage of more generous tax rules to invest in new plant<br />
and equipment.<br />
And it is the private sector which realises the gains from our new emphasis on workforce<br />
jrigigg, and on workplace bargaining.<br />
The shift in priorities in this Budget and in our long term economic strategy will help get<br />
unemployment down now, and our workforce quality up over the long term.<br />
After all, there is no greater economic waste in the economy than the waste of<br />
unemployment, there is no resource more valuable which is used more unproductively<br />
than the unemployed, and no change we can make in the economy which has as much<br />
impact on growth, prosperity and living standards as bringing the unemployed back to<br />
work. And for the longer term I wholeheartedly agree with the view of Michael Porter of the<br />
Harvard Business School, who writes that " education and training constitute perhaps the<br />
single greatest long-term leverage point available to all levels of government in<br />
upgrading industry".<br />
Over the last ten years we have deregulated the financial system and floated the dollar,<br />
restored the profit share, cut your marginal income tax rates and sliced the share of<br />
national income we take as taxes, put in place a program of tariff changes which is<br />
1403 </p>
<p>changing us from a frightened inward looking economy into a competitive outward<br />
looking economy, and entrenched an Accord with the union movement and created a<br />
cooperative industrial relations environment.<br />
It was the decade of reform in which we transformed government authorities into business<br />
enterprises, began to reform our wharves and coastal shipping, opened up our aviation and<br />
telecommunications industries to competition, and changed our business taxes to give us<br />
one of the competitive systems in the OECD.<br />
More recently we have rebalanced the share of investment made by government to<br />
improve our airports, roads, railways, ports and electricity distribution, while enacting a<br />
supErannuation scheme which will increase national savings for investment in the future.<br />
We have begun to see some of the results of that decade of reform.<br />
We now have one of the lowest inflation rates in the OECD. We have tripled both<br />
manufacturing exports and services exports, and increasingly we are finding our growth<br />
markets in our own region. Commonwealth Government business enterprises are in the<br />
black. We have a strong profit share, but also strong productivity growth and rising real<br />
wages. The result is that Australia is emerging from the recession with an economy that is<br />
fundamentally stronger than it has been for a generation.<br />
We are directly creating jobs, and we are enhancing the employability of the currently<br />
unemployed, but we all know that putting people into good jobs in coming years depends<br />
on steady economic expansion.<br />
Certainly our growth forecasts have been clipped back since we last analysed the outlook<br />
in our One Nation statement. But I am by no means pessimistic about either the<br />
immediate outlook, or the likelihood of reasonable growth through the nineties. The<br />
Economist magazine reported recently that Australia is set to have the highest growth and<br />
the lowest inflation of any of the 13 largest Western nations, according to a survey of<br />
forecasters. We are looking at inflation of 2 per cent this year, about the same as our<br />
record low this year. We are looking at 3 per cent year average product growth, which<br />
means we will be doing better than most, if not as well as we would wish. We are looking<br />
at some acceleration in the years beyond that to give us a good show of creating around<br />
800,000 jobs over four years in an economy in which low inflation is normal, in which we<br />
have successfully internationalised, and in which we have strong proiuctivity growth and<br />
rising living stan~ dards.<br />
We are seeing results, but at the same time we are beginning a new stage of reform.<br />
A stage when the emphasis will be on people.<br />
1404 </p>
<p>The great and durable gains of the nineties are not going to be made by shuffling around<br />
the tax burden.<br />
They are not going to be made by slicing government, when government spending here is<br />
already one of the lowest in the OECD.<br />
They are not going to be made by turning our industrial relations into a blood sport, by<br />
hurling business against their employees and trade unions, with government as spectator.<br />
They are not going to be made by totally eliminating tariff protection, when our program<br />
of reductions is already making us one of the least protected countries in the world, and<br />
one in which the discipline of readjustment is already strict.<br />
They are not going to be made by telling the Central Bank to run the place as it sees fit.<br />
They are going to be made by creating a top quality, fully employed and adaptable<br />
workforce. They are going to be made by business people taking decisions in a tight, disciplined,<br />
stable framework.<br />
A framework in which government does well the things governments do best in which it<br />
makes sensible rules, funds sensible things like roads and railways, and enhances the<br />
quality of the workforce. 1405 </p>
