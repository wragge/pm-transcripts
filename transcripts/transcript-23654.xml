    <content><![CDATA[<p>The thoughts and prayers of all Australians today are with the families and loved ones of the Australians that have tragically been killed on Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.</p>
<p>Our hearts go out to the families of all the dead.</p>
<p>At least 27 Australians citizens have lost their lives on flight MH17. Nine resided in Queensland, nine in Victoria, seven in Western Australia, one in the ACT and one in New South Wales.</p>
<p>We canât restore them to life but we can and will do everything to support them in this sad and bitter time because that is the Australian way â we help in times of trouble.</p>
<p>Counselling, consular and all possible assistance will be provided to the families during the difficult days ahead.</p>
<p>We will do all we possibly can to support the families and to find out exactly what has happened and exactly who is responsible.</p>
<p>Anyone who has concerns for the welfare of family or friends are encouraged to contact DFATâs 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on + 61 2 6261 3305 from overseas, or within Australia on 1300 555 135.</p>
