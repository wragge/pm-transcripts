PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 11 APRIL 1989<br />
Mr David Beddall, Member for Rankin ( Queensland) has been<br />
appointed chairman of the Prime Minister's Country Task Force.<br />
He succeeds Mr David Simmons, Member for Calare, who is now<br />
Minister for Defence Science and Personnel.<br />
Mr Beddall has been Member for Rankin since 1984, and was Member<br />
for Fadden from 1983 to 1984.<br />
He has been a member of the Country Task Force since it was<br />
formed in March 1986.<br />
During that time he has played a major role in addressing the<br />
problems facing people in provincial cities and towns.<br />
Mr Beddall is also chairman of the House of Representatives<br />
Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology.<br />
His electorate of Rankin stretches from the Brisbane suburb of<br />
Inala to the rural areas of the southern Darling Downs, including<br />
the town of Warwick.<br />
Mr Beddall is now chairman of the Caucus Primary Industry and<br />
Resources Committee, from which the Country Task Force is based.<br />
Since its formation the task force has dealt with a wide range<br />
of rural and socio-economic issues relating to people living in<br />
provincial cities and towns, as well as to the farm sector.<br />
These issues include small business, industry, women's issues,<br />
education, job generation, care for the elderly, primary<br />
production, Aboriginal affairs, and local government.<br />
I am certain Mr Beddall will continue to provide non-metropolitan<br />
people with a direct link to me on issues which most affect their<br />
lives. I thank Mr Simmons for his contribution and commitment to the<br />
Country Task Force.<br />
