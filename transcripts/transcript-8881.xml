STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MVP<br />
COMMONWEALTH ARRANGEMENTS FOR CO-ORDINATION OF<br />
PLANNING FOR CELEBRATION OF THE CENTENARY OF FEDERATION<br />
The year 2001 will be the centenary of federation. On 1 January 1901, the six<br />
British colonies in Australia federated as the Commonwealth of Australia. As<br />
well as commemorating that event, we will want to commemorate the<br />
centenaries of the various milestones which, through the 1 890s, marked<br />
Australia's progress towards nationhood in 1901.<br />
The commemoration of the centenary of federation, and the events leading up<br />
to It, Is fundamentally a national matter, and I hope the entire community will<br />
particlpate whole-heartedly in it.<br />
I have asked the Special Minister of State, the Hon Frank Walker, MP, to coordinate<br />
the Commonwealth's arrangements for its activities linked to the<br />
centenary. 9 JUNE 1993<br />
MELBOURNE </p>
