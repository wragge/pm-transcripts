M1D I A RELEIASE<br />
NA'rIONAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST DRINKDRIVI-NG<br />
( Statement by) the Acting Prime Minister, the<br />
Rt. lion J. D. Anthony, M. P.)<br />
A national TV campaign against drink driving commenced today<br />
and will run for several months.<br />
" It gives me great pleasure to announce that the campaign is<br />
proceeding * as a result of the co-operative efforts of all<br />
governments", Mr. Anthony said.<br />
One million dollars from the Commonwealth, States and the<br />
Northern Territory will be uised to run the campaign. " Industry<br />
is also being invited to participate in the campaign and I hope<br />
Sthat industryr contributions can extend the campaign to Easter",<br />
V Mr. Anthony said.<br />
This year, some 3,000 people will be killed on Austrzilia's<br />
roads and road crashes will be the principal cause of death for<br />
all people between the ages of S and 34. " Alcohol will be<br />
involved in about half of these deaths", Mr. Anthony said.<br />
In each State and Territory, particular measures are in<br />
operation throughout the year to combat the problem with special<br />
publicity' and enforcement activities, particularly over holiday<br />
periods. Mr. Anthony said the key significance of the television<br />
campaign commencing tonight was the additional commitment by<br />
governments over and above their existing programs.<br />
" I hope the community also recognises that it has an<br />
important role to play in reducing the appallingly high number of<br />
deaths and injuries on our roads associated with alcohol", Mr.<br />
Anthony said.<br />
The campaign will be based on the four award-winning<br />
television commercials featuring Paul Cronin, who asks:-" What<br />
sort of friend are you? Would you let a friend drive if hie's had<br />
too much to drink?"<br />
" The commercials have been shown previouJsly but their<br />
message can well afford to h e repeated regul arly o-. ver the next<br />
few months''", Mr. Anthony s i I(<br />
