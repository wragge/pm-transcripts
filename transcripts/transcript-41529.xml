    <content><![CDATA[<p>I’m pleased to announce the inaugural winners of the Prime Minister’s Veterans’ Employment Awards.</p>
<p>This event celebrates the enormous contribution made by Australian veterans and the businesses which benefit from their experience, skills, and leadership.</p>
<p>The awards showcase businesses across Australia which employ or support veterans of the Australian Defence Force (ADF), while highlighting the significant contributions being made by veterans in the civilian workplace.</p>
<p>Too often we look at our ex-servicemen and women and see them only as a uniform. But we must also see them as executives and engineers, managers, scientists, miners, or any number of other professions.</p>
<p>Army Veteran Glen Ferrarotto has been awarded the top honour of Outstanding Contribution by an Individual to Veterans’ Employment. Mr Ferrarotto founded Ironside Recruitment, an organisation specifically dedicated to placing ex-service personnel into employment outside the Australian Defence Force.</p>
<p>Glen is assisting veterans across the country to apply their valuable military skills and experience in the workforce, and he should be commended for his contribution to the lives of men and women who have served our country in uniform.</p>
<p>The award for Outstanding Contribution by an Organisation to Veterans' Employment was won by WithYouWithMe, a veteran-owned company. WithYouWithMe assists veterans to move from the ADF to a new career.</p>
<p>WithYouWithMe has an impressive network of veteran employers and has developed innovative training programs which give many veterans rewarding careers.</p>
<p>I join the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Darren Chester in congratulating the winners, and together we urge all Australian businesses to get on board and employ a veteran.</p>
<p>“Leaving the defence force is a significant change for our veterans, which is why it is vital we ensure ex-service men and women have the support to find meaningful careers when they return to civilian life,” Mr Chester said.</p>
<p>“These awards showcase the successes of employing highly skilled and motivated ex-servicemen and women.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s Veterans’ Employment Awards are just one part of a larger program to raise awareness of the enormous value and unique experience our veterans have and the significant contribution they can make in civilian employment.</p>
