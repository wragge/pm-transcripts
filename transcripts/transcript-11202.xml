<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Mr Skate's resignation and whoever the future Prime Minister of Papua</p>
<p> New Guinea is is a matter naturally for the government of that country</p>
<p> and the parliament of that country. My Government has worked closely</p>
<p> with Mr Skate's Government over the last couple of years particularly</p>
<p> in relation to the progress that's been made concerning Bougainville.</p>
<p> But as to the future personalities in the Government and who occupies</p>
<p> what position and who is Prime Minister that is entirely a matter</p>
<p> for the people of PNG.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you know what's going to happen with PNG's recognition of Taiwan</p>
<p> in the wake of Mr Skate's resignation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't have anything to add to what I said this morning about that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But it was an unfortunate timing was it for his departure?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't have anything to add to what I said this morning.</p>
