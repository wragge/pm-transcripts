PRIME MINISTER 7<br />
FOR MEDIA 29 APRIL 1979<br />
LAUNCHING OF ETHNIC TELEVISION<br />
What you're seeing is the start of an experiment in Australian<br />
television. An experiment that recognises that Australia is a<br />
multicultural society.<br />
Hundreds of thousands of migrants have enriched Australia both<br />
culturally and materially. They have changed Australia for the<br />
better to a society which has as its citizens people from all<br />
over the world, representatives of many different cultures.<br />
This experirlent in ethnic T. V. will bring together these cultures<br />
for all Australians to share. To me, that's what's important<br />
about multiculturalism and ethnic television it helps us all<br />
to be more tolerant and understanding of each other and of one<br />
another's history, culture and artistic achievements.<br />
At the moment ethnic television is on an experimental basis.<br />
It will present a range of different types of programs covering<br />
entertainment, conununity news, local and overseas information,<br />
education, s; port and special interest programs.<br />
Today's pro,; ram is only a start. It arises from this Government's<br />
acceptance of the Galbally Report's recommendatic, that a permanent<br />
ethnic television service be established.<br />
We want the community to be involved in the fullest possible<br />
way in the ethnic T. V. service and the experimental period will<br />
allow membe: s of the community to make a judgement on the value<br />
of the diff. erent programs.<br />
The experiment is starting on Sunday morning, but we look forward<br />
to the day when ethnic television is not just restricted to Sundays.<br />
We want you to say what you want to see and when you want to see it.<br />
All viewers will have the opportunity to make their suggestions<br />
about ethniz television to the Chairman of the Ethnic Television<br />
Review Panel, Mr Frank Galbally.<br />
The success of the ethnic television service depends on you, the<br />
viewer, making your opinions known.<br />
Ethnic televrision will add a new and exciting_ ension to<br />
Australian Droadcasting. I will be taking a close -ersonal interest<br />
in this initative and I offer my best wishes to all thosnvolved<br />
in the experimental service.<br />
I hope that the programs will be challenging, at times provocative,<br />
and of interest to all Australians. o0o--</p>
