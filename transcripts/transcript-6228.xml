PRIME MNTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 9 October 1983<br />
COUNTRY WATER SUPPLIES<br />
The Queensland Government is holding up urgently neededi<br />
jobs improving water supplies in country towns.<br />
Federal Government funds are lying idle, while the State<br />
Government dithers on how it should be spent.<br />
The mioney is Queensland's share of a spe! cial allocation<br />
under the-Comrnunity Employment Program designed to improve<br />
the quality and reliability of country water supplies.<br />
The money has been available for weeks, but the Queensland<br />
Government will not even begin to consider how it should<br />
be spent until almost a month after the State election.<br />
The availability of Commonwealth money for country tow--n<br />
water supplies was first announced by the Treasurer in<br />
his 19 May Economic Statement. The Queensland Government<br />
has had plenty of time to consider the matter.<br />
Johih Gayler has made the Federal Government very conscious<br />
of the inadequacies of water supplies to some country<br />
towns in the Far North and North West of Queensland.<br />
A number of councils have made applications for funding<br />
under the special water projects scheme to be funded<br />
under the Community Employment Program.<br />
I am confident that there will be good news for some<br />
of the local applicants, but until the State Government<br />
is prepared to honour its part of the bargain, these<br />
urgently needed projects cannot proceed.<br />
