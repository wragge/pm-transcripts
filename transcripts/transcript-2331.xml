FOR PRESS: P. M. No 111/ 1970<br />
AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL FOR THE ARTS:<br />
MAJOR GRANTS FOR 1971<br />
Statement byL the Prime Minister,. Mr. John Gorton<br />
I have received from the Australian Council for the Artj recommendations<br />
concerning the major grants to be made by the Commonwealth Government in the<br />
current financial year.<br />
Following last year's pattern, my Government has again provided on the<br />
recommendation of the Council a considerable increase in support for the arts. The<br />
Council's Budget for 1970-1971 has been increased by $ 1 million to $ 3.85 million.<br />
In addition, a further sum of $ 1 million has been provided for the Film Development<br />
Corporation. We have done this as evidence of our concern for the quality of life<br />
which Australians should be able to enjoy. Our country has a most distinctive<br />
cultural tradition one in which a unique natural environment, sporting and outdoor<br />
pastimes and freedom to ' choose a wide variety of leisure pursuits all bring personal<br />
happiness an--d enrichment. The arts in particular have a special place in that margin<br />
forfuifilment which remains between routine daily existence and joy in living.<br />
My Government is gratified to see the surge of enthusiasm and activity<br />
made possible in the arts by the last two years of the Council's work. More and<br />
more talented young people are pursuing creative careers as actors, singers, dancers,<br />
musicians, writers, designers and directors. The big companies which now provide<br />
professional employment for hundred3 df Australian artists are reaching higher<br />
standards and a wider public in city and country. Added stimulus comes from the<br />
world's great performers and directors who now come readily to wlork with these<br />
companies. We can now look back on more than two years of activities. The broad<br />
lines of the Council's work are established. Great importance is attached to professional<br />
training. Funds are concentrated to encourage the highest standards of performance<br />
in the national companies. In conjunction with State Governments, who give to the<br />
arts with increasing generosity, regional companies are supported in all capital cities.<br />
The needs of country people are provided for. Festivals and special productions<br />
throughout the country receive regular as'sistance. Our international activities are<br />
increasing. A research programme examines the needs of the arts and suggests new<br />
areas for assistance. This consolidation is gratifying. But it is not enough. hi the arts<br />
established activity must always be balanced by new development. It is right for the<br />
big drama and opera and ballet companies to present what is best and most lasting<br />
in the cultural traditions of our past. But at the same time changing needs must be<br />
identified and fresh artistic drives liberated. / 2 </p>
<p>In the 1970s we must make possible the classics of the twenty-f irst<br />
century. Investment in the future means tolerating and supporting unfamiliar ideas,<br />
experimental forms and new expression. It means ensuring that young people with<br />
vision can break with accepted and comfortable tradition and find a climate in which<br />
unorthodoxy can flourish.<br />
Each year the Council moves into new areas. Last year it recommended<br />
support for Australian film and television makers. That support has now been given.<br />
A professional training school is in the planning stage; young film makers are<br />
already producing experimental films with our assistance; the Film Development<br />
Corporation-now provides funds for the commercial industry.<br />
Moving forward is the function of the Council's development funds for'<br />
music, aboriginal arts, festivals, film and television and special projects. This year<br />
we have added another fund for youth and education programmes. The Council is<br />
convinced that one of its most important roles will be the encouragement of programmes<br />
which develop talent and stimulate interest in the arts for young people both within the<br />
education system and without. It is heartening to see the response from educationists<br />
and from State Governments which have already given generous support for pilot<br />
programmes in many fields. Co-operative action of this kind will make possible<br />
far gr . ater achievement than we could manag; e alone.<br />
The development funds assist large and small projects all over Australia.<br />
Aboriginal musicians come together in Arnhem Land with a touring wind quintet;<br />
Sir Tyrone Guthrie mounts major productions in Melbourne and Sydney; a workshop<br />
play about King O'Malley grows into a successful touring production; a film director<br />
goes out to help a school film club. As programmes prove successful they are<br />
absorbed into the regular grants of the Council and the funds move on to new<br />
activities. This year we hope to encourage more invention and experiment through<br />
the Special Projects Fund and assist still further community projects begun with<br />
help from city councils, trade unions and welfare organisations. The arts must weave<br />
into the whole fabric of our society.<br />
Internationally our programme is also greatly expanding. We need the<br />
stimulus and pleasure to be derived from world class orchestras and companies vh ich<br />
visit us. We are able increasingly to show our best professional-performers to the<br />
world. This year we have sent abroad excellent chamber groups. The Melbourne<br />
Symphony Orchestra has gone to America. The Australian Ballet will leave before<br />
Christmas to tour the United States with Rudolf Nureyev.<br />
It is my Government's hope that this varied and growing activity will bring<br />
great pleasure to the lives of all Australians.<br />
Grants from the Development Funds and research programnme are announced<br />
regularly throughout the year. It is my pleasure now to announce the first series of<br />
major grants for 1971 based on the recommendations by the Council. </p>
