    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I am announcing three changes in Commonwealth Departmental Secretaries.</p>
<p>Michael Thawley AO has advised me that he wishes to return to the private sector, and will be leaving the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in late January 2016.  Mr Thawley returned to the Australian Public Service (APS) in December 2014 after working at a senior level in the finance sector in the US since 2005.  His earlier public service career included Australia’s Ambassador to the USA, and a range of significant diplomatic roles.  I am grateful for Michael’s support as my Department Head and I thank him for his leadership of the APS.</p>
<p>Peter Varghese AO has advised me that he will be stepping down as Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in July 2016 to take up the position of Chancellor of the University of Queensland.  Mr Varghese has had a distinguished career in Australia’s diplomatic service, with postings in India, Malaysia, Tokyo, Washington and Vienna, and as Director-General of the Office of National Assessments.  I congratulate Mr Varghese on this prestigious new appointment.</p>
<p>Drew Clarke PSM FTSE has accepted my offer to become my ongoing Chief of Staff, after acting in the role since my appointment as Prime Minister.  Mr Clarke was previously Secretary of the Department of Communications, and Secretary of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism.  His earlier public service career included roles in energy policy, and in industry, science and mapping agencies.  I am very pleased that Mr Clarke will bring his APS and policy experience to my Office.</p>
<p>I thank these departing Secretaries for their public service.  New appointments to their positions will be announced in due course.</p>
