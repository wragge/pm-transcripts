<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard will make a state visit to India from 15 to 17 October.</p>
<p>India, the world's biggest democracy and one of the fastest growing major economies, stands in the front rank of Australia's international partnerships and will be a key part of Australia's future in the Asian Century. </p>
<p>Our strategic partnership is based on shared values and mutual interests.  India is Australia's fourth-largest export market and a key strategic and economic partner in the region.  </p>
<p>There has been strong recent growth in the bilateral relationship spanning economic, cultural, education, science and strategic ties.  Indian investment in Australia in 2011 alone was over $11 billion.</p>
<p>In New Delhi, Ms Gillard will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and senior ministers to discuss ways to further expand and deepen bilateral and regional cooperation, boost our trade and investment ties, and strengthen our political and strategic dialogue.  She will also call on President Mukerjee and meet with Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard will meet with members of the Australia India CEOs Forum, address a lunch hosted by the three business chambers and have the opportunity to see first-hand the results of Australia-India collaboration on community and science and research projects.</p>
<p>Australia and India share longstanding people-to-people and cultural ties, with a flourishing Indian community here which has made a significant social and economic contribution.  Australia's largest ever cultural festival in India - Oz Fest - will be launched by Ms Gillard at a concert in New Delhi.</p>
<p>Oz Fest will run until February 2013 and involve over 100 events across 18 Indian cities. This will further enhance our cultural ties and understanding between the two countries. </p>
<p>This will be Ms Gillard's first visit to India as Prime Minister.  She visited India in 2009 as Deputy Prime Minister.  </p>
