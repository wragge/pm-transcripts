FOR MEDIA 19 JUNE 1979<br />
SALT II<br />
The Prime Minister today welcomed the signing of the SALT II<br />
agreement in Vienna by President Carter and President Brezhnev.<br />
The 3S.-T II agreement is an important step forward, he said.<br />
It should lessen the risk of nuclear war and place limits<br />
on -he strategic arsenals of both the United States and the<br />
Soviet Union. It should place limits on the development<br />
by these two countries of new strategic systems and open<br />
the way to future reductions in nuclear arsenals. An agreement<br />
of this kind involves compromise and no party gets all of<br />
what it wants. Bearing in mind the alternative an<br />
unr-estricted arms race involving the progressive application<br />
of new technology the agreement represents a major<br />
positive step.<br />
Ag: eement on SALT II will also assist efforts to strengthen<br />
the international non-proliferation regime. The capacity<br />
of the superpowers to encourage other states to forego the<br />
nuclear weapons option will be enhanced.<br />
President Carter has assured the United States Congress that<br />
the SALT II agreement can be verified and that the United States<br />
nuclear deterrent will remain strong.<br />
Mr. Fraser said that he and the Foreign Minister, Mr. Peacock,<br />
hai made statements over the past year strongly urging the<br />
early conclusion of SALT II. Australia will continue<br />
to give full backing to the SALT negotiating process because<br />
of the very important role it plays in maintaining balance<br />
bet. een the strategic deterrent capabilities of the superpowers.<br />
International stability and avoidance of nuclear war depend<br />
orn : intenance of this balance. Through the operation of joint<br />
facilities in Australia, Australia has contributed substantially<br />
and for many years to the support of the United States defence<br />
cornerns and thus to global stability and world peace. It will<br />
cc_-. nue to do so.<br />
Mr. Fraser said he hoped that the United States Senate would<br />
ratify the SALT II Treaty promptly. Failure of the Senate<br />
to support the SALT II Treaty could have a detrimental effect on<br />
the capacity of the United States Government to meet fully<br />
its global responsibilities. 000---</p>
