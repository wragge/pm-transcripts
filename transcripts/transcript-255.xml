P. M. No. 41/ 196o<br />
HIGINBOTHAM LY-ELECTION<br />
Statement bythe Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
The vote is naturally disappointing, but I cannot<br />
say it is entirely unexpected. ' i. e knelt quite well that, in<br />
thie short run at least, our recently announced policies -ould<br />
be unpopular. That fact alone, added to the high personal<br />
popularity of the late Mr. Timson, made it practically<br />
certain that there would be a substantial reduction in the<br />
Liberal majority. In the last week of the campaign, the<br />
events in the Senate undoubtedly contributed to a further<br />
reduction. The whole matter is reminiscent of the Flinders<br />
by-election of 1952.<br />
Mr. Calwell's statement about the convening of the<br />
meeting of the Liberal and Country Party members for February<br />
7, is rather curious. The obvious fact is that at the<br />
beginning of an election year it is most desirable for the<br />
Leader of the Government to have a substantial mecting , with<br />
Government members. As I have to be in London for the Prime<br />
Ministers' Conference the day before the Australian Parliament<br />
meets, an earlier date for a party meJting became inevitable.<br />
12th December, 1960. </p>
