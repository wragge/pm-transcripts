STATEMENT ! f~ O INDIAN PARLIAMENT<br />
As the leader of a parliamentary democracy, and as someone with<br />
23 years personal experience as a parliamentarian I am delighted<br />
to have this opportunity to address you, the representatives<br />
of the largest democracy in the-world.<br />
No invitation has been more welcome to me and I would like to<br />
express at the outset, and in the clearest terms my admiration<br />
for India's commitment to the democratic principle.<br />
It has been sustained in circumstances which have never been easy<br />
and have sometimes been dauntingly difficult.<br />
Future historians will surely record as one of the most remarkable<br />
facts of the second half of the twentieth century that as democracy<br />
faltered and failed in dozens of countries, countries whose<br />
problems, while serious enough, could not be mentioned in the same<br />
breath as those of India, democracy remained alive and vital here.<br />
It is a tribute to you as leaders, to your institutions, but most<br />
of all the people of India. For as a truly great Indian,<br />
Mahatma Gandhi, wrote over 50 years ago, " Parliaments have no power<br />
or even existence independently of the people."<br />
This visit gives me the opportunity to deepen my understanding<br />
of this remarkable and fascinating ' country. But it does more than<br />
that. I believe that over the last 30 years neither of our countries,<br />
neither Australia nor India, has done enough to fulfil the potential<br />
of our relationship.<br />
Do not misunderstand me. That relationship has been amicable and<br />
cordial. But for a variety of reasons, legitimate reasons in<br />
the context of the time, our principal energies have been otherwise<br />
engaged. You have been largely preoccupied with the affairs of the<br />
sub-continent and with playing a leading role in creating and<br />
developing the non-aligned movement. Our attention has been<br />
centred mainly on South East Asia; we have not adequately turned<br />
our attention towards strengthening and deepening the relationship,<br />
towards exploring its possibilities. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
When your Prime Minister, Mr. Desai, and I met at the Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government Meeting in London in 1977, we both came to<br />
the conclusion that the time had come to strengthen the<br />
relationship.<br />
When we met again at the Commonwealth Regional Meeting in Sydney<br />
a year ago, a meeting which gained much of its weight and<br />
authority from Mr. Desai's presence, this conviction was greatly<br />
strengthened and we took some preliminary steps to develop the<br />
relationship between our two countries.<br />
I trust that my visit will contribute further to the process.<br />
Our relationship should be further developed not only because<br />
it is in our direct bilateral interest to do so, but because<br />
at this time in history there is a crucial role to be played<br />
by countries like ours, countries which have learnt the art of<br />
compromise through their own institutions, which are not at the<br />
extreme end of any spectrum in international affairs and which<br />
are committed to moderation and reconciliation.<br />
It is now more important than ever that nations like ours should<br />
do our utmost to inject this experience into the conduct of<br />
international affairs. To the extent that we understand and<br />
can lend support to each other that role will be performed<br />
more effectively.<br />
I trust that by the time I have finished speaking it will be<br />
clear why I believe this and what I see that role as being. I<br />
appreciate that there are many differences between Australia and<br />
India. These differences are real enough and there is no need<br />
to gloss over them. Yours is one of the great and ancient<br />
civilisations of the world.<br />
No country on earth has such a long cultural continuity as India.<br />
By comparison Australia is a very young country, one which has<br />
created a distinctive cultural identity for itself during the<br />
course of this century.<br />
The contrast between us in terms of population is striking. You<br />
have a population which is more than twice that of the whole of<br />
Africa and which constitutes nearly a third of all the people<br />
living in the Third World.<br />
The fact that every year your population increases by a number<br />
about equivalent to Australia's total population indicates just<br />
how striking that contrast is. The diversity and complexity of<br />
your society is staggering. Australian society is also growing<br />
in diversity. What began as purely Anglo-saxon has been enriched<br />
by European and Asian influences, and by an increasing awareness<br />
of what our continent's pre-European civilization has to contribute.<br />
But we recognise that few if any of the world's societies can<br />
compare with you in this respect.<br />
Given these social and cultural differences, it naturally follows<br />
that the domestic problems. which engross our two countries, our<br />
Political priorities, must also be different. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
One could easily extend the list of differences, but instead<br />
let me simply concede it and go on to make two crucial qualifying<br />
points. First, while the differences are real enough, their effect has<br />
to some extent been compounded by lack of first-hand familiarity.<br />
The widely held western view of India as the archetypal<br />
" Iunder-developed" country has tended to obscure the fact<br />
that you are one of the world's great industrial powers, that<br />
you have one of the world's largest scientific and intellectual<br />
communities, that, indeed, while still a developing country, in<br />
many respects you are one of the world's most highly developed<br />
and sophisticated countries, and that this is disguised only by<br />
the fact you have to cop6 with an almost overwhelming population<br />
burden. Similarly, in the past your policy of non-alignment has not always<br />
been understood and there has been insufficient appreciation<br />
of the needs from which it springs or the purposes it was meant<br />
to serve.<br />
Differences of means have sometimes been confused with differences<br />
of ends, thus obscuring the fact of a common interest in peace and<br />
stability. In Australia's case, we are sometimes thought of as a typically<br />
western country which happens to be eccentrically located at the<br />
bottom right-hand corner of Asia. I believe that this is a<br />
quite inadequate concept of contemporary Australia.<br />
It is true that many of our central values and institutions<br />
are western, in the sense that they were first articulated and<br />
shaped in the west; not that the west has patent rights over them,<br />
We are fundamentally western in that sense.<br />
But we are western with a difference. A country which originated<br />
as a colony, whose own physical geography and environment are so<br />
distinctive, whose outlook and perspectives are profoundly affected<br />
by its location in the South East Asian region; whose export<br />
earnings derive principally from commodities; which is a net<br />
importer of capital, cannot be regarded as typically western.<br />
Australia is Australia, not an appendage of Europe.<br />
The second and even more important qualification I wish to make<br />
is that'while the differences between Australia and India are<br />
real, there are also very important similarities between us,<br />
similarities which are of fundamental political relevance at<br />
the present time.<br />
As I began by acknowledging, we are two countries committed to<br />
democracy, situated on the rim of the same ocean, and in a world<br />
where functioning democracies are the exception rather than the<br />
rule. Neither India nor Australia lays claims on any other country.<br />
Both believe in moderation and conciliation rather than confronation,<br />
as a means to resolve differences between countries. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Both have a stake in peace and stability, in a part of the<br />
world where neither can be taken for granted. If one considers<br />
the Indian Ocean, for example, it is apparent that different<br />
as they are, both our approaches are concerned to prevent that<br />
Ocean from becoming a region of instability and great power<br />
rivalry. Your approach seeks to do this by creating a zone of peace, ours<br />
by maintaining a balance at the lowest possible level.<br />
Perhaps one could sum up the difference by saying that yrour<br />
approach would be the one more certain to bring about the desired<br />
result if it succeeeded, while ours is the one more likely to<br />
be achievable in the short or medium term.<br />
In any case, what I wish to stress is that we share the same<br />
basic objective. We are both working towards reducing tension<br />
and devising means for controlling conflict situations more<br />
effectively. We both strive to achieve an effective means of<br />
global arms control and disarmament.<br />
We know that the arms race threatens the survival of humanity and<br />
that it is a crippling handicap on economic development everywhere.<br />
We both recognise that disarmament cannot be left to the<br />
superpowers, that it requires a concerted effort by the nations<br />
of the world. We both want the nuclear weapons states to stop testing<br />
nuclear weapons in all environments, and Australia looks forward<br />
to working with India on the Committee for Disarmament.<br />
I submit that in the world in which we are living, the importance<br />
of the similarities between us far outweighs that of our<br />
differences. That world is one in which the possilility of a<br />
deepening rift between developed and developing countries, and<br />
of a serious political deterioration in regions of interest to<br />
both India and Australia, is real.<br />
In the early part of this decade, a sustained and unprecedented<br />
period of growth in the world economy came to an end. Whether<br />
this is temporary or permanent remains to be seen, and will depend<br />
essentially on the quality of statesmanship available over the next<br />
year or two.<br />
In the developed western world, this has been followed by a period<br />
of high inflation, high unemployment and low growth. In the<br />
developing countries, there have been two significant developments.<br />
First, a strong and co-ordinated demand for changes in the<br />
international economic system. And secondly, rapid, against-the-trend<br />
growth on the part of a small but significant group of developing<br />
countries, many of them Asian.<br />
The interaction of these developments is of profound importance<br />
for the future of the international order in every sense economic,<br />
political and strategic.<br />
There is a real danger that, beset by their own economic problems,<br />
under strong domestic political pressures and to some extent divided<br />
among themselves, the developed countries will react negatively<br />
and in a protectio nist spirit to the needs of the Third World.<br />
Indeed, there are disturbing indications that this is already<br />
happening. </p>
<p>There is evidence in some quarters in the west of a disinclination<br />
to look with discrimination and sympathy at the claims of developing<br />
countries to see which proposals may offer the prospect of ensuring<br />
increased production and overall wealth for both groups of<br />
countries. There is even clearer evidence of a resort to protectionist<br />
measures some quite open, others more covert against those<br />
developing countries which are successfully expanding their<br />
manufacturing export sectors. If this approach were to prevail,<br />
the result would be disastrous.<br />
By demonstrating to the developing countries that there was little<br />
sympathy for their problems and a negative response to their<br />
efforts to work within the western system of trade it would<br />
strengthen the hand of those who have an interest in confrontation<br />
and inflexibility. Who could then say with strength that they<br />
were wrong? The result would be increasing alienation,<br />
instability and adventurism.<br />
It is essential, therefore, that this approach should not<br />
prevail. We must have policies based on a recognition of<br />
interdependence, of the fact that in crucial respects the<br />
future of the developed and developing worlds are inevitably linked,<br />
and that co-operation between them is essential.<br />
These economic issues do not stand apart from other aspects of<br />
international relations. The days when they could be thought of<br />
in a separate compartment are gone. They have to be considered<br />
as part of the totality of relations, interacting closely with<br />
political, social and strategic questions.<br />
There is profound truth in Pandit Nehru's assertion that:<br />
" There can be no security or real peace if vast numbers of<br />
people in various parts of the world live in poverty and misery.<br />
Nor can there be a balanced economy for the world as a whole if<br />
the underdeveloped parts continue to upset that balance and drag<br />
down even the more prosperous nations"<br />
Just as economic development and prosperity are vital for peace,<br />
so peace is vital to economic development. As recent events in<br />
a number of regions of importance to India and Australia have<br />
brought home, the conditions for peace still elude the world.<br />
In South-East Asia, the end of the Vietnam War brought hopes<br />
that this troubled region might at last enjoy some peace and<br />
stability. The progress made by ASEAN and the quite remarkable<br />
economic growth achieved by some of its members, strengthened these<br />
hopes. There were signs of a possible rapprochement between the ASEAN<br />
countries and Vietnam. Many believed that economic and development<br />
issues, not power politics, would now dominate the affairs of the<br />
region. Recent events have cast a dark shadow over such hopes.<br />
A renewed intrusion of great power politics, the escalation of<br />
violence, the apparent determination to press the advantage of<br />
military superiority make it seem that the last few years<br />
represented not a fundamental change, but a short breathing<br />
space. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
In the Middle East, a region of particular importance to India,<br />
which has over a million of her people working there, the<br />
situation has assumed a fluidity which, given the region's<br />
geo-political sensitivity, is very dangerous.<br />
The turmoil and uncertainty in many countries in the area,<br />
combined with the interests which we all share mean that<br />
any miscalculation by the superpowers could have grave<br />
consequences.<br />
We have recently had a graphic reminder in Iran that rapid growth<br />
does not itself guarantee stability, that it can in fact result in<br />
cultural and political dislocations which are seriously<br />
destabilising. In Southern Africa blatant racialism, which constitutes a basic<br />
affront to human-dignity, has created a situation which already<br />
involves bloodshed and misery and which, unless speedily resolved,<br />
is almost certain to result in a major political crisis.<br />
This is the world in which we are living.<br />
My central theme is that in such a world there is a vital<br />
role for actors who are not dogmatic; who are not set on<br />
confrontation; whose behaviour reflects more than short-term and<br />
narrow self-interest. There is a need for such actors in the<br />
developed world, in the developing world and in a variety of<br />
regional settings. If they do not appear and assert themselves<br />
vigorously, the prospects are bleak.<br />
It seems to me that both India and Australia are eminently capable<br />
of performing such a role as forces of co-operation, moderation<br />
and toleration, and countering those of confrontation, dogmatism<br />
and bigotry. Indeed, in a real sense India has been performing<br />
that role since she achieved independence.<br />
As I understand it, the notions of mediation, of opening rather than<br />
closing of doors, of reconciliation and compromise, constitute<br />
important elements in the wider concept of non-alignment.<br />
Within the non-aligned movement itself you have provided much<br />
of the statesmanship required to hold together and to find<br />
constructive compromises between groups with different views.<br />
India has acquired great moral authority, based on its readiness<br />
to take a disinterested but principled view of a wide range of<br />
issues. Closer to home, Australia has watched with appreciation the<br />
constructive role India has taken in initiating a new era of hope<br />
and co-operation in the sub-continent. Your good neighbour policy<br />
has led to greater self-confidence and an easing of tension and<br />
uncertainty. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
The same spirit is evident in your efforts to begin a new phase<br />
in your relations with China; moves which have an important<br />
bearing on the future peace and stability of the Asia/ Pacific<br />
region.<br />
As far as Australia is concerned, during the last three years<br />
my Government has consistently acted on the belief that both<br />
an enlightened understanding of our own interests and the interest<br />
of international peace and stability require that we make a<br />
constructive and co-operative response to the needs of developing<br />
countries.<br />
We have played a leading part among the OECD countries in<br />
supporting the common fund proposal and in contributing to make<br />
it a practicable, workable arrangement. On this issue we took<br />
an independent initiative at a time when rigidity on both sides<br />
threatened a stalemate which would have had serious ramifications.<br />
We have strongly resisted the retreat towards protectionism on<br />
the part of some western countries. We recognise, of course, that<br />
the immediate removal of all barriers would be impossibly disrupting<br />
and we do not for a moment propose it.<br />
What we firmly believe is that the trend must be away from, not<br />
towards, protectionism.<br />
We have taken every opportunity to extend the dialogue between<br />
the developed and developing countries and to make it as genuine<br />
a meeting of minds as possible.<br />
Only a few weeks ago I was in Jamaica to attend a discussion of<br />
current economic problems between seven heads of Government from<br />
developing and developed countries. It proved to be an eminently<br />
worthwhile meeting, informal and unstructured, free from dogma<br />
and rhetoric.<br />
We have condemned the racialist regimes in southern Africa in the<br />
strongest terms and have used what influence we have to get those<br />
Governments to change their repugnant, dangerous and self-destructiv.<br />
policies. Nearer home, we have always supported ASEAN as a practical example<br />
of regional co-operation, and we have established with ASEAN an<br />
extensive system of consultation and co-operation.<br />
We based our policy towards Vietnam on the need to encourage her<br />
to integrate herself into the region and devote her formidable<br />
energies towards internal reconstruction and development. Recent<br />
events have forced us to reconsider, but for the longer term<br />
we have not abandoned that hope. We have taken more refugees<br />
from Vietnam per head of population than has any other country<br />
in the world.<br />
Thirty years ago, soon after the foundation of your Republic,<br />
India and Australia acted together to provide their good offices<br />
in the conflict which was then being waged in Indonesia. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
It was one of the earliest diplomatic initiatives of the new<br />
India and of an Australia emerging from its own dependence. The<br />
fact that two significant countries within the region acted in this<br />
way was not without effect.<br />
Australia and India are countries which prefer to dissolve rather<br />
than erect barriers in international relations. This approach lay<br />
at the basis of the Commonwealth's successful emergence as a<br />
diverse association of independent nations bringing together<br />
like and unlike.<br />
The Commonwealth's ability to adapt to new needs and to new<br />
circumstances has ensured not just its survival but its continuing<br />
relevance. The present Commonwealth is relevant to the needs of the world<br />
today in a way the old Commonwealth could never have been.<br />
The Heads of Government Regional Meeting at Sydney again demonstrated<br />
that the Commonwealth was capable of developing important new<br />
forms of co-operation. The approach of both our countries to<br />
international affairs can fairly be described as one of principled<br />
moderation. Moderation, that is, which derives not from<br />
indifference or lack of conviction, but is a positive, active<br />
force derived from the democratic experience of compromise and<br />
from an awareness of the importance of interdependence.<br />
There is not an over-abundance of such moderation in the world<br />
today, yet it is badly needed; and it badly needs to speak out.<br />
In too many situations it is the moderates who are in the majority<br />
but it is the extremists who prevail. We are not far from that<br />
situation which Yeats described where " The best lack all conviction<br />
while the worst are full of passionate intensity."<br />
It is in speaking out with the civilised voice of moderation that<br />
I see a role for your country and mine. India speaks for<br />
moderation with moral force as a founder and leader of nonalignment.<br />
We seek to speak for moderation from different origins. We are<br />
aligned. But the very fact that nations aligned and non-aligned<br />
are concerned to find reasonable solutions will strengthen the<br />
cause of moderation.<br />
If the non-aligned alone spoke for moderation the cause of reason<br />
would be seriously weakened. By speaking out for moderation from<br />
our different positions it will be reinforced.<br />
We cannot leave everything to the great powers, nor the sheer<br />
weight of numbers either. We need to draw on our experience of<br />
compromise and express our conviction of the reality of<br />
interdependence. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
Let our passion be for moderation; let our strength be in the<br />
cause of reason. Let our determination be for the breaking<br />
down of barriers between people. Let that be our role.<br />
But more than that it is a duty, an obligation,<br />
It can be fulfilled more effectively to the extent<br />
that we strengthen our relationship.<br />
I hope my visit to India can serve some part of that purpose.<br />
