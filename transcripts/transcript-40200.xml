    <content><![CDATA[<p>After the last election the cross-party Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquired at length into the Senate voting system. The Committee reported unanimously and made a number of recommendations to improve the Senate voting system.</p>
<p>The Government has carefully considered those recommendations and will introduce legislation today which will ensure that voters clearly and transparently determine where their Senate vote and preferences go.</p>
<p>These reforms will bring to an end the days of political parties determining preference flows. Individual voters will now decide how their preferences are allocated.</p>
<p>The following reforms to Senate voting arrangements will be proposed for the consideration of the Parliament today:</p>
<ul><li>The introduction of optional preferential above the line voting, with advice to the voter on the ballot paper to vote above the line by numbering at least 6 of the boxes in the order of the voter’s choice (with the number 1 as the voter’s first choice);</li>
<li>The introduction of a related savings provision to ensure that a ballot is still formal where the voter has numbered 1 or fewer than 6 boxes above the line;</li>
<li>In relation to voting below the line, a proposal to reduce the number of informal votes by increasing the number of allowable ‘mistakes’ from 3 to 5, as long as 90% of the Ballot paper below the line is filled in correctly;</li>
<li>The abolition of group and individual voting tickets;</li>
<li>The introduction of a restriction to prevent individuals holding relevant official positions in multiple parties;</li>
<li>To reduce voter confusion between parties with similar party names, a proposal to allow political parties (at their discretion) to have their logo included on the ballot paper.</li>
</ul><p>The AEC, as part of its usual pre-election awareness raising campaigns, will conduct a voter education campaign to ensure the changed arrangements are well understood.</p>
<p>Australians are entitled to expect that, when they vote for the Senate, the outcomes will reflect faithfully what each and every voter intends as they exercise their democratic choice.</p>
