-' 11 MAY 1979: MANILA<br />
JOINT COMMNUNIQUE: PRESIDENTr MARCOS AND PRIME MINISTER FRASER<br />
At the invitation of His Excellency President Ferdinand E3. Marcos,<br />
the Prime Minister of Australia, the Rt. Hon. Malcolm Fraser,<br />
made an official visit to the Republic of the Philippines from<br />
8 to 11 May 1979.<br />
During the visit the President and the Prime Minister held<br />
extensive discussions on a wide range of subjects of mutual interest.<br />
The talks were held in a very cordial and friendly atmosphere,<br />
reflecting the important and expanding relationship between the<br />
Philippines and Australia.<br />
Discussion covered three broad areas: regional and world<br />
stability; the international economic situation; and the bilateral<br />
relationship between the Philippines and Australia.<br />
The President and the Prime Minister agreed that some aspects<br />
of the international situation caused considerable concern, with<br />
areas of instability affecting parts of Africa, the Middle East<br />
and Indo-China. In addition, they noted that international economic<br />
difficulties added significantly to world tensions.<br />
In such circumstances, Australia and the countries of the ASEAN<br />
region had a strong mutual interest in working closely together<br />
to prevent such tensions from impeding the peaceful progress and<br />
development of the region.<br />
The President and the Prime Minister noted the recent normalization<br />
of relations between China and the United States and the conclusion<br />
of the Friendship Treaty between China and Japan, and agreed that<br />
these events created new opportunities for these countries to play<br />
a positive and constructive role in the Asia/ Pacific region.<br />
They expressed the hope that the Soviet Union would make a similar<br />
constructive contribution.<br />
The two leaders expressed serious concern about the situation<br />
in Indo-China and called for a settlement of differences among<br />
the parties concerned. They agreed that disputes should be<br />
settled by peaceful means, and without resort to the use of force.<br />
The President and the Prime Minister referred to the critical<br />
importance of the 5th Session of the United Nations Conference on<br />
Trade and Development, currently being held in Manila. They agreed<br />
that its location and timing made the present conference especially<br />
important. The immediately preceding period had been one of<br />
reduced growth of world trade caused by inflation and leading to<br />
the spread of unemployment and the dangerous increase of protectionism. ./ 2 </p>

The two leaders recalled the part they and their governments<br />
has played to date in bringing about an agreement on the basic<br />
elements of a Common Fund, and welcomed the prospects it brings<br />
for greater stability in commodity prices at levels which are<br />
remunerative to producers and equitable to consumers. They<br />
expressed the firm conviction that the Fund should be established<br />
as soon as possible.<br />
They also called, in particular, upon producers and consumers<br />
to proceed to negotiate expeditiously appropriate international<br />
commodity agreements and arrangements under the Integrated<br />
Programme for Commodities of which the Common Fund was a key<br />
instrument.<br />
The President and the Prime Minister agreed further that there<br />
was a need to look to the future and to improve on the results<br />
of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. It was of critical<br />
importance to achieve significant reductions in barriers to<br />
world trade. In this context, they noted that high rates of<br />
inflation were a significant element in the slower growth in<br />
volume of international trade and in market opportunities for<br />
all countries, especially developing ones. They therefore called<br />
upon countries, and in particular the major industrialized ones,<br />
to pursue policies to bring inflation under control.<br />
The President and the Prime Minister were pleased with the<br />
contribution that had been made by ASEAN to political stability and<br />
the economic and social development of the region. The<br />
Prime Minister emphasized Australia's strong commitment to<br />
South-East Asia and the whole-hearted support for ASEAN, which he<br />
referred to as an excellent example of the strength and stability<br />
which could be achieved through regional cooperation. It was a<br />
basic element of Australia's policy to work closely and<br />
cooperatively with ASEAN in all matters.<br />
The two leaders discussed the new Australian low air fare scheme<br />
and, in this connection, they welcomed the progress made in the<br />
discussions at the recent meeting of Australia and ASEAN officials<br />
in Kuala Lumpur, including the agreement to recommend to ASEAN<br />
and Australian Ministers a settlement on a package basis.<br />
The President and the Prime Minister agreed to start discussions<br />
on arrangements covering routes between Australia, the Philippines<br />
and countries to the north.<br />
The President and the Prime Minister reviewed the full range of the<br />
bilateral relationship between the Philippines and Australia and<br />
were able to settle a number of issues, thus clearing the way for<br />
the fuller development of the existi ng network of<br />
bilateral agreements.<br />
Referring to the Nuclear Safeguards Agreement which has just<br />
been concluded,-the two leaders agreed that this would be the<br />
basis for subsequent arrangements for the supply of uranium from<br />
Australia to the Philippines. ./ 3 </p>

The President and the Primc Minister noted that while the value<br />
of trade between the two countries has increased considerably,<br />
there remains a significant balance in Australia's favour. In<br />
this context, they noted and the President welcomed the<br />
arrangements that the Australian Government was making to<br />
increase market opportunities for exports to Australia from the<br />
Philippines and other ASEAN countries.<br />
The two leaders welcomed the exchange of letters of ratification<br />
which they had authorized to bring into force the trade<br />
agreement between Australia and the Philippines and agreed<br />
that this was a significant development.<br />
The Prime Minister and the President further welcomed the signing<br />
of a double taxation agreement between the two countries which<br />
would help promote greater economic cooperation.<br />
These various agreements, together with the accompanying<br />
strengthening of the political relationship, reflected the growing<br />
warmth and cooperation between the Philippines and Australia.<br />
The two leaders recognized the considerable prospects for the<br />
substantial growth in tourism between Australia and the<br />
Philippines and agreed to consider early measures to realize this<br />
potential. The President welcomed the continuing commitment of the<br />
Australian Government to the economic development of the<br />
Philippines through its various aid programs, and the Prime Minister<br />
confirmed that the Australian Government expected to maintain<br />
its aid allocations to the Philippines.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the Australian Government had<br />
studied a recent Philippines request for assistance in the<br />
development of its energy capability, and confirmed that Australia<br />
would provide such assistance. The President welcomed the<br />
Prime Minister's assurance that Australia intended to be a reliable and<br />
reasonable supplier of energy sources to the Philippines.<br />
The Prime Minister expressed his pleasure and deep gratitude to the<br />
President and Government of the Republic of the Philippines for<br />
their invitation to him to visit Manila,, and for the excellent<br />
arrangements and gracious hospitality that had been offered<br />
to his party. The President accepted an invitation by the<br />
Prime Minister to visit Australia at a mutually convenient time.<br />
