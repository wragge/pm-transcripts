TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION FOLLOWING LECTURE TO THE<br />
ASIA-AUSTRALIA INSTITUTE, BRISBANE, 26 OCTOBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Q: I notice when you were talking about the focus of Australian trade you<br />
spoke of the Asia-Pacific and including the United States, but India<br />
was not included. Now, India is a country of 600 or 800 million now<br />
with projections to be quite possibly the fifth largest economy in<br />
years, you did not refer to that, is that intentional or<br />
PM: Well, India is not a part of APEC, not that the talk was solely or<br />
exclusively about APEC. I think there are substantial opportunities in<br />
India, but I think that it is a market, probably, we have been a bit late in<br />
accessing and one can't deduce from that that the opportunities have<br />
gone. I'm sure that is not true and some Australian companies are<br />
drifting there, as you know, one of our banks has got a major banking<br />
facility there. But, it is only, I suppose, in recent times that the Indian<br />
economy has started to really open up and that is probably where the<br />
interest is starting to come. We have had Indian Prime Minsters and<br />
Ministers coming to Australia periodically and periodically we have had<br />
these commitments and declarations of interest in one another, but<br />
they tend to fade away and change as Prime Ministers change.<br />
Therefore, to get the consistency of interest there is, I think, quite a<br />
challenge and would require a very large effort on behalf of the<br />
government and on behalf of the private interests in this country. It<br />
just seemed to me that for as far as I am concerned the more<br />
immediate and obvious place to start this sort of effort in the region<br />
was with Indonesia which is strategically more significant to us and<br />
one which, I think, politically had languished over the years.<br />
So, there has been that focus, the focus on ASEAN because it is part<br />
of ASEAN and we trade with Singapore and Thailand et cetera and we<br />
have got the big established trading linkages with Japan, Korea and<br />
increasingly with China. And, the fact that APEC in some respects<br />
defines them too has, if you like, sharpened our focus. But, it is not to<br />
say that I don't think there are opportunities in India or that we won't be<br />
exploiting them. But, I do think that working closer to home as we are </p>
<p>and working within the framework of APEC is a case of prioritising<br />
one's effort I suppose.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, I wonder if we could publicly have a response from you<br />
to Professor Fitzgerald's response to your speech?<br />
PM: You mean the last part of his remarks about east Asia?<br />
Q: I mean the remarks about the potential for new and alternative<br />
groupings to APEC to appear?<br />
PM: I think what Stephen was speaking of was at some point an emerging<br />
confidence in Asia about Asia itself. About an Asian Asia. That is,<br />
one where there is a notion of some perpetuality in economic activity,<br />
that is, self sustenance about their economic activity within the area<br />
we broadly describe as Asia and a more intuitive understanding of<br />
culture, cultural differences, even cultural sensitivities within an Asian<br />
context. I think that is entirely possible and to some extent that has<br />
always been there. APEC is not there because it is the first thing we<br />
thought of. It is there because we don't want to see the United States<br />
stay at home with NAFTA, we don't want to see the United States<br />
become more inward looking, we don't want to see it's Latin agenda<br />
overtake its international ambitions and to keep it more strategically<br />
engaged in Asia means that we don't see the world drop into three<br />
blocs Europe, the Americas and Asia. So, there is a sense to APEC,<br />
it marries the United States to East Asia, it keeps the United States<br />
from going protectionist and unilateralist and it gets them involved in a<br />
multilateral way, it extends that strategic cover for Japan which keeps<br />
Japan away from the development of its own strategic force which, I<br />
think, keeps the temperature down in North Asia and at the same time<br />
APEC gives Japan a chance to rebuild and change its political<br />
structures and find a new place for itself in Asia and the Asia-Pacific.<br />
Whereas, I think, an exclusively Asian structure today would subjugate<br />
Japanese interest, or attempt to, which is not good for Japan and it is<br />
not good for us and it is not good for the United States.<br />
Therefore, APEC fits the bill, I think, in terms of the economic<br />
imperative for the Asian economies, the need for strategic peace in<br />
North Asia, keeping the US out of home and well and truly on the<br />
streets is a very important thing, I think, to be doing at this point and<br />
before there will be any notion of an emerging group as Stephen sees<br />
it, will be a time further down the trail when China's power as an<br />
economic and military power will be greater. Such a region will have a<br />
very heavy influence on China and one couldn't be sure that everyone<br />
else is going to sign up to that. I'm quite sure the Ambassador would<br />
be quite happy for people to be more influenced by China over time<br />
which is a completely reasonable national aspiration.<br />
So, with Japan, we often say it and it is worth saying again, Japan is<br />
Asian, but it is not part of Asia and before it signs up to be part of Asia<br />
there is going to have to be a lot of political change in Japan and it's </p>
<p>not here yet. The very interesting thing is the Stephen referred to<br />
the Malaysian proposal which has a lot of the antecedence about it<br />
that APEC has. But you see Japan won't touch it, because for the<br />
reasons, I think, that I am saying and that is that Japan wants to keep<br />
US strategic cover and US engagement militarily and economically in<br />
the region, though, I am sure it has sympathies with the general<br />
proposition which Malaysia has put.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, this is not so much a question as an addition to your<br />
comment on India. That is, that now as you said the doors are being<br />
opened, Austrade is in the process of establishing three trading places<br />
in India for the first time. As you know it all costs money and<br />
fortunately you gave me a very generous minister in Bob McMullan<br />
and when we submitted to him the need to be represented more<br />
directly in India he agreed to meet the bill. But this is happening right<br />
now, so I thought you would might like to..<br />
PM: Interesting for the audience and for me.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, I am delighted at your enthusiasm for APEC which we<br />
are all familiar with. As you know we invented it at our research<br />
school.<br />
PM: Everybody says that.<br />
Q: That's right, but I think Ross Garnaut and Peter Drysdale would make<br />
a claim to it.<br />
PM: No, I think the people that make a claim to it I could tell you where<br />
APEC came from. It came from Sandy Hollway in Bob Hawke's office<br />
and it came from someone in the department. That's where it came<br />
from and the Heads of Government meeting came from me and that is<br />
the end of the story.<br />
Q: As a professional historian I find it very interesting to watch history<br />
being created. The question I was going to ask was when we look at<br />
APEC, of course, we are all inclined to a great enthusiasm and<br />
optimism. But, there are those who look at our region and see other<br />
more worrying things on horizon in particular there are some people<br />
very concerned that about extensive defence modernisation programs<br />
in the region, whether or not one feels this really constitutes an arms<br />
race. Certainly there are offensive capacities being built and I wonder<br />
if you would like to speak for a few minutes about your picture of the<br />
strategic environment of our region over the next few years?<br />
PM: That is a very tough subject, I think, to be crystal ball gazing about or<br />
to be talking prescriptively about how that will change. I don't find it<br />
too difficult to understand that with the cold war, bi-polarity taken away<br />
and some of the regional tensions becoming more manifest that people<br />
take some defensive steps in terms of their own strategic capacity. It<br />
doesn't surprise me. We are seeing some substantial expenditures in I </p>
<p>the area, but again, where it matters in North Asia the Japanese<br />
political system is largely confining its interests again to a self defence<br />
force. It still spends a substantial proportion of its GDP on it, but<br />
again, it is a very clear political commitment to maintaining the force as<br />
a self defence force without an offensive capability. China is spending<br />
a substantial proportion of its national income on modernisation of its<br />
defence force. This, countries generally do. There is some concern in<br />
the region about the extension of Chinese maritime capacity. I'm sure<br />
everyone will continue to keep an eye on that. The nuclear capacity of<br />
North Korea is a matter of concern, but again, I think the agreement<br />
which has been brokered with the United States will go a substantial<br />
way to coming to terms with that and I think the other sub-regional<br />
expenditures within ASEAN and those other places are such as I think<br />
probably most countries with any financial capability will choose to<br />
upgrade their armed forces and to select modern and appropriate<br />
equipment. I think the change in the capacity of countries in this<br />
region to improve their military capabilities is, in fact, a function of their<br />
wealth. As their wealth has risen so has their capacity to do things.<br />
Not everyone has done it well as you know. There is a lot of junk<br />
around the world and the thing not do is buy junk because in the end if<br />
what modern conflicts are showing us is that it is the razor's edge that<br />
matters. But, because the strategic environment is so quiet, I think,<br />
people can see the effective life of the stuff through and they'll come<br />
out the other side during a phase when, I hope, Australia will be a<br />
substantial supplier of defence products.<br />
So, I don't find a remarkably uncertain or inexplicable development on<br />
our hands.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, I just wonder if I could ask you a question about the<br />
forthcoming APEC summit. There was a report that China has rejected<br />
the notion that APEC should promote binding agreements that it would<br />
only agree to a general goal rather than any binding agreement. My<br />
question is in two parts. Do you see the APEC leaders producing a<br />
binding agreement or merely a loose declaration of a general goal and<br />
what is your position, in principal, on the debate about whether APEC<br />
liberalisation should be on a Most Favoured Nation ( MEN) basis or on<br />
a preferential basis?<br />
PM: The very nature of the APEC meeting is that it is unstructured that the<br />
leaders meet themselves without officials. And if one looks at the<br />
success in Seattle with the adoption of a second meeting therefore<br />
giving the APEC leaders some form as a forum, and the adoption of<br />
trade investment, investment agreements, trade facilitation issues et<br />
cetera, I think, the lesson from that is that the leaders when they get<br />
together, if they wish, can get things done and that is what I hope will<br />
happen at Bogor.<br />
Again, this will be a very fluid thing and it will be fluid right until the<br />
moment it meets. It is a most ambitious undertaking. Two years ago,<br />
let me tell you this, I first raised the notion of the APEC area meeting </p>
<p>at heads of government or leaders level with George Bush when he<br />
came to Australia on new years day 1992. That is to answer my<br />
friends question here, that is where it started. I then opened it up with<br />
President Soeharto, with President Kim Young Sam and others around<br />
the region. That was just a couple of years ago, but already we have<br />
got it to the point where we have been able to have a first meeting at<br />
President Clinton's invitation where it has gone to a second meeting at<br />
the behest of President Soeharto and where we have already adopted<br />
a substantial trade liberalisation agenda. Now, this is taking APEC a<br />
long way in a very short time, but, I think, Australia has been hungry<br />
for change and ambitious for it. We have supported President<br />
Soeharto in his attempt to move the agenda to trade liberalisation.<br />
There is now quite a deal of support for that. One of the things that<br />
surprised me is how quickly this has been internalised in Australia.<br />
People have stuck that in their pocket as though it is a fait accompli:<br />
' oh that's that bit done, what's next?' The sort of rampant naivety of<br />
this and I am not suggesting this is your view Greg ( Sheridan) because<br />
it isn't, but the rampant naivety of this is I mean it is a terrible thing<br />
in the Australian media that everything has such a short span of<br />
attention now, that serious and complex issues are dealt with quickly:<br />
one night on television, a follow up story in the day's paper done<br />
that's it. Well, big issues like this just go on and on and I hope that we<br />
can get to a declaratory position at Bogor. At this stage, it looks like<br />
there is every possibility that we will, but let's get there first before we<br />
accept it and internalise it and take it as part of the commercial wall<br />
paper of the region.<br />
So, there is that about it. When leaders meet and decide something<br />
like this, it is not a loose or waffly declaration, it will mean something.<br />
When you sit half the world's population and half the world's GDP<br />
down and they agree to something, what greater authority needs to be<br />
brought to bear to make it firm? Now, what happens then in its<br />
facilitation is a different question, but that's an entirely subordinate<br />
question to the primary one about the doing of it in the first place.<br />
There are some who in this country who argue about this question<br />
about MFN ( Most Favoured Nation) and preferential, that this needs to<br />
be decided first before you can make any declarations. Well, none of<br />
these people have ever been around cutting tariffs. I'm the only one in<br />
the Australian debate still around who has been in the tariff cutting<br />
business and it is a pretty tough caper to be in let me tell you.<br />
Therefore, the observation I would make is that when one looks at the<br />
very high tariff levels in Asia and the non-tariff barriers, the task of<br />
getting them down is so great that what I say is let's get cracking on<br />
the task, make sure the task whatever we do is GATT consistent and<br />
then worry about whether a particular country wants to extend the<br />
preference or not. That is, whether it's MFN or its preferential. But,<br />
you would swear blind the way some people speak, we have already<br />
got the tariffs down and we are now deciding whether we are going to<br />
let the world in to have a crack at it, have a piece of it or are we going<br />
to keep it to ourselves. At the moment, the task is untouched. So, I </p>
<p>think the first thing is to in the minds of the APEC leaders, understand<br />
that the velocity of trade and investment will be improved by lower tariff<br />
and non-tariff barriers, to declare that they wish to bring them down on<br />
a phased basis over a period of time and then the third task is to get<br />
on and do it and including in that whether in fact countries want to<br />
extend the preference outside or to contain it.<br />
Now, for my part, I have said tonight and let me repeat. I don't think<br />
that there is any value for us in seeking to develope a bloc in Asia<br />
because that is the thing we are trying to avoid. The whole point of<br />
putting the Americas together with Asia in APEC is not to produce a<br />
preferential area. But, not all countries will take that view. Well, that's<br />
all right, the world isn't simple, but some of this academic debate that<br />
says we've got to tidy that up first before we can move on with the<br />
primary debate is naive and immature in my view. This is a real world<br />
tough issue and it is going to take a long time to work our way through,<br />
but the end result can be a massive improvement in wealth in this<br />
region and we have just got to take the chance and go and do it.<br />
Q: One of the hallmarks, I think, of your Government and Prime<br />
Ministership has been the opening up of trade and links with Asia and<br />
so on. I think that has been something which is very desirable, but<br />
one of the pieces of legislation which has been passed has been the<br />
foreign investment funds legislation or ElF, I think, the intention that,<br />
quite admirably, is to try and capture the Bonds and Skases of the<br />
world, but the way that it has been implemented has been to, on the<br />
ground, to greatly restrict the range of choices for ordinary Australians<br />
to invest in overseas markets and particularly the Asian markets and I<br />
wonder if you'd like to comment. I don't know whether you are aware<br />
of that, but the reality is that we now have, the business that I am<br />
involved in, an enormously lesser choice available to us as a result of<br />
that legislation and I think that the costs of it are far greater than the<br />
government would ever earn in terms of tax and whatever was<br />
intended to be achieved by the passage of it.<br />
PM: Essentially it was a tax efficiency thing. I mean, the alternative is to<br />
run a foreign tax credit system where you bring your dividends home<br />
upon which the local tax has been paid and then you top it up to the<br />
Australian corporate rate. So, if you pay whatever it is, 18 per cent in<br />
Hong Kong or where ever it might be and you bring the dividends<br />
home you top them up to 33. Now, the problem for us was that if you<br />
look at the OECD area, you have Australian companies in Germany, in<br />
France, in Britain running a European business say, where in one<br />
country the corporate rate is 36, the rate in another country is 35, in<br />
another country it is 38, so there is an enormous accounting task<br />
bringing these dividends home and accounting for it if there isn't to be<br />
any primary tax paid here. So, what we said was let's make this<br />
simple, we'll have a white list, if you bring dividends home from<br />
countries on the white list we will assume that the company tax has<br />
been paid there and you don't need to top it up here. But, if it is not on<br />
the white list it is obviously on the back list. The white list extends </p>
<p>through all of the OECD area, that's the 24 member states of the<br />
OECD, and a large part of Asia and we also have an active income<br />
test and a passive income test so if you are a hole-in-the outfit in Hong<br />
Kong with your name on an accountants door, you don't pass the<br />
active income test, but if you are like Pioneer Concrete and you are<br />
making concrete in Hong Kong you do pass it. So, even though it may<br />
be regarded as tax haven, we don't require a topping up to the<br />
corporate tax rate for the dividends here if you are actively involved in<br />
that country. But, if people are involved there because it is simply a<br />
tax haven or it is low taxed then if it is not on the white list we tax you<br />
on an accumulations basis. That is, not even on a distribution, we tax<br />
you on an accumulations basis.<br />
If you ask most Australian companies are they better off with that<br />
system than a foreign tax credit system, I'm sure they'll answer they<br />
think they are better off with that system. Let me say in some places<br />
take Indonesia where they have specific tax holidays for tax free<br />
development zones or in Malaysia where there are development<br />
zones, under our double tax agreements we recognise tax sparing. In<br />
other words, we regard as legitimate for the purposes of development<br />
of those countries, income earned in those particular parts which are<br />
free of tax or have very low tax rates. So, if you go through the white<br />
list, all the OECD, a large part of Asia, no problem about bringing<br />
dividends home. If you are in a tax haven and you can pass the active<br />
income test, no problem. If you are in a developing country which has<br />
got a development preference, if we give it tax sparing under our<br />
double tax agreement you have got no problem either. That means<br />
that if you have got an active business somewhere and you believe<br />
that the country should be white listed or alternatively that you can<br />
pass the active income test, then I don't think it is much of a problem.<br />
But, there is no doubt there are some countries that are not on the<br />
white list and people can still operate there, it's just that they are taxed<br />
on an accumulations basis as they earn their income and they'll get<br />
assessments from the tax office as that income is declared.<br />
The alternative is to junk the system and go back to a foreign tax credit<br />
system. For major public companies accounting for tax variations of 1<br />
or 2 or 3 per cent across say Europe, or even around this part of the<br />
world is, I think, too much of a burden. Largely I thought this system<br />
was largely working not too badly. I'm not saying that your example is<br />
not without some justice, it may well be, but in all tax things there is no<br />
perfection. You have got to make some rule of thumb issues and the<br />
rule of thumb in making this work is a white list and if you are not on<br />
the white list, well, you know what list you are on.<br />
ends </p>
