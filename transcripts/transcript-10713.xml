<p>This is a great day for the Australian economy and for the Australian</p>
<p>   people. And we're introducing into Parliament an historic reform</p>
<p>   of our taxation system that will build an even stronger Australia</p>
<p>   in the next century. We've had dramatic evidence of just how</p>
<p>   strongly the Australian economy has grown despite the Asian downturn.</p>
<p>   We have defied that downturn. And we have another cut in interest</p>
<p>   rates, which is good news for homebuyers. It adds up to the strongest</p>
<p>   and best run economy Australia has seen for 30 years. It's</p>
<p>   good news all round and it's certainly a defiant repudiation</p>
<p>   of the doomsday talk from our political opponents. </p>
