    <content><![CDATA[<p>18 September 1980</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government has decided to support the establishment of the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence which was recommended at the meeting of the Australian Police Ministers' Council on 29 August, 1980. The Bureau, which will clearly require some time to become operational, will be concerned with a broad range of law enforcement intelligence covering all forms of criminal activity. The Prime Minister has sought Premiers' comments<br />on this proposal.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister has also today, written to all Premiers and the Chief Minister, seeking their consideration of matters relating to the Steering Committee of Commonwealth/ State Ministers to oversee and co-ordinate recommendations of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs.</p>
<p>The Steering Committee, which was agreed' to at the most recent Premiers' Conference, will have an important role in continuing governmental action to tackle the problem of drug trafficking and related crimes.</p>
<p>The Prime minister has sought advice from the Premiers and Chief Minister with respect to State/ Territory nominees on the Committee and proposals for the agenda of the inaugural meeting.</p>
<p>Arrangements for the first meeting of the Committee will be taken up by the incoming Government. In the meantime, and parallel with meetings of that Committee, consideration of specific issues raised in the Royal Commission's Report and any other relevant reports will continue in other specialised forums, such as the Australian Police Ministers' Council, the Ministers' for Health Conference, and the Standing Committees of Attorneys-General and of Social Welfare ministers.</p>
