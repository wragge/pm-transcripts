PRIME MINISTER 43/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE lION P J KEATING MP<br />
I I OWARD AND CONNOLLY HUM I IIATED TOGETH ER<br />
The preselection of Brendan Nelson for the seat of Bradficld is a humiliating defcat for<br />
John Howard, and confirms the weakncss of his leadership.<br />
Mr Howard's attempt to cling to the past has now becn repudiated by his own party in<br />
a number of prcsclcction contests. Whatever he might say to the contrary, John<br />
I loward endorscd David Connolly, and this defeat mcans lis support counts for little.<br />
This leaves thc Parliamentary Liberal Party without a credible spokesman on<br />
superannuation matters, at the end of a week in which the Government has introduced<br />
one of the biggest savings changes in the nalion's history.<br />
There arc at least two lessons in this. One is that the Liberal Party is now so moribund<br />
that one of its safest seats can be hijacked by an opportunist.<br />
It is also a lesson for David Connolly. Rifling through the garbage bins and household<br />
expenses of the Lodge to which he devoted himself for the past couple of years<br />
was no way to make a serious contribution to public life, and his electorate has made<br />
him pay the ultimate price.<br />
