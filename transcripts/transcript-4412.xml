FOR PRESS 24 MAY 1977<br />
ALLEGATIONS OF C. I. A. ACTIVITY IN AUSTRALIA<br />
We have seen over the last four weeks efforts to expose some<br />
of Australia's most closely held secrets and to publicise<br />
allegations based on hearsay or worse, to the embarrassment<br />
of Australla's relations with the United States our closest ally.<br />
Accordingly, I believe it is important that I make a statement on<br />
these matters and attempt to put them in a proper perspective.<br />
Any public dicussion which disregards Australia's interest is of<br />
serious concern to the Government. Those who are opposed to<br />
our alliance with the United States have naturally sought to<br />
exploit this issue for their own purposes.<br />
The situation I have described has been precipitated by the<br />
allegations of one Christopher Boyce, a twenty-three year old<br />
communications clerk, who was on trial in California and has<br />
since been convicted of selling United States secrets to the<br />
Soviet Union. His allegations about C. I. A. activities in<br />
Australia were an attempt to rationalise his crimes.<br />
The Government has examined relevant p~ arts of the transcript<br />
of the Boyce trial which in fact add little or nothing to the<br />
allegations which have already appeared in the media. I shall<br />
arrange for a copy of this transcript to be placed in the<br />
Parliamentary Library for the information of honourable members.<br />
We have since seen some former members of the C. I. A. making,<br />
for their own motives, hearsay allegations, some of which would<br />
appear to come within the ambit of what is known as " disinformation<br />
or the attempt to gain political ends through false and misleading<br />
information. it has been the Government's longstanding policy to avoid comment<br />
on matters involving intelligence and security. There are good<br />
reasons for this policy in that the mere act of denying<br />
specific allegations can often provide important leads , and be<br />
damaging to our and our allies' national security. I do not<br />
therefore intend to deal with specific allegations which have<br />
been made. -Ij TR ALI AL </p>

As part of our defence relationship with the United<br />
States, there have grown up extensive arrangements for<br />
exchanging information and views with a wide range of U. S.<br />
Government agencies including those in the intelligence and<br />
security field. Under these arrangements officers from<br />
U. S. agencies are declared to the A~ istralian authorities and<br />
work with various Australian agencies. Of course, Ministers<br />
with relevant responsibilities know who they are.<br />
Australian officers are engaged in similar declared capacities<br />
in Washington. These arrangements are long standing and have been<br />
and still are, of great value to Australia. They are an important<br />
aspect of the close and intimate relationship which we have with<br />
the United States. Through these arrangements we have access<br />
to and exchange valuable information with the United States<br />
on a wide range of international strategic developments as<br />
well as security and intelligence matters such as espionage<br />
and international terrorism to name two examples which<br />
contribute in the broadest terms to the protection of Australia<br />
and the Australian community.<br />
There is also a long established convention that close allies<br />
do not conduct covert activities within each other's territories.<br />
Such activirties are not necessary between friends. In this<br />
connection I wish to reassure the nation that I have carefully<br />
reviewed the activities of the United States Government in<br />
Australia and have found them to be fully consistent with the<br />
interests and policies of the Australian Government and people.<br />
I am satisfied with the assurances I have received from elements<br />
of my own. Government and from President Carter personally through<br />
his Ambassador, that neither the United States Government<br />
not its representatives are involved in improper or<br />
inappropriate activities here. Our joint activities with them<br />
are important to the national security of both countries.<br />
Furthermore, we are most happy with the results we are obtaining<br />
from these activities.<br />
I appreciate that some honourable gentlemen opposite enjoy<br />
deceiving themselves with conspiracy theories, and would like to<br />
believe that it was the C. I. A. rather than the Australian<br />
electorate which put them out. of office. Such views are, however,<br />
not merely politically self-serving, but naive.<br />
They will also be aware that, in recent times, the activities<br />
of the unlike most other foreign intelligence services,<br />
have been kept under close scrutiny by the United States Congress;<br />
and that allegations of improper activity will be investigated<br />
as a matter of routine by the Congress.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition has called for a Royal Commission<br />
into the allegations which have been made. I believe that such<br />
an inquiry is totally unnecessary. I note that the Leader,<br />
when Prime Minister, sought and was advised of the names of<br />
representatives of United States intelligence agencies then in<br />
Australia. He was apparently then satisfied with the information<br />
he received because after detailed inquiry he took no further action<br />
in relation to it. / 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
The Royal Commissioner on Security and Intelligence, Mr<br />
Justice Hope, who was appointed by the Leader of the Opposition<br />
in August 1974, has recently completed a most extensive series<br />
of investigations and reports on all, aspects of Australian<br />
intelligence and security. His investigations included the<br />
activities of foreign intelligence services in Australia.<br />
There isnothing in the Royal Commissoner's reports which give<br />
any substance to the allegati ons relating to C. I. A. activity<br />
which have occupied so mu ch attention over the last four weeks.<br />
Mr Justice Hope has made recommendations to incr-ease the<br />
effectiveness of our internal security arrangements. These concern<br />
the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in particular<br />
and are aimed at ensuring that it will be better equipped in the<br />
future to meet its responsibilities for investigating and<br />
providing intelligence about threats to the internal security<br />
of the nation. Mr Justice Hope's recommendations have already<br />
been the subject of detailed study and I shall be making a<br />
statement to the House after my return from the Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government Meeting in London about the Government's decisions.<br />
As I have Already said in this House, I look to the Australian<br />
Security Intelligence Organisation to provide timely advice on<br />
all matters which might affect the security of this country,<br />
including improper activities by any foreign intelligence<br />
service in Australia.<br />
It i s my belief that the Director-General of Mr Justice<br />
Woodward, carries out this responsibility creditably and faithfully.<br />
Similarly, the Leader of the Opposition, whose Government appointed<br />
Mr Justice 1Woodward, has recently re-affirmed in the House his<br />
confidence in the Director-General.<br />
Improper activities by the representatives in Australia of any<br />
foreign government have in the past arid would in the future<br />
be regarded just as seriously by my Government as they have<br />
been by previous Australian Governments. 0) 00000000 </p>
