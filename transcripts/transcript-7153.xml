TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW ON 11.00 AM WITH PAUL LYNEHAM<br />
THURSDAY, 2 APRIL, 1987<br />
LYNEHAM: How do you react to John Howard's comments that you<br />
have been quite pathetic, full of humbug and you have chickened<br />
out of an early election?<br />
PM: I am like the great majority of Australians who find it<br />
increasingly difficult to take seriously anything that this<br />
gentleman says.<br />
LYNEHAM: if your pollster Rod Cameron had told you you were<br />
certain of victory you would have gone like a shot though<br />
wouldn't you?<br />
PM: Not like a shot. I think no Prime Minister has ever been<br />
more frank than I was yesterday. I admitted to the fact there<br />
was a very considerable temptation to run. And it is obviously<br />
true that if it had been a yawning chasm between us, that<br />
temptation may have been impossible to resist. But I want to<br />
say, as frankly as I can to your viewers, that I had been calling<br />
the shots honestly when I had said all along that my preference<br />
was for the Parliament to go its full term. I do attach<br />
importance to my integrity and I had said that I wanted the<br />
Parliament to go its full, tbrm. I have been honest in saying<br />
that it was a considerable temptation. And if there had been an<br />
overwhelming view that Labor was in front and should win, then<br />
the argument would have been very strong that here was this<br />
feeling, lets go and get the mandate, and get on with it. But I<br />
had to, in all conscious balance all those sets of considerations<br />
and I must say that I just feel very very much more comfortable<br />
inside myself.<br />
LYNEHAM: A fresh mandate now though would have allowed you to<br />
cut public spending without immediate political worries. Now<br />
you are relying on the Australian people taking this medicine and<br />
still voting for you.<br />
PM: That would have been the easy way. I preface my comment by<br />
saying I'm totally certain that I would have won an early<br />
election. And so in that sense yes it would have been the easy<br />
way. LYNEHAM: Now your pinning a lot on the high-mindedness of the<br />
Australian people. 2c). </p>
<p>PM: As I said in my press conference yesterday Paul, I've been<br />
in public life now for nearly 30 years. And what has informed me<br />
at every stage of my involvement in public life is a basic faith<br />
in the good sense of the Australian people.<br />
LYNEHAM: Even people whose living standards have been falling.<br />
Senator Peter Walsh said its very hard for a government to<br />
survive after presiding over a long period of falling living<br />
standards. PM: That has been said, but as I put it again yesterday. The $ 6<br />
billion loss of our national income, wipe-off through the<br />
reduction in the price of our exports. That means about $ 1,500<br />
per Australian family. We are the poorer as a nation. It is not<br />
something that is a figure of the statistician, that is the fact.<br />
Now a responsible government must so conduct policy as to adjust<br />
to that fact. Now I believe that the Australian electorate, the<br />
great majority of them are sensible and will understand that and<br />
they will be saying, well we trust Hawke and his Government to<br />
undertake that adjustment process in a fairer way. than the other<br />
mob. I I </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: I think your decision too, if I'm right, is that you<br />
believe your policies will see some of the key economic<br />
indicators like inflation, interest rates and unemployment<br />
looking a lot brighter towards the year's end.<br />
PM: Yes. It has been my assessment before I had this reasonably<br />
long session with economists from the Treasury and my own<br />
department, and all my advisers will tell you I'd given virtually<br />
the same analysis myself before then. I do believe that our<br />
policies are working. I believe, on all the evidence, that we're<br />
seeing an increase in the exports of manufactured exports that<br />
our entrepreneurs are starting to take advantage of the<br />
significant improvement in our competitiveness that has come with<br />
the depreciation, that the major impact on the inflation rate of<br />
the increase of import prices associated with the depreciation<br />
and most of that has washed into the CPI. And therefore, I<br />
expect the inflation rate to be coming down through 1987.<br />
LYNEHAM: As low as the OECD suggested, 5 to 5.5 per cent, by mid<br />
next year? That's a big drop isn't it?<br />
PM: Yes. But I ask you to remember that between March of 1983,<br />
when I came into Government, and the beginning of 1985 we'd<br />
brought inflation down from 11.2 per cent of Mr Howard, that we<br />
inherited, to 5 per cent. That was before we got the impact of<br />
these external factors.<br />
LYNEHAM: Well if these indicators are looking better, what will<br />
living standards be like for the average family by the year's<br />
end, do you think? I mean, are we in for a long haul, or is it<br />
just 12 months of belt tightening?<br />
PM: In 1987 there will be still a need for restraint and some<br />
reduction in standards. As we come out of 1987 into 88 the<br />
evidence will be there that we're on the way up. But this is not<br />
just a short sort of thing. If you have $ 6 billion wiped off<br />
your national income, as I say I've tried to say it so your<br />
viewers and Australians enerally can understand, I've tried to<br />
get it out of the aggregates of economic statistics and say, that<br />
has meant that for every family in this country about $ 1500 has<br />
been wiped off our national capacity. And you just don't get<br />
over that in a few months, or just one year. The important thing<br />
is that you'll see the evidence that the responsible policies<br />
that I'm putting in place, the tough things that I have to do in<br />
May are getting the economy coming back, but not just in a<br />
temporary way. We're getting the fundamentals right for the<br />
restructuring of this economy. I am as certain as I am of<br />
anything Paul, that your viewers out there, the men and women<br />
there, are saying if I've got a choice between the voodoo<br />
economics of your Howards and your Peacocks and your<br />
Bjelke-Petersens, they will give you these big handouts, we'll<br />
have a deficit of $ 10 billion. They know that that would be a<br />
temporary, disastrous phenomenon, which would mean that their<br />
kids are going to pay the price in the next generation. I'm not<br />
prepared to do that and I don't think the Australian people want<br />
it to happen. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: Does a later election, do you think, mean that you'll<br />
be bringing in many of the August budget cuts forward to May, so<br />
that the August budget will be a little softer?<br />
PM: I'd always intended that the May Statement would do most of<br />
the work. The economics of it demand it. The world is looking<br />
at us. Not just as Bob Hawke as Prime Minister. The world is<br />
looking at Australia and saying, have you got the guts, as well<br />
as the economic capacity, the intelligence, but have you got the<br />
guts to face up to the fact that you have had this drop in the<br />
national income. Are you prepared to make the decision?<br />
LYNEHAM: You'll make them even if it costs you government?<br />
PM: I said last year in my Address to the Nation and I repeated<br />
it yesterday in the press conference, there is no way you'll find<br />
this prime minister taking the soft easy options now, in the hope<br />
that taking the soft easy option will guarantee me another ride<br />
into the prime ministership. I would much rather, much rather,<br />
lose office but know that I'd made the right decisions for the<br />
future of this country.<br />
LYNEHAM: Finally, on a personal note, you mentioned your ability<br />
to deal with temptation, yet I saw a photo of Bob Hawke the<br />
Pritikin dieter tucking into a big hamburger at the weekend.<br />
Have you fallen off the low cholesterol diet?<br />
PM: Never believe what you see in the press. It was a dirty big<br />
sausage I was tucking into.<br />
LYNEHAM: ( inaudible)...?<br />
PM: No, just a different form of temptation.<br />
LYNEHAM: What does Mrs Hawke say about this?<br />
PM: She is a marvellous lady. She has learnt to understand over<br />
the years that I don't have an eternal enduring capacity to<br />
resist all forms of temptation and she passed the indiscretion on<br />
the sausage.<br />
LYNEHAM: Thank you for your time.<br />
ends I </p>
