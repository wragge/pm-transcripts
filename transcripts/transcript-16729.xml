    <content><![CDATA[<p>This blog was open for comment from 27-31 July 2009. The topic was Australia's hospital and health care system.</p>
<p>Kevin.Rudd says...</p>
<p>G'day and welcome</p>
<p>Today I want to speak with you about Australia's hospital and health care system and the challenges it faces in the 21st century.</p>
<p>The sad reality is that the problems facing health care have sat at the bottom of the too hard basket for a very long time... for far too long.</p>
<p>Politicians have pointed fingers at everyone other than themselves.</p>
<p>State and federal Governments have beaten their chests with mock indignation.</p>
<p>All in the hope that bluff and bluster would pass for action.</p>
<p>You know it as I do that this approach has not served our country well.</p>
<p>Because amidst the game playing:</p>
<p>     * Our population grew older.</p>
<p>     * Health care costs escalated.</p>
<p>     * The shortages of doctors and nurses became more and more severe.</p>
<p>     * Many people were forced into crowded emergency wards because âout of hospital care' wasn't available.</p>
<p>     * And modern epidemics like obesity, diabetes and mental illness placed even more pressure on the system.</p>
<p>The truth is these pressures are growing by the day yielding these conclusions:</p>
<p>Without fundamental change Australia's health system will buckle under the pressure of demographic change, rising costs and modern diseases.</p>
<p>Under its current structure our health system cannot meet the challenges of the 21st century.</p>
<p>These are the reasons why we commenced and have now concluded the most detailed investigations into the health system since Federation.</p>
<p>Essentially they are a complete health check for Australia's health system.</p>
<p>You can access these reports on this website and also on <a href="http://www.yourhealth.gov.au">www.yourhealth.gov.au</a>.</p>
<p>I urge you to do this because the time has come for us all to develop the solutions.</p>
<p>To this end I will personally hold public community meetings across Australia in the months ahead.</p>
<p>We must consult the people with the greatest stake in the future of our health system... our local doctors, our local nurses,  health care workers, you and your families!</p>
<p>Your views will directly influence the changes we will make to improve the system.</p>
<p>We will afford ourselves six months to develop these plans.</p>
<p>Plans for changes in models of care, a greater emphasis on prevention, improved âout of hospital care' and end to the chronic shortages of doctors and nurses.</p>
<p>Friends, the 21st Century has put our health system on notice. We have now reached the point of no return. That means action is no longer a matter of choice but a matter of necessity.</p>
<p>Let us all be a part of the solution.</p>
<p>So get involved, send me your suggestions, participate in the blog and together let's improve the Australian Health System.</p>
<p>I thank you!</p>
