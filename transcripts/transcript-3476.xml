PRESS STATEMENT NO. 375<br />
19 November 1974<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today sent the<br />
following telegram to Mr. Barry Egan, Secretary, Australian<br />
Workers' Union: " I send my congratulations on the decision<br />
by the shop assistant and other members of your<br />
trade union to respond positively to the Government's<br />
proposals relating to pay claims and the scheme for<br />
introducing cost of living adjustments. To your<br />
trade union, and to all union members, I confirm<br />
that the Government regards the recently announced<br />
cut in taxes as a step which instead of a pay<br />
increase will compensate employees for price<br />
increases in the current October-November-December<br />
period. For the following period the Government<br />
will support before the Arbitration-. Commission<br />
an automatic system of cost of living adjustments<br />
beginning with the consumer price index figure for<br />
March 1975. The Government's policy means that<br />
wage and salary earners will have their real<br />
purchasing power protected. In addition, pay<br />
claims based on productivity, technological change<br />
and other special factors can also be advanced by<br />
unions in arbitration. I suggest that this approach<br />
is in the interests of all employees and of the whole<br />
community. Gough Whitlam".<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T. </p>
