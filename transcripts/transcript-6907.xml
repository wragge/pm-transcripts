PRIME MINISTER<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH TELEVISION JOURNALISTS -TOKYO<br />
MAY 1 986<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, how worried are you about the<br />
economic situation?<br />
PM: Well, the first thing I want to say is that this is not<br />
a time to panic. We have got to recognise that the deficit on<br />
the current account is undesirably high and that we have been<br />
put at a very considerable disadvantage by the drastic<br />
deterioration in the terms of trade especially since last<br />
October. Now the key elements of our policy to deal with that<br />
have to be followed closely. That is there is a need to have<br />
some slowing down of the high levels of growth that we achieved<br />
deliberately in the earlier years. With that slowing down there<br />
has to be a very firm level of fiscal restraint. The task of<br />
the Budget forming process has, if you like, been reinforced<br />
by these figures. And we need to do that because we don't want<br />
to have a situation where there has to be more reliance on<br />
monetary policy.<br />
JOURNALIST:' You have already cut back though very heavily.<br />
Is there much more room to manoeuvre?<br />
PM: By definition when you have had three previous Budgets<br />
when you have tried to cut back there and successfully in<br />
areas of unnecessary expenditure. I means by definition that<br />
the fourth time round the job is harder but we have to do that<br />
because the less you do-in the area of the Budget the more<br />
reliance there may have to be in ' those circumstances on<br />
monetary policy. We also, in the-other arm of policy that is<br />
available to us which has not been available to previous<br />
governments, we must have a continuation of moderate wage<br />
outcomes. I make the point that in the previous history of<br />
Australia you never would have had the moderate'level of wage<br />
outcomes with such high economic growth as we have been able<br />
to have under the operation of the Accord. It is essential that<br />
that continues. So the basic message that I am giving is that<br />
we don't want some dramatic new policy directions but what we<br />
must do is to ensure that existing elements of policy are<br />
utilised firmly to meet the challenge which is proposed for<br />
us as a nation by this unsustainable level of the current<br />
account deficit.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think we are headed for a banana republic?<br />
PM: No I don't. </p>
<p>-2<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister you say that it is not a time for<br />
panic but if there is talk of Australia becoming a banana<br />
republic if we don't get on top of our trade imbalance<br />
surely that suggests some alarm?<br />
PM: Well, let me say if you look at the full context of what<br />
Paul. Keating said you are saying if you don't firmly follow<br />
through the arms of policy that I am talking about, if you don't<br />
have the determination to do that then the alternative is the<br />
sort of thing he was talking about.<br />
JOURNALIST: -Do you share that view though, if policy is not<br />
achieved in the way you have said?<br />
PM: You know I don't go into this hypothetical business. I<br />
simply make the point that Australians in 1983 showed their<br />
capacity in combination with firm leadership by government<br />
to act together in a way which brought Australia out of the<br />
worst recession in 50 years. Never forget that. When we came<br />
to office in the beginning of 1983 it was the worst recession<br />
in 50 years. Now there had to be new policy directions<br />
co-operatively shaped by government with the elements of * the-<br />
Australian population. Now together we have got out of that<br />
worst hole in 50 years. So I am certain we can do the same.<br />
sort of thing against. Not that we are operating from a<br />
low economic base. The problem is in a sense we are paying<br />
the price for our success and the very high'levels of-economic<br />
ac tivity that we have achieved averaging 5% in each of the<br />
last 3 years well above the OECD average. So the problem<br />
now is the challenge of success if you like and-we have<br />
together to be prepared to do that and I am sure we can.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister could I just ask you just to clear<br />
up one point. The tax cuts will be on this August?<br />
PM: I have said that the tax cuts are firmly in place as they<br />
have been announced in the past.<br />
