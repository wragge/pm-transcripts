    <content><![CDATA[<p>I congratulate Megawati Sukarnoputri on her assumption of the office of President of the Republic of Indonesia.</p>
<p>President Megawati has long been a champion of democratic ideals. The Australian Government welcomes the peaceful resolution of political differences by the Indonesian people in accordance with the constitution.</p>
<p>Indonesia is engaged in a transition to a modern, inclusive, decentralised democracy after thirty years of autocratic and centralised rule. This is one of the most momentous changes in the post-Cold War period.</p>
<p>Australia has an important and wide-ranging relationship with Indonesia, which is underpinned by strong people-to-people links. I look forward to working closely with the new President and her government.</p>
<p>Australia wishes President Megawati and the people of Indonesia every success for continued democratic and economic development. We will continue to give Indonesia every support in facing these challenges.</p>
<p>The contribution of former President Wahid in the transition of Indonesia to democracy has been significant and should be acknowledged.</p>
<p>23 July 2001</p>
