The COAG Reform Council's 2010-11 Seamless National Economy Report on Performance, released today, has reported positively on the progress of COAG's 27 deregulation priorities, with 15 having been completed, including one ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Commonwealth, States and Territories agreed to implement regulation and competition reforms, including 27 deregulation priorities.</p>
<p>The deregulation priorities that have been completed include reform of consumer law, product safety, the health workforce, rail safety and consumer credit.</p>
<p>The Productivity Commission recently examined 17 of the deregulation priorities and estimated that, with full implementation, they could lower business costs by about $4 billion per year and, through improvements to productivity, increase GDP by over $6 billion in the longer term.</p>
<p>The report did raise concerns about some priority reforms which have been delayed, by the States and the Commonwealth, and where the outcome may be at risk.  As a reflection of the economic importance of the regulation and competition agenda, the Commonwealth has set aside over $450 million of reward payments associated with these reforms, tied to the delivery of agreed outcomes.</p>
<p>Of most concern is the overhaul of Occupational Health and Safety regulations which provides Australians with a nationally harmonised workplace safety system based on model legislation. This reform was due to be finalised last December.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is committed to leading on the deregulation and reform agendas, in conjunction with all States and Territories, and will drive accountabilities to ensure they are delivered in a full and timely manner.</p>
<p>The 27 deregulation reform priorities will reduce red-tape for business, increase productivity and enable an efficient economy where resources can move to where they can make the greatest economic contribution.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of both levels of government to ensure regulations are in place to lift national productivity and facilitate the mobility and efficient allocation of resources.</p>
<p>As we build a new economy in response to the structural changes afoot because of the relatively high dollar, these objectives are more important than ever.</p>
<p>COAG is considering the Council's Report and will release a response in the near future. </p>
