VISIT BY THE POPE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, John Gorton<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Gorton, said tonight that he was<br />
delighted that the Pope would be visiting Australia.<br />
It would be an historic occasion for Australia and for the<br />
Catholic Church. It would be the first time the Po0pe had travelled so<br />
far from the Holy City.<br />
Mr. Gorton said he felt sure the visit would be warmly welcomed,<br />
not only by the large Roman Catholic community, but by all Australians.<br />
