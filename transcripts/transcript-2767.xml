JJ, AUSTAL IA&amp; L<br />
PROME MONISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 31<br />
January 1973<br />
VISIT TO INDONESIA<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
Mr. E. G. Whitlam, announced today that he would make an official<br />
visit to Indonesia from 20 to 23 February inclusive.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that he would fly to Port Moresby on<br />
18 February and from there to Jakarta, with a brief stop en route<br />
at Bali. He would be accompanied by Mrs. Whitlam.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that he looked forward to the visit<br />
to Indonesia with keen interest.<br />
" It is appropriate that my first visit overseas,, after<br />
my meetings with the leaders of New Zealand and Papua New Guinea,<br />
should be to Indonesia,"! he said.<br />
" Because of its proximity to Australia and Papua New<br />
Guinea, and because of its size and influence in the region,<br />
Indonesia is of major and permanent importance to Australia.<br />
" I have already stated my Government's intention to<br />
develop and strengthen our relations with Indonesia. And I know<br />
from my personal c6ntacts with the Indonesian leaders that this<br />
wish is reciprocated. " The futures of our countries are indissolubly linked<br />
together and our relationship will be a crucial factor in<br />
determining the future of our region for the rest of this century".<br />
Mr. Whitlam added: " I am only sorry that the amount<br />
of work facing me at home prevents me at present from extending<br />
this visit to our other neighbours in the region who also have a<br />
very important place in Australia's international relations".<br />
