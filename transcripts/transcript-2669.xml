OPENING OF THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE<br />
OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS<br />
APPEAL FUND<br />
CANBERRA<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. lion William McMahon<br />
M. P. 31 AUGUST, 1972<br />
S This is a pleasant occasion for me and I hone your appeal<br />
on behalf of the Australian year Of National Development of the<br />
Australian Institute of International Affairs, will attract widespread<br />
support throughout Australia.<br />
In the time I have this evening I want to emphasise two<br />
points that the making and public explanation of Australian foreign<br />
policy is of great and increasing importance to t-he future of this<br />
country; and that our foreign policy should be based on the<br />
understanding and support of the Australian people themselves.<br />
No-one should underestimate the importance of Australia's<br />
involvement in the world around us at a time when there is a<br />
tendency to concentrate on our domestic issues. To underline the<br />
point, may I remind you of a remark made by the late President<br />
i: ennedy. He said once and I quote him: " Domestic policy can<br />
defeat us but foreign policy can kill us."<br />
I endorse and support this view that the survival of<br />
man and the continuing search for progress towards a stable and<br />
peaceful world is very much a practical ani necessary daily<br />
problem for the governments of the world.<br />
A policy of isolation would not be in the best interests<br />
of Australia. Desnite the fact that we are a prosperous island<br />
with relatively few problems, w are directly involved in changing<br />
world conditions of continuing importance to our own future security.<br />
If peace is to be securc in the Asian and Pacific region<br />
in this decade the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan and the<br />
People's Repub'lic of China must come to some accommodationn and a<br />
balance must be found in which each will live with an understanding<br />
of the different systems, goals and aspirations of the others. / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Arrangements must also be made which accommodate the determination<br />
of the smaller countries in the region to preserve and strengthen<br />
their own independent societies. It must be obvious that we in<br />
Australia have a constructive and helpful role to play in the<br />
Pacific threatre. The other point I want to emphasise is that we believe<br />
that Australia's foreign policy should rest on the understanding<br />
and support of an enquiring and well-informed public opinion.<br />
Ideally, in an educated democracy like Australia, foreign<br />
policy should grow out of the people. We want to see a more<br />
outward-looking Australian community with a great feeling of<br />
involvement in the affairs of the world around us, and I would like<br />
this informed public opinion to have more influence on the shaping<br />
of foreign policy. Our own foreign policy will obviously be more<br />
effective and stable if it enjoys widespread support based on the<br />
interest and understanding of an informed public.<br />
An active Australian Institute of International Affairs can<br />
and must play a vital role in improving such interest and<br />
understanding in seeking to inject informed ideas into public<br />
discussion of foreign policy, and in stimulating a greater feeling<br />
of public involvement in international issues facing Australia.<br />
I believe that the work of the Institute is steadily and<br />
surely becoming of greater importance. Indeed, at this stage of our<br />
development, it is a role the Institute is well fitted to play.<br />
More than ever before, we want to establish a more distinctive<br />
Australian identity in a changing world. I therefore welcome the<br />
vision and energy the Institute is showing in seeking to strengthen<br />
its role. The target of the apneal $ 300,000 is a sizable one<br />
and it will not be achieved without considerable effort on the part<br />
of the organisers and without widespread and strong co-operation.<br />
I emphasise that the Institute is independent of the government<br />
the success of the aopeal will strengthen this independence and the<br />
capacity of the Institute and add depth to areas from which the<br />
government may draw in shaping official foreign policy. A<br />
successful appeal will also ensure that funds will be available for<br />
the national headquarters the Institute certainly should have.<br />
For all of these reasons I have the greatest pleasure in<br />
launching the Institute's year of National Development and in<br />
asking you and your friends to contribute to this cause. </p>
