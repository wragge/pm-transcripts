    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government will help create 133,000 jobs, invest $15.1 billion to stimulate the economy and drive significant reform in health, education, housing, business deregulation, and closing the indigenous life expectancy gap.</p>
<p>Through COAG, the Australian Government will invest $15.1 billion in a national reform package focused primarily on improving schools and hospitals, and training more quality teachers, nurses and doctors.</p>
<p>This investment by the Commonwealth Government will deliver a significant stimulus to the Australian economy in the face of the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>HEALTH</p>
<p>The Australian Government will deliver a massive $64.4 billion investment in health and hospital funding, including through the National Healthcare Agreement.</p>
<p>This will deliver more doctors and nurses and will take pressure off our hospitals by investing in keeping people well.</p>
<p>This demonstrates the Rudd Government's determination to work with the States and Territories to end the blame game and help rebuild our public hospitals.</p>
<p>In exchange for this funding, the States and Territories will be required to report on key problem areas, like avoidable deaths and infection rates.</p>
<p>To equip our hospitals for the future, the Government will invest in:</p>
<p>     * A new National Health Care Agreement that will deliver an extra $4.8 billion for public hospitals and a higher rate of annual indexation  -  7.3 per cent into the future</p>
<p>     * A one off injection of $750 million in 2008-09 which could support up to 1.9 million emergency department services to take pressure off emergency departments.</p>
<p>The agreement includes a series of National Partnerships, in which clear benchmarks have been set, including:</p>
<p>     * $1.1 billion to train more doctors, nurses and other health professionals  -  the lifeblood of our health system</p>
<p>     * $500 million as a one off contribution in 2008-09 to deliver an additional 1,600 sub acute beds for over 31,000 patients</p>
<p>     * $448 million to deliver preventative health measures, including reward payments to the states for meeting specified outcomes</p>
<p>     * $806 million to improve Indigenous health and close the life expectancy gap</p>
<p>The additional ongoing resources provided by the Rudd Government in the National Health Care Agreement will be able to provide the equivalent of:</p>
<p>     * 350,000 additional emergency department presentations</p>
<p>     * 200,000 additional same day stays</p>
<p>     * 170,000 additional overnight stays</p>
<p>     * 2.5 million extra services in clinics attached to hospitals</p>
<p>Together with the investments the Government has already made in hospitals, this could support an additional 3,750 beds in 2009-10, growing to 7,800 additional beds by 2012-13.</p>
<p>EDUCATION REVOLUTION</p>
<p>In a new chapter for the education revolution, the Australian Government will invest in an historic education reform package.</p>
<p>This unprecedented COAG reform package will deliver greater transparency in schools, improve teacher quality, improve literacy and numeracy and lift up the most disadvantaged schools in this nation. </p>
<p>The education reform package includes:</p>
<p>     * $42.4 billion National Education Agreement</p>
<p>     * $550 million National Partnership on Improving Teacher Quality</p>
<p>     * $540 million National Partnership on Literacy &amp; Numeracy</p>
<p>     * $1.1 billion National Partnership on Low SES School Communities</p>
<p>     * $807 million for computers in schools on-costs</p>
<p>     * $970 million for Early Childhood reforms</p>
<p>Improving teacher quality requires both improved school leadership by principals and new approaches to teacher recruitment, retention and reward. COAG today agreed to deliver through a specific commitment of $50 million for world leading professional development and support which will empower principals to be able to better manage their schools to achieve improved student results and higher quality.</p>
<p>The $42.4 billion National Education Agreement includes an additional $557 million for government primary schools due to the Rudd Government ending an unfair funding practice where government primary schools received a smaller proportion of funding per student (8.9 per cent of the average cost of educating a child) than government secondary schools (10 per cent).</p>
<p>The Australian Government will offer States and Territories an additional $807 million to meet legitimate and additional costs of the new computers purchased through the National Secondary School Computer Fund, bringing the total commitment to $2 billion over five years.</p>
<p>A STRONGER ECONOMY AND BETTER FEDERATION</p>
<p>New National Partnership Programs payments will also include major reform of the Commonwealth-State relations that will deliver better services to Australian families.</p>
<p>This landmark agreement comes at a difficult time for our economy, in the midst of global crisis that has reduced Commonwealth revenues by $40 billion. These investments will be funded from the existing surpluses over the forward years.</p>
<p>The agreement reached today by the Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments has a strong emphasis on reviving our flagging productivity growth, especially in education and infrastructure investment which will boost Australian economic capacity.</p>
<p>That means this agreement will be crucial in providing ongoing stimulus for economic growth over the medium term, over and above the initial GDP stimulus from the agreement.</p>
<p>Today marks a new beginning in Federal-State relations and heralds a new era of co-operative federalism, with governments from across the political divide working together to strengthen the economy, protect jobs, and deliver better services to the Australian people.</p>
