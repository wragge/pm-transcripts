TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH RANALD MACDONALD, RADIO 3L-0, MELBOURNE,<br />
16 JUNE 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
RM: The Prime Minister of Australia, Paul Keating. Good morning to you<br />
Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Ranald good morning on this your last day.<br />
RM: Yes it is and thank you for fitting me in to your very busy schedule.<br />
I would like to steer clear of the news events of the day if I can and<br />
concentrate on, as you like to refer to it as, the bigger picture.<br />
However, I was struck by the banner headline in The Australian<br />
" Evans to spearhead Sth Pacific assault on Paris". What will our<br />
assault consist of?<br />
PM: I think it will be a representative group of South Pacific nations,<br />
representing the whole of the forum island countries, the forum<br />
countries of the South Pacific, expressing our condemnation at this<br />
decision by the Government of France and to let them know that it is in<br />
their best interests as well as ours, for them not to proceed with this<br />
decision and to leave the Government with no misapprehension about<br />
the strength of feeling in this region of the world.<br />
RM: Is there anything else that you are going to do on top of that? I mean,<br />
obviously trade boycotts have been talked about.<br />
PM: Well I am meant to have a long talk to Senator Evans about it. I have<br />
had a discussion with him, but I think he will consult with our<br />
colleagues in the South Pacific and probably after that consultation we<br />
ourselves will have a conversation and we will discuss what approach<br />
he takes on Australia's part in these discussions.<br />
RM: But how seriously do you take what the French are doing and that is in<br />
our part of the world, eight nuclear tests? </p>
<p>PM: Well again I don't think it is going to do the Government of France or<br />
their interests any good at all. I think that the best way France, the<br />
Government, can protect its people is not by some Gaullist weapon or<br />
similar such approach, but rather engagement with the rest of the<br />
world and to play an active international role because the bomb in<br />
the post-Cold War environment is the 1990s version of the Maginot<br />
line. It didn't work for them between the wars and it won't work now<br />
and I think all it is doing is basically rupturing relations around the<br />
region and continuing to put pressure on the ecology of this region.<br />
RM: I want to talk about your vision for Australia and obviously that<br />
incorporates the Republic, so we will start with the Republic. Is your<br />
decision to embrace the minimalist position recognition of the political<br />
reality. The fact that, if you look through the history, it proved really<br />
difficult to get referenda up and particularly if there is opposition to it?<br />
PM: Well look, not that. That is an issue I think Ranald. The main issue for<br />
me is not to disturb the system of Government we have. I think that<br />
which is broader, or broadest, is best. And in the representative<br />
Parliamentary system we have, you have got 150 people who<br />
represent the nation's aspirations by each constituency, they are in<br />
touch with their electors, their voters, over the course of each<br />
Parliament. You have got the Senate there representing the States at<br />
large because they are elected at large. And, I think, what is healthy<br />
about our Parliamentary democracy is that it is broad and no one<br />
person has elected office across the country. No-one has a mandate<br />
in their own right. You see at the last election, for instance,<br />
on election night though the Government had won the election I was<br />
not elected Prime Minister, I was elected Member for Blaxland. And<br />
the Party then chose me again to be the leader and on that basis I was<br />
appointed by the Governor General to be Prime Minister and I could<br />
be unappointed tomorrow morning for all sorts of reasons, at the whim<br />
of my Caucus, and I think that is the way it should be. People need to<br />
be relevant and maintain their position. So the general cast, the<br />
proposal Ranald, is about preserving that broad representative,<br />
diffuse, basis of Parliamentary democracy in Australia and not have<br />
some single person sitting above it.<br />
RM: Why are you not actually codifying the reserve powers, you are not<br />
detailing them? You are in this, as I understand anyway, effective job<br />
description of the new President saying that you have got to consider<br />
the conventions of the President's power?<br />
PM: Yes and I think that given the fact let's look at the history, we are<br />
five years short of a century, and only once were these powers ever<br />
used controversially. That was in 1975 and even then it was resolved<br />
at an election. So what I am saying is rather than delineate the<br />
powers, or codify them, or reduce them, the function to purely a<br />
ceremonial role, let's leave the powers with the head of state, but </p>
<p>make certain that the head of state's source of power comes from the<br />
representative chambers of the House of Representatives and from<br />
the proportional powers of the Senate. In other words, let that person<br />
whoever he or she may be know that the source of their power is one<br />
given them by the democratic system of Australia, the representative<br />
system, and that therefore the powers they have can only be as<br />
powerful as their source.<br />
RM: But the issue is that you are ensuring that it is really just a ceremonial<br />
position, the President, aren't you because by establishing in the basis<br />
under which the person is put there, the fact that they have to take<br />
consideration of what has taken place in the past, that there are<br />
conventions? You are actually adding to his power, or her power,<br />
aren't you?<br />
PM: The answer is that yes, but at the same time we are keeping those<br />
conventions. I think the conventions matter. But the way in which our<br />
system of Government has evolved, those who say to you let's keep an<br />
interest in our traditions and our history, well this does that. It keeps<br />
that continuity and link with those powers and there is a tension in a<br />
system between the Government and the head of the Government, the<br />
Prime Minister and the head of state. When I say tension, I mean by<br />
that, I think, most of the time all of the time I hope a creative<br />
tension. That is it is not simply a ceremonial post to be ignored. It is<br />
truly somebody representing the whole nation as the head of state.<br />
But in the Government's model they are not by popular election. He or<br />
she will not walk around hearing voices saying " I've been invested by<br />
the country, I am the embodiment of the nation and I will deal with this<br />
Government, Prime Minister, or Parliament as I choose." I mean<br />
I think this would be a very unhealthy approach. Whereas the<br />
approach of the person being elected by the Senate and the House of<br />
Representatives is a far more healthy approach if the powers remain<br />
with the head of state to be used in the event of any national<br />
emergency in the next couple of centuries.<br />
RM: The Constitutional Centenary Foundation, under Sir Ninian Stephen<br />
has put up many areas for discussion. I am just wondering where you<br />
hope the debate will go? It ought to go surely, if we do embrace a<br />
Republic, far beyond the question of President and how the President<br />
is put there?<br />
PM: Well you are probably right about that, Ranald, and maybe it should.<br />
But in the first instance, as I said in my speech, let's make sure the<br />
head of state is one of us. Let's make sure that the complete<br />
independent expression of Australian sovereignty is just that<br />
completely independent by having not the Monarch of another<br />
country as our head of state, but one of our own. I mean I think when<br />
people see the President in the place and know that that person<br />
represents them, that the sense of nation that will come from that, the </p>
<p>sense of us being one and together, represented by one person who is<br />
one of us, will have a profound effect on the country.<br />
RM: Let's just talk about, if we may, because I am discussing things with<br />
the Premier of Victoria a little later in the program, the way in which<br />
you work through the Premiers and also the question of local<br />
Government? In Victoria, we moved from what 210 councils to 78.<br />
Huge restructure of local Government. What is the role you see of the<br />
third tier of Government? Do you think this will change the<br />
relationship?<br />
PM: Oh yes, I think this is a healthy development. I think that we have<br />
picked up the sort of British borough system of local Government,<br />
which has been largely inefficient and you don't get the continuity of<br />
policies and I don't think that residents or ratepayers get the value they<br />
would otherwise get from a system which is, again, more diffuse, more<br />
representative, broader. So I think that is going in the right way and<br />
I think local Government does play a significant role as a tier<br />
Government which affects people's lives in a very close way, that is<br />
the way in which they live, the services they have and that is why we<br />
provide, the Commonwealth provides, grants direct financial<br />
assistance grants to local Government, to complement the only<br />
source of revenue they have which is an inefficient one and that is<br />
municipal rating, property rating.<br />
RM: It is true that Gough Whitlam, your predecessor ( sic), supported the<br />
concept of a healthy local Government. What about<br />
State Governments, obviously a different political complexion,<br />
of course, with different baggage? But there are similarities between<br />
Jeff Kennett and yourself on things, even though you both criticise<br />
each other. Can you do business with them?<br />
PM: Well I do and we have done quite a lot of things together and I think<br />
what you find in this business is you are always looking past the Party<br />
labels and the titles to the people who actually do things somebody<br />
who can go and do something and agree to something and is<br />
interested in doing things. And I have joined with the Premier and his<br />
colleagues in terms of the quite historic decisions of the Council of<br />
Australian Governments in respect of competition policy. We have<br />
now, as you know, got a working party together on health. I think that<br />
is going to be important and I think it is entirely critical that the<br />
Commonwealth and the States are able to work together across these<br />
otherwise distinct boundaries which we have for most of our history.<br />
I think we are getting there now with that and at the last Premiers'<br />
Conference, the Treasurer and I put together with the States, a<br />
financial deal certainly which the States have never had. Certainly not<br />
in the last 20 years or so and I think all of those things mean that you<br />
can do things that are worthwhile and good, but it has got to be by<br />
decisions and I mean this is my beef with Mr Howard, you know<br />
obfuscation and indecision. This is the antithesis of the sort of thing </p>
<p>the country needs at this point in its history. It actually has embraced<br />
change right through the 80s and it wants change and I think it expects<br />
Governments, both Federal and State, to continue those changes.<br />
RM: Well I know you are rushing for a plane, so a very last question and<br />
that is this, I am going away for a year, I am wondering by how much<br />
I will miss the election? Is the election going to be pre-Christmas or<br />
after Christmas?<br />
PM: Well for your sake I would like to tell you for the news value, but I don't<br />
even know myself. So I think the honest answer to that is to say that<br />
I have always taken the view we ought to wring as much out of these<br />
Parliaments as we can. For a start they are too from our point of<br />
view hard to win without giving time away and I think the public<br />
appreciate us getting on with the job and getting things into place and I<br />
made the point just in the last month, we have turned the Budget into<br />
surplus; we have introduced this huge superannuation scheme for the<br />
nation, 15 per cent for everybody putting their savings away and a big<br />
outcome at the end; we have seen, you know, the Republic<br />
announcement; bilateral arrangements with Japan. All of that has<br />
happened in a month and I think these are the things the public want<br />
to see, rather than us getting sort of obsessed about elections and our<br />
own survival.<br />
RM: Alright Prime Minister, many thanks for talking to us.<br />
PM: Well thank you, Ranald, and good luck to you with the change in your<br />
life and I hope it's both rewarding and pleasing for you.<br />
RM: It's very much appreciated, thank you again.<br />
PM: Thank you indeed.<br />
