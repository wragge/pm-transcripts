The Budget's Attack<br />
On Inflation 0<br />
A speech on the 1951 Budget and<br />
the Government's economic policy<br />
by the Prime Minister of Australia,<br />
the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies, C. H.,<br />
in the House of Repre.<br />
senatives on October 3, 1951.<br />
0<br />
ISSUED BY THE<br />
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OF THE LIBERAL<br />
PARTY OF AUSTRALIA. </p>
<p>" Every argument used by the Leader<br />
of the Opposition was an argument<br />
against anti-inflationary measures and<br />
an argument for inflation. The one thing<br />
to which the Leader of the Opposition<br />
and, presumably, his Party, are not<br />
opposed is inflation. They are not<br />
opposed to inflation because the Right<br />
Honourable gentleman himself recognises<br />
inflation as the substance of his<br />
political stock-in-trade.<br />
" The more our people get to know<br />
this Budget and see its effects the more<br />
will they reject the Opposition and the<br />
more will they rally in firm support of<br />
the action taken by the Government."<br />
-The Prime Minister in his speech on<br />
the Budget. </p>
<p>SEconomic Policy<br />
and the Budget<br />
N my speech to-night I want to deal with one or<br />
two special features of the Budget, and then make<br />
some statement on the Government's economic<br />
policy generally, fitting the Budget into the pattern.<br />
But before I do that I should refer to one or two<br />
of the special features.<br />
There has been an onslaught on this Budget in some<br />
quarters on the ground that it increases taxation, as it<br />
undoubtedly does. There are, therefore, two questions<br />
to which I want to address myself on behalf cf the Government.<br />
The first is: Should taxation be increased? If it<br />
should, are the increases fairly distributed?<br />
I will undertake to demonstrate that the answer to<br />
both these questions ought to be: " Yes."<br />
In the first place, those who say that taxation should<br />
not be increased are, in effect, advocating a deficit budget-<br />
that is to say, an inflationary budget. The most<br />
cursory examination of the figures laid before the Committee<br />
by the Treasurer, Sir Arthur Fadden will show<br />
that apart from any increases in taxes there would be,<br />
on this Budget, a deficit of œ 46,000,000. That is a large<br />
deficit. Somebody may say that expenditure could be cut<br />
to eliminate the deficit. To that I reply that anyone<br />
who will trouble himself to look at the items of expenditure<br />
appended to the Budget speech will see at once that<br />
very few of those items lend themselves to a reduction<br />
at all. Nobody would pretend that the Defence vote ought<br />
to be reduced. Some might be heard to say-as they<br />
have, indeed, already-that it ought to be greater. Nobody<br />
would say that the Social Services vote should be </p>
<p>reduced. On the contrary, there have been, and there<br />
will be, those who say that it ought to be even greater.<br />
If Honourable Members looked through all the items of<br />
expenditure they would come to two items, one of them<br />
Public Works, the other General Administrative Expenditure-<br />
which, as an item, is substantially smaller<br />
than the deficit to which I have referred. Members will<br />
not find any item that lends itself to reduction in any<br />
real sense.<br />
What has happened about works? The fact is that<br />
the works programme of the Commonwealth, which we<br />
agreed we would carry entirely on revenue ( for reasons<br />
which I will give in a moment), will this year be only<br />
œ 3,000,000 or œ 4,000,000 greater than last year. This<br />
year it will be of the order of œ 106,000,000. Last year it<br />
was of the order of œ 102,000,000.<br />
In brief, our works programme appears practically<br />
static in terms of money. Therefore, having regard to<br />
increased cost, our works programme has been cut in<br />
volume. This has not applied to any of the complainant<br />
States-and there are some complainant States at present.<br />
It applies to the Commonwealth.<br />
The first question that the critic has to answer<br />
for himself is: Would he be prepared to make a substantial<br />
further cut in the Commonwealth works programme?<br />
Would he be prepared to cut out the Snowy<br />
Mountains hydro-electric project? Would he be prepared<br />
to bring to a stone end any further development<br />
of any description in the postal services? The answer<br />
is perfectly clear. Nobody in this House, and I do not<br />
believe any student out of it, will say there is any further<br />
room for reduction of expenditure on the public<br />
works account.<br />
That leaves, as the one allegedly reduceable item,<br />
general administrative costs, which, after all, amount to<br />
somewhere between œ 30,000,000 and œ 40,000,000, and are<br />
in themselves substantially less than the deficit which<br />
the Treasurer contemplated when he began to compile<br />
this Budget. </p>
<p>I do not need to remind Honourable Members of<br />
probable repercussions because, in an another capacity<br />
in full House, they have heard the discussion about the<br />
Government's attempt-its successful attempt-to introduce<br />
an economy in general administrative costs. I do<br />
not suppose that I will hear anybody opposite say that<br />
there should be a further cut in the general administrative<br />
cost, which we do not control in terms of money<br />
and can control only in terms of manpower.<br />
Deficit Would Be a Scandal<br />
The moment it is established that this Budget<br />
represents the end result of a sincere attempt to<br />
reduce the reduceable expenditures of the Commonwealth<br />
we are confronted by the fact that either<br />
revenue must be increased or a deficit of œ 46,000,000<br />
incurred. A deficit Budget in an inflationary period<br />
like this would be a scandal. It would expose any<br />
Government to the accusation that it did not care<br />
about inflation because it was prepared to pour<br />
œ 50,000,000 of new money into the existing supplies<br />
and so aggravate the inflation.<br />
Therefore, I answer the first question: " Yes." There<br />
must be increased taxation unless we are to have an<br />
inflationary deficit budget. How have we secured the<br />
increased revenue? We have secured it by proposals<br />
which bear justly on all sections. It could hardly be<br />
said by any Honourable Member-and certainly by no<br />
Honourable Member opposite-that in distributing the<br />
additional burden of taxes we have favoured the rich.<br />
The whole trouble is that Honourable Members opposite<br />
felt grievously baulked when they read the Budget because<br />
they realised how heavy a burden would be placed<br />
on the richer sections of the community. They have, for<br />
example, complained very bitterly that at a time of inflation<br />
something ought to be done to impose some<br />
kind of ceiling on dividends of great corporations. I<br />
have heard that suggestion time after time. We cannot<br />
impose a ceiling on dividends under our powers.<br />
But what we have done in this Budget is to raise </p>
<p>substantially the taxation on the distributable profits of<br />
companies with the result that the new rates of taxes<br />
will put a severe check upon the increasing of dividends.<br />
In the second place, the increased revenue has been<br />
obtained by curtailing the demand for capital equipment-<br />
a demand which, as everybody who has studied<br />
this matter knows, is a demand far too great for the<br />
supply. There is no greater element in the present inflation<br />
than the exorbitant demand for capital equipment and<br />
the inadequate supply of it. Therefore, the Treasurer<br />
has made provision for alterations of the existing law in<br />
relation to special initial depreciation. We have reversed<br />
a policy that was originally devised to encourage<br />
investment in capital equipment. That policy must now<br />
be reversed because we have too little capital equipment<br />
to meet the demand.<br />
Some Comparisons on Income Tax Rates<br />
The taxation proposals in the Budget affect the<br />
demand for luxury and less essential goods. That has<br />
been achieved-very justly but not very popularly in<br />
some instances-by sales tax and excise increases and<br />
by the increase of individual income tax. But this increase<br />
still leaves the rate of income tax on all relevant<br />
rates of income in Australia most favourable when compared<br />
with the rates in operation in our sister countries<br />
of the United Kingdom and New Zealand.<br />
The Budget has affected the purchasing demand of<br />
large rural income-earners, not because it is desired<br />
to penalise them but because it is desired to remove an<br />
advantage that has been and is being enjoyed by incomeearners<br />
in that group. That has been achieved by the<br />
partial abolition of averaging. I do not expect to hear<br />
anything from the other side of the Chamber about<br />
this " rich man's Government" pandering to large<br />
income-earners in the country!<br />
Next, this Budget by its taxation proposals has<br />
provided for the modern valuation of land for land tax </p>
<p>purposes. No one can deny the justice of that in a time<br />
of high and rising land prices.<br />
Finally-and there has been some clamour about<br />
this-the Budget provides for a substantial increase in<br />
the fees payable by broadcast listeners. If Honourable<br />
Members will take the trouble to look at the figures of<br />
revenue and expenditure in relation to broadcasting, they<br />
will find that all the increase does is to reduce the loss<br />
on broadcasting, which is now being carried by general<br />
revenue. It does not entirely c-liminate the loss; but<br />
reduces it and prevents a new element of deficit from<br />
coming along, with all its inflationary effect.<br />
. I now invite Honourable Members . to observe the<br />
effect upon the Budget of Capital Works programmes<br />
and of payments to the States. I go further and invite<br />
the attention of some outside critics ( who are diminishing<br />
in number as time goes on) to this matter.<br />
* In normal financial times, Capital Works both<br />
State and Federal-would be carried on Loan. That is<br />
one of the truisms of public finance. To-day, under inflationary<br />
circumstances, there is a movement away from<br />
loans and from fixed interest-bearing securities. That<br />
is inevitably so when prices and costs are rising and<br />
when the value of money is falling. One expects to see<br />
that kind of movement at such a time As the rise in<br />
costs and prices begins to flatten out the movement<br />
away from gilt-edged investment will tend to disappear.<br />
Against the background of that simple truth,<br />
let us face the f act that at this inflationary time in.<br />
Australia's history, with all that ought to be done<br />
in Australia, with our enormous arrears on the<br />
transport side, with our arrears of power, with our<br />
shortages of coal and with our defence preparations,<br />
we cannot expect to finance all of our works<br />
on loan.<br />
Revern~ e For Works Programme<br />
Look at the figures. This year the States have a<br />
Loar programme of œ 22 5m. and the Commonwealth of </p>
<p>fœ 106m.-or a total of œ 33 im. Last year, the loan market<br />
yielded œ 151m. If we got as much from the loan<br />
market this year as last year, we should still, on those<br />
figures, have to find fli~ m. from sources other than<br />
the loan market. Alternatively, not finding the œ 18l1m.,<br />
we should have to cut the whole programme back to<br />
œ 150m. for both the Commonwealth and the States.<br />
That would create chaos in all programmes and instantly<br />
involve damaging and wide-spread repudiation of contracts<br />
and of obligations.<br />
It is clear, therefore, that until inflation is arrested<br />
or is in process of being arrested we must have enough<br />
revenue to find large sums for Works. The eff ect of<br />
all those things has been completely overlooked by the<br />
critics. Out of a total of œ 927m. expenditure in the<br />
Budget, payments to the States are at the record figure<br />
of œ 161m. What I shall call our underwriting liability<br />
to the States in respect of their Wvorks programmes<br />
( which is the difference between what the loan market<br />
will yield and the œ 225m. expenditure that has been<br />
approved) may be anything between œ 75m. and lO0m.<br />
Neither the Treasurer nor myself knows what it will be<br />
exactly In addition, because we have remained out of<br />
the loan market and left that market with its limited<br />
resources to the Stites, we have to carry œ lO00m. of<br />
~ Commonwealth works on the Budget.<br />
Let nobody pretend he is grap~ ling with this<br />
problem unless he decides whether we should have<br />
cut payments to the States. Does he challenge<br />
paying 0161m. to the States? Does he challenge us<br />
standing behind the States in this underwriting<br />
senses" Does he challenge us doing œ lO0m. worth<br />
of Commonwealth Works this year?<br />
Unless he challenges one or other or all of those<br />
things, the result is that from œ 336m. to œ 361m. or<br />
more than one-third of the entire Budget-is made up<br />
of items of that kind. When people say in a rather<br />
broad, easy and sweeping fashion that we must not<br />
increase taxation but must cut something, let them face<br />
up to the real truth of the matter If we cut those three </p>
<p>things out, turn our backs upon our partners in the<br />
Federation, and if we adhere to the whole of our revenue<br />
and make no tax or other reimbursements to the States,<br />
we can have a high, wide and handsome surplus without<br />
raising an extra penny piece by way of taxes.<br />
But all of those items are entirely significant and<br />
are not to be avoided merely by the process of not<br />
looking at them.<br />
Government's Anti-inflation Programme<br />
I turn from those two matters to say something<br />
about the anti-inflation programme of the Government,<br />
because one of the things that is most glibly repeated is<br />
that the Government has no programme about inflation.<br />
it is said particularly-not in this House, I agree,<br />
but outside-by those to whom an anti-inflation programmif<br />
means altering the exchange rate and nothing<br />
else. The people who advocate such an alteration of the<br />
exchange rate never have anything to puit along side it,<br />
in my experience. The Government's programme is<br />
designed to deal with the real causes of infl. ation as far,<br />
of course, as they are internal to Australia. External<br />
causes are not matters that are within our jurisdiction,<br />
but as far as they are internal to Australia this is what<br />
the Government is seeking to do: to deal with real<br />
causes. Therefore, we have directed our programme,<br />
and have been directing it for a long time. to five elements.<br />
I do not wish to be tedious on this matter, but<br />
I take leave to state those five elements to the committee<br />
and to the country. The first is to increase<br />
production; the second, to increase procurement of<br />
goods from overseas; the third, the limitation of excessive<br />
capital demand by governments; the fourth,<br />
the limitation of excessive ccnsumer demand for<br />
non-essentials, a demand which attracts too many<br />
resources to non-essential production; and the fifth,<br />
the diversion of resources of manpower and<br />
materials to enterprises of productive and defence </p>
<p>importance. I shall take those five matters in their<br />
order. First, positive measures to increase production. It<br />
was very gratifying to my colleagues and to those who<br />
sit behind us in this chamber to hear the Leader of the<br />
Opposition ( Dr. Evatt) last night at the penitance stool<br />
about production. His conversion to advocacy of production<br />
is tardy but welcome. After all, it is never too<br />
late to mend on such matters. But although it is tardy<br />
and although we hope that from now on we shall have<br />
his support in encouraging people to understand that you<br />
produce your way out of inflation far more than by<br />
any other technique, I desire in passing to recall that<br />
the communists are production's greatest enemies in<br />
this country and that so far the Leader of the Opposition<br />
has done nothing but protect them.<br />
Positive Methods to Increase Production<br />
With that slight recollection, I now wVish to turn<br />
to the positive measures to increase pi-oduction. The<br />
first of them was the 100,000,000 dollar loan We were<br />
told at one stage that it was impossible or undesirable.<br />
The object of the loan which tbis Government negotiated<br />
was to bring, here essential capital equipment<br />
which could not be obtained frcm non-dollar sources.<br />
The Australian Government is not, for the most part,<br />
the buyer of the commodities that arc imported. State<br />
Governments and public instrumentalities are, for the<br />
most part, the authorities to whom the dollars are made<br />
available under this loan. Honourable Members will<br />
be interested to know that under that loan we have made<br />
available in dollars for agricultural practice and other<br />
agricultural equipment 29 million dollars; for heavy industrial<br />
crawler tractors and earth-moving equipment,<br />
24 million dollars; for transport equipment. including<br />
locomotives, 15 million dollars; for electricity generation<br />
and transmission, 26 million dollars; and the balance is<br />
made up of plant andi equipment for mining and manufacturing.<br />
This is a pretty good list of articles, every </p>
<p>one of which has to do with production and vital transportation<br />
in Australia.<br />
As the second element of a positive production programme<br />
I wish to refer to immigration, because there<br />
is applause of our immigration policy as well as criticism<br />
of it. Of course, there is always room for criticism of<br />
any policy so great in its scope, but we have specifically<br />
directed the immigration policy towards aiding the basic<br />
industries. Honourable Members will be interested to<br />
know that 19,000 contract immigrants are now working<br />
in national undertakings such as rail, road, water storage<br />
and power projects, while 2,600 contract migrants<br />
have been placed in the steel industry. Accommodation<br />
for Commonwealth-sponsored immigrants has been<br />
located to meet the labour needs of basic industries and<br />
of basic services. For example, prefabricated houses<br />
from overseas are being erected on the South Coast of<br />
New South Wales for British immigrant miners who<br />
will produce coking coal for the Port Kembla Steel<br />
Works. Flow of Imported Scarce Materials<br />
The third element in this positive policy of production<br />
is that this Government has encouraged the flow of<br />
imported scarce materials because a great deal of production<br />
in any country depends upon how it can obtain<br />
the product of another country's enterprise to use as its<br />
own material for its own production. We have encouraged<br />
the flow of imported scarce materials by relaxing<br />
import duties on essential materials, and on prefabricated<br />
houses, by subsidising the importation of coal and<br />
of houses, and by negotiating favourable allocations of<br />
scarce materials and equipment. I do not wish to weary<br />
the committee with a mass of figures, but I shall quote<br />
three items in order to indicate how fruitful and constructive<br />
this policy has been. For instance, let us take<br />
iron and steel.<br />
This country imported 160,000 tons of iron and steel<br />
in 1948-49, 425,000 tons in 1949-50, and 685,000 tons in<br />
1950-51. That is constructive talk, because steel has </p>
<p>been one of the great basic shortages in Australia. Now<br />
let us take timber. In 1948-49 Australia imparted<br />
222,000,000 super feet; in 1949-50, 240,000,000 super feet;<br />
and in 1950-51, 375,000-000 super feet.<br />
In the case of mach inery, taking it in is. the<br />
figure has risen over the same period from œ E41,000,000<br />
to œ 86,000,000. I refer to these matters because they are conclusive<br />
evidence that under the policy which we<br />
have consistently applied we have been able to produce<br />
first-class results in adding to the instruments<br />
of production in this country. Only the instruments<br />
of production, mechanical and human, will in the<br />
long run answer this problem for us.<br />
Now I take the next item in our production programme,<br />
which is coal and steel production. We have<br />
subsidised the importation of coal in hundreds of thousands<br />
of tons. Orders for a further 1,000,000 tons of<br />
coal have been placed abroad, but there is difficulty in<br />
securing shipping at reasonable rates. Therefore, the<br />
Government is at this very moment taking steps, some<br />
of which are complete, to secure needed shipping by<br />
both charter and purchase for the bringing of this coal<br />
to Australia. We have subsidised coal production at<br />
Callide. I do not mean that we havc made a direct<br />
subsidy to the Queensland Government, but we have<br />
entered into an obligation to sub~ idise the two principal<br />
purchasers of Callide coal-the States of Victoria and<br />
South Australia. We have under way, and are vigorously<br />
pursuing with all the resources we have, a large opencut<br />
development which, when completed in a few years,<br />
will have added about 5,000,000 tons of coal a year to<br />
our supply in Australia.<br />
Coal Production Has Increased<br />
Coal production actually increased by more than<br />
1,000,000 tons in the financial year that has just ended.<br />
It ought to increase by another 1,000,000 tons in the<br />
financial year that has now begun. Ingot steel production<br />
in Australia in 1950-51 was 1,400,000 tons, which </p>
<p>was 200,000 tons more than in the previous financial<br />
year. I am not going to labour these figures, but in<br />
all of these things there is proof that to the extent that<br />
production is the answer to inflation we have fruitfully<br />
concentrated our efforts on stimulating it.<br />
Apart from basic materials, which might be<br />
described by economists as capital goods, we have deliberately<br />
as a counter-inflationary measure encouraged<br />
the increased procurement of goods. The Government<br />
is of the opinion that Australian industries, at a time of<br />
the greatest under-supply, are in no danger of fatal competition<br />
from goods imported from overseas. We must,<br />
if we are going to meet inflation, have a large flow of<br />
goods coming into this country. In 1949 the imports of<br />
merchandise f. o. b. amiounted to œ 414,000.000; in 1949-50<br />
to E536,000,000; and in 1950-5 1 to œ 742,000,000. On the<br />
present rate of flow of imports of merchandise into Autstralia<br />
the figure this financial year may actually exceed<br />
œ. 900,000,000. That is all I want to say of that particular aspect<br />
of this problem. Anti-inflation programme Item No. 1<br />
is to stimulate production. Item No. 2 is to stimulate<br />
increased supply of goods. I have dealt with both of<br />
these, and I venture to say we have shown, very practical<br />
results. The third item in an anti-inflationary<br />
programme is the limitation of excessive capital demands<br />
by governments, and that sentence raises the whole<br />
issue so violently discussed by the Premier of Victoria.<br />
in recent weeks.<br />
Facts About Public Works Expenditure<br />
First of all, I shall give some figures in relation to<br />
public works' expenditure in the last complete financial<br />
year before the war. In 1938-39 the public works of the<br />
whole of Australia, including public housing construction,<br />
amounted to œ 57,000,000. In 1950-51 that figure<br />
has risen to 312,000,000. Honourable Members will see<br />
that when you multiply the demand for capital investment<br />
c~ n works by between five and six times in that<br />
period of time and you have a population not so enor-</p>
<p>mously greater, then the strain put on the economy is<br />
tremendous. If we add to that a rise in private capital<br />
investment over the same period from œ 109,000,000 to<br />
œ 405,000,000, then we see the consequences and none of<br />
us need to ignore them.<br />
The consequences are an excessive demand for<br />
labour, plant and materials, bottle-necks and high competition<br />
for available resources. All of these things are<br />
acutely inflationary in their effect. We, in short, believe<br />
that Australian Governments-and I use the pluralare<br />
trying to do too many jobs at the same time. The<br />
result is delays, high costs and acute inflationary pressure.<br />
At the last meeting of the Loan Council, my colleague<br />
the Treasurer and I dealt with this problem. The<br />
States had brought in a works programme. They had,<br />
so they informed us, vetted this programme with great<br />
care. But the programme amounted to over œ 300,000,000<br />
and the whole of the loan market in the financial year<br />
just ended produced only one-half of that amount. In<br />
other words, the States presented a loan programme<br />
double the established capacity of the loan market at<br />
that time. They had already agreed at a former special<br />
Loan Council meeting that works ought not to be<br />
financed out of Treasury bills-that is to say, that you<br />
ought not to create new money out of the central bank<br />
in a time of inflation to carry out public works. We also<br />
agreed to that principle. There is no economist in the<br />
country who would deny the correctness of the principle.<br />
The States accepted that proposition. They said in<br />
effect: " All right then, we must not have recourse to<br />
the Central Bank to create new money to add to the<br />
flow of purchasing power at a time like this." We all<br />
agreed at the same time that the loan market would not<br />
yield anything like œ 300,000,000. The Commonwealth<br />
said-and I still say that it was the proper thing for<br />
us to say-that in order to ease the reduction that was<br />
obviously coming in the States' works' programmes we<br />
would finance our own works out of revenue and we<br />
would leave the loan market to the* States. It is very </p>
<p>curious to remember, in the light of these facts that<br />
I am reciting, that the Premier of Victoria ( whether<br />
speaking his own mind or somebody else's I do not<br />
know) is now denouncing us for injustice and harshness<br />
towards Victoria. All I can say is that we agreed to<br />
finance the whole of the Commonwealth works' programme<br />
from revenue and that the States could have<br />
the whole of the loan market to themselves for whatever<br />
It might produce.<br />
What the Loan Council Decided<br />
Faced with those facts, the Loan Council, by a<br />
majority of four States to two, approved of the reduction<br />
of the States' programmes to œ 225,000,000-a reduction<br />
in their programmes of œ 75,000,000, a reduction of<br />
an unprecedented order. That was agreed to by a<br />
majority of the States, one of the majority beitig the<br />
State of Victoria. So the programme was fut to<br />
œ 225,000,000, an amount which nobody believed the market<br />
would yield.<br />
Nobody believes it now. No one can see any reason<br />
why, in the present economic circumstances, we should<br />
expect to get from the market œ 225,000,000 instead of<br />
the œ 150,000,000 we got last year<br />
To prevent confusion and chaos, the Commonwealth<br />
agreed to guarantee the amount of<br />
œ 225,000,000. To those who study the history of<br />
Commonwealth and State financial relations that<br />
decision represents an important landmark. This is<br />
the first time that the Commonwealth has, in effect,<br />
guaranteed the loan works programme of the States.<br />
The guarantee means that, to the extent that loan<br />
raisings fall short whether by œ 75,000,000 or<br />
œ 100,000,000 the Commonwealth will find the<br />
money and, let me add, will find it by non-inflationary<br />
means. It will find the money, not by discounting Treasury<br />
bills with the Commonwealth Bank, but by subtracting<br />
money which would otherwise be available for spending </p>
<p>-that is, by taxation. No one was more eloquent in<br />
expressing his appreciation of what was being done<br />
than was the Premier of Victoria.<br />
I do not quite know on what flank we are being<br />
attacked. One section of the press declares that we<br />
should have clamped down still harder, that we should<br />
have said: " Not a bean do you get beyond what the<br />
loan market provides." If that had been done the Premnier<br />
of Victoria would not have been standing alone.<br />
There would have been a chorus of protests from one<br />
end of Australia to the other, and public works programmes<br />
would have folded up all over the place. We<br />
did the reasonable thing. We said, in effect, that we<br />
would not underwrite what we regarded as extragavant<br />
programmes that were beyond practical realisation. On<br />
the other hand, we would not cut the States down suddenly<br />
to what the market would yield. In order to give<br />
an illustration of how fantastic some of the statements<br />
on this matter have been, I point out that in Victoria<br />
the Government is trying to spend on public works in<br />
one year an amount equal to half the figure at which the<br />
public debt of that State stood in 1954, ninety-four years<br />
after the inauguration of the State. Honourable members<br />
can see how reckless has been the approach of some<br />
people to this question.<br />
Meeting With the States Next Year<br />
Having explained the nature of our underwriting<br />
obligation, I now say -and I wish this to be<br />
noted in certain quarters -that it is not to be<br />
assumed that the Commonwealth will necessarily<br />
repeat its underwriting. We propose to call the<br />
States together in the New Year to discuss their<br />
works' programmes. We are not prepared to encourage<br />
States to enter into capital commitments<br />
indefinitely-as some might like to do-in excess<br />
of the amount of money which the public will entrust<br />
to them by loan. We are not prepared to<br />
accept as a practice the burden and qbloquy of imposing<br />
extra taxation in order to provide funds for </p>
<p>State works' programmes in excess of the savings of<br />
the people. It is in the light of these warnings<br />
that we propose to meet the representatives of the<br />
States early next year and to say to them that the<br />
kind of thing which was inevitable this year should<br />
be avoided in the future.<br />
The next point is the limitation of excessive consumer<br />
demand for non-essentials--a demand which attracts<br />
too many resources to non-essential production.<br />
To this end the Government has taken certain steps<br />
which I could not have believed would be seriously challenged<br />
by Honourable Members opposite, because in<br />
their own day everyone of them has enjoyed at least the<br />
vocal support of those Honourable Members. The steps<br />
actually taken to date are-<br />
1.-Limitation of inflationary demand by special<br />
account procedures under the Banking Act.<br />
2.-General tightening of bank advances policy<br />
to produce selectivity in credit policy.<br />
3.-Reintroduction of capital issues control to<br />
give priority in the capital market to those concerns<br />
which deal with basic production, development and<br />
deence. The tightening up effect of these measures has been<br />
very considerable. Many honourable members are well<br />
aware of this, and of the influence which the measures<br />
have had in discounting demand. Because the procedures<br />
are selective, they reduce demand-or we expect<br />
that they will reduce demand-in the right places. There<br />
may be some errors of judgment here or there, but we<br />
expect the effect to be such as I have stated.<br />
National Security Resources Board<br />
The last item is the diversion of resources of manpower<br />
and materials to enterprises of productive and<br />
defence importance. Apart from what I have said on<br />
government and private capital investment programmes,<br />
we have created three principal instruments. The first<br />
is a National Security Resources Board, about which </p>
<p>I should like to say a few words. It is a widely representative<br />
body which includes leaders of heavy industry,<br />
as well as the President of the Australian Council of<br />
Trade Unions. It also includes civil servants, some of<br />
them with administrative training, and others with economic<br />
training. The Board has done a great deal of<br />
work, and has submitted valuable reports and recomnrnendations<br />
to the Government. It has ex~ am~ ined the<br />
wvhole subject of capital issues control, and has tendered<br />
certain advice. It has also reported on the migration<br />
programme and, as the Minister for Immiaration ( Mr.<br />
Holt) will agree, a most valuable analysis was made<br />
in conjunction with another committee which has been<br />
dealing with the problem. The Board has also reported<br />
on the creation of Commonwealth-State consultative<br />
machinery, on the rendering of assistance to basic industries<br />
such as coal and steel on the Defence Forces'<br />
equipment programme, and on the marshalling of our<br />
resources for defence preparations generally. On all<br />
these matters the Government has been put into possession<br />
of most useful views.<br />
Do not let us be schoolboys in considering this<br />
matter. I suggest that the Honouirable Member for East<br />
Sydney ( Mr. Ward) in particular should not be too<br />
hasty in alleging that the Government is endeavouring<br />
to introduce industrial conscription. Industrial conscription<br />
was not provided for in the Defence Preparations<br />
Act, and this Government is not talking about introducing<br />
industrial conscription. It is talking about diverting<br />
resources from the non-essential industries to the<br />
essential industries. if Honourable Members are not<br />
in favour of the plan, let them tell the people that they<br />
are in favour of inflation going on and on indefinitely.<br />
I have already referred to the second instrumentthe<br />
Defence Preparations Act. The third instrument is<br />
the Commonwealth-States joint Consultative Committees<br />
which are meeting by concurrence of the seven<br />
Governments of Australia. There is a committee on<br />
power, a committee on transport, a committee on<br />
materials, and a committee on agriculture already func-</p>
<p>tioning It is anticipated that they will make reports<br />
containing lists of priorities which will go far to enable<br />
resources to be properly directed and concentrated, If<br />
basic materials can be concentrated for basic jobs, people<br />
will work with those materials on those jobs instead of<br />
wasting them in jobs that do not matter. That is the<br />
whole principle of a diversionary process.<br />
Some Facts About the Surplus<br />
I shall now turn to one or two special arguments<br />
that have been used in this debate. It has been stated<br />
that the surplus of œ 114m. disclosed in this Budget is<br />
not a true surplus because it will be spent on State<br />
Works. Again, one hardly knows from what angle to<br />
anticipate the attack. One gathers from the Right<br />
Honourable gentleman who addressed this House last<br />
night that he thought the surplus would be much bigger<br />
-more than the figure stated-but the critic to whom<br />
I now refer has said that there will not be a surplus. The<br />
argument has been put forward not by people who<br />
believe in having a deficit, but by people who think they<br />
believe there ought to be a surplus in the Budget at a<br />
time like this for sound economic reasons.<br />
I have shown that reductions of controllable expenditure<br />
have gone as far as they can under the present<br />
circumstances. Therefore, the surplus could be made a<br />
nett surplus of œ 114m. with no charge against it for State<br />
works only by one of two means. The Government could<br />
pay no Works money to the States beyond what the<br />
market will provide. Or it could increase taxes still<br />
further to make the surplus not œ 114m. but œ 214m., so<br />
that it might then pay œ 100m. to the States and have a<br />
nett surplus of œ 114m.<br />
Taking the second idea first-a further increase in<br />
taxation-the Government did not believe that it could<br />
reasonably ask the people to accept such a burden. As<br />
to the first idea of reducing the amount to be paid to<br />
the States and repudiating our obligations to them under<br />
the Loan Council Agreement, the Government will not </p>
<p>repudiate its arrangements. Nor does it believe that it<br />
could reasonably ask the States to accept such a burden<br />
so suddenly in this financial year.<br />
Having regard to the amount of their commitments<br />
for firm orders for plant which has been<br />
ordered overseas, there is no doubt that to reduce<br />
the State programmes at once to œ 125m. or œ 150m.<br />
would have wrecked their plans and practically<br />
brought their Works' programmes in terms of labour<br />
to a standstill.<br />
Budget Is " Realistic and Moderate"<br />
In this respect, as in every other respect, this Budget<br />
is both realistic and moderate. It has been said by the<br />
Leader of the Opposition, who is much more apt to produce<br />
a phrase than an idea, that this Budget is a sort<br />
of " blue print for depression." That statement is dangerous<br />
nonsense. The Opposition really ought to make up<br />
its mind, if it has a mind to make up, on any problem<br />
that involves the economic state of the country. Its<br />
modern opposition to the Premiers' Plan I have noticed<br />
with great interest. I have thought it courteous to forget<br />
that there would have been no Premiers' Plan without<br />
the consent of a majority of Labour Premiers and a<br />
Labour Prime Minister. It is now the modern idiom of<br />
the Honourable Gentlemen opposite to say that the<br />
Premiers' Plan was wrong and that in a depression the<br />
Government ought to budget for a deficit, that it ought<br />
to use Central Bank Credit for works, that it ought to<br />
extend its works programme to the limit of practicability.<br />
There is great force in that view, but one cannot have<br />
two inconsistent views at one and the same time. If<br />
the Honourable Gentlemen opposite believe that in a<br />
depression the Government should budget for a deficit<br />
and use Central Bank Credit-that is to say, create new<br />
money and expand the Public Works programmes to the<br />
limit of its physical capacity-then will they tell the<br />
people that they regard the same medicine as appropriate<br />
for an inflationary boom? </p>
<p>Let us compare the circumstances of 1930 and<br />
1951 while the Honourable Gentlemen opposite are<br />
chewing over their ultimate answer to that grim<br />
question, in order that once and for all it may be quite<br />
plain that this talk about a " blueprint for depression"<br />
is wicked and dangerous nonsense.<br />
There was large unemployment in this country in<br />
1930, while to-day there are far more jobs than men.<br />
In terms of employment, the positions are at the poles.<br />
In 1930 Australia had international reserves ( London'<br />
funds in particular) of œ 58m. It now has international<br />
reserves of œ 843m.<br />
Our export income in 1930 ( 1 am leaving out gold<br />
because it is not material for the purposes of this comparison)<br />
was f90.5m. In 1951 -) ur export income was<br />
œ 983.9m. In 1930 the sum total of the personal income of Australians<br />
was œ 557m. In 1951 it was œ 2,916m.<br />
The money in the hands of the public ( I speak of<br />
Notes and Bank deposits) in 1930 was œ 567rn. In 1951<br />
it was œ 2,447m.<br />
Mischievous Nonsense A bout " Depression"<br />
I have only to refer to those figures, and I invite<br />
every Honourable Member to look at them when<br />
they are recorded in Hansard, to show that the only<br />
people who have talked mischievous nonsense about<br />
a depression in 1951 are those who want to see one<br />
come about.<br />
The last matter I want to say something about-<br />
I have saved the best for the last-is the speech that fell<br />
from the Leader of the Opposition last night. I think it<br />
was Lord Randolph Churchill who once said that it was<br />
the first duty of the Opposition to oppose, and as a<br />
former Opposition Leader myself I am not unfamiliar<br />
with that duty and its performance. But I am bound to<br />
say that the present Leader of the Opposition must be<br />
regarded as the greatest " opposer" of all time. Let me<br />
prove that statement before I sit down. </p>
<p>In the first place, I gather-though I may be wrong<br />
-that he was opposed to Sir Douglas Copland. That<br />
may be doing the Fight Honourable Gentleman an injustice.<br />
Anyhow, I may say with perfect courtesy that<br />
the Leader of the Opposition, in relation to his debate<br />
on this matter, shunned the company of Sir Douglas<br />
Copland, who is a very distinguished Australian and a<br />
distinguished man from many points of view. He was,<br />
in point of fact, Prices' Commissioner under my own<br />
Government in 1939. He was, may I recall to Honourable<br />
Members opposite, Economic Adviser as well as<br />
Prices' Commissioner to the late Mr. Curtin and the late<br />
Mr. Chifley, and I venture to say that he enjoyed the<br />
confidence of both of them.<br />
Dr. Evatt's " Fascinating Logic"<br />
The Leader of the Opposition, with the fascinating<br />
logic that has puzzled me for many years, says in what<br />
logicians would call a curious syllogism: " I do not like<br />
Professor Copland. Professor Copland supports this<br />
Budget. Professor Copland, because I do not like him,<br />
must be wrong. Therefore the Budget is wrong." That<br />
is a pretty fair summary of half of the rambling and<br />
meandering obscurities we have listened to from the<br />
Right Honourable Gentleman.<br />
In the second place the Leader of the Opposition is<br />
opposed to a reduction of Commonwealth administrative<br />
expenditure. He has made that abundantly clear. In<br />
other words, he agrees that we cannot balance the Budget<br />
by reducing expenditure. I do not do him an injustice<br />
when I say that I thought that that was clearly what<br />
he meant to convey. Indeed, on the contrary, he thought<br />
that administrative expenditure should be increased-because,<br />
he said, there should be bigger subsidies, bigger<br />
social services,. and more civil servants. On those three<br />
items he is all for an expansion of expenditure under the<br />
Budget. But although he is opposed to any reduction of<br />
expenditure ( and in favour of an increase), he is also<br />
opposed to any incr.! ase of taxation. Indeed, he thinks<br />
that taxes should be reduced. So he cannot balance the </p>
<p>Budget by reducing expenditure and he is unwilling to<br />
balance it by increasing revenue. How then does he propose<br />
to balance the Budget? It is elementary when one<br />
looks at these figures that the Right Honourable Gentleman<br />
favours a budget deficit. And the only way we can<br />
finance a budget deficit to-day is by raising the wind,<br />
through the Central Bank, by the issue of Treasury Bills.<br />
He favours increasing the supply of money as a cure for<br />
inflaticn! In the next place he opposes the reduction of the<br />
State Works programmes-unless, of course, he is quarrelling<br />
with Mr. McGirr and Mr. Cain. If he is to be at<br />
all logical in his approach to this matter, he favours the<br />
financing of a deficit by the Commonwealth Bank by<br />
means of Treasury Bills. This gentleman who talks<br />
about inflation makes it abundantly clear that, in respect<br />
of revenue and loan deficits, he is all for going to the<br />
Commonwealth Bank and raising the wind by the issue<br />
of Treasury Bills.<br />
Finally, I gather that the Leader of the Opposition<br />
is opposed to the recent rise in the bond interest rate. I<br />
trust that I am not distorting what he has said on that<br />
subject. I take his silence to signify his consent to the<br />
accuracy of my statement. I gather his reference to the<br />
recent rise in the bond interest rate to mean that he<br />
expects either to use Central Bank Credits on a grand<br />
scale to support the bond market and force down the<br />
interest rate, or that he would like the loan to fail, because<br />
if it failed we could then put the whole responsibility<br />
on to the Central Bank with the greatest of ease.<br />
Every argument used by the Leader of the<br />
Opposition was an argument against anti-inflationary<br />
measures and an argument for inflation. The<br />
one thing to which the Leader of the Opposition<br />
and, presumably, his Party, are not opposed is inflation.<br />
They are not opposed to inflation because<br />
the Right Honourable gentleman himself recognises<br />
inflation as the substance of his political stock-intrade. </p>
<p>The more our people get to know this Budget and<br />
see its effects, the more will they reject the Opposition<br />
and the more will they rally in firm support of the action<br />
taken by the Government.<br />
