STATEMENT BY TIlE PRIME MINISTER, THE 1ION P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
DEATH OF PRESIDENT PREMADASA OF SRI LANKA<br />
I have today sent the following message to Mr Dingiri Banda Wijetunga, Acting<br />
President of Sri Lanka:<br />
I would like to extend to you and the people of Sri Lanka my deepest personal<br />
condolences, and those of the Australian Government and people, on the tragic<br />
death of President Premadasa. Mr Premadasa's enduring contribution to the<br />
development of Sri Lanka will long be remembered.<br />
Please also pass on our condolences to Mrs Premadasa and her children, and to the<br />
families of others killed and injured.<br />
Australians join with the majority of the Sri Lankan people in deploring the use of<br />
violence as a means of political expression. We hope that you, Mr Acting<br />
President, with the Government and people of Sri Lanka, will be able to continue<br />
the search for a peaceful resolution of Sri Lanka's communal problems.<br />
CANBERRA,<br />
May 2, 1993 </p>
