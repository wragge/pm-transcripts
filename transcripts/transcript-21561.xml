    <content><![CDATA[<p>As we come to celebrate Christmas, I know that all Australians will reflect on what a great privilege it is to be an Australian and on the enormous opportunities this country has brought to all of its citizens.</p>
<p>  We end the year and come together at Christmas in an optimistic frame of mind as a nation and as a people.  We are a prosperous and successful society - there are more Australians in work than ever before, our living standards are high and we are warmly regarded around the world.</p>
<p>  But that should not blind us to underprivilege and unhappiness within our own communities.  It's very important that those of us who do enjoy a good life in this country help those of our fellow citizens who are less fortunate wherever we can.</p>
<p>  While most of us enjoy Christmas, for some it can sadly be a time of stress and loneliness.  And in this regard, I particularly pay tribute to the work of those wonderful welfare organisations in our midst that do so much to help the less fortunate in our community.</p>
<p>Members of the Australian Defence Force and Australian Federal Police are making an important contribution to the international fight against terrorism and serving our nation proudly in Iraq, the Solomon Islands and a number of other overseas locations.</p>
<p>Each of them has brought credit to our country and I encourage all Australians to spare a thought for those serving personnel and their families who will spend this Christmas apart. The tragic death of police officer Adam Dunning two days ago is a stark reminder of the risks these brave Australians face each day.</p>
<p>  As we look around the world, it is easy sometimes to become pessimistic.  But on the more optimistic side, we are also making progress in the war against poverty and in the fight against some of mankind's dreadful diseases.</p>
<p>Christmas is a time for catching up with old friends and, of course, spending even more time with our families.  It is also an opportunity to reflect upon the deeper significance and spirituality of this time of the year.</p>
<p>Janette joins me in wishing all Australians a Merry Christmas and a bright and prosperous 2005.  </p>
