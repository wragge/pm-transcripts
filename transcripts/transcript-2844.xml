RATIFICATION OF ILO CONVENTIONS<br />
( This corrects our statement of yesterday,<br />
which inadvertently referred in the second<br />
paragraph to the Conventions, " numbers 87<br />
and 108". The correct numbers are 87 and<br />
98.)<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
Mr Whitlam, said today he was pleased to announce that Australia<br />
had deposited instruments of ratification of two Conventions of<br />
the International Labour Organisation with the Director-General<br />
of the ITO in Geneva.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the two Conventions, numbers 87<br />
and 98, dealt with the rights of workers and employers to join<br />
organisations of their choice, provided against Government<br />
interference, guaranteed rights to protection against discrimination<br />
within unions and oromoted collective bargaining.<br />
" These are two of the important ILO Conventions dealing<br />
with fundamental human rights, and have been widely ratified by<br />
the 123 member States of the ITO," Mr Whitlam said. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
" The Australian Government's ratification of these<br />
Conventions is a significant step towards the goal of ratifying<br />
all IIO Conventions in the field of human rights, in celebration<br />
of the 25th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human<br />
Rights on 10 December this year." 0 </p>
