FOR PRESS PM. No. 62/ 1969<br />
YOUTH ORCHESTRA FOR EXPO<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr ohn Gorton<br />
The Government has decided to send the Australian<br />
Youth Orchestra to Japan to take part in<br />
The Orchestra will represent Australia in EXPO's<br />
' World of Youth" Festival in Osaka next July, during which it will<br />
give a week of daily performances.<br />
The National Music Camp Association established the<br />
Australian Youth Orchestra in 1967. It comprises 92 of Australia's<br />
most talented young instrumentalists, ranging in age from fourteen<br />
to twenty-two. Most come from the various conservatoriums and<br />
schools of music. EXPO ' 70 authorities in Japan have shown a keen<br />
interest in a visit by the Youth Orchestra, and I am sure the<br />
performances by these gifted young people will win many friends for<br />
Australia. CANBERRA, July 1969 </p>
