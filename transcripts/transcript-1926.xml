COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH By<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
F Ill AIRCRAFT<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From ihe ' Parliamentary Debates', 26 September 19681<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-Mr Speaker, I lay on the table certain<br />
documents pertaining to the purchase of<br />
* Fl111 aircraft and -ask leave of the House<br />
to make a statement concerning the samne.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-There being no objection,<br />
leave is granted.<br />
Mr GORTON-Mr Speaker, I have told<br />
the House that the Government wishes to<br />
provide Parliament with as much information<br />
as possible concerning the arrangements<br />
made for the purchase of Fill aircraft. I<br />
have made it clear that we will not disclose<br />
any document or part of any document<br />
which has a security content, and I have<br />
stated that we will not disclose any docu-<br />
Snt which, being confidential between<br />
* aGovernment of Australia and the<br />
Government of the United States of<br />
America, cannot be disclosed without agreement<br />
between us; at least, cannot he dis-<br />
* closed without agreement between us without<br />
adversely affecting the relations between<br />
our two governments.<br />
These limitations stand, and will stand.<br />
We have had an examination made of<br />
the documents and we have had consultations<br />
with representatives of the United<br />
States Government who have come from thle<br />
United States to discuss with us the disclosure<br />
of the documents relating to the<br />
whole of this transaction. As a result, as<br />
I have said, I lay on the table certain documents<br />
which I believe satisfy the proper<br />
requirements of a House of Parliament to<br />
23 105/ 68 be informed as to the spending of public<br />
money. These documents include a Memorandum<br />
of Understanding dated 19th October<br />
1963 and signed by the then United<br />
States Secretary of Defence and the then<br />
Australian Minister for Defence. These<br />
documents are laid here except that Annex 1<br />
has been excluded from the documents on<br />
security grounds. On examination of the<br />
documents it will be clear which Annex has<br />
been excluded on these grounds.<br />
The second document is a letter of 23rd<br />
October 1963 from the then Minister for<br />
Defence to the then United States Secretary<br />
of Defence accepting the proposal contained<br />
in the Memorandum of Understanding.<br />
The third document is a letter of 2nd<br />
November 1963 from the then United<br />
States Secretary of Defence to the then<br />
Minister for Defence of Australia confirming<br />
these arrangements.<br />
The fourth document is a letter from the<br />
then Minister for Defence of Australia to<br />
the then United States Secretary of Defence<br />
giving reasons for deciding not to pursue<br />
the proposal to use B47 aircraft as interim<br />
aircraft. The fifth document is the agreed technical<br />
arrangements between the United<br />
States and Australia for the purchase of the<br />
aircraft concerned.<br />
These technical arrangements provide:<br />
for fabrication of our aircraft and equipment<br />
to the same documentation and quality<br />
standard~ s as those required for the United </p>
<p>States aircraft; for the established United<br />
States Department of Defence contracting<br />
procedures to be used in relation to the purchase<br />
of our own aircraft; for production<br />
or work on our aircraft to be incorporated<br />
in or placed on the same terms as contracts<br />
let for the United States Government;<br />
for inspection of all supplies for our<br />
aircraft to be done to the same extent and<br />
in the same manner as is inspection of<br />
supplies for United States aircraft; and ( e)<br />
for an Australian Project Manager to be<br />
appointed with direct responsibility in conjunction<br />
with the United States Project<br />
Manager for initiating and monitoring all<br />
implementation of actions under the arrangements.<br />
The remaining documents laid upon the<br />
table are minutes of meetings, from which<br />
some extractions have been made, and<br />
paragraph 4 of the last document reaffirms<br />
-and I draw the House's attention to thisthe<br />
ceiling price of $ 5.95m on the basic<br />
Fill configuration which has already been<br />
announced, subject only to the conditions<br />
already announced in this House as to<br />
various ways in which escalation may occur.<br />
As to the subject of these documents, the<br />
aircraft itself, I will at this stage say only<br />
two things. If it is agreed that Australia<br />
needs a long range strike bomber-and I had<br />
gathered it was generally agreed that we did<br />
-then the Fill fulfils the requirements of<br />
the Australian Air Force staff for such a<br />
bomber in all respects.<br />
Mr Beaton-Does it now?<br />
Mr GORTON-Yes, it does now. It<br />
fulfils the requirements of the staff of the<br />
Australian Air Force who are the military<br />
advisers and who should know what is<br />
required in all respects now just as much<br />
as they did then. I know of no other<br />
available bomber that does fulfil the requirements<br />
of the Australian Air Force staff. If<br />
it is agreed-and I would hope it were<br />
agreed, but if it is not, then let us hear it<br />
later-that Australia needs a bomber which<br />
will fulfil these requirements of the Australian<br />
Air Force staff far into the future,<br />
instead of a bomber that only partly fulfils<br />
our requirements, and that for a limited<br />
time only, then this aircraft meets that need<br />
better than any other available aircraft that<br />
I know. Mr Connor-God help us.<br />
Mr Curtin-Do you think they will last<br />
long enough? Mr GORTON-I am not expressing my<br />
own opinion. I am expressing the opinion<br />
of the Air Force of Australia who advise<br />
the Government and of whom I would have<br />
thought the Opposition would take some<br />
notice. Let me repeat: If it is agreed-and<br />
perhaps it is not, and if it is not then let<br />
those honourable members opposite who<br />
are interjecting say so-that Australia needs<br />
a bomber which will fulfil the requirements<br />
of the Royal Australian Air Force staff far<br />
into the future instead of a bomber that<br />
only partly fulfils those requirements, such<br />
as those that the Leader of the Opposition<br />
( Mr Whitlam) has mentioned in this place,<br />
and that for a limited time only, then this<br />
Fill meets that need better than any other<br />
aircraft which has been mentioned in th<br />
House at any stage of this debate.<br />
Mr Speaker, I believe that the present<br />
difficulties into which this aircraft has run,<br />
which are no greater than the difficulties<br />
of any other aircraft at this stage of its<br />
development, will be overcome.<br />
Mr Bryant-You have been saying that<br />
for 10 years.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Order! The House will<br />
come to order. Interjections are coming<br />
from both sides of the House. I again<br />
remind honourable members that all interjections<br />
are out of order. The honourable<br />
member for Wills will restrain himself or I<br />
will deal with him.<br />
Mr GORTON-Thank you, Mr Speaker.<br />
I dare say that the honourable member for<br />
Wills might be restrained by the expert<br />
opinion of the Royal Australian Air Force,<br />
although I suppose this would be a matter<br />
that would be subject to debate. I would<br />
not be the least surprised if the honourab,<br />
member for Wills thought he was move<br />
militarily competent than the Government's<br />
RAAF advisers, but I would be surprised if<br />
many people would agree with him. I believe<br />
that the difficulties which this aircraft has<br />
encountered, which are no greater at this<br />
stage than any other aircraft has encountered,<br />
will be overcome. If that is so, Australia<br />
will have what I admit is a highly<br />
expensive aircraft but an aircraft which will<br />
rank among the most effective of any aircraft<br />
in any air force in the world. On any<br />
criterion the second best is not good enough<br />
for any defence requirement that we have,<br />
and it is not too expensive for a nation<br />
which needs the best in the world. I present<br />
the following papers:<br />
