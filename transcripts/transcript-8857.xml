PRIME MINISTERI<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINIST'ER, THE HON~ P J KEATING, HP<br />
DINNER IN HONOUR OF PRIME MINISTER MIYAZAWA<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 30 APRIL 1993<br />
( PLEASE CHECK AGAINSTr DELIVERY. EMBARGO 8.30 PM)<br />
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you,<br />
Prime Minister, to Australia.<br />
I understand this is your fourth visit to our country.<br />
We offer an especially warm welcome on this occasion<br />
because you are the first head of government to visit<br />
Australia since the March election.<br />
This is fitting given the very close ties that have<br />
developed between our two countries.<br />
The Australia-Japan relationship is longstanding and<br />
mature. It is based fundamentally on strong trade and economic<br />
relations which serve our two countries very well.<br />
But these days the Australia-Japan relationship goes well<br />
beyond our economic links, important though they are.<br />
By any standards, the quality of cooperation that has now<br />
been achieved between our governments in regional and<br />
international affairs is remarkable.<br />
And the range of people-to-people contacts which flourish<br />
between Australia and Japan attests to a high degree of<br />
mutual interest and friendship.<br />
All this is the more striking considering the different<br />
racial, social, religious and cultural backgrounds of the<br />
two countries.<br />
Prime Minister, I appreciated very much the warm<br />
jiospitality I received from you and your Government<br />
during my visit to Japan last September. </p>
<p>I am delighted that so soon afterwards I have an<br />
opportunity to receive you here in Canberra.<br />
Though your visit has been short, I hope you have been<br />
able to learn at first hand today something of our<br />
current priorities and preoccupations.<br />
Australia has achieved important progress over the past<br />
decade in making our economy more internationally<br />
oriented, more open, more competitive, and better able to<br />
take advantage of the economic dynamism of East Asia.<br />
But there is still more to do in this regard.<br />
Last week I announced our goal of making our labour<br />
market more flexible, by switching to a national system<br />
of enterprise bargaining.<br />
And this will help us to become more competitive, more<br />
able to take our place in the region.<br />
on that point, the Government is determined to encourage<br />
Australia's closer integration with the region.<br />
Australians know this is where our geography is and where<br />
our concentration must be and that-. we need to outfit<br />
ourselves properly to participate.<br />
On that score, there Is also wide support among the<br />
Australian public for us to define our national identity<br />
more clearly and more confidently.<br />
Earlier this week I announced the appointment of an<br />
advisory committee which will examine options for making<br />
Australia a republic without altering our existing<br />
parliamentary system or Commonwealth-State arrangements.<br />
I personally believe Australia will become a republic by<br />
the centenary of our federation in 2001.<br />
This, as I say, will help Australia's relations with the<br />
region by demonstrating that we are standing on our own<br />
feet both practically and psychologically.<br />
Prime Minister,' I was pleased that today we were able to<br />
carry forward the very productive dialogue we started<br />
last September on regional and international affairs.<br />
As we address a very fluid outlook in the Asia-Pacific<br />
region, Australia and Japan share many important<br />
interests and perspectives.<br />
Neither of us belongs to a trading bloc, and we each<br />
depend vitally on the maintenance of an open and<br />
non-discriminatory trading system-<br />
17)*-1rt7 K 77 , OT CC.-ir4W-jOC-v-73 </p>
<p>Both of us have important security and economic<br />
relationships with the United States and we both strongly<br />
support the long-term engagement of the United States in<br />
the Western Pacific.<br />
I listened today carefully to your account of your recent<br />
meeting with President Clinton and the outlook for Japan-<br />
US trade relations.<br />
As a friend of both Japan and the United Staten,<br />
Australia respects the difficulty and complexity of some<br />
of the issues that you are now grappling with in the<br />
Japan-US economic relationship.<br />
We have been heartened by your assurance today that Japan<br />
will not engage in managed trade with the United States.<br />
This is an important assurance.<br />
The outlook for the international trade envirornent is<br />
uncertain and troubled.<br />
We have to do all we can to remove that uncertainty.<br />
In that sense, it is imperative that political leadership<br />
be applied by all the main players to restore momentum<br />
towards a successful conclusion of the6 Uruguay Round of<br />
multilateral trade negotiations.<br />
Similarly, within the Asia-Pacific region, we face a<br />
decisive testing period for th e APEC forum.<br />
To demonstrate the usefulness of APEC as a force for<br />
trade liberalisation and facilitation, it is important to<br />
achieve concrete results at the Seattle ministerial<br />
meeting in November..<br />
As I explained in a speech on 8 February, I believe we<br />
should seek as our goal an integrated market which<br />
includes Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea,<br />
North America, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the ASEAN<br />
countries a market of 2 billion people producing half<br />
the world's output, bound together with harmonised trade<br />
rules, harmonised investment rules, harmonised standards<br />
and certification, and an agreed way of settling disputes<br />
between members.<br />
As we move along the path towards this goal, there may<br />
come a point where we decide to use the APEC acronym to<br />
stand for both the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation<br />
prneAn as well as the Asia-Pacific Eooi m~ i~<br />
To succeed, such a community must be founded on respect<br />
for the cultural diversity of the Asia-Pacific region and<br />
the different levels of development of member economies.<br />
Our own experience, the Australia-Japan bilateral<br />
experience, demonstrates that cultural differences are no<br />
?-41 </p>
<p>barrier to successful cooperation provided it is based on<br />
shared interests.<br />
As Australia and Japan have found, successful cooperation<br />
leads to trust and mutual confidence.<br />
Because of our shared interests and perspectives,<br />
Australia and Japan are well placed to work together in<br />
promoting the concept of an Asia-Pacific Economic<br />
Community based on principles of openness, nondiscrimination<br />
and practical cooperation.<br />
This is an Important way in which we can use the strength<br />
of the Australia-Japan partnership to promote open<br />
regionalism In the Asia-Pacific.<br />
Prime minister, let me conclude by saying how much I have<br />
valued your visit and our discussions today, and again<br />
how pleased I am to see you in Australia,<br />
I now invite the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, to<br />
join me in welcoming you and your delegation. </p>
