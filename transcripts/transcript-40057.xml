    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister announced today that Her Majesty The Queen has agreed to the Governmentâ€™s recommendation to remove Knights and Dames from the Order of Australia.</p>
<p>Awards in the Order of Australia are an important way of honouring the achievements and service of many Australians, including those unsung heroes who might not otherwise be recognised outside their local communities.</p>
<p>The Cabinet recently considered the Order of Australia, in this its 40th anniversary year, and agreed that Knights and Dames are not appropriate in our modern honours system.</p>
<p>The Cabinet resolved to recommend to Her Majesty that she amend the Letters Patent, which establish the Order of Australia, so that Knights and Dames would no longer be appointed to the Order.</p>
<p>This change will not affect existing Knights and Dames of the Order.</p>
<p>The process for appointments in the Order remains unchanged.</p>
