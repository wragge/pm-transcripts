PRIVU3 MINISTER'S INTERVIEW~ WITH RADIO 6PR -PERTH -20 OCTOBNR 197<br />
QUES~ TION<br />
.4ban on Jews entering Damascus?<br />
PRIM~ E MINISTER., Well, it is very good news of course, because<br />
we can't really condone a situation in which there is discrimination<br />
against any section of the Australian people. Through the ages<br />
there has been, fromi time to time, with differing severity,<br />
discrimination against the Jewish people. Many Jews came to<br />
Australia a long which ago, because this is a land, I believe,<br />
that is quite free of discrimination, and to have the cir~ cumstances<br />
in which there is an attempt to discriminate against people,<br />
Australians, because of their religion, is, of course, quite<br />
unacceptable. Diplomatic represecntations were made, inquiries<br />
were made, about the alleged travel restriction concerning<br />
Qantas flights through Damascus and we were told that the<br />
regulation wasn't in fact operative. When it cea~ ed to be operative<br />
I don't know it was in the IATA Handbook it has been<br />
applied, as I understand, much more rigidly by a number of<br />
other airlines who all understood it to b * e operative. But we<br />
were told that it wasn't operative -put like that, as if it<br />
could have come off at some time in the past. If that was so,<br />
we hadn't been told about it but the fact that it doesn't<br />
exist, that it has been removed, whther it has only just been<br />
removed, or whether it was further In the past is something<br />
that is very, very welcome indeed.<br />
QUESTION: Has the Federal Government Just heard about the<br />
restrictions? PflME MINISTER: One of the strange things about this is that<br />
only looking back through the Handbooks, appatrently the restriction*<br />
has been there at least since 1969, and perhaps much earlier,<br />
I think one of the straynge things about this is that it hasn't<br />
surfaced in the public domain before now, because the Handbooks<br />
are circulated to all travel agencies, and I would have thought<br />
at some stage, over the years, there would have been somebody<br />
who would have been resentful of the restrictions, that might<br />
say something for the-way Qantas and other airlines were<br />
administering it the fact that it hasn't surfaced becauce<br />
as I understand, passengers haven't b~ een refused tickets, but they<br />
wereitold of the matter, and it was then for their decision.<br />
It is surprising that it hadn't surfaced. X? am not aware that<br />
any Transport Minister, in any Government, had been advised of it<br />
in the past and was aware of it.<br />
QUESTION: flow did the Federal Government first hear ( inaudible.)<br />
PRIMP. MINISTER: I first heard of it when I read th-e Age newspaper<br />
one morning -and within at. out five minutes I was speaking to<br />
Peter Nixon , and hie said, I have already read it, and I have<br />
already launched inquiries.<br />
QUESTION: What sort of inquiries were these? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: Those inquiries were: what are the, facts,<br />
what were the facts?, When you see a newspaper story which<br />
concerns you the first thing to do is to establish the precise<br />
facts about i'b.<br />
QUESTION: What is going to happen now as far as the Federal<br />
Government is concerned?<br />
PlUIME MINISTER: I don't think there is any need for anything<br />
to happen now, because the restriction is not operative it<br />
has been lifted. That means there is no disorimination against<br />
any Australian citizens.<br />
QUESTION: Was it ever operative, do you know?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It was in the Handbook, and the airlines thought<br />
it was operative, so far as the Syrian Government is concerned.<br />
As I say, on the advice available to us, some other airlines<br />
have applied a bit more not necessarily on the route to Australia<br />
but in other areas, have applied the restriction more rigidly<br />
than Australia had.<br />
QUESTION: In the case that the restriction wasn't lifted,<br />
would we have gone so far as to a) protest, or b) ask Qantas<br />
to fly through Damascus?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Let's not bother about a question that is<br />
entirely hypothetical. The circumstance didn't arise the<br />
good sense has prevailed, and therefore, not let's postulate<br />
hypothetical circumstances which could be, quite obviously<br />
difficult. QUESTION: There was no situation reached of formal Government to<br />
Government contact with the Syrians?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Our diplomatic people made inquiries at a<br />
political level, and were told that it wasn't operative.<br />
That was obviously a very satisfactory answer from our point of view.<br />
It is a satisfactory answer, let's not hypothecate what<br />
might have happened in more difficult circumstances, because<br />
they didn't arise.<br />
QUESTION; So it is as a result of those diplomatic approaches<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The word to us was the regulation wasn't<br />
operative, implying that it hasn't been operative for some time.<br />
All the airlines thought that it was operative not just Qantas,<br />
other airlines, because checks have been made. Thereis a degree<br />
of an element of uncertainty in relation to that.<br />
I think what is past is past, and the important thing is that<br />
the restriction is not operative it' 8 off and there is<br />
not discrimination against any group of Australians, which is<br />
the important thing from our point of view.<br />
