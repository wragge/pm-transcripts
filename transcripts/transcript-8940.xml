STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THlE HON P 3 KEATING NIP<br />
THE WIK PEOPIJ;' S CLAIM AND COMALCO<br />
Federal Cabinct last night rcac led agreen n onl the Cononwealth approach<br />
to the legal claim by the Wik people over land including mining ] cases held by<br />
Cornalco.<br />
The decision will provide security for the major investment proposed by<br />
Comalco, while pennitting claims by the Wik people for-compensation and<br />
damages to proceed.<br />
This approach also ensures that negotiation will take place between the<br />
Commonweal th and Quccrnsland Governments, Comalco and thle Wik people.<br />
Cabinet agi-ccd that Commonwealth and Queensland legislation be introduced<br />
to validate all relevant land grants whose validity might be in doubt aq a rcsult<br />
of the existence of native title and its interaction with other laws. Thisvwill be<br />
included in the proposed generic Coimmonwealth Mabo legislation. Such<br />
validation of mining leases would not extinguish native title.<br />
Queensland may also legislate to validate leases, on a non-discriminatory basis,<br />
against other possible causes of invalidity unrelated to native title. Claims<br />
against the validity of leases would, in effect, be convcrtcd into claims into<br />
compensation or damages.<br />
Cabinet reaffirmed that the Corruionwealth will need to be satisfied, on<br />
examining the proposed terms of such Queensland legislation, that it is nondiscriminator-<br />
y.<br />
Compensation will be available for the Wik people, tinder the terms of the<br />
Commonwealth's generic Mabo legislation, for any direct extinguishment or<br />
i nipairinent arising from vid-aiiiii. </p>
<p>Other aspects of the decision reached by Cabinet are:<br />
Commonwealth legislation will support any prc-existing State legislation<br />
providing for the reservation of mineral rights to the Crown.<br />
Damages ( as distinct from compensation for validation) whether related<br />
or unrelated to native title, will be determined under existing laws or<br />
non-discriminatory State legislative schemes.<br />
In the event of claims against grants issued before June 1993, and<br />
dependent on the existence of native title, being successful,<br />
compensation or damages will be met by government, rather than by<br />
private landholders.<br />
The Commonwealth and Queensland Governments will hold<br />
negotiations with the Wik people, the minimum aim being to explore<br />
possible ideas for a settlement. Comalco should be required to<br />
participate in negotiations, at least to facilitate good neighbour coexistence<br />
of the Wik interests and the mining interests on the ground in<br />
the area.<br />
In addition to resolving the current uncertainties in Queensland, the approach<br />
has wider application to resolving uncertainties arising from the High Court's<br />
Mabo decision. It represents a valuable step forward towards the<br />
comprehensive, resolution of the issues on which work is proceeding. In<br />
particular, grants issued by governments in the past will be secured against<br />
invalidity arising from native title, not only those since the passage of the<br />
Racial Discrimination Act in October 1975.<br />
The emphasis which the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments place<br />
on negotiation also represents a vital element of the approach which must be<br />
brought to bear in the wider Mabo context.<br />
