PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, REVESBY WORKERS CLUB,<br />
SYDNEY 19 AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: How concerned are you that shots have been<br />
fired?<br />
PM: Very concerned. I continue to express the hope that<br />
good sense will prevail on the part of the Iraqi<br />
leadership because, as I've said consistently, all<br />
sensible analysis should lead the Iraqi leadership to<br />
concede that the best interests of their own people<br />
involves their withdrawal from Kuwait. I repeat what I<br />
have consistently said if they believe they have some<br />
legitimate grievances with their neighbour, then there<br />
exist mechanisms, peaceful mechansims whereby these<br />
issues can be considered and decisions made.<br />
JOURNALIST: Any Australian hostages, as you know, in<br />
military installations?<br />
PM: Well we don't know about disposition but we do know<br />
now that the Iraqi authorities have indicated to our<br />
representatives that the same arrangements apply to<br />
Australians as they've now sought to impose upon the<br />
Americans and the British. We have some, as far as we<br />
can ascertain in broad terms, about 80 Australians in<br />
Kuwait and about 70 in Iraq. All I can say is that our<br />
diplomatic authorities have been consistently and<br />
persistently putting to the Iraqi authorities our grave<br />
concern, our repudiation of this action that they're<br />
attempting to take.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about the Budget? How much pressure is<br />
the crisis putting on plans for that?<br />
PM: Well I wouldn't say enormous pressure, but obviously<br />
it does involve some recalculations. But as I've said<br />
earlier today, it's difficult to put firm figures on it<br />
because one has to make a whole series of assumptions<br />
about how long the crisis would last. Particularly also<br />
you've got to make assumptions about what will be done in<br />
regard to trying to fill the four million barrels per day<br />
shortfall that's involved in the loss of Iraqi and<br />
Kuwaiti supplies. That is capable of being made up and<br />
we just can't be sure about what will happen in this<br />
respect. </p>
<p>b 2<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you prepared to do any deals to free any<br />
Australian hostages?<br />
PM: You can't do deals, but I hope that as distinct from<br />
deals, that the pressure of world opinion which I think<br />
is virtually unanimous outside Iraq on this will1 bring<br />
good sense to bear. What did you say about Mr Griffiths?<br />
JOURNALIST: He says that there's going to be a backlash<br />
from Caucus about the speed at which you decided to send<br />
troops to the Gulf and the manner which<br />
PM: ( inaudible)<br />
JOURNALIST: The Resources Minister.<br />
PM: Did he?<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you agree that you're going to have some<br />
sort of trouble with the Caucus about the way the<br />
decision was arrived at?<br />
PM: No I wouldn't believe so. We had a unanimous<br />
position in Cabinet about it and I don't believe there<br />
are any problems.<br />
JOURNALIST: Dr Hewson' s asked today for you to make a<br />
Parliamentary statement next week about<br />
PM: I don't need the Leader of the Opposition to tell me<br />
how to conduct my affairs. There'll be a statement to<br />
Parliament, and our intention was to do that anyway. We<br />
don't need Dr Hewson to tell us how to run our affairs.<br />
He's got enough problems in his own Opposition. Let him<br />
concentrate on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you consult full Cabinet for any future<br />
decisions? PM: It's already been announced.<br />
ends </p>
