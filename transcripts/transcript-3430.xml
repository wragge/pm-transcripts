USiIHA I A"'<br />
PRIME MINISTER ~ PRESS STATEMENT NO. 351<br />
23 October 1974<br />
STATISTICAL SURVEY OF IMPORTS<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that the Australian<br />
Bureau of Statistics would begin immediately to introduce a<br />
monthly survey of importers which would allow the prediction of<br />
large, short-term fluctuations of imports in total and for<br />
selected sensitive commodities.<br />
" Information of future imports", he said, " particularly<br />
on significant changes in their trend, is needed by the Australian<br />
Government so that it can assess the potential effects of such<br />
changes on our balance of payments and on the level of employment<br />
in Australian manufacturing industries"<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that the Government was concerned to<br />
broaden the information base upon which its decisions were taken<br />
but in doing so was concerned to avoid unnecessary cost and<br />
burdening of Australian private enterprise. The system now being<br />
introduced met these criteria.<br />
