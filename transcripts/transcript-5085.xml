PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT WEDNESDAY, 27 JUNE 1979<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE: ON ENERGY POLICY ( TELEVISION SYDNEY)<br />
4 TREASURY PLACE, MELBOURNE<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
The Government has been amongst the first to move to import<br />
parity pricing for oil as a major component of its energy<br />
policy. Tihe statement that I auy malking today with thie iitc<br />
Kevin Newman, is now filling out that policy in a very forth* riJg* t<br />
manner indeed because quite plainly we need measures that will<br />
promote conservation. We need measures that will promote<br />
conversion from fuel oils to natural gas so that we can rely<br />
more heavily on sources of energy which are more readily<br />
available to Australia. We need measures that will continue<br />
to encourage exploration and development. We need to encourage<br />
more research and we need to make quite certain that we can take<br />
every possible measure to avoid the dangers of rationing in<br />
the future. Now, we can't guarantee that, but we can guarantee that<br />
the measures we are in fact introducing will involve a very<br />
fully pledged energy policy.<br />
For example, after the completion of current con-tracts for<br />
Conmmonwealth cars, not just for -the Government, but for<br />
Commonwealth instrumentalities, it will be our purpose only to<br />
buy vehicles fitted for gas use initially in Sydney, Canberra<br />
and Melbourne where the outlets are available and as outlets<br />
become available in other capital cities we will be moving to<br />
buy cars that are gas fired in those areas also.<br />
We will be doing this and the purpose of it will be to make<br />
sure that the major motor companies have gas fired cars on<br />
their production lines and then people purchasers won't have~<br />
to have a conversion job done later. A number of tax measures<br />
are being announced. We are taking sales tax off, as from<br />
tomorrow, off the conversion kits for gas fired cars. We are<br />
taking sales tax, where it applies, off other than oil home<br />
heating appliances. Measures of this kind are, again,<br />
designed to move away from oil and towards other sources of<br />
energy. The statement that is being issued is a very full one, a very<br />
detailed one, and I would commend it, so that people can see the<br />
real depth of the Government's measures. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Question Mr. Fraser, the fuel economy goals. How will these actually<br />
be brought in and how will they be enforced?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
They are voluntary goals, goals which have'been worked out<br />
with the industry, which the industry is happy to work to.<br />
Question W~ ill people have to buy certain types of cars in -the future?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No well, I hope not. I hope people will be able to have<br />
their own free choice, but these are goals that have been set<br />
by the industry. Quite obviously by those dates all cars won't<br />
be meeting those standards. They are the objectives for new<br />
cars. Question<br />
WThat about the lead level of the .65 grams. Are you putting<br />
petrol consumption before health at the moment?<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
For a very long while there was a much higher lead content in<br />
petrol and it is worth noting that the octane rating, the lead<br />
content, and the move to stage three of emission control if<br />
we took the right decisions for fuel economy on all these measur-es<br />
you would increase fuel economy by upwards of 10 percent. That's<br />
a very substantial increase indeed. If you are concerned, or i1<br />
people are concerned about emission quality in major cities<br />
Sydney perhaps in particular then if there can be much greaterconversion<br />
to gas fired cars in Sydney that's going to do a great<br />
deal for air quality control. That would need to be put in the<br />
other side of the ledger against a slight increase in lead content<br />
and against a maintenance of the present emission standards as<br />
opposed to going the further step.<br />
The decisions that have so far been taken by the N. S. W. and<br />
the South Australian Government to move to stage three of the<br />
emission controls are going to involve a very heavy price for all<br />
Australian motorists and a very heavy price in terms of additional<br />
fuel usage. The three measures which affect the quality of<br />
petrol and octane ratings and emission control which I suggested<br />
in this paper, are capable of saving upwards of 10 percent of<br />
Australia's use of motor spirits. Now, in the kind of world w.. e<br />
are living in, where L-uel is so important for Australia, that's<br />
a very large saving iirdeed. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Question What about the question of parity for oil prices, overseas<br />
prices. Why if we are only importing 30 percent should we pay<br />
these higher prices?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We need to have fuel priced at world parity to encourage<br />
exploration and development. When the price of Bass Strait oil<br />
-is pegged at the oir-$ 2.33, oil search was killed d-avelo -t<br />
was Killod off and ur-d'-: r those circumnstances we w., ere going t-o<br />
become more and more dependent on imported oil anyway for which<br />
you would certainly have to pay the world parity price. It's<br />
better to pay the world parity price to encourage exploration<br />
and development and make yourself less dependent on imported<br />
fuels. That policy is already having a sub-stantial result<br />
because reserves have been substantially increased as a result<br />
of development since the change of pricing policies were announced.<br />
The additional revenue significantly goes to the community in<br />
the form of tax, but sufficient goes to the companies to encourage<br />
them and to malke sure that exploration is continued. Without thrat,<br />
of course, our supplies would dry up and then we would be totally<br />
dependent on imports.<br />
There is one other point I ought to make. World parity price,<br />
the price we use, is the lowest official world price. Now there<br />
are many spot prices which I think go up to double the price<br />
that is used for world parity pricing. It is also worth noting<br />
that the Australian motorist pays much less for fuel, even though<br />
it is more than he is used to, than in most European countries<br />
and I think perhaps almost as many countries apart from<br />
North America. That's partly because those countries have to<br />
import their fuel and partly also because the Government taxes<br />
on the fuel are greater than in Australia.<br />

Prime minister<br />
The statement that was issued today is a result of a great<br />
amount of work by the Minister for National Development, his<br />
Department and by other Government Departments over a consideQa* a-le<br />
period. I think you know that the Minister had been developing<br />
a green paper which would have been a discussion paper for<br />
energy policy. But that now is really bypassed as a result ofE<br />
the policy decisions that have been made on a firm basis by<br />
the Government and as a result of the statement that has been<br />
issued.<br />
We are all well aware of the importance o" the energy proble:-ts,<br />
the shortage of fuel oil flowing out of the Iranian difficulties<br />
and the inability of other producers,' or unwillingness of oth~ er<br />
producers, to increase supplies as a result. In Australia we hav'e<br />
had, especially in the northern part of the country, shortages<br />
of Avgas. In some areas shortages of fuel oil and we have seen<br />
in NSW how a serious industrial dispute in one major refinery<br />
can cause enormous disruption to private people and to industry<br />
throughout the whole State.<br />
Against this total background it is clear that the Government<br />
that Australia needs to take a number of measures that will<br />
over time, reduce our dependence upon fuel oils and increase<br />
the use of other fuels of which Australia has an abundant<br />
domestic supply.<br />
We have very large reserves of natural gas. We are 70 percent<br />
self-sufficient in oil and we've got major reserves of coal<br />
in many parts of the continent. Therefore it is up to Australia<br />
to use the reserves, the fuel, the energy, that we have in a<br />
sensible'way and in an economical way. The overall petroleLun<br />
position looks like being manageable in the third quarter of<br />
1979 but there is uncertainty for the last quarter. That makes<br />
the measures that are being introduced all the more important.<br />
Under existing policy, a number of measures were introduced to<br />
encourage oil search, to encourage development and to encourage<br />
the North West Shelf which is one of the largest development<br />
projects ever to be undertaken in Australia. In addition to<br />
that, of course, we have moved to import parity pricing which<br />
is a central and integral part of an energy policy. I believe<br />
that any country Without import parity pricing can't claim to have.<br />
an energy policy at all. Because without out there won't be<br />
a rational use of energy resources between different forms of<br />
energy. Despite that, I think it is worth noting that in Australia we<br />
pay much less for petrol than in Japan, where it is nearly<br />
Australian cents a litre; the United Kingdom, over 45 cents;<br />
West Germany, over 40 cents; France nearly 50 cents; in Italy,<br />
over 50 Australian cents per litre. It's true in the United<br />
States and in Canada the price is lower than in Australia, but<br />
they don't have world parity pricing for their energy source,<br />
for fuel oil. I think there is a wide-held view that they<br />
ought to. </p>
<p>Prime Minister-( continued)<br />
If a major country such as the United States has a lower than<br />
realistic price, that means they do use more -than their<br />
fair share of a finite world resource. An important part of<br />
the world problem won't be overcome until there is world<br />
parity pricing in the United States. Our policies have already<br />
increased reserves by 600 or* 700 million barrels as a result<br />
of pricing policies and oil search has been revitalised where<br />
it had been killed under earlier policies.<br />
kcjainst this total background, 1 have~ a number of new ifllt~ ea: 1? zs<br />
to announce.<br />
Import parity pricing, of course, remains, but there can be more<br />
flexible -timing as a result of pricing changes which will take<br />
into account the pricing changes by OPEC countries themselves.<br />
We will be encouraging companies to go out and undertake spot<br />
purchases of fuel as it's necessary to maintain supplies in<br />
Australia and the Prices Justification Tribunal will asked to<br />
allow the necessary recovery of genuine increased costs that<br />
could come as a result of that. We'll be asking New South Wales<br />
and the South Australian Governments to do exactly the same thina.<br />
We've already announced in relation to AVGAS and fuel oil that<br />
if additional supplies can be contained then obviously the compa'. les<br />
would have -to be recouped for the cost of those fueld. We're going<br />
to suggest that emission standards stay as they are, as Mr Nixon<br />
has been arguing with the States for some time and if stage 3 of<br />
the emission controls are postponed that will prevent a further loss<br />
of up to 5% of motor spirit. That's a significant additional loss.<br />
We'll be moving from 98% to 97% octane for super petrol for oil<br />
companies and one major company will go to a standard of 92% and<br />
that should result in the savings of 2% of motor spirit and we'll<br />
also be suggesting that the States should move to a different<br />
lead content for petrol which could save up to 3% 0 of motor spin:.-<br />
Now these three measures taken all together could save up to ] 0%<br />
on motor spirit that would othbrwise be used and against that<br />
background that we have that's a very considerable saving.<br />
It ought to be noted that the measures will be undertaken will<br />
encourage a much greater use of natural gas and that of course<br />
improves pollution, or lessens pollution problems in major cities.,<br />
if the emission controls stay as they are instead of moving to<br />
stage 3 that there's a concern that that might worsen the pollution<br />
in major cities then a greater use of natural gas would have the<br />
opposite effect.<br />
There are some changes in policy on export controls, blanket<br />
approvals will be suspended and there'll be guidelines to protect<br />
Australian interests. We'll be getting more data from companies<br />
in relation to what they're doing in relation to storage facilities<br />
and we'll be reviewing the adequacy of storage around Australia.<br />
There'll be voluntary new fuel economy targets for major<br />
manufacturers. They are announced in the statement and over a time<br />
that would result in considerable savings. Targets have been<br />
worked out in co-operation with the companies and have their support. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
Government Departments and Agencies will be undertaking conserva-ion<br />
programmes and we'll be studying the scope for that and the Sta--es<br />
will be asked to do the same. There will be a publicity campcaign<br />
for conservation measures and the states will be asked to<br />
participate in that and there'll be a national conservation<br />
conference in October this year and again to highten the broadbased<br />
understanding of the need for conservation.<br />
We'll be seeking to encourage the substitution of other fuels<br />
for fuel oil and natural gas pipeline will be extended to Wagga.<br />
Bicallv, it only needs a 6" iplne for the naeds of '-. agqi b<br />
i t will be built on a 12" basis, late~ r to be connecta with Au:<br />
Thus, linking up the Bass Strait and the Cooper Basin gas fields.<br />
Then there will be one national grid, Sydney, Melbourne and<br />
Adelaide. The automotive use tax of 2.125% per litre will be taken off<br />
natural gas. The Sales Tax on conversion kits will also be taken. i<br />
off. That was a 15% Sales Tax as from tomorrow morning.<br />
We've made a decision already to convert 100 Commonwealth cars.<br />
A decision has been made to convert 450 more in the major<br />
Commonwealth fleet but after the exploration of existing contracts<br />
which run up, through I think, until about Junie of next year. Al<br />
new Commonwealth cars will be LPG fired for the Sydney, Melbourne<br />
and Canberra areas and as gas outlets become available in other<br />
cities, policy will be extended to other cities. There will nee--:<br />
to be I suppose, some petrol cars for those who have to go out Lito<br />
the countryside where gas may not be available.<br />
The States will be asked to do the same thing with their fleets.<br />
There are upwards of 40,000 cars and light commercial vehicles<br />
in Commonwealth fleet and in Commonwealth instrumentalities so cnie<br />
can see that this move, even if the States don't follow our<br />
example, and I can see no reason why they shouldn't, will create<br />
a considerable market-for gas-fired cars. it's our objective to<br />
see that -the companies establish factory production runs of gasfired<br />
cars and that again will encourage private useage so that<br />
conversion will not be necessary.<br />
We'll be undertaking what measures we can to encourage the wider<br />
distribution of natural gas.<br />
on home energy useage, any sales tax on non-oil domestic heaters<br />
and sales tax on all solar appliances will be taken off. We'll be<br />
encouraging further research and development and we'll be spending<br />
greater sums in the 79-80 Budget on energy research and<br />
development. That will rise'from about $ 7m overall this year to<br />
$ 14m next year through the Coal Research Trust Account and other<br />
energy research and development. That again, I think, is an<br />
important element. ./ 7 </p>
<p>7-<br />
We'll be asking for closer liaison with the States on a number o:'<br />
matters. The Transport Advisory Council has investigations underway<br />
at the moment on Urban Transport systems, which are again<br />
designed to save fuel.<br />
Obviously, there are contingency measures that we have and which<br />
are needed in an emergency situation as of the kind that was<br />
evident in New South Wales over recent times. but it's our hope that<br />
the emergency measures will not be necessary and that the broadbased<br />
measures of conservation of conversion which will be<br />
encouraged as a result of these policy changes will put Australia<br />
in a sounder position as any-other country in relation to its<br />
enErfy neecls.<br />
Question:<br />
Mr Fraser you've said that the supply of petrol, the regular,<br />
unlimited supply of petrol can't be guaranteed after the final<br />
quarter of this year. Does that mean that after that we could<br />
perhaps expect to hear restrictions, such as rationing?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I would hope not. But I point out that in some areas AVGAS is<br />
already rationed and there have been some shortages of fuel oil.<br />
Now, we're doing what we can to overcome those particular problem-s.<br />
We don't see real relief in the AVGAS situation for some time. it's<br />
been much more noticeable in Queensland and Northern Australia<br />
because those markets were supplied through imports and those<br />
imports have been largely cut off from Iran. Victoria and southern<br />
states have been supplied by a local refinery but we can't<br />
guarantee there won't be more severe situation and these measures<br />
are designed to put us into the best possible position to look<br />
after ourselves but you will have seen reports of rationing in<br />
other countries, the rationing shortages in the United States. lie<br />
want to avoid that here. It won't be possible to avoid it if wie<br />
have repitition of the kind of industrial problems that we had<br />
at Kurnell-Refinery.<br />
Question: What sort of petrol prices are we talking about ] 2 months from now?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I'm not going to speculate about that I think you'll have to get<br />
inside the mind of the OPEC countries to know what the price<br />
changes might be.<br />
Question: The days of Australia staying below the world prices, are over.<br />
Prime Mini'Eter:<br />
Well, we're well below the prices of countries that I mentioned.<br />
You've got here the price of a number of countries between 40c and<br />
per litre at this time. * That's partly because of world<br />
parity pricing but partly also because they have much higher<br />
Government taxes on their oil than we do. OUr prices are not at / 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
that level. North America does have lower prices than Australia.<br />
They have announced a decision to go to world parity priciLng but<br />
I think it's being implemented very slowly and very gently.<br />
That of course, involves the United States using more fuel oils<br />
than they otherwise would and thus depletesa finite world resource<br />
more quickly than she otherwise would. I believe that it is<br />
quite inevitable that the United States will also have to go to<br />
world parity pricing if they are to have a fully developed energy<br />
policy. Qu--S tion:<br />
Do you see that fuel useage in the United States is irresponsible?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well now, you're trying to suggest a word, I'm not going to use that<br />
word. Let me only say that I think the sooner all major countries<br />
have a policy of world parity pricing, the better it will be for the<br />
world's oil supplies. Most of course do. The view I've just<br />
expressed is not only by Australia it would be held by European<br />
countries it would be held by Japan. The main thrust of the<br />
policies that have been announced today are designed to make sure<br />
that Australia does everything Australia can to put herself in a<br />
reasonable position in the future.<br />
Question:<br />
What raises the question of the lead levels. Now it's rnot being<br />
red ' uced further than .65 grams. Are you putting fuel consumption<br />
before health levels at the moment?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, I think that's not a reasonable way of looking at it. For a<br />
very, very long while lead levels were higher than those that no*;<br />
prevail. In a number of States, the lead levels have dropped below<br />
the .65. What is suggested here is -that they were at the<br />
there could be not inconsiderable saving on the amount of fuel that's<br />
used. I think it's worth noting that while the savings from a<br />
particular measure might appear to be relatively at 1% or the<br />
three measures, the emission control staying where they are,<br />
changing the octane ratings and moving the lead levels slightly,<br />
those three measures alone could save up to 10% of the motor<br />
spirit that would otherwise be used in Australia. Now against the<br />
background of a world shortage of fuel of an Australian shortage<br />
of petrol, that saving of up to 10% is a very significant saving<br />
indeed. Again, as I know there are those who are concerned with<br />
pollution standards in some of the major cities, especially in<br />
Sydney then the measures that we've announced-to promote and<br />
encourage conversion to gas-fired cars should do much to hel?<br />
pollution. If State Governments could encourage that, if State<br />
Governments will follow our lead and convert their own Government<br />
fleets and the fleets of their instrumentalities, the pollution<br />
levels in major cities, such as Sydney would obviously be<br />
improved as a result of that. That needs to be put into the<br />
counterbalance against holding the emission standards where they<br />
are and a slight change in the lead levels. 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
Question: Sir, you suggest export controls will have to be modified and th-at<br />
allocations shares implemented by companies follow sensible anci<br />
shared practices and to protect Australia's interests. Does t-his<br />
suggest that the oil companies have been acting in a way that does<br />
not protect Australian interests?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, it doesn't. But quite obviously in this kind of situation we<br />
n21to know what 5; happening in the oil trade. ohat's -; oiru<br />
o-2 Australia just as much as we need to know what's coining into<br />
Australia and that's the reason for those particular changes.<br />
Question: Mr Prime Minister, could you estimate the total energy saving -!, or<br />
Australia of the new policy?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, I don't think you can undertake that or make that sort o-f<br />
estimate because a great deal will depend upon individual decisisns<br />
by people. How soon can we actually get the companies to have gasfired<br />
cars coming off their production lines? How many private<br />
motorists are going to buy gas-fired cars? H-ow soon can we get more<br />
distribution points. Now Melbourne is pretty well set-up and<br />
Canberra and Sydney I think will be well set-up with distributcr.<br />
points. With other capital cities there are difficulties. e<br />
have to work on all of this and work as expeditiously as we can.<br />
I think that I've learnt the hard way of giving targets and one or<br />
two other things and I'm not going to give a target on this one.<br />
Question: But you do put a 10% figure on motor spirits.<br />
Prime Minis-ter:<br />
No, I said up to 10%, as a result of three specific measures. If<br />
they're implemented as suggested in this paper. But if they are to<br />
be implemented or not is going to depend upon the co-operation of<br />
the States. Octane ratings, that's fine, that'll be undertaken<br />
but the emission controls and lead quantities will depend upon<br />
States.<br />
Question: Prime Minister, the oil companies have cut back on the amount o.-<br />
oil which will be imported into Australia since the uranium crisis.<br />
Firstly, could you give us a figure on the percentage cut-back<br />
which has occurred, there is some dispute about this and secondly<br />
could you explain how these measures, announced today are going to<br />
overcome this problem? / 13 </p>
<p>10<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, there is a shortage world-wide of about 2 million barrels<br />
per day.<br />
Each country therefore needs measures that will encourage the use of<br />
other forms of energy.<br />
At the same time, you need measures that are designed to keep up<br />
your own supplies of short fuels and make it go as far as it car'.<br />
So encouragement of exploration, development of new wells wherever<br />
that's possible. But they're medium-term measures and we have to<br />
pu:-ouriselves in as good rositCion as quiickly as we can.<br />
Mir Newan will correct ine iz I'm wrong, but I -think the reduction<br />
in supplies from most of the major oil companies is of the order<br />
of what<br />
Mr Newman:<br />
Average across, yes, it varies with some countries.<br />
Question: How are these measures you've announced today going to overcome<br />
and compensate for that 10% reduction over the short-haul?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Look, you can't have a situation in which you wake up tomorrow<br />
morning and you've got a different position, you have to have<br />
policies, those policies have to be given time to apply and that's<br />
quite plain. Now the extent of the difficulties that Australia<br />
might have to face can't yet be predicted with any real degree of<br />
certainty. A good deal is going to depend on measures that are<br />
taken by other countries to restrain their use of oil<br />
also worth noting, I think, that at the present time most oil<br />
tankers, around the world, as I am advised are full, waiting for<br />
the expected OPEC price increases that could be announced later<br />
today, tomorrow and the Minister will be making statements of the<br />
prices following from July 1, as a result of that once those<br />
OPEC decisions are known. As I'm advised there is a good deal o:<br />
oil in tankers waiting for that price rise to cash in on it. No-,<br />
-that's obviously, at the present moment, making the shortage worse<br />
as a result of that speculative holding of oil stocks for a period.<br />
Question: How are you going to guarantee that those oil companies do not c,,, t<br />
back further and increase that 10% of oil which is not coming to<br />
Australia? Is there any measure you<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
we expect oil companies to behave as responsiblc Australian<br />
citizens when they are operating in Australia and we have no<br />
reason to believe that they won't continue to do so. / ii: </p>
<p>11<br />
Question: You've said, Mr Fraser, you said before you lifted the 15% sales<br />
tax of course on conversion costs. Now, other<br />
might need to be applied to incite those who are thinking about<br />
it, to go to conversion. Has there been consideration given to<br />
either subsidising the conversion industry or the actual consumer<br />
to make a conversion?<br />
Prime Minis-ter:<br />
Qulite a large number of people in Melbourne and Canberra, taxis<br />
-2cialiy, hav,: arad been cnetd i'mi advi , sed -that ta: is<br />
get their money back in 6-7 weeks in this city, so the fuel price<br />
difference between petrol and gas is a very substantial incentive<br />
for anyone who does any mileage. It's a very substantial incentive<br />
indeed and I'm glad for your question because I haven't brought<br />
that point out. It's one that probably a lot of motorists are<br />
not yet aware of.<br />
Question: The fact that you're encouraging Australian companies to go into<br />
the spot market is actually an encouragement to the more<br />
extremist elements ( inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, if you've got a particular shortage of fuel oil or of AVGAS<br />
and if you've got say a cotton crop that has to be sprayed and can<br />
only be sprayed by an AVGAS fired aeroplane, I'm quite sure<br />
those cotton producers would want to get the gas so that they could<br />
carry out their spraying. There are some uses for which you just<br />
have to have the fuel and quite obviously the Government has got<br />
to do everything it can to make sure those very essential purposes<br />
are maintained. We don't want spot purchases any more than is<br />
essential but I also understand that during the New South Wales<br />
crisis, with Kurnell, Mr Wran was very actively looking around for<br />
fuel from overseas and again I was advised that at one point he<br />
had fuel lined up. Now whether that's actually coming in view of<br />
the settlement or not, I don't know.<br />
Question: Has the Government given any consideration to imposing speed limits<br />
throughout Australia to conserve fuel?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, we haven't considered that point at the moment.<br />
Question: You mentioned shale oi] in your policy but you didn't mention<br />
methanol or ethanol. / 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
They're mentioned in the tatement. But again I'm glad you<br />
mentioned the question of shale oil because the Rundle deposits<br />
are very large indeed, could involve reserves roughly equivalent<br />
to the oil reserves available to us. Technology is available<br />
in the world for development. We'll be having discussions with<br />
the Queensland Government to see what can be done to expedite<br />
development. Again,. that's not a short-term policy but it's a<br />
development that will be necessary for Australia and will put us<br />
in a much more secure position.<br />
Qi jt ion:<br />
What about ethanol and methanol, are you planning to develop those<br />
too? Mr Newman:<br />
In the statement you will find that there is a precise reference<br />
to both ethanol methanol and coal liquifaction. If the statement<br />
says two things, it will continue in fact increase R D in all<br />
those areas plus we'll up our economic assessments and all the<br />
other things that go with that. All those. The P. M.' s been<br />
emphasising oil shale because of its very great potential.<br />
Question:<br />
Prime Minister one way of overcoming short-term problems is through<br />
Government to Government purchases. Was this considered?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It is considered and it's not ruled out. Enquiries are being made<br />
overseas now in relation to just that.<br />
Question: What is the current state of play and can you mention any particular<br />
company. Prime Minister:<br />
No, I can't, I'm sorry.<br />
Question: You're going to Nigeria is that<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Enquiries are under way now, we don't have the results of those<br />
enquiries. The enquiries were authorised a week or two ago. / 13 </p>

Question: Prime minister, will you take the lead and convert to a gaspowered<br />
car yourself?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Some months ago, I told the Gas and Fuel Corporation in Melbourne<br />
that I'd convert my Melbourne car so long as they could guarantee<br />
that I could fill it up when I'm down in the bush. Well, they said<br />
let's wait a while. I'll do it as soon, I do large mileages out in<br />
the country, as soon as I can make sure I can get out and get back.<br />
Question:<br />
Will you also restrict your speeds,. Prime Minister?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Obviously, Will you?<br />
Question:<br />
What about setting an example on down-sizing the car that you do<br />
use?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
official car? I think if you try and use a briefcase and do some<br />
work in a mini minor you'd find it a little difficult. One of the<br />
problems of chauffer-driven cars is that they do need to be of a<br />
certain size. I am using Australian built cars for the first time<br />
as you probably know. Our own private car is a Commodore, so that's<br />
a smaller car and I think it's a very good world-class car.<br />
Question: Prime Minister you mentioned on page 14 of your statement the<br />
Government has ( inaudible)<br />
programmes national fuel economy, could you tell us how you expect<br />
to achieve this, what have you got in mind.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
That is a programme being undertaken with the companies. It's been<br />
worked out with these companies, accepted by the companies it is<br />
expected that they should be able to meet for the production of<br />
new cars.<br />
Question: They've made a commitment on that have they?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes. / 1-4 </p>
<p>14<br />
Mr Newman:<br />
The figures that the P. M. has given is based on a national energy<br />
advisory committee report which the P. M. has said that he has<br />
worked out with the industry. They are better than the industry<br />
first announced and there will be again, on a voluntary basis,<br />
annual checks on what's happening.<br />
Question: Prime Minister, you mention that the ninth measure, export contrcls<br />
controlling the product that we modified and blank approvals c<br />
e : Gorts will be suspended. Who is that aimed at?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It's not aimed at anyone, it's purpose is to make quite sure that<br />
the Government knows exactly what is happening in trade in this<br />
area. Question: Will it affect the Western Australian Government though, with it's<br />
export of LPG<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Oh no, no. Look, we're aiming this at fuel oils and fossil fuels<br />
rather than, nothing that we've done affects our commitments to<br />
Western Australian Government in relation to the North West Shelf<br />
and the export of gas from the North West shelf.<br />
Question: Prime Minister are you concerned on another matter that wage<br />
indexation might collapse?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Oh, I think you'll need to wait and see what's going to happen<br />
out of the Conference called by Sir John Moore. Mr Viner's<br />
making comments on that matter and I don't want to add to it.<br />
