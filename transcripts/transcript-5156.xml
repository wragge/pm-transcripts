PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 2 OCTOBER 1979<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, HOBART<br />
Prime Minister<br />
and they were very useful discussions and I had a few friends<br />
waiting for me downstairs. I think it must have been too much<br />
for the Labor Party when we had a demonstration on my side<br />
earlier today over some environmental matter and the demonstration<br />
reverted to type as I came into this building. That's why I don't<br />
have a coat on and don't have a tie on, so I hope you will forgive<br />
me for that.<br />
But we have had a very useful meeting of the Cabinet and the<br />
Ministry this m~ orning. A number of decisions have been made<br />
and we have had very useful discussions with the Premier and<br />
-the Deputy Premier this afternoon, including discussions with<br />
a delegation about the Tasmanian airfares.<br />
It is * worth noting that Mr Lowe went out of his way to<br />
praise the working relationship that has been established with<br />
Kevin Newman on Tasmanian-Commonwealth problems. He welcomed<br />
the very real financial committment that the Commonwealth<br />
government has made over a significant period of time to<br />
the Callaghan Report and to the implirnentation of a wide range<br />
of measures under that Callaghan Report. I obviously welcome<br />
Mr Lowe's somewhat belated recognition of the Commonwealth<br />
for these particular matters, and quite plainly the Commonwealth's<br />
comm-ittment is there, and our support for Tasmania through<br />
a variE-2ty of programmes will be continued.<br />
Mr Batt it was very ecumenical also went out of his way<br />
to praise the government for its implementation of the Callaghan<br />
Report and for the Freight Equalisation Scheme which has been of<br />
such enormous benefit to Tasmanian manufacturers and to<br />
Tasmanian primary producers.<br />
It is very pleasing to note that the Premier and Mr Batt both<br />
have such a high regard for Commonwealth policies in relation to<br />
the State of Tasmania.<br />
A number of decisions have been made which ministers<br />
can expand in answer to your questions if you would like them<br />
to. We are going to charter a vessel to undertake two special<br />
cruises in 1979-80 for exploratory fishing around Macquarie,<br />
Heard and MacDonald Islands. This is a part of the general approach<br />
to survey fish resources in the 200 mile zone around the<br />
sub-Antarctic Islands. The programme we hope will obviously<br />
locate new resources. We hope also that the State might provide<br />
some finance in relation to this because successful exploration<br />
oquld give a * significant boost to fishing and to the processing industries,<br />
especially in Western Australia and Tasmania. It is part of the<br />
general approach that the government has adopted to exploration<br />
of the Australian fishing resources that in this instance the<br />
decision should be of particular advantage to this State. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
We are going to construct a Commonwealth law courts building in<br />
Hobart. It will be a new complex. we have given approval for<br />
the design and development to a stage where it will be submitted<br />
to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on public works.<br />
Now, the building will . house the Federal Court, the Family Court,<br />
the Arbitration Commission and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.<br />
The cost is likely to be in excess of $ 8 million so it is quite<br />
a substantial committment. The law courts will be situated in<br />
Davey Street, near some of the most historic architecture in<br />
this city.<br />
TAA and Ansett have been negotiating for some time with Qantas<br />
in relation to the Hobart-Christchurch airlink We now have<br />
a proposal from Ansett in relation to their negotiations with<br />
Qantas and that means there is something firm that can be put<br />
to New Zealand. Now, the Commonwealth will be doing that. It will<br />
be supporting it, and we hope very much that we will get New Zealand'<br />
agreement. The matter has been held up to this point because<br />
there was a question of subcharter arrangements between Qantas<br />
and the domestic airlines and a question of them working out<br />
arrangements and putting firm proposals to us.<br />
Ansett has done that. We would hope that TAA will follow suit,<br />
but we now have something firm to put to New Zealand so it will<br />
be processing that.<br />
Peter Nixon advises me that once there is approval, whatever<br />
changes are needed at Hobart airport are unlikely to delay<br />
implementation of the new service. He believes that it would<br />
not delay the implementation of the new service and we would<br />
regard it as a facility that would be of very great benefit<br />
to Tasmania. It ought to enable this State to expand its<br />
tourist potential very greatly indeed. The Tasmanian government<br />
has agreed in the discussions this afternoon to contribute to the<br />
cost of improved facilities at the airport.<br />
So that matter is progressing quite well, and we certainly won't<br />
be losing any time in putting it to New Zealand. Their air<br />
traffic people are at the moment in other international<br />
negotiations. The only delay that I could see is the<br />
readiness and capacity of New Zealand to negotiate with us, but<br />
we would be asking them to pursue this matter as soon as can be.<br />
There are other matters which are not of specific Tasmanian<br />
interest but which I think are of general interest where we<br />
have made decisions today. In the Budget we announced a decision<br />
to exempt from sales tax equipment designed and manufactured<br />
expressly forthe use of blind or deaf persons. Now, some other<br />
elements of equipment had already been exempt as I am advised,.<br />
but we wanted to make sure that the exemption extended to equipment<br />
used by handicapped people, generally. We have now made a<br />
decision to exempt a full range of the equipment. It will<br />
certainly include such things as manual controls for vehicles<br />
and other aids designed for use by disabled persons.<br />
Senator Guilfoyle and the Finance Minister will be working<br />
out the full details of the list, but I think it will be a<br />
useful additional assistance to handicapped persons generally,<br />
not just an assistance to blind or deaf people. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
That is a change or innovation which I hope everyone would want<br />
to support. For some time there has been a time limit on the<br />
continuation of the Homeless Persons Assistance Programme and<br />
this has provided assistance to a very large number of people<br />
who have got into difficulty over recent times. There is a<br />
restriction on the time limit of the present Act. What we are<br />
going to do iS remove the limitation of time for which the<br />
Act will have effect. Decisions will be made later about<br />
the contin~ ued funding and the extent of Commonwealth funds<br />
that will go to the programme. But, what we have in fact decided<br />
is that rather than having a finite period to the life of those<br />
programmes, the programmes will in. fact be continued. We will<br />
be making this perfectly plain in our own legislation.<br />
At about the time of the budget, the point was put to us about<br />
sales tax exemption for small businesses. It was put to us against<br />
the background of people who produce arts, craft work, people<br />
who often work in their own homes. The present exemption levels<br />
are $ 1,000 for goods made exclusively in the manufacturers own<br />
home, and $ 1,400 for goods made elsewhere not exclusively in<br />
a person's own home. The exemption limits had been set I think<br />
in the early 1940s, certainly a very, very long while ago. The<br />
exemption limits were partly for administrative reasons so that<br />
you are not going to try and collect sales tax from a whole range<br />
of very small manufacturers, but when it was originally introduced<br />
it was something which had a particular benefit to the people<br />
making arts and crafts of different kinds and representations<br />
had come ' to us, especially over the last several weeks in relation<br />
to these matters.<br />
Well, now we have examined it and the old exemption limit of<br />
$ 1,000 is going -to be raised to $ 12,000. It applies-to all small<br />
businesses but in achieving or establishing the new exemption<br />
limits we have in mind in particular the case of people making<br />
a livelihood out of arts and crafts, producing things<br />
own handiwork. THat also will be welcomed by a quite significant<br />
group of people.<br />
There is an addition to that an annual tax liability exemption<br />
which will be raised from $ 100 to $ 250.: The two figures are not<br />
specifically related the last figure is, I think, really for<br />
administrative convenience.<br />
Two or three weeks ago, Andrew Peacock announced a special aid<br />
programmes to Kampuchea as part of an international effort, and<br />
he did that against the background of a growing knowledge of a<br />
very serious and tragic circumstance in Kampuchea but also against<br />
the background of a very real concern that the aid we provide<br />
gets to as many people as possible in Kampuchea who need the aid.<br />
We obviously don't our aid to go the Vietnamese army or to<br />
the military forces. We want it to get to people who have been<br />
penalised and deprived over a very long period of fighting and<br />
a very long period of difficulty, growing first out of the<br />
activities of the Pol Pot regime, secondly, out of the activities<br />
of the Vietnamese invasion. The earlier announcement made by the<br />
Foreign Minister did come out of existing aid funds.<br />
We have decided to provide a further<br />
$ 2 million over and above that earlier commitment . because of<br />
the seriousness of the general position of Kampuchea. Having<br />
said that, we do remain very concerned that the funds we provide<br />
should get to those who need it. International supervision will ./ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
certainly be necessary in Kampuchea and that it doesn't go to<br />
the military and get used in a sense, to support military<br />
activities. The other matter which is, -I think, of general interest -rthere<br />
has been experimental ethnic television . undertaken over<br />
the last several weeks. There is an Ethnic Television Review<br />
panel chaired by Mr Frank Galbally, and there have been<br />
recommendations that the experimental programme should be<br />
continued.<br />
Now, that is going to be continued. Sums will be provided as<br />
necessary for the continuation. We hope increasingly there will<br />
be comments and criticism of the programmes so that when<br />
the ethnic television does come to be launched with its<br />
own separate channel, the programmes can be as best advised<br />
as possible to meet the needs and wishes of Australia's<br />
ethnic communities.<br />
I also want to make the point that I think some of the best<br />
ethnic television programmes will be ones which are attractive<br />
not only to people who have come to Australia in the years<br />
since the last World War, but ones which all Australians will<br />
want to see. For example, I think there is considerable<br />
benefit in all Australians having a better understanding<br />
of the history and background of many Austalians who have their<br />
origin-s from Greece or Italy or other overseas countries.<br />
The day. is long passed when it was good enough for people to<br />
learn British history, ancient and modern, and Australian history<br />
since the foundation of Australia we need to have a wider<br />
understanding of the backgrounds of the many countries from<br />
which many Australians have now come. There will be opportunities,<br />
I would hope, for ethnic television to achieve that kind of<br />
objective. In other words, the best ethnic programmes I<br />
believe ought to have an appeal to wide body of Australians,<br />
not just to one particular group, people from one particular<br />
country. Ithink that is about all the decisions that we made this<br />
mornir~ g, specially of particular interest to Tasmania,<br />
and secondly, some decisions that we have made of wider<br />
national interest. The Ministers concerned will be issuing<br />
their own more detailed press statements on all of those<br />
particular matters. If you have any questions<br />
Question: It was suggested in one press report this morning that one<br />
of the reasons for the government or cabinet considering<br />
some of these Tasmania decisions is because the government<br />
believes that there is an 80% chance of a State election<br />
in the next five weeks over the constitutional crisis. Does<br />
the government in fact, believe that there is an 80% chance<br />
of ( inaudible) and secondly do you believe the Liberal Party<br />
in Tasmania should try to force an election through the<br />
constitutional...? </p>
<p>Prime Mini-ster:<br />
I am not going to comment on what Parties in this State<br />
may or may not do. For what it is worth, my own hunch is<br />
that an election is exceedingly remote, if for no other<br />
reason than I am sure Mr Lowe doesn't want one.<br />
Question: Have you spoken to Mr Pearsall about the prospects of an election<br />
or whether the Liberal Party...?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Not in detail, no. It is a State matter so far as we are concerned.<br />
These decisions have been made. I think it ought to be noted<br />
that over a continuous period we have made a whole stream<br />
of decisions as a result of the Callaghan Report as they<br />
affect Tasmania. A number of matters were announced in the<br />
last budget. The decisions were taken significantly before<br />
the State election but we were ( slightly forced?) to announce<br />
them out of time so when we came down here and assisted<br />
the State during the election we knew what the decisions<br />
were going to be in the budget. But of course they weren't<br />
mentioned and there were a number of ones, as you know,<br />
including the beginning of the construction of the second<br />
Hobart bridge which means a great deal to this city.<br />
The development of the special programmes for this State<br />
have proceeded on a continuous basis. As we have been able<br />
to make the decisioins, so they have been announced.<br />
You have the main Freight Equalisation scheme itsi-lf<br />
shortly approaching the total commitment of about $ 60 million,<br />
the Antartic Division which Michael Hodgman and others have<br />
fought so hard for, the Launceston general hospital, the second<br />
Hobart bridge, the air pollution station at Cape Quinn, Then<br />
there are the additional funds for the native forestry development<br />
programme, grants towards the Tasmanian fish centre in Hobart,<br />
a loan to assist with the pilot industrial state at Legana,<br />
sums for the Launceston Precision Tool1 Pnnexe, and a very<br />
significant grant as part of a seven year programme-to assist<br />
with the restoration of Port Arthur. So you have a whole<br />
stream of programmes that have been announced over a period<br />
and-what we have announced today is consistent with that.<br />
Question: In your view, what is the best course to be followed to solve<br />
the constitutional crisis?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
In Tasmania? I don't want to offer a view about that. It is a State<br />
matter. If you would like to ask me about Federal matters I would<br />
be very happy to give you a view, but they don't condern the<br />
Commonwealth and it would be gratuitous of me to offer a public<br />
view on the matter. </p>
<p>-6<br />
Question: Did Mr Lowe tell you he didn't want an election?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It is my judgement that he doens't want election for very<br />
obvious reasons.<br />
Question: How do you feel personally when you are subjected to the sort of<br />
scenes you saw below?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I just get slightly annoyed about it. You know, people ought<br />
to know how to behave and people can make a point if they<br />
want to. I think one or two people were probably surprised<br />
and; annoyed that there was a demonstration when I arrived here<br />
this morning which was a friendly one wanting assistance from<br />
the Commonwealth, wanting assistance from myself, and I'<br />
suspect the Labor Party made a decision somewhere or other<br />
that it has got to alter that kind of appearance. I remember<br />
when there was a function at the Wentworth in Sydney when<br />
the police were quite inadequate as they were down here in<br />
at least making a path you could walk through which I think<br />
is a reasonable enough thing to expect. I suppose 50 or so<br />
peeple going into the Wentworth in Sydney had tomatoes or<br />
flour or whatever thrown over them but the Opposition in<br />
the Federal Parliament knew that that demonstration was going<br />
to take place long before it did. Under those circumstances<br />
I think it is perfectly plain that some elements in the<br />
Opposition have been involved in organising that particular<br />
demonstration because I think they knew about it before any<br />
of the agencies, of the Cornmowealth knew about it.<br />
Question: Do incidents like this perhaps make you think twice before you<br />
appear in public?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Good heavens no. I have had a rule for a long while -I go in<br />
a front door and I go out a front door, and I expect the police<br />
to have whatever arrangements are necessary to enable that to<br />
take place. There have been one or two difficult circumstances<br />
at Monash University for example. The Liberal students at<br />
Monash make a habit of asking me back just to demonstrate<br />
that nobody is going to get run off that particular campus<br />
and I will be back at Monash sometime in the early part of<br />
next year.<br />
Question: ( inaudible) / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
Prime Minister:.<br />
I would believe that it is well within the capacity of the<br />
State Police.-normally the New South Wales Police have in fact,<br />
been very good, and you-know, are much better than some others.<br />
The occasion at the-Wentworth was the only time I have known<br />
in which the New South Wales Police have not been adequately<br />
prepared. They just did not have enough* numbers there. It must<br />
have been a great inconvenience, not only for the people going<br />
to the . f unction that I was-going to but the whole entrance<br />
of that side of the Wentworth Hotel was blocked off. These<br />
matters are well'within the capacity of the State Police,<br />
I don't imagine they will want to get caught short again.<br />
Question: Are you satisfied with the way the State Police handled it<br />
here today?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
There weren't enough-' numbers. It wasn't handled the walk throughand<br />
everyone got either rotten eggs or tomatoes thrown over them<br />
which nothing more than annoying but it is not a very intelligent<br />
way of demonstrating a point of view.<br />
Question: A question on the Ministry, if I may how long can you realistically<br />
keep, reserve a place in the Ministry for Mr Sinclair?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
There is an assumption inherent in that question I will watch<br />
Peter Nixon, and if I think he is getting a bit tired, I will have<br />
a word with, but I don't think he would.<br />
Question: So you are prepared to let it go for months?<br />
Prime. Minister:<br />
I think everyone should relax.<br />
Question: you would hope for a resolution to the Finnane inquiry..?<br />
Prime.. Minister:<br />
The'New South Wales government is now in very, very real difficulty<br />
because they have published a report which universally is<br />
recognised as one that has been-handled in a. very improper way<br />
by the Attorney General in New South Wales. Let me just repeat:<br />
The evidence was taken in private, the witnesses were not subect<br />
to a normal cross-examination, their evidence was not tested,<br />
the person who was being accused didn't get a chance to answer<br />
the allegations, and as a result of that, somebody came to certain / 8 </p>
<p>-8<br />
Prime Minister: Ccont. 1<br />
conclusions and made certain findings. That doesn't make them<br />
facts, it might make them the opinion of one person. But the<br />
document is not a legal document, it can't be presented to a cXurt<br />
of law, evidence would have to be presented again where it could<br />
be properly tested, where the witnesses could be checked, where<br />
their credibility could be under question, and inspite of<br />
that, the New South Wales Attorney General rushed to publication<br />
of the report. A large number of copies were made available<br />
to the press. I am advised by that reliable journal, the Financial<br />
Review, that there was a press lock-up, and that. public. servants were<br />
busy pointing out the bits most damaging to Mr Sinclair. That<br />
doesn't seem to me to have much at all to do with the course of<br />
justice -it might have a great deal with the course of injustice,<br />
it might have a great deal to do with politics, and it certainly<br />
is a subversion of the normal processes of the law.<br />
So we have a situation in which a report damaging to Ian Sinclair<br />
has been left in the air and the only way Ian Sinclair can,<br />
as it is at the moment, answer it by his own statement in the<br />
Parliament, by a further statement statement if he feels that thatis<br />
necessary.<br />
The ought to be a prosecution so that the matter can properly<br />
be tested. The New South Wales government is not prepared to<br />
prosecute. It ought to repudiate that particular report. The<br />
issue now is certainly one as to whether or not the New South Wales<br />
government and Mr Wran in particular because he must be resonsible<br />
for pursuing a course which is denying justice to a person in<br />
Australia. Whatever -Australians might feel on a particular matter,<br />
I think we have all got a view of basic justice the right<br />
to a fair trial is the right of every Australian. There is<br />
also a right to be assumed to be innocent until proven guilty.<br />
Now, it would appear that the whole purpose of the operation<br />
undertaken by the New South Wales government to create the<br />
presumption of guilt before there had even been a charge<br />
laid, before there had been an attempt to get the matter into<br />
court and there is a great principal underlying this.<br />
Certainly this involved somebody who is senior member of my<br />
government, 1but if there can be an effort if it is allowed to<br />
be successful to destroy Ian Sinclair's reputation as a result<br />
of the activities of Mr Walker and Mr Wran, that can happen<br />
to any citizen of the Commonwealth. There is a process available<br />
that can destroy any person, any corporation if the same<br />
processes are pursued and there is not the course to law,<br />
there is not the course to the normal processes to enable<br />
a person' s innocence to be proved or disproved one way or another.<br />
So, underneath the Sinclair affair and the Finnane report, there<br />
is an enormously serious principle which the activities of Mr Walker<br />
and Mr Wran have put in jeopardy. that is a principal which is<br />
basic to the normal human rights of every Australian. I believe<br />
increasingly, as the days pass, people will be looking to Mr Wran<br />
to see how he is going to address that, and allow the rule of<br />
law to properly and fairly upheld. As I have said before,<br />
every day that that particular report is left in the air, matters<br />
are left as they -are, is a day which condemns the very being of<br />
the New South Wales government itself. ./ 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
Prime minister: ( cont.)<br />
None of that is a question of whether it is ultimately right or wrong.<br />
It is a question of his right to have a fair trial. That is the<br />
issue now, and without the right to a fair trial, there is no<br />
justice, there is no fairness and no ultimate liberty in Australia.<br />
That just underlines the great principal that lies behind the<br />
perversion of justice that has been perpetrated by the-New South Wales<br />
government. I know quite well that there have other inquiries conducted in<br />
the same manner but it is a question of what happens to those<br />
inquiries how they are used, how they are exploited.<br />
Let me just make one point which I think, hasn't much been in<br />
the public domain. Whatever one might say of Mr Finnane, nobody<br />
has doubted his association with the Australian Labor Party.<br />
I would have thought that an Attorney General with devout belief<br />
in the law and the rule of law, and with the devout belief in<br />
his responsibility to adminitter that law without fear or favour<br />
and with total impartiality., if he really felt it were necessary<br />
on advice from the Corporate Affairs Commission which I suspect<br />
he did not have, on advice from his Crown Solicitor which I suspect<br />
he did not have, but if he really believed that on advice there<br />
ought to be an inquiry launched against somebody who was plainly<br />
a very significant political figure, then surely he ought to<br />
lean over backwards to pick somebody with no political affiliations<br />
who has not been associated with our Party, with the National Party,<br />
or with the Labor Party, for the conduct of that particular<br />
inquiry so -that there could be integrity in the general motives<br />
of the Attorney General who launched the inquiry.<br />
What I am saying in itself is not a criticism of Mr Finnane,<br />
it is a criticism of the Attorney General, and it is criticism<br />
of the New South Wales Government, which has of its own actions,<br />
created a set of circumstances which is certainly open to<br />
the use of its legal and quasi judicial processes as<br />
inspectorial procedures for political purposes.<br />
It will be up to the way the New South Wales government behaves<br />
from this point on and without too much delay which will prove<br />
or disprove whether that possibility is a real one or whether it<br />
is not.<br />
Question: . t~ hief New South Wales government repudiates the Finnane<br />
report ( inaudible) . Will you invite him back?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Let'Is take one step at time. I have already said if these matters<br />
are dismissed. Ian Sinclair is an extraordinarily able person and<br />
all his colleagues would be delighted to have him back of<br />
course we would. But what I am putting doesn't go to Ian Sinclair's<br />
innocence or Ian Sinclair's guilt. Let me make that quite plain.<br />
If there are matters to be answered, they need to be answered.<br />
What it does go to is his right to a fair and to a free trial,<br />
the right which is basic to every person in this nation, and<br />
what person could there be in New South Wales now, who has not </p>
<p>10<br />
Prime Minister: ( cont.)<br />
been influenced by the activities of the New South Wales<br />
government by the conclusions and findings or opinions of<br />
Mr Finnane. There has been so much of it. How would you<br />
find people. How would you find a jury that has not been influenced.<br />
When you get somebody of Mr Ellicott's legal standing saying<br />
in a Parlimentary debate something of that kind, we can understand<br />
the seriousness of the situation that has been created, going<br />
far beyond the particular allegations in relation to Ian'Sinclair.<br />
It goes to something that is fundamental in our legal, judicial<br />
inspectorial situation, and one which the New South Wales<br />
government by'-its action to this point, has put injeopardy<br />
by the New South Wales government. It is the government that<br />
is on trial at the moment and Mr Wran will have to look very<br />
carefully at how he acts. It is not good for him to say<br />
that it is going to be Mr Walker's responsibility. Mr Wran will<br />
have to carry the can for this one.<br />
Question: Can I ask you about a State problem After meeting with the<br />
delegation this morning, how do you feel about setting up a<br />
commission of inquiry looking the disadvantages caused by<br />
airfares to and from Tasmania?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, of course, we did establish the Callaghan inquiry before<br />
which made a series of recommendations and we have made some<br />
very substantial decisions as a result of that particular<br />
inquiry. We have been given a submission by the Premier<br />
and by other people from this State. Peter Nixon responded<br />
briefly, explaining the current situation but he is going to<br />
examine that submission in detail as it is a lengthy document<br />
and he will be reporting the Commonwealth government in relation<br />
to it. I don't think I can say anything more than-that at the<br />
moment. You will. have to wait for that report from the Commonwealth<br />
and we will take it from there.<br />
Question: Can you comment on the situation with the Tasmanian College<br />
of Advanced Education closely down... ( inaudible). Is Senator<br />
Carrick looking at this, do you know?<br />
Mr* Newman:.<br />
I think that rests entirely with Mr Holgate.<br />
Question: Do you find it rather strange or hypocritical of the Tasmanian<br />
government on each occasion to come to Hobart to talk to the<br />
Premier who apparently said... ( inaudible). ./ 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I hope you don't put inverted commas around that word, ' apparently',<br />
he did no apparently about. There were a lot of people in the<br />
room and I took notes of it at the time, and here they are<br />
because I thought I would use them at the press conference.<br />
Question: I find it rather strange that... ( inaudible)..<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I hope no-ones suggests that that was a Dorothy Dix question<br />
because it wasn't.' Look, I find it very odd indeed because I<br />
have been here before, I have had a joint press conference<br />
on earlier occasions and Bruce Goodluck was present on<br />
that earlier occasion and. Michael Hodgman also was,' Ithink.<br />
Mr Lowe expresses these views about the policies we have<br />
introduced in relation to the State of Tasmania but then on<br />
other occasions for purposes that plainly served his election<br />
bill as he believed, he tried to say how terrible the policies<br />
of the Commonwealth were in relation to Tasmania.<br />
But the real answer to Mr Lowe's charges following that Premiers'<br />
conference come out of the State budget itself because State<br />
government 6xpenditure has increased significantly more than<br />
Commonwealth government expenditure. Where is the restraint in<br />
relation to that? If our budget had anything like the impact<br />
on this State that he claimed it was going to have, you would<br />
have thought that he would be really scrabbling to get an<br />
increase in expenditure of 3 or 4 percent. One would have thought<br />
that he would have had to had the most horrific increases in<br />
State charges and State taxes but that hasn' t occured. He has<br />
had an increase in expenditure of 10.. 8% as I am advised, and<br />
in some areas expenditure has gone up very greatly. There has<br />
some taxation relief,. lower land tax rate, estate's passing<br />
to children free from the State duties from January 1, and<br />
all of that belies the harshness of our treatment of Tasmania.<br />
It was in many ways, I would have thought, a fairly benign budget<br />
but it was one in which the State's growth of expenditure was<br />
significantly greater than the Commonwealth's growth of expenditure.<br />
That demonstrates very plainly that overall I have been<br />
more than fair in my dealings with the State of Tasmania, and<br />
I think that the State budget is a total repudiation of the campaign<br />
which Mr Lowe: initiated for his earlier election.<br />
Question: Given the fact, then, that the State's governments seem to vary<br />
on how the Federal government has treated Tasmania, why do you<br />
then feel today that you have had useful discussions with Mr Lowe?<br />
He might turn around and say something quite opposite the next day?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I suppose it is my charitable nature. I always hope that what is<br />
said in these sorts of discussions will prevail for a little while. </p>
<p>12<br />
Question: ( inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes, there was a useful discussion. What Mr Lowe-and Mr Batt<br />
said about the Callaghan report and our implementation of those<br />
policies, what they said about the Freight Equalisation scheme,<br />
I think these things were useful. On a range of other matters<br />
where there was an exchange of view I mentioned the question<br />
Of airfares, I have mentioned the Callaghan report. There was<br />
some discussion but it was not substa ntial in relation to what<br />
happens after the Empress of Australia. He expressed appreciation<br />
of the second Hobart bridge. He wanted some consultation between<br />
his * officials and ours on public houses in Tasmania. We are<br />
happy to have our officials come down and enter into those<br />
discussions and Ray Groom will be organising that and will be<br />
reporting to me and to the Commonwealth after the discussions<br />
have taken place. There was some discussion about the restoration<br />
of Port Arthur, international fishery negotiations and the<br />
point of view of Tasmania was taken into account but it was<br />
recognised that those negotiations are proceeding, they should<br />
be allowed to go through the normal processes. Then there was<br />
question of coastal surveillance and Peter Nixon pointed out<br />
that there had been some delay in the total overall approach<br />
because of the Commonwealth desire to use Australian designed<br />
and built aircraft, the Nomad. Now, I think that exchange of<br />
views on these particular matters was useful. I think it is<br />
useful to try and establish a good working relationship, which<br />
as Mr Lowe readily conceded, in relation to the<br />
Callaghan report, he has with Kevin Newman.<br />
Question:<br />
Are you suggesting that in none of those issues the State<br />
was at all critical of the Federal. Government?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It was not critical today, no. I'm not saying they have been<br />
asking for more, here or there. But, the whole tenor of the<br />
discussions was one of appreciation.<br />
Question: ( inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister:.<br />
No, cabinet has not looked at that. There are always interesting<br />
suggestions coming out of the State of Queensland. </p>
