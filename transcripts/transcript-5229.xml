INTERVIEW WITH PRESS AFGHANISTAN<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I will read through this first for those who want it on tape and<br />
sound.<br />
The Government today considered the report from the Foreign Minister<br />
concerning the events in Iran and more specifically the Russian<br />
invasion of Afghanistan.<br />
The Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister have already condemned<br />
the invasion of Afghanistan as totally without justification; as a<br />
violation of everything the United Nations stands for; and as a mode<br />
of behaviour which will make normal relationships between nations<br />
totally impossible.<br />
Soviet explanations of the Invasion have been rejected by the<br />
Government. The Government, along with many others, is conscious that its actions<br />
and decisions must be directed to seucring of circumstances where<br />
this kind of behaviour will not be repeated.<br />
The Russians have invaded Afghanistan. Now, collectively, the world<br />
needs to demonstrate that the price of that invasion is much higher<br />
than the Soviet envisaged and higher than they would be prepared to<br />
contemplate on future occasions.<br />
I made it plain this morning that it is not just a question of<br />
wanting the Russians out of Afghanistan but of establishing the<br />
circumstances in which this kind of action will not be repeated in<br />
the future.<br />
It is against that background that the Soviet Union needs to understan<br />
that the price of its actions in Afghanistan will be a heavy one<br />
indeed. There are inevitable limitations to the weight that a nation of 14<br />
million people can put-into the scales. Nevertheless we have taken<br />
a number-of decisions on" a broad front which are designed to<br />
demonstrate concern and to register the strongest possible opposition<br />
to the Soviet Union's actions.<br />
Some days ago at an earlier ireeti ng the Government made a decision<br />
and a consequent offer to the United States to consult with them<br />
concerning greater Australian involvement in patrolling and<br />
surveillance of the Indian Ocean. Much needs to be determined and<br />
options considered, but this could involve Australian participation<br />
with the United STates forces, or a greater independent effort by<br />
Australia to survey larger areas of the Indian Ocean.<br />
The United States has reciprocated warmly to that suggestion. It<br />
is not one made merely against the short term position that we are<br />
now confronting. It is one made against the background of changed<br />
strategic circumstances which will involve greater co-operation<br />
between Australia, her friends and allies.<br />
PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT </p>
<p>Andrew Peacock and myself have on many occasions indicated in the<br />
past that our objective in the Indian Ocean was to achieve balance<br />
at the lowest possible level. Those remarks and comments were<br />
made in happier days. We now look to different circumstances.<br />
-Australia will, support United States action in relation to wheat<br />
sales to the Soviet Union. We will not pick up any of the short<br />
fall created by that decision and will urge other wheat exporting<br />
nations to take a similar view. Consistent with United States<br />
actions normal sales to the Soviet Union will not be affected.<br />
-We will be putting to the United States at a meeting being held<br />
in Washington on Saturday that the 17 million tonnes shortfall<br />
resulting from President Carter's decision, should be handled in<br />
such a way that the international market in wheat is not prejudiced<br />
-Any discussions or arrangements or agreements over fisheries<br />
matters are indefinitely suspended. This has particular applicatio,<br />
for two projects: a joint feasibility fishing venture of f the North,<br />
West Shelf of the Western Australian coast; and a feasibility<br />
fishing project involving jack mackerel in waters adjacent to<br />
Tasmania. Any approvals previously given in relation to these fisheries<br />
projects are henceforth withdrawn.<br />
-USSR Liner Shipping services at present operate to and from<br />
Australia in conference trades ( Australia to Europe Shipping<br />
Conference) and in non-conference trades ( Australia to Europe, and<br />
the triangular service East Asia/ Japan, USA and Australia).<br />
Russian bulk shipping also carries primary produce bought by Russia,<br />
from Australia.<br />
These shipping-operations and other facilities provided by Australi<br />
are currently being reviewed.<br />
-There will be no further approvals for scientific research vessels<br />
to visit our ports.<br />
-The visit of the-Soviet Fisheries Delegation in February will not<br />
be permitted into Australia.<br />
We will not meet the Soviet request to station Aeroflot personnel<br />
in Australia to facilitate the Russian Airline's services going<br />
through Australia to other countries.<br />
-In addition we are not prepared to consider their requests for<br />
direct Soviet/ Australia air flights.<br />
-Scientific collaboration with the Soviet Union is indefinitely<br />
suspended.<br />
-official talks and visits between Australia and the Soviet Union<br />
are also indefinitely suspended.<br />
-No new programs under the Cultural Program will be entered into.<br />
-A number of countries have made statements concerning the Olympic<br />
Games. Many, including Australia, would prefer, as a result of<br />
recent events, that the Games were not being held in Moscow.<br />
The Games are, however, an international event. They are not a </p>
<p>Russian event and should be seen in that context.<br />
Any decision on this matter is therefore of a different kind to<br />
decisions affecting bilateral relationships between Australia and<br />
the Soviet Union. The Government will, therefore, be closely<br />
examining these wider aspects and assessing the views of a<br />
number of other countries.<br />
In addition to these measures, the Government will be embarking on<br />
a wide range of consultations with other countries.<br />
And finally what has happened in Afghanistan has demonstrated that<br />
the fears and concerns expressed in my Statement on Foreign Policy<br />
in June 1976, and repeated on other occasions by the Foreign minister<br />
have been only too realistic.<br />
Question Prime Minister will our Ambassador be returning-to Moscow ( inaud.)?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
He will be returning.<br />
Question Has there no thought been given to withdrawing him?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We believe that it is important to be able to maintain communications,<br />
to talk between governments. To shut off that kind of communication<br />
is very much a final and last resort measure. We believe it makes<br />
sense for diplomatic communication to be able to continue.<br />
Question Prime Minister why isn't Australia stopping its wheat sales to Russiaits<br />
beef sales, its wool sale All you say here is consistent with<br />
United States actions. What is your reason for not taking actions<br />
on these .( inaudr)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Because what we have done is consistent with the United States actions.<br />
Nobody has suggested that total commercial trade with the Soviet Union<br />
should be ended. The Government did not judge that that step should<br />
be taken.<br />
Question But w hy Prime Minister?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Because we judged it so.<br />
Question But what are the reasons behind the judgment?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It's a matter of judgment that the commercial sales of a normal kind </p>
<p>Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
ought to continue. Most other countries I think are taking a similar<br />
view. High technology trade is being suspended between the United<br />
States and I think Britain and the Soviet Union. But on the other<br />
hand that's an area where Australia is not really involved. Even in<br />
relation to Iran, where trade boycotts have been considered, only<br />
considered at this point, the general consensus has been that food<br />
trade should be exempt from any sanctions that might one day unfold.<br />
Question Sir that's a humanitarian reason.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Has anyone else got a question.<br />
Question Were there disparate voices in Cabinet, some individuals or groups<br />
pushing for a further cut in agricultural exports and other groups<br />
advocating what you decided..<br />
Prime Minister<br />
1\ nat's been decided was a total view of Cabinet. It would be<br />
quite odd to give the views of individual ministers in Cabinet. But<br />
let me only say on a wide range of these issues there was a remarkable<br />
degree of unanimity on the kind of view that the Government ought to<br />
take. Question Prime Minister in realistic terms how effective do you think this can<br />
be? ( inaud.)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I drew attention to-the fact that the weight of 14 million people put<br />
into the scales is necessarily limited. That remains so. But it is<br />
immensely important that countries such as the United States and<br />
Britain should not be left to carry this kind of burden alone to<br />
know that they do have friends, that they do have allies, that are<br />
prepared to take what decisions they can in support of a general<br />
position that's important for the free world.<br />
Question Prime Minister if the US decided t o boycott the Olympic Games in<br />
Moscow would you follow their lead?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well they haven't yet made that decision. We'll be keeping in close<br />
touch with a number of governments in relation to the Olympic Gamnes.<br />
I don't want to go beyond the remarks in the statement at this point. </p>
<p>Question Prime Minister what's your response to the Chinese initiative to draw<br />
together countries to form some kind of alliance against the Soviet<br />
Union? Prime Minister<br />
I haven't had an analysis of that. I've seen a newspaper report and<br />
I'd like to look more closely at what China has in fact proposed.<br />
Question Would it be something along those lines something you would favouran<br />
alliance?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I'd like to understand what China has proposed because up to this<br />
point it's been China's policy not to involve itself in foreign<br />
military alliances of different kinds. At the moment the report I<br />
have comes from the Melbourne Herald. ( That's not saying anything<br />
particular about the Melbourne Herald except it's the only report I<br />
have on that subject).<br />
Question Prime Minister you suggested that shipping services will be reduced.<br />
Does that include cruise ships operating?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes. Question Prime Minister at what level and when will the consultations take<br />
place with the United States~ about our further-involvement in the<br />
Indian Ocean?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well they have been very much preoccupied. As the statement<br />
points out, that's not just a proposal that is put against the<br />
immediate background, immediate circumstance. It's designed as a long<br />
term proposal which we believe could be useful in terms of broad<br />
co-operation in security and strategic mnftters. So I think the timing is<br />
really dependent upon the United States getting their decks cleared<br />
of the pressing current issues and-that we stand ready to participate<br />
in the talks whenever they are ready.<br />
Question On the joint Tasmanian fishing venture, it says approval will be<br />
withdrawn. Does that mean forever?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Under present circumstances. Forever is a very long while. </p>
<p>Question ( inaud.)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There are many countries that have been approaching us for access to<br />
Australian fisheries and obviously in the months ahead our fisheries<br />
arrangements won't stand still. We would be seeing what other<br />
countries are prepared to offer, what other countries are prepared to<br />
do. Question<br />
You miention that we ' re -going to have greater Australian involverrent in<br />
controlling the balance of the Indian Ocean. Can you give us any<br />
details of how that involvement will be greater or will ( inaud)<br />
or will we put ships into the area or...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well these are the kind of things that we need to talk to the United<br />
States about. We're willing, we're prepared to make a greater effort<br />
and it will then be a question of how that determination can best be<br />
fitted into a total overall approach.<br />
Question You don't think we should make that greater effort unilaterally?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes but you'll get the best advantage from it if it's integrated with<br />
what our friends and allies are also doing.<br />
Question Do you envisage . a large or dramatic increase in Government expenditure<br />
on defence capabilities?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Defence expenditure has been rising in real terms. We've made<br />
decisions which involve further increases in real terms.<br />
Question Do you expect it to go beyond thos'e decisions and increase it even<br />
more than you have in the past?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Financial guidance that has been given to Defence in recent times<br />
does involve a capacity, and within the financial guidance, for<br />
making additional equipment decisions, additional material decisions.<br />
Those matters aren't at the moment before Cabinet and obviously I<br />
don't want to preempt that. But I'm just making the point that the<br />
financial guidance that has been given does have within it room for<br />
additional material decisions to those that have already been<br />
announced. </p>
<p>Question Was the Minister for Defence at today's Cabinet meeting?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
He's on leave. He was fully represented by an acting Minister.<br />
I spoke to him before the meeting. We had an exchange of views.<br />
Question In the Government's view Sir, does the sum of these decisions you<br />
have just announced, is it going to cost Australia very much either<br />
economically or diplomatically?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It will cost Australia economically in a number of ways. I think it's<br />
difficult to put a firm figure on that but it will obviously cost<br />
in a number of ways. To the extent that there is a cost it should be<br />
one that's a community rather than directed at individual areas or<br />
sectors, quite plainly. And in diplomatic terms I believe the cost<br />
to us in diplomatic terms, in international and strategic terms will<br />
be infinitely greater if we were not prepared to make this kind of<br />
decision. Cost who with? Cost with your friends or cost with the<br />
Soviet Union? There will be a cost in terms of relationships with<br />
the Soviet Union. But in a sense that's already occurred. The kinds<br />
of arguments and views that were put by the Soviet Ambassador to<br />
myself and to the Foreign Minister again yesterday and the kind of<br />
response that that attracted that in itself will involve some change,<br />
at least in the atmospherics of relationships between the Soviet Union<br />
and Australia. So there is a cost there. But it's a necessary one<br />
and the advantages in other ways of doing what Australia can to stand<br />
for something, to seek to look to the future the advantages in<br />
taking action on that count are very real.<br />
