    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government and the Tasmanian Government today announced that Tasmania will be the launch state for the Commonwealth's new super fast National Broadband Network.</p>
<p>This new National Broadband Network will begin rolling out in Tasmania as early as July 2009, before a full national roll-out in early 2010.</p>
<p>The Tasmanian Government, in conjunction with Aurora Energy, will construct a fibre to the premise network which will deliver speeds of 100 Megabits per second, connecting over 200,000 Tasmanian households and businesses.</p>
<p>The FTTP network will also extend to all hospitals and almost 90 per cent of schools.</p>
<p>The Tasmanian Government will construct a wireless network and the Australian Government's National Broadband Network satellite solution will service the remainder of the state with speeds of 12 Mbps or more.</p>
<p>This announcement means Tasmanians will begin benefiting from broadband speeds up to 100 times faster than currently available within a matter of months.</p>
<p>Tasmania currently has the lowest proportion of households with broadband of any state or territory  -  39 per cent compared with the Australian average of 52 per cent.</p>
<p>Tasmanians will also be the first beneficiaries of hundreds of local jobs that will be created during the 5-year life of the project.</p>
<p>This nation building network will be the most significant infrastructure project in Tasmania's history.</p>
<p>It is another example of the Rudd Government investing in nation building infrastructure in order to support local jobs in communities across Tasmania.</p>
<p>The decision to launch the National Broadband Network in Tasmania was based on the advice of the Government's independent Expert Panel.</p>
<p>Given the long standing disadvantages faced by Tasmanians in accessing high speed broadband, the Australian Government happily accepted this advice.</p>
<p>Last year, the Tasmanian Government submitted a proposal under the Request for Proposal (RFP) process to roll out a National Broadband Network. The Tasmanian proposal combined use of fibre to the home and workplace and high speed wireless services.</p>
<p>Although the RFP process has been terminated, the Panel of Experts encouraged further negotiation with the Tasmanian Government.</p>
<p>The Australian Consumer and Competition Commission also noted that the Tasmanian proposal raised no issues from a competition perspective.</p>
<p>As a result of this advice, the Australian and Tasmanian Governments have entered into negotiations with the Tasmanian Government to progress the roll-out of fast broadband as part of the enhanced National Broadband Network.</p>
<p>The Australian Government's commitment to Tasmania is an early demonstration of its plan to support the deployment of new high speed broadband infrastructure nationally.</p>
<p>The rollout of superfast broadband in Tasmania will revolutionise its economy and dramatically improve the lives of all Tasmanians.</p>
