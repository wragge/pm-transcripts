FOR MEDIA 3 JULY 1990<br />
It is a long established and important principle in our<br />
system of Government that public servants, particularly<br />
those at senior levels directly advising on policy or<br />
directly administering Government policy, should refrain<br />
from public criticism of Government policy.<br />
In the light of the comments attributed to Dr David Charles,<br />
former Secretary of the Department of Industry, Technology<br />
and Commerce, in yesterday's Australian Financial Review, I<br />
have now considered a report from the Secretary of my<br />
Department. I have also been able to examine the transcript of the<br />
interview given on the record by Dr Charles, and have had a<br />
discussion directly with him.<br />
It is clear from that consideration, and from my discussion<br />
with Dr Charles, that major elements of the interview given<br />
by Dr Charles were accurately reported by the Australian<br />
Financial Review.<br />
It is also clear that this interview represents a<br />
fundamental breach of the principle referred to earlier.<br />
Dr Charles himself accepts that this was a fundamental<br />
breach and deeply regrets it.<br />
In normal circumstances, this would warrant disciplinary<br />
action well beyond the reprimand already given and I have<br />
accordingly seriously considered revoking his appointment as<br />
Consul-General in Berlin.<br />
I am conscious of the extremely able and dedicated service<br />
previously given to this Government and earlier Governments<br />
by Dr Charles without blemish.<br />
There are private circumstances, however, which I find<br />
compelling and which have led me to decide to take no<br />
further action beyond the reprimand given. </p>
