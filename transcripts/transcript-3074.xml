PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 148<br />
COLOUR TELEVISION 19 November 1973<br />
One of the first acts of the present Australian<br />
Government was to request the Tariff Board to thoroughly<br />
review the electronic industry as a prelude to the<br />
introduction of colour television in Australia. It took<br />
this action on December 7, just 5 days after assuming<br />
office. The Liberal Government had failed to take any<br />
action on this matter. The Board has now reported and<br />
the Government has made its decision after consideration<br />
of that report. As a result, Australians will now have<br />
to pay considerably less for colour TV sets than would<br />
have been the case under a Liberal Government.<br />
The Government has accepted the basic thrust of<br />
the Tariff Board Report on Consumer Electronic Equipment<br />
and Components which recommends that the existing tariff<br />
rates for these goods be reduced significantly. This will<br />
provide the Australian consumer with a wider range of<br />
cheaper electronic consumer goods, including colour<br />
television sets. It will also' provide a basis for greater<br />
specialisation in the relevant sections of the Australian<br />
industry, with consequent benefits for the nation as a<br />
whole. The Government has decided not to accept the<br />
precise recommendations of the Tariff Board in respect of<br />
the rate of duty which would apply. Subject to international<br />
commitments the new rates will be 35%. The Board had<br />
recommended 25% on most imported electronic components,<br />
on imported made-up appliances, including monochrome<br />
and colour TV receivers, radios, radiograms, record players<br />
and the like. The old rates of duty were 33.75% plus<br />
$ 37.50' on TV receivers,* 33., 75% plus $ 7.50 on radio<br />
receivers and 33.75% plus various specific rates on<br />
components. The adoption of the new duty rates will result<br />
in colour TV receivers retailing for at least $ 150 less<br />
than under the tariff pr~ oposals put forward by the<br />
manufacturers. In order to ensure that the benefits of<br />
the new duty rates are passed on to consumers, prices of<br />
colour TV receivers and other electronic consumer goods<br />
will be kept under close review and action considered as<br />
appropriate to ensure that margins and prices are justifiable. / 12 </p>

In supporting its recommendations for a lower<br />
rate of duty than has been accepted, the Board stated<br />
that the level of employment in the industry would be at<br />
least maintained, although a substantial number of persons<br />
would change their employment. Factors contributing to<br />
this arc the current world shortage of components, the<br />
fact that the area of reduced protection is confined to<br />
the consumer electronic products industry and the buoyant<br />
economic conditions presently enjoyed. Under the<br />
Government's decision the employment effects of the<br />
reduction in protection are likely to be less than under<br />
the Tariff Board's proposals. Nevertheless, the Government<br />
has asked Departments to direct their attention to the<br />
likely future situation in regard to employment in South<br />
Australia, which has a narrower range of production than<br />
New South Wales and Victoria, the other States mainly<br />
involved in the electronics industry.<br />
The Cabinet will introduce appropriate subsidy<br />
assistance to maintain, at least until the Tariff Board<br />
report on professional electronic equipment is considered<br />
by the Government, the production in Australia of selected<br />
electronic components which are or could be important for<br />
their defence, telecommunications or technological<br />
significance, e. g.<br />
integrated circuits<br />
discrete semi-conductors<br />
crystals transmitting valves<br />
certain types of capacitors,<br />
special purpose transducers derived from<br />
ceramic capacitors,<br />
certain types of resistors, and<br />
transformers, as used in. electronic equipment.<br />
The precise list of components which might be covered by<br />
such assistance will be determined by the Government after<br />
further consideration of defence, telecommunications and<br />
technological aspects. Advice would be sought from<br />
appropriate Departments and technical authorities, e. g.<br />
Universities and/ or consultants. The nature and extent of<br />
any subsidy assistance would be subject to appropriate<br />
rationalisation and restructuring being undertaken by<br />
the industry in consultation with Government. The details<br />
of this assistance will be determined and announced before<br />
the end of June 1974. The future of the subsidy assistance<br />
introduced will be reviewed at the time of consideration<br />
of the Tariff Board's report on professional electronic<br />
equipment. ./ 3 </p>
<p>Finally, Cabinet has decided that assistance will<br />
be made available to firms and employees harmed by the<br />
proposed tariff changes. Details of assistance and<br />
eligibility will be announced after the completion of the<br />
Government's general consideration of adjustment assistance<br />
principles. If necessary, interim assistance arrangements<br />
will be implemented. The new duties will operate on and from<br />
November 1973. </p>
