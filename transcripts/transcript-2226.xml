PRESS GOÃ± IFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
M R J OHIN GORTON IN TOKYO, JAPAN., 7 MAY 1970<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, did you have any substantive talks<br />
yesterday with Mvr Sato about Cambodia? Could you tell us how<br />
close are Australian and Japanese attitude s to the Cambodian<br />
issue and America'is recent actions there?<br />
PM: Yes, we did have some discussion on the Cambodian<br />
situation which has of course been caused initially by the North<br />
Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia's neutrality. I think we are<br />
very close together in that both our countries, as I understand<br />
it, have as their desire a really neutral Cambodia one which is<br />
genuinely neutral, one which is not occupied by any other for-ces<br />
and one, which, as a result of some kind of international<br />
inspection, can be seen to remain neutral. On the question of<br />
America's recent reaction, our own Australian attitude I think has<br />
been made perfectly clear.<br />
Q. I understand that very recently your Minister for<br />
Development, Mr Swartz, has told your Parliament that Australia<br />
is considering the possibility of offering weapons to Cambodia.<br />
Has Australia indeed offered weapons or decided to provide<br />
weapons assistance to Cambodia?<br />
PM: This is a matter which is not dealt with by the Minister<br />
for National Development in fact, but by the Minister for External<br />
Affairs and the Government. There was a request as I understand<br />
it for some kind of assistance from the Cambodian forces but the<br />
Government has reached no decision on this as yet.<br />
Q. What do you expect the Djakarta Conferenace to accomplish?<br />
PM: L I think that the question is one which is rather a difficult<br />
one to answer since I am asked what I expect an international<br />
conference to accomplish. I can answer what I hope it would<br />
accomplish and what I think it has a chance of acE-inplishing.<br />
And that is I would hope for an expression of opinion by a number<br />
of powers in the Asian area that a truly neutral Cam~ bodia would be<br />
a step towards genuine peace, and that it would be in the interest<br />
of the peoples of the world if the North Vietnamese, the Viet Cong<br />
all those the South Vietnamese all those who are now in Cambodia,<br />
all were to withdraw and to allow a truly neutral Cambodia. As<br />
I said in our own House of Parliament, one means by that that<br />
one hopes for a truly, genuinely neutral Cambodia, not one which<br />
is called neutral, but occupied in whole or in part by North<br />
Vietnamese forces. 2 </p>
<p>Q. I would like to ask you a question in Connection with the<br />
planned British troop withdrawal from east of Suez and the question<br />
of security in Asia. After the British withdrawal, what kind of<br />
role would you expect Japan to perform i~ n the interests of security<br />
in this region of the world? Precisely, do you expect japan to make<br />
any direct contribution to the defence and security of this area?<br />
PM: t Well, it is not for me to come to Japan and state what one<br />
thinks Japan should do, and I understand that was the question.<br />
What is likely to happen, although it depends to some extent onl the<br />
result of the next election in Great Britain, is that there will be<br />
a withdrawal of British forces, as is known,. But this does not<br />
mean that there will not be a capacity and a willingness to bring<br />
British forces back should a crisis develop, This is not something<br />
which, as far ar I know, has been worked out in the detail of the<br />
number of forces, but there will be a withdrawal and a capacity and<br />
a willingness in certain circumstances to bring British forces back.<br />
For our own part, we are maintaining in the area elements of an<br />
air force, some ground troops and some naval support which we<br />
hope will contribute to the s tability of the area. It is not for me to<br />
comment on Japan what Japan might wish to do and I don't propose<br />
to do that.<br />
Q. Sir, do you believe that Prince Sihanouk, in the present<br />
circumstances, is able to achieve the genuine neutrality that you<br />
spoke of, and if he isn't, do you think the Lon Nol Government itself<br />
can do it?<br />
PM: The present Lon Nol Government is the government which<br />
is the-government of Cambvtdia, and I would hope that the discussions<br />
in Djakarta might make it clear that a genuine neutrality i~ s desired<br />
for Cambodia, and that as a result of that genuine neutrality, all<br />
foreign forces would be removed from that country. If that genuine<br />
neutrality were in fact achieved, then surely i~ t would be a matter for<br />
the Cambodians to decide which government then ran that country<br />
in that kind of neutrality. But I should make it clear that as far as<br />
Australia is concerned, the Lon Nol Government is the government<br />
with which Australia is dealing.<br />
Q. When you said you would hope P. 2 foreign troops will be<br />
withdrawn from Cambi-dia, do you mean, Sir, simultaneous withdrawal<br />
of US troops, North Vietnamese troops, and Viet Cong troops, all<br />
of them together, at the same time simultanleously? Do you<br />
contemplate Australia will make this request at the Djakarta<br />
conference? ,3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
PM: I wouldn't want to anticipatc the precise form that the<br />
Djakarta Conference would follow, but I believe that the objective<br />
that would be sought would be a Cambodia which was neutral and<br />
in which there were not troops from other countries any other<br />
countries. And therefore, a Cambodia which did in fact have that<br />
neutrality which was guaranteed to it under thle Geneva Agreements<br />
but which was violated by the North Vietnamese actions. The<br />
only way in which that neutrality can be a reality is if there are<br />
no foreign troops in Cambodia. This would be the objec-tive.<br />
just exactly how that objective would be attained must obviously<br />
be a matter for the conference. But I cannot myself see it being<br />
attained if the suggestion is that all troops other than North<br />
Vietnamese troops should be withirawn.<br />
Q. Sir, you said that you might like to see some ind of<br />
international inspection body checking the n eutrality of Cambodia.<br />
What kind of international inspection body something from the UN<br />
or some other kind of organisation?<br />
PM: I understand that the Lon Nol Government itself has<br />
suggested that the International Control Commission the ICC<br />
might be re-established. There have been some comments on that<br />
from the Canadian spokesman, I believe myself that as long as<br />
there is an effective international method of inspection, and I<br />
emphasise an effective international method of inspection, it is<br />
not of terrific importance j ust how that international inspection<br />
is arrived at or made up. Perhaps it might be something which was<br />
put in by the United Nations. But the composition the actual<br />
arrangements for such an international inspection are, I would<br />
have thought, less important than the end result of having an<br />
effective international inspection. Perhaps I might add perhaps<br />
I should have said, effective and impartial.<br />
Q. Sir, both India and Pakistan have declined to take part in<br />
the Djakarta conference. Do you have any comments to make on<br />
that?<br />
PM: Only that I believe that taking part in conferences of this<br />
kind is a matter to be decided by the Governments concerned.<br />
If the Government of India and the Government of Pakistan have<br />
decided that they don't wish to take part in it, that is their decision<br />
to make and that is the comment that 1. would make upon it. ./ 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
Q. Sir, in your talks with Mr Sato yesterday, did you reach<br />
an agreement with him that you would support the ICC as the<br />
international inspection body, or did MVr Sato agree that he would<br />
support an Australian proposition of this kind?<br />
PM: The talks with Mr Sato didn't go into detail of that kind at<br />
all. A large part of the talks that we had were engaged with relations<br />
between our own two countries in fields of trade and in fields of<br />
cultural relations. This indeed took up most of the time, quite<br />
contrary to what has taken up most of the time of this press conference.<br />
But on the question of Cambodia the question that you asked me<br />
what we did agree on was that we would like to see a genuinely<br />
neutral Cambodia. We didn't go into the sort of details of which<br />
you have spoken.<br />
Q. To get away from Carntbadia, could you elaborate on j ust<br />
what you did discuss on the matter of trade was there a complaint<br />
from Mr Sato?<br />
PM. No there was no complaint by Mr Sato. We were glad,<br />
both of us, that trade relations had grown in the way in which they<br />
have. As you know, Japan is our best customer now, and we, I think,<br />
are Japan's third best customer. There was the problem which I<br />
raised of the very low price for wool which is bei n g paid at the<br />
moment not paid by Japan as a result of negotiation this is not<br />
a niatter of any complaint, but I pointed out that the auction system<br />
had led to a price for wool which was disastrous as far as Australian<br />
woolgrowers were concerned. I did notice in one of the newspapers<br />
this morning that this was reported as me asking for Japan to buy<br />
more wool. This was not strictly accurate. What I was suggesting<br />
was that the price for the wool that was bought might, to the ultimate<br />
advantage of both our countries, be made higher. I pointed this out<br />
as a difficult that Australia suffered. There are many other countries<br />
that buy our wool, but Japan buyy more than others.<br />
Q. To cntrry this Cambodian thing out of the repetitive realm,<br />
assuming that the North Vietnamese troops in Cambodia do not<br />
withdraw, and assuming that the American troops somehow get<br />
bogged down, does your Government have a policy with respect to the<br />
indefinite continuation of hostilities inside Cambodia? </p>
<p>PM: Both my Government and myself have a policy of not<br />
answering hypothetical questions based on assumptions which<br />
have no basis.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, when you were referring to wool a<br />
moment ago, can you tell us if you put to the Japanese Prime<br />
Minister any concrete way in which this disastrously low wool<br />
price position could be overcome? Did you tell him that your<br />
Government intends to suspend or do away with the auction system<br />
which has created this?<br />
, PM: No, Mr Barnes, I didn't do that. The object of what I<br />
had to say was to make it clear to the Japanese Prime Minister that<br />
this was a matter of very great concern to Australia and of<br />
great concern to our economy. And that we believed that it would<br />
be necessary to find some way to remedy that situation, and to<br />
indicate to him that this should be the subject of continuing<br />
discussicas between the two Governments and between businessmen<br />
in Japan and the people concerned with the selling of wool in<br />
Australia. I believe that this message that it was something which<br />
really did need to be worked out and discussed between our<br />
Governments was accepted by the Prime Minister and I am<br />
hopeful that the discussions which I suggested will, as a resu lt,<br />
take place. Perhaps they would have taken place anyway, but<br />
I think they will now take place and I think that the Government<br />
of Japan does know of our genuine concern. That was the object<br />
of raising this matter not to try and work out at that level the<br />
detailed remedy. </p>
