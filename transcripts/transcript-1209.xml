STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR ROBERT MENZIES, M. P.,<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, TUESDAY 7TH DECEMBER, 1965.<br />
DROUGHT ASSISTANCE<br />
In reply to a question by the Honourable Member for<br />
Bendigo on 30th November I said that I hoped to be in a position<br />
shortly to let the House know of the results of the Commonwealth<br />
Government's consideration of recent approaches we have had from<br />
the States of New South Wales and Queensland for financial<br />
assistance to enable them to undertake additional relief measures<br />
for primary producers who are suffering because of the present<br />
unfortunate drought in those States. The Premier of New South<br />
Wales and the Premier of Queensland both wrote to me on 26th<br />
November advising me of relief measures in those States.<br />
I had previously advised both of the Premiers that they<br />
could take it that Commonwealth financial assistance would cover<br />
whatever deficit they ultimately might have in their budgets as a<br />
result of drought measures that might be taken. Both Premiers have<br />
instituted schemes to help relieve the situation. In both States<br />
there are schemes of concessional loans of up to Å 3,000 for<br />
essential carry-on purposes for drought affected primary producers<br />
who are in necessitous circumstances and are unable to finance<br />
their essential carry-on requirements from their own resources<br />
or through ordinary commercial channels. These loans will be<br />
at 3% interest per annum and advances are repayable over<br />
a maximum period of seven years with repayment of interest<br />
and principal deferred for the first two years. In addition,<br />
the States have instituted other schemes which include such<br />
; measures as advances through the banks for fodder purchases,<br />
grants to local councils for special purposes associated with<br />
drought problems in particular areas, local unemployment relief<br />
work and rebate and subsidy schemes for the carriage of fodder<br />
and stock by road and rail. </p>
<p>I can now inform the House that the Premiers have been<br />
advised that the additional measures will come within the scope<br />
of the Commonwealth's undertaking to provide financial<br />
assistance in respect of the cost to their States of drought<br />
relief measures. I have also informed the Premier of Queensland that<br />
the Commonwealth agrees to a request his State has made for an<br />
immediate interim advance of Å 1million to Queensland on account<br />
of drought costs. The request was made in accordance with a<br />
previous assurance by the Commonwealth Government that it would be<br />
prepared to consider making interim payments if the States so<br />
desired. The Premier of New South Wales had previously told me<br />
that he considers that it would be preferable for his State to<br />
wait until the results of the first half of the financial year are<br />
available before making formal application for an interim payment.<br />
As I have said previously, the Commonwealth's undertaking<br />
to provide financial assistance to the two States in respect of<br />
the cost of their drought relief measures is unprecedentedly<br />
generous. The additional relief measures now being taken by the<br />
two States will, I am sure, be of great assistance in enabling<br />
drought affected primary producers in necessitous circumstances<br />
to carry on. </p>
