PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
REALISING THE POTENTIAL: A WORKSHOP ON WOMEN<br />
AND AWARD RESTRUCTURING<br />
CANBERRA 6 JULY 1989<br />
It gives me great pleasure to be opening this important<br />
workshop on women and award restructuring.<br />
I say it is important and I think I am as qualified as<br />
anyone to define just how important is this workshop and the<br />
subject with which it deals.<br />
As advocate and later as President of the ACTU, I was<br />
proudly and actively involved in the struggle of the labour<br />
movement and the women's movement for equal pay.<br />
As Prime Minister I have had the satisfaction of seeing the<br />
implementation of legislation such as the Affirmative Action<br />
and Sex Discrimination Acts.<br />
on the basis of those experiences, I assert that with the<br />
process of award restructuring, women workers stand on the<br />
verge of a new era of industrial progress that will be at<br />
least the equal of those earlier landmarks in their struggle<br />
for industrial and economic rights.<br />
Award restructuring offers gains of enormous significance to<br />
all members of the workforce, to their employers, and to the<br />
economy generally.<br />
Specifically, award restructuring offers the potential to<br />
transform the role of women in the workforce.<br />
So it is very proper that this workshop should be called<br />
' Realising the Potential'.<br />
The workshop will provide a forum for exchanging information<br />
that will help all of us to realise the full potential award<br />
restructuring provides for improving the position of working<br />
women. And it will allow us to develop further strategies to<br />
achieve a better deal for women. </p>
<p>Of course this potential could not be realised today were it<br />
not for the solid foundations, built in previous decades, on<br />
which women's participation in the workforce is based.<br />
In 1968, when as ACTU advocate I was presenting an Equal Pay<br />
Case before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on<br />
behalf of the Meat Industry Employees Union, I made a point<br />
that is still valid today.<br />
I observed that differences in the wages paid to men and<br />
women were simply outmoded relics of assumptions and<br />
conceptions dating from the beginning of the twentieth<br />
century. The historic 1972 Equal Pay Case granting ' equal pay for<br />
work of equal value' was the successful culmination of that<br />
long equal pay struggle.<br />
Its impact is measur ed by the fact that by the end of the<br />
1980s women are earning almost 80 per cent of the average<br />
full-time male earner, compared to less than 60 per cent in<br />
the 1960s.<br />
The significance of that achievement is of course increased<br />
by the fact that since we came to office in 1983 there has<br />
been an enormous increase in the number of jobs available to<br />
women. Of the one and a half million jobs created under my<br />
government since April 1983, almost 55 per cent have been<br />
taken up by women.<br />
women's labour force participation rate is now consistently<br />
above 50 per cent, an historic high.<br />
we have enacted three major pieces of legislation for<br />
affirmative action and equal opportunity programs in the<br />
private and public sectors, giving women greater freedom<br />
from discrimination in employment.<br />
The Affirmative Action Act, in particular, helps lay the<br />
groundwork for award restructuring, in requiring<br />
consultation with women, and review of areas such as<br />
opportunities for promotion, training development and<br />
conditions of service.<br />
Nor have we been content with creating jobs and combating<br />
discrimination within the workplace. We have also placed a<br />
very heavy emphasis on opening the doors that might<br />
otherwise prevent women from taking up the job opportunities<br />
that are available.<br />
Two examples are particularly striking: child care and<br />
education. obviously, access to quality and affordable child care is<br />
essential to women's workforce participation. </p>
<p>During my Presidency of the ACTU, maternity and adoption<br />
leave for women workers was achieved. This has assisted<br />
women to combine family responsibilities with workforce<br />
participation. Now, in Government, we are massively expanding the provision<br />
of child care. In the last Budget, we announced the<br />
provision of 30,000 new child care places over four years,<br />
which will by 1992 bring to 98,000 the number of new<br />
Government-funded places a trebling of places since we<br />
took office.<br />
We also support the ACTU's test case on Parental Leave which<br />
is due to come before the Industrial Relations Commission<br />
shortly. we believe it makes good sense for family<br />
responsibilities to be shared between parents.<br />
In the field of education, our achievement is nothing less<br />
than ensuring that Australian school kids girls as well as<br />
boys increasingly are getting the start they need to a<br />
satisfactory career.<br />
It seems appalling that only a few years ago, in 1982, only<br />
one in three Australian school children was staying on to<br />
complete Year 12.<br />
Now, more than half are finishing Year 12 and by the early<br />
1990s, about two thirds will be doing so. In so doing, they<br />
will be getting the best possible start to a working life.<br />
Further, we are encouraging girls and women to enrol in<br />
maths, science and technical subjects and courses.<br />
The National Policy for the Education of Girls is a key<br />
element in that strategy. It emphasises the co-operation of<br />
all those involved in the provision of education the<br />
Commonwealth, States, and private systems in improving the<br />
quality of girls, education.<br />
So through greater access to better education and training,<br />
and through appropriate support services such as child care,<br />
my Government is enabling women to compete more strongly in<br />
the labour market.<br />
The Government is making it clear: we want women to have<br />
every opportunity to enter the workforce, and we value their<br />
aspirations for economic independence and security.<br />
I have briefly sketched these landmarks in the achievements<br />
of working women not to create any sense of self<br />
congratulation or complacency in this audience but to<br />
highlight the potential of the logical next step: award<br />
restructuring.<br />
Award restructuring holds the promise of a fairer labour<br />
market in which women can attain further wage justice and<br />
can further strengthen their labour market position. </p>
<p>It sets the scene for recognising women's skills and<br />
rewarding them appropriately, and for offering women not<br />
just jobs, but careers. It holds the promise of a labour<br />
market in which the terms and conditions of employment do<br />
not obstruct women's labour market choices.<br />
Women deserve equal access to the skills, training and<br />
remuneration available to men.<br />
Award restructuring can not only remove award provisions<br />
that are directly discriminatory, but develop positive<br />
measures which encourage and expand women's employment<br />
opportunities. Progress hinges on the goodwill and good sense of both<br />
employers and unions, and I feel confident that they are<br />
already demonstrating the willingness to tackle issues of<br />
discrimination in women's employment.<br />
Without widespread commitment to genuine workplace reform,<br />
the gains will not be forthcoming.<br />
We, as a nation, will have lost a valuable opportunity to<br />
enhance the nation's economic efficiency, and the working<br />
lives, careers, employment opportunities and earnings of<br />
Australian women will be constrained.<br />
For the next two days you have the opportunity to deliberate<br />
on how award restructuring can be used to best effect to<br />
improve the position of women in the labour market. I<br />
congratulate those who have organised this workshop, I wish<br />
you well in your discussions and I look forward to hearing<br />
your timely and practical advice. </p>
