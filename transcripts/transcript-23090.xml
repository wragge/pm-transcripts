    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government will provide a further $20 million and deploy additional Australian Defence Force logistic support to help the Philippines to respond to Typhoon Haiyan, bringing total Australian assistance to over $30 million.</p>
<p>As a good friend and neighbour, Australia stands beside the Philippines as it deals with this humanitarian disaster.</p>
<p>The additional funds will be used to address serious nutrition, child health and protection needs, purchase emergency foods and provide logistic support and non-food items.</p>
<p>Two Royal Australian Air Force aircraft, a C-17A Globemaster and a C-130J Hercules, have already deployed to the Philippines to assist the relief effort. Both arrived in the Philippines overnight, transporting Australian doctors, nurses, paramedics, other medical specialists, and ADF logistic support staff. The C-130J will transfer the medical personnel and equipment from Cebu to Tacloban</p>
<p>Defence has assigned an additional RAAF C-130J Hercules and stands ready to deploy a second C-17A Globemaster if required.</p>
<p>HMAS <em>Tobruk</em> has been diverted from her current tasking to be available to support the relief and recovery effort if requested by the Government of the Philippines. HMAS <em>Tobruk</em> is ideally suited to assist given her amphibious heavy lift capability, on board accommodation and ability to support helicopter and landing craft operations.</p>
<p>Providing safe drinking water and power is now critical. The ADF is preparing to provide water purification systems and power generators to Tacloban over the coming days.</p>
<p>Australian humanitarian and consular officials are already on the ground in the Philippines. If Australians are able to make their own way safely to the airport, they should do so. The Australian Government will offer flights from Tacloban to Cebu for those affected by the typhoon.A Travel Bulletin with the details was issued on 14 November, and will continue to be updated.Â  It is available on the Smart Traveller website <a href="http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/travelbulletins/Philippines_Departure_Options">http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/travelbulletins/Philippines_Departure_Options</a>.</p>
<p>Those unable to contact Australian friends and family in the Philippines and who still hold concerns for their welfare, should call the DFAT 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre on 1300 555 135 or +612 6261 3305 from outside Australia.</p>
<p>Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines on Saturday and the UN estimates that 11 million people may be affected. The further $20 million package includes:</p>
<ul><li>$9 million to the United Nationsâ appeal (UNICEF, WHO, WFP and OCHA)</li>
<li>$4 million to the International Red Cross Red Crescent</li>
<li>$2 million to the Australian Red Cross</li>
<li>$2 million to other Australian NGO</li>
<li>$1 million to local NGOs</li>
<li>deployment of Australian specialists including a medical team ($1m), AFP disaster management specialists, and DFAT humanitarian and consular experts (up to $1m).</li>
