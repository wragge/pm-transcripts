ASIAN TOUR 1967 SINGAPORE<br />
ARRIVAL PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MR. HAROLD HOLT AT SINGAPORE AIRPORT 28TH MARCH, 1967<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Gentlemen, I thought I'd just speak quite briefly to you and then<br />
leave an opportunity for questions.<br />
My friends from Australia who are coming around with me, I<br />
understand, have agreed to let Singapore have the questions this<br />
time rather than monopolise the time.<br />
But I am very glad that as a consequence of my visit to four<br />
countrias ofl the South East Asian and Pacific region, which I have<br />
not previously visited, I am able to make this short but very<br />
useful visit to Singapore again.<br />
I am, of course, no stranger to Singapore. I'vye been here,<br />
and through here, many times -over the years, but I always find<br />
it both useful and very pleasant, certainly very pleasant to meet<br />
members of your Government again and to talk usefully and<br />
helpfully -with them, and I am looking forward tonight, in the<br />
absence of your distinguished Prime Minister, to meeting an<br />
old friend in the Acting Prime Minister, who very kindly is giving<br />
a dinner for me.<br />
My main purposes on this visit, as I've already indicated, will<br />
be to make contact with four contries of the region, which I've not<br />
previously visited, and I hope in this way to make Australia and<br />
its policies better known in those countries, and at the same time,<br />
because of the coverage which our own press will be giving to this<br />
visit, to make these countries and their significance for Australia,<br />
their leaders, and their people better know n to my own countrymen<br />
in Australia. There is an increasing interest and recognition in Australia<br />
of our growing involvement in the affairs of South East Asia and<br />
the Pacific, of which region of course, we feel ourselves to be<br />
a part. Geography brings us together and, at the same time,<br />
there are mutual interests to be served.<br />
We have an interest, as you do, in the security of the area,<br />
its stability and its peaceful progress, and Australia is developing<br />
an increasing trade with the countries of the area, generally speaking.<br />
So these are all good reasons why we should get to know each other<br />
better,. get to unlderstand each other's problems and, where we can<br />
be mutually helpful, to act in that f ash icn. / 2. </p>
<p>-2<br />
0 The countries which I shall be visiting all have a special<br />
significance for us. They don't necessarily all pursue the<br />
same policies, but, to takce an illustration, Cambodia,<br />
Australia has a special relationship there in that we represent the<br />
United States' interests in Cambodia, and we represent Cambodian<br />
interests in South Vietnam.<br />
So you will gather from this that my own country is able, in<br />
that way, to act as a useful bridge of understanding and contact<br />
between countries which don't have direct diplomatic relations<br />
w it h each other at the Wres ent time.<br />
I have spoken of stability, of our interest in stability in this<br />
region. I hope that won't be interpreted as meaning some<br />
conservative resistance to change. That is not how we view it.<br />
We have ourselves, as I think we have demonstrated, a<br />
national drive in our own development, and we aspire to rising<br />
standards for our people and the maintencnce of social justice<br />
and we look applaudingly at developments in other countries of<br />
the region which have these objectives, the betterment of affairs<br />
inside those countries and the processes of change which serve<br />
to produce that betterment, but to us stability and security are<br />
necessary ingredients in this process. If you don't have security<br />
and you have instability, then you ca't go ahead in the same way<br />
with orderly and peaceful progress.<br />
But this is of the essence of my purpose on this occasion to<br />
make better neighbours of good neighbours, more understanding<br />
between those good neighbours It is for me an educational tour,<br />
as I am sure it will be for those accompanying me, and, at the<br />
same time, I hope it will not be without some educative process<br />
for countries which have a significance for us and with which we<br />
hope to live on terms of friendship and co-operation, building<br />
our trade and our diplomatic relationships together.<br />
Now having said that, gentlemen, perhaps you have some<br />
questions you wish to put to me.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, when Mr. Bowden, the British Commonwealth<br />
Secretary, recently asked about the Australian attitude to the British<br />
drawdow n of troops here, he said that he believed that the Australian<br />
attitude was that you were less interested in the actual size of the<br />
British presence than in the fact of the British presence. Does this<br />
accurately reflect your views on the subject?<br />
PM: Well, we understand all along that after the confrontation issue<br />
had either ended or substantially abated, that the build-up of British<br />
forces which had occurred to meet that situation would also abate<br />
until you had something more closely approximating the preconfrontation<br />
level of Brit ish forces in the area, an d it is a fact<br />
that in my own discussions with Mr. Bowden I did make the point<br />
to him that we were n ot so much concerned with the size of the<br />
British Military Establishment in the area, but we did feel that it<br />
was important, not so much in our interests we feel that our<br />
security arrangements are adequate in any event but in the interests<br />
of the area as a whole, and indeed in the interests of maintaining<br />
British influence and prestige throughout this area, and indeed<br />
through the world, that continuance of a British presence in an area<br />
east of Suez which, after all, accommodates these days threef ifths </p>
<p>4 -3-<br />
of the human race was, and remains, important, and so far as<br />
I am aware that viewpoint has been well understood and accepted by<br />
the British Government and has shaped its policies in relation to<br />
this area ever since.<br />
Q. Sir, do you expect to discuss the Vietnam War during your<br />
present trip?<br />
PM: I am not coming for that special purpose. Our own policy is<br />
well known, our participation is well-known in the conflict there,<br />
we ourselves are hoping that there can emerge a settlement which<br />
will leave a just arn d enduring peace and which will enable these<br />
conditions of stability and security I've spoken of as aspirations<br />
to become realities in the area. But I'm afraid there has beaen<br />
no encouragement in the events of recent weeks to support the hope<br />
that there can be an early termination of hostilities or the kind of<br />
settlement that we would hope to see emerge there. I'm not in<br />
any way trying in the course of this visit to make some impact<br />
on the attitudes of others on this Issue. For example, Cambodia<br />
takes a different view of this matter from Australia. We can agree<br />
to differ on this matter, it's not my purpose to attempt to persuade<br />
the Government of Cambodia that they should alter their policies,<br />
they're well capable of making up their own minds as to what their<br />
policy should be.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, will you be taking an opportunity while you<br />
are in this area to visit Saigon this time?<br />
PM: No, I have no plans to visit Saigon. Since I was there myself there<br />
have been other visits by members of the Government and, of course,<br />
by Senior Diplomatic and Service Representatives, and the total journey<br />
I shall be making on this occasion has to be confined in 12 or 13 days,<br />
that involves four countries other than visits such as this which bring<br />
me to Singapore and Hongkong.<br />
Q. On Indonesia is there any chance that you'll go to Indonesia either<br />
at the end cf this visit ct in the near future?<br />
PM: Well, not in the course of this visit and I've made no plans, but<br />
I think it can be assumed that I would welcome a visit to Indonesia<br />
when the Government of that country felt it was propitious for me to<br />
do so. There have been visits by our own Minister for External<br />
Aff airs, Mr. Hasluck, who has, I think, developed a good relationship<br />
with the Government of Indonesia, and even through the difficult period<br />
of confrontation we were able to maintain a line of friendship which I<br />
know was welcomed there and which we were glad to hold out. We<br />
joined with others in looking constructively at the Economic problems<br />
of the country, and we hope that in the years ahead we'll develop<br />
closer, more cordial and co-operative relations, particularly in the<br />
areas of diplomacy and trade with Indonesia. </p>
