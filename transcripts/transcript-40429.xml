    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER TURNBULL:</strong><br />
Well Prime Minister it’s wonderful to see you formally this morning. We had a very good discussion last night for the G20 and congratulations on assuming the Prime Ministership.<br />
Britain has made a very momentous and historic choice to leave the European Union and we have already been engaged in discussions with you about what a free trade arrangement may look like after that. Australia is determined to provide Britain with all of the support and assistance that we can. We are such great friends, such strong allies. There couldn’t be two countries with closer bonds. So a lot to discuss on the economic front, on the strategic front and above all in terms of the future that the British people have chartered and that you are leading.<br />
So it’s wonderful to be here today.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER MAY:</strong><br />
Well thank you very much indeed and I enjoyed the opportunity to talk to you last night and obviously more formally this morning. I was very grateful I think you were one of the first people I spoke to after I became Prime Minister and at that point you offered the opportunity to discuss with Australia a free trade arrangement with Australia.  As you say the bonds between our two countries are longstanding and extremely close.  I think we have real opportunity. It is an historic decision for British people, it will be a complex and challenging process leaving Europe Union. But I’m very clear that it doesn’t mean that we’re going to be inward looking. In fact we want to be even more outward-looking around the whole of today and obviously Australia, with our longstanding ties and our close relationship will be one of the first countries we’ll be looking to.</p>
