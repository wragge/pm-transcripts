<p>E&amp;OE.............</p>
<p>  PEACOCK:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, thanks for joining us. You've said that we're a good and</p>
<p>   decent country and still will be on Sunday no matter who wins either the</p>
<p>   football or the votes and you're also saying that Australian voters are</p>
<p>   always right. What will that then mean if they vote no to your preamble?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I will have to accept that like I will accept a yes vote to the republic.</p>
<p>   The point I am.</p>
<p>  PEACOCK:</p>
<p>  What would it say about Australians if they voted against something like</p>
<p>   that?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, it would say that they either haven't had enough time to consider</p>
<p>   it or they wanted it expressed in a different way. But I hope they don't</p>
<p>   vote no to the preamble. I hope they vote yes to the preamble because the</p>
<p>   preamble is the one thing tomorrow that all of us can vote for irrespective</p>
<p>   of our views on the republic. The great thing about the preamble is that</p>
<p>   it can unite all Australians behind a common set of Australian values. We've</p>
<p>   heard a lot about symbols during this whole debate on the republic. In many</p>
<p>   ways the things that bring Australians together most of all are the values</p>
<p>   that we hold in common. When I think of Australia I think more of the things</p>
<p>   that we believe in, our equality, our origins, our common commitment, our</p>
<p>   mateship and all of those things that we have endeavoured to encapsulate</p>
<p>   in the preamble. And, of course, most importantly, this preamble is the</p>
<p>   first opportunity that Australians have had for 100 years to put something</p>
<p>   in the Constitution which is decent and positive and noble about the Aboriginal</p>
<p>   and Torres Strait Islander people who are the first peoples of this nation.</p>
<p>   And it would be a great shame if that opportunity were passed up. But I</p>
<p>   hold to the view that in a democracy the customer is always right and that's</p>
<p>   an attitude of mine that I would encourage those who have an opposite view</p>
<p>   to me on the republic to accept if the verdict should go against them tomorrow.</p>
<p>  I don't know what the result's going to be tomorrow on either question.</p>
<p>   I hope the republic is defeated because I think the model being proposed</p>
<p>   would leave us with a less secure, less stable arrangement than we have</p>
<p>   at the present time. I hope the preamble wins.</p>
<p>  PEACOCK:</p>
<p>  What about your argument with the preamble that you use on the republic,</p>
<p>   if it ain't broke don't fix it is your slogan, why fix this in the Constitution</p>
<p>   when some lawyers at least do say that it has legal implications?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, Matt, that really is not a very good analogy because there's no separate,</p>
<p>   free-standing preamble at the moment. The only preamble is the.</p>
<p>  PEACOCK:</p>
<p>  But why tamper with a good Constitution?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  The only preamble at the moment is the ordinary recital which is contained</p>
<p>   in the British Act establishing the Constitution. And what I'm asking for</p>
<p>   for the first time is to put an authentic, indigenous, Australian set of</p>
<p>   words in the Constitution itself. I'm not proposing you throw something</p>
<p>   out that works. I'm proposing something to add something which will make</p>
<p>   what now works work even better because it will contain a statement of the</p>
<p>   aspirations of the Australian people.</p>
<p>  PEACOCK:</p>
<p>  Isn't it really a symbolic change though as you acknowledge, just like replacing</p>
<p>   the Queen with one of our own?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, they're two entirely different propositions. The republican proposition</p>
<p>   tomorrow is that you replace a Head of State arrangement which has worked</p>
<p>   brilliantly over the last 100 years with an alternative which would leave</p>
<p>   the President far less secure than is the Governor-General at present and</p>
<p>   would not guarantee that you would get the same depth of talent available</p>
<p>   for the presidency in future as is now available for the governor-generalship.</p>
<p>   One of the great advantages of our present system is that it enables the</p>
<p>   best and the brightest and those who can contribute most to be asked to</p>
<p>   accept appointment as Governor-General and come out of their existing positions</p>
<p>   without fear that some kind of nomination process will compromise them in</p>
<p>   their existing positions and, therefore, discourage them from making themselves</p>
<p>   available. I don't think you would get the same quality for President under</p>
<p>   the proposed model as you now have for Governor-General.</p>
<p>  People have said to me a lot during the campaign they admire the current</p>
<p>   Governor-General, they admire the job that previous Governor-Generals have</p>
<p>   done and I think it highlights the fact that if you depart from the present</p>
<p>   system I'm not sure that the President, under a future arrangement, would</p>
<p>   necessarily be as good as the Governor-Generals we have at present, have</p>
<p>   had recently and have at present.</p>
<p>  PEACOCK:</p>
<p>  Now, you've quoted Lee Kuan Yew as dismissing the view that this will make</p>
<p>   us the laughing stock overseas. But various people, including Dick Woolcott</p>
<p>   who's just been to Singapore and says senior Singaporeans hold a different</p>
<p>   view, Henry Kissinger, Rupert Murdoch, all say it will for the same reason</p>
<p>   that symbolically it will be a vote that says we're more British than Australasian.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I think that's a ridiculous argument. And I quoted Lee Kuan Yew because</p>
<p>   he's the elder Statesman of Asia. He put it very nicely. What he said was</p>
<p>   that he didn't think there'd be any different attitude and I'm sure that's</p>
<p>   right. Matt, I've travelled Asia as a Minister, as an Opposition Leader</p>
<p>   and as Prime Minister. There's never any doubt that Australia is seen in</p>
<p>   a clear, distinct light. I mean, one of our strengths in Asia is that we</p>
<p>   are seen as Australian and we are now. And we are seen as, sure, having</p>
<p>   associations with Europe and North America and why shouldn't we be seen</p>
<p>   as having those associations because it's true but we are seen as bringing</p>
<p>   an Australian perspective. Now, I went through the whole of the East Timor</p>
<p>   saga and negotiated with the leaders of countries in the region and around</p>
<p>   the world and the most intense negotiation that any Prime Minister of this</p>
<p>   country's been involved in since World War II. It's absurd to suggest that</p>
<p>   the outcome of that would have been any different if we'd been a republic.</p>
<p>   It is absurd to suggest that I went to those negotiations limited and enfeebled</p>
<p>   by our existing constitutional arrangements. I mean, it is a ludicrous proposition.</p>
<p>  PEACOCK:</p>
<p>  Just on that subject, Prime Minister, and a slightly separate matter, how</p>
<p>   embarrassing would it be for us in the region if your Minister for Defence,</p>
<p>   Mr Moore, was dumped in a pre-selection? Will you do anything to save him?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, it certainly is a separate matter. Look, the pre-selection choices</p>
<p>   are a matter for the Party organisation. Can I say I have great confidence</p>
<p>   in him as Defence Minister.</p>
<p>  PEACOCK:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, thanks for joining us.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  You're welcome.</p>
<p>  [Ends]</p>
