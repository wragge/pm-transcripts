<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I think it';s always regrettable when a country decides to go, but the decision the Commonwealth took yesterday was the only decision, the only decision, consistent with the Harare principles.  You have to have consistent standards in these matters.  But nothing is permanent.  There is no reason why at some time in the future, Zimbabwe mightn';t want to come back.  I hope the people of Zimbabwe would want to do that.  My concern really is for their welfare, more than anything else.  They are suffering greatly and their welfare and what is needed to improve their welfare should be our dominant consideration.</p>
