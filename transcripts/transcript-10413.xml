    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am proud to announce that the Government will increase funding for the protection of the Great Barrier Reef by $250 000.</p>
<p>The coasts and oceans are important to Australia and they must be carefully protected. The Natural Heritage Trust provides the means for doing this.</p>
<p>This extra funding will allow the installation of 43 additional moorings and numerous 'no anchoring area' markers.</p>
<p>This will protect the reef from anchor damage at the same time as allowing people to enjoy its incredible beauty.</p>
<p>It represents my Government's determination to get on with the job of finding the right balance between environmental care and eco-tourism jobs.</p>
<p>The environment has had scores of reports and studies and it is now time to get on with the job and that's what the Natural Heritage Trust is all about.</p>
<p>I will be announcing the funding details of the Coasts and Clean Seas component of the Natural Heritage Trust on 22 July. The focus will again be on real solutions to problems such as pollution, marine pests, coastal damage and oil spills.</p>
<p>The extra funding for protecting the reef is just the start of many such initiatives to come around Australia - real projects with real benefits.</p>
<p>It is just another example of the Government getting on with the job in protecting the environment.</p>
