8 February 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER.<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP ANU, CANBER] RA<br />
E&amp; OE Il.<br />
1' m talking to everybody. I expect to have a meeting next week with, a combined<br />
meeting, with representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the<br />
mining industry and the pastoral industry. I'm trying to see if there is some common<br />
ground, there may be there may not be, but I'm prepared to try. And there is a<br />
willingness on the part of everybody to talk together. It's a difficult issue and as I said<br />
in my speech to the conference there is no monopoly of moral righteousness held by<br />
any one group so far as the issue is concerned. Everybody has legitimate concerns.<br />
The Wik decision overturned one of the key bases of the original Native Title<br />
legislation and it's not realistic to pretend that nothing has happened.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PRIAM MINISTER.<br />
I don't find anything that the National Party has done or said as being unhelpful.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the Racial Discrimination Act on the table at this stage?<br />
PRIME NMNISTER:.<br />
I couldn't hear that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the Racial Discrimination Act on the table? Is it open to negotiation?<br />

<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There is nothing which is, in terms of legislation, which is absolutely sacrosanct. What<br />
is sacrosanct in this country is racial equality. The way in which we express racial<br />
equality can be a matter of legitimate debate at the margins. But racial equality itself<br />
of course is sacrosanct but I'm not going to rule legislative changes out or in at this<br />
se. What I'm tying to do in a spirit of good will is to see if we can't find some<br />
common ground. I've listened to the Aboriginal people carefully, they have concerns<br />
and rights. The farmers have concerns and rights. If your family has held a pastoral<br />
lease for years on a certain basis and then out of the blue the basis of that is overturned<br />
by the courts, you have a right to say that's not necessarily fair. So there are all points<br />
of view on something like this and people have to show a bit of patience and restraint<br />
and we might be able to get common ground and we may not and if we can then<br />
obviously the Governent will have to take certain decisions.<br />
JOURNALIST: Land is a pivotal religious issue to the Aboriginal commiunities. You're here at a<br />
conference which is about religious values, how does that equate in an economical<br />
rationale about the use of land?<br />
PRIME MINISTER.-<br />
You've got to accommodate all of those concerns and I'm quite certain we can.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME AMISTER.-<br />
I couldn't hear that I'm sorry.<br />
JOURNALIST: Given the National Party's put such a strong position doesn't that go against what the<br />
Government's been trying to say that there are no options being rule out or ruled in?<br />
PRIME MIINISTER:<br />
No, I don't find anything the National Party's said.. well, I'm not concerned about it. I<br />
understand the view of rank and file National Party members, it's all part of the<br />
richness of the debate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you ruled out extinguishment? 2<br />

<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, I'm simply not going to rule things in and out at this stage. I am going to do<br />
what I have persistently said from day one I would do, that is talk to everybody which<br />
I've done. I'm going to convene a meeting next week which brings all of the parties at<br />
a national level together. If something emerges from that, that's terrific. If it doesn't<br />
then an attempt will have been made and the Government will then have to make a<br />
conscientious decision to try and meet its twin objectives ofjustice and certainty.<br />
Thank you.<br />
