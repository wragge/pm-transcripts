REVI3W OF BODIES CONDUCTING INQUTRIES<br />
The Government has compl-etd a review of over fifty bodies<br />
of various kinds which have been conducting inquiries for the<br />
Commonwealth. As a result of this review it has been decided that 14 bodies<br />
ill be terminated immediately.<br />
The remaining bodies have been given specific dates by whih<br />
they will be expected to report. Most are expected to complete<br />
their activities by 30 June 1976.<br />
The bodies whose activities are to be terminated and those<br />
which are being directed or asked to report by certain dates<br />
are shown on: the attached list.<br />
It has also been decided to introduce other measures designed<br />
to keep the costs of continuing inquiries to a minimum.<br />
Theme include the elimination as far as possible of overseas<br />
and internal travel, restrictions on use of consultants and<br />
maximum use of available deoartn-al resou: ces.<br />
The Australian Government Publishing Service is to be made<br />
respcnsible for publishing reports and will aim at making<br />
significant savings on current estimates of their costs.<br />
Ministers are b-ing asked to review the operations of the lar; e<br />
number of continuing advisory bodies within their portfolios, with<br />
the dim of reducint their number and making savings in their operations-<br />

In addition the Government has decided that. the Social<br />
Welfare Commission and the Australian Housing Corporation,<br />
snould be abolished while the functions of the Australian<br />
Development Assistance Agency and the Road Safety and Standards<br />
Authority should be taken over by Government Departments.<br />
The Government has taken these decisions on the basis<br />
that the functions of the four bodies concerned can be<br />
carried out more efficiently and cheaply and more properly<br />
under Ministerial and Parliamentary control if conducted<br />
within a departmental framework.<br />
The decision to abolish the Social Welfare Commission confirms<br />
a decision of the previous Governmer..<br />
The only function presently being performed by the Australian<br />
Housing Corporation is the administration of the Defence<br />
Service Homes Scheme. The Government is examining the best<br />
method of administering this Scheme and will be consulting<br />
with the R. S. L. in the matter.<br />
The Australian Development Assistance Agency is to be converted<br />
into a Bureau of Overseas Aid in the Department of Foreign<br />
Affairs, while the Road Safety and Standards Authority is to<br />
be incorporated in the Department of Transport.<br />
In addition, the Australian Drug Advisory Council is<br />
to be abolished immediately. </p>
