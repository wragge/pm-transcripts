    <content><![CDATA[<p>Itâs great to see that Craig Laundy, the local member, is already a very popular local member and thanks everyone for being here this morning.</p>
<p>Â Itâs great to see so many people out and about and I have a very clear message to everyone this morning.</p>
<p>This is a very Australian gathering. Many of you have come to Australia from other countries, but this is a very Australian gathering because in cities and towns right around our country, there are very diverse groups of people who have come together to join the Australian family.</p>
<p>Please donât think of yourselves as newcomers; please think of yourselves as Australian.</p>
<p>As all of you would know from your experience here in this country, one of the great Aussie characteristics is to have a go â to have a go.</p>
<p>The great thing about migrants to Australia over many generations is that theyâve all had a go. Theyâve had a go for themselves, theyâve had a go for their families, for their children, for their wider communities and thatâs the great strength of our country. People come here from all parts of the world, they are welcomed into our big Australian family and they are encouraged to have a go. You are encouraged to have a go.</p>
<p>Thatâs what today is all about â encouraging you to have a go and making it as clear as we can to you that as far as the National Government is concerned â as far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned â we want to provide good services that will help people who are prepared to have a go.</p>
<p>Itâs great to be here with community groups that have been working with migrants for many, many years now and I salute them. I salute all the council officers and all the local councillors who are here today.</p>
<p>But I particularly want to stress today a policy which the Coalition took to the election, which Iâm very proud of. It was originally suggested to me by my friend, Noel Pearson, three or four years ago.</p>
<p>We call it the Job Commitment Bonus and what that policy means is that if you have been unemployed for twelve months or more and you get a job and you keep it for twelve months or more â donât go back on social security â there will be a bonus of $2,500 at the end of that year. If you keep the job for two years â donât go back on social security â thereâll be a further $4,000 made available, because we want to break the culture of unemployment.</p>
<p>We want to break the cycle of welfare dependency.</p>
<p>We donât want people to leave school, go onto unemployment benefits and stay there. We think this is a marvellous way of letting people know if they do have a go, if they find a job and keep having a go, and stay in that job, and keep having a go and stay off welfare, well thereâs something there as a tangible reward. Thereâs something there to reach out to, something there to look forward to, because having a job is the best single way to contribute to our community.</p>
<p>Yes, itâs fantastic to work with your community. Itâs great to be a volunteer in a community group and both Craig and I over the years have done a lot of volunteering for community groups, but in the end, to make an economic contribution is the best way to be part of the wider Australian community - thatâs why weâre so determined to make it easier for that to happen.</p>
<p>Thatâs why Iâm so pleased to be here today to let you know that this new Job Commitment Bonus will be in place from 1 July this year. And I know there are people here â I met Malia on the way in, I met Simone on the way in. They are youngsters that are having a go and we want to encourage people who are having a go.</p>
<p>So, thank you so much and Craig, thanks for organising this.</p>
