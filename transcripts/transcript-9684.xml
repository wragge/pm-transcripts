TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
JOINT DOORSTOP WITH THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE<br />
VIETNAMESE COMMUNIST PARTY DO MUOI AT THE KILORI<br />
CONFERENCE CENTRE, TANNUM SANDS, QUEENSLAND,<br />
3 AUGUST 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I would like to say that we are delighted to have the General Secretary<br />
of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Do Muoi, and to say that what we<br />
seek with Vietnam is not a relationship, but a partnership. And that<br />
partnership with the General Secretary has come in a very vigorous<br />
visit. He has visited the ACT, Victoria, NSW and now Queensland. We<br />
are looking at areas of co-operation between us, and ways we might be<br />
able to help Vietnam develop. Vietnam is a country of 70 million<br />
people, has just joined ASEAN, it has just exchanged Ambassadors<br />
with the United States, joined the Community of Nations in the Asia<br />
Pacific it now needs the help of countries like Australia to integrate<br />
fully in the community of nations around here. So today, of course<br />
you know Vietnam is rich in bauxite we have been looking at bauxite<br />
and alumina. The General Secretary has also looked at<br />
telecommunications, of which, of course, we have a very large<br />
presence in Vietnam with Telstra. And we are looking at other aspects<br />
including tourism aspects today. Tourism is another great<br />
opportunity for the Vietnamese economy. So, I am delighted that the<br />
General Secretary made the visit to Australia for such a high-ranking<br />
person to have come, we are very greatly honoured, and I hope that<br />
this will lead to other cooperation between us.<br />
DM: First of all, I would like to thank the Honourable Prime Minister for<br />
inviting me to visit Australia. Also, I would like to say... .( inaudible). . for<br />
the attention given to my people, and most of all to you, I would like to<br />
convey our friendship from the Vietnamese people to the Australian<br />
people. ( The Secretary General says that for himself) and other<br />
members of the delegation.. .( inaudible). . this visit is one of the longest<br />
visits we have made we find Australia a peaceful country and you<br />
have not any wars for hundreds of years which is contrary to our<br />
situation. We are desirous ( inaudible)... . for peace. Australia is also a </p>
<p>very rich country the people are leading a happy life. And I have<br />
found all sorts of" friendships from Australia, especially towards<br />
Vietnam. There have been ups and downs in our history, but history is<br />
history. I believe from now on, between us, that we will always have<br />
eternal friendship.<br />
I came to visit the Honourable Governor General, I had working session<br />
with the Honourable Prime Minister, and with the different Ministers.<br />
And everywhere where we have been pleased to find friendship and<br />
cooperation. .( inaudible) most thankful to the Honourable Prime<br />
Minister and the people of Australia. We know that Australia has<br />
helped Vietnam people all the way. Yesterday I had a meeting with the<br />
Trade Union organisation. ( inaudible).... They supported our anti-<br />
American War and they are continuing to support us in our professional<br />
reconstruction. We are grateful ( inaudible) of projects which are very<br />
efficient. This time the Australian Government has signed an<br />
agreement with us to assist us in building a huge bridge. This is one of<br />
the biggest projects so far in Vietnam worth $ 70 80 ' million. And the<br />
Australian Government has also assisted us in making economic zones<br />
in the South, and also assistance is coming in the form of personnel<br />
training in health care and we highly appreciate the activities carried<br />
out by the Fred Hollows Foundation, which is assisting Vietnam in<br />
treating cataracts. It is an activity of high significance to the lives of the<br />
Vietnamese people, because many Vietnamese people have eye<br />
problems. .( inaudible).... We are grateful to Australia for this project,<br />
and we will speed up the necessary procedures so that projects can<br />
soon be put into operation to bring about bright eyes to the people.<br />
Apart from the non-refundable assistance, the Australian Government<br />
personified by his Honourable the Prime Minister has decided to lend<br />
us ( inaudible)... During my visit I have met with business people here,<br />
and we had discussions on multi-.. corporations possibilities. We want<br />
to do the metalurgy, we want to produce electricity and new fertiliser in<br />
cooperation with Australia. We want to do the telecommunications with<br />
Australia as well. In short, we are very poor and we want to do<br />
everything. In particular, we would like to do the dairy and the meat<br />
production and sugar cane production with Australia because Vietnam<br />
is extremely poor after the War and the livelihood of the people is very<br />
low. 50 per cent of the children are undernourished. The main task of<br />
the Vietnamese leadership is to improve the livelihood of the people<br />
and to fight malnutrition among the children. One of the main purposes<br />
of the visit to Australia is to visit the meat, dairy and sugar cane<br />
production. In principle, the Prime Minister and the other leaders of the<br />
Australian Government ( inaudible) support it by the business groups<br />
here. They have shown their readiness and willingness to do that and<br />
while we are considering the.. action. Your heart is already there.<br />
What you need from us is to streamline the cumbersome procedures.<br />
Now I can say my visit to. AUstralia is highly successful and what is best<br />
of all is the friendship between our two countries Vietnam and<br />
Australia. That can serve as the groundwork to develop our multilateral<br />
cooperation and to materialise our cooperation and friendship we need<br />
long lasting peace and stability. We need to be rid of war in our region. </p>
<p>We need to eliminate ail kinds bf nuclear weapons from the region. We<br />
need to eliminate the weapons of mass destruction from this region.<br />
We need to join the struggle so that forever as we build stability,<br />
friendship, cooperation and development in our region. Thank you.<br />
J: General Secretary do you feel snubbed by the boycott of your visit by<br />
the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard?<br />
DM: It is quite normal. Now, well, he may have some other business.<br />
He has sent his representative. Well in a welcome to you, I would like<br />
to send my greetings. I hope that there will be only friendship between<br />
us. I haven't had anything to say with the Vietnamese community here<br />
because of many reasons. There are tens of thousands of Vietnamese<br />
who have come here for a living. We thank the Prime Minister, the<br />
Government of Australia and the people of Australia for helping the<br />
Vietnamese people both in living and working conditions. We have<br />
asked our compatriots who are living here to fulfil all the obligations of<br />
the citizens of the country and at the same time in my country they can<br />
enjoy their rights. We also advise that we offer to contribute what<br />
needs to achieving greater prosperity and happiness to Australia and<br />
they must work harder to have better lives and send their children to<br />
school so they that can have an excellent education. This is one of the<br />
best conditions under which you can give your children a good<br />
education. ( inaudible) They can make some contribution to the<br />
reconstruction of the country of Vietnam after decades of war and we<br />
also advise them to unite with each other and respect the local laws.<br />
J: [ inaudible]<br />
PM: Vietnamese people in Australia and in Vietnam say that, I think,<br />
Australia wants a partnership with Vietnam that we want to be able to<br />
help the Vietnamese people. We want good people to people<br />
relationships. We know the War has cost them, not only their liberty for<br />
so long, but also their standard of living. Unfortunately, they have lost<br />
much of the opportunities the rest of us have had. We would like to<br />
help them catch up as quickly as they can. Thank you.<br />
J: Prime Minister, just before you go, ( inaudible) the State election<br />
outcome in Gladstone?<br />
PM: I don't think so. I mean I had a most friendly welcome yesterday at the<br />
Graingrowers Council not a traditional Labor spot. I had a very<br />
friendly reception provided for me here in Gladstone yesterday. So I<br />
think that, no, I don't think the press should take up the urban myth, the<br />
panaceas, which have been put about by the spin doctors. I am finding<br />
relations in Queensland are as good as they have ever been.<br />
