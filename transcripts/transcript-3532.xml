PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 401<br />
9 December 1974<br />
INTERIM REPORT FROM I. A. C. ON FARM INCOME STABILISATION<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, announced today<br />
that he had asked the I. A. C. to provide an interim report<br />
by 30 June 1975 on two recommendations made in the Green<br />
Paper on Rural Policy.<br />
The two recommendations related to income tax<br />
measures being taken either by means of tax averaging<br />
provisions or income equalisation deposits to reduce<br />
fluctuations in the incomes of rural producers.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that the interim report would be<br />
part of the overall report on the inquiry being conducted<br />
by the T. A. C. on what assistance was needed to reduce<br />
fluctuations in the incomes of primary producers.<br />
Receipt of the interim report by 30 June 1975 would<br />
enable the Government to consider its recommendations in the<br />
context of the 1975/ 76 Budget.<br />
