    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much Peter McGauran. To Dr Bob Edwards, Andrew</p>
<p> Sayers, to Gordon and Marilyn Darling, my other Parliamentary colleagues,</p>
<p> Kevin Newman, the Chairman of the Old Parliament House Council, other</p>
<p> distinguished guests, ladies and gentleman. Janette and I have had</p>
<p> the opportunity of a, albeit brief inspection of the exhibition and</p>
<p> I can only express to you a sense of excitement about the quality</p>
<p> of the exhibition and a sense of excitement about tonight. It is an</p>
<p> important event in the cultural life of Australia. It's an important</p>
<p> event in the history of our nation. We join only three other nations</p>
<p> that have national portrait galleries. Those in Washington, London</p>
<p> and Edinburgh. And this gallery expresses the history and the experience</p>
<p> of the Australian people in so many ways. And it is appropriate that</p>
<p> it be located here in the Old Parliament House.</p>
<p>To many Australians Old Parliament House provided portraits of a certain</p>
<p> group of Australians. We looked upon it for so many years as the centre</p>
<p> of politics and of national life from a government point of view in</p>
<p> our nation. Just over a year ago when we had the Constitutional Convention</p>
<p> here it displayed yet a more diverse group of Australians, each offering</p>
<p> in their own way a passionate view about the future of this country.</p>
<p> And I think it is entirely appropriate and I'm so pleased that</p>
<p> the decision was taken that the National Portrait Gallery should be</p>
<p> located here. And I do want to take the opportunity of paying particular</p>
<p> tribute to the energy and the zeal and the vision of Marilyn and Gordon</p>
<p> Darling because without that energy and zeal and that commitment it</p>
<p> would have simply remained a set of dreams and a vision rather than</p>
<p> the fulfillment which is brought to us tonight.</p>
<p>I certainly share the view of others that we are particularly privileged</p>
<p> to have Andrew Sayers as the gallery director. The way in which people</p>
<p> have spoken so warmly and positively of his contribution to the gallery</p>
<p> and his understanding of what is needed to turn it into a first class</p>
<p> attraction and first class manifestation of Australian culture is</p>
<p> well deserved.</p>
<p>All of us like to collect portraits of our loved ones and through</p>
<p> the years we've done it in different ways. We've done it</p>
<p> through what are now faded photographs on mantlepieces, and in albums,</p>
<p> and in drawers. We've done it through home movies and more recently</p>
<p> through home videos. And just as we collect portraits of our own lives</p>
<p> and we collect portraits of those we love, so this gallery houses</p>
<p> the portraits of those who've loved Australia in a special way</p>
<p> and have made a contribution to Australia in a special way. It is</p>
<p> a gallery that recognises excellence. It's also a gallery that</p>
<p> recognises the ordinary and the typical and that is how it should</p>
<p> be as a gallery which is designed for all of the Australian community.</p>
<p>This gallery will take its place alongside some of the other great</p>
<p> cultural institutions of our nation. We are all conscious as we approach</p>
<p> the centenary of the Federation of our nation, that where ever we</p>
<p> come from in Australia, and whatever view we have about the nature</p>
<p> of the Australian nation and the character of the Australian people</p>
<p> , we have a gathering pride of growing intensity in the history of</p>
<p> our nation and of what this country has achieved. And this gallery</p>
<p> will offer to its visitors a snapshot of that through the images and</p>
<p> the portraits of so many Australians who in so many different ways,</p>
<p> of infinitely various ways, have made a contribution.</p>
<p>The Government has provided very strong financial support to Old Parliament</p>
<p> House and through that to the National Portrait Gallery. It is without</p>
<p> doubt one of the best investments this Government has made. I really</p>
<p> am very excited about what I've seen tonight. I'm not only</p>
<p> excited about the concept, I'm very excited about the reality</p>
<p> of it.</p>
<p>I do want to thank people who've made contributions, from the</p>
<p> corporate sector who've made contributions to the gallery. I</p>
<p> want to encourage others also to make contributions. You may have</p>
<p> heard me before on the subject of partnerships and coalitions between</p>
<p> governments and the corporate sector in achieving good public outcomes.</p>
<p> And I do thank those who've invested and supported it. I particularly</p>
<p> again very warmly thank Marilyn and Gordon for their contribution.</p>
<p> And Janette and I remember very well that afternoon in Washington</p>
<p> in July of 1997 when they accompanied us on a tour of the National</p>
<p> Portrait Gallery in Washington, and all the while making some entirely</p>
<p> appropriate, and can I say highly effective comments. Highly effective</p>
<p> comments about the value of national portrait galleries and how valuable</p>
<p> they are for the esteem of the Government's who's during</p>
<p> whose term they are opening, and he did it very well and he did it</p>
<p> very very eloquently.</p>
<p>So to you Marilyn and Gordon, to Dr Edwards, to Andrew Sayers, to</p>
<p> all the other members of the Council of the National Gallery, thank</p>
<p> you for your contribution to this great Australian institution. Thank</p>
<p> you for contributing to something that will give us a particular sense</p>
<p> of the luster and the achievement of our nation and of the quality</p>
<p> of the people who've contributed to its history and to its success.</p>
<p> It is therefore with particular pleasure that I declare open the National</p>
<p> Portrait Gallery of Australia. Thank you.</p>
