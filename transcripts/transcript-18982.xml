<p>The Australian Government will provide tax deductible status to relief funds established to help Australians affected by the Tasmanian bushfires.</p>
<p>The Acting Assistant Treasurer, the Hon Gary Gray AO, MP, today declared the January 2013 Tasmanian fires a disaster for the purposes of establishing Australian disaster relief funds.</p>
<p>This declaration ensures that new funds and qualifying existing funds established for the relief of people in communities affected by the bushfires, can receive tax deductible donations.</p>
<p>While funds still need to apply for formal endorsement, the Tax Office has established a fast track process to get applications approved as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>As communities in Tasmania hit hard by recent bushfires start to count the cost, Australians from all around the country are coming together to help out.</p>
<p>These donations can be used to provide money or direct assistance for relief, recovery and community reconstruction work to assist affected individuals and communities. </p>
<p>The Government will also continue to assist affected communities as they undertake the long task of rebuilding and re-establishing.</p>
<p>Donations to Australian disaster relief funds, established to provide relief in the aftermath of the bushfires, will be tax deductible for a period of two years from the date of this declaration. </p>
<p>These events have caused devastation to communities in Tasmania and have resulted in widespread damage to property and the environment.</p>
<p>Further information on establishing an Australian disaster relief fund is available at <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au">www.ato.gov.au</a>.</p>
