~-~ a~ l. MN~ id~ XiiMN1. j-HJ~ OURt 0? R, Hog* K. Jp<br />
Your ft00lleni09s, Prime Hinist'ir, and gentlment<br />
IL have a VerY Simple tusk tonight-I am to propose the toast<br />
of 3omebody who Is heaiily concealed on the book of the 4ords as " our<br />
Distinguished Ouest", ait I must bring him out from behind this<br />
erncealmnent. The Prim Minister of Nowv Z! ealand is, af coara., j al-days<br />
a distinguished 4vest, but he is aliso our aei~ tibour and our friend,<br />
(-$' Pplaua) There have 0eern some amusing Incidents of late Tirime Xinister6<br />
One or two, or, for all I ". ow three membersof the Federal Parliament<br />
h. v suggested t at you ought to join the Coonwrealth of ', ustrisliao<br />
-% nd I an credibly i.. forined that whom you were asked about this at a<br />
? rasai interview you said, I thoght quite clearly, 04ell io're just<br />
dis--hargod our trust to Jest ibAwa and they nov hale their<br />
.16ndapendone. defre quite prepa* rol to conusir niothe,-taleovcr".<br />
( Laughter) Is that right? The Prime Minister iamirds, me the lists<br />
are open. It is a very curious thing, you kflov, about Auitradiih and<br />
liov ., alandt a terrible thing, that -do should have to ,.-alk About each<br />
other as if we . rere thousands rand thousands of m~ iles vway. I hIsv<br />
occasionally pointed out to my Nov &amp;. aland friends that there Is<br />
something quite irrational aiuout the fact -hat if . an Austrutlian Member<br />
of Parliament wants to jo to Perth# or -ants to jo eien into the<br />
remote vild. nessas of vjyndham., or * arits to o up 1Into 6-he north of<br />
, ueensland he just oosj wnd Ministers io are ali~ ijs reluctant,<br />
lik~ e mysl!' 1 LO travel win go to theso pucos. jut I ion't need to<br />
be told that It is m~ uch fuarther from ; jdney~ or ', nberra to Perth than<br />
it is from Sjd~ ney or Canberra to aekland. And yet th.: t is an<br />
ov~ rsoas cnter prise, This is a very odd thing and I ast say* a<br />
very ; tranje thi%,, t rho more you think uaout it l~ e more you .8alise,<br />
that although we have _ vueu idea In Austridlia that New cZoaa is<br />
our little brother, anid In Vowi Zealanid they h. ate a determined idea<br />
hat je re a miserable lot of wvh atev,-r you oare to say in<br />
Australia, the fact is that for aUl the iurposes in this iorld<br />
, pirpostes of existenceg or economic survival* or econamic Srovtki ws<br />
are the same people. '-rdi the proat problem, Prim Minister# is raally<br />
to encourage every ody on both sides of this Tasman, this turbulent<br />
sea, whiah lies east of Sydney, ir even east of eAst 3ydney ( Laughter)<br />
to jet to know each other better and undrstad each other bett.. r,<br />
I bad a talk with the Prime Ministe, 9 Awo is an old friend<br />
of min*,, this afternoon and we agreed in principle ( you kcnow that is<br />
a very good thing, * In pririeipleN this ' Ar I majy tell you Is EAwt I<br />
alvays resist in labinets I say 01 won't haste these decisions in<br />
principle* because once you baire made then y.-u are sunk, yju see but<br />
on the Continent they do this thing r ther bottar they say " an<br />
principles anid It's the ume thing) but he and I have Seedq in<br />
principle that It is very Important that every ye. r some meaers of<br />
Parliament from Australia should ; o to New zealand and dot to meet<br />
their opposite mn~ ers; and that some aembers or Pa&amp; rliament from Now<br />
/ Aealnnd should come, to nustralia and me. tCheir opposite nubers -not<br />
based on some Party conception, but a bulance of people in Parliament.<br />
I think this is of the greatest Importance and I am very hapy to say<br />
that the P~ rime Minister agrees about this, in pr incigle# because vs<br />
realj outt Lo kno moro about each other than we do.<br />
Wihat do 4e e now about New Zealand? we 1Cnop CIvery<br />
histralian knovsp going back to 4arst that the nov Zealanders and the<br />
Australians have stood side by side and have k~ nown no diffarenoo in<br />
the field of aourage. </p>
<p>.4<br />
4e also know in our Waesting fashion t at It is not somaqy yoara ap<br />
that most of the Ministers in the Caibinet in Raw healand came from<br />
kastralia ( Laughter) and# I relgret to say$ a nmoer of them from<br />
iinyhow it doesn't matter. ( Laughter) There they iwere, there they vet..'<br />
And In my own lifetime I have often met som distinguished beadmasterg<br />
so famous pu'ofesaor# same ireat head of a cleg an I have said<br />
Ineautiously, " his is a very pood mam and I have Lon answered Q<br />
yes he cases tm 1ew Zealand". s3o it has been a two-way trafflo<br />
Autrajian politicians to Now : ea1andj scholars and gentleman to<br />
Alstralia. ( Laughtor)<br />
I an reminded by my equestian friend the M~ iister for Trade9p<br />
-4hio, as you well know is of course, a devotes of the race course9 that<br />
eviery time w. have a Cabinet Siveep, a Å“ CL In -even -aul Hasluck<br />
subscribing ( Laughter) all you have to do Is to run down the list<br />
If you are a scholar oni these matters as I am and say " dhonea has<br />
Safter It?" and you are pretty safe* ( Laughter) that Is what<br />
they do to ua. That's right. Sven Captain Cook having gone to New<br />
heaanddon't fbr.. tg cow to Australia Ast haste naver forget<br />
that. tLaughter) -Mt dirt all these are intoresting aspects of the fact that<br />
we a" r nei1hbours, ve are frinds, we are of the same bloodp und our<br />
fu. ture Is inseparable. our fuiture as survivors in a vrord oonfliet<br />
Detwoen. darkness and light, is topther* ziot one of us can survive<br />
wiithouat the other, And In the great events that are being neptiated<br />
at this time In the world we are toget Xou may havr this at risk<br />
O irna ththeer mneogreo ttihaatino nuss , foanr dt hwee mSauyr opheaavne tChoamt ona tM rairskke t rbautht etrh maotr ew e tahraen you<br />
tog~ itber in having things that are involved a. id, to that extent, are<br />
at risk, nobody can doubt.<br />
I think It In rather a dlmjadful thing that people like myself<br />
who have been to New Zealand a number of times should havo been there<br />
so little; and I was aho*. ed this afternoon when I can* back from<br />
elbourne to find that this was the first time that you9 ai Minister<br />
for nine years in New lealwa# d and a rime Miister for 18 months<br />
and there is something to be said for 18 monthst you make a note of<br />
that ( Laughter) ares visiting Canberra for the first time. Well nov<br />
' Ir, that is to our discredit9p and to our disadvuntape.<br />
Aiut all I runt to say to you Is thist that you ire here<br />
among people who represent both sides of F rliament who represent all<br />
the Comonwealth ountries, you are hore as a frienA and as a neigtibour*<br />
I hope that you will always tol able to speak to us in forthright,<br />
plain, homely terms as we speak to each other . because ' Lstralia<br />
and New Zealand stand together 01r they f'all Lodether, This IB, of<br />
cooirse, a great chaliertis But It is a treznendo-as honour. It produess<br />
immense, pride in all our minds that when It comes to the point we are<br />
together and we stand, or we fall. todathsr, When you stand and<br />
sucoeed It is a very sreeable thing to hav* ocapany. I used to know<br />
something about that, dhen you dont quite succeed, It Is till a<br />
oomfort to know that you have omany isn't It?<br />
I can say quite simply and plainlyr on behalf of the mebers<br />
or the i~ ov-trnment side of this Parliament and for the oppositlon<br />
members of this Parliament we are at one In lookin, Acroas the Taaan<br />
and thinking of you as our brothers anid u~ s our rriends, Not on saw<br />
tenuouis political zip ement, buit beca'use i . jit down in our lood we<br />
are the same people. Flier. ore we are delighted to welo~ e you. It<br />
unfortunately hasn't turned out to je posible for the Leader of the<br />
Opposition, or for the Depuaty Leador, o Cbe hores they haye very<br />
oopelling engagemonts, Sut I am happy to say that a 11stinzUished<br />
member of the Opposition Liecoutiva, Mr. !, an "' raserv is bore and I am<br />
sure Aill 3up, * rt me when I propose tho loast of your health.<br />
( Applause) </p>
