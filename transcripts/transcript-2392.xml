AUSTRAIJAN TRAkNSPORTATION CONFERENCE<br />
CANBERRA, ACT<br />
S1p etceh rim MiistrMr William McMahon<br />
.24 MARCH_ 1971<br />
M r Chairman, my Ministerial Colleague, Gentlemen:<br />
This is a unique Conference. It is unique in the sense<br />
that it seeks to identify the problems associated with Australia's<br />
surface transport and to attempt to find solutions.<br />
According to the information conveyed to me by one of<br />
Australia's greatest industrialists and captains of transport, there are<br />
thte reasons for this uniqueness.<br />
First, it is difficult to think of any other occasion when<br />
so many leaders of industry and representatives of transport operators<br />
and users have got together to discuss the critical issues involved in<br />
the transportation of goods.<br />
Second the aims and objectives of the Conference are of<br />
fundamental importance. Taking the two reasons together, it is<br />
probable that many ideas will emerge having a direct bearing on the<br />
future of transport development.<br />
And third, you can be as frank as you like and you can<br />
put forward as many suggestions and ideas as you like. They won't be<br />
pigeon-holed. You have my colleague, Mr Nixon's assuranice on that.<br />
The Government will consider the suggestions you have<br />
to make. It is important for y7oiTo be critical and to be constructive.<br />
Now, as to your objective that is of identifying what<br />
are the surface transport problems in Australia today this is an<br />
extremely complicated problem.<br />
You have the task of finding out how goods can be moved<br />
across the length and breadth of tlis vast continent quickly,<br />
efficiently and economically. Everyone in Government and in industry<br />
wants an answer to this problem.<br />
Daily and with growing intensity, the technologist is giving<br />
us new tools to use. The innovators and applied scientists are showing<br />
us how they can be used. Not to be outdone by changes in the vocabulary,<br />
there is a new language too roll-on-roll-off ships, container<br />
transport and flexi-vans. </p>
<p>1<br />
I </p>

Some sectibns of. the Australian transport sytem have made<br />
marked progress; in others there is a tremendous amount to be done.<br />
We hope this Conference will generate ideas about what can be done anid<br />
how we can go about doing it.<br />
You are look ' ing for all the answers t the problems visible<br />
and hidden. We want you to find the answers for as many as practicable.<br />
To crystallise the Government's thinking, we want a<br />
transport system which will serve a nation as it should be served, so<br />
that we can beat the barriers of distance, of mountain and of plain....<br />
and can do so cheaply and efficiently.<br />
I have spoken of technical progress. Much of this has been<br />
the result of a res pcnse by private enterprise the basic system of our<br />
way of life. But the Government is directly involved, too, perhaps more<br />
than many of you realise.<br />
If I may, Sir Ian, I would like to mention briefly one or two<br />
things the Government has done and is doing because I think it is an<br />
example of co-operation between industry and Government; between the<br />
private and public sectors. And this co-operation, in a free enterprise<br />
society, means two things growth and progress.<br />
As to our own part, you know the Government's direct<br />
involvement in sea transport took on a new dimension recently with the<br />
entry of our own line into overseas shipping. This was a return to a<br />
system pioneered and abandoned about half a century ago.<br />
Coinciding with this involvement we are building our own<br />
ships for a variety of purposes and are developing the skills that are<br />
transforming Australia into an increasingly self-reliant country.<br />
In ten years to June, 1970, the Commonwealth has provided<br />
$ 84 million by way of subsidy for Australian shipbuilding. This, I know,<br />
is a good investment and a wise and effective contribution of public funds.<br />
Our other direct involvement in surface transport is through<br />
the Commonwealth Railways which complement the State railway systems<br />
and link East and West.<br />
The Government has contributed significantly to rail<br />
standardisation projects in the States because we recognise that a standard<br />
system is both economical and a unifying force.<br />
In the past ten years the Commonwealth has given $ 99 million<br />
in grants and $ 76 million loans to the' States for this p urpose. /* 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
But the heaviest spending is on roads. This is where the need<br />
is greatest. It was one of my great pleasures as the then Treasurer to<br />
introduce the Commonwealth Aid Roads Bill. Under the Act, the<br />
Government commits funds on a five-year basis for roads and for the<br />
period 1969 to 1974, we are aporopriating 252 million, an increase of<br />
67 per cent on the amount provided in the preceding five years.<br />
This year, taking roads, railways, shipbuilding, navigation<br />
aids and other transport programmes together as a transport<br />
commitment, the Commonwealth will be spending about $ 31A million.<br />
Mr Chairman, spending of this order is part of a long-term<br />
programme. There is so much to be done and the demand continues to<br />
grow insatiably and intensely. Close co-operation between the<br />
Commonwealth and the States is fundamental to success.<br />
Australia is now spanned by a standard gauge railway between<br />
Sydney and Perth. Many improvements are still needed on the railway<br />
networks. Our beef roads are opening up new pastoral lands. Here, too,<br />
the job is unfinished.<br />
The changes in ship design and in cargo handling have led to<br />
modernisation of our ports. Here, too, there is still work to be done.<br />
We live in an environment of large bulk carriers and specialised<br />
general cargo ships. If we are to be successful this demands management<br />
practices and technical excellence of the highest order. I am sure yc'lx<br />
have the qualifications. Now Sir, may I speak about transport costs the critical<br />
factor for everyone Inflation feeds on rising costs. Freight rates are<br />
a significant factor in costs. You know the problem just as well as I<br />
do. May I turn to one aspect of it.<br />
The problem of the man on the land, who cannot pass on<br />
increases in freights, is well known to us all. Today the farmer is badly<br />
hit by rising freights. So too are others. In this sense it is a national<br />
problem. If we contain rises in freights and better still reduce them<br />
then the burden of rising costs would be lighter. Whilst the problem<br />
is one of immense complexity, we know of your capacity and are looking<br />
to you to find out the ways and means of finding a solution. / 4 </p>
<p>Not so long ago, in order to honour an election promise, the<br />
Govermnent took the first steps to establish a Bureau of Transport<br />
Economics. A Director has been appointed and for the time being,<br />
in a restrained way, staff is being recruited.<br />
The Bureau's main function will be to study and report on the<br />
costs ) f transport operations in Australia and to suggest what can be<br />
done to help reduce costs.<br />
Gentlemen, for the next two days you will be putting under the<br />
microscope the transportation philosophies and policies of both the private<br />
sector and government.<br />
I conclude in this vein we do want your help. In saying that,<br />
I am not passing the problem from Government to you.<br />
We will continue to do all we can through the Budget, through<br />
the Department of Shipping and Transport through the new Bureau and<br />
in co-operation with the States at all levels.<br />
We will co-operate with industry wherever we can, according<br />
to our powers and responsibilities.<br />
Gentlemen, I do wish you success with your Conference... and<br />
I now declare it open.<br />
