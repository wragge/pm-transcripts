<p>[ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OMITTED]</p>
<p>On this day of sadness and farewell, we hear many stories and many voices.</p>
<p>We've heard from Peter, supported by Andrew, Geoff, Gary and Roger - the five sons who Joan brought up on her own with such love and determination.</p>
<p>We've heard from Robert Ray, a giant of the modern Labor Party who saw in Joan a colleague to be respected.</p>
<p>And now, I share these words with you as one of the women who walked through the door that Joan so brilliantly opened.</p>
<p>Female representation in federal politics came late for our Party  -  1974.</p>
<p>Well into the 20thcentury, Labor embodied the “Australian legend” of shearers and dockworkers bonded in a spirit of male mateship.</p>
<p>It took a remarkable woman to break the mould  -  and Joan Child was that woman.</p>
<p>For Joan, the Labor ethos was etched deep in her soul.</p>
<p>She didn't need to be told of it or read it in a book.</p>
<p>Everything about her life and experience spoke of this belief.</p>
<p>She'd worked in a factory. She'd worked as cleaner.</p>
<p>She'd raised these five boys alone.</p>
<p>And when she came to public life as candidate in 1972, she'd already lived a full life, so when electoral success came her way eighteen months later, she was ready.</p>
<p>At the outset, Joan Child began her political journey as she meant to continue it  -  on her terms.</p>
<p>When the news photographers came to her house, Joan refused to adopt the domestic poses that previous female MPs had adopted  -  baking a cake, holding the vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>Joan saw the danger and put it astutely to one side.</p>
<p>Instead she raised a glass of champagne to Gough's remarkable re-election, and that was the photo that beamed out from the pages of the press.</p>
<p>Bold, defiant, and just a little bit cheeky.</p>
<p>That is not to say Joan wasn't proud of her accomplishments as a mother or of her lovely home and garden, or wasn't careful as to her presentation and dress  -  she was.</p>
<p>Joan had understated style and class in all these things.</p>
<p>But she never let them define her.</p>
<p>This was a woman determined to be judged on her character, not on her gender.</p>
<p>And always, always  -  Joan was a proud daughter of the Labor movement.</p>
<p>She was an activist.</p>
<p>She understood that Australian politics is essentially and fundamentally a contest of values.</p>
<p>Joan was faithful to those values in the good times and the bad.</p>
<p>And no days we were worse than 11 November 1975 and the election to follow when Joan, like Bill Morrison who we also mourn at this time, lost her seat.</p>
<p>Yet like Bill, Joan returned to the arena.</p>
<p>She finally made it back in 1980, and this decade was Joan's finest time.</p>
<p>The time of her Speakership.</p>
<p>The time when Joan's face and voice became familiar to Australians.</p>
<p>The time when our belief that women can do anything finally began to be realised in our nation's institutions.</p>
<p>The women like Joan didn't have a guide book.</p>
<p>Instead they wrote it.</p>
<p>That is why we can say today that Joan left us many gifts:</p>
<p>Her spirit of service to the Parliament and the people.</p>
<p>Her faith in the Labor cause.</p>
<p>Her ambition for her electorate and the nation, especially in terms of how we care for the disadvantaged and people with disabilities.</p>
<p>But most importantly of all, Joan gave us her example.</p>
<p>The example of a smart, confident woman succeeding in the public sphere.</p>
<p>Not only succeeding against the odds but resetting those odds for those who came in her footsteps.</p>
<p>Through it all, Joan seamlessly blended toughness and kindness, and with her beloved Hawks, her Elvis recordings, her books and her garden, Joan remained - resolutely, calmly, refreshingly - normal.</p>
<p>Today we bear witness as the Labor tribe, we gather to mourn one of our own - one of our best.</p>
<p>And as Australians, we acknowledge a woman who believed that our nation's creed or fairness and opportunity must also have space for women, must also have space for her too.</p>
<p>By any measure, Joan Child had a remarkable life.</p>
<p>In its balance of struggle and achievement, it was a life we could recognise as a fortunate life.</p>
<p>A life of meaning and purpose.</p>
<p>A life long in years but short in regret.</p>
<p>After 91 summers, that life is now over.</p>
<p>Joan's body, weakened by frailty and age, has found its rest.</p>
<p>But this proud Labor matriarch, this model and mentor, will long live on in our hearts and hold an honoured place in our nation's story forever.</p>
