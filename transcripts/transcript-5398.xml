REPORT BY A COMMONWEALTE GROUP OF EXPERTS<br />
The Commonwealth Secretariat in London has released a<br />
Report entitled " The World Economic Crisis: A Comnmonwealth<br />
Perspective" written by a Commonwealth Group of Experts.<br />
The Group of Experts was established following my suggestion<br />
for a study on the constraints to growth at the Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government Meeting in Lusaka in Zambia in 1979.<br />
The Report provides insights into many of the critical problems<br />
facing the world today, and constitutes a useful additionl<br />
to the debate on issues of growth and world development.<br />
Coming soon after the publication of the Brandt Commission<br />
Report on North/ South issues, the Commonwealth Experts Group<br />
Report will provide further stimulus for consideration of major<br />
world economic issues.<br />
The Report includes many recommendations on specific<br />
measures by which developed and developing countries might act<br />
to reduce or eliminate constraints to growth and<br />
structural change, which will be carefully studied by<br />
the Government.<br />
The Group of Experts was ably chaired by Professor H. W. Arndt,<br />
Economics Professor in the Research School of Pacific-Studies,<br />
at the Australian National University.<br />
I extend my warm appreciation to him for carrying out that<br />
role and for his valuable participation in the Group.<br />
