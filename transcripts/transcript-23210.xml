    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today we celebrate the country we love and the values that underpin it. We also celebrate those in our community who represent the very best of our country.</p>
<p>Four outstanding Australians were honoured today as part of the Australian of the Year Awards for 2014.</p>
<p>I am pleased to have presented AFL footballer Mr Adam Goodes with his award for Australian of the Year 2014.</p>
<p>Mr Goodes is a role model for many Australians and demonstrates a commitment to fairness and equalityÂ both on and off the field. He is a passionate advocate for Indigenous issues and has shown leadership in the fight against racism.</p>
<p>Today we also honour the work of Fred Chaney AO as the 2014 Senior Australian of the Year. A former Federal Minister, Mr Chaney has a long history of public service and a commitment to reconciliation and improving opportunities for Indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>Australiaâs 2012 Paralympian of the Year Jacqueline Freney continues to add to her extraordinary record of achievement and today was named the Young Australian of the Year 2014.</p>
<p>Since 1998 Mr Tim Conolan has assisted more than four million children and their families through his charity <em>TLC for Kids</em>. This has earned him the well-deserved honour of Australiaâs Local Hero 2014.</p>
<p>Australians should look to the recipients of this yearâs Australian of the Year awards as examples of our nation at its best.</p>
<p>I am confident all of the winners will use the next year to bring attention and focus to their individual passions.</p>
