THE LATE MR TOWNLEY<br />
Tribute By The Prime Minister. Sir Robert Menziesq<br />
This is a grievous blow to me, to my colleagues, and<br />
to Australia. Athol Townley was a man of marked ability and<br />
of notable and unselfish service to his country. But, above<br />
all, he was a man of great spirit and honour, a warm-hearted<br />
friend and a trusted companion.<br />
I feel more distressed than I can say, for my own<br />
loss is a sad one. His wife and son will be in all our hearts<br />
and minds, for theirs, in a personal sense, is the greatest<br />
loss. I hope they will be consoled by the recollection of<br />
Atholts service tt Australia.<br />
