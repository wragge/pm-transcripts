CONFERENCE OF AUSTRALIAN UNIVERSITIES<br />
at Sydnay. 1_ 926__ 6<br />
att nRG ens<br />
Speechby the Prime inister, the Rt. HoRG._ Men,.<br />
Mr. Chancellor, Mr. Chairman, gentlemen:<br />
It is quite true that today is for me, or this few<br />
minutes will be for me, an interlude. Last night I was engaged<br />
in the complexities of the European Common Market, and when I get<br />
back to Canberra after lunch I will no doubt resume thoze<br />
complexities; only to find that before the Test Match is<br />
completed I will be involved in the complexities of the Budget<br />
Debate. So you can imagine that it is something to come away from<br />
it all and to see such a distinguished collection of people<br />
gathered together for so magnificent a purpose, a purpose of which<br />
Iwill say something in a moment.<br />
I should explain to you that these unearned increments<br />
of mine, these Honorary Doctorates tiat I seem to have been<br />
collecting around the world involve one embarrassment. Whenever<br />
I attend something and they say " Academic Dress" of course I must<br />
be glorious and wear a Doctor's gown. But in what capacity shall<br />
I masquerade? Well that problem has been solved for me because<br />
although 12 or 13 Universities around the world have made me a<br />
Doctor, and I had occasionally got away with a hood, the only<br />
time I ever got amay with a gown was in Queensland. ( Laughter,<br />
applause) And even then hen the gown was delivered to me, and<br />
finally unpacked in Canberra, it had the bill for it at the<br />
bottom of the box3" Laughter) But I am bound to say to my<br />
friend, Dr. Schonell that I haven't taken the bill seriously.<br />
( Laughter) I am wailing to sou whether in due course a rather<br />
curt little communication arrives, named Account Rendered. If<br />
that happens I shall have to do something about it.<br />
But when I come here the Vice-Chancellor of the Sydney<br />
University is good enough to lend me his Bristol gown, which I am<br />
just as much entitled to wear as he is; but which he happens to<br />
own, This is a matter of contention between the two of us. I<br />
always say to him, " How did you get away with a gown? After all<br />
the great Winston Churchill invested me, and then took it back".<br />
Put he got away with it. And the result is that when I come down<br />
here I just have a message sent forward " Bristol please", And<br />
of course he is shrewd enough to know that I am referring to the<br />
gown and not to sherry.<br />
This Conference is, I think, one of enormous<br />
significance. All of us ho have been concerned about tertiary<br />
education you, intimately from the inside of University affairs;<br />
and I, as a very friendly outsider have all been exercised in<br />
our minds, I think, about the future. In one sense, in a very<br />
important senseo, it is a oreat thing that in Australia there<br />
should be so many more thousands, year by year, anxious to have<br />
Univrsity experience, and to achieve a univeLsity training.<br />
That is a very, very good thing. But from the point of view of<br />
practical administrators, and even from the point of view of<br />
practical politicians, the prospect of coping, decade after<br />
d,, cade, with so many more thousands, and thereby incurring all the<br />
responsibility in the completing of present universities, and the<br />
creating of now ones, is a tremendous problem,<br />
I may tell you that I have heard it said in political<br />
circles, even in the purlious of the Cabinet, that the<br />
Universities will need to make more effective use of what they<br />
have if these numbers are to be coped with within the reasonab. e<br />
limits of Budgets and materials. That, I think, is very true.<br />
The day has ; one by when we can jo along quiatl: y the day has<br />
certainly, I am proud to say, gone by when universities have to </p>
<p>live from day to day or if not from day to day at any rate from<br />
year to year. In my own university days I am perfectly certain that<br />
the authorities of the University of Melbourne had no idea as to<br />
how much money they might have next year; it was enough to cope<br />
with the problems of this year. From tine to time they went<br />
along to the Premier of the day and did their best to extract from<br />
him another œ 10,000, œ 20,000. I remember one Premier who said,<br />
" Yes, I'll give you œ X, 000 more on the grant provided you make a<br />
certain anprtaYment." WIell that is not a very satisfactory state of<br />
affairs. But it merely illustrates how two things coincided: the<br />
major dependence of universities on Governments; and their<br />
inability to know, in any one year, what they could plan for in<br />
the following year Because of this, because of the enormous<br />
post-war demand for university training, and after a few years of<br />
special grants worked out on a fairly arbitrary basis, which I<br />
began in 1950, I myself came to the conclusion that there ought to<br />
be something more forward looking, taking a longer view, taking a<br />
broader view. And so we established the Murray Cormmission.<br />
Sor. e of you before today have heard me say that the<br />
Murray Cormmission appointrent represented a certain -amount of<br />
sleight of hand on my own part. I don't think anybody else<br />
realised that you couldn't have a pow,-rful committee investigating<br />
the condition of the Universities in ZAustralia without having<br />
recommendations that would involve very large sums of money. My<br />
experience has been that when something is going to involve a very<br />
large sun of money, you want to deal with it on the highest<br />
po. s'ibl. lovel, and get people to accpt a certain number of really<br />
first-class ideas before you cone down to tile sordid question of<br />
cash, That is what happened. I saw Sir Keith Murray in London and<br />
asked him to conme He said he would if the Chancellor of the<br />
Exchequer would allow him. I saw the then Chancellor who was Mr.<br />
Harold Macmillan, and he agreed. Then I knew that all that was<br />
needed was for the committee that he presided over to make an<br />
investigation, and make a report and something would happen<br />
provided the Australian Chancellor of the Exchequer proved to be<br />
agreeable. As I don't need to remind you, the first result, one of<br />
the results that perhaps the outsider doesn't appreciate to the<br />
full, was that it looked at the problem in relation to a 3-year<br />
term: it wanted to create a financial state of affairs in which<br />
people could plan forward, Now you may not realise . s clearly as<br />
I do i-yself chat this i. s in the toetii of all traditional Budget<br />
practices. The Budget is an annual Budget; the Treasury very<br />
properly and very spiritedly takes the greatest possible<br />
exception to cormitting future Budgets and as for getting a 3-year<br />
y . a ij. . o p<br />
iaounts of money, this is alumot anathema. But; in Gcis ca~ s wr;.<br />
got away with it and the first triennium went into operation. It<br />
involved a trer: ondous increase in the CommQonwealth financial<br />
responsibility. From 1950 to 1957 1950 being the first year in<br />
which there was a State Grants ( Universities) Bill we found a<br />
total of œ l116 millions. The first trionniium of the Mi:? urr. y<br />
Report which was, of course, adopted by us, meant that in 3 years<br />
the amount was to be just under œ 22mo Now compared to the total<br />
cost of maintaining a proper university structure in Australia<br />
that perhaps is no very grLat sum because the State Governments<br />
themselves have boon called on to find larger amounts of money in<br />
their turn. Then we appointed the Comruission under Sir Leslie Martin.<br />
He is, I have no doubt, regarded by the Universities as a little<br />
bit on the cheese-paring side, a little bit niggly over a mere<br />
matter of a million or two, I can assure you that when he comes to<br />
see me at Canborra he looks three ways to see that there are no<br />
Treasury officials aoout because he knows that they regard him as </p>
<p>the most extravagant r. mn we ever had attached to a Conmomnwealth<br />
instrumentality. Therefore I tnink I might say that while he has<br />
no hope of unbridled popularity, he has, in his present position,<br />
a narvellous opportunity for reconciling demand and supply, for<br />
constantly reminding the political arm of the immense importance<br />
of university training and, at the sane time, occasionally<br />
reminding professors, particularly professors of science, that<br />
there is such a thing as a Budget, that money has to be brought<br />
from:.. oamewh: e. So I regard him as performing a very great<br />
public service. When his Commission sat it produced its reco m-endations<br />
totalling very nearly œ 41m. for a second triennium.<br />
Now there is one other fact that is worth having in<br />
mind. Before the war the university populations in Australia<br />
were not very great. After the war there was a sudden<br />
burgeoning of demand for higher education: the universities<br />
became crowded; probably because of the shortage of facilities,<br />
the excessive size of classes and so on, the failure rate,<br />
particularly in first year, becajei very disturbing. But the<br />
population continued to grow. Sir Keith Murray thought that he<br />
was being a little extravagant when he estimated in 1957 when the<br />
university population was 30,000 odd, that it would rise to<br />
48,000 by 1960 and to 71,000 by 1965. This was an enormous<br />
prospect. The fact of course was that in 1960 the population<br />
wasn't 48,000; it was 53,000, And the estimate now made and<br />
I don't think it is at all extravagant for 1965 is 90,000.<br />
This has produced a probl wahich I believe is one of your great<br />
purposes here to consider.<br />
Is it reasonably to be supposed that we can go on the<br />
well-trodden paths, maintain our original and somewhat orthodox<br />
conception of a university, and at the sane time cope with<br />
university populations of this kind? Because this, of course,<br />
will mean enormous expenditures, It doesn't follow that<br />
Governrments in future will necessarily take the same vioew of<br />
these matters as my own Government. You can't gamble on that.<br />
There will be, we know, tremendous demands. Consequently we<br />
began to discuss I did r. yself with Sir Leslie and with his<br />
Conrrission whether there was a possibility, in fact a demand,<br />
for a review of the structure of tertiary education, to see<br />
whether it can be made more diversified, whether every<br />
univuersity, every tertiary establishnent called a university<br />
ought to be pursuing the sane lines of study, and doing the sane<br />
kind of things, and achieving the sane results. This is an<br />
enormously difficult problem,<br />
They have, as yo-. i know, established in England a<br />
Conittec to investigate this, having regard to the nods and<br />
resources of the nation, I expect within a day or two now to<br />
announce the appointment of a Committee in Australia which will<br />
perform a similar function. I was delighted when I found that<br />
you were having this Conference this unique Conference, because<br />
it seemed to me that the subjects that you had taken for<br />
discussion and indeed the paper is already distributed had a<br />
profound bearing on this very matter, and that the Comittee that<br />
will come into existence ought to achieve immenso benefit from<br />
the results of your work.<br />
But if you will allow me to say so, there are two<br />
things I would suggest to you. A Conference occasionally<br />
attracts a distinguished collection of ninds: it has the lost<br />
valuable discussions; it has its records prepared and it<br />
dissolves Somebody reads the report; somebody reads the<br />
record; somebody else doesn t. It all tends then, to sag a<br />
little. I believe that you are meeting to discuss matters which<br />
. must produce a genuine impetus and a continuing impetus if these </p>
<p>problems are to be solved with wisdom all over Australia. So I<br />
would like to think that after this great Conference finishes<br />
you would think fit, perhaps, to establish a few working parties<br />
to follow up some of the things that you will have discussed, to<br />
develop then, to be in a position to bring before the Colmmittee<br />
that is going to be appointed, the results of your studyo<br />
I firnly believe that you are going to discuss a<br />
problon, that this Committee is going to examine a probloe of<br />
the utmost complexity. It is one not to be solved by any casual<br />
onlooker but only by having people who know this business from<br />
the inside and who have a sense of responsibility for the future,<br />
putting their brains to it and continuing by some such method as<br />
I have suggested, to pursue their oxaL. inations and to push<br />
forward their results.<br />
Ag. n, of course and it is unnecessary to say this to<br />
you, but I s3y it because there are Vice-Chancellors present<br />
the Universities themselves have an im.: ense responsibility in<br />
this field. They can't leave this just to a Coiir. itteo; they<br />
can't leave this just to a body of advisers. I know perfectly<br />
well that they realise that there is a great problem of<br />
organisation in front of then, the constant search for nore<br />
efficiency, the better use of resources.<br />
There is another aspect 3f all this and it is the<br />
only other matter that I wanted to say snmething to you about.<br />
There is a great disposition in our country to think of<br />
everything, evaluate everything in terlns of noney. ' All you need<br />
to do' and " you" always means the Cormonwealth I suppose ' is<br />
to find œ X millions and theproblem is over'. That, of course, as<br />
you all know, is not true. I can't cormit my successors but I<br />
believe m-yself that the social conscience of Australia will<br />
require Governments to go on finding physical resources, noney<br />
and otherwise, for the development of tertiary education, I<br />
haven't the slightest doubt that that is so. But the problem<br />
that concerns ny mind much more is whether those universities of<br />
the future, con. anding these resources, will be able to maintain<br />
the academic standards that have hitherto obtained. This is a<br />
tremendous problem.<br />
In 1959 the total academic staff in the Universities of<br />
the States was 3,392. It is nou estimated that by 1966 which is<br />
not far off, that number will have to be increased by 3 613. In<br />
other words hero, in a period of five or six years we will need<br />
more than to double the existing numbers of academic staffs in<br />
tertiary education. This is not easy. Even to me, a layman, it<br />
seems to present the most formidable difficulties.<br />
Because here you are, University people, teachers,<br />
researchers, people who have found your vocation in this great<br />
occupation and every one of you, from time to time, in the still<br />
watchos of the night, . ust ponder over the future of the<br />
University that you are attached to; its future standards, the<br />
maintenance of the highest possible quality in the teacher so<br />
that the highest possible product nay be obtained in graduating<br />
students. You don't get that result just by having enough<br />
money. It is well for us to renreber that we are living in a<br />
world, the population of which will more than double between now<br />
and the turn of the century and that as the standards of living<br />
rise, particularly in the groat new countries, there is going to<br />
be a greater and greater demand for universities and for<br />
university teaching. So our prospects : ff, so to speak, buying<br />
additional people from the rest of the we rld is not a very rich<br />
one. Some people will be attracted here. I hope so. I believe </p>
<p>so. But in the long run we will be thrown on our own resources.<br />
to a major extent. That oeans that our universities thioselves<br />
must produce these teachers, these professors and lecturers of<br />
the future. And if they are second class then before long the<br />
university itself will be third class. Deliver us fron having<br />
in Australi a a sries of second-rate hones of learning,<br />
It will be a tragdy for Australia if, as a result of<br />
university dovelop: i. ent, we dn't produce, year by year, out of<br />
our universities people who are not just qualified to earn a good<br />
incone, but people who have the heart of learning in their<br />
minds, who go on learning, who have the scholar's habit even<br />
though they nay be engaged in some highly practical undertaking<br />
as the world would see it. The standard must go up. We must<br />
not have a sort of GroshrLm's law applying. That means not just<br />
that we want 3,600 -ore academic staff; it means that we want<br />
3,600 first-class poorle for the academic staffs; people of<br />
individuality and learning and enthusiasm and who will,<br />
therefore, produce their own kind out of their class rooms in<br />
Clue course. So, Sir, these are great and difficult problems. I<br />
believo that they will all be solved. But the first thing to do<br />
is for all of us to recognise that the problems exist. We must<br />
make better use of what we hove. ! eo must seo that whatever we<br />
can get in future is related properly to our basic conception of<br />
what the particular students need to get. Above all things, we<br />
need to make it quite plain that for the universities of the<br />
future, and for the old ones as they continue, the standard must<br />
be nothing lower than the best.<br />
You know every one of you has been an undergraduate;<br />
every one of you can look back on some professor you sat under,<br />
some teacher you sat under. I find the greatest pleasure in<br />
looking back on some of the men who helped to fashion mo, to<br />
realise that they were not only men of learning, but men of great<br />
character and quality. They are the people who make a<br />
university; they are the people who maintain in the conmunity,<br />
increasingly, a sense of pride in the university. If people<br />
have that pride, and arc determined that it is to be maintained<br />
during their lifetimes, I believe that you needn't worry about<br />
the community reaction to what may need to be done. The great<br />
things to be done, the kind of thing that you are hero to discuss<br />
is to see that the quality is upheld, that ways and means are<br />
discovered of not wasting talent, but of employing it to the<br />
highest possible extent for what I believe to be the greatest<br />
educational task that this country confronts.<br />
Sir I declare the Conference open. ( Applause) </p>
