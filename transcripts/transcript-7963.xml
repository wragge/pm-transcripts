PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH DOUG AITON, 3L0, MELBOURNE,<br />
1S MARCH, 1990. PROOF ONLY<br />
AITON: Good to See you again. How are you feeling with, what is<br />
it, ten days to go I suppose?<br />
PM: I feel very well thanks Doug.<br />
AITON: Has it been one of the tough ones for you?<br />
PM: Well it's a very important election and I'm not being<br />
complacent about It# but in terms of impact upon me, it's<br />
probably been easier than most because we haven't had so many<br />
night functions and they're pretty draining things, you know, you<br />
have hundreds of people there and I try and shake hands with them<br />
all, a lot of autographs, and there hasn't been so many of those.<br />
It's been easier in that respect.<br />
AXTON: I can't understand why you say it is the most important<br />
election since 1949, 1 think you have articulated this, but I<br />
would've thought 1972 was far more important for the direction of<br />
this country. Not because Labor won but because it was a<br />
watershed year.<br />
PM: Well yes, I've been making a point in this sense Doug, that<br />
I think it will determine the sort of Australia we take into the<br />
twenty-first century and I think it's terribly important. I<br />
mean obviously you can argue about other elections but I really<br />
do believe it's important because we're going to determine, for<br />
instance, If you look at the area of how we tax ourselves, it'.<br />
going to be whether we continue to have a country in which the<br />
rich do pay tax or whether we go back to the country that was<br />
talked about before by Professor Matthews where he said it was<br />
.4ust a matter of choice whether the rich paid tax. The<br />
-' abolition of the capital gains tax would mean it would be a<br />
matter of choice and I think that's terribly important because<br />
we've got to have the billions of dollars that come from making<br />
sure that people who can afford to pay do pay so that we can<br />
upend on the aorts of things we need to make this a better<br />
country. And environmentally too I think it's terribly important<br />
because if you look at all the important decisions that I've / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
taken with my colleagues in Government, all those important ones<br />
were opposed by an Opposition, which you've got to remember is<br />
nlot just the Liberal Party but the National Party, and they are<br />
environmental vandals.<br />
AITON: If you lose this election, which seems possible, I mean<br />
I think it's going to be close, moot people think it's going to<br />
be close, do you not?<br />
PH, I'm not cocky or complacent about it. X think we'll win but<br />
I'll be fighting right down to midnight on Friday night.<br />
AITON: Well certainly the opinion polls at the moment would have<br />
you drawing away, you and the Government drawing away, but if you<br />
do lose, I would imagine it will be basically because, if we take<br />
from 1983 from which time you've been Prime Minister, people are<br />
hurting now most of all.<br />
PM1 Some people have been hurt, that's right, by the tight<br />
monetary policy that we've had to have, because if I hadn't had a<br />
tight monetary policy the economy would've absolutely collapsed.<br />
We couldn't afford to keep sucking in the level of imports that<br />
we were, that high level of activity, and that would've destroyed<br />
the economy. So I concede that some people have obviously been<br />
hurt Doug, by those high interest policies, but I think they<br />
understand. Hawke's been around in public life now thirty years<br />
and I think they know that I'm not a mug. I mean I wouldn't do<br />
it to hurt myself and I certainly wouldn't do it to hurt ordinary<br />
Australians. It's been necessary to slow things down and it's<br />
because we've been successful now in gradually slowing down the<br />
level of activity that I'm confident that interest rates can come<br />
down and importantly the banking industry is saying that. So I<br />
think that they're going to put these things in the perspective.<br />
AXTON: I think the nature of being an Australian has changed<br />
during the 1980'., and rightly or wrongly you'll be blamed, your<br />
Government will be blamed for the fact that young people can no<br />
longer assume that if they get out there, leave school, get a job<br />
and work, they can got a house.<br />
PM: But let's go back one step. I'll be remembered an the, in<br />
respect of young people, as the bloke who inherited a country<br />
whej" after seven years of conservative government there'd be no<br />
change in the rate at which kids stayed on in school. It went<br />
from thirty four percent to thirty six percent in their seven<br />
years. One in three of our kids stayed on in school. After<br />
seven years of Hawke there's nearly two in three of our kids<br />
staying on in school now. There couldn't be anything more / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
fundamental in terms of the importance of the future of our<br />
children that we have them staying on in school. Not only have<br />
them staying on in school but a wide range of training and retraining<br />
programs as well, and importantly, we've created jobs<br />
for them. In the last twelve months before I became Prime<br />
Minister, another quarter of a million people thrown onto the<br />
unemployment scrap-heap, including most particularly our young<br />
people. Now I've created job. five times faster than they were<br />
created before, twice as fast as the rest of the world. So the<br />
kids are a) being educated, b) trained , and c) have got jobs<br />
available. RITONo But they're worried about buying houses still.<br />
PM; Sure, but they take the view I believe that the most<br />
important thing is that they be educated and that they get a job.<br />
And of course, let's remember about houses. we've built houses<br />
at a much higher rate than under our predecessors. We have built<br />
houses, the commencement rate of houses over our period in office<br />
has been ten percent per annum higher than under the<br />
conservatives. AITONs There's on e other area, or a couple of other areas<br />
concerning money that I think people are angry about. I do think<br />
that young people are terribly angry about the fact that they<br />
can't assume that thing about buying houses and this is what I<br />
notice moving around talking to people away from this radio<br />
station. And I notice the matter of income tax, specifically<br />
income tax. Now I know that the Hawke Government has achieved<br />
quite a lot as far as reforming the taxation system overall is<br />
concerned. But I think it's fair to say that still the rich are<br />
avoiding paying tax.<br />
PMs Absolutely untrue, absolutely untrue.<br />
AITON: Why? Why do you say that?<br />
PM: Well for the very simple reason that we have brought in the<br />
instruments to make sure that they do. But on the question of<br />
the rich avoiding tax, let me just give you the quote Doug that<br />
was made at the end of the Conservatives' period of office by<br />
Pro~ geosor Matthews. Be said then, " the essential problem is to<br />
Make the rich pay any income tax at all.' That's what he said<br />
then. And do you know why the fundamental reason that we weren't<br />
paying tax was the absence of a capital gains tax. They could<br />
so arrange their affairs that they could channel their activities<br />
into the accretion of capital assets which were then un-taxed. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Now I've donte these things. l've brought in the capital gains<br />
tax, we've brought in the fringe benefits tax and we have brought<br />
in the tax on entertainment where they could deduct their<br />
entertainment allowances before. Now it's just recognised,<br />
recognised by every tax expert in the country, that now, as a<br />
result of those three things, and particularly the capital gains<br />
tax, that the rich are now no longer in Australia in the position<br />
that they were described by Matthews, it was a matter of choice<br />
whether they paid tax.<br />
AITON: There was one report, I think it was from the Social<br />
Policy Research Centre at the University of Noew South Wales, it<br />
doesn't really matter where it was from, but it said that the tax<br />
system still discouraged saving by taxing interest on savings at<br />
the full marginal rate without allowing for inflation. The<br />
example they gave was therefore someone saving for a house gets<br />
fourteen percent interest on the savings but because of seven<br />
percent inflation they end up getting nothing.<br />
PH: The whole question of inflation and interest has been<br />
examined. Hr Peacock, you remember, dashed off on his mini<br />
campaign last year saying that he was going to bring in a system<br />
of allowing deductions. Of course when his people examine it as<br />
I've had Treasury examine it, and you've got to look at both<br />
sides, you're taking account of inflation and interest on both<br />
the income side and the cost side, it is full of complexities and<br />
the advice from all the independent sources are that it can't be<br />
done. Now on the question of savings, the most important single<br />
thing that we've done to encourage savings in this country is<br />
what we've done in regard to superannuation. When we came into<br />
office the superannuation funds were seventeen billion dollars.<br />
They're now up to a hundred billion dollars and it'. estimated by<br />
the end of this decade it'll be between six and seven hundred<br />
billion. Now what we are doing in we've made, as distinct from<br />
the situation when we came to office that superannuation was the<br />
preserve of the minority, by making it an award provision now,<br />
we've got employers paying for their employees fifteen dollars<br />
every week now into superannuation for each employee, over the<br />
next three years there'll be another fifteen dollars. Now that<br />
will be thirty dollars a week being paid into superannuation.<br />
Now that's going to accumulate a vast mass of savings, we've<br />
given favourable taxation treatment for this, and that means that<br />
not. 4. only will it be important from the point of view of<br />
individuals but from the point of view of the country we're going<br />
to be accumulating savings upon which industry can draw, rather<br />
than having to borrow overseasa.<br />
AITON: Are you saying that the rich people of this country are<br />
now paying as much income tax as you, a Labor Prime Minister,<br />
would like to see them paying? </p>
<p>I'm saying that yes, that we have made sure that they pay.<br />
We have brought in a situation where we've brought down the top<br />
rate, the top rate was sixty cents in the dollar when we came in.<br />
The reason why the top rate was sixty cents in the dollar was<br />
that all the ordinary mugs, the wage and salary earners were<br />
paying their tax but the people with the greatest capacity<br />
weren't paying because of the absence of a capital gains tax.<br />
Having brought that in, and the fringe benefits tax, we've been<br />
able to reduce the rates of tax from sixty down to forty seven<br />
and the bottom rate from thirty to twenty one, which is much more<br />
equitable. But what of course is being proposed by Hr Peacock<br />
now, with him two-tier system which would cost 2.8 billion<br />
dollars, is to give a tax break of twenty cento a week, twenty<br />
cents a week, to the bloke on seventeen thousand, and the bloke<br />
on seventy thousand , fifty eight dollars a week cut. That's the<br />
sort of concept of equity in regard to income tax and at the same<br />
time take ot'f capital gains tax so they'll put billions of<br />
dollars back, out of the public revenue into the pockets of the<br />
wealthiest loe than one percent of taxpayers.<br />
AXTON: It you win this election on the other hand, I was saying<br />
if you lose it it'll be because people are hurting more than they<br />
ever have since you've been Prime Minister, if you win you're<br />
going to actually overtake the Labor record set by a combination<br />
of John Curtin and Ren Chifley from 1941-1949. 1 think you'll<br />
overtake that next year. I suppose that's come into your<br />
calculation. PM8 I believe Doug that I'm the best equipped to lead the Labor<br />
Party now. If I didn't believe that I would've stood down. I<br />
think I'm the best equipped to lead it and importantly, that's<br />
not my judgement but more importantly it'. the judgement of the<br />
Labor Party, I have the unanimous support of all my colleagues<br />
as distinct from the bitterness and hatred on the other side of<br />
politics. I wonder whether r could just share are we allowed<br />
to swap radio programs?<br />
AITON: Sure.<br />
PHI I just came across the transcript of something that happened<br />
earlier this week on.. can I mention A rival?<br />
AXTON: Yes.<br />
PM: On Chippy's program.<br />
AITON: On 3AK. 0 ./ 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
PM: Yes, and he had John Howard on. Can I just read you this<br />
very, very interesting Proposition. He said, this is Chippy: " my<br />
research shows that the Prime Minister told you in the Houce<br />
three Weeks before the Peacock coup that he the Prime Minister<br />
had been informed of the plot against you, but at that stage Mr<br />
Peacock had thirty-four votes and was rising." Well I did do<br />
that. " Now given your committment", said Chippy to John Rowardo<br />
given your committment to spurn humbug which you already said<br />
and for which people admired you, I ask you simply this question.<br />
Do you still believe", this is a question to John Howard, " do you<br />
still believe, in view of the Prime Minister's knowledge three<br />
weeks before the coup, do you still believe Mr Peacock when he<br />
continues to assert that he only knew of the move a couple of<br />
days in advance of when he was drafted?" And John Howard's<br />
immortal reply, " Well Don, again, I'll spurn humbug and say that<br />
the beat thing I can do for the Liberal Party in an election<br />
Campaign is to refuse to answer questions on that subject".<br />
Which Don gave the obvious observation, there's only one<br />
inference you can draw from the reply John". g o I make the<br />
point, I've got the unanimous support of my colleagues for the<br />
leadership and here in this second last week of the campaign you<br />
have John Howard virtually saying that he doesn't believe that<br />
Andrew Peacock is telling the truth about the processes by which<br />
he John Howard warn kicked out of the leadership of the Liberal<br />
Party.<br />
AITON: We'll go to some callers in a moment. A lot of people<br />
are hanging on hoping to talk to you. I ' vs got a couple of other<br />
questions. I reckon it might be won or lost in Victoria.<br />
PM8 Yes but that assumes that the rest of Australia doesn't<br />
matter, that nobody else<br />
AITON: No I'm not saying it doesn't matter.<br />
PM: But I wasn't trying to be pernickity7 in saying that. I<br />
mean you're quite right Doug in saying that Victoria's important,<br />
and I'm not denying the fact that we've probably got, in respect<br />
of some of our seats, our hardest fight in Victoria. But the<br />
point I'm making to you is that we are I think going to win seats<br />
in Queensland and Tasmania, could do also in New South Wales, I<br />
th~ k we're going to hold all our seats in Western Australia. So<br />
let me assume that we might have difficulty in holding a couple<br />
of our seats. I think we'll hold them here in Victoria but I do<br />
concede it's a bit more difficult here. But I'm simply saying to<br />
you that the other things that are happening around Australia can<br />
offset, and more than offset, if you take the worst case scenario<br />
in Victoria about losing some seats. / 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
AXTON! Well what I was going to may in that if the crunch is<br />
going to be felt in Victoria, it seems odd to me that the<br />
Coalition seems to have a better campaign going in Victoria at<br />
the moment. Their advertising seems to be slicker than that of<br />
the Labor Party.<br />
PMs: That's not what's been said to me, anid may Z say, we've<br />
heard some stories from inside the opposition camp which<br />
indicates a lot of unhappiness there. But can I make this more<br />
fundamental point Doug, that the proposition that's being put,<br />
and it was argued in Western Australia too and I argued against<br />
it there, it seems to involve the proposition that Victorians<br />
will kick themselves in the backside to register some sort of<br />
protest about a state situation here. I mean on the 24th of<br />
March they are going to have to decide which Federal Government<br />
is going to be in charge of education, health, environment at the<br />
Federal level, and taxcation. Are they going to say, well look we<br />
think on those things the Labor Party's much better than the<br />
Opposition but because we ' re a bit unhappy with some of the<br />
things that happened in the Victorian State Government we're<br />
going to vote against them. I don't think they're going to do<br />
that. AITON; No they're not, but I just think that these are going to<br />
be the tightest seats, that's all, and that we'll be looking at<br />
these ueats to decide the winner of the election.<br />
PX1 I believe that Victorian seats are important, I'm not<br />
arguing, it'd be silly to argue that they're not important. I'.<br />
simply saying in the totality of things, I think we're going to<br />
win. AITON: At a time like this when things are tight, when people<br />
are feeling the pinch, when it's close, that's when people tend<br />
to want to change their vote I reckon, and also statistically<br />
you're not in good shape. That's not your fault of course but to<br />
be returned a fourth time as a Labor Prime Minister, that's four<br />
in a row, would be the first time in history wouldn't it, in<br />
Australia. PM: Yen.<br />
AIZONt Those things are making it look statistically fairly<br />
tou gh for you. / 8 </p>
<p>-a-<br />
PHI No but you've then got to get back to the question, what<br />
Judgement are you making about the intelligence of the<br />
electorate. They've got to make a choice on the 24th of March<br />
whether Bob Hawke's going to be Prime Minister or Andrew Peacock.<br />
And they've got to make a Judgement whether you can have Hawke as<br />
Prime mi~ nister or Andrew Peacock, and with the policies which<br />
say we won't aboliuh the capital gains tax, we won't give<br />
billions of dollars back to the wealthy loe than one percent,<br />
we'll keep billions of dollars to be spent on education and so<br />
on, a Government under Hawke which has an impeccable record, via<br />
a vis the opposition on environmental matters, those are the<br />
decisions. They're not going to be saying, oh well this is<br />
Hawkie's fourth time up. it's a choice between Hawke and<br />
Peacock. ArTON: I know, they've said that sort of thing before. You're<br />
putting an enormous amount of faith in people deciding that your<br />
policies are best.<br />
PHI Yes, well I just happen to think that over the year.,<br />
basically, the Australian electorate has tended to get things<br />
right. I've said publicly that in all those years when we were<br />
out of office the public made a decision, they saw the Labor<br />
Party fighting and squabbling, and my God we were, and they said<br />
look, if you mob can't govern yourself and you manifestly can't,<br />
we're not going to allow you to attempt to govern the country.<br />
Now you've got this situation amongs . t the Conservatives. I mean<br />
they hate one another. John Howard, on the record, at the end of<br />
last year in the Sydney Morning Herald, saying no trust between<br />
Peacock and Howard. So you'ye got the deepest of hatreds and<br />
divisions within the Liberal Party and you've got deep divisions<br />
between the Liberal Party and the National Party, and I believe<br />
that quite apart from an assessment of the policy issues, like on<br />
health, are they going to say, oh look health's not important.<br />
This mob which have got up and said publicly that our record in<br />
health is no good, in government or in opposition, but that<br />
doesn't matter people are going to say we'll let you control<br />
our health, I just don't believe that's the way it operates.<br />
AITONt You've got to catch a plane soon and you've got to leave<br />
here at 5.40 on the dot so we're going to take ten minutes of<br />
ca-Inju and we'll go to Jim. Are you there Jim? He's gone. Bello<br />
Michael. MICHAEL: Mr Hawke, I'd like to ask you a rather simple<br />
question. PH: I'm always wary of the simple ones Michael. .1s9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
MICHAEL: Right. I'm one of Your middle-income wage and salary<br />
earners and I have a small share portfolio. Shares Poet and pro-<br />
September 1985. Now it'. not worth a lot of money but I have<br />
received bonus shares, rights issues and so on. It's an<br />
accounting nightmare to keep track of all these shares because of<br />
your capital gains tax. Now I'm not going to make a lot of money<br />
from selling my shares. Why don't you look after the small<br />
person such as myself if you're so determined to attack the<br />
wealthy people that live off capital gains? I'd like your<br />
opinion please.<br />
PM: The principle is the same Michael. That if people acquire<br />
an income out of capital accretion, then I take the view,<br />
interestingly that is shared by, may I say, Dr Howson. Can I<br />
just quote to you Dr Howson ' s view on this matter when he was a<br />
pure economist and before he became a captive of the Conservative<br />
prejudices. MICHAEL: Mr Hawks, I'd prefer you to<br />
PH: And I'm going to, because what Professor Howson has said is<br />
my reasoning, in answer to your question. so I'm sorry<br />
Michael, you may not like the fact that my reasoning is the same<br />
as Hewoon's, but it's important to give you the answer, and this<br />
is what Hewson said on the 3rd of August in the Age, 1987, when<br />
he was asked about the question of capital gains and fringe<br />
benefits, ifewson said, and I quote, " I'd go for near uniform<br />
taxation of all forms of income" and I agree with Howsonl the<br />
economist, and that is, if in fact you are deriving income from<br />
accretion of values on your shares. I mean you buy shares and<br />
out of a magnificent effort on your part Michael, of ringing your<br />
stockbroker and saying sell, I mean a tremendous effort on your<br />
part mate, you ring him up because the shares have appreciated<br />
in value, you ring up your sharebroker and you get an increase in<br />
value on your shares. I reckon you should pay tax on that<br />
because the bloke that's working in that company in which you've<br />
got shares, who through his labour has increased the value of<br />
your shares, for every hour of his brain or muscle-work in that<br />
company in which you have shares, he pays tax on his labour, of<br />
hi. brain and his mind. You have the shares, you ring up your<br />
stockbroker and say sell and you get a capital appreciation but<br />
yo* think you pay no tax on it, Well mate, it was the absence of<br />
the capital gains tax wh-ich led Professor Matthews to say what<br />
I've just before on this program, that it was a matter of choice<br />
as to whether the rich paid any tax, and it was also the absence<br />
of a capital gains tax which led the Conservative's Royal<br />
Commissioner, Frank Costigan, to say that tax avoidance was the<br />
fastest growing industry in this country. </p>
<p>AITON: I'm going to have to move on. I'm morry Michael, I know<br />
you wanted to argue back but I want to get some other callers on.<br />
Have you ever owned any shares in your life?<br />
PM: no.<br />
AITON: Hello Terry.<br />
TZRRYt Xr Hawke, Ifm one of eight children, I have seven<br />
sisters. Two of my sisters have had babies out of marriage,<br />
they've -had supporting boyfriends and they have both, one in<br />
particular got a house on a special arrangement by the Government<br />
because she wag an unmarried mother. She bought a house about<br />
five years ago worth thirty thousand dollars, or she bought it<br />
for thirty-five thousand dollars or something in Adelaide. it's<br />
now worth about a hundred thousand. She's still not working,<br />
neither her husband now not working. My other sister's the same.<br />
She has had a baby out of marriage and she's been put on line to<br />
get a cheap home loan. I've been working my butt off mince I was<br />
sixteen, I'm not twenty-eight, for twelve years. I went out to<br />
get a second job last year because I desperately want to put a<br />
roof over my head that I call mine and I got taxed through the<br />
bum. I mean because I want to go out and do two jobs it wasn't<br />
worth my while because I was paying so much tax. How is it under<br />
your Government that two girls, and they're just two examples,<br />
there are a lot of girls that I know that are doing this, can go<br />
out and get pregnant out of wedlock, get their boyfriends to<br />
support them anyway and two dole cheques come into the house or<br />
whatever, and they get a house over their head. I mean they're<br />
sitting on a mortgage now that's worth a hundred thousand<br />
dollars and I am working my butt off.<br />
AITOW: Okay, we get the point of what you're saying. Yes Prime<br />
Minister. PM# Let me say this, that it's under my Government that you'ye<br />
had the most considerable tightening of the eligibility for<br />
benefits that you've seen. Under our predecessors the number of<br />
people on benefit. simply exploded. What we have done is to<br />
bring about a situation more and more where people are going to<br />
have to work if they are going to get benefits. That's why in<br />
respect of single parents for instance, you've had a massive<br />
ch~ qge under my Government, on the proportion of single parents<br />
who are in fact working rather than receiving the benefits and<br />
that's what'. happened in regard to unemployment as well an other<br />
benefits, and that's why it's a matter of in fact recognition<br />
within the welfare industry that this Government has taken those<br />
sorts of steps. We do not want to have a society In which people 11 </p>
<p>-11-<br />
regard it as a right not to work and got a handout. That's why<br />
we' 01ve had a massive increase in expenditure on training programs<br />
like SkLilhare to increase the training and re-traLning<br />
opportunities for people who either haven't been in the workforce<br />
or who have been in it and want to get back. And what we are now<br />
having in this country is a situation of that culmination of<br />
decisions that we take which came earlier this year in the<br />
February Statement, where people are out of work and they come to<br />
the Department of Social security, they are going to have to be<br />
prepared to undertake training or re-training programs if they<br />
are going to get a benefit.<br />
AXTON: Jim, hello.<br />
P JIMt Hr Hawke, you keep on talking about what you inherited from<br />
the previous government and you rightly point out that<br />
superannuation funds have gone from seventeen billion to a<br />
hundred billion. Our national debt's gone from loe than ten<br />
billion to over one hundred and thirty billion<br />
PZ~ s Well Jim the figure. are wrong..<br />
JIMS ( inaudible) thirteen and a half percent to eighteen<br />
percent... PM: Jim the figures are wrong. The figures.*..<br />
JIM:. Oh are they?<br />
PH: The figures are wrong. You said from ten to one hundred and<br />
thirty. Let me give you the facts. They've gone from twenty<br />
three to one hundred and eighteen. Those are the facts.<br />
JIM: Right. So that's pretty similar to the seventeen to a<br />
hundred in superannuation investments.<br />
PM: It's a quite different figure.<br />
JIM$ We've also got institutionalised inflation, @ tuck in a<br />
groove at seven percent<br />
PM: On the contrary Jim. We've brought inflation down Jim. The<br />
inflation rate that I inherited was eleven percent, that warn the<br />
inflation rate that I inherited and under my period of Government<br />
it has never reached the eleven percent, we've brought it down.<br />
/ 12 </p>

JIM-. Can you tell me what we'll be paying in housing inter-est<br />
rates, irrespective of what's gone on in the past, and what our<br />
inflation rate will be if you get re-elected, what will they be<br />
at the end of your third term and what will the national debt be?<br />
Just give me three numbers.<br />
PM: Well I will nay these things to you, which are the only<br />
answers I can give to you. I will agree with the statements that<br />
have been made as recently as today by the banking industry, and<br />
that is that interest rates will go down, it's been said by the<br />
Commonwealth Bank today in the light of the employment statistics<br />
and the December quarter balance of payments statistics, that<br />
they expect interest rates to go down early. That's the<br />
judgement of the banking industry on interest rates, so that's<br />
interest rates. In regard to the debt, we have in place three<br />
things which will move to bring the debt down. We have a firm<br />
and predictable wages outcome which will increase the<br />
competitive position of Australian industry so that manufacturing<br />
industry is going to export more and more and be more import<br />
replacing. secondly we have a budget surplus. I" Jim, have<br />
been the only Prime Minister in the history of this country to<br />
run a surplus. In the last three years, seventeen billion<br />
dollars which I've used to pay off every cent, every cent of<br />
Commonwealth Government overseas debt and we are now an<br />
international creditor to the tune of 4.4 billion. We will<br />
continue to have a surplus so that we can do that as against<br />
which our Conservative opponents will blow the budget surplus by<br />
their six to seven billion dollar hole and their intention to<br />
give back billions of dollars from you to the richest people in<br />
the country. And thirdly, in-regard to superannuation, we will<br />
continue to have superannuation as an award prescription which<br />
will increase the savings of this country so that industry in<br />
Australia can draw upon domestic savings rather than being<br />
international borrowers. Those are the answers to your<br />
questions. AITONs Xr Hawke, I know the time's getting very short now. I'd<br />
just like to draw your attention to something I meant to mention<br />
earlier and that's the front page of today's Melbourne Herald.<br />
PMt Thanks Doug.<br />
AITONI Ford bombshell.<br />
PM: Yes, Ford bombshell. / 13 </p>

AXTON: Ixciusive by Terry Nccrann. Australia's leading car<br />
company, Ford Australia, has told the Federal Government it is<br />
likely to quit full-scale local manufacturing production after<br />
the Hutton car plan levels off in 1992. The noew chief of Ford in<br />
Australia, Jack Masser, delivered the shock message to Industry<br />
Minister, Senator John Button, in a private one-to-one meeting in<br />
Melbourne etcetera. Do you want to comment on that?<br />
PM1 Thank you very much Doug. That lord bombshell is a Å 4oCrann<br />
bombshell. That bloke McCrann ought to look at himself in the<br />
mirror and ask whether he's got the moral scruple to accept his<br />
pay cheque. The story is one hundred percent false. And hie<br />
could've found out that it was false. Let me give you the proof<br />
of its falsity. Firstly, here is the statement by Senator<br />
Button, and then I'll go to the statement by Ford, but this<br />
Senator Button's statement from hospital today. The nature of<br />
the discussions between Button and Ford'. Nasser, alleged by<br />
journalist ) 4cCrann, totally Incorrect ways Button. Hie did meet<br />
with Nasser. However the Herald article is incorrect in claiming<br />
it was a one-on-one meeting. Mr Bill Dix, the former president<br />
and now chairman of Ford was also present. Neither Mr Nasser nor<br />
Mr Dix delivered any message or intimated in any way to Senator<br />
Button that Ford would be closing down its Australian<br />
manufacturing operations. On the contrary, part of the<br />
discussions revolved around plans by Ford to invest a further 1.2<br />
billion in its Australian operations. Statement from Ford, Ford<br />
denies reports on its future. in specific terms, Mr Nasier<br />
categorically denied he had told Senator Button that Ford was<br />
likely to quit full-scale local manufacturing after 1992. The<br />
topics were far-reaching, covering a wide range of subjects,<br />
including Ford's already announced intention to Invest about 1.2<br />
billion in Australia over the next five years, Mr Nasser said.<br />
Our investment in the past and our plans to spend an average 250<br />
million dollars a year over the next five years show Ford's<br />
strong cOmmittinent to remaining a viable manufacturer In<br />
Australia and a continuing development of export markets. This<br />
Investment has been underpinned by strong profit performance. in<br />
addition, Mr Nasser strongly denied the claim in a news report<br />
that Ford wanted to become quote, more or less an assembler in<br />
Australia. This is not an option that makes sense for Australia.<br />
During recent years considerable progress in productivity and<br />
quM4ity has been achieved. This McCrann, I don't know what he<br />
gets paid, but my cod he ought to look at himself in the mirror<br />
and say, what sort of a man am 1, All he had to do was to ring<br />
up and find out but he's prepared to write and allow to be<br />
published that sort of absolutely erroneous crap. ge ought to be<br />
totally ashamed of himself. 14 I. </p>

AITON: Mr Hawke, your time has run out, you've got to fly, Thank<br />
you very much indeed for making youreelf available today.<br />
PM2 We' been my pleasure Doug* Thank you to you and your<br />
listeners. </p>
