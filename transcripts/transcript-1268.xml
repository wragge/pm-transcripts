INCREASED AID TO VIET NAM<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. H. AROID1=-T&amp;<br />
FOR RADIO AND TV 9TH ? MCH. 1966<br />
Mr. Caiwell's proposal for a referendum in relation to<br />
the despatch of National Servicemen to South Viet Nam I think reflects<br />
a misunderstanding of what is proposed.<br />
He hearks back to the quite dissimilar situation which<br />
existed in the First and Second World Wars. There people enlisted for<br />
service for an indefinite period of years and in the result, many were<br />
absent from Australia for a number of years. But our National<br />
Servicemen have a two-year term of duty. Most of them will have been<br />
under training for the best part of twelve months before they are<br />
moved to South Viet Nam and the term of duty there would be in the<br />
neighbourhood of a twelve months' tour of duty; that is the period<br />
which would have been served approximately by our present battalion<br />
there before it is relieved, and this would be in contemplation for<br />
the Task Force which we have decided to send to South Viet Nam. And<br />
so on return from service there, many of our National Servicemen would<br />
be very close to the conclusion of their two-year term of duty or would<br />
actually have passed beyond that point, and they could only be<br />
extended beyond that point by their own decision. So that the<br />
situation is scarcely comparable.<br />
Now, I would hope that this service can be seen in its<br />
true perspective in view of the explanations that I have given. We<br />
felt that the despatch of the Task Force was the most effective<br />
military contribution that Australia can make at this time. We are<br />
assured by our military advisers that it would be the most effective.<br />
It is the smallest force that we can despatch which could function<br />
effectively as a completely serviced Australian unit under Australian<br />
command, and there is great advantage in having a unified Australian<br />
command, our own body of men responding to Australian leadership and<br />
giving Australia an identifiable role in this conflict.<br />
The episode which has involved Gunner O'Neill is, of<br />
course, an unfortunate one which has given me personally a good deal<br />
of concern. I am easier in my mind now that I know that a very<br />
distinguished and able military leader in the person of the Chief<br />
of Staff, Lieutenant-General Wilton, has been personally giving his<br />
attention to the matter, and I '-Jould most certainly hope that this<br />
episode should not be allowed to blur the splendid image which has<br />
been established in Australia and indeed throughout the world by our<br />
forces in Viet Num. </p>
