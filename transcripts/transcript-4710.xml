FOR PRESS 15 May 1978<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES<br />
It is with the deepest regret that I record tonight the<br />
death of Sir Robert Menzies.<br />
All Australians will mourn his passing.<br />
Sir Robert leaves an enduring mark on Australian history.<br />
His time as Prime Minister, from 1949-1966, was a time of<br />
stability and growth.<br />
He was the founder of the Liberal Party. He gave his Party<br />
and his country strength and inspiration.<br />
I valued greatly his counsel and support, and his friendship.<br />
Like all other Australians I held Sir Robert in great respect<br />
and affection.<br />
On behalf of all of us, I extend my deepest sympathy to<br />
Dame Pattie and to the other members of Sir Robert's family.<br />
