TRANSCRIPT Oil THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PAUL BONGIORNO, FEBRUARY 26 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
BONGIORNO: Thanks Mr Keating for coming.<br />
PM: Good Paul.<br />
BONGIORNO: The big question seems to be tonight is where's<br />
the money coming from?<br />
PM: It's coming from a hard won, tight fiscal<br />
position which this Government took eight years<br />
to put into place. All those huge structural<br />
surpluses that I produced in the late 1980s are<br />
sitting there, that structure is sitting there<br />
now so when private spending is down, when<br />
private investment is down the sensible thing to<br />
do is to lift public spending, public investment<br />
uip. And we can do that and bring the budget back<br />
into surplus by 1995.<br />
BONGIORNO: But how do we re-pay that $ 2.3 billion?<br />
PM: I: t will be repaid by the growth coming off the<br />
economy, as receipts pick up, as growth picks up,<br />
as employment picks up, the budget swerves back<br />
iLnto surplus and basically cover those funds. In<br />
other words it's the time when other people are<br />
not spending in investment, now's the time for<br />
-the Government to be spending in investment and<br />
particularly on long-run investments like the<br />
rail system, the ports, the highways, the roads,<br />
-the electricity grid. They're all the long term<br />
things that can only come from government<br />
investment.<br />
BONGIORNO: But haven't we seen here tonight Paul Keating<br />
' the gambler'? You're taking a big risk, even on<br />
your own projections three years out spending and<br />
demand will be powering along and imports, for<br />
example, will be well ahead of exports. To deal </p>
<p>-2<br />
with that in the past you had to up interest<br />
rates.<br />
PM: You saw what the Treasury said in tonight's<br />
document, that they expect the debt to stabilise<br />
in about 1994-95, that this is no gamble. It's a<br />
$ 2.3 billion package in a budget of $ 100 billion.<br />
It's a package from a budget which has got a<br />
structural surplus underneath it. There is no<br />
gamble, this is just a sensible thing to do and<br />
it's part of a plan, it's a four year plan to<br />
stimulate growth, employment, private investment<br />
and public investment, a partnership between the<br />
public and the private sector. And two years<br />
from now we provide tax cuts to Australians to<br />
take their tax rate to 30 per cent while the<br />
budget goes back to surplus, and 30 per cent<br />
without Dr Hewson's 15 per cent consumption tax.<br />
BONGIORNO: See, the suspicion is that the Statement tonight<br />
is; to get you over the hump of the next election,<br />
that it's really very cleverly politically aimed.<br />
PM: Well it's got to get Australia over the hump. We<br />
don't want to be in a recession for any longer<br />
than we need to be and it's about getting us over<br />
that. It's a quarter of a century since we've<br />
invested in the rail system, we need a national<br />
rail highway, it's absurd for it to be breaking<br />
up highways with trucks carrying bulk<br />
commodities, we need a sensible airline system,<br />
we need ring roads around the cities. These are<br />
things that are needed and now is the time to<br />
build them when the economy needs activity.<br />
BONGIORNO: On your own projections tonight we still have<br />
unemployment running above 9 per cent for the<br />
next three years. When will Australians begin to<br />
feel confident again about their jobs, about<br />
employment?<br />
PM: Once the trend is going down. It's the trend<br />
that matters, I think, rather than the rate.<br />
It's now at about 10.3 10.4 per cent, we expect<br />
it to go 10 9.5 8 and at the end of the<br />
period, four years, to have a 7 in front of it.<br />
BONGIORNO: Why is it that you gave families a boost in<br />
spending, the $ 125 boost to the family allowance?<br />
What about the pensioners, they've been hit very<br />
hard by the recession?<br />
PM: Pensions have been adjusted for inflation fully<br />
right through the 1980s, but wages were cut less<br />
than the inflation rate. So it's tax payers with<br />
children who have had less support than the full<br />
adjustment for inflation under the pension<br />
system. This is about recovery. We've tried to </p>
<p>3<br />
see how we could spend quickly, put some stimulus<br />
into the economy quickly before the rail and road<br />
projects build up, and we can make this payment<br />
in April and it will go to tax payers with<br />
children-families, it will go to where it's<br />
needed. If it was Dr Hewson he would have thrown<br />
it up the top end of town, it would have been the<br />
high income tax payers or the wealthy companies.<br />
We haven't done that. We've given it to the<br />
people who need it most.<br />
BONGIORNO: Is this a vote winner? Can it help you win the<br />
next election?<br />
PM: First of all it is a job winner. It's a plan for<br />
Australia, it's not a miserable change of the tax<br />
system from income to expenditure, taxing the<br />
food you put in your mouth and the clothes you<br />
put on your back, it's not that. It's a typical<br />
Labor thing, it's building Australia, it's doing<br />
all the big projects like we always have the<br />
rail system, the roads, the ports, the airlines.<br />
We're the only ones that ever done these things,<br />
Paul, and it's obviously a plan with vision and<br />
with vista and it gets beyond the miserable<br />
accountancy of Dr Hewson's tax package.<br />
BONGIORNO: OK, thanks very much Prime Minister. </p>
