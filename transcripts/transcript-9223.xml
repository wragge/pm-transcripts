    <content><![CDATA[<p>SOUTH AFRICA: INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT MANDELA</p>
<p>Australians join wholeheartedly with South Africans in celebrating the inauguration of President Mandela. It is a great moment for South Africa but also for the world.</p>
<p>Australia is represented at the inauguration by former Prime Ministers Hawke and Fraser, each of whom helped to put Australia in the front ranks of the international community in the long struggle, which culminates today, for a non-racial and democratic government in South Africa.</p>
<p>We look now to the full restoration of a strong and close relationship between Australia and South Africa. As part of that process Senator Evans and Mr Bilney have announced today a new program of assistance amounting to $30 million over three years.</p>
<p>I have written to President Mandela congratulating him on the election result and assuring him of the warmest possible welcome if he is able to visit Australia again in his new capacity.</p>
<p>Canberra<br />10 May 1994</p>
