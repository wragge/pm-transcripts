PRIME MINISTER 41/ 94<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP.<br />
SOUTH AFRICA: INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT MANDELA<br />
Australians join wholeheartedly with South Africans in celebrating the<br />
inauguration of President Mandela. It is a great moment for South Africa but<br />
also for the world.<br />
Australia is represented at the inauguration by former Prime Ministers Hawke<br />
and Fraser, each of whom helped to put Australia in the front ranks of the<br />
international community in the long struggle, which culminates today, for a<br />
non-racial and democratic government in South Africa.<br />
We look now to the full restoration of a strong and close relationship between<br />
Australia and South Africa. As part of that process Senator Evans and<br />
Mr Bilney have announced today a new program of assistance amounting to<br />
million over three years.<br />
I have written to President Mandela congratulating him on the election result<br />
and assuring him of the warmest possible welcome if he is able to visit<br />
Australia again in his new capacity.<br />
