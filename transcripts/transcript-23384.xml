    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thank you so much for making me so welcome.</p>
<p>This is my first ever visit to a submarine. These are an extremely potent unit of the Royal Australian Navy and I appreciate that I am with elite members of our Navy in being here with you.</p>
<p>Obviously itâs a different world down here to the world on a surface ship. It would require extraordinary levels of discipline and mental toughness and I am full of admiration for the professionalism of all our military personnel, but I am particularly full of admiration for the professionalism and mental toughness of our submariners.</p>
<p>So, itâs great to be here. I very much appreciate the work you do. I understand just what a sophisticated piece of equipment this is. I appreciate the extraordinary levels of interoperability that we have with our principal ally because of the equipment on this boat and as I said, I realise just what an amazing capability this gives us thanks to your work and your professionalism.</p>
<p>So thank you so much. Iâm looking forward to spending a bit of time talking to you. Iâm also looking forward to spending a bit of time talking to Admiral Griggs and the team about various submarine related issues. But Iâve got to say, just looking around now; it sure is a different world.</p>
