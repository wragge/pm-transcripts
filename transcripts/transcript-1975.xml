FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 211969<br />
AUSTRALIAN FORCES IN MALAYSIA-SINGAPORE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
On 19 November, I announced in Parliament that Australia<br />
had decided in principle to maintain forces in Malaysia and Singapore<br />
until the end of 1971,<br />
Since then technical consideration of the detailed<br />
implementation of this " in principle" decision has continued. This<br />
having been concluded, Australia and New Zealand have now indicated<br />
to Malaysia and Singapore their firm willingness to maintain Naval, Air<br />
and Army Forces in the area.<br />
It is planned that two Australian squadrons of Mirage<br />
aircraft will be based at Butterworth with a detachment in Singapore<br />
and that an Australian Naval element will continue to be stationed in<br />
Singapore. At an appropriate stage during the British withdrawal from<br />
Terendak, the Australian and New Zealand Army contingents will move<br />
to Singapore, with a detachment stationed at Butterworth.<br />
A full statement on these matters will be made when<br />
Parliament resumes. In the meantime any reports on the disposition of forces<br />
after the end of 1971 are pure speculation; this is a matter which<br />
remains under discussion between Governments.<br />
