    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government today joined with Victoria in marking the first anniversary of the devastating Black Saturday bushfires.</p>
<p>The Black Saturday bushfires were Australia's worst natural disaster since Federation, claiming 173 lives, devastating entire towns and communities, destroying more than 2,000 homes and leaving thousands of residents homeless.</p>
<p>February 7 will be forever etched in the nation's memory as a day of mourning but also one of tremendous spirit and inspiration.</p>
<p>The tragedy brought out the best of the Australian character and inspired countless acts of bravery and generosity.</p>
<p>Our thoughts today are with the survivors of the bushfires as they remember the people they lost and work to rebuild their lives and towns.</p>
<p>Their quiet courage has inspired a nation.</p>
<p>The Australian Government has worked closely with the local communities, the Victorian and local governments, business and non-government organisations to provide more than $455 million to assist in the reconstruction and recovery of bushfire affected communities.</p>
<p>In August 2009, the Australian Government welcomed the interim report of the Victorian Bushfire Royal Commission and committed to implement all of the interim recommendations directed at the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>In cooperation with the States and Territories, the Australian Government has supported a range of measures to ensure that Australians are better prepared for bushfires.</p>
<p>This has included, for example, the provision of $26 million for the development of a national telephone-based emergency warning system, 'Emergency Alert' and convening the inaugural bushfire pre-season briefing for emergency management officials.</p>
<p>Today's anniversary represents an important opportunity to reflect on this terrible tragedy and to acknowledge the critically important work of our emergency services and the generous support of the Australian community in helping those in need.</p>
