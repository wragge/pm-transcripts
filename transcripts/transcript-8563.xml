PRIME MINISTER 64/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
RELEASE OF DRAFT NATIONAL STRATEGIES FOR ECOLOGICALLY<br />
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND GREENHOUSE RESPONSE<br />
The Prime Minister released today draft National<br />
Strategies for Ecologically Sustainable Development and<br />
Greenhouse Response.<br />
These companion documents are designed to promote<br />
discussion and debate in the Australian community.<br />
Given the complexity of the issues, the Government<br />
believes that public discussion and response will be<br />
essential in helping all Australian governments determine<br />
their final policy directions.<br />
Without public involvement and commitment, government<br />
efforts to achieve ecologically sustainable development<br />
( ESD) and to respond to the possibility of an enhanced<br />
greenhouse effect will face serious difficulty.<br />
Public comment on the draft strategies will be accepted<br />
until August 21.<br />
Officials will be holding a national round table meeting<br />
of key interest groups in September, while members of the<br />
original ESD working groups and nationally based<br />
organisations will be invited to community consultation<br />
forums in August.<br />
The outcome of these meetings will be a key element in<br />
the setting of final directions taken in the strategies.<br />
In May 1992, Commonwealth, State and Territory Heads of<br />
Government noted progress on development of an<br />
intergovernmental response, in the form of national<br />
strategies on ESD and greenhouse, to the reports of the<br />
nine ESD Working Groups and two ESD Chairs. They agreed<br />
that in light of the range and complexity of the issues<br />
addressed, and in order to provide adequate opportunity<br />
for effective public consultation, the draft strategies<br />
should be released at the end of June as officials'<br />
discussion papers. Heads of Government also requested </p>
<p>officials to bring forward proposals for the definitive<br />
strategies by the end of October.<br />
The Prime Minister encouraged interested groups and<br />
individuals to participate actively in the public<br />
consultation process. It is hoped the community will<br />
take this opportunity of open discussion with government<br />
officials and other interest groups on the proposed<br />
actions and initiatives outlined in the strategies.<br />
A broad range of measures for achieving ESD and<br />
responding to the greenhouse effect are recommended in<br />
the draft strategies.<br />
The Prime Minister noted that the ESD Working Group<br />
process has already had a significant impact on<br />
government policies and processes. A large number of<br />
initiatives have already been developed and put in place<br />
by all levels of governments, and in a wide variety of<br />
agencies, to help move Australia towards an ecologically<br />
sustainable future. Together, the draft strategies<br />
outline a number of the actions that governments have<br />
taken in response to the ESD Working Group Reports.<br />
All levels of government will be involved in finalising<br />
the strategies for Heads of Government agreement of<br />
specific actions and initiatives by November.<br />
Copies of the draft strategies are being widely<br />
distributed to libraries and peak interest groups. They<br />
can also be obtained free of charge by contacting one of<br />
the nominated agencies in each State or Territory.<br />
Contact addresses for these agencies are attached.<br />
