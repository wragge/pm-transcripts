PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE MON. P J KEATING H4P<br />
FORUM ON THE NATIONAL STRATEGY ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
Thank you for your invitation to attend today's Forum and to<br />
accept, on behalf of the Federal Government, the National<br />
Strategy on Violence Against Women.<br />
I am aware that Commonwealth, State and community<br />
representatives have worked together on this document and I<br />
am pleased to know that you have been able to reach<br />
agreement on an approach towards dealing with this extremely<br />
serious issue.<br />
It is a matter of great concern to me that violence against<br />
women seems to be increasing.<br />
Freedom from fear is a basic, inalienable right. It is<br />
enshrined in the Atlantic Charter. It is a responsibility<br />
of democratic governments to fight it in the same way that<br />
we fight poverty, repression or discrimination of any kind.-<br />
It is also the responsibility of communities to fight it.<br />
It is the responsibility of all Australians particularly,<br />
it has to be said, of men who cause most of the fear and do<br />
most of the violence.<br />
Violence against women is Intolerable.<br />
All Australian women are entitled to be safe, and to feel<br />
safe on the streets and in their homes.<br />
I know-that personal safety is of major concern to<br />
Australian women. For many women, fear of attack by men is<br />
a constant source of anxiety and stress. </p>
<p>It is a matter of shame that in our major cities women are<br />
afraid to use public transport, particularly trains, outside<br />
of peak periods because they do not feel safe.<br />
That nurses and other shift workers are afraid to walk to<br />
their cars except in groups.<br />
That students in our tertiary institutions cannot freely<br />
walk about the campus at night.<br />
I know that this evening women around Australia are taking<br />
to the streets to march to " reclaim the night", to assert<br />
their right to be safe, and to feel safe, at night wherever<br />
they live.<br />
I fully support the aims of the march.<br />
I often make the point that Australia is a pretty good place<br />
to live in, that our values of democracy and equality, and<br />
our concern for those who need help, make us a society to be<br />
envied. But it Is also pretty obvious that these values are<br />
undermined, and even contradicted, by violence and<br />
especially by violence within the home.<br />
We do not know the true extent of domestic violence but I<br />
think we can say that it is a muchi larger problen ihan many<br />
people are prepared to recognise or admit.<br />
I find this both tragic and totally unacceptable.<br />
In recent days we have had to confront a truly awful example<br />
of such violence.<br />
All Australia was shocked and appalled by what happened on<br />
the Central Coast of New South Wales earlier this week, and<br />
our hearts go out to the surviving families and friends of<br />
the victims. And to their commnunities.<br />
I find it appalling when individuals resort to violence to<br />
deal with feeling frustrated or aggrieved.<br />
We as a society have an obligation to do something about it.<br />
We have to reaffirm the integrity of women and their<br />
equality as-fundamental values which violence undermines. We<br />
have to instil in our children, especially in our boys, the<br />
notion that disputes should be resolved in non-violent ways. </p>
<p>Our schools have a role to play here but most particularly<br />
parents. And so does our media. There is far too much violence on<br />
television in my view, and this is encouraging violence to<br />
be seen as normal and acceptable. it is sending totally the<br />
wrong signals to our children, and to those individuals who<br />
are wont to resort too readily to violence.<br />
As a federal government, our powers are limited in this area<br />
but there are some practical actions we can and do take.<br />
For instance, we provide funds for 263 women'sreus<br />
Australia-wide which offer safe shelter to women and<br />
children escaping domestic violence.<br />
We provide funds under the Commonwealth -State Housing<br />
Agreement to ensure women escaping domestic violence can<br />
have proiyof access to public housinj This means they<br />
and their children have a real alternative and are not<br />
forced to return to a violent situation simply because they<br />
have nowhere alse to live.<br />
Similarly, we ensure that women escaping domestic violence<br />
have immediate access to the Sole Parents Pension so they<br />
can support themselves and their children and not be<br />
dependent on the man who has been violent towards them.<br />
But perhaps most important of all, the Federal Government<br />
can, and should, provide leadership on this issue.<br />
We can help set the tone of public discussion and public<br />
debate. We can speak out loudly in saying it is simply not on. We<br />
do not want a society where it Is regarded as acceptable or<br />
excusable for a man to attack a woman. It ig not and it<br />
never can be.<br />
We are prepared to put money into reaffirming this strong<br />
view. Early next year the Government will be launching a<br />
million community education program.<br />
We will be using television and other media to proclaim the<br />
message that-violence against women is not to be tolerated<br />
in Australia today and should stop.<br />
I welcome the comprehensive strategy on violence against<br />
women which I have just received as a source of further </p>
<p>ideas and thinking on how we tackle this sore o u<br />
society. o u<br />
I look forward to reading its proposals and to discussing<br />
with my Cabinet colleagues how we can act to do our bit<br />
towards ending the toll of violence against women.<br />
I urge my fellow political leaders at the State level to<br />
take this document to heart, to study it and to take the<br />
appropriate actions. I<br />
This issue is not a partisan one.<br />
It is one on which we can all agree.<br />
We can agree that we want the world to be safe.<br />
I want a world where none of us is pray, where all<br />
Australians can feel safe, a world where women can get on<br />
with their lives without fear or anxiety.<br />
This is a goal we as a nation can work towards and I pledge<br />
that I will do all I can to see that we do.<br />
Today's national strategy document is a first step. I look<br />
forward to there being many more.<br />
