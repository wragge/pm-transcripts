France Speech by the Prime Minister of France, M. Jacques Chirac, at a<br />
dinner in honour of the Prime Minister of Australia in Paris on<br />
6 January 1975<br />
Through one of those unexpected incidents<br />
such as are often met in the lives of individuals<br />
and peoples, the circumstances of these recent<br />
days make your presence amongst us specially<br />
significant. Indeed how could I fail to mention,<br />
at the time when we have the honour and the<br />
pleasure of welcoming you, the ordeal which<br />
has just struck Australia? You were already in<br />
Europe when you had to return to your country<br />
and face the consequences of the Darwin disaster.<br />
That you should have wanted against all<br />
other considerations to keep to our joint plans,<br />
that you should be in Paris today as previously<br />
agreed, gives us an even better appreciation of<br />
the importance of your visit to France and must<br />
have consequences for our two nations and our<br />
two States.<br />
Our awareness that Australia and France have,<br />
despite space and distance, very real common<br />
interests-in many regards fundamentally<br />
so-is further reinforced by a coincidence of<br />
dates which is of symbolic value. We are in<br />
January 1975: So it is exactly 60 years since<br />
the first volunteers from the southern continent<br />
first took part in the battles of the great conflict<br />
which then divided the world. In the hardest<br />
struggles at Vimy, as on the steep slopes of<br />
Gallipoli, the Australian soldiers, with their heroism<br />
which was to become legendary, bore witness<br />
that to defend human liberty and the<br />
independence of peoples, solidarity between<br />
old Europe and their new country remained<br />
essential. You may be sure, Mr Prime Minister, that the<br />
French people have not forgotten. Sixty years<br />
have gone by since those days in 1915 when<br />
men of our two people discovered what a terrible price they had to pay for the right to retain<br />
their identity. Another war tore our universe,<br />
and your country, even more than in<br />
1914-1918, experienced its dramas, bore its<br />
effects and played its tragic part. Thirty years<br />
ago, almost to the day, one of your predecessors<br />
declared, so close was the threat: ' Australia<br />
belongs to the Australians and it must remain<br />
so. Neither you, nor we, have forgotten the lessons<br />
of those years of anxiety. We know that peoples<br />
must remain independent for men to be free.<br />
We know that to remain independent peoples<br />
must be capable of assuring their defence and<br />
be determined to assure it. But we also know<br />
that the will to remain independent and free<br />
requires that men should also experience, in<br />
their daily life, the value of independence and<br />
the meaning of freedom. In modern industrial<br />
societies this necessarily means that everything<br />
must be done to provide everyone, whatever his<br />
social or economic status, with a full share in<br />
decisions, in choice and thus in responsibility.<br />
We know, Mr Prime Minister, how well you<br />
have perceived this. We know with what determination<br />
you have laboured for Australia's<br />
further evolution and to develop new forms of<br />
economic action and social innovation.<br />
Frenchmen are all the more attentive to your<br />
efforts because for their part and in accordance<br />
with conditions deriving from their own history,<br />
they are pursuing with perseverance an undertaking<br />
which is in many ways comparable to<br />
yours, for French society to transform itself<br />
without chaos and modernise itself without<br />
breach. Tomorrow is not the contrary of today,<br />
rather it is its development. </p>
<p>The growth of your country is a fine example of<br />
this. For nearly two centuries men from Europe<br />
have established themselves on its soil, have<br />
organised themselves there into a new society<br />
which is neither a copy nor the reverse of the old<br />
world which they had left. Australia has known<br />
how not to be an antipodean Europe without at<br />
the same time forgetting or neglecting anything<br />
essential from the European heritage.<br />
On that immense continent at the far end of the<br />
Asian world, on the Indian ocean and the<br />
Pacific, a new people has taken shape. Australia<br />
has seen the development of a distinctive culture<br />
and civilisation and become an industrial<br />
power; its very geographic position as well as its<br />
resources of raw materials confer on it a situation<br />
of first importance in the world of today.<br />
Europe, which is now in the process of constituting<br />
itself, intends for its part to maintain in<br />
the world affairs the position assigned to it by its<br />
history and economic weight; to say this is to<br />
say how much it is in the interest of our two<br />
countries to draw closer together and to understand<br />
each other better.<br />
You could have with France a close dialogue an<br />
even a special relationship. This is why to receive<br />
you in Paris, Mr Prime Minister, is not only<br />
an honour for us, it is also a responsibility, for we<br />
must now determine what Australia and France<br />
can henceforth do together. It seems to me that there is between our two<br />
peoples, despite distance, a manifest propensity<br />
to co-operate with each other and there are<br />
elements within our two economies which are<br />
so complementary that to fail to draw them<br />
together would be to fly in the face of both logic<br />
and the mutual interest of our countries. In the<br />
industrial and scientific sectors vast fields could<br />
be opened for close co-operation between our<br />
firms, our scientists, our engineers; for a pooling<br />
of our techniques and resources, our ambitions<br />
and our capabilities. This can contribute to meet<br />
the economic challenges of the last few years of<br />
the millennium and to bring our two peoples<br />
closer together. Our national interests command<br />
us to place no limits on our imagination<br />
and to defer no decisions.<br />
I want you to know, Mr Prime Minister, that<br />
there is on our side the political will, if you so<br />
wish, to go a long way together. France wants to<br />
be, before long, amongst Australia's principal<br />
associates. Your stay in France is thus not only<br />
the occasion to note that, despite all hazards,<br />
our countries are close to one another in their<br />
view of international life, of democracy and<br />
social progress. It will enable us to give new<br />
bases to our joint actions so as to reinforce between<br />
Australia and France, between Australia<br />
and Europe, ties which are not only those of<br />
memory but those of a concerted effort for<br />
growth, independence and peace.<br />

<p>Speech by the Prime Minister of Australia at a dinner given in his<br />
honour by the Prime Minister of France in Paris on 6 January 1975<br />
My wife and I are honoured by the welcome you<br />
have given us. It typifies the cordiality and<br />
graciousness we have come to expect from your<br />
country and her people. No one who visits the<br />
capitals of Europe-certainly no politician-can<br />
escape the feeling that Paris is the high point of<br />
his mission, that all his expectations, all his energies,<br />
indeed all his anxieties, reach their<br />
keenest pitch in the capital of France. In Paris<br />
we renew our contacts with one of the great cities<br />
of the world, with the capital of the French<br />
Republic, with the city that uniquely symbolises<br />
the spirit of Europe itself. Nowhere are the history<br />
and culture of Western Europe so closely<br />
and visibly identified with her present economic<br />
and industrial power and her future political<br />
aspirations. I declare Australia's firm support for the ideals of<br />
the European Community and the promise it<br />
holds for the peace of the world and the happiness<br />
of mankind. Many nations have had a part<br />
in shaping the European experiment, but<br />
France is rightly seen, and will rightly be judged<br />
by history, as the founding spirit and guiding<br />
force in the movement for European unity. For<br />
all her national pride and for all the intensity of<br />
her national ambitions, France has put Europe<br />
first. There have been times when Australia, in<br />
pursuit of her own interests or in defence of her<br />
traditional trading links and partnerships, may<br />
sometimes have seemed reluctant to give her<br />
full support to Europe. We have no such reservations<br />
today. The Common Market is<br />
Australia's second largest single trading<br />
partner. We cannot ignore it; still less do we<br />
under-estimate its importance as a force for<br />
enlightenment, for universal prosperity and for<br />
the general progress of humanity. The prosperity<br />
of France and the prosperity of Europe are<br />
indivisible. Equally, the prosperity of Europe<br />
and the prosperity of the western world are<br />
indivisible. Without the friendship and goodwill<br />
of France, the friendship and goodwill of Europe<br />
are an illusion. I would be less than frank, Prime Minister, if I<br />
failed to acknowledge that Australia's relations<br />
with France have been strained in recent years. I<br />
would be equally lacking in sincerity and candour<br />
if I apologised for the actions on Australia's<br />
part which contributed to the difficulties between<br />
us. You know the record of our<br />
differences. I stress that the course we took<br />
was not motivated by any hostility from our<br />
people towards the people of France. Nor was it<br />
inspired by any narrow political ideology: it was<br />
in fact supported by all political parties in<br />
Australia. It is sufficient to say now that the<br />
main cause of our differences has been largely<br />
removed, and I am bold enough to believe that<br />
whatever France may have said of our attitudes<br />
at the time, our policy would have won some<br />
respect in a nation renowned for the vigilant defence<br />
of her own national rights and interests. I<br />
believe there are no longer any outstanding or<br />
lasting problems between us. Here in your capital,<br />
as the guest of your Government, as a long<br />
standing friend and admirer of your country, I<br />
proclaim Australia's desire and Australia's<br />
readiness to strengthen and enlarge her relations<br />
with France. We want to build on the great<br />
traditions of friendship and co-operation that<br />
have guided our relations in the past. I am confident<br />
that we can do so. I believe, Prime Minister,<br />
that you share my confidence.<br />
It is a happy precedent, a happy omen, that the<br />
traditional contacts between our countries-the<br />
basis on which we must now build together-go<br />
back to the very foundations of Australia. I hope<br />
the French people will come to know more of<br />
Australia's standing as a modern and highly<br />
industrialised nation; a nation that has made,<br />
like France, important contributions to art, to<br />
industry, to science, to social organisation and<br />
other fields of endeavour; a nation sharing with<br />
France the historic Western values of liberty,<br />
law and parliamentary democracy. Australians<br />
are well aware of their historical and cultural<br />
affinities with France. They are well aware of the </p>
<p>vast reservoir of goodwill and shared experience<br />
that exists between us, as former allies in war<br />
and as great trading partners in peace.<br />
I give two examples of the range of contacts between<br />
us. An exhibition of Australian art has<br />
lately been seen in Paris. Only four weeks ago,<br />
in Canberra, I opened a French language school<br />
and a new local headquarters of the Alliance<br />
Francaise. These are small and recent things. I<br />
mention others more important-for example,<br />
the many discussions which Australians have<br />
had with French officials of DATAR, from which<br />
we have learnt much of value from French experience<br />
in urban and regional planning. Or<br />
again, the record of business contacts-on both<br />
a corporate and personal level-between<br />
Australia and France. On such foundations a<br />
great structure of trade and economic investment<br />
has been built. France buys annually<br />
more than a billion francs worth of Australian<br />
exports. French aircraft are the backbone of the<br />
Royal Australian Air Force. The French construction<br />
company, Citra, is responsible for<br />
many works and projects in our cities. Renault<br />
assembles cars in Australia. Yet even these<br />
links, substantial as they are, fall short of<br />
what our countries can achieve together. France has much to offer to our region, as she<br />
has to the world at large. Australia has much to<br />
offer France. We share, like every other country<br />
in the Western world, difficult economic and<br />
social problems. Your President, a statesman<br />
fully seized of the gravity and complexity of the<br />
problems of the modern world, stated his views<br />
of few weeks ago in these sombre terms: ' The<br />
world is unhappy. It is unhappy because it<br />
doesn't know where it is going and because it<br />
guesses that, if it knew, it would discover that it<br />
was heading for disaster. It is an unhappy world<br />
that statesmen have to lead and that the men of<br />
the media have to enlighten'. I believe the cooperation<br />
we seek between France and<br />
Australia will make some contribution, perhaps<br />
a useful contribution, to the easing of our problems.<br />
May I say, Prime Minister, how much I<br />
have valued the opportunity to talk with you.<br />
We have renewed and strengthened the friendship<br />
between France and Australia. I express<br />
my firm hope, my unwavering confidence, that<br />
our countries will move forward together in a<br />
renewed spirit of trust into a new era of friendship<br />
and accord.<br />
