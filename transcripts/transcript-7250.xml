Yvonne Kenny was born in Sydney. At the age of 22 she took up an<br />opera scholarship at La Scala in Milan, and later continued her<br />studies in London.<br />She was encouraged to return to Australia in 1972 by the Victoria<br />State Opera and has maintained a close association with the<br />Victoria State Opera and the Australian Opera since then.<br />Yvonne's most recent engagement was in Brussels, at a festival<br />commemorating the 100th anniversary of Dame Nellie Melba's first<br />opera performance, which is an appropriate coincidence in view of<br />the fact that Melba sang the Royal Anthem at the opening of the<br />Provisional Parliament House in 1927.<br />Julie Anthony was born in the Mallee country south of the River<br />Murray in South Australia.<br />She transferred to Sydney in 1972 and has lived there ever since<br />except for a number of professional engagements overseas,<br />especially in Los Angeles and London, where she is regarded as an<br />outstanding international artist.<br />Julie was awarded the O.
