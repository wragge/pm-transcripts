FOR PRESS PM. No. 51/ l72<br />
PRODUCTION OF PROJECT " N"<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. William Mcahon,<br />
CH, MP<br />
The Prime Minister announced in Canberra today that the<br />
Government had approved the production of an initial batch of twenty<br />
Project aircraft, at a cost of $ 13M, including the cost of<br />
completing development work and establishing production.<br />
In January 1970, the Government approved expenditure of<br />
$ 3.2M for the design, development and construction of two flying<br />
prototypes and a structural teqt airframe. A further $ 1.1M, for the<br />
second phase of the project was approved last year.<br />
The Prime Minister said " Eleven of the first production<br />
batch will be used by Army Aviation to replace their Cessna aircraft.<br />
These aircraft will be used for command liaison and observation task&amp;<br />
in close support of the Army."<br />
" The remaining nine aircraft of the initial batch will be<br />
produced for sale to commercial or other users."<br />
" It is Government policy to maintain a small but viable and<br />
effective aircraft industry in Australia. To this end, the Government<br />
is actively considering a rationalisation of the existing facilitics<br />
in the aircraft industry."<br />
" Employment in the industry had risen to high levels withthe<br />
Mirage and Macchi projects and workload in the industry has<br />
declined with the end of these two projects. This experience has<br />
highlighted that the industry has so far been unable to establish a<br />
significant market outside the dcfence area."<br />
" The Government's concern for the future of the industry<br />
had led it to initiate efforts to establish an improved workload<br />
for the industry." " Project had been conceived to maintain essential ddsign<br />
teams intact for defence purposes and oroduce a product that had both<br />
military and civil potential. The Government had also embarked in<br />
1971 upon a comprehensive programme of local production of light<br />
observation helicooters for both military and civil use." / 2 </p>
<p>" In addition, the Government had initiated a programme ofseeking<br />
offsets to overseas Government purchases aimed at diversifying<br />
the industry's market and bringing it into close commercial contact<br />
with overseas industries. The development of Project has proceeded<br />
remarkably well. This augurs very well for its success."<br />
" The Government is confident that the widespread interest<br />
being expressed in Project IN' will mean a successful commercial future<br />
for the project in addition to the Australian military requirements 16<br />
the aircraft. The combination of a military and a civil demand for<br />
the aircraft should provide a long term and steady workload."<br />
" The light utility aircraft, powered by two Allison 250<br />
series 400 HP turbo-prop engines, was designed at the Department of<br />
Supply's Government Aircraft Factories in Melbourne for use in military<br />
and civil versions. Two prototypes have flown more than 280* hours and<br />
have met or exceeded their design parameters."<br />
" The aircraft shows great pComise as a low-cost easily<br />
operated utility vehicle. It is widely adaptable in a range of both<br />
military and civil ab-lications. Its outstanding short take-off and<br />
landing ( STOL) characteristics, with its rugged performance in operating<br />
from rough fields should ensure its sales success. A novel lateral.<br />
control system, providing safe operation at or near the stalling speed,<br />
overcomes one of the major hazards in STOL operation".<br />
" These factors together with the combination of a relatively<br />
high crubing speed with a good rate of climb and excellent rangepayload<br />
capabilities puts this aircraft in a market slot in which there<br />
is no present competitor."<br />
" Project IN' represents a significant design achievement by<br />
Australians and the team at GAF is to be congratulated."<br />
