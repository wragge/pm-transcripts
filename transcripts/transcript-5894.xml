FOR MEDIA FRIDAY, 20 AUGUST, 1982<br />
ADDRESS TO FINANCIAL REVIEW LUNCHEON<br />
This year's Budget above all faces up to the real problems<br />
confronting the Australian economy; the real difficulties,<br />
the hardship, with which the world recession is confranting ordinary<br />
Australians. It provid-s a basis on which we can sk a: ni e; xect the : h.. ole<br />
Australian community to work together to ensure that the damage<br />
we suffer during the world downturn is limited and that we<br />
stand prepared to take the fullest possible advantage of world<br />
recovery when it eventually comes.<br />
There is no question that the Australian econony is suffering<br />
significantly as a result of the continuing world economic<br />
downturn, to an extent which no-one anticipated even just 12<br />
months ago.<br />
As the Financial Review stated in a recent series of articles<br />
on the dilemmas of current economic policy, with the benefit<br />
of hindsight it is obvious that an Australian recession had to<br />
come. What no-one anticipated was that the global economy<br />
would slip into a recession so bad and so prolonged following<br />
the 1979/ 80 oil price shocks. But when six of the major<br />
seven world economies have seen industrial production fall or<br />
stagnate; when industries such as steel and motor vehicles<br />
in the United States are operating at half capacity; when<br />
world trade has fallen in value for the first time in over<br />
years; when protective barriers are being raised; when real<br />
interest rates persist at historically high levels despite<br />
some welcome falls in the U. S. in recent weeks; when unemployment<br />
in the O. E. C. D. countries is already about 30 million, and predicted<br />
to go higher; who can doubt that there is a serious world<br />
economic problem Who can be surprised that Australia has<br />
been affected, although as a result of Government policies<br />
and our resource endownments it has taken'longer than<br />
in most countries for the effects to work through. Declining<br />
export markets, combined with significant falls in the world<br />
prices of many of our products, have now hit us hard and<br />
together with the high real interest rates world wide, have<br />
significantly affected investment in Australia, although it<br />
-is encouraging that investment is still continuing at a<br />
relatively high level. 2 </p>
<p>As I have been saying for some time, and again as the Financial<br />
Review has supported in its recent articles, real recovery<br />
cannot be expected in Australia as long as the U. S.<br />
economy continues in recession; and while there have been<br />
hopeful signs in terms of activity and interest rates in the<br />
I'll only 1elieve in a real and suistained<br />
recovery in the U. S. when I actually see it.<br />
The difficulties facing Australia, and Austrhlians, are not,-<br />
however, liuited to those created by condi'ion s in the rest<br />
if the w9rlA. Industrial relations problems, including<br />
n the vital area of our export ports, have threatened our<br />
reputation as a reliable supplier; and while wage settlements<br />
in maz,.-y over3eas countries have been at or below increases<br />
in consumer prices; Australia's wages have risen at rates aell<br />
above the CPI; and our labour costs have been further increased<br />
by the continued push for shorter hours.<br />
Against this background, our import competing industries as<br />
well as our export industries have suffered a significant<br />
loss of competitiveness; profitability has been severely<br />
squeezed; investment and activity have stagnated; jobs n. ave<br />
been lost, and the growth of employment has fallen.<br />
As a consequence, there are real difficulties, not only for<br />
businesses, but for all Australians. In the face of<br />
these difficulties there are a number of things we can, and we mus.<br />
do. Above all, we must do what we can to minimise the damage"<br />
to the Australian economy, and the Australian people, of the<br />
world recession; we must do what we can to continue to build<br />
up the Australian economy, and to prepare ourselves to take<br />
advantage of recovery when it eventually does come; and<br />
we must work together to solve the-problems that have put our<br />
competitiveness at risk.<br />
In this context, it was clear to the Government that the<br />
1982/ 83 Budget had to balance, on the one hand, the need<br />
to assist those facing real difficulties, to provide a sound<br />
basis for working together; and on the other, the need to<br />
maintain a responsible approach to economic management,<br />
to provide a sound basis for taking advantave of any signs of world<br />
recovery. In balancing these two requirements, the Government<br />
was faced with the fact that its budgetary position was<br />
already being directly affected by the economic downturn,<br />
through declining growth of tax revenues and rising expenditure<br />
commitments. Indeed, before any decisions were made, we faced<br />
the prospect of an increase in the deficit of around $ 1 billion<br />
as a direct consequence of economic conditions. In the<br />
circumstances,. the Government decided that the. balance it sought<br />
would be secured by a Budget which gave real-help to Australia's<br />
families and other sectors of the cormunity by absorbing many<br />
of the direct effects of the downturn; / 3 </p>
<p>but which maintained a modest domestic Budget surplus of the<br />
order of $ 200 million, co i-ined with he maintenance cf a<br />
money supply ' target growth in the range of 9-11%. To have<br />
required a larger domrestic surplus would have compounded the<br />
difficulties being faced by Australian families and Australian<br />
businesses; to have gone to a significant domestic deficit,<br />
as advocated by Labor, would have fueled inflation and put<br />
further pressure on interest rates. That would have involved<br />
a reversal of our basic strategy, and an acceptance of the<br />
destructive socialist policies still advocated by Mr Hayden,<br />
despite all the evidence including the recent experience<br />
of France that they just don't work.<br />
To put the Budget into a correct perspective it is important<br />
to view it in both an historical and an international context.<br />
The overall deficit implied by a $ 200 million domestic surplus<br />
is some $ 1,700 million, just on 1% of GDP. In relation to<br />
GDP this is a deficit about one-fifth of that at at the end<br />
of Labor's disastrous three years in office, and less than<br />
one-third of current deficit levels in the United States,<br />
in the United Kingdom, in Japan, in France, in Canada, and<br />
in West Germany. Our consistent deficit reductions in<br />
earlier years have put Australia in an enormously strong and<br />
fortunate position, by giving us some room to manoeuvre<br />
responsibly in this year's difficult circumstances, if the<br />
US was moving towards a Budget deficit of just 1% of GDP,<br />
who would doubt that world recovery was on the way? But<br />
the Government is determined to maintain the Budget deficit<br />
at the lowest levels in relation to GDP consistent with<br />
dealing with new economic circumstances, in a balanced<br />
manner, as they emerge.<br />
With a surplus on domestic transactions, the Budget will<br />
not add to liquidity in the economy, to inflationary pressures<br />
or to pressures on interest rates; and together with the<br />
maintenance of a firm approach to monetary management, including<br />
use of the new elements of flexibility to financial management<br />
decided at the June Loan Council, it sustains our strategy<br />
of responsible but responsive economic management. The<br />
Budget's greatest strength is that within this overall<br />
strategy it gives substantial help to Australia's families<br />
and needy sectors of the community, while also providing<br />
a basis on which to expect a real measure of wage restraint.<br />
All taxpayers will benefit significantly from changes in the<br />
personal income tax rate scale, including a reduction in the<br />
standard rate of 30 cents in the dollar, and adjustments<br />
to important thresholds, which will cost almost $ 1,500 million<br />
this financial year. Those who are buying or planning to buy<br />
homes will benefit from the general tax rebate on mortgage<br />
interest payments, and from the request we have made to the<br />
reserve bank for a 1% SRD release for lending for housing<br />
purposes. And there are further benefits directed specifically<br />
at families, especially single-income and low-income families;<br />
through an increase in the family allowance for the first<br />
and second child; through the $ 200 addition to dependent<br />
rebates where there are dependant children; and through the<br />
new income supplement available to low-income families. / 4 </p>

the beginning of 1983, all student allowances<br />
are being substantially increased, in some cases by as<br />
much as 20%; and the family income means tests applying to both<br />
secondary and tertiary' education allowances are to be considerably<br />
eased. The secondary allowance scheme designed to help children<br />
from families with mQdest incomes to complete the final two<br />
years of schooling and hence to acquire vital skills and<br />
expanded opportunities, has been given particular emphasis,<br />
S. A. S. living allowances have been increased by 20%, and the<br />
family income means test levels have been increased by some 44%<br />
to the substantially more generous levels that apply to the<br />
Tertiary Fducation Allowance Scheme. Assistance to T. A. F. E.<br />
and to school-to-work transition programs is also being considerably<br />
increased in line with the Government's recognition of the<br />
importance of the acquisition of education and skills which<br />
equip young people for the needs of today's labor markets.<br />
Expenditure on employment and training programs particularly<br />
those which assist the young unemployed, is to increase by 21%<br />
to $ 250 million, and will provide assistance to an estimated<br />
252,000 people. Under these programs, increased expenditure on<br />
assistance for work experience will allow 74,000 new placements<br />
in 1982-83, and increases of up to 36% in the rate of subsidy<br />
to employers, while significant increases in outlays on the<br />
C. R. A. F. T. -scheme will encourage and enable employers to receive<br />
assistance for some 111,000 apprentices in 1982-83, an.. increase<br />
on the record 99,000 in 1981-82<br />
Additional assistance to businesses through the Budget comes<br />
in variety of forms, both direct and indirect; and this year,<br />
for the first time, direct Budget outlays on industry assistance<br />
and development will exceed $ 1,000 million.<br />
The Budget builds on the package of measures announced on<br />
19 July, designed to support the efforts of Australian industry<br />
to restore its competitiveness especially through more generous<br />
depreciation provisions.<br />
Among the tax reforms in the Budget, there is a furthe--<br />
increase from 70% to 80% in the retention allowance for<br />
private companies, which will give a full year benefit of<br />
million to small business, and fulfill a 1980 election<br />
commitment. The Government also proposes to introduce measures<br />
to allow losses suffered by one company in h group to be offset<br />
against taxable income of other companies in the group,<br />
provided the group satisfied a 100% common ownership requirement,<br />
thus removing a disadvantage of company groups vis-a-vis<br />
integrated companies.<br />
Moreover, the general tax rebate for housing introduced in<br />
the Budget should provide stimulus to the building industry<br />
and related manufacturers, while the personal tax reductions<br />
will generate increased spending and activity across-the-board.<br />
Business will also benefit from the stimulus to activity<br />
and employment that will flow from the substantial increase<br />
in Commonwealth capital works spending and grants for capital<br />
purposes, including a 68% increase in the Budget financed civil<br />
work3 program. </p>
<p>In addition to substantial amounts to be spent on airport<br />
development, aged and disabled person accommodation, and. through<br />
grants to the States for spending on welfare housing and the<br />
normal roads program, the government has introduced the new<br />
Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. Through<br />
its contribution to improving Australia's transport and<br />
communications system, this program will benefit all<br />
industries in the long term as well as giving an immediate<br />
boost to the corstruction industry. The program will enable<br />
the completion of a national road system of acceptable<br />
standards by 1988 as well as facilitating improvements in<br />
urban and rural arterial roads and local roads. It will be<br />
funded from a special surcharge on the petrol and diesel excise<br />
and including the $ 150 million to be spent in 1982-83 is<br />
expected to involve a total expenditure of about $ 2.5 billion<br />
over 6 years. It is worth noting that the better road system<br />
that will result from this program, together with the removal of<br />
exemptions from excise on diesel fuel for railways under the<br />
new rebate system for certain off-road users of distillate,<br />
will offer a more equal basis for competition between road<br />
transport and railways.<br />
Other innovations contained in the Budget of interest to<br />
business include the new tax relief on dividend income<br />
which will provide a rebate at the standard tax rate for up<br />
to $ 1000 of dividend income at a cost of $ 75 million in a<br />
full year. This measure will give encouragement to investors,<br />
particularly small investors, and should assist business to<br />
raise the funds it needs to build for the future.<br />
Particularly in the light of widespread representations from<br />
industry, we have also decided to provide an incentive to<br />
employee share participation schemes, by freeing from tax<br />
benefits arising from the price at which shares are issued<br />
under approved schemes. The Government believes that this<br />
concession will allow the development of schemes that will<br />
create among employees a greater feeling bf sharing in the<br />
fortune of companies that employ them, and that it will provide<br />
benefits to productivity and industrial relations.<br />
There is no doubt that this Budget has improved the position<br />
of Australia's families substantially; no doubt that it has<br />
improved the position of needy groups in the community<br />
substantially; no doubt that the higher deficit which would<br />
have been necessary to allow for greater benefits would have<br />
threatened the very foundations of Australia's future economic<br />
strength. This Budget provides an opportunity which Australia simply cannot<br />
afford to miss for coniunity-wide support of wage restraint and<br />
co-operation. The kind of co-operation which Australia needs<br />
today cannot be achieved by Governments alone. It cannot be<br />
imposed as a matter of Government policy. The Government has<br />
done what it can in giving a lead, and providing a basis for<br />
co-operation to prevent any new wage-push and I believe the<br />
community will want all responsible groups to heed the Government's<br />
call to work together. / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Even before the Budget was brought down, there was<br />
growing support for the sort of moderation in wage increases<br />
that is so important to Australia's economic and social future.<br />
The Tripartite Conference between the ACTU, the CAI and the<br />
Government showed an important degree of agreement that<br />
excessive wage increases would throw people out of work,-<br />
and in more recent times, both the President and the Secretary<br />
of the ACTU have spoken out strongly in favour of wage<br />
moderation. Moreover, following the Remuneration Tribunal's recommendation of<br />
salary increases well below the inflation rate for parliamentarians<br />
and senior public servants, recommendations which the Government<br />
accepted, the Academic Salaries Tribunal made similar recorrrendations;<br />
and some leading companies have announced a freeze<br />
on salaries, or very sm. all increases.<br />
Because of my belief in the critical importance of wage moderation,<br />
especially at this time, I took the opportunity to write to a<br />
number of companies, to State Premiers and to the ACTU and the<br />
CAI, to explain the nature of those decisions, and to seek their<br />
support for them in their own decisions.<br />
The example that had already been established in this way offered<br />
a basis for some optimism that restraint might be widely achieved<br />
and the decisions made in the Budget give all the more reason<br />
to ask for and expect that responsible wage decisions will occur<br />
throughout the workforce. Equally important to Australia's<br />
future is stability and co-operation in the area of industrial<br />
relations. Since February of this year, we have experienced a<br />
significant reduction in the unacceptably high and damaging<br />
levels of industrial disputation which were experienced through<br />
the second half of 1981.<br />
And a significant example of co-operation between unions,<br />
management and Governments has been provided by the agreement<br />
reached, based on the Crawford Report, to make shipping flow more<br />
smoothly through our ports. Governments themselves, State and<br />
Federal, equally need to co-operate and to face<br />
difficulties together. And the recent discussions between the<br />
Federal Government, the Governments of NSW and Queensland and<br />
the coal industry, to solve the problems that have plagued<br />
one of our great export industries, has shown what can be<br />
achieved when common interests are recognised and pursued.<br />
If we can all work together, if we recognise the benefits which<br />
flow to usiall from reasoned discussicn rather tbvi conflict about the<br />
claims of different groups then, but only then, will we<br />
put ourselves in a position to take advantage of all the<br />
Sopportunities and strengths that Australia possesses. Then, but<br />
only then, will we be able to keep building Australia up.<br />
