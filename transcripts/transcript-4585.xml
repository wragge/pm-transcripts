SYD) NEY OPERA BOUSE RALLY<br />
On Satuzday, Australian man and wom~ en from all walk~ s of life wi<br />
make a decision that will determine the path our great country'<br />
Z: will take for-decades to comne.<br />
The alternatives are clear.. Will you choose our poices of<br />
developument and confidence,' our policiea of ruccess? WAJl~ yoiu<br />
roject Labor'sa policies of futi-lity and fear, their policies<br />
of failure?<br />
Thio election is a tuining point in our mnaturing as a naitio~ n.<br />
Austxalia is poised to move into0 the 80' s and beyond with a n~ ew<br />
found con~ fidence, a new spirlit, a new-sense. of securi~ ty, a nogw<br />
sense of national purpose.<br />
The first stage of the job we were elected to do has beub done.<br />
We are now ready to stride into a new era of pyosperity anrd<br />
develoyment. We pxomised we would cut the inflation we inherited. Inflation,<br />
is dowrn to 9% and it's falling. We promnised to controlI Covernlbent.<br />
spen3inJ. We have halved Labor's $ 4,500 million defi. cit. W<br />
vpromised to revive incentive and restore fair rewaxd'-for achievtmeni<br />
We have substantially cut the taxes of every Australian. It's now<br />
-orth working overtime again. We promised to get this great country<br />
of ours, moving again. Industry is starting to invest again, our<br />
natural resources are being opened Up ornce more, and there In~ iew<br />
foun( d confidenice in our manufacturing industry. $ 6,000 million)<br />
dolars 6-oxth of projects axke under way or ready to go anid InaTy<br />
Lillono of dollars viore are in the pipeline.<br />
lie all have to work together to ensure that we build on the f irm<br />
foundations we have laid. The future is before us, a future which<br />
pro~ misee work and prosperity for all Australians.<br />
This3 pr. omifse will be realised under a Liberal Goverinent wI) ic~ h has<br />
the only policies to keep our country growing. Policies which are<br />
dom onstr~ ab; ly succee-ding, policies that will g-varantee Pustralia's.<br />
gro~ wth, develc'puient and the creation of new jobs. We will push<br />
ir: 1latic-n down to between six and eight percent by next June. % ve<br />
* 1illpl ije'ustry . nvestingj, we will keep interest rates fz! 1ljn<br />
d~ nas ' uch 4S two percent over the next twelve gionths. </p>
<p>T~ hat'S a saving of $ 520 a year, $ 10 a week to the average yolunq<br />
couple buying a new hocne.<br />
Hlost importantly we will get unemployment down. We've got the Ycal<br />
answer to uneyfployment; investment that means jobs, getting<br />
interest rates down that means jobs, restraini~ ng Goverrnment<br />
expenditure that mneans jobs.<br />
Because of our prudence in Governmnt spending, ' we. can af ford tmore<br />
tax cuts for all Australian taxpayers. They will start on the f irst<br />
of ~ Epb~ max?, jumi tien months, awy The* i u1-ib-ma pg-I<br />
ingcome and inject $ 26.7 million a wee); into the economy.<br />
Because we have reduced infl ' ation the tax cuts will create mcoio jobs.<br />
b~ ecause people can spend more, our -factories will have to prodluce<br />
gcore. There will be a demand for more employees. That is why, f-o-r<br />
rext February, unemployment will fall and keep on falling. We are<br />
determined to foster ' Australian industrys. new found vitali. ty.<br />
' This. Government buys Au'stralian, not the cheapest foreign products<br />
our predecessors favoured. We will give export sales fresh iz~ petos<br />
with a new five-year export incentive scheme. We will provi~ e<br />
tspecial help to Australian businesees competing for over seas. pr ci<br />
We will actively promote more* processing in Australia of . our ba: sic<br />
Yaw materials. To small -busirieswmen we will make finance more<br />
. readily available.<br />
Unlike the Labor Party, we are gliving Australian industry, hAuralJos<br />
jobs an~ d Australian woihers, the protection they n~ eed. we have<br />
increased protection for industries employing over a. guarter of a<br />
rt-llion Itustralian men and womnr.* Our swift a-ad effecti'j actior,<br />
ha6 meant the survival of' industrie~ s such as the appatel, tentiles<br />
anid footwear industries, industrics emTploying 120,000 perq~ e.<br />
bsast wieek, -the Labor Party refused point bla-nk to Bupport oul action.<br />
They turned their backs on' 120,000 % yorkiflg Australians, 80% of ~ r<br />
axe umoman anid ruany of whom are miirants.<br />
ThR~ Premier of South Australia3 and Raw)( e support the firm stand<br />
we have taken.. Lut they were over-ruolvd. Over-ruledi by' the vt: ry)<br />
riien, Fhr. WViitlanr and Kx-, ) uyaen, who now parade concern for the<br />
unemployed. ti-.~ brthat is the Pirty of iireploment. it Was KJz. Whitl) n,<br />

Yi 11ay just one year ater, that nusnber had fallen to 1,. 250,10(<br />
a drop of 10,300.<br />
Itr. Whitliarl n ad~ e unFMployment a deliberate, calculated part of<br />
Goverrayient policy. Ie went anti cut tariffs despite the fact that brw-<br />
as warned by a top level report that such a alash iii tariffs<br />
vwould thro~ w tens of thousands out of w~ ork.<br />
Now he wants to do At higairt, Labor's tariff policy would cause kuaq: s<br />
unemnploymnent. Labor's Intentions towards the clothing, textile ano<br />
footwear aiustrles are h~ ready at-iintantly clear. </p>
<p>WThich other industries has Li! bUr mrkt-ad for the goillotine? is it<br />

The F. xecutive Director of the Appiuxel ? 4abufacturern hop aid: " No<br />
could be certain of isurvival If a Labor Party camne to<br />
ruvwertt And he's right.<br />
n~ o wonder a recent Victoriar, suirvey r'eveals the overwhelming<br />
conaviction~ of manufactu~ rers that they would suffer adversely, that<br />
things would be worse urider a Ldbor Government. And that conviction<br />
was 5 trongest among smiall b a i~ men. Stronger even ths'n in 1975.<br />
Labor wiould harm business. Its crxrvritment to reducirig tariffs would<br />
create Vnem~ ployiment. Its conititic-nt to hbigher taxes would. reduce<br />
demand3 ac create unemployment. I. ibxr wants a " crash" spending<br />
program~ a that would irivcolve 6800 million in six months-.... Tha.-,*<br />
an aninual rate of $ 1,600 million a year. And they have ther. g<br />
p~ romnises worth billions of tdollrs they haven't even ' costed.<br />
rll this woold more than double-the deficit, unleash inflation once<br />
again, and increase. interest rates. This could only have one result,<br />
it uN-uld create more unteniployment.<br />
Thiaijv not just que55 work. We k~ now from bitter expirience that thMa<br />
is what unould occur. Por ther ten years before Laojbt to ffi<br />
ave-rage unemployment was W'ithin three years, 4. LaLb. had; iniease<br />
unemployment to 5.4% of the wcrk~ force, in one year Labor i ncrtased<br />
uncmployment by 157%, by almost 200, 000 people.*.*<br />
LaLor has Paid it would repeal ni~ r February first tax Cuts, Theie<br />
tax cuts are fair. People onr average earnings of $ 10,00D a yearwill<br />
pay a marginal rate of tax of anly 3Z. cents in-the doll&amp;= Under<br />
the Hayden scales it was 45 ccents-. rrouir Pebruary f irst, it witl be<br />
32 cents right.-up to $ 16, 000-.<br />
These tax cuts are subsat~ ial. Over 90% of taxpayers will pay less<br />
tha onre 9uazter of the* r 5n~ i~ nu e tax. These tax cuts are.<br />
sign~ ificant social reform. A quarter of a million~ low income<br />
earners, tons of thousands of p) enc Qners, widows, an. istudents. wt<br />
taxable inceines under $ 3,750 a year,. will no longer pay any tax* at all<br />
These are thie people Labor forge~ t. To pay for abolitionk of payroll<br />
tax, Labor would have to incrt-ali personal taxes by $ 850 million<br />
this year, $ 1,900 million next. Only the present members of the<br />
Labor Party would seriously put lorward a plan to rip $ 850 million<br />
this year and $ 1,900 million next year out of the hunds of the working<br />
men and women of Australia. hnd use it to pay big and jiofitable<br />
comipanies. No jobs would be ocated. The companies hiave " aid go. </p>

come again for a very long tire.<br />
While our economic recovery Is~ underway, we are helping those looking<br />
for work to improve their skills and thus be equipped to tak~ e new jobs<br />
as they arise. Already 120,000 people have been helped by our<br />
tzailifl andi job assistance sohemes, and the numbor is~ &amp; teadily<br />
growing. We are wuking sof f icient rooney available to ensure that no-one<br />

As : E announcea in my policy spteech, we will expand3 the very successful<br />

the ) 4EAr scheme. We wll spend 350 million over anti above excisting<br />
comnitznent to overhaul outinode4 iriner-city technical colleages.-<br />
in addition, we are tackling the-more-fundamental problem of improvinq<br />
arid adapting the education of our children to meet more closely the<br />
requimnts of the Australian job market. The Willianta inquiry has<br />
been appointed to, examine-this~ vexed issue. And we-% Ixill act-swiftly,<br />
and decisively. when the YRepot is 6' xceived.<br />
We have a constructive, coraprehensIve and coherent strategy to provide<br />
