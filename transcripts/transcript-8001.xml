The present Secretary of the Department of Immigration,<br />

Cabinet in 1981 and has held'a number of senior positions in<br />
that Department. He was Principal Private Secretary to the<br />
Prime Minister from 1986-88.<br />
The early part of his career, from 1965 until 1979, was in<br />
the Department of Foreign Affairs. During that period he<br />
was posted in London, in Bonn and in Manila, as well as<br />
spending two years at the Asian Development Bank as an<br />
Alternate Director.<br />
