FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 37/ 1969<br />
DEBATE ON DEFENCE SPACE RESEARCH FACILITY<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Leader of the Opposition had a complete opportunity<br />
this evening to agree that my statement should be taken note of by the<br />
House. This gave the Opposition the opportunity for a full debate at a<br />
time of their choosing. He indicated that he did not want this opportunity. If<br />
he has now changed his mind I should be glad to accommodate him by<br />
providing the chance for a debate on whether or not it is to Australia's<br />
interest to join with the United States in arrangements which will<br />
benefit the United States, ourselves and the free world and which are<br />
in full accord with the spirit of the Anzus Treaty.<br />
CANBERRA 23 April 1969 </p>
