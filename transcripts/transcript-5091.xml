PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT FRIDAY, 29 JUNE 1979<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE: FOLLOWING PREMIERS CONFERENCE<br />
( LATE AFTERNOON)<br />
Tape begins as follows:<br />
Prime minister<br />
I think there was a very keen disappointment that the matter<br />
was again held up today.<br />
The Governments of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania<br />
and the Commonwealth have decided to establish an inquiry into<br />
an integrated south east Australian electricity power group,<br />
through co-operative enterprise and to see whether better<br />
planning arrangements will enable this to take place.<br />
For example, one of the matters that will be discussed is the<br />
prospect of linking up the Victorian and South Australian<br />
grids at Mt.* Gainbier. The prospect of a major aluminium<br />
smelter in Western Victoria makes this all the more sensible<br />
than might otherwise have been the case. Tasmania is involved,<br />
because as we know, the ready availability of hydro-power is<br />
diminishing in that State; much less than it was. Now there<br />
are those who are beginning to look and perhaps in the longer<br />
term to plan for a power link from Victoria to Tasmania.<br />
Tasmania actively wanted to be involved in this particular study.<br />
The Commonwealth is involved because of its general concern,<br />
even though these matters are in the prerogative of the States.<br />
The three States and the Commonwealth hope that N. S. W. might well<br />
join the study at some future time. Because quite plainly,<br />
it makes a great deal of sense, especially a bit close to the<br />
State boundaries, to plan the development of power sources and<br />
supply and lines and development in an integrated way.<br />
Why N. S. W. is unwilling to take part at this stage I don't think<br />
I or the other Premiers quite understand that. This matter was<br />
first raised by the Commonwealth with Victoria and South Australia<br />
I think two or three years ago. But in any case, the States that<br />
I have mentioned South Ai~ stralia, Victoria and Tasmania, ana<br />
the Commonwealth will now be launching that study so that there<br />
can be the best possible planning and use of resources.<br />
The other element of the decision was that there was a general<br />
desires amongst Premiers in future years to discuss road funding<br />
in the Premiers Conf erence rather than with the functional<br />
Ministers. They also wanted to have an opportunity of discussing<br />
education funding. The Commonwealth has offered not resistance<br />
to that at all. These matters will broad in the ambit of the<br />
discussions with the Premiers. </p>
<p>2.-<br />
Prime Minister-( continued)<br />
All in all, I think it has been a highly successful conference.<br />
I know Premiers didn't get all the funds that they hoped. I am<br />
not sure that their disappointment was as great as might sometimes<br />
be evident from the words they use. But on the financial matters,<br />
it is always a question of Premiers asking for more and the<br />
Commonwealth having to hold the line. on those particular matters<br />
it is not really an evenly weighted conference in terms of<br />
numbers. I don't think I have yet seen a Premier arguing that<br />
less money should be spent on a particular matter. That makes<br />
a free flow of debate difficult on that sort of issue.<br />
On the other matters those ones that I have just mentioned<br />
on industrial relations, on energy co-operation, but particularly<br />
on the Seas and Submerged Lands Act, on all of these it is has<br />
been a highly successful conference and one that will advance'<br />
sensible and co-operative arrangements between the Commonwealth<br />
and the States.<br />
I particularly emphasise the practical matters comi ng out of<br />
the Seas and Submerged Lands Act. I don't think we generally<br />
realise the difficulty that that posed for States, and in a<br />
sense for the Commonwealth, as a result of the High Court decision<br />
because the normal authority of States and their administration<br />
was thrown into jeopardy. It has been vitally important that<br />
practical and sensible arrangements, governing and co-ordinating<br />
State activities offshore, should be introduced and maintained.<br />
Now, in relation to mining and fisheries and navigation and<br />
pollution, and in Marine Parks and a number of other matters<br />
there are navigation matters there are a set of agreements and<br />
there will be a set of joint authorities which have really<br />
established a historic pattern.<br />
Again, I express my appreciation for the work officials and<br />
Ministers, especially involved, have done in achieving this<br />
advance. Question Sir Charles Court has put out a statement saying that you have<br />
in fact agreed to restrictural veto concerning offshore mining<br />
and the Commonwealth veto in the national interest.. What is your<br />
position regarding that veto.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, it is a question of the mechanism in which it will be<br />
used. The joint authority will be established in Western Australia.<br />
Applications will go to the West and I can well understand<br />
Sir Charles not wanting people applying to somebody in Canberra<br />
for a matter that is going to involve development off the<br />
Western Australian coast. But, if there is disagreement in<br />
relation to it, that disagreement would go to Ministers. It would<br />
then, if necessary', be reported by Minister to Cabinet and in<br />
the end would be settled on a Prime Minister to Premier level. </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime minister ( continued)<br />
It has been indicated in the agreement that we would only want<br />
to go against the views and wishes of the State in these<br />
particular matters if it was contrary to the national interest.<br />
You would have to judge circumstances as they arose. You can't<br />
postulate a set of circumstances and then fit particular<br />
applications into a neat box. It won't work that way.<br />
I think the arrangement is a practical one. Even though there<br />
had been an agreement with all the other States they saw the<br />
codicil to the agreement, in a sense, with Western Australia and<br />
they were happy with that modification on the part of the West.<br />
They didn't want the modification adopted in their own joint<br />
authorities. But I think it is a very good result. There are<br />
some special circumstances in the West because of distance,<br />
because it is a great mining State without the industrial base<br />
of some others.<br />
Question<br />
Was there any agreement on the tax sharing-formula to take<br />
effect from June of next year.<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I made it quite plain that the Commonwealth does not approve of<br />
the present guarantee; it was a limited guarantee and that: that<br />
guarantee could not continue. At the same time we expressed<br />
a willingness to have ongoing consultations with officials to<br />
see whether some arrangements can be devised that would assist<br />
the States. Now the main reason for that guarantee or the<br />
fact that it is not acceptable to the Commonwealth is that in<br />
terms of Government expenditure it is of a kind that just can't be<br />
sustained. In the days when Government expenditure was expanding<br />
it wasn't maybe of all that much importance. But a three percent<br />
factor, which means three percent i . iore in real terms<br />
each year, year after year, being built into payments for the<br />
States, was a very large amount indeed. In days when Governments<br />
need to restrain expenditure they can't expect to get three percent<br />
more in real terms year after year. of course, the fact that that<br />
guarantee now applies I think to all States but one is really a mark<br />
of the extent to which the Commonwealth has in fact reduced taxes.<br />
The figures didn't emerge in the Premiers Conference but if this<br />
year we had been taxes on the basis of the earlier Hayden scales<br />
we would have collected $ 3,000m more in this particular financial<br />
year. The States would have got 40 percent of that, which was<br />
percent of $ 3000 m" about $ 1200 million. Now that just<br />
indicates the extent of and success of efforts to reduce personal<br />
taxes. That's obviously had an impact on the 40 percent tax<br />
sharing arrangements with the States and is one which they are<br />
not All that pleased with. Again, when the original proposals<br />
were introduced, there was a staqe two. We have legislated for<br />
stage two which would give the States the right to add on a<br />
surcharge or to allow an additional rebate to reduce taxes further<br />
within their own States. Now I think it has become pretty plain<br />
over a passage of time that the States are unwilling to accept<br />
that additional responsibility for their own affairs. The Canadian </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
States have that additional responsibility. They exercise it<br />
both ways; heavier taxes or lower taxes in the Canadian Provinces.<br />
But the Australian States have indicated that they won't want to<br />
have that particular responsibility even though it would never<br />
have meant separate tax forms and all of th~ at. -People would still<br />
be paying one tax. Alright, if the States don't want to do that,<br />
that's their decision. But they can't expect us to pick up the<br />
difference for them by imposing additional taxes on their behalf,<br />
because we are just not going to do it. Now all of that I think<br />
has been made very plain to the States. But against that background<br />
we are prepared to examine the arrangements to see if some<br />
arrangements which in our view are financially responsible can<br />
be made that would in part meet the wishes of the States for a<br />
greater degree of certainty. Officials will work and examine that<br />
and it is envisaged that there will be a Premiers Conference before<br />
the end of this year on industrial relations. This matter will be<br />
picked up at that Conference.<br />
Question_<br />
You said virtually that they are going to get a lot less next year.<br />
Did that break up the Conference with an air of bitterness.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. I think there was a great deal of goodwill in this particular<br />
conference. I was speaking to a number of Premiers after it was<br />
all over and during the course of the afternoon it was a very<br />
good natured meeting with one or two very minor exceptions.<br />
The point I made was that it would enable there to be much better<br />
balance in the total financial arrangements because quite plainly<br />
if the tax reimbursement formula hadn't-been increasing 13% to 14%,<br />
L9 if that increase had been less, then-it would have been possible<br />
to adopt a much more relaxed attitude in relation to capital works.<br />
That would have led to a better balanced result overall.<br />
That was the point that we made in particular with the Premiers.<br />
Question Could I just ask the Treasurer a question please. Why did the<br />
Government decide this week to over-turn its mini-budget decision<br />
on hospital operating costs.-Where do you expect to be able to<br />
recoup the additional $ 130 million approximately that's effectively<br />
foregone by this decision this week.<br />
Mr. Howard<br />
The decision that was taken and announced in the mini-budget,<br />
if I correctly recall., the words were that we should, having<br />
announced our desire to have an inquiry, we would seek to hold<br />
expenditure at the same level. It wasn't an explicit statement<br />
by the Government that it was going to spend " 1X" million dollars<br />
in meeting half the net operating costs of hospitals during 1979/ 80.<br />
It was an expression of what we would seek to do. I don't really<br />
think you can categorise the decision ultimately taken as being<br />
an over-turning of that decision. We hadn't made a firm decision<br />
on how much we would contribute. That's why the May 24 statement </p>
<p>Mr. Howard ( continued)<br />
was couched in those fairly general words. The amount that we<br />
have agreed to contribute is an increase in money terms what<br />
you've mentioned I think $ 130 million or in that order. But is<br />
about $ 54 million less than the States asked for. Bear in mind<br />
that we are in the business of trying to persuade the States<br />
to have an inquiry into one of the areas where we think there has<br />
been major wastage and where we believe there is a desire on the<br />
part of the States when they stop playing politics on the subject,<br />
particularly the State of to have a very serious inquiry,,<br />
Whilst there could have been a contribution to those costs which<br />
was less than what has in fact been made, I think in all of the<br />
circumstances we've made the right decision on it. It's just not:<br />
correct to say that that it represents no determining of decision<br />
which we hadn't made at the time of the mini-budget, the final<br />
decision on how much we'd contribute.<br />
Question<br />
On the tax-sharing formula once more, do you think that it is<br />
unreasonable to the Commonwealth purely because of the betterment<br />
factor or is it also because the share itself is too much?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think the betterment tax is a very significant element but there<br />
is another element in it also which would give us cause for concern<br />
and that's the extent to which the States have compensated for Wage<br />
changes and that, and you know we mentioned that in relation to<br />
New South Wales legislation to be what is ultimately going to be<br />
a 35 hour week in the power industry and I think, that that action<br />
coupled with New South Wales Government's court for the State A. WI. U.<br />
has been significant in helping to cause the degree of industrial.<br />
unrest in New South Wales at this very time. Because they expect:<br />
the New South Wales Government to pick up, or the Tribunal's not<br />
going to give them what they want, the New South Wales Government-.<br />
can do it by legislation and it's going to take a long while to<br />
work that out of the scene in New South Wales. We said at that time<br />
when they legislated for the power industry that we'd be looking at<br />
some mechanism to make sure that the States were not automnaticall~ y<br />
compensated for wage adjustments. There's been a very uneven support<br />
for restraint in wages before the Arbitration Commission in the first<br />
quarter in the six-monthly hearings and again, why should the States<br />
be concerned, they don't have the major responsibility for inflation,<br />
for the economy and they were going to be compensated anyway for<br />
wage increases. So, it's not only the betterment factor, the wage<br />
element will be another serious element but I don't think one sho-uld<br />
necessarily assume that something like that particular guarantee<br />
will replace what's there now, but in a different form. We've said<br />
that officials can look at it, and they will in good faith, but<br />
there is no indication that, you're quite wrong to assume that there<br />
will be any particular result. Options are wide open on that. The<br />
one thing that is firm and that's the, in our comparing this with<br />
sister States, is the 39% of income tax and examinations about the<br />
guarantee to see if there are alternative ways of doing something;<br />
that would in part, help the States but which in the Commonwealthl's<br />
view would be financially responsible. ./ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Question Prime Minister, has Cabinet considered the OPEC price rise and<br />
what's the Decision?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Mr Newman is making a statement very shortly, if it hasn't already<br />
gone out and I'd prefer to leave it with him. The Decisions were<br />
made some days ago in relation to the various matters covered in<br />
Mr Newman's statement but no announcement will be made until we<br />
knew the extent of the OPEC price rise.<br />
