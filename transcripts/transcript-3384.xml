    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Prime Minister Press Statement No. 324<br />11 September 1974</strong></p>
<p>The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, today announcedÂ that he had sent a reference to the Temporary Assistance Â Authority on the question of temporary assistance for theÂ Australian industry producing footwear and parts therefor.</p>
<p>Mr Whitlam said that imports of footwear were at high levels and the Government was concerned that the industry, which has been adjusting and restructuring overÂ several years towards operation under a long term industry rateÂ of duty, does not become unduly disrupted by greater importÂ competition than originally intended. It is important,. he said, for the Government to be able to have investigationsÂ carried out so that appropriate action can be taken whereÂ necessary.</p>
<p>Mr Whitlam made the point that this was the secondÂ reference to the Temporary Assistance Authority under theÂ Industries Assistance Commission Act 1973. Under the Act the Authority is required to report to the Government (no laterÂ than thirty days from the date of the reference) on whether it is necessary that urgent action be taken to protect the industryÂ in relation to the importation of any goods. Where the Authority finds that urgent action is necessary he is asked to reportÂ Â  whether this can appropriately be provided by a temporary duty, by the temporary prohibition or restriction of imports or by aÂ combination of both a temporary duty and the temporary prohibition or restriction of imports.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also pointed out that shouldÂ Â  the need for temporary assistance emerge from the report of the Temporary Assistance Authority, goods not entered for home consumption would be subject to any temporary measures taken byÂ the Government in the light of the report.</p>
