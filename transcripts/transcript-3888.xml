EMBARGO LEm ue<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P<br />
AT THE PAPUA NEW GUINEA INDEPENDENCE CELEBRATIONS,<br />
PORT MORESBY, 16 SEPTEMBER 1975<br />
This is a day that will live in history.<br />
There can never be a more important day in a<br />
nation's history, than its birthday. But the significance<br />
of this day in the broad sweep of history goes beyond even<br />
that for Papua New Guinea, for Australia, for our region<br />
and for the Commonwealth of Nations around the world.<br />
Today Australia, herself once a group of colonies,<br />
has ended the role as a colonial power imposed upon her<br />
by an irony of history. Australid could never be truly<br />
free until Papua New Guinea was truly free. In a very real<br />
sense, this is a day of liberation for Australia as much<br />
as for Papua New Guinea.<br />
iFurther, Australia has today finally discharged<br />
her mandate from the old League of Nations and her<br />
trusteeship to the United Nations.<br />
The presence of the heir to the Crown reminds<br />
us that Papua New Guinea is the last of the significant<br />
nations to be newly created under the authority of that<br />
crown the final act in that remarkable process so<br />
brilliantly inaugurated by his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten,<br />
28 years ago. Nothing became the life of that Empire more<br />
than the manner of their -leaving it.<br />
I came here two days ago as the last Australian<br />
Prime Minister to visit a Papua New Guinea constitutionally<br />
linked to Australia. At midnight last night I became<br />
the first Australian Prime Minister to visit the new nation<br />
of Papua New Guinea. I accept the change of status with<br />
complete equanimity. It is good for the soul, in these<br />
, times which try men's souls.<br />
Let me congratulate your Government, Mr Prime<br />
Minister, on the excellent arrangements made to allow us<br />
all to take part in your indepe ' ndence celebrations. The<br />
ceremonies, the feastivities, the displays all quite<br />
. splendid. And I noticed the excellent security arrangements.<br />
In fact, I haven't felt so well protected since our first<br />
meeting five and a half years ago January 1970 in the<br />
lounge of the Sepik Motel in Wewak. The Australian security<br />
eavesdropped on our subversive talk and well they might,<br />
for we were talking about early self-government and early<br />
independence for Papua New Guinea. We brought great<br />
criticism, even ridicule and contempt, upon us in those far<br />
off days a whole five and ahYalf years ago when together<br />
we first stated that the independence of Papua New Guinea<br />
was imminent and inevitable. / 12 </p>
<p>I said then that independence for Papua New<br />
Guinea was an idea whose time had come and nothing could<br />
resist the power of that idea. In you, Mr Prime Minister,<br />
Papua New Guinea found a man whose time.. has come.<br />
In the event, Papua New Guinea's independence<br />
was her own deicsion and this day for independence was<br />
decided by her own House of Assembly a modern, single<br />
chamber parliament with equal electorates indeed,. an<br />
example for other parliaments. Her Constitution, was not<br />
devised in another land or imposed by foreigners.<br />
It emerged from her own democratic processes, from within<br />
her own democratic institutions, from her own people and<br />
their elected representatives. It has been a remarkable<br />
demonstration of political maturity.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, our two nations cannot ignore<br />
and escape our historical links, our geographic proximity,<br />
the past we share, the future we share. I am convinced<br />
neither of ups wish or will ever wish to do so. At yesterday's<br />
flag lowerii~ g ceremony, Sir John Guise stressed that the<br />
Australia flag was being lowered, not torn down. This<br />
spirit, the strength of which comes from a shared past in<br />
peace, in war, is a firm foundation for our future relationship.<br />
Australia wants the closest possible relationship<br />
with her nearest neighbour, the new nation of Papua New<br />
Guinea. A relationship of equals, based on mutual respect,<br />
understanding and trust. That trust, that understanding<br />
and that respect, is necessary for us to develop a<br />
rela~ tionship which will go well beyond normal diplomatic ties.<br />
This does not mean that we seek an exclusive<br />
relationship with Papua New Guinea. On the contrary, we<br />
recognise and appreciate that you will want to find your own<br />
place in the international community, based on your<br />
own independent assessment. The independence which we<br />
celebrate today is a genuine independence not a phoney<br />
independence. The Australian Government has stressed that a<br />
united and independent Papua New Guinea will continue to<br />
have first call on Australia'expanding aid program.<br />
I re-affirm that pledge in the strongest possible terms;<br />
te-af firm it with the full support of the Australian Government,<br />
the full support of the Australian political parties, the<br />
full support of the Australian people. I give a categorical<br />
and unequivocal assurance to the Government and people of<br />
Papua New Guinea that this nation will continue to have first<br />
call on our expanding aid program.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, tonight, I also want to<br />
re-affirm. the Australian Government's absolute, unqualified<br />
support for a united Papua New Guinea. Even when there was<br />
disagreement in Australia about the time-table for independence<br />
there was never any disagreement on this fundamental objective.<br />
Australia's policy over the years of bringing a united Papua<br />
New Guinea to independence has been supported by the overwhelming<br />
majority of your elected representative. It is a policy which </p>
<p>has been endorsed by the United Nations many times as<br />
recently as three weeks ago by the Trusteeship Council. Indeed,<br />
it was the fun ' damental condition of Australia's trusteeship.<br />
Representatives of the Trusteeship Council, of the Committee<br />
of Twenty Four and of the United Nations Secretary-General<br />
are here for the celebrations. It is more than the hope of<br />
Australia, the hope of Papua New Guinea it is the world's<br />
hope for Papua New Guinea and, one might pray, the hope of<br />
the universal church.<br />
On an occasion like this its hard to avoid<br />
euphoria, the feeling of unqualified optimism, particularly<br />
when so much of all that we hoped for, worked for, fought<br />
for, has been achieved is now a, living fact. It seems<br />
almost churlish to remind ourselves that there are<br />
difficulties, dangers, pitfalls ahead. But, of course,<br />
that is alsq a fact. It is in the nature of things.<br />
In particular Papua New Guinea * is embarking on that most<br />
difficult of all courses that effort to make democracy<br />
work. Nowh~ re in the world is this man's noblest experimentaltogether<br />
beyond challenge, beyond the possibility of failure.<br />
The particular forms, the techniques, the institutions<br />
by which democracy can prevail are always subject to development<br />
and change. Each nation will make its own experiment, its<br />
own choices. The substance of democracy, however, can be<br />
achieved if we keep in mind its basic aim the aim set out<br />
by the first group of colonies to achieve independence, 199<br />
years ago, now the United States of America that all men are<br />
born equal and have equal rights to life, liberty and the<br />
pursuit of happiness. In the great task ahead Papua New Guinea will<br />
have many friends. Australia, of course; Australia firm and<br />
unswerving in her friendship. But the representative presence<br />
in this room of so many of the nations of the world is a sure<br />
sign. that of all the great strengths which this nation enjoysthe<br />
strength of her people, the strengths of their diverse and<br />
rich cultures, the strength of her leaders not least is3<br />
the strength of the friendship she has throughout the region<br />
and the world. </p>
