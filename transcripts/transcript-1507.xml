FOR PRESS PM. No. 34/ 1967<br />
COMMONWEALTH-STATE FINA NC! A L RELATIONS:<br />
STATES' ATTITUDE<br />
At the close of today's Premiers' Conference. the<br />
Premier of New South Wales, Mr. Askin, made the following comment-<br />
" Mr. Prime Minister, before we leave, I<br />
should like to express our gratitude for what has been<br />
approved. " I am sure we al11 appreciate the friendly<br />
and considerate atmosphere that has been engendered by<br />
both yourself and the Commonwealth Treasurer. This has<br />
made our work much easier.<br />
" The short-term solution that has been put<br />
forward will prove to be very helpful to all the States. I<br />
include the bringing forward of the assessment date to 31st<br />
March. The big question, as we all know, revolves around<br />
what will come from the long-term considerations.<br />
" It is encouraging to the Premiers to note that<br />
the Commonwealth has indicated that it is prepared to look at<br />
the long-term possibilities and has even invited us to make<br />
submissions on the matter.<br />
" We can only hope that in June the merits of our<br />
proposals will receive the consideration that has been foreshadowed.<br />
If our proposals are considered on their merits,<br />
we cannot ask for any more."<br />
CANBERRA, 16th February, 1967. </p>
