    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the Australian Government I express sympathy to all those affected by the floods in South Australia following the Gawler River bursting its banks on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Like farmers across New South Wales, South Australian horticulturalists have been hard hit by this week's flooding.</p>
<p>The Australian Government, which has provided over $1.3 million for the Gawler River Flood Mitigation Scheme, is working closely with the South Australian Government and local councils to assist those affected by the floods.  Federal, state and local government representatives will meet in Adelaide next week to ensure the region has the best possible flood mitigation measures in place.</p>
<p>While the South Australian State Emergency Service (<a href="http://www.ses.sa.gov.au">www.ses.sa.gov.au</a>) is the best initial point of contact, those experiencing severe financial hardship may be eligible for crisis payments from Centrelink (tel. 132-850).  As with the terrible fires on the Eyre Peninsula, my Government will also make payments available to those who have permanently lost their principal place of residence as a result of the floods.</p>
<p>Under the existing Commonwealth-State Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements, the Australian Government will also reimburse the State Government for half the costs of personal hardship and distress expenses, such as emergency accommodation, clothing food and counselling once the State Government has reached expenditure of $240,000.</p>
<p>My Government will continue to work closely with state and local governments to assist those affected by the flooding to get back on their feet.</p>
