KI 0 PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: an overnighter in Alice Springs, one in<br />
Darwin and a major commitment in between in atherine, now<br />
time to go out and experience the rigours of the Olga. Road.<br />
PM: Well I suppose I ought to do that now if I'S going to do<br />
it because it's going to be the decison that I have announoed<br />
to make all that money available to fix the road and it's not<br />
going to be like that for much longer.<br />
Journalist: And you say the construction may start before<br />
the end of this financial year?<br />
PNt I believe so, I hope so. we think v can do the<br />
planning and the discussions with the community fairly<br />
quickly and we certainly want to son it underway as quickly<br />
as possible.<br />
Journalist: Well it seemed yesterday morning on this program<br />
the Northern Territory Minister for Tourism seemed to be<br />
completely in the dark about the proposal.<br />
PX: Well If you conduct yourself by uut getting up ad<br />
making noises and not talking to people and finding out what<br />
is happening locally you will find yourself in the dark, but<br />
that is a pretty perpetual condition for our political<br />
opponents federally as well as in this area.<br />
Journalist: Considering that there will be a major<br />
commitment, a contribut1on of funds to the project from the<br />
Northern Territory Government don't you think that there<br />
should have been a bit more communication at that point?<br />
PN: Well. I don't think the decision will come In total<br />
surprise to those that really need to know. And they will I<br />
as sure make the relatively small contribution that we<br />
are asking for so that there will be a total outlay of funds<br />
of over $ 8 million which will see the road sealed and<br />
upgraded and providing the sort of facility that the<br />
Increasing demand of tourism is making upon us. </p>
<p>Journalist: Has Mr Pools contacted you to commend your<br />
announcement?<br />
i'M; Well I haven't had any message from him, I don't know<br />
whether he has spoken, none of my people have maid they have<br />
had contact from hiz.<br />
Journalist: Given the timetable, does that mean there will<br />
be tint to conduct negotiations or consultationsh with the<br />
traditional owners of Uluru of the site location of the road.<br />
PN: I believe so of this case. Yes.<br />
Journalist! on~ to matters of defence, obviously your visit<br />
to the Northern Territory in defence related and the Tindal<br />
Air Base will represent a major resolution of this government<br />
to direct defence energies to the defence of the north. In<br />
Alice Springs an ongoing Issue remains the operations of the<br />
Pine Cap Defence Bass here in Alice Springs which has a<br />
strategic role in defence of the world, if you like, and last<br />
night you were served with a subpoena to appear in Alice<br />
Springs court in August on behalf of a gentleman called Mr<br />
Lenin Limbo who was charged with tree pass at the major<br />
demonstration at the Cap in 1907. Will you appear?<br />
PM: I doubt it.<br />
Journalist: Will you send a representative?<br />
PX: Oh look I am not talking about that. I will hand over<br />
the document to my advisers. I mean in the whole scheme of<br />
things that very importanat things in this country, that will<br />
rate if there are 16 pages of the agenda that will be<br />
somewhere near the bottom of page 16.<br />
Journalist: Not a serious move at all?.<br />
PM:, well, I have answered the question haven't I?<br />
Journalist.: Just a stunt?<br />
IN: I an not concerned to haes a go at Xr LImbo, I an just<br />
saying that if there are 16 age## detailed pages on my<br />
agenda, if it a ppears it will be at the bottom of page 16.<br />
mean there really are many, many more important things to<br />
talk about and a relatively limited amount of time I would<br />
have thqught.<br />
Journalist: Yes indeed, and considering that Pine Cap should<br />
be a source of pride to all Australians why is it the case<br />
that negotiations to continue arrangementz for its presence<br />
In Australia are they conducted in such secrecy? </p>
<p>PH. There has never been more openness about Pine Gap than<br />
under my Government. I made now two major statements in the<br />
Parliament about it, the people are better informed now than<br />
they ever been before about the purposes and functions of<br />
Pine Cap and the other joint facilities that we have in this<br />
country. Just put very very simply it is Indisputably the<br />
come that Australia and in this latter period Australia under<br />
my Government had not had this cooperation# then we would not<br />
an a world be able to Bay as we can with confidence now that<br />
there in greater hope for a peaceful world in the future nov<br />
than there over has been before, because these joint<br />
facilities have ensured that the concept of mutual deterrence<br />
has bean able to operate effectively, it has brought the two<br />
super powers to the negotiating table an d the nonsense that<br />
is put by some of the opponents that the fact of hoe i<br />
these Joint facilities ade it difficult far Austral1 i o<br />
play some part in these processes and nlegotiations<br />
demonstrated by the fact that now over 12 months ago I was<br />
able to be in the Soviet Union, personally had over three and<br />
a half hours with Xr Gorbachev, talked in detail with him<br />
about Issues of zest/ west cooperation of the processes that<br />
are underway to bring about tNo elimination of total classes<br />
of nuclear weapons and no one was able more than I was to<br />
have that sort of lengthy discussion with Mr Gorbachev.<br />
So it destroys the nonsense that is put by the opponents that<br />
because we are host to theme joint facilities we are somehow<br />
compromised and limited In our capacity to make a very<br />
significant contrituion to the processes of peace. The very<br />
opposite is the truth.<br />
Journalist: Xr Hawke, let's get an to matters of domestic<br />
relations. The compact or the treaty, the word is<br />
unimportant, any idea of, the timetable of the commitment on<br />
that? M~ When I was in Altie springs in 1967 when I first raised<br />
the concept, I said then and my timing was quite intentionalag<br />
we were coming into the Bicentennial. year, I maid that I<br />
hoped that-it may be possible to complete these processes in<br />
the lifetime of thie Parliament but I wasn't necessarily<br />
wedded to that. And I don't think we will be able to<br />
finalise it in the life of this Parliament and that<br />
represents the fact that the Aboriginal people themsaelves<br />
plus the Australian community as a whole, I think want a fair<br />
bit of time to discuss these issues to see exactly what it is<br />
that they want covered in such a treaty or compact or<br />
whatever vs call it. go I think the more realistic<br />
timetable, Meredith, in that we will see that completed in<br />
the next Parliament but with very substantial progress being<br />
made In the lifetime of this Parliament.<br />
Journalist: Is the resolution of the corn act or treaty one<br />
way to rid ourselves of the conflict, quilt and paranoiata<br />
has existed about relations between Aborigines and<br />
nora-Abor igines? </p>
<p>M3E Yes, I think so Meredith. I want to repast to your<br />
listeners, and may I preface my commenht by saying how much I<br />
have appreciated the way In which within the Northern<br />
Territory there does seem to be now a much more mature<br />
laapsptr oancighh to n anedv eyroyuo nesmaaw ptahretr. e waFsor ai npsrteatntcye pw idyeo u awreorsee tsheecrt* i on'<br />
of th. Northern Territory community. And you saw the<br />
reaction and 4s I walked around afterwards I net with a whole<br />
range of people and there was no antagonism to the things J*<br />
had been seeing. So I do pay tirbute to whit I think is an<br />
increasingly mature and intelligent approach to this issue.<br />
What I said last night is that there was no reason at all for<br />
Australians to have some sense of collective national guilt<br />
on this issue. That doesn't do anyone any lood. It is<br />
rather a rational, cold rational understanding of the fact<br />
that over the two hundred years of European settlement in<br />
Australia there have been injustices no reasonable person<br />
denies that, so it is simply acknowledging that and saying<br />
well it is to the benefit of our Aboriginal brothers and<br />
0 tshiastt erw* e adso n'wte lld waesl l twoi tthh e ab esneenfsiet ofo f guailllt ofo n ust h. i np aAsuts, tralia<br />
recognise injustices and undertake to one another that we<br />
are going to-work together for an Australia in which all.<br />
people are going to be able to live together equally as<br />
Australians. And let me make this pointg our political<br />
opponents with a totality of opportunism and with an absence<br />
of principle have characterised what I an talking about here<br />
as creating two Australias. Nothing could be further from<br />
the truth. What it is about in to make one Australia# and<br />
one Australia stronger so that our Aboriginal oitias will<br />
understand that we recognise the wrongs of the past and<br />
accept a commitment to create an Australia in which<br />
irrespective of background people are going to have * quality<br />
of opportunity. on the part of the Aborigines themselvs<br />
they are going to say well this is the case we understand<br />
that this is the commitment of the whole of Australia. That<br />
makes stronger Australia if we don't then be burdened with<br />
various senes$ as you say of paranoia# guilt and so on. We<br />
have faced up to the, issues, the indisputable fact that<br />
injustices have been done. We are intelligent and mature<br />
enough to say, yes, that is right, but we are going to do all+~<br />
we can together to make sure that those injustices are<br />
rectified and the quality of opportunity is created. Now<br />
that is just a very sensible, adult and mature way of doing<br />
things and creating a much more unified, united# strong,<br />
single Australia.<br />
Journalist: How has the experience of the Bicentennial<br />
helped us shed our guilt and paranoia? </p>
<p>PM: I think to some extent, let me be precise about that.<br />
There was an enormous amount of apprehension expressed you<br />
will recall as we came up to the 26 January in ydney<br />
when we were going to have the yreat celebrations there which<br />
I think will remain in everyone s memory as one of theoutstanding<br />
days oLthe century of our history as a nation.<br />
Now people were saying the Aborigines were going to be there<br />
and they were going to carry on, demonstrate, muck<br />
everything up. Well nothing could have been further froathe<br />
truth end it reflected enormous credit from the people that<br />
stated rightly end understandably wanted people to know their<br />
issues and their concern. They were there, but they<br />
conducted themselves very responsibly-and I may I was spoken<br />
to by representatives of the police and they couldn't have<br />
been more fullsome In their praise of the responsible way in<br />
which the Aboriginal people conducted themselves and I think<br />
that that, right from the start of Bicentennial 1989 set a<br />
good tone. In other words, perfectly legitimate to expect<br />
the Aboriginal people to ask us to remember their position as<br />
we remember two hundred years of European settlezent. And so<br />
I think as the year went on it did have the result of making<br />
us all, Aborigines and non-Aboriginesi understand the<br />
importance of 1988, but understanding the importance of 1968<br />
in the stream of 40,000 years of history.<br />
Journalist: Mr Hawks, 2001 a Statehood Odyssey. Bob<br />
Collins is keen on it, what is your view?<br />
PM: Well, on the question of describing various ways, you<br />
know statehood or whatever you went to describe it. I have<br />
simply said there to your chief minister when he came to see<br />
me about it a few weeks ago that this is something really<br />
that we have got to see the people of the Northern Territory<br />
the people, not just the politicians, but the people<br />
indicating that this is really what they vent. And I doubt<br />
very much whether at this stage that is the case. I-haven'tgot'<br />
any evidence that overwhelmingly Northern Territorianswent<br />
to assume rather not merely rights that can be seen as<br />
involved in statehood, but obligations, And I must say quite<br />
honestly that if I was Territorian I don't know that I would<br />
be lumping up and down wanting statehood tomorrow. And 1<br />
don t see any evidence of that. But if that position<br />
develops and it can be demonstrated to us that that Is the<br />
wishes of the people of the Northern Territory then we would<br />
have to be beginning to look at it. You have to recognise ot<br />
course that with the relatively small population of the<br />
Northern Territory it would be very difficult to talk about<br />
the equivalents of statehood in terms of numbers of Senators<br />
In a Federal Parliament and so on. And lots of pratioal<br />
difficulties but as I say I don't discern any popular clamour<br />
for it. And if there is evidence brought before us that that<br />
is something they want us to look at well then let's deal<br />
with it at that point, I think that to some way down the<br />
track though. </p>
<p>Journalist: Has Mr Perron communicated evidence of this<br />
popular clamour?<br />
M Not I think in fairness to the Chief Xinister he wasn't<br />
asserting to an that that was the position.<br />
Journlist: How does Mr Collins assort the position, sorry<br />
Senator Collins assert the position to you?<br />
PM: I think similarly that lob wouldn't be saying that this<br />
is something that is on everyone's lips at the moment.<br />
Journalist: Senator Collins, is ho In line for a ministry?<br />
PM: Senator Collins would not be expecting that he would be<br />
a candidate to fill the Luedlate Vacancy but I have had the<br />
opportunity lust of'saying very recently that in terms of<br />
both Bob Coll1ins and Warren Snowdon you have people with<br />
outstanding capacity. They have made# I am not merely saying<br />
this because I know they would like to hear it# but it Is<br />
reinforced by the reaction I get when I come up here and see<br />
the way in which right across the political spectrum the two<br />
of then are so widely regarded and respected and and* an<br />
enormous contribution not merely in terms of representing the<br />
interest, of the Northern Territory, but when they speak in<br />
the Caucus or in the Parliament they are listened to, So the<br />
answer is that both Bob Collins anid Warren Snowdon at* of<br />
ministerial timber. Their time will oomt, it is not<br />
immediate, not in the terms ot this immediate vacancy, but<br />
their time will come.<br />
Journalist: Some recent events have indicated that the hard<br />
edge of politics has been bruising you somewhat. Do you long<br />
for a lees confrontational life?<br />
PM Wall I don't regard politics as terribly<br />
confrontational, I mean I think when the history books arol<br />
written I think they will say that Hawke made a significant<br />
contribution in trying to bring about consensus politics<br />
rather than confrontationist politics.. I certainly hope that<br />
is the case. I don't feel bruised at all by it, I " m<br />
enjoying politics now more than I ever have because, in part<br />
Meredith, after six years in office you have the great joy of<br />
seeing what were originally concepts and ideas coming to<br />
fruition. And that is enorsously stimulating and rewarding#<br />
so I don't feel bruised. The only thing that one gets as<br />
time goes on is the realisation that there really isn't any<br />
privacy, any private life, you miss that somewhat but the<br />
omlentationn are just so overwholmin! I so I an enjoying<br />
poltict Iamenjoying the Prime Minls ership more than I<br />
ever have.<br />
Journalist; Will you lead the Parliamentary Labor Party<br />
beyond the next election? </p>
<p>RESOFFICE CCR BNTB LTEL: 61-062-732923 31 0 , l . u<br />
1K: Oh yes will lead then in to the next electiono I think<br />
we wi141 win it and I will lead the Party through that next<br />
term and then we will just let's see how things turn out<br />
then. But I feel a vibrantly young end fit 59.<br />
Journallist Row would a person who has led an often<br />
controversial and flamboyant public life, plan to spend a<br />
retirement?<br />
P Well, perhaps less flamboyantly and less demandingly but<br />
I can't imagine any period in ar life in which I won't be<br />
active. There are a lot of things I want to do when that<br />
time comes including, may I say, it to not-one of sharing the<br />
lust of retired politicians to put pan to paper and write a<br />
book. Now that could come at some time but Z don't have any<br />
passion about that. I rather would like as I have said<br />
before to have the opportunity of doing a series of<br />
television interviews with people I have met around the world<br />
* and in Australia who I think have influenced the world in<br />
which they live. Influenced it for the better. I have had a<br />
very unique opportunity now amongst Australians of being<br />
exposed to these sort of people, I have been able to<br />
establish close rapport and understanding with many of then.<br />
I would love the opportunity of just sharing with millions of<br />
people not only in Australia but around the world the<br />
understandinq I have of these people and getting through the<br />
opportunities at such Interviews, the capacity for ordinary<br />
Australians and others to see the impact of individuals have<br />
been able to have in shaping a better world, I regard that<br />
as a very interesting project.<br />
Journalist: Prime minister Hawke, your Oovernment's and<br />
Australia's challenge for the<br />
IX: Challenge for the 90m is oontinuing what we've been<br />
doing and that is to try and make an Australia that is going<br />
to be beet placed to take advantage of the challenges and<br />
op : rtunities of the twenty first century. We're tryin to<br />
mate an Australia which is a more competitive, eff/ oent<br />
economy. That involves changes to education snd training, to<br />
industrial structures. We're very well placed,<br />
geographically and in terms of resources to make an enormous<br />
contribution to and benefit from the dynamic growth of the<br />
region of which we are part. But also to be an Australia<br />
which is sure of itself, an Australia oomposed of people who<br />
respect and love one another, because it is only on the basis<br />
of respeot and love for one another that we are going to be<br />
most efficient and most prosperous. I think we've gone a<br />
long way down the path of achieving those goals, so it's not<br />
a question, Meredith, of having new visions, setting new<br />
goals, those visions end goals have been fixed for me and<br />
before I became Prime Minister and throughout the Prime<br />
Xinisterghip, what we can say at.. for the 90* now is through<br />
the experience of these last six yearn, we know that those<br />
goals are achievable. I think we ve learnt better how to<br />
work towards them. I would love to see the 90s, this last </p>
<p>O<br />
decade of this vibrant and dramatic twentieth century<br />
conclude with us all knowing that we are better placed to<br />
take advantage of the enormous opportunities of being where<br />
we are in the world, as part of this regqion which Is growing<br />
so fast, which is increasingly respected for our traditionsof<br />
democracy, ot commitnent to the rights of individuals-and<br />
taking our place as a leading menber of that region. Those<br />
are the sorts of things that we have to do and, as I say, I<br />
think we're better placed to do it now than we were six years<br />
ago and basiceally that is because, aes Australians, we've<br />
learnt to know one another better. We do have greater<br />
confidence in one another, we are less of a confrontationist<br />
society than we were atthe beginning of the 40s. Those are<br />
the things we have to build on in the<br />
Journalist: Prime Minister, thank you very much.<br />
PX: It's been my pleasure Meredith, thank you very much.<br />
