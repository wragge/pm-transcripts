<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well thank you Andrew, Tim Horan, and the other person I think I should especially acknowledge particularly after their fantastic performance at Durban, John Eales. </p>
<p>It';s pretty easy to come to a rugby lunch like this.  It';s pretty easy to stand up after you';ve had a week, indeed four and a half years of arguing the toss about all sorts of controversial political issues to know that everybody in the room is going to agree with every single thing that you say.  It';s a rare experience, in fact it';s a first for me.  </p>
<p>But it is a great delight to just say a couple of words in praise of a remarkable decade or more of contribution to Australian rugby.  It actually coincides with, undeniably the greatest decade ever in the history of Australian rugby.  And you have been part of a wonderful tradition I think I can call it that has really helped to put Australian rugby right up there in the sporting achievements of our country.  </p>
<p>You were part of the 1991 team that won the World Cup.  Fittingly of course you were part of the 1999 team that magnificently won the World Cup in Wales at the end of last year.  And I think very fittingly you were named as the player of the World Cup.  On a scale of rugby achievement it really doesn';t get any better than that.  But in the middle of that decade you had a serious health challenge, you came back in fantastic style.</p>
<p>And you';ve been part of a group of men who';ve really done this country enormous credit.  You';ve not only been great sportsmen, great rugby players but you along with all your other team mates have been fantastic ambassadors for Australia.  </p>
<p>And at a time when the sporting focus of the world is on Australia, is on Sydney isn';t it terrific to take a moment off to savour the wonderful success of our rugby players and to pay tribute to Tim Horan who really has been an ornament to the game, has played it hard, has played it fair, has played it with great skill and great dedication and kept his reputation on and off the field.  </p>
<p>And I really have enjoyed my association with Tim as member of the Wallabies team.  I wish him and his family every health and happiness.  I thank you Tim for the way you';ve played the game, for the contribution that you';ve made to Australian rugby, for the enjoyment and pleasure with your try scoring skills and the zest and speed and the capacity with which you';ve played the game and helped give us this wonderful decade of Australian rugby. </p>
<p>Tim Horan thank you very much. </p>
<p>[ends] </p>
