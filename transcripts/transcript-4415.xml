FOR PRESS 6 JUNE 1977<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT MANSION HOUSE, LONDON, 2 JUNE 1977.<br />
I am most grateful for the invitation from Mr. Callaghan to visit<br />
the United Kingdom. This is my first official visit to Britain as<br />
Prime Minister, and I am enjoying my discussions both with Prime<br />
Minister Callaghan and his colleagues, and I am looking forward to<br />
participating in the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting<br />
next week.<br />
My visit is also timed to enable me to participate in the Silver<br />
Jubilee celebrations. As you know, for us, these began in March<br />
when Her Majesty and Prince Philip had a most successful visit to<br />
Australia. The visit reaffirmed once again the warm affection in<br />
which Australians hold Her Majesty and all the Royal Family. Do not<br />
pay too much heed to stories about republicanism in Australia. There<br />
is no doubt about our feeling of independence, but neither is there<br />
any doubt that most Australians still favour our current constitutional<br />
position.<br />
After the recent hectic years of Australian politics with seven<br />
Prime Ministers in the past decade you might well ask what of<br />
Australia today? And where is it heading as a nation? our major<br />
domestic objective has been to put the economy back on a sound basis.<br />
On the international scene, our objective has been to restore<br />
relations with close friends and allies.<br />
I would like to take a few moments of your time to talk about the<br />
economy, international trade, and relationships, and some of our<br />
perspectives on the world.<br />
First the economy. There has been of course a recession in all<br />
economies. In Australia, however, domestic factors played a larger<br />
part in the recession than they did in most other countries. These<br />
factors were: a rapid expansion in the size of the Government<br />
sector. In one year ( 1974/ 5) Government expenditure increased<br />
by 46%. monetary policies which fuelled inflation; utterly<br />
unrealistic wage and salary increases wages in manufacturing<br />
industry went up by 53% in two years; a more interventionist<br />
Government role, which restricted the ability and confidence of<br />
the private sector. Clearly, we needed a change of direction.<br />
In the view of my Government a lasting economic recovery will only<br />
occur if we can defeat inflation. / As your </p>
<p>-2-N.<br />
As your Prime Minister said at the Labour Party Conference last<br />
year, it is not possible to spend our way out of unemployment at<br />
a time when inflation is still high. It would lead to further<br />
inflation. We have directed the arms of economic policy towards<br />
defeating inflation. We have restrained Government expenditurecutting<br />
Government spending by $ 3 billion in our first nine months<br />
in office. We have established a responsible monetary policy one<br />
which treads the narrow path of providing adequate funds for real<br />
growth without adding to inflation.<br />
We seek to improve the private sector's profits so that investment<br />
can be encouraged and incentives have been introduced to achieve this.<br />
We have used all the avenues open to us to restrain wage increases and<br />
we have adopted other policies making it reasonable for wage earners<br />
to accept restraint. We have restored the competitiveness of Australia<br />
industry by devaluing the exchange rate. We had maintained an overvalued<br />
exchange rate until all the instruments of policy were<br />
effectively focussed on fighting inflation. And we have strengthened<br />
our anti-inflationary policies since devaluation.<br />
There has been a change of direction, substantial progress has been<br />
made. During 1976, inflation was reduced from an annual rate of<br />
16% down to around 10%. Real gross domestic product resumed moderate<br />
expansion, compared with an actual decline in 1975. The growth in the<br />
money supply remains on target for this financial year at about 10-12%.<br />
The effects of devaluation on the internal price structure have been<br />
small and the underlying rate of inflation has continued to fall.<br />
Company profits, particularly those in the export industries, have<br />
continued their striking recovery from an appallingly low base, and<br />
private investment is growing again in real terms.<br />
Recovery is necessarily a gradual process but that is accepted. You<br />
will be aware of the importance of mineral development to Australia,<br />
and also its importance to other economies which we supply.<br />
The value of mineral production over the decade increased sixfold to<br />
over $ 3 billion, of which by far the greatest part was for export.<br />
Exports of iron-ore, alumina, mineral sands, lead, bauxite, zinc,<br />
coal and nickel are all very substantial. Collectively over the last<br />
ten years they rose from 11% to 29% of total export earnings. As<br />
part of this development, 22 new towns and 11 new ports have been<br />
built. Total capital expenditure on mining, processing, smelting<br />
and refining through the decade compri-sed a quarter of all new capital<br />
expenditure. This development peaked around 1971/ 2. Although the<br />
value of exports continued to surge ahead strongly after that period,<br />
both capital investment and exploration fell away, discouraged by<br />
Government policies and world recession.<br />
However, now I am confident that another decade of major mineral<br />
development is unfolding. This calendar year I expect investment<br />
in the mineral industry to be about 40% up on last year with the<br />
momentum building up as the year progresses. Exploration drilling<br />
for oil and gas will be approximately double last year's. / Base metal </p>

a more constructive role in world affairs. The policy objectives<br />
of the Treaty of Rome were born from the highest motives and worthiest*<br />
aspirations. The community has in fact made considerable progress.<br />
But there are many people who believe that those original objectives<br />
and aspirations have not yet been achieved.<br />
It is easy to understand that in the early days of the Community<br />
there was a preoccupation with internal matters. Nor was it surprising<br />
that, at the outset, the Community should concentrate its efforts in<br />
reducing barriers to trade within its own boundaries. However, internationally<br />
the Communities have now acquired a distinct personality<br />
which is being expressed with greater and greater coherence. In<br />
international forums the nine member states have developed, and<br />
continue to develop, common proposals, common positions, and have<br />
common purposes. It is therefore a matter of regret that in some<br />
aspects of Australia's relations with the European community we still<br />
have significant problems which seem to us to run counter to an outwardlooking<br />
approach and which, if I may venture to say so, seem to us to<br />
run counter to the longer-run interests of the Community itself.<br />
This brings me to a subject on which there is a particularly strong<br />
need for us to understand fully each other's perspectives. I speak<br />
of our trade relations and the question of access to each other's<br />
markets. First, let me deal with manufactured goods. The European<br />
Commission has pressed Australia to reduce our tariffs on manufactured<br />
goods. This pressure is understandable. With large markets at close<br />
proximity and advanced scientific and technological resources, members<br />
of the European Community have been able to develop a capacity for large<br />
scale competitive exports of manufactured goods. Australia's<br />
manufacturing sector is in a different position. The bulk of our<br />
present industry was developed during and after the last war. Our<br />
dependence on others for manufactured goods had become most evident<br />
during the war, and we consciously set out to expand our manufacturing<br />
sector in order to secure a greater measure of economic independence<br />
and a more self-sufficient community.<br />
The relatively small size of our market however has made some significandegree<br />
of protection imperative. Yet Australian -tariffs have been<br />
reduced overall. Since 1973 our tariffs have been reduced by about<br />
Furthermore, Australian tariffs have not prevented E. E. C.<br />
manufactured goods from gaining access to our domestic market. Even<br />
though those imports adversely affect our local industry, between<br />
1972/ 3, the year before the onset of the recent recession, and 1974/ 5,<br />
at the height of the recession, the share of the Australian domestic<br />
market in manufactured goods accounted for by imports from all sources<br />
increased by nearly 40%. The E. E. C. is today the largest single source<br />
of imports to Australia, supplying more than one quarter of total<br />
imports. Turning now to agricultural products, the situation is quite different.<br />
In Australia's case, we excel not only as an exporter of mineral ores<br />
and metals but of agricultural products. We are able to produce at a<br />
lower cost than yourselves, beef, butter, wheat, flour, dairy products,<br />
sugar. In short, almost every product you eat. Europe however has the<br />
same problem in agricultural production that we face with manufactured<br />
goods. Europe has a traditionally high cost agriculture which cannot<br />
/ survive </p>
<p>-3<br />
Base metal exploration is under way once more, and there have been<br />
encouraging discoveries in Western Australia and South Australia.<br />
There are no less than 19 mining or mineral processing projects under<br />
construction, or which should commence this year, with a total estimated<br />
capital cost of about $ 2 billion. There are, in addition, some<br />
projects in Australia which are under consideration with a combined<br />
capital cost running into very large sums. indeed.<br />
This immediately raises the question of the availability of capital.<br />
I have no doubt that as the investment projects are developed, overseas<br />
capital will be required to supplement that which is available in<br />
Australia. It is for this purpose that when, for domestic monetary<br />
policy reasons, we introduced controls on overseas borrowings early<br />
this year, we specifically exempted overseas borrowings for capital<br />
development in mining and manufacturing industries. Moreover, the<br />
Government has adopted a policy on foreign investment designed to<br />
ensure that worthwhile projects go ahead and are not held up by<br />
shortages of domestic capital. These policies are working well, but<br />
if there are any difficulties, I would like to hear about them.<br />
one mineral of particular importance is uranium. Australia holds about<br />
of the western world's low cost uncommitted reserves. The Governmeni<br />
believes that the export of uranium involves important considerations of<br />
a kind not involvedin the export of othor commodities, and last week we<br />
announced a comprehensive safeguards policy for uranium exports. Its<br />
essential elements are: careful selection of customer countries, and<br />
a two-tier system--of ensuring that customer countries adopt proper<br />
safeguards. This involves applying firstly the international Atomic Energy Agency's<br />
safeguards to verify that material supplied for peaceful purposes is<br />
not misused, and secondly, establishing additional safeguards through<br />
a bilateral agreement with each customer country. Australia will also<br />
be actively involved in international effort to upgrade safeguards.<br />
We will shortly be in a position to discuss with potential customers<br />
the details of our safeguard policy. Final decisions will be made<br />
concerning the first and second reports of the special uranium<br />
environmental enquiry soon after my return to Australia.<br />
I now turn to the question of relations between Australia and Western<br />
Europe. Relations between Australia and Britain have of course always<br />
been strong. our special relationship is founded on common history,<br />
on shared political and philosophical ideals, and on the contribution<br />
that British migration and investment have made to Australia's<br />
development. These ties remain strong; despite the changes inevitably<br />
brought by Britain's entry into the E. E. C. When Britain first contemplated<br />
joining the E. E. C. there was some criticism and a general sense of<br />
unease in Australia. In a debate in our Parliament in 1961, afterI<br />
Mr. McMillan had announced that Britain would negotiate for admission<br />
to the E. E. C. I recall being one of the very few Members of Parliament<br />
who took a view contrary to that expressed by the Government of the day.<br />
I supported wholeheartedly Britain's entry into the Common Market. My<br />
only regret was that Britain had not entered into such an arrangement<br />
with the original six members at a much earlier date. The signing of<br />
the Treaty of Rome was accompanied by high hopes on the part of all<br />
those interested in European and world affairs. The Treaty seemed to<br />
offer Europe the prospect for the first time in centuries of unity and<br />
cohesion; an end to internecine conflict which more than once<br />
embroiled virtually the entire world; and the opportunity to fulfil<br />
/ a more </p>
<p>6<br />
It would seem to me that you can answer these questions in the<br />
affirmative while still preserving the basic thrust of the Common<br />
Agricultural Policy. It is clear that we look at these matters from<br />
different perspectives. We need to understand each other's point of<br />
view. I have spoken about our trade relations because of their<br />
importance to both of us, but there is a whole range of other issues,<br />
political and international, which are also of mutual concern.<br />
We hope to see the European communities increasingly develop the role<br />
which they are already playing internationally as a force for<br />
stability. We have many shared interests which a developing international<br />
role by the Communities can do much to enhance. Quite apart<br />
from our agricultural products, our capacity to act as a long term<br />
and stable supplier of raw material and energy resources clearly<br />
provides a basis for such a closer relationship. Moreover, despite<br />
our distance from Europe we are most conscious of the strategic<br />
importance of Europe and the contribution which a strong European<br />
Community makes to the North Atlantic Community and the present<br />
global balance.<br />
While we are all deeply involved in the regions nearest to us, we<br />
sometimes overlook the identity of interest between democratic<br />
communities. This is more than a regional matter. Despite the<br />
doomsayers, those who speak of inflation and unemployment, of the<br />
crisis of democracy, our societies have great internal strength and<br />
resilience. However, because we are dispersed in large and small<br />
groups around the world, the interdependence of the democracies is<br />
seldom well understood. The common interests between us are rarely<br />
sufficiently emphasised. Our strength does not lie exclusively in<br />
the Europe or Japan or in any other single region in the world.<br />
Our future is in a fundamental sense a collective one. We should not<br />
allow ourselves to be isolated from one another commercially or<br />
strategically. We need a global outlook and this is no less true<br />
of Europe than it is of the South Pacific countries. Our societies<br />
are pre-eminently ones which thrive on their interconnections with one<br />
another and the rest of the world. They would wither without them.<br />
You in Britain have much to contribute to fostering this recognition,<br />
to help avoid narrow exclusiveness which corrodes a common purpose.<br />
My Lord Mayor, thank you for your invitation to speak to this<br />
distinguished gathering today. I am looking forward greatly to<br />
the discussions which I will be having over the next few weeks in<br />
London, Brussels, Paris and Bonn. Australia strongly desires a<br />
closer and broader relationship with all members of the European<br />
communities, complementing the strong relationship which we already<br />
enjoy with Britain. I am most hopeful that these discussions will<br />
be a start in securing that closer relationship which we seek. </p>
<p>survive open competition with producers such as Australia. The<br />
European Community response, in contrast with ours in respect of<br />
manufactured products, has been the Common Agricultural Policy under<br />
which variable import levies are set at levels which severely restrict<br />
or exclude utterly imports of important Australian agricultural products<br />
So now we see two sides of the same coin. Each of us has our strengths,<br />
each our weaknesses. In these circumstances there is a natural<br />
tendency for each to wish to liberalise trade in the area in which<br />
it is stronger, and s~ tore up protective measures in the sector in<br />
which it is weak. But the responses to this problem from the E. E. C.<br />
and from Australia have not been the same. Despite our tariff barriers,<br />
Europe does have reasonable access to our markets, but we cannot get<br />
reasonable access to European markets for important agricultural products.<br />
Twenty years ago, exports to the nine member states of the<br />
E. E. C. were virtually at the same level as our imports.<br />
Today, largely due to the Community's Agricultural Policy, there is a<br />
serious imbalance of trading opportunities between Australia and the<br />
E. E. C. Last year, the value of imports from the E. E. C. exceeded that<br />
of our exports to the E. E. C. by nearly 60%. Reduced opportunities for<br />
Australian agricultural exports to the E. E. C. have had a direct effect<br />
on Australian primary producers. For example, in the last six years,<br />
one dairy farmer in three has left the Australian dairy industry.<br />
In other areas of export opportunity, such as processed mineral<br />
products,. Australia is often faced with escalating levels of tariff<br />
in the E. E. C. as the degree of processing increases. For example, the<br />
duty of bauxite is nil, alumina attracts a 5.5% duty, and aluminium<br />
ingots attract up to 22%. This policy directly inhibits the development<br />
of processing operations in our country, but the imbalance in our<br />
responses to the problem of market access is even greater, for, under<br />
the Common Agricultural Policy, the Community does not erely prevent<br />
reasonable access for our goods to your domestic markets; it heavily<br />
subsidises the export of primary products to other markets.<br />
In some cases, the subsidy is greater than the final price of the<br />
products. The subsidies have the effect of depressing world prices<br />
and disrupting our traditional markets outside Europe. Let me give<br />
you just one example of what has happened. Our largest traditional<br />
market for flour was Sri Lanka. Our share of that market used to be<br />
87%. It is now less than a quarter of that because E. E. C. subsidies<br />
have enabled European exporters in recent months to undercut our produci<br />
by up to $ 36 per tonne. The E. E. C. subsidy is in the order of<br />
$ 100 per tonne. A similar story could be told for numerous other<br />
products in other markets.<br />
All of this raises some questions. Would it not be possible to find<br />
a level of beef support and beef levy that allowed trade to flow<br />
without damaging the European beef producer? Would it not be possible<br />
to find a level of support for wheat and-grains and other foodstuffs<br />
that also allows trade to flow and that allows the consumer the benefit<br />
of cheaper food? Would not this also help you in the fight against<br />
inflation? Would it not be possible to fix levels of export restitutions,<br />
subsidies, that do not wreck other people's markets, that do not<br />
depress world prices? These are questions I asked myself. / It would </p>
