Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Attorney-General Robert McClelland today announced additional disaster assistance for communities in Northern NSW experiencing flooding as a result of floodwaters from Queensland entering the state. </p>
<p>The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP) will be made available to people who have been impacted by flooding in disaster declared Local Government Areas in the Northern Region of NSW and the Clarence Valley LGA.</p>
<p>The AGDRP is a one-off payment of $1,000 per eligible adult and $400 per eligible child to help them recover. </p>
<p>This assistance is being extended to parts of Northern NSW as we experience unprecedented flooding in large parts of Australia.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made the announcement while visiting Grafton this morning.</p>
<p>This payment will provide financial assistance to eligible people including those whose residence has been significantly damaged, who were stranded within their home or unable to gain access to their residence for at least 24 hours, or whose principal place of residence was without electricity, water, gas, sewerage or another essential service for at least 48 hours.</p>
<p>The assistance will be delivered by Centrelink.</p>
<p>Communities in Northern New South Wales are feeling the flow-on effects of severe flooding in South-East Queensland.</p>
<p>The flooding in these communities has caused considerable disruption, including the evacuation of thousands of people from their homes.</p>
<p>Many of these people have had to spend considerable time away from their residences.</p>
<p>This payment will go some way to helping people get back on their feet.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government continues to closely monitor the flood situation throughout other areas of New South Wales, as well as developments unfolding in Victoria and Tasmania.</p>
<p>The Government is providing significant assistance to flood-affected areas of Australia and will respond with further assistance as required.</p>
<p>Today's announcement is over and above the support already being provided by the Australian Government in areas affected by flooding throughout NSW.  This includes the Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy  -  a payment for employees, small business owners and farmers whose ability to work has been affected by the flooding.</p>
<p>Other joint Commonwealth/NSW Government assistance is also being provided under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA), including grants of up to $15,000 for small businesses and primary producers affected by flooding.</p>
<p>Information about the AGDRP or Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy can be obtained by phoning the Australian Government's Emergency Assistance Line on 180 2266 between 8am to 8pm local time, seven days a week.  People can also visit their local Centrelink office or log onto <a href="http://www.centrelink.gov.au">www.centrelink.gov.au</a>.  </p>
