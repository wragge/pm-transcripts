    <content><![CDATA[<p>This week the Turnbull Government will introduce vital legislation banning secret payments between unions and employers.</p>
<p>The new laws will criminalise payments or other benefits passed between employers and unions that could have a corrupting influence.</p>
<p>Any union leader who is willing to accept benefits from an employer is placing themselves in a highly compromising position.</p>
<p>The Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption found that such payments corrupt union officials and should be banned.</p>
<p>Penalties will apply equally to employers and unions. The person offering or making the benefit will be subject to the same penalties as the person soliciting or receiving it.</p>
<p>Those who make, receive, solicit or offer payments or benefits intended to corrupt a union official will face a maximum 10 years in prison, up to a $900,000 fine for an individual or $4.5 million fine for a company.</p>
<p>Penalties for payments or benefits other than specified legitimate payments (such as genuine membership fees) will be 2 years in prison, up to a $90,000 for an individual or $450,000 for a company.</p>
<p>The Bill will also require that any legitimate financial benefits obtained by an employer or union during enterprise agreement negotiations be disclosed to employees.</p>
<p>If money changes hands between an employer and a union, both parties have an obligation to honestly disclose these payments to their employees and members.</p>
<p>These vital changes will deliver on three key recommendations of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption.</p>
<p>The Turnbull Government is acting to ensure that employers and unions act in the best interests of their employees and members.</p>
<p>Bill Shorten and the Labor Party should now support this reform, to clean up the unfair, secretive, and often corrupt payments that have tainted Australian workplaces for decades.</p>
