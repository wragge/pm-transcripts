CIVIC RECEPTION ON ThE OCCASION OF THE<br />
LINKING OF THE EAST-WEST STANDARD GAUGE<br />
Broken Hill, N. S. W. 29 NOVEMIBER 1969<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Premiers, Distinguished Colleagues, both Federal and State and Gentlemen:<br />
For some reason or other during the past three-quarters ox<br />
an hour or so, I recalled two sayings which I think, perhaps, might be<br />
known to you. One is something to do with an orphan called Oliver Twist<br />
whom you may remember had a particular request to make after a heavy<br />
meal. And the other I hope nobody, including me, will take this<br />
personally the other was that description of Australia as a land where<br />
there were fewer people to the square mile and more speeches to the<br />
square meal than in any other civilised country! At any rate, this addition,<br />
I promise you, is not going to be for long.<br />
I suppose there is no city in Australia whose name is as<br />
well known internationally as is the name of this city of Broken Hill. I<br />
don't know whether it is the city itself which has become a household word<br />
in the markets of the world where people in some esoteric fashion deal in<br />
stocks and shares and futures and all these other things, or whether it is,<br />
because of the giant Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. which started here.<br />
But in any case it is a name known throughout the world.<br />
I don't suppose, either, that any of us here have lived long<br />
enough to know what this area was like before this city was built. I<br />
understand, from what I have read, that it was a bleak featureless<br />
landscape, except of course for " The Barrier" and " The Hill", populated<br />
by almost nobody, an area to which one could come only by stage-coach<br />
or in the course of boundary-riding. And there is a story told and I<br />
think a true one of a visiting preacher coming to this area and running<br />
across a young man digging a fence post hole, and stopping to talk to him.<br />
The young man, not having any other human company for so long, bubbled<br />
over with conversation and couldn't be stopped talking, because he was so<br />
happy to see a fellow human being. Finally the preacher stopped him and<br />
said: " Listen my son, have you been to Communion?" and he said: " Well,<br />
I don't think I have, but I was at Menindee last week! Another instance,<br />
I think, of the isolation of this area! / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
But look at what it has turned into. And can't we take it,<br />
perhaps, as a symbol of what Australia has done in wresting a living from<br />
a harsh and arid land under bad conditions, without the help of the smiling<br />
landscapes or the heavy rainfalls of Europe or countries where the land is<br />
not so forbidding. We have come into this interior our fathers and our<br />
grandfathers and have turned it into what it is, and what we have turned<br />
it into is merely a challenge to what we must turn it into in the next<br />
generation. And here again today in Broken Hill was a new step forward<br />
in Australia's history. We have spanned the continent before the hard way by<br />
land, the overlanders further north, driving their cattle across; we have<br />
spanned it the easy way in recent years by air. We can now span it,<br />
without being impeded, by rail one more step in the continuing progress<br />
of this country. It was a great honour for me to drive ( in a way which I<br />
wouldn't consider to be extremely expert) that spike into the railway today,<br />
but I would like, in reply to what Mr. Fitzpatrick has said, to say that if<br />
I am going to be charged any dues by the Union for this, then I want to have<br />
a union ticket and I would be perfectly happy to pay the dues, or one-365th<br />
of them, if I could get a unicn ticket:' You see, I ran into this once before.<br />
I came from country much like this rainfall of eleven inches if we were<br />
lucky and the country looked much the same. We were growing oranges<br />
and we had a packing shed and I used to work eight or nine hours a day in<br />
the packing shed and so did my wife and so did three other people. We<br />
were approached at one time by the Storemen and Packers Union who said<br />
we should all take out union tickets. I was delighted because I would have<br />
made more money paying myself than I was able to make out of growing<br />
and selling oranges. But unfortunately they wouldn't let me join. They<br />
said: " No, you are the boss. You can't have a union ticket. I hope this<br />
won't apply on this occasion, but if there is any suggestion of dues, at<br />
least I'll get the ticket:<br />
I said this wasn't going to be long, and it isn't. It has been<br />
a pleasure to have been with you. It has been an honour to have been<br />
associated with the greatness of accomplishment of all those who over the<br />
years have planned and constructed this great work. Before I sit down, as<br />
I said at the station, Wentworth is a name that must be associated with this<br />
work. I echo the Town Clerk in again saying this. But it wasn't only<br />
because of all the work over all the years that he put into it that I asked<br />
him here today. It was because I was quite sure if I didn't, we would have<br />
his wife parading up and down in front of us with a huge placard saying,<br />
" Where's Wentworth?" as she did when the Melbourne / Sydney line was<br />
opened! So for both those reasons, Bill, we are happy to have you with<br />
us, and I congratulate all concerned on this work. </p>
