    <content><![CDATA[<p>A year ago today, the Australian Parliament formally apologised to members of the Stolen Generations for the policies of past governments.</p>
<p>The Apology was a starting point for reconciliation, and the beginning of building a bridge of respect between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>The hardest work is ahead of us.</p>
<p>Our challenge, as the Government outlined one year ago, is to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians  -  so that Indigenous Australians can share fully in the life of our nation.</p>
<p>This will not be easy, and it will require our entire nation to work together  -  Indigenous communities, Commonwealth and State governments, business, community organisations and people all across our nation.</p>
<p>But there has never been a more united sense of purpose across our community, to make a real difference in the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</p>
<p>And there has never been such agreement as there now is between all levels of government to work together and make a difference.</p>
<p>Later this month, when Parliament next sits, I will deliver a report card on progress in the first 12 months since the apology.</p>
<p>This is the next step towards one of the greatest and most important challenges facing our nation.</p>
