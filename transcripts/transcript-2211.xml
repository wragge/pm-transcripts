MR. HOLYOAKE'S VISIT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Prime Minister of New Zealand will pay an official<br />
visit to Australia from 4 to 11 June. The Prime Minister, Mr. Gorton,<br />
said today that he was delighted that Mr. Holyoake had been able to<br />
accept the invitation, extended to him in March 1968 during Mr. Gorton's<br />
visit to New Zealand. Mr. Gorton said that, although Mr. Holyoake had visited<br />
Australia on a number of occasions for meetings of regional groups, this<br />
would be Mr. Holyoake's first official visit to Australia. Mr. Holyoake<br />
hoped to have the opportunity of seeing something of Australia's industrial<br />
development and of meeting Australians from different walks of life.<br />
Mr. Gorton said that he was looking forward to discussions<br />
with Mr. Holyoake on many matters of mutual interest and that the visit<br />
would further strengthen the already close ties between Australia and<br />
New Zealand.<br />
