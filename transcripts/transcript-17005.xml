    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australian businesses have responded enthusiastically to the Federal Government's $100 million Apprentice Kickstart initiative, signing up more than 6,400 young traditional trades apprentices in just over six weeks.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Minister for Employment Participation Mark Arbib today urged businesses to continue to take advantage of the boost to employer incentives.</p>
<p>The Kickstart bonus has resulted in 4,400 trade apprentices being signed up in December 2009 - 1,500 more than December 2008 and 1,200 more than pre-global recession levels in December 2007.</p>
<p>Apprentice Kickstart is a practical measure to generate jobs for young people, tackling both youth unemployment and providing a down-payment on the vital skills Australia needs for the future.</p>
<p>In Western Australia alone employers have signed up 840 trades apprentices since Kickstart began on December 1, 2009.</p>
<p>Under Kickstart, the Rudd Government has more than tripled the commencement bonus for employers in the first year, from $1500 to $4850.</p>
<p>Employers receive $2350 when they employ a 15- to 19-year-old apprentice in an eligible trade and then receive a further $2500 after the apprentice completes nine months.</p>
<p>The Australian Government today also invites state and territory governments to submit proposals for a share of a $20 million funding to boost pre-apprenticeships.</p>
<p>Pre-apprenticeship training allows young people to gain a more realistic expectation of the work involved in their trade and to develop basic skills, which can reduce the period of time they will spend in their apprenticeship.</p>
<p>The Kickstart bonus is available to employers of apprentices in the fields that have been hardest hit by skills shortages - identified on the National Skills Needs List.</p>
<p>These include butchers, bakers, bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers, electrical trades and hairdressing.</p>
<p>The bonus is available until 28 February 2010 and aims to sign up 21,000 young apprentices.</p>
<p>The economic downturn particularly hurt apprenticeships, with commencements dropping by about 10,000 in the past year. This bonus will fast-forward hiring decisions - to bring apprentice numbers back up to the levels before the global recession.</p>
<p>Increased apprenticeship training is crucial to enhancing the productivity and innovation of Australian businesses.</p>
<p>This initiative will help develop a highly-skilled workforce and is a great foundation to support the recovery of the Australian economy.</p>
<p>Today's announcement was made at Westminster School in Perth. The school community is receiving $5 million under the Federal Government's education stimulus, including a library, classrooms, an art block and multipurpose room.</p>
<p>Casotti Plumbing and Gasfitting, which is contracted to complete some of the work at Westminster, has employed two new apprentices under the Kickstart Program.</p>
<p>The Government's Economic Stimulus plan has a target of 10 per cent of work on projects to be completed by apprentices.</p>
<p>The stimulus spending is supporting thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country and providing the vital infrastructure for Australia's future.</p>
<p>Our timely, targeted and temporary response to the global recession helped minimise the loss of skills that occurs with unemployment as well as boosting apprentice commencements.</p>
<p>Apprentice sign-ups by State (December 1 to January 14):</p>
<p>ACT 85</p>
<p>NSW 1932</p>
<p>NT 27</p>
<p>Qld 1114</p>
<p>SA 523</p>
<p>Tas 213</p>
<p>Vic 1687</p>
<p>WA 840</p>
<p>Total 6421</p>
<p>Funding for Apprentice Kickstart comes from the Government's $650 million Jobs Fund and was negotiated with the support of the Australian Greens and Senator Stephen Fielding.</p>
<p>It brings to about $250 million the level of additional support the Rudd Government is providing to apprentices.</p>
