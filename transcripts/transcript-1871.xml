VISIT TO SOUTH EAST ASIA 1968<br />
Li B SAIGON<br />
WELCOME BY VIETNAMESE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
TRAN VAN HUONG, AT AIRPORT 7 JUNE 1968<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, it is a very great pleasure and a very<br />
great honour for the Vietnamese people, for the Government of the Republic<br />
of Vietnam, and for myself to welcome on our soil today the representative<br />
of a people to whom we are bound by so many ties.<br />
Since Vietnam regained its independence and liberty, it has<br />
had to defend that independence and that liberty against an enemy who is<br />
set on destroying them in order to impose on the Vietnamese people a<br />
system of government ard a way of life that they rejected as -not corresponding<br />
with their interests or their best traditions, In this struggle, the Vietnamese<br />
people have benefited from the sympathy and support without reservation<br />
from the Australian Government and people in all fields political, military,<br />
economic and humanitarian. We are therefore happy to have the opportunity<br />
to express through you our gratitude to the Government and people of Australia.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, you arrive in Vietnam at a time when<br />
our common enemy, international communism, is intensifying its efforts<br />
with a view to obtaining a seeming military success in order to support<br />
his political demands in Paris as elsewhere.<br />
We have decided not to fall into the communist trap. We love<br />
and hope for peace, but we will not accept a peace dictated by an enemy who<br />
himself knows that hie cannot gain victory. We are convinced that the<br />
Australian Government and people will continue to work closely with the<br />
Vietnamese Government and people, as with the other nations which are<br />
friends and allies of Vietnam, in order to prevent communism spreading<br />
south of the 17th parallel.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, in the name of the Vietnamese people<br />
and Government, I bid you welcome and a pleasant and fruitful time in<br />
Vietnam. </p>
