TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
23 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: This is my third visit as Prime Minister to Japan, but it will be my first<br />
official visit and, in fact, the first official visit of any Australian Prime<br />
Minister for nearly a decade. So I think it has a symbolic as well as a<br />
working dimension to it.<br />
You know this relationship with Japan has been vital to Australia and<br />
remains vital to us, which is a view which I have taken strongly now<br />
over 20 odd years in my own relationship with Japan and its<br />
companies and its governments. It is the second largest economy in<br />
the world. It is our largest trading partner and it is the engine of<br />
economic growth in East Asia.<br />
Japan actually represents 70 per cent of the entire East Asian<br />
economy. So the size of it should never be underestimated. What<br />
happens in Tokyo, in fact, shapes what happens economically in the<br />
region and will matter, always, to Australia and to our own lives and<br />
the sort of lives our children will have as well.<br />
More than ever, and more than any other country in the region, Japan<br />
will be critical I think to our economic growth and our ability to create<br />
high quality, interesting jobs for ourselves and our children.<br />
Now, obviously, this visit is coming just about very close to the last<br />
days of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, which gives some<br />
other dimension to the visit. The only thing I will say to you about that<br />
is I think we should never forget the suffering and cruelty of that war.<br />
But I think we need to remember, also, what has happened in the<br />
years since and despite very different cultures and the legacy of the<br />
war, we have, in the unlikely event, built a remarkable relationship with<br />
Japan one of inestimable value to Australians and one which has, in </p>
<p>T2EL3: Ma. 9 40 No. 00? P. 02/ I'u<br />
2<br />
very large part, also not only underpinned their post-war economic<br />
growth, but underpinned Australia's as well.<br />
So the relationship has grown from enmity through development of<br />
trading rinks. It is now a very broad political and economic relationship<br />
with growing, people -to-people, ties. Last year we had 720,000<br />
tourists coming here from Japan and we have now exchanged 10,000<br />
school exchange visits. So there are a lot of Australians who live with<br />
Japanese families and the converse being the case here.<br />
So I want to use the visit to reflect on that relationship in all of its<br />
dimensions and look to the future where we are going in the region.<br />
I will be having talks, obviously, with the Prime Minister. Mrs Keating<br />
and I will be very honoured to be received by the Emperor and the<br />
Empress for an official lunch. But with the Government I will be<br />
meeting, not only with the Prime Minister, but with the MITI Minister,<br />
Minister Hashimoto who, of course, I knew well in my Treasury years<br />
when he was Finance Minster Foreign Minister Kono and other key<br />
Japanese political, business and financial leaders.<br />
I will also be visiting the Hodogaya War Cemetery where I will lay a<br />
wreath to the 278 Australians who are buried there and the others who<br />
died in the war.<br />
In my discussions with Japanese leaders about our bilateral<br />
relationship, I will be focussing on the things of economic and political<br />
relevance in that and, also, the economic and political relevance in the<br />
changing global environment. We will discuss regional, political and<br />
economic developments, especially APEC. And you know that Japan<br />
is hosting the third APEC Leaders meeting in Osaka in November of<br />
this year and I will be urging Prime Minister Murayama and his<br />
colleagues to work towards an ambitious and solid set of outcomes in<br />
Osaka to carry forward, in a practical way, that historic declaration<br />
which was agreed to at Bogor, in Indonesia, late last year.<br />
So, in all, I see it as a chance to, again, get to understand Japan's<br />
current thinking better, to advance our bilateral relationship and to<br />
discuss these multilateral matters between us, particularly in this fast<br />
growing area of the World, but multilateral both in the strategic and in<br />
the economic sense and, of course, with APEC.<br />
So I might leave it there and take questions.<br />
J: Prime Minister what is the message that you will be giving the<br />
Japanese about the trade dispute with America and will Australia be<br />
taking sides on that?<br />
PM: Well I think the side we'll be taking is Australia's side. rhat is, we want<br />
Japan to continue to open Its markets. I think the Americans think that<br />
TEL </p>

too. You know that Japan and the United States are both countries<br />
with very low tariffs. We are not talking here about tariff barriers, we<br />
are talking about informal barriers and they are of as much interest to<br />
us as they are to the United States and many other countries. But I<br />
think we would like these disputes settled multilaterally, not unilaterally<br />
or bilaterally, particularly in deals which may harm third countries, in<br />
which case in motor vehicles and motor parts, ourselves So, yes, we<br />
understand the interest of the United States in trying to eat away at<br />
that trade surplus by getting better market access. But one of the<br />
stories about, particularly the United States which is the largest trading<br />
entity in the world, wherever US investment goes, trade follows. In<br />
Europe where there Is very strong US investment, the United States<br />
doesn't have trading problems. It has it in Japan where its investment<br />
is nothing like as strong as it is in other parts of the world and that gets<br />
you back, again, to multilateral solutions like APEC. Trade facilitation,<br />
opening investment policies, seeing a real and growing presence of<br />
American investment in the Japanese economy and its manufacturing<br />
and service sectors is the way, basically, to deal with these problems.<br />
So, again, all pointers point to multilateral solutions and not bilateral<br />
ones.<br />
J: Will you be giving the Japanese Government an assessment of what<br />
affect on Australia either them acceding to some sort of bilateral<br />
arrangement with the US would have, or the US sanctions being<br />
imposed how either of those scenarios would affect us?<br />
PM: Well you might remember when I went there a few years ago, I said<br />
Australia wouldn't be part of any trade agreement which would<br />
disadvantage Japan and we will be reminding them of that and saying<br />
we would appreciate the reciprocity, well if you like reciprocal,<br />
sentiments. That is, they too take the view that in any settlement of<br />
these disputes they don't impact on third countries like ourselves,<br />
particularly countries which have a long and enduring trade and<br />
commercial relationship with them and who have an important political<br />
relationship with Japan. I mean I don't think anyone should<br />
underestimate the strength of the political relationship Au~ t'a1ia enjoys<br />
with Japan, or how useful it has been to both of us in : he recent past.<br />
So all of these things, I am sure, will weigh on their minds.<br />
J: If there are to be real solutions, though, the structural solutions are<br />
going to take a long time and yet you have got, obviously, a lot of<br />
impatience building up in Washington. Isn't there a collision of two<br />
different timeframes?<br />
P Well the problem underneath all of this is the savings balances. Japan<br />
is a very strong saving country and the United States isn't and if you<br />
look at Japan it has got a very big investment in their capital stock, in<br />
motor vehicles, in quality, in price and that while there has been quite,<br />
you know, substantial changes, really substantial changes in the US<br />
TEL </p>
<p>T2EL3:. May. 95 3: 40 NO. 007 P. 04/ 10<br />

motor industry, by and large if you look at the US/ Japan relationship in<br />
its totality, you are fighting all the time against the tide of those savings<br />
imbalances. One of the ways that will change, of course, is opening<br />
up more access in Japan and Japan spending more on domestic<br />
demand, improving their infrastructure, their housing, these sorts of<br />
things. That would tend to run down their savings and run some of<br />
those surpluses away. But the other way where this is going to be<br />
worked out is in the trade and investment opportunities in East Asia for<br />
the United States and Japan and you can see just in the last six or<br />
seven years how much there has been a weighing off by the Japanese<br />
of their dependency on the US market as they have grown market<br />
share in East Asia. All the more reason why APEC becomes important<br />
and the Uruguay Round. That is, opening up opportunities in these<br />
markets for the United States to invest and for Japan to invest into<br />
trade and the same for Japan. Now you know that the United States<br />
has a very large trade deficit with Japan. But it is not as large per<br />
capita as the trade deficit we have with the United States. I mean we<br />
have a much larger deficit with the United States, than the United<br />
States has with Japan on a per capita basis. But we have a very large<br />
surplus with the Japanese. So if the United States ends up with a very<br />
large deficit with Japan but other surpluses around the area, it matters<br />
much less then in the American current account than it would matter<br />
today or mattered a few years ago. So that is why given the fact that<br />
the propensity of people to change their savings habits is slow to<br />
happen, then this is going to be particularly true of the United States<br />
one feels and it will take a while, also, for the Japanese to change their<br />
habits. That is, to start running down their savings and spending on<br />
domestic demand and infrastructure. We have got to create other<br />
trading opportunities and better trading environments for these large<br />
relationships to be somewhat, you know, complemented by other<br />
trading opportunities and you can see this very obviously in the<br />
statistical change in the relationship between Japan and the<br />
United States and Japan's reliance upon the United States market.<br />
That has changed a lot in the last five years and I think it will change a<br />
lot in the next five years.<br />
J: Prime Minister, if you have got these two giant economies trying to<br />
resolve their trade differences by way of trade war, doesn't that<br />
undermine the very basis of APEC and put into doubt the Bogor<br />
vision?<br />
PM: Oh, I don't think that is right at all and you would have noticed in the<br />
Financial Review today, Winston Lord, the US Assistant Secretary of<br />
State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, talking about the importance of<br />
the Bogor Declaration and how it ought to be advanced in Osaka.<br />
In other words, you know, in what is another one of these disputes.<br />
I mean we had the autoparts one a couple of years ago and now it is<br />
fully built up vehicles and these sort of frantic 301 actions and the rest.<br />
Then you have a high ranking American official coming out talking<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL 1.' 9y. 5 $: uNo. Cu7 P' 05/<br />
about the global, or the blanket, solution the multilateral solution<br />
tends to, I think, reinforce the point I am making. That is, that APEC is<br />
one of the good things on the horizon given the fact that the G-7 is<br />
doing nothing about any multilateral solutions to any further advancing<br />
of reducing trade protectionism worldwide. The only group doing it is<br />
APEC and I think Lord's articulation of that argument in Tokyo, a day<br />
or so ago, underlines its importance.<br />
J-Prime Minister do you have any evidence at all that Japan has taken<br />
steps in any way to advance the vision of the Bogor Declaration since<br />
it was made?<br />
PM: Oh, yes, we have had a couple of quite good officials meetings at this<br />
point and they have gone quite pleasingly for those of us who have<br />
been Interested in really making certain that Osaka produces a good<br />
outcome and I think you will find that also the influence of Indonesia<br />
will be important in this, as President Soeharto was not only the host,<br />
but, of course, the host during the formation of the Declaration in a<br />
sense, passing on the baton to Prime Minister Murayama the strength<br />
of his own position will not be lost on the Japanese either.<br />
J: Prime Minister why did you agree to accept a Honorary Degree? What<br />
is it for and would you look forward to being known as Dr Keating<br />
afterwards?<br />
PM: Well I am not particularly interested in labels and handles, I think you<br />
would have worked that out by now. It's something which is an honour<br />
to Australia, not simply to me and it is basically about our role, and my<br />
own within it, in the creation of a multilateral framework for trade and<br />
investment in the Asia Pacific and finding, if you like, structures which<br />
include Japan and take account of Japan's place in the world and I<br />
mean I think that is the antecedence of it and I am more than honoured<br />
by their thought in so acknowledging that work in this way.<br />
J: Mr Keating you talk about encouraging the Japanese to a set of<br />
ambitious and solid outcomes for Osaka. But how do you benchmark<br />
that? I mean it was relatively easy with 20-10 and 20-20 at Bogor, how<br />
do you advance that agenda, what is the benchmark, what is the<br />
minimum?<br />
PM: Well, there are issues there about coverage for instance: how broad<br />
the coverage is, whether there are exclusions or exceptions, how we<br />
advance the process of national country offers, these sorts of things<br />
will be the issues of substance in Osaka. It won't be a simple<br />
headline.<br />
J: So, it is much more technical?<br />
I </p>
<p>TEL: -4Na. OU . t, 1<br />
6<br />
PM: The whole thing is technical. Look at the Uruguay Round. It took<br />
seven years to happen and this will happen much quicker than that.<br />
J: Mr Keating, Dr Mahithir is foreshadowing some fairly dire<br />
consequences of the debate over the Spratley Islands, will you be<br />
talking to Mr Murayama about the Spratley's and if you are what sort of<br />
Position will Australians have on that issue?<br />
PM: I don't know. It may come up, not about the Spratley Islands in<br />
particular, but just about the fact that the very obvious point, that is,<br />
that China is emerging now as a major economy and a major force, it<br />
has always been a major force in Asia, but it is now emerging as a<br />
greater force with a stronger economy and all the more reason why<br />
this is a great opportunity to multilateralise the interests of great<br />
countries like China at this point in their economic history. I think that<br />
is the main point.<br />
J: Do you see this as a potentially volatile situation?<br />
PM: I think Prime Minister Mahithir was simply speaking hypothetically. He<br />
made that point clear himself about problems that can arise. Well, we<br />
know problems can arise but, I think, the important thing is what we do<br />
about setting frameworks up so that tensions between countries are<br />
lessened, opportunities are increased.<br />
J: Prime Minister, is this a good time for you to be leaving Australia<br />
politically given that opinion polls suggested the Budget hasn't really<br />
gone over all that well?<br />
PM: You think I should stay home, maybe sit around in the office there and<br />
talk to you on the telephone or something? Look, I am pretty happy<br />
with the Government's progress. I think, what the Budget reveals is<br />
that the Government is the only Party in this Parliament that has got a<br />
set of structured policies. The change in superannuation will be<br />
important to us all when all of us in this room are long gone from<br />
Canberra, long gone from active duty. That superannuation change<br />
will sit there in the service of the nation through into the next<br />
millennium and also getting Australia back into surplus marks us out<br />
amongst countries who have got discipline with low inflation. They are<br />
things, I think, that were important taking the pressure of interest<br />
rates these are all significant changes and the notion, in that context,<br />
that the Government has got, if you like, long term difficulties beating<br />
somebody who has got no policies. I mean, John Howard keeps<br />
invoking the fifth amendment, he won't own up to any policies on the<br />
basis that it might incriminate him or I won't show my policies because<br />
that Mr Keating might pinch them. I think the public are going to say<br />
' hey, cut it out, what are you playing us for?' </p>

J; So, if you think the Budget is going so well and given the fact that<br />
interest rates have been coming down and unemployment has been<br />
dropping, given all of that, are you then disappointed or can you<br />
understand what..<br />
PM: No, no, I think it is solidifying the Government's it is like the base<br />
note and the treble note, they both take the same time to play, but<br />
which is the one that has the impact on you? Let's call that big thud<br />
from the Budget, it has been well received out there in terms of the<br />
political weight of it in the community, which is good for confidence in<br />
the country and good for the Government.<br />
J: But it is not showing up in the polls as being well received.<br />
PM; I think it probably is. It is just making our two Party preferred vote just<br />
more solid, but I have said to you before, it is only a politician who can<br />
read the hieroglyphics of the polls, never, rarely ever journalists.<br />
J: Mr Keating, is the Government still fully committed to the sale of ANL?<br />
PM:-That is a process which is on at the moment. Laurie Brereton has<br />
touch with it. I don't have touch with it and haven't had for the last<br />
couple of days.<br />
J-Are you concerned by the threat by the maritime unions though, that<br />
you can not sell<br />
P M. To be honest, I haven't been across that.<br />
J: Is the Government going to call an inquiry into the Hindmarsh Island<br />
affair'?<br />
PM: I am not here to go around the world for sport. I was here basically to<br />
talk about the visit to Japan.<br />
J: Prime Minister, to Japan, next week we will have another alarming<br />
balance of payments number.<br />
PM: Are you sure it is going to be alarming?<br />
J. Are you sure it Is not?<br />
PM: But, you are making the statement. I'm not.<br />
J: OK, I'll bet you it is alarming. I bet it is well over $ 2 billion. No?<br />
PM:-Well, hype and hyperbole is the stock and trade of the ' 7: 30 Report'<br />
these days. OK.<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL 8<br />
J: We have a situation where you can see that the solutions to these<br />
structural problems are not quick.<br />
PM: No, they are not quick no.<br />
J: Meanwhile the Japanese face the prospect of perhaps becoming less<br />
of a customer of ours for commodities that have been implicit in their<br />
having a big domestic manufacturing base which seems to be moving,<br />
off shore, at some speed. In the medium to longer term, what does<br />
that say about our balance of payments?<br />
PM: The thing to look at is, basically, the trend improvement in exports.<br />
Ten years ago we exported 13 per cent of GDP. We are now<br />
exporting 22 per cent, but more I think, it might be 24 per cent from<br />
memory. We are a long way towards doubling our exports to GDP.<br />
Japan's industrial structure has changed, it has moved out of certain<br />
industries, but other countries have moved into them. Korea is an<br />
obvious one and where now, in the last three months, Korea has<br />
become our second largest trading partner because we are exporting<br />
products into that market. You know at Toyota, I had the pleasure of<br />
opening the plant there about six weeks ago in Victoria, the day that I<br />
went there they signed a $ 400 million contract, I think from memory<br />
30,000 cars, to sell into the Toyota worldwide dealership. So, we are<br />
getting the benefits of a change in the structure of trade with Japan<br />
that is, in the so-called process of hollowing out, putting their<br />
manufacturing facilities in other places and a shift in the nature of the<br />
trade where in certain trades it is now, countries like Korea, are doing<br />
more than they are doing. So, we are picking up the business there<br />
even if we are losing it In Japan.<br />
So, the main thing is* What runs our capacity to deal with the current<br />
account? Answer savings and investment and competitiveness. The<br />
savings are the point we tried to cover in the Budget. The<br />
competitiveness, I have been telling you recently and I will repeat<br />
again, we are 40 per cent more competitive now than 1983, that is with<br />
driving the exports, R&amp; D and education are driving the product<br />
innovation. As that Treasury graph shows very obviously in Statement<br />
two, you can see where the call in the public sector in the 1970s and<br />
the shift in the profit share completely dislocated Australian investment<br />
and we ended up with a big fall in the capital stock. That started<br />
producing the current account deficits for us. Six per cent of GDP in<br />
1980 and that started building up the debt and it came from a<br />
merchandise trade deficit. We are now closing that up by a big shift to<br />
exports, what we have now got to deal with is the block of old debt.<br />
And, in part, we are dealing with that by the big stock of Australian<br />
assets off shore which Statement Two was also quite instructive about.<br />
We have now got $ 136 billion of assets off shore against $ 160 billion<br />
of overseas debt and, of course, as I have said and the Budget papers<br />
also say, from the superannuation changes alone, by the year 2000 we<br />
TEL: . May. 95 3: 40 No. 007 P. 08/ 10 </p>
<p>9<br />
should have an additional two per cent of GDP in savings and in the<br />
Budget probably more. So, in terms of medium term savings change, it<br />
is really a very substantial one. That with the competitiveness should<br />
basically see that change, but of course, in any investment cycle like<br />
this, you will always see a jump in producer goods and by and large<br />
they are things that we don't ourselves make and we will always have<br />
a great bubble of those in the current account numbers and, I guess,<br />
we will have to understand that as they come they will be producing<br />
goods into the future. At least, they are going to give us a better rate<br />
of return than the investments we had in the late 1980s where we were<br />
using up savings, chewing up savings, but not for a great return in the<br />
current account.<br />
J: When will we see a stabilisation of the current account deficit under<br />
the Keating strategy?<br />
PM: You won't see it without a longer term change to savings which we<br />
have now, I think, fairly solidly got into place and you won't see it<br />
without the continuing entrepreneurship and access by Australian<br />
business to markets around the Asia-Pacific in particular. That is what<br />
the trip to Japan is about.<br />
J: Is there a message In the polls that some of the Budget initiatives like<br />
the savings strategy are going to take a while to sell to the electorate?<br />
PM. I don't think so. I think the public were interested to see that the<br />
Government actually put something solid under the economic growth<br />
we have been having. They wanted to see a weighing off of pressure<br />
off monetary policy onto fiscal policy. You have seen the bond selling<br />
program dropped from $ 21 billion last year to $ 6 billion this year which<br />
is, to call it a weighing off, is the understatement of the century. A<br />
$ 15,000 million reduction in the bond selling program, is it any wonder<br />
long bond yields dropped. And, I think, they think a good and solid<br />
thing has been done and they have put that in their thinking and, as I<br />
say, it just solidifies the Government's two party preferred vote.<br />
J: The s elling of it isn't over, you had two weeks of very..<br />
PM: Yes, and I think the Government had a very good two weeks. You<br />
know that by nearly everyone you speak to. They thought the Budget<br />
was well received. Frankly, John Howard, curling up and making<br />
himself the smallest target possible, by saying nothing, as I say<br />
invoking the fifth amendment saying ' I won't talk about policies<br />
because they might commit me or incriminate me and I think I can go<br />
to an election with no policies', I think he is kidding himself. But, the<br />
public know he is kidding them.<br />
J: Well, John Howard says everyone he speaks to though in main stream<br />
Australia says that they didn't like your Budget?<br />
TEL 23 May 95 3: 40 No. 007 F. 09/ 10 </p>
<p>TEL: 23. May. 9 5 3: 4u No. uur r. i-u/<br />
PM: Well, if you believe that, then you believe in fairies at the bottom of the<br />
garden. The fact of the matter is the Budget was, I think, very well<br />
received around the country. In fact, most everywhere I went, be it<br />
Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane, running into all sorts of people, they thought<br />
the Budget was well done. The thing is, there can be no credibility and<br />
honesty in politics without policies. That is the foundation touch<br />
stones of credibility and honesty. And, a party which wants to go to a<br />
poll, as the Liberal party does, without policies will be neither credible<br />
nor honest. Thank you.<br />
