EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY*.<br />
AT l. OOPM PRM MINISTER! A<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE INAUGURATION OF ST. CHARBEEJ'S MONASTRY AND COLLEGE<br />
PUNCHBOWL SUNDAY 10 MARCH 1985<br />
Premier Neville Wran, Abbot Paul Naaman, ministerial<br />
colleagues, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It gives me great pleasure to be with you on this<br />
important day for the inauguration of St. Charbel's<br />
Monastery and College.<br />
When I look around here I am impressed by what has been<br />
accomplished in such a short time by the Maronite Order<br />
of monks since their small beginning in Punchbowl in<br />
1973.<br />
Abbot Naaman, who laid the foundation of St. Charbel's<br />
College on his last visit here in March 1982, will be<br />
delighted today to see stage one of the college built<br />
and operational and also the adjoining monastery<br />
building which will serve your community well.<br />
It is a credit to the monks and your community that<br />
these buildings have been built in such a short time to<br />
Join, I understand, another nine missions around the<br />
world. It is yet another landmark in the long story of major<br />
contributions by the Lebanese community to Australian<br />
society. Many of you here today have chosen to build your lives<br />
in Australia because of the tragedies which have<br />
overtaken your homeland, Lebanon.<br />
My Government shares your sorrow at what has happened in<br />
Lebanon. Lebanon has been enveloped by tragedy, and has<br />
become the focus for some of the most intense and<br />
intractable problems in the Middle East. We have all<br />
been witness to that tragedy, but our policy towards<br />
Lebanon is not that of a detached and disinterested<br />
observer. All of us here hope that warfare, tragedy, loss of life<br />
and suffering in Lebanon may soon come to an end. We </p>
<p>2.<br />
are deeply concerned that a peaceful resolution of the<br />
conflict be found.<br />
In this context we welcome Israel's plan for a phased<br />
withdrawal, the first phase of which has already been<br />
implemented. All other foreign armed forces must also<br />
be removed, and only those remain which are there at the<br />
express wish of the Government of Lebanon.<br />
As I have said many times before, it will only be when<br />
this happens that the people of Labanon will be able to<br />
resume a normal and peaceful life. Australia, for its<br />
part, supports fully the efforts of the Lebanese<br />
Government to restore its authority over the entire<br />
territory of Lebanon and looks forward to the day when,<br />
with the return of true independence, national<br />
reconciliation without further bloodshed will be<br />
achieved.<br />
2 One of Australia's greatest strengths has been its<br />
acceptance of people from quite diverse nationalities<br />
around the world.<br />
Our plurality and diversity is a national asset to be<br />
cherished and safeguarded.<br />
We live in a society which, while supporting a common<br />
group of institutions, legal rights and obligations,<br />
leaves individuals free to maintain their religion,<br />
language and customs. In this way, all the communities<br />
such as your own, contribute to the richness and<br />
traditions of our nation. The resulting broad racial<br />
and social consensus is a great achievement.<br />
For its part, the Government aims to promote a just and<br />
equitable society that<br />
accepts people irrespective of their ethnic or<br />
cultural background and<br />
provides members of the different cultural groups<br />
and ethnic communities in Australia with the<br />
effective opportunity to participate in Australian<br />
society and to achieve their own potential.<br />
Maintenance of our non-discriminatory immigration<br />
program is crucial. Through it we aim to meet<br />
Australia's social and humanitarian obligations while<br />
accommodating prevailing domestic economic conditions.<br />
Side by side with our immigration program, the<br />
Australian Government also attaches great importance to<br />
developing programs in the community which will assist<br />
migrants to feel part of our country to feel<br />
Australian, </p>
<p>3.<br />
Since assuming office in 1983 the Labor Government has<br />
moved to strengthen many of the programs developed to<br />
address the needs of migrants. For instance we have<br />
increased from 140 to more than 200 the number of<br />
grants-in-aid to employ multilingual welfare<br />
workers launched a migrant workers rights scheme<br />
extended and strengthened the migrant resource<br />
centre network<br />
increased funding of the adult migrant education<br />
program and<br />
boosted funding for translator and interpreter<br />
services.<br />
Through our community relations policies we will<br />
continue to encourage communities such as yours to<br />
maintain and share their cultural heritage with other<br />
Australians. In this regard it is pleasing that the Lebanese<br />
Community Council of New South Wales was launched two<br />
weeks ago. It should provide a framework for<br />
co-ordinating settlement support to the dispersed<br />
Lebanese community in New South Wales.<br />
While recognizing the political and religious<br />
differences among members of the Council it is<br />
imperative that everyone involved work together for the<br />
common benefit. The Council's work is of the utmost<br />
importance and I wish it well for the future.<br />
People come to this land for a home and security for<br />
their families. High among aspirations of Australians<br />
is access to a good education for their children.<br />
We have a great tradition in Australia of co-operation<br />
between government and the community to meet the special<br />
needs of our-people. This tradition is most important<br />
in its impact on our young people in the development of<br />
Australia's national education system.<br />
One feature which has impacted on our education system<br />
has been the sacrifice that individuals have been<br />
prepared to make to develop non-government schools in<br />
this country.<br />
There has been a great deal of debate about the future<br />
of non-government schools, in particular the<br />
continuation of Commonwealth assistance. </p>
<p>We as a government have grappled with these problems and<br />
have developed a policy that ensures that our education<br />
system copes with the diversity of our society in terms<br />
of abilities, aspirations and needs.<br />
Schools such as your own are an integral part of that<br />
system.<br />
Our new scheme of assistance recognises that parents may<br />
choose a non-government schooling for their children,<br />
for any of a number of reasons be they educational,<br />
religious or cultural. Our policy acknowledges the<br />
continuing partnership between the Commonwealth, the<br />
States and the school community to ensure a satisfactory<br />
standard of education for all.<br />
It is intended to ensure that assistance should be<br />
firmly based on the principle of need.<br />
Although the first stage of St. Charbel's College was<br />
built from the Lebanese Community's own resources, the<br />
Commonwealth Government provided grants totalling more<br />
than $ 160,000 in 1984 to assist in the establishment of<br />
facilities at the new school, for English language<br />
instruction and to meet general operating costs.<br />
For 1985, your school has been placed in one of the<br />
highest levels for any school seeking Government<br />
support. This will ensure that the College has the<br />
assistance it needs in future years.<br />
The young are our hope and our pride and offer the best<br />
chance for a secure future together. You are providing<br />
the opportunity your children also need to preserve<br />
their ties of family and tradition.<br />
C For our part as a Government we will assist you in your<br />
endeavours to build a great future for all Australians.<br />
The paths along which we are all proceeding are, I<br />
believe, converging to lead to an even richer and more<br />
vibrant soci'ety in the future. </p>
