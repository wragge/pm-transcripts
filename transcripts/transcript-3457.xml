REFERENCE TO IAC ON ACETYL PRODUCTS<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that he had<br />
forwarded a reference to the Industries Assistance Commission<br />
on acetaldehyde; acetic acid, acetic anhldride vinyl acetate<br />
and moulding compounds of cellulose acetate.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said the reference was complementary<br />
to the reference already held by the Commission on cellulose<br />
acetate flake and the Commission had been empowered to take<br />
evidence on any raw material used in the production of<br />
cellulose acetate flake and vinyl acetate monomer.<br />
