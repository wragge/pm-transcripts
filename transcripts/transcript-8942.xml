TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THIE HON. P. J. KEATING, M. P.<br />
EDGELL-I3IRDS EYE PLANT, IJLVERSTONE, TASMANIA<br />
MONDAY 23 AUGUST, 1993<br />
3: Mr Keating, an issue that's been dominating the local headlines today is that<br />
Savage River and their criticism over the fuel excise: They've got major<br />
concerns... inaudible..., will lead to the premature closing down of the mine.<br />
PM: Yes, well they all say things like that. I mean, the fact is, last week interest rates<br />
at the Reserve Bank and Bill rates in this country went below 5% 4.75%,<br />
Any of these companies, if they've got any debt, or in the event that their<br />
general business environment with customers in this low inflation, low interest<br />
environment is vastly improved. The Budget has just cut the company tax rate<br />
to 33% from 391/. We've just given them further accelerated depreciation on<br />
any equipment they may be using. So, it's a case of looking at all of it, Not<br />
one bit of it.<br />
J: How far are you prepared to tough out the Budget, Mr Keating?<br />
PM: There are a couple of important things, I think, to say about the Budget. The<br />
first thing is the Budget hands more back in tax cuts than it takes in the<br />
increase in indirect taxation. When these measures are up and running the<br />
Bludget hands back $ 3.8 billion a year in tax cuts and it raises $ 3 billion in<br />
indirect taxes, Even this year with the increases in petrol etcetera, the revenue<br />
of the Commonwealth in the total economy, revenue toG5DP is actually falling.<br />
It's going to go down from 23.6% last year to 23.5% this year. And that's why<br />
the OECD) will tell you in two weeks time that Australia is the lowest taxed<br />
country in the western world.<br />
Aud-the other key point is -about the Budget it gets the deficit down to<br />
I% around 1% of GDP' in 1996-97. Now, what you're seeing at the<br />
moment is the stock market booming, you're seeing a pick up in prices and<br />
earnings and that reflected in the stock market, we're starting to see it coming<br />
through in investmntt. And we want to now we've got a recovery really<br />
moving we want to make surc that by 1996-97 we're not out there with a big<br />
public borrowing requirement, that the public sector's out of the road so private<br />
investment can go on in a low inflation sustainable recovery. That's the big<br />
picture, that's the thing that really matters. </p>
<p>IM. LL 4LQ riLLj LV Z*<br />
-2-<br />
So, that's why the Budget is targeted at that 1% of GDP deficit, in the middle<br />
nineties. That is why the Budget revenue to GDP is still going down because<br />
we're handing back more in those personal cuts than we're getting in indirect<br />
revenue, and that's why we think the Budget's got the right construction for<br />
Australia.<br />
I But most people don't think that why. I mean how are you going to get it<br />
through the Senate and particularly those you mentioned the petrol and<br />
optomctry inaudible.<br />
PM: Well they are part of a package which gives substantial tax cuts fr-om<br />
November. So, people just can't say, ' oh well look at that, look at the petrol'.<br />
If that was a stand alone measure and there were no tax cuts you could say well<br />
ok, there's some very understandable criticism there.<br />
J: Are you going to do a deal with the Democrats to get<br />
PM: Look, the Budget's strength is that Australia is one of the first countries into an<br />
obvious redovery, it's a low inflationary recovery unlike all the others, and we<br />
want to make sure this one goes right through the nineties. So when we start<br />
to see private investment pick up we want the Budget deficit down. Now, to<br />
do other than things like that is basically to, you know, sell the public interest<br />
down the tube. To do other than things like that is to not do the serious things<br />
of Government.<br />
J: Are you going to have to cut a deal though?<br />
PM: Well I've just said to you the structure of the Budget is a good one. We've sent<br />
the Senate a package and we are saying in that package there are tax cuts and<br />
there are indirect tax increases but it's a package.<br />
1: What about the legality of getting it through the Senate?<br />
PM; Well, I notice that these debates come up about the legality or otherwise.<br />
There is no problem about the legality of the Bill. Don't have any doubt about<br />
that. But the legality is one point. If the Senate were to amend this Bill, or<br />
seek to amend it, whether it can amend it or not let's say it can because I<br />
think-it can we won't accept the amendments unless they suit us. Because<br />
the Government has put it up as a package. It has got tax cuts, and it has got<br />
indirect tax increases and it has got other features. So, it's not a matter of the<br />
whys or wherefores, will they, won't [ hey, maybe, can they amend the Bill. The<br />
key question is will the Government, in the House of Representatives, accept<br />
the Bill when it comes back?<br />
J: Some of your backbench though might be willing to accept some amendments, </p>
<p>I LL -3<br />
PM: Well, I've brought in nine budgets and eight May statements. And two<br />
economic statements since I became Prime Minister. That brings me to around<br />
eighteen or nineteen. On every one of those there was always some<br />
backbencher wanting to amend something.<br />
J: But this time we've got the Morgan-Gallup poll showing you've slipped well<br />
and truly behind the Opposition. Is that a concern?<br />
PM: Well, you know these things go up and down all the time. I mean, it's early<br />
days in a long Parliament, you know.<br />
J: You've got Mr Beazley saying you're willing to put that at risk to go to that<br />
extent, to go to an election.<br />
PM; Well, no, he didn't say that. He didn't say that at all. But the fact is don't<br />
polls are very special things. They're like codes before they've been deciphered<br />
and they can mostly only be deciphered by politicians. So don't try and read<br />
them too hard.<br />
J: Are you going to talk to the Greens or the Democrats?<br />
PM: You've asked me that three times...<br />
J: Just to localise, there has been scathing attacks on your budget from our state<br />
government.<br />
PM: Surprise, surprise.<br />
I flow do you see that affecting the recovery here?<br />
PM: Well, see this plant here. It is here because of' a commonwealth Labor<br />
government. It has got nothing to do with Ray Groom. The remaking of<br />
Australian industry is happening because of low inflation, a competitive<br />
exchange rate, low corporate tax rates and basically a cooperative environment<br />
in the workplace. Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor. Nothing to do with the<br />
Coalition down here. This plant is here because of the Labor Government and<br />
a decent international Australian business, Pacific Dunlop.<br />
Now, the best thing the state government can do is go on and manage their<br />
own affairs. Manage the things that they have responsibility for and let us run<br />
the national economy.<br />
J: Mr Willis yesterday said that hc wouldn't rule out fuzrther spending cuts. That's<br />
a bit of a contradiction.. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM: No, no. We're into this sort of.. We've now got a press gallery with a<br />
corporate memory going back about two May statements and one Budget.<br />
When they could go back seven or eight Budgets they'd know what that meant.<br />
What I'm saying what I said last week was that we will not cut outlays below<br />
where they'll be in about 1994-95. Which is about 24% of GDP. When you<br />
wash the unemployment benefits out of it, when you look at the structure of<br />
the outlays, to cut one or two percent of GDP in other words to cut the<br />
spending of the Commonwealth back as a structural prop for Budgets is not<br />
acceptable. That is not to say we won't do what we do in every other Budget, is do a<br />
housekeeping job on the Budget housekeeping job on outlays. Cutting<br />
$ 200, $ 300 or $ 400 million. But that's not $ 7 billion or $ 8 billion. But that's<br />
what we're being enjoined to do by some of the sort of fiscal junkies who write<br />
columns in the newspapers. Hop into the outlays. See, they said to us, ' what<br />
you need to do is to cut the Budget deficit back to 1% of GDP. We said, ' OK,<br />
well go and do that'. When we did it they said, ' Aha, we don't like the way you<br />
did it. Wed prefer it to be all spending cuts and not revenue.' To which we<br />
say, ' to cut the outlays back any more than that is irresponsible.' It would be<br />
unfair and it is unreasonable.<br />
J: You said the state government should look after its own affairs but the<br />
government is concerned there's a $ 20 million gap in the estimates presented at<br />
the Premier's Conference and the actual special grants delivered in the Budget.<br />
PM: Well, that's about being in government. It is a hard caper. And if you want to<br />
be a Premier, you have to face up to the hard tack of being a Premier. And not<br />
asking this fellow to write a cheque for you.<br />
ENDS. </p>
