FRENCH ffUCLEAR TUiSTING<br />
The Prime M1inister and Acting Minister for Foreign<br />
,. ffairs, rlr Whitlam, said today that the Government had reason<br />
to believe that France had carried out an underground nuclear<br />
test on Fangataufa atoll in the Pacific Ocean on 6 June.<br />
1" Ir Whitlam said that the Australian Government wished<br />
t; o reiterate its opposition to all forms of nuclear weapons<br />
testing by any state. The Australian Government continued to<br />
urge the nuclear powers to reach agreement on a comprehensive<br />
test ban. At the same time the Australian Government noted that<br />
the French Government was refraining from conducting nuclear<br />
weapons tests in the atmoshpere in the Pacific region. The<br />
Australian Government hoped that the French Government would<br />
continue to refrain from further atmoshperic nuclear tests which<br />
in the past years have given rise to considerable concern in<br />
ikustralia and other countries. </p>
