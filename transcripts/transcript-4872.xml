FOR PRESS 31 October 1978<br />
HANDICAPPED PERSON OF THE YEAR AWARD<br />
I am honoured to have been asked to present the first<br />
Handicapped Person of the Year Award. This is an important<br />
award for many reasons but above all, it is an important<br />
award because by giving public recognition to the<br />
achievement of the first winner of the Award it focusses<br />
not so much on the han~ licap but on the capacity the<br />
capacity to overcome difficulty, the capacity to<br />
achieve, the capacity to make a useful contribution to<br />
society. It is beyond doubt that handicapped people have the ability<br />
to achieve a great deal in our society but unfortunately,<br />
this is not sufficiently widely recognised. In many respects<br />
the greatest disability faced by the handicapped is not<br />
the physical or mental disability they have to face, but<br />
the persistence of some attitudes in others which are<br />
both deep-rooted and ill-founded.<br />
There is, in our society, I believe a great deal of care and<br />
concern for the handicapped but unfortunately, this all too<br />
often goes with the belief that the handicapped cannot<br />
achieve a great deal for themselves, or contribute much<br />
to the society. There is a tendency to have a stereotype of<br />
the " handicapped"; to view the handicapped as an<br />
undifferentiated group, rather than as individuals with<br />
different needs, ambitions and talents.<br />
Across a wide range of areas there is a subtle and sometimes<br />
not so subtle discrimination against the handicapped a<br />
discrimination which has its origins in ignorance and<br />
sometimes fear a fear of vulnerability to suffering some<br />
disability ourselves which leads to a rejection of the<br />
disabled. The consequences of this attitude are an attempt<br />
to help, but not become too deeply involved; to provide<br />
assistance at arm's length; to view the handicapped as<br />
helpless and adopt a stance of unthinking paternalism.<br />
At worst there may be an active resistance to the handicapped.<br />
For instance the attempt to prevent the placement of facilities<br />
for the handicapped in particular areas because such<br />
facilities will " spoil the street" or " lower property values".<br />
Such attitudes systematically block the strivings ' of the<br />
handicapped for self-realisation and impede their attempts<br />
to integrate into the community. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Programmes for the handicapped and public expenditure<br />
on income maintenance is important to allow individual<br />
talents and abilities to be developed and used to<br />
the utmost, and I believe that the record of this Government<br />
is second to none in this regard. But even more<br />
importantly, we all need to work together and mobilise<br />
public opinion to overcome the stereotypes of the handicapped<br />
and the discrimination they suffer.<br />
Social attitudes, especially those that are based on<br />
unexamined assumptions, are highly resistant to change.<br />
The task is thus a difficult, but not an impossible one.<br />
Community attitudes are, I believe, in the process of<br />
change becoming less discriminatory and more accepting<br />
of the handicapped and there is rightly a greater<br />
assertiveness among the handicapped. We all need to do our<br />
utmost to accelerate this process of change and I believe<br />
that this Handicapped Person of the Year Award will take us<br />
a further step in this process.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure in announcing<br />
that the Handicapped Person of the Year Award for 1978<br />
has been won by Mrs. EliZabeth Kosmala.<br />
