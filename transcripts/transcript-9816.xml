PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MPD<br />
SPEECH AT BOX HILL TOWN HALL, MELBOURNE, 27 OCTOBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you very much for that very generous and enthusiastic welcome. Helen<br />
( Mayor), Tony and Sandy ( Robinson), my parliamentary colleague John<br />
( Thwaites), Kelvin ( Thomson) and any others who may be with us today from the<br />
Victorian Labor Party, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen and boys and<br />
girls. It is great of you to come along and to support Tony and the Party in the battle<br />
for Chisholm and to focus some of the public Issues that are now in the current<br />
debate as the Coalition tries to remake itself.<br />
So much of the last decade of our politics has actually swum around Box Hill.<br />
This was the site of John Howard's ' Little Big Horn' in 1987. This is the place<br />
where he had his last stand and, of course, he went down with that taxation and<br />
health policy of his and as a consequence we have seen Labor win two<br />
subsequent elections. We won 1987 and we won It, really, here in Box Hill in<br />
1987 and, of course, that gave us a chance to win 1990 and 1993 and it has<br />
given the country the chance to grow and change itself and adapt Itself into one<br />
of the fairest societies In the world. That would not have been the case if Mr<br />
Howard's miserable conservative message, which he launched here in Box Hill<br />
In 1987 had of had the support of the Australian public.<br />
But, the thing about the Torries is that they never change. It wouldn't matter<br />
whether it was John Howard in 1987 or John Howard in 1995 or Stanley<br />
Melbourne Bruce In 1921. It wouldn't matter, it Is always the same message.<br />
I have often said and I quote Manning Clarke's words about Australians dividing<br />
themselves into two categories. The enlargers of Australian life and the<br />
punlshers and the straighteners. The people have belief and faith in Australians,<br />
who believe In themselves and know they can do good things together and<br />
enlarge and make the place bigger and greater and better and those who say </p>
<p>' keep your place, keep your eyes to the ground, be happy with what you have<br />
got, know your place', the punishers and the straighteners. And, of course, Mr<br />
Howard belongs to the punishing and straightening camp and so, of course,<br />
does Mr Kennett.<br />
Nothing has ever changed with them even though nearly one hundred years on<br />
from our Federation, with all the bounty and wealth that the country has, they still<br />
have the same miserable view that they have had right throughout the century<br />
and when, of course, speaking now as we do about industrial relations and<br />
health being two of the principle issues, these are the issues that they have been<br />
on. John Howard is now trying to remake himself. All of the things which he has said<br />
and done throughout his record of public life he is now trying to disown roll<br />
himself up into a very small ball and say ' just look at the Government, don't look<br />
at me and don't dare repeat what I have ever stood for in the past, because if<br />
you do I will call you a liar' and that is what he does. We say of Mr Howard,<br />
' you have always been in favour of cuts to real wages, you have opposed every<br />
wage increase bar one since 1978'. ' Lie' he says ' lie'. So, you have always<br />
been opposed to Medicare? Uie. This is his technique now, to try to paint<br />
himself to be something that he isn't. But we have got to remember that 16 of<br />
the 19 members of his front bench are the same people who put Fightback<br />
together just three years ago. The same people who want to throw the<br />
unemployed off benefits after nine months. The same people who wanted a<br />
GST. The same people who wanted to cut Si10,000 million $ 10 billion out of<br />
government spending and mostly in the social wage. The same people who<br />
wanted young people working for $ 3.00 per hour. Sixteen of the nineteen of<br />
them are still there. The so called new ' group' as he puts it.<br />
He got asked the other day on an Adelaide radio station Mr Howard what do<br />
you think will be the big issue In the next election?' He said and he now has this<br />
Menzian tone about him, he says sagely Well, think the real issue of the next<br />
election is that a new group will come to run Australia. A new group will come to<br />
lead Australia and that Is what, think, the issue is going to be'. Apparently, it is<br />
now on a rotational basis. They have had five turns, it Is now our turn. It is like<br />
when Andrew Peacock was around. Andrew got two turns so he wanted two<br />
turns. I said ' oh, the new group', the new Prime Minister perhaps, John Howard,<br />
he is very new. Or the new Deputy Prime Minister Mr Fischer. Who when asked<br />
on Lateline two weeks ago when quizzed about their lack of policies and asked<br />
by Kerry O'Brien for some definition of what their policy prescription said, he said<br />
I.. we have got a number of policies out there, we have got a policy out there on<br />
the black spots program' he said. That was the first thing he mentioned, the<br />
black spots program on the roads. This was his reason for a change of national<br />
government. And the, of course, we have got the very new Shadow Treasurer </p>
<p>or the very new Foreign Affairs Minister Mr Downer. So, these are the things<br />
that they are saying.<br />
We are now focussing on their industrial relations policies and we are focussing<br />
on their health policies. Given the battle at the Little Big Horn here in 1987 1 just<br />
thought I would go back and just repeat from a transcript which was done a few<br />
days before the election on 1 June 1987 by Mr Howard on the John Laws<br />
program in Sydney. Mr Laws asked him about whether there would be<br />
reductions coming from for lower personal tax, he said well, they will be very<br />
major reductions. In health, the Medicare system is a total disaster. We will be<br />
proposing changes to Medicare that will amount to its de facto dismantling. We<br />
will put it right apart. The second thing we will do is get rid of the bulk billing<br />
system, it is an absolute rort.' So the questioner Mr Laws says so really what<br />
you are saying is what you will do is take us back to how things were pre-<br />
Medicare?' John Howard says ' As best we can, yes, recognising that in a<br />
society you never go completely back, but I would love to go back.'<br />
You see now, there it Is. But now we are supposed to say ' oh you are a believer<br />
in Medicare are you John?. You are going out there kidding everybody that you<br />
are going to keep it while you want to put $ 1 billion into private health?' And he<br />
says ' yes'. We say ' but look, your record is that you have opposed bulk billing<br />
twice in the Parliament. That in 1993 you actually wanted to dismantle Medicare<br />
as part of the Fightback policy. In 1987 you had these things to say about it.<br />
Really, you are intending, if you get into office, to dismantle Medicare and<br />
twisting the system back to private health.' He says ' lie'.<br />
The thing about politicians, there is a lot of poor commentary in this country<br />
about politicians because some people in the media think that they don't have<br />
convictions. Politicians do have convictions. They have beliefs and mostly you<br />
show me anyone 55 years of age, who has been in public life for 30 years, who<br />
has a long track record of views and I'll show you somebody who is basically<br />
going to stick to their views. Just as I have a conviction about opening this<br />
country up, making it internationally competitive, making it fair and equitable,<br />
making the leap into Asia, giving us an identity, having an Australian republic,<br />
these are things I believe in. I am not going to change. John Howard is not<br />
going to change either, but he expects us to believe that he has had a Paullan<br />
conversion someway between the Fightback election and now. He is now in<br />
favour of Medicare. He is in favour of award wages, he is in favour of all these<br />
when we know, in fact, he is not. It Is like seeing a man in a balaclava crouched<br />
in your rhododendrons with a crowbar and a bag. And you would say ' excuse<br />
me, would I be right in inferring that you have sinister Intentions?' And he says<br />
' liar'. You say ' but look, we have seen your record' and he says ' it is a scare<br />
campaign' to which we are supposed to say ' oh look, I'm terribly sorry I wont<br />
disturb you any further. I'll go off to Bridge for the afternoon'. </p>
<p>What do they think It is? Do they really think we are that stupid? Do they think<br />
the whole community while he hides his policy is so silly as to accept his bland,<br />
now, support for Medicare? He will tear Medicare to pieces. He will rip it apart.<br />
He will rip public health apart because he has no respect and they never have<br />
had any respect for public health. Much of this election is going to be about the<br />
sort of society we are. The sort of society we have become. The things that we<br />
regard as community norms and we in the Labor Party have always believed<br />
that one of the things which is a community right is public health. The health of<br />
our citizens, the right to treatment, the right to have a healthy existence, that it is<br />
not a right defined by your Income. That is what we believe and we have always<br />
believed In that. They have always believed in private health. They have always<br />
believed In support for doctors. They believe in now kicking another $ 1 billion<br />
into private health through tax rebates which will go to the incomes of specialists<br />
and private hospitals and to private funds.<br />
Yesterday I told the Parliament that private funds have now got $ 1.35 billion in<br />
reserves. Yet, they have stuck up premiums for private health by 40 per cent in<br />
the last year. They have got $ 1.3 billion in reserves, yet John Howard wants to<br />
give them another $ 1 billion by way of tax rebates for private health insurance<br />
where in fact what he should be doing is putting the money into the public health<br />
system. In the last year the Commonwealth has put $ 800 million into the public health<br />
system and the States have taken $ 700 million from it. In Victoria here Jeff<br />
Kennett has taken $ 260 million out of public hospitals. That Is where they stand.<br />
All around the country coalition governments are taking money out of public<br />
health. Does Mr Howard admonish them? Did he say to Jeff Kennett you are<br />
wrong? Did he say to Dean Brown you are wrong? Did he say to Ray Groom<br />
you are wrong? Or to Richard Court? No. He supports all that. Let me just<br />
repeat something he said in that same interview about health. John Laws said to<br />
him you must be fairly happy that Bruce Shephard is the newly elected<br />
President of the AMA in NSW pledge to destroy Medicare?' Howard says Well,<br />
it does, I have a lot of time for Bruce. I think he is a very courageous man, both<br />
in the personal sense and professional sense.' Laws says will the AMA be<br />
better off? Howard yes, I think, the AMA will more aggressively represent the<br />
interests of free enterprise medicine.' What is free enterprise medicine? What is<br />
free enterprise about the health of the community, but this is their view and they<br />
are ripping money out of the system all around the country.<br />
Jeff Kennett is now thinking of privatising the ambulance service. Now, I know<br />
some ambulance officers are here with us today and I heard that story in Ballarat<br />
the day before yesterday. Where somebody died because when they called,<br />
instead of getting a response in eight minutes it took 55 minutes because no one<br />
was there. Is the state of Victoria so lacking in moral fibre and so poor that it </p>
<p>can't run an ambulance service? Are things so crook that Jeff Kennett has got to<br />
put locks and chains on public toilets on railway stations?<br />
I mean, is that what it has come to under the Liberal Party? I mean, is that what<br />
we are all about in 1995, when the All Ordinaries Index is at 2150? It was under<br />
500 ten years ago a four-fold increase in the wealth of the stock market, a<br />
huge multiples of our national GDP In ten years. And what is it about? Some<br />
sort of miserable, public accountancy view that, you know, we get the books<br />
back into surplus by putting chains on railway station toilets, or privatising the<br />
ambulance service, or in John Howard's case knocking over Medicare and<br />
bulk billing and driving everybody back to private practice to give the specialists<br />
the incomes they think they deserve. I mean, that's what they're about. So,<br />
when John Howard says he supports Medicare, don't believe him. When John<br />
Howard says he is going to keep Medicare, say what you will do John is you will<br />
bust open bulk billing. It will go. The whole notion of public health and universal<br />
access will go if there is a Liberal Government, as sure as I'm standing here it<br />
will go if there is a Liberal government. So, when he does his chameleon act,<br />
and tries to repaint himself, we just need to go back to those quotations on the<br />
John Laws program: " We will be proposing changes to Medicare that amount to<br />
its de-fact dismantling we will pull it right apart. The second thing we will do is<br />
get rid of the bulk billing system it's an absolute rort." So you're really saying<br />
you will take us back? ' Yes. Recognise in society that you never go completely<br />
back, but I would love to go back". And that's where he stands that is what he<br />
has always though. That's how he has always voted, and that's what he will<br />
always do.<br />
Now, the same goes for industrial relations. Industrial relations they are now<br />
saying that we are mis-representing them, that we are liars, and everything else.<br />
And this is the response they have given, and they expect journalists to run it,<br />
and repeat naively ' oh well, the Opposition says they wontt have that that's not<br />
true". We say well hang on, if you have got any guile about you at all? I mean,<br />
is there any scepticism left in journalism in this country? I mean, this is what<br />
they have always done and said why would you think they would change now?<br />
Just simply for the convenience of an election. But what they say on industrial<br />
relations, what we say, is we want a more flexible labour market. We want<br />
enterprise bargaining where people can trade away certain things for greater<br />
beneft, and make the working of the business more flexible, in hours In the sort<br />
of rosters, in some of the penalty rates and overtime rates, but we have an<br />
important element In our policy. We have a thing called the ' no-disadvantage<br />
test". And those agreements have got to go past the arbitration commission,<br />
and they look at them and tick them to see that there is no disadvantage from<br />
the totality of the new package to the employee. So, under our policy you can<br />
have flexibility up, you can flexibility sideways, but you can't have flexibility down.<br />
There is a no-disadvantage test. But the Liberals won't endorse the nodisadvantage<br />
test, because they want cuts in the wages of Australians down. </p>
<p>They want the last two or three deciles of the income of the labour market to be<br />
subject to reductions. And you can see it here in Victoria, and we have allowed<br />
many State registered unions to register themselves under the Federal<br />
jurisdiction, so as to escape these sorts of individual contracts offered by the<br />
Kennett Government. Now, Jeff Kennett told a business audience at the<br />
Business Council last week when the Federal Ubs get into office, the employees<br />
will have nowhere to go. The employees will have nowhere to go they will be<br />
trapped. Trapped. In other words, his model, has employees running around<br />
trying to get wage justice as the sort of Federal legislation, and the State<br />
legislation, closes in on them. And it really matters, because yesterday on the<br />
ABC, Mr Reith was asked pointedly and repeatedly ubut can you guarantee<br />
that there will be no reductions in the pay of people if they actually agree to an<br />
individual contract in the terms you say?". Arnd he said. " we have always<br />
believed In good wages" etc etc, but the journalist came back and said can you<br />
guarantee that no-one will be worse off? And he said " we will be trying to do<br />
our best in all the circumstances". In other words, no guarantee. Because what<br />
they're about is basically flexibility down. What John Howard has always been<br />
about is cuts to lower and middle income earners.<br />
As if the economy isn't strong enough. I mean, we have had 670,000 job growth<br />
in the last 2.5 years. We have got the profit share and that Is the share of<br />
national income going to profits almost without any historic precedence, in<br />
terms of Its height. Its why the stock market is so buoyant. We have had quite<br />
strong productivity. We have had the lowest level now this year of industrial<br />
disputes since 1940. This year, we had 70 working days lost per. thousand<br />
employees. In John Howard's period of office, it was 590 working days lost per<br />
thousand employees. So. if It's not industrial disputes, and it's not productivity.<br />
and it's not the Inflation rate, its not profits, what Is it? Why do they want to hop<br />
into working class incomes? And it's because they are spiteful and nasty that's<br />
all, But that's all it is. Basically, they are ideologically arraigned against the<br />
great majority of the working community. They want to, basically, push them<br />
down the old punishing and straitening point. And you see, don't take my word<br />
for it read what Reith said yesterday: " Can you guarantee Mr Reith, that<br />
people won't be worse off, " We'll do our best in all the circumstances", he said.<br />
In other words, no guarantee. Now, you can see all of this coming out of this<br />
Issue, and it's what I said earlier what sort of society we are, Because<br />
industrial relations is about more than just pay-rates, and classifications and<br />
awards, it's about the sort of country we are. That sort of basic community right<br />
how you relate to your employer, how your employer relates to you, what sort<br />
of labour market there is, what sort of environment you have at work.<br />
See, John Howard runs around and says 1I have always believed in families'. I<br />
don't know what he thinks the rest of us believe in. I mean, does he think we're<br />
Martians we don't come from families? I mean, the arrogance of him, saying<br />
he always believed in families as if the rest of us don't. To which I say yes, you </p>
<p>believe in families, but you don't believe in family support. You believe In<br />
families, but you don't believe in decent wages to support families. You believe<br />
in families, but you don't believe in overtime rates. You believe in families, but<br />
you don't believe in penalty rates. You believe in families, but you don't believe<br />
in the holiday leave-loading. You believe In families, but you don't believe in<br />
universal health insurance, and health access. You believe in families, but only<br />
those on the highest incomes you can give a tax-break to they are the families<br />
you believe in.<br />
Now, this is not an academic discussion, or an academic debate let me just<br />
give you some idea about the impact on working people of these sort of policies.<br />
And It is this let's take a typical ambulance officer, who lost the penalties for<br />
night shift and weekend work ambulance officers, of course, work most<br />
weekends, and plenty of nights, so it's bound to matter quite a lot. And it does.<br />
A typical ambulance officer's pay would be reduced by $ 172 a week, even with<br />
the same hours but without the overtime and penalty rates. That's over $ 8000 a<br />
year lost, and that's a lot of income for officers who typically earn around<br />
$ 36,000 a year. And the same Is true of nurses if you take away from nurses<br />
who, of course, have as components of their income overtime, penalties and<br />
holiday leave loadings to mention a few, there will be no compensation for them<br />
if they are lost, and for the average nurse, it will cost around $ 5000 a year. And<br />
this is a typical nurse not a special case. That is, someone who is working in a<br />
typical circumstance, doing typically certain hours of overtime during penalty<br />
periods. So, there's just 2 classifications of people.<br />
But what sort of Government and you can see it In Western Australia under<br />
that vicious legislation there. Now, the Western Australian Government won't<br />
pay the second $ 8 safety net for nurses they won't have an enterprise bargain<br />
with them, and they won't pay them. What sort of shabby Government beats up<br />
on a group of nurses? That won't give them an $ 8 increase to maintain their<br />
wages? So we, in the Commonwealth Government, have joined with the<br />
Australian Nurses Federation in a case before the Australian Industrial Relations<br />
Commission to bring on and make mandatory the payment of the I mean,<br />
that's what they are about. Now, what Reith will tell you and Mr Howard will<br />
say mhlook, you can stay on the award, we're not changing that, we are<br />
giving you that chic" but what they don't tell you is this that each year,<br />
1.7 million Australian workers either enter the labour market from school, or from<br />
university, or women joining the labour market, or come as migrants, or change<br />
jobs 1.73 million people. In 1994, the number of Melbourne people who faced<br />
a new employer was 270,000. The nation, ft was 1.73 million. If you take a<br />
three year period, 42 per cent of Australian workers will have changed jobs<br />
with~ in three years. That's 42 per cent who will never get a choice about staying<br />
on the award, because once they lose the award, they can't get it back.<br />
They then take the contract, or they take nothing. And so there's no choice.<br />
The Liberals say we're givng people choice but there's no choice in that. </p>
<p>And I gave an example of a woman here in Melbourne who is a librarian, two<br />
weeks ago in Parliament. She was an $ 36,000 a year in her present job, but<br />
wanted to apply for a job as a librarian in a part of Melbourne closer to where<br />
she lived. She put the application in, to find the job now paid $ 19,000. so she<br />
had to stay where she is there's no choice for her. But you see, what happens<br />
is once 2 or 3 years go by, and you have got one business out contracting and<br />
doing work, who have got employees on much diminished wages, and you have<br />
got another business with people on awards, it won't be very long before the 2nd<br />
business Is uncompetitive. So, what will be happening Is they will only take<br />
people on who don't want to go on the awards, and so the whole decay goes into<br />
the system, and the whole underpinning of the award system goes. So, when<br />
Peter Reith says we will give you the choice of staying on the award, say " sure<br />
you will Peter sure you will". And in three years time, half of us will be out<br />
there on individual wage contracts without any protection whatsoever. We will<br />
go back to that master and servant provisions of the British Common Law of the<br />
19th Century.<br />
So, this is the labour market they have in store for the rest of us this is the sort<br />
of way after now a decade of industrial cooperation, with a 3 per cent inflation<br />
rate, with 670,000 job growth, with over 2 million new jobs since 1983, with an<br />
economy performing at nearly twice the rate of economic growth under Labor as<br />
under the Liberals, with a stock market going up by four-fold in value they're<br />
saying well thank you for that cooperation, now we'll tell you what we have<br />
instore for you. You keep your place you get out there in indmdual wage<br />
contract, and you take what the employer offers you. And you say well hang on,<br />
what's wrong with some protections of the awards arnd the safety nets haven't<br />
we struggled for this for a century, and haven't we reasonably operated this<br />
system? And they are just going to go back to the same policies that you would<br />
have seen as I said earlier under the likes of Earl Page of Stanley Melbourne<br />
Bruce or Joe Lyons or any of them they will try to push working people down<br />
And while they are doing it, rip away at one of those fundamentals which is, of<br />
course, protection under the health system and under Medicare.<br />
So this is going to be an important election, just like 1993 was. Now there is a<br />
lot of new wisdom invented particularly by commentators about election results.<br />
They said Labor won the 1993 election because of the GST. That is simply not<br />
true. We won the 1993 election because people had an idea of the sort of<br />
Australia it would become under John Hewson.<br />
You might remember coming up to that campaign I was making a speech in<br />
Brisbane to a Labor audience about the unemployed and we had at the time<br />
unemployment rising not failing. And I said we will never leave the unemployed<br />
behind. We will always put our arm out and bring them up with us. We will bring<br />
them back Into the society. We will deal with the long term unemployed and we<br />
will put a premium on employment and we will bring them along. </p>
<p>John Howson said in Parliament a week later, " the Prime Minister says he will<br />
put his arm out and pull the unemployed up. When you put your arm out to pull<br />
up the unemployed and the disadvantaged, they will pull you down.'<br />
Now it is that sort of remark and that sort of view that lost the Liberals the 1993<br />
election. The OST was but an example of the panoply of nastles they had ready<br />
for the Australian people, including, of course, destroying the health insurance<br />
system amongst others in the biggest tax switch which would have<br />
disadvantaged low and middle income people. And now, they think, they can<br />
hide that. At least Hewsan had his policies there.<br />
The point I make about John Howard, he is always saying " oh, I am honest<br />
John". I say, well listen, what about this for an idea? I believe that honesty and<br />
credibility in politics can only be about policies. That the nation's entitled to know<br />
from its political leaders where they see the national direction going, where they<br />
see the policy framework being developed.<br />
I mean aren't they at least entitled to know where each of the parties would take<br />
them? What sort of honesty can there be without some integrity in the party<br />
policy processes about telling them? But what he thinks he will do is repaint<br />
himself and camouflage himself and try to slide under the wire at an election and<br />
then bring all the nastles out afterwards.<br />
Now we saw a typical example of this, this week, in the Business Review Weekly<br />
a business magazine. In it Peter Costello, the Shadow Treasurer says he will<br />
introduce something to deal with, what is called, the Vertical Fiscal Imbalance In<br />
the payments between the Commonwealth and the States. What he was saying<br />
was a Coalition Government will introduce a State income tax so that the States<br />
can raise more money, more like the money they spend, rather than relying on<br />
the Commonwealth to give it to them.<br />
This expression Vertical Fiscal Imbalance means it Is a comparison between<br />
what the States spend and what they raise and because there is, they say, a<br />
perceived imbalance because the Commonwealth gives them a lot of the money,<br />
they don't actually raise it, States would behave better if they raised the money.<br />
Therefore, they are better with taxing powers.<br />
Now the Liberals have always believed In fracturing Australia back to the States.<br />
They are always talking about new federalism as if the act of Federation was in<br />
some way an act to buttress the States. The act of Federation In 1901 was the<br />
act of the creation of the nation and, since the war, we have seen the<br />
development of a national economy from the uniform taxing powers that came<br />
under John Curtin and Ben Chifley In the war years, we have developed a<br />
national economy. </p>
<p>We're 18 million people, we're in a continent, we share a border with nobody,<br />
there is no line of distinction amongst them other than some phoney colonial<br />
lines drawn on a map one hundred odd years ago we are a nation at one.<br />
We are one nation.<br />
There should be basically one national economy. One national Government<br />
running the national economy. One national income tax system. But they say<br />
the problem about that is that the progressive agenda is advanced by Federal<br />
Labor Governments who win office because if they have a national economy and<br />
a bag full of national powers, they will advance the progressive agenda which<br />
is, of course, contrary to the conservative agenda.<br />
So they say the way to stop a Labor Government, federally, doing this is we split<br />
the power back to the States so we give them income taxes and we give them<br />
consumption taxes. We can't do a consumption tax. Every time we put our<br />
head up, we get beaten on that. So we will give the States the right to put a<br />
consumption tax and we will then have six State little economies. So when a<br />
Federal Labor Government comes along in the future, they won't have the<br />
powers they have had in the past to do things like universal health insurance or<br />
the external affairs power for the environment, or any of the other great<br />
redistributive things Labor Governments do. We won't be able to have an<br />
Accord with the trade unions. We won't have wage/ tax trade-offs. We won't<br />
have award superannuation. We will split the power back.<br />
Here we are this week and Costello brazenly is up their saying " we will do<br />
something about Vertical Fiscal Imbalance In our first year of office. 0 The<br />
moment I put a statement out saying notice this, he says ' lars'. And we say well<br />
hang on, here is your quotations. He said " oh, what I meant was only giving<br />
them a fixed share of Commonwealth income.'<br />
But a fixed share of Commonwealth income is still Commonwealth income.<br />
It doesn't touch the Vertical Fiscal Imbalance and it Is that, he sa~ d, he will repair.<br />
He then says he has talked to the States and surprise, surprise or really no<br />
surprise Jeff Kennett comes out this week and says ' the Commonwealth<br />
should have 20 per cent of the tax and the States should have 80 per cent'.<br />
And then he says ' the Commonwealth should have just some core functions<br />
defence, and the currency, and a couple of other things, and that is it". In other<br />
words, the powers should be back with the States and so should the money,<br />
But we say, well hang on Jeffrey you have got the powers now and what are you<br />
doing, you are closing schools, you are closing hospitals. You want the powers<br />
but then you don't want them. You want the power to take the power away and<br />
then you want the income tax. </p>
<p>Now Peter Costello has said he consulted the conservative States and he did<br />
and he consulted Jeff Kennett, and he consulted Ray Groom, and he has<br />
consulted Dean Brown etc and they agree with him. They want a State income<br />
tax. But the moment we say, by your own words, here it is, they say " lie".<br />
Now I don't know whether they expect the media to just repeat their rebuttals.<br />
But gradually, you know, these things are coming into the public debate and you<br />
see what their real agenda is and it is the same old agenda, isn't it? Income tax<br />
powers for the States, a State consumption tax. And, yesterday, we found that<br />
Access Economics is putting together a study on a State consumption tax for the<br />
conservative States.<br />
A State income tax, State consumption taxes, an industrial relations system that<br />
goes back to individual contracts and no award protections and declines in<br />
wages, private health insurance and support for specialists in private hospitals.<br />
And yet John Howard thinks he is going to get away with repainting himself as<br />
some sort of new-age person who is going to trick the rest of you into believing<br />
that at 55 he has eschewed all the views he has ever had and he is a changed<br />
person. He has had the Paulian conversion on the way to the ballot box.<br />
Well I will just tell you this, There is another -Box Hill coming up for<br />
John Howard. Now he won't have his policy launch here because this is the site<br />
of a Little Big H-orn for him. He won't have another one here, But there is<br />
another Box Hill coming for him and it is coming for him because, for this simple<br />
reason, that he wants to change the community values of Australia. He wants to<br />
change the sort of society we are.<br />
And you saw his defence speech two weeks ago, where he was saying nwe want<br />
security from Asia, not in Asia". I mean indirectly he said, " the region has an<br />
opportunity but at the same time it Is a threat and we really should be cuddling<br />
up to the United Statesu.<br />
You know, it is the same old view. They want to change the society. They want<br />
to change the culture. They want to take one of the fairest and most decent<br />
societies we have developed here and break it and smash it up. They have no<br />
faith in Australians and no belief In the nation as a whole. And that is the thing<br />
I have always held such objection to the Liberals about.<br />
At their core, they don't have the faith in the Australian people. They don't think<br />
we are capable of better things together. They don't believe that there is<br />
goodness in people, that they will do things for their own good spiritedness and<br />
for the national good. They don't believe. Yet they want to govern Australia with<br />
some sort of miserable alien philosophy to the place, that you might have found<br />
in Victorian England In the last gasp of the 19th century, or in the middle of this<br />
century in Australia like Cold War warriors like Sir Robert Menzies you know, </p>
<p>who regard Asia as a problem, who could only see ourselves cuddling up at<br />
Whitehall or in Washington, who basically want to keep working people in their<br />
place.<br />
Well they are not going to be kept in their place. They are going to find out<br />
about him just like they found out about John Hewson.<br />
The difference between John Hewson to give him his credit he had the<br />
courage to say what he meant he would do. But this character, thinks he can<br />
slip and slide around it and not say it at all.<br />
So this is going to be a fight for Australia's values. This is going to be a<br />
referendum on ideas and ideals and in the big marketplace of those<br />
referendums, John Howard can't escape by having no policies and trying to<br />
camouflage himself.<br />
So I say to the people who have come here today, many of you believing in<br />
these things but particularly some of the industrial representation that is here<br />
today, from the nurses and the ambulance officers and others and just say that<br />
your plight is not falling on deaf ears, that we know what a battle it is, that we<br />
know about the miserable public accountancy of the Kennett's, and the<br />
Stockdale's, and the Howard's, and the Reith's, and the Costello's.<br />
But we won't have a bar of It and when we win the next Federal election and<br />
when we have got them on the grass for 16 years, we will then be in a position<br />
where most of these mares are so imbedded that even doing their worst, they<br />
will never unseat them. Now that Is what the battle is about.<br />
Now in this electorate of Chisholm, we have had a former Deputy Leader of the<br />
Coalition, Michael Wooldridge. Basically he was unknown until he made a few<br />
outrageous remarks about Carmen Lawrence a couple of weeks ago. He does<br />
nothing here. Nobody I have ever spoken to from this electorate knows him or<br />
can remember anything that he has actually done for the community.<br />
Now this is not true of Labor people. We are always of the community. We<br />
believe in the community. We come from the community. That Is what<br />
Tony Robinson will do. He is from the community. He will represent the<br />
community, as Helen Mayer before him, for Labor. And you can't run an<br />
up-beat, up-lifting society with people in the parliamentary parties who don't<br />
believe in things, who don't really represent people, who don't feel the<br />
community views coming through and who try and advance the commonweal<br />
with that belief and faith In Australia and Australians.<br />
Now all of that, I believe, is certainly part and parcel of Tony Robinson's<br />
character and make-up. He will make a first class Member for Chisholm and he </p>
<p>will help put a Labor Government back there in Canberra because this is one of<br />
the seats we have to win.<br />
So we are not here just beating our gums. We are here about real and genuine<br />
things, about values and ideals that matter and about the shape of Australia as<br />
we approach this exciting period. Never have we been set up like this before.<br />
18 million of us in a continent without a border with anybody, with a chance of<br />
having an environment second to none, in the fastest growing part of the world<br />
the Asia Pacific while we are making our settlement of our participation in the<br />
region. I mean what an exciting prospect and a fair country that has got good values.<br />
I mean to turn all that back now and go back as John Howard said he wants to<br />
do, to go back to the values of the mono-culture, to regard Asia as some alien<br />
place and to start fracturing up Australia Into States, and dividing our community<br />
this is not the way forward for Australia. And the Labor Party, as always, will<br />
fight the good fight for good values, for good ideals and for good things and<br />
I know you will help us do it.<br />
Thank you very much for having me.<br />
ends. </p>
