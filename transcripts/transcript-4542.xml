FOR PRESS13 NOVEMBER 1977<br />
QUEENSLAND STATE ELECTIONS<br />
The Queensland Government, under the leadership of Mr. Joh<br />
Bjelke-Petersen, is to be congratulated on winning with a<br />
substantial majority its eighth consecutive election.<br />
It is relevant to note that the total coalition vote seems<br />
to be in the vicinity ot-52 per cent.<br />
The Labor Party defeat in 1974 was particularly devastating<br />
with only 36 per cent of the vote. Apart from that occasion,<br />
this appears to be the most overwhelming victory the<br />
coalition parties have had, with a total vote of 52 per cent. </p>
