PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MR JOHN GORTON ON ARRIVAL HOME AT MASCOT<br />
AIRPORT 2ND JUNE 1968<br />
PRIME MINISTER : Good morning to you all. Well, we have just done 24<br />
hours of flying, so I don't feel particularly in the mood for a very lengthy<br />
session, but in this room before I left, I said I hoped on the journey I would<br />
have the opportunity to form better impressions of American attitudes towards<br />
Asia and of the attitudes of the various candidates for the Presidency.<br />
I think I have been given the opportunity to do that, and I think it has been<br />
valuable. I haxe had, of course, many meetings with President Johnson, who<br />
is going to be in control of matters until January next year. I had quite -a<br />
long talk with Vice President Humphrey, the Democratic candidate whom<br />
people in the United States appear to give an edge to for nomination at the<br />
moment I wouldn't know. I had about an hour with Governor Rockefeller,<br />
one of the Republican candidates. I was unable to see Mr Nixon, but I did<br />
have quite a long telephone conversation with him. I saw the Secretary for<br />
Defence, and the Acting Secretary of the State Department ( because Mr Rusk<br />
was ill), and the Secretary of the Treasury, I had good opportunities to<br />
talk to leading members of the business community in New York. For these<br />
reasons, I believe that the trip was valuable, and in discussing it with my<br />
own colleagues, I will be happier in my own mind about any decis , ions we<br />
may come to regarding our own actions. I think that is all I wanted to say.<br />
If you have one or two questions you would like to ask, fire ahead.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, can you say whether your discussions with<br />
the candidates and President Johnson in any way indicate a firm attitude<br />
on America's part to remain in Asia after 1971?<br />
PM: Well, when I arrived and was received by President Johnson<br />
in the morning, I made a speech at the White House, indicating our wish that<br />
the United States should maintain an interest in Asia. That night at the<br />
W,-hite House Dinner, he gave unequivocal assurances as far as he was<br />
concerned that that interest would be maintained unequivocal assurance<br />
in language whicha is open for you to read. This, of course, as he pointed<br />
out, has validity, specific validity as far as he is concerned only until<br />
January next year, but he is going to be significant in the Democratic<br />
Party even after that.<br />
Q. And the candidates?<br />
PM: The candidates appeared to m-e to support the attitude expressed<br />
by the President.<br />
Q. When you say " appeared" to you to support this attitude, they<br />
w'CI~ i11 t anyv iore defi ni te rhan j Lst appearing to. support it? ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
PM: Well, they were private conversations with each candidate,<br />
and I don't think I ought to go into details of it but just say 1 came<br />
away with the firm impression that they did go along with maintaining<br />
an interest in Asia.<br />
Q. You don't feel uneasy then<br />
PM: No.<br />
Q. of the likely policy under a new President?<br />
PM: Of those candidates to whom I spoke, I don't feel uneasy.<br />
Q. What sort of bearing do you think your discussions will have<br />
on the Five Power talks beginning this week?<br />
PM: Well, the Five Power talks are talks between Great Britain<br />
Australia, New Zealand, Malaya and Singapore concerning the Malaya/<br />
Singapore area, and I don't know that my conversations would necessarily<br />
have a direct bearing on the outcome of those talks.<br />
Q. Nor on what contribution we might make<br />
PM: Well, you are getting a bit close to the conversations.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, were you able to gauge how the Viet Nam<br />
peace talks were going?<br />
PM: Yes; I had the opportunity during a breakfast session with<br />
President Johnson and a number of members of his Cabinet to receive a<br />
briefing from Mr Vance who had come back from Paris from the peace<br />
talks. I can only say that the briefing indicated that very little progress,<br />
if any, had so far been made, but the talks were continuing.<br />
Q. Did he indicate any optimism, or of<br />
PM: He indicated hope.<br />
Q: In what way, Sir?<br />
PM: Well, the talks were still going on. That is about it.<br />
Q. Could you say, Sir, how your talks on trade went?<br />
PM: Only that we re-expressed our hopes that quota systems<br />
wouldn't be imposed on products that we particularly wished to sell<br />
there such as meat and other products of that kind. If people want to<br />
put tariffs on, that is one thing. We put tariffs on ourselves.<br />
After all, this is a matter for their legislature, not for their executive.<br />
Q. Anything on the wool tariff, Sir?<br />
PM: Only a discussion expressing hope that something might<br />
be done about it. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Q. Mr Prime Minister, in your absence, there has been speculation<br />
about the defence relationship between the two countries. Did you<br />
get the impression in the United States that they wanted us to indicate<br />
our intention of firmness in staying in South-East Asia before they<br />
committed themselver,; and were they willing to commit themselves<br />
regardless?<br />
PM: I think they would be prepared as a world power to<br />
maintain their interest in Asia but they would be happy for assistance<br />
provided to them as they are happy for assistance provided in Viet<br />
Nam.<br />
Q. They didn't lay it on the line<br />
PM: Nobody was twisting anybody's arm.<br />
Q. You weren't twisting their arm by any chance?<br />
PM: I'm not in a position to. I'm not big enough.'<br />
Q. Will you be making a statement to Parliament, Sir?<br />
PM: Well, I will consider it and discuss it with my colleagues<br />
whether a statement should be made to Parliament or not. These<br />
were very largely private conversations, other than the ones that were<br />
on public record speeches by myself or by the President. It is a<br />
little difficult for me at this stage to work out what value a statement<br />
might be to Parliament, but if there appears to be value in information<br />
which Parliament should have, then I would seek to give that to<br />
Parliament.<br />
Q. Mr Gorton, regarding your statement about the Israeli-type<br />
army for Australia. Mr Eggleton made a remark about it being the<br />
" last resort". Would you care to amplify that at all?<br />
PM: I have no idea concerning Mr Eggleton, but on the matter<br />
you raise, they asked me a question concerning Australian defence,<br />
and they brought in this matter of an Israeli-type army. I sought<br />
to def ine what an Israeli-type army in the Austraian context could be<br />
considered to be which is a regular army allied to a citizen military<br />
force. One hopes, as Australia grows that a citizen military force<br />
would'build up and be better equipped and so on. This, of course, is<br />
existing policy; there is nothing whatsoever new in that at all. This is<br />
what we have been seekling to do for some time. As to the programme<br />
of achieving this, nothing at all was said, nor will anything be said<br />
until such timie as we k-now what resources are available for defence<br />
as a whole, for the Arnig.,+, 1, whole, and for allocation between the<br />
various kinds of regular/ citizen military forces and so on. At that<br />
stage, of course, the first statement will be made to the Parliament.<br />
Q. Did you take the opportunity, Sir, of informing yourself<br />
per sonally on the F IllI?<br />
PM: No. The Air Force have a team of experts over there,<br />
and I think they would probably be better able to do this than I could. ./ 4 </p>
<p>a I. -4<br />
Q. Sir, during your absence there have been certain allegations<br />
made about tapping of Parliamentarians' telephones. I bring this up<br />
because in August last year, the late Mr H-olt said he had received an<br />
assurance from the Attorney that before any Parliamentarian' s telephone<br />
was tapped, the Prime Minister would be informed. Gould you say, Sir,<br />
whether any Parliamentarians' telephones have been tapped?<br />
PM: Not as far as I know.<br />
Q. This is in relation, in the case of one of them, to<br />
conscientious objectors and Viet Nam.<br />
PM: No matter what it is in relation to, not as far as I know.<br />
Q. In your absence, on this matter there has been a rumpus,<br />
as you no doubt know, about....<br />
PML: Well, I have been moving pretty fast. I haven't this in any<br />
depth. It has just sort of washed across me as I have been going, but<br />
go on,<br />
Q. Are you likely to enquire personally into the Simon Townsend<br />
affair, to give it that tag or will you leave it to the Minister concerned<br />
and the...<br />
PM: I think I would like to k1-now a bit more about whatever it is<br />
that went on while I was away, before I could answer that sort of question.<br />
I have really been on a split-second schedule for almost as long as<br />
I can remember, a split-second schedule dealing with the matters over<br />
there. Thank you. </p>
