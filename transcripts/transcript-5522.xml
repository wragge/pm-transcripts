PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 22 FEBRUARY, 1981<br />
BY-ELECTIONS McPHERSON, BOOTHBY, CURTIN,<br />
I congratulate Peter White, Steele Hall, and Allan Rocher on<br />
their election to the House of Representatives, and look<br />
fOrward to the contribution I know each of them can make to'<br />
the Parliamentary Liberal Party.<br />
The results are a clear demonstration of the continuing<br />
support in Australia for the Government's responsible approacha<br />
to national policy.<br />
I would like to thank all those members of the Liberal-Party<br />
who have worked so hard to win these three seats, particularly<br />
considering that the by-elections have occurred so soon after<br />
the general election last year.<br />
The fact that the Labor Party's share of tLie vote has been<br />
reduced in at least two of the seats is a remarkable achievement.-<br />
Voters in three States have once again decisively rejected the<br />
high tax, centralist policies of the Labor Party.<br />
They have also rejected those whc have rushed forward with<br />
ill-prepared and impractical schemes for change. The McPherson<br />
result is particularly pleasing in this regard. Voters have<br />
shown that they will not support the introduction of divisive<br />
tactics into Federal Coalition politics.<br />
The attempt of the State National Party in Queensland to<br />
undermine-coalition principles has been condemed by the people<br />
of McPherson in their vote.<br />
I hope that the National Party in Queensland now realises that<br />
there is no future in divisive politics. Its clumsy and<br />
divisive approach to the McPherson by-election has failed. It<br />
is important for the National Party in Queensland to learn the<br />
lesson of that failure.<br />
Let it take note when I say quite plainly that I will not at any<br />
time allow the Federal Coalition to be disrupted by such tactics.<br />
The voters have made their judgement.<br />
Australia is making tremendous progress under the Fraser/ Anthony<br />
coalition. The unity of that coalition has never been stronger<br />
and is the firmest security for Australia's prosperity and progress.<br />
