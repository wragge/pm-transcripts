<p>He has landed three enormous free trade agreements with Japan, South Korea and China.</p>
<p>In addition, he has secured agreement of the historic Trans Pacific Partnership, eliminating tariffs on 98 per cent of traded goods and creating better access for Australia’s innovative service industries in 11 leading economies, including the US, Japan and Canada.</p>
