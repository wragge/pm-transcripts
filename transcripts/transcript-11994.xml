    <content><![CDATA[<p>Subjects: Internet gambling; beer excise legislation; Minister Fahey.</p>
<p>E&amp;OE................................ </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] is that feasible?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I certainly hope so. There's too much gambling in this country. You can't roll back what's there but you can stop it spreading and that's the rationale behind what we're doing. It does have, when indulged in to excess, it has hugely damaging social and family consequences. There's no point in mincing words about that. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will it not push gamblers offshore though?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look we are interested in trying to limit the spread of gambling, thus limiting the social costs. And in the end a government's got to put its hand up and say this is where we stand. I ask the Labor Party and The Democrats and others in the Senate to back our measure. If they don't, well be it on their heads for allowing the further extension of gambling and the further damaging social consequences.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Another measure before the Senate is a, well will be before the Senate is the beer excise. Labor today flagging they won't, they will be moving amendments to bring it down to 1.9% ..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Labor wants to refund hundreds of millions of dollars to the breweries - that's a funny order of social priorities.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will it not though result in cheaper beer as well, by .</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No but what they're also talking about is refunding money to the breweries. I mean is that, is that the new social face of the Labor Party?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How are you going to get around it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Get around what?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The beer excise?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well just wait and see, the measure will, I expect go through the House of Representatives and then it will go to the Senate.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's a matter for the House.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And who are you talking to about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I keep my counsel on those things.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And Mr Howard have you spoken to John Fahey recently and how is he?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well John's had a serious operation. I have spoken to him and I've told him that all of his colleagues are looking forward to his return to work. I want him back as Finance Minister. He's been a very good Finance Minister and I wish him well. It's obviously a difficult time for him and the hopes and prayers of all of his colleagues are very much with him.</p>
