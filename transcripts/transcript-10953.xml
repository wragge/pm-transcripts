<p>Premier and ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you here.</p>
<p> This is the signing of the Central Highlands Regional Forest Agreement.</p>
<p> It is the second RFA signed in Victoria and the third in a series</p>
<p> - the two Victorian ones and one in Tasmania.</p>
<p>The best news out of this is that it's going to create 300 new</p>
<p> jobs. And that is a very important element of the Regional Forest</p>
<p> Agreement. It's a very balanced outcome. It represents yet another</p>
<p> putting aside of the phoney war between environmental concerns and</p>
<p> job creation and development. Conservation is important but so is</p>
<p> job creation.</p>
<p>And there's a funding package of $28 million for industry development.</p>
<p> It will provide a 20-year period of security for investment. There</p>
<p> is 116,000 hectares of additional reserves, which is an increase of</p>
<p> 64 per cent. And the RFA that we are signing in a moment meets all</p>
<p> of the required scientific criteria. And when added to the existing</p>
<p> reserves, almost half of the Central Highlands area will have been</p>
<p> reserved. So when you set that against the 300 jobs that has been</p>
<p> created, the 20-year security, $28 million investment, it's a</p>
<p> win-win situation and it's another example of the sensible, cooperative</p>
<p> approach that's being adopted to these issues which is of benefit</p>
<p> to Victoria and, most importantly, it creates new jobs for Australians</p>
<p> - 300 in this case - and also evinces a proper concern for the environment.</p>
<p> So I'm delighted to be here with the Premier today to sign it.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
