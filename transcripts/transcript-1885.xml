JOINT COMMUNIQUE 14 JUNE 1968<br />
General Suharto, President of the Republic of Indonesia, and the<br />
Rt. Hon. J. G. Gorton, Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia,<br />
completed their discussions today. The two leaders expressed their pleasure<br />
at the basic goodwill, friendship and good neighbour spirit between the two<br />
countries. They welcomed the continuing development of close and co-operative<br />
relations between the Governments of Indonesia and Australia, and the growth of<br />
contacts between their peoples in a wide variety of fields.<br />
The two leaders discussed the problems facing their respective<br />
countries and the objectives they each sought, and declared their interest in the<br />
stability and progress in Asia and the Pacific were prerequisites to world peace,<br />
and that developments in the region affected the vital interests of both countries.<br />
They agreed that their two countries should co-operate closely with each other<br />
for the attainment of these objectives. They also agreed that the leaders of the<br />
two countries should have frequent consultations concerning the problems of the<br />
area. Having reviewed at length the situation and prospects in South East<br />
Asia, they noted that the strengthening and consolidation of national independence<br />
and integrity was a foremost objective for the countries of the region. Along with<br />
this went a growing senseC of community among the nations of the region and a<br />
growing movement toward regional co-operation, embracing wide areas of<br />
national life. Regional co-operation was both an expression of national<br />
independence and a means of supporting that independence. They noted that an<br />
environment of economic, social and political stability in the region was essential<br />
for the carrying out of sound and constructive national programmes aimed at<br />
raising living standards and meeting the desire of people everywhere for a fuller<br />
life. In this connection the Prime Minister expressed his understanding and<br />
support for the purposes which lay behind the creation of the association of South<br />
East Asian nations. The President expressed his deep appreciation for Australia's<br />
active participation in the inter -governmental conferences on Indonesia and for<br />
Australia's greatly increased assistance in 1968/ 69. He hoped that, within the<br />
framework of economic co-operation, endeavours would be made to increase<br />
further trade between the two countries. The Prime Minister confirmed<br />
Australia's strong interest in Indonesia's economic recovery. He stated that<br />
Australia was prepared to continue its co-operation with Indonesia, to extend<br />
what assistance it could, and to explore the possibilities of increasing tr~ ade<br />
between the two countries.<br />
The two leaders noted and welcomed the growing variety of<br />
cultural contacts between their countries. With a view to stimulating the<br />
further growth of these exchanges and to establishing a deeper understanding of<br />
the history and culture of their respective peoples, a cultural agreement covering<br />
a wide range of activities in this field has today been signed by Mr. Adam Malik,<br />
Foreign Minister of the Republic of Indonesia, and Mr. Max Loveday, Australian<br />
Ambassador to Indonesia. The President and the Prime Minister welcomed the<br />
opportunity provided by the visit to establish personal contact which they agreed<br />
to maintain and strengthen in the future. In this connection the Prime Minister<br />
extended a cordial invitation to t he President and Mrs. Suharto to visit Australia<br />
at a mutually convenient time. The President accepted the invitation with thanks.<br />
The Prime Minister expressed his deep appreciation for the warm and cordial<br />
