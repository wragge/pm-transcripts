For Media May 29 1983<br />
The Government of course would have liked to have won the<br />
Bruce by-election.<br />
However the Australian Labor Party has never won tne seat<br />
since its creation in 1955.<br />
A number of other factors including the-lack of aniy measurable<br />
personal vote for Sir Billy Snedden the Liberal candidate<br />
holdirng first place on the ballot paper and the tradit-ional<br />
anti-Governmenit swing in by-elections combined to influence the<br />
resul-t.<br />
Some comument has been made on the impact of the Economic<br />
Statement brought down by the Treasurer on May 19.<br />
It should be not. ed that the Statement was framed on the basis<br />
that Australia needs a Government prepared , where necessary,<br />
to take hard decisions.<br />
if the short-term impact of the Statement , which has been<br />
widely acclaimed as responsible and necessary i . s some<br />
political unpopularity then the Government will have to accept<br />
that. But as I said at the opening of the Bruce by-election campaign<br />
it would have been very simple for the Government to hold off<br />
on the Statement in the hope of securing some political<br />
advantage. The interests of Australia and particularl-y the many thousands<br />
without jobs would not have been best served by such a cynical<br />
approach. Finally I would like to pay tribute to the hard work and<br />
commitment of the ALP candidate , Heather O'Connor , and the<br />
campaign team. </p>
