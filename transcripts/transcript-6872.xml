PRIME MiNSTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EM1BARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIA -JAPAN RELATIONS SYMPOSIUM<br />
MARCH 1986 MELBOURNE<br />
I AM DELIGHTED TO RETURN TO ADDRESS THE AUSTRALIA-JAPAN<br />
SYMPOSIUM AND TO WELCOME THE VERY DISTINGUISHED VISITORS<br />
FROM JAPAN WHO ARE HERE AS PARTICIPANTS. IN PARTICULAR, I<br />
WELCOME MR OKAWARA BACK TO AUSTRALIA. AS JAPANESE<br />
AMBASSADOR TO AUSTRALIA SOME YEARS AGO, HE MADE MANY FRIENDS<br />
FOR JAPAN AND WAS A MOST EMINENT ENVOY.<br />
TWO YEARS AGO I HAD THE PLEASURE OF ADDRESSING YOUR CANBERRA<br />
SYMPOSIUM. ON4 THAT OCCASION I REPORTED, AMONG OTHER THINGS,<br />
ON MY FIRST TRIP TO JAPAN AS PRIME MINISTER. ON THIS<br />
OCCASION, I AM ADDRESSING YOU PRIOR TO MY SECOND TRIP TO<br />
JAPAN IN MIAY. IN 1985 PRIME MINISTER NAKASONE VISITED<br />
AUSTRALIA. THESE VISITS AT THE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT LEVEL<br />
DEMONSTRATE CLEARLY THAT THE AUSTRALIA-JAPAN RELATIONSHIP IS<br />
OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE TO BOTH OUR COUNTRIES.<br />
IN 1984 I SAID THATr OUR RELATIONSHIP WAS AN EVOLVING ONE,<br />
POISED TO MOVE IN NEW DIRECTIONS. NOW, I AM1 ABLE TO REPORT<br />
THAT THIS HAS IN FACT OCCURRED.<br />
DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE BUILT UPON THE<br />
COMPLEMENTARITIES AND THE INTER-DEPENDENCE OF OUR RESPECTIVE<br />
ECONOMIES. NEW AND BENEFICIAL TRADING OPPORTUNITIES HAVE<br />
BEEN FORGED OVER AND ABOVE OUR EXTENSIVE TRADITIONAL TRADE<br />
IN RAW MATERIALS.<br />
THE BASIS OF THE ~ EW TRADING OPPORTUNITIES HAS BEEN THE<br />
DEVELOPMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL FINANCE. A MAJOR POLICY<br />
INITIATIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN THE FURTHER<br />
LIBERALIZATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL MARKET AND, IN<br />
PARTICULAR, THE GRANTING IN 1985 OF 16 NEW FOREIGN BANK<br />
LICENCES, OF WHICH 3 WENT TO JAPANESE BANKS. SIMILAR<br />
LIBERALIZATION OF JAPANESE FINANCIAL MARKETS HAS INCLUDED<br />
THE NEGOTIATION OF RECIPROCAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE 4 MAJOR<br />
AUSTRALIAN BANKS TO ESTABLISH IN JAPAN. </p>
<p>GIVEN THAT JAPAN HAS BECO14E THE WORLD'S LARGEST NET EXPORTER<br />
OF CAP'ITAL AND AUSTRALIA'S LARGEST SOURCE OF FOREIGN FUNDS,<br />
THESE FINANCIAL INNOVATIONS SHOULD FURTHER FACILITATE THE<br />
EFFICIENT CHANNELLING OF THESE FUNDS INTO BOTH THE EQUITY<br />
AND SECURITY MARKETS IN AUSTRALIA. THESE RECIPROCAL<br />
ARRANGEMENTS WILL IMPROVE AUSTRALIAN UNDERSTANDING OF THE<br />
FUNCTIONING OF THE JAPANESE DOMESTIC MARKET, ENHANCING<br />
OPPORTUNITIES IN JAPAN FOR AUSTRALIAN EXPORTERS. THIS WILL<br />
BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AT A TIME OF EXPANDING JAPANESE<br />
DOMESTIC DEMAND FOL; LOWING THE DRAMATIC FALL IN OIL PRICES.<br />
AGAIN, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DIVERSIFY OUR EXPORTS TO JAPAN<br />
BY INCREASING THE CON4TRIBUTION OF MANUFACTURES AND SERVICES.<br />
INDEED AUSTRALIA IS WELL PLACED TO EXPAND OUR SHARE OF TRADE<br />
IN THESE ITEMS TO JAPAN. REAL UNIT LABOUR COSTS HAVE FALLEN<br />
IN AUSTRALIA BY ABOUT 2 PER CENT IN EACH OF 1983-84 AND<br />
1984-85 AND WE ARE EXPECTING A FURTHER FALL OF THAT ORDER IN<br />
THE CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR. THIS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN THE<br />
CONTEXT OF A SHARP REDUCTION IN INDUSTRIAL DISPUTATION.<br />
ALLOWING ALSO FOR THE 25 PER tENT DEPRECIATION OF THE $ A<br />
SINCE EARLY 1985 AGAINST THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF OUR TRADING<br />
PARTNERS, THIS HAS PUT AUSTRALIAN ENTERPRISES IN THEIR BEST<br />
COMPETITIVE POSITION FOR A DECADE AND A HALF. JAPAN, I.<br />
BELIEVE, CAN LOOK TO AUSTRALIA BOTH NOW AND IN THE FUTURE AS<br />
ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST RELIABLE AND EFFICIENT TRADING<br />
PARTNERS.<br />
AND ON THE JAPANESE SIDE, THE PROGRAM OF MARKET OPENING<br />
MEASURES INITIALLY ANNOUNCED BY PRIME MINISTER NAKASONE LAST<br />
APRIL IS WELCOME AS A SERIOUS EFFORT TO IMPROVE ACCESS FOR<br />
FOREIGN GOODS. WHILE THE MEASURES SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO<br />
STRENGTHENING THE WORLD TRADING SYSTEM IN THE FACE OF A<br />
MOUNTING PROTECTIONIST TREND, WE HOPE AND EXPECT THAT THEY<br />
WILL ALSO ASSIST THE DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR EXPORTS.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS ACTIVELY PROMOTING<br />
DIVERSIFICATION THROUGH THE PROCESS OF RESTRUCTURING OUR<br />
DOMESTIC INDUSTRY AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A JAPAN MARKET<br />
STRATEGY. AUSTRALIAN AND JAPANESE COMMITTEES ARE<br />
IDENTIFYING AREAS IN WHICH INDUSTRIAL CO-OPERATION CAN BE<br />
EXPANDED BETWIEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. IN THESE DELIBERATIONS<br />
AN EMPHASIS IS BEING PLACED ON AREAS WITH THE GREATEST<br />
EXPORT POTENTIAL FOR AUSTRALIA.<br />
NOTWITHSTANDING THESE DEVELOPMENTS, THE GOVERNMENT<br />
RECOGNISES THAT IT IS VITAL FOR AUSTRALIA TO M4AINTAIN OUR<br />
POSITION AS A COMPETITLV1E, RELIABLE SUPPLIER OF TRADITIONAL<br />
PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO THE JAPANESE MARKET. IN THIS REGARD WE<br />
VALUE THE ASSURANCES OF THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT THAT<br />
PURCHASES OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS WHETHER THEY BE COAL, BEEF<br />
OR OTHER COMMODITIES WILL BE MADE ON A STRICTLY COMMERCIAL<br />
BASIS AND NOT IN RESPONSE TO THIRD COUNTRY BILATERAL<br />
PRESSURES.<br />
ONE OF THE MATTERS I ESPECIALLY WISH TO TALK ABOUT ON MY<br />
VISIT TO JAPAN AND, BEFORE THAT, IN THE UNITED STATES AND<br />
EUROPE IS THE REGIME FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN AGRICULTURAL<br />
PRODUCTS. </p>
<p>UNFORTUNATELY, AGRICULTURE HAS ALWAYS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE<br />
VARIOUS POST-WAR TRADE LIBERALIZATION ROUNDS. FURTHERMORE,<br />
THE GATT RULES ON AGRICULTURE ARE FAR LESS DISCIPLINED ON<br />
THE USE OF SUBSIDIES, ESPECIALLY EXPORT SUBSIDIES, THAN THE<br />
RULES FOR WORLD TRADE IN MANUFACTURES.<br />
IT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION THAT IF AGRICULTURAL TRADE<br />
IS TO BE PLACED ON A SOUND ECONOMIC FOOTING, IT IS., ESSENTIAL<br />
FOR PROGRESS TO BE MADE FIRSTLY ON THIS CENTRAL ISSUE OF<br />
SUBSIDIES IN THE UPCOMING NEW ROUND OF MULTILATERAL TRADE<br />
NEGOTIATIONS. THIS IS NOT AN ACADEMIC MATTER. IT HAS A<br />
DIRECT BEARING ON AGRICULTURAL PRICES AND PROFITABILITY FOR<br />
ALL EFFICIENT PRODUCERS. AND AUSTRALIANi FARMERS ARE AMONG<br />
THE 1MOST EFFICIENT PRODUCERS IN THE WORLD.<br />
GATT RULES ON AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES THEREFORE NEED<br />
SIGNIFICAN4T CHANGES. AUSTRALIA IS STRONGLY OF THE VIEW THAT<br />
A SOLUTION NEEDS TO COMPREHEND A PHASE OUT OF AGRICULTURAL<br />
EXPORT SUBSIDIES OVER AN APPROPRIATE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD TO<br />
BRING THEIR TREATMENT IN LIN~ E WITH THAT APPLICABLE TO<br />
MANUFACTURES TRADE. THIS SHOULD BE COMBINED WITH A<br />
STRENGTHENING OF THE RULES ON OTHER SUBSIDIES, SUCH AS<br />
PRODUCTION SUBSIDIES, TO REQUIRE A COUNTRY USING THEM TO<br />
REMOVE OR REDUCE THEM IF THEY DAMAGE THE TRADING INTEREST OF<br />
OTHERS.<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS CONSISTENTLY ARGUED OVER THE YEARS THAT<br />
ILLEGAL TRADING PRACTICES VOLUNTARY RESTRAINT<br />
ARRANGEMENTS, ORDERLY MARKETING AGREEMENTS, IMPORT<br />
LICENSING, SUBSIDIES AND THE LIKE ARE CAUSING FUNDAMENTAL<br />
DAMAGE AND UNDERMINE THE MULTILATERAL TRADING SYSTEM AND THE<br />
CREDIBILITY OF THE GATT AS A CHIEF REGULATORY BODY OF THAT<br />
SYSTEM. WE WERE THEREFORE ONE OF THE FIRST COUNTRIES TO<br />
WELCOME AND SUPPORT THE LAUNCHING OF A NEW ROUND OF MTNS<br />
PROVIDING THEIR PRIMARY FOCUS WAS ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS AT<br />
THE ROOT OF CURRENT TRADE DISPUTES NAMELY NON-TARIFF<br />
BARRIERS AND SUBSIDIES, PARTICULARLY AGRICULTURAL EXPORT<br />
SUBSIDIES.<br />
WELL OVER ONE HALF OF WORLD TRADE IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS<br />
IS DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES, CREDITS AND SPECIAL<br />
ARRANGEMENTS. FROM AN AUSTRALIAN PERSPECTIVE, THE CHIEF<br />
PRIORITY FOR THE NEW ROUND IS TO PLACE AGRICULTURAL TRADE ON<br />
A FAIRER, MORE MARKET-ORIENTED BASIS BY BRINGING THE<br />
INTERNATIONAL RULES ON AGRICULTURAL TRADE INTO LINE WITH THE<br />
RULES ON TRADE MANUFACTURERS.<br />
I SUGGESTED IN BANGKOK IN NOVEMBER 1983 THAT COUNTRIES IN<br />
THE WESTERN PACIFIC REGION AND JAPAN OBVIOUSLY IS CENTRAL<br />
IN THIS CONNECTION MIGHT ADOPT A CO-OPERATIVE AND MUTUALLY<br />
SUPPORTIVE APPROACH TO WORKING TOWARD IMPROVEMENTS IN THE<br />
MULTILATERAL TRADING SYSTEM. </p>
<p>4.<br />
PROGRESS IN THE REGIONAL CONSULTATIONS WHICH HAVE FOLLOWED<br />
THIS SUGGESTION HAS BEEN MOST PLEASING. AT THIS KEY STAGE<br />
IN THE PREPARATORY PROCESS TOWARDS A NEW ROUND WE SEE VALUE<br />
IN THESE CONSULTATIONS BEING MAINTAINED AND STRENGTHENED.<br />
AND WE ARE DETERMIN4ED TO ENSURE THAT THE NEW ROUND ADDRESSES<br />
ISSUES WHICH ARE I1MPORTANT TO THE SMALLER TRADING COUNTRIES<br />
IN THE REGION.<br />
IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CO-OPERATION IN REGIONAL TRADE<br />
MATTERS, THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN KEEN TO TAKE<br />
EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP CLOSE CO-OPERATIVE ARRANGEMENTS<br />
WITH OUR PACIFIC NEIGHBOURS. WE WELCOME', FOR EXAMPLE, THE<br />
CO-OPERATIVE RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED IN THE BUSINESS<br />
SPHERE THROUGH ORGAN'ISATIONS LIKE THE PACIFIC BASIN ECONOMIC<br />
COUNCIL AND IN THE RESEARCH PROGRA14S OF THE PACIFIC TRADE<br />
AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE.<br />
WE ARE ALSO PLEASED WITH THE WAY IN WHICH THE PACIFIC<br />
ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION CONFERENCE ( PECC) HAS BEEN ABLE TO<br />
DRAW TOGETHER BUSINESS LEADERS, ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS AND<br />
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN EXPLORING AVENUES' FOR GREATER<br />
ECONOMIC COOPERATION. A NUMBER OF JAPANESE LEADERS IN THESE<br />
FIELDS HAVE MADE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS THIS PROCESS<br />
WHICH BEGAN IN 1980.<br />
IN OUR POLITICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN, REGULAR FOREIGN<br />
POLICY CONSULTATION BETWEEN OUR NATIONS IS NOW FIRMLY<br />
ESTABLISHED. IN JUNE LAST YEAR BILL HAYDEN REFERRED IN<br />
TOKYO TO AUSTRALIA'S APPRECIATION OF THE EFFORTS JAPAN HAS<br />
CONTINUED TO MAKE TO ENSURE THIS CONSULTATION OCCURS. HE<br />
ALSO MENTIONED ( AND IN THE PRESENCE OF TWO0 DISTINGUISHED<br />
AMBASSADORS OF JAPAN, ONE PRESENT AND ONE PAST, I ENDORSE<br />
THIS) THE COMPLIMENT AUSTRALIA TAKES FROM THE SENIOR<br />
APPOINTMENTS WHICH ARE MADE HERE BY THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT.<br />
AS OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN HAS GROWN TO MATURITY, WE<br />
HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE VALUE OF REGULAR AND OPEN CONSULTATION.<br />
BEGINNING WITH THE AUSTRALIA-JAPAN MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE,<br />
WHICH MET FOR THE EIGHTH TIME IN 1985, WE HAVE BUILT UP A<br />
FRAMEWORK OF CONSULTATIONS WHICH HAS STOOD FIRM THROUGH<br />
POLITICAL CHANGES AND NEW ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES. WE HAVE<br />
BECOME ACCUSTOMED, AS PARTICIPANTS IN A MATURE RELATIONSHIP<br />
MUST, TO AIRING OUR DIFFERENCES FRANKLY AND SEEKING<br />
SOLUTIONS WHICH ALL CAN ACCEPT.<br />
AT AN OFFICIAL LEVEL, THE RANGE OF OUR CONSULTATIONS IS<br />
WIDENING: A HIGH-LEVEL MEETING ON TRADE IS BEING HELD THIS<br />
WEEK IN TOKYO, TO BE FOLLOWED SHORTLY AFTERWARDS BY THE<br />
EIGHTEENTH IN THE SERIES OF TALKS BETWEEN FOREIGN MINISTRY<br />
OFFICIALS. AT THIS YEAR'S MEETING, IN ADDITION TO SHARING<br />
VIEWS ON ISSUES OF BROAD INTERNATIONAL CONCERN, THE FOCUS OF<br />
ATTENTION WILL ALSO BE ON POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR<br />
REGION, ESPECIALLY IN THE PHILIPPINES. </p>
<p>AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN HAVE A SHARED INTEREST IN STAnILITY,<br />
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND DEMOCRACY IN THE PHILLIPINES. FOR<br />
OUR PART, WE HAVE INCREASED BY 50% OUR AID COMMITMENT TO THE<br />
PHILLIPINES, AS ANNOUNCED BY THE FOREIGN MINISTER, BILL<br />
HAYDEN, DURING HIS RECENT VISIT TO MANILA. WE HAVE ALSO<br />
INDICATED OUR WILLINGNESS TO CONTRIBUTE TO MULTILATERAL<br />
EFFORTS BY SYMPATHETIC DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TO ASSIST THE<br />
PHILLIPINES IN ITS CURRENT VERY DIFFICULT ECONOMIC<br />
SITUATION. JAPAN AND AUSTRALIA HAVE MUCH TO GAIN FROM THE PRESERVATION<br />
OF PEACE, WHETHER THROUGH THE AUSPICES' OF THE UNITED NATIONS<br />
OR THROUGH STRONG SUPPORT FOR DISARMAM~ ENT INITIATrIVES.<br />
LATER IN THE YEAR, JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIAN OFFICIALS WILL<br />
HOLD SPECIALISED CONSULTATIONS ON DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE AND<br />
DISARMAMENT RATTERS. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE OUTCOME OF THOSE<br />
DELIBERATIONS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN IS NOT JUST A<br />
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRADERS AND BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS.<br />
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO NATIONS HAS BROADENED AND<br />
DEEPENED INTO AREAS BEYOND THE ECONOMIC AND THE POLITICAL.<br />
OVER 3,000 YOUNG JAPANESE HAVE VISITED AUSTRALIA ON WORKING<br />
HOLIDAY VISAS: MANY AUSTRALIANS HAVE ENJOYED A MATCHING<br />
EXPERIENCE IN JAPAN. JAPANESE TOURISTS TO AUSTRALIA HAVE<br />
REACHED THE 100,000 MARK THIS YEAR, AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF<br />
RAPID GROWTH.<br />
OVER 20,000 AUSTRALIANS A YEAR ARE NOW STUDYING JAPANESE,<br />
AND SOME 19 TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS IN AUSTRALIA<br />
UNIVERSITIES, COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION AND THE LIKE<br />
NOW OFFER COURSES IN JAPANESE STUDIES.<br />
AUSTRALIAN ARTS FESTIVALS ARE INTRODUCING BOTH CONTEMPORARY<br />
AND TRADITIONAL JAPANESE CULTURE TO AUSTRALIAN AUDIENCES,<br />
AND THE SPONSORSHIP OF JAPANESE COMPANIES IN AUSTRALIA IS<br />
MAKING AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION4 TO THE EXHIBITIONS,<br />
CONCERTS AND PERFORMANCES WHICH ENRICH THE RELATIONSHIP IN A<br />
WAY THAT IS NO LESS VALUABLE FOR BEING INTANGIBLE.<br />
IN JAPAN, TOO, AUSTRALIA IS MAKING AN IMPACT AS A VIBRANT,<br />
YOUNG COUNTRY WHOSE TALENTED ARTISTS, MUSICIANS, DANCERS,<br />
FILM-MAKERS AND WRIT RS CAN COMPETE WITH ANY INTERNATIONAL<br />
COMPETITORS FOR A PLACE IN THE DYNAMIC JAPANESE ARTS SCENE.<br />
WE WERE PLEASED WITH THE RESPONSE IN OCTOBER LAST YEAR TO<br />
THE FIRST MAJOR EXHIBITION OF AUSTRALIAN 20TH CENTURY ART IN<br />
TOKYO, AND WE HOPE TO FOLLOW IT WITH OTHERS. AUSTRALIAN<br />
STUDIES ARE NOW TAUGHT IN SEVERAL UNIVERSITIES IN JAPAN, AND<br />
THE OPENING THIS YEAR OF THE FIRST FULLY FLEDGED AUSTRALIAN<br />
STUDIES CENTRE, AT NANZAN UNIVERSITY IN NAGOYA, IS A<br />
SIGNIFICANT MIL'ESTONE FOR US. </p>
<p>THERE IS, AS YOU KNOW, CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN JAPAN IN THE<br />
CULTURE AND TRADITIONS OF THE AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL PEOPLE,<br />
AND SCOPE EXISTS FOR WIDENING THE EXPOSURE IN JAPAN OF THIS<br />
RICH AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE.<br />
IN 1988, THE AUSTRALIAN BICENTENNIAL CELEBRATIONS WILL<br />
INVOLVE THE PEOPLE OF OUR TWO COUNTRIES IN MORE CONCENTRATED<br />
CONTACT THAN AT ANY PREVIOUS TIME.<br />
OUR BICENTENARY IN 1988 -IS ESSENTIALLY A DOMESTIC<br />
CELEBRATION, BUT SUCCESSIVE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALSO<br />
WANTED TO OFFER OTHER NATIONS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CELEBRATE<br />
WITH US. NO COUNTRY HAS RESPONDED WITHI GREATER ENTHUSIASM<br />
TO OUR INVITATION THAN JAPAN AND THAT GIVES ME AND, I AM<br />
SURE, ALL AUSTRALIANS GREAT PLEASURE.<br />
AT THE INSTIGATION OF FOREIGN MINISTER ABE, A MOST<br />
PRESTIGIOUS GROUP OF PRIVATE SECTOR INDIVIDUALS HAS COME<br />
TOGETHER INI TOKYO TO FORM THE JAPAN AUSTRALIA BICENTENNIAL<br />
COMMITTEE, UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF A GREAT FRIEND OF<br />
AUSTRALIA, MR EISHIRO SAITO, WHO IS ALSO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE<br />
JAPA?" AUSTRALIA BUSINESS COOPERATION COUNCIL AND THE<br />
CKLtIRMAN OF NIPPON STEEL.<br />
THAT COMMITTEE WILL BE PLANNING AND OVERSEEING THE MANY AND<br />
VARIED FORMS OF JAPANESE PARTICIPATION IN 1988. THEY ARE<br />
CONSIDERING, FOR EXAMPLE, OUR INVITATION TO BE ASSOCIATED<br />
WITH THE NATIONAL BICENTENNIAL SCIENCE CENTRE, AN IMPORTANT<br />
AND LASTING PROJECT FOR 1988.<br />
SUCH A PROJECT HAS A PARTICULAR APPROPRIATENESS FOR JAPAN,<br />
AS ONE OF THE MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED NATIONS IN THE<br />
WORLD. THERE WILL BE MAN\ Y OTHER FORMS OF JAPANESE PARTICIPATION,<br />
ESPECIALLY IN THE TALL SHIPS EVENT, IN EXPO' 88, AND IN THE<br />
ARTS AND ENTERTAINMNET PROGRAM. JAPANESE INVOLVEMENT HAS<br />
BEEN PROMOTED BY PRIME MINISTER NAKASONE'S GENEROUS OFFER,<br />
DURING HIS VISIT HERE LAST YEAR, OF A GIFT OF 3,000 CHERRY<br />
TREES. SOME OF THESE WILL BE USED AT THE SITE OF OUR NEW<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, THE OPENING OF WHICH WILL BE A CENTRAL<br />
EVENT OF 1988.<br />
WE LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING AND ENJOYING THE VARIED<br />
EXPERIENCES OF 1988 WITH JAPAN OFFICIALLY AND AT A POPULAR<br />
LEVEL, AND TO THE FURTHER STRENGTHENING OF OUR RELATIONSHIP<br />
WHICH THAT SPECIAL YEAkR WILL GENERATE.<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
SINCE THESE MEETINGS COMMENCED IN 1973 THEY HAVE GROWN AND<br />
DEVELOPED INTO A MOST IMPORTANT FORUM FOR THE EXPLORATION<br />
AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF CO-OPERATION IN A VARIETY OF<br />
ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND CULTURAL FIELDS.<br />
IT IS NOW MY PLEASURE TO DECLARE OPEN THE 14TH SYMPOSIUM AND<br />
I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING A REPORT ON YOUR DELIBERATIONS. </p>
