<p>General revenue assistance to local'government has<br />
increased from $ 80 million under the previous Labor<br />
Government to S140 million in 1976-77, $ 165 million in<br />
1977-78, W19.4 million in 1978-79 and 9221.74 million<br />
for 1979-80. As a result, local government will have<br />
received over$ 700 million in untied grants in the four<br />
years of the tax sharing arrangements.<br />
Mr Fife went on to say that the Government had increased<br />
the percentage allocation of personal income tax to local<br />
government for 1979-80 from 1.52% to 1.75%~ and maintained<br />
its commitment to increase the percentage to 2% by<br />
1980-81.<br />
In addition to the funds provided to the States, the<br />
Commonwealth has made provision, under the Memorandum<br />
of Understanding between the Commonwealth and the Northern<br />
Territory, for an amount of $ 1.062 million to be made<br />
available in 1979-80 to the Northern Territory Government<br />
for on-forwarding to the local government authorities in<br />
the Territory.<br />
The Commonwealth Government's tax sharing arrangements<br />
have thus provided a very substantial and rapidly growing<br />
source of funds to local government bodies throughou-,<br />
the country. Just as importantly, the funds are provided<br />
without strings giving local governments the freedom,<br />
and the responsibility, to determine their own expenditure<br />
priorities. Canberra </p>
