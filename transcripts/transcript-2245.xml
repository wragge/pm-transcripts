ECONOMIC CONSULTATIONS<br />
Statement by the Prime M nister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Invitations have been extended to representatives of national<br />
organisations to meet with Ministers in Canberra cn Thursday and Friday<br />
( 2 and 3 July). Mnisters will meet representative national organisations in<br />
three groups primary industry, manufacturing industry and commerce.<br />

Advisory Council, the Export Development Council and the Australian Council<br />
of Trade Unions will each have separate discussions with Ministers.<br />
I am sure that these talks, to be held before our Budget discussions,<br />
will be most useful in providing Ministers with the current vievws of those<br />
