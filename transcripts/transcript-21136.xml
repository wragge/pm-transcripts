    <content><![CDATA[<p>  I am pleased to announce that Prime Minister Helen Clark of New Zealand will arrive in  Australia on Tuesday 2 March 2004 for annual trans-Tasman prime ministers' talks.  The talks will be held in Canberra on Wednesday 3 March 2004.</p>
<p> Australia and New Zealand enjoy a special relationship based on common values and historic, economic and social ties.  This relationship will continue to grow in the years ahead and these annual talks indicate the importance that Miss Clark and I place on it.</p>
<p>Our two countries both enjoy a high level of engagement with our Pacific neighbours and a key part of our discussions will be to share perspectives on the region.  As usual we will also be discussing a range of other bilateral, regional and international issues, including trade.</p>
<p>The Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Ministers for Trade, Defence, Foreign Affairs, Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and Industry, Tourism and Resources will also participate.  </p>
