SPEAKING NOTES FOR THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
KANCHANABUR! WAR CEMfL. TERY<br />
4i CBPUARY 1989<br />
FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS, THE STORY OF' THE POWs WHO BUILt-THE<br />
BURMA RAi;. ROAD RANKS wiiTH GALLIPOLI, THE BATTLEFIELDS<br />
OF FRANCE AND TOBRUJK AS ONE OF TAfE MOST EVOCATT'F AND<br />
POWERFUL REMINDERS CF THE B1RAVERY AND THIE SACRIFICE OF<br />
AuSTRALIANS AT WAR.<br />
SO ! T IS WiTH HUJMl1. ITY AND A SENSE OF HONOUR THAT<br />
HAVE JUST LAID A WiREArH DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF<br />
THOSE WHO LIVED AND DIED BUILDING THE BURMA<br />
RAILROAD.<br />
THE DIMENSIONS OF AUSTRALIA'S LOSSES ON THIS INFAMOUS<br />
PROJECT ARE UNSPEAKABLY VAST.<br />
NEARLY TEN THOUSAND AUSTRPALIANS WFRE FORCED F0 WORK<br />
l E RE<br />
MORE THAN 2.500 DIED HERE FAR FROM THEIR HOMES<br />
AND FAMILIES. IN CONDITIONS oF APPALLING HARDSHIP<br />
AND, NOT INFREQUENTLY. CRUEL'TY. SUFFERING<br />
EXHAUSTION. DISEASE AND HUNGER. </p>
<p>SIDE BY SIDE WITH THEM WERE MORE THAN 50,000 PRISONERS<br />
FROM ALLIED NATIONS NEW ZEALANDERS, BRITONS,<br />
CANADIANS, DUTCH. AMERICANS OF WHOM NEARLY TEN<br />
THOUSAND DIED.<br />
CONSCRIPTED LOCAL WORKERS THAIS, BURMESE. MALAYS<br />
AND OTHERS SHARED THE WORK. AND THE SUFFERING.<br />
ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE SENSE OF DESPAIR FELT BY<br />
SERVICEMEN WHO. HAVING BEEN CAPTURED IN THE THEATRE OF<br />
WAR, HAD YET TO FACE THEIR SEVEREST TEST AS PRISONERS OF<br />
WAR. BUT IF THERE IS ANYTHING UPLIFTING ABOUT THIS<br />
EVIDENCE OF THE WASTE AND HORROR OF WAR IT IS THAT<br />
THESE PRISONERS. THESE AUSTRALIANS WITH THEIR<br />
RESILIENCE. THEIR COMRADESHIP AND THEIR COURAGE.<br />
ALSO MADE AN ENDURING REAFFIRMATION OF THE HUMAN<br />
SPIRIT.<br />
WE THINK OF SIR EDWARD DUNLOP ' WEARY' DUNLOP FOR HIS<br />
BRAVERY AND SELFLESS DEVOTION TO DUTY, OFTEN IN<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES OF EXTREME DURESS.<br />
THERE WERE ALSO THE THAI VILLAGERS. WHO RISKED THEIR<br />
LIVES TO SUPPLY FOOD AND MEDICINE. TO WHOM I PAY DEEPLY<br />
GRATEFUL TRIBUTE. </p>
<p>ONE. MR BOONPON, AT GREAT PERSONAL DANGER SUPPLIED<br />
THE MEAGRE WANTS OF THE PRISONERS.<br />
HIS NAME IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OF ' WEARY' DUNLOP.<br />
THE BRAVERY OF BOTH OF THOSE MEN IS REMEMBERED IN<br />
THE FELLOWSHIP ESTABLISHED IN THEIR NAMES WHICH<br />
FACILITATES POST GRADUATE SURGICAL STUDIES FOR THAI<br />
DOCTORS IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
AT THAT TIME OF SHARED HUMAN SUFFERING, FORTY-FIVE YEARS<br />
AGO, THAIS AND AUSTRALIANS WORKED TOGETHER TO CONFRONT A<br />
COMMON ADVERSARY.<br />
AUSTRALIANS AND THAIS STILL STAND SHOULDER TO<br />
SHOULDER.<br />
BUT NOW WE FACE THE CHALLENGES OF PEACE<br />
AND PROSPERITY. AND IT IS MY CONFIDENT BELIEF THAT<br />
THE FRIENDSHIP FORGED IN THE PAST BETWEEN OUR TWO<br />
PEOPLE AND OUR TWO COUNTRIES WILL STAND US IN GOOD<br />
STEAD FOR THE FUTURE. </p>
