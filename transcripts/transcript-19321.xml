<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard will visit Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, from 9 to 11 May 2013.</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea is Australia's nearest neighbour and one of our most important bilateral partners.</p>
<p>Our unique relationship is based on shared history, extensive business links, the deep friendship between our two peoples and close government ties.</p>
<p>In Port Moresby, the Prime Minister will meet Prime Minister Peter O'Neill and his Cabinet to discuss priority bilateral interests and cooperation on shared regional challenges.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard will also call on Papua New Guinea's Governor-General, Sir Michael Ogio GCMG CBE, and meet the Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable Belden Namah MP.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard will address the Papua New Guinea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, visit the $19 billion PNG LNG project and see first-hand how Australia's development assistance is delivering real benefits for Papua New Guineans.</p>
