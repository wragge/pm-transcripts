PAY-ROLL TAX EX1PORT INCENTIVE REBATES<br />
The Commonwealth Treasurer, the Rt. Hon. William McMahon,<br />
announced to-day that in the three months ended March last, pay-roll<br />
tax rebates totalling 3,016,000 had been allowed to 328 firms which,<br />
by increasing their export sales in 1965/ 66, had qualified for<br />
rebates. This brought the number of firms to which rebates had<br />
been allowed to date for 1965/ 66 exports to 738 and the value of<br />
rebates to -, 8,016,000. A further 361 claims for the 1965/ 66<br />
financial year, totalling %? 4,590,000, were currently being handled<br />
by the Taxation Office.<br />
Mr. Mc~ iahon said that, in adcition to rebates for 1965/ 66<br />
exports, the Taxation Office in the March quarter had allowed rebates<br />
totalling $ 1,641,000 for exports of prior years. To the end of<br />
March, 1,526 firms had been allowed rebates totalling $ 12,972,000<br />
for 1964/ 65 exports, 1,680 firms had been allowed rebates totalling<br />
$ 12,540,000 for 1963/ 64 exports and 1,588 firms had been allowed<br />
rebates totalling 8,999,000 for 1962/ 63 exports. Rebates<br />
totalling Z13,145,000 had been allowed for 1960/ 61 and 1961/ 62<br />
exports up to the end of March. Claims totalling ' 1,856,000 for<br />
1964/ 65 and earlier years were currently being handled by the<br />
Taxation Office. Pay-roll tax rebates are part of the taxation incentives<br />
for export introduced by the Government in 1961. Rebates are<br />
available to firms increasing their exports above the level of their<br />
average exports in the two years 1958/ 59 and 1959/ 60. If the value<br />
of a firm's exports increases by one per cent of its gross business<br />
income, the firm is entitled to a rebate of 12.5 per cent of its<br />
pay-roll tax liability. This ratio applies proportionately so that<br />
when the increase in exportE is equal to 8 per cent of the gross<br />
receipts of the firm's business, the firm is entitled to a full<br />
rebate of pay-roll tax.<br />
