PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO PARLIAMENT<br />
RESOLUTION ON THE ABORIGINAL AND<br />
TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER PEOPLE<br />
CANBERRA 23 AUGUST 1988<br />
Madam Speaker,<br />
I move, that this House<br />
acknowledges that:<br />
Australia was occupied by Aborigimes and Torres Strait<br />
Islanders who had settled for thousands of years before<br />
British settlement at Sydney cove on January 26, 1788;<br />
Aborigines and Torres-Strait Islanders suffered<br />
dispossession and dispersal upon acquisition of their<br />
traditional lands by the British Crown; and<br />
Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders were denied full<br />
citizenship rights of the Commonwealth of Australia prior to<br />
the 1967 Referendum.<br />
and affirms: the importance of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
culture and heritage; and<br />
the entitlement of Aborigines and Torres Strait<br />
Islanders to self-management and self-determination subject<br />
to the Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth of<br />
Australia; and considers it desirable that the Commonwealth further<br />
promote reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait-<br />
Islander citizens providing recognition of their special<br />
place in the Commonwealth of Australia.<br />
Madam Speaker,<br />
Yesterday we celebrated the opening of the Parliament's new<br />
and permanent home with ceremony and dignity, in a spirit of<br />
amity and with a renewed determination to fulfil our<br />
responsibilities to serve the people of Australia.<br />
Today the ceremonies are over and we are getting down to<br />
work. .1341~ 3 </p>
<p>2.<br />
But it is my belief that we cannot afford easily to put<br />
aside that constructive awareness of our national obligation<br />
which pervaded the opening of this building.<br />
It is with that in mind that I am moving this resolution and<br />
seeking for it the wholehearted support of the House.<br />
This motion is not another item of ceremony to be performed<br />
and then forgotten when-we get down to the real business of<br />
politics. This motion is our real business the beginnimg of our<br />
Parliamemtar~ duties in our new building.<br />
In our Bicentennial year, and at the outset of our first<br />
working day in this Chamber, a motion such as this could<br />
hardly be more appropriate.<br />
Because our mew beginnings in this building allow us to<br />
focus with fresh minds on the great question the great<br />
challenge posed by our celebration of 200 years of<br />
European settlement: the nation's relationship with its<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander citizens.<br />
At the start of our Bicentennial year, the Australian Heads<br />
of Churches issued a statement titled " Towards<br />
Reconciliation in Australian Society".<br />
The idea for this resolution originated with that statement<br />
and the precise words of the resolution have been suggested<br />
by the Churches.<br />
For this reason, and to prevent the injection of party<br />
politics into this resolution, I believe it should be voted<br />
on without amendment from either side of the House.<br />
The motion is in three parts.<br />
It begins by acknowledging as historical truths<br />
the prior occupation and settlement of Australia by the<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people;<br />
the dispossession and dispersal they suffered after<br />
1768; and<br />
the denial of full citizenship rights to them until<br />
1967.<br />
Whatever one's political views or social theories those are<br />
undeniable facts of the Australian story.<br />
But it is not sufficient merely to acknowledge those truths<br />
without drawing out their implications I believe their<br />
inevitable implications.<br />
13-11i' </p>
<p>Accordingly this motion goes on it its second part to affirm<br />
the importance of the Aboriginal culture and the entitlement<br />
of Aboriginal people to a substantial degree of<br />
self-management.<br />
The acknowledgement of these historical truths and the<br />
affirmation of these implications by this Parliament and<br />
preferably a unanimous acknowledgement and affirmation<br />
will go a long way towards their greater acceptance<br />
throughout the community.<br />
But it would still be inadequate to leave the issue at that<br />
point. We must add one logical step and draw one conclusion of<br />
ultimate significance.<br />
We must, if we are truly to fulfil our responsibilities as<br />
the elected representatives of the Australian people,<br />
express our utmost determination to promote reconciliation<br />
within our community.<br />
And we must do it today.<br />
We must, in the words of the third part of this motion,<br />
state the desirability of the Commonwealth further promoting<br />
reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
citizens, providing recognition of their special place in<br />
the Commonwealth of Australia.<br />
Madam Speaker,<br />
In the informal discussions which have taken place among<br />
members concerning this motion the view has sometimes been<br />
put that such a motion is purely symbolic and therefore of<br />
no importance or relevance to the Aboriginal and Islander<br />
people. I reject that view firmly.<br />
For many years Governments of both political affiliations<br />
have endeavoured to provide what could be termed physical or<br />
technical solutions to the needs of the Aboriginal and<br />
Islander people.<br />
They have provided special assistance to help them in<br />
education, housing, employment, health and other fields.<br />
But we recognise we must do more.<br />
For the education, housing, employment, and health standards<br />
of Aboriginal and Islander people still lag far behind those<br />
of the rest of the community.<br />
My Government is proud of its record in continuing and<br />
improving this flow of assistance. We will continue to do<br />
so as the Budget speech of the Treasurer will clearly<br />
indicate tonight. 1345 </p>
<p>Yet we also recognise that the true remedy does not lie<br />
purely in the allocation of resources.<br />
For if we provide budgetary assistance but not hope, not<br />
confidence, not effective consultation, not reconciliation,<br />
then that assistance will fail to lift Aboriginal and<br />
Islander people from their disadvantaged state.<br />
In the past, too many of those programs of assistance have<br />
been decided on by Governments without the informed<br />
involvement of the people they were designed to assist.<br />
Even more fundamentally, those physical remedies for the<br />
physical needs of the Aboriginal people have not been<br />
accompanied by proper recognition of their cultural<br />
tradition or of their legitimate place in Australian<br />
society. The proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
Commission will be one major step in the direction of<br />
self-determination and self-management for the Aboriginal<br />
and Islander citizens of this nation.<br />
At the same time, the Government is committed to a real and<br />
lasting reconciliation, achieved through full consultation<br />
and honest negotiation, between Aboriginal and<br />
non-Aboriginal citizens of this nation.<br />
This will be recognised by the Preamble to the Commission<br />
legislation. It will be recognised by the compact or treaty which we are<br />
committed to negotiating with Aboriginal and Islander<br />
people.<br />
And, Madam Speaker, it will be recognised by our support for<br />
this resolution.<br />
Without this overall approach, without a proper settlement<br />
and proper recognition, there can be no real and lasting<br />
improvement for the Aboriginal and Islander people.<br />
That is why this resolution is no mere symbolism or empty<br />
tokenism.<br />
Madam Speaker,<br />
This resolution will not be the first formal recognition of<br />
the special position of the Aboriginal and Islander people.<br />
In 1967 the people of Australia voted overwhelmingly in a<br />
referendum initiated by the Liberal-Country Party Government<br />
to give the Commonwealth the right to make special laws for<br />
Aboriginal people. Significantly, this referendum had the<br />
support of all major political parties.<br />
,1 4 Gt </p>
<p>In 1975, Senator Bonner's motion on " prior ownership" was<br />
debated by the Senate. That was Parliament's first formal<br />
step in setting the record straight and in pointing the way<br />
to reconciliation. Significantly again, it had bipartisan<br />
support.<br />
Today, Parliament must make a further statement. We must<br />
tell the. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that<br />
their feelings of dispossession generated by 200 years of<br />
mon-Aboriginal settlement are recognised, that their culture<br />
and heritage is valued, and that through self-management<br />
their need for a more empowered place in the nation's life<br />
is affirmed.<br />
And more than that, this resolution will tell all<br />
Australiams, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, that we are<br />
prepared to enter our third century of life together on this<br />
continent in a spirit of national reconciliation not<br />
collective national guilt, not shame, but with proof of our<br />
capacity to recognise past wrongs and to build on that<br />
recognition a shared future of understanding and goodwill.<br />
What is required by Government is the golitical will to<br />
follow through with these goals.<br />
In a recent article about the proposed treaty, " Nugget"<br />
Coombs said: " It's a politician's job to recognise when the<br />
will is there to do something: but they also have a<br />
responsibility to create that will."<br />
And on the spurious claim that such a path to reconciliation<br />
would create division in the community " Nugget" Coombs went<br />
on, " It's newer divisive to correct injustice. The fact of<br />
injustice is divisive and will continue to be until we<br />
correct it and learn to live with it. People who benefit<br />
from injustice will oppose this, but you don't stop working<br />
for justice simply because people around you don't like it."<br />
The Government is committed to correcting the injustices of<br />
the past. The political will is there, the support is<br />
there, as evidenced by this resolution from the Churches.<br />
The aim is that we will all move forward together in a<br />
happier, more just and unified society.<br />
I commend the Australian Heads of Churches' for their<br />
initiative in suggesting this important step on the road to<br />
reconciliation and I am pleased to see them represented in<br />
this Chamber today.<br />
Madam Speaker,<br />
In full recognition of the significance of this moment to<br />
Parliament and, not just to Parliament, but to all<br />
Australians, I now commend this resolution to the House. 13. 47 </p>
