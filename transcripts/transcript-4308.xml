FOR PRESS 1 February 1977<br />
CRUDE OIL PRICING<br />
The Cabinet commenced today its discussions on crude oil pricing<br />
arising out of the I. A. C. Report of 30 September, 1976.<br />
Consideration of the Report has been deferred until now ' because<br />
of the absence of the Minister for National Resources, and this<br />
is the first opportunity Cabinet has had to discuss the Report<br />
with the Minister for National Resources present.<br />
The Report is concerned with -the price to be paid to producers<br />
to September 1980 of crude oil. from known fields.<br />
Some questions were raised in the discussions which were not dealt<br />
with in the I. A. C. Report or in the Cabinet Submiss ions and<br />
Ministers have therefore decided that there should be some itirther<br />
clarification by a small committee of permanent heads.<br />
The importance of the discussions was emphasised to Ministers<br />
by the I. A. C. Report that over 400 million barrels of oil could<br />
be recovered uinder import parity pricing that would not be<br />
recovered at existing prices representing an addition of about<br />
percent to known recoverable reserves. Not to exploit these<br />
additional reserves would involve heavy expenditure on imported<br />
oil with all the consequences for the economy and the balance Of<br />
payments that that would involve.<br />
A-fter 1980 ' Local production of crude oil from existing field.-<br />
Will decline and Australia's self sufficiency -in oil. production<br />
will drop steeply. It is estimated that by 1985, if no new fields<br />
are found, the value of crude oil imported will total about<br />
$ 2,500 million at current price levels.<br />
The committee of Permanent Heads has been asked to ' report u-r(, ntly.<br />
The Cabinet wi] ll -resume consideration when the report is avaiilable.<br />
