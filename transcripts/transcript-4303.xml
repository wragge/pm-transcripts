PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS AT THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF AUSTRALIA<br />
ON THE OCCASION OF THE OFFICIAL HANDING OVER OF THE BLIGH NOTEBOOK<br />
Following the mutiny on the Bounty, Captain Bligh ana 17 men made<br />
an epic 3,500 mile voyage in a 23-foot open boat. This voyage<br />
stands as one of the most arduous sea journeys, and one of the<br />
most outstanding feats of navigation in British Naval history.<br />
For a considerable period of time, the primary document of that<br />
voyage was the journal, held by the Mitchell Library, which Bligh<br />
wrote after he reached safety. Recently, the interest of historians<br />
around the world has been excited by the emergence of the original<br />
note book Bligh wrote in the course of that voyage. This notebook<br />
fills an important gap in the documentation of Australia's evolution,<br />
complementing and supplementing many other items, both in the<br />
National Gallery and other Australian institutions relating to<br />
Australia's early settlement. Accordingly, the Governmenat was<br />
very pleased to make a special grant, enabling the Australian<br />
National Library to acquire Bligh's notebook, and hold it in trust<br />
for present and future generations of Australians.<br />
I have only had the opportunity to read extracts from the notebook,<br />
but I understand that amongst other things, it provides additional<br />
insights into Bligh's character, and an interesting description of<br />
Fletcher Christian. Bligh describes Christian as " dark and very<br />
swarthy, strong star tatowed on the left breast, and tatowed<br />
on the backside. His knees stand a little out and may be called<br />
a little bowlegged. He is subject to violent perspiraLion.. 2'<br />
The notebook includes material Bligh omitted from the jou~ rnal<br />
concerning his emotional state, his prayers of anguish almost'-of<br />
despair and his attitudes towards his men who he described as<br />
" such discontented people who don't know what to be or what is<br />
best for them". It is also interesting that while the notebook<br />
carries a plea for mercy for four of the mutineers, no such plea<br />
appears in the later journal.<br />
Bligh of course was prominent in another mutiny of sorts. His<br />
period of Governorship was one of the most turbulent in t'he early<br />
Colony's history, culminating in his arrest on the petition of<br />
over 100 citizens. Bligh returned to England an embittered man<br />
and few historians have subsequently treated him kindly. The<br />
late Dr. Evatt was one of those few who had some regard for Bligh.<br />
/ Another </p>
<p>-2<br />
Another historian, noted for his work on Australia's early<br />
history with his customary predilection for colourful phrases<br />
has described Bligh as " the man who was angry without cause,<br />
who bequeathed no monument of achievement to posterity, and<br />
tasted deep damnation on earth as the fruit of his disquiet."<br />
The acquisition of the notebook will, I hope, stimulate and<br />
facilitate more extensive research into the life and times of<br />
Bligh. The acquisition and preservation of items which are<br />
part of our national heritage is of fundamental importance to<br />
our sense of national identity, to our sense of ourselves and<br />
to the historical and human experience which made us what we<br />
are as a nation.<br />
Some idea of the collective impact on our national consciousness<br />
of the possession and display of records relating to our history<br />
can be seen in the exhibition on shipping currently being mounted<br />
by the National Library. The fortitude of Captain Bligh as set<br />
out in his notebook and that of our early explorers is made vivid<br />
by the pictorial records on exhibition of the ships in which the<br />
early navigators sailed. We have a responsibility to preserve<br />
our national heritage, and it is a matter of concern to the<br />
Government that important relics have been lost to Australia<br />
in the past. The Bligh notebook will augment the national<br />
collections which have recently been added to by other acquisitions<br />
made by the Government on behalf of the Australian people.<br />
Governor Lachlan Macquarie's sword and dirk were acquired last<br />
year and are currently on display, together wi-th other items<br />
associated with Macquarie in the Mitchell Library. They will<br />
continue to be displayed around Australia so that as many people<br />
can have access to them as possible. Similarly, after the initial<br />
display in the National Library, the Bligh notebook will be made<br />
available for display in other Australian institutions.<br />
As you know, 1977 marks the 50th anniversary of the opening of<br />
the Federal Parliament in Canberra. The Government has recently<br />
further added to -the national collections by purchasing the<br />
Crossley motor car used by Their Royal Highnesses, the Duke and<br />
Duchess of York on that occasion. Their daughter, Her Majesty<br />
the Queen, will be visiting Australia this year during her Silver<br />
Jubilee Year, and I hope that this historic vehicle may be used<br />
in the celebration of these two significant events.<br />
In pursuit of the proper conservation of Australia's historical<br />
heritage, the Government has also recently established an<br />
independent committee on official establishments. This committee<br />
has the responsibility of advising the Government on the maintenance<br />
operation, conservation and longer term improvement of the four<br />
official residences of the Commonwealth Government Government<br />
House, The Lodge, Kirribilli House, and Admiralty House. These<br />
residences are storehouses of Australian history and tradition,<br />
and it is essential that their significance be maintained and<br />
enhanced. Their decoration for instance, should not be<br />
/ determnined </p>
<p>3<br />
determined by the whim of the occupants of the day, but by<br />
considerations of the part the establishments have played, and<br />
will continue to play, in Australian history, and the ability<br />
of future generations to understand that history.<br />
The Government believes that all places and items of real<br />
historic value to Australia should be preserved for future<br />
generations, and that this goal must be responsibly pursued<br />
even in times of great economic restraint. The preservation of<br />
our national heritage cannot however be achieved by the Government<br />
alone. All Australians have an important part to play and many<br />
people are actively contributing to this goal, including the<br />
many friends and associates of the National Library who are here<br />
today to see the Bligh notebook.<br />
Mr. Director General, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great<br />
pleasure to be here to mark the acquisition of the Bligh notebook<br />
and to emphasise the role of the National Library in holding the<br />
notebook in trust. </p>
