TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE RE: THE NATIONAL MEETING ON YOUTH<br />
TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
22 JULY<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I'll just begin by saying that we had an<br />
exceptionally good meeting, the atmospherics of the<br />
meeting were good, the contribution by the<br />
participants was good, and it started of f<br />
exceptionally well. I think everyone left with a<br />
good feeling about the meeting and I think that<br />
Yvette Varco, one of the young people from theYouth<br />
Action Group, this morning, talked about sharing,<br />
that picked up some of the theme of the day and I<br />
think set a good tone.<br />
I might, if you like, just make these general points<br />
that everyone recognises that there are two<br />
problems here. That is, the fact that Acbs in the<br />
to 19 year area have since the 1960s largely<br />
disappeared, that is the untrained jobs and that we<br />
needed this transition from school to work. That<br />
being one of the principle subjects under<br />
consideration, the second being the immediate plight<br />
of the unemployed, those for which the Carmichael<br />
Report and the transition and the rest wiflbe too<br />
latfie. Those people who are already unemployed and<br />
whose faith and hope in this community has been<br />
diminished as a result, and whose self esteem-has<br />
been diminished as a result. That was the other<br />
great issue under discussion.<br />
So there was an atmosphere of co-operation at the<br />
meeting. The views put by people from various<br />
segments came with a lot of good will, and I'd be<br />
very surprised if any of the participants who you've<br />
seen as they'd left don't corroborate what I've<br />
said. I might just give you an idea of what I think<br />
emerged from the morning and the afternoon session. </p>
<p>There was a general concern in the morning by many<br />
speakers to get the economy moving. That is a<br />
commitment to growtfi7AiiAM that's a commitment<br />
across the board, from the business community, the<br />
trade unions, welfare organisations, conservation<br />
groups, womens groups, all the groups there wanted a<br />
commitment to_ 9rwth. Now this may not sound<br />
exceptional, but it is indeed quite profound,<br />
because we know for the economy to grow and to take<br />
up the workforce growth of this country means that<br />
it needs to grow reasonably fast, and to have it<br />
grow reasonably fast means that the checks on<br />
inflation and wages do not see the growth spilled<br />
away in a price and wage round, requires national<br />
agreements about incomes. So all the people<br />
endorsing a higher growth strategy are implicitly<br />
endorsing a co-operative way of running the economy<br />
and rejecting explicitly having the central bank<br />
strap the economy down to protect inflation and<br />
letting employment become a residual. The meeting<br />
rejected that path and supported the economy moving<br />
back to growth. A recognition that jobs must come<br />
through that growth, and through micro-economic<br />
reform. There was agreement that 15 to 19 years<br />
should be seen as a period of vocational<br />
preparation. And the need to expand and upgrade our<br />
vocational education and training system so as to<br />
provide high quality, accredited training for our<br />
young people, and for technical iid vocational<br />
education to have the samie status as higher<br />
education. And there was some discussion about<br />
accreditation from a national training authority<br />
certificate back into university, whichi we can't do<br />
today, because of the fragmentation of TAFE one<br />
can't get a certification process to come back and<br />
re-enter the university stream.<br />
In this context there was wide-spread support for<br />
the establishment for a national traininsyte<br />
along the lines announcF66 yiesterdy, participants<br />
feeling that a real milestone, a real break through<br />
had occurred in the arrangements which we're able to<br />
announce yesterday, and strong support for close<br />
industry involvement in the National Authority.<br />
The broad thrust of the Carmichael Report and the<br />
principles underlying that were embraced by<br />
everybody, there wasn't one demur, and there was an<br />
exceptional degree on unanimity of opinion around<br />
the Carmichael Report and its principles and<br />
appreciation of the fact that the new entry level<br />
training arrangements should be ind * ustry-driven and<br />
responsive to the needs of individual industries.<br />
Everyone was also very keen to fast track the<br />
implementation of the Carmichael pilots, the pilot<br />
schemes which will set up this school to work </p>
<p>transition. And this was very gratifying for the<br />
Government to hear, coming from employers, who have<br />
to provide the places. And we'll take the cue, and<br />
I indicated that the Commonwealth was willing to<br />
fund all quality proposals for pilots which come<br />
forward, because what was said to us today is that<br />
the number of pilots that will come forward will be<br />
much greater than we had ourselves, in the first<br />
instance, expected.<br />
So that was this morning. Agreement about 15 to<br />
19 year being a period of vocational preparation,<br />
the need to expand and upgrade vocational education<br />
and training, a recognition that a lot had already<br />
been done in lifting the participation rates in<br />
secondary schools from 3 in 10 to 7 in 10 and that<br />
already a lot had been done in creation of tertiary<br />
places, but now seen to need that complemented by<br />
vocational education and training, and unanimous<br />
support for the broad thrust of the Carmichael<br />
Report to give young people a clear pathway and a<br />
clear transition from school to work, and very<br />
strong support for the pilot schemes and a<br />
willingness on the part of the Government to fund as<br />
many of them as we possibly can.<br />
Now in the afternoon we discussed the question of<br />
unemployment and particularly unemployment for those<br />
people who will not have the advantage of the<br />
transition set up by the Carmichael type changes,<br />
and who have been unemployed now for some time. And<br />
there was general support for community based job<br />
schemes. And this came from organisations such as<br />
the National Farmers' Federation in Landcare type<br />
JOBSKILLS programs where they indicated they could<br />
take up to 5,000 people. The Local Government<br />
Association which indicated that local government<br />
stands ready for infrastructure works of a regional<br />
and local variety. FromBishjop Holjlingrworth who<br />
talked about his concept Serving Australia which is<br />
a variation of theYouth Corps concept, which is<br />
again a variation of the Land'care JOBSKILLS<br />
programs. And from the ACTJ, the National Farmers'<br />
Federation, the Australian Conservation Foundation,<br />
support for Regional Employment Schemes to establish<br />
an arrangement so that we can see employment go into<br />
some of these areas beyond the capital cities.<br />
There was general support for decent income levels<br />
for young people. And from people such as Espirit,<br />
. and the Body Shop, the view that $ 3.00 an hour was<br />
not adequate, was not an adequate level of income.<br />
The ACTU, for it's part, said that the unions would<br />
need to be flexible if industry is to be flexible,<br />
if people in business will make the commitment to<br />
put more young people on, that there was a<br />
requirement on the trade unions to be flexible but<br />
the jobs also need to be, because they are not often </p>
<p>4<br />
commercial jobs, need to be subsidised by the<br />
community, and that is by the Government. ACOSS in<br />
its concluding remarks said it would be leaving the<br />
conference where they were quietly confident, they<br />
said that most people will leave with a commitment<br />
to do more. And I think the general attitude of<br />
participants at the conclusion of the meeting<br />
States, business, unions, business groups, Farmers<br />
Federation, the ACF, womens groups, the young people<br />
felt that it was a very good meeting and worthwhile<br />
things had been said, and that worthwhile changes<br />
could well come from it. Now, the task for the<br />
Government is now to consider what has been put<br />
today, to weigh the balances of some of the things<br />
said because many specific things were debated. For<br />
instance, the trade unions talked about supporting<br />
traineeships and a JOBSKILLS award, which would go<br />
some distance to seeing a rapid expansion of the<br />
JOBSKILLS program. And those things will need to be<br />
considered by the Government between now and next<br />
week when we will announce a set of conclusions, a<br />
policy outcome coming from the conclusions of today.<br />
So, I think that if I could some sum up this way and<br />
say that people know that the Australian economy has<br />
been in a long run transition, that the work which<br />
was formally done by young people in an unskilled<br />
way, in a very broad way, doesn't exist as it did.<br />
That which mostly exists, will exist for those who<br />
are trained. We are now establishing, and there has<br />
been recognition for the fact that we have<br />
established already important transitional<br />
arrangements by participation and universities<br />
towards a better trained workforce, and that the<br />
National Training Authority was a milestone change,<br />
and that on the particular problem of those who are<br />
young and currently unemployed, that we need to<br />
focus on labour market programs, both of a regional<br />
and an urban variety, and which take people up in<br />
employment, where employers are prepared to hire<br />
people if in fact they think the arrangements are<br />
flexible enough, and that means flexibility from the<br />
unions and flexibility from the Government.<br />
J: Mr Keating will you announce specific pilot projects<br />
under Carmichael next week. And secondly what<br />
happens to the negotiations with the ACTU on the<br />
training wage? Do you want to try and finish those<br />
so that you get across-the-board agreement, or will<br />
they now go to project by project negotiations?<br />
PM: Well some may be across the board, for instance if<br />
we were to agree to a JOBSKILLS award, but the rest<br />
of it would be probably in many respects enterprise<br />
by enterprise.<br />
J: ( inaudible) </p>
<p>PM: No, I am talking about in relation to immediate<br />
employment.<br />
J: I am talking about the Carmichael pilots.<br />
PM: In relation to the Carmichael pilots, again I think<br />
it is probably to early for us. I can say now we<br />
will be adopting in principle quality Carmichael<br />
pilots.<br />
J: But you won't be announcing specific pilot policies?<br />
PM: Well I don't know that we will have the pilots<br />
proposed to us by Monday. I think many of the<br />
participants today were themselves surprised how<br />
much general support there was for it, and that now<br />
I think many more will come forward. Some involve<br />
twenty people, some involve fifty, some involve<br />
hundreds of people. So they will have to be looked<br />
at, and provided that the proposals are quality<br />
proposals we will fund them.<br />
J: Are you attracted to the JOBSKILLS award concept?<br />
PM: I need to examine that and see what it means. There<br />
is always this tension between moving to a more<br />
enterprised based system of wage fixation, including<br />
for young people, and yet the advantage which comes<br />
quickly from being able to spread, say a program<br />
like JOBSKILLS by virtue of having all the<br />
industrial bases covered in one go, in one way.<br />
J: What about the negotiations that have been going on<br />
on the training wage and that outstanding difference<br />
between the Government and the ACTU? What happens<br />
to that now?<br />
PM: There was, as I said today, a lot of support for<br />
decent income levels and when there was some debate<br />
about $ 117.00 for forty hours being the proposition<br />
of the Coalition, being $ 3.00 an hour, or $ 117.00<br />
for five days, but if you work two days training<br />
it's only three fifths of $ 117.00, there was no<br />
support for that in the room. No support for that.<br />
So, I think there were a number of references to a<br />
set of structured arrangements which are basically<br />
going to be sound, sensible and long-term.<br />
J: So Carmichael should be more adequate?<br />
PM: Well Carmichael is a long run transition. It's the<br />
change through TAFE and through universities,<br />
through TAFE particularly, which will finish of f<br />
that the big participation rates we have now got<br />
coming through secondary schools. But the people<br />
who are in their late teenage years now, it's too<br />
late for them, the Carmichael transition, it's too<br />
late for them. </p>
<p>J: Well that been the case Prime Minister, that leaves<br />
the policy weight, the brunt to fall on immediate<br />
measures, doesn't it?<br />
PM: Well that was what I was just talking about.<br />
3: But what out of this conference in terms of<br />
immediate measures attracted you?<br />
PM: Well that's the thing I was just saying to you.<br />
That in talking about the extension of JOBSKILLS,<br />
say to regional programs, or urban businesses, or<br />
other genuinely structured training type paths, I<br />
think we can arrive at a structure which will do<br />
some of them good and material for employment of<br />
young people.<br />
J: What sort of timetable do you envisage for<br />
Carmichael ( inaudible)?<br />
PM: Well it means, for a start they have got to have<br />
training places and that means how quickly we can<br />
build a TAFE system up. Already we have many<br />
unfilled places in TAFE, that's a point I made to<br />
you yesterday. I thfink we will be able to build a<br />
Carmichael type transition quite rapidly, certainly<br />
as fast as business wants it to go, we will be able<br />
to accommodate it.<br />
J: Just in relation to the youth training wage, or the<br />
training wage issue Mr Keating, I am not clear. Are<br />
you intending in the statement you make next week to<br />
indicate the Government's view of how you develop a<br />
training wage structure?<br />
PM: Well I think we will probably do that, yes. There<br />
is a simplistic view in the media that there is<br />
going to be a sort of training wage and there then<br />
has to be therefore some sort of concession on the<br />
part of the trade unions that in some way cuts a<br />
very large hole in the rates of pay of people who<br />
are currently employed as young people. This is not<br />
the view of most of the people at this meeting. So<br />
they want something which is structured and<br />
sensible.<br />
J: So that rejects Carmichael?<br />
PM: No, no that doesn't reject Carmichael. But<br />
Carmichael is talking about award wages at the end<br />
of the transition, so we could be talking about some<br />
variation on that on the way through. But again, it<br />
depends on how much is on-the-job training,. how much<br />
is off-the-job training, and what the nature of that<br />
training is, whether it's generic training, or<br />
whether it's key competencies or what. </p>
<p>J: But how are you going to solve those issues?<br />
PM: I think that we have had already concessions made by<br />
the unions, a willingness and a stated willingness<br />
on their part to be flexible, and we will try and<br />
design some programs ready for announcement<br />
comprehending these things.<br />
J: Isn't the issue who picks up the training tab over<br />
and above the $ 117.00, the Government, the<br />
individual, or the employer?<br />
PM: No, not the only issue because in JOBSKILLS we<br />
already pay a substantial subsidy, so however that<br />
subsidy is paid, whether it is to meet a guaranteed<br />
minimum or to top up is a matter for negotiation.<br />
J: Taking you back to the start, there was no doubt<br />
that everyone embraced the concept of the Carmichael<br />
training wage, embraced in principle?<br />
PM: Unanimously.<br />
J: So funding for the Carmichael pilots. Were you<br />
saying that it won't be restricted to just pinning<br />
wages to $ 117 a week, and that you may be willing to<br />
negotiate for subsidies to bring wages above that<br />
level?<br />
PM: The ACTU is talking about $ 117 as a sort of<br />
guarantee minimum. But again, they are not talking<br />
about it necessarily for a 40 hour week, a la<br />
Hewson, they are talking about part week work and<br />
part week training.<br />
J: It will still be a 40 hour week from the<br />
individual's point of view, wouldn't it, if you took<br />
their training and their work.<br />
PM: Yes, that's right.<br />
J: Do you have any in principle position on who should<br />
foot the bill for training under that scheme?<br />
PM: Yes I have thoughts about it. But again, I'm not<br />
going to try to design the thing here.<br />
J: What do you define a decent living wage?<br />
PM: I'm not here to define that either. We've got now<br />
the 18 and over independent rate, Austudy away from<br />
home. We put together, thoughtfully, in the 1980s a<br />
common youth structure which has been one of the big<br />
factors which has lifted the participation rates in<br />
schools, and it has worked. </p>
<p>J: If the Coalition's $ 114 wage is too low for<br />
individuals to live on, do you concede also that the<br />
$ 117 may well be too low?<br />
PM: Just understand this, the Coalition's propositions<br />
have no relevance in the industrial world of<br />
Australia whatsoever. Nobody is interested in it.<br />
There's no training about them, you get $ 117 if you<br />
work a full week, if you get trained you get less<br />
than $ 117. If you work three days work and two days<br />
training you get three fifths of $ 117 and no<br />
training. Left dead! Nobody is interested in that.<br />
Not a sole. Not any segment of that meeting was<br />
interested in that. I mean we are talking about<br />
something real, something long term, something that<br />
is part of a structured transition from school to<br />
work, and which at the samre time fills the bill for<br />
those who are unemployed now.<br />
J: Is there a need for the Government to review the<br />
level of unemployment benefits, though, for young<br />
people $ 117 being for an independent?<br />
PM: We were not there today to have a debate about the<br />
adequacy of pensions or benefits. I'm not here to<br />
have a discussion about adequacy.<br />
J: Is the Government and the ACTU satisfied that there<br />
won't be a serious displacement problem?<br />
PM: These are obviously all additional people, people<br />
who business wouldn't otherwise be taking up.<br />
J: So what happens to them at the end of the day? That<br />
has always been one of the ACTU's concerns, hasn't<br />
it, when they graduate to an adult wage?<br />
PM: Well if they're valuable to the business and the<br />
scheme is cost effective, then businesses will carry<br />
it beyond the naked commercial considerations.<br />
Because on a naked commercial basis they wouldn't<br />
employ these people. That's the problem now. They<br />
are telling you now that they won't employ them.<br />
That's obvious in the figures.<br />
J: You said a moment ago that the level of benefits<br />
wasn't an issue at today's meeting. One of the<br />
unemployed teenagers has told us that they mentioned<br />
to you that the financial support for young people<br />
isn't enough, especially in an aboriginal family.<br />
PM: That is true. But the purpose of the meeting was to<br />
look at remedies for jobs and training.<br />
J: Well what's your response to that teenager? </p>
<p>PM: My response is that the Government did not go there<br />
today to debate adequacy of levels, and is not going<br />
to be debating them now.<br />
J: You also talked about funding any quality program<br />
under the Carmichael pilots. What cap has the<br />
Government got on the total amount of money for<br />
these?<br />
PM: I think at the moment the pilots are very modest in<br />
number. We started believing they would be modest<br />
and finished the day thinking they would be much<br />
more than modest. That is, by the decision<br />
yesterday on the National Training Authority, which<br />
was a milestone change, that plus an acceleration of<br />
the pilots will accelerate the transition of the<br />
Carmichael variety from school to work by years. By<br />
years. So the more pilots that can come through,<br />
the more likely we are to be funding them.<br />
J: Would you imagine next calender year, Mr Keating,<br />
you'd have 5000 people in these pilots, or 500?<br />
What sort of<br />
PM: There's no point in trying to put a number on them,<br />
Michelle ( Grattan), there's no point at all. It's<br />
the quality that will matter and setting them up<br />
right, so we're setting up a long road.<br />
J: Do you have some specific proposals before you<br />
already?<br />
PM: Yes, already.<br />
J: Can you give us some examples of the sorts of<br />
pilots?<br />
PM: Kim Beazley can do that, I can't from the top of my<br />
head. We have a number but they are not great in<br />
number, but they will be greater in number as a<br />
result of the meeting.<br />
J: The ACTU has called for programs to the value of<br />
$ 750 million a year. Is that sort of thing out of<br />
the question, or a possibility?<br />
PM: Again, that's only asking me what we're going to<br />
announce next week. Just give us time to do that.<br />
Let me just make this point about the general change<br />
in education and the transition. John Dawkins made<br />
the point in his concluding remarks, that a decade<br />
ago in the United States they were debating the<br />
inadequacy of the US education system to deal with<br />
the responsibilities of the United States economy,<br />
and nothing has changed in a decade. In a decade in<br />
Australia we have come from three kids in ten<br />
completing secondary school to seven in ten, we're<br />
on our way to nine in ten, we've added 50 per cent </p>
<p>to university places, we are now going to totally<br />
modernise and lift in status and volume technical<br />
and further education, vocational education, and<br />
make secure pathways between school and work. It is<br />
a transition within six or seven years that<br />
countries take decades to put into place. And what<br />
yesterday and today will do will simply truncate<br />
that transition down further.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you said at the outset that there was<br />
consensus about the need to get the economy moving.<br />
Was there any consensus about how much needs to be<br />
spent to do that?<br />
PM: There was no debate really. The ACTU in a very<br />
routine way mentioned the fact that we should spend<br />
x and we should put marginal tax rates et cetera, in<br />
a sort of recital of its earlier announced<br />
proposals, but there was no debate about that. But<br />
there was from a number of people, the business<br />
representatives like John Prescott, the MTIA, Bert<br />
Evans, people saying expressly that the big solution<br />
here is growth, they want a growth economy. Well,<br />
everyone who understands this debate knows that the<br />
Liberal Party could never give them a growth<br />
economy, because if it grows even moderately quickly<br />
then wages and inflation will grow with it and<br />
they'll check it with an interest rate rise. So<br />
they're really putting their hand up for a policy<br />
difference than that of the Opposition.<br />
J: were they putting their hand up also for you to<br />
spend big in this Budget?<br />
PM: No, the business community I don't think were, no,<br />
not. But again, I think they want to see those<br />
things that we have done spent and brought to<br />
fruition.<br />
J: Did they say explicitly that they didn't belive the<br />
Coalition could deliver growth for them?<br />
PM: No, but everyone around the room knows, all the<br />
participants are long term players, some attended<br />
the 1983 Economic Sumnmit, a couple at least, so they<br />
know what the word growth implies. It means a<br />
higher rate of economic growth to pick up<br />
Australia's quite high workforce growth, and it can<br />
only be done by having national agreements on income<br />
determination. The thing which holds inflation and<br />
wages in check will not simply be monetary policy,<br />
because if it is simply monetary policy you end up<br />
with a pool of unemployed. That is, if we are in an<br />
economy where we are getting more output from fewer<br />
people, that is a more productive show where we're<br />
getting more output from fewer people but we still<br />
have a pool of unemployment, what is the obvious<br />
conclusion? To have even greater output. So that </p>
<p>if we have an economy where we're getting more<br />
output per unit of employment, we need therefore<br />
even more output. That means rates of economic<br />
growth and an economic management system which lets<br />
grow. Like we had in the ' 80s that is we had<br />
decelerating inflation while we had high rates of<br />
growth. Now you can't deliver that with a<br />
traditional monetary response. The monetary<br />
response a la the Liberal Party means you hold the<br />
economy in check to hold wages and inflation in<br />
check and that the pool of unemployed actually acts<br />
as a break on wage demands. In their model the<br />
unemployment is a permanent feature, and a feature<br />
which helps in the management of inflation and wage<br />
control. This is a model we reject absolutely.<br />
J: Mr Keating, have you set a target on the number of<br />
people you want to get out of the unemployment pool<br />
by the end of the year?<br />
PM: No.<br />
J: Can you set a target?<br />
PM: Well wait till next week, I'm not here to play games<br />
about targets and things with you.<br />
J: Was the ACTLJ's push for a national wage claim<br />
brought up at the meeting?<br />
PM: No, not mentioned.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you had business people there today<br />
discussing what the Government can do to create<br />
employment to get the economy growing, but you had<br />
the Chairman of the National Australia Bank in New<br />
York only a week or so ago advising international<br />
investors not to come to Australia, saying that<br />
Australia's industrial relations and labour market<br />
systems mitigate against investment. What is your<br />
reaction to those sorts of remarks?<br />
PM: Well it certainly wasn't Mr Prescott's view. As he<br />
represents the largest industrial company in this<br />
country, he said much of the growth will come from<br />
the international market place. And he went on to<br />
talk about that, the need for competitiveness,<br />
focus, management of businesses, et cetera. There<br />
was very great acceptance around the room today, or<br />
mentioned a number of times net exports growth,<br />
import replacement, exports, to carry some of the<br />
real load of production in Australia. And one only<br />
has to state the obvious two thirds of our exports<br />
and our imports are with the Asia-Pacific.<br />
Thank you. </p>
