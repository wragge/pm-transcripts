<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister a very good morning to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hello, it's good to be with you both.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Your Government at this stage appears to be facing a bit of an</p>
<p>   uphill battle. How can you can convince South Australian voters</p>
<p>   not to desert the Coalition?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we can remind South Australian voters what the Australian</p>
<p>   economy was like when we came to office. We had a $10.5 billion</p>
<p>   annual deficit. We had $95 billion of Federal Government debt. We</p>
<p>   had the highest interest rates for decades.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And we can tell them that for example housing interest rates in</p>
<p>   the last two-and-a- quarter years have fallen by about $300 a month.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>And why is it inspite of all that, they're relatively unforgiving.</p>
<p>   I mean there are still South Australian families who are finding</p>
<p>   it tough financially, unemployment is still very much a major problem</p>
<p>   in this State. They seem less impressed by what you've done</p>
<p>   as unimpressed by what you haven't done.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you can never answer everybody's concerns on everything.</p>
<p>   No Prime Minister can do that.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>But unemployment's a big one isn't it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Unemployment remains a major issue, although we have created 290,00</p>
<p>   jobs in two- and-a-quarter years. And it is lower than what it was</p>
<p>   when we came to office. But it is still a challenge and in the end</p>
<p>   they will have to decide whether they'll be better off bringing</p>
<p>   back Mr Beazley and Mr Evans to run the economy, remembering that</p>
<p>   they are the people who left us with that annual deficit of $10.5</p>
<p>   billion and the highest interest rates in 30 years. Now that's</p>
<p>   what democracy is all about. You do the things you think are good</p>
<p>   for the country.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You argue your case, you point out what the alternative stands</p>
<p>   for and then you let the people make a decision.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>One of the criticisms, and I'm sure you've heard it,</p>
<p>   is people say look I don't know if John Howard and his Government</p>
<p>   genuinely understands what I'm going through. Do they really</p>
<p>   understand how tough it is for Mums and Dads?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know it is tough for a lot of Mums and Dads and that's why</p>
<p>   we've focussed on reducing interest rates. Most Mums and Dads</p>
<p>   have got a mortgage bill and it is much lower now than when Mr Keating</p>
<p>   was the Prime Minister. Inflation is lower. And I can say to those</p>
<p>   Mums and Dads that when the tax policy comes out, if you've</p>
<p>   got children you'll be big winners. And most Mums and Dads,</p>
<p>   on my last check have children....</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>That's true.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you feel under more pressure now than you have</p>
<p>   had any other time during your term of two-and-half years nearly?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, that's very hard to assess. You go through pressure in</p>
<p>   this job no matter what's happening, there's a lot on</p>
<p>   at the moment and there's an expectation now because we are</p>
<p>   very close to the release of the taxation policy and people are</p>
<p>   able to criticise us on tax without us being able to give the full</p>
<p>   blast in return because we can't announce all the details.</p>
<p>   But when we do announce all of those details you're going to</p>
<p>   see quite a change in public attitude.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>When will you announce the details?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very soon.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Just before the election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No not just before the election, very soon.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Very soon, okay.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And what we're going to do is let people have a look at it</p>
<p>   before contemplating calling an election so that we can go around</p>
<p>   the country explaining it. </p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, can we talk about tax because....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Because as you're well aware tax reform, everybody seems to</p>
<p>   agree that there is a need for tax reform......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They do overwhelming, they think the present system's unfair.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>But, when you say tax reform it equates for many people as simply</p>
<p>   a GST. Now you say "GST" and people run scared. Is that</p>
<p>   the only option?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we are not going to bring in a GST full stop. We're</p>
<p>   going to have a GST as part of an overall plan. We're not going</p>
<p>   to put a GST on top of the present system. I mean at the moment</p>
<p>   you pay 22 per cent wholesales tax on a whole lot of household goods.</p>
<p>   We're certainly not going to put an Âx' per cent</p>
<p>   GST on top of that. If we bring in a GST we'll get rid of the</p>
<p>   22 per cent altogether.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>All right, you talk about a GST. Now, people have been working</p>
<p>   on a nominal figure of around 10 per cent. The question people want</p>
<p>   to know, is okay, if I now face a GST of say 10 per cent, effectively</p>
<p>   what does that mean in terms of income tax? If you give me a GST</p>
<p>   of 10 per cent, what do I get back in terms of income tax cuts?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not going to talk about what the GST rate might</p>
<p>   be, but I am going to say that people will be fully compensated</p>
<p>   and more, fully compensated and more for any price effects of a</p>
<p>   goods and services tax.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, would you agree though.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>So they won't be worse off. They won't be worse off.</p>
<p>   And I ask them to accept that now, if they don't believe it</p>
<p>   have a look at the figures.....</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>See, they don't believe it though do they?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, obviously it's hard for people to believe in it at the</p>
<p>   moment because they haven't seen the figures and we haven't</p>
<p>   announced the policy. But I'm saying now that when the policy</p>
<p>   comes out....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>.....they will see, they'll be a nice table in the Adelaide</p>
<p>   Advertiser that will show the position of families in particular</p>
<p>   and people will find that they are not worse off and they will see</p>
<p>   the benefit of the change.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister are there people in your party who are saying to</p>
<p>   you now, "look forget the GST, forget the complete privatisation</p>
<p>   of Telstra, if you drop both of those things we can win the next</p>
<p>   election and probably win it easily"?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There are very few people in the Coalition who are saying that</p>
<p>   to me. Obviously the outcome of the Queensland election has unsettled</p>
<p>   some people in the National Party in particular, but overwhelming</p>
<p>   my colleagues accept for the sake of Australia we need a fairer</p>
<p>   tax system. It's not for my sake. It's not because I've</p>
<p>   got some kind of pride of ownership and I'm so stubborn and</p>
<p>   inflexible that I won't shift. I know that Australia needs</p>
<p>   a better tax system. I really believe that and my job as a Prime</p>
<p>   Minister is to go out and argue for things that I believe are good</p>
<p>   for Australia.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, where do you stand though? I mean there have been</p>
<p>   various.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Where do I stand on what?</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>No... various reports, there was one recently by ACOSS, now</p>
<p>   a group of highly respected social welfare groups that came out</p>
<p>   and really bagged a GST. All right, not working on the absolute</p>
<p>   final detail but they overwhelming said....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They actually said that they would accept a GST providing it was</p>
<p>   at a certain rate.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Yes but they also said...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They didn't absolutely bag it, that's not right I'm</p>
<p>   sorry.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>But they said that families would be worse off, that low income</p>
<p>   families would be worse off.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can only repeat to you what I said a moment ago, and the proof</p>
<p>   of this won't be demonstrated until the package comes out,</p>
<p>   but I would say to the families of Adelaide and South Australia</p>
<p>   who are listening to this program, suspend your judgement, have</p>
<p>   a look at the details, have a look at the tables in the Adelaide</p>
<p>   Advertiser and so forth and you will find that you are not</p>
<p>   left worse off by this tax change. In many cases people will find</p>
<p>   themselves significantly better off and they will recognise that</p>
<p>   for the good of Australia this is a reform we should have.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you spoke earlier about it being a matter of choice</p>
<p>   for the Australian public whether they go with the Coalition or</p>
<p>   whether they look at the sins of Labor but it strikes me that many</p>
<p>   people are not looking at either. There alternative is not Labor</p>
<p>   or Liberal, there alternative for whatever reason is One Nation.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, in a democracy people can choose anybody they like. And One</p>
<p>   Nation has got a right to run. Mrs Hanson's got a right to</p>
<p>   go around Australia putting her point of view. People who demonstrate</p>
<p>   against her actually help her. I think it's quite, people who</p>
<p>   don't like her policies shouldn't stage violent demonstrations</p>
<p>   against her...</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>No, I mean what did you think of this weeks comments. I mean comments</p>
<p>   about Aboriginals, comments about single Mums?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well what she said about the 1967 referendum was wrong, and I said</p>
<p>   so. </p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The 1967 referendum was not about giving the Aborigines the vote.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Most Australian Aborigines have had the vote since Federation.</p>
<p>   The 1967 referendum was about counting Aborigines and Torres Strait</p>
<p>   Islanders in the Census. And that was really the very least you</p>
<p>   can do to fellow Australians to count them as part of the Australian</p>
<p>   community and also about giving the Federal Government power to</p>
<p>   legislate in relation to Aboriginal Affairs. So she was completely</p>
<p>   wrong, but she actually inferred in that comment that perhaps the</p>
<p>   vote should be taken away from a section of the Australian population.</p>
<p>   Now that's wrong in principle and I condemn it.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, did you underestimate Pauline Hanson when she first</p>
<p>   came on the scene.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I believed that a lot of the publicity given to her by sections</p>
<p>   of the media would have the result that it ultimately did, and that</p>
<p>   is to give her a prominence that her policies did not deserve. But</p>
<p>   what judgements you make about what people did a couple of years</p>
<p>   ago are now irrelevant, it's a question of dealing with the</p>
<p>   situation now and you deal with it by attacking errors of fact as</p>
<p>   I do, attacking prejudiced attitudes whenever they arise, but you</p>
<p>   also respond by promoting your own beliefs and your own policies</p>
<p>   and telling the public what you believe is good for Australia.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, is there a danger that you can attack her too much?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>...and the Opposition and other Politicians?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it is wrong to attack people in a personal sense, whether</p>
<p>   it's Mrs Hanson or Mr Beazley or anybody else, I think the</p>
<p>   public is tired of that....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>....the public is interested in debate on issues and they want</p>
<p>   us to address issues and address concerns.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Is that one of the problems though that even though Pauline Hanson</p>
<p>   seems to launch from faux pas to faux pas, are you hamstrung because</p>
<p>   you can't seem to land a blow, as it were on Pauline Hanson,</p>
<p>   without a great majority of the Australian public rushing to her</p>
<p>   defence. It doesn't seem to matter even when she's wrong,</p>
<p>   they still seem far more forgiving of her than perhaps they would</p>
<p>   be of either yourself or Mr Beazley.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But that question betrays a misunderstanding, and that misunderstanding</p>
<p>   is that in some way it's possible in politics to put somebody</p>
<p>   out of the ring with one sort of single comment.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean that's not the case. You can't do that. It's</p>
<p>   an incremental thing you argue over a period of time. She plays</p>
<p>   on peoples vulnerbilities, if you are feeling insecure, if you've</p>
<p>   lost your job, your business is going broke, you live in an isolated</p>
<p>   community and somebody comes along and says I can solve all of your</p>
<p>   problems by stopping imports. And if I can stop imports you will</p>
<p>   be rich. </p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>It sound pretty good doesn't it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It sounds terrific and yet, you then think: yeah but the bloke</p>
<p>   next door to me sells something overseas...</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>.......and if we stop imports, so I survive, the bloke next</p>
<p>   door goes broke because people will no longer take his exports.</p>
<p>   Trade is a two-way thing. We export and we import and if we stop</p>
<p>   imports other people will stop our exports.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>It's not that simple. Mr Howard we'll take a quick break</p>
<p>   and we'll be back with the Prime Minister John Howard in just</p>
<p>   a moment.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Our guest this morning, of course, is the Prime Minister John Howard.</p>
<p>   Prime Minister, very quickly can we talk about the economy for a</p>
<p>   moment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>I mean, some of the economists are using the word Ârecession'.</p>
<p>   And I suppose they're in particular talking about Japan and</p>
<p>   the situation up there. How do you see our economy and how reliant</p>
<p>   are we on South East Asia and in particular Japan?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well recession talk is wrong. We're not headed towards a recession;</p>
<p>   our growth is still very strong. Our economy won't be unaffected</p>
<p>   by what's happening in Asia, it's already been affected</p>
<p>   to some degree and it could be affected more. But it would have</p>
<p>   been affected a lot more if we hadn't done what we've</p>
<p>   done over the last two- and-a-half years, if we hadn't eliminated</p>
<p>   that $10  billion annual deficit we inherited and if we hadn't</p>
<p>   have got inflation down and interest rates down and made other economic</p>
<p>   changes. And can I say again it will be further affected if we don't</p>
<p>   make our tax system better, because by changing our tax system we</p>
<p>   can further strengthen the Australian economy against what's</p>
<p>   happening in Asia.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, on that tax question, one of the constant comments we</p>
<p>   get from people who call into the programme is to say, "Look</p>
<p>   it's all very well to look at changing the tax system for the</p>
<p>   PAYE employees but has the Government really cracked down heavily</p>
<p>   enough on those, particularly well organised tax minimisers, the</p>
<p>   large companies that while not doing anything illegal certainly</p>
<p>   know every in and out of tax minimisation?"</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I ask them to have a look at the policy when it comes out.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>You're going to keep us waiting aren't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, no. But you have to understand, I mean we are, I mean I</p>
<p>   want to get it out as soon as possible but it's a huge exercise.</p>
<p>   It's the first time...</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>So is that a word of warning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it's not a word of warning it is a statement of fact.</p>
<p>   To change a country's taxation system and to make sure you</p>
<p>   get it all right is a very big undertaking and we have to get it</p>
<p>   right. And when it comes out people will see that it's fair,</p>
<p>   the cheats won't like it, they won't like it all, average</p>
<p>   families will love it.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, does your Government genuinely deserve another go at</p>
<p>   running the country?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. I believe that we have done, in difficult circumstances, a</p>
<p>   very good job of managing the economy. I believe that we have eliminated</p>
<p>   a lot of the stultifying political correctness that existed in this</p>
<p>   country under the Keating Government where if you disagreed with</p>
<p>   their policies on things like Aboriginal affairs you were accused</p>
<p>   of being a racist. I think that it is a very good thing that we've</p>
<p>   got rid of that atmosphere of political correctness. But our management</p>
<p>   of the economy has meant that we are less vulnerable and we've</p>
<p>   been less punished by the economic downturn than ever before. And,</p>
<p>   I mean we do have the lowest housing and small business interest</p>
<p>   rates since the late 1960s. I mean that is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister there's a concern out there and you'd</p>
<p>   have felt it, you'd have talked about it, you'd have heard</p>
<p>   people saying it to you about our health situation, about our health</p>
<p>   scheme, just the general....</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Public health.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Yes, public health Âthing-a-me-bob'. What can you do</p>
<p>   in this term or if you're elected again in the next term to</p>
<p>   address the problems that obviously exist out there with our health</p>
<p>   set up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No government, State or Federal, ever closes the book on health</p>
<p>   policy, and never says "Look we've done everything that</p>
<p>   needs to be done". Public hospitals are the responsibility</p>
<p>   of State Governments; it's our job to give them money. We offered</p>
<p>   them, and we are in fact delivering, a real increase of 15 % over</p>
<p>   five years at a time of zero inflation so they can't argue</p>
<p>   that they're going backwards. We put money into private health</p>
<p>   insurance incentives. The number of people in private health insurance</p>
<p>   has continued to go down, although it would have gone down at a</p>
<p>   much faster rate without those incentives. All of these areas continue</p>
<p>   to be, I guess, under almost weekly examination by the Government.</p>
<p>   And I said a moment ago you can never close the book and say there's</p>
<p>   no more to be done on health. But I do understand that it's</p>
<p>   an issue the public is very involved in and very concerned about,</p>
<p>   and the public regards a balanced provision of public and private</p>
<p>   health support as being a very important part of their daily lives.</p>
<p>   I do understand that.</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Are you frustrated by this ongoing blue between Michael Wooldridge</p>
<p>   and the State and Territory Health Ministers because while that</p>
<p>   keeps going it seems that this perception of instability in terms</p>
<p>   of public health funding doesn't go away? I mean the people</p>
<p>   who are lying on trolley beds in emergency hospitals, emergency</p>
<p>   wards rather, are saying, "Look what on earth's going</p>
<p>   on here, why can't they just sort this out and get on with</p>
<p>   it?"</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would rather it were not going on, but in a Federation you always</p>
<p>   get State Governments having a go at Federal Governments. No matter</p>
<p>   who the Federal Government is and no matter what the political colour</p>
<p>   of the State Government. It's an easy hit to say to your constituency,</p>
<p>   "We'd love to give you more but ..."</p>
<p>MCCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Exactly right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>"...the mean distant, remote Canberra-based Federal Government</p>
<p>   won't give us the money." Forgetting sometimes, of course,</p>
<p>   that that mean remote Canberra-based Federal Government is composed,</p>
<p>   amongst other things, o</p>
