PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
RESPONSE TO CIVICS EXPERT GROUP REPORT, 6 JUNE 1995<br />
Thank you for your invitation to address this conference today. Your<br />
discussions concern matters of great importance to Australia, and I am as<br />
grateful for your interest in them as I am for the invitation.<br />
That we set in train the process which has led to this investment in Civics<br />
Education gives me great satisfaction. From the Government's point of view<br />
it has been a special project: and it is one which has already produced<br />
considerable rewards.<br />
The big returns will come later of course: but to have received a report of<br />
such quality from the Civics Expert Group and so promptly, and to have<br />
generated such interest, activity and good-will has made this a particularly<br />
gratifying initiative.<br />
Sometimes in politics at least in the politics of reform you strike a seam<br />
immediately. I have no doubt that we have struck one with Civics Education.<br />
The response is proof of an urgent need better still, the report and your<br />
presence here, proves that we have the capacity to deal with it.<br />
One hundred years ago, the Australian people were engaged in a debate of<br />
great moment. Whether the peoples of six separate colonies could find within<br />
themselves the courage and confidence to come together as one nation one<br />
indissoluble Federal Commonwealth.<br />
These Australians were also engaged with the worst drought in Australia's<br />
history, the worst depression, the most traumatic strikes and lockouts and<br />
the usual business of living. They nevertheless found that it was possible to<br />
cope with these oppressive circumstances and still carry out their democratic<br />
responsibilities.<br />
Their general education levels were much lower than those of today's<br />
Australians: their means of personal advancement were much more limited.<br />
The imperatives of daily life were at least as demanding. Yet they made a<br />
decision about the future of Australia. They made a responsible political </p>
<p>decision, an informed decision what we would call these days, a visionary<br />
decision. While their political leaders attended conventions to thrash out their<br />
differences and frame a federated Australia, around the continent ordinary<br />
Australians talked about it in their homes and work places, in the pub and at<br />
the races.<br />
And when the referendum was put to them, they voted for the " one<br />
indissoluble Commonwealth" of Australia.<br />
From where we now stand one hundred years later that appears to have been<br />
a most enlightened decision. What is more, on the basis of evidence which<br />
the Civics Expert Group has discovered, we are justified in wondering<br />
whether, with all their educational advantages and opportunities, our own<br />
generation of Australians know as much about the virtues of democracy and<br />
the potential of Australia as those of the 1890s. I suspect they don't.<br />
That is not a reflection on Australians, but on our education systems. It may<br />
also be a comment on the modern condition. There is no doubt that in<br />
Australia, as elsewhere in the developed world, many people, especially<br />
young people, are alienated from their political system and from their past.<br />
We have to correct this. Governments alone cannot put meaning and<br />
purpose into the lives of the young but they can help. They can certainly help<br />
create the conditions in which faith might flourish. If you teach history well<br />
you can help young people believe that they have a part in the nation's story.<br />
If you teach politics well you can help them to feel engaged. You can help<br />
them to feel that they have influence. We can help young people and<br />
migrants discover their attachment to this country and its traditions, and give<br />
them hope about its future and theirs. We can help them see that in the<br />
fulfilment of their hopes lies the hope of the country.<br />
Before the Civics Expert Group attempted to set down what Australians<br />
should know about our system of government, they sought to find out what<br />
Australians already know.<br />
The results of the Group's research are distressing. Of the Australians<br />
interviewed: Only 19% showed any understanding of the effect of federation on<br />
Australia's system of government.<br />
Only 18% displayed any understanding of the content of the Constitution<br />
Only 40% could correctly recall the names of both federal houses of<br />
parliament. Only 24% knew that the Senate represents the States. </p>
<p>Only 28% perceived judicial independence.<br />
And only 33% felt reasonably informed about the rights and<br />
responsibilities of Australian citizens.<br />
It is clear that the archive of civic knowledge is close to empty.<br />
And it would seem that our education systems are doing very little to re-fill it.<br />
I have been told about a survey in Victoria which reveals that the number of<br />
Year Twelve students studying Australian history has fallen from 42 per cent<br />
in 1972 to 6 per cent in 1993 and it is still falling. The same sort of pattern<br />
reveals itself in the numbers studying politics.<br />
Now, I probably don't have to tell this audience that we are currently engaged<br />
in a much more modest undertaking than that of our predecessors one<br />
hundred years ago. We are not creating a nation and writing a constitution<br />
for it. We want no more than to persuade Australians that their head of state,<br />
and the head of state they bequeath to the Australians of the twenty first<br />
century, should be an Australian.<br />
Remarkably enough, there are some in positions of political leadership who<br />
find themselves unable to share this ambition or support us in our efforts.<br />
This is making a relatively simple step a more complicated one and I<br />
sometimes think we should give thanks that these people were not our<br />
leaders in the 1890s.<br />
By contrast we can give thanks to Stuart Maclntyre, Susan Pascoe, Ken<br />
Boston and all those people gathered here who want to see Australian<br />
democracy advance. Who want to see our young people learn enough about<br />
Australia's history, traditions, values and institutions to feel that they have a<br />
stake in our future and can play a part in shaping it.<br />
The report of the Civics Expert Group, Whereas the People, may yet prove to<br />
be the means by which we find the way to engage them.<br />
As I said when I first received it, this Report is a credit to its authors.<br />
It is also an invitation to Australian governments, and a challenge to the<br />
Australian people.<br />
In responding to Whereas the People I think we should set ourselves a<br />
national goal. Not one that will be easily measured, admittedly; but one<br />
which, if we come close to achieving it, will pay obvious dividends. I think we<br />
should dedicate ourselves to seeing that by the end of the century the<br />
Australian people know as much about their country and are no less engaged<br />
in its political life than their counterparts a century ago. </p>
<p>A comprehensive civics and citizenship education program is the best start<br />
we can have.<br />
We can give young Australians a knowledge of their past and a sense of<br />
where they belong in the story. We can tell them about the gift of Australian<br />
democracy and how it should be defended. We can imbue them with a faith<br />
in the core values of Australia not a conformist ideology, but an awareness<br />
of the principles of freedom and tolerance which are still emerging in our<br />
community. If we can do this we can help to keep ownership of the Australian political<br />
system with the Australian people. We can keep the democracy alive and<br />
that old value of egalitarianism functioning and with new meaning, with<br />
women and new migrants and Aboriginal Australians included in the ethos<br />
that used to keep them out.<br />
Let me tell you the Government regards Civics Education as one of its major<br />
initiatives. In a tight budget we have provided $ 25 million for a civics and<br />
citizenship education program in line with the expert group's<br />
recommendation. The program spans all formal education sectors and the<br />
broader community.<br />
The centrepiece is $ 20.26 million for a program of Civics Education in<br />
Schools, to be administered in close cooperation with State and Territory<br />
Governments. The Expert Group said that schools are the key to this undertaking. The<br />
Government agrees.<br />
It should be an essential part of each child's education to learn about the<br />
privileges and responsibilities of being Australian.<br />
That does not mean an exercise in ideology, but lessons in democracy and<br />
history. Civics, properly taught, is no more political than Maths or English or<br />
Woodwork. And it is just as fundamental; in a society like ours it is just as<br />
important.<br />
The Government does not pretend that it will be easy to create an effective<br />
schools civics program. As the Expert Group reminded us, other programs<br />
have withered on the vine.<br />
The challenge for the Curriculum Corporation is to develop a program which<br />
is practical, comprehensive and engaging. It will have to look to the new<br />
media for assistance and we welcome that.<br />
But there will never be a substitute for good teaching, and the $ 5.2 million we<br />
are spending on the professional development of teachers of Civics is<br />
essential. It must all be a cooperative effort. School education is primarily </p>
<p>the responsibility of the States and Territories, and we look forward to<br />
working with them.<br />
The Government will also be providing $ 2.4 million over four years to produce<br />
materials on civics for citizenship applicants and to develop voluntary civics<br />
and citizenship education courses for those who want to become Australian<br />
citizens. There is also $ 2.3 million for community education initiatives, to be<br />
administered by a committee with expertise in Australian culture, heritage and<br />
government. Let me close these brief remarks by thanking all those who have contributed<br />
to the Expert Group's report, this conference and what we might now<br />
reasonably call a civics movement.<br />
I said that I have the feeling we have struck a seam: there is no doubt about<br />
the need for civics education, and equally no doubt that both educators and<br />
parents want to meet that demand.<br />
The Expert Group consulted widely and consultation will be a feature of the<br />
Government's civics program. For more than three months we have taken<br />
submissions on the findings of the Expert Group. Almost all of them have<br />
been supportive.<br />
My colleague, the Minister for Employment Education and Training, has<br />
briefed all State and Territory Education Ministers on the Government's<br />
package. And we now propose a series of consultations, of which this forum<br />
is the first, to bring other key groups into the planning process.<br />
This is a large investment in our children, our democracy and our future.<br />
And I thank you all for contributing to it.<br />
Most of the reward is in the giving. But posterity will bequeath a small one<br />
too. As the Australians of the twenty first century look back on the 1990s they<br />
will see that a democratic spirit was alive and well in Australia as it had been<br />
a century before.<br />
And it is not unreasonable to think that, like us when we look back on the<br />
1890s, they might draw a bit of inspiration from it and be grateful that we<br />
invested in Civics Education. </p>
