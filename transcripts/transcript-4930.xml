FOR PRESS 18 DECEMBER 1978<br />
REPORT OF INQUIRY INTO WHALES AND WHALING<br />
The Prime Minister today released the Report of the<br />
Inquiry into Whales and Whaling which has recently been<br />
completed under the chairmanship of Sir Sydney Frost.<br />
The Inquiry's principal conclusion is that Australian<br />
whaling should cease and that internationally Australia<br />
should pursue a policy of opposition to whaling.<br />
Other major recommendations in the Report are that<br />
whaling should be prohibited within Australia's 200 mile<br />
fishing zone, that, if the waters of the Australian<br />
Antarctic Territory are included in the fishing zone, this<br />
policy should also apply in that area, and that Australia<br />
should seek to achieve greater worldwide protection<br />
for all cetacea.<br />
Mr. Fraser said that the Government will, early in the<br />
New Year, be reviewing Australia's whaling policy<br />
in the light of the Report's recommendations.<br />
The Prime Minister added that copies of the Report<br />
have been sent to the Premiers and interested groups<br />
who had assisted the Inquiry. Comments from the<br />
States were essential to the Government's review of<br />
its policy with respect to whales. 000---</p>
