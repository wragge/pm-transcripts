<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How would you describe what you've seen here today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Heart breaking. To walk into somebody's home and to see the absolute</p>
<p> destruction and to hear the tales of how a house that's taken</p>
<p> people five years to lovingly put together wiped out in a few minutes,</p>
<p> I think it's very heartbreaking. But what is uplifting at the</p>
<p> same time is the tremendous spirit of these people. They're determined</p>
<p> to overcome the setback and the adversity. And I just want them to</p>
<p> know that the rest of Australia is thinking of them. I mean, it's</p>
<p> an act of God, a natural disaster but the rest of the country feels</p>
<p> for them and the rest of the country, through the Government, is willing</p>
<p> to do practical things to help them.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, can you elaborate on what options you expect this meeting</p>
<p> with the banks and the insurance companies to come out with?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's a problem and it's a problem that's got</p>
<p> to be addressed by the Government and it's a problem that's</p>
<p> got to be addressed by the sections of the business community, in</p>
<p> a broader sense, that are there. The insurance companies and the bank,</p>
<p> I just want to sit down and have a talk to them. I think there is</p>
<p> a particular problem and it needs to be addressed and at a time like</p>
<p> this everybody's expected to play their part.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The business people are worried about being offered yet more loans.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I understand that and I listened very carefully to what they had to</p>
<p> say. I'm not at this stage going to pre-empt what is going to</p>
<p> come out of that discussion. But let me make it clear that it's</p>
<p> one of these situations where everybody's got to pitch in and</p>
<p> make a contribution. The Government is willing to do that. The Northern</p>
<p> Territory Government, under the leadership of Mr Stone and Mr Reid,</p>
<p> the local member, have done a magnificent job. I mean, as I've</p>
<p> gone around Katherine today every single person I've spoken to</p>
<p> just about has said, please thank Shane Stone and Mike Reid for what</p>
<p> they have done and how they've shared the pain and the suffering</p>
<p> and the difficulty of the citizens of this town. And they've</p>
<p> done their part. We're willing to play our part. And there are</p>
<p> others that I hope I'm sure will play their part as well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, just on another thing. What are your thoughts overnight</p>
<p> on the waterfront issue?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>This country needs a more efficient and a more competitive and a more</p>
<p> productive waterfront. And I fully support the efforts of any Australians</p>
<p> who want to go into business on the waterfront and provide competition</p>
<p> and provide better services. And we have changed the law of this country</p>
<p> to allow that to happen. And I simply say to everybody involved, play</p>
<p> according to the law, remember the Australian national interest and</p>
<p> not your own personal interests all the time and we'll have an</p>
<p> outcome that's good for Australia and good for the economic future</p>
<p> of this country in a very uncertain economic region.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What legal advice, if any, has the Federal Government been seeking</p>
<p> over this matter?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not going to go into all the detail of that. I mean, look,</p>
<p> as far as the law is concerned, we made a new law, it was passed by</p>
<p> the Parliament and it's a very effective new law. I mean, I particularly</p>
<p> applaud the decision of the full bench of the Industrial Relations</p>
<p> Commission on the Rio Tinto case. It's a benchmark decision.</p>
<p> But we have got a new law, a better law, a law for the future. And</p>
<p> providing people act within that law they are perfectly entitled to</p>
<p> start new businesses.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, there was a report this morning in the Sydney Morning</p>
<p> Herald that the Government's prepared to offer up to $100</p>
<p> million to stevedoring companies if they were to make MUA members</p>
<p> redundant. Are you able to comment on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I haven't read that report. I think you ought to ask Mr Reith</p>
<p> that.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
