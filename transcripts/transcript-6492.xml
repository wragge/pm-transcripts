TRANSCRIPT -PRESS CONFERENCE -8October 1984<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
Well ladies and gentlemen any q'j1estions?<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke why do you e'xpect the Australian people to<br />
re-elect you on 1 December--<br />
Because we have delivered the promise that we made to the<br />
Australian people during the election campaign in February-March<br />
of 1983. We said to a sorely divided nation which had suffered<br />
the tragedy of confrontation that we would achieve nation~ al<br />
reconciliation. And on that basis of bringing Australians<br />
together again we would then bring economic recovery and<br />
reconstruction to this country. We have been spectacularly<br />
successful in dcing that. We've changed this country from having<br />
zero economic growth to making the economy, which is growing<br />
faster than any other in the western world, and we've done that: on<br />
the basis of reconciliation. We're at the lowest level of<br />
industrial disputation for 16 years. People now recognise in the<br />
business sector and in the trade unions that their legitimate<br />
aspirations for improving their profitability and their standards<br />
are best achieved by working together co-operatively with one<br />
another and with Government. That's the promise that we've<br />
delivered and I believe that the people are grateful for the<br />
change in this country. It's an infinitely better country now<br />
than it was at the beginning of 1983.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister after this one how long before the<br />
next election another two years. Or are you going to try and<br />
run a full-term.<br />
No, well you see what I've been about is to say that wit~ h<br />
this election which is being held now to have the half Senate and<br />
the House of Representatives together, this will be the 23rd time<br />
in Australia's history that this has been done. We are running<br />
with the election campaign a referendum for simultaneous elections<br />
and I believe that in that situation, then Governments in the<br />
future will be in a position where they will be able to avoid the<br />
unnecessary elections that have occurred in the past. We'll have<br />
less elections and that would mean that with the election at t1-e<br />
end of 1984 we'd be going up to the end of: 1987 or early ' 88. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister what do you expect the result will be?<br />
Well I believe that we will win. Now I could if I wanted<br />
to be be excessively optimistic and talk about margins on the<br />
basis of polls. But we will be going9 in to this election campaign<br />
hard and fair. We'll be putting two messages across. We'll be<br />
putting the message of our tremendous achievements in the econcmic<br />
and social field and in the field of' international relations.<br />
We'll be putting that positively and we will be comparing our<br />
great records of achievement with both the record of our<br />
opposition in the past in Government, which was deplorable, and<br />
with what they now offer to the Australian people. They offer the<br />
dismantling, totally, of all the apparatus which has been<br />
foundational to the recovery of Australia._ They want to smash the<br />
Accord, they want to get rid of the Economic Planning Advisory<br />
Council, the Prices Surveillance Authority all the mechanisms;<br />
which have served to bring the great interests of Australia<br />
constructively together. We'll be pointing out to the people that<br />
that is a miserable alterna tive.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister what are the issues, what should bE!<br />
the issues and what should not be the issues.<br />
Well the issues should be basically economic performance<br />
because that is what the people of Australia are concerned about.<br />
They are concerned about jobs, and will make the judgement about<br />
the loss of about a quarter of a million jobs the growth of a<br />
quarter of million in unemployment in the last twelve months of:<br />
the previous government with the creation of about a quarter of<br />
a million new jobs under us. They are concerned with inflation<br />
the fact that we've halved the inflation rate from over 11% that<br />
we inherited down to less than half that. They are concerned, I<br />
believe, with interest rates the fact that we have brought<br />
interest rates down from the record levels of the previous<br />
Government. These are the basic sorts of things. They are<br />
certainly concerned about housing, both in the private and the<br />
public sector the fact that we'vye in the public housing sector<br />
in our first two years given an enor-mous increase in the funds<br />
available for public housing for those most in need, and under the<br />
First Home Owners' Scheme we've brought about a situation which<br />
the housing industry as a whole recognises has produced the best<br />
situation in memory from where the housing industry was<br />
operating at less than 60% of capacity when we came to office -to<br />
where it's now operating at full capacity and in a way which has<br />
brought the possibility of home ownership into the range o-f people<br />
who before were faced with hopelessness in this regard. Those are<br />
the basic sorts of things. But they will also be concerned with<br />
the way in which we have made Australia's name proud in the field<br />
of international relations. We are better regarded now in our<br />
region than Australia has ever been before as a result not only of<br />
the personal relationships that I've established with leaders in<br />
this region, but also of the work that's been done by my Foreign<br />
Minister and other relevant Ministers, including the Deputy Prime<br />
Minister, Mr Bowen. Our relationship with the United States has<br />
-A </p>
<p>P. M. cont brought about a pcsi,-ion where Australia's<br />
relations with the United States are better and more const active<br />
than they've ever been before. So , hether you look at these<br />
important domestic issues or our international relationships,<br />
these are the things of importance, these are the things we'll be<br />
campaigning on. The last part of your question was what shouldn't<br />
be the issues. Well I think it goes without saying that I believe<br />
that issues of race, racial intolerance, whether it be in regard<br />
to people outside Australia, or between black and white people in<br />
Australia those should not be the issues. And I believe that:<br />
the politics of smear and guilt by association should not be the<br />
issues. And I would have thought, as I indicated in the House<br />
today, that those on the opposite side of the Parliament should<br />
have learnt by now that that sort of thing is not what the<br />
Australian people want. The indications are crystal clear thait in<br />
the attempt to go down those paths the opposition have hurt<br />
themselves. And I sincerely hope Ehiat they will have learnt that<br />
lesson and they'll get back on to the sorts of issues that I've<br />
been talking about.<br />
JOURNALIST: In that respect, Mr Hawke, it seems the Opposition is<br />
going to pursue organised crime regardless. What damage do you<br />
think that will do in the on-going Murphy inquiry.<br />
Well the fact what damage will it do to the inquiry?<br />
JOURNALIST: No, what damage do you think the Opposition can<br />
inflict upon you in respect of the organised crime debate and also<br />
how do you think the on-going Murphy inquiry will affect the<br />
conduct.. Well that's the other way around. Well, let me answer the<br />
first one on the basis of the evidence available. They couldn't<br />
have pursued the question of organised crime more vociferously<br />
than they have. And it's not working. And it's not working<br />
because the people of Australia know what is obvious in a crystal<br />
clear manner. And that is that I, as Prime minister, and my<br />
Government have a total commitment to fighting organised crime in<br />
an effective way. No Australian would make the judgement that I<br />
would be other than in that position. There is no-one more<br />
committed than I am to ensuring that we pursue the processes of<br />
getting hard admissible evidence which is going to get criminals<br />
behind bars. That's what I'm about and what my Government's about<br />
and the people know that. So if the Opposition attempts to go<br />
further down that track they will suffer further the results that<br />
are already clear. Now in regard to the question of the Murphy<br />
inquiry there the position is that the Senate Committee and its<br />
processes should proceed. And I had said in regard to the whole<br />
range of areas where criminal matters or other matters of the<br />
inquiry are being followed, I've said and I repeat again, and I<br />
know the Australian people accept it, let the cards fall where<br />
they may I and my Government are not in the business of<br />
protecting anyone, whatever their position or station in life.<br />
Let proper inquiries be pursued and let the results then lead to </p>
<p>P. M. cont whatever prosecutions may be? necessary. But let me<br />
say in all t-hat, that we are ne,. er un(' er the pressure of this<br />
McCarthyist smear tactic of t. ie Opposition going to pre-judge<br />
individuals because it is an enormous price! for a society to pay<br />
that in the legitimate pursuit of organised crime, or misbehavizour<br />
at any level of society, that in legitimately pur su4ng that course<br />
of action which I will in every way open to me at the federal<br />
level, that you should go to the next aind unacceptable stage of<br />
pre-judging people on the basis of smear or innuendo or<br />
allegations that haven't had the chance of being tested. And I<br />
believe that overwhelmingly the people of Australia do not want<br />
that course to be followed. It is, in other words, necessary thiat<br />
we do the two things in this country that we gather our<br />
resources in a way which is going to enable! hard admissible<br />
evidence to be produced so that the courts of the land can in fact<br />
pursue those engaged in crime and organised crime, and at the same<br />
time as we're doing that in pursuingj it without any equivocation<br />
we must ensure that the proper processes are available which both<br />
ensure that those undertaking inquiries are not going to have t'.. iem<br />
inhibited, but on the other hand ensure that the rights of<br />
individuals and civil liberties should be protected.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you believe Mr Wran pre-judged Mr Briese by his<br />
comments in London, Mr Hawke?<br />
I am not making any comment about Mr Wran's statement<br />
beyond what I've said in the Parliament. I've made it quite clear<br />
what my position is in regard to that matter. I'm not saying<br />
anything more about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, why do you feel it necessary to call the<br />
election now and not next year.<br />
Well do I need to go over the speech I've made in<br />
Parliament again?<br />
JOURNALIST: Well let's get in on record here.<br />
What on your tape you mean? I see. Alright. Well let mne<br />
make it as short as I can for your particular benefit. The<br />
Constitutional position is that there must be an election for half<br />
the Senate and that would have to be held by April of next year.<br />
And there would have to be, if we didn't have the House of<br />
Representatives election with the half Senate, then we'd have<br />
within a relatively short time after that about the end of the<br />
year have a House of Representatives election. Now that would<br />
cost an extra $ 19 million $ 49 million if you had two elections<br />
rather than about $ 30 million if you brought the two together.<br />
The other point is, of course, that this is the normal thing to<br />
do. It's normal to have the half Senate election at the end of<br />
the year preceding and in the special circumstance that we've got<br />
now with an enlarged Senate, where there are going to be two extra<br />
Senators from each State, then those two extra Senators cannot<br />
take their place in the Senate until the new House meets. Now if<br />
' t </p>
<p>P. M. cont we 1, ave the election of half: Senate in April of<br />
1985 ar d you didn't have the election of Tche House of<br />
Repr'-sentatives untii' the end of that year or early in 1986, you<br />
could have these twelve Senators there in l~ imbo for something up<br />
to 16 months. Now it's much more sensible. therefore, to do<br />
what's been done on 22 previous occasions n t le history of this<br />
country, the most normal thing that is, to have the House of<br />
Representatives and the half Senate toaether. And of course all<br />
of that has been done in the context of the election that's going<br />
to be held together with a referendum requ~ Iring simultaneous<br />
elections so that in the future we'll get rid of this business of<br />
putting elections out of kiltre between the House of<br />
Representatives and the Senate.<br />
JOURNALIST: During the campaign wil~ l you debate the Leader of the<br />
opposition on television?<br />
PM: I'm not making up my mind about that yet. I have indicated<br />
during the campaign before that that seemed to me to be an<br />
appropriate thing to do, but I simply say that the Leader of the<br />
opposition by his behaviour over recent times has, I believe, put<br />
himself beyond the pale of ordinary and recent codes of behaviour.<br />
but I have not made up my mind about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: In February ' 83, Mr Hawke, the Labor Party came<br />
pretty fast out of the blocks. Mr Peacock is talking now about: a<br />
pre-campaign. What is the idea behind the Labor Party right now?<br />
Are you going to just have a traditional sort of start? Are you<br />
going to start now?<br />
PM: Well, it won't be a full blown, if you like, total campaicin,<br />
but it obviously would be quite dishonest to say that we are not<br />
going to be acting with a view to the election on 1 December.<br />
That will be in everyone' s minds every party's and every<br />
politicians' mind. But the formal campaign, the formal launching<br />
of the campaign, will not take place until into November.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, when did you take your decision to make<br />
the announcement this afternoon?<br />
PM: I firmed it up really over the weekend and I obviously wanted<br />
to await the return of His Excellency the Governor-General today.<br />
It thought it appropriate that I should wait until his return.<br />
JOURNALIST: In your speech to the House today you made the point<br />
that there is a need to deal a final blow to the tax avoidance<br />
industry in this country. It has been pointed out in the Sena-ze<br />
by the Democrats that if you were fair dinkum about this you would<br />
have a double dissolution, thereby bringing those bills currently<br />
locked up there before a joint sitting of both Houses. </p>
<p>PM: I don't believe that a double dissolution is necessary or<br />
desirable. I mean, we want to limit this resort to unn-cessary<br />
elections. I would hope that after the election when' we are<br />
returned that it may be that the people in the Senate, and we may<br />
have a majority we will certainly be trying to get a majority in<br />
the election but even if we don't arid the Democrats hold the<br />
balance of power, I would be hoping that what I believe would be a<br />
clear decision on the part of the electors about the question of<br />
tax avoidance which will be very much ant issue in the election,<br />
let me assure you, may lead them to support our legislation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Having got the Senate and the Reps back in kilter,<br />
Mr Hawke, will you give a commitment now that the next term will<br />
be a full term and if you win that, there will be another full<br />
term after that this is the last early election?<br />
PM: Yes, that is what it is about. I mean, let's get the problem<br />
of the " out of kiltedness" if I can use that rather clumsy<br />
phrase behind us with the referendum being passed. And in that<br />
situation, yes, is the answer to your question.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would it really be in the interests of Australia to<br />
have an Opposition where it is reduced to about a third membership<br />
of the House of Representatives?<br />
PM: Well, it really depends, I suppose, on the quality of the<br />
opposition, doesn't it. And wae can only judge the product an-l<br />
what we have seen and it is pathetic. It is insulting to the<br />
intelligence of the electorate and I would think in those<br />
circumstances you don't want more of that. So we will be going in<br />
hard to win as big a majority as we possibly can. And I express<br />
this hope that out of the election, however decimated they may<br />
be, that the Opposition parties will do two things. That they<br />
will try and get better quality people into their ranks. And<br />
secondly, that they will review the judgement of the Australian~<br />
people, because the Australian people have repudiated their<br />
tactics and the concepts of what an opposition should be about.<br />
And this, I hope, will be a learning process for them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, as you know, a shipment of uranium<br />
to France is due this month. Does you Government intend to issue<br />
an export licence to allow the shipment to go ahead. If not, ' That<br />
sort of compensation does the Government intend..<br />
PM: The Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Walsh,. wil * L<br />
be, I think, making an announcement in regard to this matter, out<br />
it will not involve an export licence to them to export to France.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you say the overwhelming reason for an<br />
early election is your Government's need for a new and reinvigorating<br />
mandate. Does that mean that whenever a governmen~ t<br />
in the future feels the need for a new and re-invigorating<br />
mandate, they can use this as an excuse for an early election? </p>
<p>PM: No, I think you ought to read the whole statement throuyh a<br />
bit more closely and you will find the answer to your question.,<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are y(, u prel3icting an increased majority<br />
apart from any difference made by the extra seats?<br />
PM: I believe we will improve our majority apart from that, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you still believe there will bE!<br />
very little change in your Ministry after the election, if you<br />
win? PM: What was that last bit.<br />
JOURNALIST: He's Irish.<br />
PM: Yes, I would think there would-be not much change. I have? to<br />
repeat. In this matter I am in the hands of the Caucus in the<br />
first step. They have to make a decision. I would think that the<br />
judgement of the Caucus would be that the Ministry had done an<br />
excellent job and therefore I would expect the Caucus to be<br />
endorsing overwhelmingly that Ministry. So the question really<br />
becomes would there be much of a re-shuffle. And I would think,<br />
not a great deal because I think it has been a very successful<br />
team.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are you attracted to the idea of a larger<br />
Ministry? PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, did the sort of headlines that Mr Wran was<br />
likely to get in tomorrow's press in any way influence your<br />
decison to announce the election today?<br />
PM: No, it had absolutely nothing to do with it. And I would<br />
have thought that was quite clear.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, in the light of the pressures and so on that<br />
have been on you personally in the last few weeks, how do you feel<br />
about a campaign?<br />
PM: I feel great. I feel great, thank you. I hope it was asked<br />
solicitously, that is why I say thank you.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, would you be prepared to name3 a<br />
bottom line below which you would regard it as a bad result for<br />
the ALP?<br />
PM: No, of course not.<br />
JOURNALIST: Who do you think will be your opponent across the<br />
table after the next after the next election? </p>
<p>PM: I think the books have the Member for flennelong at fairly<br />
short odds, but there is just one point I would make. He has got<br />
to win his seat first.<br />
JOURNALIST: What role will Mr Wran be playing in the election?<br />
PM: He is President of the Party. He will be there on the<br />
platform at the opening of the campaign, as he was on the last<br />
occasion and I would think it would be fairly similar to the last<br />
occasion. After the opening I think it fairly well rolled into my<br />
lap and I guess that will be much the same way again with support<br />
from my Minister.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, in your statement to the House<br />
today, you made the point there repeatedly o; f the vested interest<br />
in undermining the new spirit of national confidence and selfconfidence.<br />
In the very next sentence you said " I believe the<br />
people of Australia have already realised the nature and purpose<br />
of this campaign of denigration". Are you referring to the<br />
denigration of yourself and identifyin': that. as the prime cause of<br />
sel-confidence in the nation.<br />
PM: No, no.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is the denigration you are! referring to?)<br />
PM: Well I think there is a whole campaign that has becn adopted<br />
by the Opposition of insinuating against everyone in government<br />
that there is something improper in wha they do. I mean, you take<br />
the question of the decision that we have made to merge the work<br />
of the Costigan Commission in with the work of the National Crime<br />
Authority. As I said, there can be legitimEate discussion about<br />
the timing and the process of doing that, but no room for<br />
questioning peoples' motives, but that is what they have done.<br />
And I would simply say, Max, that I believe the evidence is<br />
overwhelming that this sort of approach which questions the<br />
decencies and the motives of government to try and undermine<br />
confidence in government is something that has rebounded against<br />
the Opposition.<br />
JOURNALIST: Hav2 you any more idea when the Costigan Report is<br />
likely to be released?<br />
PM: Commissioner Costigan has indicated that he would hope he<br />
would have it ready before the end of October and I have no reason<br />
to believe that won't be the case. Now, I have made it clear that<br />
I want to see the release of the report as soon as possible. Now,<br />
I have indicated, and I remind you, that we will not only have the<br />
recommendations of Commissioner Costigan as to what should or<br />
should not be published, but it will be referred in addition to<br />
the National Crime Authority, the Director of Public Prosecutions<br />
and to the AFP and to the Attorney-General's Department. Now, I<br />
am not sure that I can say with absolute precision what is the<br />
outside amount of time that those various authorities will want to<br />
. A '? t0 4~ i* v </p>
<p>P. M. cont look at it and to make their recommendations to it,<br />
but I wouldn't think it would be more than two or three lays.<br />
So, I would be hoping that within two or three days of the receipt<br />
of the Report that we would be in a position to make the decision<br />
as to what parts on the recommendation of those authorities<br />
would not be released, for the same reasons as our predecessor<br />
government didn't do it and then we will take steps to see how<br />
that then can be released to the public by whatever mechanism is<br />
available to us.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you seek a resolution of the House before it<br />
rises to enable the powers of privilege of the Upper House to be<br />
extended for the Report, if that is necessary?<br />
PM: No, there is one way in which it is suggested we may be able<br />
to do this, Mike, and that is a mechanism via the Speaker. There<br />
will be one of the ways that we will~ look at because it is quite<br />
important. We want it. We want it published as fully as we can<br />
and as soon as we can and we will just have to look at what<br />
mechanism will be available to do that. But I don't think it is<br />
a question of the resolution of the House in advance but I think<br />
there may be another mechanism of doing it. There are a range of<br />
opportunities that may be available to it. All I am saying<br />
giving the . commitment that we want it released as fully as it can<br />
be on the basis of the advice to us.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, given that you have had your differences<br />
with New Zealand Prime Minister, David Lanqe, does it surprise it<br />
that today he announced your election on November 24?<br />
PM: Well, it is just another area in which he can have a mistaken<br />
view of things. .1 </p>
