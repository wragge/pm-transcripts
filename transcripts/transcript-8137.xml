PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION, DIETMEMBERS<br />
ASSOCIATION BREAKFAST, ANA HOTEL, TOKYO<br />
19 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
QUESTION: We are very glad to receive Prime Minister<br />
Hawke. You are most welcome to Japan. I recently came<br />
back from the US. I met the people from the Department<br />
of State and the Pentagon. When I talked about Japanese<br />
self-defence forces with them, I heard Australia agreed<br />
the sending of Japanese self-defence forces. I don't<br />
know who said what kind of things about that...<br />
Japanese constitution that it is very difficult for us to<br />
send self-defence forces that Australia has<br />
particular statement. But if Prime minister Hawke could<br />
tell us who particularly made the statement that<br />
Australia agreed to the sending of the Japanese selfdefence<br />
forces, if you would be kind enough to explain to<br />
US.<br />
PM: Thank you very much. It's important that you<br />
understand precisely what was said on this matter. In<br />
Australia I was asked about this situation and I was<br />
asked about it in a context where there had been<br />
observations in the press within Australia and<br />
internationally some speculation that Japan may<br />
contemplate sending mine sweepers. I went out of my way<br />
to say that what Japan does in regard to the Gulf is a<br />
matter for Japan. I want all of you to understand that<br />
it is not appropriate for Australia or for any other<br />
nation to tell Japan what it should do. I understand<br />
very clearly the sensitivities within Japan on this<br />
issue. And anyone who doesn't understand those<br />
sensitivities doesn't understand very much about your<br />
country. I do understand that. So I want to make it<br />
quite clear that there's no attempt on my part or on the<br />
part of the Government or the people of Australia to seek<br />
in any way to tell Japan what it should do. This is a<br />
matter which you must decide according to your own<br />
counsels and your own deliberations. What I was seeking<br />
to say and which I take this opportunity of saying to<br />
you, is if Japan, if Japan out of its own processes were<br />
to come to a conclusion that it wanted to make some such<br />
contribution, some such involvement, I want Japan to know<br />
that from the point of view of Australia such a decision<br />
would be acceptable. I hope that you clearly understand<br />
therefore the nature of what I'm saying. I repeat, </p>
<p>succinctly I hope, these things are a matter f or Japan.<br />
It is understood that they are matters and issues of<br />
sensitivities within Japan. But simply, having said<br />
that, if you are going to come to that decision, you<br />
should know that within our environment in Australia, we<br />
would understand and accept such a decision.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister Hawke in a very healthy,<br />
good condition. And indeed we are very happy to see you<br />
once again. When I was the Minister for Agriculture,<br />
Fisheries and Forestry I had the opportunity of having<br />
various discussions with Minister Kerin. I was recalling<br />
what the discussions opening of the beef market to<br />
Australia.. Australia was very happy. So I have been<br />
expecting that perhaps my statue would be built in<br />
Australia because I have contributed much to the market.<br />
But in Japan I was somehow given the role of the villain.<br />
I have been having a very hard time. When I think about<br />
the present situation as Prime Minister Hawke rightly<br />
pointed out. We have to make great efforts, must make a<br />
great effort to make the Uruguay Round of GATT<br />
negotiations a success. But we have to of course place<br />
importance on our own resources. We have to think of our<br />
own country. The cultures of deficient nations. We<br />
have to think of what problems they have, human rights.<br />
All those things must be firmly asserted on the occasions<br />
of negotiations and based upon such discussion our<br />
own sovereignty and rights. We have to assert our own<br />
position. Australia assert her own sovereignty,<br />
her rights and we have been able to successfully maintain<br />
and out relationship. But I think we follow that<br />
example, learn from that relationship. I myself<br />
feel that trade issues, trade related issues. Of<br />
course we have to think of the logic and rationale of the<br />
** And then I think we should think in the<br />
country's population much problem, serious problem.<br />
** issue of food. So how can we strike a balance<br />
amongst all these different issues, three different<br />
* areas difficult Australia have no for<br />
its own population a helping hand aid<br />
population a great issue. We have most respect for that<br />
pay tribute to that. I do hope Prime Minister<br />
send my best regards to your Minister Kerin, my good<br />
friend............ continue the political leadership in<br />
ycoounrg ractouunltartye, yowuh icPhr imies Main niesntoerrm. o us Antads ki. n thIe last<br />
election you had a victory, the Australian Labor Party<br />
had a victory. You are continuing on with your political<br />
leadership. I would like to pay my deepest tribute and<br />
respect to your leadership. one of the campaign issues<br />
in the election was the so-called Multi-function Polis.<br />
The problem associated with the Multi-function Polis came<br />
up especially raised by the Leader of the opposition<br />
Party. During the election campaign many discussions took<br />
place. At least I was informed of that. Many things<br />
were argued. So on one hand there is a concept of MFP<br />
between Japan and Australia and that could become an<br />
election issue. That means that in Australia Japanese </p>
<p>entry into Australia in economic affairs is met with some<br />
resistance by the Australian people. Am I correct in<br />
interpreting that there is some of resistance amongst<br />
the Australia public regarding the economic entry of<br />
Japan into your country. of course during the election<br />
campaign Prime Minister Hawke defended the Multi-function<br />
Polis. But could you explain the situation.. When we<br />
think of the future of economic relations between Japan<br />
and Australia, this point is very important. So I wanted<br />
to raise this point.<br />
PM: Thank you very much for that question. Could I just<br />
briefly make an observation in response to the previous<br />
observation and then come to your question. I thank you<br />
very much for your references to your discussions with Mr<br />
Kerin and let me say quite directly, and in the spirit of<br />
I think, frankness and directness which we in Australia<br />
and Japan can talk with one another, we have been<br />
critical in the past of Japan, North America and Europe<br />
in regard to agricultural protectionism. But I hope that<br />
you will understand and recall the way in which we have<br />
spoken very affirmatively of the liberalisation steps<br />
that have been taken by Japan. We are conscious of them<br />
and to some considerable extent in the area of beef and<br />
of manufactured products we are the beneficiaries of the<br />
liberalisation that has occurred. But equally we are<br />
going to say that we always think that further steps can<br />
be taken. We trust that that will happen because we do<br />
seriously believe that the freeing up of the<br />
internatioial trading system is not merely something to<br />
be perceived in terms of what does it mean for each<br />
other. But I think if history does teach us one thing,<br />
it does teach us that a resort to economic autarky of<br />
increasing protectionism can be the precursor not only to<br />
economic problems but to political conflict. So we, all<br />
of us, have a vested interest in doing what we can. We<br />
in Australia are reviewing the whole of our positions.<br />
0 We will be moving to further liberalisation and we hope<br />
that that sort of thing is going to be reflected here and<br />
elsewhere. But now if I can come to your question. I<br />
appreciate the directness and the frankness of the<br />
question and it's a proper question to put to the Prime<br />
MAinister of Australia visiting Japan. I will be<br />
absolutely direct and honest in my reply with you. It<br />
was an issue that arose in the election. You mentioned<br />
the Leader of the Opposition. It was not a matter which<br />
was really raised by the Leader of the opposition, who I<br />
don't believe he, the then Leader of the Opposition was<br />
personally responsible for it. There was a weakness of<br />
leadership in the opposition. It arose as a perception<br />
by some people in the opposition that there may be some<br />
political mileage to be obtained through fanning some<br />
attitudes of racist intolerance. The failure of<br />
leadership was not in raising it. The failure of<br />
leadership was in not squashing it. It is unfortunately<br />
true that in some sectors of Australia there are these<br />
sentiments of opposition to foreign involvement in </p>
<p>Australia in general and in some areas particularly to<br />
Japan. But I hope that you will be aware that I in<br />
particular, but my Government in general, has been<br />
steadfast in accepting the responsibilities of<br />
leadership. I have said in Australia and I take this<br />
opportunity of saying here in Japan, that if any<br />
Australian wanted to be short-sighted in the extreme in a<br />
proper assessment of their own self-interests and the<br />
self-interests of their children into the future, it<br />
would be for them to pursue an attitude of resentment and<br />
opposition to co-operation with Japan and of opposition<br />
to Japanese investment and involvement in the development<br />
of the Australian economy. Because not only for this<br />
generation but moreso for our next generations, their<br />
welfare and indeed their standards of living and quality<br />
of life is-going to depend upon the way in which together<br />
we can co-operate, how we can marry not merely our<br />
material resources but increasingly our very significant<br />
fundamental scientific and research capacity with your<br />
magnificent record and capacity for applying science and<br />
technology, commercialising it. Australia's future<br />
depends very much upon the way in which we can co-operate<br />
together. So there are moral considerations in this. We<br />
live in an interconnected and interdependent world and it<br />
is morally right that we should recognise that it's a<br />
world in which any concepts of division or discrimination<br />
based upon race, colour or creed are abhorrent. There<br />
are those moral considerations. But overwhelmingly as<br />
well there are simple economic considerations of selfinterest.<br />
I can assure you that the overwhelming<br />
majority of Australians have responded to the leadership<br />
that we have given on this issue and which we will<br />
continue to give. I want you to know and I want all<br />
Japanese leaders and the people of Japan to know that as<br />
far as we are concerned we understand the fundamental<br />
importance of the relationship between our two countries.<br />
We recognise that our growth has been interconnected.<br />
That our opportunities for the future are interconnected.<br />
We welcome Japanese investment in Australia. The MFP has<br />
been mentioned. It was the peg upon which you hung your<br />
question. But it's not only in regard to the MFP that we<br />
want to see this co-operation and development. But we<br />
want to see that in a sense as merely one manifestation<br />
. of an increasing inter-relationship between our<br />
countries. If I could say this in conclusion, as you<br />
would appreciate overwhelmingly, Japanese investment in<br />
my country has been in the area of real estate and of<br />
tourism. In fact if you look at the last year, in an<br />
investment of just over $ 9 billion, 92% was in those<br />
areas. Now I'm not complaining about that, let me make<br />
it clear. But what I am saying is that I think it's<br />
going to be in both our interests that there be a<br />
diversification and an increase of Japanese investment<br />
particularly in our manufacturing industries. And in<br />
particular within that area I would like to see the<br />
existing co-operation that is developing between us in<br />
regard to science and technology research being reflected<br />
more in the applied area so that there can be co-</p>
<p>operation between us with . your great experience and<br />
expertise, our own resources, our own research. Because<br />
I'm sure that if we do that, that that's going to be to<br />
the benefit of Australia and Japan. That's going to be<br />
good for each of us and it will be good for the region.<br />
QUESTION: Since Australia is a friendly nation I'd<br />
better talk frankly. There is only one thing which I'd<br />
like to say. So I'd like to talk about the issue of the<br />
rice market. When I think about self-sufficiency of the<br />
other countries of the world, most of them are 100%.<br />
Thirty years ago Japan's self-sufficiency was 83% but now<br />
it's nearly lower than 30%. So when we think about this<br />
it's very natural that we think we have to try to keep<br />
the percentage at least more than one third. This demand<br />
is very natural for other sovereign nations. You should<br />
understand that. There are some differences between<br />
industry and agriculture of course but if foreign produce<br />
began to occupy the market at the percentage of 20-30%,<br />
most countries impose Now Japan imports 70% of food.<br />
So we'd like to produce another 30% at least. Our hope<br />
is very natural. Concerning this point that percentage<br />
may go down to 20% so we'd like to produce at least rice<br />
by ourselves. That's a very strong hope of the Japanese.<br />
Since there is not much time, you don't have to answer it<br />
now, but I hope you discuss it while you are in Japan.<br />
That's my frank opinion.<br />
PM: I don't like delayed replies so I would rather make<br />
an observation now. Let me say this. That from the<br />
perspective of Australia we see certainly a difference in<br />
the position of Japan as compared with Europe on this<br />
issue. Because in the case of Europe and of the United<br />
States of America, we could understand in the post-war<br />
period with Europe, after their experience, that they<br />
wanted to reduce to some extent the dependency that they<br />
felt they'd had on the rest of the world and have a<br />
capacity to feed themselves. It would have been churlish<br />
in those circumstances for us to deny the legitimacy of<br />
that objective. What of course we have found<br />
particularly unacceptable in the case of the common<br />
agricultural policy of Europe and also of the Export<br />
Enhancement Program of the United States, is how they've<br />
transferred and transformed what in that early post-war<br />
period was a legitimate aspiration to self-sufficiency<br />
into practices and procedures which have manifestly<br />
distorted the international trading system in<br />
agriculture. That has not of course been our attitude<br />
towards Japan. It's a different category of concern.<br />
But could I make these conceptual, and in the end I<br />
believe political and economic points in regard to what<br />
you've said. The world of the last decade of the<br />
Century is an infinitely different world from those first<br />
decades of the post-war period. It was perfectly proper<br />
for nations, including Japan, in those first decades<br />
after the Second World War, to take into their thinking<br />
about the world in which they lived, the assumptions, the<br />
suspicions, the prejudices if you like, about the </p>
<p>international behaviour of their partners in the global<br />
international relationship of which they were part. You<br />
were entitled to be suspicious. You were entitled to<br />
take the view that really the world was not very adult<br />
and that the world could punish you if you exposed<br />
yourself in a sense of non self-sufficiency. It was<br />
perfectly understandable. But the world today is<br />
different. I don't think it is so adult to have the view<br />
now at the end of the 20th Century that you need to have<br />
the same suspicions, the same attitudes that the world is<br />
not going to behave rationally and decently in terms of<br />
making available to you in Japan those things with which<br />
nature has not so readily endowed you. Because we have<br />
all matured. We are entitled as citizens of the world to<br />
say that we do behave more intelligently at the end of<br />
the 20th Century than we did in the middle of it. Now if<br />
that is true, and I deeply believe that it is, then I<br />
think it makes the mathematics of self-sufficiency<br />
something that needs to be re-examined. There is no<br />
logic in my mind now to apply to the world at the end of<br />
the 20th Century the same rigorous mathematical<br />
perceptions of self-sufficiency that you were entitled to<br />
have in you mind in the middle of the 20th century. Now<br />
that may sound the counsel of a man by nature too<br />
optimistic. But I think we are entitled to examine the<br />
evidence by which we are surrounded. The world has shown<br />
a determination in the way we, for instance, not with<br />
perfection, but the way in which we now co-operate in<br />
international economic terms. We have been able to see<br />
much more prolonged periods of economic growth and that's<br />
been a ref lection of the application of intelligence and<br />
of co-operation between nations. So if we're going to<br />
maximise what are still proper economic precepts of the<br />
advantages of the international division of labour, there<br />
is nothing that's changed the correctness of the theory<br />
of the international division of labour. Nothing has<br />
changed the correctness of that theory. What we've<br />
always had, and properly, are the perceptions and the<br />
reservations about the political division of<br />
responsibility. But none of ever questioned the<br />
validity of the economic international division of labour<br />
now. As we have matured politically, we ought to be the<br />
more ready to take the advantage in my judgement of the<br />
benefits of the international division of labour. If you<br />
can trust us for instance in the area of supply we have<br />
been a consistently reliable supplier of the raw<br />
materials that Japan has needed for its growth. You've<br />
known that the coal that you needed would be supplied and<br />
that the iron ore that you needed would be supplied. We<br />
happen, in the way in which this world was created, we<br />
happen to live in a land which has the capacity to supply<br />
you with food. And we will. We're not going to play, if<br />
I can say, funny buggers. We're not going to play funny<br />
buggers. Because it's too important. So I would say<br />
that if these truths can be understood, that we should<br />
not be, in my judgement, worried by the mathematics of<br />
self-sufficiency and we should be honest enough to say,<br />
as I've had to be honest in my country, that we often try </p>
<p>7 7<br />
and cover up political difficulties by nostrums about<br />
self-sufficiency. I'm a politician, I'm a practising<br />
politician and I know how easy it is to cover up a<br />
political difficulty with some economic nostrum. But at<br />
least I'm in this position, that when I come and sort of<br />
attempt to preach these truths to you I come with clean<br />
hands. Because I come as a leader of a Government which<br />
in seven and a half years has massively reduced our<br />
protective apparatus. We will be doing it further this<br />
year and we'll be going on doing it through the years<br />
ahead. So we'll be practising in Australia what we<br />
preach. And we'll be doing it on the basis of a<br />
realisation that there is truth in the concept of the<br />
international division of labour. It's something that's<br />
good for us. It's something that's good for you. And in<br />
the end it depends upon trusting one another. I'm saying<br />
to you you can trust us.<br />
ends </p>
