CANb. t RA A 1-<br />
8 June 1983<br />
Statement from Senator Susan Ryan, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister<br />
on the Status of Womfen<br />
REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN ON GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES<br />
The Government has decided to actively seek more equitable representation<br />
of wonmen on government boards, authorities and instrumentalities.<br />
Ministers will put forward names of equal numbers of men and women<br />
for government appointments wherever possible. They will also seek<br />
to avoid criteria for appointments. which would automatically preclude<br />
women from consideration.<br />
All departments and statutory authorities are expected to comply with<br />
the Government's decision in this matter.<br />
The Office of the Status of Women, in the Prime Minister's Department,<br />
will assist Ministers in identifying women suitable for nomination for<br />
such appointments.<br />
The Government's decision will result in a significant increase in<br />
the number of women on government advisory bodies, statutory<br />
authorities and other instrumentalities. It is an important step<br />
in achieving the Government's objective of greater involvement of<br />
women in government decision-making. -o00-</p>
