PRIME~ MONISTER<br />
FOR PRESS ELECTORATE TALK 17 JUNE 1979<br />
There is no question no room for doubt that inflation<br />
continues as the world's major economic illness. Inflation<br />
respects no geographical or political boundaries. It hits<br />
hard, fast and with constant pressure in every corner of<br />
the globe with devastating effect. It is a disease that<br />
not only retards the growth of markets at home and reduces<br />
job opportunities it helps cripple world trade.<br />
And it is this cumulative country-by-country and region-byregion<br />
effect that leaves its imprint on the livelihood and<br />
security of millions and millions of families.<br />
Inflation is not just another economic statistic. It is a<br />
burden inseparable from the daily and personal problems of<br />
modern living. It is this issue of continuing inflation<br />
that leaders of the world's major industrial nations again<br />
will confront at the forthcoming economic summit in Tokyo.<br />
Conferences of this magnitude regularly exaine the problems<br />
of inflation. At the end of discussion, leaders generally<br />
issue communiques. of course, communiques themselves are<br />
simply words. Unfortunately, too often they remain just that<br />
rather than a living document that lays the basis for firm<br />
and concrete policy measures. The conference in Tokyo must<br />
strive to produce a real hope and understanding that the large<br />
and powerful nations will keep on with strong anti-inflation<br />
policies. This time, what is said will have to be followed by government<br />
action which is seen to get to the heart of the problem. If<br />
it dosnot, it will be much harder for the community to believe<br />
there is a real desire to win the fight against inflation.<br />
I f= rvently believe that unless the great and powerful industrial<br />
nat--4z--s give a more vigprou-s lead in_ the fight then we are going<br />
to be in for a long decade-of difficulty. The picture is stark.<br />
Since 1973-74 world trade has grown by only four per cent a year.<br />
In the two decades before that it grew at eight per cent a year.<br />
That four per cent trade growth has taken place during a period<br />
of high inflation, high unemployment, and with activity,<br />
investment and development at minimal levels. 2/ </p>

It will stay that way unless the major industrial countries<br />
have the political determination and courage to overcome<br />
inflation. What the major industrial nations do determines<br />
much of what happens around the world.<br />
But in Australia we are fortunate in having political and<br />
economic stability. We have a lower rate of inflation than<br />
North America and much of Europe. Therefore our industries<br />
should continue to be more competitive thus gaining larger<br />
shares of home and overseas markets.<br />
We are also fortunate in having great mineral resources and<br />
a strong rural base. Because of our lower inflation we will<br />
attract investment from overseas at the expense of other<br />
industrial nations.<br />
Accordingly, because of these factors, we have a capacity to<br />
cross these hurdles in a way that is not open to many countries.<br />
The fight against inflation is at the core of our economic<br />
policies policies endorsed strongly by the OECD and the GATT.<br />
There is no easy way of restraining inflation.<br />
But the crux of it is restraint on government expenditure.<br />
We have to destroy the very false and shallow philosophy that<br />
governments can provide all things that are asked of them.<br />
What governments spend, they have to take from people. What<br />
governments spend needs to be limited, needs to be responsible.<br />
The recent economic package or mini budget introduced by<br />
the Government, was not a device that added or sought to add<br />
to the Government's popularity. But it was necessary to keep<br />
up the fight against the ever present pressures of inflation.<br />
It is sometimes said that in democracies where elections are<br />
held every few years, it is difficult to persevere with firm<br />
anti-inflationary policies. This is an opinion I do not share.<br />
Governments committed to anti-inflationary policies show more<br />
concern for the real well-being of people than those politicians<br />
who glibly carry out short-term stimulatory policies.<br />
