February 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD, MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE INNOVATIONS EXPO DINNER<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Thank you very much. To my colleague Peter Reith, the Minister for Industrial Relations and also the<br />
Minister that assists me in public service matters; to David Jull; Rhonda Parker from Western Australia;<br />
Rosemary Varty; Mrs Catherine Harris, the Director of the Affirmative Action Agency; Dr Peter<br />
Shergold; our overseas guests, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
This is the first occasion on which these awards have been presented and it does mark a very special<br />
night for all of those people involved in and committed to the notion of the highest possible quality and<br />
the most professional public service that we can devise in this country. And it's an opportunity for me<br />
as the head of the Government of Australia, as the Prime Minister of Australia, to say how much all of<br />
us in the political arm of Government respect, admire and appreciate the aggregate contribution of<br />
those who work in the public service.<br />
Coming as I do of a private enterprise, small business background and bringing into to politics all of my<br />
deeply held views about the importance of the role and the size of the private sector, I've encountered<br />
through my political life those who make the rather outdated but automatic assumption, still in the<br />
minds of many, that there is a natural antagonism and tension between the private and public sectors in<br />
the governance of Australia. I think that is an outdated notion, it is antiquated and it does belong to an<br />
age and a time that is far behind us. Because the world in which we all live and we all operate and we<br />
all try and govern to the best of our ability our nation has changed so much over the past ten or<br />
years. Globalisation of the economy in the economic environment in which we operate has altered<br />
forever the sort of pressures and the sort of circumstances in which both the private and public sectors<br />
interact with each other. It is no longer an option for any part of the governance of this country to be<br />
inefficient. It is not possible to shield oneself from competitive pressures. It is not a question of<br />
choosing whether or not the public sector is efficient or competitive. It is a question of really choosing<br />
the way in which you become efficient or competitive and indeed the pace at which you become<br />
efficient and competitive.<br />
There are some delightfu~ l notions of the interaction between the public service and the political arms of<br />
Government. They have been, for all of us, immortalised in that magnificent English television series<br />
' Yes Minister' which, of course, encapsulates for so many in a humorous way those marvellous<br />
interactions. I still remember that marvellous story that was told of one of my predecessors, Malcolm<br />
Fraser, and the we used to then call them permanent heads, we now call them departmental </p>
<p>secretaries I don't know why! And it is of his departmental head or secretary, Geoffrey Yeend, may I<br />
say one of the very finest public servants that Australia has produced in the time that I've been in<br />
Australian politics. And it is said of Geoffrey Yeend and Malcolm Fraser that they indeed both watched<br />
' Yes Minist' the only difference was that they laughed in different places! And in a sense that did<br />
say it all and that's the humorous side.<br />
The Australian Public Service has changed enormously over the last 20 years. I've been in federal<br />
politics now, it'll be 23 years in May of this year. The public service that I first interacted with in 1976<br />
when I was a very junior minister in a new government was a public service that was still very heavily<br />
influenced by, I think, the traditions of the 1950s and 60s and 70s where there was a very long pattern<br />
of very high profile public servants who stamped their own particular brand and their own particular<br />
authority and their own particular approach. They had interacted with a government between 1972 and<br />
1975 that had done things differently from their predecessors but there was still essentially a continuity.<br />
The public service that I now interact with and respect and endeavour to work with and, I think,<br />
successfuilly in a professional fashion is very different from the public service that I last remember in<br />
1983 when the Labor Party was elected and began its very long period in office until March of last<br />
year. When I say it's different I don't say that critically, I say that objectively because the world in<br />
which it operates is different. I think we have changed our attitudes, I think there is a greater<br />
willingness on the part of the public service without in any way sacrificing the essential thread of being<br />
apolitical there's a greater desire on the part of the public service to try and implement what are the<br />
accepted political goals and the accepted political mandate of the government of the day.<br />
I know when I first became Prime Minister and I had a discussion with Michael Keating, who I'm<br />
happy to say is here tonight, who'd served a previous Coalition government with great loyalty and<br />
distinction and had also risen to the head of the Prime Minister's department under my predecessor<br />
Paul Keating. He made the observation to me that he thought one of the great changes that had<br />
occurred was the willingness of the public service without in any way sacrificing its essential apoliticism<br />
to try and work effectively towards the political goals of the government of the day. It's always a<br />
delicate balance. You do need to preserve a tradition of being apolitical. It is important to have a great<br />
reservoir of people within the public service, no matter what their own individual political beliefs may<br />
be, they have a professional capacity when a change of government occurs to serve the new<br />
government, even if they may personally have not welcomed the change of government, and serve it in<br />
a professional way. And I think it is possible to separate out those people and I think that tradition is<br />
worth nurturing and I would hate to see that traditional disappear all together. But consistent with the<br />
world in which we live it is natural and desirable that the political aims of a new government not be<br />
seen as antagonistic to professionalism within the public service, but perhaps imposing upon that<br />
professional public service an even greater obligation and discipline to provide objective advice about<br />
both the desirability and also the pitfalls of the agenda of the new government.<br />
I think occasions like this are very important. They're an occasion, an opportunity, to say thank you to<br />
people, to honour the constant pursuit of excellence within our community and I'm so very happy that<br />
people have come from the four corners of the Earth to be amongst us to contribute their ideas on<br />
excellence in the public service. I'm delighted that there is such a representation from the State public<br />
services of our nation and I'm also delighted at the way in which the various departments of the State<br />
governments of Australia have participated, not only in the conference, but also in the award winning<br />
process. My Government has embarked, under the very able stewardship of Peter Reith, my Government has<br />
embarked upon some major changes to workplace relations in Australia. They are changes not<br />
designed in any way to reinforce notions of division between them and us in the workplace. We have 2 </p>
<p>quietly discarded the expression industrial relations in favour of the more contemporary and I think<br />
more beckoning expression, workplace relations. The world of enterprise bargaining is the world of the<br />
future. The world of the future will be very different in the workplace from what it was years ago.<br />
Many of the old modalities of workplace relations were built upon the notion that most of the work<br />
force, in fact almost all of it, was male. A large section of it was in the manufacturing industry. Most<br />
people worked for large organisations and answered to the foreman. Most of the congregated in one<br />
spot in large numbers. All of those modalities have changed in varying degrees and some of them<br />
completely. The workplaces of the future will be smaller units. An increasing number of people will<br />
work from home. The old idea of congregating in large numbers in one spot and answering to a<br />
foreman is almost a thing in the distant past. And we do need a new workplace relations culture and<br />
we've delivered a new workplace relations act. That new culture will promote trade unions that are<br />
successful in promoting their members. The idea that efficient, effective trade unions have no role at all<br />
in the workplace relations scheme of the fuiture is quite wrong. But survival and success will go to<br />
those that are best able to represent their members.<br />
The workplaces of the future, of course as we all know, will involve a far greater number of women<br />
than they did in the not so distant past. And that impact alone will profoundly alter the character of<br />
work and the circumstances under which it is carried out. So we do need a modern approach, a<br />
different approach, to workplace relations and I believe that the reforms that my Government has taken<br />
through the parliament and which will now spread through the public service will be reforms that will<br />
be enormously to the benefit of the future of Australia. They will respect the professionalism of men<br />
and women in the public service as they will in the private sector. They will not revive old-fashioned<br />
antiquated antagonisms between the two sectors. I believe in an expanding private sector, I believe in a<br />
strong private sector. I also believe that there are a core of responsibilities within our community which<br />
can only ever be discharged for the benefit of our community by a dedicated, competitive and<br />
professional public service. A public service that works in harmony and cooperation and in an<br />
atmosphere of mutual respect in respect of those in the private sector. There is no enduring<br />
antagonism, there should only be an enduring partnership for the better governance of our nation.<br />
So tonight, ladies and gentlemen, I'm honoured indeed to be in the presence of such a large gathering<br />
of professional men and women in the public service our nation and in the public service of many other<br />
nations. I congratulate all of you for the contribution you are making to the quality of government in<br />
Australia. I particularly congratulate the winners and those that have taken out the awards. I thank<br />
those that have organised tonight's gathering on my behalf I think it's an excellent occasion and I<br />
hope it is the first of many such occasions in which the Prime Minister of the day and the government of<br />
the day can honour the contribution to the better quality of government of Australia by those who work<br />
and spend their lives in the professional public sector of Australia. Thank you. </p>
