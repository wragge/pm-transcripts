TELEVISION INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER, MR JOHN GORTON<br />
FOR CHANNEL 7 NETWORK 24 SEPTEMBER 1970<br />
Interviewer Peter Martin<br />
Q. Prime Minister, why have you taken exception to Mr Whitlam's<br />
remarks and advice to conscientious objectors?<br />
PM Because Mr Whitlam as the Leader of the Opposition and the alternative<br />
Prime Minister is actively urging a breach of the law, is actively urging<br />
the destruction of the defence forces. He is quite unequivocally saying that<br />
persons who enter the defence forces, who are called up for service, should<br />
reidse to obey a legal and military order. I think on the occasion of the call<br />
for mutiny in Vietnam by the Labor Conference in Victoria, I had this to say<br />
" It is a really grave development in Australian politics for<br />
any political party in Opposition to urge not that the law<br />
should be changed, because that is all right, it is not bad for<br />
them to put forward arguments as to why it should be altered<br />
but to urge that it should be broken is a new and grave thing<br />
in Australian political life"<br />
and to have the Leader of the Opposition urging this is something that I think<br />
could I don't believe it has happened anywhere in any reasonably<br />
democratic country before.<br />
Q. Can you see any disastrous effects arising from Mr Whitlam's statement,<br />
really?<br />
PM Yes, I can. Here is Mr Whitlam saying " I advise young men to accept<br />
the registration for call-up, to go into the Army, but once in the Army to make<br />
up their own minds as to where they will go and where they will not go" you<br />
can't confine this to Vietnam. If they are urged to refuse to go to Vietnam,<br />
and that is right, then it is all right for them to refuse to go to any place to<br />
which the Army wishes to send them. And that would be quite destructive of the<br />
Army generally. This is not the real matter. The real matter is here is<br />
somebody who hopes to form an alternative government preaching a complete<br />
breaking of the law. That is the philosophical matter. It is also stupid<br />
because he is advising a young man to put himself into a position where he could<br />
be seriously punished, whereas if he had any sense and somebody approached<br />
him for advice and said, " I don't like Vietnam", he would say, I would think,<br />
" Well, in that case join the CMF and you will have no risk whatever of being<br />
called up and being sent to Vietnam and of being punished. That is the stupidity<br />
of the advice. The really significant and important thing is that here is<br />
somebody who hopes to be Prime Minister urging people to break the existing<br />
laws. *' 2 </p>
<p>Q. Would that be your advice, then, to a young man who asked you in<br />
similar circumstances?<br />
PM If a young man came to me and said, " I am subject to be called up. I<br />
haven't yet been called up, but I am liable to be called up, and I have grave<br />
worries about going to Malaya or Vietnam or anywhere, and they really are<br />
conscientious worries and I don't want to do it," my statement to him would<br />
be " There is no-one in Australia in your situation who is liable to be forced<br />
to go to Vietnam provided they will take the channels which the Government<br />
has provided for them to join the CMF, in which case they are not called<br />
up for regular service. Or alternatively, if they have got real conscientious<br />
objections to war, and to fighting, then there is an opportunity for them to go<br />
' efore a court and prove those. But this is ignoring that. This is saying<br />
each individual who enters the armed service should have a right to say whether<br />
he will go to a place or whether he won't go to a place, and he makes up his<br />
own mind about that and refuses to obey a legal and proper order. </p>
