MVEETING OF CHAMBERS OF COMME RCE, MANUFACTURE RS, MINES<br />
AND THE EMPLOYERS' FEDERATION<br />
PERTH, W. A.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. William<br />
McMahon, C. H., M. P. MAY, 1972.<br />
Mr. Britten, Mr. Brodie-Hall, Mr. Hammond, Mr. Pullan<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
You will notice I kept those introductions very strictly inalphabetical<br />
order because, in mentioning the distinguished<br />
Presidents of the four very important groups which are sponsoring<br />
this occasion, I would not want to attempt to differentiate between<br />
them in the status, or importance that we in the Government attach<br />
to them. They are all important organisations and provide a-good and<br />
effective representation of the business spectrum here in Western<br />
Australia. i want to assure you, as the members of these important<br />
business groups that your views occupy a. n important priority in<br />
our decision-making. I am also delighted to note that, to use a<br />
common expression, " the place is packed out". If attendance is any<br />
guide then I can say we are a very good bet indeed in Western<br />
Australia when the election comes around. Thank you for coming.<br />
During our generation of national government in Canberra with<br />
our coalition partners, we in the Liberal Party have always seen our<br />
role as having a central theme and a commitment to the concent of<br />
individual rights, and support for free enterprise. I want to<br />
emphasise these last five words. We have always believed in the<br />
value and the real benefits of consultation with business groups in<br />
considering economic policy measures. I will go further and assure<br />
you that there is going to be no change in this attitude in this<br />
very strong commitment of ours to private enterprise; or to our<br />
continuing efforts to create and maintain the right type of climate<br />
in which private enterprise can continue to make its magnificent<br />
contribution to the growth and development of this country: An<br />
effort which has resulted in our gross national product multiplying<br />
by a factor in money terms of eight since we came to power in 1949,<br />
from about 4,000 million dollars then to well over 30,000 million<br />
dollars in the early seventies. / 2 </p>
<p>All the other indicators tell the same story of the fantastic<br />
growth of this nation. Whether you look at public. investment,<br />
private investment figures or the record of exports and international<br />
trade which place us up near the top of the list of the world's<br />
trading nations. No matter which way you look at it you must come<br />
to the same inescapable conclusion that our generation of government<br />
has been one in which the energies and initiative and dynamism of<br />
private enterprise have been encouraged and released to make possible<br />
the exciting story of Australia's postwar developnment.<br />
I think our period in Government to date can fairly be called<br />
the " growth generation".-Australia's great leap forward. Western<br />
Australia has played a significant role in this development, thanks<br />
to managers and entrepreneurs like yourselves: And thanks to men<br />
like David Brand and Charles Court, and all those others at the<br />
state level who have done so much. I pay my Government's tribute<br />
to them all.<br />
You have had the minerals boom and the great boost to<br />
prosperity that went with it. You had your own local " population<br />
explosion" and the great growth that came with it here in Perth,<br />
a really attractive city. It is true that there has been a<br />
temporary pause in the great growth of the mining industry here,<br />
caused mainly as a consequence of the world currency crisis and the<br />
slowing down of the Japanese economy in its very rapid rate of<br />
growth, but the biggest part of the big projects are going on. I<br />
refer to the Japanese economy. I am confident that these<br />
characteristics of the Japanese people strong, vigorous and<br />
efficient will be reflected before long in a resurgence of the<br />
Japanese economic growth and n resumption of the hiah level demand<br />
and of the kind of orders we previously enjoyed from them. In the<br />
meantime, growth and development Jhere in Australia are going on.<br />
Only this week you cpened the new alumina plant here at<br />
Pinjara. This plant will lift Australia into number two position in<br />
the world as a producer of alumina. That is something you in the<br />
" west" and all Australians can be proud of. We have been and are<br />
still facing something of an economic challenga, today. That is true.<br />
But I wonder sometimes whether many Australians stop for a moment<br />
to remember the stark economic challonges that faced us when Robert<br />
Gordon Menzies led us so brilliantly into Government<br />
In the late forties and early fifties the problems were<br />
really renacing. We had a virulent form of inflation. The Labor<br />
Government had just about given up in despair of doing anything<br />
about it and was in its dying days. When we assumed the<br />
responsibilities of Government, we diagnosed the situation quickly<br />
as one of under-production, too much money chasing too few goods,<br />
shortage of manpower, and a coal and power famine. In those days<br />
of the " battle for prdcin as it was called, we had a three<br />
pronged approach, against communist influence in the unions,<br />
against inflation, and towards development.<br />
In three to four years, we had transformed the situation: We<br />
literally produced our way to prosperity. Many Australians would<br />
hardly remember that time. ./ 3 </p>
<p>After all, half the population today is under 30 years of age: And<br />
of course, our economy is far stronger, more complex, and more<br />
diversified than in those days. We no longer face recurrent balance<br />
of payments problems: And thanks for that are due in no small<br />
measure to the great contribution of the mining industry, and we<br />
all know of the West Australian contribution to this success story.<br />
But as our economy and other western economies here become<br />
more complex, the problems they can pose for economic mangers have<br />
become the more difficult. This is true of ourselves as well as<br />
other nations. We have found that new problems are not necessarily<br />
amenable to the more traditional responses. And so we here had to<br />
be prepared to be more flexible than we have ever been. We have<br />
had to be ready to correct trends as they emerge and if necessary,<br />
to frankly acknowledge where our predictions have not been borne out.<br />
It is true too that we have been through a period of some pessimism,<br />
but I think we passed through the trough over the Christmas and New<br />
Year period. In the last couple of months there has been a<br />
resurgence of business and community confidence.<br />
I think you will find that is fairly readily acknowledged in<br />
Canberra and the rest of Australia too. It reflects of course, the<br />
realisation that our basic long term prospects for growth and rising<br />
standards of living are aood. But it also reflects some favourable<br />
short term developments w.-ich I want to mention to you today.<br />
To illustrate my point let us have a look at the various<br />
sectors of the economy. I first mention what we have done in<br />
monetary policy. Financial conditions are very easy, with funds<br />
readily available to the private sector. The reductions in interest<br />
rates we induced have now spread fairly generally throughout the<br />
financial system, and rates are well below those prevailing in the<br />
early part of this financial year. The banks are very liquid, and<br />
their new lending commitments are rising very strongly. The<br />
normal winter rundown in liquidity will not put a strain on<br />
financial markets this year. To sum up on the monetary side,<br />
financial and credit conditions are very conducive to increased<br />
activity in the economy. We believe we have helped significantly to<br />
create the right climate in this way, for a return of business<br />
confidence. Late last year, we removed restrictions on bank<br />
lending. We followed this up later with a large release from the<br />
statutory reserve deposits and lower interests rates.<br />
That was only one part of our flexible response at the<br />
Premiers' Conference in February and I believe it was the most<br />
successful I have attended in all my time in politics. We<br />
stimulated the economy further through the provision of extra funds<br />
for the states, we approved a big lift in unemployment benefits,<br />
and we stepped up the scheme of job creating grants for rural areas<br />
which we had begun in February. But the major decision directed to<br />
overcoming the lack of business confidence at that time was the<br />
restoration of the investment allowance. We did this in response<br />
to very strong representations that it would be the single most<br />
important action by the Government in boosting business confidence.<br />
I think this was a clear indication of my views and those of the<br />
Government, in relation to our strong commitment to private<br />
enterprise to which I referred earlier. / 4 </p>
<p>We also decided to continue for a. second five year-period the<br />
industrial research grants scheme, and we have-reviewed the<br />
conditions which apply to it, and we expect that the total--amountof<br />
grants will show a significant increase in this-second.. stage of<br />
the scheme which begins.. in July,<br />
We have taken other decisions which will help in stimulating"<br />
activity. In December for. example, I announced an emergency grant<br />
of twenty million dollars over eighteen months to be used for<br />
primary and secondary school class.. room construction. in the states.<br />
About 6.7 million dollars of that amount will be used before June<br />
Then there are our-recent decisions, which are known as " the mini-<br />
Budget". These-decisions on taxation . and'pensions will stimulate<br />
activity directly to the-extent of 180 million dollars, and in<br />
indirect-terms we expect the total.. stimulus will be of the order of<br />
350 million dollars. Public spending on goods and services i one<br />
of the strong areas of demand at the moment. Between the first<br />
halves of 1970/ 71. and this financial year, the increase in this. area<br />
was 15%. Continued strong growth can be expected-here because of<br />
the-extra money we gave to the states in February for their works<br />
and housing programme and the continual pressure for many quarters<br />
for increased commonwealth spending generally.<br />
There are other reasons for optimism I want to mention to you:<br />
Particularly the recovery in the rural economy. Our best judgement<br />
is that farm output is going to go up by about 4% this financial year.<br />
Farm prices, particularly for wool, have improved considerably and<br />
the result is that farm incomes should rise by as much as 11% this<br />
year. This is encouraging, and we believe it should help to stimulate<br />
business conditions. The private housing sector is very strong.<br />
Motor vehicle industry spokesmen are confident about improved export<br />
prospects and a lift in domestic demand. Some of them have already<br />
stepped up recruiting of labour. The steel industry has also gained<br />
substantial export orders.<br />
So you can see that we have been prepared to take action to<br />
stimulate the economy and boost business confidence without delay<br />
when we believed action was required. Actual unemployment have<br />
fallen sharply from the peak of 130 thousand at the end of January<br />
to less than 98 thousand at present. Under the scheme rural employment<br />
grants, 12,600 jobs were created up till the end of .' arch.<br />
We expect the employment position will continue to improve, but as I<br />
said to the press when I arrived here yesterday, we stand ready to<br />
take further action at any time we believe it is necessary tc<br />
provide extra stimulation.<br />
I think you will agree, even from this necessarily brief outline<br />
of our actions in recent months that we have adopted a very<br />
responsive and flexible stance. We have been on the job continuously<br />
in keeping our finger on the economic pulse and we have at no stage<br />
hesitated in deciding what should be done. To us, the way ahead is<br />
one of steadily returning confidence in the short term, and the<br />
resumption in the long term of the very strong growth and development<br />
which this country has enjoyed for so long under Liberal and Country<br />
Party governments. </p>
<p>We havo-beon working hard on a num~ ber of fronts to overcome<br />
the serious problem which havc been that of inflation. This is no<br />
doubt that wage costs are clearly the prime element in the<br />
inflationary process when you have average weekly-earnings rising<br />
as they did by more than eleven per cent last year and productivity<br />
rising by only 2 5 or 3 per cent then it is inevitable that you are<br />
going to get a strong inflationary pressure. In the March quarters<br />
the rate of increase moderated as was indicated by the rate of<br />
increase in the consumer price index.<br />
Amongst the steps we have taken are the amendments to the<br />
arbitration act introduced to Parliament in Canberra only a few<br />
days ago. These amendments are designed to curb the militant<br />
use of union power to extort unreasonable wage increases and to<br />
ensure that the community's interest is preserved in wage settlements.,<br />
We have also made certain that there has been continued commonwealth<br />
intervention in important wage cases to impress on wage tribunals<br />
the economic consequences of their decisions. We have also acted<br />
to stress the desirability of wage moderation in wage increases<br />
wherever this has been practicable. And lastly, we are moving to<br />
promote a more competitive environment in the business community<br />
itself. we are doing this by our actions in deciding to strengthen<br />
the restrictive trade practices legislation.<br />
We are also moving to review the overall levol of tariff<br />
protection. I think we can say with somo justification that our<br />
efforts in trying to restrain wage cost inflation arez beginning<br />
to bear fruit. This was shown in the recent Commonwealth Public<br />
Service pay decision and it was also shown in the decision of the<br />
arbitration commission announced this morning. The commission's<br />
decision on the national wage case was for an increase of two<br />
dollars in the total wage and an increase of four dollars 70 cents<br />
in the minimum wage for adult -males. National wage case decisicons<br />
always provide debate, but all round, I think this is a well balanced<br />
decision. On the one hand it provides a sizeable lift in the wages<br />
of those in the work force who have been left furthiest behind in<br />
the race for ever higher and higher wages those on the minimum<br />
wvage and, I might add, it conforms with the submissions the<br />
Commonwealth mado to the commnission on their situation. On the other<br />
hand, by exercising moderation in adding further to rapidly increasing<br />
wages in general, the commission has given the economy a real chance<br />
to make some headway against inflation. That is in the interest of<br />
every wage earner and of the people generally.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, it has been a Pleasure to be here<br />
today and to outline to you how we in Canberra see cconomic<br />
conditions moving at the moment. I can assure you that we are<br />
determined to improve employment and contain inflation, and I hope<br />
that my remarks today have shnwn you that we are winning the battle<br />
to, achieve these objectives. Thank you. </p>
