    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>16 September 1986</strong></p>
<p>On 15 September I sent the following message to the Greek Prime Minister, Mr Andreas Papandreou:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I was very sorry to learn of the earthquake which occurred in Southern Greece and of the death, injuries and destruction at Kalamata.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">This is a human tragedy which will draw worldwideÂ  sympathy, but it is felt particularly acutely in Australia where so many of our citizens have strong personal and family ties with your country. Indeed Australians have notable connections with the Messinia region ranging from the landing of Australian troops at Kalamata during the Second World War to the many thousands of Greek Australians whose origins are in this part of Greece.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">On behalf of the Government and of all Australians I would like, through you, to convey to the relatives of thlce killed and to those injured and suffering th3 Pakfects of the destruction our deepest sympathies.</p>
