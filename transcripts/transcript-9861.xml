PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
MR GRAEME CAMPBELL<br />
In recent months, Mr Graeme Campbell has on several occasions placed<br />
himself in direct public conflict with the platform, policies and rules of the<br />
Australian Labor Party.<br />
As a member of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, Mr Campbell has had<br />
every opportunity to advocate the views he genuinely holds in relation to<br />
immigration, the racial composition of the Australian population, French<br />
nuclear testing and forest policy within the policy processes of the Caucus<br />
and the Party.<br />
However, his views on these matters have not found majority support within<br />
the Caucus, the government or the Party.<br />
His continued public advocacy of these views, and his attendance at<br />
meetings of such groupings as Australians Against Further Immigration and<br />
the League of Rights, are matters that must be considered by the National<br />
Executive of the Australian Labor Party.<br />
The National Executive should consider all the circumstances of<br />
Mr Campbell's public statements and actions, and determine whether he is<br />
best able to continue to represent the Labor Party's interests in the seat of<br />
Kalgoorlie.<br />
