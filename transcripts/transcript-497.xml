SPE: E7CH BY TIT, PR1II41 MINISTER TUHE RT. HON. R&amp; G. MENZIES<br />
AT TNSTALLATIOi' OF CANCI.-ILOiL CF A. Ntu0CANBERRA,<br />
11_ DTH APRIL,_,<br />
Chancellor, Your Excellency,<br />
There is an old standing rule, Sir that when I wear one<br />
of' these things ( doctor's cap) I am allowed L take it off' when I<br />
speak. I introduce you to that rule at once, ( Laughter)<br />
There is also a standing order in the Parliament, up the<br />
street against tedious repetition. It is, of course, consistently<br />
ignorea. ( Laughter) And I am going to ignore it this morning<br />
because having heard His Excellency, the Governor-General, I<br />
realised that there was really nothing more to do, in all honesty,<br />
than to stand up and say " I concur and have nothing to add". But<br />
having said that of' course I will break the rule myself and add a<br />
little. I think that i~ t is a magnificent thing, a very<br />
appropriate thing, that this University, which was not created as<br />
something local, or limited, but was designed to achieve world<br />
standards and perhaps world influence in many sphere, shou~ ld have<br />
had as iLs previous Chancellor, one who I repeat what has been<br />
sail is probably the outstanding Australian of our time, and now<br />
should have one of the world-famous scientists of our time.<br />
It may be that there will be some who think that for you<br />
to come out here Mr. Chancellor from far away is something odd<br />
you know we are all familiar with the slogan " What's wrong with<br />
the local boys?". All I want to say, Sir, as one of the " local<br />
boys", is that I was enthusiastic when I hoard that you were<br />
willing to take this post and that is just because of the reason I<br />
ventured to mention: that this University must, if it is to<br />
justify our hopes, become a world famous centre of learning and,<br />
particularly in its advanced studies make contributions to<br />
knowledge which will run right round the world into the minds of<br />
men and women of different races, and of different tongues.<br />
Therefore, this, as we see it, is a University possessint<br />
already and will moro and more do so of courso an international<br />
quality, a quality which over-rides the mere boundaries of a State<br />
or, for that matter, of the Commonwealth of Australia,<br />
Ther.-, ore, we do ourselves great honour when we have, as<br />
our Chancellor, a man whose name is known not only here, not only<br />
in Great Britain, but known right'round the world of' science.<br />
Just imagine what it will mean to many people in this<br />
institution, engaged in scientific work of any kind, to be able,<br />
periodically, to sit down with the present Chancellor and discuss<br />
some of their problams. I don't think it is always realisod what<br />
a tremendous thing it is in all branches of knowledge for younger<br />
men to have the opportunity of associating in a personal fashion<br />
with great scholars, with famous men. Some of the glory rubs off<br />
on them. It is something that they remember. It is something<br />
which serves as an inspiring force in their work, and in their lis<br />
And so it is a splendid thing that we should have here,<br />
once more, a famous man. He stepped into our minds and into our<br />
hearts ready made, so to speak, because many of us have had the<br />
pleasure of knowing him beforo. To those who haven't, his fame<br />
has preceded him. He is here not only among scholars, not only<br />
among experts in his own fieldA; he is here in a community that<br />
alrody has a profound respect for him and will have even greater<br />
gratitude as time goes on. ( Applause) </p>
