    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what can we expect tomorrow night?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think the first thing you can expect is a complete destruction</p>
<p>   of Mr Beazley's credibility on budget matters, because as a</p>
<p>   result of Gareth Evans' admission yesterday that Labor did</p>
<p>   leave behind a deficit of $10.5 billion, he's totally destroyed</p>
<p>   the Opposition Leader's credibility on Budget matters. Because</p>
<p>   for the last two years Mr Beazley has been denying that a deficit</p>
<p>   of $10.5 billion was left behind, despite the starkest evidence</p>
<p>   from the Treasury that that was the true state of the books. </p>
<p>So not only did Mr Beazley mislead the Australian public before</p>
<p>   the last election, he is now, on the admission of his own deputy,</p>
<p>   been demonstrated to have misled the Australian public for the last</p>
<p>   two years. Because for the last two years, Kim Beazley has denied</p>
<p>   the fact that he left behind a deficit of $10.5 billion. Now his</p>
<p>   own deputy, Gareth Evans, has let the, not let the cat out of the</p>
<p>   bag, but just demonstrated the obvious, and that is that Kim Beazley</p>
<p>   has been misnd that is that Kim Beazley</p>
<p>   has been misleading the public. So it's a double strike against</p>
<p>   him. He misled the public before the last election and he's</p>
<p>   been misleading the Australian public for the last two years. So</p>
<p>   I don't think anybody can take any notice of what the Leader</p>
<p>   of the Opposition says on this Budget or indeed Budgets for years</p>
<p>   into the future.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
