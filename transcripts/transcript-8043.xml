A,-6 TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH HON GERRY HAND,<br />
MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATI7ON, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ETHNIC<br />
AFFAIRS, PARLIAMENT HOUSE 27 JUNE 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: Ladies and gentlemen, I'll ask Gerry to speak to the three press releases first, and<br />
I'll have something to say about the ERG decision, then we'll be open to questions on<br />
the immigration matters. And then after that I'll be available for any questions you<br />
have on any other matters.<br />
HAND: First of all let me say that there were discussions around three topics<br />
yesterday in Cabinet. One was the program for the coming year, the question of the<br />
PRC nationals and changes to the way in which we'll address the question of the<br />
refugee and humanitarian cases in the future.<br />
On the question of the program, last year you'll recall the upper planning level was for<br />
140,000. This year it will be 126,000. The categories are in the sets of the Family<br />
Migration 64,000; the Skilled igration 50,000; Humitarian component 11,000; and<br />
the Special Eligibility category 1,000. Total 126,000.<br />
The changes to the refugee humanitarian procedures brought about quite a deal of<br />
discussion in the Cabinet because they seek to, for the first time, bring under control<br />
what is a growing area. That is people who arrive in Australia and seek to change<br />
residence by claiming humanitarian or refugee status. Now, we're one of the last<br />
countries to be affected by this and it is quite a dramatic blowout in terms of going<br />
from one or two years waiting to in excess of six and rising rapidly, that is the time<br />
which people would have to wait to be processed.<br />
So we're doing a number of things. Firstly we're putting the criteria, if you like, or the<br />
way in which people are assessed, into legislation. We'll be rejigging the DORS<br />
process so it's faster and quicker and therefore people aren't left waiting as long. Also<br />
the question of natural justice will be built into the process so that people are assured<br />
of getting their rights fully addressed.<br />
This will enable us to do a number of things. Firstly, we'll be able to put people into a<br />
holding line, if you like, or queue of four years instead of automatically getting<br />
permanent residency which they do now. They'll be assessed and if they're found to<br />
be eligible for refugee status that will be granted. But the nexus between it and<br />
permanent residency will be broken and people will be given a temporary entry permit<br />
which they will hold for four years. At the end of that four year period they will be<br />
able to seek permanent residency and it will be granted on the basis of a position<br />
being found in the formal intake for that year.<br />
In other words, no more add-ons or blowouts, a controlled approach, a disciplined<br />
approach to the whole program. Also whilst they're in that four year period they can<br />
be taken into account as the calculations are made when you examie the range of<br />
issues do when you're reaching the intake for that year. So in terms of the broader<br />
range of issues be addressed, they will become a factor in terms of the cost etc. </p>
<p>So two things one is that it for the first time enables us to control the flow of people<br />
onshore into the program and secondly it doesn't give them an advantage over people<br />
offshore. In other words you can have people in a camp who are part of a three year<br />
intake program, or camp clearance program, who have to wait. And if you're one of<br />
the people in the third year you can understand them getting a bit upset with<br />
somebody who happens to land in Australia and going ahead of them in the queue. So<br />
it puts them into a queuing situation but in a balanced and orderly way.<br />
The third area that we discussed which is linked to the asylum processes I've just<br />
addressed is the question of the PRC students. Thecy will be granted a four year<br />
temporary entry permit. It will be in a special PRC category. They are not being<br />
assessed for asylum or in terms of refugee or humanitarian grounds. They will be<br />
given a special category of their own. This is the pre-June 20 group. T'hey will at<br />
the end of that four year period be able to again seek permanent residence. That will<br />
be granted if a position is available to them in the program as determined by the<br />
Government at that time.<br />
So again, they will be given certain rights in terms of family reunion as will the<br />
asylum people. That is spouse and dependent children which I point out is available<br />
to people who are here for over twelve months now studying or in a work situation.<br />
So that's nothing new. That is a continuation of what exists. Also the Finance<br />
Minister and myself will be reporting back to Cabinet very shortly on the other<br />
programs that they'll have access to.<br />
PM: Thanks very much Gerry. In regard to the latter matter, the PRC nationals, I<br />
would obviously want to make some observations. Let me say at the outset that I'm<br />
obviously delighted with the decision which incorporates all the elements which I<br />
have consistently regarded as important in this matter. And may I say most<br />
particularly the decision reflects the original discussions that Gerry Hand and I had,<br />
and reflects the submission which he took to the Cabinet.<br />
It needs to be said that it's not a simple thing to manage an issue of this kind in a way<br />
which is at the one time both humane and compassionate on the one hand, as it must<br />
be, and on the other is one which enables a suitable control and a practical<br />
administration of the issue. But I think that the Government has squarely faced this<br />
issue on the basis of the submission which Gerry brought to it and has approached the<br />
tragic events of last June in China and as far as has been reflected in this country in a<br />
way which gives a solution. It is on the one hand compassionate, meeting our<br />
humanitarian obligations, but on the other it gives the capacity to maintain control<br />
over the size and the structure of Australia's immigration program.<br />
As far as the humanitarian asecs are concerned, the decision shows an appropriate<br />
sensitivity to the very difficult plight in which Chinese students and others in<br />
Australia at the time of Tienanmen found themselves. It fully confirms the<br />
undertakings that I have previously given publicly that no such Chinese national<br />
would be required to return to China against their will. Importantly it gives these<br />
people time, as they should be given, time to assess the situation in China before<br />
taking decisions about where their long term future lies.<br />
Now hope, and I've consistently expressed this hope, and I believe that most of the<br />
Chinese themselves hope, that the years ahead will see a turn for the better in China.<br />
Accordingly, the decisions that we've taken on the basis of the submission that Gerry<br />
brought to Cabinet, it gives the people concerned every reason for a sense of security<br />
without forcing them to commit themselves to make at this point an irrevocable<br />
decision about their future. </p>
<p>So that's as far as the humanitarian obligations that we have. As far as the element of<br />
control is concerned, as Gerry has pointed out and as you'll see from the decision, this<br />
is achieved by the concept of the special category for four years, and after which time<br />
the Governiment of the day can make appropriate decisions then about whether to<br />
extend the temporary residence for those who wish to stay or whether to grant<br />
permanent residency. And it creates the capacity for gearing the rate at which<br />
permanent residence is provided to the rate at which places become available under<br />
the program.<br />
Let me say that no-one, neither Gerry nor myself nor anyone in the Cabinet, nor<br />
anyone else for that matter, can be definitive about the number of people in the special<br />
category who will choose to stay. It's impossible to be definitive about that. . But<br />
expressing my own belief, it is this. That I think that many of those, very many of<br />
those, will choose to return to China, given the strength of attachment of the homeland<br />
which exists. But regardless of that, the decision gives us a fully workable framework<br />
in which to manage the situation. And it's relevant to note that in respect of the pre-<br />
June 20 category I think the latest count you've got Gerry, in your Department, of<br />
those in that category who have returned is now 1400. There are actually 1400 who<br />
have returned who were in that pre-June 20 group.<br />
The final point I'd make is that obviously the decision also draws the distinction<br />
which I have consistently said should be drawn between those who were here before<br />
the 20th of June and the later arrivals. I might say finally that the decision that we've<br />
taken in this regard is fully consistent with our broader foreign policy posture towards<br />
China. That policy doesn't in any way neglect or disregard the changed situation in<br />
China since the events of last June. But rather it accepts the requirement upon us to<br />
respond to the impact of those events. At the same time, as you know, our policy is<br />
one which hopes for an improvement in the situation in China and I repeat now that<br />
my Government will do all that we can to try and work for an improvement of that<br />
relationship in the years ahead.<br />
So as someone who's had a longstanding commitment to sound policy in this whole<br />
area of our relations with China and in the area of immigration, I repeat that I believe<br />
that the decision which has been made, and based upon the submission which Gerry<br />
brought to the Cabinet, is a most sensible and sensitive response to a complex and<br />
difficult situation. I take this opportunity of thanking Gerry Hand for the cooperation<br />
that we've had in this matter and which has been reflected in the decision taken by the<br />
Cabinet yesterday.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the matter of the Chinese students, this statement seems to say<br />
quite clearly that if the Government is confident the situation in China is such that<br />
human rights are no longer duly at risk then these people won't get permanent<br />
residency. Is that so?<br />
PM: That's a consideration that we make clear will affect the decision that we take.<br />
But that is also, as you will appreciate Laurie, in the same statement, that if in those<br />
circumstances people still want to say that they believe that they are at risk then they<br />
will not be forced to return. But as Gerry has pointed out in his observations and as<br />
the decision points out, that will then be relevant obviously to the question of whether<br />
they would get permanent status.<br />
JOURNALIST: But you say quite clearly whether these nationals in the special<br />
category who wish to stay beyond the four years permanent residence will depend<br />
upon conditions then prevailing in China. It seems to mean only one thing if the<br />
Government thinks the position is alright they don't get permanent residency. Isn't<br />
that so? </p>
<p>PM: We're making that quite clear. What I'm saying is it's two things. I've said<br />
consistently throughout that what the position is in China will be a relevant<br />
consideration. I've also said<br />
JOURNALIST: consideration in that sentence.<br />
PM: But it's not a consideration as to whether they will be forced to go back. If they<br />
make a judgement against our judgement, if they make a judgement and put that their<br />
assessment is that they would be at risk, then what we are saying is, alright you make<br />
that judgement, we will not force you to go back and in those circumstances there'd<br />
be no expectation that you would get permanent residence. You wouldn't.<br />
JOURNALIST: guaranteed then that they can stay Politicians, even yourself,<br />
have been known to break the odd promise. What guarantee have they got?<br />
PM: Well Laurie, you are battling indeed my friend to try and continue that which<br />
doesn't exist, a conflict or a contradiction between any part of the decisions that have<br />
been announced yesterday or the elements of which I referred to before. At all points<br />
the question of the situation in China has been regarded as relevant.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Just aminute. Let me finish the answer to the question will you. The situation<br />
in China has been regarded at all times. That is referred to again here. At no point,<br />
including my first statement or at any subsequent point, did I say that these people<br />
would be getting immediate permanent residence. There is an assumption, an<br />
assumption made by some that that was said or that was intended. It was not said nor<br />
was it intended. The intention that there has been, and which is reflected in the<br />
decision of the Cabinet is this, that there is a special category of these people who<br />
came here before the 20th of June. That has been endorsed. That has meant now that<br />
these people are not required to make any decision now, commit themselves, for four<br />
years, in the hope, which has been a consistent hope, that by that time the<br />
circumstances will have changed in a way which would make the return of these<br />
people to China a safe exercise. But they are given that time. They are not required<br />
to commit themselves now. That would've been the most inhumane thing to do to say<br />
you are going to be required in some immediate sense to make a judgement of<br />
commitment about whether you want to break your ties or not. So they have four<br />
years. And in that period it is our hope, and I would judge the hope of the great<br />
majority of these people, that the situation in China will change to the point at which<br />
there should be no risk about their return. And in those circumstances the question of<br />
permanent residence is an irrelevancy. There was never any intention when these<br />
people came that they were coming here to be permanent residents. That was not their<br />
intention, nor ours. But in the situation created by the events of June of last year we<br />
had to deal with that. Not to create a certainty of permanent residency but to create<br />
for them a certainty now that they would not have to commit themselves to making a<br />
judgement about this issue premature. And that's been done. What we are saying still<br />
is if even against the judgement that we make at that point that there is no risk, if they<br />
make an alternative judgement then they won't be getting permanent residency here<br />
but they will not be returned against their will. Now those things are crystal clear,<br />
have been and remain so.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke that it won't be in legislation and governments can<br />
change and Prime Ministers can change<br />
PM: Of course Prime Ministers can change. I mean, wihrespect, don't be ridiculous.<br />
I can't, in regard to this matter, or any other, I can't bind future governments, can't<br />
bind future governments. What you can do now as a responsible and compassionate<br />
government is to lay down a framework which you believe will recommend itself to </p>
<p>the government of the day. I would regard it as extremely unlikely that any<br />
government four years hence would take a different view. That is, if the situation<br />
were then that the judgement were that it would be a risk situation for people to<br />
return, I think they would make the judgement that we do now, that they should be<br />
granted permanent residence but the timing of the permanency, as has been pointed<br />
out, to be fitted into the program. Equally, I would regard it as very unlikely that any<br />
future government, if the situation were that the judgement were made that the<br />
situation in China was not such as to put a returnee at risk, that any government then<br />
would say well ok, no permanent residence but if you say after this period of time you<br />
still believe you're at risk and you don't want to return, alright you can stay but no<br />
permanent residence. Now, I can't say that that will be the position of the<br />
Government in four years time or in ten years time on this matter or on any other what<br />
the position will be. But the responsibility of the Government today is to make<br />
decisions relevant today and which you think would be an appropriate basis for<br />
decision making four years hence. That's what we've done.<br />
JOURNALIST: postponing your decision.<br />
PM: I don't you're trying very hard to create an issue that isn't there. What has been<br />
made clear, which for one reason or another you don't want to accept, is this. That we<br />
have said there ought to be a period of time set aside within which you don't require<br />
these people prematurely to make a decision. Now why you don't want to understand<br />
or accept it I don't know but it's perfectly clear. It would be wrong in the interests of<br />
these people to say we require you now to make a decision. The humane thing is to<br />
say look we will give you a period here in which you don't need to make a decision<br />
that will irrevocably commit yourself on the basis of an attitude that you have now<br />
towards a regime or the condition in your country. It is relevant to say well here is a<br />
period, we've picked on four years, which seems a reasonable period of time, to say<br />
alright you have security here, you have security here, you don't need to commit<br />
yourself in that period. At that point it's our hope, and I would suggest the<br />
overwhelming hope, the hope of the overwhelming number of those people, that the<br />
situation will be such that they can return without risk. It would be quite improper, it<br />
would be quite improper, and I don't think anyone has questioned this despite your<br />
incapacity to understand it at the moment, no-one has questioned, I think, the concept<br />
that there should be some period within which they are not forced to make a decision.<br />
That has been at the basis of the discussion that Gerry and I had at the beginning of<br />
this, it's been at the basis of all that I've said and it's at the basis of the decision made<br />
by the Cabinet.<br />
JOURNALIST: Government's decided to bring out 114,000 people who are<br />
perfectly safe in their own countries<br />
PM: Has decided to bring out what?<br />
JOURNALIST: 114,000 people who are perfectly safe in their own countries.<br />
PM: What's this 114,000?<br />
JOURNALIST: 50,000 skilled migrants and 64,000 family reunion administrative<br />
difficulties and defer decisions<br />
PM: subtracting the humanitarian from the The figure is 124,000.<br />
HAND: 126,000.<br />
PM: 126,000. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Bringing out 114,000 people who are perfectly safe in their own<br />
countries and setting up these difficulties and these administrative blocks for people<br />
who arc not safe in their own countries.<br />
HAND: No that's not true.<br />
PM: It's simply not true.<br />
HAND: Not true at all. All people who come to our shores here have the right to<br />
seek refuge under the DORS program, and that's not being tampered with. What<br />
we're in fact doing is seeking to improve the servicing of those people by streamlining<br />
and improving, or lessening the time they have to wait where they are unable to get<br />
very much assistance at all. So quite the opposite is the case. We're in fact doing<br />
what we can to improve that and to bring them into the system and, well, if you like,<br />
make their position more clearer, quicker. So I don't think your question is right. I<br />
think we're doing exactly the opposite to what you're suggesting.<br />
JOURNALIST: The fact remains though that you haven't entirely removed the<br />
uncertainty for the Chinese students.<br />
HAND: There's a good could I just something before Bob talks. Look, a large<br />
number of the Chinese student delegations that came to see me, there was a very<br />
strong view put that they shouldn't be put in a position of being made to choose<br />
permanency. Now you've got to understand that. So we're not doing these people a<br />
wrong at all. People quite clearly came to me here in this building and said we don't<br />
want to be put in a position of permanency, we'd like an extension of the time we're<br />
allowed to stay here because some of us here in this room want to in fact return home,<br />
quickly. And we don't want to have to make a choice because that will further<br />
jeopardise us. So what we've tried to do is marry up a whole range of views in the<br />
fairest possible way. I think if you stand back and look at what we've done here there<br />
is obviously a right of Government to assess things in four years time and there's a<br />
right of the individual as it also says here to make their assessment as to what they<br />
choose to do. It's the individual's right that we're trying to protect. I mean, every<br />
editorial in the country said these people had to be looked after, and what we've tried<br />
to do in the fairest possible way is meet those sorts of community demands over a<br />
long period of time.<br />
PM: L-et me make the point. You say we haven't removed the uncertainty. Let me<br />
make this point<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Just me make it quite clear that at no point did I or Gerry or anyone speaking for<br />
the Government on this issue over recent weeks say that they were going to be given<br />
immediate permanent residence. I mean shake your head. Read it through and<br />
see that was never never said. Now for people then to say that an uncertainty was<br />
created on the expectation that that was their interpretation, what was intended that<br />
immediate permanent residence was going to be given, we can't be responsible for that<br />
because it was never said and never intended. And as Gerry has said now, in terms of<br />
people that have come and spoken to him and what any intelligent analysis would lead<br />
you to conclude, is that overwhelmingly these people who didn't come to Australia to<br />
become permanent residents they came here for a limited purpose, to go back to<br />
China then obviously what they will want is a situation within which they have the<br />
security of being here, not being forced back, within which they don't have to make<br />
some premature decision, some permature decision which could cut off their ties with<br />
their homeland. And that's precisely what's been given. So if you talk about<br />
uncertainty then there is no uncertainty being created by anything that we've said.<br />
Now as to the future, we have created a framework within which they know that if the </p>
<p>situation in China has not changed then that they would still have that at-risk<br />
situation. Then the decision has been made that they will gt permanency, the timing<br />
of which, as Gerry has said and the decision points out, wUil be in terms of fitting into<br />
the program. But they also have the certainty, that even if against the judgement of<br />
the Government of the time, that what is being said now is that they should not be<br />
returned against their will.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: There is no greater certainties which they can either expect have been given in<br />
any other country in the world or which could be responsibly given by this<br />
Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Should a student want to stay in Australia after four years but the<br />
situation in China has improved, according to the first paragraph he wouldn't have to<br />
go back, but according to the second paragraph that would be a consideration on his<br />
being allowed to remain.<br />
PM: Really, do you not understand something that's perfectly What would then be<br />
determined, if he says against the judgement that it is safe to go back, is ok, what has<br />
been clearly said now, you can stay but it would relate to the question of permanency<br />
or temporary residence. He wouldn't be getting, he would not have any expectation of<br />
being granted permanent residence in that situation. And that's some<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I have other interpretations Laurie.<br />
JOURNALIST: I just seek clarification. You say none of these people will be<br />
forced to go back to China against their will. Your press statement says quite clearly<br />
they will only get permanent residence if the Government, the Australian Government<br />
decides in four years the Peking Government is not on the nose. Now doesn't that<br />
create a situation where you have people who are allowed to stay here permanently,<br />
but they don't get permanent residence and isn't that absurd?<br />
PM: It's not absurd because we say, and have said all along, that no person will be<br />
forced to be returned against their will. Because you could have a situation which I<br />
think you could easily contemplate where the general judgement was made, general<br />
judgemnent was made that it was safe to return, that the change was such that people<br />
returning wouldn't be at risk. We believe you could have a situation where an<br />
individual could say well you might say that about the situation in China generally,<br />
but I'm telling you, I'm telling you that it's my judgement that because of some<br />
circumstance back there in the part where I come from, I could be at risk. Now we're<br />
simply saying if you've got that situation we're going to be saying alright, we're not<br />
going to return you against your will, not going to return you against your will, if<br />
that's your judgement, but be it clear in those circumstances you will not get the status<br />
of permanent residency in this country. You'll get a rollover of a temporary, a<br />
reissuing of your temporary permit.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, if after four years<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: If after four years the Government, Australian Government<br />
determines that Peking is back on the right track and conditions are suitable for people<br />
to return, what will happen to dependent spouses and children of the Chinese people<br />
who come here four year period. What will be their status? </p>
<p>PM: Well, that will be<br />
HAND: The same as the individual concerned.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
HAND: And they'll come in the same way, they join their spouse here in the same<br />
way, in the same they have the same standing.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on the same issue, but a slightly different tack, is it<br />
consistent to say that Chinese students will be given a discretion to decide at the end<br />
of the four year period whether they go back or not, at the same time as changes be<br />
made to the Migration Act, an application of the UN definition of refugees. two<br />
different types of refugees one group gets to make their own choice whether they go<br />
back or not, another group tougher rules on their..<br />
PM: We've said in respect of the pre-2Oth of June Chinese nationals, they are a<br />
special category. The specialty about their category is, as we've said, and I would<br />
have thought was quite clear but it doesn't seem to be, that as far as that category is<br />
concerned the one thing that will distinguish them is that if they say in those<br />
circumstances that their judgement is that it's not safe to return, then they will not be<br />
forced to go back against their will. But they will have no prospect of permanent<br />
residence in that situation.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about a Fijian or a Sri Lankan<br />
PM: No<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
HAND: On that, all other people have the right to DORS.<br />
PM: Right to DORS.<br />
HAND: Right? Now, that's not diminished. So the post-June 20 people<br />
PM: the same.<br />
HAND: in the same boat. They apply through the DORS process. There's been a<br />
decision taken in regard to the pre-June 20 PRC nationals which put them in a<br />
particular category on their own. The rest of the process is exactly the same in terms<br />
of people's rights. We're building into legislation a definition that now applied<br />
through a convention and we'll be streamlining to pick up the point about people in<br />
no-person's land, if you like, trying to fast track and get decisions for them in line<br />
with the earlier questions.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hand, why has there been a cut in the migrant intake and how did<br />
you arrive at the number of 14,000, rather than 20,000 or 30 or 40,000?<br />
HAND: Well, first of all there's a number of the categories that are demand driven<br />
and we've made an assessment of the demands based on projections from overseas<br />
posts. We've also, we're determined to maintain a degree of skills in those particular<br />
categories where they apply. The family reunion component has been held at roughly<br />
the same as last year and generally we weighed up a whole range of issues. I think by<br />
the fact that the Cabinet met for so long is a fair indication that some of the claims<br />
made in recent times about it's an issue that doesn't get much consideration bears a bit<br />
of changing. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Have you..<br />
HAND: Well, I'd say there wasn't a member of the Cabinet who didn't make lengthy<br />
interventions into the discussion and that includes the economic ministers. There<br />
were, as I said, a whole all of the issues that have been flagged that should be<br />
discussed in a debate like this were talked about in great detail. The question of the<br />
new asylum processes and the reasons for bringing that into place, the issues that are<br />
contained in that move are also factors that were brought into the debate as we looked<br />
towards the future. So all of the issues economic, the environment, the effects on<br />
discussions or the effects on the States and various capital cities. Recently I've had a<br />
State Ministers meeting where that fact was brought forward by them. I've put in<br />
place a process for detailed discussions to take place. Some of the outer States or<br />
smaller States are, in fact, seeking more of a share of the intake and so we're looking<br />
at ways in which we can do that. Currently some designated areas get five points if<br />
you go there. But the trick is to hold people there when they get there. get the five<br />
points and it doesn't quite work out as successfully as what it should. So those States<br />
will have to look at how they can address that question and we'll do that with them.<br />
JOURNALIST: check on some figures. I think you said at the beginning about<br />
1400 of the pre-June 20 group had a red gn bc<br />
PM: Between July and the latest date..<br />
JOURNALIST: What does that leave the total in this special category and what, and<br />
do you know how<br />
PM: About 19,400.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: There are about 19,400 pre-June the 20th still here.<br />
JOURNALIST: That's 19,400 less about 1,400.<br />
PM: No, that's the 1,400 taken into account.<br />
JOURNALIST: And do you know how many of that 19,400 had in fact overstayed<br />
their visas already at June<br />
PM: No, I don't know the answer to that question.<br />
HAND: rm not sure of that figure. I can find the exact figure out for you, I think. In<br />
terms of illegals<br />
PM: Beg your pardon?<br />
HAND: there were some certainly in that category. There were some certainly in<br />
that category, but<br />
JOURNALIST: But they are being in exactly the same<br />
HAND: Well, you see, given the circumstances and the events at the time, we've<br />
tried, I think it's almost impossible to separate people, given they were all in the same<br />
situation, the same event affected both those groups and so for that purpose they've<br />
been grouped together.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, your statement </p>
<p>PM: I'm sorry, Milton first.<br />
JOURNALIST: If you were a major employer<br />
PM: If I were what?<br />
JOURNALIST: If you were a major employer and you were searching for good staff<br />
and a PRC who was involved in one of these categories applied to you for a job,<br />
would you be prepared to take that person on, invest a substantial amount of money in<br />
the training of that person, educating that person in the job in the full knowledge that<br />
in four years time that person might have to go back to China?<br />
PM: Well, it's a judgement you'd have to make between those who were available for<br />
the job. If you thought that this person was the person available, I think I would<br />
and HAND: rye got an example of that where I was approached by people from the<br />
academic world with some students saying look they don't want permanent residency,<br />
but if they could be given some sort of extension, temporary extension, we would in<br />
fact be able to employ them.<br />
JOURNALIST: that's the academic world.<br />
HAND: Well, well, I mean, it is, I suppose, an employment situation. It's an example<br />
of if people have the skills people are after, they'll tend to employ them I think.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister<br />
PM: I don't want to avoid The implication of your question is that because<br />
under this decision that person hasn't been guaranteed permanent residence now, is<br />
that a risk from the employer's point of view? Well, I suppose you can say it hasn't<br />
got the same certainty as if a decision from the employeres point of view as if a<br />
decision were taken now. But I would think in the circumstances it would be a risk<br />
worth taking.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, your statement says that rolling over temporary<br />
residence which indicates that if these people after four years want an extension of<br />
their temporary residence, they might be able to get that?<br />
PM: Not might, not might. I mean, why do you say might?<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, if they don't choose to apply for permanent residence?<br />
PM: Yes, well there's no problem there, but in regard to the rest of the category, there<br />
is no might about it. They can and will be able to get it.<br />
JOURNALIST: And do you also say that the holders of these special permits will be<br />
able to work?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Now is there going to be any limit on the number of extensions of<br />
temporary residence these people can qualify for and if not, considering that you have<br />
expressed concern about people already rorting the system, aren't we just allowing<br />
people, some people just to stay without ever having to make any decision either way?<br />
PM: Well, when you make the commitment that no person will be returned against<br />
their will, then that follows, but what you've got to understand is that they have to </p>
<p>make judgements about the disadvantages from their point of view of not having<br />
permanency of residence and all the advantages that are attached to that. But I mean<br />
JOURNALIST: But we don't know what those disadvantages and advantages are yet?<br />
PM: Well, because the Cabinet has got to make the decision about what precise<br />
benefits are going to attached. I mean, the press release makes it clear be coming<br />
back after the discussion with the Ministers concerned<br />
HAND: Finance.<br />
PM: to Cabinet in the near future.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you expect<br />
PM: Beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: that overall levels of immigration in future years be cut back<br />
further? Is this a trend and do you think 126,000 is about right? I think you've said in<br />
the past 140,000 is about right?<br />
PM: Yes, well, the question in two parts. Neither I nor anyone else for the<br />
Government will say or would want to say now what the future levels of migration<br />
will be. I think it's let me be quite direct about this, Amanda, it is clear that within<br />
the Government, as within the community, there are some different points of view<br />
about appropriate levels of migration. But Gerry has brought forward, and the<br />
Cabinet has accepted, what he thinks is appropriate at this point taking into account<br />
the whole range of factors including the current economic situation. But, as has been<br />
pointed out and as we discussed in the Cabinet, there will be at the end of this year, in<br />
November I think Gerry, a conference on the whole question of immigration and<br />
population levels under the auspices of the Bureau of Immigration Research in Gerry's<br />
Department. We have also, as a result of the discussion yesterday, the suggestion was<br />
made and was accepted by the Cabinet, we should also within the Structural<br />
Adjustment Committee have a particular examination of the question of population<br />
levels and the implications of those levels for future development of the economy.<br />
So, out of our own internal Government considerations and also we will take into<br />
account the things that will be said that emerge from that conference at the end of this<br />
year, we will be in a position to be better informed about what sort of future shape the<br />
program should have. So, no, the short answer, Amnanda, to your question is you<br />
should not take this decision, which represents Gerry, I think only a 4,000 reduction<br />
from HAND: In real terms.<br />
PM: the outcome for this year, 88-89, is expected to be 130,000. That's for this<br />
year we've nearly finished well, for the year just finished, the outcome is expected<br />
to be 130 well, the program was 140,00, but the outcome is expected to be 130.<br />
And so I'm saying that what has been decided for 90-91 is 4,000 below that. I don't<br />
think, certainly Gerry didn't put it nor did we make a decision in terms of saying this<br />
reflects what the pattern of future levels will be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did the question of community tensions play any part in the Cabinet<br />
discussion as opposed to infrastructure problems and environmental concerns and<br />
economic problems, the question of community tension..<br />
PM: I think in the course of what was a very long discussion the question of attitudes<br />
within the community were referred to. I don't think it was, you would say in any </p>
<p>sense a predominant or overwhelming part of the discussion, but there were references<br />
to it.<br />
HAND: I think in the terms of the asylum area, trying to get not only control over<br />
that area, but also take into account the tensions that can develop by people who are<br />
put in a situation of queue jumping, that sometimes has in the past created tensions.<br />
That will be now overcome by this disciplined approach with the onshore arrivals.<br />
JOURNALIST: Where does that leave the Cambodian boat people who are arriving,<br />
those who are here and potentially those who may come?<br />
HAND: Well, in terms of the Cambodian people here, they're all applying for refugee<br />
status under DORS and that process is continuing along. When they make their<br />
recommendations we'll be able to inform people what they are. I make no comment<br />
about the Cambodians at all.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will they be able to stay in the same way as the Chinese students<br />
HAND: I make no comment, Laurie.<br />
JOURNALIST: who don't want to go home.<br />
HAND: Well, I cant make a comment about the Cambodians because there is a<br />
process in place of which I end up being a part of and I don't intend to make a<br />
comment about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, seriously at the end of that process<br />
HAND: Well, I have been, well hang on<br />
JOURNALIST: refugees, they will be in the same position as the Chinese students<br />
who don't want to go home.<br />
HAND: rm trying to be very serious about it because, given the rights of the people<br />
concerned, I don't want to jeopardise those rights by me making a comment about it<br />
given that I'm part of the decision-making process. It would be grossly improper of<br />
me to do so. It would be in fact, lead perhaps, if it was a rejection, quite likely to a<br />
intervention in the court. So I don't intend to make any comment about the likely<br />
outcome of the DORS process or what may happen. Because there are three boats, as<br />
you know, all in different stages of the DORS process and for that reason I'd ask<br />
people to respect their rights by not asking me to make a prediction about what may<br />
happen to the Cambodian<br />
JOURNALIST: what does that say about Mr Hawke and Senator Evans' comments<br />
very strongly suggesting that these people were not genuine refugees?<br />
HAND: Well, I suggest you address that question to them. They're not formally part<br />
of the decision process like me.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, I can certainly answer that. What Gerry is saying, and rightly<br />
saying, that as Minister, the recommendations of the DORS Committee come to him<br />
and he's got to make a decision. He is intrinsically part of that decision-making<br />
process and for that reason he has said he is not going to make any comment. And it<br />
is a perfectly proper response that he makes.<br />
JOURNALIST: But you don't would jeopardise their right. </p>
<p>PM: Well, I don't believe so and what I'm concerned about and what the Cabinet,<br />
importantly, is concerned about is that we deal with a situation in which, as Gerry<br />
indicated before and pointed out to the Cabinet, there has been a massive increase<br />
from what had been an average, I think, Gerry of something like up to 500 applicants,<br />
up until last year where at the end of last year it just massively soared to something<br />
like 4,000.<br />
HAND: We're heading for about a six year waiting period unless we do something<br />
PM: And in<br />
HAND: people going through the process. Thus you've got to do something and it<br />
is, the signs are it's going to get dramatically worse. So that's why we've had to adopt<br />
or bring about these changes don't diminish people's rights.<br />
PM: And which was not just, not just happening, as Gerry pointed out in his<br />
submission, not only just happening in Australia, but was happening in Europe,<br />
Canada and other relevant places. Now, what I'm concerned, as Prime Minister to<br />
point out, is that in regard to that situation, as I said, it's not just reflected towards<br />
Cambodia, but in regard<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: But if you want to, you know, just not be selective and remember all I said, I<br />
made the point quite clearly, quite clearly, I said whether it was Irish I said it doesn't<br />
matter who it is we're not going to have, as far as we're concerned, a situation where<br />
people can just arrive<br />
JOURNALIST: There are not many Irish boat people, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Now wait a minute. Well<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: However, there are other countries, and it doesn't matter, I mean whoever it is,<br />
think you can just arrive here and that's it. And indeed, Gerry brought the submission<br />
along yesterday which, in a range of ways, both directed towards legislation,<br />
administration and interpretation that will make it clear that as far as this country is<br />
concerned that can't continue.<br />
HAND: Can I just give you one example about there aren't many Irish boat people.<br />
What one country just experienced was a jumbo jet landing on the tarmac and<br />
emptying out everybody on board and taking off and leaving them there. And that<br />
country's having enormous difficulty getting rid of them. There are three or four<br />
Australians in Canada seeking political refugee status because the process takes ten<br />
years PM: Ten years.<br />
HAND: So therefore they can stay there for ten years. This is a major problem facing<br />
nations like us<br />
PM: That's right.<br />
HAND: and that's why we have to take this approach.<br />
PM: Good way of getting a ten year work permit. </p>
<p>HAND: good laugh about the poor old Irish boat people, but tell you what it's not<br />
just a question of boats. It's fast travel of large numbers of people moving around the<br />
world and you need to have some control over the flow of those people coming in to<br />
JOURNALIST: Will the work being done for the Structural Adjustment Committee<br />
of Cabinet within the Departments, say Treasury and Finance, be made available at<br />
this conference to take place in Melbourne in November on population and its<br />
environmental and economic..<br />
PM: Yes, well it will depend, obviously, how far we're able to process the work,<br />
David, in the Structural Adjustment Committee. But clearly, we would want as a<br />
Government and Gerry, from his Department, we would want to have as much<br />
constructive input into that conference as we possibly could. And if our consideration<br />
of the Structural Adjustment Committee has taken us to a point where it enables us<br />
from that source to put material in, we would do it. I mean, I think the important<br />
thing, David, is this, that we, and it's certainly the attitude of the Government, that we<br />
recognise that the question of immigration is assuming a larger degree of interest in<br />
this country. Not only the question of immigration, but obviously it's related to<br />
population levels, what are regarded as desirable population targets for 20, 30,<br />
years down the track. Now these issues have developed a growing significance,<br />
there's a growing level of interest in the country. Now as a, as a Government, we<br />
don't want to impose answers. I mean, if we can assist debate and constructive debate<br />
in the community, we want to do it. I mean, I think that's our responsibility.<br />
JOURNALIST: student from China. Is the Government continuing to accept the<br />
students from China and how do we..<br />
PM: I'm sorry, I couldn't understand. Did you get the question?<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the Government continuing to accept students from mainland<br />
China? PM: Is continuing to what?<br />
JOURNALIST: Accept students from mainland China and refunds on the..<br />
PM: Yes, sure, and the refunds. The question, could I tackle the latter part first in<br />
regard to the refunds. This was a matter that was considered in Cabinet last night.<br />
Let me say this, that in regard to those students. I mean, there are two categories, the<br />
students, the people in China who have paid and who haven't left China and there are<br />
those here who have met difficulties in particular institutions. Now the Cabinet last<br />
night considered this matter and the Ministers concerned which most directly,<br />
Minister Dawkins, but be's going to meet with, there's going to be discussions with..<br />
but particularly with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.<br />
They are to report back to Cabinet on the mechanisms that need to be acpted in<br />
regard to meeting Australia's obligations in this matter. They will be met, but they<br />
have to come back with further details about the process in which this will be done.<br />
Now, in regard to the first part of your question about accepting students, the question<br />
of the, the ELICOS program in particular is one which is being reviewed by the<br />
Minister, but generally speaking, our view is that we want here in Australia to develop<br />
the concept of the export of education. Now say this subject to correction, but I<br />
think in the last year, it brought in something of the order of about $ 100 million in<br />
export income and we see it as something that is capable, both of providing a required<br />
service to people in the region and also a good export income earner for Australia.<br />
But we have to be quite frank and acknowledge that there have been difficulties,<br />
obviously, in the way in which the scheme has operated and the Minister will be<br />
bringing submissions to Cabinet to have a form of appropriate regulation of this </p>
<p>industry so that the difficulties that have, have operated in that area, problems for the<br />
institutions and particularly problems for the students, will not recur in the future and<br />
he'll be coming back to the Cabinet with further submissions on..<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke what response have you had from the Cambodian<br />
Government to our..<br />
PM: I can't I don't want to aviod the question, but what I can say to you is this.<br />
That there have been very, as I'm informed, very constructive discussions have taken<br />
place, and they are still continuing. In those circumstances it just wouldn't be<br />
appropriate to go to any detail on them. But let me say this. I am hopeful from what<br />
I've been told from the disucssions that there will be a very constructive outcome from<br />
them. But I am not in the position to go to the details until they are completed.<br />
JOURNALIST: In what form are they continuing, Mr Hawke, officials..<br />
PM: At the official level understand.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are the officials still in Cambodia.<br />
PM: I don't know whether the officials are still there of whether it is being conducted<br />
from here. But what I was told just within the last twenty-four hours is that the<br />
discussions are continuing and whether we've still got people there, I don't know the<br />
answer to that. But I repeat what I've said to Geoff, they have been very useful and<br />
constructive discussions and I think there will be a positive outcome from them.<br />
JOURNALIST:.. outcome, do you mean forced repatriation?<br />
PM: I not, I'm not going to any further point from what I've said.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I've got nothing to add to what I've said. Discussions are going on and those<br />
discussions will not be helped by any comment I would make about the likely<br />
outcome from them.<br />
JOURNALIST: The eight thousand Chinese nationals who have applied already for<br />
the permanent residency, where do they fit in to the new scbeme of things?<br />
PM: Well they what's been said it's referred to the in the release I think. It<br />
suggested that they would probably be better going back into the general class<br />
category, because while they are in the queue they do not get the same sponsorship<br />
rights. So it's suggested, think that it's referenced to<br />
HAND: All the same possible assistance<br />
PM: All the same possible a reference is made here in the press release to it.<br />
HAND: Third paragraph.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: If they choose to persist with their permanent residency applications<br />
they may believe that that offers them more certainty. </p>
<p>PM: And we are not saying don't do that and what we are also saying is if after that,<br />
they can still go back into the category.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke what you said on the does that mean that Cabinet has to<br />
at least accept it in principle?<br />
PM: Beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: Does that mean that Cabinet has decided in principle that the<br />
Government will have to make some funds available to ensure the proper and full<br />
return of moneys paid out, either by the way of grants, or loans to institutions?<br />
PM: We are accepting a responsibility in regard to students. Let me put it that way.<br />
We are accepting responsibility in regard to students. And the method in which that<br />
responsibility will be discharged is a matter of discussion between the Ministers<br />
concerned to report back to Cabinet in the very near future.<br />
JOURNALIST: And it's going to cost Prime Minister..<br />
PM: There will be a cost. Yes there will be a cost<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hand<br />
PM: You can't discharge that responsibility without a cost.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the social services question, could you explain what the hold up<br />
is about making a decision about access to health services social security benefits? Is<br />
there any assumption that this group, the Chinese group, mighit not be able to get<br />
those, that support?<br />
HAND: You shouldn't make any assumptions about anything until we go back to<br />
Cabinet and that will be done shortly, between Ralph Willis and myself consulting<br />
with other Ministers in the Cabinet. And that will be done very quickly and<br />
announced before the program commences.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why wasn't that done before the latest program was<br />
HAND: Pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: Why wasn't that done before yesterday's Cabinet meeting. You've<br />
been on this for months haven't you?<br />
HAND: Pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: You've been working on this for months<br />
HAND: I've been working on this for quite some time, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: So why weren't those consultations conducted in advance?<br />
HAND: Well there needs to be more work done. It's a very complex set of issues that<br />
we are going to be looking at and the judgement was, which I supported, that we<br />
needed to do some more work looking at the range of areas in which assistance could<br />
be provided. Now there can be information supplied on what other governments in<br />
fact supply. And you will see that you can start from virtually nothing and work your<br />
way through to full rights, in terms of if you had permanent residency. Now what we<br />
have to do is make judgements and do some costings and continue to do what we have<br />
been doing in the way of costings and judgements. That will be done. The Cabinet </p>
<p>was of the view there needs to be more consultation on this issue between<br />
departments, and I think that that is proper and will be done very quickly.<br />
JOURNALIST: If you put them in the special category why shouldn't they be entitled<br />
to full rights?<br />
HAND: In a sense of social security etc?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes.<br />
HAND: Well that is obviously something that could be looked at, but it is not a<br />
suggestion that was considered yesterday.<br />
JOURNALIST: renunion program have full social security rights<br />
HAND: Pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: The people who come out under the family reunion program<br />
HAND: They do.<br />
JOURNALIST: Come out with the expectation of immediate full social security<br />
privileges. HAND: They do. They do. They certainly do. That's right.<br />
JOURNALIST: these people if in a different category?<br />
HAND: These people who now come in, in a situation of arrval here, and go into the<br />
queuing system, that is the four year period, before they are eligible for permanency,<br />
we'll be announcing as a result of these Cabinet discussions, what their rights will be<br />
in terms of access to various programs. Now the Chinese group are in the same<br />
category. JOURNALIST: Isn't that tantamount to putting some pressure on them to return?<br />
HAND: To return to China?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes.<br />
HAND: No. I wouldn't have thought so.<br />
JOURNALIST: They could be given some..<br />
PM: Of course they would, of course they would<br />
HAND: Well first of all, as I said, because the fact that they have been here over<br />
twelve months they are entitled to bring their spouse and children out here. Now<br />
that's the first thing. Now in a lot of other countries that doesn't happen. In the terms<br />
of the range of social type issues that they, or programs they would be able to access,<br />
we're making some assessment on that. And continuing to make assessment on that.<br />
Now I mean there is no, I think you are going to find out by comparison, they're<br />
getting fairly well treated.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister on another matter<br />
PM: Yes sure. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Do you support the dismissal by Mr Keating of the views of the<br />
Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, and do you approve of the way Mr Keating<br />
very publicly dismissed those views?<br />
PM: You refer to his dismissal of those views. I don't know. I haven't read the<br />
speech. I've seen the press report of it. I don't know whether he mentions the Deputy<br />
Governor of the Reserve Bank. Let me say this, that I fully endorse the remarks of<br />
my friend and colleague Paul Keating, the Treasurer, the Deputy Prime Minister. I<br />
fully endorse his remarks. It follows as a matter of logic, having given you that<br />
answer, what the answer to the second question is.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hand earlier on you made a reference to no more blowouts. I<br />
took it to be in relation to the refugee-humanitarian area. Is that right?<br />
HAND: Im talking about by moving to control what is obviously a ra pidly growing<br />
component we are going to be faced with, that there will be no possibility in the<br />
system, if we follow the system that I've outlined here today, that is, they will be<br />
formally brought into the program and that's the object of the exercise. I mean they<br />
will be formally brought into the program. They'll be able to be addressed in terms of<br />
when you are making assessments year to year, what that figure ought to be. And so<br />
it is yet another move to make sure that we are addressing the question of the annual<br />
intake in a proper and orderly way. And if you look at what we've done so far this<br />
year, we've reviewed the regulations. We've moved to have the population council<br />
work on issues that have arisen in the general community. We've got the bureau<br />
holding the conference and a whole range of papers being produced. We are about to<br />
start after we've finished this exercise the secondary stage review of the regulations.<br />
So by the end of the year we are going to have a package of things in place which will<br />
give us the most control we've ever had over the immigration intake ever before. And<br />
that's the purpose of the whole exercise.<br />
JOURNALIST: How can you guarantee no blowouts in the refugee and humanitarian<br />
category unfortunate potential for new refugee situation and international<br />
pressure to reduce the overcrowded camps in South East Asia?<br />
HAND: Well you see there is a three year canmp clearance program going on now<br />
which we are ahead of schedule, and any other situation that develops overnight, we<br />
would have to look at that as we have in the past and make judgement on it. But if<br />
they are brought in under some, or land here, and a situation develops, they will be<br />
introduced into the program in an orderly way. No more putting on top of the<br />
program large numbers of people. They'll be queued and brought in in a discipline<br />
way and that's the only way you can have proper planning.<br />
JOURNALIST: But if the peace process fell apart in Cambodia for example, would<br />
HAND: Well I am not going to make any comment about Cambodia. I know you<br />
would like me to but I don't want to jeopardise the rights of the individuals concerned<br />
by making any comment about their position.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you feel that the Premiers are starting a process that although it<br />
won't be fully completed tomorrow is likely to lead to more fundamental changes in<br />
financial relations?<br />
PM: If you look at what they've been saying they have taken their concern beyond<br />
just the area of Federal-State financial relations, and properly so. And you will see<br />
from what I have to say tomorrow that I have myself been thinking in some detail<br />
about the whole question of Federal-State relations going beyond the question of our<br />
financial relations. And I'll be making some comments tomorrow which, you will see,<br />
express that concern and deal with it. I think without, I don't want to pre-empt what </p>
<p>rm going to sy tomorrow, but I think it's fair to say this. I think as a nation it's<br />
becoming increasingly clear that we do have to examine, in much more detail and<br />
with much more commitment, the nature of the Federal-State relationship. Not with a<br />
view to the Commonwealth scoring off the States or vice versa, but to try and address<br />
the issue of how we best deliver services to people and to look at how best we<br />
co-operate to create a competitive, efficient economy. And to the extent that the<br />
States are giving evidence of their concern about these issues, I welcome it and it's, as<br />
you will see, totally consonant with what I'll be saying myself.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke are you disposed to accept the six points that apparenty<br />
all the States have now agreed to at the initiative of Premier Bannon? This united<br />
front, does that make it very hard for the Commonwealth to reject it, or refute it?<br />
PM: The common front. I've got a note here I think of the Premiers', reduced, I think<br />
it's down now to six points. No I think that the fact that the States have been talking<br />
together is not unusual because it is not the first that it has happened I<br />
welcome it, and there does seem to be from what John Bannon has issued, plus<br />
what I can judge from a direct personal conversation I had with him in Adelaide on<br />
Saturday, there is a recognition in the States of the need to have a more constructive<br />
co-operation in a whole range of areas. That's reflected in their statement. As I said<br />
in the answer to the previous question, I welcome that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you accept the idea of rolling, a rolling program, funding?<br />
PM: Not necessarily. No. I think the concept of tying hands of the Commonwealth<br />
as tightly as that in termns of macro-economic management has got drawbacks. But<br />
having said that I can, we can, understand, both Paul and I can understand the<br />
concerns that they have about trying to have a greater degree of certainty in their<br />
financial situation. But let me make the point Michelle that in regard to a financial<br />
position of the States, certainly about revenue is one thing, but they still have an<br />
autonomy in regard to outlays. I think the figues are that for this last year if you look<br />
at own purpose outlays, the States' own purpose outlays increased by 4.6 per cent real.<br />
And ours by less than one per cent. So if you are going to have the total picture it's no<br />
good just saying well they have some uncertainty about revenues. Whatever<br />
uncertainty they had about revenues, whatever decline they had in own source<br />
revenues, and whatever decision we'd taken last year which involved a reduction in<br />
their expectations about our outlays to them, and what was their income from us,<br />
despite that, the picture in this last year has been 4.6 per cent real increase in their own<br />
purpose outlays and less than one per cent in ours. OK?<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you happy with the standards of Ministers as Senator<br />
Richardson seemed to be implying in his comments about Senator Button?<br />
PM: Geoff, you're trying to get some legs on that one are you? The move on the<br />
leadership which you arc running every week or so. Well I'll try to disappoint you as<br />
much as I can Geoff so that you don't crank that one up again, it seems to amuse you,<br />
take up your time, groundless. No I don't have different standards Geoff. I must say,<br />
if I can, giving you a plus, a tick, rather than knocking you, I thought that the reaction<br />
of your paper towards the Button statement was a reasonable one. If I look at this<br />
Gallery as a whole, the beat up of Button on this last occasion was most, preeminently,<br />
in one stable, one part of one stable. I thought the way you treated it, the<br />
way that most treated it, that is with a rather dignified yawn, was appropriate and<br />
JOURNALIST: Senator Richardson </p>
<p>PM: I think Senator Richardson, as I've seen the subsequent statements, is at ease, at<br />
peace as he should be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister if the statement from the Brotherhood of St Laurence<br />
was a bloody disgrace and unchristian, what's Senator Richardson suggestion that<br />
Senator Button should be sacked?<br />
PM: Well, I don't know that would it describe it as unchristain. And I don't think that<br />
he wants him sacked.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well what was the difference between Senator Button's remarks in<br />
May or June<br />
PM: I don't What was that?<br />
JOURNALIST: What were the differences between Senator Button's remaks in May<br />
which.. PM: I read the transcript. After I saw your dashing headlines Glenn and the crisis<br />
that I was confronted with and the test of my leadership I thought my God, terrible, I<br />
better go and see this transcript. The Australian has got me skewered and Milne's got<br />
me done. I'm really on the rack. I better read this transcript. I went to it with<br />
trepidation Glenn. I thought here Hawkey your leadership is right on the line boy.<br />
Button's blown it, criticised the Government heavily. And I was almost shaking, I<br />
could hardly read it. But then when I read it Glenn you will find that there was no<br />
breach of Government policy. There was no criticism of the Government. There was<br />
no breach of what I'd suggested as to the way he should conduct himself. It was one<br />
of those cases Glenn dear boy where most of your colleagues got it right and you had<br />
a bit too much of a tremble.<br />
JOURNALIST: the first time round Senator Button's first statement which did<br />
create an outburst, an outcry in the Government, didn't seem to be much more than<br />
what he said on Sunday.<br />
PM: I think that that's not the case and certainly a number of my colleagues, as well<br />
as Paul, thought that way. And in regard to this, and on this occasion it has caused no<br />
concern at all. It was only in part of your stable Amanda that and its good to see<br />
this solidarity that's very good.<br />
JOURNALIST: why the first thing Senator Button said cause and outrage<br />
PM: Well it may be confusing you, or your part of the stable. All I can say is that I<br />
think generally speaking the Gallery got this one right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke you said that there should be an ending made to public<br />
airings of differences Senator Button said that he disagreed, or said private<br />
ownership in television difference of emphasis.<br />
PM: I say I read the whole of the transcript because I was impelled to it by you. I<br />
mean you motivated me. I read the whole of the transcript and let me say in reading<br />
the whole of this transript there was nothing which concerned me. And I didn't call<br />
the Senator to see me he said he'd like to come and have a yarn to me, he did. We had<br />
a year about a whole number of matters including his observations about that. So if<br />
you want to, I mean if you want as I say Glenn to try and stitch legs on to the corpse,<br />
do so. I mean that's what it's all about. But I can assure you my dear friend, I can<br />
assure you there ain't any life in that corpse. And if you keep trying to sew the legs on<br />
it will still remain lifeless. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: ( inaudible) 21<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister was that outburst against Bishop Hollingworth, was<br />
that theatrical, or was it fair dinkum?<br />
PM: It was not theatrical and as distinct from some observers who've indicated that I<br />
lost my cool or say Hawkey's blowing his top, it was a most considered statement. I<br />
notice that some people suggest it might have been my speechwriter. It's not my<br />
speechwriter. It was Bob Hawke and a very considered statement. And I must say<br />
I've been very very pleased, generally speaking by the reaction. Just let me say, as<br />
you've raised it, let me make the record quite clear. I said what I said there, not on the<br />
issue of child poverty. If anyone wants to attack or attempt to attack this Government,<br />
or me personally on the question of our record on child poverty, I'l1 handle that<br />
anywhere, because we've got a better record than anyone else. But it was not what I<br />
was talking about. I was talking about an unjustified and unjustifiably blanket attack<br />
on all politicians in this country<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well can I finish? And what I regarded as something that was dangerous. I<br />
believe it is dangerous, and particulary coming from sources like that and putting out<br />
to young people that all politicians in this country are people who won't do anything<br />
about an issue unless forced to, and particularly at election time. That to me is<br />
unacceptable and I felt it my duty to strongly, and as strongly as I could, repudiate that<br />
unfounded assertion. And may I say this, that in the subsequent discussion I had with<br />
the Archbishop, which I may say was not a case of me as some news television<br />
stations talked about me summoning the Bishop to my office. The facts are that the<br />
Archbishop had an appointment with me in my office, and that was kept. And in that<br />
discussion, a totally amicable discussion got that in that very amicable<br />
discussion the Archbishop accepted tbat point and said, certainly as I did, it was quite<br />
appropriate that I should have expressed myself. And just let me make this finial point<br />
on it that the subsequent observation by the Archbishop that he wouldn't be silenced<br />
on the question of child poverty, of course, is an irrelevancy. Because if you read my<br />
speech I welcome the involvement of the Brotherhood of St Laurence in this area,<br />
congratulated them on their work and hope they continue to be involved. It was a<br />
quite separate issue. It's the issue of the protection of the integrity of politicians in<br />
this country across the spectrum. I think it's just very very dangerous if that sort of<br />
thing is allowed to go unanswered<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: And I wasn't prepared to let it go unanswered.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: So it goes specifically your personal integrity.<br />
PM: It mine and all. I mean Warwick you can try and ignore what I say that I'm<br />
not talking about politicians as a whole, I'm only talking about myself Pm talking<br />
about my own. I'm a politician. But my concern was not<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: My concern was not about myself. My concern was </p>
<p>I I ends 22<br />
PM: Well look I'm not here to have a debate with you. I'm saying that my concern is<br />
I think it is very dangerous, and I'm very very glad to see that a number of<br />
commentators have taken the point. It's extraordinarily dangerous for this country, for<br />
it to be fed into the community and particularly into the minds of young people, that<br />
all politicians are crooks, because that's what it was. That no politician is really<br />
concerned about an issue. He will only do something about an issue if he's forced into<br />
it at election time. It's as repugnant as if I were to say that all journalists are crooks,<br />
particularly at election time. I mean<br />
JOURNALIST: They weren't saying were crooks.<br />
PM: Oh, Michelle if you're saying that it is not a reflection that all politicians are<br />
crooks, to say that all politicans; will only do something about an issue if forced into it,<br />
especially at election time<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well because that's dishonest as well. Because all politicians purport, and this is<br />
true of my opponents, as well as in my own party, they purport to have a real concern<br />
and a preparedness to do things. They say that. So if you are saying that that's not the<br />
case then you are saying they are dishonest. I mean that follows as a matter of simple<br />
and irrefutable logic<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Look OK. Michelle I do not, I don't want to get into an argument with you. I<br />
mean if you want to take the view that that proposition which says that all polticians<br />
will only do something if forced into it, especially at election time, is not a reflection<br />
of the honesty and integrity of politicians that's a view you are entitled to. I simply<br />
don't share it. I say that the expression of that view is dangerous in this society,<br />
because it is not true. It is not a true reflection of the commitment of pliticians<br />
across the political spectrum, of politicians in the Liberal Party, of politicians in the<br />
National Party, of Democrats as well as people in my own Party. It is an inaccurate,<br />
and I believe, dishonest, unchristian reflection upon all politicians.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, just one thing in a broader spectrum on that. Hasn't the<br />
Opposition questioned the Government's motives on child poverty Haven't you and<br />
the Government questioned the Opposition's integrity for raising your issue. And<br />
didn't you question the Opposition's integrity for making the<br />
