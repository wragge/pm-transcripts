    <content><![CDATA[<p>Last November, I stood with Prime Minister Key at Albany in Western Australia.</p>
<p>We remembered then the convoy of Australians and New Zealanders that had sailed together in 1914, bound for war.</p>
<p>It was said that when our countrymen met: <em>“the cheering and the counter-cheering,</em> <em>the Maori war cries and the answering coo-ees would have moved a stoic</em>”.</p>
<p>Six months later, on the beaches and ridges of Gallipoli, the original Anzacs were immortalised as brothers-in-arms.</p>
<p>On days such as this, we do not glorify war, but we do acknowledge the selflessness and the comradeship of shared struggle.</p>
<p>And we honour the century-old bond that the Australia and New Zealand Army Corps established between our two countries.</p>
<p>Among the 11,500 Anzacs who perished at Gallipoli was Captain Alf Shout of the 1st Battalion, Australian Imperial Force. </p>
<p>Born in Wellington, New Zealand, he served with the Border Horse, the Stellenbosch District Mounted Troop, and the Cape Colonial Forces in the South African War.</p>
<p>It was his love for an Australian that drew him to our shores and it was as a Sydney-sider that he enlisted and sailed for Gallipoli.</p>
<p>Just before he went into battle at Lone Pine in August 1915, he said to his mate, Lance Corporal Alex McQueen, “<em>We’ll make a name for ourselves tonight Mac</em>.” </p>
<p>And surely he did. </p>
<p>As McQueen recounted, “<em>He was a lieutenant when going into the charge, became a captain the next day, gained the VC the next, and the following, eternity.”</em></p>
<p>Captain Shout has no known grave.</p>
<p>But he is known to us.</p>
<p>No longer solely Australian, no longer solely a New Zealander, he is – now and forever – an Anzac.</p>
<p>He is both our hero and yours.</p>
<p>We honour him with this memorial as we honour all the Australians and all the New Zealanders who have served together in a just cause, from Anzac Cove to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>We remember Gallipoli and the Western Front.</p>
<p>
We remember the struggle against Nazism, Fascism and militarism.</p>
<p>We remember Malaya, Korea, Borneo, Vietnam and the Middle East and we remember the many peace keeping operations around the world.</p>
<p>We remember that we stood together.</p>
<p>We always stand together.</p>
<p>Even now, our armed forces are to work together in Iraq to promote our values and to protect our people.</p>
<p>On this soil, sacred to New Zealanders, we remember the values we have fought for; we remember the men and women who have paid the ultimate price and we remember those who have returned, wounded in body and in spirit. </p>
<p>We who come after them – we who come after all who have served together in our countries’ names – owe them a debt that can never be repaid.</p>
<p>With respect for the past, we dedicate this memorial to our future, as decent self-respecting peoples whose destiny will forever be linked and whom nothing can divide.</p>
<p>On the central pillar of this memorial is inscribed one word: ‘Anzac’.</p>
<p>Charles Bean, Australia’s first and finest war correspondent, once wrote: <em>“Anzac stood, and still stands, for reckless valour in a good cause, for enterprise, resourcefulness, fidelity, comradeship and endurance that will never own defeat”.</em></p>
<p>On the cusp of our second Anzac century, on behalf of the people of Australia, I thank you for the honour you do us with this Australian National Memorial here in New Zealand.</p>
<p>We are more than friends; we are family, as this memorial will always show. </p>
