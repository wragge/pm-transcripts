CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL 8. P. M.<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CEDA DINNER SYDNEY 21 OCTOBER 1983<br />
It is eight brief months since I last addressed<br />
members of this highly respected organisation.<br />
I then did so in Melbourne in the middle of the<br />
national election campaign.<br />
The task which I then outlined was a formidable one<br />
it was to nurture economic recovery, broaden it and turn<br />
it into sustained economic growth.<br />
You would all recall that we inherited an economy<br />
in deep recession: inflation had been running at over 10 per<br />
cent through 1982; Gross Domestic Product fell in 1982-83,<br />
the first such fall since 1952-53; employment had plummeted<br />
and the unemployment rate had risen to over 10 per cent.<br />
It was a disastrous economic situation, which was<br />
getting worse. It is true that some of the influences on the<br />
economy that are beyond the control of government t-he<br />
drought and the world recession will: be much more<br />
favourable in the coming year than they were in the one just<br />
past. However, the start to recovery which that will<br />
bring -ust be coupled with policies that will promote,<br />
sustain and broaden the recovery.<br />
We are developing and implementing these policies.<br />
In our brief time in office we have also sr: cu': ed<br />
through the Summit and an extensive process of consultation<br />
with the community a necessary change in attitudes.<br />
There has been a change of community attitud-es, a<br />
change of Governmr-nt attitude; a change from confrontation<br />
towards co-operation; a chanqe from the oolitics of division<br />
to the politics of reconciliation.<br />
Provided we retain as I believe we wi ll the<br />
co-operation of the community, our policies will nrovide a<br />
firm basis for inroads to be made into the massive<br />
unemp] loyment problem that presently confronts us. </p>
<p>Over the last few months, an increasing number of<br />
economic indicators have been pointing to a halt in<br />
Australia's economic declino, and more recently to the<br />
beginnings of recovery.<br />
The September em-oloymenrit figures released last week<br />
are the latest hopeful sion.<br />
An increase in employment of 51,000 in seasonally<br />
adjusted terms, bringing to 80,000 the increase since we<br />
changed the course of Australian economic policy at the<br />
Summit in April, is oarticularly encouraging.<br />
S. '' The ' Labo'r Party . in opposi. t ion frequently ' oointed<br />
out th. a. t.-' the -human t agedy -of-unemployment extended beyond<br />
the numbers shown in the official statistics to the hidden<br />
unemployed, who had given up hope of finding jobs and<br />
withdrawn from the labour force.<br />
It is at once both a sign of renewed hope, and a<br />
reminder of the dimension of the tragedy, that recently<br />
n. u b. b he,. q. i. d-de em. pl. o. y. e h ay' beq u o..-se. e<br />
work again. This is why the measured unemployment rate rose at<br />
the same time as employment grew strongly.<br />
Our policies are directed at creating enough jobs<br />
to bring down measured unemployment as well as absorbing the<br />
hidden unemployed. But we have no illusion that this can be done<br />
quickly. We have tried to explain to the Australian people<br />
that there is no instant cure to the economic ills that we<br />
were elected to overcome.<br />
Against this backaround let us briefly consider the<br />
major issues for economic policy.<br />
We promised during the election campaign an<br />
expansionary fiscal policy, which would place a floor under<br />
aggregate demand while private investment demand remained<br />
low in recession. My Government has answered that challenge in a<br />
controlled and responsible way, in its first Budget.<br />
Among other things these fiscal policies entailed:<br />
expanded caoital works programs;<br />
stimulation of the housing sector, both public and<br />
private; and<br />
the community employment program. </p>
<p>Partly in response to our oolicies, the signs of<br />
economic recovery include strong growth in new building<br />
approvals; a pick-up in activity in many parts of<br />
manufacturing; improved consumer confidence, already oartly<br />
reflected in retail sales; and a slo,., ing in the rate of<br />
decline of new investment commitments.<br />
It has been-possible to provide more fiscal<br />
stimulus than would otherwise be the case without risking an<br />
acceleration of inflation because our policies are . suc ported<br />
tb-yh e Incomes and Prices Accord and a monetary policy which<br />
accommodates strong growth but not avoidable inflation.<br />
Through these. instruments we aim to ensure that the<br />
recoVery, is not-dis! ipated or' frittered ' away.<br />
While we eschew the discredited " Fight Inflation<br />
First" strategy of our predecessors, we nonetheless realise<br />
that we must set inflation on a downward path if we are to<br />
ensure that the recovery becomes sustained and more broadly<br />
based as it gathers pace.<br />
Apart from the direct damage to the Australian<br />
economy that would be wrought by inflation at the rate of<br />
the recent past, the continuation of poor past performance<br />
would stand in the way of continued reduction in interest<br />
rates. High inflation and interest rates discourage<br />
private consumption and investment.<br />
We believe that our Prices and Incomes Accord<br />
requires support from firm monetary oolicies if it is to<br />
deliver the deceleration of inflation that we are seeking.<br />
You will be aware of the difficulties of setting<br />
monetary policy on a course that is neither so restrictive<br />
that it blocks sustainable growth in real output, nor so<br />
loose that it encourages avoidable inflation.<br />
Our policies aim to balance these two risks..<br />
The task of finding the right balance is even more<br />
difficult at a turning point in the economy, when there is<br />
uncertainty about feasible growth in real output, and more<br />
than the usual uncertainty about factors influencing the<br />
velocity of circulation of money.<br />
And the difficulties have been further compounded<br />
in recent times by significant deregulation of bank interest<br />
rates, which have caused savings bank deposits to increase<br />
much more strongly than holdings of financial assets in<br />
other forms. </p>
<p>This has contributed to M3, the monetary aggregate<br />
which has been used in AusLralia for orojoctions of monetary<br />
growth, expanding more rapidly than the narrower and broader<br />
monetary aggregates, and so has exacerbated the normal<br />
problems associated with relying on a single aggregate for<br />
monetary policy purposes.<br />
The Treasurer in the Budget Speech announced a<br />
conditional projection of monetary growth for the current<br />
financial year, that M3 would grow in the range of 9 to 11<br />
per cent over the twelve months to the June quarter 19? 4.<br />
The Treasurer said that policy would not focus<br />
s. olely on M3, and that we -would he monitoring a range of<br />
finandcial aggregate" ith covetage* bdth narrower and-brbaroder<br />
than M3. The Treasurer also indicated that the projection<br />
would be reviewed during the year in the light of trends in<br />
activity and other relevant developments.<br />
v e r. re e e t . Imo t h s f i g u e s, J6t<br />
to the latest month" basis which attracts most attention in<br />
Australia, have been running a little above the range<br />
indicated in the Budget Speech.<br />
These M3 figures reflect a great deal of past<br />
history and are not inconsistent with our current June<br />
quarter on June quarter projections.<br />
Any revision of our expectations of real growth, or<br />
marked continuing divergence between M3 and other<br />
aggregates, would be examined in the mid-year review.<br />
While international developments completely beyond<br />
our control exercise their own powerful influence, our own<br />
policies are directed towards doing what we can to support<br />
strong, non-inflationary growth.<br />
I know that there has been concern that the<br />
Australian dollar has appreciated against the<br />
trade-weighted-index over the past seven months, to a level<br />
similar to that immediately before the March devaluation.<br />
I am aware that this has removed a competitive<br />
advantage enjoyed for a while by our exoort and<br />
import-competing industries.<br />
But I ask oroducers not to take too short a view of<br />
these issues. The overall stance of our economic oolicies is<br />
directed at improvement of Australia's competitiveness over<br />
the medium and longer term. </p>
<p>In the short-term, changes in international<br />
conditions can cause fluctuations in our competitiveness.<br />
Producers should take some comfort from our clear<br />
commitment to fighting ' inflation and unemployment at the<br />
same time, which means that we will avoid holding the<br />
exchange rate at artifically high levels, which a government<br />
might contemplate if it was fighting inflation first.<br />
Looking further ahead, we will ensure that there is<br />
not excessive co. poetition between the public and private<br />
sectors . for financ. ial resources as . recovery proceeds.<br />
We intend to wind down the cu. rrent level of direct<br />
Government stimulus to the economy as private sector<br />
investment picks up.<br />
This will limit undesirable pressure on interest<br />
rates in the process of economic recovery, and remove one<br />
threat to the durability of recovery.<br />
. Of c. ou. rse., r. educ. i q that stim. ul. us.ø wi. l]. -not. be-.. easy:..<br />
To assist, we have establ. ished an ongoing orocess<br />
of expenditure review that will not only consider any<br />
proposals for new expenditure, but will also look at<br />
existing programs to ensure the greatest possible efficiency<br />
and their continued relevance to the emerging needs of the<br />
economy. In our first Budget we were able to reduce the<br />
prospective deficit that we inherited by over half a billion<br />
dollars, at the same time as we implemented much of our<br />
program. We were able to do this without major general<br />
increases in taxation because we made large reductions in<br />
the programs and tax expenditures which we inherited.<br />
In other words, we effected a substantial<br />
reordering of expenditure priorities.<br />
In future Budgets we would hope to continue to give<br />
effect to that reordering.<br />
As I stressed in my address to CEDA during the<br />
campaign, Governments cannot sustain recovery on their own.<br />
We require the co-operation and contribution of all sectors.<br />
That is why the Prices and Incomes Accord is so<br />
vital. As I said to you back in February the essential<br />
function of the Accord is to create the setting for real<br />
economic growth without this blowing out in self-defeating<br />
pressures on inflation and the balance of payments. </p>
<p>It provides a clear framework for the settlement of<br />
income claims. It serves as the basis upon which we can expect<br />
claims upon the communi'ty's resources to be geared to the<br />
capacities of the economy and the requirements for optimum<br />
development. Successful imolementation of the Accord gives us a<br />
chance to avoid the disruption caused by unnecessary<br />
arguments about division of the economic cake which, in the<br />
past, has A' led so oft'Sse n. a o' to part of thsu e caket. h being l. ost.<br />
f* c m i r 0 u p<br />
A b' ad base o'f cof u'ni'ty Suppor't' " now"'<br />
Accord Importantly, some key elements of the Prices and<br />
Incomes Accord received support at the Summit and more<br />
recently at both the A. C. T. U. Congress and in the<br />
Arbitration Commission's ruling on the National Wage Case.<br />
At the National . Wage. Case the.. Government so. ught . tp.<br />
strike a balance between short and longer term economic and<br />
industrial relations considerations within the framework of<br />
an effective Prices and Incomes Policy.<br />
Accordingly we supported full indexation on a<br />
six-monthly basis, on the condition that there should be no<br />
extra claims. The Government argued and the Commission accepted<br />
that ratification of sectional settlements should be refused<br />
unless the commission judged that special or extraordinary<br />
circumstances apply, such that they can be isolated because<br />
of their special characteristics.<br />
It is for the Commission to determine such<br />
ci rcumstances. It is only if we can restrain growth in labour<br />
costs and competing claims that we can pursue an<br />
expansionary fiscal policy while winding down inflation.<br />
My Government is committed to the success of the<br />
Centralised Wage Fixation System now established by the<br />
Arbitration Commission.<br />
The principles articulated by the Arbitration<br />
Commission recently amount to a new system.<br />
The Commission's requirement that unions olace<br />
th-ir signatures on commitments to no extrg claim.-is is<br />
unprecedented. </p>
<p>The willingness of the A. C. T. U. and almost all<br />
unions to commit themselves in this way is unori-cedented in<br />
Australian industrial relations.<br />
That such powerful unions as the A. M. W. F. S. U. are<br />
willing to enter such commitments is a cause for<br />
considerable confidence in the new arrangements.<br />
Inevitably there will be problems, but the<br />
advantages of two years of real wage stability and<br />
industrial peace within the new system are so great, that<br />
all parties have a great incentive to find solutions.<br />
We have-inciicated our resolve and seek the<br />
continued co-operation of all parties in making the new<br />
system work. Both my Government and the A. C. T. U. will be doing<br />
everything within our respective powers to ensure compliance<br />
by all unions. It has always been our view that restraint cannot<br />
be limited to wage and salary earners.<br />
ThG Economic Summit declared that restraint in<br />
income claims should be shared by all, including non-wage<br />
incomes. In seeking to have this declaration implemented, I<br />
have been impressed by the attitude of larger companies and<br />
the degree to which they have indicated their support for<br />
restraint. The Summit, of course, was the first demonstration<br />
of what has since become a hallmark of my Government. That<br />
is our approach to consultation, co-operation and joint<br />
endeavour. One formalised manifestation of this approach is<br />
our establishment of the Economic Plannino Advisory Council.<br />
This Council has just concluded its second meeting.<br />
Discussion ranged over a number of matters,<br />
including the conduct of policy from the perspective of<br />
ensuring long term recovery.<br />
As time passes we would expect this body to orovide<br />
a major forum for discussion and information exchange<br />
between the Government and the community general] y.<br />
My Government is concerned to restore conditions of<br />
fairness and equity to Australian society. </p>
<p>This is an important objective in itself for a<br />
Labor Government. In addition, we believe that this is essential to<br />
community support for t. he structural change in the economy<br />
that is a necessary part of sustained economic growth.<br />
There is no doubt that the qeneral taxpayer is<br />
bearing significant burdens in supporting Government<br />
expenditure in suoporting assistance to those affected<br />
by the recession and to other needy peoonle in the community.<br />
If we are to have the taxoayers' support in that<br />
expenditure, then two major things must be achieved.<br />
One is that expenditure must be seen to be<br />
efficient and to reach those for whom it is intended.<br />
This is particularly true of social welfare<br />
expenditures, where the needy must be helped.<br />
Abuse of the system and hand-outs to those not<br />
truly in need must be avoided wherever possible.<br />
We have tackled inequities in the oension system,<br />
with the revised income test arrangements for pensioners<br />
over 70 and the proposed re-introduction of the assets test.<br />
The explicit aim has been to enable welfare<br />
expenditure to be directed to those individuals most in<br />
need. We have been concerned to remove fundamental<br />
inequities in both the tax and oension systems.<br />
We stand ready to consult and discuss these<br />
measures with those affected.<br />
The details of the assets test on pensions are, for<br />
example, still being worked out and we are consultinq widely<br />
before taking final decisions.<br />
The second necessary task is to ensure that the tax<br />
system is fair and seen to be fair.<br />
In this area we recognise the need for a thorouqh<br />
review of Australia's taxation system.<br />
I am convinced more needs to be done to widen the<br />
revenue base and improve taxation efficiency and equity.<br />
The economic planning advisory council has begun a<br />
review of the previous studies concerning the revenue base. </p>
<p>This is an area where we shall be consulting<br />
widely. While giving considerable weight to stability and<br />
continuity in policy we shall be carefully reviewing the<br />
alternatives. We have already moved in some areas to make the<br />
taxation system both more efficient and more equitable.<br />
This. is illustrated by the measures we have<br />
introduced on taxation of superannpation lump sums, tax....<br />
avoidance, section 26( A), sales tax and excise anomalies,<br />
. indexation of excise--rates and removalof someanomalous tax<br />
expenditures Our concern is to establish a tax and welfare<br />
system appropriate to the long-term needs of Australia.<br />
This has a counterpart in what my Government aims<br />
to achieve in the area of industry policy.<br />
It ' is essential for Auistra]. ian industry greatly to<br />
improve its efficiency.<br />
The entrenchment of low productivity and<br />
inappropriate production patterns in many parts of the<br />
economy is a matter of deep concern.<br />
The need for adaptation by traditional industries<br />
is compelling and a growing role for new technology-based<br />
industries must be recognised.<br />
The development of new products and processes is a<br />
pressing priority. The steel industry assistance package stands as a<br />
model for the manner in which it balances employment<br />
considerations with recognition of the need for workers and<br />
business in that industry to enhance its competitive<br />
position through investment in new technologies.<br />
Similarly the establishment of the Car Industry<br />
Council to look at ways of increasing the industry's<br />
efficiency and productivity with the aim of improving its<br />
competitiveness on both domestic and export markets is<br />
another significant indicator of the Government's interest<br />
in the rationalisation of our industry structures.<br />
These then are the major elements in the<br />
Government's aooroach to movina the economy forward.<br />
The Government has put in place policies which will<br />
promote a sustained recovery that ultimately will pea back<br />
unemployrment and maintain and enhance the living standards<br />
of all Australians. </p>
<p>0 1 0.<br />
You would all appreciate how much progress has been<br />
made in the brief time my Government has been in office.<br />
When I suggested eight months aco to CEDA that a<br />
. Labor Government's economic policies would be directed<br />
towards the imorovement of real Australian living standards<br />
by creating the circumstances for real economic growth you<br />
may have been a little sceptical.<br />
I am sure you would all now agree that the<br />
comprehensive range of policies put in place are both<br />
appropriate to that objective and already proving effective<br />
in its realisation. UltimatiE success crucially depends howev. er on the..<br />
continued co-operation of all Australians.<br />
The challenge back in February was not a challenge<br />
for the Government alone, but for the entire Australian<br />
community. This continues to be the challenge today.<br />
As a nation we must dedicate ourselves to the task.<br />
My. Government is providing the necessary leadership<br />
ana DOIcles. What we continue to need is the continued<br />
co-operation of all Australians in matching up to the<br />
challenge we all face together as Australians. </p>
