    <content><![CDATA[<p>Rural communities suffering through extreme drought will be eligible for Commonwealth assistance as part of a new $333 million support package.</p>
<p>This Commonwealth Government investment is an acknowledgment of the difficulties being experienced by farmers and by the communities they help to sustain.</p>
<p>It is critical these communities remain viable and that people stay in jobs so that they can take advantage of better conditions when the drought breaks.</p>
<p>Helping farmers through times of drought is in our national interest. Despite unprecedented drought conditions in some parts of the country and a third failed wet season in large parts of the north, Australia’s agriculture sector will contribute an estimated $52 billion to the economy this financial year. </p>
<p>In recognition of the drought’s effects on farming businesses and regional communities, the Commonwealth Government will provide:<br />
•	$35 million for shovel-ready, local infrastructure and employment projects. Funding will be targeted at projects that offer the greatest potential to stimulate local spending, use local resources and provide lasting benefit to the community.<br />
•	$25.8 million for programmes to manage pest animals and weeds in drought-affected areas. This measure will provide work for rural contractors while assisting landowners to deal with the impact of feral animals on livestock and pasture.<br />
•	$20 million to expand existing social and community support programmes. This additional funding will improve access to mental health support and counselling services for drought-affected families and communities.<br />
•	$1.8 million to fund additional rural financial counsellors in drought-affected areas.<br />
•	$250 million in 2015–16 to continue access to existing drought specific concessional loans schemes.<br />
These measures build upon existing Commonwealth support to farmers experiencing hardship, such the Farm Household Allowance, which is currently flowing to over 4,800 farmers or their partners.</p>
<p>Over the past two years the Commonwealth has provided around $190 million to support drought-stricken farmers and approved $270 million in concessional loans to 531 farm businesses.</p>
<p>Further measures to support farmers who are preparing themselves for the damaging effects of drought will be announced in the forthcoming Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper.</p>
