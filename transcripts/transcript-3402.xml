or I PRESS STATEMENT NO. 334'<br />
September 1974<br />
DEVALUATION STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
This is the most important single economic decision<br />
we have taken this year. Its main effect its basic purposeis<br />
to mnake it easier to sell our goods overseas.<br />
This means bigger markets abroad for our farm products<br />
and minerals and manufactured goods.<br />
It will make it easier for our exporters to compete<br />
in overseas markets; it will make it easier for local<br />
manufacturers to compete with imported goods.<br />
I believe this decision will give an immediate boost<br />
to general business confidence.<br />
It will improve the prospects in our rural industrioe3-.<br />
It will give added confidence to the motor industry,<br />
textile manufacturers, and local manufacturers of appliances,<br />
electronic goods and a whole range of other products.<br />
It will safeguard the jobs of Australian workers who<br />
may be threatened by import competition. It will reduce unemploymen~ t<br />
our mining industries -copper, nickel, lead, zinc will<br />
benefit from our action. The recent decline in their prices will<br />
be cushioned by the new value of the dollar.<br />
We have always been flexible in our approach to the exchange<br />
rate. Along with most other countries we are prepared to vary<br />
the exchange rate when economic conditions make it necessary to<br />
do so. </p>
<p>OF -2-<br />
Last year we twice increased the value of the dollar.<br />
Our exports last year far exceeded our imports. Our reserves<br />
were at record levels.<br />
In that situation it mnade sense to appreciate the value<br />
of the dollar. That policy succeeded completely.<br />
Now it is appropriate to reduce the value of the dollar<br />
and improve the prospects of our export industries.<br />
Our decision means that we will also be cutting the fixed<br />
link with the U. S. dollar.<br />
This action means that the external value of our currency<br />
will remain generally stable against that of our competitors<br />
and trading partners overseas.<br />
Unless we decide to change the rate of our dollar it will<br />
now keep a stable value compared with other major currencies<br />
such as the Japanese Yen, the German Mark and Sterling.<br />
As a result of our decision I believe the whole community<br />
unions, businessmen, farmers, manufacturers, exporters can look<br />
forward to better markets, better trade, better business and more<br />
secure employment.<br />
