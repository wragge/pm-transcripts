PRESS RELEASE BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER, THE RT HON.<br />
J. D. ANTHONY, MP<br />
PROPOSAL FOR SPECIAL PREMIERS CONFERENCE<br />
All of us have become increasingly concerned at the increase<br />
in unemployment.<br />
This has resulted not only from the growing effects of the<br />
international economic recession on the Australian economy,<br />
but also the rapid escalation of wages in Australia in<br />
recent times.<br />
This very substantial increase in wages over the last few<br />
years has-cost a large number-of Australians their jobs.<br />
Over the most recent six months average ordinary time e~ arnings<br />
of Australian males went up at annual rates approaching 17 per<br />
cent when in other O. E. C. D. countries wage increases were<br />
reflecting sober assessments of the need to save jobs; over<br />
the most recent six months. for which data are available,<br />
the annual rate of wage increase has been about 8 per cent<br />
for the O. E. C. D. as a whole and under 5 per cent in the U. S.<br />
Although the Budget contained a significant-niumnber of measures<br />
to cope with the worsening employment situation, the position<br />
has deteriorated even more rapidly than was thought likely<br />
at the time of the Budget.<br />
The Government is conscious of the strong and growing sentiment<br />
in the community for wage restraint in the interests of saving<br />
jobs.<br />
The Government believes the time has now arrived for those<br />
in the community who have jobs to sacrifice a future wage<br />
increase in the hope that this will help those in the<br />
community who do not have jobs or who run the risk of losing<br />
their jobs over coming months. ./ 2 </p>

The Government has therefore decided to call a meeting of<br />
Premiers and the Chief Minister in Canberra on 7 December to<br />
consider proposals for a series of measures, including a 12<br />
month pause in award wage increases in the public and private<br />
sectors. The Government seeks the full support of the States and the<br />
Northern Territory in this initiative.<br />
We also seek the support and participation of the employers<br />
and the unions.<br />
The proposal is that there should not only be a pause in wage<br />
and salary incomes, but also other-incomes of different kinds<br />
throughout the economy.<br />
No measure would be likely to have a more beneficial effect-on<br />
a deteriorating employment position than what is now being<br />
proposed by the Government.<br />
If the pause is achieved, there will be made available savings<br />
from budgets at all levels of Governments in respect of<br />
expenditure which would otherwise have had to be incurred to<br />
pay rising wages and salaries. Some hundreds of millions<br />
of dollars would be involved.<br />
It is an integral part of the Government's proposal that these<br />
savings should be devoted to expenditure on employment related<br />
activities. The details of this would be the subject of<br />
discussion with the States and the Northern Territory.<br />
I and a number of my colleagues propose over the next few days<br />
to discuss the Government's initiative with all of the Premiers<br />
and the Chief Minister. During these discussions the initiative<br />
will be outlined in more detail.<br />
This initiatLve demonstrates the Government's determination to<br />
do all it can to save jobs and to take practical and lasting<br />
steps to help employment. It is the Government's hope that<br />
this initiative will receive strong support from all sections<br />
of the community.<br />
