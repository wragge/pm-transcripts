PM No. 39/ 196).<br />
FOR PRESS STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
RESIGNATION OF THE MINISTER FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT<br />
SQe. months ago, Senator Sir ", illiam Spooner, Minister<br />
for National Development and Leader of the Government in the Senate, and<br />
Acting Prime Minister in September 1962, told me that, after an uncommonly<br />
long, continuoes and arduous period of Ministerial service, he would like<br />
me to agree that, at some convenient time towards the middle of this<br />
year, he might resign from the Cabinet, while still continuing to serve<br />
in the Senate. e discussed this at considerable length. I knew that<br />
She had made great and patriotic sacrifices of his personal and<br />
professional interests, and that he had every right to return to normal<br />
family life. On the other hand, T was, as the head of the government,<br />
conscious of my own natural desire to retain the services of a Minister<br />
who had, with unsurpassed devotion and concentration of effort, achieved<br />
so much in the establishment of a firm foundation for the great Snowy<br />
Mountains Scheme, in the development of water resources along the Murray<br />
and elsewhere, in the improvement of the coal mining and marketing<br />
industries, in the encouragement of bauxite minmng, of uranium production,<br />
of oil search, indeed of mineral development gancrally, particularly in<br />
the North of Australia. His name will always be remembered in connection<br />
with Northern Development, from the Ord River to the new beef ro'. ds of<br />
Queensland. To these I must add his persistent activity in the field<br />
of housing, in War Service Homes, and in the periodic negotiations of<br />
Commonwealth-State Housing agreements, and in the provision of funds<br />
for Building Societies. But, conscious and proud as I was of these notable<br />
achievements, I did net feel able to deny his request. I felt, and feel,<br />
that so long and sustained and successful an effort of public service<br />
had earned him a period of private or semi-private life.<br />
Accordingly, Sir William has today tendered his<br />
resignation from the office of Minister for National Development. This<br />
is a great loss to the Government. It is for me a real deprivation.<br />
Our close association and friendship have been a source of strength to<br />
me over the years. No Prime Minister could have had a more faithful<br />
colleague, or one more devoted to the highest interests of the growth<br />
of the nation.<br />
CANBERPRA 2nd June, 1964. </p>
<p>I received the following letter from Senator Sir William Spooner:<br />
" My dear Prime Minister, I now formally tender my resignation to you as a<br />
Minister of State. As you know I have had it in mind to do this for<br />
some months past. After my lengthy service in Cabinet now in its<br />
fifteenth year and permitting insufficient time to attend to my fown<br />
personal affairs, I woula wish to be relieved of Ministerial duties<br />
so that I could, under less continuous pressure, pay more attention<br />
to my own professional and business interests.<br />
0 I have been happy to have your understanding of my<br />
desires and your agreement to permit me to give effect to them.<br />
I know that I will miss the interesting work of my<br />
portfolio and of Cabinet. I will however continue as a Senator<br />
and be able to assist the Government in that capacity.<br />
1 take pride in having been on3 of your M1inisters<br />
for so long and in the friendships which I have made with you, our<br />
Smutual inisterial colleagues, and so many others."<br />
and have sent the following reply:<br />
" Thank you for your letter of 29th May. I am<br />
issuing a statement to the press in the terms which I attach; that<br />
statement will, I hope, reasonably express my feelings on this<br />
occasion. You carry with you, of course, my warmest friendship<br />
and good wishes. As, in point of practice, it will be necessary to<br />
have a formal letter of resignation from yourself to the Governor-<br />
General and as there will be some Ministerial re-arrangements to<br />
be made, I would be grateful if you would allow me to hold your<br />
resignation for a few days before actually presenting it to His<br />
Excellency. Kindest regards."<br />
JUNE 2, 1964. </p>
