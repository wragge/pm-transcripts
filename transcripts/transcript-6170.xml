ASRL<br />
FOR MEDIA 5 August 1983<br />
The Prime Minister today sent the attached letter to the Tasmanian<br />
Premier, Mr Gray. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CANBElER RA<br />
August 1983<br />
My dear Premier<br />
I have your letter of 3 August protesting about the<br />
Commonwealth's decision to terminate funding for the<br />
Crotty Road project, and your telex of that date in which<br />
you seek a meeting between Commonwealth Ministers and<br />
myself on the one hand, and yourself, the Commissioner of<br />
the Hydro-Electric Commission and State officials on the<br />
other. It is putting it mildly to say that I regret that you<br />
have chosen to write in this way and to impugn, totally<br />
without foundation, the approach of the Commonwealth to<br />
this matter. There has never been any question of our<br />
intention to ensure that the workers of the Gordonbelow-<br />
Franklin scheme are not disadvantaged, and there<br />
should be no need for me** to have to repeat it. I<br />
believe our actions have been entirely consistent with<br />
this aim.<br />
It seems to me, however, that your view is that our mutual<br />
objectives of finding alternative employment for the<br />
workers can be pursued without any regard to the interests<br />
of the Australian community as a whole. If this is not so,<br />
I would like very much to know how you would expect the<br />
Commonwealth to justify to the general taxpayer, in<br />
Tasmania and elsewhere in Australia, expenditure on the<br />
Huon Southern Outlet road project that would employ only<br />
men for a matter of months at an annual cost per man<br />
approaching $ 200,000. I would also like very much to know<br />
how you would expect the Commonwealth to justify continued<br />
expenditure on construction of a road I refer, of course,<br />
to the Crotty Road on which our Governments have clearly<br />
been unable to agree as to its ultimate function and which<br />
your Government has now announced will in any event be<br />
partially submerged by the waters of the proposed King<br />
River hydro scheme. I say quite forthrightly to you that<br />
I cannot see how any such justification can possibly be<br />
found.<br />
Let me remind you again of the nature of the original<br />
Commonwealth offer contained in my letter of 1 July, for<br />
it appears to me that you have either misunderstood it or<br />
have chosen to misrepresent it. In doing so may I also<br />
remind you of the extraordinarily difficult circumstances<br />
in which the Commonwealth was placed in this matter by the / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
refusal of your Government, until the eleventh hour, to<br />
discuss even in the most general terms the possible form<br />
of an alternative works program. These great difficulties<br />
notwithstanding, we were ready on the day of the High<br />
Court's decision to put proposals to you for at least<br />
starting the process of protecting the interests of the<br />
workers. In regard to the Crotty Road, my letter of 1 July states,<br />
after noting issues to which our Governments would need<br />
to give some detailed consideration, " For the very immediate<br />
future, however, I suggest that wie allow work to continue<br />
in order to maintain the workforce and to keep options open<br />
for subsequent development if that is further agreed." It<br />
is now clear that, for the reasons I have already given in<br />
writing to you and in subsequent public statements, that<br />
there is no such agreement on subsequent development. Our<br />
action in terminating the project has been totally<br />
consistent, therefore, with what I wrote to you on 1 July.<br />
As to the Huon Southern Outlet project, my letter of 1 July<br />
stated we could ( my underlining) therefore agree to<br />
a number of the proposed projects proceeding forthwith<br />
( including) the Southern Outlet ( Huon Road) I went on<br />
to say " As to the basis on which the Commonwealth would<br />
provide funds for projects the Commonwealth would, of course,<br />
wish to be satisfied that the costs of such projects are<br />
reasonable ( my underlining) You will know that, when<br />
cost data on the projects I referred to in that letter was<br />
subsequently received by my Government, we expressed a<br />
general concern about the high cost per man directly employed<br />
see my letter of 15 July. In respect of the Huon Southern<br />
Outlet project, this cost was so high as to make it quite<br />
obvious that, in the terms of my letter of 1 July, the<br />
Commonwealth could not be satisfied that the cost of the<br />
project was reasonable. It therefore had no option but to<br />
refuse to fund it.<br />
In these matters the Commonwealth has at all times acted<br />
fairly and honourably, in the interests of the workers, of<br />
Tasmania, and of Australia as a whole. That some lines of<br />
approach we had hoped to be able to pursue later proved to<br />
be unworkable is regrettable, but the prime responsibility<br />
for that situation must rest squarely on your Government<br />
for its failure to co-operate in the development of proper<br />
contingency plans, despite repeated requests from the<br />
Commonwealth to do so. If this had been done it would have<br />
been possible to organize a smooth transition to alternative<br />
work projects, and the present difficulties could have been<br />
avoided. I must say that I had hoped that there would have been no<br />
need for further exchange between us on this matter. You<br />
have left me with no choice, however, but to put the record<br />
straight. Now that that has been done I hope you will agree<br />
that recriminations should stop and that we should now set<br />
about the task before us in a renewed spirit of co-operation,<br />
and in the interests of those whose livelihood has been<br />
affected. That has always been the Commonwealth's aim. / 3 </p>
<p>As to your proposal for a meeting, I have to say that while<br />
I am always ready to discuss matters with you if there is any<br />
prospect of our mutual aims being advanced, I am not sure<br />
that a meeting on the lines you appear to have in mind<br />
would assist materially at this time. I am furthermore<br />
reluctant to agree to such a meeting in view of the<br />
misrepresentations you have made about our discussions on<br />
July when you agreed, in the presence of your officials<br />
and mine, that construction of the Crotty Road should not<br />
proceed. As I have indicated in my various letters to you, we are<br />
working as rapidly as possible towards the development of<br />
suitable arrangements under which our two Governments can<br />
operate, and expect to be in a position in the near future<br />
to put further proposals to you. I suggest that the<br />
possibility of a further meeting, and the nature of that<br />
meeting, should be deferred until after that time, when it<br />
could, if you then still wish, be re-examined. In the meantime<br />
I would expect the opportunity to be taken for further useful<br />
discussions between our ministers, such as those recently<br />
held by Mr Cohen and Mr Pearsall, and between officials of<br />
our two Governments.<br />
There would in any event be practical problems in seeking<br />
to arrange a meeting in the near future. As you will recall<br />
from our discussions on 25 July, I have commitments in<br />
Queensland next week and I understood from you that you<br />
would be unavailable in the following week, which in any<br />
event is likely to be a busy one for me as it is the week<br />
leading up to the opening of the Budget Sittings of the<br />
Parliament. Yours sincerely<br />
R. J. L. Hawke<br />
The Hon. Robin Gray, MHA<br />
Premier of Tasmania<br />
HOBART TAS. 7000 </p>
