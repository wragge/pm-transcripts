LIBERAL PARTY RALLY<br />
AT WAYVILLE<br />
MONDAY, 13TH FE13RUARY. 1961<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies.<br />
Sir Mr. Premier, parliamentary colleagues and ladies and<br />
genllemen: I think I must indulge myself in the luxury of making<br />
just one reference to what has just fallen from the lips of the<br />
Premier. He says that with one exception, not myself, the<br />
Prime Ministers with whom he has dealt have been very tough. All<br />
I can say to you is they needed to be! ( Laughter, applause)<br />
But although we have been as tough as we could I<br />
think we have been just, as might be demonstrated without much<br />
difficulty if we were discussing that kind of thing.<br />
Now I want to tell you that I regard this as the most<br />
astonishing meeting I have ever seen. When they told me that we<br />
would have a rally in this Hall, I thought that this was the<br />
triumph of hope over experience to get thousands of people<br />
into one place, and particularly to got them into one place at<br />
one time. Therefore I find this a very, very inspiriting<br />
occasion. And I think it is an occasion, as a rally of our<br />
Party, to state, as compactly as I can, what our faith is and<br />
what we are doing about it-and to explain to you some of the<br />
things in recent times that may seem to be a little mysterious.<br />
I want to do that because it is said and said repeatedly, that<br />
we have a changing policy I think I remember the expression<br />
" stop and go" that we change our minds very frequently. I<br />
mention this to you because there is also a school of thought to<br />
the effect that we don't know up at Canberra what is going on;<br />
and that we are insulated from public opinion. Don't you<br />
believe it we hear quite a lot of it. And one of the things<br />
we hear is that the Governrent doesn't know its own mind: it<br />
introduces a Budget; it introduces, a few months latert some<br />
supplementary measures. This, of course, couldn't happen in a<br />
well-governed country; and doesn't happen, presumably, in other<br />
countries. The fact that in Great Britain the mothar country of<br />
our race, with enormous financial and economic problems, the<br />
Bank rate, which is their controlling mechanism for the economy<br />
goes up, goes down again two months later, goes up three months<br />
later, comes down six weeks later appears to escape the notice<br />
of people. Now why is it that changes havo to be made? I think I<br />
am going to demonstrate to you tonight that we, on your behalf,<br />
as Liberals of this country, have had and retain a constant<br />
policy; but that we have enough intelligence to know that a<br />
constant policy must be applied to changing circumnstances and<br />
must not pretend that the circumstances have not changed, In<br />
ether words a constant policy with variable applications to<br />
changing circumstances. Of course there were simpler days. I think I was<br />
reminding a fine audienco at lunch time that back at a period<br />
not remembered by half the population of Australia, or two<br />
thirds, at a period 30 years ago, when we had a great depression<br />
in Australia and whlere genuine distress on a great scale swept<br />
ever the country, we had, early in 1933, 30% of unemployment in<br />
Australia. Think of it 3016. Then it canie down to </p>
<p>And the Lyons Goverrmeont cane in. It introduced a sense of<br />
Atability, a senso of belief and confidence in the country-and<br />
it remained thaere for a long time. But by the time the Lyons<br />
Government itself came to an end we still had 10% of the work<br />
force of Australia unemployed. And this was regarded as<br />
something so remarkable compared with what had happened th4t the<br />
people of Australia accepted it.<br />
Now, of course if you live in a comunity which is<br />
prepared to accept 10 or 9 or 8 or 7 or 6% of unemployment as a<br />
commonplace, as they do in the United States, as indeed they do<br />
a good deal of the time in Canada then the business of<br />
Government becomes easy. But justice to the community becomes<br />
inadequate. AInd we stand for justice to the community.<br />
Therefore we have set as our goal theo maintenance of an<br />
extraordinarily high level of employmient in Australia. ( Applause)<br />
If we had not done that, if we were living in the prewar<br />
period as I gather some of our critics think we are we<br />
would. not be worried about 2 or 3 or of unemployment, because<br />
this would be something that the community would accept. But<br />
today, this nation stands committed to a policy of full<br />
employment not over-full employment with its rising costs and<br />
its excessive overtime and its rapid labour turnover; nor<br />
material unemployment with its social injustice and its human<br />
bitterness. We stand for a policy which requires a fine balance.<br />
Now I emphasise that to you. This requires a fine balance to<br />
have your people employed; not to have the relative economic<br />
disaster of unfilled jobs so that work doesn't go on adequately;<br />
not to have the social disaster of unfilled stomachs in decent<br />
homes, Now whatever the so-called experts may say, when you<br />
hpaovlei cya wphoilcichy iwsh itcheh mroesqtu irdeisf fiac uflitn e thbianlga ncien, thteh enw oyrolud thoa vem aiantain.<br />
Figuratively speaking if one wanted to go across Niagara Falls in<br />
the old days when there was plenty of room for manoeuvre and<br />
somiebody built a nice wide bridge, it would be quite easy.' You<br />
could wander from side to side of the bridge, you had plenty of<br />
room. But a finely balanced policy requires that you should walk<br />
the tight-rope like Blondin. And Blondin, I am credibly<br />
informed, though he wasn't one of my intimate friends, managed to<br />
maintain himself on a tight rope by a vast series of moves to<br />
right and left to preserve the balance.<br />
Now that is a metaphorical expression, but I think it<br />
will convey to you what I have in my mind. Because if the idea<br />
is full employment, full employment in the presence of enormous<br />
national developm~ ent, of a vast immigration programme of all<br />
the problems that are associated with a rising population, it is<br />
not a policy that can be maintained by stupid people who, having<br />
said in August, " That's our policy for the next 12 months",<br />
leave it alone. The circumstances change; something happens.<br />
So far as I am concerned, I will always regard myself as your<br />
leader and as your Prime Minister, not only at liberty, but<br />
compelled to make whatever changes from time to time may be<br />
necessary in order to maintain the central policy that we stand<br />
for. ( Applause) Now, Sir, let mie remind everybody here of what our<br />
po'licy is, this constant policy. Because I emphasise that the<br />
policy is constant.<br />
. At home we have for 11 years by the time of the next<br />
election 12 years continuously stood for national development<br />
to the limit of our physical resources. If anybody cares to<br />
look around lustralia and com-pare it with what it was 11 years<br />
ago, it must be admnitted that the development in this country has<br />
been fabulous. ( Applause) </p>
<p>You know it is the old story. If we see people every<br />
day we don't seo much change in them. Some people see me<br />
occasionally having seen me almost every day, and they say,<br />
" By jove, old nan you're looking well". But evary now and then<br />
I run across a fellow who hasn't seen me for ten years and he has<br />
quite a different story. You see he sees the changes after' an<br />
interval of a decade; whereas other people whi-are on the mat,<br />
so to speak, constantly, do not.<br />
But I occasionally speak to people from overseas,<br />
people with great affairs -to consider and to conduct and without<br />
exception they say to no, " I wouldn't have believed that I could<br />
see such a change in a country in ten years". Well of courses<br />
I didn't do it; you didn't do it. But somebody did~ it. The<br />
people of Australia did it. And the people of Australia would<br />
not have thought fit to do it unless Government had been<br />
sufficiently sensible and sufficiently encouraging to develop<br />
the climate in which this great growthi would occur. This has<br />
been the most remarkable decade of developmient in the history of<br />
Australia. A" nd if, after the next election, for some reason or<br />
other, the people of Australia decide that they want to entrust<br />
their fortunes to the Calwells and the Wards and the Cairnses<br />
and so on, all right! That will be their choice. I donft think<br />
they will make it. But at any rate, so far as I am concerned I<br />
will look back with pride on what has occurred. ( Applause)<br />
Now behind national development we believe in large<br />
immigration as an aid to national development. There again<br />
people can simplify things. They can say, " But of course, that's<br />
elementary". It isn't elementary. Every time you have a little<br />
flurry of unemployment in one place or another, you will hear<br />
somebody say " tWe must cut down on immigration". We have<br />
believed, ana. believe, that the flow of good people, with a<br />
variety of cultures and experiences, and backgrounds into this<br />
country is giving to us a strength, a vigour, a-variety of minds<br />
which we would never otherwise have acquired. We believe that<br />
a large movement of immigration into Australia is of the essence<br />
of national development.<br />
I know there are some people I think there are some<br />
sitting'on the other side of the House who think that what we<br />
ought to do in Australia is to wrap our garments about us and<br />
live in a state of splendid isolation, keeping all imports out,<br />
isolating ourselves from the affairs of the world, not letting<br />
all these strange people come in. What sort of a notion is<br />
this, of a great nation?<br />
Why, before the war I think I have said this to you<br />
before we wore told by exports that e would never have a<br />
population of more than 7j million in Australia; and that it<br />
would take until 1975 to reach that point; and that in the<br />
meantime we would be Lgetting older and older. Of course I<br />
would, you would this is the law of life. But what they told<br />
us was that the percentage of old people would grow; and the<br />
percentage of young earning, contributing people would fall.<br />
Now that was the doia of 1938 23 years ago.<br />
And today, are we looking forward to having 7j million<br />
in 1975? On the contrary! We have 10-2k millions already. And<br />
what we will have in 1975 I leave to your imagination. So far<br />
from having a structure of society in which more and more old<br />
people will be supported by less and less young people the<br />
period from 1960 to 1970 is -, oing to be a decade in which the<br />
avrae age of the community will fall, in whiich more and rmore<br />
young people will be available as a percentage of the community,<br />
to build to construct, to support. That means that the decad6<br />
from 1966 to 1970 will alimOst inevitably be a greater periodof<br />
development in A1ustralia than the decade from 1950 to 1960. I </p>
<p>0 4.<br />
find this a stimulating idea.<br />
" Bliss was it in that dawrn to bc alive,<br />
But to be young was very heaven! 1<br />
This is a period of time in which you and I tonight<br />
merely pause in this developmeont, to recapture a decent<br />
satisfaction with the last ton years; and to kindle our<br />
imagination about the next ten years.<br />
tie have had in this tine, as part of our policy,<br />
increased production, industrial peace, which, in spite of a few<br />
sporadic outbursts, has never boon , Yreater than it has been in<br />
the last ten years.<br />
But all these things national development, the<br />
demand for capital, the demand for great public works, necessary<br />
public works, the growth of the population the search for<br />
increased production plus full , mploymenl have to be achieved,<br />
if we are to do our best, without creating an inflationary boom.<br />
You can have them all without trouble if you don't mind<br />
inflation. But they all put a pressure on human and financial<br />
and economic resources which will of course produce an<br />
inflationary boom unless every now and then a Government has the<br />
elementary courage to take a ' Lew stops to restrain it.<br />
Our policy has meant adequate social services; it has<br />
mecant adequate modern defence; it has meant, in spite of<br />
cynical onlookers, a considerable restraint upon the level of<br />
taxation. But it has, of course, included in all these things<br />
in this modern and complicated world, credit and currency<br />
controls to achieve growth with stability and to do justice to<br />
the demands for capital for public undertakings and capital for<br />
private business and industrial expansion.<br />
I want to pause to say a word about that. One of our<br />
troubles is that when we look at these difficult matters we<br />
occasionally like to draw a hard line of distinction between one<br />
thing or another that's black, or that's white; that's right<br />
or * that's wrong. find the result is that you will hear people<br />
say quite earnestly that the great conflict in the demand for<br />
capital for development is a conflict between the Government and<br />
private business. I want to say to you it is nothing of the kind<br />
You consider what the public works are; you look at<br />
your own State and see the works that have been carried out.<br />
Take, by way of example, one that I know something about<br />
because the Commonwealth found the money for it: that is the<br />
railway line through Leigh Creek to Maree. Without this line,<br />
without the developments that occur in those circumastances the<br />
use of coal in South Australia, its own coal, would have been<br />
restricted; it would have been i:,, ore difficult to produce power.<br />
And without power how would the private business expansion in<br />
the States get on? It is a single, simple example.<br />
I can hardly think of a solitary public work conducted<br />
by either Commonwealth or State and between us we conduct a<br />
public works programme which runs up to the better part of<br />
Å 400 million a year I can hardly imagine one element in it<br />
which does not provide the essential foundation for private<br />
business expansion. How can any man expand a factory? How can any man<br />
go in for some great new enterprise unless he has power at his<br />
elbow, water supply, transport, housing schools? All these<br />
things represent the great public works programme of the State<br />
and of the Commonwealth. </p>
<p>The two things are completely complementary. And I beg<br />
of you to put out of your mind this idea that there is some<br />
conflict between them. Because I believe that you must add the<br />
two of them together to find out how the country goes on.<br />
On top of all that we have as our constant polloy the<br />
expansion and the diversification of our exports; and I will say<br />
a word to you about this. Unless wo can export more, unless we<br />
can find new markets in the world, unless we can add to the export<br />
of wool and meat and wheat, the export of the products of our<br />
factories, then we :-re going to have trouble about our balances of<br />
payments, probably for the rest of my life. Not constant but<br />
fluctuating sometimes better, sometimes worse.<br />
I said somcthing about this today to an audience of<br />
business men. It is vital that we should all bond our energies to<br />
developing exports from this country, because the plain truth is<br />
that every now and then and this year is one of them we find<br />
ourselves spending more money overseas than we are earning. And<br />
therefore we are drawing on our accumulated capital overseas to<br />
pay our current debts. That is bad business, and the Liberal<br />
Party stands not for bad business, but for good sounmd national<br />
business. Therefore if w~ e are to solve thiis problem in the long<br />
run we must earn more.<br />
Those many of you who remember the events of the<br />
will agree with me that we took thte whole shock of the world<br />
depression flat in the face because our principal means and<br />
almost our only means of survival lay in the products el the<br />
farms and pastures of the country. When wool went down to what<br />
was it? 6d. or 7d. a lb., some fantastic pric3; and when wheat<br />
was down to 1/ 9d. a bushel just think of it of course we were<br />
almost defenceless against this blow. We had to shorten sail;<br />
we had to cut everybody down; we had to reduce pensions in<br />
Australia; and reduce pay; and ride the storm out. As a<br />
nation Australia learned something from thiat, and we developed<br />
more and more our manufactures.<br />
When I first used to discuss this State with Sir Thomas<br />
Playford, which was very early in my history but quite late in<br />
his, because he has been Premier for a long, long timae ( Applause)<br />
I remember saying to him, " If South Australia is ever to cease to<br />
be a ' claimant' State we must do something to develop its economic<br />
balance". In other words we raust get secondary industries into<br />
it. Under my own first Government we put munitions establishmients<br />
into this State which were thie nucleus -around which one of the<br />
most remarkable industrial developments in Australia has<br />
developed. The result is that South Australia is not a ' claimant'<br />
State any longer; it is a balanced community.<br />
That is a mere microcosm of the fact that in Australia<br />
we have become a balanced cormmunity. W'e are now a highly<br />
industrialised nation. Wie still get a shock when thea price of<br />
wool falls, of course. But it is not so fatal ' a shock as it<br />
would be if we did not have all this vast area of industrial<br />
employment and activity to fall back on. If we are going to<br />
maintain that position we must take every conceivable step, not<br />
only to increase our markets for the normal things that we grow,<br />
but to create great new markets for those things that we<br />
manufacture in our factories; things that we can make with no<br />
less skill than the people of the United States or the people of<br />
the United Kingdom.<br />
Now, internally, those represent, broadly, our constant<br />
policies. I would not mind being cross-examined about them<br />
before the Bar of history, because I th[, ink that over thiis decade<br />
we ca-n demonstrate a remarkable degree of success in the<br />
carrying out of those policies. </p>
<p>But there is also the problem abroad. Just let me say<br />
a few words about it. What is our policy, our Liberal policy<br />
in relation to the world? Well, first of all it is a policy of<br />
the maintenance and cultivation of friendship. That sounds very<br />
simple, doesn't it? The maintenance and cultivation of<br />
friendship in aid of peace and in aid of our own national<br />
security. It is very easy to quarrel with othor nations. When<br />
we came back into office at the ond of ). 949 Australia had<br />
succeeded in having some quarrels with the United States of<br />
America and with the United Kingdom. We.-have resolved all<br />
those things. The fact is that this country enjoys a quality of<br />
friendship with the United States, with all the countries of the<br />
Commonwealth, never previously surpassed in our history. We<br />
believe that we must, as a nation, jointly with other people,<br />
resist aggressive communism whother it is European or Asian.<br />
Well we haven't just talked about it. Ve have made a<br />
powerful contribution to the strcangthoning of Commonwealth<br />
relations, British Commocnwealth relations. We ours-elves were<br />
the creators of the Colorabo Plan which has brought enormous help<br />
and satisfaction to many Asian countries. We were I think I<br />
should say, properly, the chief proponents of the tINZUS Pact<br />
with the United States and with Now Zealand. Wo are a foundation<br />
member and an active member of the South East Asia Treaty<br />
Organisation. When somebody says to y,. u " Have you a policy on<br />
foreign affairs?" pray, remind themi Lat these things have been<br />
done by us not one of them had been dreamed of before,<br />
Of course if you are to live in t'ie world with<br />
satisfaction, with honour, with credit in an economic sense then<br />
you must not only add to your exports as and when you can, but<br />
you must restrain inflation at home. Nobody wants to invest<br />
his mioney in an economy which is falling away. You must?<br />
therefore, maintain conditions which will attract imports of<br />
productive capital.<br />
Now don't think that this is a dry matter, please.<br />
Whatever may have been said about previous Labour Governments,<br />
the present Labour Opposition at Canberra is violently opposed<br />
to the investment of foreign capital in Australia. It loses no<br />
opportunity of complaining about it. And when I say " foreign<br />
capital" I m. ean for this purpose not my words capital from<br />
the United Kingdom which represents, so far, the bulk of these<br />
investments, and capital from the United States of America.<br />
Now this is worth thinking about. I undertake to say that<br />
there are a few " crocodile" tears being shed in Labour circles<br />
today about people who are being paid off unhappily, from<br />
certain car manufacturing industries. Bu I remind you that ffthu<br />
Labour view about not importing capital from overseas had<br />
prevailed, the factories would not be there in most case8 and<br />
there wouldn't be any people employed to be paid off. It is<br />
just as well to remem~ ber that. They are against it.<br />
I rem,. ember with some satisfaction that about six or<br />
seven years ago it was possible to stand on a platform in<br />
Adelaide or in Melbourne or somewhere else and say that our<br />
stability, our policies, our repute, our credit, were such that<br />
about : COO million a year was being invested in Australia for<br />
productive enterprises by private people not by Governmaent<br />
and that this maeant everything to us in employment and in<br />
growth. Last year it was over Å C200 million. I wonder what<br />
would happen to us if a Goverrnmeint camo in which did not enjoy<br />
this credit and repute abroad. It is worth thinking about. </p>
<p>Indeed while I ani on that topic it nighIt not be a bad<br />
idea if I suggested to you that occasionally the onlooker sees<br />
a good deal of the gane. We are pretty close to it. If we have<br />
look at Governmient policy as private citizens we naturally tend<br />
to look at it as it affects us at this myom~ ent. And that is<br />
hum~ an nature; that is inevitable. Governm~ ents have to accept<br />
that as a fact, but not to be unduly swayed by it because they<br />
have a general responsib) ility to the whole nation.<br />
But people outside, looking at us, occasionally see<br />
sonething and say something worth recording. Now in the city<br />
of New York I am going to weary you with one passage there<br />
is a very great financial body knowrn as the Enpire Trust<br />
Company. Many business non hero will be quite familiar with<br />
its name. And the D7pire Trust Company publishes, periodically,<br />
a circular which goes around the city of New York and into all<br />
the great financial hcjuses. A number of ny friends in New<br />
York who are by no neans small mon in the financial world<br />
hastened to send no a print of this last circular published in<br />
January. Could I road you a little bit? It is a first class<br />
sui-nary of what our policy has been in the financial world,<br />
It says " Because of the swiftly rising level of business<br />
activity which began in 1959 the Coomronwoolth authorities"<br />
that is the Australian Coiamonwedth-<br />
" undertook a mu~ lti-pronged attack on inflation ( You will<br />
renenber these measures) relaxa~ tion of inport restrictions,<br />
intervention in the February, 1960 Basic Wage hearing which<br />
resulted in the refusal of the Airbitration Commission to<br />
grant increases, and tightened credit by the Reserve Bank.<br />
This programme was supplemented by provision for a small cash<br />
surplus in the 1960/ 61 Budget wherein Commonwealth taxes<br />
were raised a total of Q37 millions, a major contribution to<br />
which was a rise in the corporation tax rate from 37e, to<br />
Despite these moves the Australian economy continued<br />
to expand so vigorously in 1960 that further anti-inflationary<br />
measures were found necessary. The Commonwealth Treasurer"<br />
that is my much abused colleague, Harold Holt, who, after all,<br />
speaks for all of us<br />
" announced on November 15th last new and particularly<br />
courageoussteps"<br />
just think of it: this is what they say in New York-<br />
" which in the main consist of the following: still tighter<br />
Bank credit restrictions, with particular emphasis on<br />
curbing loans for speculative purposes, the limitation of<br />
interest deductions for income tax up to the amount claimed<br />
last year, interest on new issues of convertible notes will<br />
not be deductible for income tax purposes, the maximum bank<br />
lending rate raised from 6 to and the Sales Tax on motor<br />
vehicles from 30 to<br />
Then they go on<br />
" Recent indications suggest that the financial spiral in<br />
Australia has begyun to abate, paving the way for continued<br />
strong growth under somewhat steadier conditions. The<br />
vigour and despatch with which the Australian authorities<br />
attacked the problem has not gone unnoticed in ovorsoas<br />
financial centres". ( Applause) </p>
<p>Now, Sir, I read that passage to you with a certain<br />
satisfaction. In all these policies I think we have had a<br />
considerable success. And interestingly enough the poople of<br />
Australia have thought so. They thought so in 149and in ' 51,<br />
and in 154' and in ' 55 and in ' 58. In fact they thought so<br />
more in ' 56 than they did in 14+ 9 bocause we had a record<br />
majt. lie have had all these rises in development, 7 in<br />
overseas investment. The growth in production which is, of<br />
course, of primary importance in Australia has been phenomenal.<br />
I haven't tine to give you a lot of examples of this but I<br />
suppose there will be some of you, at least, who will remember<br />
that back twelve years ago we were greatly troubled about coal<br />
we weren't getting production. In m.-any industrial centres they<br />
had blackouts, power was cut off. We udero told that of course<br />
' you couldn't do any good in the coal world because theo coal<br />
miner was a difficult fellow'. The production of black coal<br />
during the time of my Government has risen, in actual terms,<br />
from 14+ million tons a year to 21 million tons a year. The<br />
production of steel in Australia and the production of power has<br />
gone up almost thrkue times in the course of this period. Of<br />
course we didn't do all this with our own fair hands. But we<br />
set out to do our best to create an atmosphere of freedom, and<br />
of growth, and of enterprise in Australia which would bring<br />
these things about. And they have happened.<br />
Now, Sir, I turn away from that to put one question to<br />
you. I think that if the people of Australia had been asked<br />
twelve months ago let us go back twelve m~ onths to the time<br />
when I couldn't walk down the street without people saying ' Good<br />
on you' whether they could have done as well in A" ustralia-I<br />
an talking now of Coraonwealth matters under the Evatts<br />
Calwells, W-ards, Cairnses, they would have said MNoll Well what<br />
has happened? Do they now believe that in the last few months,<br />
after years of what I venture to describe as succossfuliganity,<br />
we have suddenly gone mad?<br />
Don't take your view from a few extravagantly critical<br />
publications because they have said all these things before<br />
today; and we have happened to survive them., Just look at the<br />
facts and work the facts out for yourself.<br />
Now what happened after the policy that we announced<br />
at the beginning of 1960? What happened after that as it was<br />
described " four-pronged" policy of February of last year which<br />
I venture to say had the warm approval of sensible people all<br />
over Australia. Well things did not come out exactly as we<br />
expected themi, or hoped them to do. In the first place the<br />
price of wool fell away still further. Now that is a major<br />
element in our economy. In the second place bank advances which<br />
were expected to increase by the merest small fraction increased<br />
between then and November by about Å-150 million. I don't say<br />
that critically of the Banks; but they increased because of this<br />
enormious demand for imiports proceeding from an almost record<br />
possession of purchasing power in the home corriunity a<br />
purchasing power which, not being satisfied by internal<br />
production, reached out and sought for im~ ports, The result was<br />
that by last November our reserves overseas were running down<br />
and runnini down at a very fast rate. Bank advancus were up;<br />
bank liquidity, looking to the futuro, found itself with a<br />
problem in front of it. WUhat were we to do? We had announced<br />
that we would budget for a surplus; we did. We did all these<br />
other things that have been referred to about the Basic Wage<br />
enquiry. But in spite of all those things up went bank<br />
advances; and there was an enormous increase in expenditure.<br />
An analysis of-it showed that there were certain fields in which </p>
<p>that process bad roached its culminating point.<br />
Now I an a great boliever in the motor car industry in<br />
Australia and so are yoiu, in South. Australia. And well you<br />
night be. It has been a great and valuable industry to<br />
Australia. But if you are having an inflationary boon in your<br />
owm country you just can't turn your eyes away from the places<br />
that are helping to produce the boom, places where some<br />
restraint, for a time, may be necessary.<br />
By October of last year registration of new cars, new<br />
rioter vehicles rather, in Australia, had reached the level<br />
mest of you won't believe it of 1,000 per working day! I can<br />
go back to a tine when there were no motor cars manufactured in<br />
Australia. There were some riotor bodies, built here, and some in<br />
Melbourne but there were no motor cars built. We were told you<br />
could. not have a m~ otor manufacturing industry in Australia,<br />
because the volume of demand would not be great enough. And here<br />
we were with a thousand cars a day coning on to the registry.<br />
Our imports into Australia and it is imports that<br />
eat up our overseas balances which the previous year had been<br />
Å C150 million had risen to Å-200 rmillion at a time at which our<br />
wool cheque had fallen by rathor a greater amount than that.<br />
You see these are the sort of facts that have to be<br />
looked at by a Government. You do not want a Liberal<br />
Government to look facts in the eye and then run away from them.<br />
Therefore we concluded that if we were going to restrain this<br />
inflationary pressure which pushes up the price level, which<br />
does injustice to people on fixed incomes, then we must look at<br />
what the sources of the pressure were and do something about the.<br />
Take another instance the demand for capital. You<br />
know ladies and gentlemen there is one odd thing about public<br />
works you have to pay for them! These wretched fellows who<br />
are contractors on big works, they like being paid; and they<br />
like being paid in hard cash. Therefore you must get the hard<br />
cash. Now in the good old days a Loan Council net, it decided<br />
to borrow Å 20 or Å F30 million, whatever it might, and it borrowed<br />
it. The Commonwealth got a little share of it in those days;<br />
and the rest went round.<br />
Since I cane back into office we have had no share, as<br />
a Com~ onwealth, in the loan market. Nor can the loan market<br />
find all the money that is needed for public works. The fact is<br />
that we have had to carry not because we like it, but because<br />
we thought it had to be done a substantial percentage of the<br />
cost of public works on the Commonwealth budget. That doesn't<br />
make us very popular, you know. Over the last nine years 1+ 01<br />
of State works programmeis have been financed from the Commonwealth<br />
Budget. If you add our own works programe 601, of all<br />
the Government I mean Corimnonwalh and State works in<br />
Australia have been found, in terms of cash, out of the<br />
Commf~ onweal th Budget. I don't omuplain about it. I think it was<br />
right. I think that without that, this country could not have<br />
developed. But I want to remind you that if we had decided to<br />
be a little stiff, a little academic on these matters and had<br />
said, " No, we are not going to spend revenue on works; we'll<br />
just confine ourselves to the loan money that the p) eople will let<br />
us have", we could have reduced taxation of course; we could<br />
have been incredibly popular, of course; and AuMstralia would<br />
have stood stock still for the last ton years.<br />
I think that there is just one further aspect of that<br />
matter that I might refer to. That is that one of the reasons<br />
why Commonwealth loans, which we raise on behalf of the States<br />
and ourselves under the Financial Agreement have not been able </p>
<p>to absorb as much m.-oney as we needed has been the competition in<br />
Aiustr-ali-a-between -Government borrowings and private borrowings<br />
at fancy-rates of interest you are familiar with it. Open a<br />
newspaper any day and you will m. arvel to see how many people are<br />
yearning to collect your money at ten per cent or nine per cent<br />
or eight per cent interest for three months, 7 or six months, or<br />
twelve months or two years. This is , ood; that is what they<br />
call mney for jam~. But you only have to have enough scores of<br />
millions, or hundreds of millions, finding their way into that<br />
kind of investment, to find that the Government Loan Account is<br />
getting dry. And if the Government Loan Account is getting dry,<br />
then you must knock off the works, which nobody proposes to do<br />
because that is knocking off national growth, or you must getth<br />
money in the first instance out of the taxpayer's pocket.<br />
Therefore, on this occasion -I have no doubt to the<br />
great dissatisfaction of some people we have done something<br />
about the fancy rates of interest. We have provided in a<br />
temporary measure, that it is no longer going to be taken that if<br />
you pay 10j% on a short term borrowing, you are going to be<br />
allowed the whole 10% as an income tax deduction that lovely<br />
day has to come to an end.<br />
And we asked ourselves " Can we any longer accept the<br />
proposition that an enterprise can raise money by what it is<br />
pleased to call " convertible notes" which are really another<br />
form of capital " and deduct, before income tax is calculated,<br />
the whole cost of the interest on the convertible notes?". These<br />
are technical matters. But business men in this audience tinight<br />
will understand, and I am sure that they will agree, that no<br />
Government seeking to correct this imbalance between public works<br />
and public enterprise the essential of national development<br />
could stand by and allow these other factors to stand in the way<br />
of serving the interests of the public, and of protecting the<br />
position of the taxpayer. '-do are all taxpayers, and what the<br />
other man dodges, we pay. That is worth thinking about.<br />
Novi, Sir, I know that what I have said to you is, in<br />
many cases, dry, no doubt. What I have really been trying to say<br />
to you is: When you look at all these things, think first of<br />
what our ;-reat national policies are. As Liberals, be proud of<br />
those policies and be proud of what they have done for Australia.<br />
When you look at the application of these policies, I hope that<br />
you will always have in mind that you expect from Liberal<br />
leaders in politics, intelligence, flexibility of mind a<br />
willingness to do unpopular things occasionally, a pref'erence in<br />
their own minds, as I have in mine, for the respect of the<br />
people rather than for easy applause and popularity. I venture<br />
to say that when it is well understood what oes on, that when<br />
the result of this medicine begins to appear, and people realise<br />
that the balances of payments are improving, that the run-down is<br />
coming to an end, that we are getting back once more into a state<br />
of stability. they may still retrospectively have a few harsh<br />
things to say about harsh things that were done to them but thor<br />
will respect the Government. And no Government that is respected<br />
is beaten. Therefore I say to you all Thank you very much. It is<br />
a marvellous thing to see so many of you; it is a wonderful<br />
thing for people like myself, looking at these matters constantly,<br />
anxiously, day by day, to know that there are thousands of people<br />
outside who, though occasionally they are mystified by what you<br />
do, have deep down in them the belief that our political faith<br />
of Liberalism is one of utter integrity and honesty, and of<br />
imagination. And that those who lead us are fit to be trusted by<br />
us with the carrying out of this naL~ nificent adventure in the<br />
growth of A1ustralia. ( Applauso) </p>
