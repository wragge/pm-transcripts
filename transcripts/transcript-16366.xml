    <content><![CDATA[<p>As we celebrate Australia Day with our friends and families - over barbeques, picnic tables and beach towels - I know that many of you share my concerns about the impact of the global financial crisis on our families.</p>
<p>This year will not be an easy one, and to be frank, we face some very big challenges.</p>
<p>But I am confident that, if we all pull together, we can come through this together - and come out even stronger and emerge from this crisis even more resilient than before.</p>
<p>Australia is better placed then almost every other nation to deal with the global financial crisis, but it's going to be tough.</p>
<p>Our history as a nation is one of resilience - to confront obstacles and see a way through, to emerge stronger and more determined.</p>
<p>From the struggle of Indigenous Australians for recognition and respect;</p>
<p>From the courage of our diggers in Gallipoli, </p>
<p>on the Western Front, at Kokoda, </p>
<p>in Timor Leste and </p>
<p>in Afghanistan;</p>
<p>From the determination of miners on the goldfields, of women for the right to vote and of workers for a fair go at work.</p>
<p>This is not an ordinary nation... This is an extraordinary nation.</p>
<p>Resilient, courageous, and purposeful, without sacrificing compassion.</p>
<p>In 2009 we will be calling on all those great Australian qualities because we are all in this together.</p>
<p>The Government stands ready to do whatever is necessary to support the stability of our financial institutions at a time when others around the world are under threat; to support the economy during a global economic recession; and to create new jobs through government investment as other jobs in the private sector come under pressure</p>
<p>Our shared history as Australians shows that together, we can meet the challenges the world might throw at us in 2009.</p>
<p>I wish you a very happy Australia Day.</p>
