    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Acting Premier of  Tasmania Jeremy Rockliff today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to  deliver Tasmania’s first City Deal for Launceston. </p>
<p>
  The  Launceston City Deal will establish shared goals for Launceston and northern  Tasmania, to revitalise the region’s economy.</p>
<p>
  Tasmania’s  first City Deal will centre around Commonwealth and State investment in a new  University of Tasmania Campus at Inveresk, and rejuvenation of the Launceston  CBD.</p>
<p>
  During the  20th century, Launceston built its reputation and economy around being an  industrial city.  The City Deal will help Launceston open the door to  industries of the 21st century in areas like advanced manufacturing,  agriculture, health services, tourism and education.</p>
<p>
  The City  Deal builds on the Tasmanian Government’s announcement this week of a $100  million Northern Economic Stimulus package.</p>
<p>
  While the  MoU is an important milestone, delivery of City Deal projects is well  underway.  </p>
<p>
  The Prime  Minister on Thursday launched the new University College with University of  Tasmania Vice-Chancellor, Professor Peter Rathjen. The University College  will offer flexible courses, including associate degrees that are responsive to  local industries, providing graduates with a clear path to employment. </p>
<p>
  Prime Minister Turnbull also joined Acting Premier Rockliff  and City of Launceston Mayor, Albert van Zetten, to launch Stage One of the  City Heart Project. This will include upgrades to Civic Square and the Brisbane  Street Mall, creating a vibrant hub to attract people into Launceston’s  centre.  </p>
<p>
  Full NBN Wi-Fi coverage in the area will encourage students,  businesses and the community to make better use of the public space. </p>
<p>
  Building on community consultation and a Commonwealth  commitment of $7.5 million, the City of Launceston is working to deliver the  project over the next three years.</p>
<p>
  Engagement  is well underway between the Commonwealth, Tasmanian Government and the City of  Launceston to implement the Launceston City Deal. </p>
<p>
  City Deals  are a new approach to developing outcomes driven policy and investment for  individual cities across all tiers of government, the private sector and  community. They will address local challenges and maximise local advantages.</p>
<p>
  The MoU  signed today provides a framework to proceed with negotiations and toward  future city deals for Tasmania.  </p>
