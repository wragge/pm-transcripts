S ON<br />
REFERENDUM PROPOSALS<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
From the " Parliamentary Debates," 23 February 1967]<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT ( Higgins-Prime<br />
Minister)-by leave-Mr Speaker, Cabinet<br />
has given further consideration, as I outlined<br />
in answer to a question put to me by<br />
the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam),<br />
to the matter of holding a referendum on<br />
the two items which were the subject of<br />
legislation by both Houses of Parliament<br />
towards the end of 1965. It has decided to<br />
proceed in relation to both of these matters.<br />
The major purpose'of the first proposal was<br />
to remove the requirement in the Constitution<br />
that any increase in the number of<br />
members in the House of Representatives<br />
would automatically produce an increase in<br />
the number of senators to the extent of half<br />
the increase in the number of members of<br />
the House of Representatives. The second<br />
proposal, in the form in which it was previously<br />
passed, was designed to remove the<br />
provision which prevents Aboriginal natives<br />
from being counted when the population is<br />
reckoned. This is one of two provisions in<br />
the . Constitution in which Aboriginal or<br />
people of the Aboriginal race are mentioned<br />
explicitly. They are to be found in section<br />
51 ( xxvi). and section 127. Section 51<br />
provides: 2888/ 67 The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution,<br />
' have power to make laws for the peace,<br />
order, and good government of the Commonwealth<br />
with respect to:<br />
( xxvi.) The people of any race, other than the<br />
Aboriginal race in any State, for whom it is deemed<br />
necessary, to make special laws:<br />
The Government has decided to propose<br />
that the words ' other than the Aboriginal<br />
race' in any State' be omitted from the<br />
section. While the original intention in<br />
inserting these words was to safeguard the<br />
position of people of the Aboriginal race<br />
they have been widely misinterpreted and<br />
there. is a general impression that they are<br />
discriminatory. When amending proposals were previously<br />
before the Parliament, that relating<br />
to Aboriginals was adopted unanimously in<br />
both Houses, and the proposal to break the<br />
nexus between the House of Representatives<br />
and the Senate was adopted unanimously in<br />
the House of Representatives and by a very<br />
substantial majority . in the Senate. Indeed<br />
on the second reading of the Bill in that<br />
chamber there were forty-four ayes against </p>
<p>seven noes. On the third reading there were<br />
forty-three ayes to eight noes.<br />
For reasons which I publicly indicated on<br />
February 1966, and later repeated in<br />
my first policy statement to the House of<br />
Representatives on 8th March 1966, the<br />
Government decided to defer until the commencement<br />
of this Parliament the consideration<br />
of the taking of a referendum in<br />
relation to these matters. I said then:<br />
we intend, early in the life of the next<br />
Parliament, to introduce the necessary legislation<br />
to enable a referendum to be held on the proposal<br />
to break the nexus between the two Houses of<br />
Parliament. We will also then give a general indication<br />
of our intentions in relation to the distribution<br />
proposals which would be made should the referendum<br />
prove successful. We intend, at the same time,<br />
to present also the proposal relating to Aborigines.<br />
This proposal has been supported by all political<br />
parties, and there was indeed no negative case<br />
prepared for circulation to the eledtors.<br />
I now give the general indication then<br />
promised of our intention in relation to<br />
redistribution proposals. Need for this is<br />
long overdue as I am sure all honourable<br />
members will agree. Some metropolitan<br />
electorates, for example, in the same State,<br />
have fewer than 40,000 yoters while others<br />
have in excess of 100,000. By the time of<br />
the next election,' assuming the Parliament<br />
will run its full course, the disparity will<br />
have widened. Should the referendum in<br />
relation to abolition of the nexus between<br />
the two Houses prove successful the Government<br />
would propose to increase the size of<br />
the House of Representatives so as to provide<br />
one member for iot fewer than 85,000<br />
persons. It is worth mentioning here, I<br />
think, that if . a . pecific provision relating<br />
to 85,000' persons" were made it would be<br />
the first occasion when such a specification<br />
had been included in the Commonwealth<br />
Constitution. This, we anticipate, would<br />
require an increase of about thirteen in the<br />
size of the House of Representatives.<br />
Unless the nexus is removed an increase<br />
in the House' of Representatives must be<br />
accompanied by an increase of as nearly as<br />
practicable half that number in the Senate.<br />
If the present voting system were to. be<br />
maintained ' this could be performed effectively<br />
only by increasing the Senate by<br />
twenty-four, thus involving a total increase<br />
in the House of Representatives'of fortyeight.<br />
In other words, to secure what would be intended as a modest increase in the<br />
House of Representatives we would be<br />
driven-I repeat, assuming that we maintain<br />
the present system of voting for the<br />
Senate-to a total increase of seventy-two<br />
parliamentarians. The purpose of the nexus<br />
proposal is as I have mentioned. It has<br />
been suggested -that our object is to permit<br />
an excessive increase in the number of members<br />
of Parliament. This was one of the<br />
grounds of criticism which we heard at the<br />
time of the earlier legislation. This, of<br />
course, is not so. Our proposal is, I repeat,<br />
to ask the electors for approval to change<br />
the Constitution so that as the growth of the<br />
population requires we can legislate in this<br />
" arliament for modest increases in the size<br />
of the popular House. It is true that the<br />
present Constitution would permit small increases<br />
in the size of this House, but they<br />
would have to be accompanied by directly<br />
proportionate increases in the size of the<br />
Senate. Our proposals, if carried, are<br />
designed to allow the smallest increase that<br />
we consider to be consistent with effective<br />
representation without the necessity to make<br />
adjustments in the size of the Senate.<br />
There is no question of eroding the<br />
proper role of the Senate by the. proposal<br />
to.. break . the nexus,. nor. indeed of precluding<br />
future, increases in the size of the<br />
Senate. . I think. that questions of this sort,<br />
with the restraints removed, could safely be<br />
left to the i good sense of representative<br />
members of the Parliament in both Houses,<br />
themselves responsive to the wish of. the<br />
. electorate, as. they interpret it at the time.<br />
Under the existing constitutional provisions,<br />
it is not: possible to secure changes in the<br />
numbers of the House of Representatives<br />
without running into serious difficulties in<br />
effecting the proportionate changes in the<br />
size of the Senate. We believe that the Government<br />
and the Parliament should have<br />
flekilblity to secure such changes in the size<br />
of this House as we deem desirable as our<br />
population grows. However, we believe that<br />
the Senate as at present constituted is well<br />
able to discharge, and ' discharge effectively,<br />
the role designed for it by, the Constitution.<br />
We are well aware that some fears are held<br />
that the prestige and authority of the<br />
Senate may. in some manner be diminished<br />
as a conseqdence ' of this proposal and that<br />
its role as a house of review and custodian<br />
of the rights of the smaller States weakened.<br />
We do not accept these views as having </p>
<p>practical force. The Senate of the United<br />
States provides an example of how a chamnber<br />
much smaller in numbers than the<br />
popular House may develop great authority<br />
and prestige. In modern times, most senators-<br />
in my experience this has invariably<br />
been the practice of those from the Australian<br />
Labor Party-have followed in the<br />
Senate the policies adopted by the majority<br />
in their party room discussions.<br />
The Government, I may say, has considered<br />
other suggestions that have been<br />
brought forward to effect an increase in<br />
-the size of the House of Representatives<br />
and at the same time enable an increase<br />
in the size of the Senate, but without<br />
having the considerable jump in numbers<br />
that would follow if we maintained the<br />
present system of voting. We have looked<br />
in particular at a proposal that the Senate<br />
be increased by a total of six, with one<br />
additional senator for each State. This<br />
would mean that at alternate elections there<br />
would be six senators voted for on one<br />
occasion and five on the other. It might be<br />
necessary to have six senators elected in<br />
some States and five in others at the same<br />
election. The possibility of a deadlocked<br />
Senate would be considerably increased and<br />
there are other factors which, in the view<br />
of the Government, make this a less desirable<br />
course than the more simple and clear<br />
cut proposition to increase the House of<br />
Representatives to the required extent without<br />
the requirement of a corresponding increase<br />
in the Senate.<br />
We did consider whether other referendum<br />
proposals should be added to the two<br />
that had previously been considered by the<br />
Parliament. However, except in the one<br />
respect I have mentioned in relation to Aboriginals,<br />
we have come to the conclusion<br />
that we ought not to complicate the issues<br />
to be put to the people by introducing additional<br />
proposals but should confine OUrselves<br />
to the two issues previously considered<br />
by the Parliament. These, as I have<br />
mentioned, were matters which received the<br />
unanimous support of this House and, as<br />
to one, unanimity in the Senate, and, as<br />
to the other, the very large majority that<br />
I have detailed. The Government feels that,<br />
with an understanding of its intentions and<br />
recognition of the necessity to provide adequate parliamentary representation for a<br />
rapidly growing population, there will be<br />
the necessary electoral support for the<br />
desired constitutional change. There should<br />
also be wide approval for the removal of<br />
provisions generally deemed, even if mistakenly,<br />
in some way to discriminate unfavourably<br />
against Aboriginals and persons<br />
of the Aboriginal race.<br />
Our intention, Mr Speaker, is to put<br />
through the necessary legislation relating to<br />
these proposals as soon as practicable. I<br />
expect it to be introduced in this House<br />
within the next week or two. We propose to<br />
have the measures passed by the two Houses<br />
as expeditiously as possible. Whatever may<br />
be the fate of the referendum we are<br />
resolved that there shall be a redistribution<br />
of electoral boundaries during the life of<br />
this Parliament. Clearly it would be unsatisfactory<br />
to continue indefinitely a situation<br />
in which metropolitan electorates in particular<br />
exhibit such wide disparity of numbers<br />
of voters and in which there is great<br />
need for a more balanced and more equitable<br />
distribution of boundaries between the<br />
electorates of the Commonwealth as a whole.<br />
The expedition proposed for the passage of<br />
the legislation and the submission of the<br />
proposals to the people by way of referendum<br />
is dictated in large part by our<br />
knowledge that the carrying through of a<br />
redistribution for all the electorates throughout<br />
Australia will take considerable time. We<br />
must have these initial procedures completed<br />
well before the next general election, which<br />
we hiope will occur in three years from<br />
now. Wi Bryant-Mr Speaker, I -ask for leave<br />
to make a statement.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Is leave granted?<br />
Mr Harold Holt-I asked the Leader of<br />
the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) whether he<br />
wished to make a statement. He considered<br />
that as the legislation would be introduced<br />
shortly that would not be necessary. If one<br />
honourable member is given leave to make a<br />
statement, doubtless others will want to join<br />
in. There will be an early opportunity to<br />
debate the matter when the relevant legislation<br />
is before us soon.<br />
Leave not granted.<br />
