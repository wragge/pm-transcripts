PM: tr Wel the pcpalreanit ofraling as just makdeen onettpoint clear<br />
the indigenous Australians.<br />
This is an historic piece of legislation. The like of it has not been seen in this<br />
country. It had an inordinate amount of coordination and consultation.. The<br />
Government has released draft legislation, it released the discussion paper,<br />
and then draft legislation. It has had discussions with every imaginable<br />
group, and there is simply no reason why these sort of tactics ought to be<br />
employed by the Coalition in the Senate.<br />
I will just remind you that for the first three weeks of the Senate sittings,<br />
nearly all of the three weeks were devoted to procedural questions in the<br />
Senate. There was only five hours work spent on Government legislation.<br />
And now we have had, from Friday, the Second Reading Debate, then Friday<br />
to midnight, 7 hours, Saturday from 9 am to midnight, 12 and a half hours,<br />
today about 5-6 hours already. And the Coalition spent nearly 2 and a half<br />
hours this morning with another attempt to stop the Bill by sending it to a<br />
committee. Now, the fact is, the Opposition decided to vote against the Bill, and they<br />
have got a tag team in, asking questions taking up time, that are simply sitting<br />
in the explanatory memorandum, that are sitting in the discussion paper, the<br />
draft legislation, the explanatory memorandum for any person to read.<br />
Now, the fact of the matter is that the Coalition today, and the States, have<br />
just put out a statement saying, " the passage of the federal Mabo legislation<br />
through parliament has become totally confused". 20. Dec. 93 16: 44 No 010 p ni/ nA </p>
<p>TEL: 2<br />
There is nothing confused about It. We on this side of the parliament are<br />
totally clear about the legislation, because we have spent a year putting it<br />
together. And everybody dealing with It understands that.<br />
" The Government is trying to railroad through theSenate hundreds of last<br />
minute amendments." This is in the over 24 hours of debate it has had, with<br />
a discussion paper released nearly six full months ago, a draft legislation.<br />
" Railroad"; " this is a completely unacceptable way," they say. Having failed<br />
to try and put it off to a committee, tried again today, and now with a tag team<br />
of filibusterers going around asking these obvious questions, they're now<br />
saying the legislation should be delayed.<br />
For the word delayed, read destroyed. Because what John Hewson wants to<br />
do Is destroy the Bill and that is why, he knows the Bill is a principled piece of<br />
legislation, why does he want to destroy it and delay it? Because of the<br />
Western Australian Liberal support for his leadership. In fact, the Liberal<br />
Party leadership is now being played out around responses to the Mabo Bill.<br />
And when there was some discussion in the shadow executive the other day<br />
of supporting the legislation and putting in the amendments business needed,<br />
John Howard waved at John Hewson the transcript of his, John Hewson's,<br />
earlier inflexible remarks about the Bill and the debate was put to one side.<br />
Now, let me just say a couple of things about what the Coalition did on<br />
Saturday night. The Coalition on Saturday night voted down mining industry<br />
and pastoral industry amendments. They voted with the Democrats and the<br />
Greens. The Liberal Party and the National Party voted with the Democrats<br />
and the Greens to vote the amendments down. These are the amendments<br />
which were needed, that had been suggested by the National Farmers<br />
Federation and the mining industry, and had the temerity to say, today, and I<br />
see it reported broadly in the press today, that in some way this was the<br />
Governments responsibility. The Government said it would introduce these<br />
amendments, clause 24, it did exactly what it said. It did exactly what it said<br />
and introduced them and they voted them down.<br />
Now, I noticed today in the Sydney Morning Herald in an editorial, and a good<br />
one, says that instead of a sense of historical moment the debate on the Bill<br />
in the Senate has elicited mean spirited opportunism and truculent<br />
inflexibility. Hear, hear to that. And it said, the Native Title Bill is not a<br />
perfect piece of legislation, but in terms of its fairness and its ability to end<br />
the current uncertainty over land titles, it is about as good as they come. And<br />
consider the time, energy and consultation that has gone into its drafting, and<br />
it goes on, compared to that how likely is last minute tinkering to improve the<br />
Bill in any substantive way.<br />
So, let me say, that some people in the Coalition were more intent in nailing<br />
Ric Farley in the National Farmers Federation because he brought some<br />
good will and consensus to the Bill on the Bills merits. As a leaders of an<br />
industry group he negotiated with the Government, got the things his industry<br />
T2EL0: . Dec. 93 16: 44 No. 010 P. 02/ 06 </p>
<p>TEL 3<br />
needed, was part of the consensus, displayed goodwill on the basis of merit,<br />
and they are about trying to defeat the amendment he was associated with<br />
last Saturday night, so they could say that he was party to putting the<br />
consensus on the Bill together. And the Liberals are around today telling<br />
Industry they are confident they can push the Bill to the end of next week, so<br />
that the Bill either fails or isn't voted upon. I mean, this is the wonderful John<br />
Hewson's high principals. I mean, god help this sort of political morality.<br />
Now, let me assure Dr Hewson, that no filibustering will prevent us dealing<br />
with the Bill. If we have to sit here till Christmas Eve, and come back on<br />
boxing day and keep going, we will. Because we are going to see the Senate<br />
vote upon this Bill. And let me just make this clear. Let me just quote again<br />
Mr Farley, this morning, he said, about the industry things, " what I said was I<br />
had been betrayed, I didn't say I had been betrayed by the Government'. So<br />
the betrayal Is really In terms of the breakdown of the processes of a<br />
negotiated outcome. Now, as for the Opposition, the Liberals and the<br />
Nationals, I find it astonishing that the Liberal Party would seat down with the<br />
Democrats and the Greens and vote down amendments for the legislation<br />
which was supported by industry.<br />
Now, this is where the Liberal Party is at the end of 1993. On a classic piece<br />
of legislation coming from a seminal high court decision, to give Aboriginal<br />
people the right to be heard on Native Title, and have it awarded to them, and<br />
leaving With the States complete authority over economic use of land, with all<br />
the checks and balanced In It they don't even have the decency to take a<br />
position to say, that even in industry or their constituency terms they would<br />
improve the Bill. They are quite happy to improve the IR Bill in their terms<br />
" improve" it, within their frame of reference " improve" it even though they<br />
are opposed in ideological terms to the Bill. On this Bill they won't even<br />
support their constituencies' amendments because of the bloody minded<br />
opposition to the Bill.<br />
What we have seen here is three weeks of a Senate wasting its time five<br />
hours on Government business only and now over 24 hours of debate, over<br />
24 hours, onMabo. After a discussion paper was released months ago, after<br />
draft legislation was released to all interest groups including the States and<br />
Industry, after all amendments have been taken on board, they say, the Bill is<br />
being dealt with in a completely unacceptable way and its being rail roaded<br />
through the Senate.<br />
I have never seen in the years I have been here the Coalition behave in such<br />
an unprincipled way standing up the Government's financial legislation with<br />
the Budget, even though the Government had a complete mandate to its<br />
policies, and on this, a matter which the Government said it would deal with in<br />
the election campaign, which has met the approval of all of the Industry<br />
groups, all of the interests including the Aboriginal community they now<br />
seek to try and destroy it by the effluxion time.<br />
I can assure you we will sit the Senate, we will be here until they all vote.<br />

J: Mr Keating, at the end of the day, whether that's next week, Boxing<br />
Day, end of January, when ever, isn't the real problem that there is<br />
some points of total disagreement between the Government and the<br />
Greens on essential elements of the package?<br />
PM: Not as I understand it, no.<br />
J: What about the issue of extinguishment on validation, I mean isn't that<br />
an essential thing?<br />
PM: I am not about to debate each paint with you. I am trying to make here<br />
a procedural point, a point about the procedures and the Liberal<br />
party's lack of principle and lack of decency on it. The Liberals<br />
downed amendments that the mining industry thought were important<br />
to it and the pastoral Industry believed were important to it. They were<br />
voted down. The Government kept its word, introduced the<br />
amendments and they were voted down by the Liberal and National<br />
parties.<br />
J: is it possible to reach agreement with the Greens on the essential<br />
elements of the Bill?<br />
PM: I have got every confidence the Bill will pass.<br />
J: Will you have a go at bringing those amendments up again for<br />
example, by re-introducing them into the House of Reps?<br />
PM: No.<br />
J: Why not?<br />
PM: Look, the Liberals knew what they were doing with the Bill. They had<br />
every chance to consider It. We are not going to delay it any further.<br />
J: Are you frightened of the Greens if you do it again?<br />
PM:-The fact of the matter is they had every opportunity, everyone knew<br />
the issues and, as you know, a couple of National Party Senators<br />
broke with them and voted with the Government, but it wasn't enough.<br />
We would have needed ten or something.<br />
( inaudible)<br />
PM: We will have a look at the words of it. We have reasonably, I think,<br />
looked at every amendment, we have introduced many amendments<br />
from various stake holders and interest groups here and Gareth Evans<br />
is dealing with each amendment.<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL:<br />
J: Prime Minister, does it concern you that as a result of the amendments<br />
being defeated on Saturday night it seems that now you have got the<br />
INFF as well as AMIC and all these Liberal state governments in a<br />
sense saying, the legislation is no longer acceptable to us.<br />
PM: Look, what's happening here is basically a political stand-off now.<br />
What's happened is the Liberals are rounding up the suspects and<br />
trying to drag them in to oppose the Bill. The Bill was never about<br />
valid leases. Valid leases that were valid, never any question of<br />
validity, the renewals of those leases was never a question -these<br />
things are only clarlfying amendments anyway.<br />
J: Prime Minister, the Chairman of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs<br />
Committee, Senator Barney Cooney, said when they reported that the<br />
Bill had to go through now because the level of public support for it<br />
was so fragile that it wouldn't sustain until February and it was a<br />
matter oflin fact beating the declining level of support In so many<br />
words, for the Bill is that your view?<br />
PM: I think what will happen is if you have an unprincipled polarisation on<br />
the part of the Liberal Party, a filibustering around debates, around<br />
obvious points for which information can be obtained In explanatory<br />
memoranda et cetera, any such debate will produce a certain<br />
polarisation. You could see this today in the statement which Liberal<br />
Premiers have been obliged to sign, you will see It in the rounding up<br />
of mining industry people and what have you. That can't be good for<br />
the debate. But that doesn't say the Bill isn't a good Bill, a highly<br />
principled Bill, an historic Bill that should be passed and that all<br />
Australians it is the Australian people who are being denied<br />
something here. Those Australians who in the past voted in 1967 for<br />
the referendum and had believed that we should have an equitable<br />
basis of dealing with our indigenous people they are the people who<br />
the Liberal party are tying to cheat of this legislation.<br />
J: What's wrong with leaving it until February why doesn't the Bill go<br />
through in February?<br />
PM: Well, you can see what's happening with this sort of thing now. Why<br />
should I suit Dr Hewson who has done not one principled thing in this<br />
everything which has been unprincipled.<br />
J: Dr Hewson is that Mr Keating, Mr Goss has expressed some<br />
reservations today about whether this thing is now workable and your<br />
suggestion that these other Premiers have been coerced into signing<br />
this document doesn't really stand up either does it?<br />
PM: I don't see Mr Goss' signature on the document.<br />
J: ( inaudible) T2E0L:. Dec. 93 16: 44 No. 010 P. 05/ 06 </p>
<p>TEL: 20. Dec. 93 16: 44 No. 010 P. 06/ 06<br />

PM: Yes, but I don't think that I didn't hear him on " AM" and I'm not sure<br />
exactly whiat he said, that is Wayne Goss. But let me assure him that<br />
the Government in a completely principled way agreed to put these<br />
amendments, and did. And they failed only because of the attitude of<br />
the Coalition. You have got to say It Is a first that Liberal and<br />
National party Senators to vote dlown the amendments sponsored by<br />
the National Farmers Federation and the mining industry.<br />
J: Simon Crean said on Sunday that a lot of those amendments would do<br />
damage to the mining and farming industry, but you say that those<br />
amendments<br />
PIM; The Bill was about the validating of past acts which might have been<br />
invalid. It was never about dealing with valid acts. Valid mining leases<br />
with valid renewals are exactly that, but some people want a clarifying<br />
or a reaffirmation of the amendments. All right, we sought to oblige<br />
them the Liberal party voted them down, but again the Bill will hang<br />
together without them.<br />
J: For every pastoral lease which expires In Queensland will revert to<br />
native title..<br />
PIM: Say that again<br />
J: As pastoral leases in Queensland expire because native title is held to<br />
exist in its equivalent to freehold, because there isn't automatic title<br />
to renewal in Queensland, those pastoral leases will become native<br />
title.<br />
PM: That is not right. Look, the fact is the Bill is fine in terms of valid<br />
leases. We were quite happy to entertain these clarifying things, but<br />
that is not the point. The key point is, there should be a proper basis<br />
to our public life and a basis of morality to it. This tawdry procedure,<br />
as the Sydney Morning Herald calls it, mean-spirited opportunism and<br />
truculent inflexibility, shouldn't be part and parcel of our national life,<br />
not around a matter like this not around any matter, but most<br />
particularly not around a matter as historic as this.<br />
So, I am just making it clear that the Liberal party, without any<br />
principle, believes that it can wear us away on this legislation. It can<br />
think again. And if it has got leadership squabbles on and it has it<br />
ought to resolve them in their own right and not play out their<br />
leadership troubles through the Mabo legislation which they are<br />
currently doing.<br />
J: Prime Minister, when will you decide on your new Treasurer?<br />
PM: They are different matters.<br />
ends. </p>
