PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 12 APRIL 1989<br />
The wage tax family package announced tonight substantially<br />
addresses the issues raised with me by representatives of<br />
the Women's Tax Convention.<br />
The tax cuts, in particular the reduction in the lowest<br />
rates, will benefit women workers.<br />
The majority of women workers earn less than $ 25,000 a year.<br />
A single taxpayer on average female earnings of about<br />
$ 17., 000 will receive a tax cut of $ 11 a week, or a fall of<br />
almost 19 per cent in the amount of tax paid.<br />
The wages strategy in the Treasurer's statement will ensure<br />
minimum award rates of low income earners will rise.<br />
These rises will be provided in a responsible manner in the<br />
context of award restructuring.<br />
Together with the tax cuts these award rates increases will<br />
substantially raise the earnings of many women workers.<br />
Under the wages strategy, wage increases for low income<br />
earners will be phased in carefully to raise the minimum<br />
award rates of some low paid workers. By phasing in the<br />
increases adverse employment effects will be avoided.<br />
The wage tax strategy targets low income earners as called<br />
for in resolutions from the recent Women's Tax Convention.<br />
The Government has also recognised the cost of children in a<br />
substantial family package. Recognition of the cost of<br />
children through increased family allowance payments was a<br />
high priority of the Women's Tax Convention.<br />
I am pleased the Government has been able to address those<br />
concerns. The family allowance will be increased to $ 9 perchild<br />
per week for the first three children and $ 12 for<br />
subsequent children. This will give a family with two<br />
children an extra $ 5.25 a week tax free.<br />
Families in receipt of Family Allowance Supplement will<br />
receive an additional $ 3.10 per week for children aged<br />
13-15 years.<br />
one income families, including sole parents, will receive<br />
additional assistance of $ 3 per week through the tax system. </p>
<p>The indexation of the family components of the package will<br />
ensure that the value of the assistance to families will be<br />
maintained. The measures for pensioners included in the Government's<br />
package will also benefit women as they make up the majority<br />
of pensions.<br />
All pensioners will benefit from the decision to bring<br />
forward by 12 weeks the timing of indexation of pensions and<br />
benefits. The alignment of the income and tax thresholds so that full<br />
rate pensioners pay no tax will save single pensioners up to<br />
$ 7.50 per week in 1989-90 and up to $ 12.50 per week in<br />
1990-91 when the measure is fully phased in.<br />
Women made their voices heard in the lead up to tonight's<br />
package. The structure of the package is evidence that<br />
their concerns were taken seriously. </p>
