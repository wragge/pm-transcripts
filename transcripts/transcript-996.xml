OPENING OF CHRYSLER MANUFACTURING CENTRE,<br />
T1ONSLEY PARK, SOUTH AUSTRALIA 2ND OCTOR19<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister. the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Sir, Mr. Premier and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
Might I begin with a rather assertive question?<br />
Can you hear me? Because I cantt hear myself. I've been<br />
flying with a cold. In a little time, I will unveil something<br />
or other here. I'm still not clear as to whether I declare<br />
the building open or the estate open, or declare it duly<br />
inaugurated, but it doesn't matter because at a glance this<br />
afternoon, you could tell it has been open for weeks. ( Laughter)<br />
And therefore my function is purely retrospective.<br />
I must say, listening to Mr. Cheseborough, as I did<br />
with great interest, I thought he seemed a little biased in<br />
favour of this car the Valiant. ( Laughter) It puts me in a<br />
very, very embarrassing position, because on one occasion, I<br />
opened a factory that was going to produce a competitor car<br />
for the Ford Company, On another occasion, I seem to remember<br />
opening something fo, the Holden people. Very difficult to<br />
be a politician nowadays ( Laughter) but at the same time I<br />
must say that apart from his propaganda, I was the recipient<br />
as I came out here, with my wife, of -he most pointed piece of<br />
propagand, the kind of thing that could happen to you only in<br />
South Australia, ( Laughter) only in a State where no poor<br />
humble Federal fellow like me can possibly arrive or depart<br />
without being the victim of propaganda from beginning to end.<br />
And what happened this afternoon? There we x., ere,<br />
sitting in scme car thac ,. ras p-o idod for me I dontt know<br />
what make I looked to the right, there was a Valiant? I looked<br />
to the left, there was a Valiant; I looked ahead of us there<br />
was a Valiant, and I thought, " By Jove, this car has got one<br />
hu-ndred per cent. of the market." Indeed without desiring to<br />
advertise any other ear, it was a distinct refreshment of my<br />
sW'rits to discover in a moment that there was another car on<br />
the road. I think it was a Holden. ( Laughter) But, there they<br />
were to the right of us, to the left of us and in front of<br />
us. Now, I am no expert, Sir, but all I can tell you is that<br />
my wife made the most admiring remarks as they passed alongside<br />
us and that is a good beginning because women buy cars and men<br />
pay for them. ( Laughter)<br />
Sir, on any occasion like this it is very interesting<br />
for me to look back a little, if you donlt mind. For example,<br />
I can look back over a great number of years of very close<br />
friendship with Fergie over there. There never was a better<br />
representative in negotiations with political people than<br />
Fergie. ( Applause) Many is the time over the last fifteen<br />
years, or several times at any rate, over the last fifteen years,<br />
he has had occasion to look at me, sometimes with approval,<br />
sometimes with disapproval, dependent entirely on the rate of<br />
sales tax, ( Laughter) but however it went, he was a man I<br />
want to tell this to you in the presence of his colleagues<br />
on this platform he was a man who was always intelligent and<br />
understanding and put a case without pretending that there was<br />
no other side to the question. This is a very great asset and<br />
I have always had a great respect for him.<br />
But as I was reminding an audience in Sydney the other<br />

day, it is not much less than thirty years ago that I found<br />
myself then being Attorney-General of Australia talking<br />
to a very famous motor car manufacturer in England. I won't<br />
mention his narle you'll all think of the wrong one but<br />
he was a rather melancholy chap, I thought, and we met on an<br />
occasionandtiutook~ me into a corner and he was under the erroneous<br />
belief that I was a person of some influence I was a humble<br />
Attorney-General in those days. He said to me, " You people<br />
must not make motor bodies in Australia," Well, shad3s of<br />
Adelaide, you know. ( Laughter)<br />
Dear me, this rather rjc'czed me because in my earlier<br />
days I used to come and be a house guest with Ted Holden and<br />
I was very familiar with the motor body wVOr. ks.<br />
shouldn't make them. You peoplE. ought to grow wool and wheat<br />
and things you understand." 1 TiAi was a serious proposition,<br />
and our-modest motor body industry ought to be swept out.<br />
I tried to explain to him that what was then a modest, smallish<br />
motor body industry would undoubtedly some day be some kind<br />
of fragment ii,. a very enormous motor vehicle industry, and<br />
that it was very foolish on his part to think that he could<br />
stop the tide frcm mro ving. However, he was much older than<br />
I was, and therufore much wiser and he therefore disagreed<br />
with me. ( Laughter)<br />
Now what has happened since? It wasn't long after<br />
that conversation only about five years, I wtould thi nk that<br />
I found myself as a Prim~ e Minister greatly concerned tc see<br />
whether we could establish an industry of building motor<br />
vehicles in Australia, and this was regarded by a lot of<br />
people wit%, h some hor-ror and we had all sorts of expert ad~ vice.<br />
Expert advice is the very devi. l., You want to have at least<br />
a hundi-ed experts and then conduct a Gallup Poll among them<br />
and then think out tiae answer for yourseif. ( Laughter) That's<br />
my firm belief.<br />
The exerssad," h, but you cnnt do it. Nobody<br />
could build a car in Australia with less than I think it was<br />
forty, but it may have been fifty thousand vehicles a year as<br />
t'. e extent of the demand." " And that, of course," they said,<br />
" 1is impossible. Not within remote cooee is the time when<br />
you can sell 50,7000 motor vehicles in Australi* a, made in<br />
Australia." Well, it is only twenty-five years ago that that was<br />
happening. I remember it very well. There were all sorts<br />
of misconceptions, there were all sorts of expressions of<br />
anxiety and inferiority on the part of people, and today we<br />
have in Australia a state of affairs in which 4+ 00,000 new<br />
motor vehicles go on the: roads every year. Four hundred<br />
thousand.... and there will be thousands and thousands of<br />
them that will come out of this great factory. The whole<br />
scene has changed, and so far from great motor vehicle<br />
people in other countries regarding with hostility what goes<br />
on in Australia, they have steadily, one by one, come to<br />
Australia themselves and invested in Australia,<br />
I remember in the same impudent period of my life<br />
when I was much more impudent than I am now, having a talk<br />
in America to the then head of General Motors and telling him<br />
that if he wanted to feel any assurance about his position<br />
in Australia, the right thing to do was to put somte money<br />
here and do sortie work here and produce a few~ jobs here, and<br />
a e 9 a* o </p>
<p>-3<br />
this rather surprised him, though perhaps it wasntt entirely<br />
without effect. ftmay have had some small effect because,<br />
much later on, it happened.<br />
And the same way in Great Britain. 4herever<br />
you go in Australia today, you will see engaged in the<br />
business of car and vehicle production companies whose names<br />
are household words in Great Britain, in America, in Germany,<br />
in France. This tremendous movement of enterprise into<br />
Australia is the most exciting thing of our time and vre ought<br />
to be proud of it and we ought not to be too frightened of it<br />
and we ought not to believe that whatever is done to p) revent<br />
it from running into excesses is something wrong, Uhat we<br />
want to maintain in this country is something that we have<br />
been enjoying for years, a remarkable stability in the value<br />
of money, not unimportant to the investor, and also the most<br />
astonishing rate of growitL-, growth of population, growth of<br />
employment, growth 311 along the line,<br />
It's a marvellous thing, isnvt it, how all these<br />
things, proper-ly considered work together. I go around a<br />
works like this. I don't need to be told that there are<br />
quite a number o'L' people ILere, as I go around who are whp. t<br />
we usud to call New A~ ustralians, whc are peopie who migrated<br />
ha since the war. There are millions now anyh-ow, something<br />
well over a million in Australia and every large factory I<br />
go to contains a high. percentage ol' people who have come in<br />
in these years. There cculd not Lave been a. n immigration policy<br />
or programme without eirployment on this scale in industries<br />
of this kind. Ths rural industries, vital as they are to<br />
the survival of Australia, can't employ people by the scores<br />
of thousands extra every year, WIe know tiiat they cant.<br />
It is industries of this kind which enable the migration<br />
programme to continue, and the fact that the migratCion<br />
programme continues, that you have this remarkable increase<br />
in the population year by year has given strength and tone<br />
and optimism to the people who run retail stores in Australia,<br />
to all sorts of other manufacturers who produce things that<br />
in demand by stores and which are bought by them because<br />
they are in demand by their ordinary customers. This is a<br />
whole interwoven structure.<br />
I dont profess to have any particular credit<br />
for this. I just think I ought to remind you that the prime<br />
political responsibility for economic policy and financial<br />
stability in Australia comes flatly on to the Federal Parliament<br />
and the Federal Government. ( Applause) And this is<br />
perhaps a matter that gets a little overlooked occasionally.<br />
I look down here. I see one of my colleagues in the Ministry,<br />
Dr. Forbes. This is a great responsibility he carries. I<br />
carry a bigger one, because when anything goes wrong, everybody<br />
knows whose fault it is, ( Laughter)<br />
But this is our sole contribution, that we must<br />
try to be sensible try to have a stability in money, try to<br />
have an economic climate that will favour the growt h Of<br />
industry in Australia, and if we do that, we have made some<br />
useful contribution to what goes on. But in the long run,<br />
at the operating end, it is the people who have the imagination<br />
to establish an enterprise of this kind in this place, it is<br />
the thousands of people who work or will work in it in all<br />
sorts of degrees of employment, these are the people who really<br />
make the result because it is on the skill of their work, the<br />
0. 0 0 6 0 */ IF </p>
<p>fidelity7 the honesty of their work, that the industry that they<br />
are working in will depend. This is wihat will persuade the<br />
people to buy the product and this is what will mean in the<br />
long run a growing prosperity right down the line.<br />
Sir, whenever I come to a matter of this kind,<br />
these thoughts pass through my mind. I think I am one of three<br />
people who went into the Federal Parliament thirty years ago<br />
and is still there in the inscrutable wisdom of Provi. dence,<br />
( Laughter) Only three of us, Very interesting, because<br />
looking back over that time, I would say that they w:, e by<br />
far the most exciting thirty years in the history of Australia,<br />
Indeed, that is the last thing I want to say to you.<br />
Don't let us fall into the error of thinking that<br />
all the history is in the books, the books thiat we read at<br />
school, Some history is there, but don't let us think it is<br />
all there. There is more history being made around us each<br />
year than was made in twenty-five years in earlier generations.<br />
Tremendously exciting history wonderful things new generations<br />
coming on, and I, though I belong to an old and I suppose,<br />
partly exhausted generation, I am all for it. I think this is<br />
tie moft tremendous thing. We ought to be realising it, we<br />
ought to to proud of it and when we come along here we ought<br />
to, as I am sure we do, lcok around us and say, " Thxs is the<br />
perfect illustration of the world that we are living in and<br />
the Aust:; alia that is and is to be."<br />
I now do whatever it is, retrospectively. </p>
