    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of all Australians, I wish Her Majesty The Queen a very happy 80th birthday.</p>
<p>The Queen has been a remarkable monarch. In 54 years on the throne, she has demonstrated an unremitting dedication to the duties of her office. Through that time she has displayed a constant interest in and concern for the Australian people.</p>
<p>The Queen has been a witness to all of the events that have shaped our nation over that time. Through this period she has fulfilled her Constitutional role in Australia in an impeccable way.</p>
<p>I am sure that all Australians will join me in paying tribute to Her Majesty's steadfastness and continuing concern for all nations of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>The indelible links between the United Kingdom and Australia have been nurtured and strengthened during The Queen's reign.</p>
<p>Her Majesty has visited Australia on 15 occasions and has always exhibited an extensive knowledge of national, Commonwealth and international affairs. There are few people in the world more versed in statecraft and political affairs than The Queen.</p>
<p>As a gift to mark The Queen's birthday, the Australian Government has prepared an album of rare photographs of Her Majesty on her 15 visits to Australia.  </p>
