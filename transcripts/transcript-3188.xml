PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 203<br />
12 March 1974<br />
PRIMARY INDUSTRY REFEREN~ CES SENT TO THE INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE<br />
COMMDISSION<br />
The Prime Minister announced toda-Y' that three references<br />
dealing with: the apple and pear stabilisation plan<br />
the dried vine fruits stabilisation plan<br />
bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis slaughter<br />
compensation<br />
have been sent to the Industries Assistance Commission on 11 March<br />
1974 for inquiry and report.<br />
Because of legislation requirements there is a need<br />
for these references to be enquired into and reported upon by<br />
the Commission as soon as possible.<br />
The apple and pear stabilisation plan expires with<br />
the 1975 scason. It is anticipated that this will be a relatively<br />
complex enquiry and a report will be needed before 31 August 1975<br />
to allow for any necessary negotiations with industry and legislation<br />
to apply to the 1976 harvest. Similarly considerations apply to<br />
the dried vine fruits stabilisation plan which also expires with<br />
the 1975 season and will require a report before 31 August 1975.<br />
In the case of the bovine tuberculosis scheme there is an agreement<br />
with the States that it is to-be reviewed before 30 June 1976.<br />
The brucellosis slaughter compensation scheme has been recommended<br />
by the Australian Agricultural Council and in order that the<br />
Government can consider the proposal further a report will be needed<br />
from the Commission in time for the Government to consider and,<br />
if necessary, introduce legislation effective from 1 January 1976.<br />
