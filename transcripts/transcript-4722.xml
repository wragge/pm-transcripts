COMMONW4EALTH AND NORTHERN TERRITORY OMBUDSMEN<br />
The Prime Minister announced today the introduction<br />
of a Bill into Parliament to amend the Commonwealth Ombudsman<br />
Act 1976 to facilitate commencement of the operations of<br />
the Northern Territory Ombudsman under the Ombudsman ( Northern<br />
Territory) Ordinance passed by the Northern Territory<br />
Legislative Assembly late last year.<br />
The establishment of a local Ombudsman in the Northern<br />
Territory is in line with the Commonwealth Government's<br />

responsible self-government. Additional transfers of<br />
functions are planned for 1 July 1978.<br />

the Northern Territory Public Service.<br />
The Commonwealth Ombudsman's jurisdiction in respect<br />
of administrative actions undertaken by Commonwealth officials<br />
in the Northern Territory will be maintained as it is in the<br />
States. 000---</p>
