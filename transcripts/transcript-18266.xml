Today the Australian people pay our respects to all the citizen-soldiers of your âcity on a hillâ.</p>
<p>Meeting, here as we do, on a âHill of Sacrificeâ.</p>
<p>For the Australian people and for the American people this is a year of anniversaries.</p>
<p>Seventy years since 1941.</p>
<p>Since the infamous attack on Pearl Harbour, since that day which first brought Australia and the United States together in a Pacific war.</p>
<p>Sixty years since 1951.</p>
<p>Since the signing of the ANZUS Treaty which joined Australia and the United States in a solemn commitment, since first we joined together formally as allies, not just as friends.</p>
<p>And ten years since September 11.</p>
<p>Since the attacks on America which changed the world we live in but could not change the values which together we share, since for the first time our ANZUS treaty was invoked.</p>
<p>In this year of anniversaries, it is a very great privilege for me, representing every Australian, to be together with you as you remember the veterans of America's wars.</p>
<p>In this beautiful and hallowed American place  -  where so many of America's own lie in graves which they found too soon  -  you would be well entitled to say:</p>
<p>They died for us. This is a day and a place for ourselves alone.</p>
<p>But we Australians know that this is not your way.</p>
<p>Because we know that so many of these buried here died for us too.</p>
<p>When we were under attack in the Pacific, so many of these buried here were among those who came to our aid.</p>
<p>They fought with us, together, side by side, step by bloody step.</p>
<p>So today, when Australians remember our own fallen, we remember yours.</p>
<p>And I remember this, too:</p>
<p>That when the fear of an invasion of my country was finally destroyed, it was destroyed by sailors from your country, destroyed at the Battle of the Coral Sea.</p>
<p>It is a battle which is immortal in Australia, a battle which is immortalised in the beautiful Map Galleries here as well.</p>
<p>Today, Australians honour your fallen.</p>
<p>Australia does not forget.</p>
<p>And we remember the origin of this day itself.</p>
<p>I believe something of the peace-loving character of your people is shown in the importance you place on this day, November 11.</p>
<p>It is not the anniversary of the onset of a great conflict.</p>
<p>Not the commemoration of a great victory or great feat of arms, it is the day and the hour of the end of the Great War.</p>
<p>You remember your veterans in the moment to which each one of them dedicated their dearest hopes - you remember them at the moment when peace began.</p>
<p>Our two nations have been allies these past sixty years.</p>
<p>Our two peoples have been friends for longer still.</p>
<p>Through many dangers, toils, and snares, we have already come.</p>
<p>Australia will never forget the sacrifices you made for peace in the past.</p>
<p>Australia will always share the hopes you have in the future for peace. </p>
