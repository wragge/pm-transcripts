The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard and Minister for Sport, Mark Arbib today welcomed home Australia's successful Commonwealth Games team.</p>
<p>The Australian team returned from the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games with 177 medals - 74 gold, 55 silver and 48 bronze.</p>
<p>Australia's swimmers led the charge with 54 medals, including 22 gold, while our cyclists won 14 of 18 events and brought home 21 medals.</p>
<p>Australia topped the medal count, beating the home nation India, which had its best ever games with 101 medals, and traditional rivals England.</p>
<p>The Aussie team again showed its depth, winning medals in all 19 sports including gold in 13 sports.</p>
<p>There were a number of outstanding individual performances, with swimmer Alicia Coutts winning five gold medals, team mate Emily Seebohm winning eight medals, artistic gymnast Lauren Mitchell winning four gold and a silver and rhythmic gymnast Naazmi Johnston winning three gold and two silver medals.</p>
<p>The Indian Government and Organising Committee should be congratulated for hosting a safe and successful Commonwealth Games.</p>
<p>The Games were a showcase for India and its people and Australia's Commonwealth Games Team appreciated the warm welcome received from their Indian hosts.</p>
<p>"I particularly want to congratulate the team for their decision to donate money and uniforms to raise about $30,000 for Indian charities," Senator Arbib said.</p>
<p>"The money and uniforms will be split between three charities which provide health and sports leadership for underprivileged communities in India.</p>
<p>"This is a wonderful gesture of friendship from our young athletes who are great ambassadors for our country</p>
