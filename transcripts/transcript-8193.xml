TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH ALAN JONES, RADIO 2UE,<br />
9 NOVEMBER 19190<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JONES: Prime Minister, good morning and welcome.<br />
PM: Good morning and thank you Alan.<br />
JONES: Prime Minister, I think your father and mine, both<br />
resting now : Ln peace, would say this is damn boring stuff<br />
isn't it?<br />
PM: You've hit the nail on the head. The actual jargon is<br />
boring but the impact of it is going to be tremendously<br />
important for every one of your listeners.<br />
JONES: Yes indeed. Can we just take these perhaps bit by<br />
bit. Telecommunications, what are you suggesting that that<br />
duopoly you've now freed it up so that that someone will be<br />
competing AUSTEL will compete with Telecom but that will<br />
only go until when?<br />
PM: Until 1997. See what you've got to understand<br />
listeners have got to understand is that to get<br />
competition into the telecommunications industry is a very<br />
expensive business. To undertake the massive investment<br />
that's required to set up in competition to an already<br />
established entity like Telecom/ OTC is and will be. You've<br />
got to give them a time, a period, in which they can have<br />
the opportunity of getting some return on their investment.<br />
So that we're limiting that situation of the two. That is<br />
the merged OTC/ Telecom being the one publicly owned entity<br />
and then a private competitor based upon the sale of AUSSAT.<br />
We'll have that going through to 1997 so that they'll have<br />
the opportunity of establishing it. Then at the end of 97<br />
that will come to an end and if anyone else wants to seek to<br />
come in in that condition they'll. be able to. Although it<br />
may well be the case that you'll have such effective tough<br />
competition and with other people operating in the mobile<br />
phone areas that, and the cordless telephone that it may<br />
be that no other major competitor will want to come in.<br />
Because you'll have, under this system that we're<br />
introducing, Alan, it will be the most competitive situation<br />
you've got anywhere in the world.<br />
JONES: just take it from the point of view of our<br />
listeners. I mean, what we see, I suppose, is that it's a </p>
<p>fairly limited market and that because of our enormous<br />
geography only one aspect of that market surely is<br />
lucrative. That is the seaboard market. I don't see anyone<br />
bursting themselves to service Birdsville or Cunnamulla or<br />
Brewarrina. Now how are any number of competitors going to<br />
make a quid in that market?<br />
PM: Well the experience shows that with the enormous<br />
changes in technology that are occurring in this industry.<br />
There's more rapid change in technology here than in any<br />
other industry in the world. But what was previously<br />
unthought of or incomprehensible becomes, with new<br />
technology, possible. In regard to STD, for instance, which<br />
goes to all the sort of areas that you're talking about, as<br />
a result of the competition that we are introducing it's<br />
estimated that there'll be reductions of up to 40% in STD<br />
charges. Now by definition<br />
JONES: Did I read just on that point did I read in your<br />
speech that you said there'd be price caps. Is this right<br />
that there would be ceilings on what could be charged for<br />
local, trunk and international calls, is that right?<br />
PM: Yes, because what we've already got is what we call a<br />
CPI minus X factor. In other words, what we now say to<br />
Telecom that they are limited in price movements to the<br />
Consumer Price Index minus a factor of X. You set that<br />
factor of X, you know, let's say that is CPI minus 4% on<br />
the assumptioins about what productivity improvements<br />
there'll be. The same concept is going to apply into the<br />
future. JONES: OK. I tell you what you've got on top of it. By<br />
gee it's not all that easy. Just one final thing on<br />
telecommunications. In the speech I noticed an interesting<br />
statistic. You say that the Asia Pacific region have half<br />
the world's population but only 17%<br />
9PM: Of the..<br />
JONES: Now does that mean that that's a potential export<br />
market for us?<br />
PM: Yes. To round out that see what I'm saying is that<br />
there are 500 million phones in the world. 500 million<br />
phones in the world but that Asia Pacific region, with half<br />
of the world's population, only has. 17% of that 500 million<br />
phones. Now with the rising. standard of living, as you<br />
know, that's occurring in that region there's going to be a<br />
massive increase in demand for the number of phones which<br />
are going to double, you know, by the end of the century,<br />
it's estimated. Now we are ideally placed, Alan, here in<br />
Australia to get a big share of that action. The decisions<br />
that we've taken now are going to make Australia very, very<br />
much more competitive to get in and get a slice of that<br />
action. </p>
<p>JONES: OK. That's fairly obvious. Well done. Just one<br />
thing I didn't understand. You've just said this "' we will<br />
not place in the hands of future Treasurers or Ministers for<br />
Finance responsibility for delivering service in areas where<br />
competition does not eventuate, nor do we expect a new<br />
philanthropic owner for Telecom could be found who would<br />
provide them." Does that mean that<br />
PM: No what<br />
JONES: does that mean where it's not<br />
PM: No, no, no.<br />
JONES: the service.<br />
PM: That is -a bit elliptical. But what I'm saying there is<br />
that under the present situation we have what are called<br />
community sex-vice obligations. Under that, for instance, if<br />
you look at remote and rural Australia, which you were<br />
properly concerned with earlier, if you had a system of<br />
charging for installation and service for those remote areas<br />
on the basis of simply what it cost.<br />
JONES: Yes.<br />
PM: Then those people would have to pay more. But under<br />
the system weI've got now we say there is a community service<br />
obligation to see that they are benefited by some, as it<br />
were, cross-subsidies that the more profitable areas of the<br />
network are used to subsidise those remote areas. That's<br />
what you call-<br />
JONES: 1: he telecommunications owner or the Government?<br />
PM: Well that's done through the actually through<br />
Telecom. Now that's the very precise point of what we're<br />
saying. What's been argued by the conservatives, by our<br />
opponents, is, oh well don't worry about that, if there's<br />
something to be done in looking after that we wouldn't<br />
require that of the operators we might do something in the<br />
budget about that. Well you know what they are like. Like<br />
hell they would. They'd just leave those people to suffer.<br />
What that section of my speech is saying is, that we're not<br />
going, like -the conservatives would be, to leave it to the<br />
possible discretion of future Treasurers or Ministers of<br />
Finance or so-on to say, oh we might find something in a<br />
budget to help those people. We will build it into the new<br />
system we've got under the regulations that those who are<br />
providing the services are going to have to continue to help<br />
those people in Australia who, by virtue of their location<br />
and no other reason, are up for significantly higher costs.<br />
JONES: OK. Good. That is Aviation. We won't say<br />
much about that because there's two things I wanted to ask<br />
you about that. You have said new services, lower prices<br />
and so-on. Deregulation November 1. You would know that<br />
Ansett and Australian have just put their fares up </p>
<p>I'm inundated with callers here who say they can't get a<br />
slice of any of these cheaper fares at all. When are the<br />
people you're talking to now then going to see these lower<br />
prices? PM: Well I understand that there are lower prices for some<br />
services actually operating. I mean, I know<br />
JONES: You've really created a controversy. I can tell<br />
you. PM: Well all I know I know of people who've actually got<br />
the benefit and have used them. People on my staff, for<br />
instance, have had the benefit of them. Now I think what<br />
you're going to find, Alan, is that as the new competitor<br />
actually enters, that there is no doubt that there will be<br />
significant price reductions available over a range of<br />
services in this country. I mean, it's<br />
JONES: Does this mean, though, that Ansett and Australian<br />
are currently working at too generous a profit level; or are<br />
they too inefficient; or are they too overstaffed? Where<br />
can those costs be cut?<br />
PM: Well there's always improvement in productivity coming<br />
from new ways of doing things. Let me say in respect of the<br />
current operators that as you very well know and you were<br />
very sympathetic through all that dispute and I appreciate<br />
that very much but you know that they suffered very<br />
significant losses last year during the period of the<br />
pilots' dispu~ te. I mean, it cost them an enormous amount of<br />
money. Both of them. There is some sense in which they'll<br />
be wanting to the extent possible to recoup some of those<br />
very substantial losses that they incurred then.<br />
JONES: Why dio you have different rules for foreign<br />
ownership? 1: must say I get a bit, I get a bit tarty about<br />
all that. I notice that domestic Australian Airlines you're<br />
going to permit foreign ownership of 15 to 25% for an<br />
individual, 40% of it's an aggregate and Australian Airlines<br />
or when you'r. e selling Qantas foreign investment of<br />
PM: Yes. The reason for that differentiation is this, that<br />
the 35% is the figure which is regarded within the<br />
international aviation industry and the agreements that are<br />
reached in the international aviation industry for single<br />
designated riLghts for national carriers. That if there's<br />
any more than 35% ownership in the national airline then<br />
it's not regarded as a, as the national airline which gets<br />
the benefits of designation under the international system<br />
of designating rights of entry between countries. If in<br />
other words, if Qantas was more than 35% owned it wouldn't<br />
be an Australian airline<br />
JONES: I am just wondering how for example Channel Ten<br />
couldn't get 35% foreign ownership? </p>
<p>PM: Well let me make the point As far as the<br />
international operators are concerned if we had more than<br />
foreign ownership there in regard to Qantas, we simply<br />
wouldn't get -the benefits that are associated with the<br />
designation of rights of one country to fly into another<br />
because it wouldn't be regarded as an Australian airline and<br />
that determines the<br />
JONES: Right. Well I just wonder why Channel Ten can't<br />
have 35% foreign ownership?<br />
PM: Well Channel Ten's not flying internationally.<br />
JONES: But as a media outlet as opposed to an aviation<br />
outlet, well as a media business as opposed to an aviation<br />
business. PM: Well the principle there and you haven't got the same<br />
clear cut sort of question involved there, Alan. It's a<br />
question of saying do we in Australia want an important part<br />
of our lifestyle, that is television, to be capable of being<br />
dominated by international interests. I concede readily to<br />
you, Alan, that I can't be dogmatic and say there is a<br />
precise percentage which means you avoid that problem. But<br />
the concept is one I think you would agree with. We don't<br />
want, or at least I don't as an Australian<br />
JONES: I'm just wondering what the dip in 35% to get them<br />
out of strife, 20% won't.<br />
PM: Well the; strife, let me remind you, has been not of the<br />
Government's creation<br />
JONES: Owner induced, owner induced.<br />
PM: Owner irLduced because people paid prices which were not<br />
relevant to the earning capacity of the asset they were<br />
acquiring. Now if people have made those sorts of mistakes<br />
and have crea~ ted difficulties, I don't think we should<br />
jeopardise our Australianism and our desire to protect<br />
Australian cultural identities because people have made<br />
commercial mistakes.<br />
JONES: Talki~ ng about commercial mistakes, would you be<br />
offended if we took a commercial break and we'll come back<br />
to you?<br />
PM: You need it,. mate.<br />
JONES: The National Road Freight Corporation, I don't think<br />
there's any debate on that, up and running for uniformity in<br />
national rail, a national road organisation. But could I<br />
just ask one question which does worry me? I hear everyone<br />
talking about it and this is it. Road user charges, there<br />
seems to be a movement abroad that the truckie, for example,<br />
has got to pay for the damage he does to the roads when in<br />
fact many people who don't drive cars, are not involved in<br />
transport in any way benefit from the fact that the truckie </p>
<p>6.<br />
belts through the night in awful conditions to get the<br />
Sydney Morning Herald to Tamworth by 9 o'clock or the fresh<br />
fruit to Moree by 9 o'clock and people who benefit most<br />
probably never go on the roads again. Are we saying the<br />
truckie must pay even though those who benefit don't?<br />
PM: No, it's not that. The basic problem we've got is<br />
this, that St~ ates which are seeking to get a greater<br />
contribution from those who actually impose the heaviest<br />
damage, the heavy trucks, and this is particularly in NSW.<br />
NSW has sought to have a system whereby the registration has<br />
a relevance t: o the impact of the vehicle. But because we<br />
have the Federation you have other States who say, oh no,<br />
we'll have lower registration fees and this is<br />
JONES: I'm -Just asking a question<br />
PM: But wail: a minute. Let me make the point<br />
JONES: I want to look at the point about who should pay for<br />
the roads<br />
PM: But what I'm saying is you mean you'll be virtually<br />
getting nothiLng like an equitable contribution from the<br />
heavy users if you continue the system we've got. To be<br />
precise, you have NSW having a registration fee which seeks<br />
to get a reasonable contribution from them, not the totality<br />
of it, but a reasonable contribution. So what happens? SA<br />
says no and they come register with us. We've got a very,<br />
very, very low fee. And that means that the concept of<br />
getting any sort of reasonable return from the heavy road<br />
users is frustrated. So what we're going to do is have a<br />
national system whereby you will, on a basis which is<br />
equitably worked out mean that those who use it most and<br />
cause the most damage will make a fairer contribution. It<br />
doesn't mean that the taxpaying community as a whole won't<br />
be making its contribution. We spend billions of dollars on<br />
roads. JONES: Right. Just time always beats us but there are some<br />
things, if you don't mind if I just deviate from the speech<br />
for a couple of questions.<br />
PM: Sure, sure.<br />
JONES: One iLs all my listeners and half Australia last<br />
night saw these pictures of great tips being dug and oranges<br />
being. thrown into them,. if.. it wasn't last night it was where<br />
sheep are being, you know, thrown into them. I mean how<br />
long can we sustain this business about bringing imports in<br />
from Brazil while the local citrus industry is being<br />
destroyed and isn't there a better way of getting rid of<br />
20,000,000 sheep or 50,000,000 we don't want than shooting<br />
them and burying them in pits?<br />
PM: Sure. Well let me answer the basic problem which I<br />
know must seem to your listeners and television viewers as<br />
very strange. Let's understand this point. For the last </p>
<p>few years we have been going flat out as an Australian<br />
Government in. the GATT Round to try and get the countries<br />
particularly of Europe and the United States which is<br />
operating in reaction to Europe, to cut out their export<br />
subsidies and. their production subsidies which simply mean<br />
that those co'untries are producing massive mountains of<br />
agricultural produce which the taxpayers subsidise at an<br />
enormous expense running into something like $ 200B a year<br />
between the Europeans and the North Americans. So we're<br />
arguing, we're up there arguing you've got to cut these out<br />
so that the world's most efficient producers which are the<br />
Australian farmers, are going to get a fair price out there<br />
and a fair gco in the international markets. Now in that<br />
situation how can we, if we're arguing that, which is<br />
obviously in the world's interests and in Australia's<br />
interests say oh, but as far as we're concerned we'll put<br />
barriers out to people bringing in their<br />
JONES: Fair enough. That's an answer.<br />
PM: So we can't do that. Now in regard to the second part<br />
of your question, I'm appalled, of course, like you when you<br />
see a situation of it not being, the products just being<br />
destroyed andt if the community we're able to organise some<br />
way as I see that some charitable organisations have to<br />
cooperate wit~ h farmers and so on to get this produce and use<br />
it for those who are desperately in need, well you know<br />
that's very worthwhile. You've got to, of course, recognise<br />
that if that were done to, you know, an unlimited extent<br />
then the position of the producers would even be worse<br />
because the prices they are able to get would reduce<br />
further. JONES: Just one final thing. Everywhere, I know you said<br />
in you speech everyone says we should do more and we should<br />
do more particularly on what's called fiscal policy, in<br />
other words cutting back expenditure. But we saw yesterday<br />
I believe that they were after you in the question that<br />
was asked by the Member for Wannon in relation to stamps<br />
because a rumour went around that you had been using your<br />
office as a Post Office for the Labor Party at the last<br />
election and that's apparently why they asked the question-<br />
PM: And it blew up in their face, didn't it.<br />
JONES: It bl. ew up in their face. And so you've got on the<br />
National Party side this disgraceful waste. Yesterday we<br />
did a story here about the Tax Office in Brisbane buying<br />
themselves into a block, the most extravagant block of<br />
accommodation available up there, where they could've saved<br />
$ 1B going somewhere else, $ lM going somewhere else. I mean<br />
that's waste and extravagant. When are the public, you<br />
know, going to feel as though there is a bit of frugality at<br />
work? PM: Well I think you know, Alan, that as far as the Federal<br />
Government is concerned we've now had four successive years<br />
where we've produced a surplus and that surplus has come by </p>
<p>8.<br />
cutting very vigorously into our outlays. We've had<br />
successive years now of real reductions in Commonwealth<br />
outlays. Now when you have budgets the size of ours I<br />
suppose even in aggregate I've been successively reducing<br />
those outlays<br />
JONES: inaudible<br />
PM: Something that's never been done before. I guess in<br />
the size of the outlays we've got you'll always be able to<br />
find some example where something could've been done better.<br />
I'm not aware of the particular instance that you refer to<br />
JONES: make you aware of it.<br />
PM: I'll have<br />
JONES: I'll be in touch with your office.<br />
PM: OK.<br />
JONES: Just one final thing before you go. A caller rang<br />
this morning, or at least we're running a campaign here this<br />
morning to try and raise $ 90,000 for a leukemia cancer<br />
victim who couldn't get the treatment in Australia but<br />
because they couldn't, have now got to fork out the bill for<br />
treatment in America. Is that fair, $ 90,000 to keep a bloke<br />
alive? PM: Well I'd like, Alan, to write to you on this. It's<br />
something which is not capable of<br />
JONES: No.<br />
PM: Of detail<br />
JONES: I'll refer that one to your office.<br />
PM: And I'll. certainly send you a detailed response on it<br />
because there are considerations here which I think you'll<br />
appreciate. JONES: OK, thank you for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you, mate.<br />
