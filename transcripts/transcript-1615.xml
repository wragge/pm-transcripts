EXPORT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AUSTRALIAN DIECASTERS<br />
( Statement by Mr. J. McEwen, Deputy Prime Minister and 3JUN 1967<br />
Minister for Trade and Industry) L IBR<br />
The Australian Diecasters Survey Mission found that a market in North<br />
America could be developed for castings produced in low to medium<br />
volume, particularly where expensive dies and subsequent machining<br />
were involved, Mr. J. McEwen, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for<br />
Trade and Industry, said today.<br />
Mr. McEwen, commenting on the report of the Diecasters' Survey<br />
Mission to the West Coast of North Americ said penetration of<br />
this more specialised market would not come overnight, but would<br />
require a sound, practical approach on the part of individual firms<br />
and the industry as a whole. A calculated approach to the market<br />
could prove most rewarding.<br />
There were opportunities in this field, notably in Los Angeles,<br />
Oakland and San Diego. However, there was no ready-made market for<br />
die-castings in high volume, which was the work the diecasters<br />
would prefer.<br />
Mr. McEwen said the Government lent support to the development of<br />
export trade through such avenues as export incentives, overseas<br />
promotions and the services of Trade Commissioners, but the prime<br />
responsibility for developing this market rested with the diecasters<br />
themselves. He said he was confident the industry would take full<br />
advantage of all opportunities in spite of increasing international<br />
competition which demanded greater devotion to management,<br />
engineering and marketing skills.<br />
The Diecasters Survey Mission comprised Mr. G. V. R3id, General<br />
Manager of Monier C. C. Die Castings Pty Ltd. ( Leader); Mr. R. Hay,<br />
Managing Director of Huckson Diecastings; Mr. F. Hook, Managing<br />
Director of F. Hook Pty Ltd. and Mr. P. Marcusson of the Department<br />
of Trade and Industry. The Mission visited the United States and<br />
Canadian West Coasts late last year to investigate and report on<br />
market possibilities for Australian diecastings.<br />
Mr. McEwen commended the Mission and expressed gratitude for the<br />
conscientious effort of each Mission member.<br />
