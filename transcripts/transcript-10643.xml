    <content><![CDATA[<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>With us in Canberra, Prime Minister, John Howard. Prime Minister,</p>
<p>   good morning to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning and first of all can I congratulate France on its</p>
<p>   magnificent World Cup win.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>You certainly can.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And that win is about as good as you can get in soccer.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>It is. You didn't get a win of that proportion in the Senate</p>
<p>   though at the weekend.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, would that if I could win by 3-0 in the Senate. No, I didn't.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>What do you do now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we put it back again because it's good policy. It's</p>
<p>   good policy because if we can sell the rest of Telstra we can start</p>
<p>   the 21st century virtually free of our national debt</p>
<p>   and we can also have some extra money to pay for some much needed</p>
<p>   additional communications services in rural Australia.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>There's a risk in putting it back, is there not, to the Senate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we have to try again and again with every piece of important</p>
<p>   legislation. We've had one hand tied behind our back through</p>
<p>   not having a majority in the Senate since the day we were elected</p>
<p>   and we are used to initial disappointment with legislation. We tried</p>
<p>   three times before we got Wik. We had months and months of negotiation</p>
<p>   on the Industrial Relations Bill. We've tried again and again</p>
<p>   in relation to other legislation, some of which we have got, some</p>
<p>   of which we haven't. And people must understand that this is</p>
<p>   one of the breaks on the Government they elected. But there's</p>
<p>   nothing we can do about it except cheerfully persevere, which we</p>
<p>   intend to do.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Are you surprised Senator Colston voted the legislation down?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I thought he might support us but he didn't tell us in advance</p>
<p>   he was going to do so and I can't suggest for a moment that</p>
<p>   he misled us. He kept his own counsel which he is entitled to do</p>
<p>   as an Independent Senator and I have watched the gyrations of the</p>
<p>   Senate for so long Steve that nothing entirely surprises me.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>We spoke to Senator Colston last night and asked him whether he</p>
<p>   might change his mind. Have a look at this, this was his response.</p>
<p>[Taped Interview]</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Well Prime Minister, do you think you can persuade him to change</p>
<p>   his mind or have you given up on him?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, we haven't given up, we'll keep trying. He said on</p>
<p>   Saturday evening that he at this stage wouldn't support it.</p>
<p>   We'll continue to address those concerns that he raised and</p>
<p>   keep trying but it's not new for us to be in this situation</p>
<p>   and we just don't intend to give up because this is a very</p>
<p>   good policy for Australia and that's why we are pursuing it.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Your alternative, of course, would be to go to the people at an</p>
<p>   election, at a time of your calling and say to them: well now, if</p>
<p>   you return us this is what we'll do, give us a mandate to do</p>
<p>   it or don't give us a mandate.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Steve, that is the case if the legislation is not passed before</p>
<p>   the election. And I want to make it clear that we will go to the</p>
<p>   next election seeking the support of the public for the sale of</p>
<p>   Telstra. It won't be the most important issue in the campaign,</p>
<p>   I think taxation will be. And if we win the election we will put</p>
<p>   the legislation back yet again and we'll ask the Senate to</p>
<p>   pass it on the basis of the mandate the public has given us. We</p>
<p>   don't intend to give up on this legislation because we want</p>
<p>   Australia to have a debt-free 21st Century and we want</p>
<p>   some additional funds to provide some improvements in telecommunications</p>
<p>   for the bush.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>And in the meantime those initiatives you have already announced,</p>
<p>   they're on the backburner?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well one of them is not on the backburner at all, that's the</p>
<p>   one about the new digital mobile phone service because that's</p>
<p>   being funded by Telstra. The other commitment in relation to untimed</p>
<p>   local calls is in no different position than our commitment before</p>
<p>   the last election to establish the Natural Heritage Trust out of</p>
<p>   the sale of one-third of Telstra. So this thing still has a long</p>
<p>   way to go. This was only round one. We're sorry we lost it</p>
<p>   but we're use to this with the Senate because we don't</p>
<p>   have the numbers.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>So Prime Minister, where does this leave your re-election plans</p>
<p>   and where does it leave the financing of the tax package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it hasn't made any difference to the re-election plan</p>
<p>   and it was always an error for people to believe that the sale of</p>
<p>   the rest of Telstra was fundamental to the tax package. I don't</p>
<p>   know where people got that idea from anymore than I know where,</p>
<p>   do I know where people got the idea that we had a $5 billion fund</p>
<p>   for the election campaign. I've never mentioned a figure of</p>
<p>   $5 billion.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>But do you agree, in terms of re-election plans, if you're</p>
<p>   going to put it back to the Senate there's no chance of an</p>
<p>   election before October.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Steve, I haven't made up my mind when the election is.</p>
<p>   Therefore the suggestion that Saturday night has altered our election</p>
<p>   plan, there's no election plan to alter. We'll go to the</p>
<p>   public at the right time. We don't have to go to the public</p>
<p>   until after next year, but it's open to go earlier. Obviously</p>
<p>   we'll release the tax package soon and that will of course</p>
<p>   become the focus of enormous debate.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>On the question of the tax package, are you weakening on the question</p>
<p>   of tax reform? I notice one suggestion for example in the Sydney</p>
<p>   Morning Herald implies you are, certainly as far as the rate of</p>
<p>   GST is concerned and the form.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know what rate I'm meant to be weakening</p>
<p>   from but I can tell you Steve......</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Well there's a suggestion you might be more inclined towards</p>
<p>   about 8.5%.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I have no intention whatever, of backing away from reforming</p>
<p>   the tax system because I believe in Australia's interests,</p>
<p>   for the good of Australia we need a fairer, and a better, and a</p>
<p>   new taxation system. Now the Labor Party will oppose it, just as</p>
<p>   they've been negative in the Senate, they'll be negative</p>
<p>   about tax. I want to be positive. I think the Australian public</p>
<p>   wants activity; it wants a bit of hope; it wants a road map for</p>
<p>   the future; and one of the areas where that's desperately needed</p>
<p>   is taxation reform. </p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Okay, but if your plan at the moment is to resubmit the Telstra</p>
<p>   legislation to the Senate and the Senate's not going to come</p>
<p>   back until late August, does that then mean you're going to</p>
<p>   delay releasing the detail in the tax reform package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Steve, what's happened in the Senate will make no material</p>
<p>   impact on the timing of the release of the tax package. I'm</p>
<p>   not saying what that is but I can....</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>John Fahey says it's imminent.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, well you can say imminent, quite soon, fairly soon, not too</p>
<p>   long. </p>
<p> LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Well you tell, when?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, because I haven't finally decided.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean what you do with something like this is you get it all completely</p>
<p>   in apple pie order, and we're quite close to that, and then</p>
<p>   you decide when you're going to release it. It won't be</p>
<p>   too long but I think people have wrongly reacted to the defeat of</p>
<p>   the legislation on Saturday night. A setback, a disappointment,</p>
<p>   but certainly not a disaster and something that we'll try again</p>
<p>   because it's good policy for Australia. That's why we're</p>
<p>   going to try again.</p>
<p> LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>And you've resumed talks with Senator Colsten?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Senator Alston will talk to him and I hope that he may</p>
<p>   be able to respond to his concerns.</p>
<p> LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Okay. Prime Minister thanks for your time. Good seeing you again.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a great pleasure.</p>
