PRIME MINISTER<br />
16 December 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
SPEECH AT THE LAUNCH OF THE FAMILY TAX INITIATIVE<br />
WENTWORTHVILLE, SYDNEY<br />
E Thank you very much Ross. To Mr Graham, the Mayor, to Peter Costello, Jocelyn Newman,<br />
Judi Moylan, Senator Rod Kemp, ladies and gentlemen. I am particularly delighted to be here<br />
in Ross Cameron's electorate. This is one of those areas of Sydney and one of those areas of<br />
Australia into which the Government successfulfly pushed on the second of March and it really<br />
is appropriate that Wentworthville here in the Parramatta electorate has been chosen to launch<br />
in a formal sense, although it's been launched in an absolute sense some time ago, the<br />
Government's family tax initiative.<br />
This represents the delivery in fiull, on time, without subtraction, without qualification of<br />
probably the centrepiece of the policies that we took to the last election and it is true that over<br />
a long period of time I have talked a lot about the importance of policy supporting the family.<br />
I regard them as very critical to the future society that I would like Australia to have. I want<br />
to in the period that we are in Government, I want us to leave a permanent mark on the<br />
Australian community, a mark that restores and strengthens the role of the family unit within<br />
our society, a strengthening within our society that gives to parents more choice. The key to<br />
our family tax initiative is that it recognises the additional costs of bringing up children and it<br />
also seeks to give to the parents of Australia's children a lot more choice as to how they order<br />
their lives. We as a Government don't seek to impose stereotypes on Australian parents. We<br />
don't seek to tell Australian parents that when their children are young, one parent should be<br />
permanently at home while one is in the workforce but we do want to give them increasingly<br />
the option to do that if that is their choice but whether or not they do it is a matter for the<br />
choice of individual parents.<br />
Equally we do not believe that governments should tell parents where they should send their<br />
children. We believe very strongly in a world class public education system. We also believe<br />
that increasingly, we ought to give to parents a greater variety of choice as to whether to<br />
educate their children in the public or the private system. If they decide to educate it in the<br />
public system, they ought to have even greater choice than they have at the present time. I<br />
speak as someone myself who spent all of my education years in the public education sector<br />
and I support it very strongly. But I also very strongly support the provision of choice and<br />
2630 </p>
<p>one of the other things that we have done since coming to power is that we have enabled<br />
people to have greater choice to send their children to low, fee paying independent schools<br />
and increasingly those schools will open up in the western suburbs of Sydney. I am very<br />
proud of the fact that as we approach Christmas I am able to look back on the nine months<br />
that we have been in Government and I am able to say that we have kept faith, we have<br />
remained true to the promises we made to the Australian people. We have stayed true to our<br />
promise to reform the industrial relations system. We have stayed true to our promise to sell<br />
one third of Telstra. We had a few heart flutters along the way. We finally got it through and<br />
we are very grateful for that, and most importantly of all, we have kept faith with and we have<br />
remained true to the promises that we made in relation to giving additional taxation assistance<br />
to families.<br />
I can remember about eight or nine years ago making a speech in which I said that a taxation<br />
system that doesn't recognise the cost of raising children, a taxation system that adopts an<br />
antiseptic, economic neutrality towards the cost of raising children is a taxation system<br />
without a social vision. And this family tax initiative which will deliver one billion dollars of<br />
tax concessions to people with children, it is carefully targeted to help low and middle income<br />
families. It helps sole parent families as well as helping two parent famidlies. We recognise the<br />
enormous struggle of many sole parents in our community and we applaud them for the<br />
contribution that they make single-handedly to raising their children and although all of us in<br />
an ideal world would like to see children raised by a mother and a father, we must always<br />
recognise the massive burden that is carried by sole parents when usually through no fault of<br />
their own and against their wishes... I have never met a sole parent yet who really in an ideal<br />
world would like to be a sole parent but it happens that way, but we're not into judgemental<br />
things. We are into espousing the cause of traditional family values and espousing the<br />
importance and the value if it's possible, the role model of having both a mother and a father<br />
but also recognising that in some cases, that's not possible and having a willingness to support<br />
those within our community who raise children on their own.<br />
So we have commnitted ourselves in so many areas of Government policy to supporting<br />
families. I have often said that apart from the emotional value that a family brings, apart from<br />
its capacity to inculcate values from one generation to the next. Apart from the male and<br />
female role models that it provides for young children, the family also happens to be the most<br />
efficient social welfare system that any nation has ever devised and a United, fully functioning<br />
famnily provides the most valuable social security safety net that mankind has yet devised. So<br />
for all of those reasons I am immensely proud of what the Government has done in this area<br />
and I am immensely proud that on time, to the very last dollar and cent, without any<br />
subtraction and without and qualification, we are delivering on the commnitment we made. We<br />
made that commitment, we carefully targeted it. We wanted it to be a symbol of our<br />
commitment to the role of the family in Australian society and it is but one example of the<br />
many ways in which you will find the Government that I lead, that I am very proud to lead,<br />
will always place the family at the centre of policy making considerations.<br />
We have had in mind the family in relation to some of the decisions that we have taken<br />
concerning some of the material that is to be found on television. We want to support parents<br />
in trying to provide good examples to their children, not making it difficult for them to do so.<br />
We want to promote a community which is less violent. Part of our family policy is to provide<br />
support through organisations that help parents who are struggling, often through a<br />
combination of their own circumstances, struggling with the responsibilities of parent hood.<br />
Child abuse is often the product, in fact, overwhelmingly is the product of inadequate<br />
parenting skills and one of the things that we're trying to do is to provide, and we have 2<br />
2631 </p>
<p>provided additional resources to some of the organisations in society that will encourage<br />
people to be better parents, and we are providing more resources to tackle domestic violence<br />
and we are also, through the action that we took in banning automatic and semi-automatic<br />
weapons within our community, we are building a safer society in which our children will<br />
grow up.<br />
So as I look back over the year, not in any sense of smugness or complacency, but I am very<br />
proud of the fact that the importance that we placed on the family within the Australian<br />
community during the election campaign and in the lead-up to the election campaign, that has<br />
been honoured. We have given families more choice. This tax initiative will give them more<br />
choice. It recognises the need of families who have young children the additional expenses of<br />
them and it also endorses the choice that ought to be available as to the childcare<br />
arrangements that people make. So I am very proud indeed that this initiative is being<br />
formally launched here in Wentworthville, here in the electorate of Parramatta, in the city of<br />
Parramatta, the centre of Sydney, the if you like a microcosm of middle Australia. You<br />
couldn't find an area anywhere in Australia, in suburban Australia that more closely reflects<br />
the diversity of our community, the importance of young families in our society, the ethnic<br />
varieties of our community. You couldn't find a better example.<br />
So ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly proud that it's being launched here today. I thank<br />
Ross Cameron for having us and I am delighted that all of my colleagues have been able to<br />
come here. I have brought along the man who has got all of the details of it,. I mean, it's not<br />
that I don't have the details but he has even more details than I do so I would now like to<br />
invite Peter Costello, the Treasurer of Australia, another person who is very strongly<br />
committed to family policy within our Government. I have invited him to say a few words<br />
about some of the details of the family tax initiative and I want to take this opportunity of<br />
thanking you all for coming. I hope all of you have a very happy and enjoyable Christmas with<br />
your families.<br />
Can I say one final thing on that, that most Australians will celebrate a plentiful, happy and<br />
secure Christmas. There will be many of our fellow Australians who won't and at a time such<br />
as Christmas, I ask all Australians who can afford to do so to dig very deeply into their<br />
pockets and contribute to those great organisations like the Smith Family and the Salvation<br />
Army and the St Vincent De Paul Society that care for the less fortunate in our community.<br />
We still have more than 700 000 people out of work. There are many people who won't have<br />
happy Christmases without the help of those organisations. It is our obligation I believe in the<br />
spirit of Christmas, the true spirit of Christmas, for those who can afford to do so to dig very<br />
deeply into their pockets and contribute to making a brighter and a happier Christmas for the<br />
less fortunate within our society.<br />
