FOR MEDIA 15 JANUARY 1991<br />
I was saddened to learn yesterday of the death of Gordon<br />
Bryant who preceded me as Member for Wills and who<br />
represented the electorate with distinction for twenty-five<br />
years, including a notable period as Minister for Aboriginal<br />
Affairs. His passionate support for Aboriginal rights was a<br />
mark of his character and will serve as a lasting reminder<br />
of his concern for less privileged Australians.<br />
I express my personal condolences to his wife, Pat, and his<br />
family. Gordon will be accorded a State funeral later this week and<br />
I will attend.<br />
