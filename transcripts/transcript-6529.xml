    <content><![CDATA[<p>EMBARGOED UNTIL 3 P. M. CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />GMI FIVE STAR DESIGN RATING LAUNCH<br />MELBOURNE, 29 OCT'OBER 1984<br />Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p><br />I have particular pleasure today in formally launching the Five Star Design Rating.</p>
<p><br />The Rating system must stand as one of the world's most<br />advanced design guide--for homes. Its award will be a<br />great incentive to builders and its presence a real<br />source of-reassurance for home buyers. We can be justifiably proud that it has been developed in<br />AustraliA. it is particularly fitting that the Five Star Design<br />Rating be launched at this time a time of great excitement in the houIsing indust ' ry in this country. No<br />other industry could reflect better the recovery that<br />has taken root in Australia over the past year. </p>
<p>Activity in the housing industry has rocketed out of the worst recession for twenty years in 1982-83 to a level which has been most satisfying to us all in 1984.<br />In April 1983, the Minister for Housing and<br />Construction, Chris Hurford, announced it was the<br />Government's objective to see the number of housing<br />commencements increase from the trough level of 105,000<br />in 1982-83 to an annual rate of 130,000 to 135,000 by<br />the second half of( K1983-84. In the event, there were<br />over 136,000 commencements in 1983-84 an increase of<br />over 30 per cent.</p>
<p><br />By the second half of that year, commencements were<br />growing at an annual rate of over 146,000 way above<br />target. It was even more pleasing that State figures on<br />housing commencements suggested the housing recovery was<br />strongest in those States where the recession hit<br />hardest in the previous year.</p>
<p>1984-85 will be another good year for the housing<br />industry. The latest forecast of the : ndicative<br />Planning Council is for around 345,000 commencements<br />representing about 95 per cent of the Th. dustry's<br />capacity. This is a decisive turnaround from the bad<br />times of unemployed builders and substantial unused<br />capacity in the industry such a short time ago.<br />As a result of the turnaround we have achieved in the<br />housing sector thousands of Australians have been able<br />to realise their dreams of home ownership. Great<br />numbers of others have found employment in the industry.<br />This magnificent recovery in the housing industry i. s a<br />direct consequence of the Australian Labor Government's<br />policies for economic recovery.<br />our prices and incomes policy, coupled with responsible<br />fiscal and monetary policy, has boosted confidence,<br />provided greater certainty to those contemplating major<br />purchases and enabled a cut in inflation and<br />inflationary expectations. This in turn, has~ permitted<br />significant cuts in most interest rates including a<br />fall of 1 per cent in mortgage rates over the life of<br />this Government.<br />This general policy approach has been complemented by a<br />number of initiatives tailored specific-ally to the needs<br />of the housing sector.<br />There has, for example, been the First Home Owners<br />Scheme a vitally important initiative in our overall<br />efforts to got the housing industry cn the move. The<br />scheme was designed especially to assist young first<br />home buyers bridge the deposit gap and meet repayments<br />in the first tough years of a home loan. Young people<br />are usually among the lowest income earners and least<br />wealthy in. the community and face an enormous hurdle in<br />buying their first home.<br />Since-its introduction in October 1983, the First Home<br />owners Scheme has been a widely acclaimed success. it<br />attracted no fewer~ than 90,000 applications in 1983-84<br />and over 55,000 first home buyers were assisted.<br />Expenditure on the scheme in 1983-84 was $ 141M, some 89<br />per cent more than originally budgeted.<br />Continuing recovery in the housing industry and the<br />continuing popularity of the scheme should see another<br />large increase in expenditure in 1984-85. In fact, we<br />estimate that spending on the First Home. Owners Scheme<br />will increase by almost 90 per ceht to $ 265M this year,<br />assisting a further 80,000 new applicants into their<br />first homes and providing ongoing repayment as~ istance<br />to last year's applicants.<br />WI . Af~ 7 6</p>
<p>In addition, Commonwealth contributions under the<br />Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement to publi:: housing<br />programs have increased massively in our first two<br />BUdgets. our first Budget lifted these contributions to<br />per cent above the level of Eunding provided by our<br />predecessors in 1982-83. This was followed by an<br />increase of almost 10 per cent in our 1984-85 Budget.<br />That our expenditure on public housing should have<br />increased so sharply at a time of overall fiscal<br />restraint reflects the depth of our concern for the<br />housing needs of disadvantaged people. Unlike our<br />predecessors we are not prepared to discount or ignore<br />those in need.<br />You would all appreciate that the housing recovery has<br />been an engine of growth in th&amp; Australian economy over<br />the past year. Private investment in dwellings leapt by<br />a massive 23 per cent over the course of 1983-84,<br />compared to growth of 10 per cent for the economy as a<br />whole. In the year to August 1984, total employment<br />grew by 3.5 per cent, while empl. oyment in the<br />construction industry grew by 9.1 per cent the highest<br />annual growth rate recorded for any of the major<br />industry groups.<br />Those who have recently found jcb's in the housing<br />industry will spend their incomes on a wide variety of<br />consumer goods in the many citiEs and country centres<br />sharing in the housing boom. The materials suppliers<br />bricks, mortar, timber, class, ceramics and so on have<br />also felt the strength of the upturn. The housing<br />recovery will also bring in its wake increased " big<br />ticket" consumption expenditures by new house owners<br />to properly furnish and equip the home.:<br />nd these separate " multiplier" effects go on, adding<br />up to a substantial boost to the economy generally<br />and the creation of many thousands of new jobs right<br />* across the board.<br />The housing recovegy confronts us directly with the need<br />for a more energy-conscious approach to dwelling<br />construction. In Australia, dwellings consume about 14<br />per cent of all energy used in the community. With the<br />relative cost of energy subject to unpredictable<br />increases, there are therefore great benefits to the<br />community if alternatives can be found which result in<br />less energy being consumed in housing and other energyintensive<br />areas.<br />For example, it is obvious that the design and<br />construction of houses should-be related to, and take<br />account of, local climatic conditions. Yet climatic<br />requirements often seem to be overlooked by designers<br />or the solutions which designers choose have little<br />appeal to those who will have to live in the dwelling.<br />flr.~ y. vr. 77, Th7',. -' t'cr r. t.

<p>The housing indi'stry faces a challenge to provide<br />economic, low energy homes having high standards of<br />environmental comfort and amenity. The~ e homes,<br />however, should still retain the quality, and variety of<br />dwellings for which Australian housing is known. The<br />five star design rating will encourage builders to meet<br />this challenge.<br />It is against this background of strong support for<br />energy conservation, and for its reflection in<br />Australian housing design standards, that the Government<br />welcomes new initiatives of the kind we see in the<br />manual on the design and construction of energy<br />efficient homes being prepared by the CMI Council.<br />Today, I have much pleasure in releasing the first<br />sections of the manual, which are directed specifically<br />towards the building industry.<br />I also have another pleasant task to perform. As a<br />token of the appreciation of the Gi'liI Council for the<br />work in developing the Five Star DZ sign Rating, I have<br />pleasure in presenting a letter of appreciation from the<br />Chairman and Directors of the Council to just five of<br />the many who have worked towards the success of this<br />project: They are-Dr Angelo Delsante of CSIRO Divison<br />of Building Research<br />Associate Professor John Ballinger<br />of the Solar Architecture Unit at the<br />University of New South Wales<br />Mr George Millar of Glernville Homes<br />Mr Digby Forbes of Australian Building<br />Systems Appraisal Council<br />Dr Lex Blackey of CSIRO Division of<br />Building Research<br />Congratulations to all of you for your-contribution to<br />this project.</p>
