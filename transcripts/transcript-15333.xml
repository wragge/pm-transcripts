<p>Implementing the Federal Government's plan to stamp out sexual and other abuse of defenceless Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory will take time, but the Government has already started.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Minister Mal Brough met Commonwealth officials to map out the first stage of the intervention.</p>
<p>The top priority is the restoration of law and order.  The communities concerned must be stabilised and given a breathing space.  Additional police will be on the ground within 10 days.</p>
<p>I welcome the promise from both New South Wales and Victoria of more police; the other states should follow suit.  Giving the women and children of these remote Northern Territory communities a greater sense of physical security is essential before our initiatives in health and education can be implemented.</p>
<p>Mr Brough is assembling a talented taskforce to oversee the Government's plan.  Already included are Doctor Sue Gordon, a magistrate from Western Australian and chairman of the National Indigenous Committee.</p>
<p>Shane Castles who led the AFP operation in the Solomon Islands and Doctor Bill Glasson, a former federal president of the Australian Medical Association have also agreed to join the taskforce.</p>
<p>This is most encouraging.  Equally heartening has been the spontaneous response of the general public.  There have been numerous offers of help right across the spectrum of Australian society.</p>
<p>Throughout our nation there is a genuine desire to make sure that we respond effectively to this national emergency.  Our obligation to the vulnerable children of the Northern Territory is absolute.  We must not let them down.</p>
