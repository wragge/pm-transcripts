FOR PRESS FINAL STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE RT. HON. SIR ROBERT MENZIES, ON<br />
THE SENATE ELECTION<br />
If Mr. Caiwell were Prime Minister, would he be<br />
prepared to accept the professional advice of his Chiefs of<br />
' taff? He has made it clear during the past few weeks that<br />
he considers it most improper to reject such advice as he<br />
so w-rongly alleged that I did. Jdhat then would he do, having<br />
sought and received the same advice as dia my Government?<br />
Where would he be on a measure of compulsion in providing the<br />
numbers needed by the Army?<br />
This simple question remains unanswered though the<br />
very decision it demands has become the most debated and<br />
discussed issue of the Senate election for which voting, on<br />
Saturday, is compulsory.<br />
SIt is one of three related issues which have proved<br />
to be of outstanding importance, concerning foreign policy and<br />
defence and the position of the Senate in relation to both.<br />
You know that the Labour Party normally does not<br />
believe in the Senate. It wants it abolished. Now, however,<br />
it asks you to give Labour control of the Senate for the express<br />
purpose of crippling the Government ( which you elected so<br />
recently) controlling its legislation and interfering with its<br />
administration, All this is at a time when any reasonable person<br />
must admit that we have real dangers to our north and that we<br />
need strength and certainty in our own plans and in our relations<br />
with those great nations who are our allies, and in some<br />
eventualities, our partners in defence,<br />
We believe that the essential requirement of a<br />
defence policy is that we keep the prospective enemy as far<br />
away from our own soil as possible. So, we have done two things.<br />
We have made treaties, ANZUS and SEATO and we have pleged our.<br />
support to our sister Commonwealth country Malaysia in her<br />
defence against armed attacks. Broadly we have planned for<br />
defence in depth, with highly mobile ana modern forces of all<br />
arms capable of effective use, preferably outside Australia, to<br />
keep any enemy away.<br />
It is a defence conception fully shared by our<br />
allies, but completely rejected by the Left-Wing of the Labour<br />
Party at Canberra which, make no mistake will be considerably<br />
strengthened in numbers and authority within the Labour Party,<br />
should Labour gain control of the Senate.<br />
Our proposal for the rapid increase in the strength<br />
of the Australian Regular Army from 22,750 to 37,500 has among<br />
other things, been recommended by our highest military a dvisors and<br />
has been accepted by us. e . o/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Again, on the specific advice of the chiefs of Staff<br />
Committee we have decided on a limited selective call-up of<br />
4+, 200 next year and 6,900 in each of the two following years.<br />
Voluntary recruiting will, of course, go on and will be<br />
encouraged in every way. Alone, it simply cannot produce the<br />
numbers we need in the time we need them.<br />
Of the 100,000 or so men who turn twenty each year,<br />
some will be deferred for a variety of reasons and the<br />
relatively small number required will be chosen by a process<br />
of ballot, Mr. Calwell describes this as a sort of lottery. But<br />
how does he think they should be chosen? By selection, or by<br />
political influonce?<br />
All military W ovision must have relation to our<br />
military obligations and duties. Today, and completely apart<br />
fr-om limited local defence, AustralI. ia has obligations under<br />
SEATO and has troops on the Thailand frontier and in South<br />
Vietnam. We have forces of all services in and around New<br />
Guinea. All of these current obligations make it necessary<br />
that we should have adequate numbers and first-class equipment<br />
and training and means of trransportation.<br />
And, since our opponents control the time-table, as do<br />
all aggressors, we have no time to lose,<br />
That is why we stand where we do.<br />
