    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>This morning it's my pleasure to welcome the Prime Minister</p>
<p>   who joins us from the ABC's Melbourne studios and he has agreed</p>
<p>   to take your calls as well. Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Carolyn.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you believe Queensland would be better served being governed</p>
<p>   by an alliance between the Coalition, One Nation and two Independents,</p>
<p>   or Labor and a couple of Independents?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I am not going to buy into that. Obviously I wanted a clean,</p>
<p>   outright Coalition Government. I wanted a coalition of the National</p>
<p>   Party and the Liberal Party because I believe Rob Borbidge has been</p>
<p>   a very good Premier but I'll leave that to the Queensland commentators.</p>
<p>   That's a matter for the Premier to speak of, I don't want</p>
<p>   to buy into that. Let me simply say that the best outcome from last</p>
<p>   Saturday would have been an outright result in favour of the Coalition.</p>
<p>   Now that clearly is not the case. The question of what ultimately</p>
<p>   unfolds is entirely a matter for the voters of Queensland and the</p>
<p>   leaders of the Queensland political parties. My attention now, quite</p>
<p>   naturally, is very much on the Federal scene and particularly addressing</p>
<p>   the concerns of the voters of Queensland in the context of that</p>
<p>   Federal election campaign, whenever it may be.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How can you effectively discredit the policies of One Nation though</p>
<p>   if the Queensland branch of the Party is teaming up with them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, very easily discredit their policies where they are wrong,</p>
<p>   and the latest manifestation of where their policies are wrong,</p>
<p>   and let me say that I do understand in these times of economic and</p>
<p>   social change why some people might be attracted to a party that</p>
<p>   is offering apparently easy, simple solutions. I understand that</p>
<p>   and I want the people of Queensland who supported the One Nation</p>
<p>   Party last weekend to know that I understand the sense of vulnerability</p>
<p>   and disappointment that some of them feel. I am taking account of</p>
<p>   that, I always have tried to take account of that but in the process</p>
<p>   of talking to those people who are decent ordinary Australians who</p>
<p>   are concerned about their future, I will point out where I believe</p>
<p>   the policies of One Nation will hurt them a lot more than they think</p>
<p>   the policies of my Government may have hurt them. And one example</p>
<p>   of that, of course, is this idea that you can print money in order</p>
<p>   to fund two per cent bank loans. That has to be one of the most</p>
<p>   misguided economic statements that I have heard in the 24 years</p>
<p>   that I have been in politics. I think the last person who suggested</p>
<p>   that was Jim Cairns who was a Labor Treasurer - a Labor Treasurer</p>
<p>   - I point out, and he, I think, has a rare distinction of being</p>
<p>   the only Treasurer in the history of Australia never to bring down</p>
<p>   a Federal Budget. I mean the very idea that you would print money</p>
<p>   ought to send a shiver down the spine of every retired Australian</p>
<p>   because high inflation would result from printing money and that</p>
<p>   will destroy the savings. And it is interesting that a constituency</p>
<p>   that One Nation is trying to appeal to is the elderly, and I say</p>
<p>   to those people if you value your savings, don't listen to</p>
<p>   policies that talk about printing money because printing money will</p>
<p>   erode the value of your hard earned savings.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There is considerable infighting among the Queensland Liberals</p>
<p>   though about the preference decision with calls to expel some members</p>
<p>   who said publicly that it was a grave mistake and the decision went</p>
<p>   all One Nation's way, there was no benefit that could be found</p>
<p>   for the Liberals. Will you now make an unequivocal decision about</p>
<p>   the allocation of preferences and put One Nation last?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's not in my power to make an unequivocal decision, I don't</p>
<p>   control that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You surely have some influence?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The best way to exert influence on these organisational matters</p>
<p>   in the Liberal Party is to privately talk to people. Let me say</p>
<p>   this, that in these areas the organisation of the Liberal Party</p>
<p>   makes the decision and calls the shots, I've always accepted</p>
<p>   that. They decide who the candidates are and they decide preference</p>
<p>   issues and they get out of the way and leave it to us to decide</p>
<p>   policy. That's where we are different from the Labor Party.</p>
<p>   The Labor Party organisation has a much greater influence on policy.</p>
<p>   In our party, the Parliamentary party controls the policy and the</p>
<p>   organisation controls the candidates and pre-selections and things</p>
<p>   like that. Now, it'll be decided around Australia on a division</p>
<p>   by division basis. I know that some divisions have already said</p>
<p>   they'll put One Nation last, others will make up their mind</p>
<p>   over the weeks and months ahead. It will be a matter for each individual</p>
<p>   division. But as far as the Queensland Liberal Party is concerned,</p>
<p>   it's a very important part of the Federal structure of the</p>
<p>   Liberal Party. There are a lot of Liberal Party seats in Queensland</p>
<p>   which we hold, we won a record number. A magnificently high number</p>
<p>   in the last Federal election and I want to hold onto every one of</p>
<p>   them. And naturally we need a united, combined effort from all members</p>
<p>   of the Liberal Party in Queensland to do that and whatever differences</p>
<p>   may have existed in the past about tactics and so forth, those differences</p>
<p>   ought to be set aside because the goal ahead of the Queensland Liberal</p>
<p>   Party now is to make sure we hold onto every one of those seats</p>
<p>   we won from Labor in March of 1996 and we do that by focussing on</p>
<p>   the positives of what my Government has done and pointing out that</p>
<p>   whenever the election is held there will be a very simple choice.</p>
<p>   We have an area of great economic turmoil in Asia and against that</p>
<p>   background my Government has given the country the strongest economic</p>
<p>   foundations for 25 years. And we either hang onto those foundations</p>
<p>   that have given us security, stability and safety. And what are</p>
<p>   the alternatives to hanging onto those? You either go back to the</p>
<p>   failed deficit debt policies of the Labor Party that left us weak</p>
<p>   and vulnerable, or do you experiment with these ideas that suggest</p>
<p>   that you can solve problems by such erroneous ideas as printing</p>
<p>   money, that would be a dangerous experiment with the stability of</p>
<p>   our economic future. So there is going to be a pretty clear choice</p>
<p>   and my message to Liberals in Queensland is : let us focus on exposing</p>
<p>   the clarity of that choice. Let us focus on pointing out to Queensland</p>
<p>   voters that you either stick to the stability and the security and</p>
<p>   the safety of what we are offering or you go back to Labor's</p>
<p>   failed deficit debt policies or you embrace a dangerous experiment</p>
<p>   which would undermine the savings of the people. Now I think if</p>
<p>   it is explained in that way there is a very clear choice.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, isn't' that one of the main problems</p>
<p>   that we keep hearing about the strong foundations of the economy</p>
<p>   and how well things are going and yet people have been tightening</p>
<p>   their belts and tightening their belts and not feeling any of those</p>
<p>   benefits and they just don't believe you any more?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well when you talk about strong foundations you talk about a structure</p>
<p>   that can withstand a storm. If I can just use the analogy of a house</p>
<p>   and the Australian economy is built on strong foundations and there's</p>
<p>   been a squall, a very very heavy storm, people might even say a</p>
<p>   hurricane from Asia. And whilst it's kept us indoors, we have</p>
<p>   not been able to do as much we would have liked to have done, the</p>
<p>   house has stood up against that storm, that hurricane, and it's</p>
<p>   still there. And when it abates we will be able to go about our</p>
<p>   lives in the normal way. Now if we hadn't have had strong foundations</p>
<p>   the house in fact would have been blown over. And I think it is</p>
<p>   very important that we understand that if we hadn't reduced</p>
<p>   the deficit, if we hadn't gotten rid of Mr Beazley's $10.5</p>
<p>   billion deficit, if we hadn't have delivered the lowest interest</p>
<p>   rates for 30 years, if we hadn't have delivered the lowest</p>
<p>   inflation rate in the OECD area, the damage from Asia would have</p>
<p>   been much greater. Although some of the comments from the World</p>
<p>   Bank have been exaggerated in the past couple of days, the Asian</p>
<p>   economic downturn has been very severe and if our economy had been</p>
<p>   weaker, if we hadn't have gotten rid of Mr Beazley's deficit</p>
<p>   and tackled the problems we inherited, a lot more damage would have</p>
<p>   been done to the Australian economy. Now, I know a lot of people</p>
<p>   say well all you're talking about in effect, protecting us</p>
<p>   against things having been worse. Well that is partly true but that's</p>
<p>   very important because if anybody thinks that it couldn't have</p>
<p>   been any worse they're completely wrong. If our economy had</p>
<p>   not been strengthened by us the Asian economic downturn would have</p>
<p>   done horrendous damage. There would have been higher unemployment</p>
<p>   and savings would have been attacked and we would now be as a nation</p>
<p>   lamenting the fact that we hadn't taken the measures that my</p>
<p>   Government undertook two-and-a-quarter years ago.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Right. You've agreed to take calls, very kindly. 1300360612</p>
<p>   is our number if you'd like to put a question to the Prime</p>
<p>   Minister this morning. I don't want to hog up all the time</p>
<p>   but I would like to slip one more question ion before we go to the</p>
<p>   calls. Would you prefer to look across the Chamber and see Labor</p>
<p>   MPs or One Nation MPs?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'd prefer to look behind me and see a sea of Liberal and</p>
<p>   National Party faces. </p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>That doesn't really answer the question though, with all respect.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think with great respect, it's a sort of an irrelevant</p>
<p>   question. Politics is about going to the people with positive ideas</p>
<p>   and winning the majority of seats and frankly my business is to</p>
<p>   get Liberals and Nationals elected. I think the idea that a Prime</p>
<p>   Minister and a political leader should see politics in terms of</p>
<p>   keeping others out as distinct from getting himself in, is negative,</p>
<p>   and that is why I think it's irrelevant question. My goal in</p>
<p>   life is to get Liberals and National Party members elected to the</p>
<p>   national Parliament. My goal is to explain to tho people of Queensland</p>
<p>   and to the people of Australia that in these challenging times the</p>
<p>   real safety and security and stability is to be found in supporting</p>
<p>   the Coalition. Not in going back to failure or risking dangerous</p>
<p>   experiments.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>All right. Let's take some calls now. James, you're first</p>
<p>   on the line this morning. Good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Carolyn, good morning Mr Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning James.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>My question is, is there any compensation or any likelihood of</p>
<p>   a tax exemption for the general public in your tax package.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A tax exemption for the general public?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>That's right, a tax amnesty.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, from time to time the Taxation Office makes decisions in</p>
<p>   relation to individual tax payers but we don't have in contemplation</p>
<p>   as a Government, a tax amnesty. What we have in contemplation is</p>
<p>   a reformed tax system which makes the whole thing fairer and we</p>
<p>   certainly won't be increasing taxation. One of the promises</p>
<p>   I made when I announced tax reform was that we would ensure that</p>
<p>   the overall tax burden did not increase. But we do need a fairer</p>
<p>   a system and we do need one that takes the load off the backs of</p>
<p>   our export industry and that's why we're looking at replacing</p>
<p>   existing inefficient indirect taxes with a broad based indirect</p>
<p>   tax or a goods and services tax. And also introducing significant</p>
<p>   reductions in personal income tax. It will be a package, and it</p>
<p>   will be fairer and it will be better and the public will like it.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Annette, good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Carolyn. Prime Minister, we have maintained private</p>
<p>   health insurance over the whole of our lives but it's becoming</p>
<p>   more and more increasingly difficult. We received our tax certificate</p>
<p>   yesterday saying that we are entitled to the full $450 claim on</p>
<p>   our tax but at the same time our premium has risen from $195 to</p>
<p>   $216 for a four week period. Now you know, those increases are absolutely</p>
<p>   outrageous and it's no wonder that fund membership is dropping</p>
<p>   at an alarming rate. What on Earth can be done to stem the tide.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Annette, I understand your frustration about that. I'm</p>
<p>   glad you acknowledge that as a result of my Government coming in,</p>
<p>   your premium is $450 a year cheaper because of your family's</p>
<p>   entitlement to the taxation rebate. Health and private health insurance</p>
<p>   as part of that is one of those areas that's always under examination</p>
<p>   by the Government. We remain very strongly committed to private</p>
<p>   health insurance. I personally, like yourself, have had personal</p>
<p>   health insurance for myself and my family all of my life and I'll</p>
<p>   always keep it because I think it's a very valuable insurance.</p>
<p>   But I do understand that it's become a more expensive product</p>
<p>   and I do understand that it's a bit of a vicious circle. Premiums</p>
<p>   go up which forces more people out which in turn pushes premiums</p>
<p>   up further and fewer people in the younger age bracket are in, and</p>
<p>   proportionally more people in the older age bracket who are the</p>
<p>   greater claim on private health insurance are members. So, I understand</p>
<p>   it. Can I say Annette that the concern you expressed is a very common</p>
<p>   concern and Governments do listen to those expressions of concern</p>
<p>   and it's an area that remains under very constant review. I</p>
<p>   think that's all I can say at the moment.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Thanks Annette. Helen, good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Carolyn, good morning Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I'm a Liberal voting self-funded retiree. My late husband</p>
<p>   retired 35 years ago and we saved all our working days for our retirement.</p>
<p>   With regard to the GST, no one has a clue as to how much wholesales</p>
<p>   tax is levied at what rate, and on what articles. Could the Government</p>
<p>   make it abundantly clear for the general public to comprehend how</p>
<p>   the GST will effect us. Might I suggest a comprehensive A-Z list</p>
<p>   of all articles that attract tax and the rates being mailed to every</p>
<p>   tax payer. I feel sure, if we the tax payers had this information,</p>
<p>   the Government would have an easier time with the tax change. What</p>
<p>   do you think Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I agree with you and I can assure you that that information</p>
<p>   will be made available. I read in the paper this morning, so it</p>
<p>   must be right, that the Business Coalition is going to run an advertising</p>
<p>   campaign starting either next Sunday or Monday, pointing out the</p>
<p>   cost of the wholesale sales tax on everyday items and the fact that</p>
<p>   for example if you buy caviar, which not many of us do, you don't</p>
<p>   pay any wholesale sales tax, but if you eat certain biscuits which</p>
<p>   most of our children do, you pay 12%. But on things like toothbrushes</p>
<p>   or toothpaste which you pay sales tax, and there are many household</p>
<p>   items where you pay very high levels of tax. An example I often</p>
<p>   use is that if you are wealthy enough to buy a Lear Jet, you don't</p>
<p>   pay any wholesale sales tax, but like the rest of it, if you buy</p>
<p>   a family car, you pay 22%. Now, all of that will be pointed out</p>
<p>   in great detail and I'll be very disappointed if after this</p>
<p>   whole exercise is completed that the great bulk of Australians aren't</p>
<p>   experts on the inequities and the anomalies of the existing wholesale</p>
<p>   tax system, and can I also say to you as a self-funded retiree,</p>
<p>   that we certainly haven't forgotten that group of Australians</p>
<p>   and one of the really good things in the last budget was an announcement</p>
<p>   that we were going to extend the Seniors' Card to self-funded</p>
<p>   retirees, with effect from the first of January next year, in a</p>
<p>   way that I think it will reach something like 90%-95% of all self-funded</p>
<p>   retirees in Australia and that's on top of course of the extension</p>
<p>   of the taxation rebate so that people at the same level of income</p>
<p>   as self-funded retirees are treated the same as pensioners. But</p>
<p>   I am very much aware of the need to explain those wholesale sales</p>
<p>   tax anomalies and I can promise you that there'll be a lot</p>
<p>   of information pouring out on that subject over the weeks and months</p>
<p>   ahead.</p>
<p> TUCKER:</p>
<p>Will you be looking at further compensation for self-funded</p>
<p>   retirees, Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Not just self-funded retirees Carolyn. One of the five principles</p>
<p>   I laid down last year that there should be adequate compensation</p>
<p>   for those who needed it. I want to assure people on fixed incomes,</p>
<p>   I want to assure people on benefits, people who need the help of</p>
<p>   the safety net, that they will not be disadvantaged by our taxation</p>
<p>   package. Now, they will see the detail when it comes out and that</p>
<p>   won't be too long into the future. I'm not going to say</p>
<p>   exactly when, but we have made a lot of progress with the package</p>
<p>   and there will be plenty of time to look at it and examine it and</p>
<p>   to see the benefits of it and also to see the protection. In the</p>
<p>   long run, the purpose of tax reform is to strengthen the economy</p>
<p>   and in the process of doing that, we must protect people on fixed</p>
<p>   incomes. Their savings are important, that's why they shouldn't</p>
<p>   play around with experimental economics and I think it is very very</p>
<p>   important that people understand that will be a lot of compensation</p>
<p>   for people who need protection in this tax package.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Fred, good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hello Fred.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I'd just like to ask one question. In relation to the double</p>
<p>   dissolution, you have three triggers for a double dissolution, is</p>
<p>   that correct?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's correct.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Why is everybody concentrating on Wik when the other two are just</p>
<p>   as important as Wik?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, perhaps you should ask those who are focussing on it. It's</p>
<p>   just that Wik has had more publicity. The other two relate to reforms</p>
<p>   to the Public Service, and also Unfair Dismissal changes that will</p>
<p>   help small business, and that is of particular benefit to Queensland,</p>
<p>   and because there's a very high proportion of small business</p>
<p>   men and women in Queensland, but those other two measures are very</p>
<p>   important, I agree with you. We've just got all the publicity</p>
<p>   because there's been a huge debate about Native Title for a</p>
<p>   long time and it is important, particularly for Queensland that</p>
<p>   we get this issue resolved. Now, it is not my fault that it is still</p>
<p>   unresolved. I worked for months and months and months to get a compromise</p>
<p>   that was fair to everybody and gave everybody a decent run, and</p>
<p>   now I'm being asked to compromise even further. Well, I'm</p>
<p>   not going to sell out the interests of the farmers of Queensland</p>
<p>   or indeed anywhere in Australia and therefore I'm asking the</p>
<p>   Labor Party and the Democrats and others in the Senate to pass the</p>
<p>   bill and indeed to pass the other two bills. And if people don't</p>
<p>   want a double dissolution, well they should be putting pressure</p>
<p>   on the Democrats and the Labor Party and Senator Harradine to pass</p>
<p>   our fair, balanced, Native Title Bill. It's not, in a sense,</p>
<p>   our fault or our responsibility. Those who have blocked the legislation</p>
<p>   of the Government with a 44 seat majority in the House of Representatives</p>
<p>   carry the responsibility for the delay and the frustration.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Do you see it as a powerful weapon to be taking to the election</p>
<p>   as Rob Borbidge has described it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm certain that in States like Queensland and Western Australia</p>
<p>   there is a very strong level of support for what we're proposing.</p>
<p>   I don't see it Caroline, as a weapon, I see it as necessary</p>
<p>   for Australia's future, because a lot of investment is hanging</p>
<p>   on clearing up confusion about Native Title. I don't see these</p>
<p>   things as weapons or tactics or strategies, I see them as beneficial</p>
<p>   to Australia. We can't go on with the uncertainty surrounding</p>
<p>   Native Title, and we didn't create it. It was created by the</p>
<p>   legislation of the former Government and we are now trying to respond</p>
<p>   to it. And we said before the last election that we would remove</p>
<p>   the uncertainty surrounding Native Title and that's what we</p>
<p>   went to the people on and that's what they voted for, but the</p>
<p>   Senate won't pass our amendments. So, what are we to do but</p>
<p>   to contemplate in those circumstances, if we want the changes made,</p>
<p>   what are we to do other than to contemplate a double dissolution?</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>We are fast running out of time and I do want to sneak one more</p>
<p>   question in before the news. I apologise to those people we didn't</p>
<p>   get to, we're just going to have to get you back, Mr Howard.</p>
<p>   Many people believe the State election was a dress rehearsal for</p>
<p>   the federal election. If that's the case, how are you going</p>
<p>   to sell the GST when every other political party is against it,</p>
<p>   it would seem, and if you are standing firm on that, are you worried</p>
<p>   it is going to appear to be intransigence instead of choosing the</p>
<p>   best option for the country?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I never regard individual State elections as dress rehearsals for</p>
<p>   federal elections. I think there are differences and there are different</p>
<p>   issues. I won't be selling a GST. It's a mistake to suggest</p>
