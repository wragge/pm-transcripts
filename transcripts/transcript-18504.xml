Prime Minister Julia Gillard today welcomed the commitment of First Ministers to the principles that will guide the design of a National Disability Insurance Scheme.</p>
<p>We want to end the cruel lottery that currently exists where the services and support people with disabilities and their carers receive depend on where they live, what disability they have and how they got that disability.</p>
<p>That is why the Gillard Government has committed to laying the foundations for the launch of a National Disability Insurance Scheme which would give people with disabilities and their carers greater control and choice over services and supports.</p>
<p>The principles, released today by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG), recognise the shared responsibility to building a National Disability Insurance Scheme by all Governments.</p>
<p>The First Ministers agreed that a National Disability Insurance Scheme must fundamentally change the way disability care and support is delivered in Australia using an insurance approach.</p>
<p>A National Disability Insurance Scheme will take into account the cost of care over the lifetime of an individual and focus on increasing opportunities for people with disability and their carers.</p>
<p>First Ministers also considered a progress report from the Select Council of Disability Ministers and Treasurers, which is leading work to design a National Disability Insurance Scheme.</p>
<p>This report sets out a work plan to progress work on the design of the launch of a scheme; and to consider critical questions of funding, governance and eligibility for a full scheme as a priority.</p>
<p>It reflects the existing agreement of the Commonwealth and states and territories to lay the foundations for a National Disability Insurance Scheme by 2013, a year ahead of the timetable set out by the Productivity Commission. </p>
