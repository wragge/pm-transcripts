STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HONPJ KEATING, MP<br />
VISIT TO AUSTRALIA BY US PRESIDENTIAL REPRESENTATIVE<br />
I am pleased to announce that the US Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff,<br />
Admiral David E Jeremiah, will visit Australia In May as a guest of the<br />
Australian Government. Admiral Jeremiah will be the personal representative<br />
of President Clinton during the Australia-Arnedca Friendship Week and the<br />
51 st Anniversary of the battle of the Coral Sea.<br />
Admiral Jeremiah will participate in various commemorative activities In<br />
Canberra, Sydney, Adelaide and Perth and will also meet senior members of<br />
the Government to discuss Australia-US relations.<br />
Also visiting Australia to participate in events In other parts of the country will<br />
be Vice Admiral Wright, Commander 7th Fleet, Major General Redden,<br />
Director of Plans, Pacific Air Forces; and Brigadier General Smith,<br />
Commanding General of Marine Corps Barracks Camp Butler, Japan.<br />
Fought in May 1942, the Battle of the Coral Sea was the turning point of the<br />
war in the South Pacific and laid the foundations for the Australia-US alliance.<br />
Over fitty years later, this friendship endures, based on the same liberal<br />
democratic values that are so dear to us, The visit by Admiral Jeremiah will<br />
further strengthen the strong ties of friendship which link our countries.<br />
