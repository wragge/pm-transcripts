PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 3 DECEMBER 1974<br />
Gentlemen, are there any questions?<br />
QUESTION: Will the Federal G rnment appeal against the decision<br />
on Public Service wage increa-e by Mr Taylor?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The decision of Mr Taylor is under consideration.<br />
That is all I can say at this stage.<br />
QUESTION: By Cabinet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It is under consideration.<br />
QUESTION: What percentage would you regard in the Queensland<br />
elections as the cut-off point which you consider Labor to be<br />
holding ground or gaining ground or losing ground?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have got nothing to say on that.<br />
QUESTION: Under what circumstances would the next elections<br />
come for the Ministry? Do you have any plans for something<br />
preceding the Senate half term might that be the occasion,<br />
or do you not su~ e this happening until the next house election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The normal time is after there is another<br />
election for the House of Representatives.<br />
QUESTION: Do you see nothing coming ahead of that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I know of no steps.<br />
QUESTION: Last week Dr Cairns said that he believed the Government's<br />
first and most important job now must be to look at a possible<br />
reduction in the level of indirect taxes. Do you share the<br />
Deputy Prime Minister's view that the economy needs further<br />
stimulus and, in particular, do-you think that indirect taxes<br />
should have top priority in this area?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't believe Dr Cairns'said that indirect taxes<br />
would have top priority. I certainly don't believe that they<br />
should. To reduce the Consumer Price Index by one percentage<br />
point would require -a reduction in indirect taxation, Federal<br />
and State, averaged over Australia equally of $ 400 million.<br />
I believe there are very much more effective ways of coping with<br />
the twin problems of inflation and unemployment than by reducing<br />
indirect tax. The form of indirect tax which would produce<br />
the biggest puc-duction in the Consumer Price Index would be in<br />
respect of liquor which is both State and Federal and tobacco<br />
which is Federal and also in some States a State tax as well.<br />
I don't really believe that it is socially or economically necessary<br />
to promote the consumption of liquor and tobacco.<br />
QUESTION Last week the House of Representatives voted to defer<br />
consideration of-the Family Law Bill until next February and a<br />
number' of Labor Party members voted this way in the House.... </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: And a great number were absent.<br />
QUESTION:* And a great number were absent. But, taking account<br />
of the number who voted the way they did, does this now suggest<br />
that perhaps the Labor Party is as conservative a force as the<br />
Opposition parties in the Senate which were able to put the<br />
bill through there?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe that a majority of the members of the<br />
Labor Party in the House of Representatives a considerable<br />
majority of the members of the Labor Party in the House of<br />
Representatives will support this admirable bill.<br />
QUESTION: Do you believe there is enough members of the House<br />
of Representatives will support it to get the bill through in<br />
its present form?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I certainly hope so. But every member of all<br />
three parties in the House of Representatives is, I believe,<br />
free to vote as he sees fit on this bill. That is the case with<br />
the Australian Labor Party, I believe it is the case with the<br />
Liberal Party and the Country Party or the National Party or<br />
whatever it is called. I would hope that a majority of members<br />
of all parties would support this bill.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, are you satisfied that you have<br />
the departmental resources to back up your statedi attempt to<br />
inrolve yourself more in economic decision-making? If not, what<br />
plans do you have to change the structure of your department<br />
to help you play that role more effectively?<br />
PRIME Mi. rSTER: The structure of any department is not-the<br />
responsibii'y of the Minister, it is the responsibility of<br />
the Permanent Head. The Minister can make recommendations to<br />
the Cabinet concerning the appointment of Permanent HeaO<br />
when positions of Permanent Heads are vacant but the Minister<br />
does not decide thc-structure of any dcpartinent and that applies<br />
to the Prime M4ini~ t, L wi -h teo~ ~ his department top.<br />
QUL TTC1N: Can you expand on whether your Permanent Head has any<br />
plans Ind has he discussed them with you?<br />
PRIME Jy1.1.__ TER: No I can't expand on that.<br />
QUESTION: Do you know of any plans or would you ny plans<br />
to try and recommit that dlecision of last Thursday to d&amp; fer the<br />
consideration of the Family Law Bill to next year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I know of no plan. Do any of you? Let me know<br />
if you do.<br />
QUESTION: Would you support any moves to recommit that decision?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If a vote came to recommit that decision I would<br />
support it. But I-don't know of any moves to do so.<br />
QUESTION: Do you expect the Foreign Affairs and Defence<br />
Committee to report on the Omega base before the Federal Conference? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know.<br />
QUESTION: What will happen<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know.<br />
QUESTION: What would happen if you don't get the report before<br />
the Federal Conference then in view of the big row at the last<br />
Conference on this issue?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There wasn't a big row at the last Conference on<br />
this issue. -The Conference supported the idea that there should<br />
be an inquiry into the whole issue by the Parliamentary Committee,<br />
the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, and I think that was<br />
supported on all sides. I don't know when the committee will<br />
report.<br />
QUESTION: Will you be speaking to us again in this form before<br />
you go overseas, and....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I hope so next Tuesday. I am not quite sure<br />
whether the House of Representatives will be sitting but it looks<br />
as if it won't be and I would hope to be having this pleasant<br />
colloquy at that time.<br />
QUESTION: If you don't sir, perhaps you could tell us a little<br />
of what you expect of this trip and do you consider Russia to be<br />
thehighlight-of the journey and what things you might be raising<br />
with the Russians? Will it include the problem of the Jewish<br />
emigration? PRIME MINISTER: I have got nothing to add to questions I have<br />
alreLdy canswered on this subject, including the one you mentioned.<br />
I answered a question on that on TV 22 hours ago. I am sorry<br />
I haven't been able to have these conferences the last f'-w we<br />
but I had the advantage of the company of many of you t! la.. L<br />
three weekends in Queensland north, south, centre, west.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, if you don't appeal against Mr Taylor's<br />
decision what does this mean for your policy on wage restraint?<br />
The flow-on effects will be quite considerable to the private<br />
white-collar sector?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't make that assumption at all. Incidc. ntally,<br />
some of th.-reporting and the headlines ci; this subject seem to L~ e<br />
very much astray. Th'is is the first time, I hclleve, that<br />
Mr Taylor or his predecessors have granted I-ntage<br />
increases. For instanc, the percentage increase whic, hu ,_ Lo<br />
to the people on the smallest incomes were 25 per cent. TiÃ±. ' rc.<br />
he granted to those on the hic' was 13 per cent which is qui.<br />
a change as far as the Public Service Arbitrator is concerned.<br />
QUESTION: On the dreaded trip again.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Aren't you coming?<br />
QUESTION: I hope so. During the election campaign you addressed<br />
members of the Jewish community at a breakfast in Melbourne and<br />
you were reported as saying then that you hoped to include Israel<br />
in the itinerary for the trip. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I don't think I said that. I did not say that.<br />
I believe I said that I expected to be the first Australian Prime<br />
Minister to visit Israel. I am, of course, the only political<br />
1' eader in the Australian Parliament present or past who has<br />
ever visited Israel. I have visited if four times. I hope to<br />
visit Israel and, of course, also Egypt and Lebanon.<br />
QUESTION: On this trip Prime linister or at another time?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, there was never any suggestion on this trip.<br />
The statement to which you refer was last May, just before the<br />
elections and at that time it was expected I would visit Europe<br />
but not the Middle East in June, and that European visit has been<br />
postponed to this Christmas/ New Year period.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, the Senate has just defeated your Broadcasting<br />
and Television legislation by 27 to 25. Do you regard this as<br />
significant defeat?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Let me consider the implications.<br />
QUESTION: Last weekend in Brisbane you defended cons imer interests<br />
and said that some trade unions and employers were scrf'wing the<br />
public. Are you prepared to back up these wo ' rds with action and.<br />
oppose any move within the Labor Party to increase tariffs or<br />
duties on imported goods?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will look at all these matters on their merit.<br />
The attitude I take to protection, the assistance to some industries,<br />
impositions on consumers in respect of the products of those<br />
-'-industries, should be well-known. But as far as I am concerned<br />
an'y decisi-ons should be reached after considering the point of<br />
view seeking the point of view of all people concerned, and<br />
I don't believe that the only points of view that ziiould be<br />
cnsidered are those of the employers and employees in<br />
' IKrticular industries. I believe the consumer also hias to be<br />
-' c6nsidered.<br />
QUESTION: I refer to the Broadcasting Act which precludes<br />
television and radio from being broadcast or televised from<br />
midnight on the Wednesday preceding any election Federal or<br />
State. Has Cabinet at any stage considered amending that law?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There has been some discussion but there has<br />
been no decision. And there hasn't been any recent discussions<br />
either. I<br />
QUESTION: How do you now see the role of the Public Service and,<br />
in particular, the Treasury after some of the things that have been<br />
said last week and after the reports that were in the papers this<br />
morning that yo! ire going to set up a new non-Public Service<br />
decision advisory body around you, and after Dr Cairns decision<br />
not. to appoint his personal private secretary from the Treasury<br />
telf. Does this mean that the Government now regards the<br />
. f~ sury in particular and the Public Service in general as<br />
liable, that you are trying to set up alternative decision-<br />
~~ ing bodies or can we expect to see a change back towards the<br />
Jaditional pattern later in the course of this Government. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: You have asked me several questions. I can't<br />
pretend that I can remember them. I will therefore not try to<br />
give precise answers to them. All that I have done in this matter<br />
is to see that the three senior Ministers confer with me and<br />
with the Permanent Heads of my Department and of the Treasury and<br />
of the Department of Minerals and Energy and the Reserve Bank<br />
at regular intervals. This is not a decision-making body, it's<br />
a consultative body but I have not appointed and it doesn't<br />
fall to me to appoint any of the other bodies to which you refer.<br />
Nothing that I have done in this respect would be designed<br />
or likely to downgrade or oust Treasury. It should assist in the<br />
prompt and comprehensive examination, at the highest level of<br />
government, of all economic, statistics and indices.<br />
QUESTION: Over the last few days you have had quite a deal to<br />
say about the problems and achievements of the Whitlam Labor<br />
Government over the past two years. Sir, could I ask you what<br />
would you like to say on December 2, 1975 in terms of the<br />
achievements of your Government? What do you see as the problems'<br />
in the next 12 months, what are you hoping the results will be?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe that within the next 12 months we will<br />
see still more of our programs and the institutions we propose<br />
in operation. A year ago many of these institutions were still<br />
fledgelings the Cities Commission, the Grants Commission, the<br />
Schools Commission, the Prices Justification Tribunal, the Industries<br />
Assistance Commission. They are all now very effective<br />
institutions.* Now in the last twelve months we have set up many<br />
other bodies for instance, the Trade Commission. And I have no<br />
doubt that in twelve months time we will see the benefit of that<br />
body of the various pieces of legislation under the Australian<br />
Parliiment's taxation and corporations jurisdiction and we<br />
will al.: see'the benefit of many of the local bodies which we<br />
are estabji hing such as legal aid offices and community health<br />
centres. I believe that in twelve months time, right around t-e<br />
country, you will see the effective demonstrations of t! program<br />
which I have outlined over the last two years.<br />
QUESTION: And the problems sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The problems will be of the same kind but less in<br />
deiree than at the moment.<br />
QUESTrION: Sir, within that twelve months would you see a<br />
reducti'-in interest rates possibility?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: A very distinct possibility. t~ -, av a<br />
probability. QUESTION: Recently in a telcv i q4on interview you endorsed thri-<br />
Caucus system as an integral element in the Federal Parliamnzlu. Ly<br />
Labor Party.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
QUESTION: T am wondering if you could give us your views on members<br />
of the Caucus initiating broad economic policies. What would<br />
happen.... </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Caucus system, the Standing Orders of the<br />
Caucus, don't provide for that. There are committees which the<br />
Caucus elect~ s and they make recommendations on matters within<br />
their jurisdiction if they wish and they are considered by the<br />
Cabinet and then put to the full Caucus.<br />
QUESTION: Do you support that idea of a Caucus committee<br />
initiating economic policies?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, it can initiate certain ideas but quite<br />
obviously the executive which is elected wholly by the Caucus<br />
must be the prime initiating body. I don't mind where ideas come<br />
from I welcome them. There has been some error by some Caucus<br />
committees in presuming to review decisions which have been<br />
made under the Caucus Standing Orders by committee and by Cabinet<br />
itself.<br />
QUESTION: Following up to your answer to Mr Begg's question, to<br />
what extent would you hope to see the interest rate reduction<br />
and when?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haje got no more to say on that.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister you mentioned the. IAC as one of the<br />
achievements of the last 12 months. Are you concerned now at the<br />
rather sarcastic manner in which the IAC is being referred to<br />
by some political leaders and do you think this might reduce<br />
its effectiveness?<br />
PRIME' MINISTER: No. I believe the quality of the appointments<br />
we made to the IAC and the statutory obligations of the IACG<br />
will s r-Tive any such sarcastic comments. The critics of the IAC,<br />
I fin, -i't'stand up in general to the IAC itself. r haven't<br />
got very ML-sympathy for those people who criticise the IAC<br />
when either they have given evidence to the IAC, which the lAC<br />
has found deficient, or when they have not given evidenc( t all.<br />
I think people in assessing the views of critics of the IAC should<br />
examine the motive., and the performance of those critics. There<br />
was a recent case where a State department made a submission on<br />
a r-atter which had been reported on by the IAC and there were<br />
alz some outside consultants whom my own department asked to<br />
rel-on this same matter. I must say that the State departmenlL<br />
and outside consultants didn't stand up very well to what the<br />
TAC Eaid.<br />
QUESTION: made a few remarks about the Pub] i' Service wage<br />
increase which eft us rather up in the air. Yu, it<br />
being reconsidcored. Ca, -ou tell us how?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: i said it i, 1-ir considered.<br />
QUESTION: Well it is being considered. Can you tell us how?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It is under consideration I think I said.<br />
No I won't elaborate.<br />
QUESTION: Can you tell us whether you are happy with it. Do you<br />
think it will da-mage the case which the Government is about to<br />
put to the.... </p>
<p>7--<br />
-7-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I won't state any views on those either.<br />
QUESTION: Would you like to 1, ave power to select yourself<br />
for portion of the Cabinet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I've been asked this question so often<br />
and I have always given the same reply. I support the idea of a<br />
Government party electing the ministers. I have always said that<br />
and, I believe you know I have always said that. I believe the<br />
other system which applied under our predecessors was one of the<br />
reasons for our predecessors crumbling.<br />
QUESTION: I did say portion though, I never said....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, well I have been asked that to. I don't<br />
appreciate your asking me questions which then promote me to<br />
take up a didactic attitude towards you. But, the fact is that<br />
I support the present system wholly. I always have and I have<br />
always said so. </p>
