STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
CONCLUSION OF THE SECURITY INQUIRY<br />
On 7 October 1993, 1 announced that I had commissioned Mr Michael Cook AO, a<br />
distinguished senior public servant and diplomat, to inquire into various aspects of<br />
national security. The inquiry was initiated following Government concerns about<br />
aflgtior-niolving the unauthorised removal of material from ASIO.<br />
Mr Cook has completed his inquiry and submitted his report. I am grateful to him for<br />
the rigorous and perceptive work reflected in his report, which included extensive<br />
consultations with a number of agencies.<br />
The Government has considered the recommendations contained in Mr Cooks<br />
report and commenced implementation of the most appropriate follow-up action.<br />
Because the circumstances which prompted this inquiry involve questions of<br />
national security, I do not propose to make any further comment. I can add,<br />
however, that the Government has noted allegations made in a recent book by a<br />
former KGB official. Any allegation of this nature is taken seriously. Those<br />
contained in the book, however, do not seem to add substance to matters which<br />
have been the subject of the Security Inquiry.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition has been briefed on the Security Inquiry by Mr Cook.<br />
