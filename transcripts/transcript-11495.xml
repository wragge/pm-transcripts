<p>E&amp;OE..........................................................................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>We were wondering if we could ask you about Labor's jobs policy.</p>
<p> They've said that unemployment will stay between 7% and 8% unless</p>
<p> there are changes. Can we get it lower?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. We can get unemployment lower in this country if we continue to</p>
<p> have strong economic growth, if we continue to have tax reform, if we</p>
<p> continue to generate more jobs. This government has created 600,000 in</p>
<p> the four years that it's been in office. We've increased the</p>
<p> number of apprentices. We've increased the number of people in TAFE</p>
<p> colleges. We've announced today a contribution towards an information</p>
<p> technology skills institute, the very sort of thing that was being talked</p>
<p> about yesterday. I mean we have the runs on the board. We have from the</p>
<p> Labor Party a piece of un-costed pie in the sky rhetoric. We have the</p>
<p> runs on the board. I mean unemployment now is lower than it has been for</p>
<p> a decade and that is as a result of the government's policies. And</p>
<p> we could drive it lower. We could generate more jobs in small business</p>
<p> if only the Labor Party would support our further reforms to the unfair</p>
<p> dismissal laws.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can we get it to 5% as Peter Costello suggested?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We can get it lower if we maintain economic growth and if we have further</p>
<p> industrial relations reforms like getting rid of the silly unfair dismissal</p>
<p> laws that frighten small business out of taking on more people.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What's your reaction to the UN's findings on safe injecting</p>
<p> rooms?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they are no surprise to me. I don't support injecting rooms.</p>
<p> I never have. And I won't because I think they send the wrong signal.</p>
<p> But ultimately this is a matter that has to be resolved in Australia just</p>
<p> as other things must ultimately be resolved in Australia by Australians.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So what was your response then to claims that the UN board was in fact</p>
<p> influenced by your opposition to the shooting galleries?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Were you referring to the comments made by Professor Pennington? Well</p>
<p> they're wrong. I reject that completely. And I don't think the</p>
<p> professor should have made that claim because he admits he has no evidence</p>
<p> of it. I think it's absurd to suggest that my views would have nobbled</p>
<p> the views of the Narcotics Board. The Narcotics Board has always been</p>
<p> against injecting rooms and it's not surprising to me that they've</p>
<p> repeated that objection. And any suggestion that I intervened to try and</p>
<p> doctor the report is quite wrong and I totally reject it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On radio this morning you said that it was a matter for States to decide</p>
<p> even thought you personally disagreed [inaudible].</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. What we did in the case of the ACT was to say that we would not permit</p>
<p> any breach of a federal law. What I said was that we were not going to</p>
<p> allow any breaches of federal law, but ultimately it was a matter for</p>
<p> the States to decide that they go ahead with injecting rooms. There's</p>
<p> a different principle. We're not going to use the external affairs</p>
<p> power to overturn things like injecting rooms. But if the injecting rooms</p>
<p> were a breach of a federal law then we wouldn't allow it, but my</p>
<p> advice is that they are not. They are entirely within the province of</p>
<p> the States. I mean we've got to get to a stage in this country where</p>
<p> governments are accountable for their own responsibilities. This absurd</p>
<p> thing that every time something goes wrong you go running off to the federal</p>
<p> government and say fix it. We are a federation. We have States and they</p>
<p> demand the right to have their own say on things, well they have to accept</p>
<p> responsibility. And if people are unhappy with what the New South Wales</p>
<p> government's doing or the Western Australian government's doing,</p>
<p> well they have a remedy at the next State election in New South Wales</p>
<p> and Western Australia, not that I'm suggesting they vote against</p>
<p> the Western Australian government although I'd be happy if they voted</p>
<p> against the New South Wales government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you were also asked on radio by a pensioner to give a</p>
<p> guarantee [inaudible] would not be worse off under the GST. Can you give</p>
<p> that guarantee?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look pensioners will be better off under the GST. Pensioners will</p>
<p> be much better off because they will get a 4% up front increase, they</p>
<p> will get savings bonuses and all sorts of additional benefits. So generally</p>
<p> speaking I can certainly promise that they will be better off.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you make of Dennis Burke's comments that the judiciary in</p>
<p> the Northern Territory is corrupt? Do you think he should at least stand</p>
<p> down as Attorney-General?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Dennis Burke has dealt with that and there's nothing more that</p>
<p> need be added. Okay.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, on the strength of the economy, things are looking pretty</p>
<p> good. International growth is feeding expectations. Does this mean we'll</p>
<p> be pleasantly surprised in the next year with the strength of Australia's</p>
<p> economy?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the Australian economy is very strong now. It's very strong.</p>
<p> And that is a result of the government's policies. And we don't</p>
<p> want it wrecked by increasing income taxes Mr Beazley is threatening to</p>
<p> do. And the next thing to be done to make the Australian economy good</p>
<p> and strong is to reform the tax system. Now the people of Australia were</p>
<p> told about our plans at the last election. We won that election and we</p>
<p> are implementing that plan. And instead of sniping and snarling, and behaving</p>
<p> like a political guerilla on the subject, the Opposition Leader should</p>
<p> support us. I mean these guerilla tactics are just silly. They should</p>
<p> accept it, that the Australian people voted for our tax plan. And instead</p>
<p> of trying to spoil it they should accept the verdict of the Australian</p>
<p> people.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But in terms of the outlook for growth are we still looking strong?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we are still looking very strong but I never take anything for granted.</p>
<p> But we will only remain strong if we follow the right policies. If we</p>
<p> give up on tax reform, if we give up on industrial relations reform, if</p>
<p> we encourage an outbreak of a 36 hour week claims as the new Labor government</p>
<p> in Victoria is doing then we will put a cloud over that continued strong</p>
<p> economic growth.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, we saw the tragedy the other day [inaudible] where a</p>
<p> baby was in a car while the mother was [inaudible] gambling. [inaudible]</p>
<p> New South Wales has announced they will be putting signs up in carparks.</p>
<p> Are they adequate measures do you think to sort of prevent this happening</p>
<p> again?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well adopting what I said a moment ago perhaps you should first direct</p>
<p> that question to the State government because the State governments have</p>
<p> ultimate control in relation to gambling. We're going to....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] strong views on gambling.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I've got very strong views. I think there are a lot of social</p>
<p> evils that flow from the abuse of gambling. And any government that encourages</p>
<p> over reliance on gambling has a lot to answer for. And I think some State</p>
<p> governments have done that and I think it does vary from State to State.</p>
<p> I think when you look at the record there's been less encouragement</p>
<p> in this State, in Western Australian than in many others. So in that sense</p>
<p> the Western Australian government has a better record than a number of</p>
<p> the other State governments. And I am disturbed about it. I don't</p>
<p> want to talk about the individual case because it's now before the</p>
<p> courts and it wouldn't be appropriate for me to do so. But there's</p>
<p> no doubt in the world that abuse of gambling has huge social consequences</p>
<p> and there are lots of people who can't afford to, that are gripped</p>
<p> in gambling. And all of us have a responsibility. Now it's not easy</p>
<p> because you're trying to persuade people to change their habits and</p>
<p> that is a long slow laborious process, and you don't achieve it overnight</p>
<p> by some narrow response. You have to over a period of time educate people</p>
<p> of the dangers and try and reduce the reliance of States on gambling revenue</p>
<p> and that's one of the advantages of the GST. What the GST will do</p>
<p> over time is give the States a steadily rising source of revenue, and</p>
<p> they won't have to rely as much on things like gambling into the</p>
<p> future. It's another reason, another social reason why we should</p>
<p> have tax reform in this country.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does that give the State governments the incentive to perhaps roll back</p>
<p> the extent of gambling that some States have allowed?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What I will say is this  that they will have more revenue out of</p>
<p> the GST over time and they ought therefore to have more flexibility in</p>
<p> other areas.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I would like to see governments with the additional GST revenue</p>
<p> improve government schools, hospitals, police services, and I would also</p>
<p> like to see over time a reduced reliance on gambling revenue. Of course</p>
<p> I would.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does that mean cutting the number of machines......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No look, you're asking for me to comment on the details of individual</p>
<p> State government policies and I'm just not in a position to do anything</p>
<p> because I don't know enough about it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mandatory sentencing, will the Attorney-General actually be writing....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes yes, he'll be writing to them?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But when will he be doing that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think he might be doing it today.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Why do you feel there's a role for him to interfere into the operation</p>
<p> of the States where as you've just been arguing in other cases that</p>
<p> States [inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Just because you write people letters doesn't mean to say you're</p>
<p> using the external affairs power to overturn a law.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
