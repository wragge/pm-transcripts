PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 25 MAY 1978 -761/ Lt1<br />
INTERVIEW WITH FRENCH JOURNALISTS % Ntc<br />
QUESTION: Australia, in the past, has often been described<br />
as exporti--* ng too much raw materials, importing too much equipment<br />
and being dependent upon a small number of customers. What<br />
do you i-ntend to do over the coming years to correct that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:., I'm not sure that it was for a long time<br />
that that accurate description of Australia. It might have<br />
been a diss,-nblanc6-. of truth in the years up to 1939 but<br />
there has been a very significant change in Australia and a<br />
very great expansion of Australian industry, manufacturing<br />
industry, in the years since 1945. At the same time, we've<br />
done a very great deal to access markets of the Pacific, trade<br />
with Japan. It's not always realized that our trade with<br />
Japan is greater than the combined trade between Japan, Germany<br />
and Britain and when you look at our population and realize<br />
that our two-way trade is greater than the two-way trade between<br />
Japan, Britain and Germany combined, it indicates the extent<br />
to which we are now trading in the Pacific theatre. Markets<br />
in China are growing very significantly. We'de always had<br />
traditional markets in Europe of course, especially in Britain.<br />
and markets in the United States. The United States markets<br />
have been maintained but the European markets, largely because<br />
of Commuinity policies have been to a significant extent<br />
destroyed because of the policy decisions and framework of<br />
Community common agriculture policies. In the years the<br />
last twenty years in particular the nature of our exports<br />
has diversified very greatly. It used to be primarily<br />
significantly agricultural commodities to that added very<br />
significant mineral exports. We would like to see greater<br />
processing in mineral exports; greater processing in some of<br />
our traditional exports such as wool. Here we often find<br />
again the tarrif policies of European countries, of other<br />
countries make that very difficult because raw wool, for example,<br />
goes to Europe duty free but as soon as it goes through any<br />
part of the processing stage there start to be very substantial<br />
duties on it which mean processes in this country have to<br />
compete in a difficult environment. Its not generally realized<br />
that some parts of Australian manufacturing industry are in<br />
fact very efficient and especially having regard to the small<br />
size of our domestic market. They have achieved a great deal.<br />
I think we are the only country, apart from Japan, that is<br />
exporting colour television sets to Hong Kong and they are<br />
being sold without any subsidies and profitably. In the home<br />
appliance area Australian concerns which used to import from<br />
Europe or Japan are now producing the same lines or modified<br />
changed lines in Australia because they can do it more effectively<br />
and more profitably. Instead of importing from their overseas<br />
companies they are producing in their Australian branch. So<br />
the Australian economy is very much diversified compared to the<br />
days before 1939 its much diversified compared to the late<br />
140s or early ' 50s. The process has been a continual one since<br />
the World War. In addition to this of course, our political<br />
interests ~-eexpanded and changed. The days are very long gone<br />
./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
when the British representative in a country used to<br />
represent Australia. Our interests are different. That<br />
doesn't stop us having close links of many kinds but it would<br />
be unthinkable for Australia to be represented overseas by<br />
anyone other than Australia Australian missions except in<br />
the most strange and unusual circumstances. In particular,<br />
we've expanded our diplomacy in the Asian/ Pacific theatre;<br />
Japan, China, the Indian Subcontinent, in the region in which<br />
we live. In February there was a meeting of twelve Heads of<br />
Government, some very very small island states of the Pacific,<br />
but also India and Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Singapore all<br />
the Commonwealth countries in the region; and that was an<br />
Australian initiative indicating the concern for our region<br />
and believing that countries need to identify common interests,<br />
to cooperate together to the maximum extent. So we are seeking<br />
to play a part%-constructively, reasonably, in world affairs<br />
because I think that is the obligation of all governments<br />
and at the same time to see how they can advance a wider cause.<br />
QUESTION: Do you feel that Australia is perfectly safe if<br />
she is, or should some greater rc be given to<br />
improving her defences, increasing her defence force?<br />
PRIME MINISTER : We are expanding our defence forces greater<br />
real resources are going into defence. Modern equipment is,<br />
as you would know, vastly expensive. We seek to deal with<br />
minimum manpower so that of the funds we do spend in defence,<br />
a maximum amount can be spent on modern, sophisticated equipment.<br />
You will know at the moment that our defence forces are examining<br />
a short list of a fighter replacement. The objective is to<br />
obtain the air superiority fighter with some ground capability.<br />
The Air Force will be making, the defence people, their own<br />
technical evaluation of a number of aircraft and that will be<br />
a very very substantial purchase cc'\.<br />
is the most expensive single purchase that we ever would have<br />
made. We need to look to our defences, as many countries do<br />
I think. I would much preferto have a world in which we cou: ld<br />
devote our total attention to economic well-being and economic<br />
advancement but we don't live in that ideal world yet.<br />
QUESTION: Can you see any threat<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That's a question that's always asked and<br />
without being critical of it, its a question that can never be<br />
answered in precise terms because by the time you start to<br />
nominate a perceived or a real threat and 60Co\ k<br />
arises, then you haven't been doing what you ought to do in<br />
terms of the defence of your own country. In assessing the<br />
strategic situation in which any country lives, you've got to<br />
look at the total communities of strategic environment<br />
around you and know that you can be affected by events on the<br />
other side, as Australia has been twice, as you know, in<br />
two world war-s. Australia was very much affected and involved, </p>
<p>-3<br />
embroiled, in both because we believe we ought to be and<br />
that it was in our own national interest. So you have to<br />
look at the total world scene, make an assessment of those<br />
factors which could lead to unsettling, disturbing and<br />
dangerous threatening situations and see what we should do<br />
to protect yourself and to play a part again, as a responsible<br />
citizen in the world. I think, some people judge defence<br />
policy and say if you don't name a threat you don't need to<br />
spend any money on defence and no threats have arisen so you<br />
have wasted the funds you have spent on defence. I don't look<br />
at it that way. If you have a policy of having adequate<br />
defence forces and you don't get to the stage of nominating<br />
a perceived or real threat, then I think that's an example of<br />
a defence policy that's been successful, of a total foreign<br />
policy that's been successful because you've been able to<br />
conduct yourself in a way which has avoided the dangers and<br />
in &gt; coa) negative sense the art of forei gn policy is to<br />
avoid dangers; to have within your own strategic council<br />
some idea of the dangers, the concerns, that could arise and<br />
then pursue your integrated foreign and defence policy in a way<br />
which would make sure those perceived dangers, or possible dangers,<br />
did not arise. I don't really think that it serves any useful<br />
purpose to point to this country or that country or the potential<br />
of East/ West differences, or problems between the Soviet Union<br />
or China, between NATO WARSAW Pact, to say that dangers<br />
could arise out of these things, they are part of the strategic<br />
environment that we must assess when we make our own decisions<br />
about our foreign policies and about our defence preparedness.<br />
QUESTION: Are you at all worried and concerned with the<br />
increasing Soviet naval presence in ( inaudible).<br />
PRIME MINI-STER: Anyone must be concerned with a nation<br />
that spends 14 percent of its gross national product, allegedly,<br />
on defence. Can anyone-really believe that that's necessary<br />
for defensive purposes? Is there any need to say more?<br />
our view, my view, which I expressed shortly after coming into<br />
Government, was very much the same and that which has been<br />
expressed on repeated occasions by the NATO powers the<br />
NATO Council of Ministers, the NATO foreign ministers and<br />
defence ministers when they pointed to the Soviet build-up<br />
in conventional arms and in other arms which they believe are<br />
just not necessary for the defence of the Soviet Union's own<br />
territory. They have pointed to the offensive capacity, the<br />
global reach, which the Soviet Union's defence preparation have<br />
given it and they were just as concerned about that well,<br />
concern that one can express * in relation to the Indian Oceant,<br />
but a part of that total global concern.<br />
QUESTION: would you like to have the present immigration<br />
' laws amended -into Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would like better economic circumstances<br />
and less unemployment so we could have a larger immigration program.<br />
We will in fact be reviewing the nature of the program very<br />
shortly. If people want to come and live here and can contribute<br />
to Australia n life in material terms and at the same time bring<br />
partof hez own tradition and culture and background with them,<br />
I would li*:-a to see the circumstances in which we could accept<br />
more people from other countries. / 14 </p>
<p>-4<br />
QUESTION: That would include Asian countries?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Quite a significant number do come from<br />
Asia. There is no distinction on the grounds of race, colour,<br />
religion. QUESTION: Do you think that proportion could be increased?<br />
PRIM[ E MINISTER: It has been in recent times.<br />
QUESTION: When do you expect the transportation of uranium<br />
in the North(~\ oe will begin?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There have been many hurdles to overcome,<br />
as I think you know. Our political opponents have a policy<br />
opposed to the mining, there are questions relating to unions,<br />
we had a very long drawn out environmental study and survey<br />
which really recommended a complex framework for the<br />
development of uranium. Having in mind the nature of the<br />
recommendations I think faster progress has been made than one<br />
might have anticipated and the opposition to the mining and<br />
export of uranium has faded, receded, into the background.<br />
There is one last matter and that is negotiations with the<br />
Northern Land Council over terms and conditions. As you know<br />
it is an aboriginal community, and aboriginal land. I hope<br />
the negotiations will proceed that will enable some site work<br />
to take place this dry season. I will be disappointed if it<br />
doesn't and that's our objective. There is no doubt that it<br />
is going to proceed. There is no doubt that we will be<br />
exporting and supplying uranium. Again, basically, I think<br />
for two reasons, leaving the financial gain to Australia<br />
aside for a moment. Australia is an energy rich country in<br />
an energy short world and that gives us an obligation to<br />
countries that are short of energy. But at the same time<br />
we have I think a higher obligation to do what we can to<br />
prevent the proliferation of nuclear arms, to prevent or to<br />
establish the safest possible system of trade in uranium and<br />
we therefore for those reasons have a strict safeguard policy<br />
which involves bilateral treaties private and quite apart<br />
from the international C~~ X) safeguards and<br />
being in the business of selling uranium; but at the same<br />
time seeking to maintain very strict safeguards which is, as we<br />
believe, are quite reasonable for any well intentioned customers.<br />
It is again a part of an international obligation.. I have<br />
whether they are starting this year.<br />
QUESTION: Can you see any obstacle at all in the way of<br />
possible sales of Australian uranium to France, or has that now<br />
all been cleared up?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think a large part of it has been cleared up<br />
but there is the question of the negotiation of bilateral<br />
safeguards, as you know, and France would know what our<br />
bilateral safeguard requirements are. We have already negotiated<br />
previously with one or two countries, negotiating with others.<br />
I understand France wants to diversify her source of supply.<br />
I would ho-, e conditions would be established in which there<br />
are no problems that would prevent that happening between us. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Are negotiations going on at the moment on this<br />
sub je c t7<br />
PRIMEZ MINISTER: I don't think, I can this, we haven't met<br />
safeguards negotiating team and I don't think any negotiations<br />
have so far taken place with France.<br />
( David will you get the list of the countries with whom<br />
negotiations have taken place and somebody who can say how<br />
far the negotiations have gone and what's going to happen<br />
on the<br />
QUESTION: You will be travelling to Europe next week;<br />
can you tell us how much you would expect from E rope on<br />
the more immediate issue of economic<br />
tariff concessions.. in amore general way, how much would you<br />
expect from Europe in<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not going to Europe to negotiate on the<br />
bilateral matters between the Commission and ourselves. Last<br />
year in discussions with the European Commission and with<br />
other national leaders, including the Prime Minister of France<br />
and the President, the door was open to the framework of<br />
bilateral discussions which were taking place with the<br />
Community. I can't say that those discussions have always<br />
gone smoothly as we would have liked there have been one or<br />
two delays which we think that should not have been there.<br />
But the discussions are now scheduled and they will be taking<br />
place early in June and Mr. Garland will be handling those<br />
discussions keeping in close touch with me in relation to<br />
them. But the purpose in terms of our bilateral relations<br />
and in terms of the well-being of Australia, they are vastly<br />
important and I think a number of people in Europe don't really<br />
understand the position that has developed. Because many<br />
industries in Australia have been established to supply<br />
Europe, supply Britain, and it wasn't over three or five or<br />
ten years time, it might have been over half a century or<br />
longer and industries like the meat industry, the cattle<br />
industry, the dairy industry, for example; in many parts of<br />
Australia you can only grow beef and then the Common Market<br />
comes along looking to join us and I am one of the very few<br />
people in Australian parliament who on political grounds<br />
supported Britain joining9 us, and I still support it, and yet<br />
I think the concept of r. e<br />
with a degree of political unification playing a constructive<br />
and outward looking-role in world affairs is quite critical<br />
for the peace and well-being of the world and I don't detract<br />
from that or alter it all. And I also don't criticize the<br />
objective of protecting European farmers. I think its an<br />
obligation on the Government of France to protect French<br />
farmers or the British Government, and the German and the<br />
Irish-but'it is possible to pursue protection and I put<br />
this to the Prime Minister of France and I think he<br />
responded not unsympathetically to it when I made the point. I said<br />
we don't challenge the Common Agriculture Policy. We don't<br />
challenge your right to protect the European farmers. You'd<br />
be expected to and we know quite in any case it would be<br />
political.. T nonsense to think that any other course was possible.<br />
But we bDelieve that it should be possible to do that and<br />
./ 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
to achieve changes at the margin to these policies which<br />
would allow the prospects of some trade and that has been<br />
the basis of our approach, the basis of our argument. We're<br />
not seeking any revolutionary overthrow of existing arrangements<br />
of current policies but levy systems that allow the prospect<br />
of some trade. We don't unreasonably encourage the expansion<br />
of European surpluses which are then sold with great subsidies<br />
in the traditional markets of other countries. We, for example,<br />
used to supply the Sri Lanka market for flour, on a commercial<br />
basis. That's now supplied from Europe. On a restitution<br />
basis export subsidies and the market we have developed over<br />
many years therefore disappears because we are not in the<br />
business of competing with export subsidies. C~ c'e<br />
in terms of 14 million can't compete with the capacity of<br />
260 million to provide that kind of support to capture a market<br />
so you don't even start. We are arguing that the levy<br />
system, the common agricultural policy system, ought to be<br />
capable of operating in a way that does not unduly encourage<br />
surpluses in Europe but does allow the prospect of some trade<br />
from thosecountries that can produce well, effectively and<br />
efficiently; and then an export subsidy resistution policy<br />
is managed in such a way that doesn't damage the markets of<br />
third countries, the traditional markets that have been built<br />
up over tire and I don't believe either of those requests are<br />
unreasonable. I think in terms of high principle the ones<br />
that (\ o\\) should be supported. But however important<br />
these matters are to Australia, and they are very important<br />
because the well-being of our industries has been and therefore<br />
large parts of Australia and many country towns and cities of<br />
Australia have been living in a state of very real depression<br />
for many years and they will until we can get access to<br />
markets to some extent. And however important that is, the<br />
reason for my visiting Europe on this occasion is not to argue<br />
the bilateral case, that's in Mr. Garland's hands, is to discuss<br />
the general world economic situation, the MTN discussions,<br />
the UNCTAD discussions that will be taking place over the next<br />
few weeks. The major nations will be meeting in Bonn at the<br />
economic summit conference in July. President Carter said he<br />
hopes that the main lines of UNCTAD, of MTN, will be completed<br />
in July. Looking at it from this distance and the motivation<br />
that we see from this distance, I am not overly optimistic<br />
that the right decisions will be made. If the wrong decisions<br />
are made we do run the risk that Congress will become very<br />
protectionist, President Carter has held it back the<br />
discussions are coming up in July, with the discussions coming<br />
up in July you can't go protectionist. There are protectionist<br />
tendencies in Europe also, not just in agriculture in steel.<br />
in other goods in matters affecting Japan and if -the wrong<br />
decisions are made at MTN the dangers of the world falling<br />
back to " beggar-thy-neighbour" policies I think is very real<br />
and I think that will be tragic for the well-being of Frenchmans,<br />
of Germans, of Englishmen, of Australians and of all of us.<br />
What we have to try and achieve is an expansion of markets<br />
and through that an expansion of world trade.* If we are all<br />
just going to argue about the set-up of existing markets there<br />
isn't going,-, to be enough work for our factories, for our farms<br />
and for our mines and how therefore do you achieve an expansion<br />
of markets, an expansion of trade. The MTN proposal on<br />
industrial goods sounds fine, a 40%~ tariff cut across the line,<br />
but when you analyse it, it doesn't really mean all that much.<br />
/ 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
It comes down on a starting date, going back several years,<br />
you've got to exclude any' prior European trade because that's<br />
not effective it's free anyway. You find that tariff cut<br />
will be operating on less than 20%~ of world trade. It doesn't<br />
start until 19 80. Since tariffs are about 10%~ anyway it means<br />
that the proposal is for a half percent cut a year; of: five<br />
years compulsory, three years optional, depending upon the<br />
econo-mic circumstances of the time. Currency movements have<br />
more rthan pushed that sort of change aside in a matter of a<br />
day or a week and therefore that tariff proposal n. A~~<br />
affecting industrial goods can' t give you the forw7ard looki'-ng<br />
step into a better trading world that everyone wants. it's<br />
just not possible. The substance isn't there and in any case,<br />
there are many qualifications that surround it. In addition<br />
to that, ofL course, it's a proposal that falls very uniquely<br />
in different countries. ForEurope, North American and Japan<br />
about 40%~ of their exports would be covered, for Australia<br />
about for many developing countries less than so<br />
to the extent that there are benefits, the benefits are very<br />
unequal between the trading nations of the world. That all<br />
gets back to the proposition that if there ends up by being<br />
agreement between Europe and the United States as there was<br />
in the Kennedy c0C) ' XW N<br />
agriculture is too hard an area commodity is too hard an<br />
area in which to make progress, therefore leaves<br />
us with industrial good alone then I would suggest that the<br />
MTN can achieve itself will achieve nothing it can't be<br />
successful. If it is to be successful its got to be broad<br />
based. Its got to involve something for countries that<br />
aren't major industrial exporters and traders. Its got to<br />
be a , its got to embrace the<br />
third world they feel very much pushed aside when other<br />
people meet together and make decisions which affect their<br />
livelihood. We don't hold me to the figures but the<br />
terms of trade and commodities is worse than they have been<br />
for 15 years and I think would have had<br />
to expand by three or more times more than it has even to<br />
make up in the fall in the terms of trade to developing<br />
countries. Is it any wonder that they feel frustrated, distraught,<br />
wondering what's going to happen. At the last Commonwealth<br />
Conference, one of the African delegations said that when they<br />
first went to the Commonwealth Conference it felt so many<br />
people working so long, exporting so much tœ oc%,% A'c\ e)<br />
to pay for the delegation and now with so many more people<br />
working so much longer producing about 10 times more<br />
to pay for the delegation because of the terms of trade. We<br />
believe that trade in commodities is very different from<br />
trade in manufacturers its often a long-term basis, you<br />
can't change your supply base, you can't suddenly say well.<br />
we will produce less cars, or we will produce less television<br />
sets or less refrigerators or whatever it is and organize<br />
it that way*, cropping into long-term business, producing meat<br />
is a long-term business and you need to get stability built<br />
into it. Not at unreasonable levels, at reasonable ways<br />
and I think we've shown through international wheat agreements,<br />
through t-he International Sugar Agreement which I regret<br />
Europe hasni't joined, through our own operations of more<br />
marketing =~ ganization. We've shown them there on one case<br />
on a n mzral basis through wool and arrangement that has </p>
<p>8-<br />
benefited consumers and producers;. through the other<br />
international arrangements matters that have introduced<br />
stability into the trade in the way that's helped many<br />
countries and consumers as well and there needs to be<br />
more of that, a greater understanding of the problems<br />
in the Third World. I think " so these are the real<br />
reasons why I want to visit Britain, France and Germany,<br />
to speak to the leaders of those countries. It is before<br />
the summit meeting will be held in Bonn, it's before the<br />
final decisions will be made at MTN and I believe that<br />
this year the world will set the trading pattern for the<br />
rest of this century. We are either going to make up<br />
our minds to go forward with confidence and common sense<br />
and decency, or we are going to end up scrabbling around<br />
like a lot of selfish nations damaging the world trading<br />
system and damaging the economic well-being of all our<br />
people. And I don't think we can assume yet that we are<br />
going to take a sensible path. Alright, Australia is just<br />
one of those middle-ranking countries and we live a long<br />
way from Europe, but I think you have an obligation to do<br />
whatever we can to join with others to try and achieve a<br />
sensible and a proper result.<br />
we had technical talks with a technical mission from<br />
( inaudible) there will be further talks. But the British<br />
asked( inaudible) for safeguards on supply that's<br />
( inaudible). We have had discussions with the Phillipines<br />
which is well advanced. We have talked with the Italians,<br />
we will talk with the European community next month. ( Indaudible)<br />
discussions with Japan on safeguards very shortly. With<br />
Finland, discussions on safeguards are advancing well. We<br />
are going to have several negotiating teams so it is a question<br />
of negotiating with countries ( inaudible).<br />
discuss these matters with all the countries of Europe. We<br />
know Europe's need for power, need for energy. We recognize<br />
obligations to do what we can as a resource rich nation to<br />
fulfill that. As I indicated that also recognize our<br />
obligations to see that trade in uranium is undertaken in a way<br />
that does not lead to suspicion, promote suspicion, because<br />
its when you promote suspicion in the world that you achieve<br />
. more suspicion... ( end of tape). 000---</p>
