PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH VY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
OFFICIAL OPENING OF CeBIT<br />
HANOVER 7 MARCH 195<br />
I am very pleased to take part in the opening of<br />
It is a particular pleasure to be in Hanover a3 the first<br />
Australian Prime Minister to visit Germany wince<br />
reunification. We are good friends, with a long history<br />
of close co-operation and ties which go well beyond the<br />
commercial. You are, however, also one of our ten<br />
largest trading partners and investors.<br />
The relationship with Germany means a lot to us. I hope<br />
my visit this week will lay the foundation for<br />
Australia's co-operation with Germany well into the next<br />
century. I could have faxed this speech, of course. or used the<br />
modem. I could have E-mailed it: or, as some remote<br />
Aboriginal communities do these days in outbaCk<br />
Australia, I could have video-conferenced it.<br />
I could have used the highway Instead of the aeroplane.<br />
E-mail is quicker, cheaper, more comfortable and doesn't<br />
separate us from our families.<br />
But for all its extraordinary power and convenience, all<br />
its seemingly limitless potential, there will always be<br />
some things the information highway cannot do.<br />
Among them is the need to make personal contact of the<br />
kind I will make in Germany Inl the next few days, or the<br />
kind you are making here at CeSIT 95. Nor will it ever<br />
relieve us of the need to make judgements and decisions<br />
and to have the will1 to act upon them.<br />
In fact, right now, no decisions are more important then<br />
the ones we are reaching in regard to the revolution In<br />
information technology and communications which is<br />
transforming our lives.<br />
CeBIT 95 is taking place at a time when policy makers all<br />
over the world are having to grapple with new and complex<br />
issues raised by Information technology, </p>
<p>TEL: 7. Mar-. 95 16: 14 No. 009 P. 03/ 10<br />

Last week, I launched the final report of an Australian<br />
Government inquiry into the technical and commercial<br />
preconditions for the delivery of broadband services to<br />
homes, businesses and schools throughout Australia.<br />
There is a striking similarity between the Issues we have<br />
been investigating and those considered by the G7 at its<br />
summit on the Information Society in Brussels last week.<br />
The G7 meeting addressed the social consequences of the<br />
revolution in communications technology: the democratic<br />
imperatives. They asked the question what sort of<br />
Society will the information society be?<br />
Among other things, they concluded that government3<br />
around the world must promote the universal provision of<br />
services; diversity of content, including cultural and<br />
linguistic diversity; open access to networks and<br />
equality of opportunity.<br />
In Australia vie have been saying things for some time.<br />
In fact, wie have been doing the.,<br />
The G7 Conference Theme Paper spoke about the " enticing"<br />
potential rewards of the global information society:<br />
" better social integration: the recovery of our sense of<br />
community; enhancing the progress of democratic values<br />
and sharing as wiell as preserving cultural creativity,<br />
traditions and identities; improving the quality of life;<br />
a stimulus to economic growth, job Creation and higher<br />
economic efficien'cy 1 and so on.<br />
In Australia, vie know what these things mean. The<br />
Communications revolution suits our ambitions.<br />
It suits our social ambition~ s which are social democratic<br />
egalitarian and -inclusive.<br />
It means that vie can deliver soc'i program5 more<br />
efficiently and that we can reach the margins with them.<br />
That is another amoitlon wie can pursue with the new<br />
technology: we can overcome the vast distances which<br />
separ-ate Australians and deliver, even to the most remote<br />
areas, education, training and health services, including<br />
medical teaching, rehabilitation programs and rapid long<br />
distance diagnosis. we can deliver employment programs.<br />
The new technology will enable us to take to the more<br />
remote communities of Australia the nation's arts and<br />
heritage.<br />
Australians live in a relatively loose federation on a<br />
continent the size of western Europe. ' We have a<br />
population of just 18 million an extraordinarily<br />
diverse multicultural population the vast majority of<br />
whom live in Cities on the coastal fringe, we see In the.<br />
Communications revolution an opportunity to effectively<br />
reduce the physical, social and cultural distances </p>
<p>TEL: 7. Mar. 95 16: 14 No. 009 P.<br />

between Austral ians and to r-reate a more equi tablea and<br />
cohesive nation.<br />
If the distances between Australians have always been a<br />
concern, so too have the distances which separate<br />
Australia from the rest of the world.<br />
Some years ago an Australian historian coined the term<br />
" 1the tyranny of distance" to describe the way in which<br />
our isolation from each other and the world has shaped<br />
our national development,<br />
Overcoming this " tyranny of distance" has been, if not<br />
Quite a national obsession, a powerful theme in the story<br />
of Australia. Information technology and the<br />
communications revolution is bound to be a decisive<br />
Chapter in the story.<br />
It will be all the more decisive because it Complements<br />
another ambition of ours that is to integrate Australia<br />
with the global economy and, in particular, the fastest<br />
growing economies in the world those of the Asia-<br />
Pacific. I know that this region is Of growinji interest<br />
and importance to Germany.<br />
For Australia, Asia is not the Far East but the Near<br />
North. Our economic integration with the region has been<br />
growing fast: a decade ago less than half of Australia's<br />
merchandise exports went to north east and south east<br />
Asia. The figure is now 60 per cent.<br />
Nine of our twelve largest export markets are in Asia.<br />
Australia supplies almost half of east Asia's Coal, iron<br />
ore and beef and over hal f of i ts, wool and al umi n ium<br />
ore. Australia has, to a very substantial extent,<br />
literally fuelled east Asia's economic boom.<br />
But although these commodity exports remain very<br />
important to us, exports of elaborately transformed<br />
manufactures to the Asia-Pacific have more than doubled<br />
in the past decade. And we expect services exports to<br />
double over the next five yea-s.<br />
In the Asia-Pacific we are seeing the emergence of a<br />
sense of community, an understanding among the countries<br />
of the region that we need to work together if we are to<br />
maintain high rates of economic growth.<br />
This is what nas beer) driving the development of the Asia<br />
Pacific Economic Co-operation organisation APEC.<br />
In fact, the proportion of trade between the APEC<br />
countries Is greater than that within the EU, In<br />
Indonesia last November, leaders from the 18 APEC<br />
economies committed themselves to the goal of free trade<br />
and investment in the region by 2010 for industrialised<br />
economies and 2020 for developing economies, </p>
<p>TEL: 7. Mar. 95 16: 14 N0.009 P. I<br />

When we meet again 11M Osaka later this year, APEC<br />
Government leaders will be talking about the best ways to<br />
implement their free trade goals anti working together oil<br />
Issues like the harmonisation of standards and customs<br />
regulIation.<br />
ror both Australia and for the region the potential of<br />
APEC is vast. Yot it is important for more than the<br />
materi* 1al benefits it will deliver: It is important for<br />
the message it contains. It is a watershed in the<br />
region's history; and in Australia's history it marks a<br />
change of the same dimensiaons it encapsulates the<br />
effort we have made in the past decade to transform our<br />
economy, redefi~ ne our independent identity and re-Orient<br />
ourselves towards that part of the world in which -we live<br />
and our future very substantially lies.<br />
The communications revolution plays a defining role in<br />
this Australian revolution,<br />
Wo are very conscious of the fact that it offers us the<br />
chance to dramatically improve the performance of our<br />
existing industries and create new ones new industries<br />
which will integrate us more thoroughly with the world<br />
economy, and at the same time strengthen the fabric of<br />
our national life, culture and identity.<br />
Information technology is already a major Australian<br />
industry and one of the most rapidly growing sectors of<br />
the Australian economy. It is a significant export<br />
earner now and the industry has set itself a target of<br />
quadrupling those earnings by the year 2000.<br />
That Australia has been chosen as Partner Country for<br />
this year's CeBIT Exhibition, we regard not only as a<br />
great honour, but as a very w'elcome testimony to<br />
Australia's advanced capabilities in information<br />
technology and communications.<br />
I am 3ure that the 170 or so Australian companies<br />
represented here will not mind if I say that their<br />
presence speaks for more than the excellence of their own<br />
operations and their own success it speaks for the now<br />
Australia. Their presence speaks for a country which has radically<br />
transformed its economy in the past decade and is<br />
competing successfully in the modern global economy.<br />
We hvpe, of course, that this Exhibition will1 help these<br />
companies to expand their operations in Germany and<br />
Europe. But more broadly we hope that our participation<br />
at Cebit 85 will help the international perception of<br />
Australia to catch up with the contemporary reality.<br />
we are under no illusions about this: many Europeans<br />
continue to think of Australia as a remote country -I<br />
remote not only in the geographical sense, but removed </p>
<p>TEL: 7. Mar. 95 16: 14 No. 009 P. iC<br />
also from the modern international market place of ideas,<br />
innovation, technology and industry.<br />
It is true, Australia is a long way from Hanover. It is<br />
also true that we live in a country whose unique phySical<br />
characteristics, along with its pas~ toral and mining<br />
industries, have long been its defining characteristics.<br />
And so long as those traditional industries continue to<br />
flourish, and tourists come from all over the worldincluding,<br />
I am happy to say, Germany to see the<br />
outback and the rain forests and the beaches, we will not<br />
be discouraging these perception5. J<br />
Rather, we would like to add to them an appreciation of<br />
the change that has taken place the change to an<br />
outward-looking sophisticated manufacturing economy,..;<br />
I could point to any number of examples of that change.<br />
But none is more striking than that in information<br />
technology and communications the field in which the<br />
Australian companies represented here at CeBIT 95 are<br />
excell1i ng.<br />
It is to detract not at all from the energy and efforts<br />
of these companies to say that they now work in a<br />
domestic environment that could scarcely hav. e been<br />
imagined a decade ago a much more favourable domestic<br />
envi ronment.<br />
Lot me state a few of the facts as briefly as possible.<br />
One way of summ'arising our position is simply this: at<br />
present, vith the exception of Germany. no country in the<br />
EU meets all the convergence criteria set out in the<br />
Maastricht Treaty for Economic and Monetary Union.<br />
Australia does.<br />
Modern Australia is a deregulated environment of low<br />
tariffs, low tax rates and low inflation.<br />
Last year~ the Australian economy grew by 6.4 per cent and<br />
we forecast growth of 5.5 per cent in 1994-95. Labour<br />
productivity increased by 4 per cent in the year to<br />
September 1994, employment grew by 4 per cent and the<br />
inflation rate was 2.5 per cent.<br />
Over the last 10 years exports of goods and services As a<br />
proportion of GOP have grown from around 14 per cent to<br />
22 per cent. Cur international competitiveness has<br />
increased by 36 per cent.<br />
Over the last 5 years exports have grown by more than<br />
7 per cent per annum. Our exports of elaborately<br />
transformed manufactures have grown at more than twice </p>
<p>TEL: ?. Mar. 95 16: 14 No. 009 P. 101<br />
The export base is diversifying rapidly in 1993-94, for<br />
instance, exports of Australian-made computers and office<br />
machinery, parts and accessories increased by almost<br />
per cent. Exports of telecommunications equipment<br />
increased by 34 per Cent in the same year.<br />
Australia has a 540 billion IT and telecommunications<br />
industry, with more computers and processing power on a<br />
per capita basis than any country other than the United<br />
Exoort earnings from our information industry at present<br />
total $ 2.6 billion, and the industry expects the figure<br />
to reach $ 10 bi llion by the year 2000 equal to our<br />
annual exports of iron ore and coal.<br />
Australia is indeed a remote continent. We are<br />
accustomed to vast distances. But this has had its<br />
advantages: it has taught us to innovate.<br />
A century ago, for instance, it made us pioneers in the<br />
science of refrigeration so that we could get our meat to<br />
European markets. it put us among the pioneers of<br />
aviation.<br />
And in more recent times it has led us to develop one of<br />
the most advanced telecommunicat ions networks In the<br />
wiorld: networks which connect nearly all the households<br />
and business premises in Australia.<br />
Australia has more telephone lines per head of population<br />
than Germany, Japan, Britain or the United States. One<br />
in eighteen Australians use mobile telephones, the second<br />
highest per capita rate in the world.<br />
The Australian telecommunications 5ector is the eighth<br />
largest in the world on per capita basis it is the<br />
second largest.<br />
These figures need to be understood in the context of the<br />
Australian services sector-, a major user of IT and<br />
telecommunications products, which accounts for 70 per<br />
cent of the total output of the Australian economy and<br />
employs three quarters of the workforce. As much as<br />
per cent of the value content of everything Australia<br />
exports involves services.<br />
After Japan, it is thes largest services sector in the<br />
Asian region, arnd Asia is a major user of Australian<br />
services.<br />
AS I said before. Asia is basically where Australia's<br />
future lies.<br />
what is equally important, Australians now recognise this<br />
fact and, with the shift in perception1 has come a<br />
rapidly expanding awareness of the potential to do<br />
business in the fastest growing markets in the world. </p>
<p>TEL: 7. Mar. 95 16: 14 N. 0,<br />
So too are there Opportunities for overseas companies to<br />
establish their businesses in Australia as a gateway to<br />
Asia and as a site for Asia-Pacific regional<br />
headquarters.<br />
Over a hundred international organisations have already<br />
done this, including such European companies as Hella of<br />
Germany, Ericsson, Vodaphone, SITA and Thomson CSF.<br />
They have found In Australia that Government policy is<br />
directed to maintaining a competitive domestic<br />
environnrt, a strong international orientation and, in<br />
particular, an intensified engagement with Asia,<br />
They will find one of the lowest company tax levels in<br />
the world; generous depreciation allowances on plant and<br />
eqwipment; exemption from dividend withholding tax; and<br />
1.50 per cent tax concessions on research and development,<br />
They will also find that Australia has a standard of<br />
living with very few equals in the region, or the world<br />
for that matter, and a quality of life which is second to<br />
none. Europeans w'ho choose to move there will find that<br />
Australians have become familiar with Asia-Pacific<br />
markets and skilled at doing bUSiness there.<br />
And if these advantages do cause international companies<br />
to decide to set up in Australia, they will find<br />
streamlined immigration procedures for their employees<br />
and tax deductions for their relocation expenses.<br />
They will also find that there are considerable<br />
advantages in working with Australia In areas of<br />
information technology and communications.<br />
For a nvmber of years now, we have been actively seeking<br />
co-operative relationships with multinational companies<br />
as a means of developing the expertise of Australian<br />
firms.<br />
Today, more than 40 multinational companies participate<br />
in a program through which they invest a percentage of<br />
their Australian sales in local joint ventures with<br />
Australian research centres, in new product development,<br />
and in assisting Australian technology firms to enter<br />
International markets,<br />
Overseas com~ panies coeitemplating a move to Australia<br />
should also bear in mind that Australia is the second<br />
biggest market for information technology and<br />
telecommunication$ in the Asian region, and that<br />
Australian governments are major customers for<br />
international IT companies. 9 </p>
<p>07/ 03 ' 95 17: a<br />
when overseas companies come to Australia, they will find<br />
that we have decided that IT and communications will be<br />
one of the nation's great industries. They will find<br />
that we are very confident of our technological<br />
capacities. In rural communications, airport design and equipment, or<br />
the design and management of nationwide telephone<br />
systems, Australian engineers number among the preferred<br />
suppliers throughout South-East Asia.<br />
But it is not only in Asia that we aim to succeed.<br />
Many of you may not be aware, for example, that<br />
reservations, tracking and booking systems for Lufthansa<br />
and other airlines are run by software developed in<br />
Australia.<br />
Or that telephone systems in Germany and other European<br />
countries rely on Austral ian-developed switching systems.<br />
Those systems are a product of expertise in ISON and data<br />
communications technology which Australia implemented at<br />
a very early stage. Indeed, we now have a highly<br />
sophisticated network with one of the most extensive<br />
optical fibre netwrorks in the world.<br />
Australia's demographic pattern is almost certainly a<br />
reason why we excel in remote communications, electronic<br />
data interchange, geographic information systems,<br />
computer systems for mining and mineral processing and<br />
satellite navigation systems.<br />
Far from the IT development centres of Europe and the<br />
United States, Australians have had to develop<br />
sophisticated solutions of their own.<br />
As a result, wie have built powerful and flexible software<br />
applications in areas such as banking, transport and<br />
retail markets; and Australian accounting, banking,<br />
insurance and treasury management packages, have become<br />
world standards.<br />
We discovered quite some time ago that living in the<br />
Southern Hemisphere had the advantage of enabling us to<br />
supply primary products to the Northern Hemisphere in the<br />
off-season.<br />
Today, the fax and modem have made us consciou5 of a<br />
different fact: that the time zone difference between<br />
Australia and Europe, which has always seemed to work<br />
against us, can now work for us because now Australian<br />
software firms can analyse problems while their European<br />
clients sleep, and send the solutions before the start of<br />
business in the morning,<br />
