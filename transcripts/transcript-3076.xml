PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,<br />
TUESDAY 20TH NOVEMBER 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ladies and Gentlemen there were a couple of things<br />
that I announced about 23 hours ago after the Cabinet meeting<br />
yesterday. I can give you a couple of others. First the appointment<br />
to the Commonwealth Banking Corporation of Mr Cliff Dolan. His<br />
appointment will take effect from the 24th. He is being appointed<br />
to succeed Mr R. D. Williams Barney Williams who, whom you<br />
remember, nas been appointed to the Australian Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Commission. Mr Dolan is Federal Secretary of the<br />
Electrical Trade Union of Australia and is senior Vice-President<br />
of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Then the matter of four<br />
weeks recreation leave, for employees in the private sector in<br />
the Territories. We are introducing an ordinance which will be<br />
gazetted of course, by the appropriate minister, to apply four<br />
weeks recreation leave for employees in the pzivate sector in the<br />
Capital Territory; official members of the Northern Territory<br />
Legislative Council will introduce an ordinance to make similar<br />
provisions for private sector employees in that territory and<br />
appropriate measures are being taken to introduce minimum periods<br />
of recreation leave in the other nonself-governing territories;<br />
that is Norfolk Island, Christmas Island and Cocos Island. There<br />
is another matter I can announce to you. We have decided to<br />
participate in the International Exposition on the Environment to<br />
be held in Spokane, Washington, between May and October next year.<br />
Discussions are proceeding between officials to determine the nature<br />
and scale of Australian participation and a report is expected to<br />
be submitted to Cabinet within the ne-xt fortnight. The exposition<br />
has been sanctioned by the Bureau of International Expositions oF.<br />
which Australia is now again a member and it is part of the 200thl<br />
anniversary celebrations of American independence. The Soviet Union,<br />
Japan, Canada, France and Mexico are participating as well as othler<br />
countries in Europe, the Pacific area and Latin America. Are there<br />
any questions.<br />
QUESTION: Will you explain why and on what information or advice<br />
the Government decided to vary the recommendation of the Tariff Board<br />
on protection of the Australian electronics industry?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It was made as a result of discussion around the<br />
Cabinet and officials were called in to advise as to the difference<br />
this would make in money terms for the various sets.<br />
QUESTION: Do you believe that the matters exposed by the Parliament<br />
early today were resolved to your personal satisfaction and in the<br />
highest traditions of the Parliament established Westminster, and<br />
do you believe that by today's vote by the Parliament, your reaction<br />
both within the Parliament and outside have been vindicated.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. You were able to see what happened last week. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
QUESTION: May I follow that up with one clarification in the<br />
House this morning Sir, you said you had apologised last week<br />
for your remarks. My understanding of it, sitting in the gallery,<br />
that you offered to apologise<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I withdrew the aside I made across the table<br />
in response to Mr Snedden. It was an aside in each case as I<br />
pointed out, because it was not heard by the Speaker, or the Clerk,<br />
or any members, or in the press gallery or by pressmen who were<br />
listening on the radio. Mr Snedden dobbed me in. I withdrew what<br />
I said. You remember he wouldn't withdraw what he-* said.<br />
QUESTION: Quite clear. This morning, I though however, you were<br />
referring to the other remarks about Dr Forbes which you said<br />
positively at one stage last week, you wouldn't withdraw, and later<br />
you said you offered to withdraw. You haven't withdrawn your remarks.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I won't say yes or no. I forget what happened.<br />
I do remember quite clearly the matter of the aside across the table,<br />
the offensive language he used and which I capped.<br />
QUESTION: You allowed Francis James a theological question. Now<br />
do you permit a gastronomical question?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, which paper do you represent? He represented<br />
a theological paper. Do you represent a church paper or do you<br />
represent a gastronomical paper?<br />
QUESTION: A gastonomic interest. Your....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wish my gastronomical interest had the same<br />
elegance as yours.<br />
QUESTION: You are very critical of some people's drinking habits.<br />
How much truth is there in the rumour that you have your own<br />
special interest in chocolate eclairs and that these are reasonably<br />
provided in -the Cabinet Room?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are no chocolate eclairs provided in the<br />
Cabinet room. I have my problems. And I don't want to admit any<br />
more weaknesses than I have to. However, you have mentioned the<br />
Cabinet and while its proceedings are secret, I can assurc you that<br />
chocolate eclairs are not provided under this government. I do admit<br />
that I eat during sitting hours.<br />
QUESTION: Chocolate eclairs?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. But you could tempt me.<br />
QUESTION: From the answer you gave to Mr Haupt's question about<br />
officials being called in to give the results bf what various rates<br />
would be on the price of television sets, can we take it from that,<br />
that that was the main consideration in Cabinet the price and price<br />
( unclear) price of television sets? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It was a very large consideration in fixing the<br />
tariff duty. As you realise, the variation between the tariff duties<br />
fixed by Cabinet and that recommended by the Tariff Board had very<br />
little consequence in terms of price.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, but what about employment effects?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It would reduce.... . It wasn't the only factor. It<br />
was a very large factor. But it would mitigate any employment<br />
effects; but I am not asserting that there would be any employment<br />
effects. I guess you have seen the Tariff Board report now. You<br />
have read it. And it is quite clear that there will be no fewer<br />
people, in the Tariff Board's view, employed in manufacturing<br />
television sets under the new duties, the reduced duties, than<br />
there were under the old duties. The reason being quite clear:<br />
that the cheaper the set, the more sets are going to be produced<br />
and sold. There will be other employment aspects. For instance,<br />
colour television requires many more people to service it, and the more<br />
sets you sell the more people will be required to service those<br />
sets. Furthermore, there will be more employment in the entertainment<br />
industry, particularly in the aspects engaged in the production of<br />
radio and television programs, if more people are able to buy sets<br />
to pick up those radio and television programs. So there will be<br />
no reduction in employment. The cheaper the sets the greater the<br />
employment is likely to be. So this was considered but it was not<br />
the main consideration, and it was not one on which the officials<br />
were asked to calculate.<br />
QUESTION: In the first three years after the introduction of<br />
colour television, it can be calculated that the cost to consumers<br />
of the Government's modification to the Tariff Board's report<br />
will be $ 36 million. That is, one dollar for every man, woman<br />
and child in Australia. The modifications were justified on<br />
defence grounds. How do you reconcile this with the following<br />
statement in the Tariff Board's report: " It would appear from<br />
advice obtained from the Department of Defence that the Board's<br />
recommendations would not significantly affect Australian defence<br />
requirements." Page 22.<br />
PRI: ME MINISTER: You have been told, I think. Anyway I will read<br />
you what we have said on the defence aspects: " The G3overnment will<br />
introduce appropriate subsidy assistance to maintain at least until<br />
the Tariff Board's report on Professional Electronic Equipment is<br />
considered by the Government." That is, the sort of equipment<br />
that is required by Defence Departments, radio stations and<br />
television stations. " The production in Au7, tralia of selected<br />
electronic components which are or could be important for their<br />
defence, telecommunications or technological significance. For<br />
example...." and there were 10 quoted there. " The precise list of<br />
components which might be covered by such a system, is to be<br />
determined by the Government after further consideration of defence,<br />
telecommunications and technological aspects. * Advice will be sought<br />
from appropriate departments and technical authorities for instance,<br />
universities and/ or consultants. The nature and extent of any<br />
subsidy assistance will be subject to appropriate ratinnalisation and<br />
re-structuring being undertaken by the industry in con siltation with<br />
the Government. The details of this assistance are tc je determined </p>
<p>-4-<br />
and announced before the end of next June. The future of the subsidy<br />
assistance introduced is to be reviewed-at the time of consideration<br />
of the Tariff Board's report on Professional Electronic Equipment."<br />
So the whole question of the defence aspects will be considered<br />
together, you will notice, with the Tariff Board's pending report<br />
on Professional Electronic Equipment.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, it can also be calculated that in the first 3 years<br />
after introduction of colour television, the Government's modification..<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not endorsing or rejecting your calculations.<br />
QUESTION: I calculate that they will reduce the sales of television<br />
sets by 100,000<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not commenting on your calculations. The<br />
fact is that television sets will be very much cheaper for individuals<br />
and. for the whole community now than they would have been if the<br />
Government hadn't changed. I am not commenting on your calculations-<br />
I am not nimble enough to do it.<br />
QUESTION: In your statement last night on the tariff cuts you<br />
said that the Government would take appropriate action to ensure<br />
that the benefits were passed on to the consumers. Who will take<br />
this action, and what do you regard is the appropriate action?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Government can determine the price of imports.<br />
And this can be done by the Prices Justification Tribunal or by<br />
the Government after consideration by the Joint Committee on Prices<br />
in the Parliament.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, you have said in thte past that you are prepared to<br />
answer questions on specific interdepartmental committees. I understand<br />
there was an interdepartmental committee which considered the<br />
tariff report on television. Will you tell us what it said, since<br />
you didn't release it with the report?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I said that I would give the membership and the<br />
charter and the timetable of such reports. I didn't say I would<br />
release the reports. This matter was raised in Cabinet and Cabinet<br />
decided not to release it. One very good reason why this or some<br />
other inter-departmental committee reports are not release, is<br />
that there are references to legal aspects and a Government naturally<br />
doesn't give the legal aspects of its decision to the public.<br />
This inter-departmental committee, as I announced in the Parliament<br />
in answer to a question last Thursday, as I recall, in answer to<br />
a question without notice last Thursday, because it was announced<br />
last June. I appointed the Standing Inter-departmental Committee<br />
on Assistance to Industries last April. The text of the letter as<br />
an arinexure to Sir John Crawford's report on a. commission for<br />
assistance to industries I forget the precise title that he gave<br />
to his report that was signed by Sir John and given to the Government<br />
and released by the Government to all members, and I think to you<br />
Ladies -id Gentlemen, last June and theexistence of this committee,<br />
of course as I recall, in a question without notice last Thursday,<br />
it was also noted in an answer I gave to a question on notice by<br />
Mr Snedden. The Interdepartmental Committee on Assistance to<br />
Industries. The membership of it was announced where it appears in </p>
<p>the Crawford Report annexure. on this occasion the SIDC comprised<br />
representatives of the Departments of the Treasury, Secondary<br />
Industry, Overseas Trade, Labour, Customs and Excise, Defence, Supply,<br />
Science, the Postmaster-General, the Cities Commission the Prime<br />
Minister and the Department of the Media, was consulted by the<br />
committee. If anybody had asked how the committee was composed<br />
for the consideration of the Tariff Board report on colour television<br />
they would have got this answer.<br />
QUESTION: I refer to your appointment of a very senior career<br />
diplomat, Sir David Anderson, to be Ambassador in Paris. Is this<br />
an indication that all is forgiven with. France over their nuclear<br />
tests and supplementary to that, in that the ICJ case comes up<br />
again next year, in what capacity will you be using the retiring<br />
Solicitor-General and what will he be paid, to conduct our case<br />
before the ICJ.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The dispute with France about her nuclear tests<br />
continue I regret to say it is undiminished. That appears from<br />
what Australia's representatives have said, and how they have voted<br />
in the current United Nations General Assembly and its committee.<br />
In other respects, relations with France are correct. The retired<br />
Solicitor-General Mr Ellicott, will be appearing for Australia in<br />
the International Court of Justice hearing of Australia's case<br />
against France, arising from the breach which we allege of France's<br />
international obligations, and in particular, the Treaty 1928. Treatyto<br />
which we are both parties. I don't know what his fee will be.<br />
But if I did know, I wouldn't tell you. You don't expect me to<br />
state what fees are of individuals.<br />
QUESTION: Back on the Tariff Board report, I am afraid. Can you<br />
explain why the Government did not accept the Tariff Board's<br />
recommendation of 25% duty. If you are saying that this Government<br />
will make colour television sets cheaper than the previous Government,<br />
why instead have you raised the duty in Cabinet to 35%. What is<br />
the reason for this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Tariff Board report recommended that there should<br />
be a 25% duty on electronic components excluding colour cathode<br />
tubes, 30$ on monochrome and colour TV and 30% on radios, radiograms,<br />
and sound recorders reproduced. It was clear that there was no<br />
great significant difference in the cost if it was made 35% for all<br />
of these. In particular you mention about the 25% duty recommended by<br />
the Tariff Board on the electronic components. The advice is<br />
that there is no substantial reason for having 25 on those particular<br />
items and 30 on the others.<br />
QUESTION: So everything is<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Everything is </p>
<p>-6-<br />
QUESTION: Just on the decison making processes of the Labor Party.<br />
Did I understand you correctly to say that Cabinet yesterday had<br />
outside advisers in during the course of the Cabinet meeting<br />
PRIME MINISTER: At one time.<br />
QUESTION: Is this the first time it has ever happened.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
QUESTION: So it is not unusual for this to occur.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, it is unusual, but it has happened with us and<br />
I am informed that it has happened quite often under preceding<br />
governments. QUESTION: On on another aspect of it, Mr Whitlam, you spoke in<br />
Cabinet last week in respect to tariff policy and the executive, the<br />
Cabinet as opposed to Caucus. However, Caucus made other important<br />
policy decisions which one might say were taken in the course of<br />
very brief debate in Caucus, such as four weeks annual leave for the<br />
private sector in the ACT and the goldmining and other mining bills.<br />
Is there any procedure within the Labor Party's decision making<br />
process for holding up hot issues so that they can be considered<br />
at a more leisurely pace, or with written submissions or does<br />
Caucus retain this right all the time to make on-the-spot decisions<br />
about major policy issues.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are Standing Committees of the Caucus, as<br />
you know, which provide for consideration of any matters which the<br />
Committees or the Caucus want to consider and that is what the<br />
Standing Orders provide that there should be consideration of such<br />
matters by the Caucus Committee. These Committees, as you know,<br />
are composed of people who nominate themselves. Every member of<br />
the Caucus can nominate himself for three Committees, but Standing<br />
Orders like any Standing Orders can be suspended and they were<br />
last week.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, could I just clarify a point on that<br />
Caucus procedure, you said in Parliament last week that you would<br />
not accept that Tariff matters should go to the Caucus before being<br />
announced in Parliament or announced generally. However, back in<br />
May on the 9th of May, there was a Caucus decision that all matters<br />
relating to changes in Tariffs, subsidies and bounties be referred<br />
to Caucus for a final decision. Will you take the same attitude<br />
in relation to subsidies and bounties that you have taken in regard<br />
to Tariffs?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Any matter which comes for a vote, or which can come<br />
for a vote, in Parliament, goes to the Caucus t~ o decide its collective<br />
attitude. I made this quite clear and there is no need for me to<br />
clarify it further, I made it quite clear in the House when I was asked<br />
the question on it last Thursday morning by one of the Liberal members. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
QUESTION: It was the timing, Sir, that was all. You pointed out<br />
last Thursday in answer to that question that you would first<br />
report to the Parliament and the Caucus later. You said that at<br />
this Press Conference last week, that was in relation to Tariffs.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That was in answer to a question, I think by<br />
Mr Maximilliam Walsh.<br />
QUESTION: Well will the same thing apply with bounties and subsidies.<br />
Will you first make the decision and then take it to the Caucus?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If they require a vote in the Parliament, I will.'<br />
There are two things. The first is, is there a matter on which<br />
people can speculate and which therefore should be considered by<br />
persons who are under obligation to keep the matters confidential.<br />
There are clear cases of that nature in respect to a budget or<br />
most Tariff Board reports. There are some Tariff Board reports<br />
where clearly the question of speculation can't arise or would be<br />
too remote to be significant. Then, clearly, if any matter can<br />
come to a vote in the Parliament, the Caucus determines its collective<br />
attitude on those matters.<br />
QUESTION: After you have made the announcement in public?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I do not need to say anything more about it.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, last week Australia was reported to<br />
abstaining from a U. N. resolution against South Africa, and I was<br />
wondering if you could reconcile this decision with your earlier<br />
remarks about South Africa in particular lendingi Australia's support<br />
to any international action to bring down the South African Government.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If you had the text here, I could show you where we<br />
regarded this as being excessive. On balance, we though~ that the<br />
resc; Lution went too far. We do not oppose, this Government does not<br />
oppose resolutions which are substantially acceptable. That is,<br />
wc do not oppose a resolution because there may be one small<br />
component which we certify as unacceptable. But if you saw the full'<br />
text you would understand why we voted in that way.<br />
QUESTION: What is the significant part of it Prime Minister, what<br />
do you regard as<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Let us look at the text.<br />
QUESTION: In the House today, Sir, you seem to have conceded that<br />
Dr Kissinger was right, and you were wrong over the issue of whether<br />
President Nixon had called the U. S. Military alert for domestic<br />
American consumption. Was this a serious diplomatic error. If so,<br />
Sir, was the error your responsibility or the responsibility of<br />
bad advice from your Department?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have got nothing to add to what I said in the<br />
Parliament. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
QUESTION: When is Mr Barnard expected to go to Washington to<br />
re-negotiate the relationship of the Australian Government to the<br />
United States Government on U. S. bases in Australia and will that<br />
involve us paying for use of bases such as North-west Cape and<br />
will it also involve us being given a guarantee that they will never<br />
be allowed to send signals there without our permission?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Mr Barnard will be visiting the United States<br />
in the recess. I think probably in January and there will be many<br />
aspects discussed. I do not propose to endorse the aspects<br />
that you have mentioned or reject them, or add to them.<br />
QUESTION: This is a follow-up to my earlier question, Sir,<br />
as I understand it, the IDC that I referred to earlier endorsed<br />
the Tariff Board's decision and I also understand that the two<br />
Departments which briefed Cabinet yesterday did not endorse the<br />
Tariff Board's deicision although they were members of the IDC;<br />
can you confirm whether that is so and can you also tell us why<br />
the other Departments of the IDC that believed in the Tariff Board's<br />
recommendations were not given the opportunity to brief Cabinet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Departments from which officers were asked to<br />
come to Cabinet to give calculations of the effect of varying<br />
Tariff duties were Prime Minister's, Secadary Industry and Customs<br />
and Excise.<br />
QUESTION: Senator Bishop is now back with us Sir, and I was<br />
wondering whether he would remain * in Repatriation or will he go<br />
to A. C. T. or what is the position, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will let you know if I have anything to say<br />
on this.<br />
QUESTION: My question is in regard to the reported resignation<br />
of Senator Cavanagh of Minister in charge of Government business<br />
in the Senate. I was wondering Sir, whether you have accepted<br />
Senator Cavanagh's resignation; if not, do you intend to accept<br />
his resignation and thirdly Sir, do you think that Senator Murphy<br />
should have consulted Senator Cavanagh before he moved the adjournment<br />
on what has now turned out to be a rather eventful Wednesday night?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I discussed this matter this morning with the two<br />
Senators you mention and I have not spoken to them since.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, you have said that you have discussed these matters<br />
with Senator Cavanagh and Senator Murphy, what was the outcome of<br />
the discussions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have not seen them since.<br />
QUESTION: Wasn't there an outcome at the time?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. </p>
<p>QUESTION: You said Sir, when Mr Johns asked what powers you would<br />
have to impose on the prices and imports of television sets,<br />
that you hi snmething such as your Committee in the House of<br />
Representatives to examine import prices, now the first report of<br />
this particular Committee has been a very mixed bag, it is a set-in<br />
point of fact that your evaluations failed to work quite significantly<br />
in the area of pharmaceuticals, and also in respect of timber,<br />
perhaps they are unsure about timber so quite clearly you<br />
really do have no powers if all you can do is report. And so, what<br />
powers would you have and are these the sort of powers you would<br />
hope to activate after your referendum?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Parliamentary Committee, like any other<br />
Parliamentary Committee, it has no executive powers at all. But<br />
like nearly every Parliamentary Committee, I think everyone which<br />
is in existence at the moment, it is composed of members from both<br />
sides of the House or in the case like this Joint Committees of<br />
each side of both Houses and it can make recommendations or findings<br />
and there can be majority and minority reports and there was on the<br />
one that you mentioned. And it is then for the Government to take<br />
executive action in the light of the Committee's findings or<br />
recommendations majority recommendations or the minority ones<br />
if it likes. The difference of opinion on the imports that you<br />
mentioned I think consisted of Mr Gorton presenting a view different<br />
to that of his colleagues. I have not followed it in any great detail,<br />
but he asserted that the findings were Government on one side and<br />
Opposition on the other. It was pointed out and then Mr Gorton<br />
acknowledged that the other Member or Members from the Oppositin<br />
supported the Government members on this matter. Mr Gorton differed<br />
from his opponents and his colleagues. </p>
