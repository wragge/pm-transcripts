STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
MEMORIES MEMORIES: JOHN HOWARD AND THE COSTING OF<br />
OPPOSITION PROMISES<br />
In expressing synthetic outrage at the Government's decision to have the<br />
Opposition's program costed by the Department of Finance, Mr Howard said<br />
to John Laws on Monday:<br />
" I did hear him say, incidentally, that in 1983 1 used the Treasury and<br />
the Department of Finance to cost the Labor Party's promises. That is<br />
not correct. I remember 1983 very clearly. I used staff in my office to<br />
cost that document."<br />
By Tuesday he was saying to Pru Goward:<br />
' Well Pru, my recollection is that the castings of the Opposition's<br />
promises in 1983 was in fact done in my office, I'm having that matter<br />
checked...<br />
I have had the matter checked. The attached excerpts from Mr Howard's<br />
press conference transcript of 21 February 1983 make it quite clear that the<br />
Public Ser-vice was extensively used by Mr Howard to cost the then<br />
Opposition's election program. They also make it clear that he publicly<br />
advocated that using the Public Service in this way was perfectly appropriate.<br />
