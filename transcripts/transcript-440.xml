Citizenship Convention 23rd January, 1962<br />
MR. DOU-ER.-Thank you, Your Excellency. I am sure<br />
we all agree that yours was a most charming and telling speech.<br />
It has been a great honour to have you here. It gives me great<br />
. pleasure to ask the right honourable the Prime Minister to ad ress<br />
the gathering. TK2 1 RIGHT HONOURABLE R. G. MIENZIES, Prime<br />
Minister of Australia.-Sir, Your Excellencies, ladies and<br />
gentlemen: I feel almost embarrassed to come, even for a few<br />
minutes, betw-en you and the memory of the remarkable speech<br />
that has been addressed to us by His -Excellency the Governor-<br />
General because I am sure it did our minds good and our hearts<br />
ood to listen to it. There is really very little that needs<br />
to be said by me on an occasion of this kind. This is the<br />
thirteenth of these conventions. I daresay you have had<br />
speeches galore made to you in the course of that time. Some<br />
of you, as I can tell by the still optimistic expression on your<br />
faces, are here not for the first time.<br />
On the last occasion when I spoke here, I took the<br />
op ortunity of saying something that I hope you will let me<br />
repeat, not in words but in substance. ior a variety of<br />
reasons, we in Australia have become accustomed to talking about<br />
iew :% ustralians. It is a very sobering reflection that if, at<br />
the end of a few years, the Governor-General became so enamoured<br />
of life in Australia that he decided to stay here, he would be<br />
a New Australian. He would be a migrant. In fact, I do not<br />
want to prejudice the interests of the Treasury, Sir, but yo.<br />
might perhaps be able to a) ply retrospectively for an assisted<br />
passage. But we here who are old Australians, are all noo"<br />
migrants. ciy grandparents came here. They migrated to<br />
Australia. Some of the more distinguished among us are able<br />
to trace our ancestry back further than that. Some of them<br />
prefer not to. But it is interesting to recall that all of us<br />
B2. </p>
<p>who are, you might say, the old brigade, are poeople whose<br />
parents or grandparents or great-grandparents or whatever it<br />
may be came out to Australia seeking a new life in a new<br />
country. They lived tlhe-n under iuch more primitive conditions<br />
than exist today.<br />
Therefore, I do not like these artificial distinctions<br />
very much. ' Jo in Australia ought to recall ns I am~ sure we<br />
do that we are a very young country. I do not uvcan that we<br />
are young geologically but we are a very young nation. It is<br />
not so long since 1788. It is only a few generations when you<br />
cote to think of it. Therefore, tmis, of all modern and<br />
civilised countries, is perhaps the youngest. le are nearer to<br />
each other, from whatever generation we cove, than are thc<br />
) eople of perhaps any othc~ r country in the world.<br />
Even in the case of G-reat Britain there are blanks<br />
in history. I have never quite discovered, Your ilxcellency,<br />
what happecned between the time when the Rom~ ans left and the<br />
Angles and the 3axons came. Thore are silent passages in<br />
history. But with. us, over this relatively short period of<br />
tin1e, there is continuity of history and a tremendous surge<br />
of growKth. All periods of our history in Australia have had<br />
their owm turbulent and someti es confused activity. " e had<br />
tha old pastoral days, the old mining days, the agricultural<br />
era and the manufacturing era. These things have come, one<br />
on top of an~ ther, an in the result, this is a country full<br />
of life and hope, achievement and ambition. It is therefore<br />
easy and, indeed, natural for us to rcceive into the<br />
population people whfo possess this sameo spirit; who are the<br />
same kind of people as those wuho originally created this<br />
spirit.<br />
B3 </p>
<p>It is easy for us to welcome them, and I believe I can say<br />
that it is easy for them to live here and to feel that they<br />
are among friene. s and living in a lively family atmosphere.<br />
We in Australia as Sir W-ins ton Churchill once<br />
reminded me, are rather disposed to conduct our political<br />
affairs with a fine eighteenth century vigour, and I dare<br />
say that that is quite right. Being before this audience,<br />
I speak no party politics. It is very seldom in Australia<br />
that you can get the great political parties the great<br />
political bodies of thought to coincide precisely on some<br />
topic, but on migration we are as one. The great movement of'<br />
migration which began in substance after the war was created<br />
by the Labour Administration and has been carried on by my<br />
own. It has, up to a point, changed the face of Australia,<br />
and it will continue to have the most profound effects on the<br />
intellectual development, the cultural standards, the<br />
scientific achievements and the social consciousness of people<br />
in Australia. We will, in 50O years' time, be a different<br />
people not detached from our old anchors, not detached from<br />
our old traditions, but enriched by new ones. We will be a<br />
different people I believe, a dynamic people a people with<br />
much to contribute to the world. One of the great factors<br />
contributing to that is that we have received so many hundreds<br />
of thousands of people from outside Australia who have come<br />
here not to be dependent and not to be different, but to be<br />
part of Australian society and contributors to the overall<br />
wealth, happiness and future of Australia. That is one<br />
reason why many of us, as we look at this remarkable process<br />
and get such comfort and such hope from it, always hope that<br />
those who come here, for example, from various countries of<br />
Europe, will not form colonies and will not segregate<br />
themselves from the rest of the community. I do not want<br />
Cl. 8. </p>
<p>U to be taken as exaggerating on this matter. I believe it is<br />
essential for Australia that there continue to be powerful<br />
Scottish and Caledonian societies. I insist on that. I am<br />
willing to concede to His Excellency tite Governor-General<br />
St. George's society. I think it is a very good thing that<br />
we from time to time remind ourselves of our inheritance, but<br />
it would be a bad thing indeed if, in a country like this,<br />
racial communities tended to separate themselves out. The<br />
great thing about building up Australia through a programme<br />
of this kind is that we should become one people. These are<br />
the immortal words of the younger Pitt: " You must be one people."<br />
And one people we must be or we shall be in perd..<br />
These splendid bodies such as the Cominonwealth<br />
Immigration Planning Council, the Commonwealth Immigration<br />
Advisory Council and the Good Neighbour Movement that is an<br />
organization which has so much to do with this matter know<br />
that so well. They have done such superb work and they know<br />
that they are not dealing with an academic problem. A<br />
convention of this kind is not an occasion for a collection<br />
of rather philosophical reflections. The real business is to<br />
see that we become, steadily, one people. You are a good<br />
neighbour because you prefer your neighbour to yourself. You<br />
are a good neighbour to a new citizen in Australia because<br />
you want him to feel that he is your neighbour and that you<br />
are his, and that you both are members of one people.<br />
Therefore, I regard the work that is being done as being of<br />
the highest order of practicality. This is a splendid thing<br />
to be doing. Looking at it with a broad view, one can say<br />
that before very long there will be occupying high office<br />
in Australia people whose names will fall unfamiliarly on the<br />
ears of the Australians of this generation. It would<br />
C24 </p>
<p>, A n be indeed one of the great triumphs of the migration policy<br />
that we so weld all new elements in with the old as to produce<br />
an alloy which will be of power and significance and achievement<br />
in our own country.<br />
We all, on whichever side of Parliament we sit, are<br />
tremendous supporters of this programme. We all are conscious<br />
of the fact that, if it were not for the work of hundreds, and,<br />
indeed, thousands, of people like yourselves, who devote much<br />
time to the practical affairs of integration in Australia, the<br />
programme could not succeed so well and could not endure so<br />
long. It does endure I repeat that word because it does<br />
not create internal hostilities. Allow it to create internal<br />
hostilities, allow it to create some sort of differences between<br />
one community and another or one race and another, and you will<br />
find the whole object of migration frustrated. The fact is<br />
that that has not happened. The fact is that, so long as there<br />
are people like you, ladies and gentlemen, who will bend your<br />
minds to these great problems, it will not happen.<br />
Sir, it is a very great pleasure to be here and a<br />
great pleasure to be allowed to say something to this<br />
distinguished audience.<br />
C3. </p>
