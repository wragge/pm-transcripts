14RIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 3 APRIL 1990<br />
Following the el' ction of the new Ministry by Caucus at its<br />
meeting today, I am pleased to announce the full list of<br />
members of the MLnistry with the portfolios which I will be<br />
recommending to the Governor-General.<br />
The swearing in of the Ministry is scheduled for 9.30 am on<br />
Wednesday 4 April.<br />
The number of Mitiisters remains at thirty, with a Cabinet of<br />
17. The list, which is attached, also provides details of<br />
representation in the other Chamber.<br />
The Ministry elected by Caucus, and the allocation of<br />
portfolios which I have made, mean that the Government is<br />
excellently equipped to pursue vigorously and creatively the<br />
priorities for our fourth term which were set out in the<br />
election campaign. The Ministry combines a very high level<br />
of experience with the introduction of talented new members.<br />
It combines stability and continuity, in several key<br />
portfolios where that is appropriate, with change and new<br />
challenge for a number of other Ministers.<br />
The major machinery of government reforms we put in place in<br />
1987 have shown significant benefits and no major adjustment<br />
has proven necessary to accommodate the significant changes<br />
of Ministers which will now take place. This well<br />
established machinery of government will yield continuing<br />
benefits in the coming term.<br />
I warmly welcome the election by Caucus of Paul Keating as<br />
Deputy Prime Minister. I look forward to the continuation<br />
of our extremely close working relationship, which will now<br />
have this added dimension and cover a wider range of issues<br />
of concern to the Government. Mr Keating will remain<br />
Treasurer in the fourth Hawke Government, a decision which<br />
will ensure thai: the highest priority continues to be given<br />
to effective maniagement of the economy.<br />
I also welcome the new additions to the Cabinet and to the<br />
Ministry. Ros Kelly, Gerry Hand, Peter Cook and Nick Bolkus now assume<br />
positions as Cabinet Ministers, and bring with them the<br />
valuable experience which they have obtained in earlier<br />
Ministerial posLtions. I am particularly pleased that we<br />
are once again able to include a woman of such outstanding<br />
ability as Ros Kelly in the Cabinet. 1 </p>
<p>There are eight n-ew Ministers Peter Baldwin,<br />
David Beddall, C. rdon Bilney, Bob Collins, Simon Crean,<br />
Wendy Fatin, Alaii Griffiths and Robert Tickner. They will<br />
each bring new s--ills, energy and enthusiasm into the<br />
Ministerial team and I am confident will make ant excellent<br />
contribution to : he Government's overall effort and<br />
performance. I wish to draw a'. tention to new assignments reflected in the<br />
attached list.<br />
Senator Tate wilLI now be the sole supporting Minister in the<br />
Attorney-General's portfolio.<br />
There will now be two Ministers supporting Senator Button as<br />
Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. Mr Crean<br />
will be responsible for Science and Technology and will be<br />
Minister assisting me for Science. This change has been<br />
made to give the greater priority to the development of<br />
Australia's scientific and technological capabilities<br />
promised by me in the election campaign. As Minister<br />
assisting me, he will amongst other things have oversight of<br />
the implementation of our pledge to establish Co-operative<br />
Research Centrei-bringing together Australian scientists of<br />
excellence from the Government, the academic community and<br />
the private seci or.<br />
The other Minisler in Industry, Technology and Commerce,<br />
Mr Beddall, wilJ have responsibility for Small Business and<br />
Customs. This reflects in part the importance which the<br />
Government attaches to the development of small business in<br />
Australia. The assignment of Mr Beddall recognises in<br />
particular the recent important report into small business<br />
which bears his name.<br />
Senator Collins. in addition to his duties in the Transport<br />
and Communicatins portfolio, will assist me on issues<br />
concerning Northern Australia. The Government regards the<br />
north as an are-i of great potential in Australia's<br />
development. S'inator Collins will not have an executive<br />
role but will in a position, as somebody fully familiar<br />
with the north, to report to me regularly on the scope for<br />
development in the region and means of overcoming<br />
impediments to s3uch development.<br />
I have also decided to appoint four Parliamentary<br />
Secretaries, under the Parliamentary Secretaries Act 1980,<br />
to myself as Prime Minister, to the Treasurer, to the<br />
Minister for Transport and Communications and to the<br />
Minister for Social Security. The list of Parliamentary<br />
Secretaries and information on their general duties is<br />
attached. I will be recommending to the Governor-General<br />
that they be appointed to the Federal Executive Council.<br />
Wi V' 2 0 </p>
<p>T1he P. ar. i. rentary S( c: retaries will assist the 141nisterc,;<br />
concerned to carry Lit their responsibilities by supporting<br />
them in tasks rangii rj from correspondence to meetings with<br />
delegations and cli ' Vt groups. In addition to these duties<br />
common to each of ti e Parliamentary Secretaries, the<br />
Ministers will be al Le to assign to them specific issues of<br />
policy development a'nd administration in the portfolio. The<br />
work will provide veluable experience for the four<br />
Parliamentary Secerctaries in the management of a portfolio<br />
without the cost involved in the appointment of further<br />
Ministers. I am confident that the new Ministerial team to be sworn<br />
tomorrow provides a combination of experience and new talent<br />
which will invigorate the Government as it begins its fourth<br />
term, and will enable it to take the decisions necessary to<br />
ensure: sound economic management<br />
determined and sustained micro economic reform<br />
environmentally sustainable economic development<br />
a more just and fair society, and<br />
the protection of Australia's political, economic and<br />
security interests in our relations with other<br />
countries. W i I </p>
