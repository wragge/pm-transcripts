    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government is pleased to announce that Mr Peter Woolcott AO has been appointed by the Governor-General as the next Australian Public Service Commissioner.</p>
<p>Mr Woolcott will commence his term on 9 August 2018 following the resignation of the Hon John Lloyd PSM.</p>
<p>Mr Woolcott is an experienced public servant with a distinguished three decade career in the Australian Public Service.  </p>
<p>He is highly regarded and respected, having served in senior diplomatic positions around the world. He has served as Australia’s High Commissioner to New Zealand (2016-2017), Ambassador for the Environment (2014-16), Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva and Ambassador for Disarmament (2010-2014), Ambassador for People Smuggling Issues (2009), and Ambassador to Italy (2004 -2007).</p>
<p>He is currently on leave without pay as Deputy Secretary from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, during which time he is serving as my Chief of Staff.</p>
<p>Mr Woolcott was appointed an Officer in the Order of Australia in 2017 for his distinguished service to public administration in the field of international relations, and as a lead negotiator in the non-proliferation and arms control fields.</p>
<p>The Government has commissioned an independent review of the Australian Public Service to ensure it is best placed to serve Australian governments and the Australian people into the future.  </p>
<p>Mr Woolcott is well qualified to help ensure the APS is fit-for-purpose in the years and decades ahead. He will work closely with David Thodey on the review and with the Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Dr Martin Parkinson, to help drive reform.</p>
<p>I thank John Lloyd for his significant contribution to the Australian Public Service - and the Australian people - over a number of decades.</p>
