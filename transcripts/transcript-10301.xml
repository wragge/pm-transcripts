9 April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
A CURRENT AFFAIR WITH RAY MARTIN<br />
E O E<br />
MARTIN:<br />
Prime Minister thanks for your time. Are you listening to those voters?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes I am.<br />
MARTIN: Well, would you agree with Tim Fischer that this whole affair has damaged your<br />
Government? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I don't think it has damaged the Government because we've done the right thing. I<br />
mean just let's understand what we've done. We have sent this matter off to the<br />
police. At all stages I have accepted legal advice unlike the former Government that<br />
disregarded legal advice to send Senator Colston to a police investigation 13 years<br />
ago. I know it is sometimes unpopular to uphold due process and defend the<br />
operations of the rule of law, but it is my responsibility to do that. I can promise the<br />
people of Australia one thing, that I will allow the full rigour of the law to operate in<br />
relation to anybody be it Senator Colston, former Senator Woods, Michael Cobb or<br />
indeed anybody else on either side of the parliament who may the subject of allegations<br />
about abuse of parliamentary entitlements. I can understand why the people of<br />
Australia are angry about these things. I regret it. The great bulk of members of<br />
Parliament are honest men and women on both sides. When something like this </p>
<p>happens we all suffer a bit, we are all diminished a bit. I understand that and it hurts<br />
me a lot that that occurs but it is not enough for me to say I am upset about it and I am<br />
hurt about it, I've got to do it properly.<br />
MARTIN:<br />
The stench has been around for months of this Colston affair. Why did it take you so<br />
long to give it to the Federal Police?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Because there is a process of sifting allegations. I mean, I want to tell you for<br />
example, the idea that the Senate President should refer some of that material which<br />
she ultimately did not ultimately she did quite quickly, possibly to the Federal Police<br />
and get legal advice on it, that was something that I proposed. Look it all stayed<br />
MARTIN: This has been a political football as you know for both parties... why don't you<br />
actually ( inaudible) and get rid of that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well Ray, my announcement last night hasn't stopped the Labor Party from continuing<br />
to kick the football. Don't imagine that simply by referring something to the Federal<br />
Police you are going to stop the Labor Party trying to score political capital. I mean,<br />
remember one thing about this. The Labor Party is particularly bitter about Colston<br />
because he resigned from the Labor Party. Now I understand that, but I think the<br />
Australian public ought to bear that in mind. But can we just go back to the base point<br />
and the base point is simply this : I promised the public of Australia that I will not<br />
stand in the way for one second of the full operation of the law of this country against<br />
any citizen, whether that citizen is a member of Parliament, a member of my Party or a<br />
member of the Labor Party or a member of the media. No matter who it is I am<br />
certainly not going to play favourites, but I do have a responsibility as Prime Minister<br />
not to suspend the rule of the law, not to get carried away and judge people...<br />
MARTIN: Prime Minister it has looked as though you have been more interested though in<br />
Senator Colston's vote and the expediency of that rather than justice and what we call<br />
old-fashioned Aussie decency.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that's not right. I mean if that had been my situation I wouldn't have acted as I<br />
did last night. </p>
<p>MARTIN: Well the report was that in fact you only acted because you understood that the<br />
Courier Mail had the story and were about the drop the letter.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that's wrong.<br />
MARTIN:<br />
When did you learn?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I learnt about it early last evening.<br />
MARTIN: And yet your Minister went Mr Jull went on television last night....<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well he didn't know about it then.<br />
MARTIN: So did you know then?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No well at 7.30pm I had heard a whisper and I was trying to get hold of letter, and as<br />
you know you never act on a whisper in Parliament House otherwise you'd be<br />
bumping into walls every hour.<br />
MARTIN: Well Mr Jull said yesterday the Colston affair makes people think that all MIPs are<br />
crooks. Would you agree?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I would put it differently. I think it does feed a cynical view in the community and I<br />
think it does make people disillusioned and I'm sorry about that because most men and<br />
women who go into politics are quite dedicated and I say that as generously of people<br />
in the Labor Party side as I do of my own, but there are some who don't. </p>
<p>MARTIN: But tonight you see you've got your chosen Deputy President of the Senate, plus a<br />
former member of your Cabinet, plus a senior member of your Government all facing<br />
fraud charges and possible jail.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well not a senior no former member of my Cabinet, a Parliamentary Secretary.<br />
Well, they are all entitled to a presumption of innocence. I mean, there was a member<br />
of the Labor Party under Mr Keating's leadership who was convicted of rape and sent<br />
to jail for ten years. Now at no stage did we endeavour to sort of spread the<br />
responsibility for that. I mean these things happen.<br />
MARTIN: But how much evidence did you want. I mean, if you look at Senator Colston's track<br />
record it goes back in fact to when you were Treasurer back in 1982, November ' 82,<br />
there was 4000-odd....<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I didn't know anything about that. I mean, I heard Mr Beazley explain his inactivity of<br />
1983 on John Laws this morning by saying that there was no public clamour to do<br />
anything. The public didn't know about it. That's why there was no clamour.<br />
MARTIN: But he had to give back over $ 20 000 in those years. I mean, how much do you want<br />
before you say well we want the police in this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I had no, Ray, I had no control in 1983. 1 was kicked out.<br />
MARTIN: But in November 1982 you were the Treasurer.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well those matters were not referred to me in 1982. 1 have no recollection of those<br />
matters having been referred to me. Now as far as I am concerned, what I have done<br />
in relation to Colston, when the allegations were made in the Senate he was asked for<br />
an explanation. He gave that explanation. The Senate President then, certainly<br />
consistent with my advice sought the advice of the Attorney General's Department as<br />
to whether the matter ought to be sent to the Federal... </p>
<p>MARTIN: So you don't think you've<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No hang on, this is whether the matter ought to be sent to the Federal Police and the<br />
Attorney General's advice to her was to wait until the other investigation had been<br />
completed and the whole thing could be looked at together. Now that was the advice<br />
that I had from the first law officer of the Commonwealth until last night and...<br />
MARTIN:<br />
We are out of time Prime Minister. Is it cynical to say that the reason you've held off<br />
is the fact that you need Senator Colston's vote?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's completely cynical. I believe I have behaved correctly. I have sent this matter<br />
off to the police in the light of the statement of Mrs Smith last night that fundamentally<br />
altered the basis on which we had previously been acting and I just say again, unlike<br />
Mr Beazley and Senator Evans, I did not disregard the advice of the head of the<br />
Attorney General's Department to send Colston for a police investigation. They did<br />
and that's the difference.<br />
MARTIN: John Howard, we've got to go, thank you for your time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's a great pleasure. </p>
