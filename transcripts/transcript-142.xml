PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
THE RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES, AT MEDAN MERDEKA BARAT<br />
DJAKARTA, SUNDAY, _ 6th DECEMBER, 1959<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen I want to introduce to you the Rt.<br />
Hon. R. G. Menzies, Prime Minister of Australia. Thank you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I suppose, ladies and genlmn yo<br />
would like to ask me questions. Do that. I may be<br />
able to answer one or two of them, but in the meantime<br />
I hope you will let me say that though it has<br />
been a very strenuous journey you people have the<br />
habit of starting the day frightfully early and it<br />
has been very hot still it has been a journey full<br />
of interest. Wie have seen something of your counitry;<br />
we have seen something of the industry and<br />
cheerfulness of your people. I have at any rate<br />
learned something of your problems, administratively<br />
and economically, and of course I have had the inestimable<br />
advantage of talks with your leading men,<br />
culminating this morning in a long talk w'ith your<br />
famous President. I think perhaps you all realise<br />
that I did not come here with a bag full of proposals<br />
to ne ,, otiate about trade or transport, or aything<br />
for that matter. I came really as a means of improving<br />
our contact with Indonesia and of learning<br />
at first hand something of your problems and of your<br />
point of view, and I think that I can say quite<br />
accurately that I am going away tomorrow very much<br />
better informed on many matters than I was when I<br />
came here. Now, if there is some particular question, perhaps<br />
somebody would put it.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, after your talks with Indonesian leaders,<br />
is Australia going to change her decision with<br />
regard to V-1est Irian?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I had a discussion this morning with your<br />
leader in which we, as I think he himself said, had<br />
a full and frank exchange of views. I explained the<br />
Australian attitude in substantially the terms in<br />
which I explained it in Parliament in Canberra after<br />
the visit of Dr. Subandrio. Your President explained,<br />
with elaboration, the reasons for his point of view<br />
and your point of view. What he said was supplemented<br />
by the Chief Minister and by Dr. Subandrio.<br />
I think the one thing that was quite common ground,<br />
and it is very important, was that the problem was<br />
one that should be solved by peaceful discussion and<br />
not by resort to force, and that statement made by<br />
the President following on one made by Dr. Subandrio<br />
will, I think, do much to improve the atmosphere in<br />
which this problem may be discussed in the future.<br />
I shall merely report back to my own Government any<br />
added material that I have, and the impressions that<br />
I have as a result of this journey. What will be<br />
the result of that, I don't know.<br />
QUESTION: Sir you have said that this should be settled<br />
peacefully. Did you, in your talks with Indonesian<br />
leaders, Lzdvance any proposals from the Australian<br />
point of view for a settlement by peaceful mcans?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I have not. I have not. This is a matter<br />
which exists as between the Netherlands and Indonesia.<br />
QUESTION: QUESIPOriNm: eM rM. i nister your discussion with </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />

QUESTION:<br />
O PRIME MINISTER:<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINIST&amp; I":<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER: President Sukarno this morning, is there still any<br />
doubt of thelndonesian policies towards West Irian?<br />
' Is there any doubt about the policy?' In other<br />
words, do I think that there has been any change in<br />
the approach of the Indonesian Government towards<br />
that problem? from the Australian side, because the<br />
President said this morning that the Government of<br />
Indonesia has made clear to your Excellency the view<br />
of the Indonesian Government as issued earlier, that<br />
this Wjest Irian question will be settled by peaceful<br />
means. Yes. Is there any doubt now with your Government<br />
about this policy?<br />
I'm sorry, I don't understand.<br />
Before this all this misunderstanding between<br />
Australia and Ind~ onesia about the policy, about the<br />
Indonesian policy for settling the question of !,, est<br />
Irian after this discussion is there still any<br />
doubt from your side?<br />
Any doubt about the problem being settled<br />
peacefully, you moan.<br />
Yes. No, I accept that: I think it will be settled<br />
peacefully. But when and how I do not know.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, our President has said and<br />
always says that Indonesia is still in evolution and<br />
the West Irian question is a colonial problem, arnd<br />
that is why it is always possible that in the future<br />
Indonesia might use armed forces to release Irian<br />
Barat. Therefore, will Australia remain passive if<br />
Indonesia uses armed forces to release Jest Irian?<br />
You know that is rather like the old question:<br />
' If you had a brother would he like cheese'. ( Laughter).<br />
Iam much too old, though, in this business to<br />
be answering hypothetical questions. ( Laughter)<br />
Mr. Prime Minister arises then out of your<br />
statement just now that in discussions on the West<br />
Irian problem is going better?<br />
Not that I know of. I am the prime Minister of<br />
Australia, not the Prime Minister of the Netherlands.<br />
You fall into Lin error if you think that this is an<br />
argument between Indonesia and Australia. We make<br />
no claim to that portion of New Guinea. Never have.<br />
Je have a bit of our oxwm which occupies us pretty<br />
busily and costs a great deal of money and effort and<br />
skill to develop.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister will you kindly tell us,<br />
after your visit, will the Australian nation give<br />
more understanding to Indonesia's claim for ilest<br />
Irian? Sorry, I did not hear him. </p>

QUES T; ON:<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTEli. ( repeated by Mr. Heydon)<br />
Well1, as I said just now, I have learned a<br />
little myself and when I go back I will convey my<br />
impressions of what I have learned to my colleagues<br />
in the Australian Government.<br />
Will you be successful in this?<br />
I beg your pardon. I hope I will be successful<br />
in making them understand me, but if you want to know<br />
what the result of that will be, or if you want to<br />
build up some expectation that it will be exciting,<br />
I don't know.<br />
Is your Govew.. nment, Sir, still committed to<br />
handing over W~ est Irian as a trust territory to the<br />
United Nations?<br />
Is my Government what?<br />
. still committed to changing i1est Irian into<br />
a United Nations trust territory. There was a report<br />
sme months ago in the Indonesian press that the<br />
Australian Government wants to turn the 4Jest Irian<br />
territory as a United Nations trust territory.<br />
I am sorry, I did not see that report.<br />
It came from Canberra.<br />
Oh, but that does not necessarily mean it was<br />
true. ( Laughter) My Government has not put forward<br />
such a proposal.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, would you please say whether<br />
Australia would be interested in using her good<br />
offices in suttling this issue peacefully.<br />
Look, I think I've said all I can say on this<br />
matter and I am not going to engage in a series of<br />
speculations about it. This is a problem of considerable<br />
importance and some delicacy, and I don't<br />
propose to add to what I have just said about it.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, Sir, in discussing international<br />
problems, was anything said about the attitudes<br />
of Indonesia and Australia to the summit conference<br />
between East and West?<br />
Oh, no, no. I had no discussions about a summit<br />
conference, no. My own views on that matter, I think<br />
are probably pretty well known. I had no discussion.<br />
Was there any discussion about the action of<br />
Communist China during the past year in your talks<br />
with the President this morning?<br />
No. To return to the question of We-Ist Irian again.<br />
You said that it was a mattor between the Dutch and<br />
Indonesia. Dr. Subandrie yesterday said that the<br />
passive attitude of Australia would constitute a step<br />
forward. By saying that this is a matter to be discussed<br />
between the Netherlands and Indonesia, are you<br />
saying that Australia will remain passive?<br />
I have said all I propose to say on that subject. </p>
<p>QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER:<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER:<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER:<br />
QUESt ION:<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTEi:<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER:<br />
QUESTIONs PRIME MINISTER: Mr. Prime Minister there has been a rpport that<br />
the possibility of President Sukarno visiting Australia<br />
has been discussed at Merdeka Palace.<br />
I think that is a matter really which we ought<br />
to leave to the President himself. I have certainly<br />
made it quite clear that should he find it possible<br />
to visit Australia, he would be warmly welcomed and<br />
the visit could do nothing but good; but of course<br />
he is a very busy man with enormous responsibilities<br />
and it is very difficult in those circumstances for<br />
anybody to say off-hand and quickly if and when,<br />
but you may take it that the invitation is open.<br />
May I ask your impressions of President Sukarno?<br />
That's rather a urly4 one as we say. As a<br />
matter of fact I have never met your President before<br />
and, if it is of any interest, and I can say it without<br />
impertinence, I have been very greatly impressed<br />
by him. I think he is a man of remarkable personality<br />
and he has a superb place in the history of your<br />
country, and therefore I felt it was a great honour<br />
to meet him and I got nothing but benefit from my<br />
discussions with him.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, after having discussed<br />
friendlily with our Goveinmcnt and explained your<br />
attitude to the press, I do not want to argue with<br />
you but to learn your views. Now permit me to ask<br />
you this question. What are the real reasons that<br />
Australia still recognises the Dutch sovereignty of<br />
dest Irian the real reasons?<br />
You didn't hear what I said before, did you?<br />
( laughter) It has been announced in the local press that<br />
you and the authorities of Indonesia would be discussing<br />
the problem of security. Is it true, or is<br />
it false, and what kind of security, what country<br />
and from what?<br />
It has been said we would be discs sing the<br />
problem of security?<br />
Yes, that was the report.<br />
Well, we had no discussions about the problem<br />
of socurity. I have some views on it myself. The<br />
one kind of security that is needed in the free<br />
world is security .6ainst Communist aggression.<br />
Do you mean Communism as an ideology or some<br />
particular country?<br />
Communism as a spe. cific modurn form of treason,<br />
eating into every country, trying to . dermine its<br />
capacity, trying to spread its power as a result.<br />
, Jo have very strong views on this matter. I imagine<br />
a number of people here have too.<br />
Did you discuss any question of economic aid,<br />
flestern economic aid<br />
Our discussions on the economic field were fairly<br />
general. dfe had no specific ideas. I think I can say<br />
that woe, on both sides, we felt that there would be </p>
<p>QUESTION:<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER:<br />
QUESTION:<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER: enormous advantages in what is called " technical<br />
aid" in the receipt and training of students, in the<br />
providing, wherever we can, of experts, as we have<br />
indeed done in the past, in order to help in economic<br />
development. That is, I think, one of the most<br />
fruitful aspects of economic co-operation that has<br />
been devised and I would like to see it extended.<br />
But I had no specific discussions as to how and<br />
where. There is just one question left. Mr. Prime<br />
Minister, can you tell us what your talk with<br />
General Nasution was yesterday because I heard that<br />
you had discussed abroad talk yesterday with<br />
General Nasution, the Chief of our Army.<br />
I had a very interesting talk with the General.<br />
He was giving me an account of the various limited<br />
campaigns that are , oing on in various parts of<br />
Indonesia and we discussed that kind of thing.<br />
But what else? Did you offer anything for<br />
training, for army training, in Australia?<br />
No, I made no offer. I made some enquiries,<br />
got some answers and said that I would discuss<br />
those matters when I returned home. But there was<br />
no offer on either side.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, after you have talked with<br />
our leaders you would mind telling us your views<br />
on Indonesia's position as towards the question of<br />
peace Asia also the security of Australia.<br />
I think that Australia has a very profound interest<br />
in the prosperity and peaceful living of Indonesia.<br />
It is entirely putting it from a quite<br />
selfish point of view. It is entirely in our interests<br />
that that country should develop a first-class<br />
administrative system and great economic stability<br />
because, of course, I believe . mong other things,<br />
that if Indonesia can establish herselif in that way,<br />
and I am sure she can, with work nd thought, then<br />
of course the whole attitude of the people will be<br />
in the direction of peace. They won't be themselves<br />
tempted by doctrines which are of a more<br />
aggressive kind. They will in fact grow as a large<br />
and powerful and peaceful neighbour, a close neighbour<br />
of Australia on our north. From our point of<br />
view, everything that will make Indonesia peaceful<br />
and prosperous is a good thing.<br />
Last question please.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, may we heacr your formula<br />
for success during your trip to Indonesia?<br />
I don't know that I have a formula. ( Laughter)<br />
I just said " Good day" to people in a genial fashion,<br />
and they said " Good day" to me. ( Laughter) It is<br />
not a bad formula after all.<br />
