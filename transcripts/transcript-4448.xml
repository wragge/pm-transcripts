PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 24 JULY 1977<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The pace and nature of change in modern life can cause special<br />
kinds of community problems and special responsibility for<br />
Governments. Nowhere is this change more direct in its effect<br />
than it is with young men and women.<br />
Trends to smaller families, longer formal education, more females<br />
working outside the home and evolving lifestyles all have direct<br />
impact on the ability of the young to adapt and handle these new<br />
pressures. Technological change of course has immediate and<br />
often dramatic effect. Many business firms are replacing juniors<br />
with computors, or with automated assembly line machinery, so<br />
the problem of finding jobs adds to social pressure.<br />
Today, the problems which adolescents have of identifying<br />
their goals and working towards them become increasingly<br />
difficult, and at the end of the road the jobs are harder to<br />
find. There is concern about the impact of Aboriginal welfare programmes<br />
on the ' problems of Aboriginal students who have been encouraged<br />
to stay at school and now find like other young people that<br />
the expected rewards are harder to attain.<br />
in the universities there is concern about student extremists whose<br />
support for radical political causes and manipulation of student<br />
elections has lead to charges of intimidation and violence.<br />
Most students at university are conscientiously working towards<br />
the goal of higher education, yet extremists given them a<br />
bad name. Some young people seek their recreation in the open<br />
air, on trail bikes or find group identification in motor bike<br />
clubs. The overwhelming majority organise themselves well with<br />
a very real concern for other people in the community. Yet<br />
sometimes they may find themselves all denounced from bench or<br />
pulpit because of the actions of a very small group that might<br />
beat up streets on high-powered super bikes.<br />
So the situation that the young Australians are placed in today<br />
cannot be ignored by governments. The Federal Government is aware<br />
of its responsibility to the young. / 2 </p>
<p>An Office of Youth Affairs has been established in the Department<br />
of Environment, Housing and Community Development. It has direct<br />
access to the Minister on all matters of youth policy.<br />
A full time Director of the Office will soon be appointed and I<br />
expect the Office to reach its full staff capability within a few<br />
months. Meanwhile, it is actively working on a number of projects<br />
following discussions with Commonwealth, State and local government<br />
bodies and voluntary organisations-concerned with youth affairs<br />
in all states.<br />
The Office-has given immediate priority to the study of a number<br />
of key questions.. It will encourage. the provision of integrated<br />
services at a local community level. by local government and<br />
non-government agencies. It will study the funding of national<br />
secretariats of community-sponsored youth agencies. It will develop<br />
a " 1conference" l approach togovernment consultation with youth.<br />
It will examine the adequacy-of statistics required for the<br />
planning of youth-services and will look at the special problems<br />
in the change from school to a work environment.<br />
In other words, it will act as a bridge between the Federal Government<br />
and all these organisations both government and communityinvolved<br />
in any way with youth activities. It will provide the<br />
government with a-ready . and continuous means of communication<br />
with young-people and all those who work with them.<br />
The Office itself will be staffed with young people and others with<br />
specialist-experience.<br />
In many ways it is easy for government and politicians to talk about<br />
these kinds of social problems'. It is easy to refer to solutions<br />
to ' deep-seated' structural and long term problems. But maybe<br />
this is small comfort to young people trying to cope with the<br />
pressure and problems of life in the modern community.<br />
All of us politicans, bureaucrats, teachers, judges and<br />
law enforcers can show greater understanding and tolerance.<br />
We can act with more compassion having regard to the way in which<br />
life's pressures do bear particularly heavily-on young men and<br />
women. Governments can play a part. The Office of Youth<br />
Affairs is.. an attempt to at-least make a coordinated start to<br />
seeing how-problems can be solved.<br />
But governments can only do-so much. It is up to the communityand<br />
particularly community leaders to play a responsible role.<br />
Our country's future depends on the way we tackle the task.<br />
