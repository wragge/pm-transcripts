<p>FOREWORD<br />
The Stan Kelly Memorial Lecture has been generously endowed by Mr. Bert Kelly,<br />
modest member and modest farmer, in memory of his father William Stanley Kelly.<br />
It is customary in this introduction to run through the distinguished career of Stan<br />
Kelly South Australian farmer, member of the Tariff Board through the 1930' s,<br />
member in some cases chairman of many government and other committees,<br />
and most importantly champion of free international trade. But I prefer to refer to a<br />
newspaper which, I must confess, I have read only once Stock and Land". Along<br />
with other better known publications, this carries the modest farmer column but,<br />
unlike others, doesn't prune it. So I quote from the August 15 issue:<br />
" When my father, Stan Kelly, died in 1969, Sir John Crawford, who<br />
knew him well, told me that I should endow a biennial lecture in my<br />
father's memory. My father had been through the tariff mangle in no<br />
mean manner. Sir John knew something of the pressures that Stan Kelly<br />
had to withstand and without any economic training. This is why he said<br />
I should endow the Kelly lecture. Unfortunately I did not do this<br />
immediately. I was a minister at the time and I kidded myself that I was<br />
too busy.<br />
But in 1975, when I was lying in my swag on the Birdsville Track,<br />
looking up at the stars and thinking about the transient nature of human<br />
affairs, I suddenly decided to do my belated duty and endow the lecture.<br />
My main motive was to do my best to see that Stan Kelly's work trying to<br />
reduce trade barriers did not falter for lack of understanding in the<br />
future. So the lecture was endowed with the stated aim of striving for the<br />
reduction of trade barriers."<br />
The agreement with the Economic Society states that the lecturer need not be well<br />
known. Indeed one of the purposes of the series is to give a voice to someone not so<br />
well known. We have had some difficulty in meeting this criterion. Past lecturers<br />
have been Sir John Crawford and Mr. John Uhrig they spoke in Canberra and,<br />
since the lecture moved to Victoria, the Secretary to the Treasury and the Governor<br />
of the Reserve Bank. And this year we have Mr. Hawke, whom one could hardly call<br />
an unknown.<br />
In his column Bert Kelly said how proud he was when he heard that the Prime<br />
Minister was to deliver this year's lecture. We, in the Economic Society, are also<br />
proud and delighted to be presenting the address. R. H. Snape<br />

<p>INTRODUCTION<br />
I know of Stan Kelly from a mutual friend between our two generations, John<br />
Crawford. Sir John's Inaugural Stan Kelly Memorial Lecture in 1977 laid out some<br />
ideas on which we later worked together in the Study Group on Structural<br />
Adjustment. I like what I know of Kelly a farmer who gave much of his life to public<br />
administration, including on the Tariff Board in those terrible years from 1929 to<br />
1940, and as an adviser to the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner during and<br />
immediately after the war. I like the way that Stan Kelly recognised the dangers of<br />
excessive protection in a protectionist era, but sought the moderate and gradual<br />
curbing of excesses rather than impractical, radical changes.<br />
There are many ways in which the steady progress we are making today in building<br />
a more dynamic Australian economy through increasing its international orientation<br />
is indebted to the work of Kelly and a small number of others, who questioned the<br />
role of high protection when its tide was still rising in Australian political<br />
thought. One of Stan Kelly's legacies to Australia was, of course his son Bert. Bert Kelly<br />
occupied the tragic place in Australian history of a farmer who understood the<br />
economic effects of protection, from 1958 sitting on the back bench of aconservative<br />
Government whose trade and industry policies were run by Jack McEwen. That he<br />
stuck to his guns through all those years wvith rarely a ray of hope says a great deal for<br />
his strength of character or, as Mavis would probably say, for his sheer farmbred<br />
obstinancy! SUSTAINING ECONOMIC GROWTH<br />
A gathering like this, organised by the Victorian Branch of the Economic Society,<br />
is not an occasion for partisan comment. The only political comment that I will make<br />
will be of a scientific kind involving, for example, the testing of political<br />
forecasts. Five weeks ago I presented the annual forecasting prizes to the New South Wales<br />
Branch of the Economic Society. The New South Wales Branch was discreet enough<br />
to withhold information on the content of forecasts, but from conversations with<br />
participants it seems that the best exchange rate predictions a year ago were those<br />
which had our dollar rising by the smallest amounts.<br />
Political forecasting is a bit more accurate. Early this year I predicted that the<br />
ideological tensions within the Liberal Party would soon erupt into open disputation<br />
about the Leadership. As we all know that prediction, which I shared with others, has<br />
been dramatically proven correct today.<br />
It will be of immense interest now to those of us concerned with economic policy to<br />
see how the ideological forces which gave rise to today's events manifest themselves<br />
in the Opposition's approach to fundamental economic issues.<br />
Over the past few months we have seen the current Opposition support needsbased<br />
welfare then oppose the Assets Test; support the introduction of more<br />
international market discipline into highly protect~ ed Australian industry and then use<br />
its numbers in the Senate to defeat the Kerin Dairy Plan; support the free play of<br />
market forces and then block legislation designed to take the allocation of petroleum<br />
exploration licences out of the hands of bureaucrats into a competitive market; and<br />
support lower deficits but oppose attempts to reduce expenditure where it has no<br />
strong justification in economic efficiency or equity, such as with the Senate's </p>
<p>rejection of our amendments to some more-than-intended Veterans' entitlements<br />
resulting from judicial decisions.<br />
These are the sorts of issues which will test the rhetoric of the new Opposition<br />
leadership. No doubt we will all watch to see how it acts. Whatever happens in these<br />
matters, it has been the policies of this Government which have turned around the<br />
economy and restored economic growth. I believe that I am entitled to claim on this<br />
record that Australia's hopes of building a new era of sustained economic growth<br />
depend on the present Labor Government.<br />
This is a heavy responsibility, and one that we accept as the core of our mandate<br />
from the Australian people. Australia can be a successful society only in the context<br />
of sustained economic growth. The Labor Government is committed to progress<br />
towards ideals that can be broadly described as social democratic -ideals that<br />
include equality of opportunity, the removal of poverty, the raising of living standards<br />
for ordinary Australian families, all within a political framework of individual<br />
freedom and parliamentary democracy.<br />
None of this can be advanced far without sustained economic growth.<br />
Only sustained, strong economic growth can reduce unemployment to<br />
acceptable levels.<br />
Only sustained economic growth can support adequate provision for Australians<br />
who, but for the intervention of govermecnt in directing community resources to<br />
them, would live in intolerable poverty.<br />
And only sustained economic growth can deliver rising living standards over time<br />
for ordinary Australian families whether through higher pay, or the provision of<br />
the better education, health and social infrastructure that are essential ingredients of<br />
genuine equality of opportunity.<br />
While growth is essential for progress towards the goals of Australian social<br />
democrats, it is not a goal that divides Australians politically. Our common interest<br />
in growth allows us to seek consensus on many issues of economic policy, through<br />
analysis of the effectiveness of policies in promoting growth.<br />
While economic growth is a platform upon which we can all stand, in a democratic<br />
society like Australia, many interest groups, and coalitions within the electorate,<br />
have the power to determine what is possible in the way of policy innovation<br />
legitimately, if often inconveniently, and sometimes outrageously, to the detriment of<br />
economic growth.<br />
I believe that a social democratic government in Australia, a Labor<br />
Government is better able to appeal to the broad national interest in fairness, as<br />
well as the national interest in economic growth, to defeat vested interests and other<br />
barriers to progress. Various groups in society will use their democratic powers and<br />
rights to veto change that is essential for growth unless there is widespread<br />
acceptance and understanding that the benefits of growth are distributed<br />
equitably. For this condition to be met, there must be mechanisms often fiscal and other<br />
mechanisms directed by government to distribute. equ it ably the benefits of growth.<br />
And there must also be mechanisms for community discussion and consultation<br />
within which widespread community support if you like, consensus can be built<br />
for growth-oriented policies.<br />
So far, the Government's record stands up pretty well. We have so far been<br />
responsible for three budgets. In 1983-84 non-farm output expanded by 7.9 per cent<br />
over the course of the year and by 3.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis. Last year,<br />
non-farm growth exceeded 5 per cent on both bases. Current forecasts indicate that </p>
<p>non-farm growth will again reach 5 per cent in 1985-86. Non-farm growth did not<br />
reach 5 per cent year-on-year and only once reached 5 per cent in the course of the<br />
year, during our Liberal-National Party predecessors' seven years in office. By the<br />
end of this year, the economy will have expanded more in three years than in seven<br />
and a half years under our predecessors.<br />
So far so good.<br />
But the real test is whether strong growth can be sustained over the long period<br />
necessary permanently to cut the evil of unemployment down to manageable<br />
proportions, and to give all Australians the higher living standards that our resources<br />
and skills have placed within our reach.<br />
Tonight I will describe some of our thinking about policies for growth; where we<br />
have got to in implementing new policies; and something of the agenda for future<br />
action. But first I would like to say something about where we have come from.<br />
Past Performance<br />
Even during what now seem to have been halcyon days of economic prosperity<br />
between the end of the Second World War and the early 1 970s, Australia's growth in<br />
real GDP per capita was unimpressive on a world scale.<br />
During the 1 970s, Australia's economic performance deteriorated markedly.<br />
Growth in real GDP per capita averaged only 1.3 per cent for the period 1973 to<br />
1979 and then a bare 0.1 per cent per annum between 1979 and 1982.<br />
Simultaneously our inflation and unemployment rose sharply, proportionately more<br />
than in most OECD countries.<br />
The economic environment in Australia in the post-war period, and particularly<br />
since the early 1970s, has not been conducive to strong and sustained growth in our<br />
capital stock, employment and productivity.<br />
It is now clear that even the relatively modest growth performance of the 1 950s<br />
and 1960s was purchased partly at the expense of future growth potential. A<br />
significant part of our growth in the early post-war decades derived from investment<br />
to supply protected domestic markets. The adverse consequences of this were not<br />
evident while the investment itself was taking place. But it locked much of Australian<br />
industry into fragmented production, high costs, and insulation from competitive<br />
pressures. In other industrial countries, liberalisation of manufactured goods trade in the<br />
1 960s made these industries more sensitive to opportunities for expansion based on<br />
exports, for application of superior technology, and for managerial improvement<br />
more generally.<br />
We can all now see that the inward-looking post-war development strategies were<br />
a mistake. One of the lessons of the past decade is that we can no longer carry the costs of<br />
mistakes of this kind. iI<br />
The era of steady strong expansion of total world demand for the output of our<br />
most productive industries, for example in agriculture and mining, is long past.<br />
There are still opportunities for us in the international economy which, if utilised<br />
effectively, can support sustained strong growth at home.<br />
But we cannot rely on a rapidly growing world economy or the discovery of new<br />
natural resources to lift our performance sufficiently to make concerted inroads into<br />
unemployment while, at the same time, maintaining the living standards of the<br />
employed. If ever we were " The Lucky Country", we cannot afford to remain the<br />
Happy-go-Lucky Country that Donald Home described two decades ago. We must<br />
work to create our own success. </p>
<p>Improving Australia's Performance<br />
Sustiined strong growth requires consistent and mutually supportive macroeconomic<br />
and resource allocation policies. Both are essential. Weakness in one can<br />
destroy any achievements in the other.<br />
Macro-economic Environment<br />
The Labor Government set out to lift Australia's long-term performance at a time<br />
when there were major macro-economic imbalances in the economy.<br />
We deliberately turned our backs on prescriptions that depended on first<br />
correcting these imbalances. We deliberately rejected fightling inflation first..<br />
As the Treasurer likes to say, we set our sails for growth, believing that we could<br />
best address the structural imbalances in the process of on-going growth.<br />
But we never did kid ourselves that the structural imbalances were<br />
unimportant. First, there was the huge prospective budget deficit amounting to about 5 per cent<br />
of prospective GDP for 1983-84.<br />
Second, there was a lack of international competitiveness across large parts of our<br />
export and import-competing industries, reflecting the combined effects of<br />
entrenched high inflation, deliberate over-valuation of the Australian dollar ( as<br />
acknowledged by former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser), and mediocre<br />
productivity performance. And reflecting all of these factors, there was a huge<br />
current account deficit, at 3.9 per cent of GDP in 1982-83, one of the highest in the<br />
OECD, even when demand was exceptionally weak in the depths of recession. The<br />
large current account deficit was associated with increases in foreign debt which<br />
threatened sooner or later to become unsustainable.<br />
Closely related to these structural weaknesses were high interest rates and high<br />
real unit labour costs, contributing to historically low rates of investment.<br />
All of these factors were in the minds of Paul Keating and myself, alongside the<br />
short-term foreign exchange crisis, when the dollar was devalued by 10 per cent two<br />
days after our election to office. Starting with a large current account deficit, our<br />
competitiveness had to improve if we were to get the economy moving with<br />
expansionary policies.<br />
Under the managed exchange rate system that we inherited, the initial<br />
depreciation did not hold. That pointed to a weakness in that system, which was<br />
removed decisively with the floating of the dollar in December 1983.<br />
The floating dollar has facilitated the adjustments in competitiveness that were<br />
necessary to support sustained growth in the Australian economy at rates faster than<br />
in the rest of the world.<br />
Of course, dollar depreciation only converts a balance of payments problem into<br />
both a balance of payments and an inflation problem, without any sustained<br />
improvement in competitiveness, unless it is supported by moderate wages<br />
growth. The agreement announced yesterday between the A. C. T. U. and the Government<br />
provides the basis for the necessary wage moderation, including through discounting<br />
the 1985 C. P. I. increases for indexation purposes by two percentage points, and<br />
delaying and moderating the claims made in the riational productivity case.<br />
Moderate wages growth along these lines is absolutely necessary to the<br />
maintenance of strong growth in our current circumstances.<br />
Moderate wages growth along these lines is good for all Australians, but especially<br />
those who benefit directly from the creation of half a million jobs in three years and </p>
<p>continued strong employment growth after that an economic benefit unrivalled in<br />
our history.<br />
Moderate wage growth along these lines at a time of strong expansion of output<br />
and employment, represents an outcome that would be impossible under any<br />
alternative approach to economic policy in Australia, without the Prices and<br />
Incomes Accord.<br />
The improvements in competitiveness resulting from depreciation and wage<br />
moderation should allow continued strengthening of the current account of the<br />
balance of payments in the course of strong growth.<br />
It was oair confidence in the Accord that permitted us to embark on expansionary,<br />
growth-oriented fiscal and monetary policies when we came to office.<br />
But from the beginning, it was recognised that the large fiscal stimulus would need<br />
to be hauled in as recovery strengthened and broadened to the private sector. This is<br />
reflected in the progress we have made in reducing the budget deficit, by over half to<br />
little more than 2 per cent of GDP in the two years to 1985-86.<br />
This progress on the Commonwealth deficit has been supported by co-operation<br />
with the States in the Premiers' Conference and Loan Council, to reduce the total<br />
public sector borrowing requirement as a proportion of GDP by over two and a half<br />
percentage points in two years.<br />
Monetary policy has been designed consistently to support strong growth but not<br />
any acceleration of inflation. The floating dollar has greatly assisted the<br />
implementation of monetary policy towards these objectives.<br />
Some doubts were expressed earlier this year about whether monetary policy<br />
really was consistent with our anti-inflationary objectives. The doubts derived<br />
mainly from the distortions that financial deregulation has introduced into<br />
measurement of the monetary aggregates. The Treasurer and I have put some effort<br />
into explaining our firm monetary policy in recent times, and the doubts have<br />
diminished. Events are vindicating our decision to address structural imbalances in the course<br />
of growth rather than as a pre-condition for expansionary policies.<br />
This is evident in the gains that have already been made on the Budget deficit and<br />
competitiveness. Real unit labour costs are back to the levels of one and a half<br />
decades ago. Interest rates remain high, but at least the pressures exerted by<br />
Government borrowing are diminishing.<br />
The framework of macro-economic policy that has been established, incorporating<br />
the Accord, the floating dollar and the Trilogy of fiscal commitments, are delivering<br />
settings of wages, monetary and fiscal policy that are consistent with sustained<br />
It has also removed major areas of uncertainty and arbitrariness from crucial areas<br />
of macro-economic policy, and thus contributed to a more stable environment for<br />
investment and production decisions.<br />
Private investment remains too low, but is responding to the improved<br />
business environment.<br />
Micro-economic Environment<br />
In addition to the more stable macro-economic conditions to which I have already<br />
referred, there is no doubt that the low levels of disputation in the context of the<br />
Prices and Incomes Accord have allowed underlying economic realities to play their<br />
proper role in investment and production decisions.<br />
Most importantly of all, the dramatic recent improvements in international </p>
<p>competitiveness provide Australia with a unique historical opportunity to lift its<br />
manufacturing and service sectors out of inward-looking production into the<br />
international economy.<br />
Beyond these ways in which macro-economic outcomes affect micro-economic<br />
performances, we are taking steps to:<br />
improve the environment for productivity growth;<br />
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector, and<br />
develop a more outward looking industry policy.<br />
While each of these may be examined separately there are a number of str'ong<br />
linkages between them. In the past the productivity performance of Australian<br />
industry has been substantially conditioned by an excessively inward orientation.<br />
The effect of this has been to mute the incentives to find and exploit world markets<br />
which have the greatest growth potential. It has impeded productivity growth and led<br />
to a decline in competitiveness. It has also discouraged the development of new<br />
products, new production techniques and new work practices.<br />
Finally it has discouraged flexibility and adaptation in the organisation of many of<br />
our industries. Introduction of these innovative and dynamic qualities will provide an<br />
impetus to productivity growth.<br />
At the same time industry policy has provided incentives to pursue profit<br />
opportunities by seeking to obtain the benefits of Government assistance, at the<br />
expense of the creation of new wealth through economically productive<br />
activities. IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENT FOR<br />
PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH<br />
Human Capital Formation and Application<br />
The formation and application of human capital are vital elements in any strategy to<br />
improve and enhance our economic growth performance. Advances in these areas<br />
are intimately linked to the quality and flexibility of the labour which is available for<br />
use by industry: a workforce which is highly educated and trained will facilitate the<br />
development, adaptation and diffusion of more productive techniques and the more<br />
flexible and efficient utilisation of labour and capital by industry.<br />
Changes to our educational and vocational training systems are necessary. Major<br />
reforms initially will focus on the school sector.<br />
The Karmel Report has emphasised that changes in curricula, course content,<br />
progression and certification processes are needed if schools are adequately to fulfill<br />
their critical role in the nation's social and economic development.<br />
The report acknowledges that a much greater proportion of young Australians<br />
have to complete full secondary schooling and receive a broad general education, if<br />
young people are to realise their potential and fulfill their key role in the further<br />
social, cultural and economic development of Australia. A broader school based<br />
education is essential.<br />
The implementation of Karmel's recommendations for the school system will<br />
complement our traineeship initiative, announceol'in the Budget. To complement<br />
both these measures my Government has taken action to reduce the chances that<br />
young people will be precluded for financial reasons from participating in post<br />
compulsory schooling or training.<br />
Supporting these initiatives, the Government has taken steps to increase the<br />
number of places and improve and increase the relevance of training within the<br />
TAFE sector and across the range of tertiary institutions. </p>
<p>Innovation, Research and Development<br />
Innovation, technical progress and the development of export markets depends in<br />
large measure on Research and Development and technology transfer.<br />
Aggregate spending on R&amp; D in Australia is low. While the Government<br />
contribution is commensurate with other developed countries, industry fuinding and<br />
performance of R&amp; D is low. The proportion of research funds devoted to<br />
experimental development is low.<br />
Australia has some important advantages in research and development activity.<br />
The education system produces capable research workers. The cost of R&amp; D in<br />
Australia is not high.<br />
To break down longstanding weaknesses in our applied research effort, for five<br />
years from 1 July this year, 150 per cent of expenditure on research and development<br />
within Australia will be deductible for taxation purposes.<br />
We are seeking to improve the manner in which some of the direct public<br />
assistance is provided. Efforts are being made to increase interaction between<br />
industry and the public research institutions, such as CSHI. O and universities.<br />
Remaining weaknesses in our applied technological effort have much to do with<br />
the past development of an inward looking industrial structure. This has dulled<br />
competitive pressures for adoption of superior technology.<br />
Labour Market<br />
We all agree that adaptable labour markets can assist in promoting efficient use of<br />
capital and labour resources and their more rapid accommodation to economic<br />
change. The setting of wage differentials has the potential to influence the efficiency and<br />
adaptability of the labour market. But flexibility in these differentials is less<br />
important the more mobile and flexible is the labour force itself.<br />
In contemplating labour market reform, we are wise to recognise that increased<br />
wage flexibility contains a risk of destabilising aggregate wages and the conduct of<br />
macro-economic policy. If necessary, we are prepared to give away small advantages<br />
of marginally increased relative wage flexibility to preserve the greater benefit of<br />
overall wage moderation.<br />
Taxation and Growth<br />
In the first of my trifecta of Economic Society speeches this year, to the Canberra<br />
Branch in March, I said that tax reform directed towards improvement in our growth<br />
performance must come to grips with four flaws in the current taxation system.<br />
To quote from that speech, which was published in the Economic Record in<br />
June: ,, IThe tax review] must address the widespread avoidance and evasion,<br />
especially by people with income well above the Australian average It must<br />
address poverty traps. The tax review must address the unfairness and the<br />
associated effects on work effort of workers on average incomes paying the<br />
current 46 per cent marginal tax rate on incomes above $ 19,500.<br />
And . the review must address the powerfiul distortions to resource<br />
allocation inherent in a 60 per cent marginal tax rate cutting in at less than<br />
twice average weekly earnings, within a system that provides ways for turning<br />
taxable income into untaxed benefits."<br />
While the Government's preferred option did not survive the Tax Summit, the tax<br />
package to be announced soon will make substantial progress towards these<br />
objectives. It will significantly improve the environment for economic growth in<br />
Australia. </p>
<p>IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS<br />
OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR<br />
Quite apart from its role in establishing the macro-economic and regulatory<br />
environment, the public sector is such an important feature of the Australian<br />
economy that the efficiency of its own operations has large implications for our<br />
overall economic performance.<br />
I believe that this Government has gone further than any of its predecessors in<br />
scrutinising public expenditures, with a view to testing their contribution to improved<br />
efficiency in the economy, and improved equity.<br />
The issue of efficiency in public expenditure is separate from the issue of size.<br />
Nevertheless, as a Government which believes that public expenditure is necessary<br />
for progress towards its key objectives, we have found the constraints that the trilogy<br />
commitments have imposed on size useful in concentrating attention on<br />
efficiency. Finance Minister Peter Walsh has made several detailed statements on our<br />
approach so far, and I do not have time tonight to traverse that ground.<br />
But I believe that I can assert that this year's budget, with the lowest growth in real<br />
outlays for six years, and reducing the share of Commonwealth expenditure by a full<br />
percentage point, has contributed more to genuine equity than many more expansive<br />
budgets in past years.<br />
The efficiency of public enterprises is also a major factor in the overall<br />
performance of the Australian economy.<br />
Significant progress has been made in rationalising activities and reducing costs in<br />
several major Commonwealth commercial enterprises. This is the real task. The<br />
issue of " privatisation"' is a diversion from this task.<br />
Commonwealth public enterprises are quantitatively less important than those of<br />
the States.<br />
In recent years the Australian community has been more critical of charges for<br />
electricity, rail and other services provided by the States, as well as by the<br />
Commonwealth. This is a promising development.<br />
I believe that the Commonwealth Government has contributed to this change in<br />
the climate of community opinion. We have also made direct representations to the<br />
States on these issues.<br />
One result is a substantially lower rate of increase in charges, through containment<br />
of costs, without increases in the deficits of State enterprises.<br />
TOWARDS A MORE DYNAMIC AND OUTWARD<br />
LOOKING ECONOMY<br />
It will be clear from what I have already said that I attach prime importance to<br />
increasing the international orientation of the Australian economy.<br />
Major progress has been made in these last two years, and the continuation of<br />
progress will be a major focus of our efforts in the years ahead.<br />
Our work in this area has many inter-related strands.<br />
One strand is the re-orientation of Australian business, trade union and<br />
community attitudes towards greater awareness of international opportunities.<br />
I have seen this as one of my special responsibilities as Prime Minister, and have<br />
pursued it in every possible forum at home and abroad.<br />
It has been assisted by discussion within the Economic Planning Advisory<br />
Council and the Australian Manufacturing Council.<br />
Community attitudes began to change in favourable ways some years ago, but<br />
there has been a major acceleration under this Government.<br />
A second strand has been the reform of the regulatory environment which had<br />
placed so many inhibitions on international transactions in the past. </p>
<p>The abolition of exchange controls at the time we floated the dollar had farreaching<br />
implications for trade, the full extent of which is poorly understood.<br />
It facilitated the development of new hedging arrangements, which reduced the risk<br />
of specialisation in production for export.<br />
The floating of the dollar itself reduced uncertainty in production for export, by providing<br />
greater confidence that any movements in Australian costs that were out of line<br />
with international developments would be counteracted by currency depreciation.<br />
The entry of new banks with foreign equity, and the internationalisation of the<br />
operations of established Australian banks, are widening the channels through which<br />
Australian producers are informed of export opportunities.<br />
We have also taken significant steps towards liberalisation of import trade. Our<br />
approach so far has been to address issues industry by industry.<br />
The plans for the passenger motor vehicle, textile, clothing, footwear and steel<br />
industries all involve substantial liberalisation.<br />
The decisions to use bounties, rather than tariffs, to protect the production of steel,<br />
agricultural harvesters, machine tools and computers improve the form and visibility<br />
of assistance to those activities.<br />
The deregulation, proposed or underway, of the marketing arrangements for milk<br />
and dairy products, eggs and dried vine fruit will reduce assistance to industries<br />
which have been very highly protected in the past. The voluntary restraints on the<br />
exports of colour television sets to this country were abolished last year.<br />
In the service sector, our new guidelines for the provision of education services to<br />
overseas students on a fee-paying basis open the way for the development of a new<br />
export industry.<br />
The progress in some of these areas has been considerable.<br />
The removal, on 1 January 1984, of the temporary import quotas imposed on a<br />
range of steel products in 1982, was a major break from the earlier Australian<br />
experience with temporary quotas becoming permanent Together with other elements<br />
of the industry plan, it has helped to make steel production in Australia internationally<br />
competitive, and has opened prospects for expansion through exports.<br />
Since the mid-i 970s, the greatest problems of high protection in Australia have<br />
been in the textiles, clothing, fcotwear and passenger motor vehicle industries.<br />
In these industries, improvements in Australia's general competitive position through<br />
depreciation, gradual liberalisation of imports, and major rationalisation and increased<br />
productivity at home have substantially reduced protection over the last year.<br />
This is reflected in large reductions in the premium paid on quota sold by tender.<br />
The third strand in our efforts to increase the international orientation of Australian<br />
industry has been our active trade policy, designed to build a climate of confidence<br />
in which Australian and overseas enterprises can interact with each other.<br />
Some of our activities have been defensive, as we have sought to minimise the<br />
damage that the trade policies the European Economic Community has imposed on<br />
our efficient rural industries, and to ward off United States' pressures upon Japan to<br />
divert imports from efficient Australian suppliers.<br />
The representations that John Kerin and I made in Brussels early this year were<br />
successful in holding the line against subsidised European beef in our established<br />
Western Pacific markets. We can be reasonably satisfied with the way Japan has<br />
maintained the international trade rules against bilaterial pressures, although we<br />
would like to have done better with beef.<br />
More positively, we have invested considerable effort in building confidence in trading<br />
relationships within our own region. I myself have been closely involved in discussions<br />
on trade with heads of government in all major countries in our region.<br />
There has been special progress in our relationship with China. We have been<br />
working to build new layers to our trading relationship with Japan as Japanese<br />
industry's appetite for raw materials has become less voracious. Significant steps<br />
have been taken to build closer economic ties with the ASEAN countries, the<br />
Republic of Korea, and the developing countries of the South Pacific Forum, Like </p>
<p>A1,4-( 3) t he ASEAN countries, we have had to think about possible responses to suggestions<br />
for new free trade areas that have emanated from the office of the Special Trade<br />
Repregentative in the United States..<br />
We have established a firm base from which to use effectively the new<br />
competitiveness conferred by the depreciation of the dollar and the associated<br />
commitment to wage moderation.<br />
The circumstances have come together for us to make a permanent break over these<br />
next few years with the inward-looking policies that have been holding us back.<br />
With a new round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations ( MTN) on the horizon, we<br />
need to prepare ourselves to contribute to its successful progression. Admittedly the<br />
benefits we have obtained from previous MTN rounds have not been encouraging.<br />
But this was due in considerable measure to our lack of credibility in arguing for<br />
general trade liberalisation while seeking to maintain our own trade barriers.<br />
One of the ways in which we have been preparing for a new round of negotiations is<br />
through the regional consultations amongst Western Pacific countries which<br />
followed suggestions that I made in a speech in Bangkok in November 1983. The<br />
third regional meeting of senior trade officials will take place in Seoul next week.<br />
There is general agreement within the region that these consultations have been<br />
helpful in identifying regional interests and opportunities for co-operation.<br />
A demonstrated commitment to continue steadily with domestic liberalisation will<br />
greatly add to our credibility and negotiating position in any MTN round. Such an<br />
approach could be complemented by a preparedness to pursue trade policy initiatives<br />
involving particular countries or products.<br />
The continuation of domestic liberalisation is in any case fully justified by the domestic<br />
benefits, independently of the trade policy rewards which it makes possible.<br />
Consistently with our established approach, further liberalisation, whether it were<br />
within a program of general reductions in assistance or industry by industry, would be<br />
gradual, would be complemented by appropriate adjustment measures, and might need<br />
to be supported by positive measures to encourage expansion of productive activities.<br />
Conclusions We have come a long way in these last two and a half years, but we do not delude<br />
ourselves that we are near the end of our journey.<br />
A new approach to macro-economic policy, based on fighting inflation and unemployment<br />
at the same time within the framework of the Prices and Incomes Accord, has<br />
brought back strong growth after a decade of stagnation and decline.<br />
The return of growth has given Australians the heart to tackle longstanding<br />
structural impediments to growth.<br />
We have begun the huge task of reform, guided by our recognition of the reality<br />
that if change is to be substantial and permanent, it must be gradual, its consequences<br />
must be well understood in the community, and the whole structure of social and<br />
economic policy must care for Australians who are unable to defend themselves in<br />
the market place.<br />
As I have said, by the end of this year the Australian economy will have expanded<br />
more in three years than in the preceding eight years.<br />
Our current forecasts suggest that by the time the Labor Government has been in<br />
office half as long as its predecessor, it will have presided over the creation of almost<br />
twice as many jobs.<br />
But we must go further yet.<br />
The Labor Government, and this generation of Australians, must expect to be<br />
judged in history not by our success in promoting three or five years of economic<br />
growth stronger than the rest of the world.<br />
The final test of our worth is whether we succeed, gradually but inexorably, in so<br />
transforming the environment of economic life in Australia, that sustained growth<br />
becomes entrenched, even in these difficult times for the world economy.<br />
On our performance so far, I reckon that Stan Kelly would expect us to pass<br />
this test. </p>
