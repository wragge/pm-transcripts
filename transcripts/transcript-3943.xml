    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER'S CURTIN MEMORIAL LECTURE,<br />AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, E,<br />CANBERXIA 29 OCTOBER 1975<br />0C1. " I HI<br />Thirty-four years ago -October 1941 -in\@ dl't at<br />political upheaval and at a time of supreme danger f t a,<br />the House of Representatives asserted its unchallenged and<br />exclusive right to make and unmake Australian governments. As a<br />result of that assertion of its exclusive authority, John Curtin<br />became Prime Minister of Australia.<br />It is timely to recall tonight the manner in which he<br />achieved office and the manner by which the first Curtin<br />Government, one of the very great, if not the very greatest of<br />all Australian Qovernments, was maintained for more than two<br />years thereafter. It was a. Government formed solely through a<br />majority of the House of Representatives and maintained solely<br />at the will of the majority in the House of Representatives.<br />Neither in attaining nor retaining the Prime Ministership did<br />Curtin ever have to consider the state of the political parties<br />in the Senate. Thus, in the most critical time in this nation's<br />history, one of the,-, strongest of our governments was sustained<br />by the narrowest possible majority in the House of Representatives.<br />But that bare majority was enough for the highest possible of<br />all purposes the security and survival of this nation. There<br />could be no more striking proof if proof were ever neededof<br />the power and absolute supremacy of the majority even a<br />mere majority -in the House of Representatives.<br />. The Australian Labor Party has happened to form federal<br />governments during significant parts of the three great world<br />crises of the tiwentieth century the two World Wars and the<br />Great Depression. Naturally enough we have tended to believe<br />that the people of Australia have turned to Labor for leadership<br />in times of the greatest peril.. This is only true in the very<br />loosest sense. The eloctions of 1914 and 1929 which both resulted<br />in the return of Labor Governments were in no wiay fought on the<br />Sgreat international issues then about to engulf the world. And<br />in Curtin's case, the government was formed not directly as a<br />esalt of any election at all, but by the decision of the House<br />~ Qof lepresentatives -by the will of the majority in the House<br />. of . aepresentatives. The prolonged political crisis of 1941 was about numbers<br />* in the-House of Representatives. Throughout that crisis the<br />Menzies Government and then the Padden Government was supported<br />by a clear majority in the Senate. But the numbers in the Senate<br />were never a consideration throughout the turmoil. It was only<br />because of-his precarious position in the House of Representatives<br />that Menzies sought to form a national government with Labor<br />participation. He wanted to build a reliable working majority<br />* in the House of Representatives. He could not do that unless<br />he had Labor support. He failed. He resigned. The Fadden Budget<br />* was then defeated by the votes of the two Independents, Messrs<br />* Coles and Wilson. That is the majority in the House of Representatives<br />changed and therefore the Government of Australia changed. And<br />* with that paper-thin majority in the House of Representatives,<br />I</p>
<p>2-<br />despite its-minbrity position--in* the Senate,-the Ciirtin<br />Government* went-on'. t mobilise..-Australja anal to steer Australia<br />through the perils'of. 1942-and 1-943. That Government was not<br />only Curtin's. vindication; it was'-a vindication " of the authority<br />of the House of-Representatives, a vindication never to be forgotten.<br />episodeIt is especially worth recalling those days because the<br />epiodeillustrates the novelty of the pretensions to make and<br />unmake governments now being put forward on behalf of the Senate.<br />The significant thing about 1941 is that throughout the period,<br />the state of the Senate and the opinions of Senators were always<br />irrelevant to the central issue, and totally irrelevant to the<br />* outcome. No historian today would view the position of the. Senate<br />which resulted from the 1940 elections as an important factor in<br />the situation any more than did the politicians of the dayany<br />more than Menzies or Fadden or Curtin took it into account.<br />the Melbourne University is now publishing the second volume of<br />' teCaucus Minutes, the minutes of the Parliamentary Labor Party<br />from 101 to 1949. The most intriguing revelations intriguing<br />Sperhaps in more than one sense of the word are about the period<br />W 1940 1941. In particular, there is the correspondence between<br />SMenzies, Curtin, Fadden,* Earle Page and Beazley about the possible<br />formation of a national government. In all that correspondence,<br />you will never find the Senate mentioned.<br />In those days; by those men, in the great matter, the<br />Senate was treated with the reverent silence due to all irrelevant<br />anachronisms. We do not however have to go back thirty-four years;<br />recent as that is in terms of constitutional history we have to<br />* go back no further than our own experience the elections of<br />1972 and 1974. The elections of 1972 were for the House of<br />'&gt; Representatives alone; whatever the result had been the state<br />of the Parties in the Senate had to remain unchanged; an anti-<br />-, Labor majority was guaranteed until at least July 1974. No<br />Australian at that time considered that the Senate would be a<br />&gt; cru,: ial factor in determining the timing of future elections.<br />Nobody approached the 1972 campaign with any thought other<br />tha~ i what Australians were doing then was electing a government<br />for a normal three-year term. There might have been some fleeting<br />thought given to the possibility of the circumstances by which<br />Labor, if successful, might be brought to the need for a double<br />. dissolution. But certainly no-one seriously considered the<br />possibility of the House of Representatives being forced to an<br />election by the refusal of Supply by the Senate. And no-one<br />considered the poss. ibility of a double dissolution triggered off<br />by the threat of refusal of Supply by the Senate. It has been<br />* a remarkable example of the unthinkable becoming apparently<br />quite acceptable. It has since appeared that the Government had barely<br />taken office when the Opposition in the Senate began planning<br />to use its numbers to force an early House of Representatives<br />election. In the words of Senator Withers speaking in April 1974:<br />" We embarked on a course some 12 months ago to<br />bring about a House of Representatives election."</p>
<p>-3-<br />The course of action was being prepared by Senators<br />who had taken office one and a half and four and a half years<br />before the Labor Government, and who had been elected two and<br />five years before the Governmnt. In the present * crisis there<br />has been a tendency to overlook the fact that the rejection<br />of money Bills or the refusal of Supply by the Senate does<br />not of itself and cannot of itself lead to an election for the<br />Senate. It is aimed only against the House of* Representatives.<br />The fact that grounds may exist for a double dissolution on<br />other issues is incidental. It may be politically relevant<br />but it is constitutionally irrelevant. In April 1973* when this<br />course was first contemplated there were no grounds for a<br />double dissolutionno legislation had been twice rejected by<br />the Senate with a lapse of three months between the first<br />rejection and the second introduction. Nor when the rejection<br />of the 1974 Budget was threatened last October did the grounds<br />exist for another double . dissolution. The slate had been wiped<br />clean by the 1974 elections. The rejection of the Budget last<br />,,. year could only hav&amp; led. to a House of Representatives election.<br />The existence of grounds for a double dissolution now,<br />on twenty-two Bills which have nothing whatever to do with the<br />Budget, only obscures -the real implications and the real<br />intentions of the actions of the Senate. To accept the Senate's<br />claims now would be to accept the right of the Senate to have<br />the House of Representatives dissolved without itself having<br />to go to the people.<br />It is now clear that behind the present constitutional<br />struggle there is a wider political question the answer to which<br />is central to the way in which Australia's whole political life<br />will develop for the rest of this century and beyond. The<br />question is not just whether this particular government, the<br />* Whitlam, Government, will be allowed to govern for the term for<br />Swhich it was elected. The question is whether any duly elected<br />reformist government will be allowed to govern in the future.<br />What is at stake is whether the people who seek change and<br />reform are ever again to have any confidence that it can be<br />achieved through the normal parliamentary processes.<br />0 During my period as Leader of the OppositionlI addressed<br />-myself to three principal tasks: to develop a coherent program<br />-of relevant reform; to convince a majority of Australians that<br />those reforms were relevant; and to convince the Labor movement<br />as a whole that the Parliamentary institutions were relevant in<br />achieving worthwhile reform. The great organisational battles<br />between 1967 and 1970, particular in Victoria, were essentially<br />about that third task. It was the toughest of all.<br />I would not wish on any future leader of the Australian<br />Labor Party the task of having to harness the radical forces to<br />the restraints and constraints of the parliamentary system if<br />I were now to succumb in the present crisis. it is clear that<br />the basic attack which has been mounted against, the Labor<br />Government from April 1973 onward was not an attack on its<br />competence or its effectiveness but on its very legitimacy<br />the legitimacy of any reform government now or in the fut-ure. ./ 4</p>
<p>-4-<br />There is a certain poignancy for mec in delivering this<br />Curtin Lecture at a time of deep constitutional crisis ' and high<br />constitutional drama. It was very mnuch due to John Curtin that<br />I first became concerned about the Australian Constitution.<br />In 1961 1 delivered the second Curtini Memorial Lecture uinder the<br />auspices of the University of Western Australia branch of the<br />Australian Labor Party. I said then:<br />" My interest in constitutional matters stems from<br />* the-time when John Curtin was Prime Ministor.<br />The Commonwealth Parliament's powers were than at<br />their most ample and it was constitutionally, if<br />not always politically, more open to a Labor<br />* Government to carry out its policies than it is in<br />peace time. Johin Curtin, however, saw -that he was<br />presiding over a passing phase. He was not content<br />with the paradox that the Labor Party was free to<br />enact its policies in times of war alone.<br />Accordingly, in 1944 he sponsored a referendum<br />to give the Federal Parliament post-war powers.<br />His motives for holding the referendum were based<br />on patriotism and experience. He argued the case<br />with his full logic and eloquence. The opposition<br />to the referendum was spurious and selfish. The<br />arguments were false. My hopes were dashed by the<br />outcome and from that moment I determined to do<br />* all I could to modernise the Australian Constitution."<br />The title of that lecture was '. Democratic Socialism<br />within the Constitution". Some years previously, in 1957,<br />I delivered the Chifley Memorial Lecture in Melbourne. The<br />title of that lecture was '' The Constitution versus Labor'.<br />It. would be fair to say that the difference in the two subjects<br />expressed the development of my thinking over the intervening<br />four years. In the Chifley Lecture I was concerned with<br />the difficulties confronting the Australian Labor Party in<br />carrying out its policies under the federal system. In the 1961<br />Curtin lecture, I emphasised the opportunities a Labor Government<br />would have to carry out its policies under -the federal. system as<br />it then stood and as it still stands. I summed up by saying:<br />" Members of the Parliament must accept the permanent<br />necessity of seeking the people's consent before<br />they can nationalise an industry. This should not<br />be regarded as too stifling an inhibition in these<br />* times. Socialists are now more concerned with the<br />creation of opportunities than the imposition of<br />restraints. Within our own nation we do not have<br />to ration scarcity but plan abundance The<br />Australian Government has as much constitutional<br />freedom as any other national government to plan the<br />public sector in Australia and to make arrangements<br />with other countries. Through its financial<br />hegemony it can create better conditions in transport,<br />housing, education and health; it can create new<br />industries; it can create new communities. Through<br />international arrangements it can share in the more<br />orderly and equitable production, distribution andexchange<br />of goods and skills. Socialists have to<br />play the most dynamic role in the relatively skilled<br />and affluent community inhabiting our remote, dependent<br />and unevenly developed continent."</p>
<p>To a very great extent the broad lines of actionI<br />then foreshadowed were to form, after years of refinement and<br />development in the Parliament and within the Party, the, program<br />on which the Party was elected in 1972 and which the Australian<br />Government has endeavoured to carry out during the two Parliaments<br />in which we have had a clear House of Representatives majoritythe<br />truncated twenty-eighth Parliament and this threatened,<br />turbulent twenty-ninth Parliament.<br />One of the ironies of the present situation is that<br />the philosophy of the program assumes acceptance of the rulesthe<br />ground rules of a system which is inherently conservative.<br />The program accepts the limitations of the Cornstitution, the<br />unwieldiness of the Parlirnentary system as an instrument for<br />executive action and the frustrations of the federal system.<br />We accepted the rules of the game. In our innocence we thought<br />that our opponents did too.<br />In practice the real difficulties in carrying out the.<br />pogram have not arisen in any serious degree from the obvious<br />limitations imposed by the Constitution and the federal. system.<br />* True, there has been obstruction and non-co-operation and often<br />sheer bloodymindedness on the part of the States. And true,<br />we have so far failed in attempts to secure amendments to the<br />Constitution. These involved setbacks;. but the Government can<br />live with them. I know it would disappoint him terribly, but<br />I must confess I never lie awake at nights worrying about<br />Mr Bjelke-Petersen. I can easily put up with the pretensions<br />* of the Premier's palindromic pro-consul or as easily put<br />them down. The really intractable difficulties, however, have<br />arisen from problems quite external to the Constitution and<br />* the federal system. These have been political and economic,<br />but the economic difficulties themselves have been vastly<br />., compounded by political distortions. So in a very real sensewithout<br />any attempt on my part to escape responsibility or to<br />* deny mistakes and misjudgements Australia's present difficulties,<br />M. ot least the economic difficulties, spring from a gross and<br />prolonged distortion of normal political processes.<br />I first put our economic problems in their world<br />perspective but, equally, I do suggest that our ability to<br />take national action to ameliorate the consequences of an<br />international situation has been seriously compromised by an<br />artificially-induced domestic political crisis.<br />When my Government was elected our aim was to finance<br />our new programs from growth. But world-wide inflation and<br />recession frustrated this objective. This is no mere self-<br />* justification. The whole industrialised world is currently<br />going through the worst peacetim~ e inflation on record and the<br />deepest recession since the 1930' s. Within the OECD, the<br />membership of which includes virtually every industrialised<br />country in the world, the average rate of inflation jumped from<br />3.9 per cent per annum in the decade 1962 to 1972, to 7.9<br />per cent in 1973 and 13.4 per cent in 1974. Real Gross National<br />Product which rose at the rate of 5.4 per cent per annum in<br />the decade to 1972 declined slightly for the OECD countries<br />? a whole in 1974 and is expected to show a decline of about<br />5per cent in 1975. / 6</p>
<p>-6-<br />The OECD Economic Outlook stated on 17 July 1975:<br />" The present recession in OECD countries is the<br />most serious since the war. It is remarkable not<br />only for its length and depth a third consecutive<br />. half-year of negative growth has now been recorded<br />for the area as a whole but also for its widespread<br />nature: virtually every OECD country grew by less<br />than-its miedium-term average rate in 1974, and no<br />economy is expected to take up slack in 1975.<br />The margin of idle resources in the OECD area is now<br />the largest in the post-war period, with unemployment<br />at record levels. The forecasts presented in the<br />December Economic Outlook, and to a greater extent<br />those being made at that time by national authorities,<br />proved to be too optimistic. Industrial output<br />in the matjor countries fell very sharply in the last<br />quarter of 1974 and the first quarter of this year.<br />The extent and simultaneous nature of the decline<br />was unlike anything recorded in the post-war period.<br />The combined GNP of the major countries, which was<br />thought at the time to have increased marginally in<br />the second half of 1974, is now estimated to have<br />fallen, at an annual rate, by over one per cent.<br />output was expected to continue stagnating in the<br />first half of this year; it may in fact have fallen<br />at an annual rate of about five per cent. The<br />December Economic Outlook gave reasons for supposing<br />. that the balance of uncertainties attaching to the<br />. forecasts was on the downside; but the extent to which this<br />proved to be the case is astonishing."<br />There is no way in which Australia could have escaped<br />being caught up in these disruptive world-wide economic developments.<br />We are, after all, a major trading country, so what happens to<br />our major trading partners the United States, Japan and the<br />United Kingdom is bound to affect us. It is estimated that in<br />the course of the recession industrial production fell by<br />Spei7 cent in Japan, by over 14 per cent in the United States and<br />by. over 8 per cent in the United Kingdom. Even West Germany,<br />wh . ch has ridden out this storm better than most, suffered a<br />fall in industrial production of ' over 11 per cent. What is more,<br />these declines should be viewed against strong upward trends<br />previously existing at least for the United States, Japan and<br />West Germany; on this basis the loss of potential output has been<br />much greater than these figures imply.<br />Against this background, the OECD forecast for a real<br />growth of 2 per cent of GDP in Australia this calendar year is<br />relatively good, disappointing by past standards though it may<br />be. In the same period, the OECD expects real growth in Japan<br />to rise by 1 per cent and to fall by 2 per cent in Germany and<br />almost 4 per cent in the United States. And overall, growth<br />of real GDP in all the OECD nations in calendar 1975 is expected<br />tLo be minus 1 1 per cent. In an international situation such as<br />this, it was inevitable that Australia would also be faced with<br />sizeable economic problems. ./ 7</p>
<p>-7-<br />Havin~ g said that, it is impossible to exaggerate the<br />degree to which the impact of these world-wide trends has been<br />exacerbated by internal political disruptions. It is impossible<br />to exaggerate the additional. pressures placed upon the<br />Government in trying to ameliorate those difficulties. For the<br />fact is that during two critical periods in the nation'--<br />economic cycle, the normal business of Government has been<br />disrupted and interrupted. In his Calwell Memorial Lecture.<br />on 22 September the Treasurer, Bill Hayden, emphasised the<br />disruption that-had occurred because Australia was forced to<br />have two general elections within eighteen mnonths and which<br />would occur again if Australia were forced to have a third<br />election in less than three years. Mr Hayden said:<br />" Surprisingly, it is not widely realised that that<br />very act of premature elections itsel~ f is enormously<br />destabilising to the administration of this country.<br />" For instance, at the time of the double dissolution<br />* last year, the administration of national affairs<br />was more or less in a state of suspension for<br />some thing like three months during the election<br />campaign and the post-election uncertainty until the<br />marathon Senate count was completed.<br />" The distraction of the election diverted, attention<br />from detailed social and economic management,<br />especially from the latter.<br />" The community should be aware that the economy<br />cannot afford that again.<br />n " In retrospect, it seems that there were a number<br />of significant economic developments during that<br />period which were subsequently to create problems.<br />" If the undistracted attention of the Government<br />had been available to attend to economic management<br />. at that time, the ill effects of those developments<br />might at least have been moderated."<br />That was the Treasurer speaking on 22 September. None<br />of us really foresaw what would be happening a mere month later.<br />Quite frankly we did accept at their face value the repeated<br />statements made by the Leader of the Opposition. Clive of<br />India contemplating the plunder he might have engorged confessed<br />he stood amazed at his own moderation. Sometimes I stand amazed<br />,. at our own trustfulness.<br />In this situation we should be concerned not only with<br />the political disruption but the psychological effects that<br />this disruption must inevitably have upon the economy, upon the<br />people, and not least, upon the public service. ./ 8</p>
<p>-8-<br />The Budget itself is a nicely balanced even a<br />precariously balanced attempt to deal with the competing<br />demands of pressing economic problems and of social justice.<br />It is as adventurous and as imaginative a Budget as has ever<br />been attempted in this country or in any comparable country.<br />For any significant Budget, and this one in particular, at<br />this time in particular, its effectiveness depends on a whole<br />range of subtle, intangible, psychological factors. It was<br />in recognition of this, for instance, that the Treasurer, very<br />properly, very-commendably, took a special step to ensure that<br />the leader of the trade union movement the spokesman for<br />that section of the Australian community upon which the<br />success or failure of the Budget must chiefly turn should<br />understand its underlying nature and purpose.<br />But what authority can a Budget have,, what success<br />can a Budget strategy have if it is delayed week after week--<br />and those the most . critical weeks in the financial year?<br />There is another very serious aspect of this present<br />crisis which perhaps only those of us who have to live and work<br />most of our time in this city will fully appreciate. This<br />capital is, arguably, the most pol. itical and most politicised<br />Scity in the world, not excepting Washington. We are not the<br />'. only City cxeated as the political and administrative capital<br />of a nation. But the curious combination of isolation and<br />intimacy in this city, of all the people who live and work in<br />it, makes it a uniquely sensitive organism. It is extraordinarily<br />difficult for the normal administration, the normal decisionmaking<br />processes, the normal operations of the on-going public<br />service to continue unaffected, uninterrupted almost at any<br />level -when this city is preoccupied by a political crisis.<br />I think we are all aware of this. Without putting it too high,<br />there is always a very real risk in Canberra that an<br />,-overwhelming political preoccupation will mean administrative<br />paralysis. I think it appropriate I should point this out<br />here in this city and in this University, which gives Canberra<br />its best claim to be a true city in the full meaning of the word.<br />V. It is something of which everybody who has to make decisions<br />about this present crisis should take note.<br />I I want to put it to you that we have an extraordinary<br />situation combining great international difficulties with<br />artificially imposed political difficulties. Yet it is a<br />situation in which the elected Government is determined to continue<br />the business of Government and is duty-bound to continue the<br />business of Government. The world's economic problems will<br />compound Australia's problems and only a slow recovery can be<br />hoped for. Encouraging signs are emerging; the wisdom of the<br />Budget is now apparent if it is allowed a chance to work.<br />Nevertheless, highly undesirable implications of inflation<br />impose a limit on the rate of recovery. Control of inflation<br />is the Government's first economic priority. Unless inflation<br />is curbed the nation's productive capacity will run down and job<br />opportunities will diminish. Failure to control inflation would<br />mean that the present undesirable unacceptable -high levels<br />of unemployment would worsen. / 19</p>
<p>-9-<br />This Government rejects any policy of deliberately creating<br />massive unemployment and widespread business failures in order<br />to stop inflation abruptly but until inflation is controlled<br />we will have to live with unemployment at a level that would,<br />in other circumstances, be unacceptable; otherwise we will not<br />be able to achieve our goal of full employment in the future.<br />The Government is adhering resolutely to its wages<br />policy and to support of indexation. There already are<br />indications of the value of its resolute stand. But we can<br />only successfully continue that stand if the elected Government<br />has, and is seen to have, authority and legitimacy.<br />The Government has adjusted personal income tax scales<br />to give relief to those most in need from the higher incidence<br />of taxation due to inflation and to remove the inequities from<br />the income tax whereby the well-to-do benefited more from<br />concessional deductions than those on lower incomes.. The<br />Government has not hesitated to intervene in industrial disputes<br />* that threaten its wages policy.<br />The Government is concerned to stimulate and maintain<br />business confidence and to create an environment in which business<br />rcwill invest. Consistent with the Government's wishes the<br />PriesJustification Tribunal has placed greater emphasis on<br />future profitability and investment plans of industry. The<br />Mathews Committee recommended a changed approach to the valuation<br />of trading stocks for business purposes and the indexation of<br />* depreciation allowances. The enormous revenue costs and the<br />practical difficulties of implementation left the Government no<br />alternative but to set these recommendations aside and to adopt<br />an alternative recommendation made by the Mathews Committee to<br />reduce company tax and also to continue the system of double<br />rates of depreciation beyond 30 June 1975, extending it to all<br />-vsectors of commerce arid industry.<br />Let me put this as succinctly as I can: the programn<br />of the Australian Labor Government has been designed to achieve<br />iandindeed has achieved a significant redistribution of the<br />~&gt; national wealth in favour of the majority but the base on which<br />that redistribution has been achieved and in a mixed economy<br />the private sector must be a powerful part of that base iS not<br />now strong enough to sustain the continuing upward redistribution<br />of wealth or, perhaps, to sustain the great gains that have<br />already been made.<br />As to the reality of the redistribution,-let me<br />instance two examples employees and pensioners that is, the<br />overwhelming majority of Australian adults.<br />Average minimum award rates have risen by 55 per cent<br />and average earnings by 45 per cent over the past two years<br />while the cost of living, as measured by the increased<br />by 32 per cent in the same period.</p>
<p>using a slightly different base period between<br />1969 and 1974 the average income of those aged 65 or ' over<br />whose principal source of income i-s Government social service<br />* benefits rose by 74 per cent while the C. P. I. rose by 38 per<br />cent. For those people it represented a rise in real income<br />in that period of around 26 per cent.<br />* I must emphasise, however, that in our mixed economy<br />the base on which these advances have been made must be<br />strengthened. Not least of the purposes of the Budge:, this<br />tremendously important Budget now put in a sort of limbo by<br />the Senate-is to strengthen that base by increasing the<br />profitability and viability of the private sector.. A couple<br />of months ago, business might have said that the one thing<br />needful to restore confidence was a change of Government.<br />Increasingly business now recognises that the one thing needful<br />is to pass the Budget, to end the present political crisis,_<br />to let the elected-Government govern.<br />I return to the beginning: the basic principle is that<br />the elected government must be enabled to govern and that the<br />elected Government is made or unmade through the House of<br />Representatives. I quote Quick and Garran first in time and<br />first in authority on our Constitution writing at the time<br />of the founding of the Australian Parliament:<br />" The House of Representatives is not only the<br />national chamber; it is the democratic chamber;<br />it is the grand repositry and embodiment of the<br />liberal principles of government which pervade<br />the entire constitutional fabric. It is the<br />chamber in which the progressive instincts and<br />popular aspirations of the people will be most<br />likely to make themselves first felt... by the<br />Constitution, it is expressly intended to be<br />such a House, and by its organisation and<br />functions, it is best fitted to be the area in<br />which national progress will find room for<br />development." I put it to you with all earnestness: it is because<br />* this Government has attempted to make this Parliament the<br />instrument for reform, for long overdue change, for progress,<br />for the redistribution of wealth, for the uplifting of the<br />underprivileged, for the reduction of the privileges of great<br />wealth and deeply entrenched vested interests, an instrument<br />towards equality of opportunity for all Australians, that our<br />opponents and those vested interests have from the very beginning,<br />as Senator Withers revealed, embarked on a course to destroy<br />this Governmentat the earliest opportunity. l</p>
<p>-11-<br />I fully expect that the authority of the House of<br />Representatives shall be asserted and established quite<br />soon and in such a way as to assert and establish it beyond<br />doubt for all time. I fully expect that the authority of<br />that House will be as successfully asserted and established,<br />in a very different time, in a very different context, but<br />with the same significance and value for this nation as it<br />was 34 years ago -as it was to make the greatest of all<br />my predecessors.
