VISIT TO THE U. S. 1968.<br />
WASHINGTON<br />
PRESS BRIEFING GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. JOHN GORTCN AT BLAIR HOUSE 28 MAY 1968<br />
Q. Can you tell us anything of substance about today's talks<br />
with the President?<br />
PM. I cannot go into any sort of-any sort of detail, or any sort<br />
of substance, really, other than what is covered in the communique.<br />
Q. In general, Sir, would you say that you have achieved the<br />
objectives which you brought here with you?<br />
P. M. I think that I have a much better idea in my own mind, I<br />
think on matters on which I wish to have ideas, and I think it has been.<br />
and will be of Considerable assistance to me. And I think probably that<br />
was a major objective.<br />
Q. From what Mr. Bundy told us at the White House Conference,<br />
he defined the ANZUS Treaty as applying to forces of all the signatories<br />
in the Pacific area. But he left ambiguous, whether this would apply to<br />
Australian forces in Malaysia, Singapore under a new setup such as would<br />
emerge ultimately from the June conference. Have they in fact expressed<br />
any opinion on whether ANZUS does apply in that?<br />
FM. I wouldn't say any definite--I don't know I can give you any<br />
definite answer to that either. ANZUS is a treaty--I think it does apply<br />
in the three defined areas.<br />
Q. It does or does not?<br />
FM. I think it applies in certain defined areas. But I would want<br />
to check this with the External Affairs people before I was sure that that<br />
was correct. But by and large, I thinkC it has been, what shall I say-I<br />
cannot think of the exact words--a matter--never spelled out whether it<br />
applied in Malaysia and Singapore area or not.<br />
Q. But that is exactly the point. It has never been spelled out.<br />
The point is have you made a judgment in your mind now as to whether it<br />
would apply to these two countries?<br />
PM. Well, you are asking really the sort of questions which one<br />
can pursue it to the point where it is the whole sort of subject of discussions.<br />
And I do not think I am free to do that.<br />
Q. Can I ask you this, then. This question, was it raised with<br />
the President? Can you say this publicly?<br />
PM. I do not think I am going to say anything about specific<br />
questions raised with the President. / 2 </p>
<p>S 2.<br />
Q. Possibly you would feel free to do it if I asked the question<br />
in a different context. Are you in a position now to make a judgment on<br />
the suggestions by the Tunku, Mr. Lee, that Australian forces should<br />
remain in the Singapore -Malaysia area?<br />
PM. I would answer that question saying I think I am in a<br />
better position to form judgments on the whole of the area, Far East<br />
Asian area, not just confining it to the part of that area which you asked<br />
about.<br />
Q. There is no reference in the communique to any statement<br />
of Australian views on the nuclear non -proliferation treaty?<br />
PM. Our position I think is known to the American Government.<br />
They have been transmitted before. They have been made clear in the<br />
United Nations by our spokesmen there. I would in a shorthand way<br />
express what our man in the United Nations said--" Yes, but. Yes in<br />
principle, but. And that is well-known. The " buts" being quite significant.<br />
Q. Yes. Vie get back to asking you about the but. Was it<br />
discussed?<br />
PM4 I think the whole var~ iety of questions were discussed, and<br />
if we get down to the question of whether this one was or was not, or the<br />
other one ' was or was not, by an elimination contest we get down to me<br />
saying--disclosing things which I do not feel free to disclose.<br />
Q. Are you going--has it been decided that you will definitely<br />
go to Texatom--on Thursday?<br />
PM. Cn Thursday. I think this definitely has been. This has<br />
been. Yes--we will be flying down from New York to the ranch and back<br />
again. We will only be there for a couple of hours. I will be missing a<br />
lunch I was otherwise going to attend, although not missing I gather<br />
seeing Governor Rockefeller who we had hoped would be at the lunch but<br />
who in fact is apparently not going to be. But there it is.<br />
Q. What do you see as the value of this? I know apparently<br />
General Westmoreland is going to be there. Can he give you aniy more<br />
of an up-to-date picture of what is going on than Mr. Rusk or Mr.<br />
Clifford must have given you?<br />
PM. Can I answer that question in my way. If a Head of State<br />
is visiting Australia, and I asked that Head of State to come down to my<br />
farm and that I would arrange a meeting with somebody I considered<br />
important for him to meet, I would expect that He-ad of State to accept<br />
the invitaticn that I gave. Cn your specific question as to General<br />
Vlestmcreland, I do not kAnow that I could s. ee any direct information<br />
that would not be available in other ways, except perhaps a fresher<br />
and more up-to-dato and more immediate report on the situation as<br />
he saw it--he having within a matter of hours I think, having left it.<br />
But that kind of information I suppose would have been available in a<br />
day or two anyway.<br />
Q. When are you seeing Rockefeller Sir? Would that be<br />
Friday?<br />
PM. WNe are still trying to work that out. You mean the<br />
candidate? Z / 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
Q. Yes.<br />
PM. Yes. We are still trying to work that out.<br />
Q. But you plan. to be back in New York by Friday morning?<br />
PM. No--Thursday night.<br />
Q. Ch, I see.<br />
M. This is a very rushed, very hurried visit. I gather it is<br />
sort of a lunch. And then away again, back-to New York.<br />
Q. Were you able to make any arrangements with Mr. Nixon?<br />
PM. No. He is down in Texas, and he will be down in Texas<br />
on the Thursday when we are there, at Dallas. But he is fully engaged<br />
in his primaries until ter, o'clock at night on that Thursday night. And<br />
this time change makes it impossible to fit that in. We then have to be<br />
back in New York. We have to fly back. I think that--I am~ suff iciently<br />
short of sleep as it is<br />
0 He won't be gping up to New York on Friday?<br />
PM. No, he is down campaigning down there. So, so far, the<br />
only people that I am sure to be seeing are the President himself and of<br />
course candidate Humphrey. And I would hope that one could see Rockefeller,<br />
and if it were again possible on the way back through California, where I<br />
think he is still going to be, Mr. Kennedy. But these primary campaigning<br />
seem to be pretty solid sort of jobs. I will miss seeing as many candidates<br />
as I should ideally have liked to see.<br />
1Q. Sir, getting back, you said earlier that you had a much<br />
better idea of the matters which brought you to Washington. Have you<br />
made up your rWd on these matters, or are they still fluid?<br />
PMi . I think I have got impressions and beliefs which would--which<br />
will help in the e ventual making of decisions. Does that answer your<br />
question? I think it does. I think it answers it precisely.<br />
Q. Ycur talks with Mr. Vance, or the brief ing that you attended<br />
this morning given by Mr. Vance, can you discuss this?<br />
PM. Only in the most general terms, I think, But-it was a<br />
progress report, I think you can describe it, if that is the right word.<br />
It was a report on the attitudes which the North Vietnamese have been<br />
taking up. In fact, after the point of refusing point-blank to admit there<br />
were any North Vietnamese troops at all in South Vietnam, an indication<br />
of what the North Vietnamese had refused to admit, and the intransigent<br />
attitude they had taken, of a certain disappointment that what was thought<br />
to be constructive suggestions by the United States on " Let us get this<br />
established and try and start from there, had just been turned down--<br />
and I suppose one could say forecast or speculations or hopes of what<br />
might or possibly might not happen in the future.<br />
Q. Did ' yot feel rhpt Mr. Vance was not very hopeful about<br />
what ccould evenririe? o. / 4 </p>
<p>PM. It seemed to me that he thought it would be a long time<br />
befoe-~-long time before the present phase might finish. Although again,<br />
the thing is unpredictable.<br />
Q. Sir, can you tell us something about the talks you had this<br />
afternoon with the Secretary of Commerce Smith and the Secretary of the<br />
Treasury Fowler?<br />
PM. Well, we discussed-expressed Australian interests, and<br />
our hopes that such things as our export of meat to the United States would<br />
not be affected by any action, that the international agreement might be<br />
proceeded with--expressed our hope that it would be proceeded with,<br />
expressed our interest in sugar, international sugar agreement business<br />
in Geneva coming to a successful conclusion. And that kind cf those<br />
are examples of the matters upon which we put forward arguments designed<br />
to indicate that we felt that any prevention of our access to this market,<br />
any additional prevention would go badly in our interests, and eventually<br />
not really be good for the United States interests, either.<br />
Q. Did you discuss the equalization tax, Sir?<br />
PM&amp; No, no--it was commodity matters.<br />
Q. W,' hat about the wool tariff? Did yoU discuss that?<br />
rFM. Well, that falls in with--yes--wool and neat.<br />
Q. Are you -any more hopeful?<br />
PM. Well, we put cur case as strongly as we could. But there<br />
are a lot of difficulties, as you know, inside the United States, as you know<br />
indeed inside our own country, the particular interests involved.<br />
Q. Along the same direction, but I am going to do it in a different<br />
way--and ask if you are under any compulsion to revise your warning to<br />
your Party meetings that the forward defence policy of the Menzies era may<br />
have to. be amended?<br />
PM. Well, the report of what I was alleged to say at the Party<br />
meeting indicated that there were a number of possibilities in front of<br />
us, but the situa, 3tion was not as clear-cut as it has been, and those<br />
possibilities are still possibilities. And I do feel that, at the beginning,<br />
that I am in a better-I feel inside myself I am in a better position to<br />
form judgments on which of these possibilities we should eventually<br />
decide to do.<br />
Q. Do you fore see a defence review in Australia, Sir, after<br />
you go back?<br />
PM. Not a defence review, I do not think. We will be looking<br />
at defence in context of the budget. But sort of, you know-I am not<br />
quite sure what you mear, by defence review.<br />
Q. Well, a general review of Australia's strategic pcsiticn<br />
in South East Asia.<br />
PM. Ch, well-I daresay that that will be a subject of Cabinetdiscussion,<br />
yes. But that is not a strategic paper or anything, a three<br />
year plan or anything of that kind. </p>
<p>S<br />
Q. Could you give us a hint, however slight, what this ultimate<br />
judgment might be?<br />
PM. No. I would want to talk to my Cabinet colleagues. I would<br />
want to make a full report to them. I think they after that should make it<br />
on behalf of the Government to the Parliament any statement that might be<br />
made. We are both in a very awkward position, I think--you as newsmen<br />
and me as somebody being interviewed, because you are really asking<br />
questions which are quite proper questions to which you ought to have the<br />
answers, but I am in a position where I cannot give them. We have been<br />
having conversaticons which were essentially private conversations.<br />
Q. To put it another way, are you thoroughly satisfied in ycur<br />
cwrn mind as to the future role the U1aited States will play in that part of<br />
the globe?<br />
PM. In Asia?<br />
6 Yes.<br />
PM. I feel the United States will not lose interest in South East<br />
Asia.<br />
Q. That is pretty vague.<br />
PM. Well, I said that much.<br />
Q. Was the private nature of the talks your idea or Mr.<br />
Johnson's, or sort of mutual?<br />
PM. I do not think you could say it was mine or Mr. Johnson's.<br />
I think in the very nature of things, discussions, if they are to be completely<br />
open and full and free and frank between two Heads of State, must be<br />
private and must not be discussed afterwards, or : if they are, then there<br />
are no further such discussions. But really, the val ue of them is if they<br />
are completely open and free. And I cannot talk about what they were<br />
about. It is self -defeat ing.<br />
Q. There is a secticn in the communique that deals with the<br />
support of the dollar. " The Prime Minister reiterated his full support<br />
of the President's programme to reduce the United States balance of<br />
payment deficit", which is three to cne in the United States favour. Vlhat<br />
is the point of that?<br />
PM. Well, to. tell you the truth, we did not go into that. But in<br />
the communique, it sort of slipped past. This refers to, which it should<br />
refer to, our belief that the taxation proposals of the Administration and<br />
their involvement in supporting the National Bank, and the need to reduce<br />
the United States over-all deficit, were all necessary if thle power of the<br />
United States was to continue. Now, there was no great discussion on<br />
those points. But this arises, I would take it just in passing noting that<br />
we do believe that the stability of the United States dollar needs to be<br />
maintained in the world. This has been stated departmentally, and that<br />
I think did not engage our attention, because it was agreed.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, do you see any possibility that<br />
Australia will adhere to ASEAN or one of those regional groupings that<br />
are beginning to emerge in your part of the world there? / 6 </p>
<p>6.<br />
PM. You say do I see any possibility of it. We are interested<br />
in the region. It would need careful studies by the External Affairs<br />
Department to see whether a particular regional grouping upset some<br />
other type of regional grouping in the same area. But we would be<br />
interested I think. We would see a possibility in the future of participating<br />
in arrangements which were designed to assist the progress of the region.<br />
I think we would be interested, But then the particular proposals, whether<br />
it was Asian or something else, would need study. But in principle, we<br />
would be I am sure--the possibility of us being interested in regional<br />
arrangements.<br />
Q. Through inadvertence, the three of us were waiting outside<br />
for the conference to begin--not realizing it was under way.<br />
PM. You did not miss anything.<br />
Q. I wanted to ask you about the ultimate judgment quotewhat<br />
that might have referred to.<br />
PM. The what what? You want to ask me what?<br />
Q. A reference to an ultimate judgment that would have to be<br />
reached.<br />
PM. It was in answer to a question that was asked. Is that<br />
what you meant?<br />
Q. Yes.<br />
FM. You came in just as I was answering, somebody's question.<br />
I do not remember what the question was, but I think it was along the<br />
lines of-I cannot remember what it was.<br />
Q. You said you were in a better position.<br />
PM. That is right--that I felt I was in a better position to form<br />
an ultimate judgment, or an ultimate decision with my Government--form<br />
an ultimate judgment and ultimate decision.<br />
Q. If you do not get to see Senator Kennedy--and it does not<br />
look like you are going to--and Rockefeller now has become doubtful<br />
or more doubtful than it has appeared in the last couple of days, you will<br />
only have seen the President and Vice-President Humphrey. Don't you<br />
think this visit will kind of lose some of its value?<br />
PM. I think it would be more valuable. I don't think there can<br />
be any question that it would have been more valuable had I been able to<br />
see more candidates. But that does not mean that it is in any degree not<br />
without great value to have seen those I have seen.<br />
Q. It might be better if you do not see any candidates, because<br />
you might call on the wrong ones.<br />
PM. It has great va lue, too, in seeing officials. I know<br />
secretaries of the various departments change, but there is some<br />
continuity in them, and I thin~ k there has been some value in that,<br />
too--for the most part sitting in c~ n discussion. / 7 </p>
<p>7.<br />
The President the other night made a specific point that he<br />
could not speak for his successors. But you still feel that you have learned<br />
enough from here to make your ultimate decision.<br />
I think I am in a much better position, I think are the words<br />
I used, to make an ultimate decision. And of course nobody can tell what<br />
August or November will hold. It may be a completely satisfactory<br />
position to form an ultimate judgment. But on the other hand it may be<br />
just in a better position.<br />
