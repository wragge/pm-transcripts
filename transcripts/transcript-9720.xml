PRIME MINISTER 89/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MOMITER, THE HON P J KEATING MIP<br />
APPOINTMENT OF GOVERNOR-GENERAL<br />
The following announcement has been made from Buckingham Palace:<br />
" Her Majesty The Queen has graciously approved the appointment of<br />
the Honourable Sir William Deane -AC KBE to be her Governor-General of the<br />
Commonwealth of Australia. Sir William will be sworn in as Governor-General on<br />
16 February 1996 after the Honourable Bill Hayden vacates the office."<br />
I warmly welcome Her Majestys appointment of Sir William Deane as Governor-General to<br />
succeed Mr Hayden. Sir William has had a career of great distinction in the law and is at<br />
present a Justice of the High Court of Australia.<br />
Sir Williamn will be sworn as Governor-General on 16 February 1996. Although the<br />
appointment is at the Queen's pleasure Sir Wiliam has agreed that it would be appropriate for<br />
it to terminate on 31 December in the year 2000.<br />
Sir William was born in Melbourne in 193 1. He has pursued a career in the law, being called<br />
to the Bar in 1957 and becoming Queen's Counsel in 1963. In 1977, shortly after being<br />
appointed to the Supreme Court of New South Wales, he was appointed to the newly<br />
established Federal Court of Australia. He became a Justice of the High Court in 1982.<br />
Lady ( Helen) Deane received her schooling at Kincoppal Convent in Sydney. After leaving<br />
school she became an articled clerk with a Sydney firm of solicitors and studied law part-time<br />
at Sydney University. She graduated in law in 1958 and practised as a solicitor with one of<br />
Sydney's leading law firms.<br />
Sir Wiliam and Lady Deane were married in 1965. They have two adult children, a son and a<br />
daughter. On behalf of the Government and people of Australia, I extend very sincere congratulations to<br />
Sir William and Lady Deane.<br />

Naturally, my wife and I are moved by the confidence<br />
shown in us by our country. The appointment is a very<br />
great honour and we approach it with humility and an<br />
awareness of the responsibility it entails. We hope to serve<br />
Australia weoll . In that regard, we are conscious of the<br />
dignity and distinction with which the present Governor-<br />
General and Mrs Hayden have discharged and are<br />
discharging the duties of office.<br />
On my swearing in as a Justice of the High Court more<br />
than thirteen years ago, I pointed out that the source of all<br />
government authority and legitimacy in a true democracy<br />
such as Australia is the people. I then made a commitment<br />
to serve all the people of this country to the best of my<br />
ability as a judge of their highest court. I now extend that<br />
public and unqualified commitment of service to cover the<br />
office of Governor-General under our Constitution during<br />
the period of my appointment. </p>
<p>DEGREE OP. DOCTOR OF LAWS, ( HONORIS CAUSA)<br />
Presented by the Vice-Chancellor and Principal Professor D McNicol I 9 0<br />
William Patrick Deane<br />
Chancellor, I have the honour to present Sir William Patrick Deane for admission to the degree of Doctor of<br />
Laws ( honoris causa).<br />
William Patrick Deane was born in Sydney in 1931. His family moved to Canberra a couple of<br />
years after his birth and he was educated at St Joseph's College, Hunter's Hill and at the University of<br />
Sydney. While at the Law School of this University he was one of the student founders of the Sydney<br />
Law Review, a development that came about very much under the influence of Professor Julius Stone.<br />
He had a very busy time as a student, on the Law Review, with the University Squadron, as a member<br />
of the SRC, the Union Board of Directors and so on. With all these activities, and working part-time in<br />
the Tax Department in third year and as an articled clerk in fourth year, he confesses to having been a<br />
" terrible crammer". But the cramming obviously worked. He shared the University Medal in his year,<br />
but rather than the usual corollary, a scholarship to attend an English university, he accepted a<br />
Rotary Foundation scholarship to study at Trinity College Dublin. He then went on to the Hague<br />
Academy of International Law, gaining the Diploma cum laude. In fact he was the first attender at the<br />
Academy from outside continental Europe to receive that honour. Since the diploma itself is rarely<br />
awarded by the rigorously dviliancontinental jury to someone from a common law country, the<br />
" cum laude" clearly meant what it said. He then spent some time at Louvain and Paris working<br />
respectively with Charles De Visscher and with Georges Scelle, probably the two greatest European<br />
international lawyers of the time.<br />
On his return to Sydney he was employed by one of Sydney's large firms of solicitors and was also<br />
plunged into lecturing part-time in international law, during Julius Stone's absence overseas. He recalls<br />
that Stone left him free to teach the subject as he saw it. He was later the Teaching Fellow in Equity<br />
and Succession. He went to the Bar in 1957, as long intended. At a time before Wentworth and Selborne<br />
Chambers had been built, chambers were simply impossible to get. With Dean Shatwell's and<br />
Professor Stone's unofficial encouragement, he spent his first months at the Bar closetted in a rent-free<br />
room in the Law School building an unusual additional return for his part-time lecturing.<br />
After nine years at the Bar, he took silk. As Queen's Counsel, he appeared in many of the leading<br />
legal cases of the time. He was appointed to the Equity Division of the Supreme Court of New South<br />
Wales and then, in 1977, to the Federal Court of Australia. While on the Federal Court he was also<br />
President of the Trade Practices Tribunal. In 1982 he was appointed to the High Court and made KBE.<br />
In 1988, he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia. </p>
<p>In the period since his appointment to the High Court he has become an acknowledged<br />
intellectual leader of the Court, and a major force behind many of its decisions In fields such as<br />
constitutional, law, equity and tort. In constitutional Interpretation in particular he has becn<br />
influcntial, whether as a member of the majority or, on some occasions, in dissent. He approaches the<br />
Constitution as a social compact between the Australian people through the Federation referenda, not<br />
as an Act of Parliament, and certainly not as an Act of the Imperial Parliament. As a social compact,<br />
the Constitution is, In his view, a flexible document, which can usually be adjusted to changing<br />
situations by acceptable legal method. Thus most of the criticisms of the Constitution are in his view<br />
misplaced, although It is true that party politics has made section 128, the principal Intended avenue<br />
for change, nearly unworkable. As a social compact, the Constitution both expresses and Implies rights<br />
inherent In the members of the Australian community, rights which decisions such as that in the<br />
case, on the inter-State adm'ission of banisters, reveal, are much more extensive than the narrow or<br />
legalistic Interpretation had allowed..<br />
He has also taken a leading role in developing the Court's jurisprudence In old areas such as<br />
negligence and emerging areas such as unjust enrichment, constructive trust and equitable estoppel. But<br />
he worries that ordinary people can no longer afford to go to law, that the development of the law in<br />
the High Court may simply be forging weapons for the intim-idation of those, who cannot afford to<br />
litigate, against those who can. To remedy this requires changes in the legal profession, both In<br />
structure and in attitudes. Here, he believes, legal education has a major role. The old professional<br />
system of education had many advantages, but full-time legal education, combined with study of<br />
another degree, enables the modern law school to harness the idealism as well as the intellect of its<br />
students. Chancellor, as his own work reveals, idealism is not the prerogative of the young or of the<br />
recently learned. It is transparent both In Mr justice Deane's judgments and in his attitude to the role of<br />
law In Australian society. Chancellor, I present to you an acknowledged intellectual leader of the<br />
High Court, and one of the Law School's most distinguished graduates, for admidssion to the degree of<br />
Doctor of Laws ( honoris Causa), Sir William Patrick Deane. </p>
<p>Blackacre 1990<br />
An Interview With<br />
SIR WILLIAM DEANE, AC, KBE<br />
it is Sir William Deane's practice not to give<br />
interviews. He dislikes personal publicity and is of<br />
the opinion that what he has to say about law he can<br />
say in his judgments; that they are the appropriate<br />
vehicles for his views. It is also his general practice<br />
to decline invitations to speak in public. That is a<br />
pity, for his Honour is eloquent and interesting.<br />
However, his Honour agreed to depart from his<br />
usual practice to refuse to give interviews for<br />
Blackacre. He tells us it is the first time he has done<br />
so and will probably be the last, but not, we trust,<br />
because he found the experience too awful.<br />
Sir William Deane is a delightful man. He<br />
possesses, amongst other qualities, a disarming<br />
humility. In response to being asked his impressions<br />
of his job, he replied " I don't think that being a judge<br />
of the High Court for a brief period of time in this<br />
corner of the world in this part of the universe is<br />
such a big deal and I don't think that five hundred<br />
years from now that it is very likely that there will be<br />
anyone at all in possession [ of] or reading any<br />
judgment that I wrote. So the answer is, I don't go<br />
home at night and think what a great job I'm doing".<br />
William Patrick Deane was born in Melbourne in<br />
1931. His family moved to Canberra a couple of<br />
years after his birth. After primary school in<br />
Canberra, he obtained his Secondary schooling at<br />
St. Joseph's College in Sydney. In his final year there<br />
he decided to study law. In fact, Justice Deane<br />
confessed, " It was more a process of elimination,<br />
which I think was very common in those days for<br />
people doing law. I wanted to go into a profession,<br />
possibly that seemed the thing for people from<br />
middle class backgrounds to want to do". He recalls<br />
that his father, who was an engineer, " was pleased,<br />
but didn't push me that waymHis Honour has<br />
-acknowledged publicly the role of his parents, who<br />
went without many things to meet the costs and<br />
demands of my education but who did not live to the<br />
stage where I could offer them material evidence of<br />
my gratitude" m ( Swearing in Speech, High Court)..<br />
His Honour's memories of university are mixed<br />
ones. In those days the combined Arts/ Law Course<br />
at Sydney involved two years studying Arts on the<br />
University campus and four years studying law at<br />
the Law School. He found the two years in Arts<br />
quite exhilarating. Attending Law School between 1950 and 1953, he remembers that ' The Law School<br />
in Phillip Street was a very depressing place in those<br />
days. I used to spend as much time as I could at the<br />
university.. The great majority of the students were<br />
part time students; they were articled. A lot of the<br />
students were ex-servicemen who were really only<br />
concerned with getting through as quickly as<br />
possible. As a result, there was almost no corporate<br />
life at the Law School."<br />
" I don't think that being a judge of<br />
the High Court for a brief period of<br />
time in this corner of the world in<br />
this part of the universe is such a big<br />
deal"<br />
Nevertheless, university life was a hectic one. He<br />
held various offices in the Sydney University Law<br />
Society, including Secretary and Vice president. He<br />
was on the SRC and the Union Board of Directors<br />
( which the law students managed to " stack" in order<br />
to obtain better facilities at Law School). In addition<br />
he worked part time in the Tax Department during<br />
third year and was articled in the fourth year. Add<br />
to this flying with the university squadron and<br />
playing sport and the result was, his Honour<br />
confesses, that * 1 tended to indulge in the practice of<br />
cramming for exams as much as anybody else did in<br />
those days". However, as it has been pointed out, the<br />
cramming must have worked, for he topped both<br />
History and Political Philosophy in his second year<br />
in Arts and shared the University Medal for Law in<br />
his year.<br />
Of lecturers, Justice Deane remembers that the<br />
ones who influenced him most were ( in the order in<br />
which they taught) Professor Currey in<br />
Constitutional History, Professor Shatwell in Legal<br />
History, Professor Stone " of course" and Professor<br />
Morison. The association with Professor Stone was<br />
a long and fruitful one and the influence lingers,<br />
undoubtedly. Profeuc, 3. swm page </p>
<p>Blackacre 1990<br />
. After graduating the young Deane spent nine<br />
months in the advising section of the Attorney-<br />
General's department, where he came under the<br />
direct influence of the then Solicitor-General<br />
Professor Bailey, who was " very kind" to Deane.<br />
Following that he proceeded, on a rotary<br />
scholarship, to Trinity College, Dublin, where " In<br />
theory I was studying International Law. But the<br />
truth is that I had a wonderful year".<br />
His departure for Trinity had been delayed by the<br />
almost complete loss of the sight of his right eye in<br />
the last rugby match he ever intended to play. After<br />
Trinity, Justice Deane went, " partly at Professor<br />
Stone's prompting" to take the courses and exams at<br />
the Hague Academy. At this distinguished<br />
institution he was awarded the Diploma cum laudc,<br />
becoming only the sixth person in the history of the<br />
Academy, and the first outside Continental Europe,<br />
to have gained it. The exam was " a bit frightening",<br />
partly written and partly oral, the latter part being<br />
conducted in public by a " jury" of five. His honour<br />
then spent some time at Louvain and Paris working<br />
respectively with Charles De Visscher and George<br />
Scelle, probably the two greatest European<br />
international lawyers of the time. Naturally, all of<br />
this " pleased Julius Stone" and led him to ask Deane<br />
to conduct his lectures in International Law during<br />
the Professor's absence overseas for the whole of 1956 and part of 195<br />
This began Justice Deane's teaching association wi;<br />
Sydney University Law School. The associatic<br />
continued for eight years as teaching fellow<br />
Equity and Succession.<br />
His Honour's decision to go to the Bar w;<br />
" something that just seemed to happen". It appea<br />
to have been characterised by the same absence<br />
deep examination of alternatives that was the non<br />
of the day. He recalled that "[ T] here was much le<br />
an inclination on the part of most part time lecture<br />
who were practising barristers to encourage la<br />
students to question the correctness of the reasoni.<br />
in cases. Also there was almost no emphasis on tt<br />
many avenues in which legal education can I<br />
applied outside the practice of the law. J woul<br />
think that notwithstanding the efforts of people lik<br />
Shatwell and Stone and Morrison and Currey mo<br />
of us left the Law School thinking that the obvior<br />
path to pursue was professional success and in thow<br />
days real professional success was seen as lying<br />
the Bar and that's just the way it worked. Lookir<br />
back I think that has been unfortunate'.<br />
Blackacre 1990<br />
From all accounts his Honour's career at the Bar contrary view is irretri<br />
was a phenomenally successful one. As Mr McHugh never going to convino<br />
Q. C. ( as he was then) said on the occasion of Justice<br />
Deane's swearing in to the High Court, his Honour When at the Bar his H<br />
was " one of the most able counsel the Australian areas of taxation, trac<br />
legal system has ever produced'. He went to the Bar and constitutional law.<br />
in 1957 and, just nine years later, at the age of 35, of these areas of the l<br />
was appointed Queens Counsel His honour, in name. It has been poir<br />
response to our question, opined that the qualities suppose that his Hone<br />
needed to be successful at the Bar varied depending this class of case, for<br />
on the type of law, but that " If youre going to go front of a jury in a cri<br />
into the practice of ' Lawyers' law" in the sense of on the occasion of Just<br />
for example, appearing in the High Court on a High Court). Yet it is<br />
regular basis, I think, apart from the obvious need that one hears, as the<br />
for intelligence and basic legal knowledge, the main William earlier this y<br />

<p>Blackacre 1990<br />
In response to being asked what he would say to<br />
someone considering entering the profession today,<br />
his Honour said, * 1 would say the sort of thing that<br />
young people have always, with a degree of justice,<br />
seen as involving a touch of hypocrisy in that I'd say<br />
' that what the law needs now more than anything<br />
else is a degree of commitment to community<br />
service that I didn't show when I was setting out. It<br />
seems to me that the important areas of the practice<br />
of law these days, if you put aside constitutional<br />
cases which are in a particular category, are not the<br />
absurdly expensive commercial disputes between big<br />
companies fighting with their shareholders' money.<br />
It is the area where the law touches the life of<br />
ordinary people and I think that the area of legal aid<br />
has to be expanded so that the Law is available to<br />
ordinary people. I think that the Aboriginal legal aid<br />
area is one that holds tremendous attraction in<br />
terms of fulfilment of something worthwhile. But as<br />
I say, these are comments which the younger<br />
generation going into law are perfectly entitled to<br />
close their ears to when it comes from the<br />
generation that has allowed law to move down its<br />
current path".<br />
" barristers and even more so exbarristers<br />
that talk about their excases<br />
are amongst the most boring<br />
people that there are".<br />
Sir William admits to having loved the Bar". He<br />
consciously avoided speaking of any particular cases<br />
in which he was involved, being of the belief that<br />
" barristers and even more so ex-barristers that talk<br />
about their ex-cases are amongst the most boring<br />
people that there are". However, he did comment on<br />
the sort of work he found personally unfulfilling:<br />
[ In my later years at the Bar I hardly ever<br />
appeared for individuals. That had the advantage<br />
that you didn't become particularly involved<br />
personally in a case. It had the disadvantage that you<br />
didn't really have the feeling that you were doing<br />
anything great for society or anything else..."<br />
And also that which he found satisfying: " In the<br />
early years of the Trade Practices Commission I was<br />
the silk under the general retainer to the<br />
Commonwealth and I stayed under general retainer<br />
for the first six years of the Commission. That<br />
meant that I was precluded from doing a lot of<br />
company work in that period, for private<br />
companies but I thought that was worthwhile.' " Also, for about five or six years as a senior<br />
I was retained by the Commissioner of Tmx<br />
the time in which the tax avoidance indus<br />
really flourishing and I thought that was won<br />
The retainer was with regard to tax av.<br />
matters and we seemed to be making consi;<br />
progress and we won quite a few cases but 0i<br />
whole enterprise came tumbling down when<br />
Casuarina v. Commissioner of Taxation in th<br />
Court and it didn't particularly seem woni<br />
anymore.-" I think the worst sort of judge in<br />
non-jury case is the judge that s:<br />
there silently nodding at you ai<br />
finds against you"<br />
In 1977, Sir William was appointed to the E<br />
division of the Supreme Court of New South V<br />
He sat for a mere six weeks before he<br />
appointed to the newly established Federal COL<br />
Australia. While serving in that office he was<br />
the President of the Trade Practices Tribuna<br />
1982 he was appointed to the High Court<br />
appointment described by the then sha<br />
Attorney-General Evans as " safe". Sir William<br />

IT that " in one sense I think I just saw it as a change<br />
of a significant change of, jobs. But I was<br />
extremely happy on the Federal Court and would<br />
have been quite hiappy to stay there".<br />
Whben asked ' iether the responsibility of being on<br />
the Bench weighed heavily upon him, his Honour<br />
said that it did not " weigh all that heavily. Indeed the<br />
fact that we niever ( or it is unusual to) sit in single<br />
judge cases means that the responsibility is always a.<br />
shared one. I personally found that the responsibility<br />
was much heavier if I was sitting as a single judge in<br />
the Supreme Court in Equity and the Federal Court<br />
deciding questions of fact between people who were<br />
there giving evidence before you as human beings,<br />
than it is in deciding an important constitutional<br />
case in the High Court. In the sort of work that we<br />
do you may be wrong in many people's eyes but you<br />
ordinarily have the time to think the issues through.<br />
They are almost invariably issues of law and even<br />
though a lot of people might think your conclusion<br />
is wrong, and the decision of the court might<br />
establish that it is wrong, if you are dissenting, it is a<br />
process of reasoning that brings you there, whereas<br />
deciding a question of fact at first instance is<br />
exercising a different sort of jurisdiction which is<br />
much more final and which in many senses is a<br />
much heavier burden".<br />
Sir William Deane was awarded an honorary<br />
doctorate this year by the University of Sydney. It<br />
was said at that ceremony that * since his<br />
appointment to the High Court he has become an<br />
acknowledged intellectual leader of the Court, and a<br />
major force behind many of its decisions in fields<br />
such as constitutional law, equity and tort He has<br />
also taken a role in developing the Court's<br />
jurisprudence in old areas such as negligence and<br />
emerging areas such as unjust enrichment,<br />
constructive trust and equitable estoppel*. Sir<br />
William says of his job on the High Court that " It's a<br />
hard job and after thirteen years on the Bench I<br />
must confess I'm sick of writing judgments but I.<br />
don't think there is anything more useful that I<br />
personally could do now, though no doubt a lot of<br />
people would disagree with that'. He admitted that<br />
the office is one which makes him feel ' a little bit"<br />
isolated " but not to worry about. I'd feel very<br />
isolated if it weren't for my family. I don't see nearly<br />
as much of my friends as I'd like to it's not easy,<br />
Partly because of living mainly in Canberra, partly<br />
because of the writing of judgments that never<br />
seems to end, to keep in touch". His Honour went<br />
On to say that " One danger in being on the Bench<br />
for a long time ( and I suppose I'm coming up a long time) is that<br />
you tend to forget that any form of questioning of<br />
counsel, even though you may intend to be helpful,<br />
can be off-putting and with a young counsel, a bit<br />
intimidating. But the approach that to avoid that<br />
risk you sit there and stay silent seems to me to be<br />
an even worse approach. I think the worst sort of<br />
judge in a non-jury case is the judge that sits there<br />
silently nodding at you and finds against you. It's a<br />
very hard road".<br />
" I think the Court is more conscious<br />
now than it has been at any time<br />
since I've been involved in the legal<br />
profession about the desirability of a<br />
joint judgment ( of a majority) if that<br />
can be done without unduly<br />
sacrificing the standard of the<br />
Court's judgments<br />
Looking back over the law during the period of his<br />
professional life, his Honour has discerned some<br />
interesting ( and worrying) changes. He said " in my<br />
time at the Bar it was unusual for discovery in<br />
commercial litigation to be other than a quick<br />
process directed at the ascertainment of what were<br />
the really relevant documents. It was unusual for<br />
more than one solicitor, and extaordinarily unusual<br />
for more than two solicitors, to be engaged on a<br />
case. It was unusual for a commercial case to take<br />
more than two or three days. It was unusual for the<br />
documents going to court in a case to be more than<br />
what could be contained in the barrister's brief and<br />
that meant it was usual for the case to be quickly<br />
decided. There were exceptions, but crossexamination<br />
of people for days would have occurred<br />
in commercial litigation comparatively rarely. That<br />
was beginning to change when I left the Bar and in<br />
my time on the Federal Court I observed people<br />
arriving to court with trolleys and it never seemed to<br />
me that it helped to identify the issues or that it<br />
added greatly to the efficiency of the litigation, as<br />
distinct from the cost of it*. page 19<br />
Blackacre 1990 </p>
<p>Blackacre 1990<br />
In his own court, the changes have been more<br />
positive. He said, " I think the Court is more<br />
conscious now than it has been at any time since I've<br />
been involved in the legal profession about the<br />
desirability of a joint judgment ( of a majority) if that<br />
can be done without unduly sacrificing the standard<br />
or quality of the Court's judgments and also without<br />
any member of the court being under pressure to<br />
compromise his own real views. The court has, in<br />
the last few years, introduced regular meetings of<br />
the judges about cases which are reserved and<br />
awaiting judgment. That has led to a formal<br />
exchange of tentative views ( but on a limited scale in<br />
some cases), which is conducive to the production of<br />
joint judgments. In some cases those members of<br />
the court who are seeing a case in a similar way will<br />
agree that a particular person will write the first<br />
judgment. In other cases no consensus for a joint<br />
judgment will emerge until after a judgment has<br />
been distributed. In some cases a joint judgment wil<br />
be exclusively the work of one person, in others it<br />
will be far more a co-operative effort. In the rare<br />
case it sets out from the commencement to be a cooperative<br />
effort. I don't want to be specific about<br />
cases but I would think that there would be some<br />
cases throughout the period that I've been on the<br />
court where it would be apparent that the judgment<br />
bears the traces of more than one hand sometimes<br />
unfortunately apparent".<br />
It seems superfluous to say that his Honour is an<br />
eloquent man. He speaks ( and writes) in long,<br />
logical sentences that are sprinkded with strong<br />
adjectives. His words convey the deep conviction<br />
that obviously lies behind them. He manages to say<br />
much with a few simple words. At his swearing-in<br />
ceremony in the High Court he said * 1 refrain from<br />
making other than passing reference to my wife.<br />
Some things are beyond words. Our lives have long<br />
been one". In his judgments a similar eloquence is<br />
found. We suggested to his Honour that his languap<br />
at times, almost poetic. He said " I wouldn't p*<br />
such kind terms. I think there are some areas<br />
law where I feel rather strongly about things<br />
those areas I may use language which I think<br />
people would think is occasionally unduly stroi<br />
And yet the language must be only an outward<br />
manifestation of what is within, clothes for ide.<br />
to speak. It has been said elsewhere that his<br />
Honour's work reveals that " idealism is not the<br />
prerogative of the young or of the recently lear<br />
it is transparent both in Mr Justice Deane's<br />
judgments and in his attitude to the role of law<br />
Australian society". It is also transparent in the<br />
impromptu words he spoke to Blackacre. He s.<br />
" I.. think however that there has to be a cold, h<br />
look at the way both sides of the legal professic<br />
functioning. On the High Court we are a bit<br />
removed from the run of the mill practice of bc<br />
law and litigation but it's impossible not to be.<br />
disturbed by the fact that law is obviously out o<br />
reach of ordinary people unless they qualify for<br />
aid of one sort or another. That is something w<br />
quite apart from natural concern as an individu<br />
does affect one's perception of the law, even in<br />
terms of writing j udgments in the High Court<br />
because you can't help but be conscious of the f<br />
that legal developments which are aimed at ena<br />
ordinary people to obtain justice can themselve:<br />
become instruments of injustice when ordinary<br />
people can't afford the luxury of litigation. In ot.<br />
words, if you have a right of action in circumstai<br />
where only the wealthy can afford to take advan<br />
of it and only the wealthy can resist it it become<br />
potential instrument of injustice and that is<br />
something which of course is extraordinarily<br />
worrying in the present situation and its no ansA&amp;<br />
to that to say that law has never been availablet<br />
ordinary people. If it hasn't been available to<br />
ordinary people in the past it is time that the<br />
community generally and the legal profession in<br />
particular took steps to ensure that it is available<br />
