TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT THE LAUNCH OF TARGET/ TCFUA DEED OF AGREEMENT,<br />
TARGET RETAIL STORE, MARIBYRNONG, MELBOURNE<br />
3 NOVEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
This is a milestone indeed, a landmark deed of co-operation, signed<br />
between a major union and a major retailing organisation. But it is more than<br />
that it is something which is underlining what the whole spirit of co-operation<br />
at the workplace is about, about the consensual model that we have in this<br />
country in operating industrial relations. That is, a model where we believe<br />
that when business and labour come together and decide to run the economy<br />
co-operatively on a consensual basis, better things happen. We end up with<br />
low inflation, more growth, more employment, and a better environment at the<br />
workplace. As you know, we have had I gave some figures yesterday that<br />
this year, we have lost 70 working days per thousand people at<br />
work... . whereas, under John Howard, in 7 years during the period of<br />
Government in which he was Treasurer, they lost 590 working days per<br />
thousand. 590 compared to 70. Of course, in those days, the economy was<br />
strike-prone, there was no co-operation, there was a conflict model. As a<br />
consequence, we're seeing a much more cohesive, industrial scene a more<br />
co-operative workplace, where we have got values of co-operation in the<br />
workplace, of consultation with employers, and, of course, under enterprise<br />
bargaining, a whole different notion of how the economy should run, how<br />
businesses should operate, how the employees can help the businesses be<br />
more productive, and how that extra earnings can be split between profits<br />
and wages.<br />
Now, that's the model that's the Accord model. What our opponents are<br />
about, basically is back to the conflict model. They are basically back to what<br />
they call labour market reform and flexibility, which they really mean flexibility<br />
downwards it means losses in pay and conditions, and that's essentially<br />
what they're about. Now, what this is about is something completely different.<br />
It's about recognising the fact that there are 300,000 home-based workers in<br />
the textile industry, that for every worker that works in the textile industry at<br />
work, there are 14 that work at home. And that's an enormous workforce of </p>
<p>outworkers away from work and at home. And these are mostly women<br />
mostly women from non-English speaking backgrounds, and most of them are<br />
Asian. And they are set up classically to be exploited by unscrupulous<br />
employers who will use them in the most unscrupulous ways to get work from<br />
them for essentially small change. Now, what this landmark deed of cooperation<br />
is about, is about one very large and important company Target<br />
showing what a good corporate citizen means by writing down what the ethics<br />
of a good employer should be. And I think Target has proved itself to be one<br />
of Australia's best corporate citizens in both the way it's behaved, and in<br />
doing this, it has declared that any exploitation of workers is unacceptable.<br />
And it has told this to its suppliers, so it's saying to suppliers don't supply us<br />
with garments which have been put together with blood money. Don't supply<br />
us with garments which have been put together by usury and exploitation of<br />
women at home.<br />
Now, this is a big statement, and it says much about the ethical issues in the<br />
labour market, and much about the ethics in the way in which the Australian<br />
industrial relations are being transformed. Now, Target worked with the<br />
TCFUA to develop this agreement, and Target has been recognised by the<br />
union as an outwork best practice organisation. And that's going to matter, I<br />
think, in terms of the industrial relations that Target has, because I think the<br />
whole union movement appreciates this sort of sentiment, as does the<br />
Government, and that's why I'm here to mark the event. The execution of the<br />
deed of co-operation between Target and the TCFUA will, I think, be a<br />
watershed. It will help bring outworkers into the mainstream labour market,<br />
into the world of fair wages and decent conditions into the world of social<br />
and economic justice. Now, this is what it means, and it is walking away from<br />
the dog-eat-dog kind of labour market that John Howard and Peter Reith<br />
want. It's walking away from the dog-eat-dog society that Jeff Kennett wants.<br />
It's walking to decency and fairness and equity in the way we live, the way we<br />
relate to one another, and we don't pretend we don't know there's 300,000<br />
people working out there in sub-economic conditions. And we don't pretend<br />
that they're out of sight and out of mind. Rather, we put them up in lights and<br />
say that they are as much a part of the workforce as anybody else, and that<br />
they need to be treated properly.<br />
The Agreement, I think, is in line with the spirit and letter of the Accord, and<br />
it's in line with the motivating ideal which runs like a seam through our<br />
national life, and that is as I often say, reflecting what I in fact find here in<br />
Australia that we are strongest, all of us, when we work together. When we<br />
work together and have regard for one another, we're stronger and we're<br />
better. So, I am very glad that the Government has been able to assist in the<br />
promotion of this agreement and the protection of outworkers. And in<br />
response to a request from the TCFUA, we fronted the National Outworker<br />
Campaign through our workplace reform program, which reached into the<br />
community. Now, John Howard attacks us giving money to unions. You will<br />
often find the Coalition attacking the Government for so-called " giving money<br />
to unions". But part of it is something like this the Workplace Reform<br />
Program, and the National Outworker Information Campaign, which finds out<br />
about the conditions people are working in at home in these circumstances, </p>
<p>and then tries to find out the truth about their conditions, to educate workers<br />
about their entitlements, and employers about their responsibilities. In other<br />
words, it's money well-spent, and money properly spent.<br />
The result of the campaign was the TCFUA's report " The Hidden Cost of<br />
fashion", which shed considerable light on the vulnerability of workers. Now,<br />
in our Budget of 95-96, the Government announced a new $ 33 million<br />
development package for the TCF industries, which includes funding for a<br />
new Outworker Information Campaign, and research into contracting out in<br />
the clothing sector. And Accord Mark VIII recognises special needs of homebase<br />
workers, and committed the Accord partners including the<br />
Government, of course to work towards ensuring that minimum standards<br />
apply to outworkers as much as to other workers.<br />
Now, can I also say we have acted on the social security front as well.<br />
Employers have been known to force out workers to take the dole illegally,<br />
saying get out there and take the dole, stay at home and make work, and we<br />
will give you something for the piece work at home, in order to drive down<br />
their wage bill. This is the sleaziest kind of exploitation. And they threaten to<br />
expose their employees if they speak out, so that there are a lot of people<br />
particularly women frightened about the fact that they might have been on<br />
the dole, but at the same time earning some piece work income from an<br />
employer. Now, because the situation for outworkers has been so difficult,<br />
and because without special assistance many of them would remain outside<br />
the mainstream, the Government has now amended the social security<br />
legislation to provide an amnesty for affected workers. This means that the<br />
social security debts of outworkers in the clothing and textile industries will be<br />
waived if DSS is advised of undisclosed income between the 1st of<br />
December 1995, and the 31st of May 1996. So, we should say to all those<br />
people out there especially, and in the main, women who might have<br />
picked up the dole, who may have picked up the dole, but who have been<br />
doing piece work for an unscrupulous employer, and even perhaps been<br />
threatened by an unscrupulous employer with being exposed, don't be afraid<br />
any longer. You can tell DSS about it, and you will qualify under the<br />
amnesty. So, we are very proud as a Government to have played a role in<br />
buttressing the protection extended to home-based workers, and I think the<br />
deed of co-operation will be good for Australian workers, and it will be good<br />
for Australia.<br />
It's the sort of thing let me say unambiguously that the Labor Party stands<br />
for. I'm very pleased to see Bob Sercombe and Kelvin Thomson with us<br />
today, our Candidates in the next Federal election. And these are the sort of<br />
values that we stand for. I mean, the Labor Party is a community-based<br />
party. It represents no vested interests it represents just the broad mass of<br />
the people, and these are the things the thing we're doing today is the sort<br />
of the thing that only Labor Governments stand for, that you will never see<br />
from the Tories. I made this point yesterday about Jeff Kennett I mean here,<br />
he is making the run for the bottom line of the Budget, but he never knows<br />
when to stop. He never knows what is important to a civilised society. And<br />
when someone has had a heart attack, or a child is threatened, there should </p>
<p>be an ambulance there to pick them up. There should be a hospital to<br />
receive them. And getting to the point where we are putting chains on railway<br />
station toilet blocks is about the bottom of the pack. And now, of course,<br />
herding vehicles herding vehicles, funnelling vehicles, siphoning vehicles<br />
into roads which are just a common right.<br />
I mean, there is a thing called the social contract. And the social contract<br />
means that you have the right of free movement, the right to do things. Sure,<br />
we obey the laws of the nation and the state, we're all part of the contract<br />
providing one partner doesn't squeeze it too much. But in Victoria it is being<br />
squeezed too much the social contract is being put under threat. And when<br />
they brazenly stare down the parliament and say things that are not true, Mr<br />
Kennett chides journalists " well, what are you going to do about it?".<br />
Meanwhile, the flags are hanging at 45 degrees outside the Reichstag over<br />
there in Treasury Place. And he's for labour market flexibility, like John<br />
Howard and Peter Reith they're for labour market flexibility. Which means<br />
they will all see the executives taking very strong increases in pay, they all<br />
think they should enjoy a lifestyle to which they have become accustomed.<br />
But they would be very happy to have migrant women, from non-English<br />
speaking backgrounds, working away at home on sub-economic rates of pay<br />
and saying to them if you happen to be on the dole at any stage, we will<br />
threaten you with exposure. I mean, this is the sort of ethic that comes from<br />
the sort of " greed is good" mentality. So, there is something important being<br />
done here today, about the values of this country the ideals of Australia,<br />
about the egalitarianism, about the fairness. And when a big company like<br />
Target stands up, and a big union stands up, and join hands together, in<br />
national terms, it is entirely noteworthy. It's entirely noteworthy, and it is an<br />
important change to the fabric of our society, and the sort of country we have<br />
become, and I hope we will always be. So I'm very happy indeed to formally<br />
present copies of this Deed of Co-operation to Target and the TCFUA for<br />
execution, and with all the hopes and expectations for a better deal for<br />
workers. And can I again extend my very sincere congratulations to John<br />
Irish, to Tony Woolgar, to Brendan Soraghan who have been involved in the<br />
negotiation, to the TCFUA in the broad, to Kevin Boyd as President, and just<br />
say how different, and how nice it is, to be at a function like this, instead of<br />
some grasping, greedy little outfit that wants to rip off ordinary Australian<br />
people to line their pockets and make their corporate earnings just a little bit<br />
bigger. Thank you very much indeed.<br />
ends. </p>
