<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If you could have one special wish for Christmas what would it</p>
<p>   be?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would want all Australians to find happiness to find in Christmas</p>
<p>   an opportunity for personal renewal and a chance to see their family</p>
<p>   and their dearest friends. That's the greatest wish, as Prime</p>
<p>   Minister, that I could make for Christmas.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And Christmas - what does it mean to you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It means the same to me as I guess it does for millions of Australians.</p>
<p>   It's a time to stop and see one's family and close friends.</p>
<p>   To reflect. To think about how lucky we are as a country and also</p>
<p>   to think of those in the Australian community who are less fortunate</p>
<p>   than most of us and to help them as much as we can.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And where will you be spending your Christmas?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>In a very traditional way. The family will go to church early in</p>
<p>   the morning. We will exchange gifts and we will have lunch and dinner</p>
<p>   together with a larger gathering in the evening. It's a very</p>
<p>   traditional way to celebrate Christmas but it means a lot to all</p>
<p>   of us and we wouldn't want it otherwise.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And yourself - what would you like for Christmas?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think of Christmas in a material way, I think of it</p>
<p>   as an opportunity of natural renewal, and an occasion, I hope, that</p>
<p>   all Australians, together, can derive personal happiness and content</p>
<p>   from.</p>
