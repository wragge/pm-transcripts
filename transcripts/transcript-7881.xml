JOINT PRESS STATEMENT<br />
RT HON 0 W R PALMER, PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND<br />
HON R 3 HAWKS, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
2 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
~~~ 1Ib1 AA-N3I % 2%<br />
At a ceremony today attended by the Prime Minister of New<br />
Zealand, the Right Honourable Geoffrey Palmer, the Prime<br />
Minister of Australia, the Honourable Bob Hawke, signed the<br />
Convention for the Prohibition of Fishing with Long Driftnets<br />
in the South Pacific. Mr Palmer had signed the Convention<br />
in November last year.<br />
Both Prime Ministers acknowledged that the Convention, which<br />
UIt C9 4cvemDer iY0 was a<br />
significant step towards the elimination of the<br />
environmentally disastrous technique of driftnet fishing.<br />
They pledged to cooperate even more closely at both the<br />
multilateral and bilateral levels to bring this practice<br />
to an end.<br />
Noting that the Convention requires the parties to<br />
collaborate on surveillance and enforcement measures, the<br />
Prime Ministers announced that they would initiate a range<br />
of' cooperative measures aimed at increasing the Forum<br />
Fisheries Agency database on the activities of driftnet<br />
vessels. These measures could include:<br />
The development of a programme of' surveillance by RAAF<br />
and RNZAF aircraft over the Tasman Sea for driftnetting<br />
in the 1990/ 91 season,<br />
The intensification of their surveillance of driftnet<br />
fishing in high seas areas of the South Pacific.<br />
The targeting of driftnet activities within their present<br />
surveillance of' South Pacific EEZs, in consultation with<br />
the South Pacific countries. </p>
<p>The fullest support for the Forum Fisheries Agency in<br />
the design and development of an integrated programme<br />
of regional fisheries surveillance, including the<br />
targetting of driftnet activities in the South Pacific<br />
Exclusive Economic Zones and in the high seas areas of<br />
the South Pacific. Such a programme was called for by<br />
South Pacific Forum leaders at Tarawa in July 1989.<br />
These activities to be complemented where necessary* by<br />
appropriate changes to the routings of existing naval<br />
patrols. The Prime Ministers noted that work had already begun between<br />
New Zealand and Australia on an arrangement for mutual assistance<br />
and cooperation in fisheries compliance matters,<br />
including the exchange of fisheries related information.<br />
Working more closely in respect of driftnet activities will<br />
now form a vital part of that cooperation.<br />
They also noted that cooperation on this issue willI include<br />
efforts in international forums such as the United Nations<br />
which has already adopted a resolution heralding the complete<br />
cessation of driftnetting in the South Pacific by 1 July<br />
1991 and elsewhere by mid 1992. The resolution was<br />
co-sponsored by both New Zealand and Australia.<br />
