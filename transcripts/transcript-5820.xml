PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA MONDAY, MAY 24 1982<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT THE<br />
ECONOMIC ORGANISATIONS LUNCHEON, SEOUL<br />
I would like to express my appreciation for your welcome.<br />
I am grateful'for the opportunity to speak to the most<br />
important business and economic leaders of the Republic<br />
of Korea.<br />
This is my first visit to your remarkable country and I<br />
am most impressed with what I have seen. My ministerial<br />
colleagues who regularly visit you here speak highly of<br />
your economic achievements, not to mention your warm<br />
hospitality. Before raising some of the issues in the Australia-Korea<br />
trading relationship which I believe are of interest to<br />
you as businessmen dealing with Australia, I thought I<br />
would share with you some impressions of how leaders in<br />
Washington, Ottawa and Tokyo view the prospects for the<br />
world economy.<br />
As you know, I visited these capitals just prior to arriving<br />
in Korea and had the opportunity to talk in all three places<br />
with government leaders, and in Washington, New Yorl and<br />
Tokyo with industry leaders as well. Those visits have<br />
taken place as the major Western powers are preparing<br />
for the summit meetings to be held in Versailles and<br />
Bonn next month. While Australia like Korea is<br />
not represented directly at those summits, our interests<br />
are involved, and we have views and concerns we wished<br />
to put.<br />
There was complete agreement in all three countries with<br />
the view that I put that there is a genuine economic crisis<br />
in Europe and North America which affects the entire free<br />
world, and that the economic summit at Versailles must produce<br />
results, must result in actions, not just words.<br />
The nature of the economic crisis is well known. Last year,<br />
for the first time in over 20 years, the value of world<br />
trade fell; in the latest recorded 3 month period, industrial<br />
production fell in 6 of the 7 n~ ajor economies, and by the<br />
end of 1982 it is clear that unemployment in the major<br />
industrialised nations will exceed 30 million people. ./ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
Despite substantial success in some countries including<br />
Korea -in getting inflation rates down, interest rates remain<br />
high restraining the new investment that is needed to help<br />
get durable growth going and there are increasing pressures.<br />
in all countries to build up protective barriers. Nothing<br />
I heard in any of the countries I visited gave me great<br />
confidence that significant and sustainable recovery is<br />
imminent in the all important United States economy.. And<br />
even on the most optimistic view, any recovery which might<br />
eventuate is unlikely to be sufficiently strong to lift<br />
world trade and growth enough to significantly alleviate<br />
the massive unemployment problems that now exist.<br />
In a situation such as this, nations can do one of two<br />
things -work together or fall apart. The dangers of<br />
falling apart are all too-real, and it was for this reason Itook<br />
to President Reagan, Prime Minister Trudeau and Prime Minister<br />
Suzuki a concrete proposal for breaking-out of the current<br />
economic recession. The proposal, which has the support of<br />
the Australian Government, focusses on global protection<br />
which affects growth, inflation and government expenditure.<br />
What I have sugcrested is that the participants at the<br />
Versailles Summit agree:<br />
1) that there be a standstill on increases in protection<br />
and on the introduction of new protectionist measures,<br />
particularly on non-tariff forms;<br />
2) that there be no new or increased export incentives<br />
and subsidies, and that there be an international<br />
commitment to'the abolition of existing export<br />
incentives and subsidies over a period of fivey ears; and<br />
3) that there be a commitment to significant and progressively<br />
implemented reductions in all forms of protection, in<br />
accordance with a set formula to be determined through<br />
the mechanisms of the general agreement on tariffs and<br />
trade.<br />
Details could then be worked out at the GATT Ministerial*<br />
meeting in November.<br />
All three leaders were in agreement with the general principles<br />
that underlie this proposal. All agreed that action was needed,<br />
and none to my knowledge have come up with any other concrete<br />
proposals for action.<br />
I have put forward this proposal because I genuinely believe<br />
that something must be done, and while action of this sort<br />
would be difficult for any industrial country acting alone<br />
it Could be done if all major countries agreed to work<br />
at it together. The Australian Government has indicated that<br />
it would implement these proposals if the seven major countries<br />
agreed to do so. I / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
In recent days, the proposal has received significant support<br />
from U. S. Special Trade Representative Brock, and from<br />
Se cre tary-General Van Lennep of the OECD, and World Bank<br />
President Clausen has made a call for liberal trading<br />
policies and resistance to trade protectionism.<br />
The aim of getting world trade moving again is one which<br />
must be shared by all nations, and certainly Korea and<br />
Australia have a profound interest in doing so, for we<br />
are both great trading nations.<br />
Turning now to our bilateral economic relationship,<br />
the value of two-way trade between Australia and Korea<br />
has grown significantly over the years from US'$ 17 million<br />
in 1971 to over US$ 1.2 billion in 1981. Clearly there is<br />
an underlying strength to our trading relationship which is<br />
not easily shaken by adverse movements in the business cycle.<br />
Australia is a major supplier to Korea of industrial raw<br />
materials, energy resources and agricultural products.<br />
I understand that Korea is now considering a move away from<br />
its tradition of sourcing some of its food grain purchases<br />
from a single supplier. As a major producer of food grains<br />
at internationally competitive prices Australia welcomes<br />
this development, for Australia has long indicated its<br />
interest in supplying food grains to Korea.<br />
I also want to record the value we place in Australia on<br />
the annual talks between our Trade Ministers and between<br />
government officials on resources and the processing of<br />
raw materials. These talks facilitate trade, address<br />
problems that inevitably arise in a relationship as large<br />
and as complex as ours, and explore new avenues for co-operation<br />
such as technical co-operation, for our mutual benefit,<br />
covering such diverse fields as coal utilisation, exploration,<br />
processing of minerals and mine safety.<br />
A new dimension of the economic relationship between Australia<br />
and Korea relates to the possibilities for construction in<br />
Australia, and the supply of industrial products and<br />
components needed to develop new resource projects coming<br />
on stream in Australia. In this regard, the Australian<br />
Government has noted the initiatives currently under<br />
negotiation in Western Australia dealing with the cons truction<br />
of gas pipeline, an aluminium smelter and a coal-fired power<br />
station. But in the final analysis it is you, the businessman,<br />
who must survey the market, make the necessary contacts with<br />
Australian businessmen and take the eventual decisions to<br />
trade or invest. It is this free contact between businessmen<br />
which is the very basis of our market economy systems.<br />
I am therefore glad that the Korea/ Australia and the<br />
Australia/ Korea Businessmen's Co-operation Committees<br />
are both active again. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
I understand it is your turn to visit Australia this year,<br />
and I hope you will profit from your discussions with your<br />
Australian counterparts and benefit from the first-hand<br />
experience of Australia. I know that you are concerned<br />
and have to be concerned about security of supply of your<br />
raw materials. There are two things to remember in relation<br />
to this issue. One is thatthe negotiati * ng process to resolve<br />
industrial problems in Australia is not easy, because we<br />
have a free and open social and economic system. The second<br />
and fundamental point is that Australia enjoys an underlying<br />
long-term stability as a supplier the equal of anywhere in<br />
the world, and superior to many.<br />
I am also aware of concern that is sometimes expressed about<br />
an imbalance in our trade with Korea, which as you all know<br />
is in Australia's favour. The reasons for this imbalance<br />
are clear. Australia is a small market of 15 million people.<br />
It does not and cannot offer the same sales opportunties<br />
for your finished goods as the larger markets of Japan,<br />
North America and Western Europe. However Australia is<br />
a country which has abundant resources which you need.<br />
You buy them from us in large quantities because the price<br />
and quality are right and the fundamental long-term supply<br />
is stable. Korea will go on requiring these resources.<br />
Indeed, your impressive programme of energy diversification<br />
foreshadows substantially increased imports of steaming<br />
coal and uranium. And ultimately a good proportion of what<br />
you import from Australia is re-exported in processed form.<br />
our coking coal and iron ore are turned into ships and<br />
machinery, our sugar refined and exported, our wool spun<br />
into textiles for markets outside Korea.<br />
This underscores the need to look at trading relationships<br />
not in a narrow bilateral sense but on a global scale,<br />
balancing surpluses with one country against deficits with<br />
another. The prime objective of all of us should not be<br />
to cut back trade to create artificial bilateral equalities,<br />
but to promote the overall growth of world trade as as whole.<br />
Let me also say that while Australia is a small market, it is<br />
a profitable one for those willing to explore its potential1<br />
and it offers good opportunities for exporters of a large<br />
range of products.<br />
Methods of doing business vary widely in Australia depending<br />
on the items traded but some basic principles can be stated.<br />
The Australian market is very competitive and substantial<br />
effort and regular visits are essential to establish most<br />
imported products on the market and to maintain sales.<br />
It is important for exporters to keep in regular contact<br />
with Australian importers and to study changing market<br />
requirements and consumer preferences, and for some products<br />
effective after-sales service and a ready supply of replacement<br />
parts are most important. </p>
<p>The establishment of representative offices in Australia,<br />
staffed by senior people, is an important way of promoting<br />
Korean exports to Australia. There is nothing like first-hand<br />
knowledge, especially of the vast range of resources development<br />
projects that are underway or being planned over the next<br />
decade in Australia. Another important opportunity for<br />
Korean enterprise is to involve itself in Australia's<br />
growth through equity investment in these resource development<br />
projects. The development of Australia's resources is a<br />
mammoth task and the total finance required is not available<br />
from within Australia. The Australian Government has therefore<br />
developed clear anid non-discriminatory guidelines for foreign<br />
investors interested in equity participation in resource<br />
projects. Korean enterprises interested in this investment<br />
will be warmly welcomed.<br />
The Australian Government cannot direct Australian companies<br />
to accept such overseas participation, but I can assure you<br />
that we are fully prepared to encourage their involvement<br />
with our major-resources customers. It makes enormous good<br />
sense for us both.<br />
The year 1981 witnessed a milestone in Korean equity investment<br />
in Australia when two resources joint ventures were finaliscd.<br />
There was a 20 percent equity participation by Pohang Iron<br />
and Steel Co. in the Mt. Thorley coal mine, and a 5 percent<br />
participation by Hyundai Corporation and Daesung Consolidated<br />
Coal Mine Co. in the Drayton coal mine.<br />
In addition, Cheil Wool Texctile and Samsung companies<br />
successfully initiated a joint venture to establish a<br />
wool processing plant not far from our national capital,<br />
Canberra. I hope these investments will be the forerunner of others<br />
involving Korean enterprises. The continued development of<br />
economic relationships between Australia and Korea is<br />
imoortant to the well-being and prospects of both our<br />
peoples, just as the development of trade world-wide is<br />
vital to the prospects of people everywhere.<br />
I thank you again for the opportunity to speak to you<br />
today about issues that are of central concern to both<br />
our countries, for our common interests are substantial indeed. </p>
