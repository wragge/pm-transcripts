PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 4 June 1986<br />
The occasion of world Environment Day June) is an opportunity<br />
to emphasise the relationships between the goals of environmental<br />
protection and of the International Year of Peace.<br />
The common theme in the pursuit of peace and the protection of<br />
the environment is people living in harmony with each other and<br />
with their environment. Australians, like all other citizens of<br />
the Earth, should support the cause of a just and lasting peace,<br />
and must carefully manage and nurture the resources which the<br />
environment provides to sustain life.<br />
In our own region, an important element of these twin pursuits is<br />
the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, which I signed at<br />
Rarotonga last year. The Treaty is the product of deeply-felt<br />
regional concerns on nuclear proliferation, nuclear testing and<br />
the dumping of radioactive waste in the South Pacific. It has<br />
important security and environmental provisions. Legislation<br />
currently before the Federal Parliament gives effect to<br />
Australia's obligations under the Treaty.<br />
Australia is also playing a very active role in the development<br />
of a convention for the protection of the environment in the<br />
South Pacific Region.<br />
The world's nuclear and conventional weapons represent enormous<br />
destructive potential. Considerable human and material resources<br />
are devoted to their production. There is a critical need for<br />
substantial, balanced and verifiable reductions in the level of<br />
armaments. The Australian Government attaches high priority to<br />
this objective.<br />
These reductions would lead to a safer world. They would reduce<br />
a major threat to the global environment and could release<br />
significant resources to advance economic and social development. </p>
