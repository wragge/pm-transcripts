    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Government will spend $5 million</p>
<p> from its Federation Fund to help establish an Australian Prospectors</p>
<p> &amp; Miners Hall of Fame in Kalgoorlie-Boulder.</p>
<p>The funding will contribute to the construction of a public museum</p>
<p> and mining heritage precinct at a site 4 km from the centre of</p>
<p> Kalgoorlie-Boulder.</p>
<p>The site will also be used as a centre of research into the mining</p>
<p> industry and as a repository for mining records, artefacts and equipment</p>
<p> of national significance.</p>
<p>The project has gained strong local and industry support, with the</p>
<p> private sector having already committed significant funding. A design</p>
<p> for the Hall of Fame was selected through a national architectural</p>
<p> competition.</p>
<p>The project will complement the Stockmans Hall of Fame in Longreach,</p>
<p> Queensland, with a target of 100,000 visitors annually. It is estimated</p>
<p> that such visitor numbers would contribute $21 million to the Western</p>
<p> Australian economy every year.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that 250 jobs will be created in the construction</p>
<p> phase of the project, with a further 100 jobs created in the community</p>
<p> once the centre is fully operational, including in the tourism and</p>
<p> hospitality areas.</p>
<p>The Prospectors and Miners Hall of Fame project was nominated as the</p>
<p> Western Australian Government's second priority for assistance from</p>
<p> the Federation Fund.</p>
<p>The Government has already committed $80 million for an infrastructure</p>
<p> development at Jervoise Bay, which was the State Government's first</p>
<p> priority.</p>
<p>The mining industry has made a significant contribution to our national</p>
<p> progress and development and has shaped our national culture. Annual</p>
<p> mining exports are worth $40 billion a year.</p>
<p>The Hall of Fame project will provide a worthwhile recognition of</p>
<p> this contribution and is a highly suitable way of marking Australia's</p>
<p> Centenary of Federation.</p>
<p>The $1 billion Federation Fund is being spent on projects of national</p>
<p> significance to help Australia celebrate the Centenary of Federation</p>
<p> in 2001.</p>
