effecitvely with the great economic and international problems<br />
with which must urgently ccncern ourselves.<br />

be PROFESSOR GILBERT MURRAY. O. M.<br />
list r'r \ On January 18, the Prime Minister announced that the<br />
itio Commonweal-h-Government, on the advice of the Historic Memorials<br />
Comnmittee-had recently purchased in London a portrait of<br />
S Professor -ilbert Murray, painted in 1954 by his grandson,<br />
1: ir. L awrence Toynbee.<br />
The portrait has now arrived in Canberra from London.<br />
ride There are apparently very few portraits of the great<br />
scholar in existence and the Government considered-that the<br />
National Collection of rt Treasures should include this portrait<br />
with those of other Australians distinguished in the fields of<br />
art, literature and science.<br />
and WATERFRONT STRIKE<br />
nent<br />
sent On January 23, the Prime Minister said:<br />
11 " Cabinet has t oday considered the waterfront strike which<br />
began last night. It has had before it a careful and documented<br />
com statement of the various negotiations and steps which have recently<br />
occurred, including the negotiation between the parties and the<br />
V proceedings before the Arbitration Court. The urgent fact is that<br />
tmen a strike is on and that, with certain exceptions, it has brought<br />
about a cessation of work on the waterfront at a time when the<br />
vital interests of " ustralia can be and are most vitally affected<br />
ly by it. " As a Government, we are not the judges of the merits.<br />
We have at all times strongly maintained our belief that not only<br />
hese in the interests of the . parties but in those of the public at<br />
large, which are of paramount importance, wages and industrial<br />
Y conditions where the parties do not agree should be dealt with<br />
f by the industrial tribunals.<br />
the " In this particular matter, waterside workers claim that<br />
their pay should be increased; shipowners claim that there are<br />
ers restrictive practices on the waterfront which should be abolished<br />
if the costs of transportation ( so important an element in costs<br />
r generally) are to be kept at a level which will enable trade to<br />
tion go on, ensure to the public the lowest possible level of transport<br />
uncedn cost, and facilitate the prompt and profitable conduct of export<br />
trade for Australia as a whole.<br />
e* " It will be quite clear to hundreds of thousands of<br />
employees in other industries that a disastrous waterfront strike<br />
will affect their employment. Indeed, if it goes on for even a<br />
her few weeks it will inevitably produce mass unemployment in other<br />
usion industries. It is, therefore, my duty to point out to the public<br />
binet generally and to those concerned in the dispute in particular<br />
three things:<br />
1. Whatever may be the final determination, the shipowners<br />
have in fact made an offer of a wage increase and have asked<br />
for the elimination of restrictive and, therefore, wasteful<br />
