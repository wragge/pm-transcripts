<p>  Well thank you Dick. To you Pat I express the admiration, the esteem and</p>
<p>   the thanks of the entire Australian nation for the superbly Australian way</p>
<p>   in which you have promoted the cause of the centenary of federation. I can't</p>
<p>   think of a more effective way than to have a sportsman much admired throughout</p>
<p>   Australia to undertake a marathon run around our country, over a period</p>
<p>   of five or six months, touching large and small communities, accompanied</p>
<p>   on the entire journey by his children, his mother, and his brother, giving</p>
<p>   innumerable speeches, promoting the notion of a united Australian community,</p>
<p>   promoting the idea of honest effort, promoting the notion that all of us</p>
<p>   are together as Australians commemorating 100 years of this nation's existence.</p>
<p>  Pat you're a superb ambassador for what it means to be an Australian, and</p>
<p>   I am very proud as Prime Minister having farewelled you back in May of this</p>
<p>   year, to welcome you, to marvel at your physical fitness, to marvel at your</p>
<p>   mental toughness, and to salute the very emphatic and symbolic way in which</p>
<p>   you have carried the message of the centenary of federation to so many different</p>
<p>   parts of our nation.</p>
<p>  In the course of it you've broken innumerable records. But most importantly</p>
<p>   of all you have symbolised in a very Australian way what it means to be</p>
<p>   an Australian as we celebrate 100 years of our existence. On behalf of the</p>
<p>   Government and the entire nation Pat, welcome back, well done, and thank</p>
<p>   you for a sterling effort.</p>
<p>  [Ends]</p>
