NATIONAL AGENDA FOR WOMEN<br />
The Commonwealth Government's plan<br />
of action for advancing the status<br />
of women towards the year 2000<br />
A statement by the Prime Minister,<br />
the Hon. R. J. L. Hawke, M. P.<br />
28 November 1985 </p>
<p>1985 marks the End of the United Nations Decade for Women.<br />
All over the world governments have been reviewing their<br />
achievements in the last 10 years in raising the status of<br />
women.<br />
Australia has been taking an active domestic and<br />
international part in this process. In July we sent a<br />
delegation to the End of Decade World Conference in<br />
Nairobi, which was held to review the achievements of the<br />
Decade and to devise strategies to ensure that progress<br />
continues.<br />
Our participation in Nairobi reminded us of the harsh<br />
conditions under which women live and work in many parts of<br />
the world and of the continuing need to work for progress<br />
at the international level.<br />
At that Conference, Australia endorsed, without<br />
reservation, the main conference document, the ' Forward<br />
Looking Strategies', which sets out a plan of action for<br />
carrying progress for women through to the year 2000.<br />
We in Australia have achieved some significant progress.<br />
over the Decade. In several areas of achievement for women<br />
we are in the forefront of the world's nations.<br />
Australia's governmental machinery for ensuring that<br />
women's concerns are taken into account in the formulation<br />
of Government policy, is in the top rank. The Women's<br />
Budget Program, with its full-scale assessment of the<br />
impact on women of the Federal Budget, is without parallel<br />
anywhere else in the world.<br />
Our overall record is one of which we can be proud. Since.<br />
coming to Office, we have in the short space of less than<br />
three years:<br />
introduced the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, which<br />
provides the legal right to equal treatment;<br />
S established an affirmative action pilot program for<br />
women in the private sector workforce and introduced<br />
legislation for Equal Employment Opportunity in the<br />
Commonwealth Public Service;<br />
ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All<br />
Forms of Discrimination Against Women; and are<br />
represented on the UN Commission on the Status of<br />
Women;<br />
S given high priority to the representation of women on<br />
Government boards, authorities and instrumentalities,<br />
appointing more than 120 women to such boards<br />
S increased the supply of child care places by 50% in<br />
the past two years and undertaken to provide a further<br />
20,000 new child care places by June 1988; </p>
<p>significantly increased fun'ding for women's refuges<br />
and guaranteed their funding until July 1989;<br />
this year exceeded the 50% target for employment of<br />
women in the Community Employment Program;<br />
agreed to assist the transfer of nurse-* education from<br />
hospitals to Colleges of Advanced Education;<br />
established a National Women's Consultative Council;<br />
initiated a $ 475,000 National Women's Consultation and<br />
Assistance Prog-ram to provide grants to-national<br />
women s'organisations and fund projects to improve the<br />
status of women.<br />
A range of general Government policies have also been of<br />
significant benefit to women and their families. These<br />
include our income-support measures; housing policies;<br />
Medicare; the Home and Community Care Program, the<br />
Supported Accommodation Assistance Program, and the<br />
Children's Services Program. Women have also benefitted<br />
substantially, both directly and indirectly from the almost<br />
460,100 new jobs generated since April 1983: 56 per cent<br />
of these jobs have gone to women, and full-time female<br />
employment has increased by 137,100 in the same period.<br />
As we come to the End of the Decade for Women, it is time<br />
to say how we will continue to raise the status of women<br />
to set out our Agenda for women as we move towards the year<br />
2000. We want to give women the opportunity to contribute to the<br />
full to the future development of our nation, whether in a<br />
domestic setting, in the workforce, or in any other aspect<br />
of life.<br />
This opportunity must be open to all women in Australia. We<br />
are talking about opportunties for Aboriginal women, for<br />
women from migrant backgrounds, for women with disabilities<br />
and for those-who are in other ways disadvantaged, for<br />
young women and older women, for women at home and women at<br />
work, and for women in all the wide variety of<br />
circumstances that can face them.<br />
The Government is proud of the fact that in the past year<br />
an additional 107,200 women have found employment, over<br />
half of whom have moved into full-time jobs. At the same<br />
time the unemployment rates for both adult and young women<br />
have dropped and the numbers of discouraged women workers<br />
have also decreased substantially.<br />
Although 46 per cent of women are now in the labour force,<br />
fully 64 per cent of women workers are employed in only<br />
three of the nine major occupation groups clerical;<br />
sales; and service, sport and recreation, a situation which<br />
has shown little, if any, change over the decade. In<br />
general, jobs in these occupations attract low rates of pay </p>
<p>and offer little prospect of advancement. The Government<br />
is committed, through its Affirmative Action proposals<br />
which I shall address shortly, and other policies, to<br />
improving this situation.<br />
We want to give women a say on this National Agenda and a<br />
role in determining its priorities. It is against this<br />
background that I would like to present to the House the<br />
Government's preliminary thinking on the content of a<br />
National Agenda for Women.<br />
Through our National Agenda we will aim to open up<br />
opportunities to all women, and we will do that in three<br />
ways. We want to give women a choice. We want to give<br />
women a say. And we want to give women a fair go.<br />
Giving women a choice is perhaps at the heart of our<br />
Agenda. Women must be able to choose, more freely than has been<br />
possible in the past, the kinds of lives they wish to live.<br />
They must be free to achieve economic independence: to<br />
choose employment, and the training to equip them for<br />
adequately remunerated employment, which, as we know,<br />
offers the best opportunity for escape from poverty and<br />
dependence. Full access to education and post-school<br />
training opportunities is a central aspect of our agenda to<br />
maximise women's choices.<br />
Women must also feel free to choose to be full-time mothers<br />
without the fear that their contribution to family life is<br />
somehow of a lesser status than work outside the home.<br />
They must be able to choose to combine motherhood and<br />
employment and not feel that the difficulties of being a<br />
working parent receive no acknowledgement or support.<br />
Increasingly Australian women choose different roles at<br />
different stages of their lives. Many women want to leave<br />
the workforce to nurture their young children and then be<br />
able to return to employment without having to start at the<br />
bottom again.<br />
In the past, economic factors and social prejudices have<br />
constrained women's choices and women have often been seen<br />
only in their familial roles as wives or mothers.<br />
Nevertheless, family life is the central focus for very<br />
many Australian women and the Labor Government is committed<br />
to giving support to families, and recognises the wide<br />
variety of family structures now chosen by Australians.<br />
Support is provided to all families with dependent children<br />
through family allowance payments. Since coming to office,<br />
one of my government's major social welfare priorities has<br />
been to increase assistance for low income families. To<br />
this end, the Family Income Supplement and the additional </p>
<p>pension/ benefit for children have been increased by 60% and<br />
the mothers/ guardians allowance has been doubled.<br />
As part of our strategy for young people we have announced<br />
increases in education allowances, which should be<br />
especially helpful in giving young women financial support<br />
to undertake education and training. We have also<br />
announced the introduction of a new traineeship system for<br />
young people. This will provide important new<br />
opportunities for young women and men.<br />
The Commonwealth Schools Commission is developing a<br />
national policy on the education of girls which will define<br />
a set of principles, objectives and priorities for action<br />
and serve as a basis for future State/ Commonwealth<br />
collaboration on girls' education issues. On the same<br />
theme, following its acceptance of the main recommendations<br />
of the Quality of Education Review Committee Report, the<br />
Commonwealth Government is pursuing resource agreements<br />
with State Government and non-Government school<br />
systems. Among other objectives, these agreements will<br />
seek to obtain approximately equal representation and<br />
attainment of girls in major subject areas.<br />
Child care is essential for working mothers but it is also<br />
needed by women at home who need a safe place to leave<br />
their children while they do the family shopping, or visit<br />
the doctor, or simply seek some relief from the demands of<br />
full-time child-raising.<br />
The Labor Government's approach to child-care policy has<br />
been to expand the provision of places. When we came to<br />
office in March 1983 there were child care places for only<br />
4.6 per cent of Australia's under-5 children. Following<br />
significant funding increases in our first two years in<br />
office we have now a three year plan to provide 20,000<br />
additional child care places by 1988 at an estimated cost<br />
of $ 107m. By 1988 there will be government subsidised<br />
child-care for 9.5 per cent of Australia's children aged<br />
under 5. We have also developed needs-based planning to<br />
ensure that new child-care places are located in areas of<br />
high need. We are committed to funding quality care that<br />
is affordable for low and middle income earners. Recent<br />
changes announced to the funding arrangements for child<br />
care centres will result in a fairer system which continues<br />
to benefit all families irrespective of income while<br />
recovering a proportion of the real costs involved from<br />
those whose incomes allow it. The adequate provision of<br />
child care will remain high on the agenda.<br />
Women who choose employment are entitled to have access to<br />
all the opportunities offered by the Australian labour<br />
market, to seek employment in any occupation which<br />
interests them, at the level which meets their </p>
<p>qualifications. ' They are entitled to the enhanced skills<br />
and prospects which result from on-the-job training<br />
measures. They are entitled to a just wage for their<br />
efforts. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations<br />
announced in September special efforts to increase women's<br />
participation in labour market programs and open up jobs<br />
which were traditionally performed by men. A National<br />
Strategy on Women in the Labour Force is being developed by<br />
his Department.<br />
Implementation of some of the major recommendations of the<br />
Kirby Report will improve the participation of women in<br />
labour market programs. In addition to the traineeship<br />
system, a new integrated adult program will provide major<br />
support for the training of disadvantaged job-seekers,<br />
including single parents and women re-entering the<br />
workforce after long periods of absence due to family<br />
responsibilities. In the Special Trade Training Program,<br />
aimed at developing new approaches to complement<br />
traditional apprenticeship training, 500 places have been<br />
approved for women on preparatory pre-employment courses.<br />
The Government is also pursuing a policy of affirmative<br />
action to enable women in all kinds of jobs to secure their<br />
entitlements to equal employment opportunity in the workplace.<br />
This policy was tested in a practical fashion<br />
through a 12-month pilot program. At the same time, we<br />
established a representative Working Party of government,<br />
business, trade union, higher education and women's<br />
interests, and a member of the Federal Opposition, to<br />
secure broad-based advice on how best to legislate to<br />
improve women's job opportunities.<br />
Today I tabled the report of the Working Party, whose<br />
recommendations the Government has already accepted. I<br />
would like to take the opportunity today to place on record<br />
my appreciation of the constructive input to the policy<br />
made by all members of that Working Party.<br />
As a major initiative in advancing the status and<br />
opportunities of women in the workforce, the Government<br />
will introduce legislation early next year requiring all<br />
higher education institutions and private sector employers<br />
of more than 100 persons to report annually to the<br />
Government on their plans for providing equality of<br />
opportunity for women.<br />
We will establish a new statutory Agency within the<br />
Department of Employment and Industrial Relations portfolio<br />
to administer the legislation. I am confident that Agency<br />
will continue the cooperative and harmonious relationship<br />
with business, trade unions and higher education </p>
<p>institutions developed by the Office of the Status of Women<br />
during the pilot program.<br />
Our Affirmative Action legislation will be supported by a<br />
number of complementary measures, designed to ensure that<br />
wherever possible obstacles to women's full participation<br />
in employment are removed.<br />
The Government will actively encourage large private sector<br />
companies to supplement the child care services provided<br />
under the Children's Services Program by establishing child<br />
care for their employees. Tax deductions are available for<br />
some of the expenses involved, and these services will be<br />
exempted from the tax on fringe benefits. In addition, the<br />
Government will approach the States and seek their<br />
cooperation in removing regulations or other requirements<br />
which inhibit the development of new child care facilities.<br />
I am conscious that some State laws and awards contain<br />
restrictions on women undertaking certain types of work.<br />
The Government will convene a high level conference of<br />
business, trade unions, State Governments and other<br />
relevant parties early next year in order to determine how<br />
these laws can be amended.<br />
The other supportive measures will be in the vital area of<br />
education. I have already referred to the national policy<br />
on girls' education being developed by the Commonwealth<br />
Schools Commission.<br />
In the context of the demands for qualified women expected<br />
to arise from the implementation of Affirmative Action, the<br />
Minister for Education will be taking additional steps to<br />
increase the enrolment of women studying engineering, the<br />
field of study where women are least represented,<br />
comprising only 5% of students. In introducing this<br />
program we will be building on several smaller initiatives<br />
already funded through the Commonwealth Tertiary Education<br />
Commission's Equity Program.<br />
While affirmative action is designed to increase the range<br />
of jobs open to women, the Government is also taking action<br />
to improve the status of predominantly female occupations.<br />
The status of the nursing profession will be greatly<br />
enhanced by the upgrading of its training to a higher<br />
education diploma.<br />
The Government is committed to encouraging the development<br />
of more efficient small business, which is a vital sector<br />
of the Australian economy. The Government recognises the<br />
important role that women can play as entrepreneurs and<br />
will ensure that its Small Business Programs are accessible<br />
to women.<br />
We recognise the importance of maternity leave for women<br />
workers and that the current provisions put women in<br />
private sector employment at a disadvantage when compared<br />
with those in public sector employment who are entitled to<br />
twelve weeks paid leave. Many comparable Western nations<br />
have provisions through their social security systems for </p>
<p>paid maternity leave for women in both the public and<br />
private sector. In order to be better informed on-the<br />
subject and following an initiative of the National Labour<br />
Consultative Council, the Institute of Family Studies i s<br />
undertaking a review of the usage of maternity leave in the<br />
private and public sectors. I look forward with _ fnterest<br />
to seeing the results of this research.<br />
I announced in June 1983 at the ILO Convention in Geneva<br />
that the Government was committed to ratifying ILO<br />
Convention 156, that covering Workers with Family<br />
Responsibilities. In keeping with accepted procedure,<br />
consultations are proceeding with State Governments with a<br />
view to reaching an early agreement on ratification.<br />
It will never with any truth or justice be said of the<br />
Labor Government that we are unaware of the tremendous<br />
contribution to our national well-being made by women in<br />
the home. Without the work they perform the economy would<br />
not function as smoothly. At present women's unpaid work<br />
in the home and in voluntary activities for the community<br />
is not measured and thus tends to be undervalued. In 1988<br />
the Australian Bureau of Statistics will carry out a major<br />
time use survey which will provide sound statistical data<br />
on women's multiple responsibilities.<br />
Health is an area of fundamental importance to all women<br />
and to those for whom they are responsible. A National<br />
Agenda for Women would not be complete without action in<br />
this area.<br />
To the traditional focus on the financing of care f or the<br />
ill, and on women's reproductive health, needs to be added<br />
improvements to the general physical, mental and social<br />
status and well-being of women in our changing society.<br />
The Commonwealth Government, in the context of its<br />
commitment to achieve the World Health Organisation' s<br />
target of health for all by the year 2000 and in response<br />
to a resolution from the Second National Women's Health<br />
Conference held in Adelaide in September 1985, will develop<br />
a national health policy in co-operation with the States<br />
and Territories and with women's health networks.<br />
The policy will recognise the need to improve the overall<br />
well-being of women and will focus on the demands on<br />
women's health arising from their many roles.<br />
The Minister for Health will appoint a special women's<br />
health resource person to co-ordinate development of the<br />
policy. From the policy will follow programs to improve<br />
the general health status of all women in Australia, and<br />
through them the health status of all Australians.<br />
Giving women a say<br />
The Labor Government places very great importance on the<br />
need to seek the views of women on matters of concern to<br />
them. We established the National Women's Consultative<br />
Council in 1984 to bring together a representative group of<br />
women to channel to Government the views of their<br />
organisations on issues such as taxation, child care, </p>
<p>matrimonial property. I would like today to thank Mrs<br />
Edith Hall, the Council's Convenor, and the Council members<br />
for the sterling work they are doing. I look forward to<br />
receiving the Council's first Report on its activities.<br />
The Labor Government takes the view that women are entitled<br />
to have a say on all subjects in all the decision-making<br />
forums of Government and not just decisions on so-called<br />
women s issues'.<br />
We are determined to improve our already substantial<br />
record in the numbers of women appointed to Government<br />
boards and authorities and I have asked the Office of the<br />
Status of Women to advise the Government on the means of<br />
doing so.<br />
We are also conscious of the need to seek the views of<br />
particular groups of women on matters of concern to them.<br />
To this end the Aboriginal Women's Task Force has consulted<br />
widely with Aboriginal women throughout the country. Their<br />
Report will be published early next year, and the<br />
Government will provide a speedy response to it.<br />
My colleague the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is<br />
currently addressing the representation of Aboriginal and<br />
Islander women while consulting with Aboriginal communities<br />
on a replacement national Aboriginal and Islander<br />
consultative organisation. The Minister has also recently<br />
received a report reviewing the activities of the<br />
Department of Aboriginal Affairs as they affect Aboriginal<br />
women.<br />
Recognising the additional disadvantages experienced by<br />
many migrant women, early in 1985 the Government consulted<br />
with experts, most of them women of non-English speaking<br />
backgrounds, on migrant women's issues. Recommendations<br />
for action were formulated in the four priority areas of<br />
health, safety and working conditions; access to language,<br />
education, training and retraining; access to child care;<br />
and services for aged and ageing migrant women.<br />
These areas were specifically endorsed at a meeting of<br />
Commonwealth and State Ministers for Immigration and Ethnic<br />
Affairs. As part of our ongoing commitment to addressing<br />
the special needs of migrant women, we will ensure that in<br />
making government appointments the skills of migrant women<br />
are not overlooked.<br />
To gain greater insight into the special needs of rural<br />
women, the office of the Status of Women will early next<br />
year assist the Country Women's Association to conduct a<br />
major survey of country women. I am particularly looking<br />
forward to the results of this survey.<br />
In the area of services for the aged and the disabled, the<br />
Government seeks both input and reaction to programs<br />
through key bodies including the Disability Advisory<br />
Council of Australia and the Australian Council on Ageing.<br />
Women are well represented on both these Councils. </p>
<p>I have invited young Australians to participate in the<br />
review of the Government's strategy for young people.<br />
I am personally involved in a national phone-in for youth<br />
covering all capital cities. I hope large numbers of young<br />
women will participate and thus have a direct chance to<br />
make their views heard.<br />
The Government intends to give consideration to changing<br />
the make-up of the National Women's Consultative Council,<br />
when the term of the present Council expires next June, so<br />
that a number of women from community groups can be added<br />
to those representing national organisations.<br />
Giving women a fair go<br />
The Labor Government is committed to ensuring that all<br />
Australian citizens can live in dignity. We pride<br />
ourselves on being a nation which promotes justice and<br />
equality for all. A fair go for women is the third aspect<br />
of our National Agenda.<br />
The Labor Government wishes to promote the dignity of women<br />
and to attack those attitudes or practices which undermine<br />
it, for instance, those which downgrade women's domestic<br />
and nurturing roles, which stereotype women as ignorant or<br />
foolish in the media or in advertising, or which look with<br />
equanimity on the violence perpetrated on women both<br />
outside and inside the home.<br />
Many of these issues can only be addressed by Government on<br />
a long-term, considered basis. Others lie outside the<br />
scope of direct Government influence. However we are<br />
determined to act where we can, and to help create an<br />
environment where women's dignity is acknowledged and<br />
valued in those areas outside our sphere of direct<br />
influence.<br />
For example, because of the level of concern expressed by<br />
women about the way they are depicted by advertisers, the<br />
office of the Status of Women will commission research in<br />
this area as one of its activities to mark the End of the<br />
UN Decade for Women.<br />
The Labor Government is committed to redressing women's<br />
poverty. The financial plight of many sole parent<br />
families is of particular concern to the Government. We<br />
have recognised the problem of unintended " poverty traps"<br />
which operate to-keep people particularly sole parent<br />
pensioners and beneficiaries dependent on social security<br />
payments when they, and society, would benefit if they were<br />
able to join the paid work-force. in his September<br />
statement on reform of the taxation system the Treasurer<br />
announced a number of measures to reduce poverty traps. The<br />
Government will continue-to take action to reduce poverty<br />
traps as resources permit. </p>
<p>The Labor Government is aware that the ex'isting maintenance<br />
system is sometimes ineffective and fails to provide,<br />
adequately for children in sole parent families. Some noncustodial<br />
parents are able to avoid making an appropriate<br />
contribution to the financial support of their children.<br />
The Government has under consideration a range of options<br />
to establish a sounder structure.<br />
The rapid growth in the number of women's refuges over the<br />
past twelve years, so that there are now more than 165<br />
refuges receiving State and Commonwealth Government<br />
assistance, is grim testimony to the toll of domestic<br />
violence. I am certain I have the full support of this<br />
House and of State Governments when I say this kind of<br />
violence is intolerable.<br />
The Labor Government has significantly increased funding to<br />
women's refuges and, through the Commonwealth-State<br />
Supported Accommodation Assistance Program, has provided<br />
guaranteed funding until July 1989. We will evaluate these<br />
services to ensure the assistance provided is adequate.<br />
Through sport women can acquire skills and enjoyment,<br />
improved physical health, and also greater self-esteem and<br />
a sense of achievement. The Government will continue to<br />
facilitate women's participation in sport.<br />
The areas covered in this statement make up our National<br />
Agenda for Women to the year 2000. on some I have<br />
foreshadowed immediate action by the Government. For most<br />
our strategies will be longer-term or will need to be<br />
further developed. Nonetheless, these are areas-* where the<br />
Government commits itself now to effective action to<br />
advance the status of women.<br />
I have already said that we want to give women a say on<br />
this National Agenda and a role in shaping its development.<br />
We will publish it widely and invite women to comment on<br />
it. Senator Susan Ryan, the Minister who assists me on the<br />
Status of Women, will lead this consultation process. We<br />
have already invited the National Women's Consultative<br />
Council to assist the Government in seeking women's<br />
responses.<br />
Drawing on these widespread consultations we will develop<br />
our proposed Agenda into a detailed set of strategies and<br />
policies to further improve the status of women in<br />
Australia over the next fifteen years.<br />
I trust that we can secure bipartisan agreement to our<br />
proposed Agenda. What we are seeking to achieve is a broad<br />
and comprehensive approach to improving the status of<br />
women, one that recognises women's important contribution<br />
to our society and which allows women to make free choices,<br />
unimpeded by discriminatory laws or practices. Under our<br />
National Agenda women in Australia will have a choice,<br />
women will have a say and women will have a fair go. I<br />
commend that National Agenda to the House. </p>
