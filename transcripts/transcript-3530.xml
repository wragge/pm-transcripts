PRESS STATEMENT NO. 400<br />
8 December 1974<br />
QUEENSLAND ELECTION<br />
The results in Queensland will disappoint all<br />
Labor supporters and disillusion all believers in a healthy<br />
Parliamentary democracy. I very much regret that Perc Tucker, an able<br />
leader and a close friend has lost his seat in Townsville.<br />
He fought a clean, honourable and vigorous campaign.<br />
It is unhealthy that with 36.4% of the vote<br />
Labor seems likely to hold only 10 or 12 seats out of 82.<br />
The Liberals under Sir Gordon Chalk won 4%<br />
more votes than the National Party under Mr Bjelke-Petersen<br />
and the increase in the Liberal vote since the last State<br />
election was much greater than the increase in the National<br />
Party vote. Nevertheless, thanks to Mr Bjelke-Petersen's<br />
gerrymander the National Party will hold at least 5 more seats<br />
than the Liberal Party in the new Queensland Parliament and<br />
Mr Bjelke-Petersen will remain Premier.<br />
Throughout the campaign the Liberals showed<br />
a much greater willingness than the National Party to<br />
co-operate with the Australian Government in the development<br />
of Queensland. The continued eclipse of the Liberals will<br />
do nothing to heal the deep division in the coalition.<br />
I regret that Queensland electors have been exposed to<br />
emotive tactics and inflammatory slogans that would win<br />
little attention in other parts of Australia. There are<br />
dark currents of intolerance and extremism at work in<br />
Queensland. I am convinced that honest policies of<br />
co-operation will eventually prevail over bitterness and<br />
division.<br />
