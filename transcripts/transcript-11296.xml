    <content><![CDATA[<p><font size="3">I am pleased to announce that Her Majesty The Queen has approved new regulations for the <i>National Medal</i>.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Since its creation in 1975, the <i>National Medal</i> has recognised long service by members of Australian police, fire, ambulance, correctional and emergency services and the Australian Protective Service.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The new regulations extend the Medal to members of voluntary search and rescue groups. The government considers that their service to the nation warrants recognition. Eligible voluntary search and rescue groups are encouraged to seek accreditation so that their members can qualify for the Medal.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The opportunity has also been taken to make the regulations more flexible by enabling easier aggregation of eligible service. This will benefit in particular those who have both military and civilian service.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">I commend the work of all the services whose dedication to the safety and well-being of the Australian community is recognised through the award of the <i>National Medal</i>.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">4 August 1999</font></p>
