FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 58/ 1969<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S MESSAGE FOR THE MOON<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton, has been invited<br />
by the National Aeronautics and Space Agency to send a message to the<br />
moon with the astronauts of the Apollo 11 mission.<br />
Microfilmed messages from a number of world leaders<br />
are to be sealed in a capsule and left on the moon's surface.<br />
Mr. Gorton's message reads:-<br />
" Australians are pleased and proud to<br />
have played a part in helping to make it possible for<br />
the first man from earth to land on the moon. This is<br />
a dramatic fulfilment of man's urge to go ' always a<br />
little further' to explore and know the formerly<br />
unknown; to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.<br />
May the high courage and the technical genius which<br />
made this achievement possible be so used in the<br />
future that mankind will live in a universe in which<br />
peace, self-expression, and the chance of dangerous<br />
adventure are available to all. JOHN GORTON." i<br />
