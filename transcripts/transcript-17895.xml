A report released today has warned that Kakadu - one of Australia's World Heritage Listed sites - is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>The report projects that higher sea levels will increase saltwater intrusion in freshwater habitats, threatening the abundance of freshwater species in Kakadu.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard was joined today by former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Greg Combet for the release of the report, Kakadu  -  Vulnerability to Climate Change Impacts.</p>
<p>The report comes almost 20 years after the Hawke Government banned mining at Coronation Hill and laid the groundwork for its inclusion in the Kakadu National Park.</p>
<p>This report sounds yet another warning bell about the dangers of climate change.</p>
<p>Kakadu is one of Australia's most iconic places  -  its plant and animal habitats, rivers, wetlands and estuaries are unique.</p>
<p>The landscapes and native wildlife we know and love will inevitably change - our challenge is to minimise the dangers, the impacts and the risks.</p>
<p>The report shows why it is critically important to take action now to combat climate change with the same commitment that the Hawke Government showed in protecting Kakadu in 1991.</p>
<p>The report, prepared for the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency,modeled the impacts of sea level rise on Kakadu's South Alligator River system for 2030 and 2070.</p>
<p>It found there would be a series of environmental, cultural and economic impacts which include:</p>
<p> * 	Higher sea levels and storm tide levels which will increase saltwater intrusion into freshwater habitats<br />
 * 	A reduction in the extent of freshwater vegetation, monsoon rainforest and woodlands<br />
 * 	A decline in the abundance of key species such as freshwater crocodiles, magpie geese and pig-nosed turtles in freshwater habitats<br />
 * 	A decline in the abundance of mud crabs, yellow chats and threadfin salmon in estuarine habitats<br />
 * 	A reduction in species of cultural significance including bush tucker<br />
 * 	Less access to sites of cultural significance and increased damage to tourism sites.</p>
<p>The report is a stark reminder of the ongoing challenge Australia faces to protect its magnificent natural assets.</p>
<p>The Hawke Labor Government made the right decision to protect Kakadu in 1991 when it stopped mining at Coronation Hill, despite strong lobbying by the mining industry and business groups.</p>
<p>Sections of the mining industry argued that the Government would “make or break the development of Australia's resources by its decision on Coronation Hill”.</p>
<p>It is clear, 20 years later, that the Hawke Labor Government acted in the best interests of the nation  -  protecting the environment without the impacts claimed by opponents at the time.</p>
<p>Now, in 2011, it is again a Labor Government that is making the right decision to reduce Australia's carbon pollution through the introduction of a carbon price.</p>
<p>The Government is already taking a number of actions to plan for and manage the impacts of climate change on Kakadu.</p>
<p>This report will provide a helpful tool for Government and stakeholders as we continue to improve our understanding and put in place measures to manage these threats.</p>
