PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA\,<br />
TUESDAY, 16 OCTOBER, 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Gentlemen, there have been some appointments made<br />
I would expect about half an hour ago by the Executive Council to<br />
the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.<br />
Mr Barney Williams R. D. Williams and Professor J. E. Isaac,<br />
have been made presidential members and Mr Jack Heffernan a<br />
member of the Commission. Mr Barney Williams has been Federal<br />
Secretary of the Australian Bank Officials Association since 1950<br />
and at ACSPA since 1956. He was recently, you will remember,<br />
appointed to the Bank. Board. Professor Isaac holds the<br />
Chair of Economics at Monash and has been on the Civil Aviation<br />
Tribunal I forget the name of it. Mr Heffernan is one of the<br />
joint Secretaries of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union and<br />
Secretary of the Metal Trades Federation of Unions. A Deputy<br />
President of the Commission, Mr Chambers, who for very many years<br />
before that was the Public Service Arbitrator and Deputy Public<br />
Service Arbitrator, has been appointed Deputy Chairman of the<br />
Prices Justification Tribunal.<br />
A couple of things of interest to Canberra. Cabinet<br />
has agreed to proceed with a new building for the High Court.<br />
You will remember that the winning design was announced last week.<br />
The National Capital Development Commission was authorised to<br />
enter immediately into a formal agreement with the architects<br />
for the new building. It is intended that the contract will be<br />
let and construction begun as soon as funds have been approved.<br />
The estimated cost will be $ 9 million.<br />
Cabinet also approved a site at Barton for a new<br />
building for the Attorney-General's Department. The estimated<br />
cost of the building is $ 5 million. However, there will be no<br />
expenditure in fact this year.<br />
Mr. Jones, the Minister for Transport, I believe made<br />
a press statement yesterday on Cabinet's decision concerning the<br />
report of the House of Representatives Committee on Road Safety.<br />
Cabinet also split up among various Ministers responsibility<br />
for following-up the recommendations in the Report of the Senate<br />
Committee on Mentally and Physically Handicapped Persons which<br />
was tabled in May 1971. Nothing was done about it in the last<br />
Parliament but Ministers are reviewing all the recommendations<br />
in that Senate Report.<br />
There are two pieces of legislation to be drafted.<br />
The legislation is being drafted but it doesn't say that every<br />
feature which we have asked to be drafted will be confirmed when<br />
the legislation appears in draft form. One of the features flows<br />
from the statement in the policy speech concerning a Law Enforcement<br />
Agency. You will remember that I said that the Commonwealth Police<br />
Force will be upgraded with better training, pay and conditions to<br />
meet the growing threat of political terrorism and organised crime. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Its facilities will be expanded and its role extended to that of<br />
the American FBI. The Commonwealth Police Force will become the<br />
key link between Australian Law Enforcement Agencies and<br />
Interpol to fight against international crime and the drug traffic<br />
must be primarily a national part. And there were some further<br />
details in the policy speech on that. Now flowing from that<br />
commitment, Cabinet yesterday considered proposals put forward<br />
by Senator Murphy, Attorney-General and Minister for Customs and<br />
Excise. Cabinet asked the Attorney-General to prepare for further<br />
consideration, draft legislation for the creation of a Law<br />
Enforcement Authority bringing together under one organisation the<br />
work of law enforcement currently performed by the Commonwealth<br />
Police, the A. C. T. Police, the Northern Territory Police and the<br />
law enforcement units within the Department of Customs and Excise.<br />
The legislation is to be drawn with provision for an independent<br />
tribunal to investigate complaints against police and on a basis<br />
that would provide for divisions within the authority appropriate<br />
to the A. C. T. and the Northern Territory. The Cabinet had in mind<br />
that when the legislation is passed, the Department of Customs and<br />
Excise will be abolished with part of its functions being<br />
transferred to the new authority and half being included in a<br />
Bureau of Customs. Additionally, Cabinet decided that arrangements<br />
should be put in hand now for the functions of the Department of<br />
Customs and Excise in the registration of British ships and in<br />
indigenous oil policy to be transferred to the Department of<br />
Transport and the Department of Minerals and Energy respectively.<br />
Mr Daly, the Minister for Services and Property, was<br />
authorised to prepare legislation to ensure disclosure of donations<br />
from now on to political parties.<br />
Are there any questions?<br />
QUESTION: Did Senator Murphy yesterday ask that ASIC be included<br />
in the group of forces to be brought under the control of one<br />
organisation. If so, and that was not done by the Cabinet, can<br />
you tell us why?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Senator Murphy made no such proposal; ASIC is not<br />
a law enforcement agency.<br />
QUESTION: Do you have any specific knowledge of donations by<br />
multi-national companies to opposition parties and further are<br />
you sure that multi-national companies haven't made donations to<br />
the Labor Party?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have no knowledge of specific companies which<br />
have made donations to the Liberal Party. I have no doubt that such<br />
donations figure very greatly in the donations that the Liberal<br />
Party has received in recent months. I don't recall donations<br />
of this character this is from overseas companies to the Labor<br />
Party. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, as a matter of clarification, in your<br />
policy speech you said " rates of taxation need not be increased<br />
at any level to implement a Labor Government's program"<br />
Subsequently, in relation to this year's Budget, you interpreted<br />
that as an undertaking not to increase taxes in this year's<br />
Budget just past. Is that generally an undertaking that during<br />
your term of office you will not increase taxation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have got nothing to add to that and I am not<br />
going to promote speculation on this issue.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, don't you think that you have in fact created<br />
speculation by the doubt you cast on it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No I haven't. If you ask questions and I answer<br />
questions on this it will create speculation. I recommend<br />
Kenneth Davidson's article today.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Daly's legislation. Will provision be made for an<br />
Appropriation for party funds to fight election campaigns.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That's not proposed in this legislation.<br />
QUESTION: Do you propose to introduce that legislation.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is no proposal.<br />
QUESTION: What is the attitude of your Government to efforts by<br />
Rhodesia to recruit migrants from Australia, and what would be<br />
the position of Australian passport holders who accepted an offer<br />
of assisted passage to Rhodesia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We are obliged under United Nations Security<br />
Resolutions to do nothing to support that regime or to facilitate<br />
movements into or out of Rhodesia. As you know, any Australian<br />
citizen who is promoting the policies of the Rhodesian regime would<br />
have his passport recalled. I don't say that there are not persons<br />
in Rhodesia in possession of Australian passports who are not<br />
performing functions which have no relation to the policies of the<br />
regime but if a person with an Australian passport were promoting<br />
the policies of the regime that is an abuse of the passport and it<br />
would be recalled.<br />
QUESTION: How?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There have been passports recalled before as you<br />
know. QUESTION: How would you do it if they were living in Rhodesia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If they didn't obey, you couldn't go and get it.<br />
QUESTION: Would you cancel it? </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It would be cancelled at the first place where<br />
it was presented outside Rhodesia. I suppose there isn't much<br />
* you can do about people who stay in Rhodesia but a passport is<br />
supposed to facilitate movement and any attempt to use it for<br />
that purpose would result in its cancellation.<br />
QUESTION: Senator Georges has inferred quite strongly that<br />
Dr Coombs had something to do with the removal of Mr Bryant<br />
from Aboriginal Affairs. Would you care to comment on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is no foundation for that allegation<br />
whatsoever. Needless to say, I don't discuss with Dr Coombs or<br />
with anybody other than my immediate ministerial colleagues any<br />
changes in the ministry.<br />
QUESTION: Senator Georges also suggested that Aboriginal Affairs<br />
had been become a disaster area littered with failures and excess<br />
expenditure. Do you think that a wider range of inquiry is needed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. present inquiries should be adequate.<br />
QUESTION: Do you anticipate any controversy over Mr Heffernan's<br />
appointment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't expect so. It would be generally<br />
acknowledged that Mr Heffernan's qualifications are very<br />
appropriate. He is a very well qualified person in the industrial<br />
field. I believe he will be able to help in the work of the<br />
Arbitration Commission very greatly.<br />
QUESTION: Last week some 57 members of your Labor Caucus sent<br />
out a petition calling on the Government not to recognise Chile<br />
until Caucus had discussed it. Will you go ahead in recognising<br />
Chile before Caucus has discussed the issue, and what's the<br />
position now?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We have taken the steps to recognise the Government<br />
that is there. That was done last Thursday. I think I told you<br />
a week ago that that is what would happen. There does seem to be<br />
some misapprehension about this. Therefore it might be useful<br />
if I were to point out to you that, of the countries which have<br />
had diplomatic relations with Chile not just recognition but<br />
those that have had diplomats accredited to Chile, in our region<br />
China, Indonesia and Japan have done what we have done; in the<br />
Commonwealth, Britain, Canada and New Zealand have done what we<br />
have done; countries which have fraternal governments which<br />
have done the same as we have are all the Scandanavian countries<br />
and West Germany. You probably know already that every Latin<br />
American country has done so except Cuba and every Western European<br />
country except Italy. New Zealand and Australia were the last of<br />
all the countries that I have mentioned to take the step of<br />
acknowledging the letter which the new regime had delivered to<br />
the foreign missions in Santiago. You know that we have expressed<br />
our disapproval of the method by which the regime usurped power<br />
by withdrawing our ambassador.<br />
QUESTION: Will he return, Sir? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: Not for the time being.<br />
QUESTION: The A. L. P. Platform lays down that the Federal<br />
Parliament should be clothed with supreme powers. Are you asking<br />
A. L. P.' s supporters within the trade union movement to join with<br />
you in supporting the incomes referendum rather than accepting<br />
the viewpoint of the trade union movement as annunciated by<br />
Mr Hawke?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Party's attitude was determined and<br />
published on Saturday week after the meeting of the Federal<br />
Executive in Adelaide. I would hope that most members of the<br />
party and supporters of the party would heed the party's wishes in<br />
this regard.<br />
QUESTION: Do you have sympathy for Bob Hawke's stand in opposing<br />
the referendum or whether you....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Not much.<br />
QUESTION: Or would you go to the other extreme and believe that<br />
he has actually been disloyal or breaking the rules of the party?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, of course I don't. He is entitled to come<br />
to his conclusion and to get support for it if he can. I think<br />
it's wrong but he would accept the same right on my party to<br />
come to a conclusion and seek support for it.<br />
QUESTION: Can you say what topics you hope to discuss with Chinese<br />
leaders during your forthcoming visit to Peking?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't got any specific list but as you can<br />
well believe, there are a great number of political and economic<br />
and cultural matters which we would like to discuss with them and<br />
which we anticipated they would like to discuss with us. There<br />
is no agenda at this stage.<br />
QUESTION: Will you protest against their nuclear tests, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, of course. I did when we were there together<br />
last time. I was the first Australian to do so, and I have been~<br />
followed by Dr Cairns who has done so as a Minister.<br />
QUESTION: When the High Court handed down its majority decision<br />
-on the Rhodesian Centre, you did suggest that you would ask the<br />
Postmaster-General to amend the Postal Act. Have there been any<br />
developments on that? </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There has been no submission on this since I<br />
said that. I think we will be doing so but there has not been<br />
a submission yet because, as you will appreciate, there is a<br />
very great deal of legislation which we have been considering.<br />
It looks as if we will be introducing and I hope passing almost<br />
200 Bills this year, which is easy the largest number and I<br />
would think incomparably the most substantial body of legislation<br />
that the Australian Parliament has every considered. There are<br />
some pieces of legislation which you will appreciate have to be<br />
done quite quickly. There are quite a number which will have to<br />
be through before the 1st of December when Papua New Guinea<br />
becomes self-governing. There are also quite a number of pieces<br />
which we would like to have on the Statute book in time for the<br />
Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights<br />
on 10 December. There are also a very great number of pieces<br />
which for various financial or tariff or administrative reasons<br />
have to be through before the end of December.<br />
QUESTION: Could I ask you some questions on the progress of the<br />
Appropriation Bill through the Senate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You can ask me one. You have the same right as<br />
anyone else.<br />
QUESTION: Could you give us an idea when you expect that to<br />
proceed to a vote in the Senate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Do you mind if I consider that question?<br />
COMMENT: Right.<br />
QUESTION: The second question is, what is your general attitude.<br />
Do you think the Senate is entitled to refuse Appropriation or<br />
Supply? PRIME MINISTER: No, of course its not. It would be quite<br />
unprecedented. QUESTION: And thirdly, Mr Anthony suggested that you couldn't<br />
use the Election Bill to go to the Governor-General to ask for a<br />
double dissolution. He said it is not something you can put on<br />
the shelf and keep there for a double dissolution. Mr Snedden<br />
has said that he doesn't know whether the causes for a double<br />
dissolution have evaporated or not. What is your opinion on this<br />
constitutional situation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Mr Anthony, not for the first time, is wrong;<br />
Mr Snedden, not for the first time, can't make up his mind. The<br />
position is quite clear that the conditions for a double<br />
dissolution are available for me to make a submission to the<br />
Government-General whenever I wish. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
QUESTION: I was wondering whether you could elaborate oiii the<br />
Bureau of Customs. Will it be attached to this new Law<br />
Enforcement Agency....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think so.<br />
QUESTION: And what about its functions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It will be primarily a revenue body in the same<br />
way as the Commissioners of Taxation are.<br />
QUESTION: What about by-laws?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The legislation is being drafted and I think it<br />
is enough for me to leave it at that. We are committed to<br />
establish a Law Enforcement Agency as we undertook in the policy<br />
speech. We are committed, when that legislation is enacted,<br />
to abolish the Department of Customs and Excise as at present<br />
constituted. QUESTION: Would you have been better able to attack inflation if<br />
you hadn't given an election promise not to raise personal taxes?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think the same answer as I have already given<br />
to the " Age" s; till applies. </p>
