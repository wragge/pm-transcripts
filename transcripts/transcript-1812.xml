ROYAL VISIT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Duke of Edinburgh, who is coming to Australia<br />
in May primarily to attend R. H. The Duke of Edinburgh's Third<br />
Commonwealth Study Conference", has accepted an itinerary which<br />
will take in visits to Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and<br />
Melbourne. The visit will begin with a ceremonial arrival in<br />
Canberra on Saturday 11 May and end on departure from Melbourne<br />
on Tuesday 4 June. It also provides for private weekends to be spent<br />
in Northern New South VWales before and after The Duke of Edinburgh's<br />
visit to New Zealand. The Duke of Edinburgh plans to travel from London<br />
to Australia in an Andover from The Queen's Flight and to use it<br />
for all internal air journeys. It will also be used for the Tasman<br />
crossings when His Royal Highness visits New Zealand ( 20 to 24<br />
May) and for the return journey to Britain.<br />
On the outward journey the Andover, after landing at<br />
Darwin on Friday 10 May to refuel, will go on to Mt. Isa where The<br />
Duke of Edinburgh will remain overnight. He will leave Mt. Isa on<br />
the following morning to arrive at Canberra at 12.30 p. m.<br />
On the homeward journey, His Royal Highness will<br />
travel in the Andover from Melbourne via Alice Springs ' a refueling<br />
stop) to Darwin and stay overnight. Cn the morning of Wednesday<br />
June His :. oyal Highness will leave Darwin en route for London.<br />
The itinerary in outline form is attached.<br />
