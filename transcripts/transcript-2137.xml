FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 79/ 1969<br />
IN~ TERIM COUNCIL FOR A NATIONAL FILM<br />

Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Earlier this year ( on 13 August), I announced that the<br />
Government had accepted the recommendation of the Australian Council for<br />
the Arts that an Interim Council be established to investigate and report on<br />
the form and location of a National Film and Television Training School.<br />
I have invited the following persons, who have accepted my<br />
invitation, to become members of the Interim Council:-<br />
Mr. W. P. Coleman, M. L. A. ( Chairman)<br />

Mr. S. G. Hawes<br />

Sir Ian Wark, C. K C. B. E.<br />
I am sure that each will make a valuable contribution towards<br />
the establishment of the National Film and Television Training School.<br />
The first function of the Interim Council will be to confer<br />
with appropriate representatives of the educational and film fields and to<br />
recommend to the Government an appropriate location for the School. The<br />
Council will then consider the matters necessary to bring the School up to<br />
the point of actual operation.<br />
