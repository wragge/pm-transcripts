FOR MEDIA 14 JANUARY 1991<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government I condemn in the<br />
strongest possible terms the acts of racism and outright<br />
harassment being suffered by Arab Australians and Australian<br />
Muslims. I condemn utterly any attacks made by racist * elements in<br />
Australian society against any group on the basis of their<br />
ethnic origin or religious or cultural adherence.<br />
I am particularly concerned that the recent increase in such<br />
incidents towards Arab Australians and Australian Muslims<br />
relates to the crisis in the Gulf, and reflects some sort of<br />
view that Arab and Muslim Australians may be in some way<br />
disloyal to Australia. Such a view would be utter nonsense.<br />
While Australia is participating in the Gulf Task Force in<br />
accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations, as a<br />
matter of principle, our country does not require of its<br />
citizens, whatever their background, that they agree with<br />
all the Government's policies. All Australians are free to<br />
disagree with the Government's policies, and to express<br />
their disagreements, without their loyalty being called into<br />
question. As a matter of fact, many Arab and Muslim community groups<br />
have expressed support for the fundamental principles<br />
underlying thea Government's response to the Gulf crisis. We<br />
naturally welcome that support without in any way<br />
denigrating the loyalty of those who hold other views.<br />
Freedom of speech and demonstration of belief are<br />
fundamental to Australia's Parliamentary democracy. Part of<br />
Australia's uniqueness today is the success with which a<br />
diversity of immigrants have been attracted to Australia and<br />
given the opportunity to commit their loyalties to a new<br />
nation without having that loyalty constantly questioned. </p>
