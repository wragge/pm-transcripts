PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT TO ASIA<br />
The broad itinerary for the visit by the Prime Minister,<br />
Mr. Holt, to Asia has now been determined. Mr. Holt will be visiting<br />
Cambodia, Laos, Taiwan and Korea at the invitation of the Governments of<br />
those countries. Mr. Holt will fly by Qantas to Singapore where he will spend<br />
the night of 28th March. He will then travel by a RAAF Viscount to Cambodia<br />

and overnight stop on 3rd April), Taiwan ( 4th April/ 6th April) and Korea<br />
( 6th April/ 9th April). He will arrive back in Sydney the following morning<br />
This will be Mr. Holt's third visit to Asia since becoming<br />
Prime Minister last year. The main purpose of this journey is to enable him<br />
to visit the four remaining countries of the area with which he has not<br />
previously made some personal contact. Each of these countries has a special<br />
significance for Australia. Mrs. Holt will accompany the Prime Minister. Officials<br />
included in the Prime Minister's party are Sir Laurence McIntyre, CBE,<br />
( Deputy Secretary, Department of External Affairs), Mr. D. J. Munro<br />
( First Assistant Secretary, Prime Minister's Department), Mr. R. A. Woolcott,<br />

Minister's Department). The Prime Minister's personal staff will comprise his<br />
Press Secretary, Mr. T. Eggleton. and his Private Secretary, Miss P. A.<br />
De Lacy. Dr. M. de L. Faunce of Canberra will serve as medical<br />
adviser to the party. Considerable press interest is being displayed in Mr. Holt's<br />
Asian visit and it is expected that a press party of about 14 representatives of<br />
press, radio and television will accompany the Prime Minister, travelling<br />
in a separate aircraft.<br />
