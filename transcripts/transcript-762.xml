SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE RT. HON. SIR<br />
RCERTMrTNZIES, ON T1IE OCCASION OF A GoADITATION<br />
CEiEMONIAL C0ITFELRTUG ON ! IIM THE HONODLARY DEGREE<br />
OF DOCTOR OF LAWS, AT THE UNIVERSITY OF<br />
EDINBURGHq SCOTLAND ON ! st JULY, 1963<br />
Your Royal Highness, Mr. Chancellor, My Lords and Ladies<br />
and Gentlemen This is every bit, as His Royal Highness said, a<br />
tremendous day in ily life. You know, in Australia we address<br />
our political people with a certain amount of offensive good<br />
humour. Nobody who leads a party or leads the Government in<br />
Australia is ever allowed to suffer from the illusion that he<br />
is important, because he really isn't and every time Ive gone<br />
abroad I have found here or there, a degree of importance that<br />
I have never been able to sustain in my own country.<br />
Of course I have been particularly honoured and delighted<br />
today. I went through the Ceremony of the Thistle this morning<br />
at St. Giles and came out as proud as Lucifer. I hadn't tripped<br />
on my robe, I hadntt stood in the wrong place. Everybody<br />
seemed to be quite content, even the Lord Lyon' But when I<br />
knew all that time that this was to be followed by receiving<br />
a Degree at Edinburghq I would like you to understand how full<br />
my cup of happiness was. This is for me, and for my wife, and<br />
for my elder son who has been here today, the greatest day in<br />
our lives. And, of course, this Ceremony is added to by the fact<br />
that His Royal Highness is your Chancellor. I've never been a<br />
Royal Highness myself, I've never had to suffer the slings and<br />
arrows of outrageous fortune which come to His Royal Highness0o<br />
And we in Australia of course, know him, We thinkq on the<br />
whole we know him pretty well. He has been out sometimes in<br />
great ceremony on a full Royal visit. Twice he's been out<br />
once to the Olympic Games, once to the Empire Games in a<br />
fairly informal sort of fashion and he has won a place in the<br />
Australian. heart which is second only tc that occupied by our<br />
Sovereign lady, The Queen. But perhaps if he had just been His<br />
Royal Highness Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, th.. se are<br />
very considerable attributes, but he has in his own proper<br />
person, added to them titles all around the world, which are<br />
appropriate to be mentioned in this famous University on this<br />
occasion because if there is one man in my own time who has<br />
raised the banner of education, who has encouraged the young,<br />
who has encouraged scholarship, who has encouraged widening the<br />
frontiers of scientific and technological knowledge in the world,<br />
it is your Chancellor, so that I venture to say that, at the end<br />
of his liLfe, which is bound to occur in another sixty years, not<br />
earlier I trust, but at the end of his life as he sits., as we<br />
are all supposed to sit as we get older, by the fireside,<br />
meditating on our sins of the past, extracting a little pride<br />
from the few good things that we might have done that applies<br />
to me he will be able to look back and know that nobody has<br />
done more than he has in these great causes to which I have<br />
referred and, therefore, while it is a singular honour for me to<br />
be given a D6gree at the University of Edinburgh it is a profound<br />
honour, an unforgettable honour, to receive it at the hands of<br />
Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Now, I must say that my sponsor today I thought did<br />
me rather well, rather better than well, perhaps, and I will,<br />
in future, forever love him forj. two reasons. One, he delivered<br />
his address in English, I mention that Si:, because a few<br />
years ago, some error having occurred at Oxford, they made me<br />
a Doctor of Laws, a Doctor of Civil Law of Oxford? and they<br />
had a variety of people, some distinguished scientists and<br />
even Margot Fonteyn, who was to receive a Degree as a Doctor<br />
of Music, of lovely gown, one of these things you see but<br />
rather lacy, and lovely, and we paused at the School of<br />
Divinity where we were given our tickets, you know our<br />
instructions. I didn't have any today, so I wouldn't know.<br />
But it turned out that every one of the Honorary Graduands<br />
had the public oratorts speech in Latin and in English but<br />
I was first I didn't get my copy until afterwards and so<br />
I stood in front of Lord Halifax, who was the Chancellor and<br />
I heard the public orator, in an impeccable modern pronunciation<br />
of Latin make a speech about me, and I had to follow it,<br />
He made two jokes, as all public orators do, particularly when<br />
they are speaking in Latin, and I say with boastful Menzies<br />
pride that I laughed at the right time, and when I came in<br />
here today, I was rather apprehensive because I thought, well<br />
now, I can cope with the public orator speaking in Latin in<br />
the modern pronunciation, but how can I cope with the public<br />
orator speaking in Latin with a Scots accent? And so I want<br />
to say thank you very much for having delivered me from this<br />
embarrassment, The other reason that I was delighted with him was that<br />
he did say something about what might almost be regarded as an<br />
adventitious association that I have with the University<br />
development in Australia It is one of the remarkable things<br />
in our generation, not perhaps mine but the current generation,<br />
that when the Second World War ended, the first result in my<br />
own country and, I think, Sir here was that there was a<br />
tremendous upsurge of demand for University training. In my<br />
own University I think there were 1,500 undergraduates, in my<br />
own town, and within a year or two after the war there were<br />
6,000, 7.000, 8,000, and the result has been that the pressure<br />
of demand on universities for university training has been<br />
phenomenal. The last estimate that I saw was that, by the<br />
turn of the century, in Australia, with a population of something<br />
under 11 millions at the present time, there would be<br />
100,000 undergraduates and this of course, has put the most<br />
tremendous pressure on universities. It is beginning to<br />
produce new universities. It is beginning to present problems<br />
of the most tremendous kind.<br />
Ten years ago, realising these as a university man<br />
myself, I performed one of the greatest acts of trickery ever<br />
known in Australian politics. I say nothing about your<br />
political scene I don't understand it. But I was in<br />
England and I saw Sir Keith Murray, Chairman of the University<br />
Grants Commission, and I said to him in a rather beguiling<br />
fashion, " What about coming out and being the Chairman of a<br />
Committee to investigate the university position in Australia?"<br />
And he said as a few other people have said in the last week<br />
or two, " Well I can't come unless Harold approves," because<br />
Harold Macmillan was then the Chancellor of the Exchequer, you<br />
see, and so I spoke to Harold Macmillan and he was in an<br />
amiable and relaxed mood, and he said, " Certainly, old boy, yes,<br />
why not?" He hadn't experienced then any of these recent<br />
vicissitudes this is ten years ago and so I stole Keith<br />
Murray. 0o0 / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
And then we set up a power~ ful Committee and it was only<br />
after I had set it up that I confessed to my Treasurer, or,<br />
as they would say in London, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,<br />
what I was doing, and he said, " Oh yes, old man well if you<br />
think that's all right, that's all right0" l " Well, I said,<br />
" I want to warn you that these Committees are not economical.<br />
This might cost a few million pounds," you see, and he being<br />
in an amiable mood, said, " Well old boy, if you feel that way,<br />
that's all right," and the result has been, you know, one step<br />
leading to another as it always does, but we are now spending<br />
almost as many millions as a Commonwealth on universities as<br />
we were spending tens of thousands when this thing began and<br />
in the result, it has meant that the universities, confronted.<br />
by utter bankruptcy with this pressure of demand on their<br />
resources, have been able to expand, to build.<br />
I see among my audience this afternoon the Vice-Chancellor<br />
of the University of Melbourne. If he could be persuaded to<br />
break all the rules of a Vice-Chancellor of the University of<br />
Melbourne and become vocal, he would tell you that this has<br />
revolutionized the position of the universities. Or course<br />
the work is not over. The work is beginning. We have great<br />
p-foblems. I wonder whether we can cope with 100,000, 200,000,<br />
whatever it may blxi, of prospective undergraduates by following<br />
along the old paths, by having the university of the old<br />
pattern. I think the time is coming when we must vary our<br />
activitiese Graduate, postgraduate, the higher levels of<br />
learning, the Ordinary pass degree, the Technological Institute,<br />
the Technical Institute these present the most tremendous<br />
problems to us and in all the work that I have to do about this,<br />
and all the thoughts that I have to engage in, I confess, once<br />
More, I have been remarkably assisted by the modern, forwardlooking,<br />
active view of your own Chancellor. This is of<br />
tremendous importance for the future of the world,<br />
For all that is a generalisation, yes, but not so<br />
generalised, perhaps, as you might think, because it is a<br />
problem that comes to all of us. But to come here into this<br />
place in Scotland is to be reminded that there are certain<br />
foundations of learning which continue to be of supreme importance<br />
for mankind, Scotland, of course, and I speak without any bias<br />
on this matter, Scotland has a unique place in the history of<br />
learning in the world. The farm worker of one hundred years<br />
ago saying, " No, no, Jock must go to school, He must do something<br />
better", and Jock, himself, with his son saying, " He m-ust go to<br />
Edinburgh he must have a Degree". Learning, the ambi. ticn for<br />
learning, the instinctive sense that the cultivated mind not<br />
the snobbish mind the cultivated mind, is essentia3 for mankind,<br />
has found its expression in Scotland more, I believe, than in<br />
any other country of the world0 And, of course Edinburgh<br />
itself with its ancient history embodies the whole of this idea,<br />
And th3 idea is not just to be able to take a Degree, to got a<br />
licence to practise the Law, or a licence to practise Medicine<br />
or whatever it may be. The whole idea has been to reach out<br />
to something which is at the moment, beyond you but which you<br />
may attain with efforz and with character and with skill,<br />
As Robert Browning said and it deserves to be the motto<br />
of all great universities " A man's reach should exceed his<br />
grasp, or what's a Heaven for." This is it a man's reach should<br />
exceed his grasp and so you don't want to have coming out of<br />
universities people who will say, even inadvertlentl y at some time<br />
in the future, " Well, I finished my education in 1961.11 The<br />
# a a 0/ 4 </p>
<p>people who finished their education when they took a Degree<br />
are not worth much, They may earn adequate incomes, but<br />
they're not worth much. " A man's reach should exceed his<br />
grasp, or what's a Heavurñ for," and so the graduate continues<br />
to be the student. TMe graduate continues to feel that there<br />
are, in the intellectual sense, fresh worlds to conquer,<br />
And if you, of Edinburgh, realise as I do, and perhaps you do,<br />
how much this great tradition in this mother country of so<br />
many of us, has done to stimulate the minds and spirits of<br />
people, to make them feel the future is more important -than<br />
the past, you would share my profound pride on this occasion,<br />
This is a great day for me; it's a great day<br />
for us, as I said, I am grateful to you, I am proud of the<br />
honour which you have done me, and I hope tl'at in time to<br />
come, when they write those rather cynical obituaries that<br />
they write about all public men and I am something of that<br />
kind in my own country they will te prepared to say that, at<br />
any rate, the fact that Edinburgh honoured him in this fashion<br />
is a mark in his favour. </p>
