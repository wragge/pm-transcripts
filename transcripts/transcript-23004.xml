    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government condemns the barbaric attacks on innocent civilians at the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
<p>The actions of this group of extremists have caused extensive loss of life and injury to many innocent people.Â  That an Australian was among those killed in the attack is a terrible reminder that Australia is not immune from acts of terrorism around the world and that Al Qaeda-linked groups continue to present a serious global threat.</p>
<p>Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the Australian victim and with all families of those killed and wounded in this attack<strong>, </strong>including the many Kenyans.</p>
<p>The latest advice from Kenyan authorities is that the death toll has reached 59 and that 175 people have been injured. However, the Government has been advised that these figures are likely to increase.</p>
<p>The Government remains committed to the global fight against terrorism and to do whatever we can to ensure the safety of Australians both at home and abroad.</p>
