FOR PRESS 24 Septemiber 1976<br />
ADDRESS TO THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS<br />
a Tonight I want to talk about the Government's economic strategy.<br />
W Since -the election,, we have followed a consistent plan to<br />
bring about economic recovery. We announced that strategy<br />
during the election campaign last year. It is the right strategy.<br />
It is the only strategy which holds out a real prospect<br />
of a soundly based recovery and long term expansion of job<br />
opportunities. The over-riding objective of that strategy is<br />
the eradication of inflation. The longer inflation goes on,<br />
the more damage it will do. It is the principle enemy of<br />
all those people coming into the workforce seeking jobs.<br />
It continues to encourage the misallocation of resources and.<br />
it is de-stroying our international competitiveness.<br />
The return to prosperity in Australian demands that the fight<br />
against inflation has top priority. Our strategy is designed<br />
to beat inflation and restore a soundly-based expansion<br />
* of job opportu-nities. The main essentials of that strategy<br />
are to bring Government spending under control; to provide<br />
specific assistance to private enterprise to encourage expansion;<br />
to encourage wage restraint through tax reforms, procedures<br />
of consultation and submissions to the Arbitration Commission;<br />
and encourage a national recognition of the common interests<br />
all Australians have in controlling inflation.<br />
Our strategy aims not at an overnight recovery. It is going to<br />
be a long haul. There are going to be difficult moments.<br />
The economic indicators are inevitably going to be mixed in<br />
the early stages of recovery.<br />
It is not going to be easy to repair the economy after the<br />
damage done to it by three years of incompetent Government.<br />
It is worth looking at the problems Australia was facing by<br />
the time of the election last year. The private sector<br />
was employing no more people than it had been three years<br />
earlier, even though during that period the labor force had<br />
expanded by about 370,000. Unemployment had risen to a level<br />
not recorded in this country since the 1930' s.<br />
Gross non-farm product in the December quarter of 1975 was still<br />
almost S percent below its peak level recorded two years earlier.<br />
The farm sector was in a state of collapse. The share of company<br />
profits in national income -remained depressed at about three-quarters </p>
<p>2.<br />
V of its long run norm. Real business fixed investment<br />
had fallen in the 1) eceniber quarter to its lowest level<br />
for almost three years. The Consumer Price Index in the<br />
December quarter was 14 percent above a year earlier and<br />
showed no real prospect of a sustained move down.<br />
The Australian economy was experiencing a malaise brought<br />
about by a Government that simply refused to understand<br />
the nature of the Australian econonicy. We are<br />
now on the road to recovery.<br />
The strategy we have adopted is widely accepted in the<br />
western world. While Australia was one of the countries<br />
which suffered most from excessive increases in Government<br />
spending, most of the major western countries suffered<br />
from the same ailment in some degree.<br />
There is now a remarkable degree of consensus and the<br />
general economic strategy to be pursued to bring about<br />
sustained economic expansion.<br />
The communique of the OECD Ministerial Meeting in June<br />
this year stated:<br />
" The basic premise on which this strategy rests,<br />
is that the steady growth needed to restore full<br />
employment and satisfy rising economic and social<br />
aspirations will not prove sustainable unless all<br />
member countries make further progrstoad<br />
eradicating inflation."<br />
In the light of this agreed approach, all OECD Governments<br />
have accepted that considerable care will have to<br />
be exercised to ensure that economic recovery proceeds<br />
gradually and steadily so as to avoid any resurgency of1<br />
inflationary pressures. They have recognised that the<br />
problem of unemployment, while a cause for considerable<br />
concern, is not capable of a quick solution.<br />
The OECD MN-inisterial Communique stated: ' Restoration of full<br />
employment and normal levels of capacity in the OECD area<br />
will be progressive and take a number of years.'<br />
OECD countries generally have rejected broad stimulatory<br />
action as a means of reducing unemployment.<br />
While infLlation is the principal problem, restoring steady<br />
arowth and reducing, unemployment is achievable not by increasing<br />
Government expenditure but by reducing the rate of growth<br />
of such expenditure, and adopting policies such as<br />
lightening the tax burden and more appropriate monetary policieswhich<br />
such restraint makes possible.<br />
What people have come to regard as the Keynesian approach is<br />
inappropriate in current circumstances. ./ 3 </p>
<p>The record in Australia shois. the inappropriateness<br />
of the traditional " pump priming" approach in periods<br />
of rapid inflation. In 1974-75 budget expenditures<br />
increased by 46 percent and the deficit rose by<br />
almost $ 2300 million. In 1975-76 there was a further<br />
increase in expenditure of 23 percent. It would have been<br />
much greater but for the direct and indirect measurcs<br />
the Government took over the latter part of the year.<br />
The deficit rose by a further $ 1000 million to $ 3585 mnillion.<br />
Over this period there was an increase o: E more than 30 percent<br />
in prices. Yet over this same period there was negligible<br />
growth in real output and unemployment increased by about 200,000.<br />
Virtually all major countries have , n-ow proposed reduction in the<br />
rate of growth of central Government spending between their<br />
last fiscal year and their present one. In the United-Kingdom,<br />
from 28 to 17 percent; in Canada, from 19 to 13 percent;<br />
in Germnany, from 19 -to 4 percent; in New Zealand, from 29 to<br />
percent; and of course, Australia, from 23 to 11 percent.<br />
Governments cannot spend their way out of recession when inflation<br />
is -running as it has b) een. To attempt to do so would lead,<br />
perhaps after a short burst in activity, to a deepening<br />
of the recession and a worsening of unemployment.<br />
The International Monetary Fund has emphasised this in a<br />
recent statement on the policies of the majoT-industrial<br />
countries. It has warned that:<br />
" Recent experience indicates that, unless the currently<br />
high rate of price inflation is brought down and inflationary<br />
expectations are greatly reduced, the effects of policies<br />
aimed at stimiulating growth and employment are likely<br />
to be short lived. Pur-suit of policies that seriously<br />
aggravated the problem of inflation could lead to a<br />
disorderly situation requiring sharp reversals of<br />
course the approach is very likely to be and should<br />
b) e a gradual one. But it would need to be<br />
adhered to firmly."<br />
Without the substantial restraint we have achieved in Government<br />
spending a number of the major measures we have taken this year<br />
to assist recovery-would not have been possible. These include<br />
full personal income tax indexation and some of the most<br />
important measures to assist business.<br />
Let me mention briefly the principal specific measures to assist<br />
business expansion that we have introduced since the election.<br />
A 40 percent tax allowance for investment in plant and equipment,<br />
that is available for investment expenditure by all sectors<br />
of the economy; relaxation of conditions attaching to convertible<br />
notes; suspension of quarterly collection of company tax<br />
Payments; exemption of new oil discoveries from the levy on<br />
crude oil; phasing out, over a pried of three years, of the<br />
levy on coal exports; a greatly reduced write-off period for<br />
mining development expenditure that will assist with cash flows<br />
of new projects, as well as deductions for expenditure on<br />
developing port facilities; an increase from S0 to 60 percent<br />
in the rate of retention allowance for private companies; 4 </p>
<p>a new system of trading stock valuation adjustment that applies<br />
at not less than 50 percent for 1976-77 taxable incomes.<br />
The tax reforms already introduced for both individuals<br />
and companies along with other measures I have mentioned<br />
have been made possible by the~ restraint we have imposed on<br />
Government spending. Such reforms arc not only important<br />
to recovery.<br />
This Government believes that people know best how to meet their<br />
own needs and that they should have the independent capacity<br />
to do so. In a system based on high personal taxation, such as<br />
the Labor Party supports, people become less and less able to<br />
meet their own requirements out of their own resources, and so<br />
become increasingly dependent on what a. few men in government<br />
choose to provide.<br />
At present, we have a personal tax system in which levels<br />
are too high, which undermines incentive, and contains many<br />
inequities.<br />
Our objective is a personal tax system which enables individuals<br />
to retain a largyer proportion of their earnings, which<br />
rewards initiative, and contains incentives to responsible<br />
independent action.<br />
Further tax reform is therefore an important priority of<br />
this Government.<br />
We are confident that the measures we have taken have paved<br />
the way to r1ccovery.<br />
Although: in the early stages of recovery the indicators are<br />
inevitably mixed, there are clear signs that the economy i~ s<br />
recovering. The estimates of national income and expenditure<br />
provide the most comprehensive and widely quoted estimates<br />
of overall activity in the economy.<br />
In the first half of 1976, gross domestic product seasonally<br />
adjusted and at constant prices rose by 3.4 percent after a<br />
fall of 1.4 percent in the December half year; latest estimates<br />
suggest that the savings ratio is falling. The proportion of<br />
household disposable income devoted to consuimptioln is estimated<br />
to have increased from 83.8 percent in the first half of<br />
1975 to 85.9 percent in the first half of 1976 after showing<br />
little change for three quarters finally consumption expenditure<br />
increased strongly in the June quarter; new capital raisings<br />
have increased greatly. In seasonally adjusted terms<br />
new raisings for listed -companies increased in the June quarter<br />
to a record $ 576 million. compared with quarterly average raisings<br />
of $ 296 million in the five quarters to March 1976.<br />
New monney raised by listed and unlisted mining companies<br />
in the June quarter was the largest amount in the<br />
two and a half year history of -thi~ s series and almost as much<br />
as was raised in the whole of 1975. Company reports for the last<br />
half of 1975-76 in most cases show greater profits are being<br />
earned. The movement inthe Stock Exchange indexes reflects<br />
a steady return of investor confidence. </p>
<p>An essential element in securing this recovery will bc<br />
continuation of wage restraint.<br />
In our submissions to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission<br />
we have emphasised the very great importance of wage and<br />
salary restraint in beating inflation and restoring employment<br />
opportunities. In recent judgements, the Arbitration Commission has accepted<br />
that full indexation is prejudicial to economiLc recovery.<br />
I believe there is a very widespread understanding of this<br />
fact around Australia. Indeed, I think it is very well<br />
understood by a great many trade union leaders and rank and<br />
file miembers. It is sometimes said that the Government<br />
wishes to reduce real wages. This statement, without<br />
explanation, seriously misrepresents th6 situation.<br />
Let me make two points. In a realistic sense there is no<br />
conflict whatever between the desire of everyone that real<br />
wages should increase and the government's present strategy.<br />
In fact, the strategy we are pursuing is the only one<br />
which offers assurance that real wages will begin to rise again.<br />
A more profitable business sector and rising real. wages go<br />
hand in hand. A soundly based economic recovery is the only<br />
condition under which consistent increases in real wages can<br />
be achieved.<br />
It is utter&gt;'% short sighted to emphasise -the short term<br />
consequences of policy without -regard to the longer term<br />
potential. Our policy is one aimed to create conditions in which stead~ y<br />
increases in real wages will be possible. In present circumstances,<br />
it is the only policy which can achieve this.<br />
The second point in this -regard, is that our policies as a<br />
whole, when our major reforms are taken into account aim to<br />
create a situation in which -there will be an increase<br />
in average real disposable income during 1976-77.<br />
Inflation will not be beaten unless there is cooperation between<br />
all sections of the community.<br />
If wage increases outside indexation do not remain small,<br />
then our objectives for inflation would be more difficult<br />
to achieve and increases in real disposable income less likely.<br />
I do not need to emphasise here that good industrial relations<br />
are very important to recovery. And the issue of industrial<br />
relations extends well beyond the question of wage and salary<br />
demands. The Government has had many discussions with the trade unions. ./ 6 </p>
<p>I doubt if there has been a Government in Australia which<br />
has consulted more with the trade union movement.<br />
The Government has responsibilities in this area. So<br />
does business.<br />
An increasing number of businesses are making special<br />
efforts to inform employees about the company's performance<br />
and prospects, and to involve employees in discussions.<br />
This is an area where the example of the best could be followed<br />
by all to the great advantage of everyone.<br />
The greater the extent to which employees have an understanding<br />
of the over-riding common interests they share with employers<br />
in a profitable and efficient enterprise, the more difficult<br />
it will be for pointless or politically motivated stoppages<br />
to occur.<br />
There are growing signs that trade union members are becoming<br />
more intolerant of political strikes caused by militant<br />
leaders trying to undermine recovery and create unemployment<br />
for ideological reasons.<br />
A potentially powerful weapon has been placed in the hands of<br />
union members dissatisfied with the performance of extremist<br />
officials by the new secret ballots legislation.<br />
During the election campaign last year we committed ourselves<br />
to legislate for secret postal ballots in all union elections.<br />
That legislation is now operating.<br />
The climate of industrial relations will obviously influence<br />
how rapidly unemployment is brought down.<br />
To ease the problems of finding work in the short term the<br />
Government is taking a number of measures. We are looking<br />
at terms of reference for a far reaching inquiry into the<br />
Commonwealth Employment Service. The Government believes<br />
it is now time for the operation and procedures of the C. E. S.<br />
to be completely reviewed. The Government has received many<br />
reports of firms being unable to fill vacancies in areas of<br />
high unemployment. Clearly, the C. E. S. must be geared to help<br />
solve this problems in the best-possible way.<br />
To assist those who cannot find suitable work where they live<br />
and who wish to move to where work is available we have<br />
announced a major scheme of relocation assistance.<br />
This is one of the most enlightened measures of unemployment<br />
assistance introduced anywhere. It is entirely voluntary. It is<br />
wider than the scheme we for-shadowed in our election programme<br />
last year. The Government will be monitoring it closely to see how<br />
the scheme is working.<br />
The Government has particular concern for the school leavers<br />
who will be looking for jobs in the coming months. Of the<br />
230,000 young persons who left school last year the great majority<br />
have now found jobs. But 12.700 were still unemployed at the<br />
end of August. / 7 </p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Government announced the introduction<br />
of a scheme whereby employers who take on school leavers<br />
who have been registered with the C. E. S. for not less<br />
than six months this year, will receive a subsidy. The<br />
subsidy will be paid for a six month period.<br />
We will review the operation of the scheme at the end of<br />
January. We have also announced changes to the N. E. A. T.<br />
training scheme, increasing certain allowances.<br />
The difficulty a number of young people have found i n getting<br />
jobs has greatly concerned the Government. Last week I<br />
announced that we were establishing a Committee of Inquiry<br />
into Education and Training. This inquiry will consider<br />
a very broad range of matters relating to education.<br />
Among these it will undertake the first major inquiry of its<br />
kind into the relationship between education and the labour market.<br />
In the course of its inquiry, the Committee will examine both<br />
secondary and post secondary education. This, of course,<br />
looks to the medium and longer term.<br />
But overall, our economic strategy is designed to achieve<br />
a reduction in unemployment by mid-1977, and it offers<br />
-the best hope for a soundly based expansion of job opportunities.<br />
In workzing towards recovery we are facing an enormous<br />
challenge as a nation. The damage wrought on the economy in the<br />
last three years has seriously set back the chance of building<br />
a decent life for Australians. For three disastrous years myth<br />
was more 1: flo-ortant than reality, words took the p) lace of action,<br />
posturing fo7-r the hard slogging work of providing effective<br />
Government. instead of helping Australians to achieve their<br />
objectives in life government was a positive hindrance.<br />
Enterprise was hamstrung and Government became a rapacious<br />
consumer of the nation's resources.<br />
Expectations were inflated far beyond the nation's capacity to<br />
provide. Now recovery is underway.<br />
Australia now has a Government which believes in the encouragement<br />
of enterprise, which is prepared to set priorities and to<br />
implement the strategy essential for recovery.<br />
We are governing in the interests of all Australians and not just<br />
a narrow., section of the community. Consolidating the recovery is<br />
going to z ake hard work and determination. I am confident<br />
that w,. e will succeed. 000000000 </p>
