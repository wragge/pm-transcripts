-FOR PRESS P. M. No. 42/ 1966<br />
ORD RIVER PiZOJECT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, ir. Harold Holt<br />
Cabinet devoted a good deal of time yesterday to a<br />
considerable body of material which it had before it relating to<br />
the Ord River Project.<br />
The Government has already demonstrated its interest<br />
in the development of the Ord and its willingness to assist the<br />
Western Australian Government in the hope that an extensive<br />
agricultural settlement can be maintained in the area utilising<br />
the water of the Ord for the irrigation of the fertile soil which<br />
it can serve. The Commonwealth has studied closely the results of<br />
the research and practical farming which have already been carried<br />
out there. Some of the cotton yields have been very encouraging<br />
and no doubt can be improved as a result of further research and<br />
additional farming experience.<br />
The Commonwealth Jovernment approaches the question<br />
of second stage development of the Ord in a helpful spirit. It<br />
has noted however that latest estimates of cost are of the order<br />
of $ 70 million an. this amount seems likely to escalate against<br />
a background op rising costs in Western Australia as it moves<br />
through the greatest industrial boom in its history.<br />
There are some problems associated with depending on<br />
cotton as a single crop and these need to be carefully considered.<br />
It would not be in the general interest to establish a community<br />
depending upon a single crop which faces falling world market<br />
prices and either has to rely indefinitely on subsidised<br />
production or proves unprofitable if subsidy is withdrawn.<br />
Wje are aware of the principal advantages which could<br />
flow from the larger settlement on the Ord that adoption of Stage<br />
2 would encourage. The creation of an attractive township at<br />
Kununurra, and the enthusiasm of those . ho have taken up farm<br />
areas are encouraging features.<br />
However, we have noted that there is at present a<br />
good deal of pressure on resources in Western Australia, including<br />
a shortage of labour for construction purposes. It seems an<br />
inappropriate time, therefore, to launch another major construction<br />
project. Any delay arising from this cause can be usefully<br />
employed in further analysis of the potentialities of a variety of<br />
kinds of production. The further time will also bring additional<br />
information on crop yields, the incidence of pests and cost per<br />
acre of their control, and other matters of this sort.<br />
In order that consideration of the project can proceed<br />
in a manner satisfactory to both the Commonwealth and Western<br />
Australian Governments, I have arranged with the Acting Premier of<br />
Western Australia for a meeting to take place next week between<br />
three Commonwealth Ministers the Treasurer the Minister for<br />
National Development and the Minister for tAe Interior and<br />
Ministerial re resentatives of the Government of Western Australia.<br />
The exchange of views and information should assist both Governments<br />
in tihe further consideration we believe to be necessary<br />
before final decisions are taken.<br />
CANBERRA, 18th May, 1966 </p>
