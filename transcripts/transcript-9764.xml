    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>22 SeptemberÂ 1995</strong></p>
<p>E&amp;OE.....</p>
<p>Â <br /><strong>PM: </strong>This chap beside me is Tony Robinson he is the Labor candidate inÂ Chisholm. This is one of the seats we will win at the next election. MrÂ Wooldridge is, of course, the Member, is basically a sort of privateÂ person who happened to find himself in the Federal Parliament, butÂ someone who basically, doesn't like the public business the businessÂ of serving the public and the nation, and wants to do it from his officeÂ desk with a press release. Well, our candidate here is out hereÂ hotfooting it around the community and we think this is a seat which isÂ likely to fall our way when the election is held. And one of the reasonsÂ it is going to is industrial relations. What we saw today in TheÂ Australian is " Court's IR Bill Threat to Howard", and the reason it is aÂ threat to Howard is because it has all of the ugly features of the LiberalÂ Party's unrestrained industrial relations policies and attitudes. In hereÂ it says they were actually threatening unions with de-registration if theyÂ try and opt out of the State industrial system by transferring to aÂ Federal award. So, all those employees who are protected in VictoriaÂ against Jeff Kennett's legislation by moving to Federal awards, andÂ those who in Western Australia will try and do the same, the LiberalsÂ will try and be up on them in their own state, but were John Howard toÂ become Prime Minister, of course, he would catch'the lIdt of them underÂ the Federal legislation, and they would all end up losing the things theÂ award protections now give. Such as penalty rates, holiday leaveÂ loading, the overtime options and the rest. As I indicated in theÂ Parliament yesterday, this could mean somewhere between $ 4000-<br />$ 5000 to an average working person, and there I quoted truck-drivers,-nurses and labourers.</p>
<p>So, it is a very real issue John Howard has, for all of his political life,Â wanted to hop into working people and cut the incomes of the bottomÂ half of the community. And what you are seeing here is Court * r Â essentially blowing his game, just as Jeff Kennett did in 1992 ahead ofÂ the 1993 Federal Election with Fightback and Jobsback. So, industrialÂ relations is going to be a real issue because the Liberals say they won'tÂ keep Labor's no disadvantage test we say sure, lets have enterpriseÂ bargaining which we have introduced lets have flexibility, but notÂ flexibility down. Not cuts overall. So, we have a thing called the nodisadvantageÂ test they won't have it. And as a consequence, whatÂ the Liberals want, and what they have always wanted, is not justÂ flexibility which they call IR reform but flexibility down, which is reallyÂ pay cuts. So, today, you are seeing it again. I mean, I don't think theÂ people need the tom-toms beating any louder than this to know thatÂ Howard and Reith have in store a draconian industrial relations policyÂ which will cut the wages of working Australians to pieces.</p>
<p><strong>J: </strong>But they haven't finalised their policy yet how can you be so sure thatÂ that's what they plan?</p>
<p><strong>PM: </strong>They have been at it for years. I mean, they have been saying evenÂ this year John Howard has been saying that Jobsback was basicallyÂ the right framework. Reith is saying that he would take great pride inÂ being able to put such a policy into place this is in the last couple ofÂ weeks. And if they don't, what is their objection to Labor's policy? WeÂ have got enterprise bargaining far more in the Federal sphere than inÂ any state. We have had high productivity growth somewhere betweenÂ 2 we have got low inflation, we have got a high profit share inÂ the economy. What is wrong with it? What is wrong with it, of course,Â is they want to cut the wages of working Australians, that's what isÂ wrong with it.</p>
<p><strong>J:</strong> You're saying that you want to look after blue-collar workers which areÂ traditional Labor voters, but one of your former Labor Ministers, MickÂ Young has said that, basically, his research has shown that it will be aÂ struggle for Labor to retain those traditional blue-collar loyalists.</p>
<p><strong>PM</strong>: That was a view he has taken off his work in Queensland he wasÂ given the job of looking at the Queensland outcome. Well, I don'tÂ doubt that the Queensland Labor Government lost blue-collar workingÂ people, but I don't think that's true of Federal Labor. Because we haveÂ put into place 600,000 jobs not 60,000, but 600,000 3 safety netÂ adjustments, plus a strong real increase in real wages with low inflationÂ these are all the ingredients of support. And, of course, all theseÂ other things like the home childcare allowance, the generalisedÂ childcare rebate all done since the last election, are all completelyÂ faithful to what one may call the blue collar constituency.Â </p>
<p><strong>J: </strong>Mr Beazley has conceded that there is some softness in the level ofÂ support amongst the blue-collar workers for the ALP?</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> Well, there is softness in all categories of support for all GovernmentsÂ in any Parliament. It's a matter of making sure they are solid when youÂ need them.</p>
<p><strong>J:</strong> Kim Beazley has also said that there are disadvantages in strongÂ leadership mainly in your strong leadership .( inaudible).. what sortÂ of response do you make to that?</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> Who said this?</p>
<p><strong>J:</strong> Kim Beazley.</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> You must have mis-interpreted him there is no substitute forÂ leadership anywhere. Anywhere, and in any environment. And theÂ problem that they have with John Howard is that he is weak andÂ sneaky. He is weak he doesn't stand for things, you can see it withÂ his Party, you can see it in the Parliament, you can see it with hisÂ policies. And he is sneaky because he is trying to pretend all the timeÂ that he has policies for people. When he says " I don't want to show<br />that Paul Keating my policies", what he is really saying is that " I don'tÂ want to show the public my policies". It's not me he is hiding hisÂ policies from it's the public. And there can be no honesty andÂ integrity in public life without policies. So if you want to be sneaky, the Â sneakiest thing to do in public life is to keep your policies in the bottomÂ drawer to let the public find out about them after the election.</p>
<p><strong>J: </strong>Vince Fitzgerald says that it's not even controversial that foreign debt isÂ keeping the whole interest rate structure higher isn't that true?</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> No. Australia's current account imbalance always puts some questionÂ into the exchange markets, and into the longer rates the ten yearÂ bond rate etc. But all the short-term interest rates as Ralph Willis wasÂ making the point yesterday are set off the inflation rate. They set offÂ demand for money, they set off the growth. We have got an economyÂ growing at 4% a year. The Japanese have an economy growing at halfÂ a percent a year, the Europeans have an economy growing at aroundÂ 1 a year. So, when you have got a stronger growth economy,Â providing more jobs and more prosperity, the price of money risesÂ because more people are bidding for it.</p>
<p><strong>J:</strong> But Mr Keating, it was you who drew the connection between highlevelsÂ foreign debt and Australia being in an economic difficulty?</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> I have just given you the answer to that you have got to understandÂ the nuances.</p>
<p><strong>J: </strong>What about Dr Vince Fitzgerald's comments this morning?</p>
<p><strong>PM: </strong>Well, Vince is a sour ex-bureaucrat. I mean, Vince gets the old lemonÂ in the mouth every morning and gives a good hard suck on it. I mean,Â you will never get any cheerful comments out of Vince about theÂ economy, because Vince thought he should have been Secretary of theÂ Treasury and a few other things, and never made it. I mean, look, theÂ fact of the matter is Australia, and I think Australians shouldÂ understand this thing about the debt. We have got $ 180 billion of debt,Â but juxtaposed against that, we have got $ 135 billion of assets offshore.Â The Government debt is only 4% of the debt. And the debt isÂ borrowed by the BHPs and the CRAs and companies like that, who canÂ service the debt. It's very much akin to a domestic household youÂ don't have enough savings yourself to buy your first house, so youÂ borrow from the community to build yourself an asset. Australia doesn'tÂ have enough savings to keep funding this massive nvestment, so weÂ borrow from the rest of the world to build a stronger AustralianÂ economy. That's why it's there. But to run around trying to beat up aÂ scare about it is crazy. I mean, what does Mr Howard say about theÂ employment growth? About the 600,000 jobs? The 2-3% inflation?Â The strong investment growth? These are conditions I have not seenÂ in 26 years of political life.</p>
<p><strong>J: </strong>But Dr Fitzgerald is your principal savings advisor?</p>
<p><strong>PM: </strong>He is not our principal savings advisor at all.</p>
<p><strong>J: </strong>Mr Keating, should the ABC continue with pay TV?</p>
<p><strong>PM: </strong>Oh, the ABC we would need a seer to decipher what goes on in theÂ dark recesses of the ABC.</p>
<p><strong>J: </strong>How do you feel about the...</p>
<p><strong>PM: </strong>. we pay them more than we pay the state of Tasmania do we getÂ value for it? It's a moot point.</p>
<p><strong>J: </strong>How do you feel about the Packer-Murdoch arrangements?</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> That's up to them. They're a couple of big, burly characters who canÂ look after themselves.</p>
<p><strong>J: </strong>Richard Alston says that there should be an inquiry into it, thatÂ basically Mr Lee has been caught asleep at the wheel</p>
<p><strong>PM: </strong>The last time I saw Richard Alston, I was doing a campaign launch inÂ Western Sydney to a news conference, which was arranged by me. HeÂ wanted to get into it, and while he was waiting for me, he was hiding inÂ a bush. When I finished, he crawled out of the bush I had not walkedÂ three yards and he appeared like some sort of apparition. You know,Â he was down there with the mulch and the bugs and the bush. WhichÂ is, by the way, where he belongs.</p>
<p><strong>J: </strong>Mr Keating, are you concerned about relations between France andÂ Australia after the French Ambassador said that your attacks on FranceÂ as a colonial power have taken their toll?</p>
<p><strong>PM:</strong> Well, I think that I am pleased that the French have noticed this LaborÂ Government's protests about their mindless policy of exploding nuclearÂ devices in the Pacific, when the premium has to be on non-nuclearÂ proliferation. I mean, even in France's own best interests, they shouldÂ be always putting a premium under the non-proliferation regime,Â because if you are a country with nuclear weapons, the thing not to doÂ is let the country next door get them, to keep you hegemony. TheyÂ don't even seem to understand that self-interest point. So, at a timeÂ when other nations are experimenting with nuclear programs, theÂ problem about a democracy like France exploding a weapon such asÂ this, is to say the proliferation is okay. So, if the Australian protest isÂ being registered strongly in the Elysee Palace, if it is being registeredÂ strongly in Paris and the French nation, then that's exactly what weÂ hope it will be.</p>
<p><strong>J:</strong> Does it concern you that relations may be under threat?</p>
<p><strong>PM: </strong>Well, as I have said before we are not here having a dispute with theÂ French people we are having a dispute with the French GovernmentÂ about a bad decision that it has taken.</p>
<p>ends.</p>
