<p>A new IT-enabled centre in Darwin will help to transform Indigenous teaching, learning and research across northern Australia.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister today officially opened the Australian Centre for Indigenous Knowledges and Education (ACIKE) in Darwin.</p>
<p>The Centre will use technology to overcome the barrier of distance.</p>
<p>It will include new research and teaching facilities and a literacy laboratory which is connected online to 16 sites throughout the Northern Territory. It will be a major boost for interactive distance learning.</p>
<p>The Centre is located at the Casuarina campus of the Charles Darwin University and is a joint venture between the University and Batchelor Institute for Indigenous Education.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is committed to improving the participation of Indigenous Australians in higher education and this Centre will help to achieve that.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government contributed $24.8 million to the $27.5 million centre with the University providing the remainder.</p>
<p>The centre is part of a broader $39 million project that focuses on delivering better facilities for Indigenous teaching, learning and research.</p>
<p>The other elements of the project include new student accommodation and a mobile learning unit to reach out to Indigenous students in remote or regional areas. These are now completed and in use.</p>
<p>Federal funding for the project comes from the Education Investment Fund which is providing more than $4.5 billion to support infrastructure projects in the higher education, VET and research sectors. </p>
