TRANSCRIPT OF AN INTERVIEW WITH WARWICK BEUTLER, ABC, THE<br />
WORLD TODAY, 12.15 PM, 20 JUNE 1985<br />
BEUTLER: Mr Hawke you say there is broad community support<br />
for your preferred tax position. Yet we've seen strong<br />
opposition to all or part of it from various sections of<br />
the community. Where's the evidence for your contention?<br />
PM: Well let me say this, that if you look at the<br />
proposal that's been put up, I haven't seen any evidence yet<br />
of the emergence of an alternative proposal. What you've seen<br />
is objections, questions to certain elements of the proposal.<br />
That's not only legitimate, its certainly to be expected.<br />
Now, if we'd had the position where you're really seeing the<br />
emergence of a position where it said, now here is the way to<br />
go, as distinct from the preferred Government position, then<br />
I think that would be different. Now I accept the adequacy<br />
of what you say, that there has been widespread criticism of<br />
elements. Now that's right, what we will do between now the<br />
Summit is to continue to put what, on the evidence available to<br />
me, and the Treasurer, makes us believe that our preferred option,<br />
with admitted difficulties, is still the best way of going.<br />
If up to and at the Summit we get compelling evidence that<br />
there is a better modified, and qualified way to go, then that<br />
will be done.<br />
BEUTLER: Well whose told you that they wart a consumption<br />
tax? PM: Well, not in order of priority. The Opposition.<br />
BEUTLER: But why should you do it because of the Opposition.<br />
PM: Now wait a minute. I'm siaiply saying that one<br />
shouldn't ignore the Opposition entirely, although most sensible<br />
* people do. But nevertheless they speak for some people.<br />
They say they're in favour of it. That is until Mr Sinclair<br />
said he wasn't. But he got put back into the cart by<br />
Mr Peacock, apparently. And he said, according to today's<br />
press, that he does support it. The Business Council<br />
hasn't said that they oppose the consumption tax. And<br />
sections of the Trade Union movement haven't said they<br />
oppose it. But they have questions about its implementation<br />
or the structure of the red~ uction indirect income tax that<br />
should be associated with it. Sections of the Retail Trade<br />
have said, directly to Mr Keating, that they support it. So<br />
at this relatively early stage I'm not surprised by question<br />
marks that are being raised. I'll accept my obligation </p>
<p>2.<br />
as will the Treasurer, of explaining, as I say on the<br />
evidence available to us, why we think that it's the best<br />
way of going. Now, it will be up to others, and we will<br />
listen to them, to say well look perhaps there should be<br />
modifications. BEUTLER: Well how do you answer the latest criticism of<br />
the business community, that your plans will reduce private<br />
investment, will reduce growth, and will reduce employment<br />
opportunities. PM: Well I've come to understand during a fairly long<br />
life now in the economic field in Australia, that the<br />
capacity to making ambit claims is not the prerogative of the<br />
Trade Union movement. The business community is just as<br />
capable of making ambit statements as is the Trade Union<br />
movement. BEUTLER: And that's all this is?<br />
PM: It's certainly not accurate.<br />
BEUTLER: Have you and business fallen out?<br />
PM: Well, I don't know what it was that we were in,<br />
out of which we've fallen. I think that sounds grammatically<br />
correct. I believe that over the period that I've been in<br />
public life I've developed a good understanding and rapport<br />
with the business community. And certainly in Government we've<br />
not by rhetoric, but by decisions, have shown that we're about<br />
improving the climate for the private sector. And the<br />
creation of the 375,000 jobs that's characterised our period<br />
in Government has been evidence of that... Now, the business<br />
community has on a number of occasions applauded the<br />
capacity and determination of my Government to make the<br />
decisions that are necessary to get economic growth going.<br />
And I believe they still had the view that we are an extremely<br />
competent Government in that respect. Now, they are no<br />
different from anyone else in the community when the question<br />
of tax reform comes up they are going to be predominantly<br />
looking at it from the point of view, does this effect us<br />
adversely in some particular way... I'm not worried about<br />
that, but I want to say this, that I believe that at the<br />
Tax Summit the representatives of the business community<br />
will make a constructive contribution.<br />
BEUTLER: Well you've always expressed confidence that the<br />
Union movement will qome ab~ oard the cart. But what's going to<br />
entice them to do so?<br />
PM: Well very simply these facts. Firstly, the way<br />
the existing system has been decaying has meant that an<br />
increasing burden has been imposed upon their membership.<br />
At this point of time 39% of full-time wage and salary earners<br />
are paying 46 cents of every marginal dollar they receive<br />
in tax. If this is allowed to go on, by the end of this<br />
Parliament well over 50% will be in that situation, and that<br />
will be an intolerable position. It will mean that the 46 cents </p>
<p>in the dollar rate will come in at $ 17,000 of income. That's<br />
intolerable. Will be unacceptable to working men and women,<br />
and I believe to their organisation. Secondly, if nothing is<br />
done substantially about the existing system, then you will<br />
have a continuation of the position whereby more and more of<br />
a burden is being imposed on ordinary wage and salary earners.<br />
That is intolerable and unacceptable with the working men and<br />
women of this country. So something substantial has to be<br />
done to reduce, and to reduce significantly, marginal rates<br />
on the dollar earned by people in employment. That can only<br />
be done I believe if you have a significant and equitable<br />
alternative base of revenue. I believe that the broadening<br />
of the tax base, the direct tax base that's involved in the<br />
proposal in the preferred option, together with the consumption<br />
tax which will be very very much more than compensated by<br />
substantial direct tax cuts, plus the fact that by the broad<br />
based consumption tax you get what is referred to as a fiscal<br />
dividend. That is a contribution to the revenue from those<br />
very substantial, high level income earners who don't pay<br />
any tax at the moment. All those things mean that the ordinary<br />
wage and salary earner in this country, and those dependent<br />
upon them, will be very very much better off directly and they<br />
will also be saved, as I say, from an increasing burden that<br />
will inevitably be imposed upon them if we don't reform the<br />
system.<br />
BEUTLER: Why don't you exempt food from the consumption<br />
tax?<br />
PM: Because all the advice that we have been given<br />
from other countries, and from independent experts is that<br />
there should not be exemptions. Because once you start<br />
having substa ntial exemptions it means these things. Firstly,<br />
it means that the burden upon those who have to carry the<br />
administration of the tax, the retail outlets. They have to<br />
have a more complex cash register system and and accounting<br />
system. Secondly it imposes the inevitable situation<br />
upon governments of any complexion that they will be having<br />
lobby group pressures upon them to exclude this, to exclude<br />
that;' to exclude that. And you'll lead to the situation that<br />
you have now in the wholesale tax system, which brings in<br />
just under five billion dollars now, which is imposed upon<br />
some goods and not upon others. Which has some categories<br />
in the 7% tax, some in the 20% and some in the 32 with no<br />
logic, rhyme or reason. And it represents the fact that<br />
successive governments have responded to political lobby group<br />
pressures upon them. So for reasons of administration and of<br />
logic and efficiency you can't go down the path of substantial<br />
exemptions. BEUTLER: You say substantial exemptions, do you rule out<br />
any exemptions at all? </p>
<p>4.<br />
PM: Well you talked about food, and that's a<br />
substantial category. I had put to me this morning, the<br />
proposition that for instance disabled people, wheelchairs,<br />
that in the absence of any arrangement in respect of them<br />
you could be imposing a new burden on them which doesn't<br />
exist now. Now, I simply said that its conceivable that in<br />
some areas of medical, physical disability considerations,<br />
and I'm saying this without commitment, but its conceivable<br />
that you may be able to have such a fence around things like<br />
that which made it quite incapable of extension into general<br />
areas by way of precedent. And that would be worth looking<br />
at. However it may be the case that because of the difficulties<br />
to which I've referred about exemptions there may be other<br />
ways of compensating people in those sorts of circumstances.<br />
BEUTLER: Mr Hawke, what is negotiable at the Summit.<br />
You've told us what isn't negotiable what is negotiable?<br />
PM: When I've said what isn't negotiable, what I've<br />
put firmly, and what Mr Keating has put fir. mly, our strong<br />
belief as towhat is best. But I'm not closing my mind, nor<br />
is Paul Keating, to listening to, hearing what people have<br />
got to say about the whole of the white paper, the whole<br />
of the package.<br />
BEUTLER: He seems to be closing off a hell of a lot of it<br />
though. PM: No. I think he is saying, and, I'm saying, look<br />
we've got an obligation upon us. We told you the people of<br />
Australia, in the election campaign, that we would make tax<br />
reform central in the life of this next Parliament. We then<br />
said we'd accept the obligation of analysing the inadequacies<br />
of the existing system we've done that. We said further<br />
we'd accept the obligation of putting to the people of Australia<br />
avenues for bringing about a tax system which would be fair,<br />
efficient and simple. Now, on all the evidence available to<br />
us we believe that the preferred Option is the one best<br />
calculated to do that. And we're saying we think that's<br />
what should happen. And we don't believe you can improve that<br />
by saying we'll exempt this, exclude that from this concept.<br />
But that doesn't mean, as far as we're concerned in any sense,<br />
that we won't listen to what people have got to say. We have<br />
come with integrity to a position which we believe represents<br />
the best. If further evidence comes out which should suggest<br />
in any way that there would be sensible qualifications<br />
to achieve the objectives if the broad community wants to,<br />
well then we'll be open to persuasion.<br />
BEUTLER: Mr Keating, by taking the high profile, has<br />
appeared at some stages to overshadow you. That you're<br />
being dragged along by him. Has he tended to undermine<br />
your authority? </p>
<p>PM: No.<br />
BEUTLER: Not at all?<br />
PM: No.<br />
BEUTLER: How are you going to get this through Caucus?<br />
PM: Well I would believe that if the vote were taken<br />
in Caucus now they would be in favour of the preferred option.<br />
But that's not the way we go about things. The members of<br />
the Caucus are important members of the community as a whole.<br />
They will be listening to the debate, they will be studying the<br />
White Paper, and I believe that out of those processes they<br />
would come to see that the preferred Option is the best way<br />
of going about it.<br />
BEUTLER: There's still a lot of opposition in the Caucus?<br />
PM: Yes there is.<br />
BEUTLER: Even from your own faction.<br />
PM: But I believe that as I said a moment ago, I believe<br />
there would be a majority position there for the preferred<br />
position. But I'm not trying to impose now some position upon<br />
them. Mr Keating has spoken on a number of occasions to the<br />
Economic Committee of Caucus, and at length. And I've had<br />
conveyed to me that as a result of those sessions that Paul<br />
has had with the Economic Committee of Caucus that there has<br />
been a substantial acceptance of the views that he's putting.<br />
But I'm not trying to pre-empt the position of Caucus because<br />
they are fully entitled to be part of the process of<br />
consideration up to and including the Summit and trying to<br />
make an assessment themselves then. In the post-Summit<br />
situation, with us, with the Cabinet, with the Ministry, of<br />
what is the best way to go.<br />
BEUTLER: Where you serious when you suggested that you'd<br />
rather lose government than see these reforms fail?<br />
PM: No that's not an accurate way of putting what I<br />
said. What I said was this, and J1 don't in any way retreat<br />
from what I'm saying, is that if I came to the view after the<br />
Summit that there was a large measure of support satisfying<br />
Principle Nine, for the approach that we're talking about<br />
But that you still had a situation that you might be disaffecting<br />
some people, and that you ran a risk in those circumstances of<br />
losing office, I would not ' be diverted because I believe that<br />
the ordinary people of Australia, the ordinary men and women<br />
of Australia, and those dependent upon them have increasingly<br />
been subjected to a position where they are carrying an<br />
infinitely greater, more inequitable burden than they should.<br />
In economic efficiency terms I know that the future wealth<br />
of this country has been prejudiced by a continuation of this<br />
grossly inadequate, inefficient, inequitable system. Now if<br />
I come to the conclusion that the sort of reform that we're<br />
talking about, and that it has broad support is the way to </p>
<p>go, but that there. would be certain interests who would try<br />
and use that approach to defeat the Government, then I would<br />
still go down that path. Because I am dedicated, and the<br />
evidence is there that I've been dedicated from day one of<br />
Government to make the tough decisions that are necessary to<br />
get the Australian economy into the best possible shape.<br />
That's what I believe my obligation is. And if ' in taking the<br />
decisions to achieve that result I run some political risk<br />
I said so be it. I repeat that.<br />
BEUTLER: Mr Hawke, if finally we could turn to the ordeal<br />
in Beirut. Do you agree with President Reagan's response<br />
of not negotiating with the terrorists.<br />
PM: I think the principle is right. I believe that<br />
if you have a situation where you allow terrorism and the<br />
tactic of terrorism to become legitimised in international<br />
relationships then you are proceeding down a very dangerous<br />
path. I have great sympathy, with not merely President<br />
Reagan, but with everyone involved under this threat, this<br />
atrocious threat to human life which is involved. And I<br />
merely say that my thoughts and wishes are with those who<br />
are responsible. And on behalf, I'm sure not merely of the<br />
Australian Government, but I believe the people of Australia,<br />
I would say to those involved in the Lebanon, and those<br />
with particular opportunities and responsibilities, to resolve<br />
this matter. That they should try and get a perspective which<br />
is beyond their immediate concerns, and understand that in the<br />
long-term the use of the tactic of terror, while it may be<br />
seen to be helpful to the pursuit of a particular cause at a<br />
particular time, is a tactic which can rebound. And can in<br />
the long-term mean only further bloodshed and violence and<br />
terror, indiscriminately for all. And that's not the path<br />
that's sensible in the interests of those in the Lebanon.<br />
BEUTLER: Mr Hawke thanks for your time today.<br />
PM: Thank you very much </p>
