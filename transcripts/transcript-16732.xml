    <content><![CDATA[<p> PM: Earlier today, a joint statement was issued by the Acting Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and the Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police in relation to the police counter-terrorism operation that has occurred in Victoria.   On the evening of the 2nd of August, I received a briefing from the National Security Adviser, the Acting Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, about the investigation into a number of individuals in Melbourne, who were allegedly planning a terrorist attack in Australia against an Australian military base and who were also allegedly involved in supporting Al-Shabaab in its fight against the Somali Government.  I am advised that coordinated police searches under 19 warrants were conducted in Victoria and that four people have been arrested as a result of the warrants.  Another person, already in custody in Victoria, will also be facing charges in relation to this matter.  I am advised that the charges laid relate to the preparation or planning of a terrorist act contrary to the Commonwealth Criminal Code 1995 as amended.  Theother charge relates to an offence under the Crimes Foreign Incursions and Recruitment Act, of 1978.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the arrests that took place today as the matter is an ongoing investigation, aspects of which may need to be resolved by the court.  I would hasten to add that under Australia's justice system all persons are presumed innocent until found guilty in a court of law.  This operation is the result of extensive collaboration over many months between the Australian Federal Police, the Victoria Police, the New South Wales Police, the New South Wales Crime Commission, ASIO and the Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecutions covering Federal, Victorian and New South Wales jurisdictions.  I commend these agencies for their combined and coordinated work to this point that led to the arrests this morning.   As the Australian Government has said consistently, there is an enduring threat from terrorism at home here in Australia as well as overseas.  Only too recently we have been reminded of the consequences of this threat in the tragic Jakarta bombings, in which three Australians lost their lives.  However, I would like to make clear that I am advised that the Jakarta bombings are not connected to today's operation.  Australians will be concerned to hear about arrests of this nature in our midst.  Our assessment of the terrorist threat in Australia is that it comes from a small number of individuals, who should in no way be taken as a wider reflection of any group within Australian society.  Nationally, Australia has well-developed plans and procedures to deal with terrorist threats. I am advised that events today do not at this time warrant any change to our National Counter Terrorism Level, which remains at âMediumâ, as it has been since the September 11 2001 attacks in the United States.   I want to reassure all Australians that our law enforcement agencies and our intelligence agencies are working hard to combat terrorism and other security threats to our community.  Australians should be confident about Australia's strong and coordinated efforts to combat terrorism. These efforts will continue, just as Australians should remain mindful of the fact that the threat of terrorism continues.  I'll take a few questions.  JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you able to say whether this, since 9/11, was the most advanced terror plot on Australian soil?  PM: I believe, David, it's important for the process involving the ongoing investigations by the police authorities to continue, for the court process to work its way through, before we reach any broader conclusions about where this may fit in terms of threats to this country over time.  As I said before, this is a sober reminder that the threat of terrorism to Australia continues.  I also have emphasized in my remarks, however, that in our system of criminal justice the presumption of innocence remains.  JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what do you say to Australians who now say this is strong evidence that we should not be in Afghanistan, that our fighting there is a warwhere we have no place and we inspire hatreds that could come back to haunt us?  PM: As I reflect most recently on terrorist attacks in Indonesia, and terrorist attacks elsewhere in world, as you know, in the history of events since 2001, many of those who have been responsible for terrorist attacks around the world have in fact been trained in Afghanistan. The Government of Australia's view and the Government of the United States, and our friends and allies is that Afghanistan cannot be surrendered as a training base of unlimited potential for terrorists as it was prior to 2001.  This is a difficult and ongoing fight in Afghanistan, I accept that. I accept also that it is unpopular. But if we are to deal with the threat of terrorism at its various levels, we must dealing with where terrorists are trained, we must be dealing with those who support them, as we must be dealing with the current, practical challenges which confront our law enforcement agencies here in Australia.  And I emphasize again what I said before  -  that is, the agencies have cooperated well on this matter, and I commend the professionalism which they have displayed.  JOURNALIST: (inaudible) Do you think it's acceptable that private security firms are guarding some of our military bases (inaudible)  PM: The security as it relates to each of our military installations is based on the best advice of the Defence authorities, and these are matters of ongoing review, calibrated to the nature of any threat against them. And I noted carefully the comments made by the representatives of the AFP and the Victorian Police this morning about their liaison with Defence on this matter over time. Of course, that liaison will continue.  The challenge for our security authorities and for government is to be responsive to the advice that we are provided about what is needed and where and in what form at any particular time.  The sobering element to emerge from today's development is the reminder to all Australians that the threat of terrorism is alive and well and this requires continued vigilance on the part of our security authorities, and we propose to maintain that vigilance into the future.  JOURNALIST: Is there a need to or has there been a review of security (inaudible)  PM: On the question of security as it relates to any public event in Australia, or any international event, that is subject to the normal security processes of the Commonwealth in partnership with the states. That has applied to this event as well.   As I said partly in response to the question just asked, these security arrangements are the subject of continuing review, and therefore that would be the case in relation to this and any other events in Australia as well.  JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what's your reaction to the Auditor-General's report and the comments made by Godwin Grech in The Australian?  PM: I would not propose to add to the comments that I made yesterday. I have nothing at this stage, further to add. You will appreciate that the Government and its national security ministers have been preoccupied with other matters in recent times. That includes me. Thank you very much.  (ends)</p>
