FOR PRESS 31 OCTOBER 1978<br />
FIRST BRAILLE COMPUTER BOOK<br />
I am very grateful to have been given this opportunity to<br />
receive the first Braille book produced in Australia<br />
by means of a computer.<br />
The Royal New South Wales Institute for Deaf and Blind<br />
Children, which has for over a century so lovingly and<br />
effectively served the deaf and blind children of<br />
New South Wales and the has achieved another first.<br />
Recently, there has been considerable debate and controversy<br />
over technological change and its effects in the community.<br />
But computers are at the forefront of current improvements<br />
of technology and the development of the Institute's computer<br />
system is a good example of the benefits that can flow from it.<br />
The computer system you have installed has revolutionised the<br />
capacity, speed and accuracy of the production of Braille.<br />
It is a great breakthrough for the blind in this country.<br />
For many years now there has been an acute shortage of reading<br />
matter for the blind. The computer system will increase the<br />
amount of available reading matter.<br />
Previously, only one text out of several set for the Si hool<br />
Certificate could be translated into Braille for study<br />
by blind children. Now the computer will be able to translate<br />
all the set English texts into Braille and I commend the<br />
Institute's intention to sell its Braille reading material at<br />
no profit to agencies and to Government bodies such as the<br />
New South Wales Department of Education.<br />
The computer will help blind people overcome some of<br />
the limitations imposed on them by their handicap, facilitating<br />
their ability to acquire an education necessary for employment<br />
and to participate fully in the life of the community.<br />
While its main use at present will be to provide Braille<br />
reading matter, I understand that there is a possibility of<br />
using the system to teach mathematics, science and music very<br />
effectively to the blind. </p>
<p>2-<br />
I am sure that the production of Braille books by computer<br />
will be the first step in a series of important and<br />
exciting developments in the application of computer<br />
technology to assist the blind.<br />
Voice communication with the computer would similarly open<br />
up a number of possibilities for handicapped children<br />
and adults.<br />
I understand that the computer services staff includes a<br />
blind proof reader and that the computer will be used to<br />
assist in the training of other blind persons as<br />
programmers. This is an important step in training the<br />
blind for entry into the workforce.<br />
The Institute's achievements in assisting the blind, of<br />
which the installation of a computer is an outstanding<br />
example, are made possible through the support of many<br />
sections of the community including governments, sporting<br />
bodies and the general public. Many hours of effort and<br />
dedication have gone into this worthwhile project.<br />
I would like to again extend my congratulations to the many<br />
people involved, and wish the Institute every future success<br />
in its use of computer technology to assist the advancement<br />
of its work. I should also say that a major responsibility<br />
rests on all of the community not just to support innovations<br />
such as this computer but also to make greater efforts to<br />
understand the blind and the difficulties they face.<br />
This requires some changes in community attitudes. We have<br />
to rid ourselves of the misconception that the blind are<br />
helpless or that they can perform only a limited set of<br />
tasks. This misconception unduly limits the opportunities<br />
the blind have to gain maximum independence and it all<br />
too often unfairly debars them from gaining employmentthey<br />
want and can perform.<br />
Our object must be to give blind people the independence they<br />
want and can achieve. We have to recognise that although<br />
the blind are handicapped with respect to sight their<br />
interests are the same as other people's, and that they want<br />
the maximum control over their own lives. It is through<br />
a general community acceptance of these facts, that the<br />
advances promised by this computer can be fully realised.<br />
