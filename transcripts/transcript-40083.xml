    <content><![CDATA[<p>Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Nigel Scullion, has welcomed the election of Councillor Roy Ah‑See as Chair and Councillor Anne Dennis as Deputy Chair of the NSW Aboriginal Land Council.</p>
<p>“The NSW Aboriginal Land Council plays an important role assisting Aboriginal people to protect their interests and further their aspirations,” Minister Scullion said.</p>
<p>“Councillors Ah-See and Dennis have been involved in Aboriginal affairs throughout their lives and are committed to maintaining a strong land rights system in New South Wales.</p>
<p>“They bring a deep understanding of the issues faced by Indigenous communities and a determination to empower Aboriginal people throughout New South Wales.</p>
<p>“I am confident the council will continue to fulfil its role under their stewardship and I look forward to working with them to advance the interests of our First Australians.”</p>
<p>Councillor Ah-See, a Wiradjuri man, was first elected to the council in 2007 and served as its Deputy Chair from 2013. Councillor Dennis, a Gamilaraay woman, has been a Councillor since 2011 and has a strong background in education spanning three decades.</p>
<p>The Minister thanked the outgoing Chair of the Aboriginal Land Council, Councillor Craig Cromelin.</p>
<p>“I pay tribute to Councillor Cromelin for the strong leadership he has provided over the past two years and I wish him well as he continues to represent the Wiradjuri region on the council,” Minister Scullion said.</p>
<p>Established in 1977, the NSW Aboriginal Land Council is the largest member-based Aboriginal organisation in NSW and represents some 120 local land councils across the state. Its nine councillors were elected by registered voting members of local land councils late last month.</p>
