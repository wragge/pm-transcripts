FLOOD VICTIMS<br />
The Prime Minister and Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
Mr Whitlam, said today that he had been delighted by India's<br />
friendly gesture in making available 20,000 lbs. of tea to<br />
Australia for distribution to families affected by the recent<br />
flooding in Queensland.<br />
The offer of the gift of tea was made by India' s<br />
Prime Minister, Mrs Gandhi, and conveyed through her Foreign<br />
Secretary, Mr Kewal Singh, who is in Canberra to lead the<br />
Indian delegation to the round of talks with Australian<br />
foreign affairs officials in Canberra.<br />
The Prime Minister said: " India is a country which<br />
has suffered greatly from natural catastrophes of this kind.<br />
Australia has responded to India's misfortunes in the past.<br />
It is most pleasing to have our misfortune noted in this manner<br />
by the Indian Government and we are deeply appreciative of this<br />
gift.,' </p>
