Can I acknowledge today:</p>
<p>David Whitely, Chief Executive, Industry Super Network.</p>
<p>Ged Kearney, President of the ACTU.</p>
<p>Jeff Lawrence, Secretary of the ACTU.</p>
<p>The Honourable John Cain, Former Premier of Victoria.</p>
<p>I see Garry Weaven. </p>
<p>Garry doesn't need an introduction from me to a room like this  -  a giant in this industry  -  still working for the good guys too.</p>
<p>And I see so many other comrades and colleagues, allies and friends.</p>
<p>Friends, there are some rooms where you feel like a visitor, some like a friend, some where you feel like you're at home.</p>
<p>For any Labor Prime Minister, a room full of industry super funds people is a good room to be in.</p>
<p>Because universal superannuation is a great Labor achievement.</p>
<p>Universal super is a great Labor reform.</p>
<p>Some people in Australia had always had superannuation, it took Labor in Government to make it universal.</p>
<p>That is how we govern.</p>
<p>Informed by our values  -  and walking the reform road.</p>
<p>Determined to spread opportunity to all and determined to leave no one behind and determined to bring those values to concrete reality through visionary economic reform.</p>
<p>Every Australian is better off because of the decision to introduce universal superannuation.</p>
<p>It's built greater security for every Australian worker.</p>
<p>Lifting income in retirement.</p>
<p>And it's built a savings pool for the whole Australian economy.</p>
<p>So the world's seventeenth biggest economy  -  has the fourth biggest pool of managed funds on the globe.</p>
<p>The founders of universal superannuation saw the opportunities on the reform road  -  and measured them with hard headed analysis of the economic environment of their day.</p>
<p>We do the same now.  And hard headed analysis is required.</p>
<p>Despite Australia's strong economy, we've all been given pause for thought  -  frankly, cause for concern  -  by recent developments in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>There's concern at the kitchen table.</p>
<p>Australians are acutely aware of the escalation in volatility in global financial markets in recent months  -  and of the direct implications for each of them through their superannuation and through the investments in many portfolios.</p>
<p>I know many Australians are watching these developments anxiously. Some retired, some about to retire. To them I say:</p>
<p>In this period of uncertainty, the Government I lead will manage the economy in the interests of every Australian.</p>
<p>We will leave no one behind.</p>
<p>There's concern at the global economy's top table too.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund has warned that âthe global economy has entered a dangerous new phaseâ and that downside risks are growing.</p>
<p>The Treasurer is in the United States this week, as you know.</p>
<p>There, he's told global policymakers that while some important steps have been taken, there remains much more to do.</p>
<p>That we cannot ignore the risk that a financial market dislocation in Europe could be transmitted through the global real economy via a big hit to confidence and a reduction in world demand and output.</p>
<p>That while the developing world continues to grow strongly, a loss of confidence could further impact on the already soft recoveries struggling to keep momentum in advanced economies.</p>
<p>That swift and credible action is required to restore confidence among global markets that governments particularly in Europe do have the capacity to resolve this situation.</p>
<p>And as the Treasurer and I have spoken in recent days, we have reflected that in a period where so many are uncertain, these messages must be sent very clearly.</p>
<p>In the world  -  and at home.</p>
<p>So the message to the world is clear:</p>
<p>There is a problem in Europe.</p>
<p>Solutions must now emerge to restore the confidence that markets need. </p>
<p>Governments must now act.</p>
<p>The message at home is clear as well:</p>
<p>Australia is playing a global role in encouraging a solution.</p>
<p>We are not immune, but we are strong  -  no country is better placed in this challenging economic period.</p>
<p>And we are strong for simple reasons.</p>
<p>First, we have a strong economy, with strong fundamentals.</p>
<p>And second, we have a plan for the future: a plan for growth, a plan for jobs.</p>
<p>The economic story is unfolding day by day  -  with implications for the economy as a whole and for a sector such as yours.</p>
<p>So some background to the current market situation is warranted  -  though many of you here are more than familiar with the course of recent events.</p>
<p>The recent volatility and uncertainty has hurt confidence and increased speculation that downside risks to world growth are beginning to crystallize. </p>
<p>Two key issues are fuelling the current uncertainty.</p>
<p>First, concerns about the very high levels of government debt in the Euro area and the US.</p>
<p>Second, fears that steps to reduce this debt will retard the patchy recovery of the global economy.</p>
<p>And this combination of circumstances is fuelling significant volatility in European financial markets.</p>
<p>Markets which have been concerned about the private sector's ability to repay debt  -  and which are now worried about whether overseas Governments can meet their debt obligations.</p>
<p>And the EU's measures to increase the flexibility of the European Financial Stability Facility, announced two months ago, remain un-ratified by 12 of Europe's 17 parliaments.</p>
<p>So in the Euro area, markets are now closely examining the potential for a default by one of the highly indebted EU economies  -  and they are weighing up the implications of such an event.</p>
<p>Despite the range of institutional reforms and fiscal adjustments that have been announced across the Euro area, sentiment has deteriorated.</p>
<p>While across the Atlantic markets are genuinely concerned about the strength of the United States' domestic recovery and the likelihood that successful interventions will kickstart jobs and income growth.</p>
<p>In this way, events in the northern hemisphere are conspiring to create a most uncertain outlook.</p>
<p>Australia is playing a global role in encouraging a solution.</p>
<p>Restoring sustainability to European public finances will take years  -  so while that long term repair begins, we need to see solutions emerging to restore the confidence that the markets need.</p>
<p>We are encouraged by the resolve among countries to arrive at a pragmatic solution.</p>
<p>There are signs they are putting the blame-game to one side and working to return confidence and stability to the global financial system.</p>
<p>And European leaders are discussing the need for further changes to institutional frameworks to better align fiscal and monetary policies, including stricter fiscal rules.</p>
<p>But the time for Governments to act is now.</p>
<p>We will continue to take a cooperative and practical approach with our international partners and friends.</p>
<p>Pressing hard for a coordinated global response. </p>
<p>This week in the US, the Treasurer has been doing just that. </p>
<p>At home, Australians understand we are not immune from these global developments.</p>
<p>The globally connected nature of financial markets means that volatility in international markets will be felt in Australia, including through returns to superannuation accounts.</p>
<p>But Australians should take some reassurance when these effects  -  and their impact on Australia  -  are seen in their proper perspective.</p>
<p>First, our fundamentals are strong.</p>
<p>Just last week, global ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's reaffirmed our top-tier AAA-credit rating on the basis of our fiscal strength, strong balance sheet and public policy stability.</p>
<p>We have very low debt  -  our net debt will peak at less than one-tenth of the major advanced economies.</p>
<p>We also have low unemployment because we acted decisively during the crisis  -  in fact the economy has created more than seven hundred thousand jobs since the Government came to office.</p>
<p>We've got some $430 billion of planned investment in our resources sector alone  -  which is stunning relative to our $1.4 trillion economy.</p>
<p>Second, the latest data from our regulatory authorities indicates our banks have negligible direct exposures to peripheral European sovereign debt.</p>
<p>And our advice is there is no Australian bank exposure to Greek public debt.</p>
<p>They also have low exposures to European banks and other borrowers that might be affected immediately by a major financial shock in Europe  -  below 2 per cent of total assets.</p>
<p>Our regulatory environment is the envy of the world.</p>
<p>Our banks survived the global financial crisis  -  they are now better-placed than they were before it.</p>
<p>Stronger capital buffers.</p>
<p>Stronger funding positions than 2007.</p>
<p>Increased holdings of liquid assets  -  up almost half since 2007.</p>
<p>Plus solid profits and relatively low levels of non-performing loans.</p>
<p>We've got a strong and stable banking system which came through the crisis in very good health after many years of tough supervision.</p>
<p>So as they consider the current financial environment Australians can be confident that our banks are well placed.</p>
<p>And third, as they examine their own superannuation, Australians should remember that it is a long-term investment.</p>
<p>Yes, super funds invest widely  -  including in global and local share markets, which have historically generated the greatest long-term returns to investors.</p>
<p>But the majority of super funds also diversify their investments over different asset classes to help minimise the impact of a volatile share market on their members' investments.</p>
<p>Share markets move in cycles and recover from downturns over time, as they did following the GFC.</p>
<p>I know this is no immediate comfort to Australians who've retired recently, or who are about to retire.</p>
<p>They need their savings now  -  and for them, a fall in returns is a cut in take home pay.</p>
<p>This is one reason the government is introducing MySuper.</p>
<p>Not only to ensure workers won't be paying unnecessary fees or charges that erode their retirement nest eggs.</p>
<p>MySuper providers will also be given the option of offering so called âlifecycle strategiesâ that automatically reduce the level of investment risk when the member reaches a certain age.</p>
<p>So, for example as theyreachretirement their cash allocation automatically increases.</p>
<p>A smart solution for the kind of complex economic situation which is playing out now.</p>
<p>Looking at the global economic situation, Australians can be reassured.</p>
<p>This country, this government, my economic team, have seen uncertain times and even global crisis before and we have demonstrated our resilience as well.</p>
<p>Australia is not immune from the world, but we are strong in the world.</p>
<p>I would not swap our economic position with that of any country.</p>
<p>We have a flexible economy.</p>
<p>We have a strong mix of trading partners.</p>
<p>We have rich resources and their prices are at all-time highs.</p>
<p>We have talented, hard-working, innovative people.</p>
<p>And we have a plan for the future: a plan for growth, a plan for jobs.</p>
<p>Friends, we have a plan for the future of super as well.</p>
<p>Because the future of super is the future of every Australian.</p>
<p>When the aged pension was introduced, the average lifespan was less than the pension age.</p>
<p>Today, living to eighty is the norm  -  a great thing.</p>
<p>And one British scientist, Dr Aubrey De Grey, has ventured to say that the person who will live to 150 has already been born.</p>
<p>Perhaps true, perhaps not.</p>
<p>But we are certainly living longer.</p>
<p>And while our working lives are becoming shorter than our non-working lives  -  the choices we hope for and the security we seek in retirement are only growing.</p>
<p>Financial experts generally believe the average worker will need between 60 and 70 per cent of pre-retirement income to live comfortably.</p>
<p>Nine per cent super is simply not enough to get there, especially for women, who have breaks in their career.</p>
<p>This is why the Government I lead will lift compulsory superannuation contributions from 9 to 12 per cent.</p>
<p>Delivered in a manageable way  -  rolled out over the next eight years  -  but wewill get this thing done.</p>
<p>But just increasing super from 9 to 12 isn't enough.</p>
<p>It's not enough for super to be adequate  -  it must be secure.</p>
<p>As a lawyer I acted for female clothingworkers to get their super paid, and it was a privilege to work with those women.</p>
<p>But employees shouldn't need to turn to lawyers or unions to secure basic entitlements like superannuation  -  it should be a normal part of every workplace.</p>
<p>That's why I'm proud of our Securing Super reforms.</p>
<p>Minister Shorten announced the Securing Super reforms last week, so every employee can see with his or her own eyes that super is being paid, in full and on time.</p>
<p>Employees will receive information on their payslips.</p>
<p>So they know when their superannuation will actually be paid into their accounts  -  and so they can monitor their contributions as well.</p>
<p>We're also ensuring that superannuation concessions flow to those who need them most.</p>
<p>It's of particular concern to me that whilst women live longer than men, their super balances are around 35 percent lower.</p>
<p>It is tragic and unnecessary that the financial independence women treasure so much in their working lives should be lost in their retirements.</p>
<p>Currently, around 2 million women get no tax benefit from super because the 15 per cent contribution tax is higher than their income tax rate.</p>
<p>That's why we are acting on the Henry Review recommendation that superannuation tax concessions be distributed more equitably. That starts from 1 July next year.</p>
<p>60 percent of the beneficiaries of this policy will be women.</p>
<p>It delivers $830 million in additional wealth every year to low income Australians  -  the very people who would otherwise struggle to set this money aside.</p>
<p>It's a Labor policy.</p>
<p>A policy I'm proud of  -  a policy with a very simple core:</p>
<p>To make sure no one is left behind.</p>
<p>I do see many friends in the room today, I see many leaders too.</p>
<p>Because when universal super was introduced, Labor introduced another innovation alongside it:</p>
<p>Industry super funds.</p>
<p>This wasn't just a vision of what could be done differently in this country  -  it was a vision of how it could be done differently as well.</p>
<p>Of how the savings of working Australians would not have to be handed to the big banks and old financial houses at the cost of high fees.</p>
<p>A vision of how those savings could be managed by the representatives of working Australians themselves.</p>
<p>A vision that we could spread opportunity to all, that we could leave no one behind and a vision that we could do it our way. </p>
<p>By sharing, by sticking together.</p>
<p>Today the industry super funds are multi-billion dollar entities.</p>
<p>With the confidence of our community through their good management, strong returns and low fees.</p>
<p>And in a global economic environment where many feel uncertain  -  in a period where many Australians are anxious about their retirement savings and their retirement income  -  industry super funds have a vital role to play.</p>
<p>Adequate retirement income for every working Australian.</p>
<p>Secure retirement savings for every working Australian.</p>
<p>Australians looking to retirement are looking to you.</p>
<p>A great responsibility  -  but a cause for great pride.</p>
<p>You should feel proud that under David Whiteley's leadership, you stood with us from the earliest days in our determination to secure a better retirement for all Australians.</p>
<p>You stood with us to get rid of the conflicts of interest and the excessive fees.</p>
<p>You stood with us to secure the iconic âopt-inâ policy to bring fairness to financial advice.</p>
<p>You stood with us to bring simple, low fee super accounts to every worker who needs one.</p>
<p>You stood with us to distribute super tax concessions more fairly so that all Australians benefit.</p>
<p>You play a role in broader policy debates, on occasion at the vanguard of public policy debates.</p>
<p>Through ISN, you're working with us now on issues from the upcoming tax forum, to banking competition policy and nation building infrastructure.</p>
<p>So yes, universal super is a reform of which Labor Governments are rightly proud.</p>
<p>But universal super is a reform built by leaders in many places and at many levels.</p>
<p>Leaders in unions, leaders in industry, leaders in workplaces, leaders in financial institutions, leaders in ideas.</p>
<p>Many of you here today.</p>
<p>Still leading, still building the future for Australia, still doing it together.</p>
<p>Still spreading opportunity to all, still working to make sure no one is left behind.</p>
<p>Still working for the good guys.</p>
<p>Still walking the reform road. </p>
