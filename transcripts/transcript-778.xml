DMATE OF H1 J. dWtD<br />
The death of r. Jard removes from iarliament<br />
a man who had von the honour of Cabinet offioe Ie<br />
two Labour Prime KInisters. Io and I were at the<br />
opposite pass politically, but I would like to pq<br />
a tribute to his inoessant inMustry and his stznmi<br />
devotion to the beliefs which he held. The eletors<br />
of Bet Sydney returned his almost oontiaously for<br />
more than thirty years as a strong advooate of their<br />
interests and their political fbith* He wa<br />
= ndoubtedly one of the lively personalities in the<br />
Parliament. I extend my sinoere sympathy to his<br />
widow and family*<br />
