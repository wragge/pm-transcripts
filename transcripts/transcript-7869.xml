PRIME MINISTER<br />
PA1tTIAL TAzS1ITOr NEWS CONFERENCE, CLEAN UP AUSTRALIA<br />
HEADQUARTERS, SYDNEY 21 JANUARY 1990<br />
R OE PROOF ONL~ Y<br />
JOURNALISTi Can you give us an update of the situation in<br />
Bougainvi lle?<br />
PM No, I'll be getting a report, a detailed report in the<br />
morning from my Ministers. But the position of Australia<br />
in regard to Papua New Guinea and Bougo'nville should be<br />
clearly understood. As I've said, there will be no Australian<br />
troops going into Papua New Guinea to take sides in this issue.<br />
Papua New Guinea, despite the misapprehension of some people and<br />
the implications of somue commtntators is a totally sovereign au~ d<br />
independent nation and it must resolve its owh internal disputes.<br />
Having said that.-some mont1% s ago I personally took the<br />
initiative to ensure that should be any deterIoration of the<br />
situation In Bougainville which put at significant risk Australian<br />
lives, of Australian residents there, that we should have the<br />
understanding and agreement from the Governmefit of Papua Now<br />
Guinea that we would be able to move in there to vrotect those<br />
lives. That's thp -nriti. nfl. We will do, whate~ ver is necessary<br />
to protect Australian lives if that becomes the situation that<br />
requires our actioh. But we will not be involved. in the internal<br />
dispute.<br />
JOURNALIST: Auatralian lives are already at risk though aren't<br />
they?<br />
PM Of course they are at risk. But what we're talking about<br />
is the situation reaching a stage where there is general risk<br />
to Australian liveS Or a situation for instance where hostages<br />
could be taken, Now we were not going to allow a situation a*<br />
far as 1, was concerned that if that positi~ n arose we would<br />
then got into a neh* otiatinx nQsitiQn with the Government of<br />
T'aouq New Guinea and waste days and day. if that situation were<br />
to arise. We've cot the understanding in Tvlace. I trust that<br />
it doesn't reach that pco3. tion but it's fairly grave.<br />
JOURNALIST; What about the osibilitv of more eav~ r~ inent. like<br />
PM: Well as I've said in response to questions like that in the<br />
l'ast couple of dAyB, I'll wait and get the detailed report from my<br />
Ministers at the beginning of this week. M 1 9 V 1 9 4z: 1 I </p>
