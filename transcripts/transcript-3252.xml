PRIME MINISTER 11 May 1974<br />
COUNTRY PARTY DOMINATES THE OPPOSITION<br />
TVie most sinister factor in this campaign is the power<br />
and influence of the Country Party over its Liberal partners.<br />
Liberal voters should remember that a vote for the coalition<br />
is a vote for the domination of the Country Party the most<br />
selfish, sectional and reactionary of the major parties in<br />
Australia. If we look at the record of the coalition we see<br />
repeated evidence of the Country Party's power to browbeat and<br />
manipulate the Liberals.<br />
In the great row over the value of the dollar in<br />
December 1971, the Country Party threatened to smash the<br />
coalition if the value of the dollar was raised. The Liberals<br />
caved in, the dollar was kept under-valued and the seeds of<br />
inflation were sown.<br />
The Country Party has now abandoned any pretence to<br />
be a farmers' party. It has become the party of the foreign<br />
mining corporations and manufacturing interests.<br />
Under Country Party pressure, Mr Snedden has promised<br />
O alalrveiasdh y tawxo rkcionngc esast iofnusl l anpdr odiunccteinotniv easn d foern jionydiunsgt rrieecso rdt haptr ofairtes.<br />
Under Country Party pressure, Mr Snedden has promised<br />
to remove all restraints on the inflow of foreign money and<br />
give foreign interests an open go to buy up Australian resources.<br />
Under Country Party pressure, Mr Snedden and Mr Fairbairn<br />
have committed themselves to push up the price of petrol for<br />
Australian motorists a price now held in check by the decision<br />
of the Prices Justification Tribunal. No wonder the Opposition<br />
parties are scrambling to back away from that commitment.<br />
Mr Anthony makes no secret of his ambition to be<br />
Treasurer and Mr Snedden refuses to say who his Treasurer would<br />
be. Judging by his record, it is highly doubtful if Mr Snedden<br />
would have the guts to resist this latest Country Party demand. 2/ </p>

Let there be no mistake with the Country Party in<br />
charge of the Treasury, Australia would quickly rever to the<br />
conditions that produced our inflation in 1972 and 1973<br />
an under-valued dollar, a flood of foreign money buying up<br />
our natural resources, a host of costly tax lurks and concessions<br />
to sectional interests. The government's policies have reversed<br />
these conditions, we are beating inflation despite the fact<br />
that every one of our anti-inflationary measures was resisted<br />
by the Opposition. The greatest instrument for helping Australia's primary<br />
industries not the Pitt Street and Collins Street farmer,<br />
but the primary industries that really need help is the new<br />
Industries Assistance Commission. The Country Party opposed<br />
that Commission. They fought it every inch of the way in<br />
Parliament. Whatever name the Country Party uses National Alliance,<br />
National Country Party, National Party its policies are the<br />
same. Those policies mean lavish hand-outs to sectional interests<br />
at the taxpayers' expense.<br />
The Country Party in Queensland maintains the most<br />
flagrant electoral gerrymander to be found anywhere in Australia.<br />
The Queensland Government is dominated by a party that won<br />
of the vote. Do we want that situation in the national parliament<br />
as ell? Do we want a national government dominated by a<br />
sectional minority party linked to the most discredited of all<br />
parties the D. L. P.?<br />
Mr Anthony must be having serious second thoughts about<br />
his half-baked merger with the D. L. P.<br />
The Country Party leader in New South Wales, Sir Charles<br />
Cutler, would not have a bar of the D. L. P. Sir John McEwen<br />
wouldn't have a bar of the D. L. P. Australians won't have a bar<br />
of the D. L. P.<br />
They won't have a bar of a coalition deeply involved<br />
and officially linked with D. L. P. extremism.<br />
A government led by Mr Snedden would by under the thumb<br />
of a Country Party-D. L. P. alliance a combination of the worst<br />
right-wing elements in Australia. It would be a disaster for<br />
the nation. </p>
