    <content><![CDATA[<p>Brisbane-based firm Richard Kirk Architects Pty Ltd was today announced as the winner of the design competition for two new national memorials to honour the more than 1.4 million Australian service men and women who served in the First and Second World Wars.</p>
<p>The winning design was selected from 43 entries during a national and international competition conducted in 2008.</p>
<p>The memorials will be built on the northern shore of Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra, at the foot of Anzac Parade, to frame the view of the Australian War Memorial.</p>
<p>The winning designs are symbolic of the spirit, sacrifice and commitment of Australians during both World Wars.</p>
<p>The memorials will honour more than 100,000 Australians who died in the World Wars and will be a permanent legacy to those who served or supported the war effort, both at home and overseas.</p>
<p>The Memorial(s) Development Committee is to be congratulated on its initiative, vision and commitment to this project.</p>
<p>Now the winning design is selected, the Committee will focus on raising enough money to see this important project through to completion.</p>
<p>The Memorials will cost an estimated $21 million. The Australian Government has committed $250,000 to the project.</p>
<p>The Government strongly encourages all Australians to offer their support to the construction of this new national monument.</p>
