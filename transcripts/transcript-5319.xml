FOR MEDIA MONDAY 7 APRIL 1980<br />
INQUIRY INTO ELECTRICITY AND THE SHARING<br />
OF POWER RESOURCES IN S. E. AUSTRALIA<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that Sir David Zeidler, who<br />
has recently retired as Chairman and Managing Director of ICI<br />
Australia Ltd. had accepted an appointment as Chairman of the<br />
Committee of Inquiry into Electricity Generation and the<br />
Sharing of Power Resources in South-East Australia.<br />
The Committee of Inquiry will also comprise representatives of<br />
the Commonwealth and each of the participating States of New<br />
South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria.<br />
TheI uiys main function is to examine the feasibility of<br />
a strongly integrated electricity supply grid in South-East<br />
Australia and the requirement location and type of new power<br />
stations to supply such an interconnected system. The terms of<br />
reference of the Incuiry are attached.<br />
The Inquiry, which is to be based in Melbourne, is expectedI tc<br />
take at Least one year to complete its final report to the<br />
particinz ting Governments.<br />
The PrL7e Minister cOnsidered it timely that in view of-the<br />
uncertain world energy situation and the increasing overseas<br />
interest in establishing energy intensive mineral processing<br />
industries in Australia utilising our competitiveiy priced coal-(<br />
based electricity, the Commonwealth should co2operate with the<br />
four States in an examination of electricity supply from a<br />
national view point. It is a concrete example of the Government's<br />
concern to ensure that Australia's domestic economy and future<br />
commercial opportunities would not be limited through any lack<br />
of adequate electricity supply facilities.<br />
The Prime Minister expressed particular satisfaction that Sir<br />
David had been prepared to accept the appointment as Chairman.<br />
Sir David is a prominent and respected figure in Australian<br />
Industry, and has had a long and distinguished career. He is<br />
particularly well-qualified to undertake this difficult but most<br />
important task at this critical period when the supply of energy<br />
in its many forms has become a crucial global as well as a<br />
national issue. 000---Z-18kopy r-lLtF </p>
<p>INQUIRY INTO ELECTRICITY GENERATION AND THE<br />
SHARING OF POWER RESOURCES IN SOUTH-EAST AUSTRALIA<br />
TERMS OF REFERENCE<br />
Whereas the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and the<br />
Commonwealth developed, in co-operation, arrangements for the<br />
Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electricity Scheme, the Commonwealth<br />
Government and the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria,<br />
South Australia And Tasmania have agreed that a Committee of<br />
Inquiry should be appointed:<br />
to inquire into the feasibility of establishing<br />
a strongly integrated South-East Australia<br />
Electricity power grid through further<br />
co-operative governmental arrangements;<br />
to examine the provision of increased capacity<br />
for the exchange of power across State borders<br />
to ensure continuity of power supplies aiid<br />
optimum. use of fuel resources; and<br />
to examine the need for possible location and<br />
type of new power stations to support the<br />
establishment of the proposed grid.<br />
In carrying out its functions the Committee should<br />
have rec: ard to:<br />
al! alternative sources of primary energy for<br />
electricity generation; and<br />
the technical feasibility, the economics and the<br />
social and environmental impacts of the possible<br />
alternatives. </p>
