PRIME MINISTER 2 May 1974<br />
NAT4W~ tWAGE ' CASE<br />
The P~ rime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, said today the Governmient<br />
would co-oper-ate fully in the conference to be called by the<br />
President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, Mr.<br />
Justice Moore-, to discuss wage fixation measures and automatic<br />
cost of living ad~ usttnents. He welcomed the call by Mr. Justice<br />
Moore in yes'terdayls National Wage Case judgement for a conference<br />
of parties to the case to discuss new wage fixation measures and<br />
wage indexation. Ma-y parties before the National Wage hearing including<br />
the Australian Government had expressed dissatisfaction with the<br />
present wage erivirorartent. A conference as procposed by Mr. Justice<br />
M~ oore could be vAluable in settling this dissatisfaction.<br />
The overall decisions on the total wage and uminimum wage.<br />
for men and women and the first step towards cost of living<br />
adjustments vindicated the positive intervention by the Australian<br />
Government in sharp contrast to the negativism of previous Liberal/<br />
Country P~ arty administrations.<br />
Mr. Whitlam in particular welcomed the increases awarded<br />
to all people men and women on the minimum wage. He regretted<br />
however that subm~ issions seeking the automatic adjustment of wages<br />
in line with the cost of living had not been accepted at the present<br />
time. A positive decision now about indexation would almost<br />
certainly have led to a moderation in futxire trade union demands<br />
for wage increases. JIe said he hoped that the introduction of such<br />
a system would follow the conference.<br />
The decision on the minimum wage was completely in line<br />
with the social priorities of the Labor Government. it recogn~ ised<br />
that there were many cases of genuine need and distress among<br />
many wage earners in the community. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The decision to bring the mlinimumn wage for women up<br />
to the level determined for men was an historic one. It was<br />
an importan~ t step towards the implementation of the principle<br />
of equal pay for work of equal value, which the Labor Government<br />
has consistently supported. The Government had strongly supported<br />
the A. C. T. U. claim for an equal mtinim'umn wage for women.<br />
The Prime Minister welcomed the vote of confidence in<br />
the strength of the econom~ y which this part of the Commission's<br />
decision indicates.<br />
In their discussions on recent economic trends, the<br />
Commission notes the strong position of the Australian economy<br />
and draws particular attention to the strength of both consumer<br />
demand and private capital expenditure.<br />
While noting the arguments put by all parties, including<br />
the Australian Government# regarding the importance at t-he moment<br />
of inflation, the Commission indicated that none of the parties<br />
to the case had questioned the appropriateness of the government's<br />
counter-inflationary policies. </p>
