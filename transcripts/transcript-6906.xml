TRANSCRIPT OF BRIEFING BY PRIME MINISTER AT IMPERIAL HOTEL -TOKYO<br />
MAY 1986<br />
PM: Let me start with an exposition of what has happened and<br />
then answer your questions. I had a long, warm and businesslike<br />
discussion with Prime Minister Nakasone. As you would expect a<br />
major topic of our discussions was the Tokyo Summit. I told the<br />
Prime Minister that I appreciated the evident willingness on<br />
behalf of Japan to pursue the point that agriculture should have<br />
a prominent place in the new MTN round. It was expected that<br />
there should be decisive progress made at the September<br />
ministerial meeting to launch the new round and that in the<br />
meantime the work to be done in the OECD context will serve as<br />
preparation for the later global negotiating process. Now in<br />
all of those points we were at one. There is no doubt that the<br />
Japanese have with us I believe a vested interest in seeing an<br />
early as possible start to the new round.<br />
I also took the opportunity of expressing our satisfaction at<br />
Japan's co-operation with the regional trade initiative which I<br />
mentioned at the end of 1983 which will believe be followed now<br />
with a meeting we think in Manila before the September meeting.<br />
That will either be at the level of ministers or officials. I<br />
also noted the re-assurance of Mr Nakasone that the participants<br />
at the Summit were prepared to take into account the interest<br />
of the non-Summit agricultural producers and I thanked him for<br />
taking our concerns and putting them before Summit participants.<br />
Another major issue we discussed of course was the restructuring<br />
of the Japanese and the Australian economies. In the case of<br />
Japan the backdrop is provided by the Maekawa Report, the<br />
marketing measures which they have commenced and the re-alignment<br />
of currencies involving very substantial'appreciation of the<br />
Yen. I welcome the opportunity which these factors presented.<br />
tQ Australia. I express regret that so little * had-been achieved<br />
in respect of agricultural products so far in opening up the<br />
Japanese market and I noted that the Maekawa Report without<br />
doubt the most positive step in recent times. I asked the<br />
Prime Minister what was the status of the report, what could we<br />
expect in terms of action and he told that the Japanese<br />
leadership is pledged to promote the implementation of the<br />
report and that this process has only just begun but there is<br />
a commitment to it. I suggested in this context that it was a<br />
propitious time for an agreement between us as Prime Ministers<br />
an exchange of investment missions from Japan to Australia and<br />
Australia to Japan. I made that proposal to the Prime Minister<br />
and he agreed to it. We have agreed therefore in principle and </p>
<p>the details and timing of that exchange of investment missions<br />
is to be worked out in consultation with the appropriate<br />
government and private sector people. We both noted with pleasure<br />
that the trading relationship is already broadening with<br />
Japanese co-operation with the Australia/ Japan market strategy,<br />
the very significant increase in tourism with now over 100,000<br />
tourists per annum and hopefully building up to something<br />
like a quarter of a million by the Bicentenary year. And with<br />
the developments in finance and banking flowing from the<br />
regulation of our system and the influx of foreign banks<br />
including three Japanese banks. But having noted that expansion<br />
of the relationship which has taking place I emphasised to the<br />
Prime Minister that our Japanese market of traditional exports<br />
remain vital and in that context I stressed Australian<br />
reliability and international competitiveness in minerals and<br />
in agriculture. I discussed several issues relating to our<br />
mineral exports and I say in relation to coal where opportunities<br />
may open up as a result of the review of coal policy and of<br />
the Maekawa Report said that Australia would have a very strong<br />
interest in competing on a commercial basis for any additional<br />
tonnages which were opened up as a result of those two factors.<br />
And I stressed to the Prime Minister as I have before that<br />
Australia is not seeking any special treatment or advantages.<br />
We simply sought to rely on our competitiveness and as a<br />
reliable supplier to the Japanese market. And I received<br />
re-assurances from Mr Nakasone that Japan would not be<br />
proceeding in this area with any bilateral arrangements at<br />
Australia's expense. I received a helpful briefing from<br />
Mr Nakasone on other-major matters which arose at the summit.<br />
That included terrorism, the United States/ Soviet talks on arms<br />
control, Chernobyl and the need to strengthen the International<br />
Atomic Energy Agency machinery. I might say there that on this<br />
matter wrote earlier this week to Mr Gorbachev on a number of<br />
nuclear issues. It was in response to his positions earlier in<br />
the year on the announcement of the Soviet positions. I responded<br />
to them and I called in that letter for Soviet support for our<br />
initiative which is a proposal that action be taken at the June<br />
meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency board of<br />
governors to initiate an international conference to negotiate<br />
an international convention on notification and emergency<br />
assistance in the event of nuclear accidents.<br />
We also discussed other issues of importance to both countries<br />
the Philippines where we agreed that we should do what is within<br />
our power to give support to the Aquino Administration and I<br />
indicated that while we had a relatively low level of-aid we<br />
had agreed to a 50% increase in that aid. And I sa-id that it<br />
would make sense for us in either bilaterally or in appropriate<br />
forums to see how best our aid could be co-operatively effected<br />
to give the best level of results. I reported to Mr Nakasone<br />
on developments in regard to ANZUS. Mr Nakasone reported on<br />
the good state of Japan's relations with China. And I also<br />
thanked Mr Nakasone for the substantial involvement by Japan<br />
in our forthcoming bicentennial celebrations. I also say I had<br />
a useful but fairly brief discussion with Foreign Minister Abe<br />
and that discussion covered essentially international economic </p>
<p>matters particularly the MTN round and he reported to me on<br />
developments in Japan/ Soviet relations. And we had a brief<br />
discussion about developments in the South Pacific. Well,<br />
ladies and gentlement I think that covers country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister has the Chernobyl accident given<br />
you cause to rethink your support for nuclear power particularly<br />
your belief that Australia should export uranium to the world.<br />
PM: No. The fact is that something like one-sixth of the<br />
electricity power in the world is generated by nuclear means and<br />
while there will be some reconsideration in some parts obviously<br />
as a result of Chernobyl. The important parts of the world are<br />
going to continue to rely and some to increase their reliance<br />
on this source of power. We as a world community would be<br />
foolish in the extreme if we didn't to seek to learn as much<br />
as we can from the Chernobyl. And this is why we believe there<br />
should be this international conference to try and create a<br />
situation by international convention so that we are not going<br />
to have a position where it would be the sort isolation which<br />
existed for so long in regard to Chernobyl. We should try and<br />
learn from experience and ensure that as far as possible<br />
everything is done to prevent a repetition of that sort of<br />
accident. But while the world is going to rely to the substantial<br />
extent that it does on nuclear generation of power then I think<br />
the reason that we have advanced for Australia's involvement<br />
remain valid. That is we want international nuclear fuel<br />
cycles to be as safe as they possibly can be. No country has a<br />
more rigorous regime of safeguards on the supply o -f uranium<br />
than does Australia. And it is still indisputably true that<br />
if Australia were to withdraw from being a supplier then to<br />
that extent the international nuclear fuel cycle would become<br />
lessafe than it is. So I repeat we would be foolish not to<br />
learn as much as we possibly can from Chernobyl. We should take<br />
the sort of steps that Australia has initiated through the<br />
IAEA and we will be hopeful that we will get support for that<br />
initiative.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you have any ideas on how you might<br />
breakdown the international secrecy in the nuclear industry and<br />
also in your letter have you....... have you any ideas or<br />
suggestions....... of where the line might be drawn on what is<br />
a notifiable incident? What constitues a serious enough<br />
accident? PM: Well, when you are talking Paul, about the breaking down<br />
of secrecy, obviously when you are talking about the Soviet<br />
Union you are talking about relatively a secretive society. I<br />
don't want to get into a political argument or dialogue about<br />
their secrecy other than to say this that I believe that there<br />
are certain aspects of national behaviour and events that occur<br />
within national boundaries which by definition transcend the<br />
interests of one nation. Clearly Chernobyl was one such event<br />
because by definition the radioactive fallout could not be<br />
contained to the Soviet Union. So I would hope that really in<br />
this area of generation....... nuclear power that there could be<br />
an acceptance that there should be complete openness in regard<br />
to any incident or accident that may arise because I think each </p>
<p>country has an obligation to the rest of the world to try and<br />
ensure that it can learn from that experience so that there<br />
should be created the greatest possible environment of safety<br />
for the use of this method of generation. I haven't deigned<br />
in my initiating letter to try and spell these details out.<br />
That seems to me a matter precisely for meetings of technical<br />
and political experts who should be involved in drawing up<br />
such an international convention that we suggest.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, is it your view that high Yen has been<br />
behind Australia's deterioration in terms trade and did Mr<br />
Nakasone or Mr Abe give you any idea about where they thought<br />
the Yen would be going over the short term?<br />
PM: well, it is not a question of my thinking. It is an<br />
obvious fact that part of the explanation for the deterioration<br />
of our terms of trade have been associated with that factor<br />
No, in answer to the second part of your question Greg. Neither<br />
of them gave any suggest~ ion as to what they thought the<br />
appropriate alignment of the Yen was with other currencies.<br />
But what is obviously clear is that the very significant<br />
appreciation of the Yen is a factor now here in Japan in their<br />
realisation that they have to look at the restructuring of their<br />
economy and the types and disposition of their economic activity.<br />
And it is within that context Greg, that I think the Maekawa<br />
Report has a very particular significance. The two things together<br />
should mean I believe that there will be significant restructuring<br />
of the Japanese economy. And that is why I have sought to say<br />
to Prime Minister Nakasone that we should it as in our mutual<br />
interests as we are in Australia are also as you know undertaking<br />
a process of gradual restructuring of our economy. To see where<br />
two economies which over the years have become more and more<br />
inter-related 26% of our exports coming here, 22% of our<br />
imports coming from here. Now obviously there is already a<br />
significant inter-relationship. It only makes intelligent<br />
good sense therefore in those circumstances that we should try<br />
and see what are the implications of the restructuring that is<br />
taking place to try and see how for our mutual benefit we can't<br />
open new areas of joint activity or identification of areas<br />
which we better developed in * Australia or here. And-it was in<br />
that context that. I made the suggestion which Mr Nakasone<br />
responded affirmatively of the interchange of investment missions<br />
between our two countries.<br />
JOURNALIST:. Any particular areas of the market?<br />
PM: No, not exhaustively but let me give you one obvious-example<br />
Michelle. There has this massive increase in Japanese tourists<br />
to Australia. As I say over 100,000 Japanese tourists and the<br />
expectation of a very strong continuing increase in that area.<br />
Now it seems therefore sensible that the Japanese may consider<br />
investment in the accommodation, recreation, tourist area.<br />
I just give that as an example. I think there is already evidence<br />
that in some high tech areas computer software Australia has<br />
developed quite significant capacities. Now there is another<br />
example I think where there may be the opportunity for significant<br />
joint activity and investment by Japan in Australia. So I just<br />
use those examples but it would be the job of these joint<br />
investment missions to examine this question in more, detail. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Would you like to see visa free entry for Japanese<br />
tourists? PM: The question hasn't been raised with us in this visit. As<br />
you know the matter has been raised in Australia but we haven't<br />
yet considered at a Cabinet level. Let me say this, you could<br />
see that there could be certain advantages given the very<br />
considerable increase in Japanese tourists. Then again we have<br />
to look at the questions security and I think generally<br />
Australia has a very good record in this area. It is not<br />
something that we could just rush into. We will look at it<br />
very closely for the reasons I have put and also it would<br />
raise questions of comparisons with other countries. So it is<br />
a matter that will have to be carefully looked at.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the Maekawa Report, how widely did you interpret<br />
Mr Nakasone's words when he said Japanese leadership......<br />
PM: Well, he put it in terms of his Party. So I believe the<br />
interpretation that I took and my colleagues took from his<br />
statement was that there was a broad acceptance of the need<br />
to accept the thrust of the Report. Let me make it clear that<br />
he was not saying that it was going to be implemented in full<br />
tomorrow. They were beginning the process. I believe that as I<br />
said earlier when you take into account the very substantial<br />
realignment of the Yen, the implications of that that the<br />
thrust of the Maekawa Report is totally logical.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, was Mr Keating wise yesterday to use<br />
alarmist phrases such as ' banana republic'.<br />
PM: Well, I think it is always wise Mike, when you are looking<br />
at what is said by Mr Keating or Bob Hawke or anyone else to<br />
make sure that you look at the whole context of his remarks.<br />
And what Paul was saying was if you don't pursue sensible and<br />
appropriate policies now which are-relevant to dealing with<br />
situation that confronts then if you don't pursue those sorts<br />
of policies then Australia could be in trouble. You could have<br />
the sort of situation that that language was averting to. Let<br />
me make it quite clear' and I am talking with the advantage of<br />
having had discussions with Paul on the telephone that what he<br />
is making clear in Australia is precisely what I said to you<br />
people and that is that there are these elements The<br />
internal Australian economy is in good shape. The facts are<br />
-quite obvious there but we have suffered from a devastating<br />
turn around in the terms of trade. And what both Paul Keating<br />
and I are saying is that the effect of the depreciation is<br />
working but that depreciation can't beat change in the terms of<br />
trade by itself. Let me give you the evidence of the way in<br />
which the depreciation is working. The export volumes are up<br />
at this stage by more than was forecast at the time of the last<br />
Budget. Imports have gone down by 7% in the last three months.<br />
But just to give you some example of the impact of price<br />
movements just look as we are here in Japan at the importance<br />
of steaming and coking coal. Just look at what's happened in<br />
prices. 1984 prices of steaming and coking coal were down 11%<br />
on 1984, down 21% on 1983. If you look at sugar even though<br />
there has been some recovery now, prices are down 45% on 1984<br />
and 50% on 1983. A dramatic way of looking at it if had<br />
this sort of terms of trade situation at the end of 1984<br />
applied up until March 1986, that would have saved us </p>
<p>$ 4h billion on the current account. Now I am not saying that we<br />
simply say well, if that had been the case wouldn't it be nice.<br />
I am trying to make the point Mike, that this is the sort of<br />
measure of the impact upon us of the dramatic turn around in the<br />
terms of trade. Now, what is required in these circumstances is<br />
not some dramtic new direction policy. What is required is that<br />
we make sure that the elements of policy that we have been<br />
working with continue to be stressed and the right decisions<br />
made in regard to them. It certainly means that with that very<br />
dramatic change in the terms of trade we have to recognise the<br />
impact that has upon the capacity to provide certain standards.<br />
And we have to make sure that the public sector plays its part<br />
in dealing with this situation. So it gives an added emphasis<br />
to the work on which we have been engaged in ERC. But we have<br />
known that the work has to be done and if you like this has<br />
confirmed the necessity for what we are doing there. The States<br />
and public sector borrowing generally has to play its part in<br />
dealing with this situation. And I repeat here what I said<br />
earlier that what in a sense we are dealing with now is the<br />
problem of success. I go ba-ck to what happened in 1983. What<br />
we did then when we came to government was to see that the<br />
worst recession in 50 years could be turned around by sensible<br />
government policies in co-operation with the Australian people.<br />
That is what we did. Now we are in a sense dealing with the<br />
success in part of our policies, very high levels of growth and<br />
we have recognise that we have to have the appropriate policies<br />
to deal with. Now I don't apologise for the length of the answer<br />
Mike. I am trying to put in the total context what Paul was<br />
saying. I think when you do that and take into account what I am<br />
saying the conclusion you can formis this, the Government<br />
recognises and has been recognising the changing nature, if you<br />
like, of the problems with which we have to deal and we will<br />
ensure that the instruments of policy available to us will be<br />
utilised to deal with that problem. As a community we showed<br />
in 1983 our capacity to deal the worst economic problem Australiahad<br />
for 50 years I am sure we can do it again.<br />
JOURNALIST: ' Prime Minister, did you ask Mr Keating to be<br />
careful of the sort of language he uses in the future? You<br />
didn't put that too him<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: what did you think of the market figures?<br />
PM: The market goes on for more'than one day. The market<br />
yesterday seemed to react somewhat. At least there-is a<br />
relationship he spoke and then the market moved. The market<br />
has come up again today. The market is a strange animal as you<br />
know Geoff.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it responsible for a Treasurer to make statements<br />
that are going to cut 4 cents of the price of<br />
PM: Well, you have got the problem that if you look at what<br />
part of what the Treasurer said out of its total context it<br />
could be seen as rather horrific. I suppose it was. But if you<br />
read the total context of what the Treasurer said where he said </p>
<p>7.<br />
look here are the things that need to be done and i-f these<br />
things aren't done then you can have a dramatic sort of situation.<br />
I would think if the whole context had been seen you may not<br />
have had the reaction that you did. This is a constant problem<br />
people in public life. You ought to know. Some of the things I<br />
have said, if they had been taken out of context it would have<br />
been enough to hang me but fortunately you are usually good<br />
enough to put them in context.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you made certain guarantees to the State<br />
and the last Premiers Conference about....... tax sharing. In view<br />
of the seriousness of the situation are those guarantees up for<br />
grabs? Pm: well, you will appreciate that what the Government provides<br />
by way of revenue to the States is not exclusively covered by<br />
the 2% for the recurrent expenditures. Let me simply say<br />
generally as Mr Keating has been saying that I think the States<br />
are going to have play their part in the exercise in restraint<br />
which is necessary.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke policy adjustment as a result of<br />
the very substantial<br />
PM: No, I don't think so at this stage. I think if you look at<br />
there has been a fairly substantial discount which has been<br />
agreed to and I repeat that if you look at Australian history,<br />
I don't think there has been a period in the past where you have<br />
had such high levels of growth where you have had such restrained<br />
wages outcomes. I think it is sensible at this point to continue<br />
with the processes of the Accord which have produced that result.<br />
You will appreciate that the Accord II does contain the vision<br />
of the end of the Accord for rediscussion. Now that capacity is<br />
there. I don't think that at this point that it is appropriate<br />
to go to that. I think we have got to as a Government pursue<br />
our task that I have referred to in the Budget area and I hope that<br />
exercise and its associated needs of restraint on the part of<br />
the States will meet the problem we are confronting. I don't<br />
think there is any necessity at this point to go beyond that.<br />
