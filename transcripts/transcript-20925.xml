    <content><![CDATA[<p>His Excellency the Governor-General Major-General Michael Jeffery AC CVO MC has today approved my recommendations for significant changes to the Ministry.</p>
<p>  These changes will further strengthen the Government, continue the process of renewal and regeneration of the Coalition';s front bench and reinforce the Government';s goals for Australia of national security, economic strength and social stability.</p>
<p>The Hon Philip Ruddock MP will become Attorney-General.  The Hon Daryl Williams QC AM MP will become Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts.  The Hon Tony Abbott MP will become Minister for Health and Ageing.  Senator the Hon Kay Patterson will become Minister for Family and Community Services and will become Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women.  Senator the Hon Amanda Vanstone will become Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.</p>
<p>There is one new Cabinet Minister, the Hon Kevin Andrews MP, who will become Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations.  Senator the Hon Ian Campbell and Ms Julie Bishop MP will join the outer Ministry.  Christopher Pyne MP and De-Anne Kelly MP will become parliamentary secretaries.</p>
<p>Recently Senator the Hon Richard Alston had indicated to me that he intended to retire from the Senate in the near future and that in the event of any Ministerial changes his Cabinet position should become available.</p>
<p>I wish to thank Richard Alston for his outstanding contribution to the Liberal Party at both the organisational and parliamentary levels.  A former President of the Victorian division, Senator Alston entered the Senate in 1986.  He served in a variety of shadow portfolios but his major achievements have been as Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts since 1996.  These include the sale of the first two tranches of Telstra and the associated telecommunications improvement packages (Networking the Nation), the establishment of the National Office of the Information Economy, reform of the ABC and improvements to broadcasting law and policies.</p>
<p>I propose to appoint Senator the Hon Nick Minchin, the Minister for Finance and Administration, as Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate.</p>
<p>The Hon Wilson Tuckey MP and I have discussed his future.  He told me that it was not his expectation that he would serve as a Minister in the event of the Government winning office again after the next election.  Given this it has been agreed between us that it is appropriate that he not be re-included in the Ministry as a result of the current reshuffle.</p>
<p>Wilson Tuckey has been a strong advocate of his portfolio interests since being appointed a Minister in 1998.  He was a strong supporter of balanced conservation policies and sensibly preserving job opportunities in forestry.  More recently, he has been responsible for promoting regional growth and development more generally, including the Indian Ocean territories.  He has throughout his parliamentary career been a tireless defender and promoter of small business.</p>
<p>Senator the Hon Ian Campbell will become Minister for Territories, Local Government and Roads.  He replaces Mr Tuckey and will bring to his new post a wealth of experience as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer.  He will continue as Manager of Government Business in the Senate.</p>
<p>Ms Julie Bishop MP, the Member for Curtin, will replace the Hon Kevin Andrews MP as Minister for Ageing.  Julie Bishop entered parliament in 1998 having had a very successful professional career as a partner in one of Australia';s largest law firms.</p>
<p>De-Anne Kelly MP, the Member for Dawson, will become the new Parliamentary Secretary to both the Leader and Deputy Leader of the National Party.  Senator the Hon Ron Boswell has indicated in discussions with the Deputy Prime Minister his agreement to this course of action.  Senator Boswell will remain Leader of the National Party in the Senate.</p>
<p>  Ron Boswell is one of the great fighters of the Federal Parliament, consistently standing up for Queensland and an energetic opponent of extreme groups such as the League of Rights.</p>
<p> I have also taken the opportunity to reallocate some other portfolio responsibilities to further focus the talent available to the Government on emerging policy priorities.</p>
<p>The Hon Mal Brough MP will become Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence.  His role will cover defence personnel matters and, importantly, he will assist in the implementation of the recommendations of the Kinnaird Review of Defence Procurement.  He takes over the role of Minister Assisting from the Hon Danna Vale MP, who remains Minister for Veterans'; Affairs.</p>
<p>In addition to his current responsibilities, the Hon Gary Hardgrave MP will become Minister Assisting the Prime Minister.  He will undertake a range of duties on my behalf.  The Hon Peter Slipper MP will continue in his responsibilities as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration.</p>
<p>  The Hon Ross Cameron MP currently Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services will become Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and will be replaced in his former role by Christopher Pyne MP, the Member for Sturt.</p>
<p>These Ministerial changes reflect the depth of talent available to the Government and my commitment to ensuring that the Coalition';s front bench remains attuned to emerging issues and priorities.</p>
<p>The new Ministry will be sworn in by the Governor-General next Tuesday, 7 October 2003.</p>
