EHBARGO: 7.00 p. m.<br />
FOR PRESS 15 OCTOBER 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
A sad and deplorable situation was exposed during this past<br />
week in the Parliament by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,<br />
Ian Viner. For some months now, the Cononwealth Government<br />
has been engaged in patient negotiations with the Northern<br />
Land Council, an elected body representing a large section of the<br />
Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory.<br />
The negotiations have been related to the social and environmental<br />
impact of uranium development in the Northern Territory.<br />
They have also related to the size of the royalties which the<br />
Aboriginals will receive from the minin of these deposits<br />
comprising about one-fifth of the world s known reserves of<br />
high-grade uranium ore.<br />
The Government' s decision to go ahead with the development of<br />
these deposits was reached after long and painstaking<br />
consideration intitally by Mr Justice Fox, who spent two years<br />
inquiring into every aspect of the matter, arnd then by the Government.<br />
Our responsibilities in this matter were both national and<br />
in an energy-short world, international. The decision-, as to go<br />
ahead. The negotiations with the Northern Land Council have not been<br />
about whether or not there should be uranium mrining. They<br />
have been about the terms and conditions under which the<br />
uranium deposits in the Northern Territory will be developed, and<br />
about the direct financial benefit to the Aboriginals of<br />
Arnhem Land and the Northern Territory<br />
The Northern Territory Aboriginals have been fortunate to have as<br />
their spokesman and Council Chairman during this period a young<br />
and capable leader who can speak for his people, and who is<br />
nobody's pawn. Galarrwuy Yunupingu has shown himself to me as<br />
a man as much at ease negotiating over the table as he is in<br />
the bush, and as a man thoroughly able to grasp the implications<br />
of the Territory's uranium riches, both as an Australian and as<br />
an Aboriginal. / 2 </p>
<p>As a result, and as Ian Viner told the House during the past<br />
week, he has become the target of a small group of zealots.<br />
They pretend to have Aboriginal interests at heart, but in"<br />
fact seek to use the Aboriginal community to achieve a different<br />
goal, and one which does not serve the Aboriginal interests<br />
at all the prevention of uranium development in Australia.<br />
The Labor Party has spread a web of intrigue in the north.<br />
The Labor Party involvement has been designed to frustrate the<br />
negotiations with the Aboriginals and to destroy the credibility<br />
of their representative body, the Northern Land Council, and the<br />
credibility of its spokesman, Galarrwuy Yunupingu.<br />
It is not too difficult to guess at the motive. The intriguers<br />
do not want ' men on the scene whom they cannot manipulate and use<br />
for their own purposes. The Labor Party spokesman on Aboriginal<br />
Affairs, Dr Doug Everingham, set out the position very clearly<br />
in a letter he wrote to, Galarrwuy Yunupingu last month when the<br />
push against him was at its strongest indeed, on the very day<br />
of the attempted coup.<br />
The thrust of Dr Everingham's letter seems to have been to accustom<br />
Galarrwuy Yunupingu to losing his position as his people's able and<br />
eloquent spokesman. His opening sentences, however, contain a<br />
most telling admission, and I quote:<br />
" I can understand your feelings that the ALP may be using<br />
Aboriginals for their own vested interests," Dr Everingham wrote to<br />
Galarrwuy Yunupingu. I quote again:<br />
" It is true that some people, most of them on the Labor side of<br />
politics, care more about stopping uranium mining and changing the<br />
Government in Darwin or Canberra than they do about Aboriginals or<br />
land rights."<br />
Well, that is certainly true, and those people have been plotting,<br />
intriguing, whispering and conniving amongst the Aboriginals of<br />
the Northern Territory. This is despite the decision the Council<br />
reached last month that Aboriginals should reach their own decision<br />
without the dubious benefit of their self-proclaimed friends.<br />
What has happened here is that a group of political activists<br />
tried, and failed, to stir up opposition in the community against<br />
the development of Australia's uranium deposits. Having been<br />
rejected by the trade unions, and by the community at large, they<br />
have turned on the Aboriginals of Arnhem Land in a final and<br />
desperate bid. We have seen the spectacle of high-powered hatchet<br />
men operating on the Aboriginal people to achieve their own aims<br />
at the expense of the Aborigines, and at the expense of all Australian!<br />
Their actions have been disgraceful. From the time the Government<br />
made its decision in August last year, it has carried out, and will<br />
continue to carry out, its obligations to environmental interests<br />
and to Aboriginal interests. We will soon be considering our<br />
next steps in this matter. </p>
