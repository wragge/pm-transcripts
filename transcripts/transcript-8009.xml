PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE ON DEPARTURE FROM<br />
ANKARA, TURKEY, 24 APRIL 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: With only hours to go till the anniversary<br />
landing or commemorating landing at Gallipoli, have you got<br />
any further thoughts than those you've expressed to the<br />
media and to the Australian public<br />
PM: Well, except to say that now that I have been in Turkey<br />
f or a day or so I am further reinforced in the admiration I<br />
have for the way in which the Turkish authorities have gone<br />
out of their way to ensure that this Australian pilgrimage<br />
will be assisted in every possible way. It is quite clear<br />
that our Turkish friends remember with the same sort of<br />
admiration as we do, the valour, the heroism, the commitment<br />
of the men from both sides who fought on Gallipoli 75 years<br />
ago. And as I had the opportunity of pointing out in my<br />
speech last night, it is something of a paradox, if you<br />
like, that-the warm relations between our two countries at<br />
the end of this century are founded in that conflict of<br />
years ago and I think we remember with now a particular<br />
sense of appreciation the way in which, after the end of<br />
those hostilities, in the words of Kemal Ataturk, the<br />
Australian men who died became regarded as the sons of<br />
Turkey as their remains rested in the soil of Turkey. These<br />
have been demonstrated to us to be much more than mere<br />
words. They do reflect a deep feeling of the Turkish people<br />
and they provide a bond between our two countries which is,<br />
is unique.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can I ask just one more question which is do<br />
you find it a paradox and an irony that you've offered..<br />
and tribute to the Turkish treatment to our veterans that<br />
have returned, given the experience 75 years ago?<br />
PM: It's the nature of war. I believe that, by definition,<br />
if two countries are at war, they believe in their cause<br />
and they are going to fight with total commitment to achieve<br />
their ends and that will mean throwing everything that each<br />
side has at the other and that involves no compromise. But<br />
if you regard those against whom you've fought as having<br />
been both capable and of having fought with integrity, then<br />
once that war is over, then the interests of the nations<br />
concerned and the people of those nations is going to be<br />
best served by trying to work in the future for cooperation </p>
<p>so that war will no longer be necessary. I think that we<br />
have made it quite clear as we are prepared to come to you<br />
on this pilgrimage, that we haven't come to glorify war and<br />
nor would we ever seek to do that. What we are doing is to<br />
pay homage to those who were prepared to pay and indeed so<br />
many of whom did pay, the supreme sacrifice, so that<br />
succeeding generations would have the opportunity of living<br />
in peace and that's the importance of this visit because<br />
those men on both sides died for what they believed to be<br />
right and, in a sense, I think they fought in the hope that<br />
in the future, war would not be necessary. Of course the<br />
events of the generation after 1915 proved that that hope<br />
was, at that time, in vain. But I think now there is an<br />
increasing realisation around the world that war is even<br />
more unthinkable now than it was then, but the instruments<br />
of destruction are such that you could never limit war to<br />
those immediately involved. But war today carries with it<br />
the possibility of the annihilation of mankind as we know it<br />
from the planet, so when we think about these battles of the<br />
past I think we remember even more fully than perhaps ever<br />
before the futility of war. And it's been very reassuring<br />
to us in our discussions with our friends here in Turkey to<br />
understand that their thinking is the same as ours in that<br />
respect. ends<br />
