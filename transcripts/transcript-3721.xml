PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
LIMA, PERU<br />
APRIL 1975<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Prime Minister, General Morales Bermudez<br />
and I will issue a statement to the press on Sunday morning<br />
that will include many of the things, most of the things, that<br />
we discussed yesterday and which some others of his ministers<br />
have discussed yesterday and today. In view of this I suppose<br />
there are some matters which you would like to ask me in<br />
anticipation. QUESTION: Could you give us details of the purchase of the<br />
Nomad aircraft. Has that been finalised?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No agreement has been made for the sale of the<br />
Nomad to the Peruvian armed forces. Nevertheless there have<br />
been some discussion proceeding for some weeks past. I believe<br />
that the choice is between the Nomad and one other aircraft.<br />
We were gratified that the President himself, General Juan Velasco<br />
Alvaradro, asked about the Australian aircraft industry and of<br />
course of the Prime Minister himself and several of<br />
his ministers are interested in the aircraft. The characteristics<br />
and performance of the Nomad were discussed, in general terms.<br />
But Mr Bowen and I were not here to conclude specific arrangements<br />
of a technical nature such as that.<br />
QUESTION: Did you discuss with the President the alleged subversive<br />
elements here and the CIA?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I make it a practice not to reveal what is said<br />
in private conversations of this character. There were only the<br />
President and I together there and so I wouldn't identify subjects<br />
or details.<br />
QUESTION: I wonder Mr Prime Minister if you could go into a little<br />
more detail as to the characteristics of the Nomad built-by the state<br />
plant in Australia and secondly, could you tell us whether you<br />
have conversed with the Peruvian authorities on the question of<br />
your becoming a member of the CIPEC group?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: First the Nomad. We believe the relevance of the<br />
Nomad to Peru and to neighbouring countries is the fact that it can<br />
operate from quite short airstrips. In fact it can operate from<br />
airstrips which are not sealed. It is a very sturdy, and rugged<br />
aircraft which can carry freight as well as people and it can do<br />
so from short and relatively unformed airstrips which one finds<br />
in such a mountainous country as Peru or the neighbouring countries.<br />
It has, we think, a very good performance in those difficult and<br />
testing conditions. It could supply isolated centres very well.<br />
You also asked about CIPEC, the organisation of Copper Exporting<br />
Countries, of which the present members are Chile, Peru, Zaire<br />
and Zambia. Australia is an observer at conferences of the CIPEC<br />
countries, and the suggestion was made by the Peruvian ministers<br />
yesterday that Australia and Papua New Guinea and the Philippines </p>
<p>-2-<br />
might also become full members of CIPEC. This suggestion had not<br />
previously been made to Australia by any of the present members<br />
of CIPEC. It was an interesting suggestion as far as we are<br />
concerned and I'm sure we woul . d give it very sympathetic consideration.<br />
It accords with our general attitude that countries which depend<br />
on the sale of minerals should have a more secure and predictable<br />
market than they have hitherto been able to enjoy. Australia,<br />
like Peru, is a very large mineral exporting country. We have,<br />
like Peru, had greatly fluctuating incomes from our exports.<br />
We want to see that those incomes are more predictable. Also we<br />
want to see that industries in our own countries are based<br />
increasingly on those mineral resources.<br />
QUESTION: A large number of American states have moved to<br />
establish diplomatic relations with Cuba. When do you expect<br />
Australia itself to make such a move and will this be one of the<br />
topics of discussion when you visit Washington?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Last year Australia received a Consulate from<br />
Cuba. Cuba had made the request to the previous Australian<br />
government which had not responded. My Government did respond<br />
and allowed the Consulate to be established. I think it unlikely<br />
that any diplomatic relations between Cuba would be discussed<br />
in Washington. Naturally, however, while in Peru, I was anxious<br />
to know the assessment of Peru of-the likelihood of Cuba being<br />
re-admitted to the Organisation of American States and any<br />
commercial embargoes against Cuba being lifted. Obviously<br />
Australia's attitude in this matter which is not of the highest<br />
pri ' ority as far as Australia is concerned would be very much<br />
influenced by the attitude of the O. A. S.<br />
QUESTION: Peru and other nations of the copper group have recently<br />
cut back on copper productions in an attempt to get an increase<br />
on the current low world price. Would Australia consider doing<br />
the same to assist these countries in getting a higher price?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Like. all the copper exporting countries Australia<br />
has suffered from the drop in prices. The CIPEC countries<br />
reduced their exports by 15 per cent in quantity. Australia has<br />
reduced hers by 10 per cent.<br />
QUESTION: I wonder MR Prime Minister whether you intend to sign<br />
any important agreements with the Peruvian Government in the<br />
field of technical and economic co-operation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: On Sunday morning the Prime Minister and I will<br />
be signing an agreement for an inter-governmental joint commission<br />
in several fields including the particular fields of scientific<br />
co-operation ; you mentioned.<br />
QUESTION: You are the second foreign leader to meet with President<br />
Velasco since February. I would like to know whether he discussed<br />
his health with you and what your assessment was of the President's<br />
health? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't presume to express an opinion about<br />
the health of President Juan Valasco Alvarado. He seemed to me<br />
to be in robust good health and excellent spirits.<br />
QUESTION: What prospects do you see for Australia gaining observer<br />
status at the next conference of the non-aligned movement. And<br />
secondly if I may are we seeking full membership?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Membership of the non-aligned group has not been<br />
sought by Australia, nor offered to Australia. There are a great<br />
number of members of the non-aligned group in Australia's<br />
neighbourhood, in fact most of Australia's neighbours are members<br />
of the group. In those circumstances it seems to the Australian<br />
Government that it would be appropriate for Australia to have<br />
observer status at the meetings of the group. Accordingly I have<br />
discussed this when I have had conversations with Heads of<br />
Government of prominent members of the group, such as Sri Lanka,<br />
India, Yugoslavia and now Peru. The group is increasingly<br />
interested in economic matters. The Australian Government's<br />
attitude on economic matters in various international forums has<br />
aroused a great deal of interest And support among members of<br />
the group. Australia already has observer status in many bodies<br />
to which Peru belongs. I have mentioned CIPEC already, there is<br />
in addition O. A. S. and the members of the Andean pact, the<br />
Acuerdo de Cartegna.<br />
QUESTION: Observer status is quite often the first step to full<br />
membership. Is full membership of the non-aligned group a longterm<br />
aim of the Australian Government. And also if there was<br />
a strong feeling among that group that they would like to see<br />
you as a full member, would that influence you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have seen no inclination in the countries that<br />
I have mentioned or in any other countries, to offer full membership<br />
to Australia. Australia is in fact an aligned country because there<br />
is an arrangement between Australia, New Zealand and the United<br />
States arising from their association in the Second World War.<br />
Accordingly it wouldn't be appropriate in the present circumstances,<br />
or those that are contemplated, for Australia to seek full<br />
membership. QUESTION: What do you see as the most important development to come<br />
out of this visit, the first of an Australian Prime Minister to a<br />
South American country?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believer there is an awareness in Peru of the<br />
relevance of Australia to Peru's interests and aspirations in a<br />
very great number of fields. Very clearly after the direct<br />
discussions between Mr Bowen and me on one side, and the Peruvian<br />
ministers it is realised that the whole question of the exploration<br />
and the development and the marketing of our mineral resources is<br />
something that we can do very much better in consultation and<br />
co-operation with each other than we could at a distance from each<br />
other. Moreover there are a great number of diplomatic matters<br />
in which we have shown an identity of interests. We were through </p>
<p>-4-<br />
1973 and 1974 members of the United Nations Security Council.<br />
Australia adopted an attitude at the UNIDO Conference in Lima<br />
which was appreciated by the less developed countries. Peru and<br />
Australia were very conscious of the hazards of the environment<br />
of the Pacific through the atmospheric nuclear tests. For<br />
centuries Australia and Peru, in so far as they've thought<br />
about each other at all, have regarded the Pacific as a barrier<br />
rather than a link. I can't say that Australians have been<br />
sufficiently aware of Peru: I don't believe that Peruvians<br />
have been sufficiently aware of Australia. We have during these<br />
days set out to correct this mutual indifference or ignorance.<br />
After all it was from Callalo, half a dozen miles from here that<br />
navigators set out to cross the Pacific to discover the great<br />
South land. There has never been a Peruvian minister visit<br />
Australia. Until Senator Willesee, the Australian Foreign Minister,<br />
came to Peru last year there had never been an Australian minister<br />
visit Peru. There was an Australian Prime Minister born in<br />
South American, John Christian Watson, the first Labor Prime<br />
Minister, but there had never been an Australian Prime Minister<br />
visit South America. So we are redressing this situation.<br />
The Prime Minister, General Francisco Morales Bermudez, has<br />
accepted by invitation to visit Australia at a time which is<br />
mutually convenient to us.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, you said that you had no information<br />
or had received no information from countries on joining the<br />
group. At a Press Conference with the Peruvian Foreign Minister<br />
this afternoon, he pointed out that he would be happy to support<br />
Australia, and gave us the example of Cyprus which was also an<br />
aligned country. In view of this would you reconsider any<br />
point in Australia becoming a member of the group?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I've got nothing to add to what I have said<br />
previously to this. Most of the countries in the non-aligned<br />
group regard Australia's alignment as disqualifying it. </p>
