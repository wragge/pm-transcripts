<p>The Federal Government today announced that arrangements are being made to ensure that natural disaster assistance is available to help communities in south eastern Tasmania recover from the devastating bushfires that have hit the region.</p>
<p>This will help fire-stricken communities in Tasmania get back on their feet as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The assistance will be available in coming days in the Sorell and Tasman Local Government Areas. The needs of other areas are being closely monitored.</p>
<p>This is a tragic time for those who have suffered loss in the devastating Tasmanian bushfires.</p>
<p>The Australian Government, through Emergency Management Australia, is liaising closely with Tasmanian authorities who are the first responders.</p>
<p>A range of assistance grants are in the process of being made available through the Tasmanian Department of Health and Human Services:</p>
<p>Â·         Emergency Assistance Grants to meet the immediate needs of individuals/families ($200 per adult, $100 per child, maximum of $750 per family)</p>
<p>Â·         Temporary living grants of up to $8,875 (over a maximum period of 6 months) to assist with living expenses</p>
<p>Â·         Essential household goods grants of up to $5,600 per household (plus $500 per additional household member up to a maximum of $8,875) for costs not covered by insurance, to assist with the replacement of essential household items</p>
<p>Â·         Repair/replacement grants of up to $8,875 to assist with the re-establishment of the principal place of residence.</p>
<p>The assistance will be jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the Tasmanian Government under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements to help alleviate the personal hardship being experienced by individuals and families. It will also assist local authorities conduct counter-disaster operations to assist individuals.</p>
<p>Information on the range of assistance that is available can be found at<a href="http://www.disasterassist.gov.au">www.disasterassist.gov.au</a> or at <a href="http://www.dhhs.tas.gov.au">www.dhhs.tas.gov.au</a></p>
<p>As severe hot weather affects other parts of Australia, everyone should ensure they take the appropriate precautions to stay safe and monitor information from your local emergency service agencies.</p>
<p>The work carried out by the emergency services personnel, police, fire, ambulance, SES and other volunteers across Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia recently in such extreme conditions reminds us of the pride and dedication we have as a nation to keeping our communities safe and protected.</p>
<p>With the hot weather predicted to continue in the next week, these and other men and women will again be called upon to protect their communities across Australia.</p>
<p>This is yet another sobering reminder of the need to prepare for the risk of bushfires and staying regularly informed of developments through local radio and local emergency services websites.</p>
