    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today marks 18 months since the election and every day this Government has been working to clean up the mess we inherited and to lay the foundations needed for a stronger Australia.</p>
<p>We stopped the boats.</p>
<p>Weâve scrapped the carbon and mining taxes, and weâve started rolling out the biggest infrastructure plan in Australiaâs history.</p>
<p>Weâve signed three free trade agreements that will set up Australia for the long term.</p>
<p>Our focus is on you â and your life â to make it easier and to give you more opportunity.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, weâve tackled the issues that you have been raising with me and my colleagues.Â  Weâve made decisions like: stopping illegal foreign ownership of residential property; improving the standards for food labelling; giving greater support for small businesses with a new grocery code; and demonstrating a tougher approach on hate preachers.</p>
<p>And weâve listened to you â the Medicare co-payment is now dead and weâve provided a pay increase to members of the Australian Defence Force.</p>
<p>Last week, we released the Intergenerational Report which details the challenges and the opportunities our country will face over the years and decades ahead and in coming months, there will be a families package that will focus on child care so we can help families by making child care more accessible and affordable.</p>
<p>There will be a small business and jobs package â with a small business tax cut â because small business is the engine room of our economy.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â </p>
<p>And we will continue to strengthen our national security to keep our country safe.</p>
<p>This Government is working in your interest and for the benefit of all Australians â we always have and we always will.</p>
<p>7 March 2015</p>
