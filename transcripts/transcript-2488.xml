VISIT TO T~ HE UNITED STATES<br />
AND TFF UNITED KIN'GDOM11 1971.<br />
SAN FRANCISCO<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME<br />
MINISTER, MR W1ILLIAM 71c. 4AHON, ON ARRIVAL<br />
27 OCTOBER 1971.<br />
Q Would you comment on the events in the U. N concerning<br />
admi:: sion of Mainland China?<br />
p;: Yes I would. Our objectives -the combined objectives of<br />
Australia, the United States and Japan were to ensure that the<br />
People's Republic of China became a member of the United Nations<br />
and held the permanent seat on the Security Council, But if we<br />
also belie'-e in the principles of the United Nations and we know<br />
that the Government in Taiwan is in effective control of that<br />
country and represents fourteen and a half million people, including<br />
twelve million Taiwanese, we wanted them to remain a<br />
member. The U. S. and ourselves have cooperated at least over<br />
the last eighteen months to come to a common conclusion about<br />
what should be done and to work out the tactics. At one time<br />
I thought there was every prospect of being successful, but<br />
after the procedural resolution was agreed to, and by a small<br />
majority we failed in the Important Question resolution, it<br />
then became only a question of time before the People's Republic<br />
was admitted and the Taiwan Government was omitted from the<br />
United Nations that is expelled. We think it is bad luck<br />
because we think it w,. ould have been a greater contribution to<br />
world peace if both countries had remained and been able to<br />
play their part in a peaceful solution of the world's problems<br />
but now it has occurred we have to live with it and we have to<br />
do all we can, whether it be the gre~ at countries or the more<br />
moderately sized countries like ourselves, in order to ensure<br />
that China, that is the People's Republic of China, does play<br />
its part in making a contribution to peace in the Asian area,<br />
particularly that part of the Asian area in which we live.<br />
Q What future do you envision for the Taiwan Government<br />
in the world / 2 </p>
<p>02.<br />
PM Well, Taiwan will decide its own future and the course of<br />
action that it will take in world affairs. I don't think it will<br />
make a dramatic difference but so much will depend upon the thinking<br />
of the Chiang Kai-shek Government, but of course trade will<br />
continue between Taiwan and other countries and it is difficult<br />
at this moment for anyone to make a precise analysis or a precise<br />
forecast of the likely course of action in diplomatic relationships.<br />
We haven't in Austral~ a yet considered the question of diplomatic<br />
representation, but we have as a corollary to that, we are having<br />
discussions, preliminary discussions, with the People's Republic of<br />
China to davelop more healthy bilateral relationships between our<br />
two countries.<br />
Q Were you surprised at the outcome of the vote<br />
PM Not surprised. Not being a bet%_~ man, I didn't have a bet<br />
on it. But I thought of the figures and I felt there would be two<br />
or three votes in it that is the Lziportant Question and no more,<br />
and that's how it turned out. If two or three people had changed<br />
their votes, of course, the Important Question would have been<br />
passed and that would have required a two thirds majority to expel<br />
Taiwan. But once the Important QOuestion was lost, then you could<br />
expect a lot of countries would jump on the bandwagon and they did.<br />
And although we had fallback positions, there was little hope of a<br />
fallback position succeeding. People did jump on the bandwagon,<br />
there were a lot I can assure you who disappointed us, even on the<br />
vote of the Jnportant Cxestion, because their best interests would<br />
have been served by voting in favour of the . Important Question and<br />
the retention of the position of Taiwan. But having said all that,<br />
it is up to us now, and all those who believe in peace, particularly<br />
those who live in the Western Pacific area, to do our best and to<br />
try to draw China into the comity of nations and to try to harness<br />
the great power and influence of China in the interests of peace.<br />
Q What effect, if any, does this have on Australia<br />
PM Not a great deal of effect on us, but now we will be watching<br />
very carefully to see what action the People's Republic of<br />
China will take about our initiatives initiatives taken by the<br />
Australian Government to continue the dialogue and impro-9 op7;<br />
relations with them. WNe have already commenced in several countries<br />
and there have been contacts about not so much trade relationships,<br />
but improving trade contatts. We hope to be able to hoar<br />
from the People's Republic soon about these. But might I make our<br />
position clear I think this i. s wise Wc have no restrictions<br />
on trade with them other than in strategic goods. We let our<br />
people go there freely. There are no restrictions placed upon our<br />
own people. We give them their passports and all they have to do<br />
is get a visa from the People's Republic. We wvelcome and encourage<br />
movement of cultural and scientific people. So there are very few<br />
restrictions. But nonetheless we will move steadily to improving<br />
our relationships. Much remains in their hands and, as you know,<br />
they don't move very quickly. </p>
