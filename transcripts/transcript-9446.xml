PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
MEETING OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING<br />
COUNCIL At today's meeting of my Science and Engineering Council, Profesor Fiona<br />
Stanley, a member of Council and head of the Institute of Child Health<br />
Rdsea:' ch in Perth, presented a report entitled Research fo?-a7Re-athy Society.<br />
Tfe-report wa . s prepared by an independent working party of which Prdfedsor<br />
Stanley was convenor.<br />
The key message of this report is that health and medical research have a<br />
great impact on the health and quality of life of all Australians. It focuses on<br />
the way health and medical research feeds into clinical practice and the<br />
delivery of health services, reducihg the rates of preventable illness and<br />
premature death, and improving the cost-effectiveness and equity of supply of<br />
services. The report presents a number of case studies to illustrate its arguments. For<br />
example, it points to the success of Australian scientists in identifying the link<br />
between peptic ulcers and the bacterium Helicobacter pylor. It now appears<br />
likely that 80-90% of peptic ulcers can be cured with two weeks of antibiotic<br />
treatment. A particular emphasis is the need for more private sector funding for health<br />
and medical research. The report notes that backing by philanthropic and<br />
industry sources on the major scale common in other countries is still rare in<br />
Australia. The working party has identified a number of important issues. I have asked<br />
my colleague the Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence, to<br />
respond to its recommendations.<br />
A second item concerned high performance computing and communications<br />
( HPCC).<br />
HPCC is an exciting technology, and a powerful tool for tackling a vaniety of<br />
industry and other problems, such as designing complex engineering<br />
components, or modelling the greenhouse effect. It comprises the ' top end' of<br />
computing power and performance, ranging from high performance<br />
workstations to the latest and most powerful supercomputers.<br />

An independent working party chaired by Dr John O'Callaghan, Chief of the<br />
Division of Information Technology in CSIRO, drew the Council's attention to<br />
the need for an Action Plan to develop HPCC in Australia. Their report<br />
identified a need to develop internationally competitive HPCC capability in<br />
Australia. It also noted that industry has been very slow in taking up the<br />
technology and realising the considerable benefits it offers.<br />
The Government wants to encourage inoustry to make the most of the<br />
increased competitiveness and Cost savings that can be gained from the<br />
application of HPCC. It already has in place a number of strategies for<br />
supporting HPCC technologies. These include funding through the Australian<br />
Research Council, through Cooperative Research Centres, and through the<br />
National Research Facilities Program announced in Working Nation.<br />
I have asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook,<br />
and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Crean. to advise<br />
me on the future development of HPCC capability in Australia.<br />
The Council meeting also indluded an Innovation Forum, chaired by the<br />
Minister for Industry Science and Technology and Ministbr Assisting for<br />
Science, Senator Peter Cook.<br />
This forum involved a number of short presentations from industry and other<br />
leaders, on their expeniences of the innovation process. Topics addressed<br />
included the innovation in the mining industry, in universities, in technology<br />
based companies, and the global environment for innovation.<br />
The session was part of the Government's consultation process in the lead up<br />
to the 1995 Statement on Innovation.<br />
The Council is a forum which allows me and other Ministers with responsibility<br />
for science and technology to meet leaders of industry and members of the<br />
scientific community. It meets twice a year.<br />
Today's discussions at the Council emphasised its important role in the<br />
science and technology consultation process, and in bringing in science,<br />
engineering and technology matters to the attention of Government.<br />
