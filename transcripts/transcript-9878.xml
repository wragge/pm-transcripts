TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, BENDIGO ART GALLERY, BENDIGO, 12 DECEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, the Queensland by-election has been announced for<br />
February 3, how does that affect the timing of the federal election?<br />
PM: It doesn't. They are just separate issues, completely separate issues.<br />
I think people know that.<br />
J: Will you be going to Queensland to see if Wayne Goss is going to<br />
want some help with the election?<br />
PM: It is a by-election. I can't remember one Prime Minister ever involved<br />
in a State by-election not ever.<br />
J: How do you think the Government will go?<br />
PM: In the by-election, you mean?<br />
J: Yes.<br />
PM: Oh, I think the Government will win it because I think Wayne Goss has<br />
got in there, got on with the job. It has got a very good feel about it<br />
Queensland. I think it has got tremendous potential, particularly with<br />
the Asia-Pacific growing the way it is and its links with it and the shift<br />
of population. It has got the wind behind its sails and he is driving it.<br />
J: Mr Keating, did you have any talks with Mr Goss about the timing of it?<br />
PM: No. I haven't spoken with him in the last two days either.<br />
J: Will Joe Helper win the next election in Bendigo?<br />
PM: Well I think he will and this city and this electorate needs someone like<br />
him to represent them in the national government and to do some<br />
more things like we have done today. </p>
<p>J: Do you think Bruce Reid is strong enough to win though?<br />
PM: Well, to be honest with you, I hardly know their names of some of<br />
these Coalition fellows because you don't ever hear from them. And,<br />
today, we have said we will take the historic gallery of this city, you<br />
walk through that facade into the old galleries of it. It is one of the<br />
historic cities of Australia and the art gallery ought to be the place of<br />
recording some of its history. So we are going to join the city and<br />
bring it back to life. Now you know Joe was on my back about it. I saw<br />
the sense of it. We have gone and done it. Today we also announced<br />
the transfer of the tourist information centre down to the former<br />
post office, which is $ 213,000. We are spending just on $ 400,000<br />
here in these things, on top of the $ 2 million we will spend on the<br />
gallery. So these are, I think, for the core precinct of the city, all strong<br />
for its tourism, understanding the great heritage which is here and<br />
using it as well as the community facilities. I mean we have got a full<br />
office here of the Department of Employment, Education and Training.<br />
We have got very large labour market programs for the unemployed<br />
and the long term unemployed and that is growing. I think this year,<br />
I am relying on my memory, but in terms of support for<br />
Local Government, other Commonwealth payments to Bendigo, I think<br />
it is somewhere of the order of around $ 55 million. And that is,<br />
of course, outside the Social Security system, outside of Medicare and<br />
outside all the mainframe programs.<br />
So that is at the time when Victoria is pulling out money for education,<br />
pulling out money for health. The Kennett government is withdrawing<br />
funding from here. We are the ones interested in the place and so that<br />
is why we want him here.<br />
J: Mr Keating, there was a handful of.-East Timorese demonstrators at the<br />
lunch in the park today. In an interview, the newly appointed<br />
Indonesian Ambassador has described the Dili massacre as merely an<br />
incident and wants Australia to get tough on flag burning.<br />
PM: I have not seen the interview. I don't know what he said, Peter<br />
( Harvey). I have no idea. I have never seen anything he has said<br />
about issues affecting Australia and Indonesia, or Australia and Timor.<br />
J: I realise that, but he said this in Paris.<br />
PM: Well let's see what he said, Peter, and we will give a remark later.<br />
J: Mr Keating, fuel prices, the difference between what city people are<br />
paying as compared to people here in Bendigo and other regional<br />
centres. What is being done at this stage?<br />
PM: Well, petrol discounting comes and goes, I know. But you do get<br />
regional disparities in petrol prices. I mean, essentially, these things </p>
<p>are set in the market. We have a freight equalisation scheme which<br />
does Affect beneficially many parts of Australia. But, I am just not sure<br />
to what extent it affects Bendigo.<br />
J: Mr Keating, any response to Jeff Kennett calling you a jelly back?<br />
PM: Poor old Jeffrey. I mean, I don't know what he puts on his rice crispies<br />
of a morning, the old Jeffrey. Some days he sprinkles them with<br />
Valium other days he sprinkles them with chilli.<br />
J: Is Community and Nation federal Labor's backflip on City Link as Mr<br />
Kennett has claimed?<br />
PM: Community and Nation is a very great reform of Australia's public<br />
housing system, that's what it is principally. Getting support for<br />
tenants in both public and private housing, to kick on the private<br />
housing sector in the rental market and to kick on the development of<br />
the community housing sector as well, that is, the public housing<br />
sector. It is a very great reform and I am very glad it was greeted as<br />
such by most newspaper editorials and by the industry. But, how it<br />
affects Victoria and these various projects is just a matter of how we do<br />
see a value in international linkages to cities like Melbourne and<br />
Sydney. In Sydney we are reserving land and a transport system to<br />
Sydney west airport from Kingsford Smith Airport. We have just spent<br />
$ 250 million on Brisbane International Terminal and in the same way<br />
we are looking at what linkages there can be from Tullamarine to the<br />
city of Melbourne. I don't see this being in any way at odds with<br />
anything the Premier wants to do in his traffic policies.<br />
J: Mr Keating, do you intend going to Singapore and Malaysia next<br />
month?<br />
PM: I have been invited to give the Singapore Lecture in Singapore which I<br />
am prone to do and currently we are seeking to put into place, we are<br />
talking to Malaysia about arrangements. I might be able to go firm<br />
about that in the next day or two.<br />
J: Mr Keating, I wonder if you would care to comment on Andrew Olle<br />
who remains in a critical condition in Sydney this afternoon?<br />
PM: Only to say as a relatively young man I am desperately sorry to see<br />
the condition he is in and I am desperately sad for his family and as<br />
someone who is well known to the community I am sure there are<br />
many Australians who think the same.<br />
J: Prime Minister, I have been talking to Aboriginal leaders in this region<br />
and they were saying that the Mabo legislation has been watered<br />
down to the extent that it will lose many of the benefits for them. </p>
<p>PM: No, it is not going to be watered down. It is going to take a while to get<br />
the claims moving and to get them up, but in the end if one can<br />
establish a custom or traditional association with the land, that is the<br />
criteria for the legislation. I don't doubt that in any of these processes,<br />
various groups will get frustrated with them, but the strength of the<br />
legislation is there and the Government is not going to be changing it.<br />
J: Prime Minister, the State Housing Ministers met in Melbourne today..<br />
( inaudible) does that place it in jeopardy?<br />
PM: I haven't heard what they have said, but I know Brian Howe came to<br />
the Cabinet with some very strong support from State Housing<br />
Ministers about it. They have been looking for a reform of this kind for<br />
many years and the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement hasn't<br />
changed really that much since 1945. It really needs this sort of<br />
change now.<br />
J: The State Housing Minister for Victoria says that the Victorian<br />
government is not prepared to pay any money because the Federal<br />
government isn't going to put in any money.<br />
PM: Well, the whole thing is that it is revenue neutral. You see, the money<br />
that Victoria would now spend on rental subsidies in public housing,<br />
they wouldn't need to spend, we would spend it. That is where the<br />
adjustment comes in. In other words, it wouldn't affect Victoria's<br />
budget and, I think, these things need to be understood. But, there<br />
would be a little bit of politics being played here by Jeffrey and the<br />
boys as well. So, you can put a big discount through most of what<br />
they say for a while.<br />
J: Mr Keating, John Howard has nominated small business incentives as<br />
the main electoral issue in Bendigo.<br />
PM: That is why he was out supporting our incentives package, our<br />
innovation package last week saying it was his own. He called it the<br />
imitation package. Of course, it was about supporting innovation in<br />
Australian business and one of the great reforms we have in there is<br />
bringing the banks into the equity position, rather than debt. That<br />
banks can actually invest in companies. You saw the company I<br />
visited here in Bendigo this morning with Joe, we went to see AUSVAC<br />
producing vaccines. Now it may be that that company through its own<br />
retained earnings has got enough capital, but if it hasn't, it would be<br />
the sort of company that the banks would actually take equity in rather<br />
than debt. That is a very novel change as is all the extension services<br />
like TradeBlazer, the reaffirmation of the 150 per cent R&amp; D<br />
concession, all these things are very much supportive of the small to<br />
medium business.<br />
J: Will the superannuation funds be invested into the housing industry? </p>
<p>PM: Well, they are now.<br />
J: More so through your program announced last week?<br />
PM: Well, we are seeking in our program the other day, to teach super fund<br />
trustees to educate them about opportunities for investment in the<br />
market and how better to get a result from their investment fund<br />
managers and there is no doubt that as we see more competition in<br />
the housing market we will see more mortgages bound up and sold<br />
into the bond market and Australian super funds will be buying them.<br />
J: Mr Keating, your forest agreement prompted quite a bit of interest in<br />
and around Bendigo, but the Box Ironbark forests which surround<br />
Bendigo weren't included in the reserve system.<br />
PM: Our view was that there is in the Box Ironbark forests which are part of<br />
the national forest estate and those on private land, that they are of<br />
sufficient size to represent a representative reserve system and that is<br />
the key point. What the government is seeking to do here in forestry is<br />
develop representative reserve systems and we are seeking these<br />
Deferred Forest Agreements, deferred forest areas and as well as that<br />
putting areas away for regional forest agreements which we'll then<br />
enter into at some couple of years down the track. Our forest<br />
statement is the biggest reservation, I'm sure, the biggest reservation<br />
of trees in Australian history. Over six million hectares of important<br />
forest and that is why, I think, it was greeted so well by serious people<br />
interested in conservation.<br />
