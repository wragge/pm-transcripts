COMM4ENDATION OF WINSTON CHURCHILL 1IMORIAL TRUST BY<br />
THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER, M R. JOHN McETJEN.<br />
( Mr McEwen is Deputy President of the Australian Committee of the)<br />
Winston Churchill Trust.<br />
" As you know the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, has annnunced that<br />
the people of Australia are to join with the people of Britain and other<br />
countries in the establishment of the Winston Chruchill Memorial Trust.<br />
The Trust will provide travelling scholarships.<br />
Australians selected from all walks of life will be given opportunities<br />
to travel overseas to improve their knowledge and experience. Those chosen<br />
for travel as Chuirchill Fellows will not only be people in the academic<br />
# orld. People engaged at all levels in industry, trade, commerce,<br />
agriculture, and the arts, will be eligible.<br />
" Sir Robert Menzies has spoken of the committees which have been<br />
established in Australia to launch a nation-wide appeal to raise V1 millinn.<br />
It is an accepted principle that the funds raised in Australia will be<br />
controlled and administered by the Australian organisation established<br />
for the purpose. We have been fortunate in securing the services of a number<br />
of distinguished Australians as members of the national committee and of the<br />
a tate committees which will conduct the drive for funds in co-operation with<br />
the Returned Soldiers League. These people along with the many thousands of<br />
voluntary workers who will take part, are giving their wholehearted support<br />
o this grand concept.<br />
11 I am sure that we wifll have the enthusiastic support of the<br />
general public.<br />
11 The Government has decided that donations made to the Fund will<br />
be deductible for taxation purposes.<br />
11 This Winston Churchill Memorial Trust will perpetuate the memory<br />
of the greatest man of our lifetime. Sir Winston made his mark in history,<br />
both in peace and war. He dedicated his life to the preservation of freedom<br />
and democratic institutions,.<br />
1By providing a continuing benefit to all sections of oar<br />
community, the Trust will be a memorial which Sir Winston Churchill would<br />
himself have approved."<br />
