    <subjects>Welcome home ceremony for HMAS Melbourne, South Australian and Tasmanian elections.</subjects>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>[<em>inaudible</em>] for Tassie and South Australia Liberals?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>I’m here today to welcome home the crew of the HMAS Melbourne. They’ve been on a long and successful deployment, they’ve intercepted about a half a tonne of drugs worth over $1 billion, they’ve apprehended pirates in the Middle Eastern area of operations so they’ve helped to keep our country safe. So that’s what I’m mostly here for.</p>
<p>Obviously I will be speaking to my colleagues in both South Australia and Tasmania later in the day. I hope that after today we’ve got governments in both those states that are committed to getting taxes down and regulation down, that are committed to getting productivity and prosperity up. Of course what we have got to do for our country is get rid of the carbon tax, get rid of the mining tax and I’m looking forward to working with state colleagues who want to bring that about.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>You have a good chance in both.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, as far as I’m aware, people are contesting this right down to the wire. Thank you.</p>
