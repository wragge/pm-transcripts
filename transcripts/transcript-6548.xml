PRIME MINISTER<br />
Fo~ r Media 9 November 1984<br />
Tasmanian Women's Information Service<br />
The Federal Government will establish a Women's<br />
Information Service in Tasmania rDext year.<br />
The Service will have a dual function.-to provide women<br />
with information about Federal Government policies,<br />
programs and services and to give the Government<br />
feedback about what women in Tasmania wamnt.<br />
The Women's Information Service of Tasmania is being<br />
established in response to the clear need for such a<br />
corvioo, ahown by the response from TaRMAni~ n wnmen tn<br />
the Federal Government's Women's Telephone Information<br />
Service. This Service operated in Hobart for eight<br />
months earlier this year under the Community Employment<br />
Program.<br />
Tasmania is the only State where women do not have an<br />
accessible information service or consultative body<br />
which responds to the ~ views and needs of women.<br />
Despite specific assurances from the Premier, Mr Robin<br />
Gray# to set up three regional women's advisory councils<br />
throughout the State# he has failed to make good his<br />
Vzum16v&amp;. He has also abolished the State's only<br />
women's advisory position, leaving women in Tasmania<br />
with less access to Government than women in any other<br />
Australian State. The lack of action from the Tasmanian<br />
Government has meant' that, women in Tasmania have often<br />
felt Isolated and powerless to make their needs known at<br />
a level where help can be effectively.. provided.<br />
The Women's Information Service Is expected to open in<br />
mid 1985. It will be located irn Hobart. A van will be<br />
provided for staff members to travel regularly to<br />
Launceston and other regiont no women throughout<br />
Tasmania can have access to the Service.<br />
The Women's Information Service will be one of two<br />
' outposts' of the Off ice of the Status of Women within<br />
the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The<br />
other service, established In April this year# is in<br />
Brisbane. </p>
