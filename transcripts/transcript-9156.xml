PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, OVERSEAS PASSENGER TERMINAL, CIRCULAR QUAY<br />
SYDNEY, 16 MARCH 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: National Accounts. Well, I think this Is a very encouraging iesult rut Ue whole<br />
country. That ithat we arc now growing faster than any western country at<br />
around 4 per cent. We have had very significant growth in the December quarter.<br />
Happily the National Accounts again rrncrding very low inflation for Australia. That<br />
isc, o mplementing the CPI and this I think Is a terribly encouraging result for the<br />
whole country.<br />
J: You must be worried about the low Investment figures though?<br />
PM: No. Investment Is picking up. What the Accounts also record Is the highest profit<br />
share in our history, that is the highest shlre or profits to GDP In our history. So.<br />
the Government said at the time of the last election it was going to restart the<br />
economy, It has done so. We said we would like to see 500,000 jobs created In<br />
three years, what the Accounts show is 200,000 In the last year. And that mandate<br />
we secured to get the place moving again Is. I think, pretty obviously being<br />
satisfied.<br />
J: But why are those Investment figuros taking so long to come through.<br />
PM: Well because companies have been re-balancing their h. lance sheets. They<br />
have been starting to get tieirconfidence back. find their mark and opportunities,<br />
build their profits up, and now I think they will start hunting.<br />
J: What message do you think today's result will send to the markets?<br />
PM: One of a growing econumy with strong exports, good employment and low<br />
Inflation. I mean it Is a very good message.<br />
J: Any need to change the budget figures at all<br />
PM: No, I dun'l think so. I think these are the kind oT growth rates that we expected to<br />
see, and the thing is they are now in evidence. r </p>
<p>J: What ramifications do these figures have on Interest rates?<br />
PM: Well, I answered that the other day. We have still got a lot of underempluyed<br />
resources. I mean, I have Just had quostions here about business Investment, We<br />
have still got a way to go to see business Investment pick up to levels which would<br />
lift those underemployed resource.; up and see them used In this country. We are<br />
not abuut to choke that off by any misplaced, utterly misplaced sort of caution.<br />
J: Mr Keating on the Macedonian issue<br />
PM: Well. I think the Australian public Is entitled to be entirely disinterested In this<br />
argument, entirely disinterested. And an aiyuierinl, by two eLhnlc groups over an<br />
ancient territory, essentially abuses the traditions of this country of tolerance and<br />
understanding, and injects into this society episodes of the kind wc have seen in<br />
the last wnok or two which this country could well do without. Now, while it may be<br />
a matter to Greeks and Yugoslav Macedonians, a matter of great moment, how the<br />
ancicnt State of Macedonia Is ieprusuited today In contemporary terms. It Is not a<br />
matter of great political interest to the Australian community, nor need it be. So, I<br />
will just say to these communities that this Is their adoptod country, they should<br />
respect its mores and traditions of tolerance and fairplay and non-violent<br />
resoluion of political and community conflict.<br />
