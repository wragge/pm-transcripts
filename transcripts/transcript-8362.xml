PRIMIEN IS4)<br />
FOR MEDIA 6 DECEMBER 1991<br />
I am pleased that President George Vassiliou of Cyprus has<br />
accepted my invitation to visit Australia and will be here<br />
from 10-18 December.<br />
I will be meeting President Vassiliou for discussions and<br />
hosting a Parliamentary lunch in his honour on 11 December.<br />
He will also meet with other Cabinet Ministers. The<br />
Governor-General will receive President Vassiliou later that<br />
day. The visit provides an opportunity to discuss the progrress of<br />
negotiations on Cyprus. Australia supports a peaceful, just<br />
and long-lasting solution, in accordance with UN Security<br />
Council Resolutions on this matter. We believe the best<br />
opportunity for achieving such a result is negotiations<br />
under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General.<br />
I also wish to discuss developments in the middle East and<br />
Europe with the President, given Cyprus's unique<br />
geographical position in relation to both those regions.<br />
President Vassiliou will hold talks with State Governments<br />
in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.<br />
Relations between our two countries have always been close,<br />
and Australia is home to many people of Cypriot origin.<br />
The visit will focus on the Cypriot community here in<br />
Australia and business links between our two countries.<br />
President Vassiliou will visit Cypriot communities in<br />
Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, and address meetings of the<br />
Melbourne chapter of Australian Business in Europe ( ABIE)<br />
and the Council for Europe in Sydney during his visit.<br />
An engagement at the National Press Club is scheduled for<br />
Friday 13 December.<br />
President Vassiliou will be accompanied by Foreign Minister<br />
George Iacovou.<br />
