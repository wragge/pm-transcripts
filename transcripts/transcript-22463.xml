    <content><![CDATA[<p>Labor's policy on collective bargaining is bad for the Australian economy because it will deny both employers and employees freedom of choice.</p>
<p>Mr Beazley's new policy would not only undo the benefits of WorkChoices but return our workplace relations system to the rigidity of the Keating era, which saw more than one million Australians out of work.</p>
<p> It is a recipe for a future reduction in the prosperity of our country.</p>
<p>It would restrict the right of Australians to run their own businesses in the way they think fit.</p>
<p>Employees would be denied the right to individually bargain if that is their wish.</p>
<p>Unions would be able to barge into workplaces even where their presence is neither wanted nor productive.</p>
<p>This latest announcement from Mr Beazley again shows that he does not understand what is needed to maintain and expand the prosperity of Australia.</p>
<p>Despite all the prophecies of gloom and disruption from Labor and the unions, 175,000 new jobs have been created since WorkChoices became law. Moreover industrial disputes are now at a record low.</p>
<p>Yet Mr Beazley would put that prosperity and stability at risk in the name of placating union bosses.</p>
