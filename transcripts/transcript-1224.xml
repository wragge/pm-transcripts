FOR PRESS P. M. No. 7/ 1966<br />
DEATH OF THE PRIE, MINISTER OF INDIA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies<br />
I have learned with shock and deep regret of the<br />
death today of Lal Bahadur Shastri, the Prime Minister of<br />
India. He took office at a testing time, having to succeed<br />
the late Jawaharlal Nehru who had been Prime Minister for a<br />
long while and had made a particular place for himself in<br />
Indian and international affairs. Lal Bahadur Shastri<br />
established himself as a leader in his own right, and in his<br />
all too brief period as Prime Minister he had to grapple with<br />
many acute problems, some involving the international relations<br />
and security of his country, and some the continued economic<br />
and social progress of India. At the time of his death he<br />
had just concluded negotiations with the President of Pakistan<br />
designed to ease the tension between the two countries and to<br />
open the way to further agreement. In domestic affairs, his<br />
government was faced with a most severe drought and the great<br />
shortage of food which had resulted.<br />
I was in touch with Lal Bahadur Shastri at various<br />
times during his term as Prime Minister, and I had the great<br />
pleasure of meeting him and working with him in London at the<br />
Commonwealth Prime MIinisters' meeting last year. I had the<br />
most cordial relations with him throughout his term. Like all<br />
the people of Australia, I deeply regret his passing and<br />
express my sympathies for his family and all the people of<br />
India.<br />
CANBERRA, 11th January, 1966. </p>
