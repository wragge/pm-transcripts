    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...........................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Joan, for those very kind and gracious words</p>
<p> of introduction. To Penny, to Judi Moylan, to Chris McDiven, to all</p>
<p> of the others, members and delegates and ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Last year I had the opportunity when I was in Washington of going</p>
<p> onto the floor of the American Senate. And I was struck immediately</p>
<p> by two comparisons with the Parliaments of Australia.</p>
<p>The first was - and I make no criticism of this, let me say - the</p>
<p> first was that the average age of the American Senate was infinitely</p>
<p> higher than the average age of either the Australian Senate or the</p>
<p> Australian House of Representatives.</p>
<p>And the second observation that really hit me was the, I have to say,</p>
<p> pitifully few number of women Senators in the American Senate. And</p>
<p> it brought home to me far more dramatically than any kind of statistical</p>
<p> comparison that you might care to make just how well Australia compares</p>
<p> and, indeed, how well Australia leads the way in the representation</p>
<p> of women in the parliaments of democratic nations. In fact, as a result</p>
<p> of the last Federal election we are now twice the world average so</p>
<p> far as parliamentary representation for women in democratic parliaments.</p>
<p>This is no modern day aberration because one of the least remarked</p>
<p> features of Australia's democratic development is that we did</p>
<p> essentially lead or help lead the rest of the world in giving the</p>
<p> vote to women and giving women preferment and advancement in public</p>
<p> political positions.</p>
<p>And it is also the case with our own party, the Liberal Party of Australia.</p>
<p> Women played a very important role from the very beginning in the</p>
<p> formation and the development of the Liberal Party of Australia. And</p>
<p> I'm immensely proud of the fact that we have chalked up so many</p>
<p> firsts.</p>
<p>We have an unparalleled level of female representation in the Federal</p>
<p> Parliament as a result of the last election. We didn't indulge</p>
<p> ourselves with streamers and kissing and hugging and dancing on the</p>
<p> floor of our national conference. Rather, we simply went about the</p>
<p> process of pre-selecting women of talent and ability and getting them</p>
<p> elected to the Federal Parliament. And nowhere is that, of course,</p>
<p> more apparent than here in the State of Queensland because the female</p>
<p> representation in the House of Representatives from the State of Queensland</p>
<p> is, I believe, a record for any State of Australia in Federal politics</p>
<p> from either side. And that occurred in the last election.</p>
<p>And we have the spectacle at the present moment, apparently, of the</p>
<p> male heavies of the Australian Labor Party trying to intimidate a</p>
<p> woman, Anne Scott, out of securing pre-selection for the Labor Party</p>
<p> for the seat of Oxley.</p>
<p>But, ladies and gentlemen, there are lots of things that I want to</p>
<p> say something about today. But the most important message I have for</p>
<p> all of you is that the Liberal Party is, firstly, immensely proud</p>
<p> of what it has achieved in the area of women's representation</p>
<p> and the advancement of women, not only within our party but also within</p>
<p> the community.</p>
<p>But we are not in the business of resting on what has been achieved.</p>
<p> As I said in the speech I gave on International Women's Day last</p>
<p> Sunday, listing the achievements of the Menzies Government and other</p>
<p> Liberal governments in introducing benefits and changes of direct</p>
<p> help to women. And it is a very long list and it is a list that goes</p>
<p> a lot further than we are often given credit for. And it includes,</p>
<p> for example, the signature of the international convention that led</p>
<p> to the creation of the very office of the Commissioner for Sex Discrimination</p>
<p> to which Penny referred to in her introductory remarks.</p>
<p>It was a Liberal government that established the first national childcare</p>
<p> office. It was a Liberal government that lifted what now seems to</p>
<p> be the quite laughable ban on married women continuing in the Federal</p>
<p> Public Service. It was a Liberal government that introduced child</p>
<p> endowment. It was a Liberal government that first recognised the rights</p>
<p> of married pensioners so far as the tax system was concerned. It was</p>
<p> a Liberal government that introduced many of the provisions for private</p>
<p> health insurance that is so important for women. And the list goes</p>
<p> on.</p>
<p>It is a list which is about building practical measures and practical</p>
<p> areas of achievement for Australian women. But, of course, it is not</p>
<p> sufficient to rest on what has been achieved. And nor should listing</p>
<p> those achievements be seen as some declaration of complacency because</p>
<p> there is still a long way to go. There is still a long way to go to</p>
<p> recognise the full participation of women within our community.</p>
<p>We are a party that treasures and values choice. We do not believe</p>
<p> in the patronising use of quotas. We do not believe in advancing certain</p>
<p> categories of women or, indeed, certain categories of men. We do not</p>
<p> define women's preferment by whether or not the woman in question</p>
<p> has a particular attitude on a specified range of subjects. Our view</p>
<p> is that all women within the Australian community, whatever their</p>
<p> views on politics or life, have a right to a quality of opportunity</p>
<p> and have a right to free choice. And that is embedded in the policies</p>
<p> that we have adopted in so many areas.</p>
<p>The world into which women are now born is, of course, radically different</p>
<p> from what it used to be. The most astonishing and profound social</p>
<p> change that has occurred in my own lifetime has, of course, been the</p>
<p> change in the role in the status of women within our modern community,</p>
<p> within the Australian community and within western society. And I</p>
<p> specify western society because sadly enough, the role and the status</p>
<p> and the position and the treatment of women in other societies is</p>
<p> often quite appalling. And one of the things that we ought to remember</p>
<p> at a conference such as this is that the women of many third world</p>
<p> countries are denied even the basic rights of physical protection</p>
<p> and sustenance that we take for granted.</p>
<p>The world has changed enormously. And I try to think of it in my own</p>
<p> personal terms of thinking of the world into which the three women</p>
<p> that have had the greatest influence on my life - my mother, my wife</p>
<p> and my daughter - of the differences of the world into which the three</p>
<p> of the were born.</p>
<p>My mother belonged to that Australian generation, a great, heroic</p>
<p> generation, that lived through two world wars and a great depression.</p>
<p> And she was a dedicated person who believed absolutely and committedly</p>
<p> in the importance of family life and the importance of playing your</p>
<p> part in a community.</p>
<p>My wife was born into a different era. I shall, of course, not specify</p>
<p> precisely which era, but a different era, a more modern contemporary</p>
<p> era in which many attitudes had changed. Not out of disrespect for</p>
<p> the attitudes of earlier years but just simply because the world does</p>
<p> change. And the opportunities for women of my wife's generation</p>
<p> were very different and they were greater and infinitely different</p>
<p> from those of my mother's generation.</p>
<p>And then again my daughter was born into a still later generation.</p>
<p> And I've often remarked that when I commenced at the Sydney University</p>
<p> Law School in 1957 there were, out of a class of about 120, there</p>
<p> were fewer than 20 women. When my daughter started 35 years later</p>
<p> in an economics/law degree at Sydney University the majority of that</p>
<p> first year were women. And that represents a dramatic illustration</p>
<p> and, might I say, a dramatic demonstration of the legacy of the Menzies</p>
<p> Government. Because it was the Menzies Government, in response to</p>
<p> the Report of the Murray Committee in the 1950s, that really laid</p>
<p> the foundation for the great post World War II expansion of higher</p>
<p> education in Australia. And when you hear our political opponents</p>
<p> waxing lyrical about the contribution that they have made to higher</p>
<p> education, we ought to remember that.</p>
<p>The world has changed. It has changed forever and it will go on changing.</p>
<p> And whenever I talk to my daughter about her future, the contemplation</p>
<p> of the changes that lie ahead of her, of course, are very much in</p>
<p> her own mind.</p>
<p>There are certain things, of course, that never change. People never</p>
<p> lose their desire to have a sense of personal and physical security.</p>
<p> And one of the things of which I am very proud that I have been able</p>
<p> to do in the time that I have been Prime Minister is to bring to the</p>
<p> people of Australia, particularly to the women of Australia, a greater</p>
<p> sense of physical security because of the uniform prohibition on semi-automatic</p>
<p> weapons.</p>
<p>Violence and the threat of violence is something that is abhorrent</p>
<p> to all of us, absolutely. And there's nothing in my view that</p>
<p> unites women's groups in Australia right across the spectrum,</p>
<p> whether they are very conservative or rather radical, than an abhorrence</p>
<p> of violence and physical violence, physical violence of any kind.</p>
<p> And the measures that my Government has taken to reduce the incidence</p>
<p> of domestic violence and to deliver that very simplistic but, nonetheless,</p>
<p> profound measure, that real men don't hit women' is</p>
<p> something that I'm very proud of also. Because violence against</p>
<p> women and children is absolutely unacceptable in a civilised society.</p>
<p> It is something that ought to be campaigned against. It ought to be</p>
<p> exposed. It ought to be treated in a sensitive fashion. It should</p>
<p> remain as it is, a crime. But there should be an approach to it that</p>
<p> allows men who see themselves as having a problem to seek proper counselling</p>
<p> and proper assistance. But there are different ways in which we can,</p>
<p> as a community, demonstrate our determination to achieve equality.</p>
<p>In the months ahead we'll be releasing a new taxation plan for</p>
<p> all of the Australian people. And that taxation plan will be scrutinised</p>
<p> just as closely by the women of Australia as it will be by the men,</p>
<p> and so it should, not only for those women, of course, a majority</p>
<p> now, by far, who are in the paid workforce, but also those who are</p>
<p> not in the paid workforce.</p>
<p>And can I endorse very strongly what Joan Sheldon had to say about</p>
<p> respecting the choices that women make in relation to the caring of</p>
<p> their dependent children. It is not the role of a government to dictate</p>
<p> a stereotype. It is not the role of a government to say that you should</p>
<p> or shouldn't be in the workforce, that both parents should or</p>
<p> shouldn't be in the workforce when children are young. That is</p>
<p> for parents to decide.</p>
<p>It is not my role as Prime Minister to say what is right or wrong</p>
<p> in relation to that. It is my role as Prime Minister to respect and</p>
<p> to support the choices which women make and men make, and to provide</p>
<p> a taxation system and a welfare system that facilitates and promotes</p>
<p> those choices.</p>
<p>There was a time some years ago when women who had young children</p>
<p> and who entered the workforce were criticised in some way, not always</p>
<p> openly but, perhaps, indirectly, for neglecting the interests of their</p>
<p> children by entering the workforce.</p>
<p>Now those days are, by and large, behind us. But we don't now</p>
<p> want to replace those outdated attitudes with a new and equally unacceptable</p>
<p> attitude from some other sections of the community who seek to almost</p>
<p> sneer at and treat as second class citizens those women who elect</p>
<p> or, indeed, those men who elect to be full-time carers for their children</p>
<p> at home.</p>
<p>Either choice is equally honourable. Either choice should be equally</p>
<p> supported. Both choices should be fully respected and that is the</p>
<p> attitude that I have always brought to these matters and that is the</p>
<p> attitude that has permeated the changes that we made after the last</p>
<p> election through the family tax initiative that delivered an additional</p>
<p>$1 billion into the hands of parents through the tax system who were</p>
<p> caring for young children.</p>
<p>And since the last election we have done a number of very important</p>
<p> things for women. Importantly, we have continued to increase the resources</p>
<p> that have been made available for childcare. There will be 83,000</p>
<p> additional childcare places made available under my Government over</p>
<p> the next four years. We are now spending more than $1 billion a year</p>
<p> in childcare assistance and that has been a real increase in each</p>
<p> of the two years that we have been in government.</p>
<p>In the area of superannuation we have dramatically expanded the opportunities</p>
<p> and made fairer the treatment of women. We have not only introduced</p>
<p> the retirement savings accounts - these are superannuation accounts</p>
<p> that literally follow workers from one job to another or, indeed,</p>
<p> in and out of the workforce. And they are ideal for the chosen life</p>
<p> patterns of many women within our community whose experience is often</p>
<p> full-time work, when a child arrives, a period of being out of the</p>
<p> workforce entirely, then followed by part-time work, then followed</p>
<p> by a return to full-time work.</p>
<p>Now, what we need with that kind of situation is an itinerant superannuation</p>
<p> package that follows you and that you don't lose the benefits</p>
<p> of it when you are temporarily out of the workforce.</p>
<p>We've also introduced an arrangement whereby it is possible to</p>
<p> obtain for the partner to the marriage who's continuing to work</p>
<p> when children are young, an opportunity to obtain what is, in effect,</p>
<p> a double taxation deduction in relation to the spouse who is at home.</p>
<p>And then last Sunday I announced, ten years after the former Labor</p>
<p> government had been told to do it, ten years after the former Labor</p>
<p> government had been told to do it, I announced that my Government</p>
<p> had begun the policy reform process that would lead to the inclusion</p>
<p> of superannuation as an item of marital property to be adjudicated</p>
<p> upon in the event of a dissolution of a marriage.</p>
<p>Now, that has been a long-outstanding area of grievance and concern</p>
<p> to many women in Australia. We all hope that marriages, when entered</p>
<p> into, will last forever but unfortunately not all of them do and we</p>
<p> need to have fair, balanced, sensible rules providing for the disposition</p>
<p> of property, particularly for that generation of women whose experience</p>
<p> in the work forces is not as great and extensive and as full as that</p>
<p> of younger women within our community. And that policy announcement</p>
<p> will be very warmly welcomed by women in their middle years, many</p>
<p> of whom have been denied the opportunity of building up any kind of</p>
<p> separate assets and have been people who, often in the past, have</p>
<p> been very unfairly treated on the dissolution of their marriages.</p>
<p>Now, it is never possible in these areas to satisfy everybody. And</p>
<p> every time we have a debate in our Party Room or in our party about</p>
<p> contentious things such as the Child Support Agency, I am reminded</p>
<p> of just how infinitely difficult it is in these situations to satisfy</p>
<p> everybody. But if you try and apply the principle of justice and equity</p>
<p> and fairness you have to recognise the inclusion of superannuation</p>
<p> is enormously important.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I have derived an enormous amount of advice</p>
<p> and support and understanding from the women members of the Federal</p>
<p> Parliamentary party. We had a very valuable and stimulating dinner</p>
<p> the other night in which I was able to get just about all of my female</p>
<p> colleagues together and to get their ideas on policy. It wasn't</p>
<p> a night spent just talking, may I say, it was not a night spent at</p>
<p> all talking about women's issues, it was a night spent talking</p>
<p> about issues that affect all of us as Australians. Issues that affect</p>
<p> the Australian community, their health, their employment opportunities,</p>
<p> the future job prospects of our children and the future development</p>
<p> of our children.</p>
<p>When we held the Constitutional Convention I remarked upon the astonishing</p>
<p> differences between the make-up of that Convention and the make-up</p>
<p> of the conventions that had put together the Constitution in 1901.</p>
<p> And the biggest single difference, of course, was that there were</p>
<p> no women at all present in the conventions of 1901. And on this occasion</p>
<p> something in the order of 35 to 40 per cent of the delegates both</p>
<p> appointed and elected to the Convention were women. And that is yet</p>
<p> another symbol and another piece of reality as well of the change</p>
<p> that has come over our society.</p>
<p>I don't set any particular target for the number of women in</p>
<p> Federal Parliament. What I do set is a target of removing remaining</p>
<p> barriers against their full participation. That is the only liberal</p>
<p> goal that you can set on something like this. We treat people on merit</p>
<p> and on quality. We don't prefer them on the basis of their gender.</p>
<p> We simply prefer them on the basis of their commitment and on the</p>
<p> basis of their ability. And I have no doubt that with that approach</p>
<p> the number of women will continue to grow.</p>
<p>I look into this audience and I think of the contribution being made</p>
<p> by Judi Moylan, the first-ever woman appointed to the position exclusively</p>
<p> of Minister for the Status of Women. I see Margaret Reid, the first</p>
<p> ever woman to be President of the Australian Senate. And I look around</p>
<p> at the tremendous contribution that so many of you have made to the</p>
<p> development of policy within the Liberal Party and to the development</p>
<p> of all that we stand for.</p>
<p>This is the first occasion of our great National Convention of 1998.</p>
<p> Joan, you are the first Treasurer anywhere in Australia. You are the</p>
<p> Deputy Premier of Queensland. You're a colleague for whom I have</p>
<p> great respect and affection and you are a colleague who will have</p>
<p> my total support in the political campaigns that lie ahead of you</p>
<p> and your colleague, Rob Borbidge, over the coming months.</p>
<p>The Coalition holds at present unprecedented levels of power and authority</p>
<p> throughout Australia, not only at a federal level but in five of the</p>
<p> six States. We therefore have an unrivalled opportunity to leave our</p>
<p> imprint, to mould and change Australian society for the better. And</p>
<p> part of that will be the aspiration that in the future our successors</p>
<p> will be able to say that the Liberals of the mid to late 1990s changed</p>
<p> Australian society to give full equality of opportunity and full ranges</p>
<p> of choices to Australian women.</p>
<p>Women have come, rightly, a long way over the last ten or twenty years.</p>
<p> There is still a distance to be travelled but it is a journey that</p>
<p> we will undertake together. It is a journey based upon proper respect</p>
<p> and understanding of the things that we all have in common but, equally,</p>
<p> the unique different contributions of men and women to a caring, understanding</p>
<p> and compassionate society.</p>
<p>Can I thank the women of the Liberal Party for what you have done</p>
<p> to deliver Federal Government to me and to my colleagues. Can I continue</p>
<p> to encourage you to give us your ideas, your thoughts, your criticisms</p>
<p> where necessary, your visions for the future. And above all, let us</p>
<p> all work as hard as we can to continue realising our great Liberal</p>
<p> goals that we all share in common.</p>
<p>I have great pleasure in declaring this conference open. Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
