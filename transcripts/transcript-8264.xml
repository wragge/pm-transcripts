FOR MEDIA MARCH 7, 1991<br />
JOINT STATEMENT WITH THE MINISTER FOR THE ARTS, TOURISM AND<br />
TERRITORIES, DAVID SIMLOIONS<br />
A major step has, been taken by the people of the Cocos<br />
( Keeling) Islands toward achieving full mainland standards and<br />
conditions of living with the signing of a Memorandum of<br />
Understanding. The Memorandum cf Understanding was signed today by the Prime<br />
Minister and representatives of Cocos ( Keeling) Community,<br />
Haji Wahin bin EBynie QAM, Chairman of the Cocos ( Keeling)<br />
Islands Council, and Parson bin Yapat OAM, Chairman of the<br />
Cocos Co-operative Society Ltd.<br />
The Memorandum of Understanding marks a significant stage in<br />
the integration of the Cocos ( Keeling) Islands with Australia.<br />
When the Cocos community voted for integration in 1984 in an<br />
United Nations Act of Self Determination, the Government gave<br />
a commitment thEat equivalent mainland standards of living<br />
would be introduced for the Cocos Islanders within 10 years.<br />
This Memorandum of Understanding now sets out the remaining<br />
measures to be taken by each of the parties towards fulfilment<br />
of that commitment. When fully implemented, the people of<br />
Cocos will have the same rights, benefits and obligations as<br />
mainland Austral. ia.<br />
The agreement affirmed by the MOU signing provides for a broad<br />
range of reforms, including major law reform, upgrading of<br />
government works and services, and the application of mainland<br />
employment conditions, taxes and assistance measures.<br />
For their part, the community has agreed to broaden the role<br />
and responsibilities of the Cocos ( Keeling) Islands Council,<br />
in line with the functions carried out by mainland local<br />
government, and to restructure the Cocos Co-operative Society<br />
along more commercial lines. </p>
<p>2.<br />
The terms of the MOU were developed from the recommendations<br />
of the Commonwealth Grants Commission's Second Report on the<br />
Cocos ( Keeling) Islands. The Government announced in August<br />
last year that it accepted most of the Commission's<br />
recommendations, following extensive consultations with the<br />
Cocos community.<br />
In setting appropriate standards for delivering services to<br />
the community, the Government has decided to adopt Western<br />
Australian models, principles and practices as far as<br />
possible. This will provide the community with an identifiable mainland<br />
model against which to measure their progress in achieving<br />
comparable mainland living conditions. </p>
