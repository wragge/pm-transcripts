PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
LAUNCH OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION KIT<br />
" WILDERNESS: THE ORIGINAL AND THE<br />
BEST OF PLANET EARTH"<br />
MELBOURNE 14 DECEMBER 1987<br />
It is my pleasure today to launch the Wilderness Society's<br />
first environmental education kit entitled " Wilderness: The<br />
original and the Best of Planet Earth".<br />
it is particularly appropriate that we launch this project<br />
today, the anniversary of the World Heritage Listing of the<br />
South West Tasmanian wilderness.<br />
That area owes its protection in considerable measure to the<br />
work of the Wilderness Society work which my Gov ernment<br />
was very pleased to cap off in thle early days after our<br />
election in 1983 with the decision to stop the dammjing of<br />
the Frankl. in-<br />
Thue Wilderness Society has been at the forefront of the<br />
conservation movement since its formation as thle " Tasmainian<br />
Wilderness Society" at Bob Brown's house in 1976.<br />
Australia has a special responsibility to follow wise<br />
environmental policies, since we have the good fortune<br />
indeed, the privilege of living in a continent of<br />
unsurpassed environmental magnificence. This education kit<br />
highlights that fact. vividly.<br />
Over the 200 years ofS Ftropean settlement Australia has seen<br />
the degradation and outright loss of some imnportant<br />
environmental areas.<br />
In more recent years however there has beeni a Vrowing<br />
awareness of the need for a more balanced approach to<br />
development, for proper environmental planning and for the<br />
protection of valuable areas of Australia's natural<br />
heritage. The Wilderness Society can claim the ctedit ( or encouraging<br />
this awareness and for ensur. ing that Governments, businesses<br />
and the wider community retain a sense of the importance to<br />
all of us of our natural heritage. 0 0 13 12 </p>
<p>The kit you have produced is another example of your<br />
capacity to spread the word about our natural treasures.<br />
For its part the Government sees as a key issue the<br />
protection of environmentally significant areas for the<br />
benefit of present and future generations of Australians<br />
while, at the same time, ensuring Australia's economic<br />
future. In determining our policies we have sought to<br />
achieve an appropriate and sensible balance between<br />
legitimate competing interests.<br />
Let me briefly mention two areas with which we are concerned<br />
at present which will further advance the cause of<br />
environmental protection.<br />
Last week the World Heritage Committee formally accepted<br />
Kakadu Stage 2 for World Heritage Listing. This will<br />
consolidate the area of Stage 1 that was included on the<br />
list in 1981. As you know the listing of Stage 2 only<br />
followed protracted but successful action by this Government<br />
in the courts.<br />
Last Friday, the Minister for the Environment and the Arts,<br />
Senator Richardson, announced the Government's decision to<br />
nominate for World Heritage listing the Wet Tropics of<br />
North-East Queensland, including the magnificent Daintree<br />
Rainforest which I visited earlier this year. The<br />
nomination will be submitted shortly and be considered by<br />
the World Heritage Committee late next year.<br />
In launching the kit I am particularly gratified to note the<br />
support the Wilderness Society has received from the Myer<br />
Foundation a fine example of co-operation in the interests<br />
of the wider community.<br />
The kit has been developed for use by secondary school<br />
teachers and students with the aim of encouraging students<br />
to think critically about environmental issues, particularly<br />
by having them consider the values and choices that are<br />
inherent in any land use debate.<br />
The colour prints and 90 slides contained in the kit are, as<br />
we shall see shortly, outstanding. They offer glimpses of<br />
scenes that should inspire anyone to make the effort to<br />
visit the real thing. The high quality printing and<br />
presentation is most impressive. I can recommend this kit<br />
to all educational institutions.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to launch<br />
" Wilderness: The Original and the Best of Planet Earth." 003426; </p>
