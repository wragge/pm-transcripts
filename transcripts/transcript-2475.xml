STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE~ RT. HON. WILLIAM MCMAHON<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
COM4MONWEALTH ASSISTANCE FOR NURSING HOME PATIENTS OCTOBER 1971<br />
For some time past now, the Government has been examining the<br />
role of nursing homes in caring for the sick aged, their financial position<br />
and the extent of Commonwealth financial assistance for all nursing<br />
home patients. over the past five years, the number of nursing home beds has<br />
increased from about 33,000 to about 47,000. There is no doubt that this<br />
has resulted in a very significant improvement in the care of the sick<br />
aged in Australia. The financial assistance provided by the Commonwealth for<br />
nursing home patients, which amounted to nearly $ 50 million in 1970/ 71,<br />
has been an important factor contributing to the growth of these homep and<br />
to the overall raising of standards of care.<br />
The assistance to be provided to those people requiring nursing<br />
home care is an extiaordinarily complex question involving consideration<br />
of the differing needs and circumstances of patients in various types of<br />
homes. These homes are run by State Governments as well as by religiogs<br />
and charitable organisations and by private proprietors.<br />
As I. have inoicated, the present arrangements relating to the<br />
care of, and assistance to, those requiring nursing home treatment have been<br />
under review for-some time. We are continuing this review with the aim of<br />
introducing new long terirt arrangements As soon as it is practicable to do<br />
so. This, of course, will include consultation with State Governments<br />
as necessary. We recognise that the recent steep increases in running costs,<br />
notably in nurses' salaries, has placed many homes in an extremely difficult<br />
financial position. Those homes relying largely on Commonwealth assistance<br />
to patients through benefits or pensions have been hit particularly hard.<br />
We have therefore decided, as 4~ n interim measure, to increase<br />
nursing home benefits to take effect as soooi as the necessary legislation<br />
is passed by Parliament and assented to.<br />
Benefits for patients receiving ordinary nursing home care will<br />
be increased from $ 2 per day to $ 3.50 per day or $ 24.50 per week. Benefits<br />
for patients receiving intensive care will be increased from $ 5 per day to<br />
$ 6.50 per day or $ 45.50 per week. The cost of these increases will be<br />
approximately $ 24 million in a full year. The cst in 1971/ 72, which will<br />
depend on the date of assent to the amending legislation to give effect to<br />
the new legislation, will be of the order of $ 12 million to $ 14 million.<br />
, This action is being taken in accordance with the Government's<br />
overall policy of assisting the sick and the aged wherever areas of need<br />
exist. Nursing home benefits are only one of the many provisions made<br />
by the Commonwealth to help aged persons, and the increase in benefits<br />
is to be seen in the context of the substantial assistance we are<br />
providing in other ways. I refer to such measures as the age pension and<br />
related payments, assistance with aged persons housing and assistance<br />
provided through our home care programme.<br />
within the limits necessarily imposed by available resources, it<br />
is the policy of the Government to improve progressively the welfare of<br />
elderly' citizens. </p>
