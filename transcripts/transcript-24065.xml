    <content><![CDATA[<p>A lot of good things have happened in 2014.</p>
<p>The boats have stopped, the carbon tax is gone, red tape is being cut, free trade agreements have been finalised and the largest roads programme ever is now underway.</p>
<p>Since the end of last year, over 160,000 new jobs have been created â and this is helping families and small businesses right around Australia.</p>
<p>But weâve also listened to the Australian people.</p>
<p>This week, we announced changes to ensure that Medicare is sustainable for the long term while also protecting the vulnerable.</p>
<p>GPs will have the option of charging those, like me, who can afford to pay up to $5.</p>
<p>But bulk billing will be protected for children under 16, for pensioners, concession card holders, veterans, and for people in nursing homes and other aged care accommodation.</p>
<p>Ten years ago Medicare was costing us $8 billion, it's now costing $20 billion. In a decade, it will be costing us some $34 billion.</p>
<p>Thatâs why the Government is acting now to protect Medicare for the long term.</p>
<p>Weâre also acting to improve child care and parental leave.</p>
<p>Australian families are doing their best to juggle work, family life and child care.</p>
<p>So weâre developing a comprehensive plan that will both deliver a parental leave scheme which really helps families as well as deliver more affordable and more accessible child care.</p>
<p>The Government is listening and itâs delivering.</p>
<p>Our policies are creating jobs, helping families and bringing the Budget back under control.</p>
<p>13 December 2014</p>
