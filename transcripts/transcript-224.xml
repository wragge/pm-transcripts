STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINTSTERRT. HON. R. G. 14ENZIES<br />
SALARIES OF FEDERAL JUDGES<br />
The Prime Minister ( Mr. Menzies) said before leaving Canberra<br />
today that the Government would introduce bills during the present<br />
sittings of Parliament to increase the salaries of the judges of the<br />
High Court and of the Federal Courts created by the Australian<br />
Parliament. Explaining the decision the Prime Minister said that the<br />
salaries of the Commonwealth judges had not been altered since 1955<br />
although since that time the salaries of other public offices for<br />
which the Commonwealth was responsible had been increased more than<br />
once. The salaries paid to State judges in New South Wales and<br />
Victoria have been increased several times since 1955, and the<br />
remuneration, including allowances, of these judges is now in every<br />
case but one, in excess of the salaries paid to the Commonwealth<br />
judiciary.. For these reasons the Commonwealth Parliament will be<br />
asked to establish proper levels of remuneration for its judges,<br />
In' New South Wales the increases made, subsequently to the<br />
Judges' Remuneration Act 1955 ( Commonwealth) were<br />

The Hligh Court is established by the Constitution. It<br />
is the suprem~ e court of the Co-mmonwecalth and the ultimate<br />
court of appeal in Australia; the new salaries are designed<br />
