    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prospective businesses will be able to apply and pay for a national business name online through a single application under a new system approved today by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG).</p>
<p>The new process has been estimated by Ernst and Young to save Australian businesses $1 billion over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>It will save businesses time and money, with the single application covering both a business name and an Australian Business Number (ABN).</p>
<p>“To register a business name nationally at present, businesses have to apply separately in eight States and Territories and pay a fee eight times at a total cost of around $900,” Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said.</p>
<p>“COAG agreed it was absurd in the 21st century for businesses to have to go through such duplicated processes.”</p>
<p>The new system will establish a one-stop online shop for businesses to interact with government.</p>
<p>The new system is one of the 27 areas of regulatory reform identified by COAG earlier in the year. It will bring Australia one step closer to a seamless national economy, as called for by the 2020 Summit and the Business Council of Australia.</p>
<p>The simple, national scheme will benefit small businesses as well as national businesses.</p>
<p>“With the internet, more and more small businesses are operating in more than one State or Territory,” Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy Craig Emerson said.</p>
<p>“The new system will be much cheaper and quicker, enabling a single registration for a single fee. </p>
<p>“Those businesses that want to register a name in a single State or Territory (such as a local café, butcher or motel) will still be able to do so within the national system.”</p>
<p>Small Business Ministers gave in-principle support to the initiative at the Small Business Ministerial Conference in Christchurch, New Zealand, in May.</p>
<p>Businesses will benefit from a national system to help them identify government support, as well as regulatory requirements across all levels of government, no matter where they are trading.</p>
<p>The new system will be established by 2011.</p>
