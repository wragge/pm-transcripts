Last year, the Federal Government was severely embarrassed when<br />
Canberra journalist Laurie Oakes released substantial detailS6 of<br />
the Budget two nights before it was delivered by the Treasurer,.<br />
Mr. Howard. The story may have passed, but it has certainly not<br />
been forgotten. Communications Minister, Ian Sinclair, was in the<br />
uncomfortable position today of having to present an award for the<br />
story and he didn't let the occasion pass without comment. Report<br />
from Simon Nasht: Ian Sinclair certainly made i t clear today just<br />
how far he and his Government colleagues took the definition of a<br />
free press. If any other Minister had been given the task of<br />
awarding Mr. Oakes the Thorn Company Award for Television News Story<br />
of the Year, they probably would have let the matter pass without<br />
too much comment. Not so a tough campaigner like Ian Sinclair.<br />
