<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, is Warren Entsch safe on the frontbench?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Warren Entsch has not done anything wrong. I've had a very careful</p>
<p> look at this. He was doing the right thing by his constituents. He</p>
<p> declared his ownership of his land both to me and to the register.</p>
<p> And if you take a common-sense approach to the conflict of interest</p>
<p> principle it doesn't arise because the possible benefit he might</p>
<p> get if a whole lot of things happen is very remote because it would</p>
<p> depend upon a whole lot of decisions being taken by a number of agencies</p>
<p> over which he's got no control. And on top of that of course</p>
<p> any gain might be, would be enjoyed in common with potentially hundreds</p>
<p> of other people in the district. I mean what the Labor Party is asking</p>
<p> us to accept is that a regional member who has an asset in the electorate</p>
<p> he represents can't argue in favour of some kind of policy change</p>
<p> by government that could potentially in the long term enhance the</p>
<p> value not only of his land but also of the land of a lot of other</p>
<p> people in that district. Now that is ridiculous and it fails the test,</p>
<p> the common-sense test. It fails the pub test. It's not reasonable.</p>
<p> It lacks commonsense.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, if people believe nonsense then you can believe anything. But</p>
<p> there is no evidence of a conflict of interest in the sense in which</p>
<p> that is properly understood, where the gain is personal and peculiar</p>
<p> to the member or to the minister. It is akin to a member making a</p>
<p> representation for say a road to go through a particular part of a</p>
<p> country town which would lead to an enhancement of property values,</p>
<p> to flood mitigation funds. What Warren was doing was addressing a</p>
<p> serious environmental problem. The possibility of that bridge being</p>
<p> built has been around for years. He didn't disguise the fact</p>
<p> that he owned the property. Heavens above he was doing his job as</p>
<p> the local member. I've had a very careful look at this and I</p>
<p> think to argue that this is in the properly understood sense of the</p>
<p> word a conflict of interest is just crazy.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But don't you think that the public would be suspicious about</p>
<p> some of these activities in talking up the development?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, they shouldn't be if they understand the facts. I mean if</p>
<p> they're not given the facts correctly anybody can be suspicious</p>
<p> of anything. But when you look at the facts Louise, he has not sought</p>
<p> to secure a personal individual gain for himself. What he did was</p>
<p> the sort of thing that any energetic local member would do. I mean</p>
<p> the environmental degradation of this land is very severe. It's</p>
<p> a problem that this land has suffered in common with land in coastal</p>
<p> areas of Australia for generations as the result of too much land</p>
<p> clearance. That's well known. The CSIRO report started I think</p>
<p> in 1995 when the former government was in office. I'm not, you</p>
<p> know, putting any special significance on that. But it had been around</p>
<p> for a long time and it wasn't unreasonable that the local people</p>
<p> should want the report released. They made approaches I understand</p>
<p> to the Queensland Labor minister responsible for either environmental</p>
<p> or development matters. Entsch had put his ownership on the register.</p>
<p> He bought this land at public auction, public auction. I mean I think</p>
<p> we are getting into the theatre of the absurd. And what you have here</p>
<p> is while we get on with governing a country reforming tax, reforming</p>
<p> environmental laws, tackling family policies, the Labor Party throws</p>
<p> mud. I mean we are into policy and reform and making Australia better</p>
<p> and stronger. The Labor Party throws mud. That is their only response.</p>
<p> They don't have a policy response to the GST, they don't</p>
<p> have a policy response on the environment. All they do is throw dirt.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can you understand that other ministers who lost there jobs though</p>
<p> might [inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I look at each thing on the individual merits Aban and that's</p>
<p> my only response to that. I don't accept that at all. On the</p>
<p> merits, and I've looked at the merits, and as you can tell I've</p>
<p> carefully examined the circumstances of this. I didn't know anything</p>
<p> about it. Why should I? I don't carry everything around in my</p>
<p> head when I was asked about it yesterday. I said I would analyse it.</p>
<p> I have analaysed it. And I don't think on a common sense application</p>
<p> of the principles of conflict of interest there's an issue. He</p>
<p> was doing his job as a local member. He was doing it openly and fairly</p>
<p> and properly as a local member. Environmental degradation is a problem</p>
<p> in coastal areas of Australia. People have known this for years. This</p>
<p> talk about the bridge has been around for years. His land ownership</p>
<p> is on the public register. I don't know what the issue is about.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, Mr Kennett has launched another broadside against the GST</p>
<p> deal today. He says it's now the Democrats' tax system,</p>
<p> not yours. That it's too costly and that governments, whatever</p>
<p> there political persuasion will alter it because it's now a complicated</p>
<p> system.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he's said all that before and I don't agree with him.</p>
<p> I think he's being negative and backward looking, but there's</p>
<p> nothing I can do about it and I'm untroubled by it because the</p>
<p> legislation is going to go through and the Australian people will</p>
<p> see the enormous benefits of tax reform. It's 85 to 90 per cent</p>
<p> of what we wanted and what he supported at the last election. So I</p>
<p> don't think his attack has any real substance and I'm quite</p>
<p> untroubled by it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Senator Harradine's just welcomed your package. How much input</p>
<p> did he have [inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he didn't have any specific input of which I am aware. But</p>
<p> you've got to remember that a lot of people have similar views</p>
<p> on a lot of aspects of family policy. And there's a strange notion</p>
<p> around this building that when anything is done in this area, if Brian</p>
<p> happens to agree with it then it was his idea. There are a number</p>
<p> of us who independently have arrived at the same conclusion on a number</p>
<p> of issues. Not all issues. I share views similar to him on a number</p>
<p> of issues, not all issues. And the same could be said of him in relation</p>
<p> to my views. There's a happy coincidence of attitude between</p>
<p> the Government and Senator Harradine on quite a number of issues.</p>
<p> And I don't make any bones about that and I don't apologise</p>
<p> for it. I'm glad he supports it. It's a good policy.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
