FOR PRESS16 DECEMBER 1976<br />
NEWCASTLE STATE DOCKYARD<br />
The Prime Minister sent the following letter by<br />
telex to the New South Wales Premier, Mr. Neville<br />
Wran, today. JO<br />
AEA. L </p>
<p>PRIME IINISTER<br />
J1Q ,76CANBERRA<br />
My dear Premier, I refer to your telex of the 12 December and<br />
to our earlier correspondence and discussions on the<br />
subject of shipbuilding.<br />
I can only say that I am unable to comprehend<br />
how you could have the view that you are not responsible<br />
to negotiate the Industrial Relations Contract with the<br />
Unions. The record of our conversation in Canberra<br />
indicates that this point was made clear. My letter to<br />
you of 12 November explicitly stated, " if your Government<br />
can succeed in negotiating a suitable contract with the<br />
Unions we would be prepared to co-operate with the State<br />
in providing further financial assistance if necessary in<br />
the construction of the two ships".<br />
Your Government, as owner of the State Dockyard,<br />
obviously must be a principal of such a contract your<br />
Government must have a direct involvement in the negotiations.<br />
May I also remind you that at our meeting on the<br />
27 August when I asked you whether you thought it would be<br />
possible to negotiate with the Unions for a moratorium on<br />
strikes and wage increases beyond those approved by the<br />
appropriate wage determining tribunals, you indicated that<br />
you would " back yourself on that brief" if you could promise<br />
work for the dockyard.<br />
However, since you believe that this responsibility<br />
did not fall on your shoulders, we are prepared, if you wish<br />
it, to agree to a small extension of time to permit you to<br />
obtain the agreement of the Unions to an Industrial Relations<br />
Contract in accordance with the Heads of Agreement, which we<br />
discussed on the 19 November. I remind you that from our point<br />
of view the Commonwealth is not prepared to vary the Industrial<br />
Relations Contract. I must comment that the Union position as you have<br />
reported it to me falls significantly short in a number of<br />
important respects of compliance with the Heads of Agreement.<br />
I now formally offer a short extension of time if<br />
you wish it to allow you to obtain the agreement of the Unions.<br />
A lot of time has elapsed. If I do not receive advice from you<br />
by tomorrow night that you wish to accept this short extension,<br />
we will be obliged to regard the offer as having lapsed.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
Thc Hon. N. ' 1' ran, P. L. A. ( Malcolm Frase<br />
Premier of Ne* z South hales </p>
