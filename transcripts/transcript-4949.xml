AUSTRALIA DAY ADDRESS TO TfM NATION<br />
Tomorrow we celebrate Australia Day our national day.<br />
For most of us, it is a great opportunity to spend a day with<br />
our families and friends, on the beach, at home, or maybe<br />
working in the garden.<br />
But wherever we are, Australia Day gives us all an opportunity<br />
to think about our country to reflect on the past, and to<br />
look to the challenges of the future.<br />
Australians have a record of great achievement. Our early settlers<br />
built a nation on a harsh continent. The courage, tenacity,<br />
independence and enterprise of those early Australians their<br />
eagerness to " give it a go", their readiness to give a bloke<br />
a hand when he was down have become part of the Australian<br />
way of life.<br />
These qualities have been the force behind Australia's<br />
development and prosperity. A development and prosperity<br />
that has been forged by people from many countries.<br />
All of us,-even Prime Ministers, face day-to-day problems,<br />
whether they be mortgage payments, household bills, or any<br />
of the other hassles which sometimes make us forget that we<br />
have in Australia people with great technical skills who can<br />
do new things; good farming land; great mineral reserves;<br />
abundant energy.<br />
Compared with many countries we are indeed fortunate. We are<br />
free of many of the problems which beset counties around the<br />
world chronic poverty, sickness and hunger, racial conflict<br />
and war.<br />
But we can't just sit back and take it all for granted. we've<br />
got responsibilities to our children to make Australia a better<br />
place for them to live in.<br />
Like many other developed countries we are faced with inflation<br />
and unemployment. But with the resources we have, with<br />
Australian drive and initiative, we will overcome them. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
We have made real progress. Australia's success is recognised<br />
here and overseas. People are now looking ahead with more<br />
confidence, with more optimism.<br />
Sometimes people say that we are too concerned with inflation,<br />
but it is because we are concerned with people that fighting<br />
inflation is important.<br />
Let's take the example of the motor industry. If there is<br />
inflation, if wages and other costs are continually going up,<br />
prices of motor cars will also have to rise. That means less*<br />
Australian cars will be sold. They will be pushed out of<br />
export markets. As fewer cars are sold, there is less work<br />
for Australians, there are fewer jobs for Australians.<br />
On the other hand, if costs are stable, waqes are steady,<br />
prices will also be steady and more Australian cars will be sold.<br />
Australian firms will do better against competitors, whose<br />
inflation might be higher, whose costs might be rising more<br />
quickly. And that means more jobs for Australians.<br />
That is what fighting inflation is all about. It is about jobs.<br />
Some nations are often regarded as important because of their<br />
power; because of victories in war; because of the cities they<br />
have built; because of their influence on world affairs, in<br />
trade and commerce.<br />
Without discounting the importance of some of these things,<br />
I much prefer to measure the greatness of the country by the<br />
quality of its people; by their character, their pride and<br />
enterprise; by the concern people show for those less fortunate.<br />
By these standards, Australia is a truly great nation. Is is<br />
people that are the strength of Australia. Men and women who<br />
have built Australia and will lead us into the 1980' s and<br />
beyond. Australia is not something remote. Australia is not just an<br />
idea. It is the 14 million people that make up this nation.<br />
Every action by every one of us is part of Australia. Whatever<br />
we do adds or detracts from Australia. When we are at work,<br />
or at play, we are a part of Australia.<br />
To me, Australia's greatness springs from its people. From you,<br />
your families, and what you do. From your willingness to<br />
" 1give it a go" for Australia. And that is why I have unbounded<br />
confidence in this nation. </p>
