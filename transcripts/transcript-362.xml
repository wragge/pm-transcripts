CO1MONWEALTH CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE COST OF<br />
COAL LOADING FACILITIES AT THREE N. S. U. PORTS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the flt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, said that he was pleased<br />
to announce that the Premier of New South Wales had accepted, on<br />
behalf of the New South qales Government, the Commonwealth's<br />
offer of financial assistance towrards the cost of installing new<br />
coal loading facilities at the ports of Newcastle, Port Hembla<br />
and Balmain. As the Commonwealth Treasurer mentioned in his<br />
Budget Speech, there are good prospects of a substantial<br />
increase in coal exports from New South aes, but these<br />
prospects will be enhanced if improvements are made to existing<br />
port facilities for handling coal.<br />
The New South Hales Government has undertaken to ensure<br />
that its programme of work on these three harbours, estimated to<br />
cost some œ 10 million over about three years, is carried out with<br />
the maximum possible expedition, and that the funds necessary for<br />
this purpose will be provided as required.<br />
The Commonwealth has agreed to provide financial<br />
assistance to Now South dales in respect of the provision of coal<br />
loading plant and equipment ( including wharfage, storage and<br />
associated rail facilities, but excluding the provision of deep<br />
water berths) at Newcastle, Port Kembla and Balmain. This<br />
assistance will be provided on a for matching expenditure<br />
basis with the State and will be up to individual maximum<br />
amounts of œ 1,500 000 at Newcastle, œ 1,070,000 at Port Kembla,<br />
and œ 80,000 at Balmain.<br />
Of the total Commonwealth contribution of up to<br />
i2,650,000, an amount of up to œ 1 million will be by way of grant<br />
and will be provided from the Coal Industry Fund held by the<br />
Joint Coal Board. The credit balance in this Fund arose as a<br />
result of the Board's activities using moneys provided by the<br />
Commonwealth. It has been agreed that the remaining Commonwealth<br />
assistance of up to œ 1,650,000 will be provided by way of<br />
advances, each of wiich will be wholly repayable, together with<br />
interest at per cent, by the State within ten years from the<br />
date on which each advance will be made. Repayments by the State<br />
to the Commonwealth will not be subject to any sinking fund<br />
contribution by the Commonwealth.<br />
Having regard to the uncertainties concerning the<br />
volume of coal trade that will develop and the costs of handling<br />
it, the Commonwealth decided to make part of its assistance by<br />
way of grant. This grant element will be applied to reduce the<br />
coal loading charges that would otherwise be levied for the use<br />
of the new facilities at the three ports.<br />
The Prime Minister said he was satisfied that both the<br />
Governments have good reason to be confident that the new<br />
handling facilities will stimulate the development of our coal<br />
export trade. Not only will the prospective improvement in this<br />
trade benefit the workers in our coalfields, but the additional<br />
export income will be of significance to the whole economy.<br />
