VISIT TO NEW GUINEA 1970<br />
LAE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCILS<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton 9 JULY 1970<br />
Opening remarks not recorded....... and one part of the Territory can<br />
help another. As roads go inland from a town like Lae, the town is helped by that<br />
road and the country opened up by that road is also helped. It is mutual assistance.<br />
So I hope the Territory will progress as a unit the coastal areas, the highlands<br />
and the islands. Clearly this Territory is on the road to self-government and at the end<br />
of the road which it is now travelling, self-government will be attained. Thereis<br />
no turning back on this road. It must be progressed step by step, but at the same<br />
time it is not for the Australian Government to dictate to the people of the<br />
Territory the speed at which they must travel along that road,<br />
So I think it quite wrong to say that at a given year 1972 or 3 or 4 or<br />
any given year, the Australian Government will impose on the people of the Territory<br />
self-government whether they want it or whether they don't. And as long as I am<br />
Prime Minister, we will not seek to impose our will on the people of the Territory<br />
in that way. But at the same time, if and when the time comes, as ultimately it will,<br />
when the people of the Territory themselves, the majority of the people say they<br />
wish complete ' nternal self-government, then at that time they will get it because<br />
we do not wish to help to administer and govern a country against the wishes of<br />
the majority of its people. And we wouldn't do it, ary more than we would get<br />
out and stop helping to govern a country against the wishes of the majority of the<br />
people in it. Having said that, I now want to refer to the new steps which have been<br />
taken along the road which I have described steps which were announced in<br />
Port Moresby a few days ago. There is going to be a transfer of power for decisionmaking<br />
from Canberra to the Administrator's Executive Council and with this<br />
transfer, the House of Assembly will achieve powers additional to those it now has.<br />
In future, money for the recurrent expenses of the services in the Territory and<br />
money for minor works will be negotited as to amounts between the Australian<br />
Government and the Administ ration in the Territory So there will be available<br />
for these purposes, the sums raised inside the Territory fo: which the House of<br />
Assembly will decide the taxation rates, the amounts raised inside the Territory<br />
together with that amount negotiated as a recurrent grant from Australia. It will<br />
then be for the Administrator's Executive Council to apportion between the<br />
Departments the sums of money to be spent for those purposes. And in carrying<br />
out this work, in carrying out this apportionment, the official members of the<br />
Administrator's Council will be present, will give their advice, will give the<br />
benefit of their experience, but will not vote on the decisions made by the rest of<br />
the Administrator's Executive Council.<br />
And in those fields which are handed over to this area of decision by<br />
Ministerial Members, the Australian Government will not exercise its power of<br />
veto over ordinances passed by the House of Assembly provided they fall<br />
within this area. / 2 </p>
<p>I think this represents a quite significant transfer of authority to the<br />
Ministerial Members and to the House of Assembly, and I believe it is essential<br />
that the House of Assembly, the Ministerial Members and the people of the<br />
Territory fully realise that as authority is transferred, so is responsibility<br />
transferred, and as authority is increased so does the need for self help and<br />
provision to carry out programmes from internal sources.<br />
This does not mean that there will be a cessation in any way of Australian<br />
aid. I believe that in the future of this Territory for a long time ahead, there is<br />
going to be a need for that Australian advice, that Australian experience, that<br />
AustraLian help which has brought the Territory so far in the last twenty years.<br />
There will also be a need for Australian capital which will enable the Territory<br />
to develop as it has in that time.<br />
And so to finish because I would like to give some time for questions<br />
and for discussion to sum it up the Territory is the road to selfgovernment.<br />
It will be best for all parts of the Territory if that road were travelled<br />
as a unit. Australian help in that travelling will continue, bt there will be from<br />
time to time additional authority provided for the people of the Territory, yet noone<br />
can say at what particular date complete self-goverrnment should come, because<br />
it should only come if the majority of the people in the Territory wish it.<br />
There is very much to do for the future of this country and I express the<br />
strong hope that that will be done by a partnership of the coastal people, of the<br />
highlanders and the people from the islands, of people whether they come from<br />
New Guinea or Papua or from Australia, and that working in harmony to build and<br />
to achieve, we will be able to give this country the economic base which must be<br />
there for full political stability and that we can avoid any divisions which will<br />
hamper the task which together can be so well done.<br />
That is all except for a wish I have to congratulate the Members of the<br />
Local Councils upon the work which they are doing which is so significant to the<br />
people of this Territory and to wish them well in the future. Thank you.<br />
In answer to a question about investment, Mr. Gorton said:-<br />
We think the Papua/ New Guinea Territory r-eeds investment for development<br />
just as Australia needs investment for development. WVe would like to see as<br />
much of the equity in the new development held by the local people, if it is possible.<br />
At this stage it seems quite unlikely that a significant amount of such<br />
investment could be bought from the savings of the local people and that is one of<br />
the reasons why we are setting up a-n investment corporat:. io which can buy equity<br />
in new enterprises or expanding enterprises and retain that equity for the good of<br />
the people of the Territory until the time comes when it can be sold to the<br />
individual people of the Territory.<br />
So we believe investment is needed. We believe the Australian Government<br />
should retain control over the size and form of overseas investment because the<br />
country can be subjugated economically if we don't, but we impose it under that<br />
control and we would wish to see as much of it as possible either immediately,<br />
which is unlikely, or in future retained for ownership of the New Guinea people, the<br />
Territory people. I think that is about all I have to say on that subject but, as you<br />
know, 20 per cent of the new development in Bougainville was bought by the<br />
Administration for the good of the New Guinea people. </p>
