TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PRIME MINSTR AT SAIIGRI-LA<br />
OTrEL FOLLOWING HErI WITH PREMIER L PEMG, DZIJXIM,<br />
23/ 6/ 93<br />
PH:: Well, I had, I think, a very good meeting with<br />
Premier Li Pen where I thought I was given a<br />
generous welcome where, in the opening of the<br />
meeting he paid substantial compliments to<br />
Australia. I think they regard us as a big and<br />
important player in this part of the world.<br />
He began the meetiny then talking about the first<br />
specific subject about the prospects of the Chinese<br />
economy, its growth and how Australia should be a<br />
participant in its growth and then he paid a<br />
substantial tribute to our raw materials industry<br />
and gave projections about the growth of the Chinese<br />
steel industry and said that he expected Australia<br />
would be a participant in Its growth ae a<br />
substantial, efficient, reliable, raw materials<br />
supplier. So we had come discussion about their economic<br />
growth, about their primdry industries such as steel<br />
and then I went on to mae the point that though we<br />
pride ourselves on being an efficient producer of<br />
raw materials, that we also are now a significant<br />
developer of products of innovative producte and now<br />
a significant exporter and that we could play a role<br />
in China beyond raw materials supply to such things<br />
as telecommunications and computer sciences,<br />
environmental technologies etcetera. At this point<br />
he positively recognised and said that he knew about<br />
our technological vupacitles and that therefore he<br />
thought this was, you know, sensible. As China grew<br />
we would grow with them not only in raw materials<br />
but also in these other areas.<br />
We then went on to have a general discussion about<br />
the world in general, the state of growth, where the<br />
industrial nations are lining up and the<br />
conversation then drifted around to AP&amp; C. </p>
<p>TEL: 25. Jun. 93 9: 16 No. 004 P. 02/ 05<br />
-2-<br />
And I think we both agreed on the prospects that<br />
APEC holds for accelerating growth and trade in this<br />
part uf the world bearing in mind that the ambient<br />
ulimate is one of lower growth in Japan, Western<br />
Europe and North America. And that we should take<br />
the opportunities or muvilg APEC ahead as a vehicle<br />
for accelerating growth and increasing the velocity<br />
of trade.<br />
He then cQnfirmed to me what he had written to me<br />
and that is China's interest in APEC and in a<br />
leaders meeting. He said that we still had some<br />
arrengements to put together. He was not, he made<br />
no reference to the prospect of President Clinton<br />
holding or hosting such a meeting this year which of<br />
vuurue, as I have indicated to you, rvmains only<br />
something which has been mooted and not decided but<br />
gave a positive indication that they would see a<br />
leaders' meeting having the prospect of bringing<br />
political authority to APEC.<br />
He said that he would uee vu" Cureign ministries<br />
continuing to discuss the position of Taiwan and<br />
Hong Kong though he made the point that he regarded<br />
it as natural for countries with an economic<br />
interest and econumic reldtlons with Taiwan and Hong<br />
Kong to see themselves represented in those<br />
economies at economic ministerial level.<br />
The conversation then went around to the GATT and<br />
thelr application for membership. I said we<br />
supported their application for memLbrship of the<br />
GATT; that lower tariffs and transparency in trade<br />
would not only help China but would help the rest of<br />
us; and it would help them in ways which may not le<br />
obvious now but if they were to become a mainstream<br />
economy thkn they have to be in the mainstream world<br />
trading bodies and GATT is primary amongst them.<br />
I then as we then moved towarda the tall of the<br />
meeting which went for about Just a little over an<br />
hour I then said that Australia had maintained<br />
Its interest in human rights issues and we<br />
appreciated them receiving human rights delegations<br />
in 1991 and 1992 and because we in Australia believe<br />
that this medium of having viesits by groups in<br />
respeQt of human rights is a good one to maintain<br />
some discussion on this issue. I invited Premier<br />
Li Peng to send a delegation to look at these issues<br />
in Australia to see how we ourselves operate as a<br />
society which I think leaves Australia the option<br />
then of continuing a dialogue on human rights in<br />
these terms. V" S </p>
<p>TEL: -3-<br />
Now, finally, I also invited i'remier Li Pang to send<br />
a ministerial delegation to Australia leading a<br />
group of representatives of their industries to look<br />
at opportunities for further collaborative business<br />
together in all of the areas raw materials and<br />
most particularly in manufactures and services<br />
and hc thanked me for that invitation.<br />
Our meeting concluded with him making light of the<br />
fact that we were friendly rivals for the_ 0lympic<br />
bids and that China would be making every financial<br />
effort to support its bid and I said well these will<br />
) je decided on the technical merits of the bids arnd<br />
we always, think we do well there. He said yes,<br />
well out of the sort at, out of the ring I think the<br />
word he used, of harder Issues, this is something<br />
which we can remain friendly rivals onl.<br />
J: What was his response on the human rights question?<br />
PM; He appreciated that invitation, I think, which means<br />
that they wish to continue that dialogue.<br />
J3: Prime Minister, at the beginning of the meeting we<br />
did hear him mention a word that our relationship<br />
had somne misconceptions in the past. What was the<br />
weight of those comnt?..<br />
PM1; Well, veil there was no elaboration of that but I am<br />
sure that refers to our atLitude to what happened<br />
here in 1989. But I think, I mean, the Chinese are<br />
players for the long run and they regard I'm sure my<br />
visit here as a further episode in the long run<br />
relationship with Australia. And of course they<br />
welcome that.<br />
J3: Is it youz4 view that he will go along with an APEC<br />
tsumuit. at which Taiwan and Hong gong are<br />
represented, Is thdt the sense you get at the end<br />
of it.<br />
PM: Well he, they have irt Vms~ L allowed Taipel, they've<br />
out at a table with Taiwan and nong Kong<br />
representing as they do economies and the whole<br />
question of leaders versus heads of government is<br />
that there may be In uome way a person who is oth~ er<br />
than a head of government, that is a leader, maybik<br />
an -economic minister, could again in some<br />
construction sit and represent these economieS. But<br />
this was a matter he thought our foreign ministries<br />
should continue to work on, That is, he ~ I think,<br />
takeBs the view that APEC and any leaders' meeting<br />
which is part of it has to be set up properly.<br />

-4<br />
And this is the point I think I've made to you that<br />
this is a matter the timing of this, in a sense,<br />
doesn't matter providing that we get around to<br />
making the best of it. And this may be accelerated<br />
in the event that the united States President wished<br />
to accelerate it in whc. h uase we would have to<br />
think about it more. But, agalin, more naturally it<br />
would occur later.<br />
J: Any discussion of regional security and the U3<br />
presence in the western Pacific?<br />
PM; Not really no, except I said that I thought it was<br />
important to keep the United States very much<br />
involved in North and south East Asia. To pull<br />
both sides of the Pacific together which I thought<br />
APEC could do in an economic sense and of course<br />
where the economics goes, where the investment and<br />
trade goes also does go the United States' other<br />
interests including strategic interests.<br />
J: Did you raise the question of Improved sales of<br />
Australian wool to China specifically.<br />
PM: No I didn't but I have ralsed it with Vice-Minister<br />
Madam Wu Yi and I said that there may some prospect<br />
of Australia developing with china virtually a new<br />
segment of the world garment industry. That is,<br />
they are a manufacturer of garments but there is not<br />
really a world industry of low priced woollen<br />
garments and that there maty be oome prospect of us<br />
being able to do that given the fact that we have a<br />
substantial sto; kplle of wool. But again anything<br />
Australia does would have to be such as to proteut<br />
its existing market for wool in China at the prices<br />
we currently obtain.<br />
J: Did he endorse the braLder regional liberalisation<br />
ugenda you have been pushing on APEC.<br />
PM: Very much so. I think they see growth in the<br />
northern hemisphere, the prospects of it being as we<br />
see it the low growth and he made the point since<br />
the cold war has finished there has been a lot of<br />
difficulty in regional economies and in regions of<br />
the world and he talked about Bosnia Herzegovina<br />
and talked about the CIS amongst them and Somalia<br />
as indications of the fact that once the bipolarity<br />
of the cold war has sort of been lifted these other<br />
tensions and strains had become more apparent.<br />
He also referred, we reCerred briefly to the changed<br />
political situation in Japan and the seeming splits </p>
<p>TEL: 25. Jun. 93 9: 16 No. 004<br />
4 within the Liberal Democratic Party as not being a<br />
god portent for growth from that economy for the<br />
moment. All the more reason therefore why APEC can<br />
play a, can give clarity and focus on to growth and<br />
trade liberalisatio~ n in what is, as he himself<br />
described, the fastest growing part of the world.<br />
J; There are reports in Australia or theG budget deficit<br />
coming in one billion under expectations does this<br />
mean that next year's similarly will be targeted at<br />
fifteen rather than sixteen billion dollars.<br />
PM: Well, I'm not here to discuss budgetary issues in<br />
Australia. -The Treasurer made some comments about<br />
this some time ago saying that he thought that we<br />
wouldi bring next year's Duaget In somewhere around<br />
this year. But I think when he sai ' d that our<br />
estimates of revenue were less than they are now in<br />
reality. So, I don't think that in those terms he<br />
wus talking about an outcome better than the sixteen<br />
billion he originally forecast.<br />
ends. </p>
