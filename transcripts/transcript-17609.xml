As everyday Australians show their compassion and determination by pulling together to help Queenslanders affected by the devastating floods, Australian businesses have answered the call as well.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister today announced the Australian Government will immediately establish a Business Taskforce to support Queenslanders in the immediate recovery effort.</p>
<p>The Business Taskforce will bring together ten Australian business leaders from a range of industries to mobilise business efforts across Australia.</p>
<p>The focus will be on:</p>
<p> * 	Leveraging corporate donations of dollars<br />
 * 	Helping drive and coordinate in-kind donations<br />
 * 	Using Australia's best business expertise to help with business recovery and rebuilding efforts in Queensland.</p>
<p>The Taskforce will be chaired by the Federal Treasurer and will meet with the Prime Minister for the first time next week.</p>
<p>The support pouring in from across Australia for people affected by the Queensland floods has been amazing  -  but Queensland is going to need much, much more in the coming months.</p>
<p>It is important to ensure that business support is marshaled effectively to ensure it gets to the areas and people who need it most, as well as to make sure that the resources being provided are useful and appropriate. </p>
<p>The Taskforce will be established for three months initially, with its ongoing operation to be reviewed at that time.</p>
<p>The Taskforce will play no role in directing government funding or managing the government's response to the floods disaster. Instead, it will play the important role of helping to drive the involvement of a key sector of Australia in supporting Queensland at this difficult time.</p>
