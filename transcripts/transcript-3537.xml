PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 406<br />
9 December 1974<br />
Industries Assistance Commission Report<br />
Polyester and Polyamide Yarns<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today announced<br />
the Government's decision on the report of the Industries<br />
Assistance Commission on polyester and polyamide yarns.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the Governme nt accepted the<br />
long-term level of assistance of 15% for raw and processed<br />
yarns as recommended by the Commission but because of<br />
problems presently being experienced by the industry it hadbeen<br />
decided to introduce as from today tariff quotas on a<br />
short-term basis subject to certain undertakings being given<br />
by local manufacturers. The Government had decided not to accept a<br />
supplementary recommendation received from the Industries<br />
Assistance Commission for an increase in tariff levels from<br />
to 20% for 1.2 months as it considered this rate alone<br />
would provide insufficient short-term protection for the<br />
industry. The present criteria-for granting by-law admission<br />
of yarns will continue to apply and thus normal by-law<br />
admission of yarns will not generally be granted.<br />
The Minister for Manufacturing Industry will have<br />
responsibility for the policy aspects of the admini~ tration<br />
of the tariff quotas and will announce details of the quotas<br />
and other administrative arrangements in the immediate<br />
future.<br />
