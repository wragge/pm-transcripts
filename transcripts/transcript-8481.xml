ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P , J KEATING, MP<br />
1991 NATIONAL LANDCARE AWARDS, GREAT HALL, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
CANBERRA MARCH 1992<br />
Thank you very much. It gives me great pleasure to be here.<br />
This Landoere program is the product of the irresistible<br />
force of common sense.<br />
It is an example of what can happen when groups when<br />
partnerships are forged in the national interest.<br />
The average Australian would probably tell you that the ACF<br />
and the national Farmers Federation were sworn enemies.<br />
Not so. They have come together in the interests of the<br />
country, formned a partnership of real strength.<br />
That's why I say it gives mes great pleasure to be here tt<br />
a ceremony where people who have made the national interest<br />
theLir conumon interest, receive acknowledgement.<br />
At another function recently I spoke about the way in which<br />
the first,-Europeans to paint Australia painted it in the<br />
image of the~ ir own countries.<br />
It took a century of experience for the vision of the<br />
Heidelberg school to emerge end with it, in the paintings of<br />
Roberts and Streeton and others, en image of Australia which<br />
could only he Australia.<br />
The significant point is that the scenes they painted were<br />
those of Eurpgean occtipation they were populated with<br />
Europeans, their animals, their work, their architecture,<br />
their values.<br />
They were scenes of European Australians making this country<br />
in their own image exploiting its resources and altering<br />
the landscape to suit their needs and fancies. </p>

This produced wealth and comfort and gave us an enviable<br />
standard of living. It also produced terrible damage to the<br />
original environment and gave us problems which threaten<br />
to umdo-rminn those achievements.<br />
Before the New Right cry foul and call me an enemy of<br />
progress and a defiler of the memory of the pioneers, let me<br />
say that we are not about saying mea culpa we are about<br />
rectifying the mistakes and finding new and better ways to<br />
go forward.<br />
We know better these days and we've got to build on that<br />
knowledge. Like the painters of the 1890s we now have a clearer vision.<br />
We know we cannot literally do what we like with the land.<br />
We can't make it alien to the prevailing environmental and<br />
climatic conditions.<br />
We can't put it outside the boundaries of ecological and<br />
economic sustainability.<br />
We must set about restoring the land, rebuilding its<br />
productive capacity, and its sustainability, and returning<br />
it to a state of ecological resilience.<br />
I have never been one who subscribes to the theory that<br />
economics and environmental protection don't mix; the theory<br />
that it is matter of jobs versus the environment, green<br />
growth versus economic growth.<br />
We do not need to lower our environmental standards to gost<br />
greater production and greater economic growth.<br />
It is not a case of us being unable to afford to protect the<br />
environment. In truth, we can't afford to degrade it.<br />
This is crystal clear in the case of land degradation:<br />
0soil erosion,<br />
6salinisation as a result of tree clearing, irrigation<br />
and unsustainably heavy grazing,<br />
so8i1 acidification,<br />
* and changes in vegetation species in rangelands<br />
these have all cost us dearly, and continue to do so.<br />
Land degradation has Cost Australia billions of dollars in<br />
lost production, and ruined millions of acres of land.<br />
The environmental losses have been economic losses. The<br />
environmental costs have been environmental costs. And for<br />
some time now, the environmental imperatives have become<br />
economic imperatives. TEL: </p>

So allow me to say with pride that the nine-year strong<br />
Labor Government has been the first to develop a<br />
comprehensive policy to tackle this problem, and it is doing<br />
so with significant success.<br />
Landcare has been a central part of this success. It is<br />
exciting, not merely because of its style, its broad base<br />
and its concept, but because of its results.<br />
And it is not a static program.<br />
It had a suitably co-operative, partnership-oriented<br />
beginning. It began with a joint approach to the Federal<br />
Government by the National Farmers' Federation and the<br />
Australian Conservation Foundation.<br />
The National Decade of Landcare Plan has been developed to<br />
provide a framework for action to achieve sustainable land<br />
use and rehabilitate degraded lands.<br />
Concern has been expressed that there were problems for<br />
Landcare groups in getting access to Landcare grants<br />
programs. So my Ministers Simon Crean and Ros Kelly worked in<br />
partnership to introduce simplified grants program<br />
arrangements. And instead of having to approach a large range of<br />
Commonwealth agencies handling such programs as the National<br />
Soil Conservation Program, Save the Bush and One Billion<br />
Trees, groups can now get advice from a single location and<br />
fill in one form for one, community-based assessment<br />
process. In the early 1980s, there were no Landcare groups. Now,<br />
there are more than 900. By 1995, there is likely to be<br />
another 300.<br />
They are getting involved in a range of activities, and now<br />
recognising that they need to think beyond simple issues,<br />
and consider overall land use in an integrated way.<br />
This trend to integrated management of our vital natural<br />
resources is recognised in the growth of catchment groups.<br />
In the Landcare scheme we have something very Australian<br />
partnership, protecting something very Australian our land<br />
something economically and ecologically vital, something<br />
centred on Government engagement and community spirit.<br />
That all appeals to me greatly, and we all owe those<br />
involved a hearty thanks.<br />
To the members of the Landeare groups throughout Australia,<br />
I say that you are all winners. You can't lose doing what<br />
you are doing. </p>

In a sense, the winners of the 1991 National Landcare<br />
Australia Awards are representing all the other winners<br />
throughout the rural communities of Australia.<br />
I hope the award winners here tonight, and other Landcarers,<br />
get great encouragement and incentive from these awards, and<br />
I congratulate them all for their achievements. Australia is<br />
the richer for them.<br />
Thank you. </p>
