PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER RT. HO. L. MEZIS,<br />
AT CANBERRA ON THURSDAY, 9TH TULY,_ 99 AT<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think perhaps the best thing for me to do is<br />
just to talk a little bit about the various matters that<br />
I have had to look at in the course of my journey. If<br />
I show any signs of going to sleep half way through, will<br />
you give me a nudge? I have averaged about 3 hours a<br />
night sleep for the last eight days when I visited the<br />
tropics. Theie was no conference this year of a formal kind<br />
but by the time I got back home I had had talks qui'le<br />
extensive talks with, I think, ten heads of Government.<br />
I saw Mr. Nash at some length in Auckland; Mr. Diefenbaker<br />
and his Cabinet in Ottawa; I saw -the President<br />
and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Herter in Washington; I had talks<br />
with the World Bank in Washington; and with the International<br />
Monetary Fund Mr. Jacobsson, the head of the<br />
I. M. F. in Washington. I had some discussions in New York<br />
with our financial agents there. And then of course,<br />
Mr. MacMillan and his Cabinet-Chancellor Adenauer-<br />
President De Gaulle-the new prime Minister of Holland<br />
Mr. De Quay; and wiih the Foreign Minister of Holland In<br />
Zurich. Then I saw the new President of Pakistan in<br />
Karachi President Ayub. I had some very long and<br />
interesting conversations with Mr. Nehru in Delhi; and<br />
then I saw the new Prime Minister and some of his senior<br />
ministers in Singapore. So it was a pretty good roundthe-<br />
world survey of problems and discussions with them.<br />
I think before getting on to the political aspects<br />
of the journey it was a very absorbing journey. I<br />
didntt have well, I almest had no private spare time.<br />
But that was well compensated for by the fact that I had<br />
some tremendously interesting talks with. leading people.<br />
In Washington I'll come back to these other large<br />
problems I had discussions with Mr. Black of the World<br />
Bank, and with some of his senior executives, about Mt.<br />
Isa, and I also saw Mr. Jacobsson of the International<br />
Monetary Fund who told me that he could be quoted as<br />
saying that he found the discussions that we had very<br />
interesting. I asked him two things: One, whether the<br />
annual consultations with the fund by countries with<br />
balance of payments problems that applies to a great<br />
number of countries, of course including our own<br />
might take place this time in ALstraiia. And I am<br />
hopeful that that will happen. I also invited him to<br />
come out here himself.<br />
QUESTION: That is in this coming September?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes well it is some time later this year.<br />
I thought it would be a good idea if he came out<br />
himself. He said he would likeftol he accepted it in<br />
principle, but it is a matter of time-table with him.<br />
. My business with the World Bank had, of course,<br />
particular relation to the Mt. Isa railway project. It<br />
is quite true that in any projected borrowing from the<br />
World Bank, the borrower would be the Commonwealth of<br />
Australia. But the World Bank is a bank for reconstruction<br />
and development, and it is not merely a matter<br />
of lending money and feeling sure that it will get it<br />
back. No question of that arises. The real question is:<br />
If it makes a loan is that loan assisting scme piece of<br />
positive economic levelopmentY And therefore it has<br />
been particularly concerned to know what contract or </p>
<p>arrangement would be made between the Queensland<br />
Government and the Mt. Isi company. I have, from time<br />
to time explained to both of thorn what the principles<br />
of the sank are and the k~ ind of problem that has to be<br />
met. But I have had a feeling for some time that it<br />
would be of very great advantage if the Queensland<br />
Government anu the company talked around the table with<br />
the Bank, so that they both would not have to rely on<br />
what I had to say about it. They could be informed<br />
themselves on the sprit and discuss it on -the spot.<br />
So I had two objectives in my discussions there.<br />
One was to find ouic whether the World Bank was interested<br />
in the Mt. Isa project; whether it thought that in the<br />
broad it was a good one; and whether it would like to<br />
be associated with it in some way. Of course, unless<br />
those questions could be answered in the affirmative,<br />
all other discussion would be academic.<br />
It became quite clear that the answer was " yes" to<br />
all those questions. They are interested in the project<br />
and they think that it is a good one, looking at it<br />
broadly and I am sure that they would like to be<br />
associaied with it. But they have their owm financial<br />
principles which they have applied to other countries<br />
and other prospective borrowers, and which they would,<br />
therefore, need to apply to us with respect to that<br />
matter. The second question was whether, there having been<br />
some breakdown in negotiations, the positiLon of the Bank<br />
was completely inflexible. And it became clear that that<br />
was not so; there was some room for manou-', i; e But it<br />
would involve of course, some movement on the part of<br />
the company, in particular -and incidentally of the<br />
Queensland Government.<br />
So I said " lVery well, under these circumstances,<br />
will you be satisfied if I invited, through my colleagues<br />
at home, the Queensland Government and the company to be<br />
represented, in the one case by their Treasurer, and in<br />
the other case by the Managing Director of Mt. Isa<br />
Mr. Fisher and to suggest that they come to Washington?"<br />
They agreed to that very willingly.<br />
I was not there when the discussions occurred<br />
but there were some discussions, which apparently did not<br />
achieve finality. I do not regard the matter as<br />
necessarily concluded by those discussions. It is a<br />
matter which I will have to take with my Treasury<br />
colleagues. There are very great difficulties about it<br />
there always have been but I still think there is some<br />
room for accommodation.<br />
I was very fascinated when I arrived in London to<br />
be told in the press that as I got aboard the plane at<br />
Idlewild, I said I was very optimistic about a loan. I<br />
have no need to tell you that I did not see any pressmen<br />
at Id2lewild. I had no statement whatever-to make about<br />
a loan, nor would I be such a fool as to prejudice<br />
discussions with the Bank by making any statement that<br />
looked cheerful about it because it is a difficult<br />
matter. Nobody knows behter than I do about the Bank and<br />
its methods. We have had a good deal of succex with them. </p>
<p>QUESTION: It was reported out here, Mr. Menzies, that the Bank had<br />
imposed impossible conditions on the company, Would it<br />
be possible for you to say a little bit on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I do not think so, I do not think anything is<br />
gained by that. 1 did not see that, but I imnagine that<br />
what that means is that the company would not be<br />
prepared to go so far as the Bank thought it ought to go<br />
for the making of a loan. But you must forgive me for<br />
not offering any opinions on those matters because I have<br />
yet to see the detailed reports of their discussions in<br />
Washington.<br />
QUESTION: Did the limiting of lead a. nd zinc 1lt fcL: a j them<br />
at all?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I do not think that had anything to do vit it.<br />
I have not heard anything that would suggest that that<br />
was a factor.<br />
The whole problem there is how far the cccnpany is<br />
prepared to go in guaranteeing revenues to a reconstructed<br />
railway line which would amortize the cost of<br />
the railway line the bulk of which was tc be found by<br />
borrowing, partly from the Bank and partly. perhaps.<br />
on the market in the United States. But ih is all<br />
matter of how far one is prepared to go ane n~ ow far th,<br />
other is prepared to go. Apparently tLey Sid n~ ot reach<br />
a composition. I did not, for one moment,. thi. nk it was<br />
easy; but I am sure their discussions wil kave value<br />
because each now understands the otheris peint of view<br />
at first hand.<br />
QUESTION: Before you leave that subject, did you also inite the<br />
World Bank to hold their next meeting here?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. That question did not arise.<br />
So that that proble~ m as between ourselves and<br />
Queensland and the company is still unresolved, But I<br />
myself do not regard a composition as being impossible,<br />
provided that all the people concerned are prepared to<br />
exhibit an accommodating mind.<br />
But one must under the position of the Bini, because<br />
it has many clients in many countries many appl~ icants<br />
in many countries. It just cannot, off-hand, apply a<br />
generous rule to us which it refuses to apply to perhaps<br />
three or four other countries. And therefore it is a<br />
matter for very close, sensible discussion.<br />
However, I will be taking that up witt my colleague,<br />
the Treasurer, and I will be informed, because 1 know<br />
that while I have been away there have been discussions<br />
between Mr. Hiley from Queensland and my oi-nm people.<br />
Well, naturally I have had no opportunity o'f discovering<br />
the details of Lhose matters,.<br />
QUESTION: Does the success or failure of~ the World Fank ! can m~ ean<br />
the end of the whole question?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I do not know. But it vould be veoy useful to get<br />
a loan from the World Bank,. It is always a useful thing<br />
for us in Australia not being entioely flu&amp;~ with<br />
capital ourselves to be able to bring irn capital from<br />
outside. Therefore, a World Bank loan or a. Wll~ J Street<br />
loan, or whatever it may be, has considerable national<br />
advantages, not only in supplying capital bu~ t in helping<br />
on the balance of payments side of the problem. </p>
<p>QUESTION: In your discussions with the World Bank and our own<br />
financial people in New York, did you raise the possibility<br />
of further loans from the World Bank on a general<br />
basis for Australia this year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I did not, because you have to remember that<br />
the World Bank has made us loans on a pretty general<br />
basis to a very large extent 300,000,000 dollars<br />
and I think the position of the Bank today is that in<br />
future it does not exclude the possibility of further<br />
loans, but it would like to have them related to a<br />
project, which is the rule they have always applied,<br />
or almost always applied, in their lending policy. And<br />
this is a project which has great merits great<br />
attractiveness but economically, from their point of<br />
view the essential thing is: Can we be sure that the<br />
development of the mine and the development of production<br />
and the increase in export earnings by the production<br />
of additional material, will be matc~ hed by some undertakings<br />
which will make the railway proposal which<br />
represents about: 30, O00,000 successful?; So that the<br />
railway will be rebuilt and in due course paid for.<br />
The two things balanco and that is intelligible.<br />
However, I do not want to go into the details of<br />
that matter, because they have had their discussions.<br />
They have not arrived at a composition on this matter,<br />
but as I say I will know more about that and what<br />
the possibilities are, from our point of view, when I<br />
have seen the details of their discussions; I haven't<br />
yet.<br />
QUESTION: Has the Bank suggested at any time, Sir, that this is<br />
the sort of project we ought to finance for ou' selves,<br />
and that our priority for borrowing has slipped down<br />
compared with other countries who are on their list?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. The Bank is genuinely interested in this.<br />
It feels that it is the kind of thing that fits into the<br />
Bank pattern; but it is not prepared and I do not<br />
criticise it at all to make any substantial abandonment<br />
of its general rules. We are not its onl~ y customer.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think, Sir, the Bank would be more interested in<br />
a less ambitious construction programme?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I have heard a rumour in the last twelve<br />
hours or so that there is some less ambitious programme.<br />
But that is all I know it is a mere rumiour to me,<br />
so I prefer not to discuss it. But it was not the size<br />
of the project that was the point of disagreement as far<br />
as the Bank was concerrv'd,. It was how far the contract<br />
between the Queensland Government and the company would<br />
be satisfactory to it as a lender of the money.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, when you say there is room for some movement by<br />
the parties, is there room for any movement in the<br />
Commonwealth's attitude<br />
PRIME MINISTER: My dear fellow, we have worked like slaves on this.<br />
COMMENT: I know, Sir.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I cannot think of a solitary thing that we have<br />
not done that we could do. I myself have put in an<br />
immense amount of time on it. We are not open to<br />
criticism on that point.<br />
QUESTION: No. The point I was thinking of Sir, one of the Mt.<br />
Isa company's conditions is partly that they have to </p>
<p>bear most , f the guarantees for the lineo In fact,<br />
a part of the line will not be c .: 1y devoted, or even<br />
a majority devoted, to their use.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I understand that. I understand their case on that.<br />
But from the point of view of the International Bank,<br />
what it says is that where some work is to be done<br />
primarily at the request of the major user not the<br />
sole user, but a major user then the major user ought<br />
to be prepared to make a contract with . he State<br />
Government or whatever the authority may be, in order to<br />
look after the amortization of the cost. Well, that is<br />
the Bank's rule; it is not my rule; that is the Bank's<br />
rule. That is one of the facts of life.<br />
QUESTION: It is quite clear frot wbhat you say, Mr. Menzies, that<br />
the idea of approaching the Bank for thi. s loan has not<br />
been abandoned?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Not by me no; nor, I hope, by anyoe else.<br />
Well, then going back to these other perhaps<br />
larger international matters, I was very interested<br />
indeed to have talks i erica and in England and on<br />
the Continent. , lthough I gather there are one or two<br />
people still surviving in Australia who thilik that the<br />
problems of Europe and th3, We.,; tern world are irrelevant<br />
to Australia most of us will recall t _ at oir own wars<br />
have come out of Europe in the past and Europe still<br />
remains a point of danger for us. Aid these are,<br />
therefore, very gra.-e matters f'or Australian con. siderati½. t<br />
Well, I am not a spokesman for the President of the<br />
United States he can do that himself. ] u4 I must say<br />
that I found him in good health and vigour. I thought<br />
he looked better and sounded better than T have found<br />
him f-r perhaps three cr four years. He vras quite<br />
vigorous. But, as you know, he has been reluctant to<br />
have a Summit Conference unless there is some earnest<br />
of success some progress made by the Foreign Ministers<br />
at Geneva. They are, Ielieve, resuming on the 13th<br />
four days? time. Or some guarantee of some<br />
kind that there will be a result. That is his view.<br />
He does not as I understand it reject the idea of a<br />
Summit Conference in principle. Indeed, the interesting<br />
thing to me is that there is no rejection of a Summit<br />
Conference in principle in either Washington or Bonn<br />
or Paris or London none. But in Washington and in<br />
Bonn and in Paris, they attach conditions to it and say.<br />
" Well what is going to be discussed, I want to see<br />
what he agenda will be. I want to know what it is that<br />
is to be discussed." And in the case of the President.<br />
I think he goes further than that and says, " And I want<br />
some guarantee of good faith. so to speak. i want to<br />
see a prospect of a result."<br />
I think, that in the United States, m, impression<br />
was that the feeling is growing that there will be a<br />
Summit Conference. I am not saying that that is the<br />
President's view; but that is my feeling and I had a<br />
number of discussions,<br />
I was at great pains to emphasise one thing in my<br />
conversations all of them and that was that the<br />
Geneva Conference, even if nothing came out of it in<br />
form, could not be regarded as a failure, Because the<br />
proposals that were being put were honest proposals;<br />
they were not selfish proposals. They did not involve<br />
some material gain for the powers putting tnem forward.<br />
But they were designed to ease the tension; produce </p>
<p>peace and a settlement. And I thought that when the<br />
world had the spectacle of proposals of that kind being<br />
put up day after day and explained carefully day after<br />
day, then the effect of that in the world was not<br />
inconsiderable. I took the opportunity in each of these places<br />
of pointing out that while nobody may need to be<br />
persuaded about those matters in the United States or in<br />
Great Britain or in France, let's say, there are hundreds<br />
of millions of people in the world who are not in any of<br />
those places we are pretty close to a fair number of<br />
them who are not committed either to the Communists or<br />
to the West. They are, in effect uncommitted countries.<br />
And the effect upon their judgment of proposals of an<br />
honest kind honestly advocated was, I thought, very<br />
considerable, and that we in Australia were greatly<br />
influenced by that consideration. And I think that<br />
that point registered itself.<br />
I elaborated that particularly to Mr. Herter<br />
whom I have never met before. I knew Foster Dulles, of<br />
course, very well. Mr. Herter himself is a man of great<br />
personal attraction. He is a tall man; he is a man<br />
with a rather winning personality if I might use that<br />
expression; he is obviously intelligenc and I think<br />
that Herter will personally make a good seal of ground<br />
with the people that he negotiates with.<br />
I was chiefly concerned to tell him that in the<br />
opinion of one not very important onlooker I thought<br />
that he was doing a good piece of work, ana that the<br />
effect of this on the minds of people would be very great<br />
always remembering that this ideological battle or<br />
whatever we care to call it is a contest for minds.<br />
Therefore whatever influences people's minds can never<br />
be regarded as a failure.<br />
I do not know what is going to happen in this<br />
renewed conference, but I would not, myself, despair of<br />
something. They are not going to settle the problem of<br />
the re-unification of Germany; I do not think that<br />
anybody believes that that is a proble'm w~ hich can be<br />
solved this year or next year or the year after. Nor<br />
will anybody decide that fascinating and attractive<br />
legal arguments that are taking place about the<br />
foundation the legal foundation of the occupation of<br />
Berlin these are arguments that do not seem to me to<br />
be very material because there is no judge, no jury<br />
just have your fun and adjourn.<br />
I told Chancellor Adenauer tha~ t it was I asked<br />
him whether he had seen the reports of Liberace in the<br />
" Mirror" in London and hie said he had, and I said, " Well,<br />
there you are, you see suppose there were no judge and<br />
no jury, how long coull they go on having the most<br />
marvellous fun with no decision." And I think that in.<br />
reality what the prac-tical point of Geneva will be and<br />
I hope they will do something about it a working<br />
arrangement about Berlin for the next five years or ten<br />
years, or something of that kind that will take the<br />
tension out of the atmosphere and will allow these other<br />
matters to be looked at in a quiet way.<br />
I had long discussions in London, of course, with<br />
Mr. MacMillan. I attended a Cabinet meeting. I did<br />
gather from somebody that I had been promoted to be an<br />
emissary from the British Government, but; I am sorry I<br />
cannot claim that dignity, because I had already arranged<br />
to go to Bonn and to go to Paris, and both heads of </p>
<p>Government had ': een extraordinarily accommodating in<br />
giving me a date and plenty of time for discussion;<br />
just in the same way I always desired to come back via<br />
the Eastern route and, if possible, look in at Karachi,<br />
New Delhi and S--ngapore.<br />
But, at any rate, of course I did have a pretty<br />
clear picture in my mind of how Lhe United Kingdom<br />
Government was looking at these matters; that was<br />
helpful to me.<br />
I did not go to Bonn to persuade the Chancellor of<br />
something. I was rather fortunate in that I had been<br />
there three years before and had established very good<br />
personal relations with Chancellor Adenauer, so that he<br />
greeted me as a friend. I think perhaps I was able to<br />
do a little good there, because I found that he was as<br />
I thought seriously misinformed about British public<br />
opinion. A lot of these statements of his that you read<br />
are founded upon a belief that he has that there is an<br />
acute anti-German feeling in Great Britain and in the<br />
British Government; and I do not believe that is true.<br />
I had some amusing discussions with him in the<br />
course of demonstrating, as I hoped, that it was not<br />
true. I had about five hours with him altogether. I<br />
thought it was pretty handsome, considering that he had<br />
a few local disturbances on his hands. But it was a<br />
very good discussion. We discussed the European<br />
Common Market and the little free trade area, for<br />
example. I felt anxious lest the little free trade areathat<br />
is the seven, the division of Europe into the seven<br />
and the six might become inveterate and produce an<br />
economically divided Europe which as I said quite freely<br />
on the Continent, was no good to Lhem. No good to the<br />
six they do an awful lot of business with the seven.<br />
I am satisfied that so far as Chancell., r Adenauer<br />
is concerned, heowould like to see a composition between<br />
the seven and the six. He does not contemplate with any<br />
satisfaction any permanent division.<br />
I discussed that with General De Gaulle who, I think,<br />
agrees with that in principle, but is inclined t6 think<br />
that a longer period of time must elapse before effective<br />
negotiations between the two can be carried on.<br />
It is a very interesting thing to an r4bserver<br />
two years ago, France was the weak * spot in the Common<br />
Market. France was, economically, the problem child.<br />
There is no doubt that today France is becoming one of<br />
the most powerful factors in the European Common Mar'ket<br />
due to the immense prestige of General De Gaulle, And<br />
he has restored French pride and the recovery of France<br />
economically in the la st 18 months is really quite<br />
remarkable, and it goes on.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, on the sixes and the sevens, what is Great Britain's<br />
view at the moment? Is she likely to be interested?<br />
She has been more or less responsible for six being-. oreated.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, it is an ill business to speak on behalf of<br />
any Government other than your own, and it is not always<br />
possible to speak on behalf of your own. But I think<br />
it can be taken definitely that Great Britain is not<br />
regarding the formation of the seven as a definitive act,<br />
but as something from which you can advance to<br />
discussions with the six. That, I am sure, is the<br />
received view in Great Britain, And it is a view which<br />
I myself took every opportunity of advocating. </p>
<p>8.<br />
It is quite true that in the event of such<br />
discussions, countries like Australia have important<br />
reasons to be heard consulted to be in on the formalation<br />
of any proposals. I discussed that matter also<br />
in Great Britain, and there is no doubt about it that<br />
that is fully recognised that in the event of any<br />
such discussions we will be in on the grass roots. They<br />
will, first of all discuss with us our mutual in respect<br />
to any of these mazters, and indeed we have established<br />
some machinery for doing that on the official level in<br />
the first instance.<br />
But the interesting thing, rally, is not that<br />
Germany which was tremendously powerful still is, of<br />
course but outstandingly powerful economically two or<br />
three years ago-it is not that Germany does not want to<br />
have these discusions, because I am sure it does, but<br />
that France is gaining in strength. And I think that<br />
President De Gaulle feels that he needs some time yet<br />
to consolidate that position before committing his<br />
country to discussions of a further kind.<br />
It is an active problem it is not a dead problem.<br />
It is quite active and I think that minds, though they<br />
may be travelling at different paces, are really<br />
travelling in the same direction on it; but I am rather<br />
optimistic there. Of course, it would be a very good<br />
thing to have this settled, because there are always<br />
some little mutual suspicions, fears, apprehensions<br />
between one country and another, and it is a good thing<br />
to have them cleared up.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, there has been some mention of the fact that West<br />
Germany might like to export more private capital. There<br />
113as been a suggestion that they would like to have a<br />
double taxation agreement with Australia to make -Uhat<br />
possible.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I had no discussions about that. You have to<br />
remember that I was not there on specific matters of<br />
that kind. I was really there to get so far as I could<br />
inside the minds of the Chancellor in Germany and the<br />
President in France, and I had ample opportunity of<br />
doing that, because they were extrao-rdina. rily forthcoming<br />
and put their cards on the table.<br />
I must say that Adenauer, though he is 83, is<br />
remarkably active. I did not see any sign of any.<br />
failing. He~ is a very shrewd man but, I -think, a little<br />
adversely affected by his conceptions, gainaed from the<br />
" Daily Mirror" and the " Sunday Express" no doubt,<br />
of what British public opinion is that is the British<br />
" Daily Mirror". And they do not represent British<br />
public opinion and certainly do not represent British<br />
Government opinion on that matter.<br />
MacMillan himself stands very well with Adenauer<br />
who has a great respect for him, as has Do Gaulle. I<br />
had not seen De Gaulle since the war, and I saw big<br />
changes in him. He is a man today of a mellow kind.<br />
Nobody could have called him mellow during the war. We<br />
exchanged jokes that was something and he was very<br />
frank and forthcoming and relaxed. He feels justly<br />
proud of what he has been able to do for his country,<br />
and no longer frustrated, There he is and I think that<br />
his country has a great confidence in him.<br />
QUESTION: QDUoE SIyOoNu: think he is right in his stand on the atom bombs? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: Don't ask me to off~ er an opinion of' his views on<br />
that matter. There is a good deal going on about atom<br />
bombs, and somebody is rnow going to have a non-nuclear<br />
club no, I would sooner say nothing about. I have<br />
a few ideas but I would sooner say nothing about it.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think that Mr. MacMillan's trip to Moscow has<br />
given him a greater faith in the Russians than li had?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh no, I would not say that. I thought it was a<br />
very good visit to pay and I think that hie has learnt<br />
something about them at first hand. But you must not<br />
suppose that MacMillan is easily beguiled by people.<br />
He is not; he is a very shrewd man. Bu," I think he<br />
learnt a great deal, and after all the whole advantage<br />
of a suromit talk-provided it is not too formal;<br />
provided people d~ on't get it surrounded by brass bands<br />
and myriads of officials; the great advantage of a<br />
summit talk is that a few men sit dowm together<br />
don't hurry themselves, get to know each other, to<br />
know what it is all about because nothing will<br />
persuade me that either Moscow or any capital in the Western<br />
World wants a war or contemplates one. So there is<br />
a good deal of this sort of thing going on, you see,<br />
and there is nothing like a personal meeting.<br />
I have had some very interesting side lights on<br />
Kruschev from various of these people that I have met<br />
ar'ound the world who know him, and it turns out he is<br />
like the rest of us sometimes he is in a good mood and<br />
sometimes he is not; sometimes he is expansive and<br />
sometimes he is not. Well if people would only sit<br />
down and have quiet, friendly talks and get to know each<br />
other, we would get somewhere.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, on your return to London, did you have fresh<br />
discussions with Mr. MacMillan and his colleagues on the<br />
outcome of your talks in Bonn and Paris?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I did not see the Cabinet again, but I spoke to<br />
Mr. MacMillan on the phone and then I sent him a fairly<br />
full report of my observations in both Bonn and Paris<br />
particularly on what I thought to be their points of<br />
misapprehension of' British attitudes and his own, and<br />
he was good enough to say he found this extremely<br />
helpful. I had a talk with him an hour the day<br />
before I left London; but that was of a more general<br />
kind. But he is-* in possession of the relevant matters<br />
that I felt were worth recording as a result of' each<br />
journey.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think the NATO Alliance has been affected at all,<br />
Sir, by this quibbling over who should have nuclear bombs<br />
and who should not?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, I don't think so. There is always a little<br />
bit of propaganda floating around, you know. I think<br />
that, basically, NATO is quite firm and good. President<br />
De Gaulle may, occasionally, laave some wry remark to make<br />
about nuclear weapons and France; but he is a realist.<br />
Ile knows that NATO is important.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, which would be the major obstacle in the amalgamation<br />
of six and seven the exclusion of agricultural<br />
surpluses or French fear of British industrial<br />
competition? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: It is very hard to tell, because they have not<br />
got down to bralss tacks on that. I think that<br />
agricultural self-sufficiency in the Common Market Area<br />
is a very consi -derable factor very considerable. You<br />
see, Germany buys wheat from France at about twice the<br />
price that she would have to pay us for wheat. There is<br />
a good deal of this agricultural self-sufficiency. As<br />
against that, you have to bear in mind that the countries<br />
of the Comimon Market conduct the bulk of their export<br />
trade with other European countries, and therefore they<br />
cannot be indifferent to what happens in those countries<br />
or what affects the competitive capacity of those<br />
countries or the industria. strength and purchasing power<br />
of those countries.<br />
I think I had better push on a bit, because otherwise<br />
we might be here until I am you know. i<br />
I went over to Hclland to have a look at the new<br />
Prime Minister there who is comparatively new to politics<br />
De Quay. He is a very nice man; indeed, I got on very<br />
we] ll with him. He was a Professor of Psychology.<br />
QUESTION: What is wrong with that, Sir?<br />
PRIME MIINISTER: Very good. I told him there were two of us,( Eaughter'<br />
He was the Queen's Commissioner for Brabant for<br />
about ten or eleven years the big province of Brabant<br />
But he is very good. He had quite practical considerations<br />
of concern. You may remember that we were<br />
speculating a little when hts Tredecessor went out of<br />
office as Prime Minister, as to whether there might. be<br />
a change of policy in the Netherlands with respect to<br />
West New Guinea. There will not be. He said, " We will<br />
carry on completely the policy of our predecessor ." 1<br />
I notice that there has been a little flutter on<br />
the water about my talks with Luns, which I had for some<br />
hours in Zurich. Well, there is no foundation for that.<br />
What had happened was when this matter was debated in our<br />
own Parliament after Subandrio's visit, I made a speech<br />
with some care and at some leng-th, and they had had a<br />
copy of that. And, in substance, having found. that they<br />
had read this and considered it with some care, I said,<br />
" Well, that stands as a statement; there is no change<br />
from that speech." And I think they were content with<br />
that. Certainly, we had no disputes or no wrangles,<br />
and certainly there has been no change in our policy<br />
since I enunciated the policy with some care in the<br />
Parliament here no change of any kind.<br />
I wanted to see the new President of Pakistan,<br />
Pakistan has had a lot of fluctuations with Government,<br />
as you know, ever since the Aga Aly Khan who was a very<br />
distinguished man. And ncw they have a President and<br />
Government containing a certain percentage of military<br />
people, and therefore some have been disposed to believe<br />
that it is some sort of a military Gover.= ent, I don't<br />
think that is true, President Ayub himself is a very<br />
impressive man and a very civilised perscn very good.<br />
And his idea is that when they get things straightened<br />
up they will go he hopes in two years' time to<br />
elections and establish a parliamentary system of<br />
government, and let the generals go back to their<br />
soldiering; and I think he means that.~ I met two or<br />
three of his ministers who Ithought, were pretty good,<br />
I am not saying that the o~ hers were not, but I met two<br />
or three who were very impressive. </p>
<p>11.<br />
One of the great things there, of course, is the<br />
projected agreement about the Indus Waters to which we<br />
are contributing an agreement negotiate. d by Black of<br />
the Internaticnal Bank tremendously important. With<br />
it, West Pakistan has some proper chance of being<br />
economically liable, and without it, it lives precariously<br />
from year to year. I think it is the big gest material<br />
matter of dispute between Pakistan and India. I am not<br />
omitting Kashmir. Kashmir is not purely a material<br />
matter of dispute. It involves all sorts of other<br />
considerations and passions. But in an economic sense,<br />
this has been the big thing and it looks as if it is<br />
going to be cleared up and a number of us will contribute<br />
to the cost nf it. And I am hoping that it will modify<br />
feeling of hostility, shall we say, or suspicion on both<br />
sides of the frontier. I hope it does, because at the<br />
present time, of course, as you know, both India and<br />
Pakistan are spending the bulk more than 50 per cent.,<br />
up to 60 per cent. of their total budget on defence,<br />
and the effect of this in low standard of living<br />
countries with an awful lot of development work to be<br />
done can be imagined. So that this will not only have<br />
an immediate economic benefit for Pakistan, but it will<br />
have an indirect economic benefit for both Pakistan and<br />
India if it reduces the tension and enables them to<br />
devote a somewhat bigger portion of their revenues to<br />
economic affairs.<br />
QUESTION: Did you get any impression, Sir, of better relations<br />
between the two?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, I would not care to say that, found 7.<br />
both sides a feeling of satisfaction about this waters<br />
agreement, and I am sure that will lead to better<br />
relations. But, of course, these are two fascinating countries<br />
because in Karachi you can go and ask a senior officiala<br />
very influential man in Karachi about some<br />
corresponding fellow in New Delhi, and he says " Oh, he's<br />
a great friend of mine; we were in the ' uld Indian Civil<br />
Service together." And-the same way in New Delhi an<br />
awful lot of crossed lines here which are lines of a<br />
friendly kind.<br />
QUESTION: ( Question inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh ncw, that is a very speculative question. That<br />
is so hypothetical, I think you ought to withdraw it,<br />
It is a very dangerous thing answering hypothetical<br />
questions. I saw Mr. Nehru. I was in New Delhi for about<br />
three days and I saw him each day for some hours. We<br />
had long discussions. He, of course, has had a good<br />
deal of preoccupation first about Tibet and then about<br />
Kerrawa. But I must say I found him extraordinarily<br />
forthcoming and he is friendly. We had the most<br />
interesting, frank, comfortable disuuss~ ons on all sorts<br />
of things, in the course of which he was able, of course,<br />
to throw a good deal of light on dark places for me<br />
because he was able to give me a pretty good account of<br />
the Tibet problems and the departure of the Dalai Lama,<br />
and also, of course, some sort of picture of what goes<br />
on inside Communist China because he has representation<br />
there. I think he has haA a few exchanges with<br />
Communist China about some of the Tibet inMcidents, </p>
<p>But everything he said to me or. those matters, of<br />
course, I amr not able to repeat, but I found it<br />
tremendously illuminating.<br />
QUE~ STION: Did he expreass a desire to visit Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, we had a little discussion about that. He<br />
knows that when he can come we would be delighted. But<br />
he is a victim of the time-table too, because it is not<br />
very easy for him to get away except at some particular<br />
time of the year which may not be the best here. But I<br />
told him anyhow to chew it over and if he saw.. a chance<br />
whatever time of year it was we would be very glad to<br />
have him. It would be something of a break for him too,<br />
because hie carries a most enormous responsibility<br />
enormous.<br />
QUESTION: Does that discussion suggest, Sir, that it might be<br />
worthwhile if we had representation in Communist China,<br />
like England.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have no comment on that. There is nothing freshi<br />
to be said on that.<br />
Well, finally, there was Singapore where I met<br />
Mr. Lee, the new Prime Minister, and well I think most<br />
of his ministers. I had a long talk with him and then<br />
I talked with him and some of his mini. sters, and then<br />
I had dinner with all of them at night. They are a very<br />
young government; their average age is 37 He himself<br />
is 36. He is a man of high educational qualifications.<br />
He was a double first at Cambridge and achieved a<br />
very high reputation in the law in Singapore and<br />
thereabouts before judges who were competent to exnress<br />
an opinion. He is a man of ability, He has some<br />
tremendous problems.<br />
I am perfectly certain he is not a man who will<br />
lean towards the Communists. I think, on the other hand,<br />
on the contrary, he regards them as one of his p~ rob" Lems.<br />
But the island has a population of 1 500,000. Its<br />
population is rising at the rate of O, 0O a year. It has<br />
got 25,000 people added to what they call -the force<br />
every year and a small island with, I suppose, no real<br />
possibilities of agricultural developmenz. or something of<br />
that kind, and therefore it must develop industries, and<br />
to develop industries it must attract capital. Well,<br />
he is a socialist, but when I was there, I read the whole<br />
of his election pamphlets, for example, -to inform my ovdm<br />
mind, and also the speeches he has been making lately,<br />
And I think he is doing his best to establish that if<br />
anybody does invest money there, it will be all right;<br />
private enterprise will be recognised, I do not know;<br />
I am not preaching his case for him. But he is a<br />
seriously minded man and he knows his responsibility;<br />
he knows that he has got a great problem~ i. employing<br />
his people. He has 6 per cent. of iuiemployed now and on<br />
figures that I have just mentioned, that figure is<br />
likely to rise.<br />
He is, of course,, very keen on secu:? ing the joining<br />
up with the Federation with Malaya. What his prospects<br />
are of that, well; your guess is as good as mine. I<br />
think that he feels that if that could be achieved, the<br />
population could then become more flexible. It could<br />
move into the rest of the Malayan Peninsula, and he would<br />
be free of this concentrated problem in one very small<br />
area, </p>
<p>13.<br />
But I liked him. I found him very intelligent and<br />
I liked the ministers with whom I talked his Health<br />
Minister and his Minister of Finance, and really it is<br />
very illuminating to find that you can have very much<br />
the same kind of conversatizn with that type of minister<br />
as you would in your own country with your own people<br />
similar problems.<br />
But I think it ought to'be assumed that this<br />
Government in Singapore is honest and is going to do its<br />
best to produce good government,, Certainly, everybo<br />
who is in a position to judge assured me that they were<br />
personally incorruptible; that they were completely<br />
honest people who were going to do a job. Lid so I<br />
said to them, " Good luck, we regard your getting selfgovernment<br />
as * an achievement which is in the line ;-f<br />
modern British colonial policy, and the people have<br />
chosen you, and good luck to you. If we can ever be<br />
co-operative, let us know."<br />
QUESTION: SirI because he hMs this big unemployment problem, I<br />
take it there is no desire on their part t. o kick the<br />
naval base out?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I do not know. The naval base provides,<br />
directly or indirectly, sustenance for 70,000 people.<br />
So it is a big factor that is men, women and children,<br />
70,000 people. But I did not ask him w~ l. t his<br />
prognosis was about the base., Naturall. y, in these<br />
meetings you are primarily concerned to establish some<br />
friendly relations so that in future he can xwrr-Lte to me<br />
or I can write to him about probl~ ems a. s they arise.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, do you intend to say anything about the Governor-.<br />
0 General today?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I had two discussions with the Queen. We<br />
passed in review a variety of names. There are always<br />
two things about names: One, whether tbe-qre<br />
0 satisfactory and the other is whether they are available,<br />
which is a very different matter. And I said finally,<br />
" Well, Ma'am as this matter can be solved in September<br />
when you get back from Canada, there is no hurry about<br />
it. I will write to you." But we are familiar with<br />
each other's minds on that matter. That is all,<br />
QUESTION: Did you discuss future Royal Visits, Sir, particularly<br />
one for the Empire Games in Perth?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I had some discussions, but there is nothing that<br />
can be said about it at present,<br />
With the compliments of-<br />
Hugh Dash,<br />
Press Secretary to the Prime Minister,<br />
CANBERRA. </p>
