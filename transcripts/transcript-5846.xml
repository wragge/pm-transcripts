PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 27 JUNE 1982<br />
CAIN GOVERNMENT TACTICS -A NEW POLITICAL LOW<br />
The Cain Labor Government's threat to discriminate against the<br />
people of three Federal Minister's electorates by reducing<br />
their health services is a new political low in Australia.<br />
Never before have the people of an electorate had their lives<br />
and well-being directly threatened in this way. It is a form<br />
of political gangsterism which Australians will not stand for.<br />
Compared with its base tax-sharing gra-nt last year, Victoria<br />
got a 16.8% increase this year. How much is enough for Mr CairL?<br />
The Cain Labor Government is also the beneficiary of an extra<br />
million of untied grants and borrowing authorities negotiated<br />
last year by the previous Liberal Government. These are funds<br />
available to Victoria alone, but Mr Cain has not mentioned them.<br />
The kind of threats now coming from the Victorian Goverrnent<br />
against people in particular electorates are not good enough<br />
for the conduct of relations between the States and the<br />
Commonwealth. We all know that these are the tactics of the<br />
Socialist Left. We all know that these are the tactics of<br />
the B. L. F. Wle all know that this is why the B. L. F. has earned<br />
the antagonism of nearly every citizen in this State. Mr<br />
Cain is in effect threatening to penalize the people of particular<br />
electorates if the. Members representing those electorates<br />
don't do exactly what Mr Cain wants. He won't get away with<br />
it. The people of Victoria will rebel at the first opportunity.<br />
