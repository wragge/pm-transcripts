TO MR ALEXANDER DUBCEK, PRESIDENT OF THE<br />
FEDERAL ASSEMBLY OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA<br />
MELBOURNE APRIL 28 1991<br />
Alexander Dubcek,<br />
Isi. Leibler<br />
Members of the Institute<br />
Friends Tonight we lie honoured by the presence of a man who, in his<br />
life and in his work, reflects the great struggle of our<br />
Century the struggle against tyranny and suppression of<br />
the: human spirit.<br />
His presence here among us tonight exemplifies three things:<br />
his own victory after a long and hard struggle against<br />
dictatorship; the victory of his country, whose turbulent history has<br />
been so tragically typical of this Century and its<br />
problems; and<br />
the huge international changes in which his struggle,<br />
and the struggle of his nation, have played a decisive<br />
part.<br />
Alexander Dubcek is a man who embodies the enduring<br />
commitment of his people to freedom; who represents the<br />
triumphant emergence, after decades of repression, of free<br />
democracies throughout Eastern Europe; and who personifies<br />
the resolute determination of principled individuals to<br />
achieve the victory of the human spirit over the powerful<br />
forces of authoritarianism.<br />
Tonight, by presenting him with the Australian Institute of<br />
Jewish Affairs' human rights award, we honour Alexander<br />
Dubcek: leader of the Prague Spring of 1968; symbol of the<br />
humiliation and repression that followed for two decades;<br />
and inspiration for the peaceful revolution that has built a<br />
new and democratic government.<br />
6 7 1. </p>
<p>I had the honour ofl receiving this award in 1988, an<br />
occasion I remember vividly, because of the spirit of hope<br />
and optimism in which we celebrated the release of a number<br />
of Jewish ' refuseniks' from the Soviet Union after my visit<br />
in 1987.<br />
Yet in 1988, as we were celebrating those first tangible<br />
signs of the break-up of the Stalinist monolith, few of us<br />
had in mind the speed with which this transition would<br />
occur, or the degree to which change would sweep throughout<br />
the whole of Central and Eastern Europe.<br />
Of course it is easy to say, in hindsight, that the internal<br />
contradictions of the Eastern bloc regimes would eventually<br />
lead to their own downfall.<br />
It was not so easy then. We had become accustomed to the<br />
ruthless resilience of the old regimes; we had seen hopes<br />
raised and hopes dashed before; we had learned not to expect<br />
rapid change, or even significant positive change, on such a<br />
broad scale.<br />
Of course there is still much to be done. Democracy has not<br />
spread fully throughout the nations of Eastern Europe;<br />
economic reform and development remains a huge challenge<br />
throughout the region, and we must all understand that this<br />
will inevitably bring dislocation, disruption and pain<br />
before prosperity. And the future of the Soviet Union<br />
itself remains unresolved.<br />
Yet there is much that we can celebrate and to be able<br />
tonight to welcome in our midst Alexander Dubcek, now<br />
President of the Czechoslovak Parliament, is a vindication<br />
of our support for the democratic freedom of the people of<br />
Central and Eastern Europe, a triumph for the cause of<br />
international human rights, and we hope a favourable augury<br />
for the future of the region.<br />
The events in Eastern Europe since 1989 should leave us in<br />
no doubt that the process of transforming the central<br />
command systems of the Eastern bloc is now irreversible.<br />
Nor should we be in any doubt that these changes are a<br />
fundamental victory for human rights.<br />
Friends The urge for political and economic freedom is impossible to<br />
extinguish. The maintenance of obedience through repression, wherever it<br />
occurs, is ultimately unsustainable.<br />
The history of the Czech and Slovak people bears ample<br />
testimony to this. </p>
<p>In 1968 Alexander Dubcek, responding to the demands of his<br />
people, set about building a society based on the principles<br />
of democracy and social justice. His commitment to<br />
" socialism with a human face" made him the driving force of<br />
the reforms which led to the " Prague Spring".<br />
But his initiative was smashed on the anvil of the Brezhnev<br />
doctrine and his leadership was crushed by Warsaw Pact<br />
forces invading and occupying his country.<br />
The extinction of that season of hope was followed by many<br />
years of nationhl anguish, frustration and stagnation.<br />
During that time many citizens were subject to harassment<br />
and humiliation. Hundreds such as Vaclav Havel were<br />
jailed for their stand or were forced to seek asylum<br />
overseas. Alexander Dubcek himself was to endure 20 years<br />
of humiliation and isolation.<br />
But the spirit of freedom lived on in the hearts of the<br />
Czech and Slovak people.<br />
It was a spirit which Alexander Dubcek profoundly<br />
understo d.<br />
In replying to those who wished to destroy the gains of the<br />
Prague spring, Alexander Dubcek made one of the most telling<br />
statements about the ruling Communist party.<br />
Let me quote his words: The party, he said, " cannot impose<br />
its authority, but must constantly acquire it by its<br />
actions. It cannot force its line by orders, but by the<br />
work of its members and the veracity of its ideals."<br />
In asserting that political authority must be earned and not<br />
imposed, Alexander Dubcek was stating a universal truth. In<br />
making that point he was speaking not only for those who had<br />
struggled before him for political freedom in<br />
Czechoslovakia, but for all of those who were to continue to<br />
campaign for freedom in Eastern Europe to this day.<br />
The spontaneous outpourings of support that occurred<br />
throughout Czechoslovakia in 1968 made it clear that<br />
Alexander Dubcek and his government and the ideals they<br />
promoted had his peoples' support.<br />
In the optimistic days of the Prague spring, Alexander<br />
Dubcek's leadership was crucial. Now over two decades later<br />
his leadership is again an inspiration to his people. It is<br />
a fitting tribute to his support throughout Czechoslovak<br />
society that he was, once again, to stand with then<br />
throughout their " velvet revolution" of 1989.<br />
The people of Czechoslovakia are now embarking on a period<br />
of constitutional and economic reform as they make the<br />
important transition towards a market system based on the<br />
fundamental tenets of democratic pluralism. That will not<br />
be a painless process. </p>
<p>4.<br />
But through it, I am confident that we are witnessing the<br />
emergence of a new and stronger Czechoslovak society one<br />
which will ensure that Czechoslovakia can take a respected<br />
place in Europe once more and can become a strong and<br />
independent actor on the world stage.<br />
Friends Now is the time for us to rebuild bridges between East and<br />
West and in doing so to rediscover links which for too long<br />
have been broken.<br />
For many this transit~ ion has taken on an intensely personal<br />
dimension. Hundreds of thousands of Australians retain<br />
family connections with Eastern Europe.<br />
For them the political changes in Eastern Europe _ bring new<br />
opportunities and a chance'to renew old bonds. For many it<br />
will be an opportunity to revisit their homeland a simple<br />
wish which for many has long been denied.<br />
For the Government it. is also a time to renew official links<br />
and to begin the task4 of developing a network of relations<br />
with these countries.<br />
This process is now w~ ell under way. We are developing<br />
political links, and helping to foster market economies.<br />
Friends The shape of the emerging international order depends on<br />
replacing the confrontation of the post-war era with a<br />
spirit of cooperation and reconciliation.<br />
Czechoslovakia has been much in our thoughts in recent<br />
months. Fifty-three yearsago, the world allowed<br />
Czechoslovakia to be condemned to oblivion as ' a smalli<br />
nation far from here of which we know little'. Out of this<br />
unprincipled weakness the world came to witness some of the<br />
most unimagineable horrors ' in history. No one understands<br />
that tragedy better than the Jewish people.<br />
The world recently faced a similar challenge in the Gulf,<br />
and to its great and enduring credit, showed that it had<br />
learned the lesson of Czechoslovakia; that freedom must be<br />
defended everywhere, a3nd aggression must be everywhere<br />
opposed. In 1968, Czechoslovakla taught the world another lesson,<br />
perhaps equally important that military power is no<br />
substitute for moral authority. The Soviet invasion of<br />
Czechoslovakia in 19613 was a military victory, but it was a<br />
moral defeat from which the old Soviet Union never<br />
recovered. I am sure historians will judge that the<br />
collapse of communism as a major ideological force became<br />
inevitable after the crushing of the Prague Spring. The<br />
victory, then, is yours, Alexander Dubcek. </p>
<p>By your stature and your achievements, your career has<br />
transcended the personal and national sphere to have truly<br />
international significance. We honour you for it.<br />
I welcome you to Australia, and I join with Australia's<br />
Jewish Community in paying this tribute to you. It is<br />
richly deserved.<br />
