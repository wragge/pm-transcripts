18 November 1974<br />
The Prime Minister said today he was concerned to<br />
read of the Gold Coast City Council's decision to restrict<br />
daily patrols of beaches during the peak school holiday<br />
period. He hoped the Council's appeal to the Premier would<br />
succeed. Mr Whitlam was speaking at Surfers Paradise where<br />
he held a pross conference this morning.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the first ever federal grants<br />
for life saving had been allocated by the Australian Labor<br />
Government. While not involving vast amounts of money, the<br />
current grants represented an important first step towards<br />
growing Australian Government willingness to get involved<br />
in such funding. The previous Liberal/ Country Party Government had<br />
never taken any action In thin area*<br />
