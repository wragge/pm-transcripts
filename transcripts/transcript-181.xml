AUSTRALIA CLUB SPEECH.<br />
Describing the Summit meting next week as " one of the great<br />
climwctic events in the world", the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr.<br />
Robert Gordon Menzies, surveyed the Commonwealth in relation to the<br />
current international scene. Mr. Menzies was addressing members of<br />
the Australia Club at a dinner given in his honour at the Savoy Hotel<br />
on Monday, May 9./ qOIn the course of his speech, he said:-<br />
UI would like to begin by saying that, as the Prime Minister of<br />
Australia, I ' dip my lid' to Harold Macmillan, who, after all, began<br />
this pioneering and exploratory work. There were people who, when<br />
e went to Moscow, said " Oh no, no, no, you mustn't do that kind of<br />
hing there is no precedent for that. To hell I'm sorry<br />
to hell with those people. _ s a matter of fact, Harold Macdllan made<br />
the adventure he opened up the door; he said " Well, I shall go", and<br />
s he said the other day to two or three of us it has now become<br />
ather fashionable not fissionable, I don't want to open up any<br />
troubles in the Labour Party bat fashionable for people to go around.<br />
I think that that is a wonderful thing. Not because I amn silly<br />
enough to believe that in one blow at the Summit all the great problems<br />
of the worldcan be resolved, but because I hope I am sensible enough<br />
to believe that when human beins can meet each other and sit dovm and<br />
talk and go to some trouble to understand each other, there you have<br />
the beginning of wisdom. Therefore, I am all for the Sum. mit, and when<br />
I say I am all for the Sunnit I won't be there I mean I am all<br />
for the Summit meeting. Not because I believe that at the Summit<br />
neeting there will be 15 problems all neatly dis osed of b, the rules<br />
of Laclid is Euclid still presentable? I don t know but because<br />
IS ubnemliit evmee etthinagt , ito nei s mtahtet erf irnsott syteet p dettheartm cinoeudn tsis. deAtenrdm iinfe, d , a t thtehnis I<br />
t hink the whole world will say " Well, at least this is the beginning<br />
f the new age of common sense."<br />
Who am I to say that the problem of Germany will be resolved, or<br />
the problem of Berlin; but nuclear tests why not? just on the<br />
edge of agreement. And suppose that were resolved, suppose you had<br />
one matter, two matters resolved; this would blow round the world like<br />
fresh air. People would say " Well, at any rate the great men of<br />
the great countries are hoping for settlement."<br />
But the second thing that I want to say to you is this: We are<br />
and in this respect I want to say to the people of Great Britain what<br />
I would say to the people of Australia, because we are very much of a<br />
kind we are a little bit disposed to think that the burning question<br />
of the moment is the determining question of the future. But it isn't.<br />
To be rid of nuclear tests, to have some temporary agreement about<br />
Berlin, to lay a foundation for discussions about the future of Germany<br />
these are very important things. But I happen to belong to the school<br />
of thought that says, or believes I am saying it now that<br />
armaments, the pressure of armaments, the whole terror of a world<br />
standing to arms; these things are not causes, they are results. Anmd<br />
they are results of tension, hostility, bitterness, and therefore, we<br />
must go below the surface of the arnmraent arguments and say " What<br />
is it that keeps the world standin--. at rnms?" And when we put that<br />
question, we ought to think about the answer. </p>
<p>2-<br />
What are the cuases of the world's us go.<br />
back 15 years to the end of the war and say to ourselves " What has<br />
happened to bedevil the world, which was going to be a world of peace<br />
and co-existence and prosperity in which we would all devote our<br />
talents and resources to the greatest thing in life, which is to make<br />
ordinary men and women happier and more peaceful and give their<br />
children a more lovely futg~ I?"<br />
What has happeo bcause the things that have happened are<br />
the causes of offence in the world today. We needn't too much<br />
concentrate on the results. Let us go back to the causes. And<br />
here we have the causes the Soviet Union spreading round Middle<br />
Europe. Look at Poland and East Germany and Czechoslovakia and<br />
Roumania. Gentlemen, we are too easily persuaded to forget about<br />
these things. These countries were among the great homesof freedom<br />
in the world; marvellous countries with great men, great democracies,<br />
great hopes for the future; the homes of scholarship and tradition<br />
and freedom. And they have now become let's face it colonies,<br />
colonies of the one great colonial power left in the world.<br />
I don't iysolf believe that you can pacify the world if, at the<br />
Svery moment at which the British colonies look around the world;<br />
I have been sitting with them at No. 10 if at the very moment when<br />
the British colonies have been marching to freedom and independence and<br />
self-government and membership of the Commonwealth, we shut our eyes to<br />
the fact that there are more ancient democracies, more ancient<br />
* politically speaking, more ancient countries lying athwart Europe who<br />
are the colonies of the new imperialism. These are tremendous things<br />
they are terrible things. I think that we all ought to know before<br />
we persuade ourselves that everything is for the best in the best of<br />
all possible worlds, that there is no longer a propaganda instrument<br />
which is designed to reduce to slavery our people in Australia people<br />
all around the world.<br />
This is not to mean that we deny other people their rights, but<br />
it is to mean this that we would be perfect fools if we believed<br />
that by settling one point here or there we would remove the causes of<br />
these grievous discontents of the world. In short, we must never<br />
lose our courege. We must stand for those things that relate to<br />
human beings in which we believe and for which we will live and die.<br />
This is of the vastest importance, but we must at the same time be<br />
Sprepared to make a beginning.<br />
All I have been saying to you is that I think that the Summit<br />
meeting is to be looked at as the promising beginning, but not as a<br />
definite end. You may all perhaps, be disposed to agree with that.<br />
There are certain things in the world; there are great symptoms,<br />
great results, there are deep-lying causes, but before you can begin<br />
to discuss the causes, before you can begin to get down to discuss<br />
with these great nations in the world those basic matters which<br />
produce the differences, it is essential to remove those more<br />
superficial matters which prevent you, so popular are they, from<br />
getting at the causes.<br />
Now that is one thing that I really want to say to you. We<br />
are a little bedevilled in the world by popular campaigns, by<br />
newspaper campaigns, by looking at the " hot news" circumstance of<br />
the moment so that we don't talk about political philosophies in<br />
South Africa, we talk about Sharpeville. This is more attractive;<br />
this is more newsworthy. We don't talk about the great causes of<br />
difference between the Soviet world or the Chinese world and our own<br />
free world, but we talk about nuclear tests, nuclear weapons.<br />
Now all these things are vastly important, but I do beg of all<br />
of you not to suppose that by dealing with one of these the<br />
resultant factors you have got at the root cause of the trouble.<br />
There will be no peace in the world, no peace whatever in the world,<br />
until we have all got to understand that no country is to be<br />
overthrown by propaganda, by subversion; that every country has the<br />
right to run its own life in its own way. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Whether it is our way or not doesn't matter so much some of us<br />
think so occasionally, but it doesn't. Every country must run its<br />
life in its own way. It must get up in the morning and go to bed<br />
at night feeling that it isn't being pressed and harmmered by the<br />
propaganda of some other nation or some other body of Government.<br />
This is tremendously important. The one thing that so many people<br />
don't understand is that if a man wants to loaf he ought to be<br />
allowed to loaf. That if a,. an wants to think in a funny, silly<br />
way, he ought to be ^ iwed'-o think in a funny, silly way. It is<br />
only when we become ovirtuous that we want to tell people how they<br />
ought to think, how they ought to live, what they ought to do, that<br />
we become involved in this deplorable mischief which bedevils the<br />
world. Now here we are all tonight we are all British people and<br />
thank God we understand something about liberty and we have never<br />
supposed that liberty is a freedom to do what somebody else tells you.<br />
Do let us understand that liberty is liberty.......... these things<br />
are vastly important, and when our distinguished representative goes<br />
to the Summit don't let us be like people standing around saying we<br />
asked for a miracle. There are no miracles to be got nowadays.<br />
As a matter of fact, Kruschev is the best public relations man in<br />
the world. He changes his tactics every day and conceals the fact<br />
that his strategy remains identical with what went before.<br />
But so many people can be deceived by this kind of thing.<br />
Don't let us be deceived this is the Australia Club, but we are all<br />
British, we are all of the same strains of blood not devoted to<br />
reasoning out very closely what have in our minds, but with a<br />
deep instinct down in our guts as to viwh: t is right. Don't let us be<br />
led away from it. Don't let us be beguiled by transient events.<br />
Let us always come back to the basic truth that there are certain<br />
great things about the world that we have understood that we have<br />
practised as nobody else in the history of man has practised.<br />
I have been sitting at No. 10 with people who couldn't have been<br />
there unless we had these beliefs and practices. wvieh ent alk about<br />
that let us think about it without apology and say " We are not being<br />
Sled off by false gods". We know what are the basic things that make<br />
for the peace and content of mankind and not for the first timo in our<br />
history we will stand to them and battle for them." </p>
