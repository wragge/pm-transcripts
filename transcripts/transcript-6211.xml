PRUME~ MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 27 September 1983<br />
The Prime Minister'received the following message from the<br />
President of the United States, Mr. Ronald Reagan:<br />
" Dear Bob,<br />
If the America's Cup had to leave the United States, I am<br />
delighted that it's home will be Australia at least until<br />
the next race. All Australians must be justifiably proud<br />
of the extraordinary team effort, skill and sportsmanship<br />
that brought off this magnificent victory. I hope you will<br />
share with all those who had anything to do with Australia II's<br />
sucess my congratulations and those of the American people.<br />
one major consolation for us is that the next race will<br />
provide a large number of Americans the opportunity to enjoy<br />
the beauty and hospitality of Perth as they seek to bring<br />
home the cup.<br />
Sincerely, Ronald Reagan" </p>
