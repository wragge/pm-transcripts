DOMESTIC JET -EUIPMNT AND AIRPORT DEVELOPMENT<br />
PRO GRAIE<br />
Statement by the Prine Minister, the E on._ R. G Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, announced today<br />
a programme of airport development throughout Australia which<br />
will allow the introduction of jet aircraft to Australia's<br />
internal air routes after July, 1964.<br />
The airport programe involves construction of a<br />
new Melbourne airport at Tullamarino, a new international<br />
passenger terminal building and other major development works<br />
at Sydney airport in addition to runway extensions already<br />
approved, and important airport works elsewhere throughout<br />
Australia requiring a total expenditure of about œ 30 million<br />
in the next five years.<br />
Mr, Monzios said the Government had approved the<br />
purchase of two heavy jet airliners each by Trans-Australia<br />
Airlines and Ansett/ A. N. A. and expected to be advised of the<br />
airlines' positive aircraft selections after November 18th,<br />
Both airlines had indicated to the Government that<br />
they preferred to introduce heavy rather than light jet airliners.<br />
The airport programme will bring the all-time total<br />
Commonwealth airport expenditure at Sydney to about œ 20 million<br />
and at Melbourne to about œ 17 million.<br />
Mr. Menzies said the now Melbourne airport at<br />
Tullamarine would be doevloped for international and domestic<br />
jet traffic by 1967 on the , O0O-acre site already acquired by<br />
the Government for approximately œ 2.3 million.<br />
The new airport would have two runways, 8,000 feet<br />
and 7,000 feet long, with high-speed turnouts from runways to<br />
increase traffic capacity, taxiways, aprons and a modern<br />
terminal building to accommodate both international and domestic<br />
traffic. The project would include the usual engineering and<br />
other scr. ices and the airport would be equipped with the most<br />
modern air navigational facilities, including high intensity<br />
lighting and instrument landing systems.<br />
Runways and aprons would be designed to handle the<br />
heaviest aircraft types contemplated for civil airline operations<br />
throughout the world.<br />
Mr. Menzios said that the Government had acquired<br />
a large area of land at Tullamarine and overseas airport experts<br />
who had seen the site were unanimous that it was ideal to serve<br />
a developing city.<br />
The runways planned for the airport could be adapted<br />
if necessary to meet future traffic demands. While Essendon<br />
Airport remained in operation, the new runways could be used<br />
in co-ordination with the existing runways at Essendon and the<br />
Tullamarine-Essendpn Airport complex would in fact provide a<br />
multiple runway system which would be operated under a single<br />
Air Traffic Control unit. o o o a ./ 2 </p>

Mr. Menzies said the Government had approved the use<br />
of Essendon by domestic jot aircraft as an intorim measure until<br />
Tullar arine was completed. Jet aircraft operations would have to<br />
meet any meessary restrictions at the airporto<br />
He said that with the œ 5 million already spent at<br />
Essendon and the acquisition of the Tullamarine site for mcre<br />
than œ 2 million, the works now approved would bring Commonwealth<br />
expenditure on Melbourne's airport facilities to more than<br />
œ 17 million. Mr. Menzies said the new international terminal area<br />
at Sydney Airport would be designed to handle not only the<br />
existing large international jet airliners, but also more advanced<br />
airliners which might be expected to use the airport later.<br />
The now terminal area roquired the construction of<br />
a new international terminal with the necessary aprons, taxiways,<br />
and other facilities, It was planned to be in operation by<br />
1968. The new Sydney terninal area would cost about œ 4<br />
nillion and this was additional to the cost of extending the<br />
airport s north-south runway into Botany Bay which would bring<br />
the Commonwealth expenditure on Sydney airport to approximately<br />
million. Mr. Menzies said the major domestic operators had<br />
recently modernised their Sydney Airport terminal buildings.<br />
These would remain in operation for some years.<br />
Ho said the new internati. onal building would have<br />
every modern amenity and be a world-class international air<br />
terminal. Sydney was served by nine international airlines and<br />
the now terminal would be designed to meet the foreseeable demands<br />
of air traffic growth.<br />
The Sydney Airport programne meant that Sydney would<br />
have runways of 8,300 feet and 7,500 feet.<br />
Mr. Menzios said that the benefits of the introduction<br />
of heavy jet airliners by the domestic airlines would not be<br />
confined to air travellers on the trans-continental and other<br />
blue-ribbon trunk routes. As the jets went into service on major<br />
air routes some Electra and Viscount airliners would be available<br />
for introduction on other domestic services and this would result<br />
in a genera], improvement in airline services throughout the<br />
entire domestic network. This would involve considerable airport<br />
works that would be carried out over the next three years,<br />
These included runway and apron developments at<br />
Adelaide, Hobart, Mount Isa Kalgoorlie, Townsville, Lae and<br />
Coolangatta, as well as at aunceston where the Government had<br />
already approved an airport runway and building development<br />
programme which would cost more than œ 1 million. These works<br />
would be in addition to the normal airport development programme<br />
which cost the Commonwealth between œ 1.5 million and œ 2 million<br />
a year, and included a very substantial amount granted to Local<br />
Authorities under the Aerodrome Local Ownership Plano<br />
This plan, introduced by the Government in 1957 and<br />
already accepted Ly more than one hundred Local Authorities<br />
throughout Australia, provided for grants by the Commonwealth of<br />
per cent, towards the cost of the development and maintenance<br />
of airports owned and operated by local authorities, 0 0o */ 3 </p>
