<p>General Hickling the Chief of the Australian Army, Brigadier Pursey,</p>
<p> other distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It is a special privilege for me on this stunning Canberra morning</p>
<p> to address this parade. To express on behalf of everybody who is here</p>
<p> the respect and admiration that we feel for those men and women who</p>
<p> are graduating today, to those men and women who have chosen a professional</p>
<p> career in the armed services of Australia.</p>
<p>You along with the entire Australian nation inherit great traditions.</p>
<p> None is more special or treasured in the Australian ethos than the</p>
<p> Anzac tradition. And none more totally permeates the defence forces</p>
<p> of Australia, none instils those defence forces with more justifiable</p>
<p> pride than that particular tradition. Yours is an honoured profession</p>
<p> and on behalf of the Government and the people of Australia I thank</p>
<p> you for the commitment that you are making, the commitment you are</p>
<p> making to a lifetime as professional members of the Australian Defence</p>
<p> Force.</p>
<p>It is the constant prayer of any sensible Prime Minister of this country</p>
<p> that never again will we ask the young people of our nation to put</p>
<p> their lives on the line the way in which it occurred far too often</p>
<p> in the earlier years of this century. But in order for that prayer</p>
<p> to be realised we must always have ready and able defence forces.</p>
<p> And to have ready and able defence forces we need to have men and</p>
<p> women superbly trained, of high intelligence with a strong sense of</p>
<p> professionalism. And the core of that for the Australian forces has</p>
<p> always been those who have passed through the graduating ranks of</p>
<p> the Royal Military College at Duntroon. It is one of the great institutions</p>
<p> of Australian life. It has produced great professional soldiers over</p>
<p> the years and those soldiers have done great service in the defence</p>
<p> of this country and in the defence of what we hold very dear.</p>
<p>Today is a special day for those graduating, it's also a very special</p>
<p> day for their family members and other loved ones who have come along</p>
<p> to participate in this very special occasion. And to them I also give</p>
<p> my thanks for the support and encouragement that you have given to</p>
<p> your sons and daughters to undertake a professional career in the</p>
<p> armed forces of Australia. Because without the support and encouragement</p>
<p> of your families, without the sense of pride that they transmit to</p>
<p> you in what you have achieved then the task and the challenge is all</p>
<p> that harder and more daunting.</p>
<p>It's also an occasion to compliment the commandant, the staff at the</p>
<p> Royal Military College for the tremendous work they do. The quality</p>
<p> of people turned out by this College is widely acclaimed around the</p>
<p> world. And it's been a particular privilege for me today, the first</p>
<p> occasion I have had to do this as Prime Minister of Australia to take</p>
<p> this parade, to have an opportunity of meeting you and I'll meet more</p>
<p> of you later over morning tea.</p>
<p>But can I express my thanks and my admiration. I have always had an</p>
<p> immense regard for the men and women of the armed forces of this country.</p>
<p> They deserve our respect. Without their efforts and their commitment</p>
<p> in the past this nation would not be the free and powerful and freedom</p>
<p> loving people that it really is today. And you are the current generation</p>
<p> of a very long and noble tradition. I thank you for that and I wish</p>
<p> all of you every happiness and every success in your professional</p>
<p> career in the future. Thank you and good luck.</p>
