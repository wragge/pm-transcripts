EMBARGOED: Against Delivery, 8pm<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, HP<br />
NATIONAL TR~ ADE AND INVESTMENT OUTLOOK CONFERENCE<br />
MBLDOURNE, 24 NOVE10ER, 1993<br />
Some of you here will have heard these opening remarks<br />
before, many of you will know the truth of Lhem.<br />
But I would like everyone to know and chat is enough<br />
to warrant repeating them once more.<br />
The imaege of Australia as an extended sheep run and<br />
quarry is false.<br />
The idea that Australians5 enjoy the comforts of<br />
sophisticated contemporary life principally through the<br />
proceeds of pastoralism and mining is false.<br />
The idea that we cannot compete with the world in the<br />
business of making things and selling them at the<br />
sophisticated end of the international market is false.<br />
We hear an echo of these ideas from time to time, but<br />
they are curiosities not realities.<br />
They linger because they were sufficiently true for lonig<br />
enough to leave a residue.<br />
Only a decade ago the suggestion that we Might-Lrade<br />
competitively in manufactured goods and services, as well<br />
as in minerals, energy and primary products that we<br />
might be able to create and SuSLain a more diverse,<br />
creative dnd sophisLicated economy was scarcely<br />
entertained. This National Trade and Investment Outlook Conference is<br />
one indication among many of how much that way of<br />
thinking has changed.<br />
And how much the reality has changed. </p>
<p>Now we know that the only way we can maintain and improve<br />
our standard of living, create employment and reduce<br />
unemployment, and share in the wealth of a'rapidly<br />
changing world, is by means of a diverse, flexible,<br />
creative, operi and sophisticated economy.<br />
The Australian Government knows this, most Australian<br />
companies know this, most Australian workers know it.<br />
indeed there are few countries perhaps none where the<br />
process-of economic education has been so rapid and so<br />
general as it has been in Australia in the past decade.<br />
Not that this evening we shouldn't repeat some of the<br />
injunctions once more; exports mean employment and<br />
prosperity. Exports mean growth.<br />
Exports mean a share of the excitement, a share of the<br />
good jobs and the good life in the years ahead.<br />
Exports are what it is all about.<br />
We know how far the frontiers of trade have widened. We<br />
are very much aware that we live in the fastest growing<br />
region in the worl. d the Asia-Pacific region which now<br />
accounts for about 80 per cent of our exports.<br />
We know how rich is the potential.<br />
How demanding the challenges.<br />
We also know how deep our resources run, and that what we<br />
need principally is the resolve and ingenuity and that,<br />
I presume, is the business of this conference.<br />
Those of you who have heard me say these things before<br />
and, it's true, I have been saying them for a decade<br />
will quite possibly have also heard some of these figures<br />
I am about to quote.<br />
I confess to this as well in the-past twelve ionths or<br />
so, as the pattern has emerged, I have not been backward<br />
in describing it.<br />
And I see no reason to make tonight an exception.<br />
Because I wani. to demonstrate that more than our thinking<br />
has changed the reality has changed too.<br />
Australian exporis as a percentage of GDP have grown from<br />
13 percent a decade ago to 20 percent today.<br />
Today exporLs of manufactures now exceed exports of rural<br />
products aiid minerals and fuiels.<br />
As I said, what. remains of the old image of Australia as<br />
a farm or a mine may now be jettisoned for good. </p>
<p>A decade ago, in 1982, exports accounted for 14 per cent<br />
of sales by Aust. ralia's manufacturing sector.<br />
Today the figure is 24 per cent.<br />
in other words, almost one quarter of sales earnings by<br />
Australian ianufacLurers came from overseas.<br />
Manufactured exports increased by an average of 12.5<br />
percent a year between 1982 and 1992 more than four<br />
times faster than growth in agricultural exports and<br />
slightly faster than growth in mining exports.<br />
in the fastest growing component of world trade<br />
services our exports have grown threefold since 1983<br />
and now account for almost a quarter of our total<br />
exports. This conference, then, takes place within a context of<br />
dramatic change in the structure-and direction of the<br />
Australian economy and a parallel change in Australian<br />
consciousness. A change in the outlook of Australian business and<br />
industry, Australian workers and Australian governments.<br />
All of them now take it as given that we can and mus<br />
export and I don't know anyone who has credibly pointed<br />
to the limits of our potential to do so.<br />
Of course, the outstanding fact in any consideration of<br />
Australia's trade and investment potential is our<br />
location in the Asia-Pacific.<br />
We live in the mosL dynamic region in the world and that<br />
gives us* the greatest opporLuflity we have ever had.<br />
There is no doubt we have the resources to succeed, and<br />
not only in the ' traditional areas of minerals and energy<br />
and agriculture.<br />
There is no question about our capacity for technological<br />
invention and innovation.<br />
This country develops and produces world class products<br />
at the forefront of medicine, science and technology in<br />
the field of microsurgery, IVF, the cardiac pacemaker,<br />
plant genetic*.<br />
Australian-made h ' igh-speed ferries ply their way through<br />
European waters; Australiani-made engines and automotive<br />
components are found in European cars; Australian<br />
software manages some of the most advanced airports in<br />
the world and the Swiss Stock Exchange.<br />
We have a highly educated and skilled workforce. The<br />
Goverrnent has made education and training an absolute<br />
policy priority. N </p>
<p>We have raised the number of young Australians<br />
completing secondary school from 3 in 10 to 8 in<br />
A higher proportion of Australians leaving school<br />
now enter university than in Germany, Japan or the<br />
United Kingdom.<br />
In AuStralia today over 40 different languages are<br />
taught in our schools the Federal Goverrnment<br />
spends about $ 22 million a year on Asian language<br />
education and studies.<br />
We are making training more responsive to industry,<br />
increasing capacity in our training institutions, and<br />
promoting the relevance and quality of that training.<br />
We have the human and material resources. We have the<br />
awareness and motivation.<br />
The task is to clear the way for business to exert its<br />
genius and muscle.<br />
I think it can be safely said that in the past 10 years<br />
no Government has done more to both raise awareness of<br />
the economic imperatives arid to make the practical<br />
changes necessary to meet them.<br />
We have opened up the economy, floated the exchange rate,<br />
reformed the waterfront, rail and road transportation,<br />
aviation and telecommunications.<br />
We have established an orderly and manifestly effective<br />
program for reducing tariff protection, and improving the<br />
capacity of the economy to respond to the challenges of<br />
the international marketplace.<br />
We have introduced industrial relations reforms which<br />
will increase labour market flexibility and productivity<br />
growth by widening the spread of enterprise bargaining.<br />
The fruits of these reforms should now combine with other<br />
favourable conditions to-attract investment and growth.<br />
Interest rates are now at historically low levels.<br />
Inflation is low and under control.<br />
We are seeing solid productivity-growth.<br />
In addition, the recent business tax initiatives have<br />
ensured that the competitiveness of our system is on a<br />
par with comparable OECD countries; and the reduction in<br />
Australia's corporate tax rate to 33 per cent makes it<br />
competitive with most of our tLading partners. </p>
<p>Partly through Government encouragement, growth in<br />
research and development has been the second highest in<br />
the OECD, and Australia now employs more research and<br />
development Personnel than most counLrie5 in our region.<br />
we have introduced a development allowance, a general<br />
investrnenL allowance, a substantial acceleration of<br />
depreciation provisions and concessionally taxed pooled<br />
development funds.<br />
The Australian economy is now around 27 per cent more<br />
internationally competitive than 10 years ago.<br />
it is a more diverse, more flexible and much stronger<br />
economyr. Despite subdued world trading conditions, Australian<br />
export earnings have reached record levels.<br />
An export culture which we have developed in the last few<br />
years is now growing new small to medium sized businesses<br />
whose entire reason for being is export.<br />
It is high value-added products they export, and more<br />
oftLen than not it is to the ASia-Pacific they go. Indeed<br />
these companies have been instrumental in achieving<br />
average annual growth of 15 per cent in our exports of<br />
sophist icated mariufacLures.<br />
Australia's advantages have been recognised by a growing<br />
number of multinational companies who have selected<br />
Australia as a base for activities in the Asia-Pacific<br />
region. Lexmark, Cathay Pacific and Tandem Computers incorporated<br />
to name a few.<br />
We encourage the establishment of regional headquarters<br />
in Australia.<br />
My Government is willing to be responsive in addressing<br />
issues impacting on companies' location decisions.<br />
The Australian government takes the view that that its<br />
principal role is to create an environment in which<br />
business can be flourish in which established<br />
businesses can grew and new ones be born.<br />
But. we remain a governxnent -which also believes in working<br />
W11 industry: to open doors and build new relduionships.<br />
We are assisting exporLers. In the telecommunications<br />
area, for example, the Government has established a joint<br />
body to ensure closer collaboration between the industry<br />
and Government in their export efforts. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Government launched a processed<br />
food export drive, one of the largest and mostcomprehensive<br />
single campaigns of its kind aimed at<br />
tapping the quality of Australia's food industries.<br />
Australia is an extremely efficient agricultural<br />
producer, but there is enormous scope to develop the<br />
industry further and exploit the rapidly expanding market<br />
for high quality clean food.<br />
My Government has also recognised that enormous<br />
opportunities can be created by tapping into the<br />
potential lying in the skills and abilities of those many<br />
Australians who have come from oLher countries and retain<br />
personal and cultural ties with their homelands.<br />
The continued growth and stability of the APEC region arid<br />
its continuing integration is crucial. to Australia's<br />
expansion and prosperity.<br />
This is particularly true given the disappointing failure<br />
of the US and the EC in their most recent meetings to<br />
produce a breakthrough on the market access issues<br />
necessary to move the Uruguay Round to conclusion in the<br />
middle of next month.<br />
Over the nexL two years increased exporcs to APEC mernberb<br />
will create more than 70,000 new jobs in AuStralia. good<br />
skilled jobs with good wages and a good future.<br />
Over the next two years increased exports to APEC members<br />
will account for around a third of our total increase in<br />
AusLvalian production.<br />
At the end of those two years Australian exports Lo APEC<br />
will account for around 15 per cent of our total output<br />
of all we do, all we make, all we sell.<br />
Sixty six billion dollars worth of exports to Lhe most<br />
dynamic and the most rapidly growing region of the world.<br />
It is already the case that APEC has a higher degree of<br />
trade integration than the EC.<br />
just on two thirds of our exports by APEC economies are<br />
to other APEC economies.<br />
I have just returned from Seattle where leaders from the<br />
Asia-Pacific region met to discu. ss ways of working more<br />
closely to assist the free flow of goods and services.<br />
I went to Seattle not knowing, as I to~ d an audience in<br />
California, what exactly would happen when fourteen Asia-<br />
Pacific leaders, with no staff and no formal agenda, got<br />
together on Bl~ ake Island in Puget Sound. </p>
<p>It was the first meeting of its kind and it no easy thing<br />
to predict the interaction of such different people, from<br />
such different countries.<br />
But the result was I thought very powerful evidence that<br />
the leaders of the, Asia-Pacific economic community are<br />
developing a stronger and stronger sense of the<br />
importance of things which we can do together to advance<br />
the prosperity of the region.<br />
We came away from that meeting with some substantive<br />
understandings. we agreed to ask our officials to get to work on an<br />
investment code for the region, which would allow us to<br />
define some common approaches to the vast movements of<br />
funds, technology, and techniques which are proceeding in<br />
every direction in the region, and which ar'e doing so<br />
much to transform it in ways we are only beginning to<br />
comprehend<br />
We agreed to greatly increase the importance of businessin<br />
the APEC process by creating a council composed of two<br />
business leaders from each country.<br />
Its job will be to suggest ways APEC can help business in<br />
trade and investment, to become engaged in the work<br />
program of officials, and to urge us on to do whatever<br />
governments can do in concert to enhance regional<br />
prosperity. We also agreed that harmonising product standards was a<br />
worthwhile goal for APEC, and endorsed the work of our<br />
ministers in agreeing to a trade and investment framework<br />
document which formalises the APEC structure.<br />
We also agreed that harmonising product standards was a<br />
worthwhile goal for APEC, and endorsed the work of our<br />
ministers in agreeing to a trade and investment framework<br />
document which formalises the APEC structure.<br />
We agreed that finance ministers would meet early next<br />
year to commence an exchange of information-and views<br />
about the regional economy, and the lessons we can share<br />
in tAcroeconomic policy making.<br />
The most important of our agreements was to meet again<br />
next year in Indonesia.<br />
This means that the whole work agenda of APEC officials,<br />
the whole series of meetings on customs, standards<br />
harinonisation, investment rules and on the regional<br />
economy suddenly takes on a new significance, a new<br />
weight. </p>
<p>For the first time the results of all this work will<br />
ultirnaLely come under the scrutiny of leaders, and roLr<br />
that reason it will have a little more urgency, a little<br />
imore consequence.<br />
So the formal outcomes of the Seattle meeting were<br />
important, but I think the informal outcome was much more<br />
importanlt. This outcome was simply the chemistry of the meeting<br />
the excellence of the personal rapport which was present<br />
in this first ever meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders.<br />
it is a remarkable thing that in this age of faxes and<br />
telephone calls, of instant electronic communication,<br />
face Lo face mectings still matter.<br />
But in my experience they do they matter tremendously.<br />
We didn't create a new community in SeaLLle.<br />
Instead, wc begjan to think of ourselves as the community_<br />
we have already become. </p>
