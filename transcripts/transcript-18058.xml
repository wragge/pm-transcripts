I would like to thank Mike Rann for his service to the people of South Australia as Premier, following the announcement today that he will retire as Premier on 20 October this year.</p>
<p>Mike has made an historic contribution to his state, as Premier since 2002 and before that as Labor leader since 1994.</p>
<p>Mike became Labor Leader under the most difficult of circumstances following the December 1993 state election.</p>
<p>From his first day leading the so-called “cricket team” of Labor members; to the day of Labor's return to office in 2002; to his national leadership in bringing social inclusion onto the national agenda; to today, still  leading the State in negotiations for the expansion of Olympic Dam, Mike has been a great Labor leader.</p>
<p>Mike will leave his State economically stronger, socially fairer and environmentally more sustainable than it was when he began. He has more than proved a worthy successor to Don Dunstan as a great Labor Premier of South Australia.</p>
<p>I wish Mike well in this new phase of his life. I also welcome and congratulate Mike Rann's designated successor as leader of the South Australian Labor Party and next Premier of South Australia, Jay Weatherill.  </p>
<p>The State will be well served by Jay Weatherill's leadership in the future. </p>
