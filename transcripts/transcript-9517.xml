PRIME MINISTER 620/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
MILITARY SERVICE MEDAL<br />
I am pleased to announce today the formal establishment of a new award in<br />
the Australian honours system the Australian Service Medal 1945-1975<br />
which will be awarded to a large number of Australian service personnel who<br />
did not receive any award for their service in this period.<br />
The creation of this award was one of the recommendations of the Committee<br />
of Inquiry into Defence Awards which reported to the Government in March<br />
1994 and final approval has now been granted by Her Majesty The Queen.<br />
The award' s aim is to recognise service in prescribed peacekeeping or nonwarlike<br />
operations during the period 1945-1975 where recognition has not<br />
extended previously through an award.<br />
The Government will be recommending that the following service will qualify<br />
for the award of the medal:<br />
Service in the occupation of Japan during the period 3<br />
September 1945 to 30 June 1947 with a qualifying period of<br />
days; Service in Korea from 28 July 1953 until 26 August 1957 with a<br />
qualifying period of 30 days;<br />
Service of Australian troops in anti-terrorist operations in the<br />
Thai land-Malaysia border area between 1 August 1960 and 16<br />
August 1964 with a qualifying period of 30 days;<br />
Service of air crew who took part in operations in support of<br />
ground troops during the same period with a qualifying service<br />
of one operational sortie. In addition any member of air crew<br />
who in the period 17 August 1964 to 30 March 1966 flew an<br />
operational sortie in the Thai land-Malaysia border area but did<br />
not qualify for the GSM " Malay Peninsula"; </p>
<p>Service of Australian personnel at the Royal Thai Airforce Base<br />
Ubon during the period 1 May 1962 to 31 August 1968 with a<br />
qualifying period of 30 days;<br />
Service as a member of 2 Field Troop Royal Australian<br />
Engineers and other Australian personnel who participated in<br />
Operation " Crown" and served in Ban Kok Talat, Thailand<br />
during the period 1 May 1962 to 31 August 1968 with a<br />
qualifying period of 30 days;<br />
Service in the Territory of Papua New Guinea-from the<br />
formation of the Pacific Islands Regiment in 1951 until<br />
independence of PNG on 16 September 1975 with a qualifying<br />
period of 180 days. This also applies to personnel of all<br />
Services including RAN personnel posted to HIMAS Tarangau<br />
and attached vessels;<br />
Service from 13 August 1948 to 13 February 1975 with the<br />
United Nations including the Military Group in India and<br />
Pakistan ( UNMOGIP) and the United Nations India-Pakistan<br />
Observer Mission UNIPOM with a qualifying period of 90 days;<br />
Service with the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority<br />
( UNTEA) force in West New Guinea during the period I<br />
October 1962 to 1 May 1963 with a qualifying period of 30 days;<br />
Other peacekeeping operations during the period 1945 to 1975<br />
are being examined by Defence authorities with a view to<br />
establishing whether equivalent service warrants recognition by<br />
the award of this Medal. Announcement of which other<br />
operations will attract the Medal will be announced as soon as<br />
the Government has considered recommendations.<br />
The Medals design features the Commonwealth Coat of Arms on the obverse<br />
and is ensigned with the Crown of Saint Edward. The reverse of the Medal<br />
features the Federation Star overlaid with a plinth on which the wearer's<br />
name will be engraved. The obverse and reverse are decorated with clusters<br />
of mimosa blossoms symbolising the presence of Australian service<br />
personnel in overseas peacekeeping and other non-warlike operations. The<br />
accompanying ribbon will have bands of dark and light blue, khaki, green and<br />
gold. The Australian Service Medal 1945-1975 will be placed on the same level as<br />
the current Australian Service Medal in the Australian Order of Precedence of<br />
Honours and Awards.<br />
