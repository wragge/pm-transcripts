<p>[ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS OMITTED]</p>
<p>When St Vincent's was established 155 years ago, cancer was almost always a death sentence.</p>
<p>The Sisters of Charity could bring comfort.</p>
<p>But not hope.</p>
<p>We just didn't have the medical knowledge.</p>
<p>Today, Australia leads the world in cancer care.</p>
<p>In the last two decades alone, the survival rate for many common cancers has increased by 30 per cent.</p>
<p>And we're doing better every day.</p>
<p>We have hope.</p>
<p>We have hope because of people like Rob Sutherland, Allan Spigelman and their colleagues around the world.</p>
<p>Outstanding researchers and clinicians who have made beating cancer their life's work.</p>
<p>When you come to work each morning, you come burdened with some very grim knowledge.</p>
<p>One hundred and twenty Australians will die of cancer today.</p>
<p>Another 300 will be diagnosed.</p>
<p>Those statistics demand a response from each of us as citizens and from the nation as a whole.</p>
<p>That is why since 2007, this Government has committed over $2.5 billion to infrastructure, medicines, screening and research to build a world-class cancer care system including $70 million to help build the facility we're standing in today.</p>
<p>In a federal budget stretching into the hundreds of billions,that may not seem much.</p>
<p>But in your hands, it is enough to create a place to work miracles.</p>
<p>To create a place of hope.</p>
<p>And friends, I want to say that is not the end of our ambitions for this site.</p>
<p>This corner of inner city Sydney may be small in area but it's very great in impact:</p>
<p> * 	St Vincent's public and private hospitals;<br />
 * 	The Garvan;<br />
 * 	Sacred Heart Hospice;<br />
 * 	The Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute;<br />
 * 	The Kirby Institute;<br />
 * 	And the wonderful work of the Nelune Foundation; and<br />
 * 	I acknowledge Nelune Rajapakse's presence here today</p>
<p>Per square metre, perhaps the greatest concentration of medical care and research excellence in the nation.</p>
<p>Today I want to announce a new member of your family with the placement of the nation's third National Prostate Cancer Research Centre here in Darlinghurst.</p>
<p>It's a cause that's very close to Wayne Swan's heart and I'm to join him and Minister Plibersek in making this announcement today.</p>
<p>This third National Prostate Cancer Centre is a collaboration between St Vincent's Prostate Cancer Centre, St Vincent's &amp; Mater Health and the Garvan Institute.</p>
<p>You all know what a prestigious win this is for these three organisations.</p>
<p>You know the international research interest it will attract.</p>
<p>There will be less suffering and grief because of the work that will be done in this new institute, just like the Kinghorn Centre.</p>
<p>There will be new knowledge and new discoveries.</p>
<p>Better collaboration between these institutes, and indeed your colleagues around the world.</p>
<p>Above all, there will be personalised, multi-disciplinary carefor patients because the journey of cancer can be so complex and demanding.</p>
<p>So this must be their centre.</p>
<p>Their place of comfort.</p>
<p>Their place of hope.</p>
<p>And because of what happens here, the things we can't cure and treat today, we will be able to cure and treat in the future.</p>
<p>It may not happen this year or next.</p>
<p>But you don't build places like the Kinghorn Centre for months or years, but for decades.</p>
<p>This is an investment in decades.</p>
<p>An investment in hope.</p>
<p>Supported by many generous donors, led by the Kinghorn family itself.</p>
<p>And staffed by the some of the most brilliant minds in our land.</p>
<p>So, proud of your work  -  and confident in what you will achieve; I declare the Kinghorn Cancer Centre officially open and wish it every success.</p>
