PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
TO THE FOURTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE<br />
ASIA PACIFIC TELECOMMUNITY<br />
SYDNEY, 25 NOVEMBER 1987<br />
Gareth Evans<br />
Mr George Maltby, President of the A. P. T.<br />
Delegates It's a pleasure to welcome to Sydney and to Australia the<br />
delegates to the fourth General Assembly of the Asia-Pacific<br />
Telecommunity. I congratulate you on your choice of<br />
Australia as venue for your meeting it's good to know that<br />
Australia is increasingly being recognised not only as an<br />
exciting tourist destination but also as an efficient and<br />
friendly host for conferences such as yours.<br />
Indeed Australia is increasingly in the spotlight of<br />
attention from the world's telecommunications industry.<br />
Next year, in our bicentennial year, Melbourne will host the<br />
world Administrative Telegraph and Telephone Conference,<br />
convened by the International Telecommunications Union.<br />
The significance of this event can be gauged not only from<br />
the rarity with which the ITU calls such world conferences<br />
the last was in Geneva in 1973.<br />
The Melbourne conference will be significant as well because<br />
of the issue it will address. Policy makers from nearly<br />
every nation will assemble to discuss the watershed issue of<br />
the future regulatory framework for international<br />
telecommunications. Establishing the right level and degree of regulation fo an<br />
industry is a difficult and sensitive task in any case.<br />
It hardly needs stating in this audience that the question<br />
of regulation of an industry as subject to rapid<br />
technological change as yours, presents real difficulties.<br />
Let me give you a stark measure of the technological change<br />
in the communication industry. </p>
<p>I mentioned that next year is the bicentenary of the<br />
European settlement of Australia. The little colony of<br />
convicts and soldiers and administrators which arrived in<br />
1788 on the shores near where we now meet was as isolated<br />
from the rest of the world as it was possible to be.<br />
Robert Hughes, in his recent book The Fatal Shore, recounts<br />
that by June 1790, the colonists ha gone nearly three years<br />
without news of the outside world.<br />
When the ship The Lady Juliana arrived in Sydney in that<br />
month, it had at sea for 11 months.<br />
Even so, its newspapers and letters bore stunning news: the<br />
illness of the King, the first inauguration of George<br />
Washington and the outbreak of the French Revolution.<br />
By today's standards it was all old news. But then again we<br />
lost our capacity for being surprised by new communications<br />
technology when Neil Armstrong's foot was placed in the dust<br />
on the surface of the moon and we all saw it happen on TV<br />
1.3 seconds later.<br />
Today we are seeing a continuing surge in the development of<br />
new communications technologies.<br />
Technological developments and the convergence of the<br />
telecommunications and information industries have placed<br />
you at the centre of some of the most exciting challenges<br />
facing both industry and governments as we move towards the<br />
twenty-first century.<br />
Telecommunication is well past the stage of being regarded<br />
as essentially a social service. it is now, and will be<br />
increasingly in the future, a potent source of competitive<br />
advantage for commercial enterprises and for nations that<br />
are prepared to respond flexibly to emerging commercial<br />
opportunities. Satellites, optical fibre cables, and the digitalisation of<br />
voice, data and image transmission these are the<br />
technologies which are at the heart of modern<br />
telecommunications. To use an anatomical analogy, if trade is the life blood of<br />
modern societies, then telecommunications is the nervous<br />
system linking together the disparate parts of the world<br />
economy. The benefits are sometimes not undiluted. VStock trading,<br />
thanks to the new technology, can now take place twenty four<br />
hours a day by shifting the market with the sun from Europe<br />
to North America to the western Pacific rim and back to<br />
Europe. This has created a world market, operating in real<br />
time, which is susceptible to the instantaneous responses<br />
which we saw all too dramatically in action last month. </p>
<p>In short, your industry's growth prospects are seemingly<br />
boundless. New needs and new markets are continually being<br />
discovered and new communications products developed.<br />
Indeed we are perhaps reaching the stage where the<br />
capacities of engineers and scientists to produce new<br />
communications technologies will exceed the capacities of<br />
consumers to use them.<br />
It is not hard to imagine business uses for the proposed new<br />
Integrated Services Digital Network the next stage of<br />
development which will make it possible to connect facsimile<br />
machines, personal computers, phones and telexes to the<br />
digital network.<br />
But are we sure that homes need this new facility? You will<br />
probably know that the initials of the new network ISDN<br />
have been appropriated by some cynics to form the less than<br />
flattering tag: Innovations Subscribers Don't Need.<br />
Presumably we will see the answer to that eventually in the<br />
sales figures.<br />
This rapid pace of technological change presents the Asia<br />
Pacific Telecommunity with its own challenges.<br />
The regulatory norms which prevailed when the Asia Pacific<br />
Telecommunity was formed are in danger of becoming outmoded,<br />
or even rendered obsolete, by the changing communications<br />
systems.<br />
And as a representative body of the Asia Pacific region, you<br />
must also grapple with the great disparities in<br />
technological sophistication that still exist within our<br />
global village.<br />
It was reported recently that metropolitan New York has more<br />
telephones than black Africa; that in India more than one<br />
million people are on the waiting list for a telephone; that<br />
the developing countries have a smaller share of the world's<br />
telephones than they do of the world's incomes.<br />
Most developing countries at present have a high degree of<br />
technical dependence on foreign sources of communications<br />
equipment, as well as for systems definition and planning.<br />
Developing countries cannot afford to remain in isolation<br />
and lose out on the benefits that sophisticated integrated<br />
communications networks will bring. But equally they face<br />
the challenge of developing the capacity to control-.<br />
adequately the flow and application of new technology.<br />
Within this framework of change, let me review two specific<br />
areas in which Australia has a particular concern. IVt , </p>
<p>4.1<br />
First, we are alarmed at the threat posed by the rising tide<br />
of protectionism to the rules and practices of free trade on<br />
which the world's post-war prosperity has been built. This<br />
certainly affects us as an efficient agricultural producer.<br />
But the trade in services including telecommunications<br />
services are not immune from the threat.<br />
It is clear that without the development of global markets<br />
for services such as telecommunications and data services,<br />
without the rapid growth of international financial and<br />
insurance services, without rapid and flexible global<br />
transport, the total world market for goods would be very<br />
much smaller, and we would all be the poorer.<br />
Over the last decade, world trade in services has grown at<br />
an average annual rate of nearly 16 per cent.<br />
An area of trade in services that is growing particularly<br />
rapidly is satellite services. International satellite<br />
telecommunication traffic in the ASEAN group has been<br />
projected by INTELSAT to grow to over 11,000 voice circuits<br />
by 1995, equivalent to the current use by the United States<br />
of the INTELSAT system.<br />
However the services sector is bound, world-wide, in a web<br />
of regulations and restrictions which closely control the<br />
entry into, and investment in, the services sector. This<br />
web even controls in some cases the physical delivery of<br />
services.<br />
Moreover, major exporters have demonstrated willingness to<br />
protect their service markets by bilateral agreements which<br />
by their nature are discriminatory. Clearly, it is in the<br />
interests of all nations, developed and developing alike, to<br />
ensure that the most efficient and cheapest services are<br />
available to all.<br />
Australia welcomes the historic declaration at Punta del<br />
Este that services were to be brought within the<br />
multilateral framework for the first time. In a speech I<br />
made to GATT last month at its headquarters in Geneva I put<br />
forward a set of objectives which should guide the current<br />
round of negotiations.<br />
The OECD is also examining trade in services, and Australia<br />
has been an active participant. We have a strong interest<br />
in these developments because of the opportunities they<br />
afford us to diversify further our economy and, in<br />
particular, our export sector. V<br />
This leads me to the second point which I want briefly to<br />
address: Australia's response to the challenge of the new<br />
telecommunications.<br />
Australia has had, of course, its own unique problems to<br />
solve in the telecommunications area. </p>
<p>Being a large country with a small population, with remote<br />
communities as well as highly developed and sophisticated<br />
industrial and commercial sectors to be served, we have<br />
confronted big and complex challenges.<br />
In solving those problems we have in some cases incorporated<br />
Australian developed technology. For example, Telecom's<br />
Digital Radio Concentrator System, through relay towers,<br />
provides automatic telephone services to the more isolated<br />
areas at reasonable cost.<br />
We have manufacturing facilities provided by the major<br />
corporations of Japan, North America and Europe and, I am<br />
pleased to say, increasingly from Australian firms.<br />
we have recognised the-advantages of moving to a digital<br />
telecommunications system and of establishing optical fibre<br />
cable systems as one of the most economical, reliable and<br />
flexible means of enhancing our network.<br />
Optical fibre cables are planned to cross the Australian<br />
continent from east to west and from north to south.<br />
with the recent launch of the AIJSSAT 3 satellite Australia<br />
has substantially increased its domestic satellite capacity.<br />
This will help meet the solid growth in demand for satellite<br />
services in Australia.<br />
Such developments will make the Australian<br />
telecommunications network one of the most advanced in the<br />
world. And we are taking the next step. Local telecommunications<br />
manufacturing experience has encouraged Australian firms to<br />
tender in the competitive international market. Already<br />
Australian tenders have been offered for major optical fibre<br />
contracts in India and Thailand.<br />
This process is crucial to Australia's long term<br />
development. Australia is undergoing a vital process of structural<br />
change. The rest of the world has severely marked down our<br />
natural resource-based export products. Sustaining our<br />
standard of living means developing and expanding our<br />
manufactured and services exports.<br />
The task is to guide our manufacturing and servicesv<br />
industries to be internationally competitive and export<br />
oriented. Australian telecommunications manufacturers<br />
maintain substantial interests in the region and we are<br />
looking to establish greater links with South East Asian<br />
economies. UU1-2 2U </p>
<p>In recognition of this export potential, my Government has<br />
announced an information industry strategy that aims to link<br />
companies in Australia to world markets, encourage new<br />
product development and ensure the supply of skilled<br />
workers. We will review the regulatory environment and<br />
establish an Industries Information Board to implement the<br />
strategy.<br />
We are confident that this communications export strategy<br />
will increase exports from their present level of<br />
million a year to $ 600 million a year by the middle of the<br />
next decade.<br />
Along with many other countries we are also reviewing the<br />
regulatory framework in which our telecommunications<br />
industry operates., with the objectives of bringing it up to<br />
date and of promoting efficiency.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Over the past eight years the Asia Pacific Telecommunity has<br />
been actively involved in bringing together, and making<br />
available, telecommunications specialists from within the<br />
Asia Pacific region.<br />
The organisation by the Asia-Pacific Telecommunity of<br />
seminars and workshops, visits and advice by experts and<br />
fellowships for training of personnel, provide practical<br />
co-operative assistance to the region. I am pleased that<br />
the telecommunications organisations within Australia have<br />
played their part in this process, including through<br />
traineeships, and management studies.<br />
Let me close then by wishing you every success in your<br />
discussions and in your work in your own countries at the<br />
conclusion of this meeting. </p>
