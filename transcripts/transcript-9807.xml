PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SOUTH PACIFIC NUCLEAR FREE ZONE TREATY<br />
I warmly welcome the announcements by the governments of the United States,<br />
the United Kingdom and France of their intention to sign the Protocols in the<br />
South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone ( SPNFZ) Treaty in the first half of 1996.<br />
The People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation have signed and<br />
ratified the Protocols open to them. All five nuclear weapon states have now<br />
formally recognised the desire of South Pacific countries to live in a region free<br />
of nuclear weapons and nuclear testing.<br />
There are three Protocols to the Treaty under which the nuclear weapon states<br />
agree not to use or threaten to use nuclear explosive devices against any other<br />
SPNFZ member and undertake not to test nuclear explosive devices within the<br />
territorial boundaries defined by the Treaty.<br />
Australia has worked tirelessly towards this objective, one which we have shared<br />
with the nations of the South Pacific. We took a leading role in the<br />
establishment of the SPNFZ as a means of preserving the peace and security of<br />
the region and its environment.<br />
The decisions of the governments of the United States, France and the United<br />
Kingdom will send a strong message to the international community on nonproliferation<br />
and disarmament. This will help drive negotiations for the<br />
completion of a truly Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996.<br />
In taking this welcome decision the French Government has also underlined the<br />
anomaly of its nuclear testing program in the South Pacific.<br />
Each test is an affront to the aspirations of the region embodied in the SPNFZ<br />
Treaty. France's decision will not lessen our resolve to go on campaigning actively for<br />
an immediate end to French testing.<br />
