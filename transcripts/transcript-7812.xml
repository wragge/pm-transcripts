FOR MEDIA 16 NOVEMBER 1989<br />
I am concerned that there is clearly confusion among<br />
pilots formerly employed by Ansett and Australian<br />
Airlines on certain important issues. This was evident<br />
during my discussions with a group of former pilots last<br />
Friday, and has been reinforced in a subsequent<br />
conversation involving a senior officer in my Department.<br />
The Government therefore wishes to reiterate firmly its<br />
position first on the right of pilots employed by the<br />
airlines to be represented by a union of their choice,<br />
and second on the ability of pilot employees to seek<br />
changes to the current contracts on offer.<br />
My Government has always accepted that pilot employees<br />
can be represented by a union of their choice. My<br />
Government is philosophically committed to the right of<br />
employees to be represented by unions.<br />
Which union represents pilots employed by the two<br />
airlines is a matter for those pilots themselves.<br />
Former pilots considering re-employment need have no<br />
concerns as to their right to be represented by a union,<br />
and clearly there are established procedures for any<br />
union that represents pilots employed by the airlines to<br />
put arguments as to the form of award conditions.<br />
The decision of the Industrial Relations Commission ( IRC)<br />
of 10 October, 1989 is central and quite straightforward.<br />
In that decision the IRC said that, " in our view, it<br />
would be appropriate for the AFAP to make application to<br />
be bound by th~ e awards at an appropriate time provided<br />
the bans on seeking employment with the companies are<br />
lifted, providjed that the AFAP is prepared to undertake<br />
to accept decisions of the Commission and provided the<br />
AFAP is prepared to give the, necessary undertakings<br />
required by the National Wage Case decision".<br />
Further, and relating specifically to any concerns about<br />
the current contracts or awards on offer, the Commission<br />
said " the AFAP indicated that it would wish to put<br />
arguments as to the form of any awards if it were made<br />
respondent to those awards. That opportunity would, of<br />
course, be available to the AFAP if it were successful in<br />
an application to be bound by the awards"<br />

In other words the IRC has made very clear in it's<br />
October decision how the AFAP could, if it so chose, seek<br />
to be involved in the industrial relations affairs of<br />
the airline industry. First, accept the three conditions<br />
laid down by the IRC ise. lift its bans, accept the<br />
decisions of the Commission and give the undertakings<br />
required by the National Wage Case decision no more and<br />
no less than required of any other organisation. Second,<br />
then seek to be bound by the award. Third, in those<br />
circumstances it is entirely open to the AFAP to present<br />
arguments about the award.<br />
That this opportunity and course of action-is open to the<br />
AFAP leading to the AFAP having the ability to present<br />
arguments about the award itself has clearly not got<br />
through to individual pilots. It is important that they<br />
accurately understand the position.<br />
For its part the Government has made clear that it fully<br />
accepts both the right of employees to be represented by<br />
a union of their choice and the position taken by the IRC<br />
concerning a potential role for such a union. 33 8 1<br />
