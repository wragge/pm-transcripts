PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANJSCRIPT OP-PREi~ SS CONFERENCE -KINGSTON PARK, ADELAIDE<br />
26 November 2985<br />
E u E~ P'ROOF' ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: How will you hellp Mr Bannon in the ccimpalgn?<br />
Won't you remind people of' high interest rates by comting [ 9<br />
to Adelaide?<br />
PM: No, I will, remind people of what Australia is like ira<br />
1985 compared to what iL was like in 1983. lKe came Lo office<br />
just a few months before that, Australia was irn desperate<br />
straits then. And people recognise and appreciiite what we<br />
have been able to do nationally and at this level in South<br />
Australia. JOURNALIST: Do you remember saying in Adelaide about a yeutr<br />
ago that interest rotes would fall?<br />
JOURNALIST: f don't remcmbcr everything I said iii Adelaide<br />
or elsewhere. But let me say this thaL what we have made<br />
clear is that we would adopt the policies thai dre appropriaite<br />
to the economic circumstances with which we are confronted.<br />
And adopt those policies which are necetssary to sustain thie<br />
strong rates of growth that we have had. Now, because of<br />
the pressures on the exchange rate it was necessary, not<br />
just appropriate, it was necessary to tighten monetary policy-<br />
There is no argument at allI that was necessary to sustain<br />
the dollar against t. huse pressures. And we have adopted<br />
that stance in monetary pol icy together with all the other<br />
elements in policy so that we can ensure that thte strong<br />
growth that has flowed From our' general policy stance will<br />
be maintained. And so that we will ensure that Australia<br />
maintains the beniefit of the depreciation that did in fact<br />
take place later in the year. And you have got to look in<br />
terms of economic outcome at the combination of all relevant<br />
polices. So that when you take monetary policy, wages polibY,<br />
fiscal policy together' with what we are doing generally in<br />
regard to industrial relations. All those things are Producing<br />
a continuation of high growth, thart means d continuation<br />
of further employment, reduction of unemployment, and the<br />
creation of far more opportunities for many more Australians.<br />
And that is what people jud4" us on.<br />
JOURNALIST: Primte minister, despite your criticism, isn't<br />
it true that privatisation as a policy is likely to be<br />
electoral ly appeal ing? / 2 </p>
<p>PM: Not the way it is being presented by Mr Olsen heti--because<br />
it is riddled with inconsistencies and inprdutJcal ities.<br />
If the Liberals arid the National Party want Lo yo on with<br />
this I will be very pleased. Mr UltOie will get beatert in<br />
South Australia. And if the Liberals don't learn from that<br />
and they want to continue the proposition of saying to the<br />
people of Australia that they will sell off public enterprises<br />
which will mean that those element~ s of pub~ ic enterprl'ses<br />
which are profitable will be passed over to Private enterprise J<br />
so Lhat a greater burden will be Imposed upoft t-axpayers and<br />
less services provided to the people of Australia, I hope<br />
they do it. They seem incapable of Icarning from MISLsakcs.<br />
And it looks as though that is still the case here. Perhaps<br />
after Mr Olsen gets defeated they will review their policies.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you expect some sort of resulL tonight<br />
from Mr Keating's negotiations with the Democrats on the<br />
tax package?<br />
PM: I don't know. What Paul and I have made clear is that<br />
there will be no change to the basi~ c substance arid trust<br />
of our * tax policies. We have indicated that, there may some<br />
room for sonic fine tuning but Paul and T have had a discussion<br />
about that and I don't " Ahether he will conclude those discussions<br />
this evening or not.<br />
JOURNALIST:. Prime Minister, in Brisbane two months ago you<br />
said you would consider' a reshuffle at the end of the year.<br />
Have you done that yet and will Mr Hayden be mioving from<br />
ForeignI Affairs?<br />
PM: Oh, I don't know where that came from. Let me once<br />
and for all settle this. At some stage earlier this year<br />
Bill indicated he may be interested in a domestic portfolio.<br />
And because T have, as you know, the respect 3Mr H-ayden<br />
and also, niot just respect for him, but respect for his entitlement<br />
to be listened to if he had wished to change. I had said<br />
that if he wished to, then of course I would be prepared<br />
to do that. Now he has made it clear now that he doesn't<br />
want to. Anid therefore there is no suggestion of a change<br />
for Mr Hayden...<br />
JOURNALIST: Wha. about fromn other..<br />
PM: No. No. I can't see any necd for that. They' are performing<br />
brilliantly. I mean, you watch them in the House don't you.<br />
You see the way they slather their non-existent opposition.<br />
Now they are bathing them. Each Minister, each one of<br />
them, is just slathering their opponents.<br />
JOURNALIST: So, you will qjc 1, he-nflextI. eloctioi w; tIVX blh SAIMg r.<br />
PM: I would think so. I certainly haven't got any concepts<br />
of reshuttle at this stage. Why should I? / 3<br />
* I </p>
<p>JOURNAI.. IST: How long do you think the Government will maintain<br />
a monetary policy which keeps Interest rates high? Is thert<br />
any point at which the Government will start to loosen that<br />
off when the dollar starts to appreciate?<br />
PM: We will maintain a monetary policy which is necessary<br />
to meet those objectives that I talked about before. And<br />
it is not helpful to anyone's interests for me to say well<br />
at such and such a point there will be a change. What the<br />
Australian people want from us is a continuation of the range<br />
of economic policies which have produced the results that<br />
I have talked about.' And while it is necessary to have firm<br />
monetary policy to produce those results, we will do It.<br />
And I am not going to prejudice anyone's Interests by postulating<br />
or hypothecating about some circumstances which may be down<br />
the track at some near stage or some medium stage. What<br />
they want from us is firmness in policy. They have got it,<br />
It las produced results and will continue to do It.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Cabinet yesterday decided to defer<br />
a decision on tightening up the reporting requirments for<br />
statutory authorities. Was that done with the South Australian<br />
election in mind?<br />
PM: No. We have got nothing to worry about with the Liberals'<br />
policies of privatisation. They provide us with all the<br />
ammunition we need to destroy, as I say, their Ideological<br />
garbage. It has got no substance, no point, purpose, practicality<br />
at all. It is all negatives when It Is examined. And will<br />
be seen for that. Because when we are looking at the question<br />
of requirements in regard to statutory corporations, there<br />
is a difficult range of issues that have to be taken into<br />
account. A balance between the two basic considerations<br />
of giving statutory corporations as much independence as<br />
they need, particularly those that are commerciul corporations.<br />
And also, secondly, taking into account the need for accountability<br />
to government. Now, all we have done Is that Ministers are<br />
going to consider further what was a very, very substantial<br />
submission. And they will coming back before long to the<br />
Cabinet. There Is no sense of urgency about this. There<br />
never has been.<br />
JOUKNALIST: Sir, Mr Beazley has said the submarine contracts<br />
will be awarded all over Australia? On the basis of that<br />
b-, Uhww-M. r UBannon says here I am confident I can convince Bo<br />
Hawke that we will-win.<br />
PM: No need to withdraw that advertisement. In fact, South<br />
Australians should be deeply indebted to John Bannon because<br />
without the firm submission and advocacy and exposition of<br />
John Bannon, South Australia wouldn't be the ser is contender<br />
that it can be in this issue. John Bannon is the man who<br />
single-handedly has picked up the responsibility for putting<br />
the case ot South Australia. And we take It very seriously.<br />
And as you know, at this stage, the project definition stage<br />
is being handled. We have got to wait until we get that<br />
report. But I can say that because of John Bannon's advocacy,<br />
South Australia's case will be very much to the forefront. / 4 J<br />
I </p>
<p>JOURNALITST: If there is a Liberal Government, after' the next<br />
state election, will that. position of South Australia be<br />
diminfi shed?<br />
PM: Well, let me say this. That there is no Libeu~-al, and<br />
particularly Mr Olsen. who could match Mr Bannion as an advocate<br />
for this state.<br />
JOURNAL. IST: But. would South Australia's position be diminished? P<br />
PM: Let me make iL clear Lhat when I got elected with my<br />
Government in March ot ' 83, we said that we were a government<br />
for all Australians. Anid we have been. For Tasmarijans<br />
and Queenslanders, as for' others. I don't take the view<br />
of some Liberal politicians that you reward or punish according I<br />
to how people have voted. Let me, having said that, let<br />
me make it clear that IL is John Bannon who has been the<br />
one who has picked up this case. Here, overseas, there is<br />
no-one in South Australia who knows as much about this issue<br />
both in terms of its Australian ramifications and internationally,<br />
as John Bannon. There is no-one who could put the case as<br />
well as 3ohni Bannon-.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, tomorrow's Bulletin poll shows a<br />
drop of 6% of Mr Howard's approval rating.<br />
PM: Does it? How do you know?<br />
JOURNALIST: S; o I am led to be) ieve. iI<br />
PM; Do you believe everything you are told?<br />
JOURNALlST: Almost.<br />
FM: 1, et me say, i should do.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well assuming it docs. What would you say that<br />
means for Mr Howard's sur-vival?<br />
PM: Well, you know they are keeping a scorecard on him.<br />
The chief scorecard keeper is Michael Hodgman. And I believe,<br />
and I don't pretend that my avenues of information into the<br />
Liberal Party are necessarily as good as others, but what<br />
regard as pretty reliable information, I understand thatV<br />
in recent weeks the best score that Michael has given John<br />
is 2 out of 10. So there is not much lower that he can go<br />
in the markings of his colleagues. But, I am not here to<br />
gloat about the demise of this once great party. Its descent<br />
into the most bitter factionalism that has been in Australia's<br />
politics for very many years. They make the Labor Party<br />
look like amateurs when it comes to factionalism. The hatred<br />
that is evident in Canberra now, between Liberals and National<br />
Party. I have not seen the like of it. And people who have<br />
been around far 30 years say they have never seen anything<br />
like it. So, if what You say is right, then it is going<br />
to exacerbate that bitterness arid that, hatred. And put back<br />
even further what we are all hoping for and that is perhaps<br />
the emergence of some policies, some principles. They are<br />
absolutely lacking in principles, policies and leadership. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: You arc gpLt. ing un easy ride out of it though.<br />
aren't you?<br />
PM: We are getting thie ride thatL we deserve because of tho<br />
results that wt-. hflave produced in this country. That is one<br />
fact. or which Is producing the attitude which is true in politics.<br />
Th1U assessment that is made Is a combination of how they<br />
judge you positively i recgard to what you are doing. And<br />
how they look at the alternative. And the alternative is<br />
pathetic. They got rid of Andrew because he wasn't a man<br />
of principle anrid policy. That. was John Howard u<br />
hie has yut no principles, he has got no policies. Well,<br />
they lidve got less principles and less policies than they<br />
had before. And they obviously have got no talent there<br />
at all. ruthing to turn to. So. I just don't know what they<br />
are going to do. But I don't want to pretend that I am taking<br />
up a great ded] of Lime trying to think of answers for them.<br />
