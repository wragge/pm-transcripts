_,, AUSTRALIAL<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS AUGUST 24, 1976<br />
ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS ( NORTHERN TERRITORY) BILL 1976<br />
The Defence Force Ombudsman, Mr David Hay, has been asked<br />
to analyse the written representations received by the<br />
Government on the Aboriginal Land Rights ( Northern Territory)<br />
Bill 1976, which was presented to the Parliament on 4 June 1976.<br />
In his Second Reading' Speech, the Minister for Aboriginal<br />
Affairs said that the Government intended that the Bill should be<br />
available for public scrutiny by the Aboriginal people and others<br />
in the Northern Territory and elsewhere, before it was debated<br />
further in the House. Mr Viner said that all representations<br />
would be taken into account in arriving at the final form of<br />
the legislation.<br />
Mr Hay will not receive representations direct but will be<br />
given copies of all representations to the Minister for Aboriginal<br />
Affairs and other Ministers.<br />
Mr Hay has been asked to report on them no later than the end<br />
of September. Further debate on the Bill will not be deferred<br />
any longer than necessary and the Government is anxious to<br />
secure the Bill's passage during the Budget Session. </p>
