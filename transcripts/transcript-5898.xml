AUST AI1A&amp;<br />
FOR MEIDIA FRIDAY, 27 A. UGUST 1982<br />
The a'ttached letter has been sent today to the Premier<br />
of Victoria, Mr Cain. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA<br />
27 August 1982<br />
My dear Premier<br />
Interim Report No. 4 of the Royal Commission on the<br />
activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers<br />
Union again brings starkly to public notice the extent<br />
of criminal activities, particularly in Victoria, of<br />
members of that Union.<br />
I mention briefly some of what Hr Costigan has had<br />
to say on this occasion:<br />
in Victoria the Union is under the control<br />
of hardened criminals'. ( Paragraph 7.02)<br />
there has been... . some 15 murders that. took place<br />
between 1970 and 1979. The two worst years were<br />
1971, when three murders took place and 1979 when<br />
four took place". ( Paragraph 5.06)<br />
" Their answer to any-interference with' their<br />
activities is not to use the processes of the<br />
law but rather threats;' violence and intimidation"<br />
( Paragraph 4.14)<br />
I am concerned, as I am sure all other Australians are,<br />
that the criminal justice system does not seem to have<br />
been able to stamp out the notorious criminal activities<br />
of members of the Union.<br />
In its response to Interim Report No. 4, the Commonwealth<br />
has announced its intention to appoint a Special<br />
Prosecutor, assisted by a task force, to pursue prosecution<br />
of persons involved in the promotion and execution of<br />
" bottom of the harbour" tax fraud schemes. The<br />
Commonwealth Attorney-General also advised the acting<br />
Victorian Attorney-General on 24 August that the<br />
Commonwealth agrees thil. the task force be established<br />
jointly with your State.<br />
Mr Costigan has proponc'd t-here be! a special group to<br />
pursue prosecutio~ n to suppress the crimi~ nai activities<br />
he has brought to notice. The Commonwealth stands<br />
ready to participate in such a group. The Attorney-General<br />
has announced his intention to discuss the matter with<br />
Mr Costigan and with your Government.<br />
The public apprehension that has been displayed following / 2 </p>
<p>release of Volume 1 of interim Report No. 4 has clearly<br />
demonstrated the need for decisive action against the<br />
violence and illegal activities of the painters and<br />
dockers. As their crimes of violence clearly fall within<br />
State jurisdiction, I raise with you whether or not<br />
your Government might wish to initiate similar action<br />
in Victoria to that which the Commonwealth has taken<br />
in relation to tax fraud schemes.<br />
If your Government did decide that such action is called<br />
for but found difficulties in assembling the necessary<br />
resources, the Commonwealth would be prepared to give<br />
sympathetic consideration to any request for assistance.<br />
I should appreciate advice as to the Victorian Government's<br />
thinking on this matter. Yours sincerely<br />
( Maltolm Fraser)<br />
The Hon John Cain, MLA<br />
Premier of Victoria<br />
MELBOURNE Vic 3000 </p>
