FORX MEDIA MONDAY, JUNE 2 1980<br />
ADDRESS AT THE AUSTRALIA-JAPAN SYMPOSIUM<br />
I welcome the opportunity to join this symposium. Its very<br />
convening is evidence of the importance of the relationship<br />
between Australia and Japan.<br />
I congratulate Nihon Keizai Shimbun and the Australian Financial<br />
Review for their support. Both newspapers have made an important<br />
and valuable contribution to the mutal understanding of Japan<br />
and Australia and to the analysis of the direction that our<br />
relationship has taken.<br />
This sympos-ium is being held against a background of international<br />
tension which is particularly manifest in Iran and A'%. ghanistan.<br />
We need to discuss the Australia-Japan relationship against this<br />
background and with the knowledge of major world events.<br />
The current political situation in Iran poses the serious<br />
danger of instability and national fragmentation. It constitutes<br />
a threat, not only to the continued supply of Iranian oil,<br />
but also to the availability of petroleum resources from<br />
other Middle East countries.<br />
The disturbing breakdown in relations between the new regime<br />
in. Iran and the United States a breakdown which culminated<br />
in the Iranian seizure of American hostages in Teheran on<br />
November 7 has generated a new source of tension in an already<br />
unstable and strategically vital region.<br />
In the neighbouring Islamic country of Afghanistan, the brutal<br />
and unprovoked Soviet invasion has brought about a new dimension<br />
to East West relations. For the first time, Soviet main forces<br />
are"' directly involved in military operations against a non-aligned,<br />
third world country. Yet this is happening against the 1972<br />
Soviet-American agree~ ment to declared principles, which emphasised<br />
the need to avoid a breakdown in super power relations by one<br />
power seeking unilateral advantage at the expense of the other.<br />
These basic principles of relations between the U. S. A and U. S. S. R.<br />
were grouped under the concept of detente a word which<br />
specifically implied the lessening of international tensions.<br />
The notion of detente incorporated principles which extended<br />
beyond the avoidance of potential conflict to the belief that<br />
idleological differences should not be an impediment to harmonious<br />
relations. This hope, though still al~ ive in the West, has been<br />
compromised by the behaviour of the Soviet Union. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Those who felt that detente meant the search for security from<br />
nuclear war and the relaxation of political and military tension,<br />
have been forced to recognise that those expectations have not<br />
been matched by reality. In retrospect, it could be argued that<br />
detente gave rise to expectations that were not fully justified.<br />
As far back as September 1968, an authoritative article in<br />
" Pravda" had made it clear that:<br />
" The sovereignty of individual Socialist countries<br />
must not run counter to the interests the world<br />
revolutionary movement".<br />
Subsequently, speaking on Moscow radio on November 12, 1968,<br />
President Brezhnev outlined the extent to which the Soviet Union<br />
would go to protect Socialism, when he said:<br />
establishment and defence of the sovereignty<br />
of states which have embarked along the road to building<br />
Socialism is of particular significance for us Communists".<br />
Here is explicit proof of the Soviet determination that once a<br />
country adopts Socialism, it will be prevented by the Soviet Union<br />
from ever throwing off its shackles. And none of these views have<br />
been modified by detente.<br />
President Brezhev himself has made it clear that detente:<br />
. doesn't in the slightest abolish, nor can it<br />
abolish or alter the laws of the class struggle".<br />
These statements seek to justify the active and open pursuing<br />
of Soviet international influence through destabilising activities<br />
in Angola, Ethopia, Yemen and Vietnam. They seek to explain why<br />
the use of 85,000 Russian soldiers in a brutal expression of the<br />
sovereignty of Afghanistan is consistent with detente. They seek<br />
to suggest why, under detente, the defence capability of the<br />
Soviet Union has expanded so greatly. But these explanations<br />
are poor solace to the over 3 million refugees created by<br />
Soviet action since the detente accord.<br />
Qui. te clearly, * the " Brezhev doctrine" is still the guiding<br />
principle of Soviet foreign policy and its interpretation may<br />
go beyond what is generally believed.<br />
This geo-political position has created international anxiety<br />
heightened by the economic dislocation which has resulted from<br />
the uncertainty of oil supplies and the massive increase in the<br />
price of oil. This disturbing accumulation of factors creates<br />
a background in which the relationship between Australia and<br />
Japan gains in significance. Central to this relationship in thle<br />
decades ahead, willbe the energy question. We entered the<br />
with many world economies dependent on imported oil. Recent events<br />
have underlined, if emphasis were needed, the significant political<br />
and economic dangers inherent in such dependence. For example,<br />
Japan relies for almost all of her oil requirements on imports. About<br />
come from the Middle East. As a result, restrfcted supply<br />
or unreasonably high prices of oil, will lead to adjustment in<br />
the Japanese economy. / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
As one of Japan's principal trading partners, particularly in<br />
raw materials and energy resources, Australia hopes to contribute to<br />
overcoming her energy problems. Nevertheless, for all countries,<br />
there is a need to seek alternative energy sources and to improve<br />
conservation. Japan has, in this process, the asset of being a modest per<br />
capita consumer of energy. It also has a proven capacity for<br />
industrial innovation which will facilitate the necessary<br />
restructuring of its industries. Fortunately, the surge in<br />
oil prices in 1979 has not been accompanied by severe shortages<br />
of oil. In fact, developments in the past several months have<br />
increased stocks of oil globally. This has meant some softening<br />
in spot prices with the result that, during April, Japan was able<br />
to make the difficult. decision to refuse Iranian oil at an<br />
unacceptably high price..<br />
This decision represents a significant encouragement to the<br />
efforts of other oil consuming countries to resist excessive<br />
oil prices. Complementing this international example, has<br />
been the decision by the Japanese government, and its Olympic<br />
Federation, not to go to Moscow. This decision demonstrates,<br />
in the most practical way, Japan's determination to contribute<br />
towards efforts by independently minded countries to protest<br />
against naked Soviet expansion. Indeed, there has been an<br />
encouraging affinity of view between the Australian and<br />
Japanese governments on the emerging international problems.<br />
This does not meanthat Japan and Australia always have identical<br />
views or interests. But there are several important political<br />
and economic perceptions that we share. The first is that<br />
we choose to be governed by democratic principles and maintain<br />
similar institutions and laws to safeguard our political freedom<br />
and reinforce social justice. The second is that, through the<br />
natural complementarity of our two economies, we enjoy a high<br />
degree of economic inter-dependence.<br />
This inter-dependence continues to widen as new areas of trade<br />
develop. The most recent, and perhaps the most challenging,<br />
is Japan's growing need for alternative forms of energy, providing<br />
as it does growing opportunity for Australia to utilise her<br />
privileged energy position.<br />
Third, through extensive bi-lateral aid programmes,<br />
both Australia and Japan are closely committed to supporting<br />
developing countries and their aspirations for self-reliance and<br />
stability.<br />
We are also major contributors to international financial<br />
institutions upon which the countries of the third world rely for<br />
development capital.<br />
Fourth, because we are both countries of the Pacific, we have, a<br />
mutual interest in the peace, prosperity, and well-being of all.<br />
countries in the region. We share in the current economic growth<br />
and enormous Potential of many of the nations of the Pacific.<br />
And because of the importance of the integrity and strength of<br />
the Association ' of the Soaith East Asian Nations, buth our countries<br />
have developed patterns of consultation with ASEAN nations on a<br />
wide range Of Political and economic matters. Australia and Japan<br />
are fully developing their credentials as nations contributing<br />
in a constructive way to the well-being of the Pacific. </p>
<p>4<br />
Finally, we are each aligned to our most important mutual ally, the<br />
United States of America, through security alliances,<br />
through long standing historical ties, and through the active<br />
and lively appreciation of common values.<br />
All these links re-emphasise our mutually compatible<br />
interests and common objectives in contributing to a stable<br />
environment for economic growth within our region. And this<br />
region already promises new opportunities for us in the 80' s.<br />
Its economic potential is great, and its prospects for continuing<br />
development are encouraging. The economies of East and South-East<br />
Asia are amongst the most rapidly growing in the world, with<br />
regional growth recently ranging from 7-12% per annum..<br />
The continuing comparative strengthl of the Japanese economy,<br />
as well as the industrial progress, achieved by the " newly<br />
industrialising countries"; and to a lesser extent other<br />
ASEAN members, based generally on export led strategies;<br />
all these factors have contributed to spectacular growth and<br />
trade expansion in the region.<br />
This growth-will be the source in the future of new<br />
opportunities for both our countries. I emphasise five points<br />
which I believe are of particular importance to the future<br />
development of the relationship between our two countries.<br />
First, we confirm our readiness, within the capacity permitted<br />
by our resources, to assist Japan and other countries to meet<br />
their energy needs.<br />
Second, we welcome investment by Japan in partnership with<br />
Australian investors. In 1979, Japan was Australia's third largest<br />
source of foreign investment, after Britain and the United States.<br />
And recent major investments include the 50% shareholding of a<br />
consortium of five Japanese aluminium users in the Comalco<br />
aluminium smelter project in Gladstone; the 20% interest held by<br />
M~ itsui in the $ 700 million Nebo coking/ steaming coal project;<br />
the purchase of Chrysler Australia by Mitsubishi, representing<br />
a significant . injection of capital and expertise into our<br />
important mot-or-vehicle industry.<br />
The Australian Government continues, within our foreign<br />
investment guidel. ines, to welcome Japanese investment, whether<br />
it be in the mineral area, the manufacturing industry, or in the<br />
services sector.<br />
Third, in the context of our overall economic relations, there is<br />
a clear necessity to enter into long term commitments. This<br />
reo~ uirement is borne out by the very high cost of resource projects<br />
and infrastructure developments; by the risks associated with<br />
continuing problems of international inflation and protectionism;<br />
and by the high degree of complementarity between our two economies. </p>
<p>For example, the immense North West Shelf project presents<br />
the particular problem of the need for expensive facilities<br />
both in Australia and in Japan, which are only viable if long<br />
term demand can be guaranteed. This project would never have<br />
come to fruition without a long term commitment from our Japanese<br />
customers. Fourth, we expect to see substantial expansion of raw material<br />
Processing in Australia. This has long been our objective.<br />
Energy costs and the availability of relatively low cost coal<br />
for energy in Australia, make this objective more easily obtainable.<br />
Aluminium smelting is a prime example of this process gaining<br />
momentum; and the onset of increased oil prices makes the<br />
prospect of processing raw materials in Australia even more<br />
attractive. Rising oil coats have also added to the cost of<br />
shipping which in turn has provided the necessary inducement<br />
to process raw materials in Austra~ lia, leaving the less<br />
weighty processed product to be shipped.<br />
The fifth and newest area for co-operation is in energy research<br />
and development. There is scope for further examination of<br />
alternative uses for coal and gas; and the development of new<br />
and renewable energy sources. Already, negotiations are under<br />
way to establish a science and technology agreement between<br />
Australia and Japan. This institutional base will re-inforce<br />
efforts for the exchange of research and development.<br />
And above all, both our governments are conscious that<br />
economic co-operation will only be beneficial in an economic<br />
environment characterised by consistent and stable policies;<br />
particularly policies directed to the containment of inflation;<br />
the encouragement of investment; and the ! 3ecuring~ of increased<br />
employnment opportunities.<br />
Beyond all this, one of the central commitments of both our<br />
countries in the ' 80s must be to ensure that the -expanding<br />
importance of the Australia-Japan relationship enjoys the full support<br />
of Australian and Japanese people. The Australian Government<br />
is fully committed to recent initiatives designed to give the<br />
people-to-people relationship the strength and understanding<br />
that exists at a government-to-government level.<br />
That is why we have welcomed the interim agreement for<br />
the reduction of air fares, and have encouraged the progress<br />
towards an agreement for the exchange of young people on working<br />
holidavs. These initiatives complement others which are already<br />
w~ ell established.<br />
In '-particular, the wide range of activities sponsored by the<br />
Australia Japan Foundation, and the research work done under<br />
the auspices of the Australia Japan and West--ern Pacific<br />
Economi1c Relations research project, have all contributed<br />
sign Lficantly in recent times to the strong ties which<br />
have de. veloped between our two countries.<br />
These are reinforced by the institutional machinery which provides<br />
for a wide range of minist.-rial and official consultations.<br />
We regret that, as aresult of impending elections in Japan,<br />
it will not be possible to hold the next Australia-Japan Ministerial<br />
Committee Meeting in Tokyo on the 9th and 10th of June. / G. </p>
<p>-6<br />
However, when the opportunity arises, these talks will go ahead.<br />
They are becoming an integral part of our continuing and<br />
established working relationship in the political as wellas the<br />
economic area.<br />
Looking beyond our relationship, over the past year or so we<br />
have witnessed a growing momentum of interest in the prospects<br />
for enhanced co-operation around the Pacific region. This has<br />
been most recently stimulatedby the enthusiasm expressed by<br />
Mr Ohira for the concept of a Pacific community. The notion<br />
of a Pacific grouping to promote greater co-operation has been<br />
advanced in one form or another by academics and businessmen<br />
for the last decade and a half.<br />
What is new, however, is the increasing focus which governments<br />
of the region have been giving to the area. This interest is<br />
not based on thegeographic neatness of such an arrangement.<br />
For if it were, an arrangement of this kind surely would have come<br />
to being long before now. In fact, the disparate nature of<br />
Pacific countries has hitherto inhibited European-type moves.<br />
towards closer co-operation.<br />
Butnew elements have lent impetus to calls for a Pacific community.<br />
While resource endowment and economic development amongst these<br />
countries are not evenly shared, the Pacific region has experienced<br />
remarkable and sustained economic growth.<br />
It contains five of the world's major food exporters, and<br />
substantial percentages of the world market economies' total<br />
production of a number of key commodities. Regional growth<br />
has been paralleled by increasing economic inter-dependence.<br />
Transportation and communication links have improved substantially.<br />
And regional states have extended national sovereignty over<br />
marine resources of the Pacific Ocean through the declaration<br />
of the 200 mile fisheries and economic zones.<br />
These developments are fast breaking down the barriers of the<br />
past, increasing the areas of; common interest and making the<br />
need for enhanced co-operation more compelling. No one Y. et has<br />
a clear idea of what form such co-operation may take whether<br />
we should seek new arrangements or build upon existing mechanisms.-<br />
An exploratory process is just beginning. The various ideas being<br />
floated need to be carefully examined and tested. The differing<br />
interests and concerns of the countries of the region need to be<br />
fully taken into account. Early last month, I attended a<br />
gathering of businessmen from around the Pacific held in Sydneythe<br />
annual meeting of the Pacif ic Basin Economic Council which<br />
made an important contribution to the consideration of regional<br />
co-operation.<br />
In September, a major non-governmental regional seminar,<br />
which I announced during Mr Ohira's visit earlier this year,<br />
will be held at the Australian National University in Canberra,<br />
to focus directly on the Pacific community concept. It is clear that,<br />
giv,. nthe complexities involved, the development of the concept<br />
is likely to occur gradually rather than overnight.<br />
The fact is, however, that -the future of the countries of the Pacific<br />
inevitably involves increased contact and it is desirable to take<br />
a positive and intelligent approach to that. / 17 </p>
<p>7<br />
Our ambition must be to fully reap the benefit of the enormous<br />
opportunities which the Pacific area is opening up, and thereby,<br />
to contribute to greater peace, prosperity and harmony throughout the<br />
region. There is no doubt that these goals will be advanced through<br />
a forum such as this. Thatis 7hy I congratulate the organisers<br />
of this seminar for the important contribution it will make to<br />
a better understanding and awareness of the growing links and<br />
friendship between our two countries.<br />
I am confident also thatyour findings will be of real value and<br />
significance, not only to the future development of our<br />
relationship, but also to the Pacific region as a whole.<br />
We must never take for granted the need at all levels to be<br />
well informed about what each of us is doing. Forums such as this<br />
provide a profitable opportunity for Australians to develop more<br />
fully an understanding of the concerns and interests of our<br />
Japanese and regional partners.<br />
Again, I express my warm appreciation to the managements<br />
of both newspapers for their continued and substantial reporting<br />
on the broad range of issues in the Australia-Japan relationship.<br />
May all who are participating in this symposium enjoy success<br />
from your deliberations. ~ CI </p>
