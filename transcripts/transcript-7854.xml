TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH IAN McMINN, RADIO 3AW,<br />
MELBOURNE 11 DECEMBER 1989<br />
E &amp; 0E -PROOF ONLY<br />
McMINN: Good morning Prime minister, not 21 that's for<br />
sure. PM: A bit more than that mate.<br />
McMINN: How was your birthday bash?<br />
PM: It was good. We saw a lot of old friends stretching<br />
way back some I went to school with and some I haven't<br />
seen for some time. It was a very very happy and rather<br />
long night.<br />
McMINN: A rather long night? Not like the old days?<br />
PM: I beg your pardon?<br />
McMINN: Not like the old days?<br />
PM: Not for me, it was for some.<br />
McMINN: Anyway, thanks very much for joining me on the<br />
program. PM: Pleasure Ian.<br />
McMINN: First up I guess the one issue that could or would<br />
stop you being re-elected and that's interest rates, as it<br />
affects both home-owners and also small business. In fact I<br />
looked at an editorial, Prime Minister, in yesterday's Sun<br />
Herald where it says that it attacks the very cornerstone of<br />
your Government's success in regard to jobs because as<br />
interest rates stay high then people will eventually have to<br />
lay off workers. </p>
<p>PM: Well, the employment figures are still good. We've had<br />
another significant increase in employment in the last<br />
month's figures and a reduction of unemployment below the<br />
six per cent mark and participation rates at their highest<br />
ever. So at this stage what seems to be happening is that<br />
there is a lowering of activity in some areas but it is not<br />
yet reflected in a decline in employment and what we're<br />
trying to achieve is what they say in the jargon a soft<br />
landing so that we can ease off the level of activity, most<br />
importantly therefore, imports, while still having<br />
sufficient growth to maintain employment. Now that's the<br />
picture that seems to be emerging and it's going to be a<br />
fine act of political and economic judgement to get that<br />
just right, but I believe we will.<br />
McMINN: Do you ever get sick and tired of saying that, I<br />
mean, you've been saying that now for some months? That<br />
PM: No<br />
McMINN: if soft landing maybe?<br />
PM: Well, if it's right, if it's what you're about you<br />
can't have a different story every day. You've got to call<br />
it as it is and that's the way it is Ian.<br />
McMINN: And what about small business?<br />
PM: Small business is participating and it has been a major<br />
participant in the facts of the seven years of this<br />
Government, including the most recent period. And those<br />
facts are very simple a rate of economic growth twice as<br />
fast as in the previous seven years, a rate of employment<br />
growth five times as fast. So they have been great<br />
beneficiaries of the doubled rate of economic growth and the<br />
higher rate of employment. And, equally therefore, they<br />
must be participants in the decision now which involves some<br />
slowing down of activity. You can't be in it at all the<br />
buoyant, expanding times and expect to be opted out by the<br />
Government at the stages where you have to restrain activity<br />
a bit.<br />
McMINN: In 1983 you welded together a number of interest<br />
groups, one of which was small business, and now they're<br />
crying out they're saying that they're going broke. </p>
<p>PM: Of course when you say they are crying out, they are<br />
going broke, you can't have a situation where the economy is<br />
still growing, and employment still growing, and having<br />
every small business going broke. The fact is of course<br />
that for all business, large and small, there is some<br />
pressure from tight monetary policy and that's why it's<br />
there. Not to have a position where it is easier to grow.<br />
What we're doing at the moment is deliberately, in the<br />
interest of Australians now and in the future, is to lower<br />
the level of economic activity because we can't sustain the<br />
level of imports. Now that's what the policy is about to<br />
lower the level of activity and so, obviously, that puts<br />
some pressure on, that's what the policy is about.<br />
McMINN: What about the pilots, I mean you made the point<br />
earlier on you can't be in it sometimes and out of it other<br />
times, and then as late as last Thursday you were talking<br />
about the fact that you'd be urging the airlines to forego<br />
their damages claim. Now we hear from Brian McCarthy again<br />
today that all's not well in the IRC and, you know, we can't<br />
see an end to it again.<br />
PM: Well, that's from Mr McCarthy's point of view all may<br />
not be well. The simple fact that Brian McCarthy has to<br />
understand is that there can't be one set of rules for his<br />
organisation and one for everyone else. The Commission is<br />
saying there are three conditions under which Mr McCarthy's<br />
Federation can have the opportunity of being part of the<br />
action. I will just remind you that they are the ones that<br />
apply to everyone else. Firstly, that the bans on the<br />
employment of his members being lifted, that applies to<br />
everyone, no union can be involved in the processes who've<br />
got that situation. So exactly the same lift their bans<br />
on the employment of their members. Secondly, that they<br />
accept the decisions of the Commission, the same as for<br />
everyone else. And third, that they accept the principles<br />
of the National Wage case guidelines, the same as for<br />
everyone else. So what Mr McCarthy must understand and that<br />
no-one is saying to him, and certainly not me, but more<br />
importantly it's the Commission. No special problems or<br />
difficulties or conditions for you, just that you accept the<br />
conditions that apply to everyone else.<br />
McMINN: But was it out of character I know you've been<br />
asked this by people within your party and certainly<br />
commentators have made this type of judgement as well that<br />
in 1983 you were the great conciliator, the good bloke if<br />
you like, and all of a sudden we had a different side of Bob<br />
Hawke PM: It's not a different side at all<br />
McMINN: it's war? </p>
<p>PM: It's a grossly inadequate analysis<br />
McMINN: When you say it's war.<br />
PM: But why don't you give the whole instead of for<br />
your own purposes. You're trying to get an argument going<br />
with a grin on your face. You only quote part of it. The<br />
full quote, of course, was that I was saying to them not<br />
only directly at them in that quote as I did, but through<br />
intermediaries then and during the dispute I was saying,<br />
look, for God's sake, don't pursue this course of action,<br />
don't declare that you are going to take everyone on. The<br />
employers, the Commission, the Government, the trade union<br />
movement operate within the system If however you are<br />
going to say that you are going to set your sights on<br />
destroying everyone else, then it's war. Not of my<br />
choosing. What I was seeking and choosing was the processes<br />
of conciliation and arbitration, in the system. I said it's<br />
only if you are going to take on everyone else then<br />
understand that it is war in those circumstances. We are<br />
not going to lay back and have the system destroyed. They'd<br />
better understand that. Now, that's what I've asked all the<br />
way through that should happen. I hope that now that the<br />
position is quite clear that the airlines are going to<br />
restore full operations, I hope that the Federation will<br />
make the decision to come back into the arbitration system<br />
so that in some way they may perhaps be able to look after<br />
that number of their members for whom there will be jobs.<br />
McMINN: Were you told at that time, way back when, that the<br />
dispute may only last about three or four weeks<br />
PM: What has happened of course is that once the AFAP the<br />
Federation of Airline Pilots once they made the decision<br />
to instruct their members to resign then you were into a new<br />
situation. It wasn't the same dispute. Because when you<br />
had the employer and the union in dispute then that was one<br />
thing. Once the airline pilots' organisation instructed<br />
their pilots to resign, then the airlines had none of their<br />
members employed. And that's what I meant you moved into<br />
a new situation because what was involved then was the<br />
rebuilding of the airlines without the AFAP. That was a<br />
quite different situation. That first stage was over,<br />
you've moved into one then which is going on now, which<br />
everyone accepts is going to move to completion, that is<br />
McMINN: One day. </p>
<p>PM: The fact is that you will have the airlines operating<br />
normally as you go into 1990. That is normal in terms of<br />
being able to cater, through their regular services, with<br />
the demand that's made upon them. That's what is going to<br />
happen and that's why I've said, I said the other day, now<br />
look I don't want damages collected from the AFAP. What I<br />
want to see is the airline industry operating not just<br />
normally as measured by services available to meet demand<br />
but I also want a situation in which there can be as much<br />
industrial harmony as possible. You are not going to have<br />
that if you impose damages upon the union. I've never<br />
wanted that but the important part of the case that was<br />
taken, which I supported, was that you had an independent<br />
judicial assessment by a judge of the Supreme Court as to<br />
what the facts of the case were. And it totally destroyed<br />
the totally untrue claims that were made by the Federation<br />
and its leadership that here was a conspiracy by the<br />
Government and the airlines. The finding of the judge of<br />
the Supreme Court was it was the Federation that was<br />
spoiling for the fight, not the Government and the airlines.<br />
McMINN: Just looking at Victoria right now, you're right in<br />
the middle of all sorts of problems in terms of public<br />
transport. Now obviously that's not your responsibility<br />
although there has been comments by Gerry Hand, a former<br />
State President of the Labor Party here, saying that it<br />
could have a backlash federally and clearly there's a number<br />
of marginal seats that Labor must win if you are to retain<br />
Government. Does it concern you that you've got this sort<br />
of problem continuing?<br />
PM: I'd rather obviously not have the problem in any State.<br />
Before you go to a federal election you like it all to be a<br />
bed of roses, no problems at all. That's a fact a life.<br />
Now I don't intrude into the Victorian State situation when<br />
it's a matter of State responsibility. I do hope and trust<br />
that these issues will be resolved as soon as possible, and<br />
that's not just because there will be a federal election<br />
next year, but just because of the issues themselves. I<br />
hope and trust and believe that they will be resolved. And<br />
in regard to Gerry Hand, you mentioned Gerry, well the<br />
difficulty obviously there is that he's both a Minister in<br />
the Federal Government and also has his constituency in the<br />
area very much in question. Now I hope that it will be<br />
resolved in a way which doesn't involve a continuing problem<br />
for Gerry Hand in his dual capacity.<br />
McMINN: So clearly it's something that you wouldn't<br />
entertain going on for a whole lot longer?<br />
PM: I hope it doesn't go on for a lot longer, no. </p>
<p>McMINN: Child poverty and we're getting all these ones<br />
out of the way child poverty, that statement of yours in<br />
1987, has it caused you moments when you wished you'd have<br />
said it another way?<br />
PM: I did in fact, of course, in the full statement that<br />
was issued with the election speech that I delivered the<br />
full statement was that there would be no financial need for<br />
any child to live in poverty. And obviously it would have<br />
been better in hindsight if that full passage that was in<br />
the written, distributed text was the one that was actually<br />
used. But it's very important to notice that those who are<br />
in fact directly concerned are the ones that have indicated<br />
that the Prime Minister delivered on the p romise that he<br />
made. Let's just, without burdening you with a whole lot of<br />
quotes, but just let me give you a couple of references.<br />
The Australian Institute of Family Studies have referred to<br />
the fact that my promise was that we would make the family<br />
allowance supplements increased in percentage terms to the<br />
married pension rate and they said, and I quote them: " By<br />
these means the Government's pledge to meet the benchmarks<br />
has been met. The new levels of family allowance<br />
supplements represent rises in real terms since 1983/ 4 of 41<br />
per cent for younger children and 203 per cent for older<br />
children over the previous family income supplement<br />
payments. For low income families, especially, the decision<br />
of the Government to annually adjust all family related<br />
payments in accordance with movements in the Consumer Price<br />
Index is the most significant long term reform of the tax<br />
package." And Bishop Hollingworth on the 7th of May in<br />
strict income security terms: " Ilt is true that the Prime<br />
Minister's promise that no children shall live in poverty by<br />
1990 will be achieved. This represents significant<br />
progress." Perhaps most importantly, in terms of the<br />
miserable politics of the Opposition on this, Bishop Peter<br />
Hollingworth stated in August of this year that the<br />
Government had made real advances in recent years in<br />
building a more secure and adequate system of income support<br />
for Australians living close to or below the poverty line.<br />
He said this: " These reforms are too important to be caught<br />
in the crossfire of political conflict. The Opposition<br />
ought to openly acknowledge the merit of such reforms and<br />
move towards a more bipartisan stance on welfare policies<br />
for children." So those in the area know that the promise<br />
that there would be no financial need for children to live<br />
in poverty they are asserting that that promise has been<br />
delivered and they are criticising the Opposition for their<br />
miserable attitude and opportunism in this matter. Quite<br />
rightly so I might say too. </p>
<p>McMINN: Yet of course you've got a report yesterday coming<br />
out from the Sydney City Mission talking about 500,000<br />
children who are still living in poverty and a quote from a<br />
Mr Ken Harrison there: " I applaud the Prime Minister's<br />
sentiments", in regard to what you just said, " however the<br />
reality has not been reached."<br />
PM: What we are saying is that what you deliver in respect<br />
of children is a very very substantial increase in financial<br />
outlays to lower income families via the family allowance<br />
supplement so that in respect of children the benchmarks<br />
that were agreed by the people from the same sector that<br />
this spokesman is about we didn't just say here are the<br />
benchmarks, as a proportion of the pension, which will meet<br />
the target of payments to look after the needs of children.<br />
We did it in consultation with these people. It was agreed<br />
that if these family allowance supplements amounts paid to<br />
into the families for their kids, if those payments are met,<br />
they will represent the amount to deal with the needs of<br />
children in those circumstances. Now, that has been done.<br />
That doesn't mean, as I've said in my meeting with the<br />
Australian Council of Social Service not long ago, that<br />
doesn't mean that there are not other elements that relate<br />
to poverty. What we were about was the actual financial<br />
payments that would meet the needs of children. Let me just<br />
again quote so that we can pick up the point to which you<br />
referred the ACOSS on the 3rd of October put out its news<br />
release and in it they say: " The Government's initiatives<br />
on child poverty have been of considerable benefit. The<br />
financial benchmarks for children which the Government set<br />
have been met and ahead of target. ACOSS congratulates the<br />
Government on setting and achieving these standards." But<br />
they then go on, and this is important in relation to what<br />
you were saying: " The Prime Minister is correct to say that<br />
he has achieved the financial benchmarks for children and<br />
this is a major achievement." And remember, this is the<br />
Australian Council of Social Service saying that.<br />
" However", they say, " it is also clear that poverty has not<br />
been eradicated in our society. The Prime Minister in his<br />
speech to us acknowledged that there is more to poverty than<br />
just income. Poverty is also about a lack of access to<br />
adequate housing, health care, education and jobs." They<br />
conclude by saying that I'd indicated to them that I'd " work<br />
with them and other organisations in addressing this broader<br />
agenda. We welcome his determination to seriously tackle<br />
these issues in a comprehensive way." And since then, just<br />
the week before last, I met with ACOSS in Sydney to address<br />
these other aspects which go to poverty, the ones that they<br />
mentioned. But in welcoming the fact that I'm meeting with<br />
them to deal with those other issues, they say that I have<br />
met and delivered on my promise the financial targets in<br />
regard to children in poverty and met it ahead of schedule. </p>
<p>McMINN: A couple of other quick points, Prime Minister,<br />
before we try to maximise your time here by letting people<br />
talk to you directly.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
McMINN: Today's Herald has an article by Hugh Crawford<br />
saying that Senator Graham Richardson indicated that the<br />
Federal Government would hold on as long as possible before<br />
going to the polls. He said the Government still had six<br />
months to go and putting that in the context of another<br />
article there by Tony Parkinson who says and this will be<br />
interesting for you: " Federal Opposition Leader Mr Peacock<br />
has conceded the Hawke Government is likely to go into next<br />
year's election campaign with interest rates lower than<br />
now." I quote him: " I make no bones about it, I expect<br />
interest rates, for professional rates anyhow, to come down<br />
a couple of points before the next election. But I also<br />
know that people will see through it" and he says that while<br />
this will give a psychological boost to Labor in a run up to<br />
a possible May poll, it will be something that people will<br />
see for what it is. A slight drop before you go to the<br />
polls.<br />
PM: Let me say this, without any personal disrespect to<br />
Andrew, it's not only myself but everyone in the economic<br />
and political area would take no notice of anything that<br />
passes as economic analysis by Andrew. It's a matter of<br />
common currency in the business and political and economic<br />
community that Mr Peacock's understanding of matters<br />
economic is zilch. So anything that Andrew has to say in<br />
the economic analysis area he can just put to one side. The<br />
position in regard to what will happen to interest rates is<br />
as I've put it on many occasions and I don't want to bore<br />
your listeners by saying it again at any length. It's<br />
simply I say to them that we haven't got interest rates high<br />
for fun or to hurt, deliberately for the sake of hurting.<br />
They are just there because we've got to lower the level of<br />
activity and imports to a point that we can sustain with our<br />
exports and we will be easing monetary policy, therefore<br />
having lower interest rates, as soon as but not before, we<br />
are confident that that lowering of activity has occurred<br />
and that we can ease of f with confidence. That decision<br />
will be made irrespective of electoral considerations.<br />
McMINN: And Richardson's comment six months?<br />
PM: Richardson doesn't determine election dates or even<br />
economic policy.<br />
McHINN: Alright, we'll take a break. </p>
<p>MCMINN: I'm with the Prime Minister and he's here to<br />
take your calls. The first caller is John. Good morning<br />
John. Oh, by the way. Before I bring John through,<br />
seeing the board is absolutely packed as you'd expect<br />
I'd just ask people if they could keep their comments<br />
reasonably short. Could you please get to your point<br />
quickly and that way everyone gets a chance. The Prime<br />
Minister can be here for another 20 minutes and<br />
minutes only. He has another function to attend at 11<br />
o'clock. On that note, keep them short and give everyone<br />
a go. The first caller is John.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Good morning John.<br />
CALLER: I'd like to speak to you about compensation<br />
payments to former Commonwealth employees suffering from<br />
-work-related injuries. Our presenter said keep it short<br />
but I must background the matter if you'd<br />
MCMINN: No John, honestly, I must ask you I'm sorry<br />
but if it's going to be lengthy I'll give you another<br />
chance but it has to be quite short.<br />
CALLER: Could you call five minutes short?<br />
MCMINN: That's far too long I'm sorry. I really am<br />
sorry John.<br />
CALLER: I'll ask the Prime Minister then.<br />
MCMINN: Sorry, look I really am sorry about this and I<br />
don't mean to be rude to anyone but five minutes is a<br />
long time. Michelle. Good morning Michelle.<br />
CALLER: Good morning. Good morning Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: Good morning Michelle.<br />
CALLER: I would like to ask you a question about<br />
Medicare but I would just like to make one statement if<br />
you wouldn't mind please.<br />
MCMINN: Please keep it short.<br />
CALLER: I will. That is that I feel that your monetary<br />
policies are hurting Australia badly and I think that<br />
there's a lot of that, people out there, we were hearing<br />
constantly of many businesses going under. I just feel<br />
that you're going to have to have a long and hard look at<br />
things. My question about Medicare is that you tell<br />
people that they don't need private health insurance.<br />
You assume that elective surgery, you know, people can<br />
wait a couple of years to have elective surgery. But we </p>
<p>had a case here recently where a man needed a triple<br />
bypass and because he didn't have private health<br />
insurance he would have had to wait two years. And when<br />
you go to a private<br />
MCMINN: So the question please Michelle.<br />
CALLER: When you go to a public hospital you're asked<br />
whether you have private health insurance and then you're<br />
charged by private hospitals well the health insurance<br />
Why, if we're not meant to have private health<br />
insurance the public hospitals, y'know, charging private<br />
health funds for your visit there.<br />
PM: The situation in regard to Medicare is this, and its<br />
impact on the Australian people. Before we came to<br />
office Michelle there were two million Australians who<br />
had no form of cover at all. You had a position where<br />
you'd had Medibank before. The Conservatives came in and<br />
had five changes of that scheme which had introduced<br />
total confusion and left two million, at that stage, out<br />
of sixteen million Australians without any cover at all.<br />
Now what we've done with Medicare is bring about a total<br />
transformation which means that every person in Australia<br />
is now covered in the case of a need to go to a doctor or<br />
to hospital. There is universality of coverage. It is<br />
equitable in that the scheme is financed, as you know, by<br />
an income tax levy which means that those of us like<br />
myself with higher incomes pay more. Now in terms of<br />
what happens with waiting lists in hospitals, that is a<br />
matter, after massive payments from the Commonwealth to<br />
the States, it's a matter within the State jurisdiction.<br />
And it is the fact that there has been a significant<br />
lessening of time in the hospital waiting lists.<br />
MCMINN: Phyllis joins us now Prime Minister.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: Good morning Phyllis.<br />
CALLER: Congratulations on the years and what you've<br />
done with them.<br />
PM: Thank you very much.<br />
CALLER: And also I would like to express, have the West<br />
Germans and the East Germans, is it well known that there<br />
are opportunities for immigration to Australia?<br />
PM: Yes Phyllis it is well known. I was asked this<br />
question at the Press Club the other day. There are two<br />
points quickly, if I could make three points to Phyllis<br />
about this. Firstly of course, like you Phyllis, I guess<br />
you're overjoyed about the fact of what is happening, at<br />
long last after these years of dictatorship that the<br />
opportunity for freedom and liberty is emerging in these<br />
countries, Iron Curtain countries. Obviously if there </p>
<p>are people who wish to come here to Australia the<br />
opportunity will be open to them because we have a nondiscriminatory<br />
program. But I did make the point, which<br />
I think you ought to think about, and that is this. That<br />
essentially these people are patriots I think. They have<br />
been fighting for freedom, for the removal of repression<br />
in their own countries. And I think that the<br />
overwhelming majority of them are going to be thrilled<br />
with the changes that have taken place and will want to<br />
be there and play a part in rebuilding free, democratic,<br />
strong and prosperous nations once more.<br />
MCMINN: Bill. Good morning Bill.<br />
CALLER: Thank you Ian. Good morning Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: G'day Bill.<br />
CALLER: After your vehement declaration that you were<br />
going to destroy the pilots federation because they chose<br />
to strike<br />
PM: Well, would you give me the quote on that one Bill<br />
because I'd like to see it, I haven't<br />
CALLER: now declare that you now want the airlines<br />
companies to withdraw the $ 10 million damages suit and b)<br />
would it be the ACTU bringing pressure to bear?<br />
PM: Bill, y'know cynicism is a delightful feature of<br />
Australian politics but it's always a help Bill if you<br />
get your facts straight.<br />
MCMINN: The question that Bill is asking is<br />
PM: I hear what he's asking and I have not said that I<br />
was going to destroy the Federation of Airline Pilots.<br />
So you've got the problem Bill that you've based your<br />
question on a false premise. What I was determined to do<br />
was to stop the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots<br />
destroying the Australian economy. We have succeeded in<br />
doing that. I've been under no pressure from the ACTU on<br />
this issue at all. It's been my own view long before<br />
this dispute that I don't like the idea of damages being<br />
used in the industrial relations system. I didn't<br />
discover that view during this confrontation with the<br />
airline industry. And you would well know that if you'd<br />
been following my public career. That's been my<br />
consistent position. I believe there was a very strong<br />
case for having the action in the court so that there<br />
could emerge, as there has, an independent judicial<br />
assessment of the facts of the dispute. That's been<br />
done. Now that that's been achieved I see no point,<br />
indeed I would argue strongly against damages being<br />
collected. That's the fact and very simple and<br />
indisputably. MCMINN: Jessie, good morning. </p>
<p>CALLER: Good morning Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: G'day Jessie.<br />
CALLER: Tears for Israel. I love Israel too but take<br />
notice of God's promise to his chosen Israel and the Godfearing<br />
people in Australia. God promised ' if you ask me<br />
I will listen to you and help you in time of your<br />
trouble'. A parallel here stubborn, arrogant Israel<br />
and an agnostic, arrogant Prime Minister, tears and all.<br />
PM: Thank you Jessie for those thoughts. That's lovely.<br />
MCMINN: I don't think Jessie's got a question there.<br />
She's got a statement and Irene's next.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Mr Hawke.<br />
S PM: Morning Irene.<br />
CALLER: I just want to say a very happy birthday on<br />
Saturday. You and I have one thing in common we were<br />
both 60 on Saturday.<br />
PM: Thank you very much Irene. Well<br />
CALLER: And I want to say all the best. I think you're<br />
doing a jolly good job Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: Thank you very much. It's very kind of you Irene<br />
and I just hope that in your 60 years you've had as much<br />
happiness in this country as I have. We're both lucky to<br />
live in such a beautiful country. But thank you very<br />
much Irene.<br />
MCMINN: John. Good morning John.<br />
S CALLER: Good morning Mr Hawke. I'm just wondering why<br />
the Australian Government doesn't take a tougher stand<br />
towards the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in the United Nations<br />
or through other diplomatic channels.<br />
PM: Well John, with respect, I don't want to be rude but<br />
I think that your question doesn't really reflect an<br />
understanding of what we have been doing. It's an<br />
extraordinarily complex issue Ian but, and I can't begin<br />
to do justice other than to say this. That it was the<br />
Australian Government through our Foreign Minister Gareth<br />
Evans who has recently advanced a proposal of having an<br />
interim United Nations administration there to handle the<br />
period before the holding of free elections to enable an<br />
independent democratic government to emerge. The reason<br />
why we in fact advanced that proposal John, which is<br />
receiving a degree of support around the world, is<br />
precisely because we are aware of the possible dangers of<br />
the alternative quadripartite proposition for an interim<br />
administration which would include the Khmer Rouge. So </p>
<p>that's the bare outlines of it John. I think if you<br />
understood in fact what specifically we were doing<br />
because of our concern about the Khmer Rouge you wouldn't<br />
express the concern that you have.<br />
MCMINN: Irene, good morning.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: Good morning Irene.<br />
CALLER: Look, I never seem to hear any consideration<br />
being give to the 65 plus retiree, non-pensioner, and I<br />
emphasise non-pensioner. There's a lot of us listening<br />
out there. Are you going to be astute enough to give.-us<br />
the fringe benefit health card to help us?<br />
PM: It's not a question of being astute enough Irene.<br />
The question of not only that benefit but other benefits<br />
that are associated with the pensioner card are being<br />
considered and some relaxation has been given at the end<br />
of last year. But in the health card area, that's<br />
CALLER: But not for non-pensioners.<br />
PM: No, I understand Irene. I understand Irene that<br />
you're referring to the non-pensioners. In the decisions<br />
that we made at the end of last year in the Budget, we<br />
did, as I hope you appreciate, make a number of decisions<br />
which has made it easier for the accumulation of savings<br />
in a non-discriminatory way. That was one thing that was<br />
considered but at that time the issuing of the healthcard<br />
benefit to the non-pensioner group was thought to be<br />
too expensive. I appreciate that it would be an<br />
attractive vote winner but there are so many things Irene<br />
that a government could do which would be attractive vote<br />
winners but if you did them all in combination it starts<br />
to be fairly irresponsible economically. But it's<br />
S something that I guess remains on the political agenda<br />
but I would be misleading you Irene if I said it was just<br />
around the corner.<br />
MCMINN: Kath, good morning Kath.<br />
CALLER: Good morning Prime Minister. Happy birthday.<br />
All the best for Christmas for you and your family.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed Kath.<br />
CALLER: I'm going to do a Bob Hawke. I'm going to do<br />
three quick points.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
CALLER: Interest rates, while I think they're high but I<br />
think the people are very well of f today. My mother<br />
struggled during the depression with five per cent and<br />
father was on the sustenance. About the children, no </p>
<p>matter how much money you give some women they would<br />
spend it all and give the children nothing. Third point,<br />
Mr Peacock made a statement about he doesn't run around<br />
with silver tails. Well I don't know what you call the<br />
parties with Lang Hancock and with Mr Elliott at the<br />
races. And have a wonderful time.<br />
PM: Thank you very very much indeed Kath. Thank you.<br />
MCMINN: Alright, well. Three quick points indeed.<br />
Norma. CALLER: Good morning Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: Good morning Norma.<br />
CALLER: I'd like to have a different tack on what<br />
everybody's been talking about. I'm not an Australian<br />
but I think that Australia is a very political country<br />
and every question that has been presented to you this<br />
morning has been political.<br />
MCMINN: Ok.<br />
CALLER: I feel that we should it's your birthday. We<br />
should ask you how you feel as a man and what you ' ye<br />
learnt. MCMINN: Ok, is that the question?<br />
CALLER: Yes, that is the question. What wisdom you have<br />
to offer.<br />
PM: Well Norma, first of all you asked me how I feel. I<br />
feel these things. I feel very fit and well and<br />
physically and mentally very alert and strong. That's<br />
the first thing in terms of my own condition. Secondly I<br />
feel you say you're not an Australian well I am and I<br />
S feel terribly proud of this country, not complacent<br />
because we've got some challenges in front of us. But I<br />
think we have the capacity and an increasing<br />
sophistication to face up to those challenges. Thirdly<br />
because you went to the point about all the questions<br />
being political I don't think that we should be<br />
frightened of being too political. Because in the end'if<br />
we're going, as a nation, to face up to the sorts of<br />
challenges that we have, that is the challenge of<br />
harnessing our resources as well as ensuring that we<br />
protect the environment for future generations, the<br />
challenge of making sure that we become an active,<br />
constructive partner in the Asian-Pacific region. If<br />
we're going to face up to the issue of providing<br />
appropriate educational opportunities for our children,<br />
which is just about the most important thing there is,<br />
all these important things in the end become political<br />
questions. So I feel happy that the Australian people I<br />
think are getting more sophisticated in their political<br />
thinking and their preparedness to face up to issues. So </p>
<p>without being exhaustive Norma, those are some of the<br />
things I feel. Basically I feel proud and confident<br />
about this country.<br />
MCMINN: Prime Minister, there's one question I'd like to<br />
ask you and that was the question of child care. Now, Mr<br />
Peacock in his statement indicated there'd be child care<br />
rebates. A program here that I did a couple of weeks ago<br />
got quite an enormous response in that regard. Is the<br />
ALP as they go into an election year going to try to<br />
match or better the Opposition on child care?<br />
PM: The first thing I will be doing is to ask the<br />
Australian electorate to take account of Mr Peacock's<br />
words in the light of their action. I mean, they've been<br />
in government, they've had the opportunity of addressing<br />
these issues and they were an abysmal failure. In terms<br />
of our approach we have undertaken and have delivered to<br />
provide many many more child care places. And at the end<br />
of this current period we will have created 98,000<br />
additional child care places, which I point out to your<br />
listeners will be a trebling, a trebling of the number of<br />
child care places from those provided by the Opposition.<br />
Now on the question of Mr Peacock's proposals, let's<br />
remember this. That like all of their policies they are<br />
not means tested. They will mean that the resources of<br />
this community will be provided indiscriminately to those<br />
who need the assistance least, the highest income people<br />
by way of the tax rebate approach will get the<br />
assistance, where really it is the lower and middle<br />
income people of Australia who need the greatest<br />
assistance. MCMINN: So you'll be coming out with some program?<br />
PM: I'm just going to conclude by saying we in this, as<br />
in other areas, are not simply going to say our reform<br />
program is complete. We will be addressing further<br />
measures in this area.<br />
MCMINN: So keep your eyes open on that. Margaret, good<br />
morning. CALLER: Good morning.<br />
PM: Good morning Margaret.<br />
CALLER: Recently it was said of the pilots federation<br />
that they were deliberately conspiring to disrupt the<br />
operations of the airlines causing them financial harm.<br />
Aren't the tram drivers doing the same thing now and why<br />
aren't you blasting them?<br />
PM: Well as far as the Melbourne tramway system is<br />
concerned, that is a matter for the State Government.<br />
With the division of powers that we have Margaret in this<br />
country, state transport is a matter for the State<br />
Government and they deal with that. As far as the </p>
<p>airline industry is concerned that is a national problem.<br />
I have to deal with that. And I have dealt with the<br />
airline industry as I thought appropriate. If you've got<br />
any questions Margaret about how the tram drivers have<br />
been handled, well you'll have to get John Cain in here<br />
Ian and allow Margaret to address a question to him.<br />
MCMINN: Alright, I know Prime Minister you're almost out<br />
of time. Sorry to all the people who tried to speak to<br />
Mr Hawke this morning but didn't get a chance. While<br />
I've got you for the next couple of minutes, an<br />
exhaustive amount of material coming out over the weekend<br />
about you and your wife and all that sort of stuff.<br />
After wading through it I thought to myself this morning<br />
what in the hell am I going to ask this man that there<br />
hasn't But I guess there was one sharp division<br />
amongst the people who support you and the people who<br />
detract from you and I guess anyone in the public eye<br />
as long as you would have your fair share of enemies and<br />
S friends. The supporters say you have a vision of<br />
Australia. The detractors say that you're a wheeler and<br />
a dealer and you probably read the quotes James<br />
McClelland is not one of your mates ' he's a mediocre<br />
man with an oversized ego.' So what are you, a visionary<br />
or a wheeler dealer?<br />
PM: Well McClelland ought to look in the mirror at night<br />
and say to himself well I Jim McClelland know and Bob<br />
Hawke knows the reason for his bile and his lack of<br />
impartiality and I laugh whenever I read McClelland's<br />
comment because I know and he knows the reason for his<br />
bile. Look, I think if you ask a man about his vision<br />
after he's been Prime Minister for seven years, the man's<br />
entitled to say look I don't create new goal posts every<br />
12 months. I say, look at what we have done. In 1983 if<br />
I'd been asked for my vision for Australia I would've<br />
given you this answer. My vision is for an Australia<br />
which ceases to be dominated by confrontationalism. In<br />
S 1989 1 can say I have delivered on that vision because we<br />
are not the confrontationalist society we were. I<br />
would've said then that I wanted to have an economy in<br />
which our kids had a greater opportunity of being<br />
educated. Only 36% of our kids then stayed on in school<br />
36%. After seven years of my Government it's 61%.<br />
I've delivered and will continue to have that vision. I<br />
would've said then that I wanted an Australia which was<br />
respected in the region and in the world. You ask any<br />
international organisation, any significant international<br />
leader in 1989 about Australia, in the region and in the<br />
world, about its place as a leader in peace and<br />
disarmament. Let me quote the Secretary-General of the<br />
United Nations Committee on Disarmament. He said to me,<br />
in Geneva, ' if other countries had done as much as your<br />
Government in the area of peace and disarmament, those<br />
issues would've been further advanced than they are'. So<br />
my vision now is a continuation of those things. </p>
<p>MCMINN: And I put it to you that this talk about<br />
retirement to have television programs and talkbacks and<br />
all the rest of it so much nonsense, you're going to<br />
stay there as long as you can.<br />
PM: I'm going to stay there for quite some time with<br />
MCMINN: Paul Keating or no.<br />
PM: Paul is there, an important part of the team, very<br />
important part of the team. I want to be around for<br />
quite a while yet. I love this country. I still think<br />
I've got something to do for it and I'd like to be there.<br />
MCMINN: Alright, thank you for joining me. The Prime<br />
Minister, Mr Robert James Lee Hawke, two days after his<br />
sixtieth birthday.<br />
ends<br />
