    <content><![CDATA[<p>On the occasion of the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Commemorative Summit, I am pleased to announce a new package of regional cooperative activities that will build on our existing regional development cooperation assistance with ASEAN and its individual member nations.  The package consists of:</p>
<p> A $5 million, three-year trade analysis and reform programme for Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam;</p>
<p> A $4 million, three-year Australian sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) capacity building program for ASEAN;</p>
<p> A $5 million, three-year regional communicable diseases initiative to help build capacities to combat SARS and Avian Influenza;</p>
<p> A $2 million, three-year regional anti-drugs initiative focussing on Cambodia, Laos, Burma and Thailand;</p>
<p> A $570,000, one-year extension of Australia's South East Asia program to combat foot and mouth disease, in conjunction with the International Animal Health Organization (OIE); and</p>
<p> A $700,000, three-year programme of additional assistance to support the work of the Mekong River Commission (MRC), including an Australian expert to help develop the MRC's next five year strategy plan.</p>
<p>In addition to the above activities, the ASEAN-Australia Development Cooperation Programme (to which Australia is contributing $45 million over six years) funds ongoing programmes including joint research on economic integration and liberalisation and fostering joint economic partnerships.</p>
<p>Australia is proud of its 30-year partnership in development cooperation with ASEAN.  This year Australia will spend just over $400 million on its regional and bilateral development cooperation with ASEAN countries.</p>
<p>Major transnational challenges that confront us all demand a concerted and cooperative response from all countries in our region, including in the areas of health, people trafficking, child sex tourism, crime prevention and promoting regional security and combating terrorism.  Australia will continue to work closely with ASEAN to tackle these issues.  </p>
