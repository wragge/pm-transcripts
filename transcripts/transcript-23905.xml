    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia mourns the passing of its 21st Prime Minister, the Honourable Edward Gough Whitlam AC QC.</p>
<p>We remember his lifetime of service to Australia in the Royal Australian Air Force, as a parliamentarian, as Prime Minister and as an ambassador.</p>
<p>Gough Whitlam was a giant of his time. </p>
<p>He united the Australian Labor Party, won two elections and seemed, in so many ways, larger than life. </p>
<p>In his own party, he inspired a legion of young people to get involved in public life. </p>
<p>He established diplomatic relations with China and was the first Australian Prime Minister to visit China.  China is our largest trading partner. That is an enduring legacy.</p>
<p>Gough Whitlam recognised the journey that our country needed to take with indigenous Australians.  The image of soil passing from Gough Whitlam's hand to Vincent Lingiari's is a reminder that all Australians share the same land and the same hopes.</p>
<p>Gough Whitlam's life was inseparable from that of Margaret Whitlam. Margaret Whitlam was a leading light for women of her generation. Together they made a difference to our country.</p>
<p>On this day we honour a life of service to our country.</p>
<p>I have instructed all flags to fly at half-mast today and on the day of Mr Whitlam's State Memorial Service.</p>
<p>Further details on how Australians can honour Mr Whitlam will be announced in coming days in consultation with the Whitlam family.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Australian people, I extend my condolences to the Whitlam family on their loss.</p>
