EMBARGO: 7. 15 p. m. on 20 October RADIO TALK NO. 4<br />
1969 FEDERAL ELECTION<br />
TALK GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. JOHN GORTON, OVER ABC NETWORK<br />
ON MONDAY 20 OCTOBER<br />
Good evening. What do you see as the needs of Australia<br />
in the years ahead? What do you see of the opportunities for Australia<br />
in the exciting 1970' s we are just entering? How do you believe we<br />
can make the most of these opportunities and satisfy these needs? I<br />
see it this way. I believe that if we are to grow at the rate that history<br />
demands, if we are to continue the development towards greatness<br />
which we have so much advanced in the last twenty years, then we<br />
will need in these years a continuing inflow of development capital<br />
from abroad. This is so that our iron ore can be mined, our nickel<br />
can be used, our oil can be used instead of importing oil, our factories<br />
can be improved, our industrial muscles can be strengthened and<br />
more and more employment and more secure employment can be<br />
provided. Of course we want to participate with Australian capital<br />
in this development, but in the years ahead we will not be able to<br />
save from our own resources as much as is required for the ? ace of<br />
development that history demands that Australia should have. So the<br />
first need, I believe, is for this continuing development anid that will<br />
depend on a continuing development capital coming to Australia.<br />
Side by side with that need, and not to be put second<br />
to it, is the need Australia has for more people, for greater<br />
population, for more and more migrants coming to Australia, for<br />
more and more Australians being born and growing up and working<br />
for their nation. My Government has brought in record numbers of<br />
migrants in this past year, but in the 1970' s we will need more and<br />
more and more if the development and the employment and the<br />
prosperity we now enjoy are to grow as they can with the opportunities<br />
now facing us. / 2<br />

Both this development capital and the inflow of<br />
population will be threatened should inflation strike this country.<br />
If, as our Opposition suggests, hundreds of millicns of dollars<br />
should be thrown into the economy when there is not manpower to<br />
match it, when there are not resources to match it, then there will<br />
be little new built, and what is built will cost more. And there will<br />
be burdens placed on the fixed income earner, on the pensioner,<br />
on the primary producer and that being so, there will be a diminution<br />
of the growth and of the prosperity we now enjoy.<br />
The real growth of Australia depends on a properlymanaged<br />
economy, and it is a properly-managed economy which<br />
these false and worthless Labor promises now threaten to damage.<br />
For if you accept these propositions, then what will happen will be<br />
that there will be a paper printing press, turning out worthless money<br />
to meet such worthless promises.<br />
But it is not only the development and the growth. It<br />
is not only the increasing population Australia needs. We will need,<br />
too, in these years ahead, strong friends. While we continue to look<br />
after ourselves, while we continue to improve our own defence, we<br />
will still need strong friends. We will not get them by reneging on<br />
our alliances with the United States, by walking out of Malaysia/<br />
Singapore, by niggling about joint defence bases in Australia, by<br />
slapping our allies in the face and cutting our own security.<br />
These are the needs of Australia in the 1970' s. They<br />
can only be met by a Liberal Government. Don't be misled by<br />
promises which can't be kept and which can be broken on the dictates<br />
of an outside body. </p>
