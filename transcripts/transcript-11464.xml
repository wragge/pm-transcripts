<p>SADLER:</p>
<p>Mr Howard what's your reaction to the Hansie Cronje allegations?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well I'm very sorry and saddened about the whole incident.  I know Hansie Cronje, he struck me as a very decent and intelligent man.  He was a great cricketer.  I'm sorry for South African cricket that this has happened; I feel for him and his family but you really do have to root out this kind of behaviour from the game we all love so much.</p>
<p>SADLER:</p>
<p>Do you think there needs to be some sort of international inquiry?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Oh, of course.  I mean this is a matter for the cricket authorities, I don't want to tell them what to do, they run the game but they have responsibilities and clearly there are strong suggestions of I guess an international network of bad behaviour by bookmakers and so on.  The Australian Cricket Board supports an international inquiry and I would too.</p>
<p>SADLER:</p>
<p>How does this compare to the match forecasting allegations against Warne and Waugh?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well, I'm not going to get into comparisons, that matter was dealt with at the time and I don't think it's fair or appropriate to revisit, that's dealt with and there's nothing to be gained by going back but there's a lot to be gained by putting in place whatever can be put in place to minimise the possibility of this happening again.  Also I think we have to keep a sense of perspective.  It's very bad for cricket and it saddens me and millions of cricket lovers all around the world, but it's still a great game and we have to keep a sense of perspective about it.</p>
<p>SADLER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
