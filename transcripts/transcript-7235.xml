Aire Uasail, cuireann s6 gliondar 6 chroi agus m6rtas orainne<br />
ti bheith anseo inniu le labhairt linn. Ocid mh6r, agus 6cid<br />

Mr. Prime Minister, it is indeed a great honour for us as<br />
the elected representatives of the Irish people to have you with<br />
us in Diil tireann today. Since the foundation of the State,<br />
this is the first occasion on which a Prime Minister of another<br />
country has addressed this House. We welcome you as leader<br />
of a nation and of a people with whom Ireland enjoys a unique<br />
ethnic relationship arising out of our history of emigration<br />
and deportation. As a result approximately five million<br />
Australians, a third of your population, have Irish blood in<br />
their veins and this binds us together in a very special way.<br />
Edmund Burke expressed this sentiment eloquently when he<br />
wrote: The close affection which grows from common names,<br />
from kindred blood;<br />
These are ties which, though light as air, are as strong as<br />
links of iron.<br />
Two centuries are a short time in the history of any country<br />
but in the case of your country, out of the trials, tribulations,<br />
hopes and fears of emigrants and deportees, a country has<br />
been forged which has taken its place among the great nations<br />
of the earth.<br />
We remember with deep pride the contribution which the<br />
Irish and their descendants made to the growth and success<br />
of Australia. Moreover, we do honour to their memories by<br />
forever cherishing that indomitable spirit which pain and<br />
suffering cannot and must not quench. They longed for freedom<br />
and dignity, and they certainly were not denied the<br />
realisation of their hopes and dreams in your country. In<br />
time your shores gave them the assurance of a new life with<br />
unfettered horizons.<br />
Sir ^ p </p>
<p>In the words of Dorothea Mackellar they could say:<br />
I love a sunburnt country,<br />
A land of sweeping plains,<br />
Of ragged mountain ranges,<br />
Of droughts and flooding rains.<br />
I love her far horizons,<br />
I love her jewel-sea,<br />
Her beauty and her terror-<br />
The wide brown land for me.<br />
We all know that this brown land was loved and honoured<br />
for 30,000 years in the culture and art of the Aboriginal<br />
Australians whose benign heritage is gaining increasing international<br />
appreciation. Mr. Prime Minister, your country's<br />
.1 recognition of this great heritage enriches us all.<br />
The Irish contribution to Australian liberties has been significant,<br />
but perhaps even more significant has been the effect<br />
of their activities and perspectives in contributing to the overall<br />
liberalising and humanising of the climate of Australian life.<br />
Their individual zest, and their vigorous refusal to accept<br />
injustice as they saw it, have also been vital to this climate. I<br />
may say that the Irish who went and settled in Australia came<br />
from all over Ireland, North and South, and from both<br />
Irish traditions. The fact that they and their descendants<br />
contributed to the creation of a tolerant, liberal and open<br />
society has undoubtedly a significant lesson for us in this<br />
island today.<br />
The Australia to which the Irish emigrated in the last<br />
century, and the Ireland from which they departed, were very<br />
different from what we see today. Both our countries have<br />
changed very much for the better in economic and political<br />
terms, but I would stress that the quintessential spark of what<br />
constitutes traditional Ireland with its love of music, literature<br />
and sport has added colour and verve to community life in<br />
Australia and has helped to form what today is an indigenous<br />
Australian culture and lifestyle. Irish names like Kenneally,<br />
Durack, Buckley, McCullough and White figure prominently Seven </p>
<p>in Australian writing, carrying on a tradition set by Marcus<br />
Clarke, Christopher Brennan, John O'Brien and others of<br />
Irish descent. In the realm of art the names of Sidney Nolan<br />
and Arthur Boyd are known around the world. The Irish have<br />
also made a significant contribution to the Christian Churches,<br />
to the legal profession, to the medical and health care field<br />
and, dare I say, to politics. I understand that seven of your<br />
Prime Ministers were of Irish descent. That speaks volumes<br />
for the role the Irish played in the political life of your country.<br />
We in Ireland look forward in anticipation to being closely<br />
associated with your bicentennial celebrations next year. You<br />
can truly look forward to 1988 with deep pride. We share that<br />
pride, and we will rejoice with you on that great occasion.<br />
In conclusion, Mr. Prime Minister, perhaps I could briefly<br />
quote Professor Patrick O'Farrell with whose writing you are<br />
well acquainted: Ireland in Australia was both fact and dream. Its dimensions<br />
of fact coincide with the boundaries of the continent,<br />
but its dreams were unbounded, spanning the<br />
world and more than the world. No man can fix the<br />
boundaries of the nation, of the mind and heart. Least of<br />
all the soul.<br />
With these sentiments, Mr. Prime Minister, it is now my<br />
privilege and great honour to call on you to address this<br />
House.<br />
Eight . e, I </p>
<p>ADDRESS OF PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
The Honourable Robert]. L. Hawke, MP', Prime Minister<br />
of Australia, then delivered his address.<br />
Prime Minister Hawke: A Cheann Comhairle, when I<br />
arrived at Dublin Airport on Sunday, I told the Taoiseach<br />
that I felt as if I had arrived home. The friendly welcome you<br />
extended to me then has been borne out in all that I have been<br />
shown by all whom I have met over the past few days. I have<br />
seen the beauty of your country and felt the spontaneous<br />
warmth of your people. Indeed, I do feel at home.<br />
The Australian and the Irish people share so many values<br />
and so much history that our kinship could hardly be closer.<br />
Today, however, in this place, we celebrate perhaps the most<br />
important of those shared values. For this place is a tangible<br />
expression of the right of the people to govern themselves and<br />
of every individual to speak his mind. Many great Irishmen<br />
Daniel O'Connell and Charles Stewart Parnell among them<br />
fought for the right to do what I am doing now: to speak<br />
in the free Parliament of a free Irish nation.<br />
Of course, many of those Irish nationalists who were never<br />
permitted to achieve their aspirations for liberty in their own<br />
homeland came to Australia to enrich our social and political<br />
life. Charles Gavan Duffy, for example, became Premier of<br />
Victoria and lived to see Australia become a united, independent<br />
nation, after spending half his life in Ireland fighting<br />
for representative Government. What an irony it is then<br />
that Australia, after just over a century from the time of its<br />
European settlement, should have achieved independence a<br />
generation before Ireland.<br />
The struggle of Irish patriots over centuries is fulfilled in<br />
this building, in the parliamentary service given to it by such<br />
national leaders as de Valera and MacBride, and in the vigour<br />
F: of your parliamentary life.<br />
do not need to remind you how precious an achievement </p>
<p>nV<br />
that is or how fundamental to political life are the liberties of<br />
free speech, inside and outside parliament or how infinitely<br />
superior a means of government is the process of free and<br />
fair democratic election to the alternatives of violence and<br />
authoritarianism which we see around the world today.<br />
As members of democratic parliaments we have the gravest<br />
of responsibilities, not just to our own constituents and to<br />
our own nation but truly to the whole world. For there are<br />
all too few parliamentary democracies in the world, and all<br />
too many forces seeking to limit or even to snuff out those<br />
that do exist.<br />
It is not inappropriate in this context that I pause to make<br />
particular mention of Fiji, one of Australia's closest and most<br />
important South Pacific neighbours and a nation where the<br />
democratic flame burned brightly for the 17 years since it<br />
became independent. Fiji has recently succumbed to military<br />
rule. I am sure I speak for all of us when I express my deepest<br />
hope that all the people of the nation of Fiji will quickly secure<br />
once more their democratic rights which have been taken from<br />
them. A Cheann Comhairle, I know it is a rare event for a foreign<br />
leader to be invited to address the Dii and I want to assure<br />
you that I am grateful for and deeply honoured by the motion<br />
passed unanimously on 14 October to extend this privilege to<br />
me. You have placed me in distinguished company, since<br />
my only predecessors as foreign leaders on this podium are<br />
President Reagan and the late President Kennedy. The choice<br />
of two Aeiasand one Australian reflects the historical<br />
truth, and, may I say, the paradoxical truth, of this most antiimperialist<br />
of nations and that historical and paradoxical truth<br />
is that Ireland is the head of a huge empire in which Australia<br />
and the United States are the principal provinces. It is an<br />
empire acquired not by force of Irish arms but by force of<br />
Irish character, an empire not of political coercion but of<br />
spiritual affiliation, created by the thousands upon thousands<br />
of Irish men and women who chose to leave these shores, or<br />
Ten </p>
<p>who were banished from them, to help in the building of new<br />
societies over the years.<br />
It seems appropriate, with hindsight, that President Kennedy<br />
opened his address to the Irish Parliament in June 1963<br />
with a story about the remarkable Thomas Meagher. Meagher<br />
led the Irish Brigade into battle at Fredericksburg in the<br />
American Civil War but his life story, in fact, spanned three<br />
continents he was born in Waterford; he died in America;<br />
but he also spent time in Australia as a convict transported<br />
for his involvement in the 1848 uprising.<br />
It is true that more of your fellow-countrymen and forefathers<br />
became American than Australian. But it is true, too,<br />
that the Irish form a greater proportion of the Australian<br />
population than of the American. Indeed, almost one-third<br />
of Australia's population more than five out of 16 million<br />
people proudly claim Irish ancestry.<br />
Outside Ireland itself, Australia is the most Irish of nations,<br />
and we are proud of it. Moreover, I assert that those who<br />
came to Australia from Ireland as well as from Great Britain<br />
and elsewhere found a society which presented them with<br />
opportunities that were not available in older societies where<br />
rigid hierarchies and orders of social class were already established.<br />
The Irish found in Australia a congenial and egalitarian<br />
environment where their talents were welcomed and<br />
rewarded. That spirit of egalitarianism remains one of the<br />
distinguishing characteristics in the make-up of both our<br />
countries. I had the pleasure yesterday, in an address to University<br />
College, Dublin, of outlining my thoughts about the extraordinary<br />
way the Irish took up the opportunities presented<br />
to them and contributed in almost every field to the creation<br />
of the Australian nation and the Australian identity. In particular,<br />
I called attention to the Irish commitment to justice<br />
and equality of opportunity, a commitment which has been<br />
the central theme of your struggle for nationhood in this<br />
Eleven </p>
<p>country and which underpinned so much of the Irish contribution<br />
to Australia.<br />
I mentioned in passing that a new eminent personage is<br />
expected to arrive in Australia soon from Ireland. A worldwide<br />
search was instituted some time ago for a statue to grace<br />
the newly refurbished Queen Victoria building in Sydney.<br />
The statue sought was of Queen Victoria herself but in none<br />
of the many former British colonies of the Victorian era could<br />
a town hall or city plaza or private royalist be found who was<br />
willing to part with a suitable statue of the Queen. Until the<br />
search came to Ireland and to this city. I am pleased to<br />
report that a statue of Queen Victoria was found not far from<br />
this very building and is to be if I can use this term in other<br />
than its former sense transported to Sydney and placed on<br />
public display.<br />
A Cheann Comhairle, as a leader of one of the oldest<br />
and proudest Labour parties, the Australian Labour Party, I<br />
acknowledge the seminal role the Irish played in the formation<br />
of that party and of our trade union movement, and in our<br />
struggle for a fairer, more compassionate, more prosperous<br />
society. A number of my predecessors as Labour Prime Ministerincluding<br />
the incomparable John Curtin and Joseph Benedict<br />
Chifley were of Irish extraction. In the way Curtin devoted<br />
himself to the task of leading Australia through the Second<br />
World War, the Irish attributes of dedicated and selfless<br />
commitment, determination, character and courage shine<br />
through. It is equally easy to see an Irish-derived compassion<br />
and vision in his successor Chifley's sweeping reconstruction<br />
of the Australian economy to equip it for the challenges of<br />
peacetime. Among today's generation of Labour leaders, the Irish<br />
tradition is still strong and if you looked at a list of my<br />
Ministers you would see enough names like Bowen, Keating,<br />
Hayden, Kerin, Walsh, Young, Ryan, Duffy and Kelly to<br />
satisfy even the most nationalistic among you. indeed, half of<br />
Twelve </p>
<p>my Ministry claims Irish origin so now you may understand<br />
even more clearly why I said at the outset that I feel at home.<br />
In 1985 we were privileged to receive an official visit by<br />
President Hillery and last year the Australian Parliament<br />
played host to the first visit of a delegation of Irish parliamentarians.<br />
We will be sending an Australian delegation<br />
here next year in honour of the millenium of the City of<br />
Dublin. I can assure you that it is a delegation which poses a<br />
major problem of selection from the long list of bids that are<br />
in to join it.<br />
A Cheann Comhairle, it would not be appropriate if I dwelt<br />
today solely on the historical elements of our relationship, as<br />
important and enduring as they are. As political leaders we<br />
must turn our attention to the ways in which we can address<br />
the many contemporary issues we confront. As medium sized<br />
western industrial economies, which share and nourish the<br />
same commitment to democratic principles and practices,<br />
Australia and Ireland bring vitally important perspectives to<br />
the resolution of these problems.<br />
Neither Australia nor Ireland is a large country compared<br />
to the super powers and the economic giants. By ourselves,<br />
our capacities to effect great international change may seem<br />
slight. What we can do is by force of example, and by the<br />
persuasion we can apply to others. Australia, through its<br />
alliance relationship and through our many bilateral links<br />
with other countries, and Ireland through in particular its<br />
membership of the European Community, and both of us<br />
through our membership of the United Nations and other<br />
international bodies, can take positions that advance our goals<br />
and keep faith with our principles. And, of course, many of<br />
those goals and principles we share, and many of our aspirations<br />
we hold in common.<br />
Australia is an aligned nation, Ireland espouses neutrality;<br />
but from these different vantage points we both work for a<br />
world in which conflict and tension are lessened, and in which<br />
the arms race can be brought under control and reversed. We<br />
Thirteen </p>
<p>both share a sense of expectation and satisfaction that the<br />
United States and the Soviet Union are about to agree to limit<br />
their intermediate nuclear forces. That agreement will be the<br />
first occasion on which the super powers have agreed to reduce<br />
their nuclear forces, not merely to slow down the rate of<br />
grolwth. With this agreement signed we must, as nations with a vital<br />
interest in both the preservation of peace and the advancement<br />
of human development, continue to work towards further<br />
reductions in the nuclear arsenals. Our goal must be that one<br />
day the world's resources may be concentrated not on the<br />
needless accumulation of weapons which could obliterate<br />
mankind but on the essential humanitarian tasks of caring for<br />
the elderly, sheltering the homeless and feeding the hungry.<br />
Australia and Ireland are also working in harmony towards<br />
the enhancement of human rights around the world. Neither<br />
of us should ever be diffident or apologetic about supporting<br />
in other countries the rights and freedoms which we fought<br />
and worked so hard to achieve at home. We advocate and<br />
support decolonisation and the principles of national selfdetermination.<br />
We both stand for the elimination of the evil<br />
of apartheid and the expunging of racial discrimination.<br />
Last week I attended the meeting of Commonwealth Heads<br />
of Government in Vancouver, Canada. Over recent years,<br />
Australia has been at the forefront of those inthe Coinmonwealth<br />
who see the need for measures to place pressure<br />
on the racist Government of South Africa in the direction of<br />
negotiations with the black majority. Australia and Ireland<br />
have been active and willing participants in the efforts of<br />
the United Nations, through its peace-keeping forces, -to<br />
contribute to peace and stability in many of the world's areas<br />
of tension. May I pay, on behalf of the pe * ople of Australia,<br />
particular tribute to Ireland's efforts in this regard.<br />
The commitment of successive Irish Governments to the<br />
enhancement of the prospects for international peace is, of<br />
course, entirely consistent with your efforts over the years to<br />
Fourteen : 17 </p>
<p>achieve peace and stability on your own borders. The troubles<br />
in Northern Ireland pose one of the most heartrending issues<br />
facing not just Ireland, and not just countries like Australia<br />
that have Irish connections, but the whole world. Australia<br />
strongly supports the efforts by the Irish and British Governments,<br />
through the Anglo-Irish Agreement, to end the<br />
communal strife in Northern Ireland. Above all, it is clear<br />
that violence can only worsen that communal strife and can<br />
only hamper the progress towards peace which is being made.<br />
I assure you that the Australian Government will do all within<br />
its power to discourage any Australian citizen from adding in<br />
any way to the violence in Northern Ireland. We believe that<br />
reconciliation and the search for understanding provide the<br />
only way forward. And we recognise that this is precisely<br />
Ireland's approach.<br />
A Cheann Comhairle, ultimately peace and the enhancement<br />
of human rights depend on economic growth and prosperity.<br />
If as political leaders we have not understood the interrelationship<br />
of economic policy and political stability, then<br />
we have learned nothing of the lessons of this century. The<br />
world paid a heavy price in the Second World War for the<br />
failure of the major economies in the twenties and thirties to<br />
control the tendencies towards protectionism. As horrendous<br />
as that price was in the Second World War, it would be as<br />
nothing compared to the results of unbridled conflict in the<br />
nuclear age.<br />
Both our countries have undergone an historic transformation<br />
in their economic orientation. In Australia, beginning<br />
in the fifties, we came to the recognition that our future<br />
lay in the Asia-Pacific region. My Government have done<br />
everything they can, through the redirection of our external<br />
plicies and domestic restructuring, to promote the enmeshmetof<br />
our economy with the Asia-Pacific region, the fastest<br />
Ieadtoo made a fundamental decision to link its future<br />
with Western Europe, through membership of the EEC. For<br />
Fifteen </p>
<p>both of us, these changes have led to great achievements.<br />
Your President, Dr. Hillery, noted in his address to a<br />
parliamentary luncheon in Canberra in 1985, that the Irish<br />
economy has developed in a relatively short period into a<br />
highly sophisticated, modern, industrialised one. But we both<br />
now face major new challenges. It is my firm belief that hard<br />
decisions are best made with the active understanding and cooperation<br />
of those who are most affected by them.<br />
In my talks on Monday with the Taoiseach, we discussed<br />
strategies of consensus and co-operation through which our<br />
nations can create the self-discipline needed to meet our economic<br />
challenges. We also discussed the advantages inherent in<br />
the removal of domestic barriers which can produce uncompetitiveness,<br />
low productivity and inefficiency.<br />
We found common ground on all this. Countries like ours<br />
cannot afford to live beyond their means. The tough political<br />
task of responsible economic management requires us to reorder<br />
our priorities, reduce deficits, attack indebtedness,<br />
tighten spending and question the assumptions of the past.<br />
Between us we may have differences about how we do that,<br />
but those things must be done. We must do this not by<br />
creating confrontation in our communities but by actively<br />
seeking to inform and involve all members in making the<br />
decisions which are necessary. Short-term costs will inevitably<br />
ensue in this process, but Governments, I believe, have the<br />
obligation to take the right and tough decisions now in the<br />
long-term interests of their people.<br />
One of the central factors facing economies of medium size<br />
is that domestic adjustment, however essential, is not enough<br />
in itself to maximise growth. All the hard decisions and all<br />
the efforts to adjust will avail a nation little if it must swim<br />
against an international tide hostile to economic growth and<br />
development. In a world of vast external imbalances among<br />
developed countries and enormous debt problems, particularly<br />
in the Third World, the strength of the world trading<br />
system can no-longer be taken for granted.<br />
Sixt~ eenz </p>
<p>Iam sure you would not expect me to visit a member of<br />
the European Community without mentioning in this context<br />
the damaging impact on that trading system of the Coinmunity's<br />
policies of agricultural subsidisation. Australia<br />
believes high levels of protection and subsidisation in the<br />
centre of world economic powers Europe, Japan and the<br />
United States will in the end only hurt all consumers and<br />
producers, whether they live behind the protectionist walls of<br />
the major economies or outside them. It would be shortsightedness<br />
of the most dangerous kind to adopt policies<br />
which fail to recognise that all would be losers in the end.<br />
A Cheann Coinhairle, next year Australia is to celebrate<br />
the bicentenary of the arrival of the First Fleet on Australian<br />
shores on 26 January 1788. Dublin, this great seat of European<br />
civilisation, will celebrate its millenium in 1988. It is appropriate<br />
to recall here that before the First Fleet was ever<br />
conceived of, and before even the foundation of Dublin itself,<br />
I. there was a living civilisation in Australia that of the<br />
Aboriginal people a civilisation which stretches back at<br />
least 40,000 years. For all that our bicentenary celebrations<br />
must focus on the achievements of the last 200 years, it will<br />
be my intention that due recognition be paid to the obligation<br />
Australians owe to the original Australians.<br />
For Australians, 1988 will be a milestone in our national<br />
development and will give us cause to reflect seriously on the<br />
progress we have made. It will also focus our attention on the<br />
way in which Australia has relied on and been immeasurably<br />
enriched by the constant influx of new peoples, new cultures<br />
and new ideas, to sustain the momentum of that development.<br />
It is in this context that we in Australia will have special cause<br />
to recognise the contribution of the Irish people over the last<br />
200 years.<br />
During my visit I have been pleased to hear at first hand of<br />
7the plans be ing made, both Government sponsored and private,<br />
to participate in our bicentennial celebrations in Australia.<br />
I say on behalf of all Australians that we are deeply grateful Se'venteen </p>
<p>for the contribution you are making. And may I say how<br />
much we are looking forward to seeing the Taoiseach in<br />
Australia next March during Irish week.<br />
The Irish Government are helping generously, in a number<br />
* of important ways, with the celebration of the bicentenary.<br />
We look forward to welcoming Asgard II when she joins the<br />
parade of Tall Ships on Sydney Harbour next January. She<br />
and her crew, I assure you, will be made to feel at home.<br />
The Irish Government have also assisted with a number of<br />
scholarly projects investigating the Iris h-Australian connection.<br />
And of very great value not just at the scholarly<br />
level but for the whole Australian community the Irish<br />
Government are making available in microfilm the convict<br />
records of the 40,000 Irish men and women who were transported<br />
to Australia in the 18th and 19th centuries. This will<br />
enable us to answer with more precision a central question of<br />
Austra* lan history: who were the convicts? Where did they<br />
come from? What were their crimes? Most of us, in our minds,<br />
use that word in inverted commas. I can answer you that<br />
when we get these details many Australians will try to establish<br />
that they are members of a very great 6lite. But this much,<br />
my friends, is already crystal clear. Whether it was politics or<br />
poverty which forced the Irish out of their homes and across<br />
the seas to Australia, the new arrivals invested our new society<br />
with lasting and invaluable qualities.<br />
Australia is very much the richer for having been able to<br />
draw on the generous influx of Irish aspirations, Irish traditions,<br />
and Irish spirit. We would not be the country we are<br />
today were it not for you. It is those bequests which are the<br />
durable and over-arching bicentennial gifts from Ireland to<br />
Australia. They are the debts Australians for their part owe<br />
to the Irish.<br />
I thank you again for your invitation to address, you and<br />
for the warm hospitality you have extended during my visit,<br />
not only to myself and Hazel, but to all those travelling with<br />
me. It has been a privilege to renew in this way the ties<br />
Eigbteen </p>
<p>the already close and friendly ties-between Australia and<br />
Ireland. I look forward to a future in which Australia and<br />
Ireland can play an even more co-operative role with each<br />
other and a more constructive role together in world affairs.<br />
A standing ovation was accorded to the Prime Minister on<br />
the conclusion of his address.<br />
An Ceann Comhairle: Mr. Prime Minister, it is now my<br />
privilege to offer you the profound thanks of this House for<br />
your inspiring address which we shall long remember and for<br />
your kind and generous remarks about us. As you and your<br />
wife Hazel will be leaving us shortly, you can rest assured<br />
that you carry with you the warmth and affection of the<br />
members of Diil Eireann and of all the Irish people.<br />
Go n-61iri go geal libh agus le muintir na hAstrile.<br />
