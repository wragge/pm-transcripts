<p>JOURNALIST:<br />
Mr Howard, what are the desirable qualities of the Australian of the Year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You need to be a good role model, you need to have an inspirational capacity, you need to be somebody whose achieved excellence in whatever they care about.  And that';s not limited to sport or intellectual pursuits, the Australians of the Year can be somebody who';s devoted his or her life to looking after others.  So they';re the sorts of things that we';re looking for and the new format will bring more and more nominations to light and I think that is a fantastic thing and it';s just a great way of focusing on the enormously diverse way in which people express their love of this country.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Do we have to step back a little bit from the sports stars and actors though in order to make sure that normal people do nominate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Normal people have always been involved.  I mean you might remember some of the sportsmen like Rafter and Border and Taylor and rightly so.  But remember we';ve had great scientists like Peter Doherty, we';ve had people who have been honoured for their welfare work as the General Governor was in his previous pursuits.  So there';s plenly of opportunity for that.<br />
Thank you.<br />
