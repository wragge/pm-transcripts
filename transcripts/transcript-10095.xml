September 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIM MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD, MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, MAJURO<br />
E &amp; OE<br />
Ladies and gentlemen the forum meeting finished this morning, the communique is in<br />
the process of being issued and there will be a briefing by President Kabua. I'd just<br />
like to say a couple of things on behalf of Australia. As you know this is the first<br />
forum meeting I've attended-as Prim6Minister: -As: I i1dicated yesterday, Australia<br />
does regard this gathering as being a very imiportant excpression of Australia's regional<br />
responsibilities. We have maintained a very heavy emphasis on aid for the Pacific area<br />
despite cut backs in other areas of the Budget the amount of aid going to Papua New<br />
Guinea and to the South Pacific has been maintained at virtually the same level as in<br />
1995/ 96. The needs of countries in this region, of course, vary enormously. I'm very<br />
pleased to say that there is an acceptance of the need for ongoing economic reform.<br />
It's very difficult to talk about economic reform when you're addressing some very<br />
tiny island states but even in the smallest of countries there's a realisation that such<br />
things as private sector efficiency and being competitive in world markets is the<br />
pathway to economic growth and employment growth. There is an acceptance that the<br />
world is moving towards an era of much lower levels of protection and tariffs. The<br />
goal of APEC is one of a tariff free environment into the next century and in those<br />
circumstances some of the protective arrangements that have existed in the past will no<br />
longer hold sway. I drew considerable satisfaction from an acceptance by all the<br />
participants about the importance of economnic reform-The forum agreed to<br />
inaugurate a series of economic ministers' meetings which will take place prior to the<br />
annual forum meeting. The first of those will be hosted by Australia and will take<br />
place sometime next year before the annual meeting of the forum which next year will<br />
take place in the Cook Islands. It was also an opportunity for me to have a number of<br />
bilateral discussions particularly with the Prime Minister of New Guinea, Sir Julius<br />
Chan, and at a personal level it was an opportunity for me to meet in most cases, but<br />
not all, for the first time the leaders of pacific island states. I found it a very valuable<br />
learning experience, it was a good opportunity to express on behalf of the new<br />
Government the goodwill of Australia towards many of these tiny countries, the<br />
willingness of Australia to play a constructive aid role but recognising that increasingly </p>
<p>Fax from 05/ 09/ 96 14: 16 Pg: 2<br />
aid provision will be linked with economic reform and economic change. It is not ever<br />
a question of seeing aid as being the salvation of the problems of under-developed<br />
small countries, it never can be. Intelligently used, properly targeted overseas aid can<br />
be of considerable help but without internal economic reform and the acceptance of the<br />
need for that reform long term goals for the achieving of higher living standards are<br />
simply not going to be achieved. I'd be very happy to take any questions.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think that some of the smaller states are going to survive in this.. I guess,<br />
harsher new economic world?<br />
PRiME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't see it as a, so much as a harsher economic world, I see it as a more<br />
realistic world and obviously, and this is acknowledged in the communique and I<br />
acknowledged it during the discussions, that pace of change is going to vary from state<br />
to state but in the long run the nature of the world as we move into the 2 1st Century<br />
will be one of freer trade. I'd prefer to use that expression because it's a more realistic<br />
expression and I believe that the fact that there is an acceptance of that is an important<br />
advance. I also accept that the continued provision of well targeted aid from a country<br />
like Australia is important to the economic future. We give these countries, we give of<br />
course something like $ 300-odd million to PNG and there's a figure of something like<br />
$ 140-odd million going to the other countries. Now that's a very large provision and<br />
it's very important to their future and we place very great significance on it, but hand<br />
in hand with that has to go an acceptance of the importance of economic change and<br />
reform. I think I may have mentioned to you yesterday in the background briefing the<br />
experience of a country like Mauritius which, over the past few years, has followed a<br />
programme of fairly vigorous economic reform and change with low levels of<br />
protection, low levels of Governmnent intervention, and the living standard of that<br />
country has risen quite significantly. Now, that is a big country compared with many<br />
of the countries in this part of the world and I don't underestimate the scale of<br />
difficulty but equally the experience is that if you imagine that the only way to lift up<br />
the economies of tiny island countries is to continually provide aid and assume that will<br />
do the trick, past experience has demonstrated that that doesn't work either. You<br />
need a combination of the two. You need intelligent programme aid which seeks to<br />
improve the infrastructure and you also need intelligent reform programmes. You<br />
can't have one without the other.<br />
JOURNALISTAs a corollary to that would you then say that perhaps in the past some of the aid has<br />
not been spent as well as it perhaps could have been?<br />
PRIME NMSTER:<br />
Oh look I don't want to get into name-calling or aid criticism. I simply express to the<br />
future of our commitment to having well targeted programme aid. </p>

JOURNALIST: pressuire over its stand on Greenhouse gas emissions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I wouldn't say we came under any pressure. Everybody wants, as the<br />
communique says, further progress towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We<br />
all want that. We have come a long way. We've reduced the rate of growth in those<br />
emissions by something like, from some figure of about 3% to 0.5% since 1990 and<br />
we'lve signed up some agreements with a number of the major companies in Australia.<br />
We made it clear in Berlin that the mandatory targets were convenient to the<br />
Europeans and the Americans, but because of the nature of our economy they didn't<br />
necessarily harmonise with Australia's national interest. Now, I made that plain in the<br />
discussions in which I've been engaged. I think there is an acceptance of that. I think<br />
it would be wrong to say that we came under pressure. The issue came up, it was dealt<br />
with in the communique; I explained Australia's position; I associated Australia with<br />
the aspiration of achieving the goal of reduced greenhouse gas emissions but I pointed<br />
out the reasons for our reservations at Berlin.<br />
JOURNALIST: . that the Australian delegation moved to change the wording to ' reduction in<br />
growth', there was considerable argument about that. The final wording was<br />
' lower'._ a vaguer reading but still not as strong as the original resolution that was<br />
put up. Didn't we work fairly concertedly to water down the wording of the<br />
resolution ? 7<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, if we had, that wouldn't be inconsistent with what I've just said.<br />
JOURNALIST: there is general disagreement...<br />
PRIE MINISTER.-<br />
Well, I can only report to you what happened and what I report to you is that there<br />
was a change in the communique, some words that I put in but they were different<br />
from the original words and I had them put in because I wanted our position to be<br />
accurately reflected.<br />
JOURNALIST: Didn't Australia water down the original resolution?<br />
PRIME NISTER: </p>
<p>05/ 09/ 96 14: 16 Pg: 4<br />
W~ ell, you can't, at something like this unilaterally do anything. The amendment I put<br />
forward was accepted and if you are talking about the work that went on at the<br />
officials level, then there was a change made there because the original draft was<br />
factually inaccurate. It did not correctly reproduce what had been said at Berlin.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Prime Minister, France is back in as a dialogue member as of a meeting on Sunday....<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Well, I didn't know that. I'm grateful for the information.<br />
JOURNALIST: Australian officials have made it quite clear that it would be perhaps more fitting if they<br />
returned next year. What is your position on that?<br />
PRIME MiNISTER:<br />
Well, I don't know exactly what was said at the officials discussion on that but the<br />
indication I gave at the retreat yesterday was that I thought in principle France should<br />
come back and I was very happy to go along with the consensus about timing and if<br />
France... JOURNALIST: So you don't have a problem with them coming back in?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I don't. No look, once a decision has been taken to admit them as a dialogue<br />
partner, I don't think it matters.<br />
JOURNALIST: Buit doesn't it mean that the suspension has no practical effect?<br />
PRIME MINSTERNo<br />
it doesn't because the testing has stopped.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Prime Minister on your way here you said that you wouldn't be changing the policy on<br />
guest workers. What in once talked about the 1000 workers and their families<br />
coming back from.... .( inaudible)... What have you said to them about this...<br />
PRIME MINISTERFax<br />
from </p>
<p>05/ 09/ 96 14: 16 Pg:<br />
Well, our position is that we have a longstanding policy otf not having guest workers<br />
and there are all sorts of very strong policy reasons for that. We have a nondiscriminatory<br />
immigration policy and I've explained that to the one leader who raised<br />
the matter with me and that people are entitled to apply to emigrate to Australia in<br />
accordance with the criteria of that non-discriminatory policy but it would be very bad<br />
policy for us to water down our long standing objections to anything that represents<br />
the acceptance of guest workers. It would create all sorts of difficulties and wouild<br />
immediately open up requests from other countries to be given a similar treatment and<br />
we would have a whole new boundary of difficulty and argument and discord in<br />
relation to a policy area that is never very free from controversy.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there point when you see Australia become ( inaudible).., quite a large number of<br />
people coming back so...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I don't know how, as I am presently advised, you can deal with this problem<br />
which doesn't involve the introduction the concept of guest workers. I really don't,<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible).., and it now of growing international concern. Any changes in Australia's<br />
position? PRINIE MINISTER:<br />
No absolutely not. In the answers that I gave yesterday, I think contemplated<br />
possibility of a further strike and what I said in that context stands today. I know that<br />
some countries have been critical or equivocal, others have been quite firmly in<br />
support. I have no doubt at all that the stance the Australian Government has taken is<br />
correct and I've got little doubt that it will enjoy the support of most Australians. I<br />
notice that it has drawn the support of the Opposition Leader, Mr Beazley, I thank him<br />
for that, and it is important on issues like this that as far as possible there be<br />
bipartisanship and to the extent that the Opposition feels able to do that well that is<br />
good for the quality of decision making in Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Do you have any concern the France, Russia and Britain have expressed their<br />
reservations<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Did you say Britain?<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />

<p>Fax from 05/ 09/ 96 14: 16 Pg: 6<br />
Yes, some conservative leaders<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Which ones?<br />
JOURNALIST: Ted..( inaudible...)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Ted is always out of step with the regiment these days.<br />
JOURNALIST: On a personal note are you aware that you are developing a style as Prime Minister<br />
given it is your first overseas trip and if so, how would you define that style?<br />
PRIM MINISTER;<br />
Oh I wouldn't be so presumptuous as to say that I had a quieter style of diplomacy<br />
based on one visit. Perhaps in a year's time you might come back and ask me that<br />
question but I found the experience very valuable. I will as you know, be going to<br />
Japan and Indonesia in about eight days time and that's a very important visit. But it<br />
shouldn't be regarded as this particular visit and this particular forum shouldn't be<br />
played down simply because many of the member states are small. They comprise a<br />
disparate group of nations in a region that the rest of the world sees Australia having<br />
particular responsibilities in and for, and it's very important if we have a proper<br />
appreciation of our role in the world to see that. But give me a year or two and I<br />
might have some reflections on diplomatic styles.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard Malaysia's dialogue partner to the forum. Do you think that could<br />
increase the scope of the forum countries to influence the Malaysian Governinent in<br />
respect to the activities, some of themn criticised, the Malaysian company,<br />
particularly in Melanesia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I could, I wouldn't like to jump to any conclusions though.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you heard the news of the death of senior journalist Robert Haupt and what are<br />
your reactions? </p>
<p>Fafxo/ m09 / 96 14: 16 Pg: 7<br />
PRIME MYISTER:<br />
Well, I have and I'm very sorry to learn of that. Robert, who I knew quite well, I met<br />
him when I first went to Canberra in 1974 when he was a journalist for the Aulsiralian<br />
Financial Review, to which he ultimately returned, was one of the most elegant writers<br />
within the Canberra Press Gallery and generally that I've come across. He did write<br />
very well. In a comment I made last night to one of your colleagues I thought his stint,<br />
the pinnacle of his journalistic career was the time he spent in Moscow when the<br />
Soviet Union was disintegrating and he along with Monica Attard, who was then the<br />
ABC correspondent in the Soviet Union, demonstrated the very best qualities of<br />
accurate, interesting, descriptive journalism. I'm very sorry he died at a very young<br />
age. It is a loss to Australian journalism. He was a quality act as far a5 journalism is<br />
concerned and I send my sympathy to his family and friends. I know he'll be missed by<br />
many of his colleagues in Australia and in other parts of the world.<br />
