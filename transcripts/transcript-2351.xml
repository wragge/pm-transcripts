FOR PRESS PM. No. 5/ 1971<br />
A USTRALIA DAY MESSAGE 1971<br />
From the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
T his is the first Australia Day of our third century.<br />
We should regard it as a landmark for new endeavours<br />
to make Australia stronger and more self-reliant. I ask all Australians<br />
to treat it as a national day in the real sense...,. as a focus for what we<br />
are as a people and what we do as a nation.<br />
We move into our third century with a great many<br />
advantages denied to others. We are the only continent in the world<br />
inhabited by a single nation and we have in recent years discovered<br />
great wealth in our national resources. We have a steadily-increasing<br />
population and full employment.<br />
Although we are facing some economic challenges at the<br />
present time, we have an economy growing more varied every ) ear.<br />
This holds much promise for the future prosperity of our nation.<br />
But we must not forget that there is still a pioneering<br />
job to be done. We are taking on new responsibilities in our region and<br />
we have great tasks at home to tackle. This is not a time to be content<br />
with past achievements or to look for more leisure as a primary<br />
industrial goal It is a time to work to make sure we come to grips with<br />
current problems and to sustain our growth as a nation. It is a time<br />
to press ahead with development and expansion to eliminate poverty,<br />
to improve the quality of life, to take a more active interest in<br />
protecting our environment, and to support and promote our own<br />
Australian culture. If Australia Da y helps to gi us an awareness of all<br />
this, then it is a national day in the real sense.<br />
CANBERRA, January 1971 </p>
