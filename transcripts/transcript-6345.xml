CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN SUBURBAN NEWSPAPER ASSOCIATION<br />
SYDNEY 15 MARCH 1984<br />
I thank the Australian Suburban Newspaper Association for<br />
providing me with this opportunity to join you today.<br />
Your contribution is an important one. While you are part<br />
of the great tradition of the print media which makes such<br />
an essential contribution to the wellbeing of a democratic<br />
society, your specific role is only recently being<br />
appreciated for what it is.<br />
The phrases ' freedom of the press' free flow of<br />
information', ' open Government' may strike some people as<br />
cliches, but let us not mistake the importance of these<br />
concepts in the maintenance of a politically healthy<br />
society. They also go to the heart of what you are about. This<br />
seminar is about the future of your area of the print media.<br />
It is about the direction the suburban press is taking, and<br />
about how you will be ' piecing together' the future of your<br />
industry helping it to evolve as a positive and permanent<br />
part of our society's information resources.<br />
For the success of any enterprise believe one of the key<br />
factors must be genuine understanding of the purpose of the<br />
enterprise a firm commitment to what it is doing, where it<br />
is going, and an ability to communicate effectively.<br />
A Government, for example, that is confident of the wisdom<br />
of what it is doing is keen that its aims, policies and<br />
programs are well understood. It is concerned that all<br />
citizens are aware of what the Government is about and how<br />
its decisions will affect them, assist them and it needs<br />
to know what they think of Government initiatives and<br />
decisions. A participatory, reforming, open Government finds it vital<br />
to communicate. </p>
<p>This is my Government's approach we want to have the<br />
confidence and support of the people and we want to keep<br />
them informed by all the means that are available.<br />
For your part it appears that a fundamental question has to<br />
be answered if the purpose of your enterprise is to be<br />
understood. Why do people read the local press and what<br />
will see them continue to support it?<br />
A clue to the answering of this question may be taken from a<br />
further analogy with Government.<br />
The communication of policies is one important aspect of a<br />
Government's responsibilities and I will refer to that<br />
again. There is, however, the other side of the coin;<br />
namely, the need for genuine public response to its programs<br />
and policies.<br />
Major interest groups representing industry, labour and<br />
other well organised groups in our society have the ability<br />
to get their message across to get access to the national<br />
media and to speak directly to Government.<br />
What of course sometimes gets lost in the national debate is<br />
the voice of the man or woman in the street, the voice of<br />
the suburbs, of the outback and the remote areas. What are<br />
their views on what the Government is doing or should be<br />
doing? How do they feel about the implementation of new<br />
policies or proposed Government activities? Their opinions<br />
and activities will not often be newsworthy in a way that<br />
will attract interest in the metropolitan press or<br />
television. They will not be tighly organised but on a<br />
community by community basis they will often have a coherent<br />
point of view; a view which the local suburban press, for<br />
instance, can reflect.<br />
It is the ability to assimilate and reflect these community<br />
views which is part of the answer to the question of why<br />
people read the suburban press.<br />
The community's political representatives if they are<br />
doing their job well will be aware of this, and will come<br />
to recognise that you are the press of the small community<br />
and an important link if the community's views are to be<br />
fully understood.<br />
I would like to feel that the political representatives of<br />
the people, whether they be from Local, State or Federal<br />
spheres, could rely on your newspapers as a clear reflection<br />
of community views. Your newspapers present a means of<br />
communicating what is happening around us. This will be the<br />
sort of information and news that will not be reported by<br />
the metropolitan dailies or on television newscasts because<br />
it is thought to lack sufficient general interest, or cannot<br />
match up to some big national or international story. </p>
<p>This is of course to your advantage an area has been left<br />
to you in which opinion can be aggregated, information on<br />
local issues provided and loyalty to the local paper formed.<br />
No doubt you will all recognise this as a major task, a<br />
major concern of your industry, a major responsibility.<br />
Your communities rely on you and recognise that, while your<br />
publications have to rub shoulders with the so-called ' junk<br />
mail', you have something valuable to supply.<br />
In saying this, I recognise the catalyst to your industry is<br />
the interest advertisers have in a commercially attractive<br />
platform to merchandise their goods. I am convinced,<br />
nevertheless, that there remains plenty of room for your<br />
newspapers to establish distinctive voices for their<br />
individual communities. You have the opportunity which the<br />
metropolitans cannot match to provide complete coverage of<br />
a small community. You have a sound, intimate knowledge of<br />
that community and by providing your readers with useful<br />
reliable information, well-formed opinion and the chance to<br />
interact through your paper with the community, you will<br />
consolidate your unique position.<br />
May I give some examples where the Government wants to get<br />
its message through to the community at large, to the grass<br />
roots to the level where people need to understand policy<br />
and administrative arrangements if they are to benefit in<br />
the full from the measures we as a Government have taken on<br />
their behalf. Your papers have a real role in this regard.<br />
The introduction of Medicare was a decision taken by<br />
Government an important decision which was based on a firm<br />
mandate given to the Government by Australians at the last<br />
election. While Australians may have a grasp of the general<br />
sense, humanity and equity of the scheme, the Government has<br />
a continuing responsibility to ensure people know how it<br />
will assist them and what they should do to benefit fully.<br />
Now some of this information can be conveyed to the public<br />
by a national television campaign by showing someone like<br />
me filling in his Medicare enrolment form for example; but<br />
we would all recognise that this only accomplishes part of<br />
the exercise. This general information must be repackaged<br />
and reprocessed to answer the questions and problems of many<br />
individuals and special communities throughout the country.<br />
While there may be a Medicare Branch Office ' on the ground'<br />
in many suburbs as there may also be CES or other<br />
Commonwealth and State welfare agency offices there<br />
usually remains something of a gap between these agencies<br />
and the people they serve. </p>
<p>In this situation, the local press can play a very important<br />
role in helping to integrate and ' localise' these offices<br />
and the message they bring. You will both be serving the<br />
same community and your own expertise in communication by<br />
helping to make these agencies more a part of the community<br />
not just the furthest extension of a distant bureauracy.<br />
You will be helping people get the specific answers and<br />
assistance they need the sort of personal assistance that<br />
I would be the first to admit cannot be provided by guest<br />
appearances by well known personalities.<br />
A further example of a decision made at the Federal<br />
Government level which has had a real effect on the lives of<br />
many people in the suburbs of our large cities is the First<br />
Home Owners Scheme. This was a major decision benefiting a<br />
great number of needy Australians and is a significant<br />
element in the Government's national strategy of economic<br />
recovery. Apart from the initial coverage of the decision<br />
in the metropolitan press and television, there is a further<br />
need to ensure that those who most need this assistance are<br />
aware of its availability.<br />
The First Home Owners Scheme has been remarkably well<br />
received and I believe the Government has done a good job of<br />
communicating the essentials of the Scheme.<br />
There has been a national advertising campaign, and the<br />
Department of Housing and Construction provided explanatory<br />
material to groups contacting first home buyers real<br />
estate agents, builders, lending institutions -and set up<br />
special offices in the capital cities.<br />
Nevertheless it is the step to the local level -relating<br />
the general principles of the scheme to the particular case<br />
that is the most difficult. This will often have to be<br />
done on a one-to-one basis. A workable local communications<br />
system, of which the local press can be a focal point, can<br />
greatly assist in facilitating this final step.<br />
The free flow of information at all levels is a commitment<br />
of the Government. Since coming to office we have taken a<br />
number of important steps in this area:<br />
in the electronic communications arena, we have given<br />
the green light for the launch of Australia's domestic<br />
satellite system. A major aspect of this will be the<br />
ability to provide a greater variety of broadcasting for<br />
people throughout Australia. Part of this facility will<br />
be used by the ABC to put in place a second regional<br />
radio network; </p>
<p>we have introduced a Supplementary Licence Scheme to<br />
allow commercial television operators outside the five<br />
mainland capitals to provide their viewers and listeners<br />
with additional commercial radio and television<br />
services; we have continued the work initiated by the previous<br />
Labor Government in Freedom of Information. Amendments<br />
were passed last year to improve access provisions still<br />
further. The Government is currently reviewing and<br />
expanding its publicity program in this area; and<br />
the Government has taken steps to encourage innovative<br />
small businesses working in the communications<br />
technology area by ensuring the eligibility of software<br />
development for industrial research and development<br />
incentives. We have also expanded the AIDC's capital<br />
base to provide it with the option of investing in this<br />
and other technologically advanced areas of industry.<br />
As well, the Government has taken action to encourage<br />
the development of a venture capital market in Australia<br />
which should assist computer hardware and software<br />
producers.<br />
Nevertheless, in a society that is essentially pluralist and<br />
open, the Government is only responsible for facilitating<br />
the flow of information and ideas to assist those who wish<br />
to use or enlarge these facilities and techniques.<br />
Government is not in the business of attempting to direct<br />
what information, entertainment or data should have<br />
currency. This, as you would be the first to remind me, is<br />
particularly the case in the area of newspapers, which have<br />
a proud history of freedom with responsibility.<br />
The Commonwealth, however, has a responsibility to monitor<br />
the health of another important area of the media<br />
broadcasting. It is very conscious of the need to ensure<br />
that the flow of information in this area works freely and<br />
is not restricted by the process of media monoply.<br />
This is a particularly important issue when the public<br />
facility that is being used the broadcast spectrum is<br />
finite, and so provides an inherent limitation to<br />
competition. It is this issue the preservation of genuine<br />
variety and competition in broadcasting that my colleague<br />
the Minister for Communications has under review at present.<br />
Government information is also provided by way of media<br />
advertisement. These advertisements are often directed at<br />
the major press and television outlets. This is<br />
particularly the case where the advertisements are aimed at<br />
a national audience and carry a broad message voter<br />
enrolments, census publicity, small boat and road safety,<br />
and quarantine matters, for example. On these occasions,<br />
the campaign is like a major commercial advertiser selling a<br />
brand name. </p>
<p>There will be other occasions when the Government may wish<br />
to take a different approach. A case could be made out for<br />
extending coverage to the suburban press to ensure as<br />
complete a coverage as possible.<br />
There may also be a case for the Commonwealth placing some<br />
local advertising as opposed to national advertising.<br />
I understand, in fact, that various Government bodies and<br />
agencies, such as the Commonwealth Employment Service,<br />
Telecom, Australia Post and the Army Reserve, have taken<br />
advertising in the suburban press.<br />
The question of wider Commonwealth advertising in local<br />
newspapers is under consideration by the Department of the<br />
Special Minister of State.<br />
I am sure that you, as an industry, will be doing your best<br />
to convince Mick Young that you have something that he<br />
should be buying. That something worth buying is a high<br />
readership as well as a good numerical coverage of your<br />
area. The latter is an administrative, technical problem<br />
the former will be achieved by becoming further integrated<br />
into your community's activities. In other words by<br />
becoming its indispensible friend and ally.<br />
You became its friend and ally by serving it and seeking<br />
opportunities to give a lead where the community as a whole<br />
might become involved.<br />
A particular example of such an opportunity is our nation's<br />
Bicentenary celebrations. There will be national activities<br />
and national programs, but there will also of course be<br />
community activities. The Australian Bicentennial Authority<br />
is developing a network of Community Committees. I am sure<br />
there will be plenty of room for the local press to become<br />
involved. I note your program is quite realistically focusing on the<br />
contribution technology can make to doing your job better.<br />
The question could also be raised as to how far modern<br />
communications technology has the potential to bypass<br />
altogether your operations and those of the print media more<br />
generally. We are told that the new technology would be capable of<br />
allowing bill paying, banking, shopping, access to<br />
information and entertainment, and even fulltime work to be<br />
done without leaving the home. The very essence of the<br />
community personal interaction and shared activities<br />
between people in a defined geographical area could be<br />
threatened. </p>
<p>7.<br />
I would hope not. Indeed I would expect not. The face of<br />
the metropolitan press may be radically altered by<br />
technological innovation, but I suspect it will be highly<br />
resilient. National data banks are never likely to be a<br />
substitute for local interest and a reading public.<br />
Now is the time to bear down hard with your commitment to<br />
your unique enterprise to nuture and serve the small<br />
community. The questions you are asking at this seminar are legitimate.<br />
But through them all, I am convinced you have a role. It is<br />
an important one. Carried forward with sensitivity, it is a<br />
role from which all in the community stand to benefit. I<br />
hope this Conference will serve to refine and develop<br />
further general appreciation of that role. </p>
