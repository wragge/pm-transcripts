SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT.<br />
HON. R. G. MENZIES AT THE LIBE3E. L PARTY<br />
COUNCIL iMEETING IN CANBE RA, ON MONDAY<br />
14-TH NOVE3EK 1i60-. 2<br />
Mr. President and ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Before I begin I just want to say in amplification<br />
of what the President said about Mr. Holt, that he's not late<br />
just because he's late; he's late because the planCis<br />
delayed. Otherwise he was looking forward very keenly to<br />
being with us at the beginning of this meeting.<br />
. This meeting is, of course, so I gather, the last<br />
one that will occur before Election year. I don't know when<br />
the Election will be, but I do know it : rill be next year.<br />
And if we have our council meeting a little earlier than the<br />
usual :. ime, we will be at that stage, all taken up, no doubt,<br />
with clection ideas. Anyhow elections are a kind of fever<br />
that is inclined to grow for about t; welve months before the<br />
event. And, therefore, perhaps, this is a convenient time<br />
for taking stock, a little, of our policy I kno, th. re is<br />
going to be a good deal of discussion about the Platform a<br />
very convenient opportunity for looking around us and<br />
identifying, so far as we can, clearly, what lines we are<br />
following. And I want, as usual, to do that by taking up two<br />
broad topics: the first of them, naturally, the external<br />
position of Australia in the iorld; and the second, the<br />
domestic position. Because I venture to believe that on each<br />
of these matters something may be said which I hope ;. ill be of<br />
advantage to us.<br />
In the first place, talking about the external<br />
position. There is a problem which is constantly with us<br />
you see it occasionally reflected in various commentaries.<br />
And that is the problem of reconciling a good neighbour policy<br />
with our friends in asia, particularly, a good neighbour policy<br />
which we resolutely pursuereconciling that with our national<br />
duty to ourselves to strengthen our co-operative associations<br />
with the great powers of the Jestorn world.<br />
It is foolish for anybody to say that one . should be<br />
pursued to the extinction of the other. Jhat ie have to do is<br />
to keep them both in existunce and strengthen both of them as<br />
much as we can.<br />
Now, Sir, recently I went to the United N-tions.<br />
It is a strange expe..: ience, I confess. I had always escaped<br />
going there in the past, so that I was having my maiden effort.<br />
And the General Assembly of the United Nations is a very<br />
strange body 98 nations there, each ~ rith the same vote a<br />
country with half a million people having the same voting<br />
power as the United States of America; two countries of half<br />
a million each, able to out-vote the United States of America.<br />
Quite all right so long as the Genercl Assembly is a debating<br />
body, which it wacs designed to be,<br />
But as the new nations come into existence and<br />
there wero about 15 this year so it becomes very tempting to<br />
some people to throw the emphasis . away from the Security<br />
Council, which has some executive function, and into the<br />
General assembly, ihich was designed to have none, but in which<br />
votes, perhaps, may be more easily collected, than in the<br />
smaller body of the Security Council. </p>
<p>3,<br />
And therefore you may frequently find some Jestern<br />
powers voting on wvay, and some anothor, on almost any<br />
question that comes before the Assombly. To make a comparison<br />
between the utter monolithic solidarity of the Communists<br />
with the scattercd views of the democracios, is to compare<br />
utterly unlike things,<br />
Then in the third plac, it is a dangerous fallacy to<br />
talk about the " neutral" powers Many of then are uncommEittod,<br />
I agree. But neutral? lords can be used in a very loose<br />
fashion. India, for example, is supposed to have a doctrine<br />
of neutrality. In reality it is a doctrine of non-alignont.<br />
They won't enter into specific t-r atios with people they<br />
wouldn't cone in on the South-East Asian Treaty for exaple.<br />
But th; y are faithful nonbors of the United Ntions. And if<br />
the United Nations on sono occasion, were to pursue , war-like<br />
action to enforce sonathing, then I've not the slightost<br />
doubt that India would play India's part as a eombeu of the<br />
United Nations. Just as she sent troops to Korea in the<br />
Korean incident. So that that is one form of noutr: lisn, if you care<br />
so to describe it.<br />
There are other places in the world, not quite so<br />
conscious of the importance or comnanding significance of the<br />
United Nations, Xho ar neutral in the strict sense. That is<br />
to say, they say: " le will not fight anybody, except in<br />
defence of our own innediate frontiors. Apart from that, 1we<br />
accopt no obligation; we enter into no agruement"<br />
So there are two diffreiont kinds of noutralisi, you<br />
see. One is what I call a " participating" noutr-lism, under<br />
the United Nations Chartor; and the other is an " absolute"<br />
noutralism. Now it is very important that we should have these<br />
things in our ninds, because this movement to divide the<br />
United Nations up into three allogeod . roups, so that they any<br />
balance each other, can have enormously dangorous implications<br />
for . the iorld. First of all it would destroy the United NItions as a<br />
body possessing any cohesion. And in the second place it<br />
would tend to create hostilities and senses of difference,<br />
when perhaps tnhere was no occasion for either; tend to make<br />
us look at all the new African countries as if they were the<br />
sane kind of countries, the sarc kind of people, all to be<br />
put in a basket to ' thor and treated as the " nutral"<br />
countries, or the " unconnitted" countries of Africa.<br />
4o do :' avC some funny ideas in the ! orld. Nobody<br />
looking at Europe ever supposed that an Italian, and a<br />
Frenchman, and a German, and a Dutchman wore the sallo; that<br />
you could put thom : All into one neat package and say that they<br />
all possessed the European mind, or that they all possussed<br />
common interests in Europe. Th y do, I know, 3ut it has<br />
taken centurs to bring then to a point where, in the economic<br />
field, they co-operato, one with tho other, But nobody wrould<br />
droain of making that kind of error about Lurope<br />
But when we look at Africa with a dozen or twenty<br />
now nations in it, people are very m-uch inclined to lump them: i<br />
all tog. ther and say: " J11 there you aro; now all these<br />
people have just cono! e to . ndependonce. They are bound to havo </p>
<p>4<br />
the sane kind of ideas; you can put thrn together in a neat<br />
parcel and take it for granted that they will make a<br />
natural logical bloc, or group".<br />
Jell, I just don't believe it. The best speech, the<br />
greatest speech, that was delivered at the United Nations<br />
General Assembly in my hearing was that made by Sir Abubakar<br />
Balewa, the Prime Minister of Nigeria.<br />
Nigeria is the biggest single nation in Africa. It<br />
is four times the size of Ghana, its neighbour, though we've<br />
heard a good deal more about Ghana. The Prime iMinister of<br />
Nigeria is a man of quiet strength and authority and great<br />
wisdom and great experience. His balanced, measured<br />
utterance was so utterly inconsistent with any idea of forming<br />
a bloc, or of falling into the orbit of somebody else: it was<br />
indopeindnt, yet intelligent; it recognised the obligations<br />
to the world, and yet he was obviously setting out, loading<br />
his country in a proud destiny, friendly to the British,<br />
because the British had brought them to independence; an<br />
inheritor of all the best ideas in our own form of selfgovernment.<br />
A wise, strong, thoughtful man.<br />
Not all leaders are like that. Not all the<br />
countries in Africa produced i. mn of that type. There are<br />
some countries in Africa well advanced in the art and practice<br />
of Government like Nigeria. There are others who are just<br />
beginning in a very, very ' prentice fashion. They all<br />
deserve our interest; they all deserve our help. But don't<br />
lot us fall into the . rror of thinking that they are all the<br />
same. Because they are not,<br />
And that is why I believe that this mischievous<br />
proposal to divide the United N-tions, a proposal of which we<br />
have not yet heard the end, must be borne in mind by us so<br />
that we may resist it while we can.<br />
Now while I still believe, and believe without any<br />
reluctance, that we must pursue in Austr-lia our good<br />
neighbour policies with our Aisian friends, we must be willing<br />
to contribute to the oconomic advanceeont of these countries<br />
through the Colombo Plan, or South-, jast Asian freaty, or by<br />
whatever mechanism may exist. I believe all that. It<br />
doesn't need to be iade a matter of persuasion with this<br />
audience, that that is of very, very great importance.<br />
But I still you may call it antiquated, if you<br />
like, I don't mind but I still believe that the very<br />
foundation of our foreign policy, and of our defence policy is<br />
close cor. munion, close co-operation with the Commonwealth,<br />
and, of course, outstandingly, with the United Kingdom, close<br />
co-operation with the United States of America; and the<br />
making and maintenance of defensive arrangements such as those<br />
cohtained in the iNZUS pact, end the South-East Asian Treaty.<br />
These are the groat practical things which affect<br />
the security of Australia. Friendship with your neighbours<br />
that's good; that must be cultivatcd. Je must at all times<br />
look for ways and means of elimin-ting points of difference,<br />
so far as we can and there re not many points of<br />
difference. inust be helpful. m-Jues t be neighbourly.<br />
But in a practical world, it is essential that we<br />
should never forgot that it is upon the rock of the Coimmonwealth,<br />
and of the Com;: onwealth's association with the United<br />
States of ; America that our national security is built. </p>
<p>All I need add on that is that as the ANZUS Pact<br />
was negotiated by your present Government, and the South-Fast<br />
a. sian Treaty also, I think we can claim that in the field<br />
that I have just been discussing re have a respectable,<br />
concrete, constructive policy and achievement<br />
Now I just want to turn from that to the ever<br />
present domestic problem. And I'm going to say something<br />
about this, ; which is designed, I hope, to help you to meet<br />
certain criticism which I know commonly spring up.<br />
One of the great criticism that I hear, and that I<br />
read, because strangely enough we don't entirely live in an<br />
ivory tower, is that this Government changes its mind on the<br />
economic field too quickly, that it proceeds by " fits and<br />
starts". This is one of those easy, slick phrases that come<br />
trippingly to the tongue, c'nd therefore have groat currency<br />
" fits and starts". They do something now, and they do<br />
something quite different in six months' time.<br />
It is very odd if you consider that that<br />
criticism has validity that the country appears to have<br />
proceeded vwith such a remarkable degree of stability all<br />
these years; that really, the ship hasn't shown any signs of<br />
foundering. It has encountered storms; it has had its<br />
difficulties. But it goes on; its voyage continues. And<br />
for 99% of the people of Australia it is a very happy and<br />
successful voyage.<br />
Why t; hen is it said that we proceed by " fits and<br />
starts", that -Je change oar mind?<br />
Now the answer to that is, that the people who make<br />
those criticisms fail to understand the difference between an<br />
economic policy and the measures that you take to give effect<br />
to it. Because a policy may be constant; but the measures<br />
taken to give effect to it must vary from time to time<br />
according to the circumstances. To take , mother metaphor: the<br />
strategy remains the same, but the tactics have to<br />
accommodate themselves to the circumstances of the month, or of<br />
the year, or of the day, somletimoes<br />
It would be a very stupid GoveL'nnent, indeed, which<br />
having said " This is our policy: we believe in stabilising so<br />
far as iwe can the value of money. obee lieve in building up<br />
the population as much as we can. Je believe in having<br />
employment to the fullest extent" all this kind of thing<br />
if, having said that, it took no notice of the circumstances<br />
at all and just -went blithely on as if nothing had changed.<br />
Let me give you an exae. mple of that which is<br />
sufficiently detached from the Government to make one<br />
impartial about it.<br />
The Central Bank has an enormous responsibility in<br />
dealing with credit policy, in dealing with monetary supply.<br />
And one of the things that is available to the Central Bank<br />
for its purposes, is a certain instrument vrhich enables it to<br />
affect the liquidity of the trading banks and therofore their<br />
capacity to make advances to creditors. And that is the<br />
procedure of the Special Account, Special oeserve Deposits.<br />
If the Central Bank, desiring to maintain stability<br />
in the liquidity of the bank over a term, finds that the<br />
liquidity is getting too high and that advance policy is<br />
threfore making credit rather infltionary, it can call up<br />
the Special Account. ( I'lL call it " Special Account" because<br />
that was the old nare). It can call up deposits from the </p>
<p>S6<br />
Banks to Special Account. And that moans they take some of<br />
the liquidity out of the structure<br />
In three months' time, pursuant to the same policy,<br />
but dealing with the circumstances as they arise, it may be<br />
releasing money to the banks from Special Account in order to<br />
increase their liquidity. Because the circumstances change,<br />
quarteo' by quarter, You could, quite simply, draw a. graph<br />
showing what the normal movements of liquidity are in the<br />
Banking structure, quarter by quarter<br />
And a sensible Central Bank, it pulls in or it puts<br />
out, according to the circumstances of the time. Because its<br />
objective is to maintain a steady management of the liquidity<br />
position of the banks.<br />
Nobody says that the Central Bank is proceeding by<br />
" fits and starts". Because most people, I think, realise<br />
that that is what a Central Bank is for. A Central Bank<br />
ought to be watching things every weok, and ovury mont.. and<br />
it does and taking whatever adjusting steps are within its<br />
power to achieve its overall purpose, -ind the same is true<br />
about Goveirnmonts, Unless you are prepared to make your policy apply<br />
to changing circumstances, then your policy will co-me to ruin.<br />
Now what is our broad policy? I won't profess to<br />
state it exhaustively, but I will mention eight or nine<br />
aspects of it. You need have no fear that I am going to<br />
elaborate them. Nor do I put them in any order of significance<br />
but just as they come to the mind.<br />
To restrain inflation: Now that is a great<br />
principle of policy. It is not very easy. Certainly not<br />
something that can be done by a singlo stroke, or a single<br />
act not at all. To restrain inflation involves the use of<br />
a variety of weapons, from the Central Banking procedures<br />
outward. And those weapons must be used according to the<br />
circumstances of the time. You may tighten up on credit today;<br />
you may loosen up on credit in throo months' ti~ u. Both will<br />
be pursuant to the same policy.<br />
Recently to take the most up to date example<br />
we announced early this year do you remember? I announced<br />
myself a four-point progranr; e, one of the points being that<br />
we would strongly support the Central Bank in its restraint<br />
upon credit. And we still continue to say that.<br />
But we know perfectly well that a restraint upon<br />
credit, which may have to be particularly powerful in a<br />
particular time of the year, for a variety of reasons, , ay<br />
ultimately have to be eased out so that you don't get too<br />
acute a deflationary effect.<br />
And so it is quite possible to be restraining credit<br />
hard in December, and letting credit out in June:<br />
These are not inconsistencies-, these are merely the<br />
sensible applications of the one policy, the policy being to<br />
restrain inflation. And, of course, under our current<br />
circumstances something intimately associated with . it to<br />
protect agcinst undue run-down our oversas reserves.<br />
! eo have a policy a second item in our policy to<br />
maintain employment. This is treendously important,<br />
socially 2-nd htumanly, in the country. </p>
<p>0 7.<br />
But full employment sometimes becomos, as at present,<br />
in at least Now South Jales and Victoria, over full employment,<br />
with all the consequent troubles of increased turnover, loss<br />
of efficiency, increased costs. And a Government must watch<br />
that kind of thing, ready, occasionally to help, whore there<br />
is some unemployment developing, by making provision for loan<br />
money and so on, as we have from time to time in the course of<br />
the last few years; ready, on other occasions, to put some<br />
pressure on the economic system to reduce the liquidity of the<br />
banks, to reduce, or control, advances of credit, partly so<br />
that over-full employment nay not exist or be continued, with<br />
all its evil, econoic consequences.<br />
, Jc have a policy to build up population. And, in<br />
fact, that has been maintained, I think, remarkably, when one<br />
considers the aspects of this matter which, from year to year,<br />
have m , de us wonder whether the inflationary pressures of<br />
population growing at this rate by migration, were not too<br />
great. But we have in that particular matter accepted the<br />
risk. And I think with the warm approval of the people of<br />
Australia. The result is that the country is far richer, far<br />
more productive, far more solidly based, far nore capable of<br />
resisting depression, than it was 10 years ago, if only because<br />
it has all those hundreds of thousands, and now w ll over a<br />
million, of people who have come from other parts of the world,<br />
and have brought their own skills, and their own contribution<br />
vith them. -o have a policy to develop our basic resources.<br />
hnd we have had the opportunity of giving effect to that in<br />
some rather dramatic ways, the most dramatic, of course, being<br />
the great Snowy Mountains Scheme. Another one in Queensland<br />
on which we have ultimately been able to make most helpful<br />
arrangements, is the Mt. Isa Railway in Quoensland. One could<br />
give other examples. But these are just sufficient to point<br />
out that this is one of our great items of policy; that the<br />
country's basic resources should be developed.<br />
But they won't be developed if we lose control of<br />
the value of monoy, if inflation gets utterly out of hand.<br />
Because unless inflation can be checked, sometimes by stern<br />
measures, always unpopular measures, then we will find that<br />
the money is losing its value so quickly that loans will fail,<br />
we will have to redeem all the war loan that comes in for<br />
conversion, instead of having it converted into new loans,<br />
and the effect of that on the Budget could very well be<br />
disastrous. Therefore while we seek to develop our resources,<br />
don't get the ida into our minds that you just have to think<br />
of something, put it down, and start doing it. Because<br />
whether you can do it at any particular tin will depend, very<br />
largely, on your general view of your economic and particularly<br />
your currency position at any given romnt,<br />
Another item of our policy is to encourage<br />
production. And I venture to say that there has been a very<br />
considerable anount of success in that field, for which<br />
Liberalism all over Australia. Federal and State, I think, can<br />
claim considerable credit-the oncourago. ont of production<br />
primary productions, secondary productions. But that doesn'tmean<br />
you simply say, " Jell that's our policy. Therfore<br />
anybody who wants a protective tariff can have it. Come<br />
along in the . orning and get it". No. </p>
<p>In all these natters there must be judgucnt as to<br />
the merits of the proposal, as to how it fits in with the<br />
general community interest. And if you are going to have<br />
judgient of that kind, then you don't exercise it on January<br />
1st and call it something done for the rest of the year<br />
Because the thing about judgment is that judgment has to be<br />
exurcised every day of the year, as all the circumstances<br />
change or develop or w. hatever may occur to then.<br />
We have a policy to increase our markets overseas.<br />
This is one of the great problems on which I believe<br />
immennsely good work has been done. And I pay tribute to my<br />
colleague, the Minister for Trade, for what he has done in<br />
that field by his terrific energy and enthusiasm. I believe,<br />
and he believes, that we have just scratched the surface, in<br />
effect, so far that there are rmarkets available for<br />
Australia, not just for :. ustralian wool, or whatever it nay<br />
be, bu: for things that we make in Australia, things that we<br />
process in Australia markets available which will surprise<br />
us if we can go about getting them in the right way.<br />
But wo will have to find out the circumstances of<br />
every case. W. e may have to adopt methods that are new in<br />
some old countri. s, and m. ethods that are old in some other<br />
countries. Judgeont, judg. ent has to be exercised fron day<br />
to day and from month to month.<br />
But if it turns out that some trade promotion<br />
policy is adopted in Country A and happens to be exactly the<br />
opposite policy to the one employed in Country C, I hope I<br />
won't be told that we don't know our own minds. On the<br />
contrary. It will be the best proof that we do know our own<br />
minds, and know how to deal with individual cases in an<br />
individual way.<br />
I mentioned earlier about our reserves. That is<br />
another great item of policy. Continuity of trade is<br />
essential to Australia. Joe are one of the great trading<br />
nations of the world, in absolute terms.<br />
Some countries have a tiny fraction of their total<br />
trade moving across the seas. We have an enormous fraction of<br />
ours. We are intrinsically one of the groat trading countries<br />
of the world. For the maintenance of our standards of living, so<br />
high, as they are, it is . ssential that we should at all times<br />
be able to ensure the continuity of trade, ensure a reasonable<br />
flow of imports, to match an outflow of exports by maintaining<br />
overseas financial reserves which will act as a buffer against<br />
a sudden decline in export incone, or a sudden onrush of<br />
imports. All this, in a financial sense, is quite ele: entary.<br />
But to maintain reasonable reserves abroad again requires, not<br />
some dogmatic idea that having said something goes in March,<br />
you must continue to do the -same thing in Septoeber, but a<br />
sensible approach which says to you: " You watch your<br />
reserves; if they are building up, then you nay be in a<br />
position even to encourage a further inflow of goods into the<br />
country; if they are not building up, but are running down,<br />
then you must watch that. Because after all, if you get to a<br />
point you nay have to do something rather drastic about<br />
imports" and that is the last thing that I want to have to<br />
do, nor am I contemplating it " but you may have to take<br />
measuros." And, of course, on top of all that, don't forgot </p>
<p>4 0 9,<br />
that the flexible, and yet successful way in which these<br />
things have been handled, has been looked at by the rest of<br />
the world. The most important critics are not those in some<br />
newspaper here. The most important critics are the shrewd<br />
people overseas who have their on. funds to invest and who<br />
:: ako it their business to know exactly what the economy of the<br />
country is in which they propose to make an investnont, Those<br />
arc the people whose opinion may be valued.<br />
And with all our " fits and starts", a few years ago<br />
I was able to say to you that private inflow of capital<br />
anounted to Å 100 millions a year. In the last financial year<br />
it :' a: munted to Å 200 illions.<br />
It is important fron our point of view, not only to<br />
the dcveloplent of our oconory, to the onploynent of our<br />
people, but also to the mnaintonance of adequate reserves<br />
abroad that we should continue to enjoy this inflow of<br />
capital. That is our policy. It is not the policy of our<br />
opponents. But it:. n ours. And because that is our policy, it<br />
becones even more important that we should constantly watch<br />
the novenonts of inflation or deflation; the novenonts of<br />
credit expansion; or of credit contraction; the ! ovenents<br />
of our overseas reserves. Because, it is upon the securing by<br />
flexible judgnent from. month to month of the best results for<br />
stability, that this great inflow of capital will depend.<br />
If the oconony of ustralia " was as jorky, as<br />
uncertain, as sonoe wishful thinkers would have us believe, we<br />
w:.. uldn't be receiving the tangible confidence of the business<br />
world to the extent that we have been receiving it. And it<br />
is vastly i. iportant, thierfore, that all of you who are so<br />
imiportant in this org: nization who carry so n: uch authority<br />
in this organization should find yourselves able to reject<br />
some of these superficial criticisis, and to understand why it<br />
is that a donestic econolic policy which isn't flexible, which<br />
isn't prepared to appear to reverse direction in throe :. nths<br />
or six : onths, would be a dangerous policy,<br />
Jo have another iteo of policy and I will just<br />
iontion it before I co:"., ude, to increase facilities for<br />
higher educ. tion.<br />
Now this is a : atter of . reat contention. The<br />
Conn: onwealth bean, at the tine we ca-o back into office,<br />
apart fron finding sone fees for rehabilitation of trainees<br />
and so on after the war, had no educational obligations in<br />
terns of n onky outside its own turritorios. None. I because<br />
I confess that it all bogan with me said, "! WJe , ust do<br />
son thing about the Universities because the Universities are<br />
going to close unless we do. No State can carry the burden of<br />
University training to the extent that it is going to. be<br />
doeandod in this country".<br />
Dea: r no. e Every figure that the Murray Com r: ission<br />
set down by way of prophecy of University population has been<br />
falsified. Before we are ten years older we will have a<br />
hundred thousand people qualified for, and deoanding University<br />
education. The capital expenditure, the whole vista, even<br />
as one could see it eight years ago, was quite appalling, and<br />
to my nind, something that no State, within the normal<br />
reasonable liiits of its 2udoet, could hope to accomplish.<br />
The only alternative then, would be enorrous<br />
increases in fees, sonething which would frustrate University<br />
develop: ont, or so; ething that me waits for rather in vain in<br />
a country where ther are rich people, a nuch nore<br />
enlightened outlook on the responsibility of the rich for their<br />
Universities, than we have seen so far, </p>
<p>I mention that just for good measure. Because if<br />
one goes to America one sees exactly the opposite so<br />
remarkably deoonstrated.<br />
Now we have taken it on. Je had the Murray<br />
Colmi. ttee's report. Je adopted it. It cost the Commionwealth<br />
over a three-year period, Å 20 nillion. This, as we looked at<br />
it at that tin, was a fabulous sun of money. We have just<br />
had the first report of the Universities Commission for the<br />
second three years and the Commonwealth contribution goos from<br />
to Å 39 million, and the States even greater.<br />
Now why an I mentioning that to you? Just to say,<br />
"!" hat a good boy". No, not at all. But to point out to you<br />
that the people who are constantly coning along and saying,<br />
" If you can do it for the Universities, you can do it for<br />
everybody else, for every other kind of school" have no<br />
conception of the financial implications of these matters.<br />
WJhen this thing be an eight years ago, nine years<br />
ago, whenever it was, one or two of my colleagues said. to no,<br />
very sensibly, that " if you once Jet into this field, you will<br />
be told you have to find money for secondary education as such<br />
and primary education as such, and aren't we buying into a<br />
dangerous field?".<br />
Perhaps in my folly I said: " If we can strike a good<br />
blow for the developnont of the Universities, the tertiary<br />
educational places in . ustralia, we will do something that<br />
will have its reaction on all foris of education and training<br />
in Australia, and we will deserve well of the Republic.<br />
So, I tell you about that in order that you nay<br />
understand quite clearly that in this great field we have<br />
voluntarily, with no constitutional obligations whatever,<br />
accepted these phenon. enal financial responsibilities. And we<br />
ought to be busy naking it clear to people, how good this is,<br />
how great this is for a great . ustralia in the future,<br />
instead of succumbing to the rather slick logic of the people<br />
who say, " Well if you can find it for one purpose, you can<br />
find it for another".<br />
The ninth principle of policy is to . aintain<br />
industrial continuity of work on just terms. And there again,<br />
to -n astonishing extent, this has been achieved. oJ have<br />
been flexible. ' o have from time to time rade changes in the<br />
industrial arbitration structure, admittedly one of then<br />
forced on us by a High Court decision, but the others were nade<br />
as an exercise of judS-ecnt from time to time. In the result,<br />
while all stoppages, or threats, are well advertised, the fact<br />
is that there has been a grator cntinuity of work, and<br />
therefore a greater effective contribution to productive<br />
effort in Australia, in the last ten years, than I can ever<br />
rcnober before in the political history of the country.<br />
Now, Sir, all those things are our policy. As I have<br />
said to you, they all require individual treatment: you ust<br />
adapt your tactics to the circumstances of the time your<br />
fiscal action, your credit controls, your import policies. All<br />
these things must be applied with intelligence, with jud. ment.<br />
-e must never be afraid to undo what we have done, when undoing<br />
it was always contemplated at the time we did it, as one of<br />
these flexible instruments of policy. 4 e are not to be<br />
nervous about that. worn't have been changing our policy.<br />
! e will have been giving effect to it.<br />
Now I hope that what I have been saying to you on<br />
that field doesn't strike you as too much of a technical, or </p>
<p>acadeniic exercise2. it isn't. I think there is nothing nero<br />
iipcrtant than that we should into the last year of a<br />
Parlia;:-' nt, not barren of ideas for the futuro, but thiat weo<br />
should go in, feecling, a proper ) rido in what, between us all,<br />
we have been able to do, feecling a. proper confidencoe in the<br />
future of the country.<br />
I don't believe for one riont, havin., rcigarcl to<br />
tho history of our land and its rcent experiences, that the<br />
people of ! Australia are to hand the n--attor over to<br />
people whe have shown a much -re. ator faculty for quarrelling<br />
xd th cach other, than they ever have for understanding-the<br />
sinplost problem of the nationm I don't think t hat is going to<br />
! appon. But we aite no,-t to live enmtirely on the division of<br />
our enemies. it is fa-r better to live with-pride, with<br />
co. ur. cy. e, with co. nfidenco in our ' own faith-and in our<br />
righIt. ( a. pplausc) </p>
