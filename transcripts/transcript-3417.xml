PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 343<br />
October 1974<br />
INDUSTRIES ASSISTANCE COMMISSION REPORT FOOD PROCESSING<br />
MACHINERY, ETC.<br />
The * Prime Minister, Mr Whi'tlam, announced today that<br />
the Government has accepted, subject to international commitments,<br />
the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission in its<br />
report on food processing machinery.<br />
The report covers a wide range of machinery used in<br />
bread grain milling; for the working of cereals or dried.<br />
leguminous vegetables; in sugar manufacturing; in brewing,<br />
confectionery or chocolate manufacture; and the preparation of<br />
meat, fish, fruit or vegetables.<br />
The Government's decision will mean that minimum<br />
rates of duty will apply to machinery for working bread grains,<br />
cereals or dried leguminous vegetables~ and for the production of<br />
pasta products; a General rate of 15% will apply to machinery<br />
for sugar manufacturing, brewing, and confectionery and<br />
chocolate manufacture; and a General rate of 25% will apply to<br />
other food processing machinery under reference.<br />
In the main the decision will mean a reduction in the<br />
existing rates of duty, but for some goods there will be a slight<br />
increase in protection for imports from Britain, a major source<br />
of supply. Implementation of the Commission's recommendations<br />
would have little effect on the structure of industry and the<br />
employment involved because the industry enjoys a degree of<br />
local advantage. Mr Whitlam also said that details of the Customs tariff<br />
changes arising from the Government's decision will be announced<br />
when administrative arrangements to implement them have been<br />
