    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was very saddened to learn of the death of Kim Beazley, the former Whitlam Government Minister. </p>
<p>Sustained by a strong Christian faith, he was a man of very high principle who gave a lifetime of service to his country, the parliamentary system and the Australian Labor Party.</p>
<p>Kim Beazley was a dedicated Education Minister during the Whitlam Government. As a very junior member of parliament at that time, I greatly respected his debating skills and his courteous attention to inquiries. He was a wonderful parliamentarian.</p>
<p>His demeanour and behaviour both in the Parliament and in the general discharge of his responsibilities as a minister set a very high standard.</p>
<p>I extend my sympathy and that of the Government and my wife Janette to his widow Betty, his children Kim and Merrilyn and the other members of his close and loving family.  </p>
