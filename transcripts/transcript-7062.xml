TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH THE MINISTER FOR ARTS,<br />
HERITAGE AND ENVIRONMENT, MR COHEN, AND THE MINISTER FOR PRIMARY<br />
INDUSTRY, MR KERIN MONDAY 15 DECEMBER 1986<br />
PM: The Cabinet has had a lengthy consideration of the question<br />
of protecting National Estate values in Tasmania forests. It's<br />
made a decision that it will oppose forestry operations in<br />
National Estate areas of Tasmania until it can be satisfied that<br />
National Estate values are protected, or that there are not<br />
feasible alternatives. We want, as you will see from our press<br />
statement from the decision of Cabinet, to have the co-operation<br />
of the Tasmanian Government in this matter. To that intent the<br />
Minister, Mr Kerin, will actively pursue negotiations with his<br />
counterpart in Tasmania, Mr Groom, with a view to reaching<br />
agreement on feasible alternatives to forestry operations<br />
continuing in the National Estate areas. we would hope to secure<br />
such agreement, but in the event that that's not possible then we<br />
would seek, ourselves, to establish a review process. But we<br />
hope if the consultation with the Tasmanian Government doesn't<br />
produce agreement that they would, themselves, agree to a review<br />
process to examine the question of a feasible and prudent<br />
alternative. As I say, if we can't get that position, and we<br />
will try very hard to get it, then we would establish those<br />
review mechanisms ourselves. We have taken this decision<br />
conscious of the responsibility that we, as a national<br />
government, have to protect the National Estate. We also take<br />
the decision, in the way we have, conscious of the importance of<br />
the forestry industry to the State of Tasmania. We believe that<br />
if the processes we have decided upon are followed that there<br />
need not be any loss of jobs in Tasmania, because there are ample<br />
feasible alternative sources of supply available to replace those<br />
in the areas in question. We say therefore, as is indicated in<br />
the press release, we see no reason why a single job need be lost<br />
as a result of the Government's decision. I hope that as a<br />
result of the lengthy consideration that has been given to this<br />
important matter, and the decision that's been taken, that we're<br />
going to have a position in which those who properly have a deep<br />
concern for the preservation of the National Estate in this<br />
country, and those who, on the other hand, perhaps prime interest<br />
is the question of the economics of the forestry industry will be<br />
able to come together in a way which will produce a result which<br />
is acceptable. I make the point that really what is involved is<br />
in a sense ultimately testing a position which is common to the<br />
two protagonists, if you like. Let me make it clear, the<br />
conservation movement assert, and have asserted consistently,<br />
that there is no need to proceed with forestry* </p>
<p>operations in the areas in question because there are ample<br />
feasible, prudent alternatives outside those areas. on the other<br />
hand, the Tasmanian Government and the Forestry Commission there<br />
and the industry disputes that proposition. So it seems to us<br />
sensible that that fundamental position be tested. We do not<br />
seek, as a Commonwealth Government, to impose a judgement upon<br />
Tasmania. That is not consistent with the approach to decision<br />
making which my Government has followed from the first day we've<br />
been in office. We seek co-operation of the Tasmanian Government<br />
and I hope that as a result of the discussions that John Kerin<br />
will be having with his counterpart, that that will be<br />
forthcoming. But we as a government are committed to processes<br />
which, as I say, will do all within the power of this government<br />
to protect National Estate values.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you believe that jobs will be now lost<br />
as the ACTU has said, because you have made a decision on this<br />
issue? PM: No. As I said in my statement, there cannot, I believe, be<br />
any argument as to the immediate availability of alternative<br />
resources and provided the Tasmanian Government is co-operative<br />
those alternative resources can be turned to now while the<br />
processes of consultation and, if necessary, review are<br />
undertaken. JOURNALIST: Who's going to conduct the review?<br />
PM: What the decision makes clear is that we would seek, as I<br />
say, to get co-operation of the Tasmanian Government and if they<br />
will agree we can consult together on the composition of that<br />
review. And I hope that will be the case, that we can get their<br />
co-operation, if not then we would have to, ourselves, establish<br />
that review. We have made no decision as to composition, but the<br />
Cabinet decision leaves the composition of that review body to<br />
myself and John and Barry.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Prime Minister, it does seem that the underlying<br />
thread of your announcement is that if it comes to a choice<br />
between jobs and the environment this government will choose to<br />
maintain jobs. Is this a fair summary?<br />
PM: I don't think that puts it properly. You'll see at the<br />
beginning of the press release that we have issued, we are saying<br />
we are opposing forestry operations in National Estate areas of<br />
Tasmania until we're satisfied that National Estate values are<br />
protected, or there are not feasible alternatives. On the<br />
information available to us, we believe that you needn't<br />
necessarily be looking at one, or the other, and an essential<br />
part of decision we've taken is really to test the issue which is<br />
common to both sides. I repeat, the conservationists are saying<br />
and I accept the integrity with which they are putting their<br />
position they say, don't paint us as not having a concern for<br />
jobs. Don't paint us as saying we are not concerned with<br />
peoples' employment. They are saying that they believe that<br />
without proceeding, and certainly without proceeding at this<br />
point, into National Estate areas there are adequate viable and<br />
prudent alternatives. what the decision of the Cabinet provides<br />
is a process of testing that. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, if logging does start in either the<br />
, Lemonthyme or Southern Forests area, how effective a blocking<br />
measure can the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act be?<br />
PM: We believe that it does provide power to the Commonwealth.<br />
Obviously, in the division of powers that exists between the<br />
Executive and the Parliament, and the judiciary, we do not have<br />
the final right to determine what that power is. We believe the<br />
power exists, but ultimately it is a matter which may be tested<br />
in the High Court.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Cohen, are you disappointed you were unable to<br />
announce today no logging no matter what?<br />
COHEN: I'm delighted with the decision Cabinet's made.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you think a similar inquiry process<br />
would be appropriate to resolve the question of new mining in<br />
Kakadu Stage III?<br />
PM: We'll be dealing with the question of Stage III in the<br />
Cabinet tomorrow. Cabinet will be making its decision there, and<br />
it's my judgment we'll be making an appropriate decision in those<br />
circumstances. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, is it unlikely the Tasmanian Government<br />
will co-operate?<br />
PM: I hope not. We sought, when we first came to government in<br />
regard to the dam, to get co-operation. It wasn't forthcoming.<br />
I would hope the Government and the people of Tasmania would see<br />
from the events there that this is a government which seeks to<br />
get resolutions by way of co-operation. We believe there is a<br />
way through by co-operation. So I hope that arises. I'm not<br />
here to be seen as waving big sticks. It ought to be established<br />
now, after about four years in government, that's not my way of<br />
doing things or the way of my government. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: How much longer will this decision allow logging in<br />
Jackeys Marsh and particularly if there is any inclination to<br />
continue logging next year, would the Government also invoke the<br />
World Heritage Conservation Act as you suggest<br />
PM: No, as we understand it now and as we are given to<br />
understand from some discussions with some representatives of the<br />
conservation movement there is a clear understanding that this<br />
season's operations in Jackey's Marsh are virtually completed.<br />
There is not very long to go and the conservation movement, as we<br />
have spoken to them, accepts the reality that it can be<br />
completed. But the decision takes the view that in the general<br />
review that will emerge from these processes it is appropriate<br />
for the question of alternatives, feasible and prudent resources<br />
to be applied to the consideration of Jackey's Marsh. But as to<br />
the application of the World Heritage protection mechanism, it is<br />
identified as being appropriate to the two areas of the National<br />
Estate, that is Lemonthyme and the Southern Forest.<br />
JOURNALIST: So you haven't got that off the agenda with Jackey's<br />
Marsh? PM: Well, it is conceded I mean by all those involved that the<br />
same considerations do not apply to Jackey's Marsh and the<br />
Douglas River area.<br />
COHEN: It is not considered. Even the conservation movement<br />
doesn't consider that Jackeys Marsh is of World Heritage status<br />
or Douglas River.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you prepared to take these two areas to the<br />
World Heritage courts to protect them?<br />
PM: Well, I made it clear in an earlier answer that in one way<br />
or another it is quite possible that you will get to the High<br />
Court on this issue. What we have made clear in our decision that<br />
we are prepared to use those powers that we believe do exist<br />
under that legislation. Now, as I say in one way or another that<br />
may be tested. But we think it is an appropriate head of power.<br />
JOURNALIST: What will you do if Mr Gray moves into those areas<br />
next week and starts logging?<br />
PM: Well, quite clearly the decision is unequivocal. We say that<br />
we would oppose that and then it would be up to us to use our<br />
powers. That would presumably and obviously have to be advised by<br />
our legal advisers but in those circumstances you would seek an<br />
injunction seeking to use that power.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Kerin, do you see this decision consistent with<br />
your role as Primary Industry Minister, that is the development<br />
of primary industry n this country?<br />
KERIN: I think one thing you have to focus on Greg, is that what<br />
we are doing today is still giving the Memorandum of<br />
Understanding a chance to work. That was negotiated over six<br />
months and if the Tasmanian Government is prepared to look at<br />
this whole question of prudent and feasible alternatives we still </p>
<p>maintain the position of trying to get a balance between<br />
environment and jobs which is what the basic decision was. Today<br />
is actually the anniversary of the Cabinet decision we took a<br />
year ago. So the same things are on the board. We want to give<br />
the MOU a chance to work. It is all about a balance between<br />
environment and jobs. And that is the way it has always been.<br />
What we want to do here is test the prudent and feasible<br />
alternative and/ or sequencing of forestry operations.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, in the Parliament you gave an<br />
unequivocal guarantee that the Government would fight<br />
Peko-Walisend in the court if it sought to exercise mining.<br />
Is your resolve as strong in this case as it was against Peko on<br />
the Kakadu issue?<br />
PM: of course our resolve is as strong. We have got a position<br />
in regard to the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth's powers<br />
up there which are different from the situation in regard to<br />
Tasmania. JOURNALIST: Mr Kerin, have you got any idea in terms of the<br />
total area and volume that would constitute a feasible set of<br />
alternatives? KERIN: Well, there's lots of figures around. If I can just give<br />
an example. The National Estate value on the Lemonthyme is the<br />
visual values from the world Heritage area adjacent. The<br />
Tasmanian Government wants to log about 40% of that area over<br />
years. In terms of the size of those coops, in terms of the<br />
sequence of operations, what we would be looking at is areas that<br />
are available to the Tasmanian Forestry Commission whether or not<br />
that logging needs to go ahead now. And that is a perfectly<br />
reasonable, rational approach and I believe that if the Tasmanian<br />
Forestry Commission co-operates and gives us an idea of their<br />
logging proposals we may be able to get a more prudent and a more<br />
feasible alternative than what we have confronting us at present.<br />
JOURNALIST: You have alreay had talks with Mr Groom. How<br />
hopeful are you that he will be co-operative this time?<br />
KERIN: I had one conversation with Mr Groom today just out of<br />
courtesy to advise him of what had been vocadexed down to him. I<br />
hope to see him on Wednesday or Thursday this week, probably<br />
Thursday. JOURNALIST: What was his response?<br />
KERIN: He appreciated the courtesy of letting him know.<br />
JOURNALIST: If at the beginning of next seasons logging they go<br />
back into Jackeys marsh, what action are you prepared to take<br />
there? Is there any, action<br />
PM: I am not going into hypotheticals. What I rest upon and-what<br />
the Government rests upon is the decision and that is that we<br />
have attempted to set up a process of consultation and/ or review.<br />
And ' the answer that I gave earlier and that John has given is<br />
valid. We hope to get that process of co-operation through the </p>
<p>consultation or review process to which they agree. I don't think<br />
anyone's interest is served by dealing with that hypothetical<br />
question. We have said that we believe that the realistic thing<br />
now, given that the committee has looked at Jackey's Marsh, is to<br />
allow this season's operations to finish. They are virtually<br />
finished now. But we believe it is appropriate to include<br />
Jackey's Marsh in that overall review process. Now that is our<br />
decision and no one's interest is served by becoming hypothetical<br />
about a years time.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have the Tasmanian loggers got any option but to go<br />
into those areas? Is there enough areas outside<br />
PM: I would have thought that if there is one thing that is<br />
clear out of the decision we have taken that that is the precise<br />
question that is an issue and we are. trying to set up a process<br />
for establishing that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, it could be argued that if the National<br />
Estate is to be conserved that the cost of that preservation<br />
should be undertaken by the nation as a whole and not Tasmania<br />
alone. If possible alternatives are not an economic proposition<br />
for logging, does the Federal Government stand ready to weigh in<br />
with a subsidy to preserve the National Estate forests in<br />
Tasmania. PM: well, that question is both irrelevant and hypothetical at<br />
this stage because what we are doing is the same comment that I<br />
made before to the previous questi-on is that we are about testing<br />
the question of the existence of adequate prudent alternatives.<br />
Now, quite clearly if the outcome of that inquiry is to show that<br />
there are then the question doesn't arise. And again no one's<br />
interests are served by addressing what at this stage must be by<br />
definition entirely a hypothetical question.<br />
