POR PRESS: PM No. 49/ 1971<br />
TASMANIAN SHIPPING CRISIS<br />
Statemnt . y tePieMinister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
A deputation led by the Acting Premier of Tasmania, the Honourable<br />
K, C. Lyons, M. H. A. had discussions with the Commonwealth Government in Canberra<br />
thlis morning. In addition to the Acting Premier, the deputation included the Leader of<br />
the Opposition, Mr. E. t. Reece, M. H. Mr. A. N. Currie, President of the<br />
Tasmanian Trades Labour Council and Mr. M. J. Overland, Secretary/ Manager<br />
of the Tasmanian Chamber of Manufactures. Commonwealth Ministers present were<br />
the Prime Minister, Mr. McMahon, Mr. Nixon, Minister for Shipping &amp; Transport,<br />
M. Lynch, Minister for Labour National Service, and Senator Wright.<br />
The fundamental purpose of the deputation was to take up with the Commonwealth<br />
; he need to seek arrangements which, recognising the special position of Tasmania,<br />
woild be directed to providing the Tasmanian community, in the longer term, with<br />
ome assurance that employment and business activity, and thus the welfare of the<br />
06' mmunity, would be protected from the serious damage wItch would otherwise<br />
occur as a result of disputes involving shipping services. The Acting Premier and<br />
hjs'colleagues stressed the vital place of shipping in the Tasmanian economy over<br />
of the State's trade being dependent on shipping services and threats to the ma intonance<br />
of these services constituting a problem for the entire Tasmanian community.<br />
The deputation asked that, at an appropriate time, the Commonwealth should<br />
call a conference representative of the unions, the shipowners and the two governments<br />
to see whether some formula could be devised and adopted to give Tasmania some<br />
immunity of this kind. It was accepted, however, that the calling of such a conference<br />
must await the outcome of discussions which had been initiated by the Tasmanian<br />
Traaes Labour Council with the ACTU and the maritime unions in connection with<br />
this Objective. The Commonwealth Government, acknowledging the particular vulnerability<br />
of Tasmania to maritime industrial disputes, indicated that it wished to assist where<br />
it coild in overcoming the problem. Against the background of recent developments,<br />
and taking note of the case presented by the deputation, it would be prepared at the<br />
appropriate time, and subject to the outcome of the initiative now being taken by the<br />
Tasmanian Trades Labour Council, to propose a conference on the lines suggested,<br />
it being understood that the agenda for such a conference and any action foreshadowed<br />
by it must, of course, be a matter for agreement between the parties concerned.<br />
As regards the immediate problem of the present shipping strike involving<br />
the Marine Stewards'and Pantrymen's Association, it was noted that the strike was<br />
already affecting employment and business activity in Tasmania in a substantial way and<br />
that large-scale unemployment and disruption of trade would follow if the dispute were<br />
prolonged. However, it was also noted that this dispute is now at a most sensitive<br />
stage and that there are grounds for hoping that the talks between the unions and shipowners<br />
now taking place in Sydney could lead to a settlement.<br />
