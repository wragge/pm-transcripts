FOR. PRESS 22 SEPTEMBER 1977<br />
THE WOMEN'S ADVISORY BODY WORKING PARTY<br />
The Women's Advisory Body Working Party was set up by the<br />
Government in December 1976, to prepare recommendations on the<br />
establishment of ongoing consultative machinery in Women's<br />
Affairs.<br />
. The Working Party-itself was elected from some twenty four<br />
voluntary women's organisations to examine alternatives<br />
and research the ideas and needs of women throughout Australia<br />
in this regard.<br />
The report is the result of nine months work by four women<br />
Mrs Beryl Beaurepaire, Miss Ruth Ross, Ms Pat Harper and<br />
Mrs Valerie Fisher.<br />
During this period they examined information on advisory machinery<br />
within Australia and overseas, and consulted widely with women<br />
in the Australian community.<br />
Both individuals and organisations were invited to forward<br />
written or recorded submissions and to attend open forum<br />
meetings held in all capital cities and country areas in each<br />
State and the territories.<br />
During three months of consultations, Working Party members<br />
received 500 written and recorded submissions and spoke with<br />
more than 2000 individuals around Australia. </p>
<p>This report should be of considerable interest particularly to<br />
all Australian women. I would hope that it would be widely read<br />
and discussed. No government decision will be made on the<br />
proposal until the public had had an opportunity to study and comment<br />
on the recommendations contained in the Report.<br />
I hope that interested persons and organisations would submit their<br />
comments to Mr Ian Macphee, Minister Assisting in Women's Affairs,<br />
by 8 November 1977.<br />
I would like to thank the members of the Working Party for their<br />
efforts in preparing this report. I know that each of them<br />
worked extremely hard. Their experience and work had been of<br />
great benefit to the Government in its consideration of suitable<br />
ongoing advisory machinery in women's affairs. </p>
