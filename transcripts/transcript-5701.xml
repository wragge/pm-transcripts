ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Earlier this year I made a joint statement with the Victorian<br />
Premier announcing that the Commonwealth would make a gift<br />
of $ 5 million to Victoria to mark the 150th anniversary of<br />
the arrival of the Hentys at Portland, and the settlement<br />
of Melbourne one year later.<br />
Since the time of that announcement, discussions about how<br />
the money should be spent have been held yith the Victorian<br />
Government which in turn received advice from the Citizens'<br />
Council of Victoria's 150th Anniversary Celebrations, under<br />
the chairmanship of Sir John Holland. It has now been<br />
decided that the $ 5 million will be spread between three<br />
projects. These projects cover a wide range of interests,<br />
and each one will be identified as an anniversary project,<br />
funded by the Commonwealth Government as part of its contributicn<br />
to the celebrations by the people of Victoria.<br />
One of the projects is the development of the second stage of<br />
the West Gate Park. This park is part of an overall plan for<br />
the Yarra and Maribyrnong Rivers. It will provide unique<br />
parkland and leisure facilities, especially for the people who<br />
live in the western suburbs of Melbourne, and there will be<br />
special provision for the disabled. Work on stage one is<br />
currently under way, and stage two is especially timely as it<br />
will lend itself to further development for Australia's 1988<br />
bicentennial celebrations.<br />
The second project is the development of a Gallery of Sport<br />
along similar lines to the famous centre in Los Angeles.<br />
This project follows up the outstanding success of the<br />
Cricket Museum at the Melbourne Cricket Club which hasattracted<br />
thousands of people since its establishment in<br />
1969. The Gallery of Sport should attract many more people<br />
and it will be a major tourist attraction. The Gallery of<br />
Sport will be a museum and education centre for all sports,<br />
and it will-incorporate the cricket museum. it Will be<br />
attached to the it will be accessible to the public,<br />
and it will also be clearly identified as a 150th anniversary<br />
project. Since sport is so much a part of the Australian way<br />
of life, this particular project is highly suitable * to these<br />
150th anniversary celebrations. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The third project relates to a proposal by the Royal<br />
Agricultural Society of Victoria to establish an Agricultural<br />
Historical and Educational centre at the showgrounds. Final<br />
plans for this venture, which would display a range of<br />
agricultural activities in a historidal and technological<br />
context, will depend on the results of a detailed feasibility<br />
study. The Commonwealth Government believes that these three projects<br />
which are relevant to the concerns of the city and country<br />
people, ~ and which incorporate a special sporting dimension<br />
as well, gather together some of the major strands of the<br />
history and character of Victoria. I look forward to the<br />
completion of these projects as a forerunner to a successful<br />
celebration of Victoria's 150th anniversary in 1984-85, and<br />
I am delighted to announce these details of the Commonwealth's<br />
involvement. </p>
