Eapproaich, and the value of our policies is becoiiing increasingly<br />

V </p>
<p>N! 6<br />
The task here now is to ensure that those.' seeking jobs are<br />
equipped with knowlecge and skills to take advantage of<br />
the expanding opportunities. In January, Ian Viner and<br />
Wal Fife announced that the Government was examining as a<br />
matter of urgency further ways of increasing the'opporbunities<br />
available for under 18 year olds in education, training and<br />
employment. it is the view of the Government that Australia<br />
should be able to do much better by its young people wanting<br />
work than it is presently doing. More than 200,000 young<br />
people will be assisted by existing employment and training<br />
programmes this financial year. By giving young people a<br />
relevant training, we will give them hope as well as skills.<br />
And granted that employment is increasing at-* the same time,<br />
it is plian that our policy is the most compassionate as-well<br />
as the most effective. No political movement in Australia<br />
has a more constructive and comprehensive approach to the<br />
challenge of creating employment opportunities than the<br />
Liberal Party.<br />
It is now clear that our policies are outweighing the<br />
destructive effects of the Labor shock of 1974/ 75 and the<br />
continuing attack on employment from the militant unions.<br />
It is because we care about individual people that we resist<br />
the efforts of irresponsible union leaders to impose suffering<br />
on innocent people for t'heir own selfish ends. It is<br />
because '* ecare ahnut inividuals that we will be strongly<br />
resist4-; pressures to ___ pos e damaging cost increases-on<br />
indus tr: zthrough the 35 hour campaign and rapidly rising<br />
wages. Nothing . s more destructive of the employment opportunities<br />
of our young people than the job-destroying activities of<br />
the militant unions and of these campaigns.<br />
It needs to be understood that the former president of the<br />
ACTU was the architect of both campaigns. The architect<br />
therefore of campaigns designed to des-troy jobs within<br />
Australia if not by deliberation, that can only be their<br />
effect. As we showed in the Qantas dispute, we will not tolerate<br />
divisive and confrontational tactics of this kind. You know<br />
it is not the Government that has ever confronted the Australian<br />
community or trade unions in this matter. It i~ s trade unionsthat<br />
have confronted time and time again the well-being of the<br />
Australian community, the interests of ordinary Australians<br />
as they go about their lives and whether it is a pow.. er<br />
strike, or the Builders Labourers' or the Transport Workers'<br />
Union, whether it is shutting dow'n Qantas. In these things<br />
it is trade unions who confront the better interest of<br />
ordinary Australians in every corner of this land.<br />
As the elected representatives of the whole people we in<br />
the Government stand for the public interest and its defence<br />
is our constant obligation and objective. This is a time<br />
when we all need to think very seriously about our obliga-tions<br />
as Australians. If there is a recognition of what we owe to<br />
our fellow citizens the future of this country is limitless.,<br />
/ 7 </p>
<p>1i It is the unrestrained pursuit of self-i-nterest that we see<br />
so clearly in-some of the abhorrent tax-avoidance schemes<br />
which have become public, as well as ' in the cynical pursuit<br />
of power by extremist union leaders, that clouds ouir future.<br />
We are prepared to take the full force of the law to combat<br />
the abdication of community responsibility evident in such<br />
behaviour., But we all know that the real solution lies -in<br />
a strengthened recognition throughout the community of what is<br />
responsible and moral behaviour in dealings with one's<br />
fellow citizens.<br />
In private and in public vie must place greater emphasis than<br />
ever before on the moral standards of respect for othersthat<br />
lie at the heart of Liberalism and, I believe, at the<br />
heart of the values of the great majority of the Australian<br />
people. The Liberal Party is prepared to stand up for these<br />
values. In the first five years of this current Liberal government the!<br />
foundations for a new sense of confidnece in Australia's<br />
future has been laid. This confidence has come about, I<br />
believe, because it is understood that we govern in accordance!<br />
with a philosophy which places individuals first a philosophy<br />
which look-, s to the devel'opment of a spirit of community and<br />
co-opera: _ n<br />
It is ' 2LSseonfs ekn owi.,-: ng what the Liberal Party stands for<br />
that gi-; E. c security to people. Security and predictability<br />
provides z'_ e capacity to plan for th': future. Out of it<br />
grows tekind of mounting prosperity and ' awakening hope that<br />
we see around us today.<br />
Security. and stability are of course also the conditions<br />
under which we, as Liberals, work for responsible and<br />
r-easonable reform. The reform of the role of government i~ n a<br />
Liberal direction after the Whitlam years has been our great<br />
continuing task, and will continue to be so.<br />
Accompanying this have been valuable legal reforms the<br />
Ombudsman, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Family<br />
Law Court, the new Federal Court, and passage of the Administrative<br />
Decisions ( judicial Review) Act.<br />
Many of you will be glad to know that the Human Rights Commission<br />
Bill is throught the Senate. I very much hope that it will<br />
shortly be passed, without impairment, in the House of<br />
Representatives as well.<br />
V ictorian Liberals have made an important contribution to<br />
these reforms and I know they will continue to play an<br />
important role in reform to expand individual rights and<br />
freedom. / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
The Liberal Pary since 1975 has established a proud record<br />
in Federal Government. It has given-. a decisive voice in Australia's<br />
affairs to those who believe in the vision of a-nation strong<br />
because its people can develop thqir abilities, build their<br />
own lives, defend their freedom and. recognise their obligations'.<br />
In the next three years we will carry this banner with<br />
greater determination than ever. The Liberal Party must<br />
continue to be the main force in Australia for responsible<br />
Liberal policies. In that it will need the support of all<br />
its -members.<br />
The record of the Liberal Party is matched only by our<br />
determination to make an even better future for this country.<br />
Party members are entitled to be proud, strong ambassadors<br />
for the Liberal cause. I ask for your continued advocacy<br />
to make sure that the people of this country understand tiat<br />
Australian Liberalism offers a way of life without equal<br />
in the world.<br />
That is the challenge that lies before us all a challenge<br />
which we must meet in the interests of every Australian,<br />
and every Australian family. o0--</p>
