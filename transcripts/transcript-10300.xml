8 April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
E O E<br />
Well ladies and gentlemen earlier this evening I've become aware of some material<br />
which leads me to the strong conclusion that Senator Colston should stand down as<br />
Deputy President of the Senate and that all of the matters in dispute relating to his<br />
travel allowances etcetera, should be immediately by the appropriate minister or<br />
President of the Senate or Clerk of the Senate or whatever the case may be, be referred<br />
to the Federal Police for investigation.<br />
I learned at about 7.1 5pm tonight that the employee of Senator Colston who had<br />
previously made a statutory declaration explaining circumstances relating to his travel<br />
allowance claims in the Senate context had in fact sent a letter to the or had in fact<br />
made a statement attached to a letter sent by her solicitors to the President of the<br />
Senate. I finally obtained a copy of the document after telephoning Senator Reid in<br />
Florida and awakening her from her sleep at about 4.30 in the morning. I finally<br />
obtained a copy of that document about an hour and ten minutes later.<br />
I am satisfied having read that document that its character, on my assessment, totally<br />
alters the basis on which this matter had been seen previously and that is why I have<br />
reached the conclusions that I have. I have spoken to Senator Reid, I have indicated to<br />
her that I believe that in the circumstances Senator Colston should stand down as<br />
Deputy President and I have spoken to David Jul] the Administrative Services Minister<br />
because of his responsibilities in the matter, and I don't know that there is a great deal<br />
more that I can say. The material which I have seen fuandamentally changes the public<br />
record in relation to this matter and entering as I must what can only be described as<br />
the Willis caveat the material appears valid and it appears to be a genuine letter. It<br />
was not addressed to me, it was addressed to the President of the Senate but I feel it<br />
necessary in the interests not of levity but in the interests of proper protection one<br />
never knows in these things but it certainly seems to be a genuine letter and a genuine </p>
<p>statement. I am aware of the firm, it has its head office in Sydney and has a significant<br />
branch office in Queensland and some of the names on the partners' letterhead seems<br />
familiar to me, so it seems to be a genuine letter, but that's the totality of it. Ladies<br />
and gentlemen, any questions?<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you spoken to Senator Colston?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. JOURNALIST: Does the statement substantially recant what she said before or is it a clarification of<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't think, given some of the legal niceties, I don't think I should say more than<br />
what I've said. Suffice it to say that what was in the statement to my mind, so<br />
fundamentally altered the previous public record that I have reached the view that I<br />
annunciated at the beginning of this news conference. Mr Lyneham?<br />
JOURNALIST: What of Tim Fischer's comments.., about the separation of powers. Now we have a<br />
Prime Minister coming in and saying you believe he should stand down as Deputy<br />
President. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I can always have that view. I mean, I've frequently told people to stand down in<br />
my political career.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible....<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I don't think it will come to a vote, but the answer is yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you spoken to Senator Colston?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Have you conveyed your attitude<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
To him? No, I haven't spoken to him. Well, I guess in a sense I'm conveying it now.<br />
JOURNALIST: How soon will he stand down?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I would just expect in the circumstances that he would stand down immediately.<br />
JOURNALIST: Inaudible... PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, that is a matter which has to be adjudicated according to the processes of the<br />
law. He's not been found guilty of any offence. I think given the background of all of<br />
this and in all of the circumstances, it is not appropriate for him to continue as Deputy<br />
President and that is a view that I have conveyed to Senator Reid, it is a view that I<br />
have conveyed to the acting leader of the Government in the Senate, and I don't<br />
believe that he will. But let me be quite precise. If it did come to a vote then I would<br />
expect all members of the Government to vote in accordance with what I've just said,<br />
and I'm sure they will.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has Mrs Smith now laid the blame at Senator Colston's feet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It is not appropriate for me to answer that question for reasons I'm sure you will<br />
understand, Mr Horan.<br />
JOURNALIST: have your recent inaudible..<br />
PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well I'm in the process, I guess, now of doing it. I mean, I only heard about this<br />
statement at what did I say, 10 or a quarter past seven tonight and I've sort of been<br />
working on it since. I've been trying I've had to speak to Margaret Reid and one<br />
or two others, I had to seek some legal advice and sound advice.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no it didn't. No, what has changed my view is the material, the new material from<br />
Mrs Smith. I mean that has been as recently as 7.09pm tonight. We had the situation<br />
that I previously asserted. Can I just make the point that I have said all along in this<br />
that due process would be observed, and due process has been observed in relation to<br />
Senator Woods, former Senator Woods and Mr Cobb and I've said all along that we<br />
would not be doing any favours by anybody and nor would we be excessively<br />
accelerating an unreasonable witchhunt. But the material that I have seen earlier this<br />
evening does on my assessment and like any other individual I am entitled to have an<br />
assessment of the merits of something, has altered the situation. I might say that we<br />
have allowed to happen in relation to Michael Cobb and former Senator Woods,<br />
something that Mr Beazley and Senator Evans did not allow to happen in 1983 and I<br />
might say in that context that I'll be writing to Mr Beazley tomorrow requesting that<br />
he waive any entitlement of the former government to non-disclosure by the relevant<br />
departments to us of the advice that was tendered to Senator Evans and Mr Beazley in<br />
1983.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you believe that this is going to change the balance of power in the Senate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look it is not appropriate for me to comment on that because that anticipates action<br />
by or consequences for people which may in turn involve some judgment by me of the<br />
legal merits of the situation and it is not appropriate that I therefore answer it.<br />
JOURNALIST: But given the replacement. inaudible...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
A change in the identity of the deputy president would not per se alter the balance of<br />
power in the Senate. The only way in which the balance of power in the Senate can be<br />
altered is by a resignation or a declaration of ineligibility.<br />
JOURNALIST: </p>
<p>Prime Minister ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Laurie, I thought you would ask that or that somebody would. I don't think, given<br />
that it has been addressed to the Senate President and the Clerk of the Senate that I<br />
should, it is not my mind to make public but if you want a copy of it, then for all I<br />
know some of you may already have copies of it, but if you want an official copy of it<br />
then you should approach the office of the President.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
In the long run, no. You only are hurt if you are seen to have behaved in a manner that<br />
involves some kind of cover up and we certainly have not done that. We have been<br />
quite open. You are only hurt if people regard it as systemic conduct and I certainly<br />
don't think that is the situation. Let me remind you that all three men who have been<br />
named tonight are entitled to a presumption of innocence and I don't know what the<br />
final outcome is going be in relation to any of them. I can say very confidently to all of<br />
you that due process has been observed. Obviously I would have preferred that these<br />
events had not occurred, but if the public judges that due process has been observed<br />
and I know on occasions due process seems slow process and it is. The Federal Police<br />
took nine months to complete the investigation into former Senator Woods and Mr<br />
Cobb and I do not criticise them for that although I note that a period of a month, or<br />
six weeks, was regarded as a union spokesman for the Federal Police this morning as<br />
being unreasonably long yet their own colleagues had taken nine and I think that that<br />
was a bit rich and not very helpful to due process I might add either.<br />
Anyway that is a bit irrelevant now because I think this is a bigger story.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard do you now regret ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
None of this was known to me at the time. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
If I had known about it yes, but I didn't.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I do not think that I was ever asked the question. I mean all I said was that he<br />
should not be denied due process and I stand by that and it remains the situation. I<br />
have not made a judgement about his ultimate situation. That is a matter for further<br />
processes of the law and I am not going to do that. I believe that the material that I<br />
have seen tonight, and I have no reason to doubt it's authenticity, no reason at all, but<br />
I had to in view of past experiences in these matters enter that caveat but I have no<br />
reason to doubt it's authenticity, but having seen it I think it does alter the situation<br />
and that is why I have reached a different view and I think it is the trigger for the<br />
change. It does alter it and that is why I have reached a different view.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, I don't believe so, but you ought to ask Senator Colston I suppose. Well, the<br />
letter that I saw was addressed to the Senate President and I do not believe that it was<br />
delivered to him although he may have been made aware of its content.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I am not going to answer for the processes of the office of the Senate President.<br />
I mean they value their independence in these matters and all I want to say to you is<br />
that as soon as I found about it, learnt of its existence I sought to obtain a copy. I<br />
finally did get a copy and having read it I decided to call this news conference. I am<br />
doing and I am stating my position. I mean don't, this business about whether it was<br />
addressed to Evans or Reid or Colston is a little bit academic. My understanding, or<br />
what I saw, the letter I was given was a letter from the solicitors containing the<br />
statement by Mrs Smith addressed to the President of the Senate and I therefore </p>
<p>imagine that it did not go to Senator Colston but I can't certify to that because I didn't<br />
write the letter and I haven't spoken to Senator Colston.<br />
JOURNALIST: How long has it been since the letter was written?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't know how long since the letter was, well, it was dated today but whether it was<br />
written this morning and whether Harry Evans and Margaret Reid have had it for a<br />
long time, I don't think Margaret Reid was aware of it when I spoke to her at half past<br />
seven this evening.<br />
JOURNALIST: How did you find out about it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well from a normally reliable source.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, do you still believe that Labor is engaged in an unreasonable witchhunt, in<br />
your words?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I have no reason to recant or retract my criticism of the zeal with which the Labor<br />
Party has pursued this matter. I mean, let's face it, the most disingenuous statement<br />
that I've heard in this whole saga was that of the Acting Opposition Leader at the<br />
weekend when he told Mr Oakes that somebody who had eight years service was a<br />
fresh faced, newly arrived, green rookie, Senator. I didn't feel like that after I had<br />
been here eight years.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you now regret the zeal with which Senior Government Members and Senators<br />
defended Senator Colston?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, they defended due process. I mean, it's often very hard in a situation like this<br />
when a lot of people are howling in one direction to stand up for the process but the<br />
long experience of the Anglo Australian legal system has been that on occasions you<br />
have to, in the interests of preserving the system, defend situations that aren't always<br />
popular and give the right of hearing and the right of audience to people who may be<br />
subject to virulent criticism. If you allowed the noise to drown the due process in </p>
<p>many cases people would be denied justice and the strength of our system is that you<br />
don't allow that to occur. Now I don't know what will happen with this matter but I<br />
am satisfied on the basis of what I saw tonight, I am satisfied that the right thing to do<br />
is to have the police immediately look at all the relevant material. I also believe it is<br />
appropriate in all of the circumstances that Senator Colston stand down as Deputy<br />
President. Now I don't make any other judgement. He remains a duly elected Senator<br />
for the state of Queensland. I make no other judgement and he remains entitled to sit<br />
in the Senate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, is it fair enough to say in the light of what you have told us about this<br />
document that the Senate was misled?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think that is a difficult question for me to answer, not in the sense that I don't<br />
have a view but in the sense that it would not be appropriate for me to answer it. I<br />
think the appropriate thing for me to say is to, in answer Laurie, is to simply say that<br />
having read it I believe that the two courses of action I outlined are entirely<br />
appropriate. JOURNALIST: Did Senator Reid indicate she would return?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes I suggested she come home.<br />
