<p>Thank you very much John Gough, Jeff Kennett, Dr Timothy Potts, to the other members of the Board of the Gallery, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I can't help thinking that if every speech I made was in such elegant, attractive and cultural surroundings as this, the whole tone and shape of Australian politics would be changed forever.</p>
<p>It is a tremendous delight to be present in this world-renowned gallery, because that is what it is. The collections of the National Gallery of Victoria are not only Australian renowned but they are together a world-renowned collection.</p>
<p>But the purpose of my being here today is to announce that the Commonwealth Government will contribute $25 million from the Federation Fund, which was announced at the time of the last budget, towards the redevelopment of the National Gallery of Victoria. And that contribution, along with the contribution of $94 million from the Victorian Government and what I know will be some generous contributions from the Victorian and broader Australian business community, will ensure that the redevelopment of the National Gallery of Victoria, along with the development of the Federation Square, will not only be a Victorian highlight of the Centenary celebrations but it will be an Australian highlight.</p>
<p>The Federation Fund comprises $1 billion and from it I have already announced contributions of $100 million towards the Darwin to Alice Springs railway and $133 million for the construction of the National Museum of Australia in Canberra. I want to emphasise, of course, that the $25 million that I announce as a contribution today towards the National Gallery of Victoria is not the end of contributions out of the Federation Fund towards activities in the State of Victoria.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Federation Fund is to support developments and projects which properly mark the Federation of Australia, which properly mark our birth almost 100 years ago as a nation. And they are designed to be contributions towards projects of lasting significance, those that identify very much with the past as well has have a resonance with our future.</p>
<p>And this gallery, which certainly houses the best collection in Australia without argument, this gallery is one of the cultural icons of Australia. It deserves the support that it is receiving from both the Victorian and also the Federal Government.</p>
<p>It is important when we celebrate the Centenary of Federation to reflect upon all successful aspects of the Australian story over what will then be a 100-year period. And the development of the cultural base of this country, the way in which the arts and cultural pursuits in Australia have burgeoned in popularity and broader public acceptance, the fact that more Australians in a 12-month period will visit museums than even have used sporting fixtures is a reminder of just how tremendously important the galleries, and particularly this National Gallery of Victoria is.</p>
<p>I want to congratulate the Premier, who is also Minister for the Arts, for the way in which he has patronised, supported and promoted the arts, not only here in Melbourne, but all around Australia.</p>
<p>Support for the arts is very much a mainstream issue in Australia. Support for the arts is part of the rounded approach of any government towards developing a community which not only values economic issues but also values human and cultural issues.</p>
<p>And for those reasons, I am very pleased indeed to announce this contribution from the Federal Government. I am delighted, of course, to remind you that the Italian architect, Mario Bellini, and the Melbourne-based firm, Media Three, are working with the Gallery to develop a world-class facility in which to display and store the collection which has been made possible by the great Felton Bequest.</p>
<p>So ladies and gentlemen, I wish the gallery well. I congratulate its Chairman, John Gough, and its Director, Tim Potts, on the splendid work that they have done. I congratulate the Victorian Government on its magnificent contribution and Jeff Kennett's personal commitment to the development of culture and the arts in this city and throughout Australia. And this will be a very important partnership between the Federal Government, the Victorian Government, the business community of Melbourne and those who care about the arts and the cultural activities and the cultural life of our nation. Thank you.</p>
