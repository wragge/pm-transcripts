TRANSCRIPT TALKBACK RADIO, 8DN ( COMMCIAL) DARWINg31 MARCH 1.989<br />
2 &amp; O0E-PROOF ONLY<br />
Col Xrohns Quite a few things in the news this morning in<br />
relation to the PM'. visit to the Top End, We see where in<br />
particular the algae road, something which has been an urgency,<br />
is to go ahead. More than $ 7m in roadworks to help tourism in<br />
Central Australia. This was announced yesterday and of course a<br />
treaty that's going to be headed up this is the proposal by the<br />
Prime Minister, an eminent persons group to help draw up a<br />
pyeraopr osseod iAtb'osr iagliln ahla pTpreenaitnyg iinn ttihmee Tfoopr Eintd taot bet hissi gnteimde . l, a tesro tIh'ilsl<br />
just check to see if indeed we do have the P M on the line.. Mr<br />
Hawke good morning.<br />
PM: Good morning Coll can you speak up I can hardly hear you<br />
KROHNt OK how's that.<br />
PM It's a little bit better.<br />
KROHN: Thanks very much f or joining us. I know you'Ive got a big<br />
programme this morning so just brief ly bef ore we take our f irst<br />
call you have made quite an impact of course with your visit to<br />
the Northern Territory, particularly in relation to the money<br />
that's going to be spent on the upgrading of the road to the<br />
Olga. and of course one that's been in need f or a long time and<br />
the Treaty. You want to set up an eminent persons group to help<br />
draw up the proposed Aboriginal Treaty in time for Lt. to be<br />
eirned later this year. Do you believe that this is the way to<br />
go. PM: on the question of the Treaty I'm not saying it will be<br />
completed by the end of this year, what I've said is that I think<br />
we are going to see the processes under way this year of fuller<br />
consultation going on within the Aboriginal community itself.<br />
They want to talk themselves about the sort of things they want<br />
to see and I think we'll see during this year, and beyond, the<br />
processes of discussion, consultation, explanation within the<br />
non-aboriginal community where I see a role for people of stature<br />
who, right across the Australian society, will be seen as people<br />
who understand these issues and have only-a concern for the<br />
welfare of Australia talking about it and those procesues I see<br />
as going on in a way which one it would be nice to believe that<br />
that could come to fruition within the life of this parliament<br />
but I said this probably will go into the lifea of the next, the<br />
important thing is that these processes, you know, be under way. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
KROHN: Mr Prime Minister we won't take too much of your time.<br />
We'll take our first call right away and the caller waiting for<br />
you goes by the name of Scotty. Scotty you're through to the<br />
Prime minister, go ahead.<br />
SCOTTY: Good morning Mr Hawke.<br />
PXs Good Morning.<br />
SCOTTYs How are you air<br />
PM: I'm very well thank you very much.<br />
SCO'DTYt Now Sir, can I ask you a question ( Yep) in the last<br />
fortnight, in the paper was a statement Pensioners rates are to<br />
go up by $ 50 ( yes) Now is that a fact or is that just a<br />
publicity stunt by the Northern Territory news<br />
PM. Well I don't know who said Pensioners Rates will go up by<br />
but there's no authority for that statement. What is the case is<br />
what's your name by the way? ( Scotty) Scotty ( yes) Scotty<br />
what the fact is is that there's going to be improvements in the<br />
arrangements for elderly citiziens and thats.. .1st me Just very<br />
quickly tell you what I've been doing about that. We commissioned<br />
a report which we received at the end of last year and on<br />
that.. that was from Professor Cass.. which was looking at the<br />
whole question of retirement incomes policy. We received that<br />
report and what I've had done nov is having a range of<br />
consultations on the basis of that report with organisations<br />
representing the elderly citizens and with the Superannuation<br />
industry and also I had a back-bench committee of mine going<br />
around Australia just listening to the elderly and we're<br />
receiving those reports now and as a result of that the Minister,<br />
Mr Howe, will be coming to us with a range of proposals for<br />
improvements in the area of retirement income policy so people<br />
are entitled to understand yes that there will be improvements in<br />
the arrangements for our elderly citizen. but we can't at this<br />
stage Scotty put a figure on it. B ut what I can say is that that<br />
will be based upon a record to this point where when we cam to<br />
of fice the pension, as a percentage Iof average weekly earnings<br />
was just 22 and a half percent, we've brought that up to<br />
percent. In our period of office there's been a real increase in<br />
pensions of 8% as against a 4% reduction when Howard was<br />
Treasurer-so we've got the runs on the board. But we're not<br />
satisfied we are going to do more and that will happen this year.<br />
SCOTTY: Thank you very much indeed<br />
PM: Thank you Scotty.<br />
XROHNa Thanks for your call Scotty. We'll take our next call,<br />
Kevin you're through to the Prime Minister, go ahead Kevin. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
KEVIN: Hello ( yes) Mr Prime MInister could I ( Your name is<br />
Kevin is it?) That's correct. ( Yes Kevin) It can be-. seen that<br />
the Federal Government is spending millions of dollars on the<br />
Aboriginal Deaths in Custody inquiry ( yes) as I see it it seems<br />
to be unfair when reports say that the deaths in custody<br />
concern., or more deaths in custody concern non-aboriginal<br />
inmates. That being the case is your Government prepared to set<br />
up a Royal Commission to look into the issue of white deaths in<br />
custody. If not, why not?<br />
PMt With respect that's not really the right way if you look at<br />
it as a proportion, you know, of the population it is a much<br />
higher incidence amongst aborigines. But I'd just make this pint<br />
that it may very well be the case and we haven't received the<br />
final report as you'd appreciate, it may very well be the case<br />
that as a result of the work of the Royal Commission which I<br />
might remind you is not simply being done by the Commonwealth but<br />
with the co-operation of each of * the states, in other words the<br />
commitment and the involvement in this investigation into deaths<br />
in custody is not simply a commonwealth Labor Government<br />
initiative. I pay full tribute to all my colleagues around the<br />
States, non Labor as well as Labor persuasion are involved in it<br />
but what I'm saying is this, that it may well be as a result of<br />
the Investigations that facts and recopmmendations will come out<br />
of that which will be relevant not simply to the question of<br />
deaths of Aboriginals in custody but may go, may have<br />
implications for the whole prison population or potential prisc_<br />
population and for procedures to be adopted by police and by<br />
prisons which will have benefit for the whole population.<br />
KEVIN: this would mean then that the terms of reference would<br />
have to be changed?<br />
PMs No it doesn't mean anything of the sort because it mean.<br />
obviously that if Royal Commissioners are examining procedures<br />
that are follo * wed by police and by prison of ficials that that<br />
examination of procedures may very well, and is very likely<br />
indeed, to have relevance for prisoners other than Aboriginal<br />
prisoners. KEVINs Right. In fact your answer to my question at this stage isthat<br />
you're waiting on the report fro...<br />
PM: Well we've received interim reports from the Royal<br />
Commissioner, Commissioner Muirhead, and as a result of those<br />
interim reports there've already been meetings of the<br />
Commonwealth and State, Ministers and Officials and there are the<br />
beginning of changes in procedures. I'm simply saying that the<br />
final series of actions that will be taken,-undertaken and that<br />
is essentially by the states because it is in their areas of<br />
administration where these things basically happen, that we won't<br />
get final answers and won't be able to make the final judgment on<br />
outcomes until we get those final reports. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
KROHN: Thanks Kevin, thanks for your call. Mr Prime Minister<br />
we'll move on right away we do have a full board. Gary, you're<br />
through to the Prime Minister.<br />
GARY: Ah. hello Mr Prime Minister ( yes Gary) I just want to ask<br />
you a couple of questions. Can you please tell me who's going to<br />
be looking after airport security when the FAC take over.<br />
PM Well the whole question of airport security is a matter which<br />
has got to be considered by the Federal Cabinet Gary. Currently<br />
the major.. well there's a shared responsibility, the major<br />
responsibility is undertaken by Federal Police but with<br />
involvement by state forces. As a matter of fact the Federal<br />
Cabinet is going to be examining this issue to see how we can<br />
increase the effectiveness of airport security and it may be that<br />
there will be so me greater handing over of this responsibility to<br />
the states .0 have to accept some financial<br />
responsibility and involvement but that's a matter which is<br />
currently being considered.<br />
GARY a I heard that there' s gunna be retrenchments of the APP<br />
throughout Australia-.<br />
PM: No it wouldn't be a question of retrenchment, I mean there's<br />
no intention to reduce Federal Police numbers. If in fact we<br />
come to an arrangement with the states in terms of handing over<br />
more responsibility to them it's not going to involve a loss of<br />
jobs for APP.<br />
KROHNs Just on that if I may submit a point. I understand that<br />
the cutbacks according to the... some of the figures, could lead<br />
to industrial action in relation to this.<br />
ix: With the APP No there the APP have some concerns at<br />
the moment but this has got nothing to do with any suggested<br />
cutbacks in regard to airport security. There are some concerns<br />
in the APP and in fact the Minister, Senator Tate, who has a<br />
direct responsibility in this area will be coming to me next wveek<br />
with suggestions and recommendations dealing with some of the<br />
concerns of the APP but that is a matter which is separate fromand<br />
will be dealt separately and will be dealt with<br />
separately from any questions of airport security.<br />
GARY: OK thank you Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much.<br />
KROHN: OX thanks for your call Gary. Apparently there is a<br />
meeting right around the nation this morning by Federal Police on<br />
this one according to Mr Small who is the Federal Police<br />
Association National Assistant Secretary, Mr Hawks, he says that<br />
there'd be $ 2.2 million over budget by the end of the financial<br />
year if costs weren't restrained. </p>
<p>P~ s Yeah well, an I say Col. there are some concerns they have in<br />
Canberra. we've had some particular problems which have revolved<br />
around the diversion of resources that have been necessary in<br />
investigating the Winchester murder and so these whole range of<br />
concerns will be before me as a result of submissions to me-by<br />
the Minister in this coming week.<br />
KROHNs OR we'll move along Mr Prime Minister. Isobel is your next<br />
caller, you're through to the PM Isobel.<br />
ISOBEL: Hello ( Hello Isobel-H~ ow are you?) I'm fine. ( How old are<br />
you?) I'm twelve ( Twelve are you?) Turning twelve soon ( Good on<br />
you) I'm doing a project on Indonesia ( yes) and could you tell me<br />
if Australia's helping Indonesia in any ways? ( if we're helping<br />
Indonesia yes.<br />
PH: Well I think the right way of putting it is we're helping<br />
Indonesians. We have some aid programmes with Indonesia, not in<br />
the defence area so much as in other areas which will be of<br />
assistance in helping the development of the Indonesian economy.<br />
we're trying to build up relations with Indonesia. They've gone<br />
through, I suppose it's fair to say, over recent year. we've had<br />
rocky periods in our relations but this is a country of as you<br />
know, very very many people and it's the most populous neighbour<br />
that we have, imediate neighbour, so it's very important Isobel<br />
that we have good and friendly relations with the people of<br />
Indonesia. We've had differences with them, particularly an you<br />
know going back, as you would have been taught, going back to the<br />
last decade over the action they took in regard to the<br />
incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia and there were some<br />
serious difficulties we had at that time. We still are watching<br />
with interest, and they appreciate that, the question of the<br />
treatment of people in East Timor. But we now have a relationship<br />
with the Government which enables urn to talk freely about these<br />
things but to do so on a basis of trying to get growing cooperation<br />
with them so that we can help the people of Indonesia<br />
build up their economy so that they can be better of f and that we<br />
also will be able to have better trading relationships with them<br />
as well as relationships in other fields. We've just recently<br />
established, Isobel, an Australian-Indo nes ian Foundation which<br />
will have people who will advise us on how we can develop<br />
relations with them in a whole range of field., cultural and<br />
sporting fields for instance, so that we can have, you know, a<br />
better, more productive relationship.<br />
KROHN: Ok Isobel? Thank you very much ( P? 1: thank you Isobel) OR<br />
moving along with another lady, Kathy, you're through to the<br />
Prime Minister Kathy, go ahead.<br />
KATHY: Uh Hi, I'm 17 years old right<br />
PM: I'm sorry I didn't catch your name ( My name's Kathy) Kathy?<br />
( yeah) Could you speak up Kathy? </p>
<p>-6-<br />
KATHYt OK I'm Just about 17 years old ( yeah) and I left school<br />
about when I was 15 ( When you were when I was 15 ( Yeah)<br />
and I'm looking for a job right 7 and everyone advertises for-16<br />
to 18 year olds with a year's experience and that's really hard<br />
to get, you know, when you're 17 and you've just left school<br />
( yeah) and you know that's really stupid ( beg your pardon<br />
that's really stupid and I was wondering why people do that, same<br />
with Social security and things like that, you know.<br />
PM Why are they saying.. I'm sorry why are they saying you need<br />
experience? KATHY: Yeah you find advertisements in the paper -for 16 to 18<br />
year olds and you've got to have six months to a year's<br />
experience ( yeap well) now how is a 16 to 18 year old supposed to<br />
get a year's experience if he's just left school.<br />
PX<: yeah="" well="" let="" me="" eay="" two="" or="" three="" things="" about="" that...="" i=""></:>
think it's fairly clear that if you were an employer your<br />
preference, if you had all other things being equal, you'd prefer<br />
to have someone who did have some experience. I think that's<br />
understandable so the second thing I'd say is that what we've<br />
been doing over some period of time now in Government is to<br />
establish a range of programmes which are calcualted to give<br />
people like yourself experience either directly under subsidised<br />
schemes or in other ways of the work environment so that you<br />
won't just be going as it were, cold to employers. Now what I<br />
suggest, without going through the range of schemes, we can talk<br />
about JOBSTART and the Australian traineeship System for<br />
example, but what I suggest you do is that you talk closely with<br />
the people in the CE5 so that they can tell you the range of<br />
programmes that are available and you'll find that there is a<br />
number of these programmes available, calculated to try to give<br />
you experience in one way or another so that you will meet this<br />
reasonably understandable approach that employers have. The other<br />
thing that I want to say generally is that what we've tried to do<br />
since we've been in government the last six years is to get<br />
young people to stay in the education sytem longer because it-is<br />
the case that the more education and training that you have the<br />
better equipped you're going to be to get into the workforce and<br />
I Just... I don't want to throw a whole lot of statistics at you<br />
Kathy ( yep) but I just give you an example.<br />
KATHYs But I was just thinking you know ( I can't hear you love) I<br />
left right, I left school at year 10 and I want to do a course at<br />
like College or that, but you've gotta pay a certain amount of<br />
money and I live on $ 32 a week ( yeah-well) anR that's really hard<br />
you know because I gotta pay things like board and buy my own<br />
food or like...( yeah well if you go so how you supposed to<br />
do a course or something to further your education and live on<br />
say </p>
<p>-7-<br />
PM: I tell you if you go to the Department of Social Security and<br />
the CES combined you will find the range of allowances that are<br />
available to you to help you to do that. I mean just for example<br />
when we came in the allowance for Secondary students from, you<br />
know, poor incomes wasn only $ 23 a week. We've lifted that to over.<br />
a week. There are substantial financial assistance programmes<br />
available to help people stay in the education system and I<br />
suggest to you that you go and talk with the Department of Social<br />
Security representatives as well as talking to the CBS so that<br />
you know exactly the range of programmues that are available to<br />
them, they've been very, very greatly expanded to meet<br />
circumstances like the ones you're talking about Kathy.<br />
KROHNo Kathy I'm afraid we're going to have to leave it there<br />
we're running out of time. we do have a lot of callers. Thanks<br />
very much and our next caller, Greg. You're through to the Prime<br />
minister Greg. Go ahead Greg.<br />
GREG&amp; Morning Bob ( what's the name, Greg is it Yes Greg.<br />
There's just a couple of little queries that I'd like to sort of<br />
query with you.( Sure) One of them is the amount the Chief<br />
Minister gets paid up here ( yep) for a start, now whether it's<br />
exactly true I'm told that he gets paid more than you. Now<br />
wouldn't it be better him getting paid a little less and spending<br />
the money in other places instead of spending it on a Chief<br />
Minister, you know?<br />
PM: Greg, I don't know what the Chief Minister gets paid. I<br />
remember seeing some reference somewhere that seemed to suggest<br />
he gets paid more than me, I don't know whether he does but what<br />
we've done is to exercise a fair bit of restraint in regard to<br />
salaries of Federal Members ( right) and Ministers because we took<br />
the view that it was pretty hard to be asking ordinary workers to<br />
exercise the pay restraint that they had and be giving ourselves<br />
big increases so we have lagged behind a bit. But that doesn't<br />
worry me, I think that that'. something we ought to do if we are<br />
going to ask the community generally to exercise restraint..<br />
GREG a The other small query is this Parliament building that<br />
they're building up here now, well I was born and bred up here<br />
and grown up here and I think that the money could have been<br />
better well spent in other areas of the community instead of<br />
spending x amount of dollars building a nice big flash parliament<br />
building for them to be in and while you've got poor-people<br />
living on the poverty you know.<br />
PM: Yeah well you know, that's a matter in the end that the<br />
people of the Northern Territory are going to have to make a<br />
decision about and I don't pretend, Greg,-to know the details<br />
of what they're spending on it or just how magnificent it is but<br />
let me honestly talk about the building of Parliament houses<br />
because it has been a bipartisan thing in the Australian,,<br />
the Federal Parliament. </p>
<p>It started under my predecessor, Malcolm Fraser and we've<br />
carried on. We've spent a lot of money in building a new Federal<br />
Parliament House and I've got to say that meeting people from all<br />
around Australia, that have come there and who are talking. about<br />
it that they are in favour of the building of this new Par1iuament<br />
House in Canberra. They see it as a national building of which<br />
they are propud and I suppose it could have been argued in regard<br />
to the Federal Parliament that we could have spent loe, instead<br />
of on other things but r think you've got to remember, I guess to<br />
some extent this is true about up here although I don't know how<br />
grand it is, it's true that the money that's been spent on the<br />
Federal House is something that's got to be looked at in terms of<br />
lasting over hundreds of years. This new Parliament House is<br />
going to last generation after generation after generation of<br />
Australians and I think it has to be looked at in that way. Now<br />
having said that I can't speak with authority Greg on what's<br />
being done up here, I just don't know the details of it.<br />
RROHNo Thank you Greg we'll have to leave it there we're running<br />
desperately short of time. ' Tom you're through to the Prime<br />
Minister, away you go Tom.<br />
PM: Yes Tom.<br />
TOMs Yes, ah, good morning I'd like to talk to you Bob ( KROHNt<br />
Have you got a radio on TOM yes we have. ( You must turn it<br />
off) I'd like to just talk to you breifly about the BTHC<br />
Programme and how it's affecting the Buffalo Industry up here.<br />
I'm sure you're familiar with the BTEC Programme but for the<br />
listeners I'd like to briefly recap.<br />
KROHNs Well we can't do that I'm afraid. I think most of us are<br />
aware of the BTEC Programme. Could you put your point to the<br />
Prime minister Tom, we haven't got time.<br />
TOM: Ok then Bob, the Buffalo industry ( Yes I know the industry<br />
OK has had a significant input into the Territory and the<br />
Australian economy ( yep) in quite a few million dollars worth of<br />
export earnings over a number of years ( yep). The Buffalo<br />
Industry has been caught up in this cattle campaign to eradicate<br />
the diseases. -The important points now are breifly that the<br />
buffalo industry is all but decimated at the present time and is<br />
likely to be decimated by 1992. The buffalo are severely<br />
disadvantaged by the programme inasmuch as the buffalo have<br />
nothing to gain from the programme, the programme was designed to<br />
protect the Aust. cattle industry and inasmuch as we are likely<br />
to be decimated by the programme I would like, if we could, and I<br />
realise this is highly irregular, to ask if we could have a<br />
meeting, the Buffalo industry, could hiave a meeting with<br />
yourself and/ or John Kerin prior to a very important National<br />
BTEC Committee meeting coming up on the twelfth and thirteenth of<br />
April? </p>
<p>PM: Wel. l 1 wouldnt.. what I can do Tom is to, when I return to<br />
Canberra, indicate that you' ve spoken to me and see if there's<br />
any opportunity of your people.., that's the Northern Territory<br />
Buffalo industry Council isn't it ( That's right) I'm aware of<br />
your business and your concerns. I'll mention to John Kerin-that<br />
you've spoken to me and see if there's any chance of you talking<br />
with him before then...* we are contributing very large amounts to<br />
the programme. We're contributing 20% of the $ 167 m budget for<br />
the BTEC nationwide, that's over the four years from 1988 to 1992<br />
and that $ 56m of that is budgetted to the Northern Territory<br />
and, as you know the main incentive is to continue the campaign,<br />
in to protect the export market access for Australian beef. Now I<br />
understand what you are saying in respect to the buffalo industry<br />
and I repeat I won't have the opportunity of meeting with your<br />
council myself but I -will convey your concern to John Kerin and<br />
ask that he speak with you.<br />
TOM: I believe Bob that John Kerin is due in the Territory in a<br />
short while ( What within the next few days is he No sorry,<br />
within the next, I think, four weeks.<br />
PH&amp; Y'eah well I'll speak to John and ask that he hear what you've<br />
got to say. ( OR, very good)<br />
KROHN: Just before you go Mr Prime Minister I know that you're...<br />
you have to hurry away. Can I get your impression of your vision<br />
for the Northern Territory for the future.<br />
PM: Yeah, well you ask, Col, my vision for the Northern<br />
Territory. I want to say this. Your listeners just don't have to<br />
depend upon a politician now uttering a few fine words. I just<br />
ask them to look at the record since we've been in. And in six<br />
years we've taken the view that the Northern Territory is a very<br />
important part of Australia in not only terms of its own<br />
population but its importance for these reasons. 1. It has a<br />
very great strategic significiance and. we are daily giving<br />
evidence to the people of the Northern Territory of our<br />
commitment to ensuring that in the effective defence of Australia<br />
that the Northern Territory is going to be playing an important<br />
role, hence the expenditure of such enormous amounts of money<br />
including for example the $ 230 odd million in the first stage of<br />
Tindal which is going to be added to significantly in the second<br />
stage. We are spending money up here in a way which is not only<br />
protecting the defence and strategic interests of Australia but<br />
is boosting the Northern Territory economy. Secondly we recognise<br />
the importance for the future of the Territory and of Australia<br />
of tourism and so we are both protecting the environment of the<br />
Territory in a way which will mean increasingly tens of thousands<br />
of other Australians and overseas visitors wfll be coming here to<br />
see the natural wonders of the Territory and in so doing, boost<br />
your economy,, and providing facilities, additional facilities as<br />
I've just announced, the road funding for the Olgas... </p>
<p>we see the Territory as a very important part of the total<br />
Australian economy and we will continue to make sure that in the<br />
relevant areas where we can directly be of assistance we will* We<br />
understand, and I think you people understand in the Territory,<br />
that we can't just be giving, handing out money in general terms<br />
in excessive ways by way of grants to the Territories but in the<br />
process of adjusting the financial relationship I think even-our<br />
political opponents in the Government up here will acknowledge<br />
that at the last Premiers Conference we agreed to make special<br />
arrangements to help the phasing in of the new situation.<br />
Currently those discussions are still going on in the lead-up to<br />
the next Premiers conference and Loan Council meeting and I can<br />
assure the listeners, your listeners and the people of the<br />
Northern Territory, that we'll continue to take into account the<br />
special features of life in the Northern Territory and do what we<br />
have done in particular areas to ensure that the strengths that<br />
you have here are going to be added to and the particular<br />
interests and concerns that you have are protected.<br />
KROHiNt Mr Hawke,, just one more brief question. With the departure<br />
of Mr Punch in NSW f rom your ministry you said that you have a<br />
lot of talent to choose from ( yes). Does that talent include a<br />
likely Minister from the Northern Territory, Senator Bob Collins<br />
or M~ r Warren Snowdon<br />
PM: They are two blokes, in my judgment, of outstanding talent.<br />
Neither of them would expect that they would be filling the<br />
vacancy on this occasion, but in regard to each of them, by the<br />
record they've established, not merely in advancing vigorously<br />
the interests of the Northern Territory, but in the general<br />
contribution they make in the Parliament and in the Party, they<br />
each have legitimate expectations in the future of reaching<br />
ministerial ranks. Either of them would be a valuable addition to<br />
the Ministry.<br />
0 KXROIINs Mr Prime Minister thank you very much for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed Col to you and to your listeners.<br />
