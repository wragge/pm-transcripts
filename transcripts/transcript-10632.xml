    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>A very good evening indeed. Welcome to the programme on this Wednesday</p>
<p>   night. Yes, it is the 10th of June 1998 a day when the Prime Minister,</p>
<p>   John Howard is here to chat with me and then take your calls as</p>
<p>   well, so if you want to talk to the Prime Minister, and have your</p>
<p>   say, now is the chance so listeners, your big chance, your opportunity</p>
<p>   on the Sky Radio Network right around Australia tonight. And whether</p>
<p>   you want to talk about the GST, Aboriginal Affairs, Immigration,</p>
<p>   dole bludgers, nursing homes or any aspect of government policy,</p>
<p>   it doesn't matter what it is. He'll even talk to you about</p>
<p>   the St George Rugby League team as well. Heaps of things to talk</p>
<p>   about so you can give us a call on 131332. I am pleased to say that</p>
<p>   I have the Prime Minister here in the studio with me. John, it's</p>
<p>   great to have you here.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's very good to be back. I think it's the first</p>
<p>   time as Prime Minister and once before in another job, but it's</p>
<p>   great to be here. You've got a great programme and I'm</p>
<p>   very happy to appear and to talk to you and answer your listeners.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>I guess when we look at this programme, we look at people who've</p>
<p>   been out there all day, working very hard, want to come home and</p>
<p>   have their say. They vent their spleens, spit the dummy, do whatever</p>
<p>   it is that they do and they do it here on the night-time programme</p>
<p>   and they get very aggravated with some of the politicians, with</p>
<p>   some of the things that they do. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's fair enough and part of my job is to listen to</p>
<p>   people and the first responsibility of a political leader is to</p>
<p>   connect with the people that he aspires to lead to hear what they've</p>
<p>   got to say, to communicate with them and listen to what they've</p>
<p>   got to say, and if he agrees, say so, and if he doesn't, say</p>
<p>   why and perhaps go away a little wiser as a result. </p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Now is that political leader having a good time?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I am. It's tough on occasions....</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>I mean it's all very well....yeah...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But, it is still a job that gives you a tremendous experience and</p>
<p>   there is an enormous buzz about the day-to-day responsibility and</p>
<p>   the opportunity of meeting so many different Australians in so many</p>
<p>   different parts of our country.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>I mean, when you were running up to the election and things like</p>
<p>   that, and you've aspired to the job for so many years, a lot</p>
<p>   of people get to that job, finally, after aspiring to it and then</p>
<p>   it's a bit of a let down. I have to say that in the first six</p>
<p>   months or so, it seemed to me it was a bit of a let down to you</p>
<p>   because you seemed to be, I don't know, all over the place</p>
<p>   there.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm interested that you say that. I haven't felt as though</p>
<p>   it was a let down, or it hasn't disappointed me. It's</p>
<p>   hard on occasions. It's inspiring on other occasions. It's</p>
<p>   frustrating on yet further occasions and exhilarating on still other</p>
<p>   occasions and you experience all of those emotions but I think I</p>
<p>   have achieved a number of things but there's still a lot of</p>
<p>   other things I want to achieve. The best part of the job is talking</p>
<p>   to so many different Australians in so many different parts of the</p>
<p>   country.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Would you rather win the election or see St George win the competition?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's very, very hard. I am of course, </p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>You're torn between the two I know.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>As well as being a follower, I'm the patron of that greatest</p>
<p>   Rugby League club in the world and I of course....</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>They've done well, haven't they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They have been tremendous this year. I think they're such</p>
<p>   a team. I went to Mark Coyne's testimonial dinner a few weeks</p>
<p>   ago and the quiet, purposeful teamwork of those blokes is tremendous</p>
<p>   and they really are in with a great show this year. A bit of an</p>
<p>   upset last weekend, I've got to say, but you need that in sport</p>
<p>   as in politics occasionally to keep you on the mark. </p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>I guess you do. I guess everyone today is talking about interest</p>
<p>   rates. Now, I suppose, I spoke to my bank manager this afternoon</p>
<p>   and I couldn't get to him this afternoon because he'd</p>
<p>   just been deluged with people ringing up about interest rates, are</p>
<p>   they going to go up, are they going to go down, what is going to</p>
<p>   happen. Are you going to try and put some pressure on the Reserve</p>
<p>   Bank, because the Reserve Bank must be starting to wilt under the</p>
<p>   pressure of the dollar going down?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not going to talk about the future direction of</p>
<p>   interest rates. It may disappoint you and your listeners, but generally</p>
<p>   speaking it's unwise for Prime Ministers, particularly at a</p>
<p>   time when the level of the dollar is in the news, to talk about</p>
<p>   the future level. I can observe that interest rates now are lower</p>
<p>   than what they were when we came into office, but I'm not going</p>
<p>   to talk. I'll talk about most things tonight and I'll</p>
<p>   be as candid as possible but in the current circumstances for me</p>
<p>   to start expressing views about the future direction of interest</p>
<p>   rates, or for the Treasurer to do it, or anybody else in senior</p>
<p>   authority to do it is not wise and I'm not going to do it.</p>
<p>   I hope you understand it. It's just a sense of responsibility</p>
<p>   and what is appropriate. I'm not going to talk about that and</p>
<p>   I'm not going to talk about the level of the dollar either.</p>
<p>   I can talk about the strengths of the economy.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Well, we must talk about the level of the dollar because, I mean,</p>
<p>   it's under pressure. Where is it under pressure from? Why is</p>
<p>   it under pressure? People are sitting home there tonight and saying,</p>
<p>   well why is the dollar suddenly under pressure?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Stan, I'm in the difficult position that I want to be very</p>
<p>   candid with you but I also understand that the way the financial</p>
<p>   markets operate and people never go to bed in the financial markets.</p>
<p>   They're operating 24 hours a day all around the world and Prime</p>
<p>   Ministers make the odd remark - it can be taken out of context,</p>
<p>   it can be misunderstood, it can be well intentioned and it can then</p>
<p>   be moulded by the financial markets as indicating something and</p>
<p>   then transactions can occur off the back of that and this is just</p>
<p>   not very helpful and I will, therefore, on that issue, have to say,</p>
<p>   no, I will not comment. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>No, okay. But are overseas money people putting pressure on the</p>
<p>   Australian dollar by selling it short or what are they doing?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's just another way of asking the earlier question.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good on you for trying, and you'll understand if I get the</p>
<p>   elbow back and just tap the ball back along the wicket in true Geoffrey</p>
<p>   Boycott style. Okay?</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Is that a polite way of saying no comment'?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Indeed. It's a cricketing way of saying no comment'.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>This morning, Peter Costello said that the tax package is still</p>
<p>   months away, but rumours circulating the business community suggest</p>
<p>   that the details are going to be available on June 21st. Now ...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can tell you, there's no particular date fixed, and</p>
<p>   we are working on it and it will be ready soon. I'm not going</p>
<p>   to put weeks or months on it but we are working on it. We need tax</p>
<p>   reform in this country and we'll have it out and we'll</p>
<p>   have all the details in front of people and they'll be able</p>
<p>   to absorb it well before the election.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>All right. You've had a lot of pressure on you about the GST.</p>
<p>   Is there any chance that we won't have a GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you can't have fundamental reform in Australia without</p>
<p>   having a broad-based indirect tax. Some people call that a GST.</p>
<p>   Some people call it a value added tax. Other people call it something</p>
<p>   else, which I won't repeat tonight, but you do need, in this</p>
<p>   country if you want decent tax reform, if you want a new system,</p>
<p>   you can't leave the existing wholesale tax system where it</p>
<p>   is. You've got to grab hold of it and replace it with a new</p>
<p>   and fairer system that treats everybody equally. The present system</p>
<p>   treats people unequally. I mean, neither you nor I can afford to</p>
<p>   buy a Lear Jet but if we could, we wouldn't pay any wholesale</p>
<p>   tax on it but we can both afford to buy a family car and we pay</p>
<p>   22 per cent wholesale tax on that. You pay 12, 22, 32 on household</p>
<p>   goods, 32 per cent on videos, 32 per cent on TV cameras, but zero</p>
<p>   on a lot of other things like caviar, and really expensive nights</p>
<p>   out in the best restaurants in town, so you need to even all of</p>
<p>   that up and so you do need a replacement for the existing wholesale</p>
<p>   tax system.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Six months ago, the polls were saying that yes, Australians would</p>
<p>   vote for a GST, they thought it was terrific. There seems to be</p>
<p>   more confusion now, just as much confusion as when John Hewson was</p>
<p>   trying to sell it years ago. Now, obviously the Labor Party have</p>
<p>   come in, the Democrats have come in, Pauline Hanson's come</p>
<p>   into the picture as well and once again, we find the Australian</p>
<p>   public is confused about this GST.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they won't be confused about our plan when it comes out.</p>
<p>   Inevitably, when you get close to releasing something, there's</p>
<p>   a bit of a vacuum and I understand that, and we'll come under</p>
<p>   questioning and scrutiny over the next few weeks until it comes</p>
<p>   out, and when it does come out all of that will be blown away and</p>
<p>   forgotten and people will focus on what is there. It will include</p>
<p>   the cuts in personal income tax. We would never ever introduce a</p>
<p>   goods and services tax on top of the existing system. We would only</p>
<p>   introduce it in replacement. I mean it is not really a new tax,</p>
<p>   it is a replacement of existing taxes accompanied by reductions</p>
<p>   in personal income tax.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Are you going to get rid of payroll tax? I know that it is a State</p>
<p>   issue.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There are a whole raft of taxes that people would like us to get</p>
<p>   rid of. You've got to remember that if you are going to get</p>
<p>   rid of one tax then the tax that replaces it has raise an equivalent</p>
<p>   amount of money. So that is a factor that you have to take into</p>
<p>   account in determining how many taxes you can get rid of with a</p>
<p>   new fairer tax. </p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>All right. Now you are going to take some calls tonight. </p>
<p>Okay, first caller, I believe we have Karen Abrahams there. Karen</p>
<p>   you are speaking with the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Hello with Mr Howard, it is Karen Abrahams from Women's Action</p>
<p>   Alliance calling.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes Karen.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Just ringing to inquire about whether the Government's current</p>
<p>   review of the taxation system has a commitment there to make the</p>
<p>   taxation system more family friendly than the current system is?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes it has. One of the five principles that I laid down included</p>
<p>   a commitment that any reduction in personal income tax would particularly</p>
<p>   advantage families and those people who fought for a long time for</p>
<p>   a fairer tax system for families and one that recognised more than</p>
<p>   in the past, the cost of bringing up children, will not be disappointed</p>
<p>   when this platform comes out. I can assure you of that. </p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>We have another caller Prime Minister, actually it is a bloke that</p>
<p>   you know pretty well, Keith Williams is on the line. Keith say hello</p>
<p>   to the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good evening John. How are you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not bad, how are you battling? </p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Oh, battling is the word. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Continuing to battle.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good on you.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>But after four and a half years.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know, well you deserve a medal. You have had a lot of obstruction</p>
<p>   and I know that you have not always agreed with me, or my Government,</p>
<p>   but at least we gave you a go.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes we're able to move forward, but I am very interested to</p>
<p>   know John that if your Government is re-elected, are you going to</p>
<p>   take any firm action to stop the recurrence of what's happened</p>
<p>   to me. Because that just amounts to the fact that properly approved</p>
<p>   projects are being harassed by a group of fanatics who have no standing</p>
<p>   in the community and who quite openly take the law into their own</p>
<p>   hands.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I can assure you that I will always try and stop fanatics</p>
<p>   taking the law into their own hands, whether they effect Keith Williams</p>
<p>   or Stan Zemanek, or anybody else. For the benefit of people who</p>
<p>   may not know, Keith, and that is probably only a small number of</p>
<p>   people.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>I think everybody knows Keith Williams.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Particularly in Queensland, this is the bloke who has been battling</p>
<p>   against the radical greenies for the Hinchinbrook project in Queensland</p>
<p>   and he was victimised by the former Federal Labor Government that</p>
<p>   stopped him starting, we did change that. He is not terribly happy</p>
<p>   with some aspects of the way in which the thing has progressed since</p>
<p>   then, but I think you would have to agree that we have given him</p>
<p>   the opportunity, and I know the people of the Calwell district in</p>
<p>   Queensland are delighted that the project is going ahead and it</p>
<p>   is because they see job opportunities.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>But he has been victimised though by the environmentalists who</p>
<p>   have been running riot and it has cost him a fortune.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they have not been able to run riot, I mean they were able</p>
<p>   to run riot until the change of Government and then we did allow</p>
<p>   the project to go ahead, and I can say to you Keith, I mean I suppose</p>
<p>   we could spend a couple of hours talking about the details of your</p>
<p>   situation, but whether it is now or after the next election, if</p>
<p>   you are being, if people are running riot, then of course you have</p>
<p>   a legitimate cause to complain, and of course the Government will</p>
<p>   do all in its power to stop that occurring and I admire your tenacity.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Keith, are you being treated fairly by this Government?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Well, I hate to say it, I have never been treated fairly by any</p>
<p>   Government, and certainly this is has been an improvement.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There you are, from Keith that's not bad. That is fantastic.</p>
<p>   The gold star award.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>This situation, Stan, where a lot of obligations that still remain</p>
<p>   with me are not there for environmental purposes. They have nothing</p>
<p>   to do with the environment whatsoever, they are still there strictly</p>
<p>   for political purposes. And I am also interested to know when the</p>
<p>   Government is going to stop squandering the taxpayers' money</p>
<p>   on funding these fanatics who hide under a thin veil of being conservationists</p>
<p>   and even so-called reputable conservation organisations like the</p>
<p>   Conservation Foundation of Australia, blatantly put out brochures</p>
<p>   containing nothing but blatant lies.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, can I say Keith in relation to not only groups in the conservation</p>
<p>   area but in a lot of other areas, there has been a massive reduction</p>
<p>   in funding by this Government of what I might loosely call public</p>
<p>   advocacy groups. Not only in the environmental area but in a whole</p>
<p>   lot of other areas including, in particular, the trade unions who</p>
<p>   were getting millions and millions of dollars from the former Government</p>
<p>   to make what was none other than political propaganda. But, Keith,</p>
<p>   come what may I would be, of course, be happy because we have made</p>
<p>   contact yet again, I would be very very happy to pursue this a bit</p>
<p>   further, and I will make sure my office speaks to you again in the</p>
<p>   next couple of days.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Well, Keith that's not a bad offer and I'm sure you'd</p>
<p>   like to take that one up.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Well that's the best offer I've had all night. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is only twenty past nine.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Well it's the best offer and the only offer you're going</p>
<p>   to get tonight from the Prime Minister. Keith I thank you for being</p>
<p>   on the programme.</p>
<p>Prime Minister we get calls in here every night from people, people</p>
<p>   in small business, in big business, and they are always complaining</p>
<p>   about the unfair dismissal laws.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, well the unfair dismissal laws will get carried if the Labor</p>
<p>   Party and the Democrats and the Independents in the Senate do their</p>
<p>   job.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>You said that last time and they won't agree with you. They</p>
<p>   don't want to agree with you and they don't want to pass</p>
<p>   the laws, and so we're stuck with the unfair dismissal law.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>All right but if we have a double dissolution, which is a possibility,</p>
<p>   and I win, we can present that unfair dismissal law at a joint sitting</p>
<p>   straight after the double dissolution and we've got a majority</p>
<p>   at that joint sitting which I hope we do, if we don't, well</p>
<p>   then we're all history, well certainly my Government is, then</p>
<p>   we'll get that unfair dismissal law passed. That's the</p>
<p>   whole purpose of putting up to the Senate twice, putting it up to</p>
<p>   the Senate twice.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>I understand all that though, but I mean, this is one of the reasons,</p>
<p>   I mean we've still got 8% unemployment and probably a lot more</p>
<p>   unemployed people out there.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Bosses will not put on people.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I understand that.</p>
<p> ZEMANEK:: </p>
<p>.....if they can't sack them. You know, I'm a great believer</p>
<p>   that if the boss writes the cheque, he raises the money, he pays</p>
<p>   the wages, he must have the right to be able sack people if he thinks</p>
<p>   that they're not doing the job.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I agree with that. But the only way I can change that is to change</p>
<p>   the law and I can't change the law except in accordance with</p>
<p>   the law of Australia, in accordance with the Constitution. And I'm</p>
<p>   going through that process and I say to all of the small businessmen</p>
<p>   who are listening to me, I understand your concern, I agree with</p>
<p>   you, we've put the bill up twice, under the Constitution we</p>
<p>   cannot make it law unless we first have a double dissolution and</p>
<p>   then if we get a majority in the two Houses after that double dissolution</p>
<p>   I can have a joint sitting and I can put it </p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...[inaudible] ...that and it will then become law. Now I wish</p>
<p>   it were otherwise, but like any other Australian citizen I am bound</p>
<p>   by the Constitution. We do live in a law abiding society and I obey</p>
<p>   the law and the law says to me, John Howard you cannot change that</p>
<p>   unfair dismissal without making, going through this process and</p>
<p>   I'm doing that. I'm sorry it's taking so long. I</p>
<p>   didn't vote against it. The Labor Party, and the Democrats,</p>
<p>   and the Independents, and the Greens and the others in the Senate</p>
<p>   voted against it. If we have a double dissolution then I can get</p>
<p>   it through at a Joint Sitting.</p>
<p>ZEMANEK:</p>
<p>What are the chances, your chances of having just another election</p>
<p>   or are there more chances of having a double dissolution. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think it's fairly evenly balanced at the moment. I</p>
<p>   think you'd have to say that a double dissolution is tempting</p>
<p>   in the sense that it is only through a double dissolution that I</p>
<p>   can get the Native Title mess fixed up, and I can get things like</p>
<p>   the unfair dismissal law changed. On the other hand, the mathematics</p>
<p>   are that after a double dissolution I'll probably have fewer</p>
<p>   Senators than I would after a half-Senate election and that's</p>
<p>   something I've got to weigh in the balance but I really do</p>
<p>   want to get this Native Title mess fixed up. The bill we put up</p>
<p>   is a very fair compromise and if it doesn't go through you</p>
<p>   are going to have untold litigation and you're going to have</p>
