OPENING CF NEW SCIENCE BUILDING AT GEELONG COLLEGE<br />
GEELONG,, VICORIA<br />
1i2i1iao.,. ar 196<br />
SpReech by the Prime Minister,~ the Rt. Hong Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Sir Arthur, Moderator and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
This seems to be my golden opportunity for making<br />
a record short speech before~ the rain comes down heavily, I was<br />
told just now by Sir Arthur Coles I was questioned by him<br />
did I believe in miracles? He then began to describe a few of<br />
which he was aware, How ridiculous to ask me whether I believed<br />
in miracles. When I look back on the last seven Federal elections,<br />
I know that they happen. ( Laughter) I am a convinced believer.<br />
( Applause) Now, just in case we get washed out, I must recall<br />
at once that it is my duty to open the building in the name of<br />
Sir Arthur Coles, to open one of the two labs* in it, to name it<br />
after the late Mr. Roper and to name the other one after a<br />
celebrated character of whom I used to hear a great deal when<br />
my boys were here Tammy Henderson. ( Applause) I think it is<br />
a concession to Presbyterian respectability that the lab, to be<br />
named after him is the ' IT. Henderson Laboratory". It should<br />
have been " Tammy Henderson Laboratory." However, I merely throw<br />
that suggestion out.<br />
Now I want to tell my old friend and competitor,<br />
Mr. Robson, something. I called him a competitor because this<br />
is about the seventh or eighth time that I have attended the<br />
opening of a science lab, partly built by the funds of the<br />
Industrial Fund. Each time he listens carefully to what I say,<br />
the next time he uses it all himself. ( Laughter) This man has<br />
literally left me with not a feather to fly with time after time<br />
and yet I forgive him because if it is any comfort to him and to<br />
the gentlemen with whom he works in this imaginative Industrial<br />
Fund, I would like to say that the idea put forward by me and<br />
now in course of being carried out owes not a little to the<br />
existence of the Industrial Fund and its imaginative suggestions<br />
which entered my mind and the minds of my colleagues. And so I<br />
would like to say an additional " thankyou" l to him for this.<br />
Now, it is quite right that this building is partly<br />
the Fund, but it is also, in a very large degree, the result of<br />
two remarkable private benefactions -from Sir Arthur Coles and<br />
Mrs. Roper. ( Applause) And you know ladies and gentlemen, there<br />
is a certain symbolism about this, hope that whatever governments<br />
may do and my own does what it can in these fields we will<br />
never reach the point at which private citizens feel that their<br />
own obligations end with the payment of their taxes. That, I think,<br />
would be the defeat of humanity. I don't want governments to be<br />
responsible for all those things in a school like this or elsewhere<br />
which appear to be good things. And that is why it is a splendid<br />
thing for our country that we should have people like th~ e two<br />
to whom I have made reference, and there are many others here whom<br />
I recall in other fields who have shown that they have a sense of<br />
personal obligation achieving personal satisfaction in doing something<br />
of this kind and I hope that that will go on whatever may<br />
be done by governments, * 0 0 0 / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Now perha T might sysp s orethng about what is<br />
being done. I have no idea ho mu~ ch money the Industrial F'und<br />
has raised or spends0 A-1-I 1_* o is it seemed to me as I went<br />
from one place to another to amount to a very groat deal, but when<br />
I announced our proposals that we would take what is, In terms of<br />
a Federal Government, a revolutionary step of' providing œ% 1M a year<br />
' in aid of buildings and equipmen~ t for scientific teaching in<br />
secondary schools, I don't know that everybody realised how enormous<br />
a thing this was fœ 5M. a year not œ C5146 spread over some long<br />
period and if one estimates that the independent schools<br />
represent a quartor, contain a quarter of those who aro engaged in<br />
secondary education'which I think is a fairly accurate estimate,<br />
this means that a maillion and a quarter a year will find its way<br />
into purposes of this kind. And I hope that in the doing of this<br />
work, we will take the fullest advantage of the enormous experience<br />
that Mr. Robson has had and those associated with him have had.<br />
We do want to feel that all this money will go to the right spots<br />
at the right time and to achieve the right purpose,<br />
Now there is one other thing that I would like to<br />
say to you. I have had the great pleasure of being associated<br />
with an enormous development in the university world in Australia,<br />
but one of the things that disturbs me, aond I think disturbs<br />
other people, is the relatively high failure rate in the universities<br />
in their first year. Great experts have commented on this and<br />
many have been prepared to say, and no doubt with some truth,<br />
that something ought to be done to improve the standard of<br />
qualification the student has before he is thrown into the waters<br />
of the university. Well yucan do that, we thought, in two ways.<br />
It is very important to JIo it.<br />
One is so to improve the scientific equipment in<br />
the secondary schools as to give every boy or girl who has a<br />
scientific bent an opportunity to be much better trained, much<br />
further forward, much more accustomed to the handling of new<br />
techniques and new equipment than ever before and I am sure that<br />
this is going to pay enormous dividends in the development of the<br />
universities, in the development of science and, therefore, in<br />
the development of Australia.<br />
And, of course, associated with ta, letme remind<br />
you, we have in hand proposals for the creation of a very large<br />
number of special scholarships not from primary schools to<br />
secondary not from secondary to the university; we already have<br />
a lot of ihose but in the secondary schools themselves, to enable<br />
a student to have an extra year or two years so as to improve his<br />
sixth form, his honours standing. I am perfectly certain that<br />
Mr. Robson will agree that this is a splendid idea. It isn't<br />
always easy to say to a boy or girl " Well, you ought to have<br />
another year at school; you ought Lo take another year of honours." 1<br />
In this mercantile world, we are all a little bit inclined to<br />
think, " No, no. The sooner they are out the better. The sooner<br />
they are earning some money the better," I think myself that if<br />
we could bring about a state of affairs in which a few thousand<br />
students at secondary schools, who otherwise would have left school,<br />
stay on and do an honours course, stay on for a year, for two years,<br />
so that they then develop the urge for learning and go to a<br />
university not as prospective failures but as prospective successes,<br />
this would be a wonderful thing for Australia.<br />
We are a rather comfortable democracy. We are a<br />
well-paid democracy. We must become a highly-trained and intelligent<br />
democracy. We must make learning fashionable. We must make it<br />
rather the correct thing to be tremendously good at some branch<br />
of knowledge and, of course, I as you have been reminded, have<br />
had a couple of entirely unscientific sons at this school. I dont </p>
<p>3<br />
think they ever learned a. nything about physics, Sorry0 I know<br />
that they were well ta-7dil; 0 Al~ l I . f : c-meinber about it is that<br />
action and reaction are equal and opposite -a principle that<br />
has guided me in politics for a long time. ( Laughter)<br />
But, really, l1adies and gentlemen, when I was a<br />
schoolboy if you can imagine so remote a period of time<br />
the scientific equipment was deplorable; a few bum~ en burners,<br />
a few scales a few test tubes. Nothing. And this was regarded<br />
as a rather depraved form of witohcraft which healthy schoolboys<br />
would hardly be associated with0 Now, each time I go through<br />
one of these new school wings, I, the most unscientific of<br />
people, find myself fully persua ded that if they had had that<br />
in my time, I would now be a scientist, and that would have,<br />
of course, given immense credit to one of your most distinguished<br />
old boys, a very famous scientist, who was unkind enough to say,<br />
only a year or two ago in my presence on some public occasion<br />
that he thought it essential that every Cabinet Minister should<br />
have a scientific degree, to which I hasten to assure you I<br />
replied that if that ever happened, that would be the end of the<br />
world for the scientists, No scientists in a department would<br />
ever have any hope of survival if his Minister thought that ho<br />
knew more than his expert adviser, So on the whole, it is a good<br />
thing to have as Ministers ordinary fellows like me wbo are not<br />
scientists, but who have our lucid intervals in which we are<br />
perfectly capable of understanding what other people are saying to<br />
us. I musn't ramble on. I have really talked the rain<br />
away you must concede that point. I am delighted about all<br />
this. I am sorry that Frank Rolland can't be here. This would<br />
be a great vision for him, but I am delighted. I have seen this<br />
school grow over a long period of years, grow in strength and<br />
grow in beauty and now adding to itself something which I hope<br />
will make a powerful contribution to scientific training.<br />
Might I just say one thing before I conclude. I<br />
thought, what with all the sputniks and what-have-you, that there<br />
would be a complete run on science courses in the universities.<br />
This happens not to be true. The Monash University was created<br />
and expressly stated to be one that would have a bent in the<br />
direction of engineering and science. It is their engineering<br />
and science faculties that are half filled; it is the humanities<br />
side that is overcrowded. Maybe therefore, that with al. l these<br />
improved facilities in this rapidly-changing world of science<br />
teaching and experiment, that with all this, we will find that<br />
we are helping to solve that problem by producing a much higher<br />
percentage of those who look on science not just as a possible<br />
job but as something that they can't live without. And you know,<br />
ladies and gentlemen, that is true of anything you are to do,<br />
Unless you feel you couldn't live without doing that particular<br />
thing, then you won't be very much good at it. But give me the<br />
man who is enthusiastic, who has a devotion, who has a sense of<br />
vocation in any occupation and I will show you the man or woman<br />
who is going to make easily the most effective contribution.<br />
And so, Sir, I have great pleasure great honour in<br />
naming this building after Sir Arthur Colas and. in naming the<br />
two labs in the sense I have described. I want to say that my<br />
pleasure on this occasion is equalled only by the pleasure of<br />
my wife who got to know this place very well over a period of<br />
years and who is delighted like me to see what great strides<br />
the school made when the Menzies left, </p>
