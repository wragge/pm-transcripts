_-rATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. E. G. WHITLAM, CQ. C., M. P.,<br />
lDBY THE MINISTER FOR OVERSEAS TRADE A19D SECONiDARY INDUSTIRY,<br />
* DR. J. F. CAIRNS, WEDNESDAY 18T-H JULY, 1973 AT 7. OOPM.<br />
TARIFF REDUCTION<br />
1. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Overseas<br />
Trade and for Secondary Industry today announced a decision<br />
taken by the Australian Government for a reduction of<br />
in all tariffs each tariff will be reduced by 4 of what<br />
it is now excluding revenue items and anti-dumping duties.<br />
This reduction which will apply forthwith, is designed to<br />
restrain price increases by increased competition and by<br />
stimulating in the short run a sufficiently large inflow<br />
of additional imports to help-~ meet pressing demand. Action<br />
to combat price inflation through tariff action was clearly<br />
forecast in the Prime Minister's policy speech and has<br />
recently been urged upon the Government by Trade Union,<br />
primary production 1) commercial and industrial groups. The<br />
Government has also decided that in future by-law administration<br />
will be more flexible. The reduction is to be<br />
combined with an ambitious program of assistance to employees<br />
and firms who may be adversely affected by the tariff<br />
reduction. 2. The decision followed unanimous advice from a<br />
Committee which was appointed on 27 June and reported on<br />
July. It was chaired by Mr. G. A. Rattigan, Chairman of<br />
the Tariff Board and comprised Professor F. H. Gruen,<br />
Consultant to the Prime Minister; Mr. B. Brogan, Consultant<br />
to the Minister f or Overseas lrrade arid for Secondary Industry;<br />
Dr. S. F. Harris, Deputy Secretary, Departmewnt of Overseas </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Trade; Mr. J. C. Taylor, First Assistant SecretCary, Department<br />
of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and Mr. F. A. Bennett,<br />
First Assistant Secretary, Department of Secondary Industry.<br />
The Committee's report will not be released at present<br />
because it also deals with matters affecting our trading<br />
relations and makes some comments on budgetary strategy. It<br />
will be released with the Budget papers.<br />
3. The justification for the general reduction of<br />
tariffs is the excessive rate of inflation which now prevails.<br />
Inflation i s harmful to every Australian. Action must be<br />
taken to reduce its harmful effects with the least delayl.<br />
Inflation can be offset by an increase of supply of goods in<br />
. Australia. The most readily available source . of supply of<br />
goods is imports from overseas. Whilst it is 6xpected that<br />
imports will increase in the next few months, because of the<br />
high level of tariffs the increase would be insufficient to<br />
help combat inflation. Consequently the Government has<br />
decided to reduce tariffs so that imports may increase in<br />
the short term to help meet inflationary pressures in Australia.<br />
4. The tariff changes will have a direct impact-on<br />
import prices of approximately the same order of magnitude as*<br />
a revaluation of slightly less than Increased competition<br />
in Australia will have a salutary effect upon those<br />
who have taken advantage of shortages by unjustified price<br />
increases which have exploited the public. The Joint Committee on<br />
2 </p>
<p>Prices will be asked to ensure that consumers get the full<br />
benefit of these reductions as it is already doing by its<br />
present inquiry on import prices. The earlier reference<br />
to the Committee related to the revaluation of the Australian<br />
dollar in December, 1972 and other relevant currency changes<br />
in 1973. The Government is similarly determined that import<br />
prices respond to the tariff reduction.<br />
The increased imports may affect production and<br />
employment in Australia. A Tribunal is being established<br />
to immediately hear appeals from any firm or company which<br />
may be seriously affected by imports. The Tribunal will be<br />
authorised to immediately recommend appropriatL-e assistance<br />
either to bring about changes for a firm or company or to<br />
restore the tariff level which previously protected it.<br />
Any person who may lose his job as a result of these changes<br />
will be entitled to receive, as special readjustment assistance,<br />
a weekly amount equal to his average wage in the previous<br />
six months until he obtains or is found~ suitable alternative<br />
employment. Subh persons will be of fered retraining for new<br />
and better occupations if they so desire. The Government<br />
has provided $ 25m to cover assistance which may be necessary<br />
as a result of the tariff changes. The procedure for providing<br />
assistance required as a result of these changes are set<br />
out in a separate statement which is attaolhed.<br />
6. While these changes can be expected to require some<br />
workers to move from one employment to another this must be<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
seen against the existing high level of unfilled vacancies<br />
and rising employment opportunities. The Governmnent is<br />
confident that most of the employees who may be affected<br />
will gain from the assistance provided and from the new<br />
opportunities which will be created. In making -this<br />
decision the Government is conscious of the urgent need<br />
for some major steps to deal with inflation. It has<br />
adopted these changes as part of a complex of measures<br />
some of which have already been taken and others will follow.<br />
These tariff changes will assist in the fight against inflation<br />
in the interest of the nation as a whole and at the<br />
same time the Government is confident that losses which may<br />
affect individuals will be adequately otfset . by readily<br />
available assistance.<br />
7. This decision represents a major step towards<br />
implementing the Government's objcctive of support for<br />
moves to liberalise international trade moves which in<br />
the long term can only strengthen the economies of the<br />
trading countries of the world. Consistent with these<br />
objectives the Government intends to imqplement its international<br />
commitments, which are of principle concern to<br />
New Zealand and Canada, in the contexi. of the new tariff<br />
structure. Furthermore, the scheme to aid developing<br />
countries, announced by the Minister for Overseas Trade<br />
and for Secondary Industry on 3 July, will be implemented<br />
and existing and future preference margins will be lowered<br />
from the new general tariff rate. </p>

SP-CIAL ASSI C iEUIRDl A: A RESULT C<br />
THl-I. EAUIiES TAE. TOl IITCJ., 1IOA. E<br />
On the recommendation of the Prime Minister<br />
and Minister for Overseas Trade and for Secondary Industry,<br />
the Government has established a Tribunal to examine and<br />
report on requests for relief for the measures taken to<br />
increase the demand for imports rwhere a domestic industry is<br />
being seriously damaged by the tariff reduction. The<br />
tribunal will be guided by two basic principles; its<br />
recommendations should be compatible w. ith the long-term<br />
objectives of assistance to industries, and it should not<br />
provide relief as a matter of course that is, simply<br />
because the question of relief hod been referred to it.<br />
The Government has also decided that there should be<br />
established an effective ranre of adjustment assistance<br />
measures which would be available to assist in'those cases<br />
where the Tribunal felt that some assistance was required<br />
but that restoration of the duties in whole or in part<br />
*' as not a suitable means of assistance.<br />
If the Tribunal were to recommrend relief too<br />
readily by raising, perhaps, to their former level.,<br />
individual tariffs which have just been. reduced as part<br />
of a general tariff cut, the purpose of the initial tariff<br />
cut would be largely frustrated. The desired increase in<br />
imports resulting fromthe tariff reduction would not occur,<br />
and the desired increase in aggregate domestic supplies<br />
would not be achieved. In other w. ords, the antiinflationary<br />
impact of the original measure would be<br />
seriously weakened. </p>
<p>If. L the Tribulnal 7rere to provide relief ( paroticularly<br />
in more highly protected iusre) not by raisingr tariff-: s<br />
previously reduced, but by other measures such as;<br />
comnensati on ipayments the -nrohlmcrsd-' r---. ribed above could<br />
be partly avoided. ]' ut compensation paymiento or other<br />
direct subsidies to aparticular industry could ha,, ve<br />
uidecira'ole side effects, particularly if those payments<br />
were not m-iade conditi onal on some adjustment by the industry<br />
concerned to the new situation. For examiple, c ompersation<br />
p ayments, if the--y are equivalent to the tariLff te ubsiAdy'<br />
they replace, could continue to suqoport the use of<br />
res-ources in activities which c Tc. hi. gh c ost; in these<br />
circumstances the gain to consumilers of th-. e action proposed<br />
w! ould be at the ex-, pense of taxpayerS. In cases: iw. here it is<br />
evi-dent that the induS-try could, w--ith ass~ istance; adjust<br />
to the changed circum-, nstances of import com'.--. etition ( and<br />
of protection), it irould clearly b! e, in the in~ tcres'-ts of<br />
-the cotinmunity as a whl) ole t'Uo pre-fer adjus1-tme. qntU assistance tLo<br />
rctorinr: the hig~ h rates of duty.<br />
In summary, therefore, if. 1-relief from 113 effcts<br />
of the veneral tariff redu-ction is provided readily by<br />
partially,, or -w. holly restoring7 the tari-Cfs previ. ously<br />
reduced, part iculsarly w-here the previ-ous -Gari ff1-,-as hi-, h,<br />
the ob; jcctives of the initial tariff reduction vill tend to<br />
be frus2tr! Aed; and if the reief^ i, 17 readily provided in<br />
ways w-. hich do not induce some adjustmen to the new situ., i. tion<br />

whole by makinf-more goodo.,: cervices available to the<br />
Australian people, by helping to restrain price incre! as.,., es<br />
and by improving the allocation of our resources and<br />
efficiency of our industries. These benlefits, however, ma~ y<br />
involve sonme cost in the form of reduced business<br />
opportunities for come firm-s and the need for changes in<br />
employmecnt and phaslocation for some individuals,<br />
V~ hlstthe benefits are enjoyed -enerally throug-hout the<br />
