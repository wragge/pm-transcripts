P. M. No. 29/ 1959.<br />
MEETING OF LEADERS.<br />
Statement b the Prime Minister, Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies C. H., Q. C., MP.<br />
" This is very good news. Nothing but benefit can come<br />
from meetings between the heads of government of the two most<br />
powerful countries in the world," Mr. Menzies said today.<br />
" The exchange of visits will not only reduce the current<br />
tension but will also bring President Eisenhower and Mr.<br />
Khruschev into direct and, one may hope, personal friendly<br />
relations which will render a subsequent summit meeting easier<br />
and more likely to succeed."<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T.<br />
