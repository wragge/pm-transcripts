    <content><![CDATA[<p>RIMINTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, welcome to Nightline.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good evening Hugh.</p>
<p>RIMINTON:</p>
<p>Across Australia tonight some 470 athletes have been selected to go to Athens, they must be wondering what they're in for. What are you telling them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I tell them that the Australian Government will do all we are asked to do and more, (inaudible) necessary to guarantee their safety and their security. It's important that we work with the Greek authorities, I spoke to John Coates, the head of the AOC today, and he's in regular touch with the Government. It's also important that we don't jump to conclusions that the explosions that occurred in Athens yesterday were the work of international terrorists, it may not be the case. But I understand their concerns, I also understand their desire to represent Australia and the desire of 20 million Australians to get behind them and cheer them as they go after victory in so many events.  We'll do what we can and what we're asked to do and more if necessary.</p>
<p> RIMINTON:</p>
<p>Have you strike the balance between thwarting terrorists who would presumably see it as a great prize if they could disrupt the Olympics and protecting these fine young athletes?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's a difficult balance, the Greeks have about 60,000 people involved in security activities and we are examining very closely what those arrangements are and we must of course respect the rights of the host country. But we have a good relationship with the Greek Government and the Greek people, there are a lot of family associations between Greece and Australia and I know there's a lot of good will in Greece towards our country.  That balance is not always easy but it's going to be a balance that we'll have to strike in so many things in the years ahead as the fight against terrorism goes on.</p>
<p>RIMINTON:</p>
<p>Would you rule out sending, if it was required, armed troops?  There seems to be some sort of mixed messages over that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I didn't say last night that I would, I said I wouldn't rule it out, that doesn't mean to say I'm going to do it and you have to respect the views of the host government in relation to the armed security personnel of other countries.</p>
<p>RIMINTON:</p>
<p>On Iraq Prime Minister there's increasing evidence of prisoners being killed in US custody. How much damage is this doing now to the coalition effort?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's certainly bad and I condemn it unconditionally. Any mistreatment should be condemned.  The important point to make is that the American authorities are acting quickly to bring the people alleged to have done these things to justice, that's the difference of course. When much worse than this occurred under Saddam you got promoted and applauded, you didn't get arrested and bought to justice.</p>
<p>RIMINTON:</p>
<p>Does it raise concerns though in your mind about what's been going on in Guantanamo Bay where of course two Australians are still awaiting trial?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the information we have is that those people are in good health. So the answer is no.</p>
<p>RIMINTON:</p>
<p>You're going back to Washington in a few weeks to meet again with President Bush on the war on terror. What can you offer him when you meet him in Washington?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well my main reason for going to Washington is to lobby the American Congress to pass the Free Trade Agreement that's going to be of enormous long term benefit to this country. I'll naturally talk to President Bush about that and also about what's going on Iraq. We are facing a very critical period in Iraq, and it's more than ever necessary that we don't cut and run as I've described, it's more than ever necessary that we work together because if there were to be a weakening of coalition resolve in Iraq now, that would be an enormous victory for terrorists. People say this has got nothing to do with the fight against terrorism, well you should tell the terrorists that because they are investing an enormous amount in Iraq in trying to stop the transfer to the Iraqi people of sovereign authority on the 30th of June and if they succeed that will be an enormous set back for the future of democracy in the Middle East.</p>
<p>RIMINTON:</p>
<p>On domestic matters Prime Minister, you've announced today billions of dollars in science and innovation spending.  What will that bring to Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well let me give you an example, one of the things that we're going to support are the CSIRO flagship programmes and they are special research programmes to produce food that will reduce the likelihood of people contracting heart disease or cancer. Another piece of research is to produce clean energy out of our massive reserves of coal. Another piece of research is about recycling water in our cities which might ultimately result in the ending of ocean sewage outpour. Now these three things are examples of the sort of frontier research that we're funding and the great thing about today's announcement is that we're giving long term guarantees of funding certainty and people can now plan and prepare and invest their talent in research projects years in to the future and it's very important to our country's future.</p>
<p>RIMINTON:</p>
<p>The curious thing is that we've been primed now to expect tax cuts in the Budget next week, major tax cuts in the Budget next week, and yet polls this week are showing such strong support for spending on things like health and education, possibly on innovation as well, does that surprise you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think people want the country and its Government to invest in valuable things.</p>
<p>RIMINTON:</p>
<p>(inaudible) there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And we've done that, we've invested in science and research, we've put $3 billion more into Medicare, we've invested a lot more in schools, I think people want that. Now I'm not going to start talking about tax cuts, there's a Budget coming on Tuesday night and I'm not going to get into talk about tax cuts...</p>
<p>RIMINTON:</p>
<p>No second thoughts about tax cuts...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not going to talk about the Budget. Good try.</p>
<p>RIMINTON:</p>
<p>Okay. Prime Minister Howard, thanks very much for joining us.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
