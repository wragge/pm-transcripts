I14AUGURAT ION OF LAKE~ BURLEY GRIF FFRI N,<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T-. 17TH OCTOBER$ 1264+<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir RoberL Menzies<br />
Sir At any rate, we have added a word to the vocabulary<br />
of the country, because when I knew I had to do something about<br />
this new Lake I wondered what it was open it, close it,<br />
name it what was it to be? Inaugurate. ( Laughter) I think<br />
thatts lovely. I declare this lake duly inaugurated. ( Applause)<br />
While I am making that sweeping gesture I am happy<br />
to say that I am delighted to be able to do it not only in the<br />
presence of' those who have been named so far, but ini the<br />
presence of my old friend, Sir John Butters, the first and<br />
true founder of' this city. I am delighted that he is here.<br />
( Applause) The creationl of this lake is the result of a pretty<br />
long struggle. I remezmber being very much in favour of it in<br />
the late thirties, but I was a humble, miserable out-voted<br />
Attorney-General at that tima and tkiere were powerful forces<br />
arrayed against me because there was a golf course ( Laughterl<br />
and all the Heads of all the Departments belonged to it, and<br />
they took a fine pride in making the then Prime Minister the<br />
President of the Club ( Laughter) and I fougbt an uphill battle<br />
for a long time. But after the war when I had an opportunity<br />
in my own right, I began to come back to this project because<br />
I have always believed, anid never more than today-that you<br />
can't have a great city unless you have water in It.<br />
You look around the world and wonder to yourselves<br />
what London would be like without the Thames, or what Paris<br />
would be like without the Seine. Indeed I have always thought<br />
that part of' the dullness of Berlin if I may so speak was<br />
due to the fact that it had nothing but a miserable trickle<br />
of water running through it. Water, water in all the great<br />
cities of the world, and I have looked forward to this momentor<br />
to a recent moment when the lake was filled,<br />
Now, I'm like the Minister who has made a speech in<br />
which he has covered all the things that I really wanted to<br />
say, but Itm like him, I don't mind a few blemishes on this<br />
thing. I uttered imprecations about the mosquitoes, but they've<br />
gone not because of my curses but because of the skill of<br />
the Commission. W1e all uttered curses about certain faint<br />
odours to which he has referred.<br />
Now I find that it has become rather a hobby of<br />
people to say " There was a big storm last week and a bit of the<br />
wall fell in.' 4 May I offer a heresy? I don't mind if a bit<br />
of the wall falls in. I would rather like to see a few more<br />
patches around this lake in which the wall had fallen in and<br />
in which the rushes had grown and in which the wild fowl<br />
might have their nests because I see this lake ultimately not<br />
as something purely artificial in its surr'ounding but as a<br />
haunt of birds, as a haunt of wild life. Indeed, I am optimistic<br />
enough to think the day will come when tourists coming through<br />
will be able to feed the swans and this will be quite a feature<br />
of the city. So I don't mind. Let the walls fall in as long<br />
as they don't do it completely. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Well, now, the achievement of this lake has been<br />
a long struggle, I wouldn't like to go into the details<br />
of it, but at least twice during its history, having been<br />
abroad, I found when I got back that evil men had been at<br />
work and that something was being taken away from us and<br />
I had to be the humble instrument of providence to restore<br />
it. This is of the essence, this is the heart of the city,<br />
and I hope it will be a heart that will be quietly beating,<br />
not noisy, not uproarious a quietly beating, restful heart<br />
for the rest of our lives.<br />
Now, of course, it has been beautifully done. Do<br />
let me say that to you if it needs to be said, because a<br />
lake is more than a sheet of water. You can have a sheec<br />
of water if you spend enough money on it anywhere I suppose<br />
around about, even in the middle of Australia, but it is<br />
what is around the sheet of water that helps to set the<br />
beauty of the lake, and all the work that has been done on<br />
the foreshores, in the surrounds of -this lake, all tlie<br />
additions of beauty that have been made will, I think, put<br />
us under permanent dcbt to those who have been responsible<br />
for their design and their execution.<br />
Now, Sir, there is just ono~ other thing that I wan-t*<br />
to say. I think that ' this lake, as Mr. Anthony has said<br />
is of tremendous significance to Canberra. It unites this<br />
city. Some people thought it would divide the city on the<br />
contrary it has united the city because it has given a centre<br />
and a heart to the city, and that is a very good thing for<br />
Canberra. But may I add that it is a very good thing for<br />
Australia because what is good for Canberra, what makes<br />
this capital city a more lovely and attractive city what<br />
enables this city to have directed to it the attention of<br />
millions of Australians is very good not only for Can) 3erra<br />
but for Australia, because let us face up to it we have a<br />
natural instinct, haventt we, in this country of~ ours for<br />
parochislism, for thinking in terms of States and of Atate<br />
loyalt ies. Now these are admirable things, but the nation is<br />
the great element in Australia. It is a hard and constant<br />
battle to make people understand that the Commonwealth is<br />
not a foreign power, that the Commonwealth is something<br />
that is interwoven through the whole structure of Australia<br />
and through the hearts and lives of all its people. This,<br />
though we understand it, is not easily taught, not easily<br />
understood by people who havontt bothered to consider about<br />
it. And here we are now, in a city which was a village<br />
when I first came here, some time ago, and now it is a city<br />
of 75,000 people. In due course it will be a city of half<br />
a million or of a million people. Wlhen I first came here, one<br />
almost had to apologise for having anything to do with<br />
Canberra " That silly place" 1Earnest men, in club armchairs,<br />
would debate with each other what ought to be done about<br />
Canberra most of the suggestions being rather offensive and<br />
some of them faintly obscene. ( Laughter) This doesn't happen<br />
today, Every weekend, thousands of people come in. Wherever<br />
I go in Australia now, instead of hearing somebody bleat about<br />
aso eoe* / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
Canberra and the wicked expenditure of money in this place,<br />
I have ten times as many people now saying to me, " What a<br />
wonderful place Canberra is. My wife and I went up there<br />
recently" or " We took the children up there last long<br />
vacation. What a beautiful place it is,"<br />
There is a pride in Canberra being developed<br />
and thatts tremendously important, not for us because we<br />
live in Canberra some of us temporarily this is not<br />
just a matter of pride for us. This is a matter of national<br />
importance, because more and more as people understand that<br />
this is the capital of the nation, a capital of which they<br />
may be proud, then more and more will they begin to realise<br />
instinctively that the nation is more important than any<br />
part of it and that the nation is symbolised by the capital<br />
of the nation in this place. In other words thi-I think<br />
is doing a great deal to create a genuine national spirit,<br />
and therefore this lake is good for yoil and me good for<br />
this city, good for Australia good foi, the spirit of the<br />
nation, a spirit that will~ asi beyond any of the prejudices<br />
of today, And so Sir, I am particularly delighted to loo1%<br />
across here and Lo be able to see the two bridges thr-t we~ re<br />
built as one might ray on dry land, because the last thing<br />
I wani to do is to start a controversy bedause controversy<br />
is hostile to my nature ( Laughter), but I venture to say<br />
that those are two of the finest buildings we have in the<br />
Federal. Capital, and I compliment those who were responsible<br />
for them, And from now on here it is, a centre of~<br />
recreation, a lake that will give completeness for example,<br />
to all the scholastic facilities that exist ana will exi~ t<br />
in this city, a lake that will complete the amenities of life<br />
even for the acadumic staffs of the university, who will<br />
be able to go out on the lake in future and forget all<br />
about politics ( Laughter) and have a good time, Rea'lly<br />
there is something here for all of us. All of us. Politicians,<br />
as Doug Anthony has just said, will be able to look at the<br />
lake with a new significance in future, all of us will be<br />
the better for having this lovely centre in this lovely<br />
city. And so, as I think I said at the beginning I<br />
have a great feeling of official privilege, a great leeling<br />
of unfeigned personal delight in declaring this lake to<br />
have been inaugurated by me a quarter of an hour ago, </p>
