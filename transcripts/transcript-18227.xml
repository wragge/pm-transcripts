Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced a new initiative to share Australia's world leading expertise in food production with the people of Africa.</p>
<p>The Government will set up a new Australian International Centre for Food Security to provide valuable agricultural research and advice to African countries in need.</p>
<p>Africa holds 60 per cent of the world's uncultivated farmable land however one in three people still go hungry there every day.</p>
<p>Under-investment in agricultural research and innovation, along with a decline in agricultural productivity, are key factors affecting Africa's ability to bring about food security.</p>
<p>Australia has an important role to play in supporting African countries confronting the challenge of food security.</p>
<p>The new centre will offer greater support to help African countries strengthen their agricultural practices.</p>
<p>Australia has unique agricultural and scientific expertise and world class teaching and research institutions that are well-suited to African agriculture and food security.</p>
<p>This expertise includes dry-land and tropical farming, climate change adaptation, commercialisation of agricultural research and water and soil management.</p>
<p>The new centre will give farmers, government agencies and the private sector access to this expertise and other support from a large network of Australian, African and international research bodies.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will provide more than $36 million to establish the centre which will be led by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR).</p>
<p>The new centre will be set up in Canberra and an office will be established in Africa to provide further support.</p>
<p>As an important first step, the centre will host an international conference, Food Security in Africa: Bridging Research and Practice next year.</p>
<p>The conference will bring together a range of Australian and African research partners, as well as international experts, to identify opportunities for cooperation.</p>
<p>Australia will also support the â€˜Research in Business' program of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa.</p>
<p>This funding, together with the work of the centre, will help put research products into the hands of farmers to improve their productivity.</p>
<p>This package of assistance builds on Australia's existing $100 million initiative that is working with African and Australian partners, including ACIAR and the CSIRO, to improve crop yields, livestock health and rural livelihoods in Africa.</p>
