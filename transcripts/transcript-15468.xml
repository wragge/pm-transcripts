    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government is pleased to announce an increase in funding of $2.7 million over the next four years for the development and distribution of key national parenting information resources, the Raising Children DVD and the Raising Children website.</p>
<p>The Raising Children DVD launched today will be provided free via an Australian Government New Parent Kit to every parent of a newborn for the next two years.  </p>
<p>The DVD will enable those without a computer to access information on everything a parent needs to know about raising a child, from birth through to 5 years of age.</p>
<p>The DVD is a companion product to the Raising Children website, which has been highly successful in providing practical, reliable and user-friendly information for Australian parents of children 0-8 and those that support them.</p>
<p>The website raisingchildren.net.au was launched in May 2006 and is expected to reach its 2 millionth visitor this month.  Today's announcement is in addition to the government's previous $4 million funding commitment for the website, as part of the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy </p>
