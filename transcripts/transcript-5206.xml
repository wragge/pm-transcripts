ADDRESS TO THE ELECTORATE OF WANNON ON BEHALF OF THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER BY THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION, SENATOR CARRICK<br />
The Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, asked me to talk to,.<br />
you about a very important matter the education and<br />
training of our young people for transition from school<br />
work; and about our plans to help those who, through lack ofbasic<br />
skills, are at risk in obtaining employment.<br />
Last Thursday I reported to Parliament on the Government's<br />
reaction to the Williams Committee report. I also described<br />
the details of a comprehensive plan to assist the transition<br />
from school to work of all those with particular needs.<br />
These two initiatives are of great and enduring importance<br />
and interest to all Australians.<br />
The Williams Committee report is the most detailed and<br />
comprehensive examination ever undertaken in this country.<br />
It focusses strongly upon quality. It seeks to upgrade the<br />
quality of delivery of education in schools, colleges and<br />
universities and the need to improve basic skills.<br />
The quantity of education has increased enormously. Many<br />
people question whether that increase in quantity has been<br />
accompanied by a parallel growth in quality and relevance.<br />
The Williams report emphasises sadly that one quarter of<br />
14 year olds were found by sample testing to be incapable<br />
i of independent learning or reading for recreation or / 2 </p>
<p>information. About 20 per cent of 10 year olds and 15 per cent<br />
of 14 year olds needed remedial instruction in number work.<br />
Some one half of all 14 year olds could not write a<br />
satisfactory letter for employment in terms of basic criteria.<br />
Clearly this is not good enough. The government, in<br />
co-operation with the States, will work towards significant<br />
improvements in this vital field.<br />
The Williams report contains 116 recommendations, touching<br />
right at the heart of qualitative improvements in the whole<br />
field of education. The government has adopted almost all<br />
recommendations. Each year about 250,000 young people leave school. Of them<br />
60,000 go into full-time tertiary education. A further<br />
140,000 go into full-time employment, including 40,000<br />
apprentices. The remaining 50,000 are ' at risk'.. They are our immediate<br />
and vital, concern. Evidence shows that very many lack the<br />
skills necessary for employment. Without appropriate<br />
assistance, they will be chronically unemployed.<br />
The Commonwealth government is convinced that much can be<br />
done to assist these young people towards personal fulfilment<br />
and employment. / 3 </p>
<p>Y 3.<br />
We have reached agreement with the States upon a wide range<br />
of initiatives.<br />
The schools will be asked and assisted to identify students<br />
at risk at the earliest possible stage. The intention is<br />
to provide individual counselling, vocational testing,<br />
pastoral care and appropriate courses, including technical<br />
courses. Our aim will be to prove to these young people<br />
that we, the community, are genuinely concerned about them,<br />
that they have potential skills and that school and TAFE<br />
can be meaningful and rewarding to them.<br />
We will seek to reduce the number of unduly early schoolleavers<br />
the 15 year olds who face a 28 per cent chance of<br />
unemployment. We will offer work experience and link courses. We will<br />
extend the range of technical college courses, including<br />
pre-employment, pre-apprenticeship and E. P. U. Y.<br />
Our hope is that the assistance and training will attract<br />
the great majority of-.-juvenile unemployed.<br />
We will not vary the present conditions of unemployment<br />
benefits. / 4 </p>
<p>itÃ¸<br />

This is not an artificial scheme to juggle with these<br />
figures and statistics of juvenile unemployment. It is<br />
a genuine attempt to provide all young people with<br />
employable skills and with a sense of adequacy and<br />
achievement. The personal factors are at least as<br />
important as the vocational.<br />
These programmes should be eagerly welcomed by all<br />
Australians. </p>
