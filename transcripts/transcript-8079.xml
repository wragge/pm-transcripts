a C PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE WITH RADIO JOURNALISTS,<br />
HMAS SUCCESS, 13 AUGUST 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Good morning sir, you've had a chance to go<br />
through and meet some of the crew on all of the ships,<br />
how do you perceive the feeling?<br />
Well I was very impressed in the sense that there was<br />
not, you know, a wild sort of jingoism. There was a very<br />
sober understanding on their part that have got an<br />
important mission, there was an understanding there was<br />
considerable potential risk involved in what they were<br />
about, but overall they were eager to undertake the<br />
mission. I think that they would overwhelmingly welcome<br />
a situation that by the time they got there, there was no<br />
need for their presence and that was a possibility. But<br />
I had the feeling that they are indeed very worthy heirs<br />
of that position to which I referred when addressing<br />
them. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, isn't it yet another case of<br />
sending troops to someone else's war?<br />
PM: How do you mean someone else's war?<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, the Gulf isn't in our sphere of<br />
influence is it?<br />
PM: Well, people were using exactly that sort of<br />
language of appeasement in the 1930s and the world paid a<br />
terrible price for that sort of erroneous analysis.<br />
JOURNALIST: But, Prime Minister, some of the, this is<br />
the 75th anniversary of the Anzac action at Gallipoli and<br />
some of the veterans from that campaign came back this<br />
year and said we should never be involved in someone<br />
else's war overseas.<br />
PM: Well, that's an interesting observation.<br />
JOURNALIST: You must be disappointed at the number of<br />
protesters here today?<br />
PM: There's a very few of them. You think that I should<br />
have expected more you mean?<br />
JOURNALIST: That they were here at all. </p>
<p>0 2<br />
PM: That question would give your listeners the<br />
impression that there was a mass of protesters and you<br />
know there wasn't.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you think you've got<br />
widespread support in the community for this action?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, today the El Telegraph Arab<br />
newspaper did a survey of the Arab community and found<br />
that over 80 percent of Arabs in this country support<br />
Saddam Hussain, that's not widespread support is it?<br />
PM: We've only got an Arab community have we? I mean,<br />
what a ridiculous question. I mean, we've got 17 million<br />
people in this country and you've referred to a<br />
publication which covers at the most 300,000 people<br />
because 80 percent of 300,000 are against it, therefore<br />
the overwhelming majority of Australians are against it.<br />
I mean, grab hold of yourself, boyo.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, will the decision to, say,<br />
escalate any action by Australian forces by the two<br />
frigates that are going there, who'll be taking that, the<br />
decision. Will that be taken in Cabinet, by yourself or<br />
how will that be done?<br />
PM: No, the Cabinet, of course, will be considering this<br />
whole matter and I've made it quite clear that there<br />
would be no escalation beyond the role, primary role, of<br />
enforcing the embargo. If there was any suggestion of an<br />
escalation of that role, that would require a Cabinet<br />
decision. JOURNALIST: will we be sending any further troops to<br />
the Middle East?<br />
PM: We are not sending any troops to the Middle East.<br />
The standard of your questions is remarkable, if I may<br />
say so.<br />
JOURNALIST: I'm just wondering, in itself, this<br />
invasion, I mean, it's obvious why we're going over, but<br />
how does it fit with other things that have been<br />
mentioned like, let's say, the invasion of, or the<br />
Israel, the Six Day War that Israel launched and, you<br />
know, nothing was taken against Israel. No action was<br />
taken by the international community at the time<br />
PM: Do you understand what happened in, what year was<br />
the Six Day War. I'll just test you out.<br />
JOURNALIST: 1967.<br />
PM: ' 67 and what were the circumstances of that? </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Well, I'm just asking you<br />
PM: Well, I'm telling you that there is absolutely no<br />
analogy as was known at the time, that was a pre-emptive<br />
strike that was taken in those circumstances against a<br />
threat that was accumulating for the obliteration of<br />
Israel. And I say that in regard to 1967 and I don't say<br />
that in terms of an exoneration of every Israeli action<br />
that's been taken in the Middle East over the period of<br />
its existence, but you don't pick a very good example<br />
when you refer to 1967.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well pick another analogy, Mr Hawke, the<br />
occupation of East Timor.<br />
PM: I'm sure you can<br />
JOURNALIST: Surely East Timor didn't make a threat to<br />
Indonesia? PM: Well, mate, I'm not here to have an argument with<br />
You. I mean, if you were really interested in asking<br />
objective questions I'd deal with you.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, obviously although the Cabinet's<br />
going to make the decision, you'll have an extremely<br />
important role in the Cabinet. How does it make you feel<br />
personally knowing that the lives of 600 Australians are<br />
going to be, not totally in your control, but obviously<br />
you're going to have a very great influence over how,<br />
what happens to them whilst they're over there?<br />
PM: Well, as I said when announcing this decision, it<br />
was not one that was taken lightly. I put hours of<br />
thought into it, but in the end it was a straightforward<br />
decision. You, the world can't afford a situation where<br />
a country can simply invade and annex a neighbour and<br />
allow that to go unnoticed. I mean, I, it was very<br />
interesting for me, as I said the other day, I've just<br />
recently been reading in great detail the events of the<br />
1930s and when you read what happened in that period, the<br />
crimes of the appeasers were, in a sense, as great as the<br />
crimes of Hitler and the Nazis. We wouldn't have had the<br />
Second World War if there hadn't been appeasers, but..<br />
would appease once or twice, thrice, and the world paid a<br />
very heavy price. So you can't stand idly by and allow<br />
those things to happen.<br />
ends </p>
