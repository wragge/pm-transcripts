27 October 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HION JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
RADIO INTERVIEW WITH MATT PEACOCK<br />
AM PROGRAMME, ABC RADIO<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
ANNOUNCER: In Scotland today our Prime Minister is elated over his victory at the Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government meeting in resisting a push to set uniform greenhouse gas<br />
emission targets. Mr Howard today attended a retreat with the other Commonwealth<br />
leaders away from the prying eyes of the media at the golfing resort of St. Andrews.<br />
Matt Peacock prepared this report for AM,<br />
JOURNALIST: Finally John Howard is having fuzn and he could scarcely contain his good humour as<br />
he strolled over the world's oldest golf course with his wife Janette at the CHOGM<br />
retreat in the picturesque St. Andrews. It is here that the leaders came by train in their<br />
luxury Pullman coaches to fraternise, play tennis and finalise their position on Nigeria,<br />
who remains suspended but not expelled from the Commonwealth for another year.<br />
They could even attend a pre-lunch presentation by the Scotch Malt Whisky Society<br />
with practical as well as theoretical application on how to enjoy a really good malt. So<br />
did Mr Howard taste or sniff.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The Prime Minister should never confess to sniffing anythin8. You know, I look but I<br />
don't sniff </p>

OCT 27 ' 97 08: 40 P. 12<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard has every reason to be pleased he has just been chatting with Nelson<br />
Mandela, the unrivalled celebrity at this conference who has risked the wrath of the<br />
United States and Britain by urging a trial outside Scotland for the Libyan Lockerby<br />
bombing suspects. The South African President even offered to mediate on native title<br />
between Aboriginal Australian and the Federal Government, an offer that was quickly<br />
rejected. But Mr Howard says he has accepted an invitation to visit South Africa. It is<br />
on greenhouse, though, that Australian diplomacy has been victorious with its efforts<br />
over the past few days reversing a strong push by Europe and British Prime Minister<br />
Tony Blair to set specific gas emission reduction targets for Kyoto. The final text was<br />
not specific at all, Mr Howard smugly observed. But even better for the Government<br />
it includes those magic words, " differentiated responsibilities" and a commitment for<br />
all countries to pull their weight. This is just what Australia wanted and camne about<br />
with the help of Canada and interestingly, developing countries like India-<br />
] PRIE M[ NISTER:<br />
And you have now got a position where the Europeans are saying this, the Japanese<br />
are saying this and the Americans are saying this and we are saying something else. I<br />
think what you have got is a situation where if the goal of action is to be achieved then<br />
you have to allow for differences in opinion between different countries.<br />
JOURNALIST: And how supportive will the fact that CHOGM is now mentioning differentiation be in<br />
Kyoto? ] PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Very good Matt. Because what it does is represents an expression of view of a whole<br />
variety countries, big countries, industrialised countries, developing countries with big<br />
populations. JOURNALIST: Like India?<br />
PlUME MINISTER:<br />
Yes. Very small countries with small populations. So it is encouraging. I don't want<br />
to overstate it, I never do in these things. But certainly all the talk about stand off's and<br />
this and that haven't mnaterialised.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think that the fact that the Europeans, the Germans, for example, have been so<br />
hostile to President Clinton's announcement of last week may have the effect of<br />
helping Australia's cause too? </p>

OCT 27 ' 97 08: 41 P. 13<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It wasn't very clever of them being so hostile to the Americans.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about President Mandela, did you discuss the Wik offer that he made any<br />
further? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No that didn't come up.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Mrs Howard, how are you finding the trip so far?<br />
MRS HOWARD<br />
It has been very interesting, it really has. I think the most important thing has been to<br />
meet the other leaders and to develop a personal relationship with some of them. And<br />
it doesn't really quite matter where you are when you are doing that. Except it is very<br />
nice to be in Edinburgh. I2ha dn't been here before and it is very interesting.<br />
JOURNALIST: And what have you both been doing today?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
What do you mean?<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
No more resigning Ministers on this trip, the name Cheryl Kernot hasn't even been<br />
mentioned, although the Prime Minister has finally conceded that his policy on aged<br />
care homes will need some changes, but he says only small ones.<br />
PRIE MINISTER<br />
It will be fine tuning but the principles of the policy are going to remain because the<br />
principle is very sound. And that is that where people can afford to make a<br />
contribution to their own care they should be asked to do so. That is part of the<br />
principle of mutual obligation. We are not asking people who can't afford to do so to<br />
contribute to their care, we will look after them. We will provide a helping hand to<br />
people who don't have the resources to care for themselves in their old age. But<br />
people who do have the resources, there is nothing wrong, and I don't for a moment<br />
retreat from saying that if you can afford to make a contribution to your care itis only </p>

reasonable that you do so and not ask the general body of taxpayers to pick up the bill.<br />
Now there is nothing wrong or un-Australian or unfair about that, it is a perfectly<br />
sound principle.<br />
JOURNALIST: Tomorrow the CHOGM conference winds up and the Prime Minister heads for<br />
Indonesia where he will be discussing trade, the currency crisis and, of course<br />
greenhouse with President Soeharto.<br />
