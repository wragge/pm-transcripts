<p>  But I would want to salute the people of Shepparton and the people of the</p>
<p>   Goulbourn Valley on the tremendous contribution that they are making to</p>
<p>   the economy of Australia. In many ways this is the food basket of Australia</p>
<p>   and there is around something like 80 000 Australians employed directly</p>
<p>   in the horticultural industry in this country. It is winning new domestic</p>
<p>   and international markets. Only a few weeks ago I was in Japan and I spoke</p>
<p>   of the way in which for the first time we have been able to get fuji apples</p>
<p>   into Japan. It was a pretty hard fight I can tell you, but in the end we</p>
<p>   were successful. The first exports are largely going to come from Tasmania</p>
<p>   but there is no reason why exports shouldn't spread from other parts of</p>
<p>   Australia but it is an illustration of the sort of things that Australia</p>
<p>   must increasingly do in the future. Now these enterprises are normally the</p>
<p>   product of tremendous skill and dedication and hard work often based on</p>
<p>   a family enterprise and Santo, you and your family are illustrations of</p>
<p>   that because you built a tremendous business through the dint of hard work</p>
<p>   and the dint of application to a very very difficult task and you played</p>
<p>   a very significant role as well in the Australian community as a result.</p>
<p>  But I also want to say that not only have I had the experience this morning</p>
<p>   of talking to and being informed by such a successful operator in the horticultural</p>
<p>   industry. I have also had the chance this morning to learn something about</p>
<p>   cutting edge youth services. To be told that this great private programme</p>
<p>   that takes government services to young people directly to those young people.</p>
<p>   I was very impressed with what Rowena and the people from Centrelink told</p>
<p>   me about the Project. I want to congratulate the Uniting Church, I also</p>
<p>   want to thank the offices of Centrelink and I want to commend to the business</p>
<p>   men and women of this and other communities in rural and regional Australia</p>
<p>   the desirability of supporting projects like that, there is no reason why</p>
<p>   there can't be some commercial association with pluses like that, if you</p>
<p>   can have the Uniting Church logo on it, if you can have the Centrelink logo</p>
<p>   on it, there is no reason why you can't have the logo of some kind of business</p>
<p>   organisation on it because what that does, what that service does it to</p>
<p>   take facilities and services directly to young people, particularly in areas</p>
<p>   where they may not be available in a building. But ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>   this is not an occasion for long speeches it is an occasion to say thank</p>
<p>   you to people like Santo for the contribution that they are making to the</p>
<p>   Australian economy and the contribution that they are making to their local</p>
<p>   community, the example they set to other small business men and women around</p>
<p>   Australia and most importantly the example they set of successful family</p>
<p>   enterprises and I want to thank the children of the local school for the</p>
<p>   wonderful welcome that I received this morning. It is always the most enjoyable</p>
<p>   part of a visit to any part of Australia to be welcomed by the children</p>
<p>   of the local community and this morning has been no exception and can I</p>
<p>   say again how delighted I am to be here in Shepparton to be sharing the</p>
<p>   platform with my colleague and friend Sharman Stone, who is doing an absolutely</p>
<p>   remarkable job, a very energetic job, a very important job and can I say</p>
<p>   a very pugnacious job when the occasion arises in representing the interests</p>
<p>   of the Murray electorate and the people of Shepparton in the national Parliament.</p>
<p>  ends</p>
