<p>3.<br />
P. M, Well, they might. but I think that the rucial point will<br />
be Paris and on'that I don't think there's any doubt that<br />
General de Gaulle didn't look with any great favour on the<br />
British coming in, He has his own ideas about the<br />
position of France in Europe, particularly so long as he<br />
has close association with Adenauer. My impression this<br />
time was that although nobody could say that de Gaulle was<br />
in favour of Great Britain going in, I don't think he is<br />
so utterly hostile to it as he was perhaps a year ago,<br />
In oti-er wo'e 1' Ihe'b a. fy , ben j<br />
it's a movement in favour of them receiving Great Britain,<br />
Qo Well, now, if that is one strong force at the bargaining<br />
table, the American attitude is another one. How precisely<br />
would you measure the American feeling about Britain going<br />
into the European Common Market. I have seen only recently<br />
a report which quoted the " highest authority" that the<br />
Americans would regard it as catastrophic if Britain didn't<br />
go in.<br />
P. M. Well, I don't want to engage in superlatives, but I came out<br />
of Jashington, after very close discussions with the<br />
President and a variety of the members of the Administration,<br />
quite satisfied that they were very, very keen on Great<br />
Britain going in. Indeed, I rather used this myself in<br />
my discussions with them because I said " Nw, if they're<br />
keen on Great Britain going in, they are not without<br />
influence in Europe itself; if the British difficulty<br />
about going in and appuaring to desert the Commonwealth<br />
economic interests becomes manifest, then my card of<br />
entry with the Americans is to say, " Look, don't make it<br />
too hard. Don't make it so hard for Great Britain to<br />
go in that she has to make this horrible choice between<br />
Europe and the Commonwealth, because this would be, in<br />
itself, a catastrophe. I think they understand that very<br />
well and, therefore, I would describe their attitude, as<br />
I found it, and after the discussions that we had, as being<br />
one of great keenness for Great Britain to go in, of<br />
knowledge that there's a limit to the price that she can<br />
pay of an understanding that the Commonwealth does matter<br />
to Great Britain and to the world and that, therefore, the<br />
American approach must be one, not of dogma, but of<br />
practical accommodation. Indeed, both the President<br />
and the people in his Administration repeatedly said to<br />
me " Our approach to this is quite pragmatic, it is not<br />
do g-atic."<br />
Qo Did you get the fooeeling that the Aerican attitude was so<br />
strong that it would carry the day inevitably in Europe<br />
for British entry?<br />
P. M. ' Jell, I wouldn't be prepared to put it as high as that,<br />
but I do believe that the American influence in Europe on<br />
this matter will be considerable, and that, of course,<br />
particularly has relation to France<br />
Q. Sir, there seem to be two developing attitudes about the<br />
nature of the European Common Market should it come to<br />
pass. One is that it is an exclusive community which<br />
looks inward upon itself and that the Common Market<br />
countries the United States of Europe are selfsufficient,<br />
or that it should be an expanding community<br />
with interests donm as far as this part of the world,<br />
Which do you think is uppurrnost? cc a a o </p>
<p>P. M. Well, I wish I knew the anser to that. The great<br />
danger about the European Economic Community is that the<br />
countries in it may become inward-looking, They may<br />
become full of ideas of economic self-sufficiency.<br />
They may say, " Well, now, the day will be a happy day<br />
w. hen the new European Community, including Great Britain,<br />
doesn't import wheat, but gets it all from within."<br />
The French are, today, wheat exporters. Then they may<br />
say, " Well, why should we be dependent on the rest of the<br />
world for canned fruits, for dried fruits we can produce<br />
them all ourselves for butter 0. Run right down<br />
through the listo That is, theoretically, a danger,<br />
And it may be, that for a while, that will be their<br />
tendency, their temptation, but in the long run I think<br />
that we have to remember that one of their great ends is<br />
so to increase their industrial power tLeir capacity to<br />
make and to sell to other people, thai they are not so<br />
foolish as not to realise that they can't sell without<br />
buying. And, therefore, in the long run, if they avoid<br />
ultra-nationalistic self-sufficient economic policies,<br />
we may hope that their activity with the rest of the world<br />
will correspond to an activity on the part of the rest of<br />
the world with them,<br />
Q. I wonder can I press you a little bit. You said you<br />
weren't quite sure which idea was uppermost in Europe at<br />
the moment. Have you, as a last word, any real feelings<br />
about which idea is the prevalent one at the moment?<br />
P. M, Well, I would think, myself, that they were at present<br />
rather on the self-sufficiency line,<br />
Qd Which is not good for us?<br />
P. M. Uhich is not good for us. and what we have to do is to<br />
break that dowm, to make them more and more conscious of<br />
the fact that if the rest of the world doesn't have a<br />
market in their countries, then they cant have a market<br />
in the long run in the rest of the world.<br />
Qo Is it this to which you devoted the greater part of your<br />
energies when you were in London?<br />
PM, And a great deal of time in the United States itselfe<br />
Very interesting on that mattier The Americans, they're<br />
very big and we are relatively small, but one thing that<br />
I kept coming back to or that they kept coming back to,<br />
in my talks with them was " Look if Great Britain goes<br />
into the Common Market, you, Aus ralia, and, we, America,<br />
are both outside of it, and we therefore have a tromondous<br />
common interest in getting the best possible access to that<br />
Market for our own goods. If they become illiberal in<br />
their economic policies, that's bal for both of us, Then<br />
the joint coummuniqueo with President Kennedy here it<br />
was WJe both indicated that we had this in common. We<br />
hope they will have liberal policies, and we hope that<br />
there will be increasing access for our goods into that<br />
Market, That, I thought, was a good start.<br />
Q, Now, Sir, the bargaining on behalf of the Commnonwalth has<br />
been done at the moment by Bri. tain for the Commonwealth<br />
countries in Europeo Mro Macmillan's position is somewhat<br />
loss secure, one would have thought, losing by-elections<br />
as he is, fairly frequently. Do you feel that this may<br />
have, or did it have any offect on his powers to bargain<br />
adequately at Brussels? C 0 0 C 0 0 0 Cl'<br />
L </p>
<p>P. M, I don't think so. It is in the nature of things that<br />
governments lose by-elections without necessarily losing<br />
a seat, but it is a very rare event when a government will<br />
increase a majority at a by-election, because at by-elections<br />
people are able to chide the government without throwing<br />
it out. We are very familiar with that. INow, I think<br />
he will go ahead. He has a large majority. He is the<br />
master of the timetable. He's not due to have an election,<br />
if he doesn't want one, before the second half of 1964.<br />
No, I think he'll go ahead and negotiate.<br />
Q. With a freshening opposition in Britain to British entry<br />
and negotiations for comparable outlets on behalf of the<br />
Commonwealth taking place now not making as much progress<br />
as I understand would have helped you, wouldn't you agree<br />
that this may be a factor that the people in Brussels'<br />
attitude might harden because of the British Prime<br />
Minister's position at home?<br />
P. M. I don't think so, myself, because I don't think that<br />
anybody could answer dogmatically as to what the Prime<br />
Minister's opponents would do. I don't moan his critics in<br />
the Conservative Party but his political opponents, the<br />
Labor Party. I don't think anybody in Europe could say,<br />
" Jell, we could do a better deal with them, than we can<br />
with Macmillan," because I don't think they can take an<br />
easy position, either of them,<br />
Qo Mr, Prime Minister, Sir, I wonder if I can put this to<br />
you now, Supposing it comes to the worst, supposing<br />
this country gets nothing but transitional agreements,<br />
suppose comparable outlets cannot be negotiated, what do<br />
we do?<br />
PoMo eall, it divides itself into two parts. First of all, if<br />
that turned out to be the position and we had, in September,<br />
the Prime Minister's Conferjnce, I think this would be<br />
very badly received by the Commonwealth Prime Ministers,<br />
I don't see how it could be avoided. ' Je have our problems,<br />
but you take Now Zealand New Zealand's problems, depending<br />
so enormously on the products of farms, would be almost<br />
intolorable, and I am perfectly certain that there would<br />
be tremendous opposition on the part of the Commonwealth<br />
countries. And if it turned out that the Commonwealth<br />
countries all being confronted by an end of the present<br />
pattern of Commonwealth trade by 1970, said, " We don't<br />
approve, we disagree. Te disagree violently." Then, I<br />
for one doubt very much whether a government of any party<br />
in Great Britain would go in. But if a government of<br />
whatever party in Great Britain went in, then I think there<br />
would be a heavy blow dealt to the Commonwealth association,<br />
and I think that so far as we are concerned, and other<br />
Comnonwealth countries are concerned, we should have to<br />
engage then in salvage operations. We, ourselves, would<br />
have to devote our time, between now and 1970, to determining<br />
what we can do to develop unexpected i. arkets for certain<br />
commodities, what financial arrangenants we could make to<br />
support the variety of interests. We are not going to<br />
wander away from these industries. No industry like<br />
dried fruit or canned fruit need suppose for one moment<br />
that we are just going to dump it under those circumstances,<br />
but the problne of how to support it will be, of course, a<br />
very acute one. Je don't want to get to that problem if<br />
we can help it.<br />
Q. I was just wondering0 Obviously, I imagine, you have<br />
second lines of defence to fal l back cn, You must have<br />
given some thought to this to a policy should this come<br />
to pass? o o0 3 o/ 6 </p>
<p>P. M. That's right. But it's not orthodox practice to publish<br />
your second lines of defence.<br />
Q. There's been a lot of speculation that Japan might, in<br />
such an instance, become almost a second Britain to this<br />
country, and that you are busy now developing, on behalf<br />
of this country, greatly increased trade relations.<br />
PoM. We have been developing our trade relations with Japan,<br />
After all, Japan, last year, was our biggest wool-buyer,<br />
and Japan increasingly takes commodities from us, and<br />
we from Japan. But there's no doubt about it that if<br />
the old channels of trade begin to dry up, as they will<br />
under this 1970 idea, then we must more and more not<br />
hesitate to open up new channels of trade. If this means<br />
that we'll do more business with countries with which we<br />
now may have some reluctance to do business, well it will<br />
mean that, because after all, the first duty of the<br />
government of Australia is to the people of Australia and<br />
to the industries of Australia.<br />
Qo What would you say to those who perhaps see something<br />
like realism in this: that when it comes to the fortunes<br />
of 50 or 60 million people in Britain and perhaps the<br />
fortunes of the whole of Europe, the fortunes of 10 million<br />
Australians and 2 or 3 million Now Zcalanders are not<br />
going to count for very much real. y?<br />
P. M. Well, in a sense, that's intelligible, but don't forget<br />
this: that the fortunes of the 50 million people in<br />
Great Britain have boon very largely tied up with the<br />
fortunes of a relative handful of people in Australia or<br />
Now Zealand because, until the last couple of years, for<br />
example, we in Australia, 10 millions as we may be, have<br />
been the biggest customer of British goods in the world,<br />
You could literally say that there are scores and scores<br />
and scores of thousands of people working in factories<br />
in Great Britain whowouldn't be working there but for<br />
what Australia buys. These are very important factors.<br />
Indeed, I pointed out when I was in London that the<br />
Ai; erican market which happens at the moment to be the<br />
biggest; all that's very satisfactory but if you<br />
compared that market in actual terms, not per thousand of<br />
people, but in actual terms, with the British market in<br />
Australia, over the last thirty or forty years when we've<br />
had this special preferential structure, Australia has<br />
bought from Great Britain, in actual terms, œ 800M more<br />
of goods than the Tnited States of Amnricao<br />
QO But the pattern of trade with Britain has changed, and is<br />
changing constantly, isn't it?<br />
P. M. Yes, but not all that materially. We still remain the<br />
second greatest customer. She remains our largest<br />
customer, overall. There is a mutuality about these<br />
things the preferences given to British trade passing<br />
into Australia and our preferences in the British market,<br />
and I don't think the people of Great Britain will ignore<br />
this. They don't want to ignore it. There are still<br />
many, many thousands or millions of people in Great<br />
Britain who are conscious of the Commonwealth.<br />
QO On the other hand, again, there are those who would say that<br />
the realities of this are bargaining powers. Much as<br />
you talk, you still come down to bargaining. How big a<br />
bargaining power are British preferences which this country<br />
has in its possession nolw? 0 0 a 0 7 </p>
<p>PM! o Well, they are a bargaining point. How big they are<br />
depends entirely This is rather a psychological problem.<br />
If the negotiators in Great Britain feel that their advantages<br />
in going into Europe economically are so great that<br />
they will outweigh any losses that they might incur elsewhere,<br />
then they will go in, and when you come to discuss<br />
these economic problems, I find the greatest difficulty<br />
in getting any two people to agree. I spoke to one or<br />
two of the most prominent men in Great Britain, actively<br />
engaged whose attitude was, "' Jell, the economic argument<br />
is .0/ 56" and that's why I believe first, that the British<br />
negotiators, Mr. Heath, in particular, who is a very able<br />
man I had known all the others over many years, but<br />
hadn't known him, really, before and I think he's doing<br />
his best on this matter. He will want to achieve a result,<br />
but I don't think that he will want to report to his Prime<br />
Minister that the best deal that can be presented to the<br />
Prime Ministers in September is one under which the existing<br />
Commonwealth pattern of trade disappears in 1970.<br />
Qo Now, have you given any thought, sir, to this whole idea<br />
of customs unions which seem to be fashionable now and,<br />
again, people are talking about a customs union, a much<br />
closer association between Australia and New Zealand.<br />
Have you any comment on that?<br />
P. M. e0ll, I quite agree with you that customs unions are<br />
fashionable. It's occasionally overlooked that the<br />
United States itself is a customs union, and so are we,<br />
in the Commonealth( of Australia) as we have complete<br />
internal free trade and a common external tariff, The<br />
problem of developing some such thing with Now Zealand<br />
will become really quite an interesting one if it turns<br />
out that our present positions in the British market fade<br />
out by 1970, which assumes that that's the best term that<br />
can be got and that the British Government agrees with it.<br />
Then it would become a practical probljm. But, really,<br />
I would hope to be delivered of having to solve it. You<br />
seo, in the ultimate, we say, " Jell, let's have a common<br />
external tariff. We will form a customs union." That<br />
connotes internal free trade. And that moans Now Zealand<br />
butter passing without duty into Australia Well, I think<br />
the dairying industry in Australia might have something<br />
to say about that. And so on.<br />
qo This raises many other things. The pressures that are<br />
bound to fall upon this country must get greater, I imagine<br />
you would agree with that. Do you envisage a more planned<br />
economy, a more directed economy for this country over the<br />
next few years?<br />
P. M, The word " planning", of course, is a rude word. You know<br />
wh-at mean. There are those who dogmatically are for it,<br />
as such, and against as such, but if the word " planning"<br />
meant that we must increasingly, and particularly with<br />
those possible economic difficulties that we must<br />
increasingly try to determine in Australia what our rate<br />
of population growth ought to be, what degree of expansion of<br />
secondary industry so vital to population growth ought to be,<br />
what the uosition of the primary industries ought to be, in<br />
terms of production and nmrket, what the tertiary industries<br />
ought to be. not laying it down in some'theoretical ' dog r,<br />
but trying to work out, in terms of expansion and growth,<br />
what the best. rate of expansion and growth would -be'-in each<br />
of these sectcrs and then sit down to say " iJhat ought . re.<br />
to do to bring t-ot about?" if you'mean that by planning,<br />
then you can put me down as a planner. 0. 0/ 8 </p>
<p>One final word, sir, and I think we will have to be quick.<br />
Some of your comments in 3ritain that this country was<br />
British to the bootheels, that we ate the Queen's men in<br />
Australia have drawn a lot of comment. The " Observer" in<br />
London said that you were a brilliant and eloquent advocate<br />
of something which was dead and gone forever. I wonder if<br />
you wouldn't agree that perhaps now Australians are<br />
particularly feeling their isolation, geographical and<br />
otherwise. What would you say to reassure them, those who<br />
feel like this, that they are not right?<br />
P. M. Well, I didn't have the advantage of reading any of these<br />
comments, but you see, like you, I happen to be a subject,<br />
and a very happy one, of the Queen. I am a royalist, I<br />
am a monarchist, we all are in Australia.<br />
Q. Do you think that some of our post-war migrants are?<br />
P. M. Well, if they're not, I am sure their sons will be and<br />
their daughters will be. Thatts what i mean by being<br />
British. W e are within the allegiance, we are British,<br />
in my case and yours, to the bootheels, and in the case<br />
of some people perhaps, as you suggest, to their children's<br />
bootheels. This is, to me, a tremendously important<br />
thing. It means that we will not get into a state of<br />
economic strife a3 hastily as wo otherwise would. It<br />
means that we have our instincts, our allegiance and<br />
deepest feelings in common, and if that's a dead cause,<br />
in the eyes of the London " Observer", then i am happy to<br />
say that the " Observer" doesn't represent my opinion or<br />
the opinion of most people in Australia. </p>
