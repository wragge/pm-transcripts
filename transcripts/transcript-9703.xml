TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH ELLEN FANNING, " AM PROGRAM", ABC RADIO,<br />
14 AUGUST 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
EF: Prime Minister, thanks for joining the AM Program this morning.<br />
PM: It is a pleasure, Ellen.<br />
EF: What is the significance, in your view, of the celebrations for the<br />
nation and especially for those Australians who, like you, grew up<br />
after the Second World War?<br />
PM: Oh, well I think what we are doing is celebrating the spirit of the<br />
generation as we are celebrating the fact that this generation of<br />
Australians gave us our peace and our freedom. They fought the war<br />
and they saved Australia. That is why we are remembering it. That<br />
is why we commemorate these events.<br />
EF: And, indeed, over the next few days the focus will be on that<br />
remembrance and on that idea of commemoration, but what do those<br />
events of 50 years ago really tell us about the present and perhaps<br />
about the future?<br />
PM: Oh, I think they tell us that the people who fought that war were proud<br />
of what was built here. That they loved Australia and they were<br />
prepared to fight for its values and to maintain it and I think that is the<br />
lesson for this generation of Australians that we can, in fact, very<br />
much take the cue from them. They gave us an example to live by<br />
and I think understanding that is to understand some of the lessons<br />
and the other thing is the great loss and suffering has to mean<br />
something it has to mean something. It can't just happen and with<br />
the effluxion of time be forgotten and while it isn't in Australia, we<br />
tend not to forget each Anzac Day. To remember indeed this 50 year<br />
commemoration has brought poignantly back the events that<br />
happened then to perhaps a much more innocent generation of </p>
<p>Australians than we are ourselves today. That they had to cope with<br />
it and that they did.<br />
EF Well 50 years on, the anniversary does provide another opportunity<br />
for Japan, looking at the other side, to put the war behind it. In your<br />
view, has Japan been able to seize on that opportunity this year?<br />
PM: I think Japan will only seize on the opportunity when the Japanese<br />
people face up to it.<br />
EF And have they done that this year?<br />
PM: It is not a matter of doing it this year. It has to be done over time.<br />
Their children have to learn about it. The history has to be taught.<br />
I think that is the point. I think many people would believe that, for<br />
instance, the German nation have been more prepared to talk about<br />
the history, than has the Japanese nation. As that happens, and I<br />
have got no doubt that it will, as those lessons are understood, well<br />
then I think many people, including many Australians, will feel that<br />
that is as it should be.<br />
EF Well that isn't taught in schools in Japan at the moment and many did<br />
point to this year as a milestone for Japan to begin to come to terms<br />
with it, to put the war behind it. Do you think Japan has in that<br />
context really seized on that opportunity?<br />
PM: Well I am quite sure that the 50 years are bringing up Nagasaki and<br />
Hiroshima for a lot of Japanese, brings home the message that they<br />
were the victims. Where, in fact, they were the perpetrators of the<br />
offence and that will only come with the history and over time. So I<br />
don't necessarily think this was the year when the Japanese nation<br />
said to themselves, or itself, that they had committed offences against<br />
the community of nations and, in a sense, were seeking to<br />
acknowledge that. I think with the bombing of Japan at the end of the<br />
war a carpet bombing and the fire bombing and then, of course, the<br />
two atomic blasts. Much of the focus will be, no doubt it has been, on<br />
those. But I think like all great truths, these things will dawn on their<br />
younger generation as certainly as you and I are speaking here.<br />
EF: Well the Japanese Prime Minister talks on Tuesday. That is exactly<br />
years since the end the war. What do you want to hear from<br />
Mr Murayama during that speech?<br />
PM: I think an acknowledgment of the fact that these militarist policies<br />
were pursued to great cost and detriment to the community of nations<br />
around Japan and an expression of regret on his behalf on behalf of<br />
his nation. But I think I would also like to hear a commitment from<br />
him to tell this generation of Japanese people the full truth, the full<br />
history, of what happened. </p>
<p>EF: You use the word regret there. There is often great debate about the<br />
use of words in this particular debate. Is regret enough, is an<br />
apology necessary?<br />
PM: Welt I don't think the apology means anything without the truthfulness<br />
being shown. That is I don't think the apology necessarily matters<br />
without the nation of Japan knowing what happened and knowing that<br />
a bad thing was done and that this history shouldn't repeat itself. I<br />
mean that is, I think, what we want. I think the easiest thing to give is<br />
the apology.<br />
EF That is the easy way out.<br />
PM: Well certainly the easiest thing, yes.<br />
F: There had been an anticipation here in Australia that in some<br />
quarters, at least, some people would indulge in anti-Japanese<br />
sentiment at that time. What do you think it says about Australians<br />
that, by and large, they haven't done that?<br />
PM: Well I think Australia has a very great and deep sense of democracy.<br />
That is where our tolerance and sense of freedom comes from. That<br />
is why multicultural ism, I think, has worked in Australia. Why we are<br />
tolerant to people who are not of anglo-saxon origins and descent.<br />
How we have made this change in Australia work and those same<br />
sentiments, I think, tend to also accommodate attitudes towards the<br />
Japanese for that history.<br />
F: How aware do you think Australians are 50 years on that Japan today<br />
really underpins Australia's standard of living and Australia's<br />
economy? Is there a general acceptance of that, an understanding of<br />
that?<br />
PM: I think there probably is to some extent. But it goes beyond the<br />
economic point. It is true that Japan is our largest trading partner.<br />
But the greater imperative is for Australians to come to terms with the<br />
region, not simply to come to terms with Japan.<br />
F: Well still on the economy if we could, voters are insecure here in<br />
Australia about their economic future. Is it now becoming clear, do<br />
you think, that your Government is delivering them a style of<br />
economic recovery that they just don't like and they are not going to<br />
vote for?<br />
PM: Oh, no, on the contrary. I think this Government is giving them<br />
something that nearly a generation hasn't had.<br />
F: But the private opinion polling does say.. </p>
<p>PM: Well you asked the question, let me give you the answer. That is,<br />
this is not a boom, this is a low inflation recovery. There is a very<br />
great difference. Australia has always had booms and it has had<br />
busts. People are looking for the boom to see their asset prices rise<br />
and then they are hoping to be able to position themselves for the<br />
bust. This time it is not going to happen. We are not going to have<br />
the boom. We are going to have solid, low inflationary growth,<br />
accompanied so far by huge employment growth 670,000 jobs since<br />
the last election. And I think it takes a bit of getting used to. I think it<br />
takes a while for Australians to understand that, you know, house<br />
prices won't be rising 10 per cent a year. Wages won't be rising<br />
per cent or 8 per cent a year. But they will still have a more<br />
secure future and a better standard of living. I think that is what we<br />
are living with now. We are living with something that should have<br />
always been in these years, that is where we did have, if you like,<br />
much stronger growth on a sustainable basis.<br />
EF: You are saying that that will take a while for Australians to<br />
understand. Is it possible then that the political cost to this low<br />
inflation recovery, that you have put in place, could be a defeat for<br />
Labor at the next Federal election, if that understanding is not gained<br />
in time?<br />
PM: Well I mean governments can be defeated at all elections. But I<br />
mean at the last election, what was the principal undertaking I made?<br />
It was to restore growth and employment and we hoped we would get<br />
to 500,000 jobs in three years. Our opponents said we were pulling<br />
everybody's leg. In fact, we have got to 670,000 in two-thirds of the<br />
time. That is well let me put it to you this way. It took us 200 years<br />
to get to 6 million in the labour force by the early 1980s. We are now<br />
at 8 million and we have added 10 per cent of that figure, that is the<br />
6 million, in 2 1/ 2 years. So in terms of the principal commitment that<br />
I gave not to leave the unemployed behind, to restore the economy<br />
to growth and we have had 4, 5 and 6 per cent growth through this<br />
period and now back to a more sustainable level the Government<br />
has honoured those commitments, the hardest commitments of all.<br />
Strong growth, strong employment growth and low inflation. So on<br />
what basis, therefore, would you believe that the Government might<br />
be defeated.<br />
EF: Just finally, very briefly if we could Prime Minister, today the<br />
High Court is expected to hand down its ruling on<br />
Carmen Lawrence's application for an injunction in relation to the<br />
Easton Royal Commission. Now against that background, there is a<br />
perception that support from within the Government, and indeed from<br />
yourself, for Carmen Lawrence could be dwindling, Is that the case?<br />
PM: That is completely untrue. I noticed I got asked some questions the<br />
other day, after I was asked about Martin Ferguson and I am quite<br />
happy to say that in that context, we have seen Martin's selection for </p>
<p>Batman now on an unopposed basis, which shows that at least the<br />
Federal Labor Party, the national organisation of the Labor Party,<br />
works unlike our opponents. But at the same doorstop, I was asked<br />
about Carmen Lawrence, a series of questions, and I said look<br />
Carmen will have her day to put her view. That shouldn't have been<br />
taken by anybody as any diminution of my support for her. I mean<br />
what is happening here is a very nasty thing. You have got the<br />
Government of Western Australia, through the machinery of a<br />
Royal Commission, extending its arm back into the business of the<br />
former Government. Let me give you the example. What would<br />
people think if in 1983, Bob Hawke and I had a Royal Commission<br />
which went into why John Howard allowed the criminal tax avoidance<br />
industry to flourish for seven years? Why he ignored the telephone<br />
book of letters from the then Commissioner of Taxation, Bill O'Reilly?<br />
How would the Liberals have felt if we had of asked Mr O'Reilly to<br />
appear in a Royal Commission to say what did he say to the<br />
Treasurer, Mr Howard, on that particular day, what Mr Howard said in<br />
Cabinet meetings, what Mr Howard said to the former Prime Minister<br />
and what did he say in return? You would hear the cries and the<br />
wails going up, you know the hand wringing in the Conservative<br />
journals and the editorials. But this is a very nasty extension of the<br />
executive against a Member of Parliament and that is why the<br />
Commonwealth Government is supporting Carmen Lawrence in her<br />
High Court action.<br />
EF: Prime Minister, thank you.<br />
PM: Thank you indeed.<br />
