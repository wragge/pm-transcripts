January 1973<br />
F-LIM Mld COLLEC0TION OF LIC2MOGD2TPH7S<br />
The Prime inister today announced that the hustralian<br />
Government had acquired for the future Australian National Gallery<br />
one of the richest private collections of lithographs ever assembled.<br />
The collection is that of 1ir. Felix Man, one of the<br />
pioneers of modern photo-journalism, who first became interestod in<br />
lithography in the early 1930' s and began putting together and<br />
documenting his now famous collection.<br />
Tho purchase price of the collection was 165,000 pounds<br />
sterling (' 330,000). Items in the collection date from the beginings of<br />
lithography and many are either unique or extremely rare. It is<br />
believed that for quality and doA. th the collection has few rivals.<br />
Its acquisition will place the Australian Nactional Gallery among the<br />
leading centres of the world for the study of the history and<br />
deovelopment of this art form.<br />
Felix Man, well-known as a pioneer of photo-journalism,<br />
and from 1930 to 1945 chief photorapher of Picture Post, began to<br />
assemble in the 1930' s what is now probably the best known and most<br />
extensive private collection of lithographs in the world. Mr. Man is<br />
now 81. He is an acknowledged authority on the medium and has k1nown<br />
personally many of the great artists of our time who have used<br />
lithographic techniques. It has been long his wish to see the<br />
collection housed intact in a major museunm.<br />
, t::-ensive inquiries were made by tile Commonwealth Art<br />
Advisory Doard before the decision to nurchase irwas taken. The<br />
Director of the Hational Gallery, 1r. Ja mes iollison, and a member<br />
of the Board, Mr. Fred illiams, visited Euro-e last November to<br />
examine the collection in detail and personally asseoss its importance.<br />
The collection constitutes a unique survey of the work of<br />
the many artists who have made significant use of lithography. It<br />
contains rarities which even great museums, such as the Dritish<br />
Museums and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Now 7ork, do not own.<br />
7hile other museums undoubtedly have fine collections of lithographs,<br />
it is believed that few would rival or surpass the Man collection<br />
in depth. ith the documentation accompanyin the collection, the<br />
Australian 4ational Gallery is oll-placed to become one of the<br />
leading world centres for the study of lithography.<br />
