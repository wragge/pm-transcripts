SPEECH By THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF THE COIOIONWEALTH/ STATE<br />
TASK FORCE ON TASMANIA<br />
HOBART 19 NOVEMBER 1989<br />
L am delighted to be here in Tasmania this morning on a very<br />
special occasion that marks a new era of co-operatian and<br />
gor'dwill between my Government aad the Gove. rnment of<br />
Tasmania. when Premier Michael Field announced earlier this year that<br />
he intended to hold an Employment Summit on 2a3 and 29<br />
November in Parliament House, Hobart, I was determined that<br />
the Commonwealth Government would take an active and<br />
constructive part.<br />
Because the Summit represents a new approach to put Tasmania<br />
back on the path towards co-operation and prosperity.<br />
I want to oUtline today how we will be working with<br />
Michael Field's Government, both to make the Summit a<br />
success, and in the longer-term to ensure Tasmania's<br />
particular problems receive the attention they deserve.<br />
Let me say at the outset that the initiative of<br />
Michael Field, and or my Parliamentary colleague<br />
Duncan Kerr, is a very welcome one.<br />
it's a serious endeavour to foster employment and<br />
enterprise development in Tasmania.<br />
For too long, under the previous State Government,<br />
Tasmania's economic plight was ignored or concealed behind<br />
the bluster of a P'remier and a conservative party which had<br />
no idea of how to go about remedying the problem..<br />
The fact is, Tasmania's unemployment is high relative to the<br />
rest of Australia and employment growth is well below the<br />
national average. </p>
<p>That appalling situation appalling for the well-being of<br />
the State as a whole and debilitating for those directly hit<br />
by unemployment never received any constructive attention<br />
from the previous Government.<br />
Indeed, their confrontationist approach exacerbated the<br />
situation. What is essential now is that we develop a strategy which<br />
will create a base for sustainable economic growth, thereby<br />
generating permanent employment opportunities for<br />
Tasmanians. In doing this, let us not ign-ore thet number or real<br />
advantages that Tasmanian brings to the question of building<br />
the basis for long-term growth. For example, labour costs<br />
in Tasmania are lower than on the mainland, ana tnis<br />
reflecting not a difference in the structure of industry in<br />
the State but a real difference in the cost structure of<br />
comparable industries.<br />
In recent years Tasmania has also had an especially good<br />
industrial relations record, with the workxing days lost per<br />
employee in the Imst two years being less than half the<br />
national average wnicn itself is nearly 60 per cent lower<br />
than under the previous Federal conservative government.<br />
This is a credit to employers and to the trade union<br />
movement in Tasmania whose co-operation under the principles<br />
of the Accord has provided an outstanding industrial climate<br />
in the State.<br />
Another major asset that Tasmania enjoys is the substantial<br />
assistance rendered by the Commonwealth to relieve the<br />
employment problems in the State.<br />
First, under the policy of fiscal equalisation, Tasmania<br />
receives a per capita level of Commonwealth assistance which<br />
is more than 40 per cent higher than the average for<br />
Australia as a whole. This permits Tasmania to fund higher<br />
levels of outlays and public sector employment than would<br />
otherwise be the case.<br />
Second, Tasmania enjoys a number of forms of assistance not<br />
available in other states: the $ 50 million forestry<br />
industry package, the $ 45 million paid under the<br />
Gordon-below-Frankclin Package; the Tasmanian freight<br />
equalisation package of more than $ 30 million this year and<br />
the Tasmanian Wheat Freight Subsidy Scheme, worth some<br />
$ 3.6 million this year.<br />
Third, the Commonwealth provides a full range of programs<br />
designed to assist employment, education and training in<br />
Tasmania. This year the total cost of these programs was </p>
<p>million including substantial uujumiUtrlts to TAI'E, to<br />
trade training, the Australian Traineeship system and the<br />
programs Jobstart, Jobtrain and SkillShare.<br />
To ensure that these forms of assistance available from the<br />
Commonwealth can be directed and focused to maximum effect,<br />
and to sharpen the effectiveness of the Summit, I have<br />
decided, in consultation with Premier Field to establish a<br />
special Commonwealth-State Task Force on Tasmania.<br />
The Task Force will report to me on action which the<br />
Commonwealth can take to assist the economic and social<br />
development of Tasmania.<br />
The Task Force members all have a close understanding of<br />
Tasmanian needs. It will be chaired by the Federal member<br />
for Denison, Duncan Kerr, who developed the concept of the<br />
Task Force with me. The members of the Task Force will be:<br />
Peter Duncan, Commonwealth Minister for Employment and<br />
Education Services;<br />
Michael Tate, Commonwealth Minister for Justice;<br />
Peter Patmore, Deputy Premier of Tasmania;<br />
Michael Aird, Tasmanian Minister for the Environment<br />
and Planning, Minister for. Employment, Industrial<br />
Relations and Training, minister Assisting the Premier<br />
on Youth Affairs;<br />
Mr Kerry O'Brien, President, Trades and Labour Council<br />
and Secretary, Miscellaneous workers Union;<br />
H r Paul Salmon, Managing Director, Electrolytic Zinc<br />
Company Of Australia Ltd; and<br />
1Ms Robyn Cooney, Consultant to the Tasmanian<br />
Development Authority, Community Representative.<br />
I want this Task Force to perform three key roles;<br />
irst to examine ways of better integrating<br />
Commonwealth and Tasmanian State programs which have a<br />
bearing on employment generation and economic and<br />
social development;<br />
Second to develop Commonwealth-State proposals which<br />
would further the economic and social development of<br />
Tasmania, while recognising the fiscal constraints<br />
within which both governments must operate;<br />
Third, to advise me on appropriate commonwealth<br />
responses to the Tasmanian Employment Summit. </p>
<p>First, the Antarctic environment is extremely fragile and<br />
critically important to the whole global ecosystem.<br />
second, mining in Antarctica will always be dangerous, and<br />
could be catastrophically so.<br />
In the light of those propositions, we are convinced that<br />
the Minerals Convention is basically flawed.<br />
It is based on the clearly incorrect assumption current in<br />
the 1970s that mining in the Antarctic could be consistent<br />
with the preservation of the continent's fragile<br />
environment. But any mining operation, with its accompanying<br />
infrastructure and bulk transport needs, would have a<br />
lasting and major impact on the area in which it takes<br />
place. I do not believe that the risk of accidents can ever be<br />
totally eliminated either by paper regimes or by advances<br />
in technology.<br />
The recent oil spills at the United States' Scott-Amundsen<br />
and McMurdo Stations, although minor, demonstrate that it is<br />
hard enough to prevent mishaps with existing, much lower<br />
level, non-resource-based activity.<br />
The Minerals Convention might provide for some a dangerous<br />
illusion of environment protection.<br />
But by permitting immediate prospecting and setting-out a<br />
path by which mining might proceed it will in fact be<br />
working in precisely the opposite direction.<br />
So with France, Australia is pursuing the initiative of a<br />
comprehensive environmental protection convention which will<br />
establish Antarctica as'a " Natural Reserve Land of<br />
science." I am aware that our decision has caused considerable anxiety<br />
amongst those Antarctic Treaty members who believed that the<br />
coming into force of the Minerals Convention was not just a<br />
correct outcome but a foregone conclusion.<br />
And I'm also aware of assertions that our opposition to the<br />
convention is purely tactical, or has been adopted for<br />
short-term electoral reasons and will be reversed as soon as<br />
convenient. Let me urge anyone who might still harbour that fantasy to<br />
abandon it. </p>
<p>Because the reverse is true.<br />
I am convinced that more and more countries will come to<br />
share the position that President Mitterrand, Prime Minister<br />
Rocard and I have outlined. Already we are receiving strong<br />
support from countries sucn as uelgiwn, Italy, the Federal<br />
Republic of Germany, and India.<br />
In the end, that position will prevail because it is<br />
correct, and because it is being endorsed by international<br />
public opinion which, in the coming months and years, will<br />
only gather further momentum and strength.<br />
The current discussions taking place about the Minerals<br />
Convention, and the guidelines, codes of conduct and other<br />
measures that Treaty parties have already put into place<br />
including the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic<br />
Marine Living Resources attest to the environmental<br />
sensitivity that has characterised the management of<br />
Antarctica under the Treaty system.<br />
Australia and France are not challenging the Treaty system,<br />
or the operation of the consensus principle that has<br />
underpinned its operation.<br />
But we = m challenging Treaty members to accept that times<br />
have changed since the 1970s, that our levels of knowledge<br />
have changed, and that we need to continue to justify the<br />
Antarctic Treaty Parties' management regime in Antarctica.<br />
in taking the initiative on this issue, we are seeking to<br />
achieve a goal that we believe would yield important<br />
benefits mutual~ benefits for all the people of the world.<br />
Australia, as a middle power, puts great store in<br />
multilateral forums, because they are the best vehicles for<br />
tackling global problems that are too broad and complex for<br />
individual nations to resolve alone.<br />
So, we are leading the efforts to liberalise world trade in<br />
the Uruguay Round; initiating moves to establish closer<br />
economic co-operation in our Asia Pacific region; hosting<br />
the recent Government and industry conference against<br />
chemical weapons; ' actively exerting international pressure<br />
on the abhorrent system or apartheid.<br />
diverse issues, but all requiring serious and<br />
concerted efforts by many nations if the global<br />
community is to reap the benefits they promise.<br />
it is with that attitude and that aspiration that we<br />
approach these vital decisions that must be made about the<br />
future of Antarctica. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The intrepid voyages and scientific activities of Jacques<br />
Cousteau, from whom we will hear shortly, have inspired our<br />
generation, just as those of Dumont D'tUrville, Amnundsen and<br />
Mawson captured the imagination of our forebears.<br />
If we don't measure up in our decisions to protect the<br />
Antarctic environment, we can be certain that people like<br />
Jacques Cousteau will be there to tell us so.<br />
I am firmly convinced that one of the greatest legacies our<br />
generation can leave to the future may yet be one of the<br />
simplest: one continent unspoilt, a testament to our own<br />
recognition that in other corners of the world we have<br />
already gone too far. </p>
