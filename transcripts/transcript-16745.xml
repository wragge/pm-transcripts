    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM: This weekend's Green Round in the AFL is about how do we encourage mums and dads, fans, supporters, clubs, players, right across the country on doing their bit to bring down greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, to do their bit on climate change.</p>
<p>People ask, â€˜well, what are the practical things that can be done to bring down carbon pollution?' Well, if you're in a football club, practical stuff like have you got insulation in your ceiling to bring down your overall cost of energy? Good for the club's electricity bills over time as well.</p>
<p>On top of that, what can you do to bring in a solar hot water system for the showers and the other needs that you've got within the club itself? What can you do with solar panels on the roof? What can you do, also, in terms of encouraging your fans and supporters to use public transport where that's available?</p>
<p>These are the practical things, together with energy-efficient light bulbs, which all go towards making a difference.</p>
<p>The Government's agreed to contribute up to $200,000 to our new climate change partnership with the AFL. We believe this is a good investment for the future, and we look forward to the AFL being our partners in this, so that Australia can make a difference on climate change.</p>
