PRIME MINISTER<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE 31 MAY 19.85 PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
The Government has-been pleased to receive report<br />
within due time from Professor Slatyer. You'll recall that<br />
this is part of the decision the Government made in regard<br />
to uranium and I believe that it will provide, and as I said<br />
in the Parliament, for a useful basis not only for discussion<br />
within the Labor Party as they come up to the Conference when<br />
they have to make decisions on these matters, but I think the<br />
whole of the Australian community in its considerations of this<br />
important issue by.-. the. report,* which: in mF' -judgembftt will become a<br />
standard for analysis of these matters. I think it's excellent<br />
in terms of its technical competence and the way it addresses<br />
itself to the major issues of concern.<br />
JOtJRNLIST: Mr Hawke would fjou expect the Cabinet to be looking<br />
at the question of new contracts before the. Conference?<br />
It could only, I think, be doing that in the light of<br />
any reports that we may receive from relevant Ministers and I<br />
think there particularly Mr Hayden who wish to make some<br />
report on any discussions he's had with thie French on this<br />
matter. But no, I would see no decisions being made by the<br />
Cabinet or the Government prior to the Conference in that respect.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what do you foresee in terms of the<br />
report saying that Australia should perhaps enrich uranium and<br />
also go into joint ventures with countries in the Asian-Pacific<br />
region. Certainly that extension hasn't been considered by the<br />
Government. It's formed no part of our considerations. I just<br />
see it there as the work of the Committee putting out as a logical<br />
extension of its consideration of the issues but it's not a matter<br />
to which the Government has directed it's attention nor would it<br />
be appropriate to expect any decision on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: So it wouldn't be rejected out of hand?<br />
I was putting it . the other.'. way. It hasn't to this point<br />
been any part of our thinking or our proposals and I can't see<br />
that it would be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke another committee academics, Dr Souter<br />
and Professor Kerr have put out a report today which takes exactly<br />
the opposite stance. Why should more credence be given </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: cont. to the report of the Government committee than<br />
the Souter and Kerr report? II<br />
would hope that people who are interested in these<br />
issues would read both.. I haven't had a copy of the Souter<br />
report sent to me. I hope that one is sent to me. I will<br />
certainly read it. I can only say that I would be more than<br />
a little surprised if the Souter report turned out to be a<br />
superior one to the report that I tabled in the Parliament<br />
today. But I urge everyone who's interested in the issues to<br />
read both.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister how does this politically..' help you,<br />
or if it does at all, at the July National Conference. in ter--ns of<br />
getting this argument through policy on uranium.<br />
-r<br />
P. Well I think the report sustains the analysis and<br />
argument that I and others have put and it does it with an<br />
authority in some respects that I am not able to bring to bear<br />
to it, or some of my other colleagues. And I would feel sure<br />
that those of our colleagues who will be delegates to the<br />
Conference, who to this point may not have come to some final<br />
conclusion, will read this report with an open mind and will<br />
be persuaded with the virtue, of the conclusions that are<br />
contained in the report.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke the report goes much farther than the<br />
Government's existing policy. Does this lead you to believe<br />
that perhaps the changes at the Conference should go further<br />
than simply backing the Government's decisions over the last<br />
few months. Well, I think you( 11 appreciate that the draft report<br />
of. Senator Walsh goes further than the actual decisions of the<br />
Government. Now I would not expect that there'll be proposals<br />
before the Conference going substanti~ ly-. further than the<br />
Roxby issue.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you support the Walsh position?<br />
I've asked my colleagues to contain their debate within<br />
the Party and I think I'll do the same thing.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke you said that there was no immediate<br />
short-term consideration enrichment. Do you, see the enrichment<br />
industry Well, could I just interrupt you Michelle. I'm not really<br />
wanting to put adjectival qualifications on it. I mean there is<br />
no consideration of it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you see the possibility of an enrichment industry<br />
in Australia',-in the long-term?<br />
No, I haven't directed my attention to it. We've give:.' i<br />
no consideration to it and it not being an issue I therefore<br />
firmly believe that the state of the issues that will before<br />
the Conference are not assisted by hypothesising about something<br />
which is not in the Government's mind. ./ 3 </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: If you accept the proposition-in the Report<br />
that if the Government is to maximise input into nonproliferation<br />
it would be best for Australia to be involved<br />
not only in mining but in the acceptance of the enrichment<br />
debate.<br />
PM: I can see from the point of view of the Committee, thE!<br />
logic of the position that they put that the Government has;<br />
to address itself to the issues which are of relevance in<br />
the existing political and economic scene and in terms of<br />
the answer that I gave to Michelle, there is no point in<br />
muddying that relevant debate by talking about something<br />
which, as far as the Government is concerned, is not on the!<br />
agenda. JOURNALIST: Well since the Report has raised this subject,<br />
do you think there will be a requirement or a need for the<br />
Government to consider it at some stage?<br />
PM: I can't see it.<br />
JOURNALIST: That would go too with the recommendation to<br />
get countries like Japan and Australia together in terms<br />
of the nuclear fuel cycle to create stability in the region..<br />
PM:. I think there are areas for co-operation between<br />
Australia and Japan in some respects. For instance when I<br />
was in Japan you will recall that Mr. Nakasone raised with<br />
me the question of. their disposal of nuclear waste products<br />
and I made it clear th ~ t Australia had a very strong view<br />
that it was against As an dumping at this stage and arguing<br />
that they should dispose of it on land on their land. So<br />
there is an opportunity for co-operation between us in us<br />
putting positions as to what we think is the appropriate thing<br />
to be done. I think that with those countries with whom we<br />
have excellent relations we ought to be able to co-operate in<br />
the relevant international fora like the International<br />
Atomic Energy Agency to co-operate in trying to increase<br />
safe-guards. That is the sort of co-operation that I see as<br />
possible. JOURNALIST: But not joint ventures or anything like that?<br />
PM: Not down the sort of track that has been raised in the<br />
previous question.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, if you were holding discussions with<br />
other countries about the storage of high level nuclear waste,<br />
would you see it as a possibility that Australia might store<br />
nuclear waste in this country<br />
PM: I can't see that as a possibility. / 4 </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Sir, would you prefer that we use the term long<br />
term in your statement to Parliament today forecasts as<br />
well does this imply that you see a need for Australia to<br />
play a role in the nuclear fuel cycle which goes beyond the<br />
resources of the existing mines at Roxby Downs.<br />
PM: You know the Walsh Draft goes further and I have already<br />
addressed myself to that question.<br />
JOURNALIST:. Prime Minister, can I ask you a question on<br />
another subject.<br />
PM: You can have a go, we'll see.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has the Cabinet reached a decision on an assets<br />
test and if so, do you believe the decision will reduce some<br />
of the fear or confusion, if you like, amongst pensioners.<br />
PM: Yes and yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you confirm to us that you gave a dressing~<br />
down to your Ministry today about the leaks?<br />
PM: I cannot confirm.<br />
JOURNALIST: About the decision?<br />
PM: I like that one actually.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you p17 to tell us the decision now?<br />
PM: Which one?<br />
JOURNALIST: The Cabinet decision. Or are you going to do<br />
that tomorrow?<br />
PM: Oh I think I will leave it-till tomorrow, Ken, if you<br />
don't mind. I'm quite prepared to have another press<br />
conference with you tomorrow.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you announce it tomorrow?<br />
PM: Yes, I'll be making a statement in the Parliament tomorrow.<br />
JOURNALIST: In the events of this week, particularly yestErday,<br />
do you think that immigration will now run as an issue in the<br />
election? PM: I trust it will not. I don't want to do anything here<br />
or subsequently to revive it as an issue or partisanship. I<br />
think you can' appreciate that it would be fairly easy for me<br />
to do that, but I'm not going to. I think you are all aware<br />
of the attitude that I adopted in the Parliament. I'm not<br />
going to divert from that. I simply want to say that I think<br />
there is the basis now for a resumption by the Opposition of a<br />
bipartisan position and I think that position has been reached<br />
and I trust it will be and I'm not going to say anything which<br />
is going to prejudice that. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Does that mean, Mr. Hawke, that the Government<br />
sees its way clear now to establish a race relations committee<br />
in the Caucus.<br />
PM: Well I believe that anything that the Parliament can do<br />
tsecure within the community a rational and humane approach<br />
on these issues makes sense and I say at this stage no more<br />
than that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Given the number of new revelations about the<br />
Maralinga test area is there a case for a full judicial<br />
enquiry into that<br />
PM: I wouldn't say that at this stage. Let me make a couple<br />
of general comments and then a specific one., I think you<br />
will appreciate that this Government has got nothing to hide<br />
or any interest in seeking to hide the truth as to what<br />
happened in that period and that is, if you like, quite<br />
objective reason and if you want to look at it in partisan.<br />
terms we were not the Government. So however you look at<br />
it, this Government doesn't seek to hide anything and<br />
certainly that is the attitude of the Government in general.<br />
It is the attitude of the Minister, Senator Walsh. He, I<br />
understand, will receive tomorrow the Report which he<br />
commissioned to examine from whatever sources are available<br />
what the evidence is as to fall-out. I think he has got<br />
the Report as to chronology of events and he and the<br />
Government will be examining the situation in the light of'<br />
those Reports. It is premature until we have looked at those<br />
reports to say what further steps may be necessary but I<br />
assert to you quit; e unequivocally that we will do all that. we<br />
can to see that the tp'th of what happened emerges.<br />
JOURNALIST: If you have made a decision on the assets test,<br />
why can't you bring the uncertainty that is surrounding it.,<br />
particularly amongst the elderly community to a rest here and<br />
now by making<br />
PM: I understand the importance that you attach to yourselves<br />
aind the jobs that you hold and the responsibilities that you<br />
feel that you have to discharge, but my view is that it is<br />
appropriate to bring to this to the Parliament.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, just on that immigration point on<br />
the committee on race relations, do you think the suspension<br />
of Mr. Hodgman today might impair the Government's ability<br />
to have that committee?<br />
PM: I wouldn't think so. I mean, you know I'm charitable<br />
by nature. I don't want to cast dispersions on the persor. to<br />
whom you refer. I didn't detect a noticeable degree of support<br />
for the gentelman on the other side of the House. I think the<br />
Parliament is capable of dealing with these matters with o'r<br />
without the presence of the person to whom you refer. / 6 </p>
<p>6.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr. Hawke, will you intervene in this dispute<br />
which is k eeping the non-members bar clo" sed?<br />
PM: MY heart goes out to you. No-one is on strike at<br />
the Lodge.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, if I may, one more on the<br />
assets test. You have made a decision. Would that<br />
decision be as that suggested by Mr. Peacock today, namely,<br />
that you could drop all plans for an assets test.<br />
PM: I would have thought that the evidence availabe to you<br />
people who watch the proceedings of this Parliament is such<br />
that you would have come to the conclusion that I certainly<br />
have come to a long time ago and it is perhaps more<br />
starkly evident now that it would be an exercise in<br />
futility to rely upon any form of guidance and particularly<br />
consistent guidance from the Leader of the Opposition on<br />
any matter or importance. </p>
