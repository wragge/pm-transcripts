A WATION IZ= SSANTLY ENGAGED IN DEMOCRATIC DISPUTATION ABOUT<br />
EVZUV ASI? 12L'-OF XTS NATIONAL POLICY.<br />
ISRAEL HAS L'-VER SURRZNDERaED ITS DEMOCRATIC TRADITION EVEN IN<br />
THE DAR=-1S' DI( 3! ETS WHEN ITS VERY SURVIVAL WAS AT RXSIC.<br />
SO XT WAP. S Dl IND2SCRIBABLE IPLEASURZ FOR ME LAST MONTH TO<br />
REVISIT lSW,\ L AND THUS BECOME THE FIRST AUSTRALIAN PRIME<br />
MINISTER1 T3 EM2K A VISIT THERE.<br />
I WAS aZCE)= VD NJITH VERY GRI3A? GENE~ ROSITY BY PRESIDENT<br />
ERZDG ? R ,1 1HISTER SHAMIR, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER<br />
SHIMON 2222S AND SUCH OUTSTANDING PERSONALITIES AS ABBA<br />
EBAN. I ET3LD TALE( S WITH TEM AID A LARGE NUMBER OF MINISTERS<br />
AND LABCJTh LI\ L2TY AND TRADE UNION LEADERS. IT WAS A GREAT<br />
PLEAS=~ 1712 D2 TO BE AMNG OLD FRIENDS.<br />
A 22RSO-CL [ llKGLIGRY OF THE VISIT TO ISRAEL WAS THE<br />
GLSTZU12 GY f= raRZi UN~ IVERSITYii IN JERUSALEM IN HONOURhING ME<br />
WI1TH TnE AU1D 017 AN HON02ARY DCCCTORATE OF PHILOSOPHY. I DO<br />
NOT N22D ? T EM91D THIS GATEZRING OF THE BRILLIANT<br />
IY4T2LL2CTiUPli TRADITIONS OF THAT GRI3AT UNIVERSITY.<br />
11EIL2 IN J I ALSO HAD THE MOVING EXPERIENCE OF<br />
122TXLN ' U-I M~ OTHERS AND RELATIVES OF REFUSENIKS PEOPLE WHO<br />
HAV13 HEZr'N a-= T7VMtED, OFTEN OVER MANY YEARS, FROM1<br />
MEUITING tJITH THIR FAMILIES WHO ARE UNABLE TO LEAVE THE<br />
SOVx2T m~: 1<br />
ONE CASE STRULXKZ~ AS PARTICULARLY UNJUST : IT INVOLVES A<br />
DAUGHTE AP O'I" IIJG FOR A VISA TO ENTER T3E SOVIET UNION TO SEE<br />
HER HGER M IS DYING OF CANCER AND HAS VERY LITTLE TIME TO<br />
LXVZO V"-YX UCVEN INSTRUCTIONS TO HAVE THIS CASE INVESTIGATED<br />
AND I TRUST ? 3HE SOVIET AUTHORITIES WILL RELENT IN THEIR<br />
RE2BSAL TO A7JZO( W THIS FAMILY TO BE REUNITED. </p>
<p>x3.<br />
1 ALSO LIAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF A VALUABLE TALK WITH<br />
PALESTINII-U3 FROMI THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.<br />
AS A RESSJL OF ALL THESE DISCUSSIONS AND CONTACTS, I BELIEVE<br />
LINUS BUT1-' N ISRAEL AND AUSTRALIA ARZ MUCH CLOSER,* AND THE<br />
AUSTRALRAE GDVERkdONT IS EVEN BETTER INFORMED ABOUT THE WIDE<br />
RANGE CY 022,2010,4 1HICI3 INFO02N ISRAELI POLICY.<br />
IN RTS RALIL YEARS, ISRAEL 17ACED AN APPAPRENTLY PERMENT<br />
TMLEAT 07 1CIITRUTION FEON ITS N~ EIGHBOURS. IN THOSE<br />
CII2CtMSTAKE-33, ISRAEL OBVIOUSLY DID NIOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF<br />
CGNTEXLAl-' 4" FEAC2 WITH TMEM.<br />
TODAY, UflRLD MS CHANGED. PZOPLE NG7A REALISE TiIHAT ISRAEL<br />
IS NGT GO1JNT TO DISAPPEAR AND IS A CONTINUIlNG PART OF TE MAP<br />
OF TEE 3UI9M-" 13 LASTr.<br />
SO I BELIE7JT7 TEERE IS A GREAT3 OPPORTUNITY THESE DAYS<br />
FOR ZJaRL ~ 2) INVESTIGATE 73E PRtOCESSES OF DISCUSSION WITH<br />
NEIGHB3OU-012VC S3TATUS WHO DO IN FACT ACCEPT ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO<br />
EXIST.<br />
THE CA" P llT\ V. D ACCORD WITH 13GYPT DEMONSTRATES THE<br />
FRUITFULNES OF THIS PATH 01? NEGOTIATION.<br />
I HAD VERY CNSTRUCTIVE TALK~ S WITH THE LEADERS OF ISRAEL'S<br />
IIEIGHB~ i7RS i2VVT AND JORDAN. I WAS PROFOUNDLY IMPRESSED BY<br />
JORDANWS U JCZESTIONSABLE COMMIITMENT TO PEACE AND BY EGYPT'S<br />
CO2NYINMD.[ ilU'i223CZ TO THE SPIRIT Oi' CAMP DAVID.<br />
SO WE NWST T'SJXS THI2 MEASURE OF THE CHANGES WJHICH SEPARATE US<br />
TODAY FROM TMII1 EARLY YEARS OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL MOULDED BY<br />
DAVID BREN<br />
BEN G; URION9S GENIERATION OF PIOCIE11S HAS, SADLY, LARGELY<br />
PASSED 0K. ISRAEL IS CHANGING AND XATURXNG AND IS<br />
CONFRONTXNA TROUBLING AND PROFOUND ISSUES OF WHICH THOSE<br />
PIOLERS ElEN LIT'TLE OR NOTHING. </p>
<p>I CAME AWAY 2aON MY VISIT TO ISRAEL CONVINCED THAT THE<br />
PRINCIPLES TILAT NATION HAS ALWAYS STOOD FOR EGALITARIANISM,<br />
THE DIGNIT 5 LABOUn, DEVOTION TO A JEWISH HONELAND, AND AN<br />
ENDURINGLY K. DOCATXC STYLE OF GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE A<br />
SOUND MEANS 3? 7 MEETING THE CHALLENGES NOW FACING THE COUNTRY.<br />
THESE ARE PRINCIPLES DAVID BEN GURION STOOD FOR AND THEIR<br />
CONTINUED M= 73VANCE IS THE REAL BEN GURION INHERITANCE.<br />
SO Itl CONCLU3IOU I CONGRATULATE THE CITY OF STIRLING AND THE<br />
COUNCIL OF ,2-STEN AUSTRALIAN JEWRY WHO HAVE JOINED TOGETHER<br />
IN NAMING TV2S BEAUTIFUL PARK AFTER DAVID BEN GURION. AS I<br />
SAID TO MY 13RAELI BOSTS ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN -ZZISH COMMUNITY HAS NOT ONLY HAD AN ENORMOUSLY<br />
BENEFICIAL = 7LUENCE ON OUR SOCIETY BUT HAS ALSO BECOME A<br />
STEADFAST L 2DGH OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND ISRAEL.<br />
I KNOW I Ci" 1 SPEAK FOR YOUR LOCAL MEMBER, RON EDWARDS, WHO<br />
HAS BEEN SO ~ TIVE IN ADVANCING THE INTEREST OF THIS<br />
ELECTORATE, IEN I SAY IT IS All HONOUR AND A PLEASURE FOR<br />
US TO BE 1E= 2 AT THIS CEREMONY TODAY. I </p>
