PRIME MINISTER<br />
E. -PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF SUNDAY PROGRAM 11 AUGUST 1985<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, thanks for joining us.<br />
PM: My pleasure, Robert.<br />
JOURNALIST: " Je've had further evidence on the economic<br />
front this week of good news, yet the public standing of<br />
your government remains bad news. Why do you think that<br />
is?<br />
PM: We've been locked up in Canberra for the first six<br />
months of this year on the two issues tax, most of the<br />
time, getting the May expenditure statement ready and<br />
then latterly the Budget. And ta~ is never good news.<br />
So I think the attention has been diverted from the<br />
tremendous economic achievements to which you r: efer.<br />
Australia has been doing better than any other economy in<br />
the world. And I think once we have got those diversions<br />
behind us, the real good news will start to be reflected.<br />
JOURNALIST: And wasn't the taxation bad news magnified by<br />
holding the tax summit?<br />
PM:. Well it, I suppose, magnified some of the bad news.<br />
But I wouldn't do it differentl3if I had my time again. I<br />
think it has given us a basis for coming up with a package<br />
that will be both acceptable and will constitute significant<br />
tax reform, Robert. I<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, we are going to move to taxation in a<br />
moment. PM: Sure.<br />
JOURNALIST: But after the poor electoral showing of the<br />
Government, you accepted part of the blame for that. You<br />
said that was partly your responsibility. Do you accept<br />
personally the blame for the Government's poor showing in<br />
the polls at the moment.<br />
PM: Pardy, I have got to. I mean, when we were going very<br />
well people were kind enough to attribute it, at least in<br />
part to me. When we are down a bit then I have to accept<br />
some of that responsibility. I think I have been tied up<br />
with these other matters, but I am now free from them. I<br />
will be out selling the very positive achievements of the<br />
Government to date and enlarging the vision for Australians </p>
<p>of what we have in store for a much better Austral. ia<br />
into thie future. I<br />
JOURNALIST: And asserting more in the Government your<br />
leadership. That has been something that many critics,<br />
and some inside the Government, have seen to be lacking.<br />
PM: That is fair comment. Again, I go back in part to<br />
tax. I felt during that period when we were both developing<br />
our position and then going to the public with it, that it<br />
was politically unrealistic to expect that with the debate<br />
going on in the party that people within the Government<br />
weren't going to be able to have their opportunity to speak<br />
and push a point of view. That is behind us. And I have<br />
made it quite clear to my Ministers that they are to stick<br />
to their portfolios and any movement outside of that will<br />
be dealt with. And I think that that has been welcomed<br />
by the Ministers themselves, and certainly by the party.<br />
JOURNALIST: In Fiji you held a dinner with a number of<br />
journalists. I am told that there you specifically said<br />
that Bill Hayden had breached a Cabinet decision when he<br />
talked on<br />
PM: I didn't put it that way.<br />
JOURNALIST: How did you put it?<br />
PM: I am in the difficult position that well, let me put<br />
it this way. I believe that Bill Hayden has-been an<br />
outstandingly successful Minister. I believe he has had the<br />
interests of the Government at all times at heart. There<br />
was a point there where he felt strongly about a particular<br />
issue and he made a statement. To Bill's credit, after I<br />
wrote the letter, which applied not only to what Bill had<br />
said, he understood and accepted that. And I think if you<br />
spoke to the people in question, you will find that there<br />
was no personal attack or criticism of Bill. It occurred in<br />
a situation where a number of people were feeling that<br />
perhaps they could say certain things and go to areas outside<br />
their own portfolios. And I am not on this program or<br />
anywhere else going to do what I haven't done before, and that<br />
is attack Bill because in my judgement..<br />
JOURNALIST: Has he breached a Cabinet decision?<br />
PM: It wasn't so much a question of breaching a decision.<br />
What we had had was a position where on the previous Monday<br />
the matter in question had been raised. A view was adopted<br />
and then Bill felt, for compelling reasons personally, that<br />
he wanted to say something. I think in retrospect he would<br />
understand it wouldn't now be appropriate.<br />
JOURNALIST: But isn't there a difficulty here with what<br />
you said to us a short time ago when you said that from now<br />
on there would be more leadership and there would be no more<br />
Ministers speaking outside their portfolios. 13 </p>
<p>PM: Well, what I am saying to you is that my le-. ter to<br />
the Ministers followed after that event.<br />
JOURNALIST: But what if another Minister feels strongly.<br />
PM: I made it quite clear in the letter that the rules<br />
had to be adhered to. Ministers were not to go outside<br />
their portfolios. That has been accepted.<br />
JOUJRNALIST: If you get another Bill Hayden comment.<br />
PM: Let's be fair. It wasn't just Bill that was involved.<br />
It applies to anyone.<br />
JOURNALIST: So you don't feel you have to pull Bill Hayden<br />
into line?<br />
PM: Certainly not.<br />
JOURNALIST: It is all tied up with factionalism, isn't it<br />
Prime Minister. Is this business of showing strong leadership<br />
one of the reasons you called the four key Centre Left<br />
Minist'=! rs a couple of weeks ago and suggested they disband<br />
their faction.<br />
PM: I'm not going to the details of the discussion I had<br />
with four Ministers or a single Minister. But let me make this<br />
point. I am not trying to avoid the substance of your<br />
question. I believe that an excess of factionalism and<br />
speaking from factional point of views has harmed the<br />
Government. Now, to the credit of the groups concerned, I<br />
think they share that view. I think you will find that<br />
there will be a considerable diminution, if not extinction,<br />
of that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Now, did you have in mind, though, that only<br />
the Centre Left wind down, or that all the factions wind down?<br />
PM: Not simply the Centre Left, no, certainly not.<br />
JOURNALIST: You would like to see all three, what, cease to<br />
exist or merely<br />
PM: I don't think, if you look at it at the State level.<br />
I mean, it is quite unrealistic to say at State levels that<br />
factional groupings in this, or any other party for that<br />
matter don't let's delude ourselves that we haven't got<br />
factionalism in the Liberal and the National Party. I hope<br />
we will have an opportunity perhaps to get to that. But in<br />
all political parties there are groups and they operate at<br />
State levels. I have the view that at the national level the<br />
interests of the party and of the Government would be better<br />
served if it wasn't so institutionalised. I don't think you<br />
can say that people aren't going to meet together, but I<br />
think the concept of statements on behalf of groups is not<br />
helpful. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: You're a member of the right wing faction,<br />
Prime Minister. Does this mean you will stop going to<br />
their meetings, stop being part of that faction?<br />
PM: I don't think it is going to be necessary for me to<br />
attend those meetings. And, I mean, if I had my way, what<br />
would be the ultimately desirable position I think, is there<br />
shouldn't be any group meetings at all. Now, whether we can<br />
get to that, I don't k~ now.<br />
JOURNALIST: But it %. ild certainlybe leadership by example for you<br />
to withdraw from the right faction, would it not?<br />
PM: I guess so. And I think you might find I won't be going<br />
along. JOURNALIST: Mr Hayden in his Chifley Memorial Lecture<br />
earlier in the week talked about factionalism. And he said<br />
that Labor needed to return to traditional policies,<br />
traditional ways of selling policies. Do you accept that as<br />
criticism, or what is your view?<br />
PM: I don't. And I don't think it was intended. I read<br />
Bill's lecture. I think it was a very salutory lecture in a<br />
number of respects. It pointed out the fact that the strength<br />
of the Labor movement was in being seen not as a radical<br />
evolutionary type party but a party which is concerned with<br />
achieving particular improvements for ordinary . Australian<br />
men and women. That was the major thrust of his lecture. I<br />
think it sensible. And I think one point that he made is<br />
particularly important. And that is this has been a<br />
spectacularly successful government.<br />
JOURNALIST: But he said you hadn't sold that. Is that a<br />
criticism of you?<br />
PM: that's the point I am going to. He said as a Government<br />
we hadn't been entirely successful in selling those<br />
achievements. I believe he is right. And I have to accept<br />
some of the responsibility for that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Some of your senior colleagues believe that<br />
you have received warnings of this yourself that Mr Hayden<br />
in that speech and in other ways, is making a run for the<br />
party leadership.<br />
PM: That is nonsense.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you received warnings along those lines?<br />
PM: No;<br />
JOURNALIST: There is certainly tension between you though,<br />
isn't there? </p>
<p>PM: Well people like to spend a bit of time apparently<br />
talking about it. All I can say is that in portfolio<br />
terms there has, from the very first day of government,<br />
been consistent and constructive co-operation and co-ordination<br />
between Bill Hayden and myself. Now, if people want to 4.<br />
speculate about that sort of thing, they may. It has, in<br />
my judgement, no solid basis.<br />
JOURNALIST: When are we going to see a revised tax<br />
package? PM: I hope that Paul Keating will be able to bring down that<br />
package before the cnd of September. That is certainly the<br />
timetable.<br />
JOURNALIST: There have been reports that the Treasury<br />
really hasn't given up on a 12h% consumption tax and that,<br />
in fact, they are going to get it in a de facto way through<br />
loading everything in on wholesale tax.<br />
PM: Well, if youchase every report that appears in the<br />
Australian media down the burrow which that report deserves, F<br />
we'ye all engaged in a fruitless exercise in self flagellation.<br />
It is nuL accurate.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about perks, Prime Minister, taxes on<br />
fringe benefits. That is another controversial subject that<br />
seems to have cost you support. What is your approach to<br />
that now since the tax summit?<br />
PM: That is part of Option A, the area of closing off tax<br />
avoidance. I suppose I could do no better than quote a<br />
well known authority in Liberal Party circles, the National<br />
President of the Party. I mean, Mr Valder put it well. He<br />
said, I think they are going to reverse the whole disease,<br />
if you like to call it, of fringe benefits which again has<br />
developed over a decade or more. He said what we are doing<br />
In that is a fair and a just thing. He's right.<br />
JOURNALIST: He also said you were implementing Liberal<br />
policy. Doesn't that embarrass you?<br />
PM: He said that about the assets test. And it is very<br />
interesting. We should have that on the record. The National<br />
President of the Liberal Party says the assets test is our<br />
policy. He's right. It's what Mr Peacock said in 1981. The<br />
only difference, as Mr Valder was good enough to say, they<br />
didn't have the guts to do it, or the honesty to do it. They<br />
want us to do it, cop the flak, and then they come in and<br />
say, well it is done. It is our policy. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Welcome back to our interview. with the Prime<br />
Minister. Mr Hawke, John Howard has just circul. ated to<br />
business people a notice that the Oppositior intends to<br />
make a big issue in the run-up to the next election out of<br />
union power in Australia. Now since the Tax Summit your<br />
Government seems rather vulnerable to such a campaign.<br />
PM: I don't believe so. I think if Kr Howard and the<br />
Liberal Party want to talk about the relationship between<br />
trade unions, I welcome it. I just pray that they will<br />
bring it on. Every government in Australia has a relation<br />
with the trade union movement. And the previous government<br />
had a relationship, very few will forget it and none ought<br />
to forget it. It was a relationship of confrontation and of almost<br />
criminal negligence. And it cost this country dearly. our<br />
relationship with the trade union movement, within the Accord,<br />
has produced the most rapid economic and employment growth<br />
in the western world.<br />
JOURNALIST: But are you aware of a public perception that<br />
shows up in opinion poll after opinion poll that Australians<br />
believe that the unions are too powerful?<br />
PM: Well I think that is always the feeling. And that is<br />
understandable. But look at the level of industrial disputes,<br />
the lowest in this country for 17 years. And in regard tcu<br />
level of movement in earnings, the lowest in more than 17<br />
years. JOURNALIST: There is anofl-r crucial test com. ina utn th-ere with the<br />
Septeaber wages case, Prime Minister. People will watch that<br />
to see how much influence the union movement has. How much<br />
will it have? Will you do what the ACTU wants?<br />
PM: We will be certainly not doing what the ACTU wants.<br />
JOURNALIST: But will you be arguing for discounting of<br />
wages? PM: Let me finish. What we will be doing will be putting<br />
a position to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Commission who will make the decision. I believe that the<br />
ACTU will put their position, which will be different from<br />
ours. JOURNALIST: But you will be asking for discounting?<br />
PM: We will be putting in the September case a submission which<br />
we believe is necessary to ensure that the great competitive<br />
advantage presented to Australia by the significant devaluation<br />
that has occurred is not dissipated. And that as I have said<br />
consistently is going to require a lower level of real wage<br />
outcome than has previously been anticipated. There will be<br />
a number of ways in which this can be done and it includes<br />
discounting. </p>
<p>7.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime ZMinister, in public perception,; don't<br />
you agree that anything less than discounting will cost<br />
you support or make it look as though the unions are running<br />
the government.<br />
PM: No what will be required of this government will be<br />
the putting of submissions to the Commission which are consistent<br />
with responsible economic management. The fact is that this<br />
economy is still continuing to grow at record levels. It is<br />
still providing additional jobs at record levels. Now we<br />
are going to see that the wages policy pursued by this<br />
Government ensures the continuation of that economic growth.<br />
JOUR1NALIST: Do know what that wages policy, do you know what<br />
that government submission to the Arbitration Commission is going<br />
to be now.<br />
PM: I have it in my mind. The Cabinet has to finalise it.<br />
We don't run a dictatorship.<br />
JOURNALIST: When the Cabinet finalises it, will you be telling<br />
anyone before it goes to the Commission?<br />
PM: I think it will emerge before then, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: With the ACTU?<br />
PM: The ACTU, well we will discuss it~ them as we have discussed<br />
wages policy from day one of this Government. It is the fact<br />
that we have discussed wages policy with the ACTU which means<br />
that you have had, the statistics this week showing the lowest<br />
growth in earnings since the early 1960s. We are not going to<br />
stop discussing with the ACTU wages policy.<br />
JOURNALIST. And will it be discussed in the same terms and<br />
with the same amount of information with the business community?<br />
Who, after all, have to pay the wage?<br />
PM: Sure. I am more than happy, both in EPAC as we have already<br />
done it, or in bilateral discussions with the business community.<br />
They, I believe, know our position. We have exposed it before.<br />
But I am more than happy to talk with any representative of<br />
the business community about what they see as appropriate wages<br />
policy. JOURNALIST: And disclosing to them what you are going to<br />
argue in the Commission?<br />
PM: Just as happy to disclose to them the information that<br />
we think is relevant to the emergence of our policy. Just<br />
as happy to do it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Cabinet is about to discuss<br />
our relations with South Africa. Now the Government not only<br />
has a Trade Commissioner in Johannesburg, it also has a policy<br />
which encourages trade with South Africa. Isn't this inconsistent?<br />
What are you going to do about it? </p>
<p>PM: Well, I am waiting now to receive the submission that<br />
Bill will b2 putting up to Cabinet on Monday. We will get that<br />
before Monday arid until I see the submission I don't think it<br />
is appropriate to go to that. But let me make this point which<br />
I think is relevant. The South African Government should realise<br />
the increasing abhorrence around the world of the evil of<br />
apartheid. And that they should move towards the creation<br />
of a free and liberal democracy with universal suffrage.<br />
And that should be put to them. At the same time as those<br />
things are being put we should together be working out what<br />
increasing sanctions may be applied if they will not respond<br />
o~ f their own volition to that proposition. But Australia's<br />
sanctions b-i itself could not produce change.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just the same. We voted for international<br />
sanctions at the UN. I am wondering what you say to those<br />
opponents of the apartheid regime in South Africa who say<br />
that sanctions won't work. One of them is Helen Sussman,<br />
who is the spokesman for civil rights in the South African<br />
opposition. If I could quote her, she said not only won't<br />
they work, but the biggest sufferers would be the blacks.<br />
PM: Helen Sussman has said that. Bishop Tutu, I think is<br />
probably regarded as a legitimate spokesperson1 for the blacks<br />
of South Africa doesn't put that point of view. Now I don't<br />
question the integrity of Helen SL: zsmnan ' s point of view. But<br />
what I am saying is this. That you have now got a new situation<br />
in South Africa. You have got this state of emergency in 36<br />
districts. You have got the fact that since 1984 500 people,<br />
blacks, have been killed, basically by police and military<br />
action. You have got thousands who have been detained. Now<br />
it is that action which is denying ordinary, decent expectations<br />
to the overwhelming majority, about 75 percent, of the people<br />
of South Africa are being denied ordinary, decent rights. And<br />
the world is reacting to that. Now what you have got to understand<br />
is this. That I believe it is inevitable that if change<br />
doesn't occur within South Africa, the inevitability then is<br />
a bloodbath of some sort. Now that is abhorrent, it is appalling.<br />
Now the South African regime has it within its power, I believe,<br />
to understand what is happening, to understand in terms of its<br />
own interest, the capital that is fleeing the country, that<br />
people are fleeing the country. Now they can change that by<br />
their own action. That is how I would like to see it happen.<br />
JOURNALIST: Let's move to another issue now Prime Minister.<br />
On the nuclear free zone treaty which was negotiated in<br />
Rarotonga. Would it prevent home-porting of US nuclear<br />
ships as the Opposition now claims.<br />
PM: Well I believe that home-porting in the full sense<br />
that it is normally understood, would not be regarded as<br />
compatible with the treaty. Although there is a form of<br />
argument which says that the language there could be consistent<br />
with it. But it is, as far as this Government is concerned,<br />
entirely hypothetical because our policy is against homeporting.<br />
Our policy is the one which is totally consistent<br />
with our treaty obligations with the United States and which<br />
is understood by them and which is understood by our fellow<br />
members of the Forum. And that i' that under our treaty<br />
arrangements with the United States, our treaty partner, / 9<br />
I </p>
<p>the facilities of our ports will be available to them. And we<br />
have nade it quite clear to the Forum in the months of the<br />
drafting of this trcaty, that that is the position. It has<br />
been so accepted. It is understood by all of them and by<br />
the United States.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you persuade the Americans to endorse this<br />
treaty? PM: I have said I hope we can. I have reason to believe from<br />
the discussions that I have had to this point that the United<br />
States understands the sense in which we have pursued<br />
successfully, I think with dramatic success, the achievement<br />
of this treaty. They understand that it is regarded by us<br />
as totally compatible with our full treaty obligations with<br />
the United States. And knowing that I believe that we have<br />
a reasonable chance of success. And I certainly hope they<br />
will. I believe that the treaty as it stands, even without<br />
adherence from the metropolitan and nuclear super-powers is<br />
a very signi i an step forward. It obviously becomes the<br />
rore effective tdO'extent that we can get the adherence to the<br />
protocols of the metropolitan and nuclear super-powers.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, getting back to you for the<br />
moment. Your popularity has dropped fairly dramatically.<br />
You are now below Andrew Peacock in I think one of the<br />
most recent polls. Doe',, that worry you? It has always<br />
been assumed that you areopolitician who, I suppose, gets<br />
fired up by personal adulation. Is it true?<br />
PM: I don't get ' fired up by personal adulation. But<br />
obviously I would be less than honest if I didn't say that<br />
I would like to be higher. Obviously, any politician, including<br />
this one, would like to be as high in the polls as possible.<br />
But I have said that I am not going to chase popularity on<br />
the basis of avoiding the processes that have to be undertaken.<br />
And since the election the major preoccupations that I have had<br />
were, being involved in that very tortuous and~ as Isaynot<br />
very popular past-time of thinking about tax changes. And<br />
secondly, trying to screw out one and quarter billion in<br />
expenditure restraint. Now those two exercises are not<br />
calculated to have us shooting up the popularity charts.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you had some well publicised and<br />
highly visible personal problems late last year. And indeed<br />
you acknowledge that they affected your performance as<br />
Prime Minister. Now without wishing to go back over all<br />
that, we ask you are those problems cver?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: You are operating now at your best?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Back on top?<br />
PM.: I think getting better and better. I hope so.<br />
JOURNALIST: No more excuses?<br />
PM: You describedi it as an excuse. I would rather describe it as a reason.<br />
JOUIVALIST: Prirm Minister thank you very nuch. </p>
