PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UN~ TIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN CONSERVATION FOUNDATION'S<br />
NEW HEADQUARTERS<br />
MELBOURNE 11 DECEMBER 1989<br />
There is a healthy, vigorous debate in this country about<br />
our economy. Attention is rightly focussed on Australia's<br />
international debt. The country is said to be living beyond<br />
its means yet much of Australia's external deficit is<br />
financing the means to lift our productive capacity in the<br />
future; to earn export income and to replace imports.<br />
That we have so much investment coming through is viewed as<br />
bad news by some participants in the debate. True, if there<br />
were less investment, Australia's external deficit would be<br />
smaller, but so would our prospects for improved living<br />
standards in the future.<br />
I am not saying Australia's international indebtedness is<br />
not a problem, but it has to be kept in perspective. Just<br />
like going into debt to set up a business can be worthwhile,<br />
much of Au~ stralia's debt is good debt.<br />
Some of you may be thinking I've brought along the wrong<br />
speech and that this one was meant for a business seminar.<br />
I can assure you that what I have to say today is totally<br />
appropriate for the opening of the ACF's new headquarters<br />
and I'm delighted to have been asked to be here.<br />
My friends, Australia's international indebtedness has<br />
everything to do with the ACF and the interests you<br />
represent. You, like all Australians, want to see improved<br />
living standards in the future, a better quality of life.<br />
And we must have investment to achieve that. But what sort<br />
of investment?<br />
Today I want to talk about a broader concept of investment. </p>
<p>Investment has conventionally been thought of solely in<br />
terms of the opening of mines and oilfields, the setting up<br />
of factories and offices. But the central point I want to<br />
make today is that a very good investment, especially for<br />
Australia, can be to leave some places and things alone, to<br />
protect them rather than spoil them. Other good investments<br />
will involve developing our natural resources, but in a<br />
careful, environmentally sensitive way, and not exploiting<br />
them indiscriminately for short-term gain at the expense of<br />
long-term damage.<br />
Around the world there have been countless investments that<br />
were expected to and did produce a large financial<br />
return. The factories that polluted the atmosphere and the<br />
rivers, causing Europe's acid rain and killing Canadian and<br />
American waterways most of these no doubt were regarded as<br />
good investments by the relevant decision makers at the<br />
time. The Exxon Valdez was carrying a valuable cargo when<br />
it ran aground in Alaska.<br />
All good investments at the time. The trouble is, somebody<br />
forgot to count all the risks and all the costs. Who<br />
counted the environmental risks, the environmental costs?<br />
I'm not saying that none of these investments should have<br />
occurred. What I am saying is that many of them wouldn't<br />
have, or would have proceeded in a more environmentally<br />
friendly manner, if governments had been aware of all the<br />
costs and risks and had insisted on those costs being<br />
taken into account and stronger measures being taken to<br />
reduce the environmental risks.<br />
The consequence of these decisions is that present and<br />
future generations have to pay the costs that weren't<br />
properly taken into account in the first place.<br />
A great environmental debt has been accumulated by past and<br />
present generations and bequeathed to our children, and<br />
theirs, to pay.<br />
That debt is called acid rain. It is called the greenhouse<br />
effect. It is called thousands of extinct species. It is<br />
called salinity, soil degradation, beach pollution. It is<br />
called Bhopal, Chernobyl.<br />
Just a few years ago the level of broad community awareness<br />
of and concern about this burgeoning environmental debt was<br />
not high. Before the breakthroughs on arms control between<br />
the United States and the Soviet Union, many people thought<br />
there wouldn't be a world around too much longer for them to<br />
worry about. The threat of nuclear obliteration dominated<br />
most thinking about the earth's future. </p>
<p>But over the past few years, with nuclear tensions easing<br />
and with greater information coming to light about the<br />
global threats posed by greenhouse gases and CFCs, concern<br />
for the environment has spread from the preserve of a<br />
relatively few, seeking to protect a local river, beach or<br />
forest, to occupy the minds of people all around the world<br />
who would never have considered themselves to be greenies.<br />
It is this internationalisation of environmental problems<br />
that has stirred environmental concern around the globe and<br />
made people aware not only of these global problems but of<br />
how their local environment is being managed, or mismanaged.<br />
I know from personal experience that when I visited schools<br />
around Australia three years ago the kids spoke of the<br />
threat of nuclear war. Now they ask about trees, ozone and<br />
Kakadu. It is to their future, our children's future, that we in<br />
Government must look and assess the relevance of our<br />
economic and environmental policies.<br />
My Government welcomes and has encouraged investment. Some<br />
billion worth of investment in the pipeline has recently<br />
been documented by Access Economics, a measure of our<br />
success, a proud achievement. And we will continue to<br />
encourage investment including in mining and forestry. But<br />
we are not a Government that supports investment at any<br />
price. Yet there are, in our community, strong advocates of just<br />
that investment at any price. They argued for the<br />
Franklin Dam. They argued for the Wesley Vale Pulp Mill to<br />
proceed, pumping 13 tonnes of organochlorines into Bass<br />
Strait every day. They argue for mineral surveying in<br />
Kakadu National Park. They argue for logging the Queensland<br />
rainforests. They argue for sand mining at Shelburne Bay.<br />
They condemned my Government for World Heritage Listing the<br />
Lemonthyme and Southern Forests of Tasmania. They called my<br />
Environment Statement which announced a $ 320m landcare<br />
program, an endangered species program, a massive tree<br />
planting program and a dozen other important initiatives a<br />
political stunt.<br />
I refer, of course, to the Liberal and National Parties of<br />
Australia. Their leadership at one time or another has<br />
pledged to reverse just about every major decision my<br />
Government has made on the environment. They would not use<br />
the external affairs power which gave us the capacity to<br />
stop the Franklin Dam, protect the Tasmanian and Queensland<br />
forests, and Kakadu and they will not support a referendum<br />
on increased constitutional powers for the Commonwealth<br />
Government. </p>
<p>Their profound misunderstanding of the whole issue was<br />
vividly revealed in Parliament last month by Charles Blunt,<br />
the Leader of the National Party. He was giving the<br />
Government stick over Kakadu when he made the outstanding<br />
claim that Coronation Hill included palladium and platinum,<br />
but no gold. One of our members interjected to suggest gold<br />
was present but Blunt said " No gold, the Honourable Member<br />
is totally ignorant. He knows nothing about the issue at<br />
all". It's disturbing to have confirmed one's deepest suspicions<br />
that the Opposition's environmental views are based on<br />
ignorance and prejudice rather than on an informed,<br />
open-minded assessment of the issues.<br />
The Coalition and their backers have learned nothing about<br />
the environment. They have pledged economy before ecology.<br />
My Government's philosophy is one of ecologically<br />
sustainable development. It's not a matter of one or the<br />
other economy or ecology. They go hand in hand. That is<br />
why the Labor Government in Australia has created jobs at a<br />
rate twice as fast as the rest of the Western world, at the<br />
same time as advancing as the World Heritage Bureau has<br />
said World Heritage values more than any other country.<br />
In others words, Australia, under my Government, is a world<br />
pace setter both in encouraging development and protecting<br />
the environment. We in Government have proved that we can<br />
have both; we must have both.<br />
We will continue to assess the environmental risks of<br />
development projects. And we will encourage such projects<br />
where those risks are acceptable. But I will not compromise<br />
the quality of life of our children by playing Russian<br />
roulette with the environment. As Prime Minister I have a<br />
responsibility not only for present generations but for<br />
their children, and theirs.<br />
I am not prepared to take the easy course and convert<br />
Australia's economic debt into an environmental debt to be<br />
borne by our children.<br />
The sort of Australia I want to see in 20 or 30 years time<br />
is a country which is the envy of the rest of the world. In<br />
large measure it already is. But as the countries of<br />
Europe, America and our own region continue to have great<br />
difficulty in reversing the damage already done to their<br />
environments, I want their people to look to Australia and<br />
say " Look at the beautiful places down there, look at their<br />
wonderful coastline, their forests, their great National<br />
Parks. How did they manage to keep them unspoiled when we<br />
wrecked ours?" And I want those people to visit Australia,<br />
to see our great natural places, and tell others back home<br />
what a magnificent place Australia is. </p>
<p>Now that's an investment in Australia's future. Australia<br />
will, I believe, become one of the prime tourist<br />
destinations in the world. Did you know that in the seven<br />
years since this Government came to power, annual tourist<br />
arrivals have risen from less than a million to 2k million?<br />
And did you know that the Australian Tourist Commission is<br />
projecting an increase in overseas tourist arrivals from<br />
about 2 million in 1989 to 6.5 million by the year 2000, and<br />
an increase in tourist expenditure from $ 3.7 billion to<br />
$ 27.7 billion over the same period?<br />
Australia now has eight World Heritage sites. This month,<br />
we expect a further 600,000 ha of Tasmania's wilderness and<br />
scenic places will be accepted for World Heritage Listing.<br />
And I can announce here today Australia will be hosting next<br />
year's General Assembly of the World Heritage body, the<br />
International Union for the Conservation of Nature. This is<br />
a great honour for Australia and we are delighted to be able<br />
to host this very important meeting.<br />
Our common concern for the environment does not mean that we<br />
should go to the other extreme and adopt a no-growth<br />
strategy, other than tourist development. There is a place<br />
for environmentally-responsible development of Australia's<br />
natural resources; there is a real and legitimate place for<br />
those developments.<br />
Many areas do lend themselves to multiple land use but<br />
this must not, and will not under my Government, be a<br />
euphemism for pot-holing National Parks with mine pits or<br />
cutting down magnificent, pristine, native forests to have<br />
them replaced with re-growth forests that provide neither<br />
the habitat nor the integrity of virgin forests.<br />
I believe there is cause for optimism about the capacity of<br />
developmental interests to be reconciled with environmental<br />
interests in this country. Certainly the remarkable<br />
alliance between the ACF and the NFF, whose proposals to the<br />
Government on soil degradation were taken on board in my<br />
Environment Statement, demonstrates that traditional<br />
adversaries can become allies when economic and<br />
environmental imperatives coincide.<br />
So, too, is the Salamanca Agreement in Tasmania testimony to<br />
the capacity of traditional rivals in the forestry debate to<br />
become partners in both protection of the environment and<br />
the maintenance of jobs.<br />
The Salamanca Agreement is a model for forest agreements in<br />
the rest of Australia. More immediately, it is a model for<br />
the South-East Forests of New South Wales. My colleague,<br />
Peter Cook, has worked tirelessly in seeking a sensible<br />
resolution of this issue.<br />
My Government is concerned to protect the National Estate<br />
forests of South-East New South Wales but of course we<br />
also have a responsibility to maintain employment. </p>
<p>We are undertaking the most comprehensive study ever of the<br />
biological values of the National Estate as the basis of a<br />
long term conservation and industry plan in the region. We<br />
also have under way a number of important industry studies<br />
on the establishment of a flitchmill, on value-adding in the<br />
sawmilling industry and on better utilisation of smallwood,<br />
and on how best to get plantations under way in the region<br />
as soon as possible.<br />
Through these efficiency improvements and the identification<br />
of alternative forest areas outside the National Estate, I<br />
hope we can get to a position where the industry will not<br />
have to return to logging the existing National Estate<br />
forest areas in the South-East.<br />
Our chances of realising that hope are maximised if we can<br />
all work together on the problem. I am pleased that the<br />
South East Forest Alliance has agreed to be on the regional<br />
consultative committee that Peter Cook is establishing. We<br />
hope its inaugural meeting will be before Christmas.<br />
We want a co-operative resolution of this issue; that is<br />
always our preferred way. But I say again that should the<br />
New South Wales Government not abide by the agreement<br />
reached with them or not co-operate in a full examination of<br />
alternatives to logging the South East National Estate<br />
forests, my Government will bring down the full weight of<br />
its constitutional powers including the corporations power<br />
to achieve a solution.<br />
If we can have alliances between the ACF and the NFF on soil<br />
conservation and if we can have Salamanca style agreements,<br />
there must be scope for greater understanding and agreement<br />
on the future management of all our natural resources.<br />
That is why I convened a meeting last Thursday on<br />
ecologically sustainable development involving Phillip,<br />
representing the ACF, and representatives of the forest,<br />
agricultural and mining industries, and the Wilderness<br />
Society, together with my four Ministers most directly<br />
concerned with these issues, my Chief Scientist and<br />
Australia's Ambassador for the Environment.<br />
As a result of that meeting the Government will be<br />
circulating a paper on sustainable development, for comment.<br />
Then we will all consider the establishment of working<br />
groups to give practical application to the concept of<br />
sustainable development in agriculture, forestry, fisheries,<br />
mining, energy, manufacturing and tourism.<br />
Last Thursday's meeting was a first step, but an important<br />
one. Just to have representatives of such a diverse group<br />
of organisations traditionally the antagonists in the<br />
environmental debate is a good achievement. It is one on<br />
which I am confident we can all build. </p>
<p>Ecologically sustainable development will involve the<br />
environmentally sensitive development of our natural<br />
resources.' But it must also involve the reservation of<br />
particular areas where no commercial development is allowed.<br />
That has and will continue to be my Government's approach.<br />
And one great exclusion area that my Government has been<br />
working to secure is the entire continent of Antarctica.<br />
When my Government set out on the road in May this year to<br />
seek an international ban on mining in Antarctica we were<br />
given no chance of succeeding. Yet at the Paris meeting of<br />
Antarctic Treaty Parties in October, Australia and France<br />
achieved agreement to a special meeting to consider<br />
proposals for a Comprehensive Environment Protection<br />
Convention for Antarctica, establishing Antarctica as an<br />
International Nature Reserve.<br />
My Government has been criticised for taking our campaign to<br />
the people. I make no apology for appealing to public<br />
opinion for ultimately it will be the weight of<br />
international public opinion, not bureaucrats or<br />
politicians, which will decide this issue.<br />
We may not succeed within a year, but succeed ultimately we<br />
will with your help. As we in Government continue to<br />
press our case with other Governments, you must continue to<br />
mobilise international public opinion against mining in<br />
Antarctica. Apart from its value as the world's last great wilderness,<br />
Antarctica is a vitally important laboratory for measuring<br />
both the depletion of the ozone layer and the greenhouse<br />
effect. My Government has acted decisively to phase out the use of<br />
ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons. At the end of this<br />
month, the production and importation of aerosols and<br />
polystyrene foams containing CFCs will be banned. And<br />
within five years, we will have phased out nearly all CFC<br />
use. Just as we are acting on CFCs, so too are we working on<br />
limiting greenhouse gas emissions. We have devoted<br />
$ 7.8 million to greenhouse research; we are supporting the<br />
work of the International Panel on Climate Change; and we<br />
are taking an active role in the development of a Framework<br />
Convention on Climate Change.<br />
I believe there is enormous scope for energy conservation in<br />
Australia, and there is ample capacity for limiting<br />
emissions of greenhouse gases.<br />
Late last month some of my Ministers had the opportunity of<br />
talking to Amory Lovins, a leading energy expert from the<br />
United States. </p>
<p>I will be inviting Dr Lovins to return to Australia in early<br />
1990 so that he can meet with both environment and energy<br />
ministers from the Commonwealth, States and Territories, to<br />
discuss his strategies for abating global warming, with<br />
particular reference to our situation in Australia.<br />
I said in my Environment Statement that we will commission<br />
scientific investigations into the extent of reductions in<br />
greenhouse gas emissions that can be achieved; and that I<br />
will be inviting industry and conservation representatives<br />
to consider this work and make submissions in preparation<br />
for a meeting on this issue.<br />
Some important early work was discussed at the first meeting<br />
of my Science Council and I have just sent out a discussion<br />
paper to the ACF, other conservation groups and industry<br />
groups on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Australia.<br />
Commonwealth Departments have already been asked to commence<br />
discussions with State and local governments with a view to<br />
implementing options available immediately for reducing<br />
greenhouse gas emissions.<br />
I turn now to a matter that has been causing consternation<br />
among many of your members and the wider community the<br />
future of Jervis Bay. Already the EIS processes have thrown<br />
up a number of serious environmental impacts that would be<br />
associated with a move of the Sydney based naval fleet to<br />
Jervis Bay. Moreover, the costs of moving the Sydney fleet<br />
base to Jervis Bay would be very high indeed. We will be<br />
putting alternative sites to environmental and economic<br />
analysis. But I can inform you that the Government is no<br />
longer disposed to move the Sydney naval fleet to Jervis<br />
Bay.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Yours is a non-partisan organisation, its members united by<br />
issues rather than party political affiliation. That is<br />
exactly as it should be. Moreover your are, in my<br />
judgement, right to believe that the ACF needs to go on<br />
encouraging a wide ranging public concern about the<br />
environment so that any political party attuned to the views<br />
of the electorate will give weight to the environment in its<br />
policies. That is a sensible recognition by you of<br />
political reality.<br />
But another political reality is that in this country there<br />
are only two organisations which can form the Government,<br />
Labor and the Coalition and that on any objective reading<br />
of the evidence it is Labor, not the Coalition, which is<br />
committed to the preservation of our splendid natural<br />
environment. So you must not expect me, as a political<br />
leader, to be non-partisan; my role is to assert to you<br />
clearly that Labor is the right choice and is demonstrably<br />
the right choice. </p>
<p>Finally, I want to say a couple of words about the<br />
relationship between the ACF and the Government something<br />
which attracted considerable media interest following one<br />
long phone call in the lead-up to the Kakadu decision. In<br />
my view, the ACF is a constructive, sophisticated<br />
organisation. We do not agree on every issue. But the<br />
manner in which you make practical representations to my<br />
Government, and your willingness to give credit where credit<br />
is due, gives you both relevance and effectiveness.<br />
This close working relationship between the ACF and my<br />
Government has led to criticism by some environmentalists<br />
that the ACF is too close to the Government. Well if the<br />
charter of an environmental organisation is to protect and<br />
improve the environment, and through working with the<br />
Government the organisation advances that cause as the ACF<br />
has done then a true environmentalist can have no cause<br />
for grievance but instead must applaud your actions.<br />
I pay tribute to the ACF and its leaders, Phillip Toyne and<br />
Peter Garrett, I encourage you to continue your allimportant<br />
work in the professional and responsible manner in<br />
which you have conducted yourselves and I have pleasure in<br />
declaring open the new ACF headquarters. </p>
