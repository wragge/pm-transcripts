13 September 1984<br />
TEXT OF BY LEAVE ADDITION TO AN EARLIER ANSWER IN HOUSE OF<br />
REPRESENTATIVES AT ABOUT 6.25 P. M.<br />
Madam Deputy Speaker, during Question Time today I was asked<br />
a question concerning Mr. Peter Barron and a visit to The<br />
Age. The House will recall that I gave a very specific<br />
answer to that question and I want now, Madam Deputy Speaker,<br />
to add to that answer by indicating that the editor of The<br />
Age, as I understand, will be releasing this statement. He<br />
may already have done it. I now read it to the House in<br />
addition to the answer I gave and I ask particularly that<br />
members of the Opposition here present, particularly the<br />
Honourable Member for Boothby, should pay very clear attention<br />
to this statement from the editor of The Age. It is in these<br />
terms: " Mr. Peter Barron, Principal Adviser to the Prime Minister,<br />
came to see me last Thursday at his request. He did not<br />
lobby me about anything. He did not mention a High Court<br />
Judge or Ms. Junie Morosi or anything to do with a safe deposit<br />
box in a Swiss bank or any other bank. He did not ask me to<br />
suppress any story or to publish any story. In fact he did not<br />
ask me to do anything and he certainly did not threaten me. I<br />
do not know Mr. Steele Hall and to the best of my recollection<br />
I have never spoken to him, certainly not about any matter<br />
relating to a High Court Judge or Ms. Morosi."<br />
Now, Madam Deputy Speaker, you couldn't have a clearer or<br />
unequivocal statement from the editor of The Age in respect to<br />
a totally unfounded and scurrilous imputation by The Honourable<br />
Member for Boothy and I would conclude by addition to my answer,<br />
Madam Deputy Speaker by asking the Opposition and I am pleased<br />
to see the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in his place, that he<br />
should take steps to ensure that these totally unfounded<br />
insinuations and allegations should be brought to a halt. it<br />
is not merely, Madam Deputy Speaker, that it does no credit to<br />
the Opposition because that is a matter that is their concern.<br />
They have to deal with their stature and how they are going to<br />
be judged in the public mind, but what is clearly established<br />
now by this unequivocal statement from the editor of The Age<br />
is that that scurrilous innuendo involved in the question by<br />
The Honourable Member for Boothby is totally without foundation.<br />
It does the Honourable Member for Boothby no credit and one<br />
must presume that he speaks for the opposition when he raises<br />
these things and therefore it does no credit to the Opposition. / 2 </p>
<p>Now, more than that, as I say, the question of the stature<br />
of the Opposition is a matter for them, but the stature of<br />
this Parliament is a matter for concern to all of us,<br />
Madam Deputy Speaker. And it does this Parliament no credit<br />
at all that we should have responsible " allegedly"<br />
responsible leading member of the Opposition getting up in this<br />
place with these sorts of innuendos. It is in line with the<br />
behaviour that we have witnessed in this House this day and<br />
out of the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition. Now in no<br />
way, Madam Deputy Speaker, could you have a more specific<br />
unequivocal repudiation of the gutter tactics of the Opposition<br />
through the mouth of the Honourable Member for Boothby.<br />
And I conclude, Madam Deputy Speaker, by expressing the hope<br />
that the Member for Boothby, and through him the Leader of the<br />
Opposition, will have the decency now, having had that<br />
scurrilous, baseless innuendo and implication completely<br />
destroyed by the statement of the editor of The Age, that he<br />
will have the decency one can express the hope that there may<br />
just be a skerrick of decency left there that they will take<br />
this opportunity which I am sure I can provide now to make<br />
a statement in response to what I have had to say. </p>
