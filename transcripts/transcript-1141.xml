STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER. THE RT. HON.<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES, K. T. H Q. C. 3 M. P.~<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRSENTATIVES<br />
WEDNESDAY, 18TH AUGUST, 196~<br />
I wish to inform the House of two decisions<br />
concerning defence which have been taken by the Government.<br />
The first has to do with the strength of the<br />
Australian forces in Viet Nam. The Government has decided<br />
to provide support units to the Army battalion there to make<br />
it up to what is known as a Battalion Group. The support<br />
units, which involve about 350O troops, include artillery,<br />
engineer, armour, signal, light aircraft and logistic elements.<br />
Honourable members will have a full opportunity<br />
in the External Affairs debate which begins this evening to<br />
discuss the general situation in Viet Nam. All I wish to say<br />
at this time is that in recent months open aggression against<br />
the people and Government of South Viet Nam, instigated and<br />
sustained from the North, has continued to grow. U. S. assistance<br />
to South Viet Nam is being increased by the introduction<br />
of substantial additional forces whose purpose is to prevent<br />
a communist military victory in that country. It is important<br />
that the efforts of the South Vietnamese Government and the<br />
large contribution of the U. S. Government should be supplemented<br />
by assistance from other countries. At the same time, every<br />
political effort continues to be made to bring the issues in<br />
South Viet Nam to international discussion. It is our<br />
conviction that all these actions give the best prospect of<br />
opening the way ultimately to peace in South Viet Nam.<br />
The second decision taken by the Government<br />
concerns the size of the National Service intake. The intakes<br />
of National Servicemen will be retained at 2,100 each quarter<br />
in 1966 ( that is, a total of 8,400 during the year) instead of<br />
reducing them to 1,725 each quarter ( 6,900 during the year) as<br />
previously planned. The maintenance of the annual intake at<br />
the higher level of 8,400 will result in an Army strength of<br />
40,000 in 1967 instead of the previous figure of 37,500.<br />
The Government's decision has been taken in the<br />
light of the successful introduction of the National Service<br />
Scheme and bearing in mind all the various commitments. at<br />
home and abroad, which our forces might be required to<br />
undertake. It is a continuation of the Government's policy<br />
of taking measures as appropriate which will lead to steady<br />
improvement in our defence capability. </p>
