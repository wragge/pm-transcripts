PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AT THE OFFICIAL DINNER IN MOSCOW<br />
GIVEN BY PRIME MINISTER RYZHKOV<br />
MOSCOW MONDAY 30 NOVEMBER 1987<br />
A few weeks ago, the Soviet Union celebrated the<br />
Anniversary of its revolution. Seventy years ago, an<br />
American journalist described the events of that time as<br />
" ten days that shook the world"<br />
John Reed's words remind us that profound changes within<br />
countries as important as the Soviet Union have a meaning<br />
and impact far beyond their own borders.<br />
Today, words and phrases such as " glasnost" and<br />
" perestroika" ring loudly in your internal debate. But they<br />
also resonate in the rest of the world. I do not remember a<br />
time in my involvement in political and public life when the<br />
information media in Australia, 14,000 miles from the USSR,<br />
have been so filled with reports, analysis and argument<br />
about what is happening in your country, and conjecture<br />
about what it means not only for the Soviet Union but for<br />
all of us.<br />
For most of the past seventy years, East and West have been<br />
deeply divided. This division has reflected not just<br />
conflicting national interests, but fundamental differences<br />
over ideology. Many countries have made choices about where<br />
they stood in that division. Australia has chosen the<br />
values, traditions and interests of the West. Australia and<br />
the United States formed an alliance, an alliance which<br />
continues to exist today and is stronger than it has ever<br />
been. It is important that I say to you frankly that Australians<br />
do not see this as merely a military alliance but as a<br />
partnership based on shared liberal democratic values;' our<br />
deeply cherished values. iJ.*<br />

Given the long history of ideological divergence, it is riot<br />
helpful, perhaps dangerous, to believe that the East-West<br />
tension, distrust, and confrontation can disappear<br />
overnight. A hard lesson of the period of detente in the<br />
1970' s was that a false expectation that all can suddenly be<br />
sweetness and light between East and West will, when<br />
inevitably disappointed, lead to an even greater level of<br />
distrust and confrontation than before.<br />
But perhaps even more dangerous than such unrealistic<br />
expectations, is a cynicism set in concrete and steel, a<br />
cynicism that says that nothing ever really changes, that<br />
what has been and what is will always be. Such cynicism is<br />
ultimately a counsel of impotence and despair, a statement<br />
of disbelief in humanity's ability to make choices, and to<br />
strike out on new paths.<br />
When we look at what has happened in the world over the last<br />
years, we can see that change is not only possible, but<br />
is indeed the natural condition of mankind. While the force<br />
of nationalism has remained strong we have seen the emerging<br />
strength of multilateralism. Multilateralism itself is also<br />
changing, moving from an emphasis on security and political<br />
affairs to a recognition that there are many matters with<br />
which no one national state can deal alone. Such matters<br />
include economic affairs, poverty, human rights, racism,<br />
health, the environment and energy.<br />
So change can happen, fundamental change. The words that<br />
are used to describe that process of change are extremely<br />
important. For example, General Secretary Gorbachev's<br />
exposition of the theoretical basis of the Soviet approach<br />
to the world is extremely important, because his " new way of<br />
thinking" stresses the interdependence of nations and their<br />
essential mutuality of interest in survival rather than<br />
international class conflict.<br />
Important as are the words, however, even more important are<br />
the deeds.<br />
In the vital area of nuclear arms control and disarmament,<br />
we have seen important deeds in the last 18 moniths. we are<br />
about to see the conclusion of an INF Agreement, the first<br />
arms control agreement that will lead to an actual reduction<br />
in the number of nuclear weapons. Beyond its significance<br />
for Europe the agreement has a positive impact on security<br />
in the Asia-Pacific region. on behalf of my Government and<br />
the people of Australia I congratulate the Soviet Union and<br />
the United States on this historic achi. evement.<br />
We believe you share the view, however, that it should be<br />
only a beginning. We need to see achievements of similar<br />
magnitude in the much more threatening area of strategic<br />
arsenals, in chemical weapons, in conventional arms, in<br />
nuclear testing. many of these areas are extremely compl~ ex<br />
and involve important national security interests. But we<br />
are heartened by the seriousness of negotiations which are<br />
in train and the evident fact that East and West have come<br />
to share a commitment to achieving genuine progress in arms<br />
control. </p>
<p>3.<br />
I do not think, and I believe none of us thinks, that an end<br />
to East-West competition is in sight. The focus of<br />
attention must therefore be to manage competition, above all<br />
to ensure it remains peaceful.<br />
on regional problems, we are encouraged by your new<br />
readi -ness to engage in dialogue. But there is a long way to<br />
go. In particular the resolution of the situation in<br />
Afghanistan, encompassing the earliest possible withdrawal<br />
of Soviet troops and the implementation of the right of the<br />
Afghan people to choose their own form of Government, would<br />
give hope to those who see real possibilities of a new kind<br />
of relationship between East and West.<br />
The tragic situation in Kampuchea is of particular concern<br />
to Australia. The continued Vietnamese military presence<br />
there and the continued denial of the right to national<br />
sovereignty of the Kampuchean people represent the single<br />
major source of uncertainty in the South East Asian region.<br />
We have noted the wish expressed by the Soviet Union to play<br />
a more active and constructive role in the Asia-Pacific<br />
region.<br />
we think however, that the prospects for such a role by the<br />
Soviet Union will be greatly enhanced if you are able to<br />
contribute in a concrete way to resolving the Kampuchean<br />
situation. A genuinely constructive role in the region must<br />
comprise more than concepts and intentions.<br />
Australia of course has a particular interest in the South<br />
Pacific region. That region has of late begun to go through<br />
a period of dynamic change. There have been areas of<br />
difficulty. we would hope and expect the Soviet Union, in<br />
pursuing its rights to have normal diplomatic and commercial<br />
relations with the countries of the South Pacific, to keep<br />
very much in mind the need not to superimpose an East/ West<br />
dimension on the problems of the region. in this regard we<br />
place particular importance on the assurances given by<br />
Foreign Minister Shevardnadze during his visit to Australia<br />
earlier this year.<br />
As part of its new approach to foreign relations the Soviet<br />
Union has expressed greater interest in involvement in the<br />
global economy. We see this as a welcome development. No<br />
country can insulate itself from developments in the world<br />
economy. We will all ultimately be served by a trading<br />
system which encourages growth. We will all ultimately<br />
suffer from protectionism which can only result in economic<br />
stagnation. This is true for socialist countries, as for<br />
others. </p>
<p>I am glad that we have recently developed with the Soviet<br />
Union a much more constructive and genuine dialogue on<br />
matters of human rights and human contacts between people.<br />
We welcome the concrete measures that the Soviet Union has<br />
taken in these areas, particularly in cases involving<br />
Australia. As we have said many times these issues of human<br />
rights transcend national boundaries and are in many ways<br />
the touchstone of whether a new era of East/ West relations<br />
will be realised. We do not intend our discussions with you<br />
on this issues to be antagonistic, but you will know that<br />
they are and will continue to be an essential element in our<br />
relationship.<br />
Australia wants to have a relationship with the Soviet Union<br />
which is fruitful across the whole range of areas where<br />
there is a mutual interest. It is therefore pleasing that<br />
our relationship has developed substantially in the last<br />
several years. We want very much to strengthen our economic<br />
and commercial ties and we will be signing during the course<br />
of this visit a new program for the development of trade and<br />
economic cooperation. We hope this will lead to an<br />
expansion of economic exchanges between us on a firm<br />
long-term footing and I stress that we want this to be an<br />
expansion of trade in both directions.<br />
We welcome the moves the Soviet Government is making in the<br />
management of your economy, including the openings for joint<br />
ventures and other forms of cooperation they are of great<br />
interest to us. It is a reflection of our interest in<br />
economic relations with you that many of Australia's leading<br />
business people have joined me in Moscow and I want them and<br />
their Soviet counterparts to take mutual advantage of these<br />
developments.<br />
We are also concluding agreements on medial research, space<br />
science, and sport, which illustrate our interests in<br />
regular and substantive contact.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, fundamental to all these areas, whether<br />
it be developing bilateral relations, addressing regional<br />
problems, promoting human rights or advancing the cause of<br />
arms control is better communication between Governments,<br />
between social systems, between individuals.<br />
I speak to you tonight on the eve of a summit meeting<br />
between General Secretary Gorbachev and President Reagan.<br />
This is international communication of the highest<br />
importance not just for the two superpowers but for all<br />
nations. In this sense, while we are not present in the<br />
room, we are all participants in the process.<br />
One Summit will not solve everything but it is part of a<br />
process, the ultimate stakes of which are the survival of<br />
mankind. At the highest level both the Soviet Union and the<br />
United States have recognised as the ultimate goal a world<br />
without nuclear weapons. I </p>
<p>During the last 40 years we have slowly and steadily built<br />
for ourselves a nuclear scaffold. If humanity should ever<br />
stand on that scaffold whether through crisis,<br />
miscalculation or accident and if it should turn to look<br />
its executioner in the face, it will see itself.<br />
We must never let this happen. We must seek to dismantle<br />
the nuclear scaffold and we must do so without destroying<br />
our own security in the process.<br />
For our part Australia will continue to play a full and<br />
active role in encouraging arms control measures which<br />
enhance security and encourage progress towards the<br />
objective of nuclear disarmament.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, this is the fifth time I have visited the<br />
Soviet Union. 4From my preparations for the visit and from<br />
the discussions which we had today I have sensed a renewal<br />
of purpose and openness to dialogue. This not only gives my<br />
visit special interest at this time but gives me cause for<br />
hope that old barriers will give way to new opportunities<br />
for closer communication and co-operation between us.<br />
I wish to thank you and your colleagues for your most<br />
generous welcome and for the opportunity my visit provides<br />
for open and beneficial discussion of the many subjects of<br />
interest and of concern to our two countries. </p>
