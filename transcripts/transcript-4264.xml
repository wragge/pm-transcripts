ADDRESS TO THEl MFLBOURNE CEQ41E3R OF C( ObHIMERC1E<br />
Thank you for.-Your ir4vitation to address you this evenang.<br />
I am glad to*-have this opportunity to discuss with -you the,<br />
Governmnmt's-think\ ing on a number of import'ant. is'sues.<br />
The principal' concern of us all at the moment is economic<br />
: recovery. Throughout th-is year the Governiment bas given top<br />
pririt tothe fight against inflation. Until i-nf: Lato<br />
is-brought under ' control -there -will be no solution to the<br />
' problem-of unemploymrent-.<br />
inflation is-, the g-; re-atest. single enemy of individual<br />
security, of : Jobs, of a'resumption of economic growth, and<br />
of our interna -tional competitiveness.<br />
The attack on'ainflation has been. based on~ a strategy o f.<br />
restrai-nt in -Government spending and restraint in wage . an d<br />
salary-incrcases. With cooperation from all sections of the<br />
community thereare now Clear signs that the, battle is being<br />
' Won. The%-Consumer: Price Index increased by 2.2 percent in t he<br />
, Septemher quiarter, the lowest quarterly -increase, iwith t-he<br />
exception of the MedibanR abe rration, since tbe Muirch<br />
quarter in 1973-There wiji be an apparent break in this<br />
i-mproving trend in thc Dlecember quarter as the changos to Hedibank<br />
affect the C. P. I. The community has to pay for its health servicet<br />
in one form or-anotber.. We should not be diverted from that<br />
fund-amental falct by focussing on one index. With continued<br />
good'sense prevailing in wage determainations the December result<br />
will only briefly obscuru it continuing trend to lower rates<br />
of inflation.<br />
This in turn will cteate the conditions in -which a signifi cant<br />
da~ cline in-Imempioymcnt can come about. Let me emphasise<br />
that our coincern with uneinploymcnt is one of ' the major reuasons<br />
why wo -arc pressing the attack on inflation so strongly.<br />
S-ome apparenflt3y believe that we should relax the pressure<br />
on inflation and should incr'ease Government spending, in the hope<br />
thut wn~ employment can be brought down morve rapidly. This<br />
Jp) L lr-UlJ1~ i t. If t-hc : xci C ! i 0 t 1 a-ST filw )' Zr<br />
has tautght us a. n-yt'-Thiag it has surely demuonstrated that the_<br />
condi tioxniso w f~ i Aust-ralia, higher Govanil~ OYtsedn<br />

<p>Z.<br />
can -actually be -associatted with Worsening<br />
tin emlyieit In one year imder Labor Fcderal Government<br />
spenld. ing rose -by 46%-and unemploym~ ent by almost<br />
200000-. almost 200(, 000 in one year.<br />
While action can certainly be tknto ease the problemn of<br />
uncmploy-nexit in the shiort torm -and we are taking such ac-tion<br />
it real solution will only bt found when iinflationi is beaten.<br />
If tihe Govornmert tried tko hasten the growth in activity and<br />
eMplo0yment bV" pumP Priming" this ' would quickly show 11p in<br />
more inflation-* n -at best,, only ttemporary reductions<br />
t. n unemployment...,<br />
The'-approach we ; ire flow foilowing..; in -Justralia is the course<br />
which:: has. been tak en in virtually all the major industrial<br />
countri es. In-the light of th experience of recent years<br />
it S~ wcepted that,.. the growth ofGovernment spending<br />
muset. tbw-e-nc tt hbec k astfisal ~ d he. preentone.<br />
The-. Uni ted. Kingdomn has. cut back the raeo0rwho eta<br />
Government s pen di ng from 28% to l7 Canada from 19 to 1M,;<br />
Gem v-ny from .19 -to N1-w Zealand from 2-4 to 5t; United<br />
States from 113-' to 1114; . Australia frtom 23 to l~<br />
As I . said earlier. there are now clear signs that that.<br />
strategy is.-working. The ultimate stuccess of this strategy<br />
is goinpg to-depend, however, not only on what the Government<br />
does, but -On: the actions and attitudes of both managlement an&amp; l<br />
emnployees.. No section of the communi ty can adopt is attitudes, or act,<br />
in isolation from t1. he rest of the comwity.<br />
It is -a very shortsighted view to thinrk that one group can<br />
prosper by depressing the condition-of another. We are all<br />
interdependent, and if we want. Australia ' to recover -and prosper<br />
w-have to be prepared to work : together to achieve that result-.'<br />
Both trade u~ nion leadership and management carry a heavy<br />
responsibility for creating the conditions-which will lead<br />
to a soundly based recovery<br />
Trade union leaders can do much to ease the problem of<br />
unemployment by helping-to restrain wage and salary demnands.<br />
ThiS . r * estraint, m akes possible conditions in which, inadustry and<br />
commerce. can provide desperately needdid jobs. The social<br />
responsibility-: of trade unions in present ci-rcumstances extends<br />
of course ' well beyond the c-ontainmient of wag'e and salary<br />
demands-to reasonable levels. It encompasses rejectionof<br />
unreasonable strikes of all kinds -of political strikes<br />
strikes . resulting from inter-union disputes whicliraise costs,<br />
inhibit production, and destroy more job OPPO-tunities.<br />
One crucial p) oint wh'-ich needs to be made again and again is that<br />
both employees and. managlament as well as thf-Public at large<br />
have an ovor-riding common interest -in a profitable, efficicnt<br />
-and productive sector. </p>
<p>whatever differences there-may be arising over padrtictuar<br />
mattors -from time -to time, iIn cir TCUMstaces such as<br />
the presen-t we must all work to see that this common interest<br />
has ai deciSiVe Voice. There has been a great deal of<br />
ill1-conceived-talk about tha Government's policy on real wage,,.<br />
Vhere IS 011c central point htere which must not be obscure * d:<br />
if real wages, are to incecase without somieone else bceing<br />
worse off there 1) as to be Lan incroase in prodluctioi3. The<br />
bust guarante-of rising real wages -is a profitablc private<br />
sector suppotting a growing economy.._<br />
Achieving this is -not just a Job for the Government -bt<br />
insofar as Government policy can create thvewneessary conditions<br />
that * is what.-our policy is designed to do. Our policy : Ls<br />
des_-igned to bring ab-out conditions in which r~ al wages can begin<br />
to rise ag,-in-in t-he Shortest possible ' Lime. Polic~ ies<br />
. dosignd to increase wage and salary costs in the short termn<br />
run directly,. counter to the -interests of the: great majority<br />
of loage, and salary earners and reveal a contemptuous disregard<br />
of the plight of the unemployed.<br />
i RLnow-I-do not.-have to cemphasise to the M~ embers of thi s<br />
chamber the. great importance of communicating and d-iseulssing<br />
the facts about the frete tuiterprise system directly with<br />
employee-s.. Part of the responsibility for this present crisis<br />
rests with those of us who have done too little in the past<br />
to get the message across that thc free enterprise system<br />
is eas-ily-the best systeii for every Australian.<br />
Not only dues it provide ch~ oice of jobs, of industry, of employe r,<br />
of product and, service, through the profit and loss system<br />
it provides the consumer with more influence over the whole<br />
pattern of production than any other system.<br />
It is an important tL-ask not only. for Goverment, but also for<br />
managemirent, to commnuncate * the facts about bow the economic . system<br />
ioriks. A managem-ent concerned to discuss these matters with<br />
its own employees as many now are is wvorking not only ill its<br />
own interests, but in the interests of its eployees and the commun<br />
at large.<br />
The fight against inflation would be greatly helped if a13<br />
cornpanics made a practice of discussing with their employees<br />
bow-inflation affects the business,, the ctxomp~ aniy. s-trading record<br />
and the prospects. and conditions for new investment. and<br />
consequently -more employment.<br />
ID. the end, unions, companies an d employees find their<br />
justification in the service they provide to others.<br />
They have, no absolute right to exist apart . from this.<br />
It is inevitable and proper that in this age ofgown<br />
intordependcncc thero should he a conce~ rn with the wider social<br />
vespns'iilitics of both trade unionis and businesses. Sca<br />
responsibility dous not only imply that busine-rises should sclj<br />
to Eu; Ol)' good* s an-1 . erv:( cperso fitably and efficiently,<br />
and thnat trade unions shoul-d Se~ to imaprove to the best of the; ijr </p>
<p>ability, the waa % odtin of hermebs-<br />

ac. ti vities will be unidertaken with. ful1l recgarcl to t11eir<br />
efi-ects on other members Of the organIsation and the<br />
puul ic. beyond..<br />
The age when aniy action , qas justifie-d if it : led to a prof it<br />
has long. since gone if it cvcr existed. The age<br />
wh'en anything was justifiel Iif it led to another victory<br />
focir thbe inionshould also have gone.<br />
People rightly-det . iand now that both business anid unions<br />
rc~ gnsethey are part of a COM1u1nity and that they must be<br />
concerned with + the impact of their actions on other3U People in.<br />

Mr Whitlam has recently indicated that be~ b Ieeves so cially<br />
Ccncrned Unionism must inevitably use the weapop of the<br />
political strile. This is a fundamental misundestriding of<br />
the social responsibilities of trade undins. Treis nothi-ng<br />
socially resppnasible about using. irtinidatiop in a vain ef fort<br />
to impose the will. of a few mili tant union leaders on the<br />
elected democratic institutions of the country. There is<br />
nothing socially responsible about stri~ es whiuh cause direct<br />
loss . to. ofteIa-unwilling. mem; bers and simply ensure that unernploy,.<br />
will. stay at. high. leve-is.<br />
Social responsibility consists inparticipating in the demnocra-.<br />
debateoon policy along, with all other people -not trying to<br />

W&amp; cannot, dont and will not-. have decisionas sdintetr<br />
Earlier leaders of the+ Lab~ or Party like Chificy took a very<br />
dif ferent attitude to the responsibIli ties of the trade union<br />
m~ ovement. We are all aware that some powerful unions zare<br />
presently controlled by officials who do not support the<br />

The legiSlation. we have in-troduced to requirt stecret postal<br />

It places a powerful weapon in tbhe hands of union members who<br />

<p>Government of course has very significant responsibi-lities<br />
in this area. Policy rD-le of the Depa-rtumeftt of smmgna~ o<br />

In the case of migrants, FOr examPle, Only a few employars<br />

are almost invariably published in English, despite the<br />

themselves and their migranit members they Can hardly claim to'<br />
be adequately urepresenting those nmembers. When we can see<br />
that appreciably more an-Ion office holders and more delegates<br />
* at union conferences are migrants, then we will be able to say<br />
tbat.. trade unions-have a greater claim ' to represent their total<br />
membership. Wage issues are no~ t the only important issues facing the union<br />
Move-Ment. There are nany other matters which affect the working<br />
lives of members. Inadequate cmphasas has so far been given to<br />

" Social responsibility" refers principally to the concern we are<br />

meaning to. that concern.<br />
* Unfottunately in recent years recognition of socital -responsiil-ity<br />
