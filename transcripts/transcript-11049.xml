<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  On behalf of the Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia, I am</p>
<p>   pleased to bestow upon Mr Nelson Mandela an Honour in the Companionship</p>
<p>   of the Order of Australia.</p>
<p>  DAVID CONNOLLY:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister I present to you Mr Nelson Mandela who has been appointed</p>
<p>   an Honorary Companion in the General Division of the Order of Australia</p>
<p>   for Services to Australian-South African relations and for his outstanding</p>
<p>   leadership in bringing multi-racial democracy to South Africa.</p>
<p>  [Prime Minister bestows insignia upon Mr Mandela]</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  You get two politicians in the same room and they compete for who speaks</p>
<p>   first!</p>
<p>  Mr Nelson Mandela; David Connolly, the Australian High Commissioner in South</p>
<p>   Africa; Mrs Connolly; Ministers of the South African Government; Mrs Helen</p>
<p>   Suzman, a former very distinguished member of the South African Parliament;</p>
<p>   ladies and gentleman.</p>
<p>  This is a very special and precious ceremony for many Australians and many</p>
<p>   South Africans. Many exaggerated words are used about men and women and</p>
<p>   their contribution to the world and their contribution to the relief of</p>
<p>   human suffering. But the words of praise that have been uttered by so many</p>
<p>   in relation to Nelson Mandela are, in every sense, truly justified. He is</p>
<p>   in every sense of the word a man of this century.</p>
<p>  He is a person whose moral and physical courage inspired a nation. He is</p>
<p>   a person whose leadership brought together people who it was never conceived</p>
<p>   could work together in peace and love and in harmony.</p>
<p>  For somebody such as myself and the Australians present who have never known</p>
<p>   anything other than the proposition that all people are born equal, and</p>
<p>   that equal opportunity is available to all, because that has been the experience</p>
<p>   of our homeland, it is beyond understanding for us how a person who suffered</p>
<p>   as much as did Mr Mandela, has nonetheless displayed such incredible grace</p>
<p>   and dignity and moral leadership in his responsibilities. And in the process</p>
<p>   has set an example to the world.</p>
<p>  His deeds are well known. The contribution he has made to bringing about</p>
<p>   a multi-racial, democratic South Africa is acclaimed around the world. His</p>
<p>   moral example is without peer in our generation, and importantly for us</p>
<p>   today, because this is an Australian South African celebration, it is appropriate</p>
<p>   to acknowledge the links between our two countries. And I would like on</p>
<p>   this occasion to pay tribute to two of my predecessors, Malcolm Fraser and</p>
<p>   Bob Hawke, from opposite sides of the political divide within Australia,</p>
<p>   that both of them played a determined role in bringing about change in South</p>
<p>   Africa. And both of them on this occasion would like, I know, me to speak</p>
<p>   on their behalf to express their respect and admiration to Nelson Mandela</p>
<p>   and for what he represents. He has done great things for mankind. He has</p>
<p>   done great things for South Africa.</p>
<p>  What he has achieved since his release from detention not so long ago is</p>
<p>   quite remarkable. And I have had the opportunity on this, my first visit</p>
<p>   to this beautiful country, to spend some time with his successor, Thabo</p>
<p>   Mbeki at the Commonwealth Conference and to marvel at the progress that</p>
<p>   has been made in building the new South Africa, and marvel at the way in</p>
<p>   which so many daunting challenges have been overcome.</p>
<p>  There are many things about Nelson Mandela's life that have touched different</p>
<p>   people in different ways. And as is so often the case in our human experience,</p>
<p>   it is the symbolic gestures at the right time and in the right place with</p>
<p>   the right sense of occasion that really leave an indelible impression upon</p>
<p>   us. And I think many of us will remember that remarkable symbolic gesture</p>
<p>   by Nelson Mandela in donning that number six jersey belonging to Francois</p>
<p>   Pienaar after South Africa had won the World Cup in rugby only four years</p>
<p>   ago. It touched the heart of many people who had been of another and different</p>
<p>   political view from Mr Mandela and it was truly a symbolic gesture of a</p>
<p>   truly uniting national leader.</p>
<p>  I am especially grateful that Mr Mandela has allowed his name to be leant</p>
<p>   to the fellowships, the awards which are given to gifted young South African</p>
<p>   students and academics and they will henceforth be known as the Mandela</p>
<p>   Awards.</p>
<p>  Although he is no longer President, he has continued to play a very active</p>
<p>   role in bringing his great moral influence to bear in world affairs. And</p>
<p>   I am especially grateful for what he did in his discussions with Xanana</p>
<p>   Gusmao, the East Timorese leader and also the strenuous efforts that he</p>
<p>   undertook to secure the release of Peter Wallace and Steve Pratt, the two</p>
<p>   Australian CARE workers who were so unjustly imprisoned in Belgrade.</p>
<p>  So to you Mr Mandela you are a great man of this century. You are a person</p>
<p>   whose moral leadership, your moral depth, your political skill, your compassion,</p>
<p>   your capacity for forgiveness and reconciliation have given to the world</p>
<p>   an example that I don't think in our lifetime we will see again. So it is</p>
<p>   a particular privilege for the Government and the people of Australia that</p>
<p>   you have been pleased to accept the honorary award as a Companion of the</p>
<p>   Order of Australia. It is the highest award in the Order of Australia and</p>
<p>   I can think of no more fitting citizen of the world to receive that award</p>
<p>   than Nelson Mandela. I thank you for what you have done for your country</p>
<p>   and for your example to all of mankind. Thank you.</p>
<p>  MR NELSON MANDELA:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister Howard, I find it very difficult to address you in that manner.</p>
<p>   I prefer the usual way in which I speak to you to say John, but I don't</p>
<p>   know whether the Australians will forgive me if I become so familiar to</p>
<p>   you.</p>
<p>  I remember that shortly after I had been released from prison, I visited</p>
<p>   Australia. A program was arranged for me and I was very happy indeed to</p>
<p>   look at it. As I was carrying out this program I received a delegation from</p>
<p>   the aborigines and they asked me "who gave you the right to come here?"</p>
<p>   I said, well, I was invited you know by the Government. And they said "well</p>
<p>   you know this is our country." I said well, I'm sure it is - your country</p>
<p>   as well. And they say "now you must come and visit us in our area." I had</p>
<p>   to negotiate because they were very angry and I went to see them. And I</p>
<p>   said to them that I am very sorry that I came there without permission but</p>
<p>   at the same time I would like to say to that we have been arguing about</p>
<p>   these questions in South Africa, but what we decided to do was to stop the</p>
<p>   argument and to go to our enemies at the time and say let's sit down and</p>
<p>   talk. And I said you make my task easy if you go to the Government and talk</p>
<p>   to them and arrange what should happen when you invite somebody like me</p>
<p>   to you country.</p>
<p>  Now when I was told about this award, I thought of my younger days when</p>
<p>   I was running around the hills of my village. At that time we thought that</p>
<p>   Australia was another name for Sir Don Bradman. And we didn't know Australia</p>
<p>   at all. Later of course we came to know about eminent citizens of Australia</p>
<p>   like Sir Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke, as John has said, and now of course,</p>
<p>   the man who cracks the whip is here.</p>
<p>  Now you have referred to the Rugby World Cup in 1995. I want to start there,</p>
<p>   because I want to show that we are equal. If you remember the very first</p>
<p>   match was between South Africa and Australia and the Australians were the</p>
<p>   reigning champions at the time. And I went to see our boys at Silver Mine</p>
<p>   in Cape Town where they were stationed. And I said to our captain, Francois</p>
<p>   Pienaar that the team that wins this match will go right through to the</p>
<p>   final. And I said that the entire South Africa is behind you and that we</p>
<p>   expect you to take that honour. And I was very happy indeed that we were</p>
<p>   able to win, although I almost collapsed because of tension. Because I have</p>
<p>   never seen a game against the All Blacks where there were no tries. And</p>
<p>   where it was all penalties. And I think that it was when I was about to</p>
<p>   collapse, that Stransky had a drop goal and that made the day for us.</p>
<p>  But when Sir Malcolm Fraser asked me to intervene in Yugoslavia and get</p>
<p>   your two journalists released, I was very much embarrassed because hardly</p>
<p>   two weeks before that President Milosevic had asked me to come and pay a</p>
<p>   state visit and asked me to condemn the strikes by NATO. I didn't know that</p>
<p>   Sir Malcolm Fraser would ask me to undertake this type of mission. I wasn't</p>
<p>   very polite to President Milosevic because I indicated that he was responsible</p>
<p>   for what was happening there and I wouldn't come. Now I had to come back</p>
<p>   to him and say please can you release those two? It was very difficult.</p>
<p>   I suspect that had not her Majesty the Queen and Pope John Paul not worked</p>
<p>   with me, I would not have succeeded, and perhaps the greater thanks, more</p>
<p>   thanks should be addressed to them and not myself. I still played a very</p>
<p>   small role.</p>
<p>  Now it is always difficult to find the right words on occasions of this</p>
<p>   nature, but relations between Australia and South Africa can only be described</p>
<p>   by words intimate, and there is a wide variety of ties between us which</p>
<p>   I will not go into. But during the war, the Second World War, I had decided</p>
<p>   that I would never join. But the only occasion when I had doubts whether</p>
<p>   I was doing the right thing or not was when the Australian troops passed</p>
<p>   though Cape Town. Their behaviour, because this is the past, because at</p>
<p>   the time we were so hostile to the South African army, that the very thought</p>
<p>   of participating in a war where South Africa was involved was revolting.</p>
<p>   But when we saw the Australian soldiers, the way they condemned racism and</p>
<p>   the way they moved amongst us and visited some of our schools, made me feel</p>
<p>   that I ought to be next to these men when fighting fascism. But those days</p>
<p>   are long passed, but I still cherish the memories of the contact with Australian</p>
<p>   soldiers and I am very grateful indeed, John, for this honour.</p>
<p>  There are many men here and women here who, when I was President, when they</p>
<p>   met me or passed me by they would bow. When the days were close for me to</p>
<p>   step down, they would hardly look at me. It is worse now, and I hope that</p>
<p>   by giving me this honour, they will give me some amount of respect. And</p>
<p>   thank you very much for the honour. It means a great deal not only to me</p>
<p>   and my family, but to the entire South Africa because it is not one individual</p>
<p>   who is responsible for the praise that you have showered on one. We are</p>
<p>   basically a team, collective leadership and there is hardly anything any</p>
<p>   one of us does that has not been discussed before, very thoroughly by the</p>
<p>   leadership of the organisation and an individual is merely there to articulate.</p>
<p>   So the men and women that you should thank are sitting down there. They</p>
<p>   have made even a greater contribution than myself, but I hope that they'll</p>
<p>   allow me to keep this medal on their behalf. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  We'll now have a toast....All right, well everybody has got to have a drink.</p>
<p>  MR MANDELA:</p>
<p>  Well, you know I don't drink champagne, I don't drink wine. The only thing</p>
<p>   I drink is rum.</p>
<p>  MR CONNOLLY:</p>
<p>  Ladies and gentlemen will you please be upstanding and join us in drinking</p>
<p>   a toast.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I would like all to join in drinking to the health of a great man, Mr Nelson</p>
<p>   Mandela. Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>  MR MANDELA:</p>
<p>  May I respond, by asking you to raise your glasses to a really great man,</p>
<p>   John Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia.</p>
