A<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 16 FEBRUARY 1983<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE AT HAI( OAH CLUB<br />
HAWKE'S POLICY SPEECH<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Australian Labor Party comes forward<br />
with a policy that would in a sense have made Mr Whitlam appear<br />
like a scrooge because it's $ 2,750 million that's additional<br />
spending and as always, when the Labor Party says they're<br />
going to spend, spend, spend, they don't really say where the<br />
money is going to come from, Mr K( eating said they could get<br />
it from the ban" s but how get it from the banks? By putting<br />
up interest rates and damaging small businesses and home buyers<br />
and everyone else who is dependent upon bank finance or just by<br />
passing some law so they could direct the banks to invest in<br />
government-nominated exercises?<br />
That, would be extraordinarily damaging<br />
for many people, many small businesses and home builders and<br />
home buyers right throughout the country. Labor is<br />
thoroughly deceitful in its approach.<br />
if it's just a question of printing money, that adds to inflation<br />
as indeed the Labor programs always have. Mr Whitlam increas; ed<br />
expenditure by 46% in one of his years. I'm told it's Mr Hawke's<br />
ambition to try and exceed that particular record. well if that<br />
ever happened, it would be doing something that would be<br />
enormously damaging to Australia and all Australian families.<br />
We're still left with a policy without a policy. we had an<br />
economic policy last ' week which was meaningless because it was<br />
barren. There was nothing in it except the ultimate expendituire<br />
figure and an admission that their policies would cause a balance<br />
of payments crisis. But now we have a policy document but we stil]<br />
don't have that prices and incomes policy. I would have thought<br />
that in developing a prices and incomes policy for Australians,<br />
you would go to a country which in many ways is most like Australia<br />
namely the United Kingdom and see how the experience of the prices<br />
and incomes policies had worked in the United Kingdom. Blut in<br />
fact Mr Hawke denied on a television program that there had been<br />
such a policy in the United Kingdom and then it was left to the<br />
ex-British Labor Minister who had been responsible for administering<br />
that policy to say Mr Hawke did not know what he was taik) i. n9 about.<br />
But again the Australian public are asked to buy a policy with it~ s<br />
lynch-pin totally and absolutely missing and when it does appear<br />
it will be tinsel without anything underneath the wrapping paper.<br />
And I believe that these policies have been very hurriedly put<br />
together. I don't know how much Mr Hayden has had to do with it<br />
but I find it hard to see how he could support the spending<br />
proposals that Labor has put forward. Because those proposals; </p>
<p>have and will guarantee that Labor will lose this election<br />
on March<br />
But on the prices and incomes policy, since it has been so<br />
important to their general policy, since Mr Hawke has been<br />
responsible for developing that policy with the trade unions<br />
one would at least thought he knew what he was talking about.<br />
And it was here on a television program and the response from<br />
Mrs Williams, Mrs Shirley Williams in the United Kingdom, it<br />
is plain that he hadn't done his homework and did not know<br />
what in fact he was talking about.<br />
I'm quite certain that people will understand that the total<br />
expenditure proposals that Labor is putting forward or<br />
reductions in revenue that includes the tax point will mean<br />
great damage and harm to Australia and Australian families.<br />
Because they know the big spending approach can't work. It<br />
can't work in your own family expenditure. The family can't<br />
spend more than they have and certainly not for more than a<br />
very short period and the same would go with the kind of<br />
policies that Mr Hawke is trying to espouse.<br />
But there's one other element of policy which I have before me<br />
on page 32 where Mr Hawke tries a massive confidence trick where<br />
he says the essential elements of Australian defence and foreign<br />
policy have taken on a policy of bipartisanship inconceivable<br />
before then. Well where is the bipartisanship? In supporting the<br />
force in the Sinai? Mr Hawke has said that force is to be<br />
withdrawn irrespective of its consequences on the rest of the<br />
force, irrespective of the fact that it was plainly because of<br />
the essential nature of the task our people undertake<br />
immense difficulties for the other members of the force and<br />
maybe for the continuity of the force itself. And if you<br />
remember what the Labor Party has said about Afghanistan, if<br />
you remember what they said about ANZUS, how can they say that the<br />
essential elements of foreign policy are the same. Because<br />
they quite bluntly are not. Mr Hawke, unless there are a few<br />
R. J. Hawke's in the country, should be challenged as to why he<br />
signed that document calling for an end to ANZUS some little<br />
while ago and calling for a non-aligned foreign policy.<br />
He's changed policies many times through the ten days of this<br />
election. Which Mr Hawke should be believed?<br />
Question: ( inaudible)<br />
Mr Fraser<br />
We cut taxes substantially in the last budget. Those tax cuts<br />
are flowing through and what people are going to have to focus on<br />
are the total expenditure programs of the Australian Labor<br />
Party on their figures. It has been so vague up to the<br />
point where nobody can check whether their figures were valid<br />
or not and it's just not on. The people of Australia are<br />
not going to fall for this three card trick.<br />
Question on the proposed referendum in the industrial relations area,<br />
what enforcement provisions would be foreseen in the essentl. a<br />
services legislation? </p>
<p>3.<br />
Mr Fraser<br />
Well, there are a variety of approaches that can be adopted f017<br />
that. Many of them are on the statute books as you know.<br />
But the important feature would be to enable it to give the<br />
Arbitration Commission itself power to secure the agreement<br />
of its own awards and determinations.<br />
Question But when would the government be able to invoke such<br />
legislation?<br />
Mr Fraser<br />
At the times it was necessary to protect the people of<br />
Australia. We have all seen on many occasions times when<br />
Australian unions have done a great deal of damage to Australia<br />
and to Australian industries. And it is time it stopped.<br />
Question ( inaudible)<br />
Mr Fr~ aser<br />
No. We're talking about industries where the dispute has gone<br />
beyond state boundaries.<br />
Question Your visit to the Kirby factory this morning. Does that indicate<br />
a Prime Ministerial seal of approval for the wage cuts that<br />
that company has put on, and would you be suggesting or even<br />
encouraging firms to take wage cuts, or to put wage cuts into action.<br />
Mr Fraser<br />
You have an example there of a firm of employees working together,<br />
to see that the firm can survive, to see that they can go on<br />
producing. That is to be commended. Our policy is for the<br />
wage pause and for the maintenance of the wage pause. That<br />
particular company and its employees made a decision to go further,<br />
that's their decision made in the light of the economic<br />
circumstances of the firm. But the important thing about it<br />
was the determination of management and employees to work together<br />
to overcome difficulties. That is what should be commended.<br />
In relation to BHP I put to Neville Wran and to Mr B~ annon 1a!<br />
week that we ought to be discussing together, the three governmn: t,<br />
what could be done to help improve industrial relations Cli. TnatC<br />
in the steel industry because it has not been goo'i... ( inaudihle).<br />
of unions that BHP have to deal with. Now while Mr Bannon and<br />
Mr Wran both believe that sort of examination is necessary, they<br />
weren't prepared to enter into consultation. Now that again puts<br />
at risk the credibility of the Labor slogan " working together"<br />
because in that particular instance neither Mr Wran nor Mr Baninon<br />
were prepared to work together to consult withi the Commnonwealth<br />
at this point as to what improvements in industrial relations<br />
might be introduced into the steel industry. In those </p>
<p>4.<br />
consultations we would explore the degree of acgreemnent between~<br />
governments and then you would move out for discussions with<br />
other people. They won't even make the first step. </p>
