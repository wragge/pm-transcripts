    <content><![CDATA[<p>My dear Premier,<br />
Thank you for your recent advice concerning those<br />
employment related projects in your State which you<br />
would wish to see funded from the Commonwealth's Wage<br />
Pause Program. </p>
<p>As you know, the Commonwealth has appropriated $ 300<br />
million, corresponding to its anticipated savings under<br />
the Wage Pause Program, for expenditure to generate and<br />
maintain employment in Australia. Of this amount the<br />
allocation of a total of $ 100 million for a welfare<br />
housing element of the Program was announced in<br />
December. </p>
<p>The Commonwealth has decided that the remaining $ 200<br />
million should be allocated between the States and the<br />
Territor-ies under two additional elements of the<br />
Program. $ 100 million will be provided for assistance<br />
to the young unemployed and $ 100 million to assist older<br />
unemployed and others disadvantaged in the labour<br />
market. The youth element of the Wage Pause Program will provide<br />
assistance to unemployed young people by offering them<br />
an opportunity to work on worthwhile community projects<br />
rather than being unemployed.<br />
The other element will be aimed particularly to assist<br />
the older unemployed and others who are disadvantaged in<br />
the labour market. This group will also, of course,<br />
benefit to a greater extent than the young from the $ 100<br />
million welfare housing element that has already been<br />
allocated under the Wage Pause Program.<br />
Proposed guidelines for both the new elements of the<br />
Program are attached. It is intended that State and<br />
Territory initiatives for employment generation and to<br />
assist youth would be considered for support under the<br />
umbrella of the Wage Pause Program.<br />
The type of projects you nominated in December are<br />
generally acceptable to the Commonwealth and, provided<br />
they satisfy the conditions of the Special<br />
Employment-related Programs Act, would seem appropriate<br />
for funding under the Wage Pause Program.<br />
The Commonwealth has decided to allocate the remaining<br />
funds between the States and the Territories on the<br />
basis of the recently released population statistics.<br />
On this basis, each $ 100 million would be allocated as<br />
follows: </p>
<p>million<br />
New South Wales 34.96<br />
Victoria 26.33<br />
Queensland 15.95<br />
South Australia 8.77<br />
Western Australia 8.79<br />
Tasmania 2.83<br />
Northern Territory 0.84<br />
Australian Capital Territory 1.52<br />
We propose that a Commonwealth/ State Ministerial<br />
Committee be established under the chairmanship of the<br />
Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, the<br />
Hon. Ian Macphee, MP, to oversee the-new elements of the<br />
Program. The Committee would meet as required so that<br />
experience with different projects could be shared by<br />
all with a view to supporting those initiatives which<br />
prove to be most effective.<br />
The Commonwealth proposes that the Ministerial Committee<br />
meet in Canberra, preferably Wednesday next week, to<br />
finalise decisions on projects to be included in the new<br />
elementsof the Wage Pause Program. It would, I think,<br />
be desirable for officials to meet beforehand. Funds<br />
from the Wage Pause Program will be made available<br />
immediately after Ministers have met and decisions are<br />
finalised. In addition to the Minister for Employment and<br />
Industrial Relations, the Minister for Social Security,<br />
Senator the Hon. Fred Chaney, will also be present.<br />
I should be grateful for your urgent response to these<br />
proposals and for your nomination of your Ministerial<br />
representative. I hope that the Commonwealth's Wage Pause Program will<br />
receive your support. It is framed to provide<br />
flexibility for each State and Territory to mount<br />
projects directed at their own priority areas while<br />
maximising the benefits of available funds.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
( Malcolm Fraser) </p>
