FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 16 JUNE 1982<br />
FALKLAND ISLANDS APPEAL<br />
The Government has decided to support a national<br />
appeal to assist families of British servicemen<br />
who have suffered in the Falkland Islands dispute<br />
and Fal~ kland Islanders who might be in severe<br />
hardship as a result of the dispute.<br />
I have discussed the proposal with the National<br />
President of the RSL, Sir William Keyes, who has<br />
indicated that the RSL is willing to organise and<br />
co-ordinate the appeal nationally.<br />
The Coimmonwealth Government will be contributing<br />
$. 250,000 towards the national appeal.<br />
In addition, the Government has agreed that contributions<br />
towards the appeal made during the course of the present<br />
financial year and the next financial year will be tax deductible.<br />
I welcome the decision of the RSL to accept the<br />
national co-ordinating role and thank Sir William Keyes<br />
and his Executive for their part in launching the<br />
appeal. 000---</p>
