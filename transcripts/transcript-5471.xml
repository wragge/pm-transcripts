    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>19 OCTOBER, 1980 </strong></p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone around Australia who has supported the Government, the Liberal Party and the National Party, to make sure the Coalition Government continues over the next three years.</p>
<p>Over the last five years there have at times been some difficult decisions, and some problems along the way. But as we have argued over the last few weeks, a good deal of progress has been made.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Doug Anthony, Phillip Lynch, my Ministerial colleagues, and all the members of the Parliament who worked so hard in their electorates and so hard for the cause which we jointly support.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank Tamie. I do not believe I would have been able to carry on the fight, to a successful conclusion had it not been for her support not only during the campaign but throughout my political career.</p>
<p>A number of colleagues have been lost. I feel very much for them and I thank them for the contribution they have made to the Government and to the Federal Parliament over the last five years. I know they will continue to work with the Liberal Party and I hope they will come back on another occasion to serve in the Federal Parliament.</p>
<p>Some losses had to be expected because we have had the two largest majorities in all the years since Federation. To expect that to happen three times might have been hoping for too much.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there has been a very substantial victory, giving us the responsibility over the next three years,. to govern not just for the people who voted for us, not just for the supporters of the Liberal Party or the National Party, but to govern as best we can for all the people of Australia.</p>
<p>It is quite plain that some of what has been done over the last five years has not pleased all people. We have heard that message, and I understand it. But I also understand very clearly that a significant majority has been given to the Government to continue with that work. We will use all our energies and all our efforts to advance the cause of all Australians and all Australian families. Â </p>
<p>We all agree this is the best country in the world, and it will be my objective to seek to work in partnership with all Australians to make it an even better one.</p>
<p>Again, I would like to thank all those who have worked with me, because this is very much a team effort. No one person can do this. It is the work of many hundreds, indeed of many thousands around the country, that is needed to achieve a victory of this kind, and I would like to thank them all all the people who have voted for the Government and for the Government Parties. We will now be getting on with the job of doing the very best we can for Australia. 000---</p>
