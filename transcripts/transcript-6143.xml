ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE<br />
1983 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE<br />
VICTORIAN FARMERS AND GRAZIERS ASSOCIATION<br />
28 JUNE 1983, DALLAS BROOKS HALL, EAST MELBOURNE<br />
OPEN THE<br />
GRAZIERS I AM DELIGHTED TO BE WITH YOU TODAY TO OFFICIALLY<br />
1983 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE VICTORIAN FARMERS AND<br />
ASSOC.! ATION.<br />
THE GATHERING HERE TODAY IS CLEAR TESTIMONY TO THE<br />
BENEFITS OF HAVING A SINGLE BODY REPRESENTING VICTORIAN<br />
PRIMARY PRODUCERSTHE VICTORIAN FARMERS AND GRAZIERS ASSOCIATION IS,<br />
OF COURSE, A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL FARMERS' FEDERATION.<br />
LAST MONTH IN CANBERRA I HAD THE HONOUR OF OPENING<br />
THE FEDERATION'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE.<br />
IN MY REMARKS THEN I DREW ATTENTION TO THE GREAT<br />
SUCCESS OF THE AMALGAMATION OF BODIES REPRESENTING PRIMARY<br />
PRODUCERSY </p>
<p>THE POSITIVE ROLE PLAYED BY THE NATIONAL FARMERS'<br />
FEDERATION SINCE ITS FORMATION IN 1979 1S PERHAPS THE MOST<br />
OBVIOUS CASE IN POINT. IPARTICULARLY APPRECIATED THE<br />
VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION OF THE FEDERATION TO THE RECENT<br />
NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT CONFERENCE.<br />
BUT WE SHOULD ALSO GIVE FULL CREDIT TO THE<br />
CONSTRUCTIVE WORK OF YOUR OWN ASSOCIATION. THE VFGA WAS<br />
FORMED IN THE SAME YEAR AS THE NATIONAL FARMERS' FEDERATION<br />
1979 AND FOR THE SAME REASON TO ENABLE PRIMARY<br />
PRODUCERS TO SPEAK WITH ONE VOICESINCE<br />
1979 THE PROPONENTS OF UNITY AND OF<br />
CO-OPERATION BETWEEN FARMING ORGANISATIONS CAN BE WELL<br />
SATISFIED WITH THE RESULTS OF THEIR WORK. THEY HAVE BEEN<br />
VINDICATEDI COME STRAIGHT TO THE CRUX OF WHAT I WISH TO SAY<br />
TO YOUTHAT CONCERNS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FEDERAL<br />
GOVERNMENT AND PRIMARY PRODUCERS AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVE<br />
ORGAN ISAT IONS*<br />
WE NEED A RELATIONSHIP BASED ON TRUST, BASED ON<br />
RESPECT AND, ABOVE ALL., A RELATIONSHIP THAT WORKS-<br />
* L rVf" S I. </p>
<p>BUT WE CAN ONLY WORK TOGETHER IF THERE'S A<br />
RECOGNITION ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE OF<br />
THE RELATIONSHIP AND A BASIC COMMITMENT TO MAKE IT WORK.<br />
SO I SAY THIS TO YOU SIMPLY AND WITHOUT ANY QUALMAND<br />
PARTICULARLY TO REPUDIATE ANY MISAPPREHENSION THAT MIGHT<br />
INADVERTENTLY HAVE BEEN CREATEDWE<br />
ARE DETERMINED TO WORK WITH YOU AND FOR YOUWE<br />
REGARD OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU AS OF PARAMOUNT<br />
IMPORTANCE AND ARE DETERMINED TO MAKE IT WORKTHE<br />
CONTRIBUTION OF THE RURAL SECTOR IS NOT MERELY<br />
INTEGRAL TO OUR SURVIVAL AS A TRADING NATION.<br />
IT IS VITAL IF WE ARE TO MAKE ANY SORT OF FIST OF<br />
AN ECONOMIC RECOVERYIN DEVELOPING OUR RELATIONS WITH YOU, my GOVERNMENT<br />
IS EXTREMELY FORTUNATE IN HAVING AS MINISTER FOR PRIMARY<br />
INDUSTRY A PERSON OF THE ABILITY AND CONVICTION OF JOHN<br />
KER IN. HE IS QUICKLY ESTABLISHING HIMSELF AS THE MOST<br />
EFFECTIVE MINISTER FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRY SINCE THE SECOND<br />
WORLD WARV.-</p>
<p>AND JUST AS IMPORTANT FOR FARMERS, MY ECONOMIC<br />
MINISTERS HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THEIR CREDIBILITY IN THE<br />
STRUGGLE TO RESTORE AUSTRALIA'S INTERNATIONAL<br />
COMPETITIVENESS AND TO PUT AUSTRALIA ON THE PATH TO<br />
NON-INFLATIONARY GROWTHMy<br />
GOVERNMENT CAME TO OFFICE WITH A PLEDGE TO<br />
FIGHT UNEMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION AT THE SAME TIME. WE SAID<br />
THAT WE WOULD PURSUE EXPANSIONARY POLICIES, TO GET THE<br />
ECONOMY MOVING AGAIN AND TO CREATE JOBS AND WE SAID THAT WE<br />
WOULD DO THIS WHILE WINDING DOWN INFLATION AND ESTABLISHING<br />
A LESS DISRUPTIVE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ENVIRONMENTAND<br />
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOINGOVER<br />
THE PAST FEW MONTHS I HAVE USED A NUMBER OF<br />
MEETINGS SUCH AS THIS TO REMIND AUSTRALIANS THAT THERE ARE<br />
REAL LIMITS TO THE DEGREE OF ECONOMIC STIMULUS THAT CAN BE<br />
ACCOMMODATED WITHOUT JEOPARDISING THE BASIC OBJECTIVES THESE<br />
POLICIES ARE SUPPOSED TO ACHIEVEI<br />
NEED HARDLY TELL YOU OF THE OVERRIDING NEED<br />
TO GET INTEREST RATES DOWN<br />
TO GET INFLATION DOWN<br />
TO CONTAIN WAGE AND OTHER COST INCREASES<br />
TO IMPROVE THE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS OF OUR<br />
PRODUCTS AND<br />
TO EXPAND OUR MARKETS , Th4; r </p>
<p>INEED HARDLY TELL YOU THAT ONE SURE WAY NOT TO<br />
ACHIEVE ANY OF THESE OBJECTIVES IS TO TREAT THE FEDERAL<br />
BUDGET AS THOUGH IT CAN BE EXPANDED WITHOUT LIMITWE<br />
OWE IT To AUSTRALIANS WITHOUT JOBS, AS WELL AS<br />
TO FARMERS AND OTHERS WHO MUST COMPETE ON WORLD MARKETS<br />
WHILE PAYING AUSTRALIAN PRICES FOR THE GOODS AND RESOURCES<br />
THEY NEED, TO KEEP THE BUDGET DEFICIT WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF<br />
RESPONSIBILITY. WE HAVE INDICATED THAT WE HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO<br />
CONSIDER A DEFICIT UP TO ABOUT $ 8.5 BILLION IN 1983-84.<br />
WE BELIEVE THAT EXPANSIONARY FISCAL POLICY ALONG<br />
THESE LINES CAN BE CONTEMPLATED WITHOUT DISASTROUS<br />
CONSEQUENCES IN FINANCIAL MARKETS WHILE PRIVATE INVESTMENT<br />
REMAINS AS LOW AS IT is. BUT STRONG AND DURABLE RECOVERY<br />
WILL REQUIRE THE RESTORATION OF HIGH LEVELS OF PRIVATE<br />
INVESTMENT. THAT GROWTH WILL BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE IF<br />
THERE ARE FURTHER INCREASES IN REAL INTEREST RATES. AND<br />
THESE MUST OCCUR IF BUDGET DEFICITS REMAIN AT PRESENT LEVELS<br />
AS PRIVATE INVESTMENT STRENGTHENS IN RECOVERY. THUS WE<br />
BELIEVE THAT SUBSTANTIAL FISCAL STIMULUS IN THE NEAR FUTURE<br />
MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY MEASURES TO HAUL IN THE STRUCTURAL<br />
BUDGET DEFICIT, AS RECOVERY PROCEEDS IN THE YEARS AHEAD-</p>
<p>OUR MAY ECONOMIC STATEMENT MADE A VERY IMPORTANT<br />
FIRST STEP TO BRINGIN-G OUR FISCAL POLICY BACK ALONG A<br />
RESPONSIBLE COURSE, A PROCESS THAT WILL BE CONTINUED IN THE<br />
AUGUST BUDGET. IN FRAMING THAT BUDGET WE WILL NEED TO ALLOW FOR<br />
THE MORE OPTIMISTIC INTERNATIONAL OUTLOOK THAT IS NOW<br />
DEVELOPINGA SUSTAINED U. S. RECOVERY, PARTICULARLY IF IT IS<br />
REINFORCED BY THE PICK UP IN ACTIVITY NOW EXPECTED IN A<br />
NUMBER OF OTHER INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES, SHOULD PROVIDE SOME<br />
ADDITIONAL L-ECT STIMULUS TO THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,<br />
PRINCIPALLY BY WAY OF STRONGER DEMAND FOR OUR EXPORTS AND<br />
REDUCED EXTERNAL PRESSURE ON OUR IMPORT COMPETING SECTORSIN<br />
THE COURSE OF 1983-84, THIS EXTERNAL STIMULUS<br />
CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE INCREASE IN ECONOMIC<br />
ACTIVITY AND EMPLOYMENT THAT WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR<br />
EXPANSIONARY FISCAL POLICIES, THE ENDING OF THE DROUGHT AND<br />
THE IMPROVEMENT I. N CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE APPARENT<br />
SINCE THE SUMMIT.<br />
ALL THIS STRENGTHENS THE VIEW IEXPRESSED YESTERDAY<br />
AT THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB NAMELY THAT THE FINANCIAL YEAR<br />
WHICH BEGINS THIS WEEK WILL MARK A DECISIVE WATERSHED<br />
BETWEEN PAST YEARS OF STAGNATION AND FUTURE YEARS OF GROWTH<br />
IN THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY-</p>
<p>OUR WHOLE ECONOMIC STRATEGY DEPENDS ON OUR BEING<br />
ABLE TO IMPROVE AUSTRALIA'S INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS<br />
AND TO CONTAIN THE ADVERSE EFFECT OF WAGE INCREASES AND<br />
INFLATION ON OUR ABILITY TO COMPETETHE<br />
FACT IS: THERE CAN BE NO LONG-TERM RECOVERY<br />
UNLESS WE MAINTAIN OUR INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESSMy<br />
GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING A DEGREE OF<br />
WAGE RESTRAINT CONSISTENT WITH THAT OBJECTIVEWE<br />
HAVE INDICATED THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE<br />
ECONOMY CAN ACCOMMODATE A RISE IN WAGES IN 1983 BEYOND THE<br />
ORDER OF 3 OR 14 PER CENTSIGNIFICANTLY THIS IS A LOWER INCREASE THAN WAS<br />
EXPECTED BY THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFICIAL ADVISERS UNDER THE<br />
PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT'S WAGES POLICY. IT IS, OF COURSE, FAR<br />
LOWER THAN AUSTRALIA HAS HAD AT ANY TIME IN THE PAST DECADETHE<br />
GROWTH IN AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS IN CALENDAR<br />
YEAR 1982 WAS RUNNING ABOVE 114% BUT BY THE BEGINNING OF NEXT<br />
YEAR WE EXPECT TO GET IT DOWN TO AROUND 6%.<br />
SUCH WAGE MODERATION WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOWER<br />
INFLATION WE EXPECT OVER THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR-4. </p>
<p>WE INHERITED AN INFLATION RATE OF 11.5 PER CENT AS<br />
WE WENT INTO GOVERNMENT, BUT GOING INTO 1984 WE EXPECT<br />
INFLATION TO BE DOWN TO THE ORDER OF 6 PER CENTTHIS<br />
WILL HELP IMPROVE OUR INTERNATIONAL<br />
COMPETITIVENESS AND REINFORCE THE FAVOURABLE IMPACT THAT<br />
RESULTED FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S DEVALUATION IN MARCHEXCHANGE<br />
RATE POLICY IS, OR COURSE, ALONGSIDE WAGES<br />
POLICY, AN ESSENTIAL DETERMINANT OF OUR INTERNATIONAL<br />
COMPETITIVENESS-OUR POLICY OF FIGHTING INFLATION AND<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT AT THE SAME TIME MEAN THAT WE ARE ADOPTING A<br />
MORE BALANCED AKP ROACH TO EXCHANGE RATE POLICY THAN OUR<br />
PREDECESSORS, WHOSE POLICIES OF FIGHTING INFLATION FIRST<br />
SOMETIMES LED TO THE EXCHANGE RATE BEING HELD ARTIFICIALLY<br />
H IGH. WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK, LET ME NOW TAKE UP SOME OF<br />
THE SPECIFIC GOVERNMENT DECISIONS I KNOW HAVE CREATED SOME<br />
CONCERN IN THE RURAL COMMUNITY.<br />
ITURN FIRST TO THAT WHICH HAS CREATED PERHAPS MOST<br />
CONCERN THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO SHORTLY END THE TWO<br />
COMMONWEALTH7FUNDED DROUGHT RELIEF SCHEMES THAT HAVE<br />
OPERATED SINCE LAST SEPTEMBER FROM 30 SEPTEMBER IN THE<br />
CASE OF THE INTEREST SUBSIDY SCHEME AND FROM 30 JUNE IN THE<br />
CASE OF THE FODDER SUBSIDY SCHEME.<br />
I HAVE TAKEN NOTE OF YOUR CRITICISM AND WOULD LIKE<br />
YOU TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE ARE CONTINUING ARRANGEMENTS<br />
TO ASSIST FARMERS IN DIFFICULT FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES<br />
REC(. A( I. Ãµ . F nF NAT. UR/ 4, </p>
<p>IT IS APPROPRIATE TO REPEAT WHAT I TOLD THE<br />
PARLIAMENT ON 3 MAY IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION FROM THE<br />
LEADER OF THE NATIONAL PARTY:<br />
" THE MINISTER FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRY IS PREPARING A<br />
REVIEW OF DROUGHT RELIEF MEASURES FOR EARLY<br />
CONSIDERATION BY THE GOVERNMENT. AS THE SITUATION<br />
IMPROVES, WE ANTICIPATE AN INCREASING REQUIREMENT<br />
FOR CARRY-ON FINANCE UNDER THE N. D. R. A. SCHEME FOR<br />
RESTOCKING AND RESTORATION PURPOSES"'<br />
FARMERS IN DROUGHT-DECLARED AREAS WILL CONTINUE TO<br />
HAVE ACCESS TO CARRY-ON LOANS UNDER THE N. D. R. A. OF UI TO<br />
$ 40,000 AT INTEREST RATES NO HIGHER THAN 14 PER CENT. GIVEN<br />
THE MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN SEASONAL CONDITIONS, AND THE<br />
CONTINUED ACCESS TO THE NATIONAL DISASTER RELIEF<br />
ARRANGEMENTS, IT SEEMED TO MY GOVERNMENT TO BE APPROPRIATE<br />
TO TERMINATE THE FODDER AND INTEREST SCHEMES-MOREOVER, THE<br />
GOVERNMENT RECENTLY NEARLY DOUBLED THE ALLOCATION MADE LAST<br />
YEAR FOR RURAL ADJUSTMENTTHE<br />
PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT IN INTRODUCING THE FODDER<br />
AND INTEREST SUBSIDIES MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT THEY<br />
SHOULD BE REGARDED AS A ONE-OFF EXERCISE DIRECTLY ARISING<br />
OUT OF THE GENERAL DROUGHT THROUGH ALL OF EASTERN AND<br />
SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA. THESE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES MEANT<br />
THAT NORMAL AGISTMENT ARRANGEMENTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE TO<br />
FARMERS AFFECTED BY DROUGHT. CLEARLY THIS SITUATION NO<br />
LONGER EXISTS-</p>
<p>HOWEVER, IN VIEW OF VARIOUS STATEMENTS AND<br />
REPRESENTATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE, THE GOVERNMENT IS<br />
PREPARED TO CONSIDER ANY SPECIFIC EVIDENCE FROM FARMERS<br />
ORGANISATIONS THAT AN EXTENSION OF THE FODDER SUBSIDY BEYOND<br />
JUNE 30 IS ESSENTIALANOTHER AREA WHERE SOME CONCERN HAS BEEN EXPRESSED<br />
IN THE RURAL COMMUNITY IS THE ECONOMIC STATEMENT DELIVERED<br />
TO PARLIAMENT ON MAY 19 BY THE TREASURER, PAUL KEATINGTHIS<br />
STATEMENT, YOU WILL RECALL, PRESENTED THE<br />
RESULTS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF EXISTING<br />
GOVERNMENT F'PENDITURE AND TAXATIONTHIS<br />
REVIEW WAS UNDERTAKEN TO DEAL WITH THE<br />
FINANCIAL CRISIS TO WHICH I HAVE REFERREDOF<br />
THE MASS OF DECISIONS IN THE MAY STATEMENT ONLY<br />
FOUR DIRECTLY AFFECTED PRIMARY PRODUCERSTHE<br />
TOTAL SAVINGS FROM THESE FOUR MEASURES WERE $ 54<br />
MILLION IN THE COMING FINANCIAL YEARTHIS<br />
WAS, HOWEVER, ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION ( IN<br />
FACT, LESS THAN 6 PER CENT) OF THE AGGREGATE SAVINGS<br />
ACHIEVED FROM THE EXERCISE.<br />
THOSE SAVINGS TOTALLED $ 985 MILLION-</p>
<p>SO THERE WERE SAVINGS OF $ 541 MILLION FROM MEASURES<br />
AFFECTING PRIMARY PRODUCERS COMPARED WITH SAVINGS OF ALMOST<br />
$ BILLION OVERALLCLEARLY THERE CAN BE NO REASONABLE SUGGESTION THAT<br />
THE RURAL COMMUNITY WAS ASKED TO CARRY A DISPROPORTIONATE<br />
SHARE OF THE BURDEN OF RESTRAINTANOTHER<br />
AREA OF SOME CONCERN IS TARIFF POLICYTHE<br />
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACKNOWLEDGES THE LEGITIMATE<br />
CONCERN OF THE RURAL SECTOR ABOUT THE EFFECT OF AUSTRALIA'S<br />
TRADE POLICIESPROTECTION FOR AUSTRALIA'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY<br />
IMPOSES VERY REAL COSTS ON AUSTRALIAN FARMERSTHE<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS UNDERTAKEN NOT TO INTRODUCE<br />
PROTECTION REDUCTIONS IN THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AHEAD<br />
BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATIONNEVERTHELESS,<br />
WE NEED, AS A NATION, TO BE LOOKING<br />
TO THE LONGER TERM, TO A SITUATION WHERE WE DO INTRODUCE<br />
GRADUAL REDUCTIONS IN PROTECTION AND BEGIN TO EASE THE<br />
SEVERE BURDEN THAT PROTECTION IMPOSES ON THE RURAL SECTOR<br />
AND OTHERS IN OUR COMMUNITY-</p>
<p>12.<br />
THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT IN ANYBODY'S MIND ABOUT MY<br />
GOVERNMENT'S COMMITMENT TO TRADE LIBERALISATION AS THE<br />
ECONOMY STRENGTHENS IN THE YEARS AHEADMy<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS A STRONG COMMITMENT TO PRIMARY<br />
INDUSTRYIN OUR SHORT PERIOD IN GOVERNMENT WE HAVE ALREADY<br />
ACTED IN A WIDE RANGE OF FIEL'DS.<br />
CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE TOWARD THE<br />
ESTABLISHMENT OF A SINGLE NATIONAL MEAT INSPECTION SERVICETHE<br />
MEAT AND LIVESTOCK INDUSTRIES ARE CONSIDERING<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSAL FOR REORGANISING THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
MEAT AND LIVESTOCK CORPORATION-.<br />
WE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A FIVE YEAR STABILISATION<br />
PLAN FOR THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY-.<br />
THREE WEEKS AGO JOHN KERIN ANNOUNCED THAT THE RURAL<br />
ADJUSTMENT SCHEME, AN ONGOING PROGRAM TO HELP FARMERS ADJUST<br />
TO CHANGING ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES, WILL RECEIVE $ 35 MILLION<br />
IN THE COMING FINANCIAL YEAR.<br />
As I MENTIONED EARLIER, THIS ALMOST DOUBLES THE<br />
CURRENT YEAR'Is $ 18.4 MILLION ALLOCATION-IT STRONGLY </p>
<p>CONTRASTS WITH THE APPROACH OF THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT WHICH<br />
CUT RURAL ADJUSTMENT SCHEME FUNDS BY TWO THIRDS IN 1979.<br />
QUITE SEPARATE FROM THIS DOUBLING OF FUNDING, WE<br />
INJECTED $ 11 MILLION INTO THE RURAL ADJUSTMENT SCHEME FOR<br />
CARRY-ON LOANS FOR THE SUGAR INDUSTRYLET<br />
ME COME BACK TO THE FUNDAMENTAL POINT I WAS<br />
MAKING EARLIER THE NEED FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE<br />
RURAL SECTOR TO WORK EFFECTIVELY TOGETHER.<br />
WE AS A GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZE THAT AUSTRALIAN<br />
PRIMARY INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF ITS EFFICIENCY IS SECOND TO<br />
NONE IN THE WORLD.<br />
IWAS REMINDED OF THIS ALMOST BY ACCIDENT EARLIER<br />
THIS MONTH WHEN I WAS IN INDONESIAWHILE<br />
THERE, I VISITED A PLACE CALLED CIAWI, NEAR<br />
JAKARTA, WHERE A MAJOR AID PROJECT FOR ANIMAL RESEARCH AND<br />
DEVELOPMENT IS IN OPERATIONTHE<br />
WHOLE PROJECT WAS EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE.<br />
BUT THE RELEVANT POINT HERE IS THAT THE FARM<br />
TECHNOLOGY BEING APPLIED THE BEST IN THE WORLD WAS<br />
AUSTRALIAN FARM TECHNOLOGY-</p>
<p>THIS SMALL POINT UNDERLINES FOR ME SOMETHING OF<br />
TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCETHIS IS THE EXTRAORDINARY POTENTIAL OF AUSTRALIAN<br />
PRIMARY INDUSTRY NOT JUST IN TERMS OF A CONTRIBUTION TO<br />
DOMESTIC ECONOMIC RECOVERY BUT IN TERMS OF MAKING A REAL<br />
IMPACT ON THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC SCENEBUT<br />
TO REALIZE THAT POTENTIAL, THE NATIONAL<br />
GOVERNMENT MUST GIVE AN OPEN AND FULL COMMITMENT TO OUR<br />
GREAT PRIMARY INDUSTRIES.<br />
IGIVE YOU THAT COMMITMENT NOW--<br />
WE, AS A GOVERNMENT, AND YOU, AS A VITAL PART OF<br />
OUR COMMUNITY, MUST WORK TOGETHERAND<br />
IN DOING SO, I CAN THINK OF NO BETTER STARTING<br />
POINT THAN THE NEW LOGO YOUR ASSOCIATION HAS ADOPTED AS A<br />
MOTTO " ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH UNITY".<br />
WE WILL NOT ACHIEVE ANYTHING AS A NATION IF WE ARE<br />
DIVIDED AMONG OURSELVES:<br />
IF WE CREATE ARTIFICIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CITY<br />
AND COUNTRY<br />
IF WE REFUSE TO RESPECT EACH OTHER OR TO LISTEN TO<br />
EACH OTHER<br />
IF WE DWELL ON PAST DIFFEREN* CES AND NOT LOOK TO THE<br />
F UT U RE </p>
<p>THE ONLY BASIS FOR GENUINE ACHIEVEMENT AS A NATION<br />
IS FOR US TO FORGET OUR DIFFERENCES AND TO UNITE AS<br />
AUSTRALIANS. I WISH ALL OF YOU EVERY SUCCESS IN YOUR EFFORTS FOR<br />
" ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH UNITY".<br />
I SIMPLY ASK THAT YOU WORK WITH US, AS THE NATIONAL<br />
GOVERNMENT, IN THAT VERY SAME ENDEAVOUR WE SEEK FOR<br />
AUSTRALIA -ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH UNITY.<br />
IDECLARE THIS CONFERENCE OPEN-</p>
