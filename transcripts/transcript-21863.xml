    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I am pleased to announce the Federal Government has approved a   $1.3 million grant to help fund the search for the HMAS Sydney II.</p>
<p>The HMAS Sydney II was the battle cruiser lost off the West Australian coast in 1941.</p>
<p>The financial assistance announced today will be provided to HMAS Sydney Search Pty Ltd.</p>
<p>A great deal of preparation and research has been undertaken by HMAS Sydney Search Pty Ltd and their partner, Mr David Mearns.</p>
<p>Mr Mearns was the person who found the Bismarck and the Hood.</p>
<p>The loss of HMAS Sydney II is one of Australia's greatest maritime mysteries.</p>
<p>The HMAS Sydney II held a special place of regard with Australia's wartime population thanks to its earlier successes in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>The finding of the HMAS Sydney II would close a significant chapter in Australia's wartime history and bring a long awaited closure to the suffering of the families, as well as allowing the proper recognition of the sacrifice made by the 645 crew.</p>
<p>The funding will be used to conduct the sonar search of the seabed of the identified area with a suitable vessel, state of the art sonar equipment and experienced personnel.</p>
<p>  It is timely as we commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the end of World War II that we endeavour to locate the wreck of one of our great battleships.  </p>
