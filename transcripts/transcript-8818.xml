CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
T'his is an historic moment in our national life.<br />
In the last few years Australians have heard a good deal about our need to go to Asia to<br />
look to the Asia-Pacific, because that is where our great 2pportunity is. It is where our<br />
future lies.<br />
In the past twelve months the countries of the region have heard about it too. They know<br />
that Australia is making the leap that we are siezing the moment.<br />
The argument is an economic one and a geographic one. The Asia-Pacific is the<br />
economic region closest to us. It operates within our time zone. It is the fastest growing<br />
part of the world.<br />
We have not just the raw materials, but the skills and services, the educators, and<br />
increasingly the manufacturing, to become a dynamic partner in the region's growth.<br />
Each month the success of our endeavours becomes more apparent. The Asia-Pacific and<br />
particularly South-East Asia, is the destination for more and more Australian exports..<br />
More and more Australian companies are finding markets in Asia.<br />
And I might say, Asia is increasingly coming to Australia for goods and services<br />
especially personal services.<br />

I think it is true to say that even in the past twelve months our awareness of the Asian<br />
opportunity has dramiatically expanded.<br />
And in the same period, I know from my own travels, the countries of the region have<br />
become more aware of our changed approach, and our new determination to successfully<br />
do business.<br />
The change is driven by a more fundamental change within Australia itself. This is a<br />
much more complex and subtle society than it was a generofa 1 is a richer society,<br />
more open and more worldly.<br />
Australia's great achievement in the last generation has been the creation of a sophisticated<br />
modern multicultural society. A society remarkable for both its diversity and its tolerance.<br />
And this has made us stronger, more adaptable and creative.<br />
We are now living through the second great change the change which will secure our<br />
way of life and our standards of living for generations to come. That is the change to a<br />
modem manufacturing society, integrated with the most dynamic region in the world<br />
our own region.<br />
I suppose no theme has quite so dominated the rhetoric of the past few years as this one.<br />
But, in the last twelve months I have also had the opportunity to say from time to time that<br />
our success in manufacturing and trade necessarily involves Australia's identity.<br />
We will do best if we are confident, if we leave no doubt about who we are. We should be<br />
projecting to the world the truth about Australia; this is a robust democracy, a society as<br />
rich and diverse and unique as the continent itself. A people able to imagine what they<br />
might be. Able to imagine their future in the region and the world. A creative people,<br />
able to make things the world wants to buy. Able to deliver the information and services<br />
which the world needs. Able to deliver the products of their imagination and culture.<br />
That in essence, is the Australian identity in the 1990s and that is what the ABC is now<br />
going to deliver.<br />
As I said, this is an historic moment.<br />
Great credit is due to Gareth Evans and Bob Collins. As good politicians and people of<br />
imagination must, they pushed and cajoled and relentlessly persuaded others to get this<br />
project through. I know they rankc it high among their many achievements, and so they<br />
should. Credit must also go to Bruce Donald and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for<br />
bringing the project to fruition.<br />
From now on the people of our region will be able to know us better, and that will make<br />
all our other eforts that much easier. 6419 </p>
<p>Australian Television International will bring Australia and the South-East Asian region<br />
significantly closer.<br />
Tonight I am very happy to announce a new initiative with a similar and complementary<br />
purpose. The Commonwealth Government has decided to conduct a study of the feasibility of<br />
staging in Darwin a biennial festival of the region's indigenous arts and life sciences.<br />
T'he festival would be created in conjunction with the Northern Terrtorv community and<br />
private sector interests. Calling on the Territory's unique cultural strengths, location and<br />
facilities including these new ATVI facilities the festival has the potential to become<br />
one of the world's great cultural events.<br />
As never before, it will provide a window onto the achievements and lifestyles the<br />
genius, if you like of the peoples of the Asia-Pacific.<br />
ibis initiative is more than symbolic of Australia's desire to engage with the region; it is<br />
an example of how we can creatively engage.<br />
So too, is the launch tonight of Australia Television International.<br />
Once agin, it is my duty and my pleasure to congratulate everyone involved and on<br />
behalf of the people of Australia, wish the venture every suces<br />
Tonight we have taken another step along the road towards a closer relationship with the<br />
region, and in so doing, another step towards the new Australia.<br />
