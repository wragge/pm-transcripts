ADDRESS TO THE NEW NATIONAL ABORIGINAL CONFERENCE<br />
It gives me great pleasure to offer to you, Mr Chairman,<br />
my congratulations on your election, and to welcome the<br />
' new National Aboriginal Conference as the major body to<br />
advise the Commonwealth Government on Aboriginal views.<br />
While I have not yet met many'of your new members, the<br />
work of the N. A. C. needs no introduction to me or to the<br />
community at large. In the four years since its first elections,<br />
the N. A. C. has proved to be a particularly valuable forum for<br />
discussion of Aboriginal views, and a channel by which these<br />
views are communicated to government.<br />
The standing and significance of the N. A. C. amongst the<br />
Aboriginal community is indicated by the recent elections.<br />
There were 251 candidates, and more than 34,000 electors voted.<br />
The new N. A. C. will be taking on a significantly expanded<br />
role as it assumes the functions of the former Council for<br />
Aboriginal Development. The energy and dedication of the<br />
N. A. C. in promoting the interests of Aboriginal people has<br />
taken on new dimensions with its increasingly wide involvements.<br />
In particular, the Third Asserbly of the World Council of<br />
Indigenous People, which was hosted by the was one<br />
of the particularly significant international events held<br />
in Australia during the course of the year.<br />
You and your executive especially will have a great deal<br />
of contact with the Minister and, as you know, there is a<br />
commitment for myself and Cabinet Ministers to meet with your<br />
executive. The Government, and particularly the Minister,.<br />
value the advice which we receive from the our task<br />
in achieving the objective of promoting the' well-being of<br />
the Aboriginal people, an objective the N. A. C. has supported<br />
so strongly, would be so much more difficult without your<br />
contribution.<br />
Against that background of common objective, I can say we<br />
have not always agreed on every issue in the past and we will<br />
not always agree in the future. This is to be expected, and<br />
it is healthy. You would be failing in your duty if you were<br />
not to be pointing out the shortcomings in policy and pressing<br />
us to do more. Nevertheless, there is much common ground between<br />
us and many tasks which ve do and must share. / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
It is about what we have in common that I would like to talk<br />
today. Much has been said of the problems. The Government has<br />
been accused by some people of ignoring them. Let me say<br />
quite categorically that the Government is fully aware of the<br />
problems and that our policies are designed to overcome<br />
disadvantage. It would, however, be short-sighted not to<br />
learn from, and build on the more positive experiences of<br />
recent years with the aim of overcoming disadvantage.<br />
At the outset, I should state our objectives in Aboriginal<br />
affairs objectives which I think you will generally accept.<br />
The Commonwealth believes that Aboriginals and Torres Strait-<br />
Islanders should have the same opportunity as other Australians<br />
to determine their own varied lifestyles and be able to live<br />
as independent,, self-sustaining citizens. The Commonwealth<br />
believes that Aboriginals should have the same access to<br />
Government services as do other Australian citizens, and<br />
that additional services appropriate to their state of<br />
disadvantage should also be provided. As recognition of the<br />
) past dispossession and dispersal of the Aboriginal people<br />
the-Commonwealth seeks to promote their development, selfmanagement<br />
and self-sufficiency. The Commonwealth believes<br />
Aborigina'l culture is an intrinsic part of Australian heritage,<br />
something of value to all Australians arad that Aboriginals<br />
and Torres Strait Islanders should be able to retain and<br />
develop their traditions, language and culture wherever<br />
this is their wish..<br />
I believe the Government's record clearly demonstrates<br />
our commitment to these objectives, a commitment which I am<br />
sure is being supported by the community at large. The very<br />
act of establishing the N. A. C. is clear recognition that<br />
Aboriginals should have greater control over their lives<br />
and over policies affecting them. In similar vein, the Government<br />
last year established the Aboriginal Development Commission,<br />
a body which-has taken on a fundamental role in promoting<br />
Aboriginal management. We made the Aboriginal Land Rights<br />
( Northern Territory) Act a reality, and since* 1976 some<br />
27% of the Northern Territory has come under Aboriginal<br />
freehold ownership.<br />
In a general atmosphere of budgetary restraint the Budget<br />
allocation * for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has,<br />
this financial year, been increased by some 16%. to $ 147 million2.<br />
Th ' e aggregate of spending by all Government Departments on<br />
programmes specifically for Aboriginals. will be some $ 228 million<br />
in 1981/ 82.%<br />
In the key area of health, grants to Aboriginal organisations<br />
for health services have doubled in real terms since 1976.<br />
We have committed $ 50 million over the next five years to<br />
projects to improve public health facilities to Aboriginal<br />
communities, and our Aboriginal medical services have been the<br />
subject of much international interest. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
This year, some $ 78 million will be provice(-d for Aboriginal<br />
housing, and $ 72 million will be provided for education,<br />
employment and training. With regard to the question of<br />
self-management, the Aboriginal Development Commission<br />
has $ 50 million available to it this year. 75% of the<br />
funds available to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs<br />
for Aboriginal advancement progjrammes will be allocated<br />
to direct grants to Aboriginal-managed organisations.<br />
From the objectives which we share arise a number of tasks<br />
on which it is. essential that we work together. Perhaps<br />
the most fundamental is the continued development of<br />
measures to assist Aboriginal people which are effective<br />
and capable of implementation. Understandably, Aboriginal<br />
expectations for change are high. The Government too would<br />
like to abolish the disadvantage experienced by many Aboriginals.<br />
However, the experience of recent years shows that al. though<br />
significant progress can be made there is no single or quick<br />
solution no matter how much money is spent. The neglect of<br />
almost two centuries cannot be undone immediately. To say<br />
otherwise, would be to underestimate the nature and extent<br />
of the problems.<br />
In addition, the Commonwealth, Government is not the only body<br />
which provides assistance to , Aboriginals or which affects their<br />
interests. State Governments have primary responsibility<br />
in areas such as land, health, and education and the services<br />
and activities of local governments and private agencies<br />
and interests also affect Aboriginal people in many ways.<br />
It is essential then that the approach to the task should<br />
be on a co-operative basis if best advantage is to be made<br />
of the resources available.<br />
The Commonwealth when necessary has presented Aboriginal<br />
views to State Governments, and has also been involved<br />
with private enterprise, through, for example, promotion<br />
of employment opportunities for Aboriginal people. Let me<br />
add that the N. A. C. itself can play an important role in<br />
putting forward views a-id in helping to establish the dialogue<br />
needed in areas for which the Commonwealth is not primarily<br />
responsible. A further joint task to which I think all political<br />
parties and the N. A. C. must give attention is increasing the<br />
awareness and understanding of Aboriginal culture and lifestyles.<br />
The community in general recognises the overwhelming disadvantage<br />
experienced by many Aboriginals and the need for special assistance.<br />
However, there is a continuing need to educate the community<br />
to explain our policies and the reasons for them. In this context,'<br />
I feel I should make the point that little purpose is served<br />
in bandying around generalised allegations about t he Australian<br />
people or various governments. Not by abuse and hostility<br />
will we win the support of people who have failed to give due!<br />
regard to Aboriginal concerns and interests, but by persuasion<br />
and education because your cause is just. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
The third major task on which I think we are in agreement<br />
is the need to be aware-of what Aboriginal people, individual<br />
Aboriginals think. We have encouraged self-management because<br />
we believe that Aboriginal people know their own priorities<br />
and needs better than government, and we are concerned that<br />
our policies should be responsive to Aboriginal<br />
wishes. We established the N. A. C. because it was recognised that<br />
for a number of reasons Aboriginal people have found it<br />
difficult to put their views to government. We look to the<br />
N. A. C. to tell us what people at the grass-roots are thinking<br />
and saying. Representing all Aboriginals, many of whom would<br />
otherwise in practice have no voice on such matters, is a<br />
most important task of the N. A. C.<br />
In discussing Aboriginal affairs we necessarily conce ntrate<br />
on the problems but far too seldom is recognition given<br />
to the successes. For example, those Aborigines who have<br />
achieved prominence and distinction in various fields, the<br />
Aboriginal students in tertiary education, and successful<br />
AboriginAl enterprises.<br />
I hope the N. A. C. will help to raise awareness of the<br />
achievements and successes of Aboriginals to show the<br />
community that when Aboriginals are given equal opportunities<br />
they take them, that our programmes for Aboriginal advancement<br />
represent money Well spent.<br />
I think a fitting note to conclude on is the subject of the<br />
Makarrata " a coming together after a period of hostilities".<br />
I know that it is something to which you attach considerable<br />
significance the Government too regards the concept as<br />
an important development. I should like to think that such a<br />
coming together is being achieved now. We do not know at this<br />
stage what form the Makarrata will finally take-and there is<br />
clearly a great deal of work still to be-done.<br />
Nevertheless, the concept is a valuable one which we would like<br />
to continue to pursue. I hope what I have said may contribute<br />
in some small way to this. Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
you have a very important and in many ways a difficult task<br />
confronting you.<br />
The Government will stand with you, sharing with you as it does<br />
the objective of promoting the well-being and seif-realisation<br />
of the Aboriginal people. On behalf of th6 Government, I wish<br />
you and everyone associated with the N. A. C. every success with<br />
your endeavours. 000---</p>
