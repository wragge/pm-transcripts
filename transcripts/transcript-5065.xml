PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 12 JUNE 1979<br />
INTERVIEW WITH MR. ASOU, YOMIURI SHIMBUN<br />
( JAPANESE CORRESPONDENT)<br />
Mr. Asou<br />
It is only 16 days to the opening of the Tokyo Summit on the<br />
28th of June. This Summit occurring as it does in the midst<br />
of continual oil price increases by the oil producing countries<br />
will have energy problems as its main topic the the extent that<br />
it is being called the energy summit. When you consider the<br />
vast energy situation Australia's every move seems to have a<br />
great capacity to affect the international ( inaudible) the<br />
economic order. Since it is one of the world's largest<br />
producers of uranium, iron ore, coal and so on. It also seems to<br />
have the capacity to give a lead to world energy policies. So,<br />
at first I would like to ask two points: what direction do you<br />
think a country participating in the Tokyo Summit should take<br />
in relation to the energy problems and what do you expect it to<br />
achieve? Prime Minister<br />
I don't think energy is it is certainly not the only vitally<br />
important question at the Tokyo Summit. It is important.<br />
The problem of inflation I think is now more important than it has<br />
been for many many years. I will speak about energy first and<br />
then if I may come to the question of inflation. Australia is<br />
an energy producer, energy exporter. We are short of oil as you<br />
know and we need what we have for our own resources but for coal,<br />
uranium, natural gas, we are exporters and we believe we have an<br />
obligation and a responsibility to do what we can -to provide<br />
energy in an energy-short world. This is one of the important<br />
reasons why we are determined to mine and export more uranium and<br />
to open new mines because we know that nations such as Japan<br />
and many others are now becoming increasingly dependent on nuclear<br />
fuel for peaceful purposes. I think we can set a lead. We can<br />
set a lead in terms of safe trading in uranium to reinforce the<br />
non-proliferation regime. Our safeguards policy is certainly a<br />
strict one, as it ought to be. Australia has recently become a<br />
member-of the Inter * national Energy Agency and certain countries<br />
the members of that Agency have made rules which is designed<br />
to reduce the consumption of oil and oil-based fuels. I don't<br />
think all countries are pursuing those agreements with the vigour<br />
that they should. And we certainly all need very vigorous programs<br />
of conservation and of diversification into other forms of<br />
energy. I suspect that this might be more urgent than many<br />
governments have led -their peoples to believe. The United States<br />
is one of the world's largest, most populous and as the world's<br />
wealthiest country is a vast consumer of energy. In a sense<br />
energy doesn't belong to any one country, it is a resource available<br />
to the world and if one country is pursuing more than its<br />
reasonable share of that finite world resource then it is using<br />
at too great a rate a resource which many countries will need.<br />
So, programs of conservation, programs of diversification, are<br />
vastly important for all of us. Now, Australia has moved a long<br />
way with our world parity pricing policy for oil, promotion of<br />

natural gas. I think we have a good way further to go and<br />
I have commissioned a report for the Government the Minister<br />
for National Development on various matters that might be put<br />
to the Government and the Government will be able to make<br />
decisions about them in relation to conservation, in relation to<br />
diversification. I think these are vastly important issues.<br />
I hope the world's energy shortage won't be allowed to hide from<br />
those leaders of the great and powerful countries that attend<br />
the Tokyo Summit forces which I think are even more important and<br />
even more dangerous than the potential energy shortage: and that is<br />
continuing inflation. Because. North America and Europe were<br />
making some progress against inflation and now for a variety of<br />
reasons inflation is gathering pace again. There are some reasons<br />
that we can understand: oil and meat prices have given a boost<br />
to inflation in Australia and a number of other countries. We<br />
have already responded to that with our own mini-budget. Unpopular<br />
as it was, but it was necessary and responsible to maintain our<br />
anti-inflationary policies. and the thrust of them. I fervently<br />
believe that unless the great and the powerful industrial countries<br />
are going to give a more fervent and more vigorous lead against<br />
inflation then we are going to be in for a long and prolonged decade<br />
of difficulties.<br />
Since 1973-4 world trade has grown at only 4 percent a year. In<br />
the twenty years before that it grew at 8 percent a year. That<br />
4 percent has occurred during a period of high inflation when<br />
growth is low, unemployment is high, and activity, investment<br />
development was minimal. It is going to stay like that and<br />
unemployment is going to stay high unless the major industrial<br />
countries really have the political determination and courage<br />
to overcome inflation.<br />
What the great and powerful do, does a great deal to determine<br />
what happens around the world, but in many cases Australia is a<br />
fortunate country-because we have political and economic stability.<br />
We have a lower rate of inflation than North America and much<br />
of Europe. Japan is still doing better, but we are hopeful we<br />
can start to match to Japan in these particular matters. Therefore,<br />
our industry should be becoming more competitive than those and<br />
we will get a larger share of this market and a better share of<br />
export markets.<br />
We are also fortunate because of great minerals and resources in<br />
the country. Because of political and economic stability we will<br />
attract great investment from overseas even if the general growth<br />
in these industries is relatively low. I think we will get more<br />
investment or some that would otherwise have gone to other<br />
great continents. Because of that, I think that in Australia there<br />
willbe more activity and a greater buoyancy and if there are<br />
difficulties around the world I think we have a capacity to work<br />
our own through with less damage than would occur in many countries. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
Now that's concerning to Australia, but it's not much consolation<br />
for those many countries and those tens of thousands indeed<br />
many millions of people in the advanced industrialised countries<br />
who will be out of work because inflation is too high.. Every<br />
Summit Conference has spoken about inflation and it is going to<br />
be much harder after this conference because when communiques<br />
are issued, but not enough happens as a result of those<br />
communiques being issued, it makes it much harder to maintain<br />
the vitality and vigour of the conference providing a hope and<br />
an understanding in many countries Australia and many many<br />
others that the economies of the very large countries are going<br />
to be managed in such a way that we will get onto a more secure<br />
path. You say these things once, twice, thrice, and it is harder<br />
each time to have a community that is going to be believed.<br />
The Tokyo Conference therefore, is of great importance because<br />
in relation to the energy problems which are certainly great but<br />
in relation to the problems of inflation, which I think are more<br />
substantial and more far-reaching, to be believed what's said will<br />
have to be followed by government action which can be seen to<br />
get on top of inflation.<br />
Question ( Inaudible),. Australia has succeeded in keeping the price<br />
increases very low, less than 5%-10%.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Not low enough, but lower than them.<br />
Question But among the countries participating in the Tokyo Summit, there<br />
are countries with economies that are going to the wall, that<br />
are experiencing price increases, rates, of nearly 20 percent.<br />
So what should these countries do to restrain inflation?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't know that any of the countries involved have inflation<br />
rates as high as-that, but a number have inflation rates 10 percent<br />
and over and rising*. There is no easy way of restraining inflation.<br />
Most importantly, I think it means that Government expenditures have<br />
got to be restrained. We have to destroy the very false and<br />
shallow philosophy that governments can provide all things that's<br />
asked" of them. What governments spend they have to take from<br />
people. What governments spend needs -to-be limited, needs to<br />
be responsible. In many cases expenditure had gone too high, as<br />
it certainly had in Australia in earlier times. In addition to<br />
that, of course, monetary policies need to be sensible managed<br />
so that the money supply growth is not too great. There are<br />
many aspects in controlling inflation wages policy and many<br />
other things. But government expenditures, the growth of the money<br />
supply, are two very important elements. If I had to say what is<br />
the one most important thing I would say government expenditure. ./ 4 </p>

Question Back to the other problem two relative questions. Judging<br />
by the crude oil price increases since just in the beginning<br />
of this year alone, dialogue between oil producing countries<br />
and consuming countries does not seem to be going very well.<br />
What should be done to improve understanding between the two<br />
sides? Prime Minister<br />
Are you talking about oil, or all commodities?<br />
Question Yes especially with oil.<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
I think one of the problems here of course comes because of<br />
a shortfall as a result of disturbances in Iran. I agree with<br />
you, it is a difficult situation and I believe that the consuming<br />
countries need to pursue their dialogue with the oil producing and<br />
exporting countries to the maximum possible extent because they<br />
do have a capacity to contribute to world economic stability or<br />
then lead to instability by the policies they follow. Quite plainly,<br />
in the medium-term to longer-term, it is very much in the<br />
interests of the oil producing and exporting countries also to<br />
have a stable and healthy world economy. If that could be better<br />
understood I think the dialogue between the two would be more<br />
beneficial. Question We hear that at the previous four summits the ( inaudible) programs,<br />
and particularly the Western countries' strategy against USSR<br />
were discussed secretly.<br />
The Western countries' strategy against the Soviet ( inaudible)<br />
were discussed secretly. In development in world politics, I<br />
think the Bonn Summit, the Government of the Shah of Iran was<br />
supported by the United States has been overthrown. Vietnam has<br />
invaded Kampuchea and interwined with this a conflict has arisen<br />
between Vietnam and China and Asia continues to experience political<br />
disturbance. Political stability in Asia is important to<br />
Australia and Japan. How do you view the outlook for international<br />
politics and particularly ASEAN politics?<br />
Prime M-1inister<br />
I welcome the normali sation of relations between China and the<br />
United States and the treaty between Japan and China. These are<br />
both positive moves which hold out possibilities for a more secure<br />
future. I think it is particularly important that the United<br />
States developed fully the possibilities that flow from normalisation<br />
of relations with China. and'-therefore flesh out their policies<br />
in the Western Pacific and in the Asian theatre the development<br />
of which were held up when there was not full exchange of<br />
relationships between Peking and Washington. </p>
<p>Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
So there are positive signs there and real possibilities<br />
that will work to our advantage.<br />
The circumstances in the Middle East, in Iran, in Vietnam and<br />
Kampuchea, the conflict between Vietnam and China are all<br />
disturbing and they have re-awakened some fears I believe in<br />
Asia and Southeast Asia that military ventures the pursuit of<br />
national ends by military means is not a thing of the past<br />
as we had hoped after the Vietnam War. In these circumstances<br />
I think it is all the more important for countries such as Japan<br />
and Australia to work at their own relationships and develop<br />
those even further. It is a very good relationship and<br />
developing greatly. It is also important for Australia and other<br />
countries of Asia Southeast Asia and ASEAN to work very<br />
closely together.<br />
I recently was in Manila and Indonesia and I believe that<br />
Australia's wish to have ever closer relationships with such<br />
countries as reciprocated by President Marcos and President Soeharto.<br />
Certainly countries that want peace, stability, security, so<br />
they can build up the standards of their own<br />
( TAPE TURNED OVER)<br />
Que-stion<br />
the interests of Australia in the Tokyo Summit. Do you have<br />
any particular hopes for this Summit in Asia and do you have<br />
doubt about a Summit in which only such a limited number of the<br />
advanced countries are participating. ( Inaudible) character<br />
of the Summit has altered because of changes in the international<br />
political and economic situation can you give me your opinion<br />
on how the Summit should go from now on?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I spoke to Prime Minister Ohira when I was in Manila and indicated<br />
what Australia thought the most important things to he discussed<br />
at the Summit and energy, as you opened by asking me about,<br />
was certainly on the list. But inflation and protectionism<br />
was high on my list. I think Australia's views and the views<br />
of the Prime Minister of Japan are very close in relation to<br />
these matters and that is encouraging. I can understand the<br />
seven Summit countries wanting to keep that group to itself.<br />
If they extended to countries such as Australia there would be<br />
many other countries in Europe with economies as large as ours<br />
tha would also claim to have a right to be involved. So I<br />
understand that fully'. But I appreciate the moves that Japan<br />
had made on Japan's initiative earlier, to seek to have Australia<br />
included. We were flattered by that but certainly didn't want<br />
it taken so far that it would be an embarrasment to Japan with<br />
the other Summit countries. I think that we need to understand,<br />
and the Summit members need to understand, that by their meeting<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
together, as they do, they are giving notice of and accepting<br />
responsibility of the fact that what they do inflie management<br />
of their affairs affects not only themselves but the whole<br />
Western system of trade and payments. If they manage their<br />
economies well, the world will march forward well and the<br />
growth in world trade will be great, maybe double what it is now.<br />
If they manage their economies badly, then the Western system<br />
of trade and payments will muddle along as it has during the<br />
last several years of high inflation, low growth in trade and<br />
high unemployment. Therefore, by meeting together, they are<br />
giving recognition of an enormous responsibility not only for<br />
their own people but to really the whole Western world and<br />
North/ South relationships and the way in which that can develop.<br />
I only hope for their sake, and for ours, that they will respond<br />
to it fully. I think on this occasion it is not just a question<br />
of leaders meeting and making a statement. The world will want<br />
to see action following from that meeting, of a forthright and<br />
vigorous kind that will cure some of the world's grave and<br />
serious economic problems.<br />
Question relative to the ( inaudible) programs. What should be done<br />
by the Tokyo Summit so that the North/ South problem can be<br />
resolved and stable political and economic structures can be<br />
built-between the<br />
Prime Minister-<br />
The best thing that could be done in relation to North/ South issues<br />
to make a Common Fund a reality now all accepted the Common Fund<br />
but let Europe, the United States, join the International Sugar<br />
Agreement let's get on and negotiate other commodity arrangements<br />
that are important to developing countries, so make~ the integrated<br />
program for commodities a very real reality. I-have no doubt<br />
that Japan's view and Australia's views are very similar in that<br />
regard. I hope that the Summit Conference will give significant<br />
attention to these particular issues.<br />
Question Japan, like Australia, is a strong supporter of the Common Fund<br />
and what role should Japan play in the Common Fund at the Tokyo<br />
Summit? Prime Minister-<br />
At the Tokyo Summit I ' hope that Japan would persuade nations<br />
there to participate in the particular commodity programs as<br />
I mentioned the Sugar Agreement which America and Europe have<br />
not yet joined and also to participate in other commodity<br />
arrangements where they have an interest in the trade, either as<br />
producers or more principally, as consumers. That will help to<br />
bring the Common Fund to a reality. If the members of the Tokyo<br />
Summit can set an example in that regard well then it will be<br />
a very useful step forward. 000---</p>
