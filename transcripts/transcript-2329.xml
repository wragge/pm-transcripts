FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 112/ 1970<br />
DEATH OF SENATOR ORMONDE<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
I was sorry to learn of the death of Senator James<br />
Ormonde. Senator Ormonde was a sincere and dedicated Labor<br />
man and for the past twelve years had served the Senate with quiet<br />
distinction. He was a man of integrity, high principles, and<br />
humanity. I extend my deepest sympathy, and that of my<br />
Government colleagues, to the late Senator's family.<br />
