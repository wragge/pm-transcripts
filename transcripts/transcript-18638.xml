Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced Australia would provide $500,000 over two years to support the role of women in building and restoring peace in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>N-Peace connects women in civil society organisations and government to share ideas on issues related to women, peace and security.</p>
<p>The funding will also support the 2012 N-Peace awards which showcase women who have showed leadership as peace advocates and men who support women's empowerment for peace and security.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Women Leaders Forum at the Rio+20 United Nations Conference, the Prime Minister said AustraliaÂ´s contribution would help strengthen gender equality in Nepal, Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Australia is committed to addressing the impact of conflict on women and to supporting women's contribution to promoting sustainable development. </p>
<p>This new funding demonstrates our continued commitment to the principles in Australia's National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security which aims to protect women and girls' human rights and promote their participation in conflict prevention, management and resolution. </p>
