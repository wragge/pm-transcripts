OFFICIAL OMIING OF * IZZU WING" ST. JOHN'S ( IDLLI4<br />
Spoodi t' the Prime Nlaisterg the Rte Haon* R. Ge NenS1q 0.11.<br />
Verny Revs Father, Your Minenoe I<br />
I can't remember the sequence an the Premier did* I shell<br />
theroftore start agein following my usual practice and say " 610" fteb<br />
I think always dives you a good beginninge<br />
As a matter of fact in the Courts of Cuiminal Awuviotian I<br />
believe It in not unknown f'or a man uftor su4ffering~ the Å“ ndipity of<br />
convistion to have a few words said for him by way of an appeal f6w<br />
. erqi~ I am ,, o: nd to reverse the process 1 appeal for mrqW betor*<br />
you find me guilty. Im iltat ing in early,<br />
Firs3t, I apologise for my inability to follow the routine#<br />
iSit lin the second place I vant to :-ay this to you, that the Reotol<br />
made rather a point of direotin,&amp; attention to the presence here this<br />
afternoon not of my old friend the k'remier, but of my present<br />
opponent, 141. Iwhitlan. He seemed to think that this was a rather<br />
good thing, that ir, -4hitlwn should be here as an old friend of this<br />
college* want to tell you that this man 1hltlams if I way s<br />
refer to him, has been pr'isent at each of the fbur speeches I1 have<br />
mab in the last four days on a University occasion, And each time I<br />
start the next ono he in stratesoaUy placed and his eye boomes<br />
glassier, and glassier, ( Laudhter) However 1 am very ; lad, Sir<br />
that you ahould remember him, lkat I am going to forget him for the<br />
rest of the afternoon. ( L~ aughter)<br />
now 51r, vhen T was being baad I think that to the<br />
right vord Into coming here this afternoon I was sent the history of<br />
the College, and in prticular a fascinating document tiat was<br />
prodseed on the 100th Annivosrsary. I wrote down one sentence from<br />
this history, ' If a poorly endowed minority of less than 90,000<br />
could build ate John's what might we expeat from the Cktholies, of<br />
todoy7' Now that, I thought -m~ s a very pungent 3onenoce I an not<br />
going to use it in an accusing sense, Any accusations that I have to<br />
make are, of aoi'rsot directed exclusively to the Presbyterians*<br />
( Laughter) ~ at thore is in that single simple sentence a ' oMu of<br />
significance. Whenever I have travelled in the world and have fbId<br />
myself looking at some great Cathedral built back in the Uth .12th,<br />
13tk century a fireat Cathedral rising from the middle of a ;" lS<br />
andq at the time ti-at it was built, rising from the middle of a tfV<br />
clusters of hamlets or perhaps the old monastic foundation itself,<br />
whenever I have seen these miracles of beauty, these &amp; ar Ml9 f<br />
worship, not miserablo, hungry things, but generous thins wAM<br />
remembered how fey people did them, I have been reminded that upon us<br />
there tlls a responsi bili ty never to do less than the past domands9<br />
but always to do more if we can*<br />
That is of ourse , articularly true if you are dealing<br />
with sae place like thi * his is part of a University -aa Osilepe<br />
withina the University. It Is also a place of religous learning<br />
It is in a real sense, a place of worship* And when it cams<br />
vorsl9pq as these our ! orefuthers have taught us, there ts no room fft<br />
the nea approaa ohno room for what Wordsworthq you remeber<br />
desaribed on lookig at the Xing' s College Chapel at CambridI9 as<br />
the % ioly calculated loe or more". " A ma's reach should emee<br />
his gaspt or what's a Heaven for?" </p>
<p>Ro, Sir I have a particular pleasure in oans here<br />
in suma I th ith most thougtfual people I feSl that " to<br />
hasult been a noble centry. It has, beuen a clever am., a hWUIMSa<br />
oneq It has pushed back the boundaries of knovledpq prtilawly in<br />
sqieaeeq to an extent never dreamed of before but it has bela<br />
disfigured aso other century has for a long tieby vans M veise<br />
than vars9 by bitter inhumanity by barbarim9 by an senS<br />
of rsponsibilitky for others9V Poo bys pressures W'_ ter is<br />
only oft correction for this and that to t hat education should never<br />
lose sight of its ethical rosponsibilities. We are not 11o psoftes<br />
clever barbarians. We are to produce educated Christian people as<br />
suchi as we can. ( Applause)<br />
Sir, one might elaborate on that theme for -leag time.<br />
1 don't need to elaborate It in your presence. U~ nless yuap both<br />
Church and 3tats r' 3, preaented Iliere today, believed in these things I<br />
have boon mentioning this College would never have boon establishedl<br />
and It would never have been extende If a highly aultivated<br />
barboxism is enough you don't need Jte John'ts. But i. f the ultimte<br />
responsibility of man is tia thing that matters, if the true values<br />
of elvilisation are -, he thin tnat matter, then you not * ni~ j noe"<br />

Sir, I don't propose wo detain youg but before I<br />
conlud Ithink pei~ ftap T. should say that when I found qyself, k<br />
reason of the inscrutable judipent of the electors onob mor" irMe<br />
XInistev at the end of 149 decided to 6ile me a second chance<br />
oe of the fisttingthat Idid was to have aComaitte Well<br />
befdo the Xurray Comittee, which eximined the then urgent needs of<br />
the Universit~ ies, The reoasons for that vere sound, a a result of<br />
the enolmous pressuras that came after the war, as a Sequel te the<br />
tal roonstruation training schesme that my preo. essor established<br />
after the warp there was a alamant demand for maom~ 4ation ift tkw<br />
Univerities, far more clamant, far more rapidly growing in terms of<br />
groportion than in any primry system of eduoat'. on, or the lie,<br />
he Uivesitis ehibted every sign at that time of incuar~ fl<br />
either a strong risk of' bankruptqy, or, at the beed, of 4 fAdeu&amp;. ww<br />
or of involving for State Governments burdens which it wa" AN" t<br />
reasonable to suppose that any State &amp; overnment could eaMr unaided.<br />
So this 00mitte, pt to work. It vas a coonittee of<br />
people who bad, tor the most part, praotical experience of<br />
Universities and of University affairs. About two-thir'ds of the Wa<br />

Mlbvowrn that this Caittee had decided that residential $ Ueg<br />
were a firill a priviate and personal luxury, and they did not am<br />
within their charter of reference. That was really the onW poed<br />
deed I ever did for ybu. Because I suw the members of the Casmittee<br />
and I said that unless there was some sum provided specifieally for<br />
resiftntWa oolleges their report would carry no vight whateer.<br />
( AV9lause) And a little bit-of money was put in. When I leek back<br />
an It nowadays I think " How little it was" until of couMs I<br />
remembered that the greatest technique in the world is to put ywa<br />

Sir Iwazit c~ o tell you that whatever little I way have<br />
