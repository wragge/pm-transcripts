VISIT TO SOUTH EAST ASIA 1968<br />
SAIGON_<br />
STATEMENT MADE BY THE<br />
MR. JOHN GCRTON 7 JUNE 1968<br />
Thank you for the warmth of your welcome and for your<br />
generous remarks about my country. I received with great pleasure the<br />
invitation which the Government of Vietnam kindly extended to me soon<br />
after I became Prime Minister of Australia.<br />
I was anxious to make an early visit to Vietnam because<br />
Australia's continuing commitment of men and material to support the<br />
freedom and development of the Republic of Vietndm occupies so large a<br />
part of our thoughts and affects at so many points our Governmental<br />
policies. I believe that my discussions wikH the leaders. of your nation,<br />
and the personal contacts shall make with them, will contribute to<br />
strengthening the friendship between our two countries,<br />
I see this visit as reaff irming Australia's support for<br />
Vietnam. It is also part of the process of consultation Which takes place<br />
frequently, and at all levels, between representatives of our two countries,<br />
and our allies, and which does much to consolidate and improve our common<br />
efforts. Such consultations are of particular importance when, at the same<br />
time as conversations are taking place in Paris, North Vietnamese aggression<br />
is continuing here. I look forward to meeting my countrymen who are now fighting<br />
and working by your side the soldiers, sailors and airmen of the Australian<br />
Force Vietnam, our aid experts, and the members of our medical teams<br />
whose humanitarian work exemplifies the co-operation between our two<br />
countries in many fields of endeavour.<br />
I welcome this opportunity to pay personal tribute to the<br />
valour of the Vietnamese people and to the achievements of the Vietnamese<br />
Government in these tragic and difficult times. Australians have admired<br />
what your people have achieved in adopting a constitution, electing a<br />
representative Government and laying the foundations of national reconciliation<br />
and reconstruction regardless of the dangers and complex stresses of war.<br />
We have admired your courage and determination in doing this despite the<br />
campaign of terror designed to deter you. We salute your soldiers for their<br />
sustained defence of their homeland, and their courage in face of the present<br />
offensives. Our deep sympathies go to all those civilians-and soldiers<br />
alike who have suffered because an unwanted and bitter war has been<br />
brought deliberately and callously into their midst. In the face of the<br />
enemy's aim to destroy you it has been your constant purpose to defencd<br />
and, at the same time to build a nation.<br />
Few countries have been faced with such a formidable task.<br />
No country has been more determined to achieve its goals. Our purpose<br />
is to help you to achieve them. / 2 </p>

At Manila in 1966, the allied nations clearly expressed<br />
their hopes and objectives for a peaceful settlement of the war in Vietnam,<br />
Our aims have not changed, and no military, political and<br />
diplomatic efforts by Hanoi will undermine our resolve to achieve a lasting<br />
peace under which the people of Vietnam will live in freedom and justice. </p>
