FOR PRESS 28 AUGUST 1978<br />
ADDRESS TO FIFTH CONFERENCE OF CONMONWEALTH SPEAKERS AND<br />
PRESIDING OFFICERS -CANBERRA<br />
Australia is particularly pleased to host this Conference,<br />
the second Commonwealth meeting to be held in this country<br />
this year.<br />
The great success and personal warmth of the first Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government Regional Meeting last February, augurs<br />
well for this and future Commonwealth meetings.<br />
Amicable, open and candid discussions at these Conferences<br />
consolidate and extend the ties which bind us together.<br />
Through times of success and times of adversity the Commonwealth<br />
has endured showing a remarkable ability to adapt to changeuntil,<br />
today, it comprises a diverse but cohesive grouping of<br />
nations, encompassing the aligned and the non-aligned, the<br />
developing and the industrialised. To a degree it is because of<br />
our very diversity that the Commonwealth is highly valued by its<br />
members. The themes of cooperation and consultation in the face<br />
of escalating world problems form the basis of the enduring<br />
Commonwealth relationship.<br />
Each of us confronts our own national difficulties, as well as<br />
facing problems of world magnitude. Talking together enables us<br />
to place in perspective our own problems, while gaining strength<br />
and knowledge to cooperate in facing global issues.<br />
Tolerance, a quality we all value, grows with understanding.<br />
It is by exposing our ideas in discussion with each other that<br />
we can test their real worth, and in the process enhance our own<br />
capacity to adjust to world events and the opinions of others.<br />
Parliament is also a forum in which much exposing of opinions occurs<br />
although I am not sure how much adjustment of opinions takes place<br />
as aresult. The role of the Presiding Officer of each House is<br />
of course a vital one. It is his task to maintain the pre-eminence<br />
and good name of Parliament, while protecting the rights and<br />
privileges of individual members. The Presiding Officer<br />
must encourage unstinting observance of the democratic tradition<br />
within the Parliament, supported by the belief that if the highest<br />
standards are maintained in a nation's governing body, they shall,<br />
in turn, be encouraged in all areas of national life. / 2 </p>
<p>It is also the Presiding Officer's task to promote reforms of<br />
the procedures of Parliament which enhance its effectiveness,<br />
provided they do not unnecessarily lose touch with the<br />
centuries of tradition against which these procedures have<br />
evolved. Tradition rightly plays a most important part in the procedures<br />
which our Parliaments follow. Adherence to traditional<br />
forms of debate and passage of legislation provides stability<br />
arnd a greater consciousness of our past.<br />
We should always be looking for ways to improve the way in<br />
which Parliament functions, but there is no merit at all in<br />
changing traditional procedures unless some clear and desirable<br />
benefit can be seen to flow from such a change being made.<br />
It is only natural that this Conference of Speakers and<br />
Presiding Officers should include in its agenda a discussion of<br />
reforms of Parliamentary procedure which serve to strengthen our<br />
democratic institutions.<br />
Conferences such as this enable a better appreciation of the ways of<br />
others, so that, when reviewing our own procedures we are able to<br />
draw on the experience and practices of other nations.<br />
In Australia, we have drawn on the British experience in establishing<br />
this year Legislation Committees of the House of Representatives.<br />
The Committees, which will comprise between 13 and 19 Members,<br />
are a microcosm of the Committee of the whole and are intended<br />
to be an alternative to that Committee. I believe that,<br />
with experience, we shall find that the Legislation Committeeswith<br />
their small membership and without being confined by strict<br />
rules of debate will be able to give closer attention to<br />
proposed laws than at present occurs.<br />
This year we have also blazed a small trail of our own with regard<br />
to the reports of Parliamentary Cominittees. Procedures have been<br />
established which are designed to see that the valuable work of<br />
these Committees receives prompt and proper government consideration.<br />
The Government has undertaken that a Minister will make a statement<br />
to Parliament within six months of the presentation of each report,<br />
outlining the action, if any, which the Government proposes to<br />
take on the recommendations of the report.<br />
Through sharing the knowledge gained from such innovations we can<br />
strengthen the sinews of Parliamentary government. Parliamentary<br />
procedures do vary significantly throughout the Commonwealth,<br />
in large part reflecting our differing cultural heritage and<br />
customs. It is the task of each of us to strive to preserve the best<br />
of our heritage, while retaining a keen interest in new ideas and in<br />
better means of achieving the common ends we share.<br />
I am particularly pleased to welcome the Clerks of the Parliament<br />
to this Conference, for they can bring to bear on these issues their<br />
experience and broad knowledge which we see in evidence on every<br />
Parliamentary sitting day. Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you well in<br />
your deliberations. </p>
