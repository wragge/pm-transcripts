INTERVIEW BY MIKE WILLESEE ON " CURRENT AFFAIR" WITH THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, CANBERRA,<br />
MONDAY, 3RD DECEMBER, 1973<br />
WILLESEE: Welcome to " Current Affair" and on the occasion of<br />
the first birthday of the first Labor Government in 23 years we<br />
are privileged to welcome to a " Current Affair" the Prime Minister,<br />
Mr Whitlam. Mr Whitlam, it's not unusual on these occasions to<br />
talk about the worst mistake that you may have made or the<br />
Government may have made....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think that was your punchline last time I<br />
was with you six months ago.<br />
WILLESEE: Not unkindly I hope but I wonder whether on this<br />
occasion you may not be now in the middle of your biggest mistakethe<br />
referendum?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: Are you serious about the incomes?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: It wasn't forced upon you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you wholeheartedly support it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: Would you like to give the Liberal/ Country Party Government<br />
the power to control or even freeze incomes?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe, that whoever the people elect as a<br />
Government should be able to pass laws about incomes. I don't<br />
believe a Liberal Government would venture to freeze them.<br />
WILLESEE: Are you happy to give a Liberal/ Country Party Government<br />
that chance?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: And that is precisely what you are doing?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, of course, it is. When you alter the<br />
constitution at a referendum, you are giving the authority to<br />
whoever is elected as a Government in the future. My party, in the<br />
past, has sometimes opposed referendums; it has been wrong.<br />
WILLESEE: Are you putting yourself wholeheartedly behind a measure<br />
which the Labor Party is only half-hearted about and the trade<br />
union movement doesn't want? Does that disturb you?.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The trade union movement is half-hearted about it,<br />
they're divided about, the Labor Party supports it.<br />
WILLE SEE: Wholeheartedly? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: But you know that there are many Labor men, members of<br />
your own Caucus, who don't like it?,<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: You don't accept that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. There are some who wculdn't be as enthusiastic<br />
as others, but the Labor Party is supporting it.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you agree thaL a victory iii the incomes proposal<br />
is very unlikely?<br />
PRIMP. MINISTER: It will be much more difficult than on prices.<br />
WILLESEE: In fact, unlikely?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: May be. May be.<br />
WILLESEE: Would you also agree that it would suit your purposes<br />
to win on prices and lose on incomes?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I would prefer to win both. I have always<br />
followed the line that whoever constituted the Australian Government<br />
ought to be able to pass l. aws on such subjects always.<br />
WILLESEE: And you are still convinced that you need this power<br />
that you could not hiave done it with the co-operation of the States?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course ycu couldn't. There are no matters of<br />
national economic management that you can do with the States. Look<br />
at all the matters taxation, value of the currency, credit,<br />
tariffs, all those things have to be done on a national basis<br />
and everybody accepts that. It just happens, that in Australia,<br />
the national Government can't pass laws on prices or incomes th(.<br />
only country in the world where that's the case.<br />
WILLESEE: So this referendum is not in any way a mistake?<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you concede there have been mistakes made in economic<br />
management over the past twelve months?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I suppose there have been some, but there have been<br />
some very great successes in economic management too.<br />
WILLESEE: What about economic promises that you have failed to keep.<br />
Particularly with the Budget?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: What are you thinking of?<br />
WILLESEE: Of indirect taxes. You said that you wouldn't increase<br />
indirect taxes.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I said direct taxes.<br />
WILLESEE: You also said indirect? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think so.<br />
WILLESEE: On September 18 on a " Current Affair" you said, no<br />
you wouldn't. You also said you wouldn't increase company taxes<br />
because they were high enough.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I did that well they are income taxes.<br />
Income taxes on individuals and on companies. I did say, in my<br />
policy speech, that they didn't need to go up.<br />
WILLESEE: On indirect taxes, your party even went so far in the<br />
It's Time brochures to talk about the evils and unfairness of<br />
indirect taxes such as taxes cn cigarettes?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't remember ever saying it myself.<br />
WILLESEE: You don't feel that you....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I don't. This has never been raised in the<br />
Parliament. I don't think we were breaking any promise not to<br />
raise taxes on cigarettes.<br />
WILLESEE: It doesn't make it wrong or right though?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, quite, but you are putting something to me and<br />
you discovered it or revivied it. This is not an issue.<br />
t, . LSE;: On perhaps a more substantive matter, didn't you promise<br />
tIa-It defence spending would be 5 p: er cent of your gross Budget?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There was discussion along these lines back in 1971.<br />
WILLESEE: And it's about 2.9 per cent, I think.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I forget the precise percentages. But, after all,<br />
the military situation in our area has completely changed in the last<br />
two years. Does that mean that we have been wedded to the degree<br />
of expenditure which was considered appropriate thcn? No, well let'-,;<br />
be realistic about these matters. After all, since those things<br />
wvere discussed, over two years ago, there has been detente between<br />
America and China and America has gotoutl of Indo-China. This is<br />
rather a different situation.<br />
WILLESEE: Does this mean that all promises are subjected to<br />
instances that may occur later?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Where there have been such great changes in the<br />
situation you shouldn't rigidly adhere to something which is no longe; 1<br />
relevant. It would be quite wasteful to continue the percentage<br />
of military expenditure this year which might have been considered<br />
appropriate over two years ago.<br />
WILLESEE: On personal income tax, you certainly did keep your promise<br />
not to raise it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course I did.<br />
WILLESEE: But people like Dr Coomnbs and Mr Havike say that it was<br />
a mistake? </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: Who is right?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am. The Cabinet is.<br />
WILLESEE: Is it because it was a Cabinet decision, you're right<br />
or are you sure that in economic terms....?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They happen to be the same. The revenue from<br />
income tax this year has gone up iabout 26 per cent.<br />
WILLESEE: That's larqely due to inflation, isn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, and national growth.<br />
WILLESEE: Don't you think it is unfair to lower income groups to<br />
not increase or restructure the income tax?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It is unfair not to restructure income tax schedules.<br />
We are in the prccess of doing it.<br />
WILLESEE: How do you feel about Mr Hawke disagreeing with you on<br />
a point like that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: He is entitled to express his view, but my colleagues<br />
and I were not persuaced.<br />
WILLESEE: As far as you are concerned, he seems to be doing it more<br />
and more?<br />
PRIME MTNISTEPI: There is one othr issue.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you think he doesn't like you much?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have no reason to think that. We get on very<br />
well together when we are together.<br />
WILLESEE: How long since you have been together?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: About a month. He has been overseas in the meantime<br />
and so have I.<br />
WILLESEE: And he has been back for a couple of days talking about<br />
a very important issue. He hasn't tried to contact you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: The words which have been exchanged between you not<br />
directly haven't been very flatterijq.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: What do you mean the words.<br />
WILLESEE: For example, after you talked about him not representing<br />
the Labor Party or the trade union movement on the question of taxes,<br />
he replied by calling you petulant and gratuitous.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. </p>
<p>WILLESEE: How do you react to that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I keep my cool. I don't reply in kind.<br />
WILLESEE: I think he thought he was replying in king?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I didn't use those words, or anything like them.<br />
WILLESEE: On our program the other night he said that he couldn't<br />
repeat the words on television that you had used.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I didn't use any words on television.<br />
WILLESEE: No, he said that you talked to some pressmen and he<br />
couldn't repeat the words on television.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is gossip.<br />
WILLESEE: How concerned are you about these apparent personal<br />
attacks both ways in fact?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't accept from what you said then that therf:--<br />
would be a personal attack.<br />
1W'ILLESEE: When he talks about your Middle East policy.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The party's Middle East policy.<br />
NIILLESEE-Yes, you spearhead that policy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course I moved the resolution and it was<br />
overwhelmingly carried. I don't think anyone opposed it.<br />
WILLESEE: Mr Hawke says it is an unintelligent policy. Do you<br />
suggest that the Government might<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Now on this, Mr Hawke is at pains to emphasise<br />
that he speaks purely in a personal. sense.<br />
WILLESEE: How can he do this as President of the Party?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know. I don't know, but I merely repeat<br />
that I am expressing the party's policy in this matter. The party's<br />
policy enuciated as recently as last July. T ' here are no political<br />
differences in the national Parliament on the Middle East, there<br />
hasn't been for the last quarter of a century.<br />
WILLESEE: If you are standing by party policy and your Federal<br />
President is not, what are you going to do about it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: He says that he is speaking as an individual.<br />
WILLESEE: Well how can he, he really can't can he?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have answered that. before haven't I.<br />
WILLESEE: Well, what would you like to do about it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I adhere to party policy. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
WILLESEE: He is being devisive isn't he?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: He is speaking as an individual.<br />
WILLESEE: But he's still President of the A. L. P. and talking on<br />
a most important matter of policy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is going back a fair bit, isn't it?<br />
WILLESEE: Yes, but you would remember it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am following party policy, and I support it too.<br />
WILLESEE: Would you like to see Mr Hawke in Parliament?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: Would you support his entry into Par] iami-nnt?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: Would you see an early rise....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have tried to get him into Parliament since 1963.<br />
WILLESEE: Are you trying as hard now as you tried before?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will help him whenever he wants to get in.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you think he would go straight into the ministry?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think it's likely.<br />
WILLESEE: As likely as Mr Young?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Perhaps more likely. Are you trying to help<br />
Mr Hawke get into a ministry or Mr Young, you know that question<br />
like this don't help either.<br />
WILLESEE: They've got to get into Parliament first though haven't<br />
they? Just a last point on Mr Hawke. I suppose his language was<br />
strongest out of all his attacks on your Cabinet decision on the<br />
new Sydney airport at Galston an act of political imbecility<br />
I think he said. Was it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: Was it irresponsible to ecide on Galston the way you did?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: Is it true that you just .: at around and picked one out<br />
of political expediency?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: But you didn't have a proper inquiry into the site before<br />
you made a decision did you? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: Yes we did.<br />
WILLESEE: Is that available?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: Has it been made public?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It will be.<br />
WILLESEE: When?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are further ones which have been sought and<br />
will be made public. Now let's get some practicality on this. The<br />
cheapest and quickest way to get adequate airport facilities in<br />
Sydney is to extend the Mascot runway into Botany Bay. This would<br />
be a very difficult political thing to do. The Liberals realise<br />
that because they won't endorse a proposal either, either the State<br />
Liberals or the federal Liberals, so whatever site is suggested<br />
will. immediately be attacked. But nobody is prepared, at this<br />
stage, to endorse the quickest and cheapest proposal.<br />
WILLESEE: In other words, do you agree that it was political<br />
expediency at least in as much as you....<br />
PR. IME MINISTER: Not to have Mascot may be said to have been<br />
political exp-ediency but it is also political expediency to which<br />
everybody in the federal Parliament falls prey, because nobody<br />
is prep,-, recl at this stage to urge the doubling of the runways into<br />
Potarny Day at Mascot. Let's be practical about it; dorn't criticise<br />
the Labor Government for refusing to do something that the Liberal<br />
Government refused to do and that the Liberal Opposition refuses<br />
to advocate, and that the State-Liberal Government refuses to<br />
advocate. WILLESEE: You hardly sound convincing about Galston not being a<br />
mistake. It was a mistake wasn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
VWILLESEE: It was a political mistake?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Was it?<br />
WILLESEE: It would seem so from the Paramatta by-election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Why do you think we lost only on that? It didn't<br />
help in Paramatta, that's true.<br />
WI! LESEE: And you are not prepared to concede that it might have<br />
been a mistake....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't believe that if we had postponed the<br />
decision, I doubt very much whether we would have won Paramatta.<br />
WILLESEE: Why not?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Why should we, we never have. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
WILLESEE: Twelve months ago now you went within a few votes of gettinq<br />
that seat?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WITLL Sf-J I nu you arce satisfied with your p.;: forLiances as ca<br />
Government since?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you believe......( unclear) a change in Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course it is.<br />
WILLESEE: Well why would you expect then that you would lose such<br />
a close seat?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't believe that the circumstances at the time<br />
made it easy to win it. Why do you think that Mr Bowen chose that<br />
stage to retire?<br />
WILLESEE: I don't know why he chose to retire. Are you reflecting<br />
on your own personal popularity at that stage?<br />
PFIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WJLLFSEE Looking at the Labor performance generally, Open Covernment<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WLLESEE: There has been a lot of criticism that you have failed<br />
t-. o supply one of the things you talked about most open governricnt.<br />
How do you react to that criticism?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well it would be a completely wrong assertion.<br />
There has never been a Government which has allowed the public to<br />
participate in decision and which has informed the public cf<br />
' ccisons to such a great degree.<br />
WILLESEE: Is that sufficient?<br />
PRIME iIINISTER: Certainly. I mean we are infinitely better<br />
because they would just not do these things we've done them, we've<br />
started them.<br />
WTLLESEE: But at your weekly press conference which does indicate<br />
open government, you so often decline to answer questions or cut<br />
interviewers off?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, that's not true. Everybody gets one question,<br />
and that takes about half an hour and that's fair enough.<br />
WILLESEE: But you indicate, no more on that, or I don't want to<br />
answer something on that. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Obviously I will not discuss possible changes in<br />
say the value of the currency or an imposition to taxation, i. e.<br />
anyone who askes a question on those subjects knows quite well<br />
he won't get an answer. He may think it's smart to ask me because<br />
then some people might think superficially that I'm not being<br />
forthcoming, that I am being cagey. But, in fact, no Prime Minister,<br />
no minister, would answer a question on things like that and they<br />
know it. And there is another matter where, of course, I will not<br />
answer questions and that is on installations which other countries<br />
have in this country and which they want to keep secret because it<br />
is not our secret alone.<br />
WILLESEE: But you weren't saying that last year, nor was Mr Barnard.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We were, we were.<br />
WILLESEE: I thought Mr Barnard, in particular, was saying that<br />
these questions should be answered?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: He has. On the very first day that the new<br />
Parliament sat he told the Australian people through the Parliament<br />
all that it was open for Australia to say and also a great deal in<br />
which we persuaded the Americans to agree to our saying. Now<br />
this was the very first day we sat. The things which it was quite<br />
absurd to supress we have released or we are authorised by our allies<br />
to release. But the things which we are not authorised to release,<br />
of course, we won't, and we never said we would.<br />
WILLESEE: In general terms, not just defencc matters, would you<br />
be prepared to say<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In defence and fisccil matters. Obviously one doesn't<br />
comment because it can produce speculation.<br />
WILLESEE: Looking at the whole spectrum of government, would you be<br />
prepared to say that you are satisfied with the level of open<br />
government? PRIME MINISTER: With the progress which has Leen made, yes. But<br />
there is a limit to what you can get through. For instance, we haven't<br />
yet been able to pass the ombudsman legislation or to pass the<br />
freedom of information legislation. The sheer weight of the<br />
legislation program has prevented us doing it this year. But<br />
we are preparing it.<br />
WILLESEE: Looking at the hindrances and other obstacles that you<br />
have had to overcome during the year, is CF. ucus the biggest?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: Caucus is a hindrance to you.... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: No, not at all, of course it's not. The weekly<br />
or more frequent meeting of all Labor members of the Parliament is<br />
one of the great sources of the Labor Party's strength. Because<br />
if people know that if they elect a Labor member to represent<br />
them in the federal Parliament he will have a full regular<br />
opportunity to participate in the decisions of the Government, if it<br />
is a Labor Government, or the decisions that an Opposition takes if<br />
it is a Labor Opposition. That is,* if the people elect a member of<br />
Parliam~ ent who will be sharing the responsibility, he just won't be<br />
on the outside not even looking in, as happens with any Liberal<br />
backbencher or Country Party backbencher.<br />
WILLESEE: Wel. haven't you often been embarrassed by Caucus when<br />
it reverses Cabinet decisions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: Are you happy about that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They' are entitled to do it.<br />
WILLESEE: Are you happy about it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Sometimes I have been, sometimes I am not.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you support the principle of Caucus being able to<br />
review a Cabinet decision and change it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course. I not only support it, I advocate it.<br />
I believe that a Labor Government is a much better government than<br />
a Liberal Government because you get more people involved in the<br />
decisions. But let's put thi s in perspective: I suppose there might<br />
be half a dozen certainly no more decisions which the Caucus<br />
has over-ruled a decision by the Cabinet. Cabinet decisions this<br />
year are well over a thousand in number, so it is a mighty small<br />
percentage. WILLESEE: You are minimising the obstacle the Caucus could be, but<br />
recently you threatened to resign if Caucus insisted on having a<br />
say on the tariff matter.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If they insisted on seeing a Tariff Board Report<br />
before the decision was made and announced on the report. Yes, I<br />
did, it's the same as if Cauicus were to say we want the Budget, we<br />
want to know what's in the Budget before it is published.<br />
WIILLESEE: So you don't support all the power that Caucus would like<br />
to take to itself?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Caucus doesn't want to take that power to itself.<br />
Your saying that there was a great deal of lobbying and, naturally,<br />
therefore, public reaction to the Tariff Board inquiry into colour<br />
television. Caucus, last Wednesday, approved of that decision no<br />
news, I don't think there was a thing in the paper about it. They<br />
approved it, there was no longer any drama about it.<br />
WILLESEE: Yes, but hadn't you taken the sting out of the drama by<br />
your previous action? You virtually resolved the conflict with a<br />
successful threat? </p>
<p>-11-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I didn't. It only had to be stated for people,<br />
and there were very few who ever contemplated that Caucus should<br />
see Tariff Board reports which might have financial advantages or<br />
disadvantages to people in the community before the reports were<br />
considered by Cabinet and Cabinet had made and announced the<br />
decision. There would be very grave mischief, as everybody sees,<br />
if people who are not sworn to secrecy ministers and public service<br />
advisers are sworn to secrecy but if people who were not sworn to<br />
secrecy were consulted when there was likely to be a change in the<br />
interest rate or a change in the value of the currency, or changes<br />
in taxes or changes in tariffs. In cases like that, obviously,<br />
the decisions must be made by people who are sworn to secrecy. Now,<br />
Caucus accepts that. What you are referring to is a Caucus<br />
impediment in some way is a notice of motion that was moved. It<br />
hadn't been considered by Caucus. I was asked a question in Parliament<br />
by a Liberal and I gave the only answer that any minister could give.<br />
WILLESEE: Caucus is certainly the impediment to your ability to<br />
speak with absolute confidence because you can be overruled and so<br />
is the Federal Conference of the Labor Party. Do you ever get sick<br />
of the aparatus of the Labor Party to be able to second-guess you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I've sponsored; I've also secured a very<br />
great number of changes in the procedures of the Federal Conference<br />
and the Caucus, and I'm very happy the way they work. I usen't to be,<br />
but after all there have been changes since those days.<br />
VIILLESEE: Do you think there is any national difference between your<br />
style of Prime Ministership which some see as a Presidential style<br />
and the inherent democracy of the Labor Party?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: None at all?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Labor Party believes in representative governme~' nt<br />
and there have to be some people or groups of people that are<br />
chosen to carry out some jobs. You can't have a public meeting<br />
deciding everything. You can't have all the memrbers of the Labor Party<br />
in Australia deciding everything. The whole system of representative<br />
government depends on people being able to chose their representatives<br />
f: or certain jobs. And in some cases, the Prime Minister would be<br />
the representative. To give you an instance: if you are going to<br />
suggest somebody as Governor-General, the Prime Minister presumably<br />
has the principal and even the sole job on that. There are others<br />
where a ministry does it; there are others where the Caucus docs it.<br />
WILLESEE: The Labor Party has a lot of natural characteristics<br />
un. derstood particularly by Labor men. Do you . think one of them could<br />
he a dislike of leaders who threaten to resign?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: You have done it three times now, I think.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: When was the last time? Years ago, and the systerm<br />
has changed since then hasn't it.<br />
WILLESEE: No, the last time was on the tariffs? </p>
<p>-12-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well this is entirely hypothetical, as I was asked<br />
what would happen on the basis of newspaper reports of this<br />
notice of motion which had been given.<br />
WILLESEE: Was this really hypothetical, I thought it was a real<br />
threat? PRIME MINISTER: No, it was a notice of motion.<br />
WILLESEE: Well, there have been two other occasions a few years<br />
ago and more recently on the U. S. Bases. That was within the last<br />
twelve months, was it not?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Where was there a threat to resign, to use your<br />
own words there?<br />
WILLESEE: I am not aware that it was a public threat but do you<br />
deny that....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not sure of any such threat I am using your<br />
terms. This is all very dramatic but I don't think you remember<br />
WILLESEE: But you were pushed to reveal certain details about,<br />
I forget the exact installations, omega may have been included,<br />
U. S. installations.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Omega is not here.<br />
WILLESEE: Arny U. S. installations? Do you deny that there was<br />
ever conflict between you and the party over that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There was never a proposal. You are assuming<br />
what my reaction would be if some proposal were carried. I don't<br />
even remember a proposal being made.<br />
WILLESEE: H1ow much of a handicap has it been to have inexperienced<br />
ministers who haven't been accustomed to a hard and long workload.<br />
How difficult has that been?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It is true that most of the ministers have had to<br />
work in a different way to the way they had worked previously.<br />
WILLESEE: I'm not suggesting a fault?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I know, I know you're not. This is not one<br />
of the questions in the mistake syndrome which you said was to be<br />
the purpose of the interview.<br />
People have to work differently obviously as ministers to<br />
the way they workoce in many cases for many years in Parliament in<br />
Opposition. WILLESFF: Even physically you have had three ministers collapse. </p>
<p>-13-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, there has been a very heavy workload. This is<br />
partly, of course, because we have been a very diligent Parliament<br />
this year. There have been more bills passed than in any previous<br />
year and of course, there are very very many more bills which have<br />
to be introduced or which will still have to be debated this year.<br />
It is a record legislative year in the history of this country.<br />
WILLESEE: Are you thinking of a reshuffle in the ministry?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: You don't have one planned?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: On the union movement, I suppose the most outstanding<br />
difference between this government's last year and the record now<br />
is that you siad there would be fewer strikes than in the previous<br />
year. PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: Now, the only figure I have seen are from January to<br />
August and there were more strikes.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes I think that is probably right.<br />
WILLESEE: How did you make such a mistake?<br />
PRIME MIU" ISTER: Obviously there is more likelihood of strikes<br />
when there is full employment and there is full employment now.<br />
We have produced it. Last year there... . The other thing is<br />
WILLESEE: And you anticipate....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, that is right. There is another factor.<br />
Most of the strikes in Australia, the ones which have inconvenienced<br />
the public, have come through disputes between the State Liberal<br />
Government and their employees and I think there can be no doubt<br />
that in some of these cases the Liberal Governments have been quite<br />
provocative. WILLESEE: Are you satisfied with the support you have had from the<br />
union movement?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, not entirely. I think that some cf the unions<br />
in New South Wales in recent weeks or months were quite unhelpful.<br />
WILLESEE: At one stage when you were taking . about inflation you<br />
said you had an assurance from Mr Hawke that the unions would show<br />
restraint in seeking further wage increases. Mr Hawke has denied<br />
that. PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: How disappointed did that make you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I thought I understood him quite clearly<br />
but apparently he changed his mind, or I hadn't understood him. </p>
<p>-14-<br />
WILLESEE: Which do you believe?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The former.<br />
WILLESEE: Have you had enough of Mr Hawke?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, no, but I think you have asked enough questions<br />
on this subject.<br />
WILLESEE: It is very important though, as well as being the trade<br />
union leader he is the party's President and there is an obvious<br />
conflict between the two of you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: On the Middle East.<br />
WILLESEE: On that matter of assuranres from a personal conversation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The only instances are these referendums the, one<br />
on prices. Now, the union movement had differences of opinion on<br />
this.<br />
WILLESEE: Can I ask one last question on Mr Hawke?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course, you are entitled to.<br />
WILLESEE: Is he an impediment to you enjoying better relations with<br />
the union movement.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: Despite conversations like....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Let's get this straight. Mr Hawke gives interviews<br />
in a more frequent and informal manner than I am able to do, but you<br />
ask me whether I want him in the Parliament. I said yes. I also<br />
ought to take the opportunity to say, in the last. elections and in<br />
the next elections, whenever they come, he will be a most effective<br />
campaigner. Now don't get these things out ef proportion. There<br />
are two instances where you have quoted a difference of opinion. In<br />
one of them he is stressing that he speaks as &amp; n individual.<br />
WILLESEE: And you have also said that you don't know how he can do<br />
that as President of the Labor Party?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well how many times do I have to answer that.<br />
WILLESEE: No, but I thought you were<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I wasn't. The answer is the same no matter<br />
how often you ask it.<br />
WILLESEE: Yes, I need reassurance sometimes.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. You have become very uncertain-apparently?<br />
Wff14 t t; yes. FHave you becomc more uncertain after twelve months,<br />
Prime Miii; ter"<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Most people would allege the opposite. </p>
<p>WILLESEE: What do you think?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't think I had.<br />
WILLESEE: Looking at your Government's relations with the business<br />
community, do you think your report card could be marked " room<br />
for improvement"?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We would never, clearly, get top marks from many<br />
people in the business community.<br />
WILLESEE: Well I don't think you have got 50 out of 100 at this<br />
stage, let alone top marks.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not very surprised at that the report card<br />
that they make. But afterall, the people that have criticised us<br />
most in the business community scarcely have very much public<br />
support. We have been criticised very much by many of the overseas<br />
mining interests. Now, there is no doubt that something had to be<br />
done about the growing overseas control of our mineral resources.<br />
We've done it; we have therefore offended many people. There is<br />
no doubt in my mind that it needed to be done and the public are glad<br />
we have done it and the public expects us to go on doing it more.<br />
WILLESEE: But when you go so far as to say that you want 100 per cent<br />
ownership by Australian sources of all our fuel sources, that must<br />
create uncertainty and even fear in a lot of industries.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
WILLESEE: They don't know when you are going to do it and how you<br />
are going to do it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There was a lot of surprise, a lot of pressure and<br />
so on a few weeks or months ago on this issue but there can be no<br />
question now about the public support there is for what we have<br />
been trying to do to secure Australia's energy resources. It is<br />
quite absurd that companies should be given licences or leases by<br />
State Governments to explore resources which we may need very much<br />
ourselves, or to explore those resources at prices which are less<br />
than our customers would be prepared to pay. Now, these people,<br />
they were not pleased with what we did I can understand they were<br />
not pleasexdwith what we did but there can be no doubt that it was<br />
necessary in the public interest.<br />
WILLESEE: Yes, but you have still left a lot of uncertainty around?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, we haven't. We have been quite clear and<br />
quite consistent and we haven't been deflected from our duty, our<br />
purpose, by the criticism by overseas companies.<br />
WILLESEE: After your first twelve months, you now face a position<br />
where you may have to go to the polls again soon potentially<br />
you face a double dissolution.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: If the Senate knocks back either of those two major<br />
proposals, health insurance or schools, will you certainly go to the<br />
people or is there room for compromise on either issue? </p>
<p>-16-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Only one of these matters has been debated so far<br />
in the Parliament, that's the Commonwealth Assistance to Schools on<br />
a Needs Basis. There was a vote in the House of Representatives<br />
on it. But the Liberals, the Country Party, the have in( L<br />
yet made up their mind what they will do about it in the Senate.<br />
Well let' s wait to see what they do about it there.<br />
WILLESEE: Is there room for compromise?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, let's wait and see what they do. Clearly<br />
the matter they put to a vote in the House of Representatives we<br />
couldn't be expected to accept because we had proved to the people<br />
in the 1969 elections and the elections last year too, and there<br />
can be no question that we are commuitted, and the public expects,<br />
that Commonwealth assistance to schools should be on a needs basis.<br />
And then the other thing you mentioned about universal health<br />
insurance that also has been put to the people in the 1969 and 1972<br />
elections. There can be no doubt that they expect us to do something<br />
about it. But this hasn't been debated in the Parliament yet, andi<br />
the bills only came in last Thursday night.<br />
WILLESEE: And you don't realise the possibility of some room for<br />
ma nouevr e?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I will wait to see what is done in the Senate on<br />
these r~ atters.<br />
WILLESEE: Finally, Prime Minister, looking at you personally, I amn<br />
sure you would be most surprised if I didn't ask a question about<br />
to quote that friend of yours againt. Petulant, arrogrant and<br />
as some other critics see it, a quick, cruel tongue.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would be very surprised if you didn't ask chat.<br />
WILLESEE: Well let me add to the question. It ranges from<br />
Paul Hasluck and the glass of water to witless men up to the<br />
Dr Forbes incident.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Now, how many years ago were these, how many years?<br />
WILLESEE: I agree fully that they were few and far between, but<br />
they are a most notable characteristic of your career?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Now, don't you assert, don't Vou insinuate that<br />
there is any stress between the Governor-General and me. There is<br />
not. We were both in error thent, we both realise it and it would<br />
be better if you wouldn't always bring that. out of the dossier.<br />
It doesn't suit him and it doesn't suit me, and it was years ago.<br />
WILLESEE: I accept that they were gr-nerally few and far between.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: About the witless men. The witless men quote was<br />
nine years ago.<br />
WILLESEE: It was 1967.<br />
PRIME MINISOTER: No, it wao 1966, 1966 or 1965. Whatever it was, it was<br />
years ago and the structure of the party has altered since then. </p>
<p>-17-<br />
WILLESEE: It doesn't matter.... it is a long time ago.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: And it might have been a necessary way to get<br />
change. There may be suggestions that change could have been<br />
achieved without what I said then, but that is conjecture, the<br />
fact is that change did come about.<br />
WILLESEE: I don't wish to question you about any one incident, the<br />
fact is that in any portrait of the Whitlam career those points<br />
will always stand out and people tend to judge you accordingly.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: As if this trait of yours is damaging.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. Well, every time I go on an interview with<br />
you, you'll go through this and a couple of other incidents so I<br />
suppose.... ( unclear)<br />
WILLESEE: But you must realise, with respect, Prime Minister,<br />
the last one was the incident with Dr Forbes in the House.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You were not there on the Wednesday night or on<br />
the Thursday morning.<br />
WILLESEE: No, but I have spoken to a lot of people who were.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: And they told you how Dr Forbes behaved on Wednesday<br />
night?<br />
WILLESEE: Alright, if I was interviewing Dr Forbes I would ask<br />
him about his behaviour.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: But, I mean, were you told how he behaved on<br />
Wednesday night?<br />
WILLESEE: I think that is unfair of you because....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well isn't it a necessary preliminary?<br />
WILLESEE: Well, aren't you justifying what you did?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The fact was that Dr Forbes did behave excessively,<br />
intemperately on Wednesday night and everybody in the Chamber<br />
realises that.<br />
WILLESEE: Are you satisfied that whatever he did justified your<br />
reaction and your....?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: What do you mean my reaction?<br />
WILLESEE: Your unparliamentary language?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: What unparliamentary language?<br />
WILLESEE: You said: " It's what he has or had or put in his guts<br />
that rooted him". </p>
<p>18-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, and there was one person who heard that,<br />
Mr Snedden. Hansard didn't hear it, the Speaker didn't, the clerks<br />
didn't, it wasn't on radio, nobody heard it in the gallery, and<br />
Mr Snedden thought that it would be good politics to dob me in.<br />
WILLESEE: Was it wise of you to say it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, of course it wasn't, but I didn't think he<br />
would dob me in. It was a quite aside across the table.<br />
WILLESEE: Does that justify it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well he said something before that which when it<br />
came to light the Speaker said he would have required him to withdraw<br />
if he had heard it. The fact is that he said something which only<br />
I heard, I replied in a way that only he heard, then he decided to<br />
dob me in. Nobody in the Chamber or outside it heard it.<br />
WILLESEE: You have accused me of raising it, but really I think<br />
you must accept that you did with the Dr Forbes incident or<br />
certainly.... PRIME MINISTER: Those words you have quoted, of course, shouldn't,<br />
be used in Parliament and they were not heard in the Parliament,<br />
and Billy Snedden mentioned them so that theY~ would be recorded.<br />
WILLESEE: Well let's presume....<br />
PRIME MINIISTER: I withdrew them too, as of course I would have<br />
had to, once....<br />
WILLESEE: Are you....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: Let's presume we have another interview in twelve months<br />
time, and I hope we<br />
PRIME MINISTER: On another channel?<br />
WILLESEE: It will be another channel?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you think we would have to talk * About this again or<br />
do you think....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would expect that you would go through the<br />
catalogue again.<br />
WILLESEE: I would prefer not to go through it again if there was<br />
nothing between now and then. Do you think that's likely?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would expect there would be nothing between now<br />
and then. I would expect that you would raise it, but I would still<br />
enjoy appearing with you.<br />
WILLESEE: Two more questions. Have you suffered any disillusionment<br />
in the last twelve months, personally? </p>
<p>-19-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No more than any politican who has been around<br />
for a long time suffers.<br />
WILLESEE: But this is different, this is the year you have bcn<br />
Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: On balance, I would say that I have been les:.<br />
disillusioned this year than in any of the previous 20 years<br />
I'd had in Parliament. Yes, it has been a very satisfying anc,<br />
fulfilling period in my life.<br />
WILLESEE: Lut isolating your expectations of the Prime Ministership,<br />
has there been disillusionment in that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: In some areas we have been able to do much more,<br />
mucL, quicker than I would have hoped. In others, we haven't been<br />
able to go as far.<br />
WILLESEE: Are we going to see a different Gough Whitlam next year?<br />
PR&amp; F MINISTER: I guess he is a developing personality.<br />
WILLESEE: Which way do you think he is developing?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Improving all the time, going from strength to<br />
strength. WILIESFE. Well. the best Foreign Minister, is he also the<br />
best Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: HIe was the besit Foreign Mirister ( or a generatio.<br />
is what he said.<br />
WILLESEE: And the best Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: For a generation. And you are the best interviewer<br />
for a generation.<br />
WILLESEE: That's very kind of you to say that. Thanks for talking<br />
with us and I hope to see you again in ainother twelve months. </p>
