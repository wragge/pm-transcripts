PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 22 AUGUST 1988<br />
Following the resignation of Mr Hayden from the ministry on<br />
17 August and in order to avoid protracted speculation, I am<br />
announcing today changes within the Ministry which I will be<br />
recommending to the Governor General. The Governor General<br />
has agreed to my making such a statement at this time.<br />
I do not believe it would be in the interests of an<br />
efficient transition and the effective management of the<br />
portfolios involved to bring the changes into effect<br />
immediately, on the eve of the resumption of Parliament.<br />
Accordingly, the changes I propose are prospective, to come<br />
into effect at the beginning of the parliamentary recess<br />
with the Ministers to be sworn on 2 September.<br />
Pending that, ministers will continue in their present<br />
portfolios while beginning to familiarise themselves with<br />
their new assignments. Mr Duffy will continue for this<br />
interim period to have responsibility for Foreign Affairs<br />
and Trade, as already announced at the time of Mr Hayden's<br />
resignation.<br />
Caucus will meet in the week beginning 29 August to elect a<br />
new member of the Ministry. The changes I will be<br />
recommending are as follows:<br />
Senator Evans to be portfolio minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs and Trade.<br />
Mr Willis to be portfolio Minister for Transport<br />
and Communications..<br />
Mr Morris to be Minister for Industrial Relations.<br />
Mr Morris will continue to be Minister Assisting<br />
the Treasurer.<br />
Senator Ray to be portfolio Minister for<br />
Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs,<br />
and also as Minister Assisting me for Multicultural<br />
Affairs. He will also take over from Senator Evans<br />
the role of Manager of Government Business in the<br />
Senate. Two other Ministers to be sworn to the Transport<br />
and Communications portfolio to work with Mr<br />
Willis. These Ministers will be Mr Punch and the<br />
new Minister chosen by Caucus.<br />
-1340 </p>
<p>Mr Holding to be Minister for the Arts and<br />
Territories. Mr Holding will also be Minister<br />
Assisting the Minister for Immigration, Local<br />
Government and Ethnic Affairs and Minister<br />
Assisting the Prime Minister across the range of my<br />
portfolio. in addition I have appointed Mr Howe as Minister<br />
Assisting me on Social Justice issues. This is in<br />
addition to Mr Howe's existing portfolio<br />
responsibilities as Minister for Social Security.<br />
Mr Holding has indicated to me that he would not be seeking<br />
a Ministerial position after the next election. In this<br />
context he believed it appropriate, at a time when these<br />
changes are being made, to establish the opportunity for<br />
continuity up to and beyond the next election in the<br />
important portfolio responsibility of immigration and Ethnic<br />
Affairs. I thank him for providing this opportunity and<br />
welcome the fact that he will continue to be involved in<br />
this area and have responsibility for it in the House of<br />
Representatives. These adjustments will ensure that the Government continues<br />
to have a Ministerial team of the highest calibre deployed<br />
in a way which takes full account of its policy and<br />
administrative priorities and the changing relative<br />
workloads of portfolios. There will be no changes in the<br />
number of departments or Ministers in the Cabinet and the<br />
roles and tasks of portfolios will remain unchanged. The<br />
changes continue the objective I announced following the<br />
elections last July of enhancing Ministerial control.<br />
Transport and communications are vital inputs to all<br />
competitive Australian industries and as such this sector<br />
will continue to be a major focus in the Government's<br />
micro-economic reform agenda. Mr Willis will be able to<br />
continue these processes with the augmented assistance of<br />
two Ministers.<br />
The appointment of Mr Howe demonstrates clearly the<br />
importance of social justice issues to the Government and<br />
their central role in the Government's decision-making<br />
processes. It will also formalise the assistance which Mr<br />
Howe has been giving me for some months on social justice<br />
issues, which extend beyond the Social Security portfolio.<br />
I have reviewed the responsibilities and workload of Home<br />
Affairs within the Administrative Services portfolio and<br />
have concluded that there is no longer a need for an<br />
additional Minister to support Mr West. This arrangement<br />
more closely reflects current workloads between portfolios,<br />
especially now that the major tasks associated with the<br />
Government's program of electoral reform are complete, and<br />
the move to the new Parliament House, which is within the<br />
portfolio responsibilities of the Minister for<br />
Administrative Services, has taken place. 134.1 </p>
<p>3.<br />
I will be making a full statement of the details of the new<br />
Ministry arrangements including the representation of<br />
Ministers in the other Chamber, following the Caucus<br />
election of the new member of the Ministry next week.<br />
