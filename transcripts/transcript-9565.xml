PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
MR COURT'S PROPOSED INQUIRY<br />
The inquiry into the Easton affair proposed by the Premier of Western<br />
Australia, Mr Court, and his Liberal Party should be abandoned because it is<br />
a flagrant abuse of the State's statutory processes.<br />
This proposed action would breach an important protocol of Australian<br />
politics that the judicial process should not be abused in the pursuit of<br />
purely political objectives.<br />
No self-respecting judge, former judge, Queen's Counsel or barrister should<br />
consent to be party to this flagrant abuse of the system. The politicallymotivated<br />
inquiry threatened by Mr Court should be treated with the utter<br />
contempt it deserves.<br />
Mr Court and the WA Liberals know that in relation to the Easton matter, no<br />
present or past member of the Western Australian Parliament committed any<br />
illegality. Nor was there any maladministration, or fraudulent use of<br />
taxpayers' money. The tabling of the Easton petition has already been<br />
reviewed twice by the State Parliament, and the debate over it is now purely<br />
a political matter.<br />
There are absolutely no objective grounds upon which Mr Court can justify<br />
the provision of public funds, and the abuse of the statutory process, for the<br />
inquiry he now proposes.<br />
It is an improper ploy, and such an inquiry would devalue the integrity of any<br />
person who agreed to conduct it.<br />
