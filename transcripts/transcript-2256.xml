VISIT TO PAPUA / NEW GUINEA-: FAREWELL BROADCAST<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr._ John2Gorton_<br />
s peaking over ABC Radio, Port Moretsby XLLY1970<br />
Today I leave the Territory. My visit has, of necessity, been all too<br />
short. But it has included major announcements of new policy, and I have seen<br />
many different places, talked to many different people, and been able to come to<br />
some cc.. nclusions. The major policy changes announced are, of course, that there would be<br />
a significant transfer of power, power to make decisions, from Canberra to elected<br />
representatives of Territory people.<br />
The Administrator's Executive Council will n.-ow have authority to<br />
allocate nioney for recurrent expenses in many fields aiA for minor works and the<br />
House of Assembly will have to be asked to appropriate such monies in the way<br />
recommended. These proposals, which were announced in some detail last Monday, are<br />
significant steps along the road to ultimate self-government.<br />
I also re-emphasised that the Australian Government bdieves the<br />
Territory is on the road which leads to full self-government. There can be no<br />
turning back from that road. It must be travelled to the end. Buz it is not for the<br />
Australian Government to dictate the speed at which the ultimate goal is reached.<br />
It is not for us to set an arbitrary date and say that on that date we will<br />
force full self-government on the people of the Territory whether they want it or not.<br />
Instead our attitude is that the majority of the people of the Territory should decide<br />
when they wish full self-government and when they do this they will get what they<br />
want. In the meantime the possibility of different regional responsibilities for<br />
regions at different ievels of development could well be examined.<br />
It will come as no surprise to the people of the Territory that I found<br />
the Highland people, almost to a man, violently opposed to self-government in<br />
1972 or on any fixed date. They do not want this before they feel they are ready<br />
for it and of course, the Highlanders make up the majority of the whole population.<br />
In the coastal areas, Wewak, Lae, Madang, opinion was more<br />
divided but there was a strong majority opinion expressed at all the meetings<br />
which I attended, that the people did not want full self -government until a time of<br />
their own choosing. And in these areas there was for the most part, tolerance<br />
ar~ d a working together to build a strong edifice zan the economic foundations which<br />
have been so well laid. // 2 </p>
<p>In Bougainville where there has been talk in some quarters of a desire<br />
to secede from the Territory I formed the strong impression that the people Nvished<br />
for much more time and thought and discussion on that suggestion before they came<br />
to any conclusion. In the Gazelle Peninsula the sadly divided state of the people was evident.<br />
I asked for discussion between the two groups for a cessation of the violence used<br />
by the Mautaungans, and for an attempt to arrive at solutions of problems by<br />
majority opinion with discussion and without hate and anger. I renewed the offer of<br />
a referendum on the multi-racial council and asked the Mautaungans to discuss their<br />
problems with me but they refused. I can only hope that the call for reasonable<br />
discussion will bear fruit but, in the meantime, the law must be enforced.<br />
[ t is impossible for example, to permit land, which has been bought by<br />
the Administration for distribution to Tolais, to be illegally occupied by squatters.<br />
This illegal squatting is taking place at the very time when the Land Board is<br />
considering, from Tolai and Bainings people, applications for the 350 blocks<br />
available. If permitted to continue it will retard the chances of orderly economic<br />
development in the Gazelle Peninsula, and, indeed, if squatting is permitted on<br />
Administration Land bought for distribution to Tolai, what will prevent squatting<br />
on land already held by Tolai. This matter is too important to be left<br />
undetermined, Illegal occupation of land must and will be stopped.<br />
The future of the Territory as a whole is, at this stage, certain in sorre<br />
way, uncertain in others. It is certain that it will eventually attain self-government<br />
and independence. I hope it will remain unfragmented and that different parts of it<br />
will not secede. For if it is fragmented then each separate part will be economically<br />
and politically less strong than the whole.<br />
And I believe the people in every part, if secession were to take place,<br />
would be worse off. But this question is one that will, no doubt, be settled by the<br />
local people themselves, perhaps at the time of independence, and the answer to<br />
this is not certain. In the meantime as new roads are built from the Highlands to the Coast,<br />
as new districts are opened up, as more schools are built and staffed, as better<br />
agriculture is taught and new crops are tested, as mineral wealth is exploited and<br />
as industries arise, I think the Territory will, at an accellerated pace, go forward<br />
to that strong independent economic position, which alo. ie can ensure continued<br />
economic progress and continued political stability.<br />
There must and will be more local participation in, and ownership of,<br />
businesses and industries and there should be a continuing partnership between those<br />
who live in the Territory and Australians.<br />
I leave with great hope for the future of all the people of this land, and I<br />
leave with a feeling that we all owe a great debt of gratitude to those Australians who<br />
have selflessly taught in the missions, have selflessly brought law and order and<br />
honest administration to what was but yesterday a primitive country and I think we<br />
all owe, too, an equal debt of gratitude to those local people in all regions who have<br />
helped in this task are still helping in it and are taking more and more<br />
responsibility to continue it, for in them lies the hope of the future of the Territory. </p>
