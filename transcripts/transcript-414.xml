NO. TV RZCORDING: " TALK TO THE NATION"<br />
BY ' THE PRIME MINISTER T" HE 1FlT.' HON. R. G. MENZIES<br />
6TH DEMBER, 1261<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
This, you may be glad to know is my last appearance<br />
on Television in this election campaign, and it's a very brief<br />
one five minutes I think. Therefore all I need do, all I<br />
can do, is to give you a very quick summary of what I beieve to<br />
be the issue in this election,<br />
Now I've been all around Australia I must say I have<br />
had some f the best meetings I have ever had in my life and<br />
I've been delighted to find wherever I go that people are not<br />
only conscious of the development of this country in recent<br />
years, but they are very proud of it and they are looking<br />
forward to the next period of development because they know<br />
that this means everything to them; not only in terms of<br />
national strength, but in terms of individual advancement,<br />
rising living standards, high and rising employment.<br />
Now what has been done in these recent years has<br />
been done by what I will describe as a system of co-operation,<br />
Commonwealth Government, State Governments private enterprise<br />
hardly any of t. hese big things that are going on in Australia<br />
fail to reflect that particular friendly co-operative<br />
association. And of course we have been aided in all this by<br />
the fact that into Australia there has come a vast amount of<br />
capital, a vast amount of skill and a great number of people.<br />
And all these things have worked together, in an atmosphere of<br />
good credit, and good repute, and stable government, to<br />
produce the results that we have seen and to produce tose even<br />
greater results that will be seen in the years to come.<br />
Now on the other hand we have our opponents tthe<br />
Socialists of the Labour Party, who offer you very li te in<br />
terms of development. They haven't had so much to say about it,<br />
but they offer you handouts, very attractive offers, on the good<br />
old socialist principle. But where they stand on the matters<br />
that are essential to development is another question.<br />
They appear to object to investment, here from<br />
overseas. All they have to do is to cut it off like that, and<br />
the result will be seen before very long in a slowing down of<br />
the national progress. dhere do they stand on industrial<br />
peace? Because the high level of industrial peace has meant a<br />
great deal in these recent years to national progress, and one<br />
of the elements in it has been, for example, the democratic<br />
control of the trades unions by the secret ballot, So far as I<br />
can make out Labour is pledged to repeal the Secret Ballot<br />
legislation. I certainly know that when it was before<br />
Parliament they voted1 to a man, against it. Where do they<br />
stand on these other ' Matters?<br />
I've said something about overseas investment<br />
something about secret ballots, but dhat happens under their<br />
inflationary system of finance? Rising costs, great damage to<br />
the export industries, consequently a considerable loss of<br />
national income consequently a considerable tendency for the<br />
real standard ol living to fall, and, as these things go on, a<br />
considerable building up of unemployment on the large scale.<br />
Not a moderate amount of unemployment, temporary, and in a<br />
volume that will undoubtedly disappear in the course of next<br />
year, not that; but massive unemployment as a result of loose<br />
expansionary finance and rising costs. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Now that is as much as I can say in this time it by<br />
no means covers the ground. But it's your choice and I don't<br />
mind telling you that, not so much for my sake, as an<br />
individual, but for the sake of this country, I hope you will<br />
choose to go on with sound government and sound national<br />
advancement. </p>
