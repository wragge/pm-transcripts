SUPERMARKET TO ASIA COUNCIL<br />
The Prime Minister's Supermarket to Asia Council met today for the second time.<br />
The Council welcomed Mrs Fay Mc~ huigan as its newest member. Mrs McGuigan<br />
is a great achiever in our wine industry and has been instrumental in increasing<br />
Australia's exports. Fay is an excellent addition to the Council.<br />
The clear feeling of the Council is that it should be action focussed rather than<br />
simply holding more reviews.<br />
To this end, the Council agreed to measures to get our goods into the Asian<br />
markets. A number of working groups have been established which will devise action plans<br />
to achieve greater exports. They will identify key problems and the solutions<br />
required. Government and industry can then work together to implement the<br />
necessary reforms,<br />
As Chairman of the Council, I tabled a proposal to make Australian producers<br />
aware of the high value specialist product opportunities that exist in Asia and how<br />
we may benefit from these. The Government is very keen to increase<br />
opportunities for our producers to diversify into new products and new markets<br />
which better meet Asian tastes. This will also broaden regional Australia's<br />
economic base and encourage further growth and employment.<br />
For example, Queensland prawn producers are now diversifying into live Kuruma<br />
prawns specifically for the Japanese market. At $ 80 per kg wholesale, they are the<br />
most expensive prawns in the world. While this diversification is starting to occur,<br />
there is clearly much greater potential.<br />
The Government remains strongly committed to the Supermarket to Asia Council.<br />
It is a forum which will provide significant opportunities for Australia, most<br />
especially regional Australia. It will bring new opportunities, new jobs and new<br />
investment. It is an integral part of our plan to rebuild regional Australia and I<br />
look forward to future successes.<br />
