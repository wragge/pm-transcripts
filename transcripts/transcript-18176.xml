Prime Minister Julia Gillard today opened a $500 million fund to build world class education and training facilities for students in regional Australia.</p>
<p>The special Regional Priorities Round of the Education Investment Fund will provide a major boost to higher education institutions and vocational education and training (VET) providers across regional Australia.</p>
<p>The $500 million fund will ensure regional students have better quality education and training opportunities and this in turn will support increased participation in tertiary education.</p>
<p>This targeted investment will also contribute to economic growth and development in regional Australia by addressing the skills needs of regional communities.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister announced details on the fund during a visit to the University of Ballarat today.</p>
<p>More Australians than ever before are now able to benefit from a university education thanks to the Gillard Labor Government's historic investment in higher education.</p>
<p>More regional students now have access to financial support through Youth Allowance.</p>
<p>The number of regional students accessing Youth Allowance is up from 28,875 to 36,310  -  an increase of 25% in just more than a year.</p>
<p>Campuses have also benefited from an additional $110 million in increased regional loading to help them meet the higher costs of delivering services in regional areas.</p>
<p>The Government has committed more than $6.2 billion in capital funding for infrastructure to modernise Australia's universities.</p>
<p>Under the Regional Priorities Round, a total of $480 million will be allocated to higher education institutions and VET providers in a competitive round, while $20 million has been be earmarked as seed funding for a multi-partner campus on the mid-north coast of New South Wales.</p>
<p>Higher education and VET providers will now be able to apply for the funding to construct new facilities or to refurbish and extend existing facilities.</p>
<p>They will also be able to access funding for technical equipment or information and communication technologies to support teaching and learning.</p>
<p>Funding in the EIF Regional Priorities Round is also available for research-related capital costs integral to proposed teaching and learning or VET infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>So far, 57 capital projects funded through the EIF have been completed and a further 121 projects are underway. </p>
<p>This historic investment in infrastructure has transformed our universities and TAFEs, providing modern, state-of-the-art learning and teaching facilities.</p>
<p>The Regional Priorities Round will involve a two-stage application process. Initial Expressions of Interest close on 4 November 2011. Applicants successful at the Expression of Interest stage will be invited to submit a full application in 2012.</p>
