PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED AT FAIRBAIRN ON DEPARTURE FOR NEW ZEA-AND<br />
THURSDAY 20 MARCH 1980<br />
Question Prime Minister what do you hope to achieve in New Zealand?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
over a long period New. Zealand and Australia have worked to<br />
achieve closer economic relationships trading in particular<br />
through the NAFTA Agreement. Now I think there is a consensus<br />
on both sides but the NAFTA arrangement has probably gone about<br />
as far as it can. It seems to have run its course and if there<br />
is to be some closer retlationship between New Zealand and<br />
Australia a different approach might be required. All-of this<br />
really began when Mr. Talboys came down to Nareen quite some<br />
time ago. But since then ministers have met, officials have<br />
met to try to establish a basis for closer developing economic<br />
and trading relationships. Now Mr. Muldoon and myself will be<br />
reviewing the work that has been undertaken up to this point.<br />
We hope we can agree on directions for further work. There will<br />
be no hard decisions taken tomorrow. But we do hope that we<br />
can agree on the directions for further work that will enable<br />
the general New Zealand/ Australian relationship to be enhanced<br />
and to come closer over the next years.<br />
Question Prime Minister do you intend talking to Mr. Muldoon about the<br />
Olympics question?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The discussions are on the trans Tasman relationship but when we<br />
meet we will talk about a great range of issues no doubt they<br />
will come up.<br />
Question I can see why it's important for a country like New Zealand to<br />
have close relations with us. But what's in it for Australia?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think it is important for Australia to have the closest possible<br />
relationships with New Zealand. The total market for Australian<br />
goods is significantly larger with the New Zealand added to our<br />
own. Over the years the close working partnership between<br />
Australia and New Zealand has been very much to the advantage of<br />
both countries, not just for the smaller country, New Zealand.<br />
Question Prime Minister if I may come back on the Olympics the Swimming<br />
Union, the Athletics Union in the last two days have gone against<br />
your wishes. Does it concern you that there is a trend that way?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Oh and the House of Commons overwhelmingly went our way.<br />
Thank you very much. 000---</p>
