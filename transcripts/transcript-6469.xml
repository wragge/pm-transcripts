/ D a~ t' 1<br />
17 September 1984<br />
The Prime Minister has sent the following message to the<br />
new Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Shimon Peres:<br />
" Dear Shimon,<br />
It is a pleasure to be able to extend to you my best wishes<br />
and those of the Australian Government and the Australian<br />
Labor Party on your appointment as Prime Minister of Israel.<br />
I remember warmly your message to me and my party in 1983<br />
and, in particular, your hope that closer ties between our<br />
peoples and our parties would eventuate.<br />
In congratulating you and the Israel Labour Party on<br />
negotiating and leading a National Unity Government, let me<br />
re-emphasize that hope and our shared hope also for peace<br />
and security for all in the Middle East.<br />
I am confident that your personal contribution, in your new<br />
role, to the resolution of the problems facing Israel and<br />
its region will be of great and lasting value.<br />
I wish you and the National Unity Government well in the<br />
challenging tasks ahead.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
Bob Hawke" JW </p>
