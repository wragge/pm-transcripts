FOR PRESS 26 AUGUST 1977<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO THE NEW SOUTH WALES CHAMBER OF<br />
MANUFACTURES DINNER<br />
Mr. Presidentl Sir John Moore, Gentlemen. I am particularly<br />
glad to have this opportunity to speak with you this evening.<br />
Bob Cotton would very much have liked to have been here, but he<br />
is representing the Government at a South Pacific Forum meeting<br />
in Port Moresby and he has asked me to convey his apologies.<br />
It is just ten days since the Budget was introduced in:<br />
Parliament, and I want to discuss with you its impact on the<br />
manufacturing sector. The Budget continues the policies we have<br />
pursued since coming to office, policies which have led to<br />
inflation being significantly reduced; real economic growth<br />
being restored; the expansion of big Government being halted;<br />
and Government spending being contained. The Budget will further<br />
advance the fight against inflation, because it has reduced the<br />
deficit by half a billion dollars and held Government expenditure<br />
to zero growth in real terms.<br />
It is because we exercised restraint in Government spending we<br />
have been able to introduce a radical change in income tax.<br />
We made our tax reform because we know that if Government takes<br />
too large a share of the nation' s resources, the incentive to<br />
work the basis of a country's prosperity is undermined.<br />
our tax reforms restore the incentive to work harder and more<br />
productively, to earn more and to decide how a greater part of<br />
one's income is spent. Under the new scheme, every taxpayer,<br />
whatever his level of income, will be better off. Ninety percent<br />
of taxpayers will be subject to only one tax rate 32 cents in<br />
the dollar., The first $ 3,750 of income will not be taxed. Any<br />
taxpayer above that, earning up to $ 16,000 will be taxed at a<br />
flat 32 cents in the dollar. If you combine those two steps,<br />
he pays less than 25% o-E his total taxable income in tax.<br />
Surcharges apply above $ 16,000 14 cents in the dollar up to<br />
$ 32,000 and 28 cents for income over $ 32,000.<br />
Our latest tax reforms plus tax indexation will be a cost to<br />
revenue of $ 1,371 million this financial year, and $ 1,857<br />
million in 1978/ 79. These personal tax reforms will benefit<br />
the manufacturing sector, by strengthening demand, easing pressure<br />
for wage increases, and restoring incentive for all staff and<br />
employees. / Manufacturers </p>
<p>Manufacturers have often found it difficult in the past to<br />
attract good skilled tradesmen. High marginal tax rates proved<br />
a disincentive to acquiring skills, to accepting more responsibili<br />
and to working overtime. With the single tax rate of 32% covering<br />
of taxpayers, this disincentive has been removed.<br />
Our combined company and personal tax measures in the first two<br />
full financial years will have saved taxpayers well -over<br />
$ 3,000 million. Anyone who questions the reality of our tax<br />
reforms has not faced up to that figure, over $ 3,000 million.<br />
The tax cuts we have made are exactly what people called for<br />
before the Budget. The Associated Chamber of Manufactures of<br />
Australia called for tax cuts, and so did the Victorian Chamber<br />
of Manufactures. The Bank of New South Wales and the A. N. Z.<br />
called for tax cuts, and a large number of company Chairmen did<br />
the same. Even-Mr. Hawke and Mr. Uren asked for tax cuts before<br />
they thought we could bring them in.<br />
When we look at the extent of tax reforms we have introduced,<br />
I do not believe that anyone can argue that the benefits of<br />
these tax reforms have been reflected in a commensurate degree<br />
of wage restraint.<br />
Tax cuts certainly would have' been impossible under the<br />
-ALP's so-called strategy which implies a deficit of $ 3.5 billion.<br />
A 50% increase over the 2.2 billion we have budgeted for this<br />
year, an increase caused by a large increase in Government<br />
spending. What the ALP's strategy would achieve is higher<br />
interest rates, and higher inflation. It would do nothing<br />
for unemployment. It would not have helped inflation. Even<br />
with the rise in company tax of three and a half percent, the<br />
nett increase from company tax this year will be only 6%.<br />
Noticeably less than the rate of inflation, and noticeably<br />
less than the other main components by which the Government<br />
retains its revenue. The major reason for the low rise in<br />
cbmpany tax receipts is the tax reforms, particularly the<br />
investment allowance and the trading stock adjustment,<br />
introduced in last year's Budget.<br />
M-anufacturing industry is of great significance to the Australian<br />
eccrnomy. rt has played a vital part in Australian economic and<br />
social development, and will continue to do so. Manufacturing<br />
industry accounts for almost a quarter of national production,<br />
and contributes about one-fifth of total exports. It employs<br />
over 20% of the total workforce, one and a quarter million people,<br />
of whom one-third migrated to Australia looking for a better life<br />
and greater security. Manufacturing industry has faced<br />
co.;-. iderable difficulties in the last few years. Manjagement<br />
has faced the challenge of tackling inflationary pressures, a<br />
reduced rate of growth in the domestic market, industrial relations<br />
difficulties, greater industrial development in other countries in<br />
our region, and, above all, an explosion in wage costs. The grave </p>
<p>imbalance between real wages and productivity resulting from<br />
the 1974 wage explosion still remains Australia's major economic<br />
problem. Wages as a cost have continued totincrease relative to<br />
other prices.,<br />
As measured by the vital indicators, the private consumption<br />
deflator, the non-farm GDP deflator, the Consumer Price Index<br />
excluding hospital and medical service, average weekly earnings<br />
outstripped prices last financial year. I know if you take the<br />
CPI unadjusted for Medibank you can arrive at a different result.<br />
But that is a most unsatisfactory method of making a proper<br />
comparison. Medibank had to be paid for either out of<br />
consolidated revenue or by the special levy a change from<br />
one method to the other alters the CPI dramatically but in no<br />
way reflects any change in the underlying rate of inflation.<br />
Another way of seeing how great present wage rises have been<br />
is to compare changes in the Australian average weekly earnings<br />
index with the US average earnings-index. The components of<br />
the two indeces are not the same, but it is relevant to compare<br />
the way the two series have increased. In the three year<br />
period from the end of 1972 to the end of 1975, Australian<br />
average weekly earnings increased about three times the rate<br />
of increase in US average wages 65% compared with 22%.<br />
And. this increase in earnings does not measure the full<br />
cost of labour to employers. In recent years, non wage<br />
costs, such as workers compensation, payroll. tax, and more<br />
generous leave provisions, have increased greatly.<br />
The prospects for manufacturers seemed dismal,<br />
particularly in 1974-75 when manufacturing industry suffered<br />
the triple shock of an increase of over 30% in wage costs, an<br />
inflation rate that reached 19.2% in the last half of 1974,<br />
and the effects of the notor: ious across the board. 25% tariff cut.<br />
All this ercded our International competitiveness, and was reflected<br />
in a loss of export ima. kets and increased penetration of domestic<br />
markets by imports. Emrplo yment in manufacturing has fallen by<br />
170,00 since May 1974. But since the December 1975 election, the<br />
outlook for manufacturing industry has improved.<br />
First, we recognised the acute financial difficulties which the<br />
taxation system ii. posed on business through the effects of<br />
inflation, so graphically described in the Mathews Report.<br />
I have already 0otlinecs. o me of the reforms we have made in this<br />
area. Second, we have taken decisive. action to reduce the rate<br />
of inflation which has caused such damage to manufacturing industry<br />
in Australia, and we have had considerable success. When we came<br />
to office, the ra-e of inflation excluding hospital and medical<br />
services was 16.7%. At the end of June, the inflation rate was<br />
down to 10.2%. We are determined to reduce it further.<br />
We have legislated to bring greater justice, common sense and<br />
consultation to industrial relations. We have established the<br />
Industrial Relations Bureau, and the National Labour Consultative<br />
Council. We have legislated to provide for secret postal ballots<br />
for the election of officers of unions registered under the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and to limit their term of<br />
office to four years. We have amended the Trade Practices Act<br />
to ban damaging secondary boycotts by employees which do not<br />
concern disputes over conditions of. employment. The Royal<br />
Assent has now been given to the Commonwealth Employees ( Employment<br />
Provisions) Act 1977, This enables Commonwealth Government<br />
employing authorities in the public interest to suspend or<br />
dismiss Governent employees who take industrial action which<br />
unreasonably disrupts the provision of services to the Australian<br />
community. It also provides for standing down without pay<br />
Government employees who cannot be usefully employed as a </p>
<p>result of industrial action, or who are engaged on functions,<br />
the performance of which is seriously disrupted. Before this<br />
legislation was passed, the Government's powers were far less<br />
than those of many private employers. This legislation goes a<br />
long way towards redressing the imbalance. Our firm but fair<br />
industrial policy has achieved a significant reduction in the<br />
level of industrial disputes.<br />
This year, we have had by far the lowest level of industrial<br />
disputes this decade. By contrast with the Government's common<br />
sense and desire for consultation, a minority of unions desire<br />
confrontation. I know the public wants the Government to be firm<br />
in these matters. But when some union tries to confront the<br />
community, it is remarkable how readily some people want to<br />
ignore it.<br />
The Government is totally determined that the law will be upheld<br />
in industrial matters. A community cannot operate if the law is<br />
not maintained, and you cannot have a situation where the law<br />
applies everywhere but in industrial relations. The previous<br />
Government was not prepared to uphold the law. After the air<br />
traffic controllers dispute and the postal workers dispute, I<br />
hope that no-one has any doubts about our resolve. Perhaps,<br />
most importantly of all, the Government realises manufacturing<br />
industry's need for -predictability in Government policy.<br />
As we stated in our White Paper on manufacturing industry, a<br />
clearly stated and widely accepted approach policy for industry<br />
is an important factor in generating the confidence for industry<br />
necessary to encourage long term investment. These were not idle<br />
words. We are determined to restore confidence restore the<br />
conditions in which the private investor can face the future<br />
wi-h greater certainty.<br />
There are a number of factors which are helping to provide a<br />
more stable and secure environment for manufacturing industry.<br />
The short teirm and long term policies of the Government have<br />
been clearly stated. In the present period of low economic<br />
activity and high unemployment, levels of protection will not<br />
be reduced where this would endanger employment opportunities,<br />
or jeopardise. the viability of particular sectors of the<br />
manufacturing industry.<br />
have introduced an exchange rate policy which avoids sudden<br />
un. redictable changes. The long run profit share of the national<br />
income is steadily being restored. Rises in costs, for labour<br />
and raw materials, while still of concern, have been brought<br />
under greater control, and increases in real disposable incomes<br />
increase demand for manufactured goods.<br />
Our industrial policy aims at helping, not hindering, business<br />
confidence. To do this, a balance must be achieved between<br />
lonc and short run considerations. In the present economic<br />
circ-. um. stances, the Government is resolved, through its industry<br />
assistance policies, to provide the element of security and<br />
stability industry needs, and thereby maintain activity and<br />
/ Concrete<br />
. rI i </p>
<p>Concrete evidence of the Government's commitment to this objective<br />
is evident in our recent action regarding motor vehicles, textiles<br />
clothing and footwear. In regard to motor vehicles, the Government<br />
has continued the policy it first adopted in 1976 for preserving a<br />
minimum market share for local manufacturers, which is sufficient to<br />
maintain a satisfactory level of activity and employment. We had<br />
hoped that this policy could be implemented without -import<br />
restrictions. But when we found that this was not possible, we<br />
introduced import quotas, andwe shall take further action, if<br />
necessary, to ensure that local industry's share of the market<br />
does not fall below<br />
Last month the IAC published its. draft report on textiles, clothing<br />
and footwear, and a week ago the Ministers for Industry and Commerce<br />
and Business and Consumer Affairs, announced the Government's<br />
approach to these three industries. It must be a matter of concern<br />
to the Government when industry believes that the Industries<br />
Assistance Commission is a body to be feared. Clearly, in a<br />
country which has. a relatively small domestic market, and a high<br />
cost structure, continued assistance to industry is inevitable.<br />
To have a body which advises on the level of that assistance, but<br />
which some believe is dedicated.. to. the destruction of industry,<br />
seems a grievous contradiction.<br />
The Government and the IAC itself, have to ask how this position<br />
has come about. Does it really arise from the IAC's Charter?<br />
Early in the life of this Government, the then Minister for Business<br />
and Consumer Affairs, John Howard, wrote to the IAC, to ensure that<br />
all IAC reports gave due consideration.-to the employment effects of<br />
it's recommendations, including. their effects on employment in<br />
decentralised lccations. and the capacity of the economy to absorb<br />
any changes which the IAC might recommend. The Minister asked that<br />
each IAC report should advise on the assistance required, to maintain<br />
the present level of activity, and employment, in the production of<br />
goods under reference. He also asked that if a lower level of<br />
assistance was recommended, the Commission should give reasons,<br />
why it did not recormexld . th assistance required to maintain the<br />
present level of activity and employment.<br />
But what do we find? In a time of high unemployment, the IAC<br />
submits reports which would create more unemployment. The IAC<br />
draft report on textiles, clothing.-and footwear, produced a totally<br />
unacceptable degree of uncertainty in the three industries involved.<br />
If we had not acted promptly, it would have severely undermined the<br />
confidence. necessary to sustain investment and employment in these<br />
industries. Our consideration of that report, and earlier reports<br />
has led to the Government taking. certain actions. Sufficient<br />
assistance will be given to ensure that there is no-reduction in<br />
the level of activity, or employment, in the textiles, clothing<br />
and footwear industries for the next three years.<br />
During this period, we expect the industries to make positive<br />
efforts to improve their structure and efficiency, and, in<br />
consultation with th. e Minister for Productivity and the appropriate<br />
trade unions, to determine the potential scope for increased<br />
productivity. / We have </p>
<p>-6<br />
We have also asked for a study to be made of the role of the<br />
IAC against the background of present economic problems in<br />
Australia. ' When this study is completed, we will be in a<br />
position to tb. ke whatever further action is necessary to achieve<br />
a more certain decision making climate. In the current economic<br />
circumstances, we hav6 decided not to send to the I. A. C. the five<br />
remaining references on metal products-under the I. A. C.' s tariff<br />
review programme.<br />
We have taken this step because we are well aware that a reference<br />
to the I. A. C. can destroy confidence to invest in the industry<br />
involved. Indeed, under the present circumstances, with the<br />
present reputation of the the long term reference is likely<br />
to kill investment plans in this industry. We have no intention of<br />
allowing that to happen.<br />
A great de al has been spoken in recent times about structural<br />
adjustment. In boom conditions, it is possible to remove resources<br />
from one area to another, by deliberate government policy without<br />
causing undue damage and hardship.<br />
Protection for a particular industry ~ can be reduced without grave<br />
social consequences because employees can readily obtain jobs<br />
elsewhere. But to talk of structural adjustmentina time of economic<br />
difficulty and under-production is sheer nonsense. This is why<br />
in the white paper on manufacturing industry we speak of the<br />
differences between shortn term and long term objectives and policies.<br />
If in today's conditions industries are not given adequate protection<br />
there can only be more unemployment. In order that we may<br />
further define our long term policies for implementation when growth<br />
has been restored to satisfactory levels, the government has decided<br />
to have a study undertaken under the chairmanship of Sir John Crawford.<br />
Of th , e adjustment problems which will eventually be faced, in the<br />
most highly protected Australian industries. It should be clearly<br />
understood that adjustment should not be defined as elimination.<br />
What we~ want is the long -term strength, stability and viability<br />
of Australian manufacturing industry. I'm sure that Sir John is<br />
well aware of how essential a broad based manufacturing industry<br />
is to AustraliA.<br />
Mr President, I know that there are still problems for manufacturing<br />
industry in this country. But. I believe that the government is<br />
establishing the conditions ,, in which it is reasonable to expect a<br />
r-eturn of confidence in industry.<br />
our over-riding goal is to create and maintain a climate in which<br />
new opportunities will exist for business initiatives, new investment,<br />
and high employment. Government has an faportant part to play in<br />
achieving a full economic recovery but the importance of business<br />
itself cannot be underestimated.<br />
what we are now looking for is a positive response from . private<br />
industry. And we are greatly encouraged by recent developments<br />
with the North West Shelf project and a number of new investments<br />
in manufacturing industry which have been announced recently. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Recovery in the economy which we are looking for requires a joint<br />
effort by all of us industry, government, unions. The<br />
government's policies particularly when capped by the tax<br />
reforms and reduced deficit of the budget have set the scene<br />
for renewed real growth.<br />
I am confident that, once again, Australian manufacturing<br />
industry will play its full part in achieving that goal.<br />
