PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP TO<br />
THE FEDERA! Z; ON OF ETHNIC COMM4UNITY COUNCILS<br />
SYDNEY, 12 AUGUST 1992<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
I am very grateful for the opportunity to address so many<br />
distinguished members of the Australian community tonight.<br />
It is something that I have looked forward to since I became<br />
Prime Minister.<br />
I want to particularly thank the Federation of Ethnic<br />
Communities Councils of Australia and the New South Wales<br />
Ethnic Community quncil for organising this occasion, and<br />
Carl Harbaum. and Edna AcGill for their involvement.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Like most Australians I have spent a small part of the last<br />
three weeks watching, listening to, or reading about the<br />
Olympic Games in Barcelona.<br />
Amid all the drama, the thought occurred to me more than<br />
once that what the world achieves every four years Australia<br />
achieves every day which is a quite extraordinary measure<br />
of cultural diversity and tolerance.<br />
If we were inspired by the scenes in Barcelona, perhaps we<br />
can also draw a little inspiration from our achievement<br />
here. The economic troubles we are going through along with the<br />
rest of the world are cause for grave concern.<br />
But we have made social advances in Australia superior to<br />
virtually anywhere else in the rest of the world,-and we.<br />
should take pride in them, value them, preserve them.<br />
The rich, diverse and tolerant society Australia's<br />
multculura policies have produced is among the greatest<br />
of these advances advances which many other countries envy<br />
and admire. 1223 </p>
<p>And you can be sure the Government will preserve and improve<br />
upon that society.<br />
Perhaps the most moving and symbolic moment in Barcelona<br />
occurred at the end of the women's 10,000 metres: when we<br />
saw the embrace between the Ethiopian winner and the South<br />
African who finished second.<br />
This seemed to me more than an advertisement for the<br />
transcending capacity of sport to bring people together.<br />
It was a reminder, in a technocratic era when the icons of<br />
success are predominantly economic, that the greatest<br />
aspiration of humanity and of any society is to live<br />
together in peace.<br />
It is also, then, a reminder of how well we have done this<br />
in Australia.<br />
A reminder that we should, in no small way, measure our<br />
success in these terms.<br />
And, perhaps, count the fact that we live in a society<br />
relatively free of ethnic strife as one of the great<br />
blessings of being an Australian.<br />
Pe ter Robinson made the point very well a couple of weeks<br />
ago In-i7t1cle in the Financial Review.<br />
It was an article against the nihilism which many<br />
Australians, including young Australianis, these days<br />
frequently express.<br />
Comparing Australia to other countries around the world, he<br />
pointed out the rare privileges of living here.<br />
And he stressed the degree to which these privileges depend<br />
on the spirit of the people.<br />
" Nations are not created, evolved or fully represented by<br />
governments", he wrote. They spring from, and grow because<br />
of, their people's sense of community".<br />
On the other side of the world, in an article appearing in<br />
the New York Review of Books, the President of<br />
Czechoslovakia, recently made a remarkably similar point.<br />
In re-building his nation, he said, it will be essential to<br />
develop among the people a sense of confidence and pride, a<br />
feeling of " co-responsibilty for public affairs".<br />
He stressed how much his hopes depended on " what we<br />
understand as the human spirit".<br />
1224 </p>
<p>I might say that increasingly I feel that Australia's future<br />
as a nation depends in large part on these same things.<br />
I have been stressing them not just in talking about the<br />
organisation of government, but in cultural policy, where we<br />
are attempting to put questions of Australia's cultural<br />
development in the mainstream of national development:<br />
in Aboriainal affairs, where we are attempting to make<br />
this the decade of breakthrough so that we might all<br />
feel more pride and confidence as Australians:<br />
in various aspects of socialpol * icy, in industrial<br />
relatipns, in policies for Australian wompn and in<br />
eiducation where we have increased participation rates<br />
and set up aNational Training Authority to provide for<br />
all our young peopleand<br />
not least in economic policy where our efforts are<br />
aimed at a truly national effort involving all<br />
Australians in recovery and growth.<br />
This is the idea of One Nation.<br />
It applies also, of course, to our multicultural policies.<br />
For ethnic communities give much and have much to give, to<br />
our economic, social and cultural goals.<br />
They have always given much of course.<br />
Imigation is the central fact of this country's history<br />
it's how we all got here. All those who arrived in the last<br />
two hundred years at least.<br />
It has been the source of our energy in the frontier eras<br />
of pastoralism and mining, in industrial and postindustrial<br />
Australia. I need not reel off the names of<br />
Australia's most successful entrepreneurs past and present<br />
to make the point to this audience.<br />
Nor need I mention the outstanding professional people, the<br />
writers, artists and performers, the sportsmen and women,<br />
and no less those vast numbers who invested not only their<br />
labour but their life in Australia and gave it life in<br />
doing so.<br />
The waves of post-war immigrants have helped Australia<br />
define itself' helped u -s see -ourselves, raised our selfawareness,<br />
made it easier for us to judge what to build on<br />
and what to change.<br />
In this way they have made Australia much more dynamic. 1225 </p>
<p>4<br />
And of course, each wave of immigrants has invested<br />
Australia with new ambitions, new skills, new energy.<br />
And, of course, new cultures, new ways of living, new ideas.<br />
So Australia has been made stronger, richer in every sense,<br />
more worldly and outward-looking and, because Australians<br />
have trusted to their. faith in the principles of fairness<br />
and democracy, they have also been made more tolerant.<br />
A better country without doubt.<br />
There are some . who say that Australia cannot be strong<br />
because of our cultural diversity.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition is one of them.<br />
Dr Hewson says that our multicultural policies are " the<br />
politics of division."<br />
The innovative and compassionate policies which have<br />
produced a society remarkable among the nations of the world<br />
for both diversity and peace he sees as " absolutely a<br />
fundamental mistake."<br />
All we do", he says, " is elevate a few professional<br />
ethnics." I say he is wrong.<br />
Australia is no less one nation for the diversity of its<br />
heritage, than is a house less stable and strong for the*<br />
diversity of the crafts and materials which go into building<br />
it. The trick is to work from a few sound principles, while<br />
allowing enough flexibility to solve problems and encourage<br />
innovation. Those principles have been given expression in the<br />
multicultural policies of the last decade the ones which<br />
Dr Hewson describes as " absolutely a fundamental mistake"<br />
I said that one of those principles is tolerance. ' In the<br />
last forty years or so Australians have much ' to be satisfied<br />
with in this regard.<br />
The country has been transformed -from an insular and<br />
xenophobic society, to one widely admired in the world for<br />
its openness.<br />
With that openness has come perhaps an unexpected benefit<br />
that is, more confidence and, I think, greater levels<br />
of mature self-esteem.<br />
1226 </p>
<p>We need those things now. We will need them in the coming<br />
years. They are essential components of success.<br />
We will = QZ need some of the more negative perceptions which<br />
can emerge.<br />
I mean the belief, that our identity is derivative; or a<br />
poorly knit patchwork of other identities, or one to be<br />
hidden behind an imperial cloak for fear that we might be<br />
exposed as second rate.<br />
In otherw4ords we will want to obliterate the cultural<br />
cringe . and with it both the servility and the jingoism<br />
which have sometimes characterised our behaviour.<br />
What we want to preserve and enhance is the sense that<br />
Australia represents an opportunity to build something new,<br />
something better.<br />
It is from this that the lasting contributions to our<br />
national life have come: from those who have said this<br />
Australia is my home. This is where my loyalties lie.<br />
So long as those basic principles are there, so long as the<br />
common ambition is there, there will-always be strength in<br />
our diversity.<br />
It seems to me that just now Australia is rather like the<br />
great port cities of old Europe and Asia which got their<br />
material wealth from trade, but their greatness from being<br />
at the cross-roads of cultures from the people and ideas<br />
which flowed about them.<br />
In the challenging and competitive world that we now live in<br />
that we now face Australia, I believe, can draw strength<br />
from the same human sources.<br />
As I said before, tolerance will continue to be one of the<br />
essential principles in this.<br />
I think I should also say that tolerance is a two way<br />
street. It is essential to a multicultural society to welcome<br />
newcomers, accept and learn to enjoy difference.<br />
It is equally essential to respect the traditions of the<br />
Australian nation.<br />
Australia is not a new place or a shallow one. It is one of<br />
the oldest democracies in the world. Its political<br />
institutions are a unique blend of the British, American,<br />
European and home-grown Australian. 4227 </p>
<p>Its traditions derive from hard and unique experience on<br />
this continent and from battles in defence of it, as much<br />
as they do from the varied cultures of the British Isles<br />
or any of the other countries from which Australian settlers<br />
have come.<br />
These traditions deserve and must. receive respect. No<br />
country taking itself seriously would demand less.<br />
I think it is also true that just as the newer cultures of<br />
Australia should enjoy tolerance and support, so should<br />
those who see a threat to the old Australia in the emergence<br />
of the new.<br />
You will know that I believe in change when change is<br />
necessary. You will know that I don't believe any group of<br />
Australians can claim a monopoly on our past or on our<br />
future.<br />
But I also believe in maintaining the best traditions of the<br />
culture from which I came.<br />
The same principles which lead the Government to hold the<br />
enhancement and preservation of social harmony as an<br />
imperative, leads us to build on the old traditions as well<br />
as the new.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
A little earlier I mentioned Australia's cosmopolitan<br />
potential. I said that there is more than trade to any great city or<br />
state. But there is nothing like trade to attract people. Nothing<br />
like trade to give them energy and ideas. And there is<br />
nothing like it to encourage liberty and to transcend<br />
cultural differences.<br />
Trade or let us say a healthy vibrant economy is the<br />
surest guarantee of general prosperity, of healthy social<br />
democracy, = nd of our multicultural society continulaig to<br />
flourish. Just as it creates common ground between nations, it creates<br />
common ground within them.<br />
So when I say that our attention to the social and cultural.<br />
concerns of Australiat are central ones, I do not for a<br />
moment cease to regard the economy as the framework on which<br />
all our hopes ultimately hang..<br />
1228 </p>
<p>My point has been that it is pointless and self-defeating to<br />
separate our social ambitions from our economic ones.<br />
And nowhere is this more clear, surely, than here in this<br />
audience. Because, as I have said, it is people like yourselves and<br />
those you represent who have done much to drive the economy.<br />
And I believe it is becoming increasingly apparent that our<br />
diverse and open society may well yield us economic benefits<br />
we really did not expect.<br />
The langu. ae skills of multicultural Australia, the personal<br />
knowledge of other countries and their markets, the<br />
international networks which so many Australians maintain,<br />
all offer unique trading advantages.<br />
There is quite clear evidence, for example, that the small<br />
businesses of Asian Australians havebeen succeeding to an<br />
unparalleled degree during the last few years, including the<br />
recession. One reason is their ability to operate effectively in Asian<br />
markets. Given that we have the same facilities of language and local<br />
knowledge, there seems to be no reason why we cannot enjoy<br />
more success in Middle Eastern and European especially<br />
Central European markets.<br />
The Government will be seeking to encourage these<br />
advantages. They will be the focus of a special conference the Office of<br />
Multicultural Affairs in my department will be co-sponsoring<br />
in October this year.<br />
In talking about the real and potential commercial<br />
advantages which the ethnic communities have conferred on<br />
Australia, you can be sure that the Government has not<br />
forgotten its particular responsibilities to those<br />
communities. I mean we must work to see that there are genuinely equal<br />
opportunities for new and better jobs when they are<br />
displaced by restructuring; that there is adequate English<br />
language training as well as vocational training.<br />
There is more than fairness involved in the discharge of<br />
these responsibilities: there is the recognition of the need<br />
to encourage talent and ambition and energy in the process<br />
of restructuring. 1229 </p>
<p>F 8<br />
Migrant groups have been at the forefront of every major<br />
industrial step we have taken in Australia.<br />
Just as they were in the vanguard of the industrial readjustment<br />
after the war and the sustained surge which<br />
followed, so they will play a leading role in the restructured<br />
economy of the nineties and beyond.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Perhaps some of the things I have said tonight could be<br />
interpreted as overly optimistic or complacent.<br />
I do not mean to be. I do believe that there is much to be<br />
proud of.<br />
But there is also much to do.<br />
The government is aware that the need to manage our diverse<br />
society is not one which appreciably fades with time.<br />
We need to go on taking those steps necessary to keep the<br />
barriers down the difference flourishing but the barriers<br />
between Australians down.<br />
There are times when this is acutely necessary when, for<br />
instance, overseas wars impact directly on Australian ethnic<br />
groups. I take this opportunity to congratulate those communities<br />
who have so ably done this over the years; most notably in<br />
recent times during the Gulf War, and the tragedy now<br />
occurring in Yugoslavia.<br />
The Government acknowledges with gratitude and admiration<br />
the restraint that has been shown.<br />
There will always be times when specific communities are<br />
under particular stress. The government will listen and do<br />
what it can.<br />
The more usual but no less necessary task is to listen on a<br />
regular basis through formal consultations, like those<br />
conducted by the Minister for Immigration and E * thnic<br />
Affairs, Gerry Hand, and through channels like'-the Office of<br />
Multicultural Affairs.<br />
I say " listening" I mean " including".<br />
I say " ethnic communities" I mean all Australians.<br />
I mean what we do is part of this Labor Government's<br />
commitment it's historic commitment to social<br />
improvement, to social justice.<br />
1230 </p>
<p>Access and equity policies are an essential part of this.<br />
They ensure equitable access to government programs and<br />
services for all Australians regardless of their background.<br />
Those who argue that multiculturalism divides the community<br />
should consider the~ alternatives.<br />
Providing programs which some Australians could not use at<br />
all because of language or cultural barriers; or of<br />
providing one set of programs for the majority community and<br />
another for those whose backgrounds are not English speaking<br />
these are divisive, these would create two classes of<br />
Australians.-' The multicultural policies of the Government are intent upon<br />
not creating ghettos strife, or special treatment, or<br />
" professional ethnics".<br />
They are intent on managing diversity for the good of every<br />
individual and for the good of the country.<br />
It is for these reasons that we have, for example, sought to<br />
remove the barriers to participation in the media and the<br />
arts through that uniquely Australian institution, the SBS<br />
and more recently through traineeships designed to ensure<br />
that young Australians of non-English speaking backgrounds<br />
have a chance in the media.<br />
We don't do these things to support particular cultures for<br />
their own sake.<br />
We do it to keep the barriers down.<br />
As I said, we take the view that these policies are an<br />
extension of our democratic traditions.<br />
They require good faith on all sides.<br />
For our part we stick to the principle that all Australians<br />
have the right to express and enjoy their cultural identity<br />
as they choose, provided they do not infringe the rights of<br />
any other Australians.<br />
It's as true for a recent arrival from Vietnam as it is for<br />
an Austral-Celt from Bankstown with half a dozen generations<br />
born here.<br />
We expect all Australians to observe these rights and<br />
liberties. Australian governments have also included in their<br />
responsibilities, the provision of the basics for survival. 1231 </p>
<p>Since the days of Arthur Caiwell the Australian immigration<br />
policy has taken a share of the responsibility for<br />
settlement after immnigration.<br />
Today's government continues that tradition and, indeed,<br />
through access and equity policies, extends it.<br />
Our continuing success depends on that unspoken partnership<br />
between Government and the community.<br />
In this context I pay tribute to the work done by FECCA and<br />
its many affiliates.<br />
It has been an immensely useful task a crucial task to<br />
bring together Australians from so many backgrounds, and to<br />
foster among them a sense of belonging to this country.<br />
So it is with pride, not complacency, that I address you<br />
tonight.<br />
Australia's immigration policy and its multicultural<br />
policies have been one of the great undertakings of our<br />
history, one of the great achievements.<br />
Also, one of the great risks.<br />
It involved trust in our people and our traditions to manage<br />
the sort of diversity which in so many other countries has<br />
led to tragedy.<br />
Just in recent times look at Los Angeles, Bradford,<br />
Saraj evo, Boipatong.<br />
We have managed it. We are determined that we will continue<br />
to manage it.<br />
The pride comes not merely from the sense that we, the<br />
Australian Government, has done well, or we the old Anglo<br />
and Celtic Australians.<br />
It comes in large part from seeing how well the peoples of<br />
the world have done in Australia.<br />
In that, as an Australian, I take great pleasure and pride.<br />
The achievement of Australian governments, and ministers<br />
like Gerry Hand, has been to match in imagination, ambition<br />
and courage, the imagination, ambition and courage of the<br />
people who have left their homes to come here.<br />
They are the qualities we need now. Indeed they are the<br />
qualities a nation always needs.<br />
Tonight I am grateful for the opportunity to meet you, to<br />
express my thoughts and feelings, and to pay tribute.<br />
1232 </p>
<p>It is a very appropriate time. All those great moments at<br />
the Olympics could not disguise the fact of world events.<br />
Events which make clear that working and living with<br />
cultural difference is one of the great global challenges of<br />
our time.<br />
I do not believe it is overstating the case to say, then,<br />
that--in Australia we have some lessons for the world.<br />
Thank you. A' 1233 </p>
