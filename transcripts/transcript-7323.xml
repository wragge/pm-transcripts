PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 19 MAY-1988<br />
The Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and<br />
Trade, Dr Stuart Harris, has informed Mr Hayden and Mr Duffy<br />
that he intends in the near future to take up a senior<br />
academic position at the Australian National University.<br />
The Government and particularly Mr Hayden and I<br />
appreciates the service Dr Harris has provided as head of<br />
one of the central policy departments of Government.<br />
He has made an important personal contribution as Secretary<br />
in helping define the nature and extent of Australia's<br />
international interests and in Improving the Government's<br />
pursuit of those interests. Under Mr Hayden" s direction, he<br />
has also led the Department in achieving the amalgamation of<br />
the former Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the<br />
Australian Overseas Information Service. The Government's<br />
objective of a more integrated and better focussed approach<br />
towards our international interests is already being<br />
acheived as a result.<br />
Among Dr Harris' achievements was the completion in 1986 of<br />
a fundamental Review of Australia's Overseas Representation.<br />
His careful analysis of Australia's interests in the<br />
changing internatidinal environment and the optimum<br />
deployment of Government resources to service those<br />
interests has been of great value.<br />
Dr Harris has indicated that he wishes to relinquish the<br />
Secretaryship of Foreign Affairs and Trade at the end of the<br />
first week in July. The Government has asked him to report<br />
further on Auttralia's overseas representation between then<br />
and September-N This report will update the conclusions and<br />
recommendations of the earlier review in the light of<br />
developments since its completion and, in particular, since<br />
the amalgamation of the Department of Foreign Affairs and<br />
Trade. The report will also, in the light of these and any<br />
other factors, report on the case for a single overseas<br />
service.<br />
The Government wishes Dr Harris well in his future academic<br />
career. An announcement about his successor will be made<br />
after the matter has been fully considered by the<br />
Government. 0 0 G 5 9 </p>
