<p>Students of all ages will be encouraged to nominate their favourite teacher of all time and post an online message of support as part of a new program to highlight the important role that teachers play.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister will today launch a six-week competition for people to tell the story of their favourite teacher during a roundtable with student teachers and Minister for School Education Peter Garrett at the University of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister will kick off the campaign with a video in which she talks about her favourite teacher and the importance of education.</p>
<p>The aim of the new campaign is to generate a conversation on social media about the inspirational role that high quality teachers play in students' lives.</p>
<p>Pupils, past and present, will be invited to post a message, photo or a video about their favourite teacher on the Prime Minister's Facebook page.</p>
<p>The competition will be run online across a range of social media channels with the Prime Minister and other ministers.</p>
<p>A range of social media platforms will be used, including:</p>
<p>â¢             People posting their entry on the Prime Minister's Facebook page;</p>
<p>â¢             A video of the impact of education on the Prime Minister's life and how it has shaped the Prime Minister's views on education;</p>
<p>â¢             A Facebook Q&amp;A session on education; and</p>
<p>â¢             A live blog about education.</p>
