ADDRESS TO PRIME MINISTER'S LUNCHEON<br />
NEWCASTLE CITY HALL 12 APRIL 1984<br />
I am very pleased to he with you today on this; my first<br />
visit to Newcastle as Prime Minister.<br />
I'm especially pleased because I understand this is the<br />
first visit to your city by any Prime Mini: 3ter for nearly<br />
years. But let me assure you you won't have to wait another<br />
years. When Paul Keating was here recently he was the thirteenth<br />
Minister to visit Newcastle since the election.<br />
I'm the fourteenth.<br />
Lionel Bowen, the Deputy Prime Minister, a: rives here<br />
tomorrow making it 1.5 Ministers.<br />
Over half the Federal Ministry has visited Newcastle in<br />
li'Ctle over a year.<br />
That's more Ministers t-han came here during the entire seven<br />
years of the previous Government seven years when<br />
Newcastle was all but forgotten.<br />
Of course, such neglect from the previous Government was<br />
for it perfectly normal.<br />
Even so, it did constitute a blindness to the role of<br />
Newcastle and this region in Australia that was<br />
extraordinary even by its standards.<br />
You can't ignore a region of nearly 500,0001 people with<br />
Australia's sixth largest city.<br />
You can't ignore a critical centre of Australia's heavy<br />
industry.<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY </p>
<p>You can't ignore a city which apart from West Australia's<br />
iron ore ports, Dampier and Port Hedland is Australia's<br />
number one export port.<br />
And we won't ignore you.<br />
The Federal Labor Government is giving Newcastle a new deal.<br />
That's clear from the initiatives we've already taken for<br />
Newcastle over the past year, initiatives such as:<br />
the decision to establish a regional taxation office in<br />
Newcastle which will ultimately employ over 700 people;<br />
the new Federal office block we will begin building<br />
later this year at a cost of $ 10 million; ' 4<br />
the new $ 180 million highway development strategy for<br />
the Hunter region which will provide a complete bypass<br />
west of Newcastle and Maitland for national traffic by<br />
1990;<br />
the appointment for the first time of a permanent family<br />
court judge for the Newcastle 7egion; and<br />
the establishment of a regional office of the Department<br />
of Trade in Newcastle which Lionel Bowen will open<br />
tomorrow.<br />
Vie recognise Newcastle for what it is one of Australia's<br />
key industrial centres.<br />
The decisions we've taken will help upgrade the status of<br />
Newcastle and broaden your infrastructure and industries.<br />
Our initiatives also offer a challenge to other<br />
organisations with a stake in Newcastle to follow our lead<br />
to upgrade and expand their representation here and to allow<br />
more local decision making.<br />
I urge the private sector to consider the implications of<br />
the Federal Government's commitment to this region and to<br />
take advantage of the opportunities that are opening up.<br />
And those opportunities are all the brighter because of the<br />
dramatically improved outlook for the Australian steel<br />
industry. The last time I was i~ n Newcastle was in October 1982 to<br />
address that huge public meeting held in this City Hall to<br />
consider the crisis in the steel industry.<br />
At that time you were facing the appalling prospect of the<br />
steel industry disappearing altogether from Australia and,<br />
with that, the effective destruction of Ne3wcastle as a<br />
community. </p>
<p>You'll recall that at that public meeting, called at a time<br />
of absolute crisis, the previous Governmen't didn't even<br />
bother to send a representative.<br />
That's something the people of Newcastle should never<br />
forget.<br />
But fortunately that Government has passed away.<br />
Labor was elected and we moved as quickly as we could to<br />
rescue the steel industry.<br />
The result was our historic Steel Industry Plan.<br />
Through the Steel Plan we saved the steel industry.<br />
And in saving the steel industry we saved Newcastle.<br />
The Steel Industry Plan is a breakthrough for Australia.<br />
It's the first serious case in our history of cooperative<br />
industrial reconstruction.<br />
The Steel Plan is in effect a contract, a contract between<br />
the Federal Government, BHP and the unions.<br />
The three parties have each given vital commitments.<br />
By collectively observing those commitments, the parties<br />
have ensured that A6stralia retains a viable, efficient<br />
steel industry.<br />
The Federal Government's commitments are for a steel bounty<br />
of up to $ 72 million a year.<br />
The unions' commitments relate to wages, productivity and<br />
observing grievance settlement procedures.<br />
BHP's commitments are for job security, new investment and<br />
the continued operation of three separate steel centres.<br />
The Steel Plan is an integrated package.<br />
Failure by any of the parties to ob3erve their undertakings<br />
means the whole Plan falls apart.<br />
The new Steel Industry Authority is charged with monitoring<br />
the situation to ensure that all the parties honour their<br />
obligations. The Steel Plan is working well.<br />
Bounty payments in the first half of this year are expected<br />
to be significantly below the maximum provided for,<br />
reflecting the improvement in output by the steel industry. </p>
<p>The Plan is certainly helping to improve the industry's<br />
productivity. There is a sense of commitment by all the parties to make<br />
the Plan work.<br />
Because of the devastation suffered by Newcastle and the<br />
other steel centres the Government has also introduced a<br />
package of employment and training initiatives for these<br />
r eg io ns<br />
In particular, we have set aside more than $ 100 million for<br />
projects in the steel regions to improve the economic<br />
infrastructure and provide new job opportunities.<br />
We have already approved projects valued at. $ 23 million for<br />
the Hunter region together with an additional $ 10 million<br />
for tourism developments.<br />
We have also extended the labour adjustment. training<br />
arrangements to cover not only waorkers retrenched in the<br />
steel industry but also workers retrenched from firms<br />
supplying goods or services to the steel industry and those<br />
retrenched in the coal industry in NSW.<br />
The labour adjustment training arrangements aim to upgrade<br />
workers' skills and so make it easier to get a job.<br />
We have provided'over B00 training places in the Hunter<br />
region under these arrangements.<br />
The Government is also providing job opportunities in<br />
Newcastle through our new Community Employment Program.<br />
We have already approved over $ B million for CEP projects in<br />
the Hunter region. These will create more than 800 jobs.<br />
Like the steel industry, the coal industry has been<br />
experiencing extremely severe difficulties.<br />
Overseas contracts are, of course, crucial to the coal<br />
industry's long term prospects.<br />
In my visit earlier this year to Japan, South Korea, China<br />
and Malaysia, I stressed Australia's increased reliability<br />
as a supplier and our improved industrial relations record.<br />
This was seen as being crucially important to reversing the<br />
deterioration that has occurred in Australia's position as a<br />
supplier of steel-making raw materials in recent years.<br />
The steel industry crisis in Australia was exacerbated by<br />
the dramatic downturn in our economy. </p>
<p>This led all those industries which use steel to savagely<br />
cut back their demand for steel with appalling<br />
consequences for steel centres like Newcastle.<br />
Newcastle has a vital interest in the national economic<br />
recovery for all the obvious reasons but also because<br />
expansion in Newcastle's steel industry depends more than<br />
anything else on-rising economic activity and growing.<br />
demand. Novi the simple fact is this: the economic recovery in<br />
Australia is well and truly underway.<br />
Those remaining doubzCing Thomases on this score were<br />
strangely mute late last month when the Bureau of Statistics<br />
released its most recent national accounts figures. V<br />
These showed that the non-farm economy, after contracting in<br />
the first half of last year, rebounded very strongly by an<br />
estimated 5.6 per cent through the second half of last<br />
ye ar<br />
In other words, the economic recovery is underway.<br />
Our official advisers expect that growth in the non-farm<br />
economy through this financial year will be as high as B per<br />
cent. This is the strongest growth for mare than a decade.<br />
The challenge is no longer to reverse the slide into<br />
recession. We have done that.<br />
T~ ie challenge now is to maintain the momentum of the<br />
recovery that is already underway.<br />
This will not be easy.<br />
In particular, it will require creating a sustained recovery<br />
in private sector investment.<br />
Private investment is normally the last component of demand<br />
to pick up in an economic recovery.<br />
There are two requirements as important as any in creating a<br />
recovery in investment.<br />
These are: a balanced fiscal policy and a successful wages<br />
po i cy<br />
The Federal Government has both. </p>
<p>In the case of fiscal policy, last year's Budget is now<br />
generally recognised as an outstanding success.<br />
It provided a substantial stimulus to the Australian economy<br />
but a stimulus that was not excessive given the depth of the<br />
recession that Australia was experiencing.<br />
It struck the right balance.<br />
Furthermore the Budget is on target.<br />
Government spending is expected to exceed the Budget<br />
estimates by less than one half per cent while aggregate<br />
receipts will be very close to the Budget forecasts.<br />
The Government has already begun considering this year's<br />
Budget. 4<br />
We are starting from the basic premise that the economic<br />
circumstances facing Australia now are very different from<br />
what they were 12 months ago.<br />
When we were drawing up last year's Budget Australia was in<br />
the depths of the recession. A substantial economic<br />
stimulus from the Budget was obviously required.<br />
However, the economy is now growing strongly and the private<br />
sector's demand for funds is picking up.<br />
In these circumstances, the Government believes the only<br />
responsible course is to wind back the degree of stimulus<br />
from the government sector and to reduce the financing<br />
demands the public sector is placing on private capital<br />
markets. Failure to do so would risk upward pressure on interest<br />
rates something that can only harm the prospects for long<br />
term recovery.<br />
Accordingly the Government will reduce significantly the<br />
size of the deficit in the coming Budget.<br />
But the extent of the deficit reduction will not be so large<br />
as to pull the rug from under domestic demand and so<br />
undermine the recovery.<br />
There will be no draconian deficit reduction.<br />
As we did last year, we will strike the right balance.<br />
And in doing so we hope to encompass in the Budget<br />
significant cuts in personal income taxation tax cuts that<br />
the community at large expects from us and tax cuts that<br />
will provide a firm underpinning for continued wage<br />
restraint. </p>
<p>The Government's Fiscal policy is .1ound, it is responsible,<br />
it is balanced.<br />
And therefore it is a total contraSt to t-ie fiscal policy of<br />
the previous Government.<br />
Our predecessors had the dubious distinction of blowing out<br />
the deficit in their last Budget by over $ 2 1/ 2 billion an~<br />
all-time record.<br />
They also left us with a projected Budget deficit for<br />
1983-84 of $ 9.6 billion, a veritabl~ e fiscal crisis and a<br />
crisis about which they deliberately deceived the Australian<br />
people during the election campaign.<br />
But fortunately and I say this particularly to the<br />
business community those days of fiscal mismanagement are<br />
ov er<br />
The failure of the previous Government's fiscal policy was<br />
bad enough.<br />
But that failure was matched by the failure of their wages<br />
policy and I use the term ' wages policy' advisedly.<br />
The previous Government's wages policy, such as it was, was<br />
simply a recipe for a wages explosion.<br />
That's exactly what Australia had.<br />
And the tragedy of that wages explosion was that it<br />
contributed very greatly to the severity of the recession.<br />
For a long term economic recovery Australia needs above all<br />
a wages policy that is coherent, that is equitable, that is<br />
workable. That, I submit, is precisely what the Federal Government has<br />
put in place for Australia a wages policy, centred around<br />
the Prices and Incomes Accord, that will provide a firm<br />
basis for long term wage stability.<br />
The next National Waqe Case decision is expected to be<br />
handed down in late Sepotember or October. It will be based<br />
on the Consumer Price Index rises for the March and June<br />
quarters of this year.<br />
However, the combined CPI rise in these quarters will be<br />
drastically reduced by the impact of Medicare.<br />
In fact Medicare is expected to cut the CPI by about 2 3/ 4<br />
percentage points.<br />
This means the next National Wage Case rise will be<br />
extremely low about I to 2 per cent. </p>
<p>The ACTU has made it clear at the Economic Summit Conference<br />
and on a number of occasions since that they will not seek<br />
compensation for Medicare induced reductions in the CPI.<br />
That is appropriate and responsible.<br />
The Federal Government will totally oppose any claims by<br />
individual unions for compensation for the impact of<br />
Medicare on the CPI.<br />
We are determined that the Medicare-induced CPI reduction<br />
will be transmitted fully into a slowing of wages growth.<br />
The National Wage Case decision after the one later this<br />
year is not expected until March or April of next year.<br />
What this means is that business can look ahead for almost a'<br />
year knowing that wage rises will be mininal.<br />
The next year will see very considerable wage restraint.<br />
This will be a very helpful breathing space for business.<br />
It will help profits to recover further, 4 ' t will help new<br />
investment plans to be followed through and it will help the<br />
creation of new jobs.<br />
The Government believes the coming period of wage restraint<br />
will give Australia a firm base for continuing to build on<br />
the unemployment reductions we have already achieved.<br />
Australia's economic recovery is now underway.<br />
The Government's highest priority is to maintain and broaden<br />
the momentum of that recovery.<br />
We have made a welcome start but there is a very long way to<br />
go. All sections of the community must play their part.<br />
All sections of the Qommunity must exercise restraint.<br />
All sections of the community must co-operate with the<br />
national government.<br />
Provided that co-operation is forthcoming I believe<br />
Australia can look to a brighter future than we've seen for<br />
y ea rs<br />
These are difficult times.<br />
We cannot ignore the deep-seated problems we still face. </p>
<p>9.<br />
But equally we cannot ignore the fact that at long last we<br />
are climbing out of the recession and creating the basis for<br />
a long term economic recovery.<br />
With the support of all of you, that long term recovery,<br />
that return to prosperity is precisely what we will achieve.<br />
And Newcastle will both play a significant role in, and<br />
benefit from, that recovery. </p>
