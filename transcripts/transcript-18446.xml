Prime Minister Julia Gillard will today announce that the Government intends to open a Consulate-General in Chengdu, the capital of China's Sichuan Province.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as Australia and the People's Republic of China celebrate this year their 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>Australia has had a diplomatic presence in China for almost 40 years. Our Embassy in Beijing was established in 1973 and our Consulates-General in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong in 1984, 1992 and 1986 respectively.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said broadening Australia's diplomatic presence in China was a priority for the Government as the Asian Century unfolded.  The new mission is a down-payment on the Australia in the Asian Century White Paper.</p>
<p>Today's announcement comes after careful Government consideration of an expanded diplomatic presence in Western China, led by the former Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd. </p>
<p>The new Consulate-General will increase our diplomatic footprint and will help build on our ever-growing relationship with China.</p>
<p>The creation of the new post will also help identify and build on these opportunities for Australian businesses.</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs Minister Bob Carr said the Consulate-General in Chengdu will provide a direct link to a diverse province which is home to over 80 million people.</p>
<p>Chengdu is a major gateway to the vibrant inland regions, which account for a growing share of China's trade, foreign investment and economic growth.</p>
<p>Cities like Chengdu will be central to the innovative, high-skill, high-tech, higher-income growth which will drive the next stage of China's remarkable economic transformation.</p>
<p>Minister for Trade and Competitiveness Craig Emerson, who last year visited Chengdu while leading a 100-strong business delegation through China's inland growth centres, said the move would help strengthen and expand trade partnerships.</p>
<p>China is already Australia's largest two-way trade partner, with total trade valued at over $113 billion in 2010-11. </p>
<p>Many Australian companies, including Bluescope Steel, Rheem, ANZ and Cochlear, are already active in western China. </p>
<p>Dr Emerson said a dedicated Consulate-General in this rapidly growing region would help develop demand for the sophisticated goods and services which Australia was well placed to provide. </p>
<p>Funding for the new Consulate-General will be provided for in the forthcoming budget.  The Consulate-General will be operational as soon as possible following completion of formal establishment processes with China. </p>
