    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, we know you're on a very tight schedule and we</p>
<p> appreciate your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I've had an opportunity of seeing the extent of the devastation.</p>
<p> It is a miracle that nobody lost their life or was seriously injured.</p>
<p> And the spirit the people are displaying is typical of the way Australians</p>
<p> respond in difficult situations. The Premier and I have announced</p>
<p> today a special trust fund of $10 million to which each government</p>
<p> is contributing half, over and above the normal arrangements that</p>
<p> operate in natural disaster situations. Furthermore, the Federal Government</p>
<p> is going to give, on an ex-gratia basis, $1000 per adult in a household</p>
<p> that's been either, had its home destroyed or severely damaged,</p>
<p> and $200 for each child. Now, these announcements are in addition</p>
<p> to the normal arrangements that apply and we'll continue to monitor</p>
<p> and assess the situation. I'm filled with admiration for the</p>
<p> work of the special State emergency services and the police and the</p>
<p> defence forces that have been flying people in and out and bringing</p>
<p> in fresh water and bringing in power generators. So they all really</p>
<p> worked together quite magnificently.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Now, it's a bit hard to estimate what the final damage bill will</p>
<p> be, Prime Minister, but some people are talking in terms of $50 million.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You can't estimate it at this stage. I just don't know and</p>
<p> it will be some weeks before we know. And, of course, many of the</p>
<p> losses will be covered by private insurance. And I've urged the</p>
<p> insurance companies to be generous and I also expect, and the Federal</p>
<p> Government expects, the banks to be reasonable and fair and accommodating</p>
<p> particularly to small businesses who've lost their capacity to</p>
<p> operate and lost their cashflow and, therefore, their capacity to</p>
<p> service loans.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>No guarantee they will be so forthcoming though, is there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think there is a community expectation and I'm not suggesting</p>
<p> they won't be but I want to make it very clear that the Government</p>
<p> expects them to be.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>All right. Now, is it time that we started thinking about a natural</p>
<p> disasters fund so that in actual fact we had a pool of money for when</p>
<p> these dreadful natural disasters take place?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we do. We have one now. We have a standing arrangement which</p>
<p> comes into operation immediately. And adding something called a natural</p>
<p> disaster fund wouldn't make anything any easier or any better.</p>
<p> In fact, the present arrangements, because they are in a sense ad</p>
<p> hoc, they're better because you can adjust them according to</p>
<p> the circumstances of each situation.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>We've had some people suggesting that maybe we should have natural</p>
<p> disaster lotteries from time to time to build up a bank, if you like,</p>
<p> so that this money can be distributed when it's needed.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, the real test is whether when something happens, is the</p>
<p> necessary assistance and help available. Now, clearly in this case</p>
<p> there's been an immediate response from both governments and</p>
<p> that will continue to be the attitude of the Federal Government. And</p>
<p> I know the State government joins these situations. So the important</p>
<p> thing is is whether present arrangements work and present arrangements</p>
<p> do work because they're flexible and they're instantaneous.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>All right, just getting on to another topic quickly before we let</p>
<p> you go Â Kosovo. You've now backed the NATO air strikes</p>
<p> that began this morning. Is that unreserved support, Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, of course it's unreserved support for what they're</p>
<p> doing because they've tried very hard to persuade Milosevic to</p>
<p> adopt a more reasonable stance and I don't think the NATO countries</p>
<p> had any alternative. There aren't any Australian forces involved</p>
<p> or likely, for that matter, to be involved, indeed, they won't</p>
<p> be because it's a NATO operation. But there is no alternative</p>
<p> and history has taught us that if you don't behave in these circumstances</p>
<p> in the way NATO has behaved you pay a fairly heavy price later on.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>If there was ever a request made would you be prepared to deploy Australian</p>
<p> troops?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, there has been no request made. There is not likely to be a</p>
<p> request made and, therefore, that is a completely hypothetical question.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>All right. And just finally, the preamble is continuing to draw comment</p>
<p> today, Prime Minister. Now we see your colleague, Jeff Kennett, questioning</p>
<p> the need for the preamble saying it could divert attention away from</p>
<p> the republic issue.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I haven't seen Mr Kennett's comments. I've been</p>
<p> travelling about Exmouth and responding to the difficulties of people</p>
<p> here is far more important to me today than the preamble, important</p>
<p> though that may be.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Indeed it is but when your fellow Liberal colleagues start to criticise</p>
<p> it, doesn't it cause you some concern?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, I'm not really focussing on that issue today.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Okay. You are prepared to make some minor changes to the preamble,</p>
<p> though, we understand.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm about to get on a helicopter. I'll see you later.</p>
<p>BARTLETT:</p>
<p>Thank you, Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Bye bye.</p>
<p>[ends]</p>
