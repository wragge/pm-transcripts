I am pleased to announce a package of assistance to the General Sir John Monash Foundation to establish a new programme of postgraduate scholarships.<br />
The General Sir John Monash Awards will become Australia';s most prestigious awards for postgraduate study, promoting scholarship at the highest level.<br />
The Federal Government will provide $5 million to fund the scholarships for the first three years.  The Commonwealth will also consider matching contributions up to a certain level from private and community sources to the endowment fund.  Donations to the Foundation will be tax deductible.<br />
This level of assistance from the Government will allow time for the General Sir John Monash Foundation to reach a position where it can become self-supporting.<br />
The Commonwealth will also continue to provide administrative funding and support to the Foundation in 2002-03 to help establish the Awards programme.<br />
The Awards honour one of Australia';s greatest sons.  General Sir John Monash distinguished himself as a brilliant general during World War I and through his many achievements in civilian life.<br />
Under the programme up to 16 new awards will be available each year from 2004 for outstanding Australian postgraduate students to study overseas and for international students to study in Australia.</p>
