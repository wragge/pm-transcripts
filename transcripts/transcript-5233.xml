PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT MONDAY, 14 JANUARY 1980<br />
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, MELBOURNE, ON OLYMPIC GAMES<br />
Question ( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
For a long while, the Australian Government tried to<br />
maintain the view that politics and sport should be kept<br />
quite separate and then everyone told us that you could not<br />
keep the two separate, and this was especially in relation<br />
to aparthied in South Africa. Governments that introduced<br />
politics into sport have really been responsible for bringing<br />
the two together. I think it is probably quite unreal for<br />
anyone today to pretend that there are not significant<br />
political implications in great sporting events, and it is<br />
unfortunate that that does apply to the Olympic Gamnes just<br />
as much as to other things.<br />
The suggestions that have been made that the Olympics should<br />
find a permanent home in Greece, I believe are well worth<br />
consideration. It would certainly prevent,. I think, politicisation<br />
of the Olympics which is likely to happen if the nature of<br />
the Olympics is not altered. Another option for the future<br />
of the Games that instead of having a massive effort for the<br />
Gamnes to be mounted in one country, may be to have them mounted<br />
in five or six countries which would enable a much larger<br />
number of countries to participate in presenting the Gamnes<br />
than at the moment, because of the massive cost involved.<br />
