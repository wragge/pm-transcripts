FOR PRESS 10 February 1976<br />
ADDRESS AT A PRIVATE LUNCH FOR DR WALDHEIM<br />
I would like to welcome Mr Waldheim to Australia. It is<br />
years since Australia has been honoured by a visit from the<br />
Secretary-General and I hope that it will not be another<br />
years until the Secretary-General, present incumbent or his<br />
successor I do not know how long his ambitions go into the<br />
future comes here again.<br />
The Secretary-General's job is obviously a very difficult one.<br />
It requires many skills and it, requires a broad philosophy.<br />
He has to be able to get on with people with. many different<br />
ideologies and attitudes and with many different approaches to<br />
the-solution of problems around the world. The Secretary-<br />
General has filled the post with great distinction in difficult<br />
times. He has emphasised the need for governments to resolve<br />
conflicts by discussion and that is something that we would<br />
certainly all applaud. It is unfortunate that only too often,<br />
governments seem to find other ways of attempting to resolve<br />
conflicts. The United Nations has a very real role in-showing<br />
that there is an alternative way. It involves countries in<br />
the world great or small, in substantially fundamental changes<br />
in attitudes. This involves something that cannot be<br />
accomplished in five years. It takes long periods.<br />
The world and the United Nations are going through a difficult<br />
period and the United Nations is often hampered by great power<br />
conflicts. Obviously if the interests of the great powers of<br />

the Soviet Union and the United States are involved, or other<br />
major poweis, the capacity of the United Nations to act is<br />
limited. However, some still bell3ve that power is the only<br />
way to resolve problems between nations. The fact that the<br />
United Nation's o. wn power is limited, obviously sometimes<br />
makes it harder for it to have its view accepted or understood<br />
by people who might be involved in disputes. If a qreat power<br />
has an interest in a particular question it has, historically,<br />
proved very difficult for the United Nations to move effectively<br />
in that particular area.<br />
For the United Nations to work as effectively as many would. want,<br />
would involve some willingness to accept the activities of the<br />
United Nations in particular the decisions or recommendations<br />
of the United. Nations. I think great powers have often shown no<br />
willingness td accept recommendations or decisions if their own<br />
interests are affected while the smaller countries mright often<br />
find that they have no choice. To this extent, there is 0<br />
difference a.-distinction in what the United Nations. . can do<br />
in relation to the small compared to the large countries of the*<br />
world. Pre-eminently I believe we should seek to work so that<br />
the United Nations does become a more effective influence in<br />
the protection of the smaller powers. Some people suggest<br />
that events that have occurred in recent years, such as Detente,<br />
have resulted in a more peaceful and a more settled world. The<br />
events in the Middle. East, or Angola, do not really seem,<br />
however, to have shown a marked benefit from Detente.<br />
Australia values very much, the role of the United Nations. I<br />
believe that we have contributed to its workings, its<br />
humanitarian assistance programmes and its funds. We have given<br />
support, in material terms, for peace keeping operations. My<br />
Government will want to continue this support for the United<br />
Nations wholeheartedly. This morning, the Secretary-General<br />
mentioned to the Foreign Minister and myself, some areas v. here<br />
he felt that Australia's influence could usefully be applied Februarv 1976 </p>
<p>in helping to overcome some of the problems that the United<br />
Nations faces. We will be willing to accept some of these<br />
suggestions from the Secretary-General and that is something<br />
I know he will keep in mind. We wish tc make a real<br />
contribution to the solution of world problems including those<br />
in our own region. Although we will be concentrating more-in<br />
our immediate arena, where there is a possibility of Australia<br />
making a contribution in a wider fowrm we stand ready to do<br />
that. We are a rich country in natural resources and I<br />
believe that this imposes some international obligations upon<br />
US.<br />
We will continue to support the principles and purposes of the<br />
United Nations Charter. We wish the Secretary-General well in<br />
his exacting and sometimes frustrating role. We certainly<br />
wish him all the best for tho future and are grateful for<br />
his coming here for this visit and I would ask you all to join<br />
me in the toast to the Secretary-General. </p>
