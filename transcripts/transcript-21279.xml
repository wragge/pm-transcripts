    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, I wanted to ask you about whether you would consider, because it';s the only avenue open to you, injecting a large sum of black spot funding money into the southern part of the Princes Highway?  Because this carnage can';t keep on going on.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I';m aware of how bad the accident rate is.  But we have to maintain quite properly that it is a state funding responsibility#8230;</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I realise that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>#8230; the question of black spots, well I would have to talk to the experts about that.  I won';t make any commitment about that on the run.  But I';ll talk to John Anderson about that.  But we do have a black spots programme#8230;</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But it is an avenue open to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I';ll have to talk to the Deputy Prime Minister about that.  I';m not immediately familiar with the criteria.  But we do have funding arrangements and, I mean, if we';re going to maintain states in this country they have to meet their responsibilities.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What';s your reaction to Carl Scully';s offer to lead a delegation to#8230;</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that';s just a political stunt.  I mean, Carl Scully knows absolutely that under the funding arrangement the Princes Highway is a state government responsibility.  I mean, what is the point of having states if they won';t do their job?  I mean, I';m getting sick of this situation that every time the states fall down on their responsibilities they say, oh well we don';t get enough money from the Federal Government.  They';re getting more money from the Federal Government than ever under the GST.  All of the GST goes to the states and they';re rolling in it as a result.  Really this is making the whole federal system of government completely dysfunctional.  Either the states have got to do their job or they should pack up their tent and go.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Now, is there any good news for this area with the Auslink announcement?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, let';s wait and see.  Let';s wait and see.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>One more about aged care, you';ve injected huge funds into aged care and thank you for that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, we have indeed.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And we';ve got all this lovely money but no geriatricians.  Is there a possibility of#8230;?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I';ll talk to Mr Abbott about that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Absolutely not one?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I will talk to Mr Abbott about it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
