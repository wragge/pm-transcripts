PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 586<br />
October 1975<br />
THE BUDGET<br />
The present constitutional crisis must be resolved, and it must<br />
* be resolved quickly by the men who brought it about. There can<br />
no longer be any doubt that the opposition's policy on blocking<br />
the Budget has been rejected by an overriding majority of the<br />
Australian people and, increasingly, by Opposition Senators<br />
themselves.<br />
Many of you will. have seen the results of the latest public polls.<br />
To put it simply, they are quite devastating. It is not my usual<br />
practice to comment on these polls, but it's interesting to<br />
remember that Mr Fraser has always placed great store by them.<br />
He justified the rejection of the Budget by claiming massive<br />
public support for his chosen course. That course has proved<br />
disastrous; it has failed; the latest polls have shown it. They<br />
reveal that 70 percent of the Australian people believe the Budget<br />
should be passed. Well over half the Australian people believe<br />
the Government should be allowed to govern.<br />
This week we saw the final collapse of the long drawn-out and<br />
farcical Khemlani business the so-called loans scandal. The<br />
Opposition itself has admitted that nothing in Mr Khemlani's<br />
documents those eight mysterious suitcases could justify<br />
the unprecedented course they have taken. We know now that<br />
Mr Fraser is relying on a handful of Opposition Senators who have<br />
publicly expressed their reservations very grave reservations<br />
about the rejection of the national Budget. Senator Igessell,<br />
a Liberal, has said firmly that he would never vote against the<br />
Budget, and he added and I quote his words " A good many<br />
others would feel the same way as I do." That is, a number of<br />
Opposition Senators, who have gone along with the deferral of the<br />
Budget, are now saying they would never reject it. That's the<br />
sort of backing Mr Fraser has for his present policy doubts and<br />
fears among his own Senators, and overwhelming rejection by the<br />
Australian people. * 99/ 2 </p>
<p>I have to say frankly that the opposition's present tactics are<br />
perilous in the exctreme. It is not my intention, it is not my<br />
desire, to provoke needless fear or alarm. But we must be quite<br />
clear about the consequences of what is happening. The<br />
continual refusal to pass the Budget to give the elected<br />
Government the means to govern and maintain the essential<br />
services of the nation -is already damaging the business<br />
community,-threatening the normal life of the nation, and<br />
endangering the whole delicate process of economic recovery.<br />
These are critical weeks and months in the nation's life. The<br />
decisions we take now and above all the orderly working of<br />
our Budget strategy may well determine our economic future,<br />
our prosperity and strength, for years to come. Every day that<br />
passes, every day the Budget is delayed, makes our task more<br />
hazardous and difficult. I have said before there can be no<br />
surrender on this issue; the fundamental principle ofdemocracy<br />
is too important for me, or for any future Prime<br />
Minister. On that I am absolutely determined. I ask my fellow-<br />
Australians to stand with me in defence of this principle, and<br />
whatever trials may come, to maintain as best they can the<br />
normal business of * the nation. The Budget must pass. The<br />
Government must be allowed to govern. The economy and the<br />
nation must go forward. </p>
