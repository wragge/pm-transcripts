    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..........................................................................................................................</p>
<p> Thank you Bruce, to you and to my other Parliamentary colleagues,</p>
<p> to the Mayors of the local municipalities, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I'm here to do two things. Firstly and most importantly, to express</p>
<p> my support and my commendation for Bruce as your local federal member.</p>
<p> He has been a very energetic and active representative of the people</p>
<p> of Dunkley since he was elected in March of 1996. He's a real</p>
<p> local member, he takes up the cudgels on behalf of local organisations,</p>
<p> he drives Ministers to distraction until he gets satisfactory answers,</p>
<p> and that is exactly what a good local member should do and I commend</p>
<p> him to you in the warmest possible way.</p>
<p>The other thing I want to say to you very generally ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p> is something that's an important message to Australians, wherever</p>
<p> they live at the present time, and that is that there is little doubt</p>
<p> as you read in the newspapers, as you see on television, that in some</p>
<p> parts of the world, and most particularly in the Asian-Pacific region,</p>
<p> there's a fair amount of economic turmoil and a number of countries</p>
<p> are going through an extremely difficult time. Now, whilst Australia</p>
<p> can't hope to be completely isolated from that, we can hope if</p>
<p> we do the right thing, to weather the storm of the economic turmoil</p>
<p> in Asia, without it doing us any lasting damage.</p>
<p>And that is the objective of my Government. And that is why over the</p>
<p> past two-and-a- quarter years we've set about creating a budget</p>
<p> surplus, we've set about putting our economic house in order.</p>
<p>I know that in the process of doing that we've taken a few decisions</p>
<p> that not everybody has liked, and there is probably some people in</p>
<p> this room who haven't liked some of the decisions that we've</p>
<p> taken. I understand that, I'm sympathetic to that, but the general</p>
<p> objective has been to protect Australia and to give Australia economic</p>
<p> stability, security and safety in a sea of economic turmoil. And we</p>
<p> have done that, and if we had not done that, can I say to you without</p>
<p> any fear of contradiction, that we would be a far more worried and</p>
<p> vulnerable and weakened nation now, than what in fact we are.</p>
<p>Instead of us being able to stare the Asia-Pacific region in the eye</p>
<p> and say "yes we'll be affected by it a little bit and we</p>
<p> can't remain immune" we would have been essentially engulfed</p>
<p> by it. And it's very important that we keep that in mind over</p>
<p> the weeks and the months ahead, because there is really no alternative</p>
<p> but to continuing policies which strengthen and protect us against</p>
<p> this turmoil from abroad. If we don't do that we will import</p>
<p> that turmoil very, very rapidly.</p>
<p>And that's why it's essential that my Government press ahead</p>
<p> with such things as reforming our taxation system.</p>
<p>And one of the great advantages of reforming a tax system is that</p>
<p> you can export more, because under a reformed taxation system exports</p>
<p> are cheaper and more competitive and that means you can generate some</p>
<p> more jobs in export industries.</p>
<p>So we do need, at this time, to remember that more than ever in the</p>
<p> history of our country we are part of the world. We can't shut</p>
<p> ourselves off. We can't say it in the words of that song many,</p>
<p> many years ago "Stop the world, I want to get off". You</p>
<p> can't do that. You can't get off the world, you're</p>
<p> part of it. People run around saying we don't want foreign investment</p>
<p> in this country. If we drive foreign investment away it will go somewhere</p>
<p> else, and it will take hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs with</p>
<p> it, because we live in a foot-loose global environment.</p>
<p>And if you're a foreign investor in "country A" and</p>
<p> you look at Australia and Australia says "no we don't want</p>
<p> your investment" you'll say "okay I won't ask</p>
<p> you a second time, I'll go somewhere else, and in the process</p>
<p> I'll generate a hundred thousand jobs in another country instead</p>
<p> of generating them in Australia".</p>
<p>Now these are important issues. And it's not a time to fiddle</p>
<p> around with economic experiments, and it's not time to go back</p>
<p> to failed policies of big deficit and big debt, which is represented</p>
<p> by the approach of our predecessors. So it is important that we bare</p>
<p> those things in mind.</p>
<p>I know that we've had to do some things that people don't</p>
<p> like over the last two-and-a-quarter years, but I'm also happy</p>
<p> to say that we've done a lot of things that people wanted us</p>
<p> to do. And we've made a number of decisions in the past six months</p>
<p> or so that have strengthened the position of retired people in our</p>
<p> community and I can assure the retired, not only of this area, but</p>
<p> of all areas of Australia that when you see the details of our taxation</p>
<p> policy, you won't be concerned. You will see it as a policy that</p>
<p> protects your position, and a policy that builds on the protections</p>
<p> that are already there and a policy that is designed to boost and</p>
<p> strengthen the Australian economy.</p>
<p>What governments have got to do in these times is to communicate to</p>
<p> people the need for changes that are necessary, but equally to hang</p>
<p> on to those institutions and those values which are very important</p>
<p> to our identity as Australians.</p>
<p>I have frequently said, and I repeat it today, that the art of good</p>
<p> state-craft is to hang on to those things from the past that continue</p>
<p> to serve us well. I don't believe in change for changes sake,</p>
<p> I never have. I'm very conservative about a lot of issues because</p>
<p> I believe in hanging on to those traditional Australian values that</p>
<p> are important to our country. And I don't believe in change just</p>
<p> for the sake of doing something new.</p>
<p>But equally, I've never been reluctant in public life to say</p>
<p> to people, and to say to Australians, we have to change in order to</p>
<p> better ourselves and to protect ourselves, And what I'm saying</p>
<p> to the Australian community now is that it is not a time to turn inward</p>
<p> and backward in relation to economic change, because if we do that</p>
<p> we'll get trampled underfoot. We'll lose a lot of investment</p>
<p> in this country. It will go somewhere else because other countries</p>
<p> will have it and in the process we'll lose a lot of jobs and</p>
<p> a lot of Australians will be a lot worse off. I think it is important</p>
<p> that those things be understood.</p>
<p>I am very proud of what my Government has done over the last two-and-a-quarter</p>
<p> years. I'm proud of the fact that we have the lowest interest</p>
<p> rates for thirty years, whether it's in small business or housing.</p>
<p> I'm proud of the fact that we have the lowest inflation rate</p>
<p> in the western world. I'm proud of the fact that having inherited</p>
<p> a budget deficit of $10.5 billion I've now got a budget surplus,</p>
<p> or we have, of $2.7 billion. I'm proud of the fact that we are</p>
<p> seen as an attractive place for foreign investment.</p>
<p>Now I want to keep it that way. I want to build on it. Because if</p>
<p> we keep it that way and we build on it we can generate more investment,</p>
<p> more jobs and higher living standards. But if we start fiddling around</p>
<p> with that situation, if we go back to the policies of big deficit</p>
<p> and debt that our Labor opponents offer us, or if we experiment with</p>
<p> the policies offered by One Nation, it will scare foreign investment</p>
<p> out of Australia and destroy Australian jobs. We'll all be worse</p>
<p> off.</p>
<p>Now that is the choice that we have to make as a community. I don't</p>
<p> mean a choice next week, or next month, I mean a choice in terms of</p>
<p> political debate and understanding of what things are all about at</p>
<p> the present time.</p>
<p>Governing a country is always challenging. It's very challenging</p>
<p> in a global economic environment and we must always remember that</p>
<p> if we're part of the world, people can pick and choose as to</p>
<p> whether they come here and invest their resources, and if we scare</p>
<p> them off they'll go somewhere else and we'll never get them</p>
<p> back and we'll all be poorer as a consequence.</p>
<p>So ladies and gentlemen thank you for having me. Thank you for supporting</p>
<p> Bruce. Thank you for the contribution that you're making to the</p>
<p> community life in this part of Melbourne, and in this part of Victoria.</p>
<p> I think these gatherings always bring out the best of Australia. I</p>
<p> look around the room I see the representatives of the local community</p>
<p> organisations. I see the RSL represented. I see the ethnic community's</p>
<p> well represented. I see people who are service providers. I see, of</p>
<p> course, that great army of people, members of the Liberal Party represented.</p>
<p> I see small business people and I see members of some of the great</p>
<p> sporting and recreational organisations. And, of course, looking out</p>
<p> over that water makes me feel a bit at home, I see a bit of that where</p>
<p> I spend some time in Sydney.</p>
<p>So, ladies and gentlemen thank you very much. It's very, very</p>
<p> nice to be amongst you and he's a terrific bloke, give him all</p>
<p> the support you can.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
