ELECTORATE TALK<br />
During the World Heritage Committee Meeting at the Sydney<br />
Opera House last week, the Great Barrier Reef, the Kakadu National<br />
Park in Arnhem Land, and the Willandra Lakes region in western<br />
N. S. W. were inscribed on the World Heritage List. This list<br />
is made up of natural sites and man-made properties which are<br />
judged by the Committee, using the highest standards, to be of<br />
outstanding universal value to the whole of mankind. The sites<br />
and properties previously on the list range from the pyramids<br />
in Egypt to the Grand Canyon in the United States, from the<br />
Palace of Versailles to the Katmandu Valley, and from the<br />
ancient city of Damascus to the Galapagos Islands in Equador.<br />
The Barrier Reef, the Kakadu Park and the Willandra Lakes Region<br />
are worthy additions to a list which now numbers 1l. l sites and<br />
properties right around the world, and two other particularly<br />
important additions to the list at the Sydney Meeting were the<br />
famous Serengeti Game Park in Tanzania, and the Glaciers National<br />
Park, a vast alpine area and glacier in Argentina.<br />
The World Heritage Committee itself is made up of 21 of the 6: 1<br />
countries which are signatories to the U. N. World Heritage<br />
Convention. The World Heritage Committee first met in Paris<br />
in 1977 and the fact that the 1981 meeting was held in this country<br />
is a tribute to Australia's concern for conservation and for<br />
the environment.<br />
The official UNESCO representative at the meeting spoke in glowing<br />
terms of how much Australia is doing to preserve the natural and<br />
cultural heritage and of the constant desire of Australia to<br />
promote international co-operation in this field. The interest<br />
of Australians in conservation and heritage issues is long--standing<br />
and it is broadly-based. Some field naturalist clubs date back<br />
to the early part of this century. The National Trust movement<br />
has a membership of about 80,000, and the total membership of<br />
nature conservation bodies runs to a quarter of a million. T" he<br />
Conmmonwealth Government has put its: weight behind many major<br />
conservation and heritage initiatives. And our children will.<br />
inherit a better Australia, and to an extent a better world, as<br />
a result of what the Government has achieved. / 2 </p>
