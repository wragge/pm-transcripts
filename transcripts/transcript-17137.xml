    <content><![CDATA[<p>Eamon said a couple of weeks ago that there's no place for politics at a dinner like this.</p>
<p>And of course he's right.</p>
<p>But in my experience, packing 500 people of Irish extraction into a dining hall like this and offering to quench their thirst with a glass or seven of Guinness is the first step towards fomenting political insurrection.</p>
<p>Politics and the Irish go together like leprechauns and rainbows.</p>
<p>So in a warm spirit of non-partisan Irish hospitality, let me welcome my political opponent Tony Abbott to Queensland.</p>
<p>This time last year, I mentioned my namesake, St Kevin of Glendalough who lived in 6th century Ireland.</p>
<p>For those of you who aren't familiar with the works of this great saint, I can let you in on a little secret.</p>
<p>St Kevin was in fact an abbott.</p>
<p>He wasn't a mad abbott.</p>
<p>He was a run-of-the-mill abbott, given to long boring sermons and moral crusades against the lasciviously short loin cloths of the sixth century.</p>
<p>St Kevin in fact lived in a cave as a hermit for seven years - nothing compared to my ten long years in opposition.</p>
<p>His one great virtue was that he was attributed with many extravagant miracles - including steering his monastery through the global financial crisis of 578 AD.</p>
<p>He also held back wave after wave of unauthorised people movements of the latter 6th century, otherwise known as the Anglo-Saxons and Jutes.</p>
<p>St Anthony, on the other hand, was not Irish.</p>
<p>He was born in Portugal, lived in Italy and preached throughout Europe.</p>
<p>He was a seriously multicultural 13th century type.</p>
<p>St Anthony was trained as an Augustinian.</p>
<p>Be careful, Tony - Martin Luther also began life as an Augustinian.</p>
<p>In fact St Anthony was a man of shifting allegiances - later becoming a Franciscan.</p>
<p>St Anthony is now best known as the patron saint of lost things.</p>
<p>To be theologically correct, lost things probably doesn't extend to lost causes.</p>
<p>For that we must turn to St Jude.</p>
<p>And to be equally correct, St Anthony was canonised in record time - a mere 12 months after his passing, a testament to his virtue.</p>
<p>St Kevin on the other hand had to wait 1300 years.</p>
<p>Whether that says something about their namesakes in 21st century Australian politics, I'll leave you to judge.</p>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<p>One year ago, when I spoke to this gathering, I mentioned my Irish grandmother.</p>
<p>Hannah Cashin was born on the Tweed River in 1892.</p>
<p>She was the daughter of Irish parents who had migrated from the small parish of Ballingarry in County Tipperary.</p>
<p>I confessed to a few family secrets.</p>
<p>Like my family's links to the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848 - having come from the town where the national tricolour of green, white and orange was first unfurled.</p>
<p>And I owned up to my family's involvement in a long-running factional fight that raged across Tipperary in the 19th century, between the Shanavests and the Caravets.</p>
<p>There's even a whisper that Hannah Cashin's grandfather may have been the same William Cashin killed by the blow of a stone to his forehead in the great factional fight of 1838.</p>
<p>Which is probably why my forebears felt at home in the Australian Labor Party after they arrived on these shores.</p>
<p>But now that I've come clean about my own past - there's a matter of history that Tony needs to clear up.</p>
<p>No, I'm not asking Tony to discuss his views, as an ardent monarchist, on the actions of the British Crown against a nascent Irish republican movement.</p>
<p>I'm referring to a historic document that I have with me on the podium tonight.</p>
<p>It lists the names of the men and women transported to Australia on the Second Fleet in 1790.</p>
<p>It inscribes the name of my paternal forebear Thomas Rudd - from the thieving English side of my ancestry, as opposed to the revolutionary Irish side.</p>
<p>Thomas nicked a pair of shoes and got seven years in Australia.</p>
<p>He served his time.</p>
<p>He then returned to England - only to reoffend in 1799, and get transported to Australia for a second time, and for another seven years.</p>
<p>Getting transported to Australia twice for thieving reflected a prodigious talent.</p>
<p>And a worthy professional preparation for politics.</p>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<p>The question raised by this Second Fleet passenger list concerns another passenger.</p>
<p>On the same vessel to Australia that transported Thomas Rudd was another passenger by the name of:</p>
<p>William ABBOTT - from Norfolk</p>
<p>The question I have is, does Billy Abbott bear any ancestral relationship to Tony Abbott?</p>
<p>And what was his offence?</p>
<p>And did the forebears of Rudd and Abbott ever cross each other on the high seas - burdening future generations of Rudds and Abbotts with a score to be settled that would finally be fought out on the national stage more than two centuries later?</p>
<p>But as Eamon has said, a Queensland Irish Association event like tonight's is no time for politics.</p>
<p>Especially not in an election year.</p>
<p>So I won't be making any policy announcements tonight.</p>
<p>Although, this being an election year I asked my department to provide the Cabinet with some options for boosting St Patrick's Day celebrations.</p>
<p>They came up with three.</p>
<p>Option one - making the new national anthem It's A Long Way to Tipperary.</p>
<p>Option two - replacing the AFL, and rugby league and rugby union with Gaelic Football as the national football code.</p>
<p>Option three - my personal preference - opening up the Lodge to all Irish Australians for St Patrick's Day, with an open bar and Guinness on tap.</p>
<p>And so it shall be if we see the re-election of the Rudd Government.</p>
<p>A few comments of a more serious nature.</p>
<p>As we know, Ireland isn't exactly the world's largest nation.</p>
<p>But it's hard to think of a national day celebrated with such spirit and enthusiasm anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>And two million of our 22 million Australians claim Irish ancestry.</p>
<p>This reflects the vast reach of the Irish diaspora.</p>
<p>And the enduring power of Irish culture and identity.</p>
<p>But that's Ireland - small nation, with big hearts and a grand character.</p>
<p>The course of our nation's history was profoundly influenced by Irish migrants and their progeny - the Ned Kellys, James Scullins, Ben Chifleys and Paul Keatings.</p>
<p>Including those who, in the words of Chifley, shone their light on a hill.</p>
<p>As well as by less well-known Australians of Irish descent.</p>
<p>Those who we might say, followed the old Irish folk custom of putting a candle in a darkened window, to guide the way of strangers.</p>
<p>People who, one by one, helped build our national character as Australians.</p>
<p>The larrikin humour.</p>
<p>The rebellious character.</p>
<p>The deep suspicion of authority.</p>
<p>The warm hospitality.</p>
<p>What became for us mateship.</p>
<p>And the deep, deep instinct to defend the underdog.</p>
<p>Great Irish traits - traits that we can all celebrate.</p>
<p>That's why I'm delighted to announce a very special celebration.</p>
<p>On St Patrick's Day next year, the National Museum of Australia will open the most comprehensive exhibition ever on the Irish in Australia.</p>
<p>It will celebrate all aspects of the Irish contribution to Australia.</p>
<p>Its time span will extend from the Irish who came on the First Fleet, to the thousands of Irish backpackers who visit Australia every year.</p>
<p>It will be a generous and scholarly exhibition, with hundreds of exhibits from every state in Australia and from Ireland and the United States.</p>
<p>Many of those items have never been on display before.</p>
<p>The National Museum tells me that no country has ever had an exhibition on this scale, celebrating the contribution of the Irish diaspora.</p>
<p>The exhibition should attract interest from all across the world, and I expect it to be seen by tens of thousands of Australians before the National Museum takes the exhibition to Ireland later in 2011.</p>
<p>And in June this year, ahead of next year's exhibition, the National Museum of Australia will be publishing a book to celebrate the stories of Irish Australians - suitably titled Sinners, Saints and Settlers.</p>
<p>Friends, the first occasion when the Queensland Irish Association's St Patrick's Day celebrations were held here in Tara House was 1928.</p>
<p>The Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, James Duhig, great friend of Labor Premiers T.J. Ryan and Red Ted Theodore - spoke on that occasion of his great pride as an Irish Australian.</p>
<p>His pride in the history, the culture and the values that came with being Australian of Irish descent.</p>
<p>But more than all of that, he spoke of his belief that God had given a diversity of gifts to different peoples throughout the world.</p>
<p>And he spoke of Australia's special opportunity.</p>
<p>"Never in the history of the world", Archbishop Duhig said, had any nation had such a great opportunity for combining these diverse gifts of different cultures.</p>
<p>He spoke of the combination of the Irish, the English, the Welsh, the French, the Germans, Italians and the Danes.</p>
<p>Eighty years and three generations later, Archbishop Duhig's words still ring true.</p>
<p>Ours is a culture today more greatly enriched by the gifts of cultures from every part of the world.</p>
<p>And no nation has a greater opportunity than does Australia, to bring together, in harmony, those different cultures - to build something far greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>Australia is a young nation.</p>
<p>Our future offers extraordinary opportunity.</p>
<p>And no people have made a greater contribution to our history, character and identity than the children of St Patrick.</p>
<p>So on the eve of St Patrick's Day, we celebrate Ireland.</p>
<p>And we celebrate Ireland's contribution to the great nation that we all cherish - Australia.</p>
<p>So tonight I propose a toast - to Australia.</p>
