    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to be launching today the Australian Government's Tourism White Paper: A Medium to Long Term Strategy for Tourism.</p>
<p>The strategy will be supported by a major new investment in tourism, which I am pleased to announce involves additional funding worth a total of $235 million over four and a half years.</p>
<p>The Government is also announcing a restructuring of key tourism bodies.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of the plan is to work closely with industry to further develop international markets now and into the future.</p>
<p>As a nation we have shown the world that we are a sophisticated, friendly and open country in the magnificent way we have hosted both the 2003 Rugby World Cup and the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.  Our aim is to build on both the achievements of these events, and on the strengths of the industry throughout the country.</p>
<p>Importantly it is also a plan that recognises the tremendous importance of tourism to regional towns and districts right across Australia, and it seeks to continue to increase the opportunities and extend the economic benefits in regional communities.</p>
<p>The key funding measures to support the implementation of the White Paper include:</p>
<p> additional funding for international marketing totalling $120.6 million over four and a half years;</p>
<p> an increase of $45.5 million in funding for domestic tourism marketing, including marketing under the See Australia flagship;</p>
<p> an additional $19 million over four years for the Tourism Development Programme with a focus on regional Australia; and</p>
<p> extending the provision of quality research and statistics by providing an additional $21.5 million for this purpose.</p>
<p>The funding boost for international marketing takes the Australian Government's total budget for this programme to over $500 million for the next four and a half years</p>
<p>Importantly, the funding measures are to be implemented in conjunction with a strategic restructuring of tourism bodies.</p>
<p>A new central body to be called Tourism Australia will be formed by bringing together the Australian Tourist Commission, the Tourism Forecasting Council, the Bureau of Tourism Research and See Australia.</p>
<p>In addition, a new unit within Tourism Australia is to be established and called Tourism Events Australia.  It will focus on promoting Australia as a high quality business and events destination.</p>
<p>Over recent decades Australian tourism has achieved remarkable growth and now makes a tremendous contribution to our economy.</p>
<p>The vast majority of tourism businesses are small or medium in size, and together they make an immense contribution to our economy.</p>
<p>The industry employs more than 550,000 Australians, and generates $17 billion per year in export earnings.</p>
<p>In addition to this, domestic tourism is currently worth over $52 billion a year, with more than half of this expenditure occurring in regional and rural Australia.</p>
<p>Over recent years tourism and tourism related businesses have endured the adverse impacts of a series of international events, including terrorist attacks, the collapse of Ansett and SARS.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges it remains a self reliant and outward looking industry.  A further aim of the White Paper is to reinforce the industry's self reliance so that any international shocks in the future can be better managed from within.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone from the tourism industry who contributed to the consultation process on the White Paper.  The constructive and cooperative nature of the process was appreciated by the Government.</p>
<p>The Government is willing to work in partnership with the industry to implement the Tourism White Paper which is aimed at ensuring that as a nation we achieve renewed growth and further development in tourism, and reap the economic and social benefits afforded by this vital industry.</p>
