TRIBUTE TO FORiME P2ESIDEiT LYTDON B. JOHNSON<br />
Lyndon Johnson will be remembered as one of the great<br />
reforming Presidents of the United States. Nothing should be<br />
allowed to diminish the memory of this achievement.<br />
He came to office in the most difficult and tragic<br />
circumstances and assumed his great responsibilities with<br />
valour and distinction. HIe went on to secure, in the Presidential<br />
election in 1964, the greatest popular mandate in the history<br />
of the Republic. Under his Administration, the 90th Congress<br />
was among the most active in his country's history, with a<br />
record of achievement and innovation in social and welfare<br />
legislation unmatched in our generation.<br />
President Johnson involved his country more deeply in<br />
the Vietnam var than any other President. He was, in a real<br />
sense, a victim of this disastrous conflict. Yet no one would<br />
have welcomed more warmly the present steps towards a peaceful<br />
settlenmt. Australians have vivid and cordial memories of his<br />
visits to Australia in 1942, in October 1966, and in December<br />
1967. He was the only American President to have visited this<br />
country while in office. His presence at the memorial service<br />
for the late Harold Holt was a signal demonstration of his<br />
affection for the Australian people and his own high estimation<br />
of the value of the Australian-American alliance.<br />
On behalf of the Lustralian Government, I extend to his<br />
family and to the American people our profound sympathy in the<br />
loss they have sustained.<br />
