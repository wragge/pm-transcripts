PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRIME MINISTER ON 2WS -WFIAh STEVE RAYMoND 19 ) AN<br />
1987<br />
R b 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
sk: and if I press the right buttons here I shoul1d hn'<br />
able to talk to the PMI of Australia.<br />
PM: G'day Steve sorry to keep you waiting.<br />
ST? No dramas. Happy New Year.<br />
PM: TFhank you v. much Steve and the sasme to you and all your<br />
listeners have a happy and prosperous 1987.<br />
SR: Four years ong, is the job getting any easier or is it more<br />
hard work?<br />
PM: Well it to a mixture Steve. AUSwork in thc sense that you<br />
know arid d" PPvL-eiatL1 tev. tough economic year last year and that<br />
required enorrious airiount of extra decision making and that was hard<br />
work. It is eas~ ier in the other sense Steve. that I sucss whatever,<br />
work you're_ yours, mine or whatever, the longer you are in it and<br />
if you a~ re Intelligent you learn the ropes and things come efiter.<br />
Its a mixture. I think the actual doing of the job has become<br />
easier but there are et few more things on the plate.<br />
SR. Any timc for an JIntrospection.<br />
PM: I do try to take the odd t ime off just to think how things<br />
are going. WhUL ings have happened over the recent Past, how wC </p>
<p>( 4<br />
have handled them. Whatv Lite sort of way we should be joing things<br />
now and for the rest Of the Yeav.. SO I do think about my performanceib4<br />
the performance of the 8OVL11UJ1nI. in that. way.<br />
SR: Do we have you ( inatAdiblQi) tQ ridiiiir iny % jciruat ion<br />
that Paul Koating will be mnoved from Treasut-y?<br />
PM-Yeg. While we are in tha -t Yes/ No mode is it possible to lock<br />
in a PL-ozfi-e No election in 1 87?<br />
PM: Not early 1ma ae. jUta h alaetwill<br />
go full ternm and that means STevc, that at the end of ' 87<br />
or in thc early part of 88.<br />
SR: Ok. For somebody who really believes in the benefit. s of<br />
coflcCTsus you must h ave. taikenr heart front p1' ogrecs = ade in the<br />
pastj couple of days by Simon Creani and Charles Copenian an unlikely<br />
double, but they seeni to have tictually thrashed out some advances<br />
in the Pilbera dispute and 1 guess that. is the essenice of concensus<br />
&amp; s you see it?<br />
A11-1 Tl%&amp; t-~ ly LLS1. t i-s-wna-t-fl-ave-iv-ad--oni<br />
all my life from the tisitt: I wab president of trne AUTU, I never took<br />
tho attitude that we were &amp; lWdLy. LighiL. Or any industrial<br />
dispute risht(?) was always on the side of the trade unions. I<br />
think it 4A like lirt. whelther donicttic nrgiime-ritt or dlsputet;<br />
in football clubs or iii tiny groups. Its v. rarely that absolute<br />
right iS on one side aind so I have always taken the view that the<br />
sensible thing to get the best out of the situation Is to get people<br />
to silt down and talk And then see whether you can work I'&amp; cyic Lhiig<br />
out t1: 6tiacr. And that iti the principle 1: have had to try -toapply<br />
In Govt since I have been PM. And yes you are right I am pleased<br />
to see that Simon Crean sat down and talked to Charlie Copcman<br />
nnd that thwy beeuicd to ha~ ve worked buinething out because that Is<br />
IMPOrtait Riot only for the workers and the. company up ' there but<br />
It is tmportant 44 the iron ore industry but It Is also V.<br />
important for all Australiaio because that is a significant part of<br />
our export Income. And. Lundiahime flm impact on the ot andard vr livingU </p>
<p>of all or, us.<br />
SR: PM. I know you plan no intervent ion in the Rupert Murdoch<br />
takeover of the HWT but woul d you comment on the publ Ic perceptiJon<br />
that the reason both Labor and the Coalition are so quict on this<br />
subject is because that you are all scared of off~ ending R. Murdoch<br />
who will soonl control unparutdled political clout.<br />
PM: Oh, no. I can personally comicnt on thait. Let tre say these<br />
things.... . As far as I am--concerned gefl-CL'afl-y-, t sm hn<br />
applies when the question of Holmes a Court raid on BlIP WaS. concerned.<br />
I took the view that it was best left. to th e-market and thiat<br />
was interpreted then as Hawke arid the g. ovt. atnllvuzo<br />
If a Court. Now I find exactly the same rule on this occaision<br />
and said.. tt should apply to the narket.... Weli that was deerncd to<br />
bc acting for Murdoch and against H a Courtwith th e same principle<br />
but different players. It we are going to lbe a free enterprise<br />
economy which is based on the operation of* market forces then I<br />
think that that has to work its way through. Blut it is not absolute<br />
and we have done 2 things.... . tfhe trade practices commrniozci and<br />
the requirements there with regard to monopulisation and Mr Murdoch<br />
will have to meet the requirements as fielias indicated that he'<br />
will of' that legislation. And also we havc brought in aid<br />
proposed and we will be b ringing -h rough-411e-P&amp;-ri amen t,-l eg-is Iat ion<br />
to stop cross-media monopolisation in areas. In other words, the<br />
same person~ not going to be able to in u patzticular area, have<br />
v, newpapers and radio. And I think that is a v. forward and<br />
progressive step so that will require Mfr Murdoch to divest himself<br />
of certain parts of what he is acquirIng-. and in this way I think<br />
the legimate interests Of the Aust. comnmuntity will be protected.<br />
SR: ne other thought on that subject. What hapjliens some<br />
time in the future if Rupert Murdoch * decides onice-again to turn<br />
his editorial armioury against the AL. P. Will you stand accused<br />
of hielping him load the gun?<br />
PM: I suppose people might do that. what you have got to<br />
say basically it you look back over the history of this country<br />
and the attitude or the owners of the Press to J~ Ldor they haven't </p>
<p>historical ly, any of thein, been our friends. So i f Mr Murdoch were<br />
to shoot the gull t us what would be new? It is-not as though<br />
the lerald, if Dmight say so, has beer, a friend of Labor.<br />
If there has been a viol enmt, vir-ulent ant i-labor jour-nal in thif<br />
country in the last few yeayrs, its b~ etj the Meib. Hecrald. It has<br />
been viciously ant i-Labo.-. Sc, if Mr Murdochi were to fi ic a fewg<br />
salves at us it couldr
