On this sacred day we honour all Gallipoli veterans as we honour all Australian service men and women who gave or offered their lives in war. Over 100,000 Australians have died in the military service of their nation.<br />
Today we pay tribute to them and our veterans who have known the hardships of conflict as much as the blessings of peace.<br />
The Gallipoli landing and campaign was one of the defining moments in our nation's history.<br />
In the years that have followed, Anzac Day has remained the story of an aspiring nation's courage.  It has remained relevant not to glorify war or to paint some romantic picture of our history but to draw upon a great example of unity and common purpose.<br />
On this day we also give thanks to friends and allies who shared our danger and we add our pledge that their loyalty will neither be forgotten nor unreturned.<br />
As well as providing a day of commemoration, Anzac Day is also a time for all of us to reflect with gratitude on those great values that unite us as Australians - values such as mateship, courage, initiative and determination.<br />
This is because the same Anzac spirit that has guided us through adversity and triumph seems to slumber periodically only to draw new breath when the national interest calls to bring Australians together in times of need.</p>
<p>On this Anzac Day we especially honour those Australian Defence Force personnel currently serving in Afghanistan in the war against terrorism and elsewhere to support our national interest.<br />
Our young soldiers, sailors and airmen stand today as their Anzac forebears did more than three quarters of a century ago - willing to serve their nation and eager to defend its freedoms. </p>
