PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
THZ NATIONAL PRESS CLUB<br />
CANBERRA 3 JULY 19G7<br />
Members of the National Press Club,<br />
There a~ o two crystal clear issues of overwhelming<br />
importance which the Australian electorate must determine on<br />
11 July.<br />
Who can provide Australia with the responsible<br />
econonic management it needs?<br />
And who can provide Australia with the united and credible<br />
polittcal leadership it deserves?<br />
When I opened this campaign I said that in Australia's<br />
post-waT period there had been no more important election<br />
than thio.<br />
As we near the end of the campaign, that judgewent has been<br />
thoroughly vindicated.<br />
For the last few weeks of campaigning have draiaatically<br />
highlighted what the last four years of Government strongly<br />
suggested that Labor offers Australia the only path to<br />
assured economic growth and political stability.<br />
Let me first address the issue of economic management.<br />
During our four years in office, my Ministers and I have<br />
consistently and responsibly outlined the facts about the<br />
econonic challenge we face the good news as well as the<br />
bad. That's how we've campaigned in this election.<br />
We have addressed the issues. We have not shirked the fact<br />
that sacrifices have been necessary in the past and that the<br />
way ahead will still require tough decisions and hard work.<br />
But even while the campaign itself has progressed, a steady<br />
flow of evidence has emerged to confirm that our policies<br />
are working.<br />
Figures were released showing falling interest rates, a<br />
shrinking balance of payments deficit and rising investment. ( J( JOl 7 </p>
<p>Since Februaiy: 90 &amp; ay Treasury note yields have fallen by 4 1/ 2<br />
pe: zent;<br />
the L: year bond rate has fallen by almost 1 1/ 4<br />
pe: : ent; and<br />
the 7aximum prime overdraft rate of the major banks<br />
has : allen by 2 1/ 4 per cent.<br />
Three smaller: banks have already reduced their mortgage<br />
rates. And hank representatives agree that, under Labor<br />
policies, a r:. re general decline in mortgage rates can be<br />
expected before year's end.<br />
Figures for t'-e Ray balance of payments deficit were<br />
released. Th: y came in well below market expectations<br />
the -: tcome this financial year is now expected to<br />
be e 1 1/ 2 billion dollars below the Budget<br />
est z3to and a further fall is expected in 1987-88;<br />
ox-por'ts of imanufactures are up 34 per cent and we<br />
now -vo a surplus on tourism compared with a<br />
large defAcit just 2 years ago.<br />
A most import-. t but virtually unnoticed set of figures was<br />
released rela': ng to investment. These suggest real growth<br />
in new capital expenditure of 3 per cent in 1986-87,<br />
compared'with a 1 per cent fall expected at Budget time.<br />
They also raice expected growth next year by 4 per cent.<br />
This echoed t:: etpac-CAI's survey which showed an improving<br />
outlook for investment in manufacturing. Encouragingly,<br />
that survey aSDin showed an historically high expected level<br />
of exports.<br />
Consumer senticent and retail sales have picked up.<br />
And further evidence has emerged of Australia's enmeshment<br />
with our dynaeic region.<br />
Three years of patient work has paid off with the<br />
announcement that the Channar iron ore mine is to<br />
be developed as a joint venture with China,<br />
entireLy for the Chinese market the first iron<br />
ore nine to be opened in Australia in 15 years,<br />
further opening the door for other mines and other<br />
producers to participate in the rapid expansion of<br />
China's iron and steel industry;<br />
A new ; oint venture, also with China, was announced<br />
by the Victorian Government to fabricate aluminium<br />
products in China, partly using exports from the<br />
Portland smelter; and<br />
data released in Japan shows substantial growth in<br />
.; 00178 </p>
<p>primary products.<br />
we will seek further enmeshment of the Australian<br />
economy with our region.<br />
We uill facilitate the expansion of our tourism<br />
industry.<br />
And as a spocial priority, the next Hawke Government will<br />
further address the training and education needs of our<br />
greatest rocource the Australian people.<br />
We will encourage more children to complete school, more<br />
young unempLoyed people will take up training opportunities,<br />
and more aduLts will get vocational help.<br />
Each of these priority commitments will improve our capacity<br />
to compete ti; th the rest of the world in the production and<br />
export of ranufactures and services. Each will help remedy<br />
our balance o5 payments position and help reduce our<br />
reliance on debt.<br />
If we do the hard work, Australia should be able to double<br />
its manufacturing exports by the early 1990s and that will<br />
mean growth 7. nd prosperity for us all.<br />
And I want . o stress that each of these commitments is<br />
achievable, roalistic, relevant to our overall strategy of<br />
building our-national prosperity.<br />
They are not -,, llusory tax cuts. They do not depend on<br />
hypothetical c" incentivation". They do not require us to<br />
tear up the sofety net which supports the needy in our<br />
community. Indeed they are achievable side by side with further<br />
progress in ccnstructing that safety net.<br />
We have prom"' ced in this campaign to introduce a new Family<br />
Allowance Supplement, to help Australia's neediest families<br />
to lift their children out of poverty.<br />
It will direct to the mothers of some half a million<br />
Australian families a payment of $ 22 a week for each child<br />
or $ 28 for teenagers aged 13 to<br />
We will also increase support for those families in private<br />
rented accomnodation, and to those families who carry the<br />
care and responsibility of raising a disabled child.<br />
We will make it easier for pensioners to take short-term<br />
work without losing their benefits.<br />
As an election promise our commitment to Australia's<br />
families is everything the Liberals' tax cuts are not.<br />
It is affordable, where their tax cuts would bust the<br />
budget. it is directed to those most in need, where the 00 180 </p>
<p>Liberals would most help those who are better off. And it<br />
will be delivered..<br />
But the surest ways a Government can lift the living<br />
standards of A\ ustralian families are by creating jobs for<br />
them, by creating the climate for greater productivity and<br />
by creating tio social infrastructure that will allow the<br />
fruits of growth to be distrib~ uted fairly.<br />
Let me briefl~ y compare the records of Hawke and Howard in<br />
job creation.<br />
In just over sour years we have created nearly 800,000 new<br />
jobs. That represento four times the annual growth in jobG under<br />
the Coalition and about twice the average for the OECD.<br />
And if we stick at the hard task of reconstructing the<br />
economy we can expect a continued steady growth in the<br />
number of job3.<br />
All this leads directly to the great tax deception which iG<br />
central to ouK opponents' campaign and central to the great<br />
issue of res? onsible economic management.<br />
For it ir. no understatement to say that any serious attempt<br />
to implement th~ e Liberal tax cuts would destroy the economic<br />
foundations wo have built and tear apart the social fabric<br />
of this nation.<br />
Look at how tho Liberal tax cuts were discredited.<br />
First there was the revelation that the proposed tan rate<br />
for average income earners was not 25 per cent as claimed,<br />
but 38 per c. en'. which forced the Liberal to withdraw their<br />
brochure publicising their Bicentennial tax scales.<br />
Second there was the massive double counting in their<br />
spending cuts an error which by itself should have been<br />
enough to flaw fatally the whole illusion of tax cuts.<br />
Third was the discovery that the promised tax cut of $ 26 a<br />
week for the zo-called average family in fact would in fact<br />
cost moot single income families on $ 19,000 a year some $ 14<br />
a week.<br />
But there was more. Fourth came the fib that the tax cuts<br />
could be paid gor by cutting 3 cents in every dollar of<br />
Government spending a claim which under pressure John<br />
Howard agreed was 9 cents but which in fact requires at<br />
least 16 cents in the dollar.<br />
That prompted the unprecedented call by the Financial Review<br />
for Mir Howard to withdraw his " disgraceful' TV advertisement<br />
which persistod with the 3 cents claim.<br />
Next came Ian Sinclair's declaration that tax cuts would be<br />
Jot,"! 1 l </p>
<p>the third cab off the rank after reductions in the deficit<br />
and interest rates, John Howard said no all the cabs would<br />
leave at cncel<br />
And yesterday, the Liberals produced a sixth stunning<br />
revelation I. o discredit themselves.<br />
The Opposition'a health spokesman, Senator Baume, claimed<br />
the tax cuto would be phased in over a three year period<br />
and not, ac John Howard had said, introduced from the first<br />
of February next year.<br />
In other words, the very basis of the Liberals' tax bribe<br />
the $ 26 a o. eet tax cut is fast becoming a case of tax cuts<br />
on the nevor never.<br />
In 1977, PL: Koward grabbed their fistful of dollars back<br />
after the oLcction. In 1987 they have excelled themselves<br />
they have Vrabbod their tax cuts back before the election.<br />
So here is tho great conjuring trick the Liberals say they<br />
will cut inccme tax and abolish the capital gains and fringe<br />
benefits t;: oG while cutting an unprecedented slice out<br />
of government spending while protecting the pensioners<br />
and the dicsdvantaged and protecting the defence budget<br />
while graduvlly elininating the budget deficit!<br />
Nr Howard said he wouldn't put his name to a tax policy that<br />
didn't add up. out this doesn't add up. It can't add up.<br />
The net impact of the Liberals' tax cuts would be to make<br />
most people worse off. But let's just take them for a<br />
moment at their face value.<br />
Their claim ic based on the offer of incentives to workers<br />
to stay lonor at work<br />
but Cor two million taxpayers Mr Howard offers a I<br />
cent increase in their marginal tax rate and, for a<br />
further 2.7 million people he offers only a 2 per<br />
cent cut; and<br />
for half of the group most likely to respond to<br />
such opportunities, that is, women, there will in<br />
fact be no added incentive. For one in ten there<br />
will he a marginal gain of two cents in the dollar<br />
while two in ten would actually lose.<br />
That is hard-y a basis for an incentive led economic<br />
reconstruction.<br />
Nor is it a basis for the $ 900 million of incentive effects<br />
which he has claimed to finance his promises.<br />
So if incentive-led growth is not the product of Liberal<br />
policies, what is?<br />
The sad reality is that a consumption boom financed by tax 000132 </p>
<p>iiuihim i~ 7<br />
cuts, if del. ivered, would blow out the current account<br />
deficit by an estimated $ 1 billion.<br />
Among other things that would weaken our currency and pump<br />
up our external debt which, as the EPAC Office has shown,<br />
" would be paid for in a sustained reduction in the share of<br />
resources available for domestic expenditure in the longer<br />
term"; that is, in plain language, and contrary to Mr<br />
Howard's clEAi, lower living standards.<br />
Let's recall the assessment of the New York investment<br />
house, Goldaan Sachs, that the Liberal tax cuts are<br />
" dangerous". This is the institution which John Howard<br />
himself described as highly reputable. Goldman Sachs<br />
expressed a preference for the continuation of the Labor<br />
Government, Qointed to the disunity in the Opposition<br />
parties and a~ plauded the distinct improvement in tho major<br />
economic indicators over the last few months under Labor.<br />
We clearly carnot afford the Howard experiment. Neither can<br />
our kids.<br />
The Liberals claim to have policies to boost living<br />
standards tthey don't.<br />
Mr Howard said last November<br />
whcn I unveil the ( tax) policy I will explain where<br />
the noncy is coming from. I accept the responsibility,<br />
I always have, to explain to people that if you are<br />
offering lower tax you have to explain where the<br />
money's coming from."<br />
And in February this year he said<br />
" Any politician who thinks he can be a credible national<br />
figure without telling the people where the money is<br />
coming from is absolutely kidding himself."<br />
And that lezds me to the second great issue for<br />
determination by the Australian electorate on Saturday: the<br />
credibility of the political leadership offered by Labor and<br />
the Opposition parties.<br />
For the Opposition parties suffer a disability more<br />
crippling than even their weakness on the tax issue.<br />
It is not just a question of the impossibility of their<br />
carrying out any particular proposal.<br />
They have proved incapable of governing themselves they<br />
could not govern the nation.<br />
This is their real credibility gap.<br />
Not only did the Liberals spend their time in<br />
Opposition squabbling over the mantle of leadership<br />
and dividing into factions of wets, dries and 000) 1 3 3 </p>
<p>8<br />
innumerates;<br />
Not only did the foundation stone of conservative<br />
politics, the coalition, shatter into fragments;<br />
Not only did the National Party split in half;<br />
ot only all this but when they came under the<br />
bright spotlight of the election campaign their<br />
hastily drawn up truce collapsed and thay went back<br />
to fighting their battles among themselves again.<br />
Ian Sinclair declared a conservative victory would be<br />
followed by a period of closed-door negotiations with the<br />
Liberals to work out which of their promises to implement<br />
and which to abandon.<br />
john stone then declared that the Queensland Nationals were,<br />
simply not prepared to accept the policies of tho Liberal<br />
Party.<br />
And yesterd:, iy a senior Queensland National Party source was<br />
reported to say that Party would not join a Coalition<br />
without recciving concessions from the Liberals on tax<br />
policies c nd leadership positions. " We are not going to be<br />
part of a coalition which refuses to embrace our policies<br />
and belie % s6that source said. The Queensland Nationals<br />
would. tell ; qr Howard to embrace Joh's 25 per cent single<br />
rate tax.<br />
This is a '. au which M-r Howard has called " phoney" because it<br />
would eithe,: mean 20 per cent of the community getting a<br />
huge tax cut and 80 per cent being left for dead or sending<br />
the country " bankrupt by adding $ 8 or $ 9 billion to the<br />
deficit'. The logic o this is clear: the conservatives could not<br />
form a Coalition Government.<br />
Has there 2ver been a clearer choice placed before the<br />
Australian people?<br />
on one sida stands a government with firm policies in place<br />
' 1 realistic, responsible, achievable policies;<br />
policies which are already yielding their success,<br />
as interest rates fall, as the deficit falls, as<br />
inflation falls; and<br />
policies which will be extended, in the ways I have<br />
q outlined, to enable Australia to complete the task<br />
of rebuilding and revitalising our industry to meet<br />
the challenge of open and vigorous competition with<br />
the rcest of the world.<br />
on the other side stands an Opposition producing policies on<br />
the run 0001841 </p>
<p>An opposition whose leader, three days before the<br />
end of the campaign, haG still not confirmod any of<br />
hic shadow o~ inistry in their jobs.<br />
Against the Government's united, competent team stand<br />
john Howard, 26 faceless men and Ian Sinclair.<br />
But even here, perhaps there is something to thank Joh for.<br />
Because he hao ruled out Ian!<br />
The Opposition goes to the people incapable of teamiworkeven<br />
for tho purposes of an election campaign, much less the<br />
heavy respons-Ibility of Government.<br />
It is an Oppooltion whose political compromises won't work<br />
and whose tant cut fantasies can't work.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Australia io m~ id-way through meeting the historic challenge<br />
of reconstruction.<br />
But we're on way<br />
Trancforming the nation from the complacent Lucky<br />
Country to the Productive Country, the innovative<br />
anc: E-" ard-torking Country.<br />
Under Labor, wie're moving<br />
To the challenge of open and vigorous competition<br />
with the rest of the world instead of the security<br />
blanket of protected introspection;<br />
To enmeshment with our region rather than<br />
insularity; To the resilience derived from economic diversity<br />
ane. productivity instead of the vulnerability born<br />
of our over-reliance on commodities;<br />
To the shared rewards of constructive co-operation<br />
inctead of the fruitlessness of confrontation; and<br />
To a society whose hallmark is equality of<br />
opportunity for all instead of one in which the<br />
dice were loaded in favour of a privileged few,<br />
right through from the tax system to education.<br />
This is a massive transformation and it will require yet<br />
more hard work.<br />
And it is becaiuse we still have work to do as a nation that<br />
the issues of responsible economic management and credible<br />
political leadership are so crucial in this election.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, 000135) i </p>
<p>it is with eptitmica an a firmI bolief in Labor's unique<br />
ability to provido that manalguont and that leadership that<br />
we are secking a renowed mandato from the Australian pe2ople<br />
on 11 July. 000136 </p>
