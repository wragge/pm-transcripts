PRIME MINISTER8<br />
) 4 NoF-sr Lq7<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, today announced that,<br />
following the passage of the Appropriation Bills, the Administrative<br />
Arrangements Order had been amended to return responsibility for<br />
the GoverrLment's activities in relation to the procurement,<br />
purchase and disposal of goods from the Department of Manufacturing<br />
Industry to the Department of Administrative Services.<br />
n l\ : T<br />
The Prime Minister indicated that these functions had been<br />
temporarily transferred to the Department of Manufacturing<br />
Industry on 30 October 1975 to ensure that the staff engaged<br />
on them could be paid at least until the end of the Supply<br />
period from appropriations originally allocated for them.<br />
Mr Fraser pointed out that in a press statement on 30 October 1975<br />
his predecessor had made it clear that the transfer then made was<br />
a temporary administrative measure taken because of the delay in<br />
the passage of the Appropriation Bills. In transferring the<br />
functions and staff back to the Department of Administrative<br />
Services the Government was simply carrying out the announced<br />
intentions of the previous Government.<br />
