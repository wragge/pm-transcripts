PRIME MINISTER<br />
-TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW W-ITH-THE--PRIME-INfISTER---WA YSIDE.. CHAPEL<br />
SYDNEY, FRIDAY 16 JANUARY 1987<br />
Good morning Sir, is this your first trip to the Wayside Chapel<br />
at the Cross.<br />
PM: Yes it is. I have had the opportunity of getting to know<br />
Ted Noffs over a period of time, particularly in regard to his<br />
work in the drug education area and there has been financial<br />
assistance provided from the Fed Govt and the State govt but Ted<br />
belives that more is needed to ensure that the best possible<br />
can be done for as many people and he suggested that I should -come<br />
and see the work being done here and I was more than happy to do<br />
so-. And I must say-Ted I am-enormousl-y i-mpressed-,---favourably<br />
by the quality of the work, the imagination and the good sense<br />
and the way that it is done the positive way in which fronm the<br />
start that you try tell the kids about the marvellous unique<br />
quality of the body and don't force the message that early stage.<br />
Let it arise from their own stimulation which comes from that<br />
positive education. And I will be trying to ensure Ted that I<br />
see that my colleagues in the State govt have the opportunity of<br />
coming and seeing what you are doing as I think in corporation<br />
with the Statesbhat the Commonwealth should give v. considerable<br />
support to this program. I would like to congratulate you and<br />
everyone that has beei involved in the concept and work and I know<br />
it is a v. large unseen number of people behind who have made it<br />
possible. But without your inspiration it couldn't. have happened<br />
Not only do I want to congratulate you bul I thank you on behalf<br />
of the govt and the people of Australia.<br />
Q: Does that mean there will be more money going towards </p>

such things as the Life Style centres?<br />
The Life Education centres? A bit of a difference.<br />
PM: Yes I think there should be more financial assistance<br />
You can see I think from your experience that the praciticality,<br />
the relevance of it and you can see the way the kids respond and<br />
after all Ted has said, and we have tried to say in our approach<br />
to the drug education issue in this country. It is much more<br />
important tha you teach_ people abou t -the--prob-lem-and the-througheducatio<br />
n you stop the demand for drugs. You never In this sort of<br />
society going to be able to fully stop the supply. It is a v.<br />
difficult job and it is much more intelligent and rational use of<br />
resources to cut-down the demand to make people understand, the<br />
not merely the stupidity but ultimately the tragedy and the loss<br />
of life that is involved in the use of hard drugs. So it makes<br />
sense to concentrate efforts in this sort of area and I think Ted<br />
and the people around him in the life education centre concept are<br />
dmonstarting alright there's the concept education. It is<br />
easy to say there's the concept but they have translated the<br />
concept, it seems to me, into v. v. practical applications which<br />
is getting out to the kids, our young people and if you can do<br />
that over the years then we will gradually eliminate this problem.<br />
Q: You are incorporating the Life education centres into<br />
( inaudible) drug offensive?<br />
PM: Well it has already been done. ' E are providing some<br />
support the NSW govt is but what I have been saying to Ted<br />
in discussions I had with him yesterday, is that it would make<br />
a lot of sense for me to try and persuade my State Premier colleagues<br />
to come and see this because the way that this is best going to<br />
work is if we can replecate in the other States the co operation<br />
that exists here in this State between the State govt and<br />
ourselves and Ted's operation through the Life Edcuation centres.<br />
If we can get all the State govts involved financial assistance<br />
involvement from them and from ourselves then I think we can<br />
really give hard practical expression to what-people want. done.<br />
What people want is to have kids educated in the danger of drugs.<br />
And not just through the talk of the Ted Noffs or the politicans<br />
but down there by people who have talked in terms ga ' the kids<br />
know and understand. TEL No. </p>

Q: But can you guarantee, PM, more money for these centres.<br />
PM: Yes, I think there will be more financial assistance coming.<br />
You leave it to me and the way I handle it, it will be forthcoming.<br />
Q; On another subject PM, can you comment on the News Ltd<br />
takeover. PM: WE11 I have taken the view from the beginning that this is<br />
matter for the market place, the requirements of the trade practices<br />
legi-sla-tion -will-be-taken -into account, as will the proposed new<br />
legislation of the govt which is historic in terms of ensuring<br />
that we are not going to have cross media monopolization in this<br />
country..... and once those requirements are properly taken into<br />
account ( inaudible) appropriate that the market should decide this<br />
matter. That seems to be what has happened.<br />
Q: Are you happy with the way H a Court and Mr Murdoch ( inaudible)<br />
divided up?<br />
PM: Its no: a question of happiness. I mean if you are going<br />
to say-that you-havc-a -market operation then thats what has come<br />
out of thcmarket I think that perhaps it should be recognised<br />
by both of them that ( inaudible) negotiations have been conducted<br />
at an earlier stage then the price might have been better.<br />
Q: PM on another subject ( this question is totally inaudible)...<br />
PM: You see where I am now. I guess you can regafd it as something<br />
important that I am doing now. And I have made 2 of my senior<br />
officers available to meet him and if the gentleman in question<br />
is making a noise and saying it is not sufficient he should<br />
see my senior officers including my senior international affairs<br />
advisor, then 1 would suggest that if thats what he'is about<br />
he has more interest in publicity for himself than anything he<br />
purports to be concerned with.<br />
ends </p>
