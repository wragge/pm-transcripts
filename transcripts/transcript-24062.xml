    <content><![CDATA[<p>A record number of gifts has been collected under the Prime Ministerâs Wishing Tree.</p>
<p>This morning, representatives from the Salvation Army and Kmart joined me to pack over 1,000 gifts that had been donated by visitors to my office.</p>
<p>The gifts will help around 250 Australian families to celebrate Christmas.</p>
<p>By Christmas Eve, the Salvation Army is aiming to distribute 500,000 gifts to families around Australia.</p>
<p>I thank all Senators, Members of Parliament, parliamentary staff, the Press Gallery, the broader diplomatic corps in Canberra and visitors who have played a part in reaching that target.</p>
<p>The Wishing Tree will be there until Christmas Eve so thereâs still nearly two weeks to leave a gift.</p>
