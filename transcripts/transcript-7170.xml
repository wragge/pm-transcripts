EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
VICTORIAN ALP FUNDRAISER<br />
MELBOURNE 2 MAY 1987<br />
Mr Premi. er,<br />
Nancye Cain,<br />
Members of the Victorian Cabinet,<br />
Federal Cabinet colleagues,<br />
Ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It is encouraging to see such a large and distinguished<br />
audience of Melbourne's business leaders and decision makers<br />
here. tonight.<br />
Many of you I know would not Include yourselves among the<br />
traditional supporters of the Labor Party.<br />
But on an occasion such as this, the partisan differences<br />
which may separate us are less important than the<br />
fundamental concerns which bring us together.<br />
For tonight we meet on common ground. We meet with a common<br />
concern for the future of Australia and a common acceptance<br />
of the truth that only economic growth can guarantee that<br />
future. I<br />
Throughout my entire public life as trade union leader,<br />
Opposition MP and Prime Minister it has been my most<br />
deeply held conviction that the key to Australia's future<br />
lies with consultation and co-operation.<br />
That co-operative approach is not just a preferable<br />
alternative to confrontation. It is in fact a necessary<br />
element of any credible strategy to solve our economic<br />
problems. To put it another way: we have a shared destiny in this<br />
nation and that gives us a shared responsibility to work<br />
together.<br />
That was the thrust of my campaign message when I was first<br />
elected to the Prime Ministership in 1983.<br />
Ar-</p>
<p>And my message to you tonight is that in 1987 that<br />
conviction is more relevant, not less, than it was in 1983.<br />
For the nation faces a major economic challenge the need<br />
to restructure our economy so as to ensure we have the<br />
capacity to provide Jobs and income and security for our<br />
children and for their children.<br />
In the four years since we came to office I am proud that my<br />
Governmen" t has fulfilled and more than fulfilled the chief<br />
responsibility of a political party in office: to formulate<br />
and implenert the relevant and feasible policies required<br />
for economaic progress.<br />
For too long, Australia had been content to derive wealth<br />
from the export of wheat and wool and minerals.<br />
Manufacturers were content to shelter behind protectionist<br />
walls serving the small domestic market.<br />
we had too little appreciation of the pressures and<br />
opportunities of competition in the world's markets.<br />
we failed to capitalise on our enormous potential to produce<br />
manufactu 7ed goods and services for export to our region and<br />
to the world.<br />
it has been the responsibility of my Government and it has<br />
been our achievement to shift the nation away from those<br />
shortcomings towards a more realistic awareness of the<br />
challenge we face.<br />
That challenge is economic restructuring the need to build<br />
a stronger and more diverse export base. only this week<br />
John Cain, along with Bob Fordham, Rob Jolley and Steve<br />
Crabb, announced a major new effort by the Victorian<br />
Government to advance this task.<br />
The focus of the Victorian Government's efforts is just<br />
where it should be on trying to boost the export potential<br />
of the state.<br />
I don't want to take up time this evening by commenting on<br />
specific initiatives within that package.<br />
But I do want to state that the goal-of the Victorian<br />
initiative to double Victoria's exports of manufactured<br />
goods and services over the next five years is entirely<br />
compatible with the efforts of the Federal Government to<br />
restructure the economy. I congratulate the Victorian<br />
Government for that.<br />
in addition to that initiative, we are seeing other pieces<br />
of evidence that businesses, trade unions and the whole<br />
community are striving to meet the challenge of economic<br />
restructuring.<br />
Let me review that evidence briefly with you now. </p>
<p>Latest estimates of the 1986-87 current account deficit are<br />
of he order of $ 1 billion less than the Budget forecast of<br />
$ 14 billion.<br />
Moreover net exports are expected to contribute<br />
substantially more to growth than the 14 percentage points<br />
forecast at Budget time.<br />
Particularly pleasing has been the strong performance of<br />
manufacturing exports up 30 per cent so far this financial<br />
year. Tourism has also increased markedly. The net foreign<br />
deficit on travel has fallen 49 per cent.<br />
The net services deficit, which covers freight and insurance<br />
in addition to travel, has fallen by 21 per cent.<br />
Weaker than forecast consumption growth a desirable<br />
development in present circumstances has also greatly<br />
assisted this turnaround in the current account.<br />
Interpretation of the trend in the current account is likely<br />
to become mo:: e difficult over coming months as the seasonal<br />
increase in the deficit begins to inflate the monthly<br />
statistics.<br />
But the underlying improvement in the current account is now<br />
well established and is expected to continue in 1987-88.<br />
As we predicted in the last Budget, the slowing in the<br />
economy than evident was short lived. The December quarter<br />
saw a return to strong growth with an increase of 1.1 per<br />
cent in the Gross Domestic Product.<br />
In the twelve months to March employment has grown by 2.1<br />
per cent. This means a further 147,500 jobs, and it brings<br />
the total number of jobs created under my Government to<br />
760,000.<br />
More than any other statistic, the robustness of employment<br />
growth this year demonstrates the underlying strength of the<br />
economy and the success of the Government's economic<br />
policies. But I don't want to weigh you down this evening with a lot<br />
of statistics. The important point is what lies behind<br />
those figures namely, a new and absolutely vital set of<br />
attitudes which now pervades the nation.<br />
There is a dramatically increasing awareness of the need to<br />
export and, more generally, to make and market products of<br />
quality. There is an awareness of the need for continued wage<br />
restraint. I </p>
<p>There is an awareness of the need to re-examine past ways of<br />
doing things and an awareness of the need to address our<br />
industrial issues constructively.<br />
Through the Australian Made campaign, there is a growing<br />
awareness of the need to support domestic rather than<br />
imported goods though let me add there is still room for<br />
more Australian companies to adopt the green and gold<br />
kangaroo symbol to identify their products as<br />
Australian-made.<br />
Taking all these into consideration, we enter the crucial<br />
next stage in our strategy of reconstruction with cautious<br />
optimism that the economic future is brighter than the<br />
months and years we have just passed through.<br />
Building on this achievement is a task for all of us<br />
business, government, trade unions and the wider community.<br />
There should be no doubting the Federal Government's<br />
determination that the process of restructuring continues<br />
and that the gains we have already made are preserved and<br />
multiplied. Since we came to office we have exercised a restraint in our<br />
own expenditure which is unparalleled among comparable<br />
nations.<br />
When we came to office, we inherited a prospective deficit<br />
of 5 per cent of GDP. We have now wound that figure back to<br />
only 1.5 per cent of GDP.<br />
Meeting as we are in the lead-up to the May Statement, let<br />
me remind this audience that we are not about to relax our<br />
efforts. The May Statement, and the Premiers' Conference and Loan<br />
Council which iill follow, are absolutely crucial stages in<br />
the Government's continuing economic strategy.<br />
I do not want to go into details now about the decisions we<br />
have made. But I can say, as I have said on a number of<br />
occasions, that our approach will be tough. We will not be<br />
abandoning our commitment to fairness in expenditure<br />
restraint but we are determined to reduce both the Budget<br />
deficit and the total Public Sector Borrowing Requirement as<br />
a share of GDP.<br />
Spending cuts in the May Statement will be spread across a<br />
number of portfolios. The Commonwealth is looking closely<br />
at its asset holdings to effect rationalisations where<br />
prudent, but the major focus of our attention is on general<br />
recurrent outlays.<br />
There will, for example, be further measures to weed out<br />
welfare cheats and ensure that social security benefits go<br />
only to those who are entitled to them. _ II_ </p>
<p>Indeed, a more wide ranging examination of welfare outlays<br />
has been necessary, producing some measures which, in<br />
earlier times, may not have been contemplated.<br />
But we will not be wielding the knife indiscriminately.<br />
We will be seeking, as we have sought in the past, to<br />
implement durable, structural reforms which achieve budget<br />
savings bu~ t which also bring about more effective and fairer<br />
delivery of Government services.<br />
The collao~ o in our terms of trade since the end of 1984 has<br />
stripped come $ 9 billion dollars from our national economic<br />
capacity. To distribute a loss of this magnitude equitably<br />
and to maintain employment growth has been no easy task.<br />
But we have faced this task with firm resolve and we are<br />
succeeding. Ladies and cSentlemen,<br />
I began thiG evening by stating that I did not want to make<br />
a partisan speech and I will not.<br />
But I think I would be remiss if I failed to offer you some<br />
views abo~ zt the extraordinary events we have seen in the<br />
Federal Pcrliament in the last week.<br />
From ono point of view it has been an entertaining couple of<br />
days as we observe hour by hour the ever-changing line-up of<br />
faces oppoaiite us and listen hour by hour to the clash of<br />
ambitions among their many would-be and have-been leaders.<br />
But I have to state honestly, as Prime Minister of a country<br />
which still faces a serious economic challenge, that the<br />
chronic shortcomings of the Opposition are disturbing.<br />
Their basic failure has been their incapacity to develop<br />
workable and relevant economic policies a failure of<br />
profound dimensions since the area of economic management<br />
has been the area of our greatest success.<br />
The community is simply incapable of getting answers to its<br />
legitimate questions about where the alternative Government<br />
stands on the central issues in the national economic debate<br />
such as taxes, spending cuts and industrial relations.<br />
As you can imagine this disarray provided an enormous<br />
temptation to go to the voters early. It would certCainly<br />
have been a successful political move.<br />
But I made the decision not to call an early election<br />
because to do so would have been inconsistent with our<br />
long-term strategy to restructure the economy so as to<br />
promote our best chances of prosperity.<br />
That strategy means we must take the hard decisions to<br />
restructure the economy. We are taking them. </p>
<p>6.<br />
It means we muut act with fairness and compassion. We are<br />
doing that.<br />
It means we muct continue to provide strong and stable<br />
Government, for all Australians. We will continue to do<br />
that. Our strategy, finally, means we must govern for the<br />
long-term future even at the expense of copping some<br />
short-term flakl for unpopular decisions along the way. And<br />
that is what we are doing.<br />
We have a clear vision of how Australia must advance if we<br />
are to reach our goal of a more prosperous future.<br />
Every decision we take is a step towards our goal:<br />
S a restructured and a more secure Australia;<br />
S an Australia with more people working in more productive<br />
jobs and creating more wealth for the nation;<br />
an Australia with living standards on the way back up<br />
again. an Australia steadily and constructively working our way<br />
through our problems<br />
S an Australia more capable of standing on its own two<br />
feet. </p>
