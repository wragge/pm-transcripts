<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>This is a pleasant surprise. It's good to see you all. Are you all</p>
<p> well? Did you all travel well? That's very good. Now, what would you</p>
<p> like to ask me? I am here to answer any questions you want to ask</p>
<p> me. As you know I'll be delivering a speech at lunchtime to a business</p>
<p> gathering and then I'll be meeting the Foreign Minister and then the</p>
<p> Prime Minister and then the dinner tonight and after this press conference</p>
<p> I will be seeing my good friend Mr Hashimoto, the former Prime Minister.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you be raising the case of Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace with</p>
<p> Prime Minister Obuchi?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I'll mention it at every point of my overseas visit. I'll mention</p>
<p> it to the Japanese Prime Minister, I'll also mention it Mr Hashimoto</p>
<p> who has been trying behind the scenes and I'll certainly raise it</p>
<p> with President Clinton. Can I say in relation to this issue that it's</p>
<p> one of those difficult matters where sometimes the less said the better.</p>
<p> Can I assure you and assure the Australian people the Government is</p>
<p> doing everything it humanly can to bring about these men's release.</p>
<p> It's a very difficult situation. I think everybody understands that</p>
<p> in order to secure their release we have to have the goodwill of Slobodan</p>
<p> Milosevic. It's as simple as that. Now, I think having said that people</p>
<p> should understand that the prospects of securing that release do not</p>
<p> automatically go upwards with the volume of public rhetoric on the</p>
<p> subject so please we must all understand that the end game is not</p>
<p> any political point scoring along the way. The end game is to get</p>
<p> the two men reunited with their families and that's what I am on about.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you believe that if you went to Belgrade personally</p>
<p> that would help?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Mr Beazley has suggested that. Look, I will do everything that</p>
<p> on the best advice I have is most calculated to secure their release.</p>
<p> And I am not going to rule anything in or out. But it's easy to, sort</p>
<p> of, for anybody not in my position to say something on the run and</p>
<p> get a headline. But at the end of the day getting them out is the</p>
<p> best thing and I had the opportunity over the weekend to have a very</p>
<p> lengthy discussion with the Australian Ambassador in Belgrade, Chris</p>
<p> Lamb. I saw him within six hours of his return to Australia for a</p>
<p> briefing session. I saw him on Saturday, we talked about the matter</p>
<p> extensively. I am satisfied both on the basis of his direct advice</p>
<p> to me and on the basis of the advice I am receiving from the Department</p>
<p> of Foreign Affairs that Mr Downer has handled the thing correctly,</p>
<p> he's handled the thing with great commitment and skill. And as I say</p>
<p> sometimes the less said the better.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, how concerned are you about the recognition of Papua</p>
<p> New Guinea, of Taiwan and will you be discussing that today?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't think I'll be discussing it today. I don't think it's</p>
<p> something that automatically comes within the operation of the sphere</p>
<p> of our relationship.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible].Pratt and Wallace. Are you saying that if you thought</p>
<p> it would help to go to Belgrade you would?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, what I am saying is that whatever is necessary to be done to promote</p>
<p> their releases by anybody that will be done. But I don't think you</p>
<p> should take that as necessarily answering your question. Glenn, I</p>
<p> really am asking that people understand that it's a very difficult</p>
<p> situation, playing it like an ordinary political issue is not the</p>
<p> right thing to do. And that plea is made to the Opposition, it's made</p>
<p> to the media. I think by and large the media has handled this thing</p>
<p> very carefully and it's just made to everybody. I just want to get</p>
<p> the two of them out but in order to get them out you have got to get</p>
<p> on the right side of Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, would it help or hinder the two aid workers if you went</p>
<p> to Belgrade at this stage?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to answer that question.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you'll be discussing Indonesia today, there was another</p>
<p> attack on UN people in Timor yesterday. How concerned are you about</p>
<p> that?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, very concerned. And we have put some very strong views</p>
<p> and we will be putting in other ways those views again to the Indonesian</p>
<p> Government. It's difficult. I am disappointed about what has happened</p>
<p> and I would say to the Indonesian Government that it's own credibility</p>
<p> in relation to the handling of this issue is very much in the international</p>
<p> spotlight.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible].seriously enough Mr Howard? Are you getting adequate responses</p>
<p> to representations the Government is taking?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, whilever things that happened last night happen I guess that's</p>
<p> the only thing you can measure the response by. I mean, what matters</p>
<p> is what happens on the ground rather than the words that are uttered</p>
<p> in response to representations. But our Ambassador was in Dili yesterday,</p>
<p> I think, and the.Mr Downer spoke to Mr Marker in Canberra yesterday</p>
<p> and certainly everybody is going to be putting their views very strongly</p>
<p> to the Indonesian Government.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is the situation worrying enough for you to call the President, the</p>
<p> Indonesian President?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The problem with these situations is that you are asked because you</p>
<p> need to ask me something. When are you going to write the next letter</p>
<p> or make the next phone call? And sometimes the right time to write</p>
<p> the letter or make the phone call is not necessarily the time you</p>
<p> are asked whether you are going to do it. But if you don't say yes</p>
<p> it's then suggested you are not doing enough. I mean, I can't give</p>
<p> you any other answer to that. Look, once again if, whatever is needed</p>
<p> to maximise the communication of our concern that will be done.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You will be discussing with Prime Minister Obuchi today the idea of</p>
<p> the investment conference that Australia is to organise for Indonesia.</p>
<p> Do you expect also to discuss with the Prime Minister how you could</p>
<p> perhaps exercise more pressure on President Habibie over Timor?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have no doubt that we will spend a little time talking about Indonesia</p>
<p> and East Timor. It's one of a number of important issues that I intend</p>
<p> to raise with him and we'll be getting each others views on it. But</p>
<p> clearly, Japan's views are important as, of course, are ours.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What specific assurances will you be seeking from Mr Obuchi both on</p>
<p> trade and on Japan's leadership role in the region?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't think at this stage I should be, sort of, publicly declaring</p>
<p> that I'll be seeking this or that assurance. I'll have something to</p>
<p> say after I have seen him. I think it is courteous for me to see him</p>
<p> first and then..</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It's a very strong speech though you are making at lunchtime on those</p>
<p> issues. Will you..</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am glad to hear that Fran. Terrific.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you be putting things to the Prime Minister in those terms, in</p>
<p> terms of their leadership role they must take within the region?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I stand by everything I say in public.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How serious is the risk of a new protectionism?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, protectionist sentiments are around the world. When I rang President</p>
<p> Clinton to talk about Australian lamb he said that it disturbed him</p>
<p> that in a country that was doing so well economically there was a</p>
<p> rising tide of protectionism. This is the last one. Jim.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, you said before that you wouldn't be raising the issue</p>
<p> of PNG and Taiwan recognition. What however is your reaction to Bill</p>
<p> Skates' decision to recognise Taiwan?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I mean every country makes its own decision according to its</p>
<p> own circumstances. I mean our policy remains, as you know, a one China</p>
<p> policy. And consistent with that we have good commercial relations</p>
<p> with Taiwan.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What efforts has Australia put in to dissuade Port Moresby from this</p>
<p> cause of action?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am not aware that we were consulted.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>On indulgence.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible].to let Mal Colston off. Are you satisfied with that decision?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look I don't comment on the DPP's decisions. It's an independent</p>
<p> body. I mean, I didn't seek in any way to express a view nor did the</p>
<p> Government, it would have been highly improper beforehand. The DPP's</p>
<p> utterly independent. I think if people have got concerns about the</p>
<p> DPP's decision then they should ask the DPP. He is a completely independent</p>
<p> officer, totally separate from the Government. In no way is he influenced</p>
<p> by the Government nor should he. Thank you.</p>
