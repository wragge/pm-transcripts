PRIME MINISTER<br />
MACQUARIE NETWORK WEEKLY BROADCAST<br />
By the Prime MAinister, The . Rt Hon.<br />
William IMcMahon, CH, MP.<br />
NATIONAL HEALTH 19 JULY, 1972.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, you are critical of the Labor Party's National<br />
Health Scheme. Why.?<br />
PM. I can explain it fairly easily. Last week the Labor Party<br />
released an expensively produced pamphlet. It contained its<br />
own version of a National Health Scheme, and I believe it's a<br />
very revealing and cynical document. I make this accusation<br />
because this is an official Labor Party document and it is<br />
based on satire. It's main headline is borrowed from the title<br />
of a well-known satirical theatrical revue and it seems clear<br />
to me that the Opposition wants to treat this serious and<br />
vital question of national health as nothing more than a joke.<br />
Many Australians already know this flippant, unthinking approach<br />
is typical of the serious deficiencies of Labor's plan for<br />
health nationalisation. They know its policy is so shot through<br />
with contradictions that it amounts to deception. That's my<br />
view.<br />
Q. Well Sir, that only deals with the pamphlet itself. Why<br />
do you criticise the Labor Party nolicy on national health?<br />
PM. Well for a start, the Leader of the Opposition and his<br />
health expert can't agree. His own health expert has had to<br />
correct his Leader in public and to do so more than once. The<br />
Leader of the Opposition announced that families with a<br />
taxable income of less than 1,700 a year would get free health<br />
insurance. Mr. Hayden announced his Leader's figures were out<br />
of date. That was nearly two months ago. The latest Labor<br />
pamphlet is still talking about free health insurance for those<br />
earning less than $ 1,700 a year. Which one of them speaks for<br />
the Labor Party?<br />
Q. That may be so Prime Minister, but where does the<br />
Government stand on free health insurance? </p>
<p>PM. Well, we already provide free health insurance to families<br />
with an income of less than $ 2,178 a year. That means that<br />
under Labor's so-called olan to help the needy, a family at<br />
present receiving free insurance could immediately have to pay<br />
at least $ 26 a year, and it would not be tax deductible.<br />
Q. Hasn't the Labor Party announced how it's paying for its<br />
Nationalised Health Scheme?<br />
P1. Yes, but you find the same chopping and changing here. At<br />
first it was a compulsory tax of 1.25 per cent of everbody's<br />
income. Last July it was lifted to 1.3 ner cent. Now it is<br />
to be 1.35 per cent. No--one can be confident it will stop<br />
there.<br />
Q. What about hospital treatment?<br />
PM. Well the Leader of the Opposition tries to pretend his<br />
scheme will cover you in all hospital wards. His health expert<br />
had to contradict him again on this. Under Labor, the patient<br />
would be forced to pay all additional costs over and above<br />
public ward treatment, and the taxpayer will pay at least $ 168<br />
million more each year for the privilege. The present<br />
voluntary scheme allows you to insure in full for all hospital<br />
wards, intermediate and private as well.<br />
Q. Sir, there's frequent criticism that there are too many<br />
benefit organisations. How do you answer that?<br />
PM. That is another great Labor fallacy. They want to wine out<br />
overnight 82 medical and 92 hospital organisations and they<br />
want to replac6 them with one big centralised government-run<br />
show. This idea was totally rejected by the experts we<br />
appointed to examine health insurance. It would cost millions<br />
to duplicate facilities all operating now at no cost to the<br />
taxpayer. Labor wants a complete takeover of all hospitals.<br />
Such a plan, I believe, and my experts believe, will inevitably<br />
collapse.<br />
Q. Would it be right to say then that tke voluntary health<br />
insurance scheme is perfect?<br />
PM. No. The Liberal Party does not say he voluntary health<br />
insurance scheme is perfect. We do thin t is the best that's<br />
available, because our policy is to nut the interests of the<br />
patients first. The individual is of paramount importance to<br />
us, and we want to treat the patient as an individual humanbeing<br />
not a cog in a medical care machine. We believe<br />
Australians want a scheme which reflects their feelings, which<br />
treats them as people, not as computbrised episodes of illness.<br />
We also believe the patient must be personally identified with<br />
a health scheme and have some personal responsibility.<br />
We have attempted to do this by establishing the common<br />
fee system which provides for: </p>
<p>3,.<br />
Eighty cents for a surgery visit;<br />
One dollar twenty for a home visit;<br />
and five dollars for any operation or<br />
specialist procedure.<br />
We are now trying to improve this system. This year, * Mr.<br />
Justice Mason recommended increases in the common fee in New<br />
South Wales and we accepted them for all states. The increases<br />
will not be paid by the oatient but by the Government. We<br />
have a practical, working scheme. It's a pretty good one and<br />
we will improve it. Labor's policy, as you know, must destroy<br />
it! </p>
