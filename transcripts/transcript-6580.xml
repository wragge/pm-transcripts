4~ U~ 1JA&amp;<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
UNDER EMBARGO UNTIL 3. OOP. M.-1 FEBRUARY, 1985<br />
FOR MEDIA VISIT OF HU YAOBANG<br />
The General-Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party<br />
( CPC) Hu Yaobang is to pay a goodwill visit to Australia<br />
on April 13-18 at the invitation of the Australian<br />
Government. Mr Hu will be accompanied by Hu Qili, member of the<br />
Secretariat and a number of other important officials of<br />
the CPC and the Goverhment.<br />
This will be an important event in the relationship<br />
between AuStralia and China, to which the Government<br />
attaches a high priority.<br />
It will also enable a continuation of the broad-ranging<br />
discussions which I had with the Chinese leadership<br />
during my visit to China a year ago, in the course of<br />
which I met General-Secretary Hu in Shanghai.<br />
The visit will provide the opportunity for Mr Hu to see<br />
something of Australia's development abd-will give the<br />
opportunity for Australia to return the very warm<br />
hospitality which I and other Australian Ministers have<br />
been shown during visits to China.<br />
I expect that our formal discussions will focus on key<br />
issues in the international situation, as well as on the<br />
bilateral relationship, in particular, areas of joint<br />
economic interest.<br />
The issues of regional security, disarmament and arms<br />
control, and East-West relations can be expected to<br />
feature prominently. </p>
<p>2<br />
It is proposed that the General-Secretary visit Western<br />
Australia, Canberra and New South Wales<br />
in Western Australia it is envisaged that Mr Hu<br />
will have discussions with the Western Australian<br />
Government and travel to the Pilbara. I propose to<br />
accompany him during his visit to Western<br />
Australia. in Canberra Mr Hu will meet the Governor-General,<br />
and have discussions with senior Government and<br />
political leaders. He will also address the<br />
National Press Club.<br />
in Sydney Mr Ku will have discussions with the NSW<br />
Government, attend festivities organised in his<br />
honour by the Chinese community in NSW, as well as<br />
meeting some members of the Economic Planning and<br />
Advisory Council, from the business and trade union<br />
fields.<br />
General-Secretary Hu visited Japan in November, 1983.<br />
He has previously visited Yugoslavia, Romania, and North<br />
Korea. His visit to Australia is regarded by the Australian<br />
Government as of great importance and is indicative of<br />
the close and friendly relations which exist between the<br />
peoples of China and Australia.<br />
Born 1915 in Hunan Province, Ku Yaobang has been<br />
involved in the affairs of the CPC since his youth.. He<br />
was elected Head of the CPC in June 1981. In this<br />
capacity Mr Ku, along with Deng Xiaoping, Premier Zhao<br />
Ziyang and other national leaders, has played a key role<br />
in the formulation and implementation of China's<br />
modernisation policies. He is also involved in Chinese<br />
international relations. Mr Hu is married-with four<br />
children. </p>
