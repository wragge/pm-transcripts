AID TO GILBERT AND EILTICE ISLANDS<br />
Australia is to give assistance to the value of<br />
$ 450,000 to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony for the<br />
~ construction of a water supply system in the town of Betio<br />
on the Tarawa Atoll.<br />
Announcing this today, the Special Minister of<br />
State and Minister assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
Senator Willesee, said that the assistance included equipment,<br />
Spipelines, pumps and storage tanks. These materials will be<br />
supolied through the Department of Works, which will also<br />
provide an engineer tosupervise teproject. Fudfoth<br />
scheme will be taken from the GEIC's share of the current<br />
Australian $ 15 million aid pledge to the South Pacific area<br />
up to the end of 1975, and it ties in with the GEIC Administration's<br />
Three Year Development Plan which gives water supply a high<br />
priority. The town of Betio has 665 households and a ponulation<br />
of 4,600 according to the last census. With this relatively high<br />
population density and lack of adeauate sewerage facilities the<br />
water sources are subject to contamination and a piped water supply<br />
system will eliminate the currently high risk to public health. </p>
