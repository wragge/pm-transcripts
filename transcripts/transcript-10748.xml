<p> (TAPE BEGINS)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I thought it was predictable. People are feeling a sense of</p>
<p>   vulnerability, a deep sense of hurt and alienation. I understand</p>
<p>   that, and I sympathise with it. There are some things that I can</p>
<p>   do to help and there are some other things that I can't, and</p>
<p>   I endeavoured last night to deal candidly with people, to listen</p>
<p>   to their concerns, to point out where we could help as a Government,</p>
<p>   but also not to pretend that we had any magical solutions, or that</p>
<p>   any political party, Labor, Liberal or One Nation, has a magical</p>
<p>   solution because there aren't. Our society is undergoing some</p>
<p>   changes, we have to try and ease the impact of that change. We have</p>
<p>   to help people where we can, but we must also avoid the cruel deception</p>
<p>   of pretending that there are some easy solutions.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Now, your visit to the region Mr Howard, is it damage control?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No it's not damage control. I have visited regional Australia</p>
<p>   regularly over the 24 years that I have been in politics. There's</p>
<p>   nothing in the nature of damage control about it. The Queensland</p>
<p>   election result obviously has captured a lot of attention, and I</p>
<p>   am the first to acknowledge that people want full accountability</p>
<p>   from their leaders, they are entitled to put questions and criticisms</p>
<p>   to me.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So would you admit that the One Nation support has attracted this</p>
<p>   visit?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the One Nation support has obviously attracted a lot of interest</p>
<p>   around the country, but the point I make is that this is not the</p>
<p>   first time that I have visited regional Queensland. I was only a</p>
<p>   few weeks ago in the Capricornia electorate in the north of the</p>
<p>   state and a few weeks after that in Toowoomba, so I'm no stranger</p>
<p>   to regional Queensland. I've been coming to regional Queensland</p>
<p>   on a very regular basis in all the time that I've been in politics,</p>
<p>   and also since I've been Prime Minister.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Now, you've acknowledged that the country, people in the bush</p>
<p>   are hurting, what assurances can you give to those people that have</p>
<p>   expressed their concerns to you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there are some things that we can help in. Take pork industry.</p>
<p>   Late last year we had a $10 million industry reconstruction package,</p>
<p>   a few weeks ago we added another $9 to $11 million to that. Now</p>
<p>   I know that's not enough in the eyes of many people in the</p>
<p>   industry, I guess with these situations it is never quite enough,</p>
<p>   but it is evidence that we are responsive to the adjustment problems</p>
<p>   the industry has got, and the emphasis with that help has been in</p>
<p>   encouraging and supporting exports by the industry. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you going to move to put temporary quotas on pigmeat imports</p>
<p>   as suggested by the industry? They've obviously researched</p>
<p>   it and believe that it's okay to do that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>My advice to date is that it's not. But you can't do</p>
<p>   that until you've had an independent inquiry which establishes</p>
<p>   that there has been severe disruption to the industry. We have commissioned</p>
<p>   that independent inquiry. But in the light of what was put to me</p>
<p>   last night, I am going to have that advice re-examined to make absolutely</p>
<p>   certain that it is correct. But the advice that I have as of now,</p>
<p>   is that what was put to me last night is not possible under the</p>
<p>   international trading rules, and that if it were implemented it</p>
<p>   could produce retaliation against other industries. Now I am going</p>
<p>   to check that out, and I'll come back to the pork industry</p>
<p>   people who put it to me. But the advice I have at present is that</p>
<p>   you must first have an independent inquiry and then if it finds</p>
<p>   severe dislocation or damage then you could put a temporary quota</p>
<p>   or tariff on, but I've got to check that out. But that's</p>
<p>   my advice to date.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So what do you say to those farmers now, those hundreds of farmers</p>
<p>   throughout regional Australia on the brink of collapse within the</p>
<p>   pork industry?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I say that we have at both, at the end of last year and a</p>
<p>   few weeks ago, and we've put assistance in the order of $20</p>
<p>   million into the industry, I am looking at the things that were</p>
<p>   put to me last night. We believe very strongly that the future of</p>
<p>   the industry lies in a greater emphasis on exports, and much of</p>
<p>   the assistance package is to that end.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Now there has been a lot of criticism over the lack of discussion</p>
<p>   on the GST, when are you going to call for more discussion and inform</p>
<p>   the public on what you are intending to do?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we'll be releasing the taxation package soon, I'm</p>
<p>   not going to put a date on it. It won't be a GST, it will be</p>
<p>   a total reform of the system, including a broad based indirect tax</p>
<p>   or GST. We won't be putting a GST on top of the existing taxes.</p>
<p>   If we introduce a GST it will be to replace the existing wholesale</p>
<p>   sales taxes and perhaps some other indirect taxes. There'll</p>
<p>   also be reductions in personal income tax and the package in aggregate</p>
<p>   will be very beneficial to the bush and to regional Australia. Though</p>
<p>   some of the Government's critics in the bush, and particularly</p>
<p>   those who are against taxation reform such as the Labor Party and</p>
<p>   One Nation, might wait until they see the package and they will</p>
<p>   appreciate that within the package there are benefits for rural</p>
<p>   Australia which would not be available under the policies of either</p>
<p>   the Labor Party or One Nation, which have formed what I can only</p>
<p>   call in political terms an unholy alliance to stop taxation reform</p>
<p>   in Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>In what way is it going to help people in the bush?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it'll be out in the not too distant future, but one of</p>
<p>   the ways in which it will help is that if you have a GST rather</p>
<p>   than an existing wholesale tax system, you take a taxation burden</p>
<p>   off exporters, and many people in the bush are exporters, and anything</p>
<p>   that makes it easy to export from Australia will produce benefits</p>
<p>   that flow through to the Australian bush.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Now, just finally, Mr Howard, how do you intend to regain popularity</p>
<p>   in the bush?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You can never tell precisely the level of popularity or otherwise</p>
<p>   of a political party or of a government, it's a volatile thing</p>
<p>   to these days. What we intend to do is to keep very close contact</p>
<p>   with people, hear what they've got to say, where it's</p>
<p>   necessary to adjust policies and where we need, where we believe,</p>
<p>   it's desirable to do so, to adjust policies, but on the other</p>
<p>   hand not to just throw out all our policies goals just because it's</p>
<p>   seen or thought that we've had a political setback, that's</p>
<p>   not good government. </p>
<p>The best thing that I can do for the people of rural Australia</p>
<p>   is to tell it as it is, to be upfront, to hear their concerns, to</p>
<p>   be willing to assist where we can and where it is sensible to do</p>
<p>   so, but also to continue the reform push. And also to remind them</p>
<p>   of the benefits that have come from the Government. We do have lower</p>
<p>   interest rates all around Australia now as a result of the Government's</p>
<p>   policies. They are much lower than they've been for 30 or 40</p>
<p>   years and that benefits everybody and we have low inflation and</p>
<p>   those falls in interests have been worth about $400 million a year</p>
<p>   to Australian farmers. Now that has got to mean something and the</p>
<p>   situation for many of them if we had not come to power, would have</p>
<p>   been a lot worse because it is our policies that have got those</p>
<p>   interest rates down.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I apologise, I did say it was my final question, but I do have</p>
<p>   one more about the high unemployment within the Wide Bay region</p>
<p>   where you are now. It's tipping the scales at the country's</p>
<p>   worst and has for some time. What can you guarantee this region</p>
<p>   that is hurting with a high jobless rate, which is four times the</p>
<p>   national average?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We can guarantee to produce policies that help small business,</p>
<p>   that where it is possible to do so, that support the local industries.</p>
<p>   But we cannot overnight get that high unemployment rate down. There</p>
<p>   are some good things on the horizon and one of those is that the</p>
<p>   job vacancy survey that came out yesterday is the best for years.</p>
<p>   Now that's very good given that we have a bit of worries about</p>
<p>   the Asian downturn. The other thing we can do is to do everything</p>
<p>   we can to support exports. If we do things that harm exports, if</p>
<p>   we invite retaliatory action from countries to whom we export then</p>
<p>   that will affect jobs, and reduce jobs all around Australia, including</p>
<p>   in areas like Hervey Bay.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Thanks for your time Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
