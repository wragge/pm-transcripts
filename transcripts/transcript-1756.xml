FOR PRESS: JA16 1 p. M. No. 616<br />
MR LEE'S " AST OF SUEZ MISSION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Senator John Gorton<br />
The Australian Government fully supports the<br />
Prime Minister of Singapore in his attempt to persuade the British<br />
Government not to speed up withdrawal of British forces from<br />
Singapore and Malaysia. Hower er, we do not feel the actual physical<br />
presence of a senior Australian Minister, who could only arrive in<br />
London a few hours before the talks were due to begin, would add<br />
much force to the support already expressed.<br />
Mr Lee will, however, be provided by the<br />
Australian Government with a statement setting out Australian<br />
support of his objectives.<br />
CANBERRA, 11th January, 1968. </p>
