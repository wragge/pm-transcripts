, A<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 17 November 1987<br />
The Auditor-General, Mr John Monaghan, will retire from<br />
office on 31 December 1987. Mr Monaghan recently advised<br />
the Governor-General and I of his intention to retire.<br />
Mr Monaghan has served with distinction in the post for<br />
three years, and before that served with distinction as a<br />
Commissioner of the Public Service Board and in a range of<br />
other important Government posts.<br />
I have extended to him my appreciation for this<br />
distinguished service and have wished him well in his<br />
retirement.<br />
The Deputy Auditor-General, Mr Doug Hill, will act as<br />
Auditor-General from the time Mr Monaghan ceases duty until<br />
a permanent appointment is made.<br />
The position will be advertised and applications called for<br />
as soon as practicable. () OU02 OOl </p>
