David Hicks, climate change, Ian Thorpe.</p>
<p>E&amp;OE...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'll start with a comment on the David Hicks case. I am pleased that this matter has now been resolved. The bottom line will always be that he pleaded guilty to knowingly assisting a terrorist organisation, Al Qaeda. He's acknowledged that the prosecution could have proved that beyond a reasonable doubt. The matter will now proceed as outlined by the Military Commission decision. He received a sentence of seven years, it's been suspended for all but nine months, he will leave the United States within 60 days and he will receive...he will serve out the balance of his sentence in Australia and you are aware of the conditions of that. But whatever may be the rhetorical responses of some, and of particularly the Government's critics, the facts speak for themselves. He pleaded guilty to knowingly assisting a terrorist organisation, namely Al Qaeda. Any questions?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you surprised by such a short sentence?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well no, I don't express any view. I had wanted him to face justice, and the only way that could happen would be for the Military Commission hearing to take place, because it was not possible for him to be tried in Australia and I regard it as very good that the matter has now been dealt with. There is apparently no power to offset the amount of time that's he's already spent in custody, but I imagine, I don't know, but I imagine that in deciding to suspend the sentence for all but nine months the Commission took into account the fact that he'd been in captivity for five years.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it likely that he'll be released, perhaps just after the election and Green's leader Bob Brown saying that this sentence has been designed with the election in mind. How do you feel about....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is ridiculous. I mean Bob Brown of course would say that. We didn't impose the sentence, the sentence was imposed by the Military Commission and the plea bargain was worked out between the military prosecution and Mr Hicks's lawyers and the suggestion that of Senator Brown that it's got something to do with the Australian election is absurd.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But are you pleased that he'll still be in prison until after the election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm not expressing a view. I'm acknowledging the sentence and I'm pointing to the facts. I mean the facts for all time will be that he pleaded guilty to knowingly assisting Al Qaeda. Now that's an absolutely undisputed fact. It's also an undisputed fact that he's acknowledged that the prosecution could have proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Now those facts speak far louder than Senator Brown's absurd conspiracy theories about elections.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you worried that David's had to relinquish claims that he was abused by US forces and also agree to a media gag in order to....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not worried about that at all. I held the view that these were serious charges and that he ought to face those charges before the Military Commission. And I am pleased that that has happened and as a result of that process he has pleaded guilty, and he's acknowledged that he trained with Al Qaeda, he's acknowledged a whole series of facts alleged, and they are facts of which I have been aware and the Australian public has been aware for a long time, but I don't intend to examine the entrails of the decision. The decision has been made, the sentence has been delivered, he will leave Guantanamo Bay in 60 days, he will serve the residue of the sentence in Australia, there are certain conditions attached to it, I don't really intend to say much more about the matter. He's not a hero in my eyes and he oughtn't to be a hero in the eyes of any people in the Australian community.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it likely that he'll be subject to control orders upon release?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know nothing of that and I'm not aware of any such proposal.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On climate change, Kevin Rudd is calling for a Stern style report because he says we just don't have the right facts and figures. What's your response to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's very odd that he has called for a Stern report because we don't have the facts and figures, yet he's already committed himself to a target. Those two.....if we don't have the facts and figures, why has he committed a Labor government if it's elected to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent by the year 2020 and by 60 per cent by 2050? You can't have it both ways. If you need an Australian style Stern report to give us the facts, therefore you must not think you now have the facts. I ask the question, why if we don't have the facts has he committed himself to a target? I think he's making a big mistake committing himself to a target without knowing what the impact of that target would be. What Australians need on this issue is a series of practical measures which can deliver outcomes, such as our initiative concerning deforestation, such as our initiative concerning light bulbs, we need to develop the framework of an emissions trading system and see how that would relate to the rest of the world, we need to continue with our emphasis on clean coal technology, something that we laid down in the White Paper three years ago.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There's been suggestion that there could be 150 million climate refugees over the next 20 or 30 years.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we are being deluged with allegations and suggestions of doom and despair. I think it's important, as always with these things, that we take a balanced approach, we react in a measured sensible way and we react when we know what the consequences of our reaction will be. But to commit this country to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent within 13 years must do economic damage to Australia, must cost Australian jobs and I think it's irresponsible to make those commitments when you yourself admit you don't have the facts.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister FINA has stated today that it's investigating Ian Thorpe on doping allegations, are you concerned....or first of all disappointed and concerned it might tarnish Australia's swimming reputation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look I don't intend to react to and let alone endorse unsubstantiated allegations in a French newspaper. So as far as I'm concerned, until evidence to the contrary is produced, solid evidence to the contrary is produced, Ian Thorpe remains a great Australian champion. Thank you. </p>
