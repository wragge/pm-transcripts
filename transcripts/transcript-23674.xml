    <content><![CDATA[<p>I congratulate Joko Widodo on winning the Indonesian presidential election held on 9 July.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is looking forward to working closely with him.</p>
<p>The election is a significant milestone. Indonesia is the worldâs third-largest democracy. Indonesia is to be congratulated on its remarkable transition to democracy and on the conduct of the election.</p>
<p>The relationship with Indonesia is extraordinarily important to us. We share a long history of cooperation on a wide range of common interests and challenges. We enjoy a highly productive and broad-based partnership that encompasses business, education, defence, security and people-to-people links.</p>
<p>All Australians should acknowledge outgoing President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyonoâs vast contribution to his country and to our world during his two terms and ten years as president. President Yudhoyono has provided Indonesia with wise leadership and political stability, consolidating democratisation and economic growth. He remains a great friend of Australia.</p>
