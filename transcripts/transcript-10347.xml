14 May 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
RADIO INTERVIEW ALAN JONES 2UE<br />
E O E<br />
JONES: Prime Minister good morning.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good morning Alan how are you?<br />
JONES: It's one of those days when you've really got... ( inaudible) . a hundred times, right?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Indeed, but it's a good story. I mean, we inherited, my government inherited a $ 10.5 billion deficit,<br />
$ 10.5 billion, and by the end of our first three years in government we will have turned that around<br />
to a surplus of $ 1 .6 billion. Now, the most important and the first responsibility of any government<br />
economically is to get the nations books into order and quite rightly I've heard you talk repeatedly<br />
about the importance of cutting debt, encouraging savings and building for the future and of all the<br />
budgets that I have been associated with, both as Treasurer and as Prime Minister, none has more<br />
directly and profoundly addressed that fundamental challenge in this budget. I mean, the turnaround<br />
is huge. By the Year 2000 we will have almost cut in half the ratio of our total debt to the amount of<br />
wealth that we generate each year as a nation, and we are laying down a brighter future for our<br />
children by eliminating all of that debt.<br />
JONES: To be absolutely fair I think you deserve a 1000 out of<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's an enormous turnaround. $ 10 billion to $ 1.6 billion surplus in the space of three years. Now,<br />
that is a colossal achievement by my government.<br />
JONES: Right at some stage down the track that is as I understand it, in the next two years, and going down<br />
that far is a bit too far down the track, you will actually be repaying some of that debt...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We are repaying debt this year. This year we will repay $ 5 billion dollars of Mr Keating's debts.<br />
billion. So that means our interest bill will fall very sharply this year. I mean, one of the reasons why<br />
the bottom line is better than some people expected it to be is that because we are not repaying such<br />
large debts, because we've cut our debt the interest bill is lower. You see the great beauty of paying<br />
off your debts is that not only do you clear the burden on your future, but you also reduce the outlay<br />
each week, or each month or each year required to service the debt.<br />
JONES: You're going to have 15 billion in asset sales which over the next two or three yecars is going to </p>
<p>assist that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Enormously. JONES: Right and to put that into proportion for our listeners, it is anticipated according to documents that I<br />
saw that there will be a saving on interest on the national debt of approximately $ 2 billion by the<br />
Year 2000?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's right. Now, this is the direct result of things like the one-third sale of Telstra.<br />
JONES:<br />
We've got to make sure you don't spend that mind you..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we're not. I mean, Alan, we've just spent the last minute saying that we are not, because we<br />
are using it to repay debt, we are obviously not sqaundering it. We are putting it to the best of all<br />
possible uses. Now of all the privatisations, there are two sums.... one sum that's the Natural<br />
Heritage Trust, where we are putting $ 1 .2 billion into our environmental future, we told the public<br />
about that before the last election, and then we are also generating a one billion dollar Federation<br />
fund, and that Federation Fund is going to be used primarily for major infrastructure projects around<br />
Australia. The infrastructure of this country does need some attention. We do need a number of<br />
sensible large projects in Australia. That one billion dollars is not going to be squandered on a whole<br />
list of local monuments and obelisks, and let me make that clear, that is not the purpose of it. The<br />
purpose of the infrastructure fund is to create job generating, I repeat, job generating major projects<br />
and I'll be writing to the Premiers and the Chief Ministers inviting their comments. We will make the<br />
decision of course on what the money is finally spent on but that is all about building for the future.<br />
JONES: Okay well just one question on that before we get onto some of the other issues that listeners have<br />
rung about this morning. But some would say what has the Expenditure Review Committee been<br />
doing because in fact the spending cuts in the budget only total $ 783 million.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, the Economic Review Committee found savings last year which carried over into this year of<br />
$ 7 billion and of course the economic review committee also has the responsibility of vetting any<br />
new spending proposals that Ministers might bring forward which really need to be off-set by<br />
reductions in spending in other areas so that they can be afforded. But let there be no argument<br />
Alan. We will in our first three years have reduced public spending down to levels that will be close<br />
to pre-Whitlam days. According to the budget documentation last night you will have public<br />
spending levels by the turn of the century down to levels that they were in 1973. Now, there is a<br />
limit sensibly beyond which you oughtn't to go in cutting public spending because there are a lot of<br />
legitimate areas of public expenditure and it is a question of getting the balance right, getting rid of<br />
the waste but spending on the necessaries and that is what I believe that we have achieved over the<br />
last two years.<br />
JONES: Well that whole debt thing is a fantastic.. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's a terrific story because it Is about the future Alan, it is about repairing the disasters of the past.<br />
It is about repaying our debts, it is about freeing our children from the burden of debt obligations<br />
into the future.<br />
JONES: Well, let's then have a look at getting, you say, getting the priorities right. Now, this whole question<br />
which has created an awful lot of consternation today and headlines everywhere about a tax rebate.<br />
Are you saying that this rebate will be available on $ 3000 that has been saved or is it available on<br />
$ 3000 of interest in which case you'd need $ 60 000 sitting around to get $ 3000 of interest, and who<br />
the hell's got that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Alan, it was always the latter.<br />
JONES: But who's got $ 60 000 not the battler?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it is a very generous tax break. You have quite rightly called for tax incentives for savings.<br />
What you have called for is to exempt all savings from taxation. Now that is very very expensive.<br />
This when it is up and running, will cost between one and $ 1.5 billion a year.<br />
JONES: $ 2 billion by the Year 2000?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's right...<br />
JONES: You won't qualify.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Me? No, I'm not interested in it. I'm not..<br />
JONES: I'm simply saying..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
When you say I won't qualify.., just leave me out of it. It is not only in relation to interest on bank<br />
savings, it is also in relation to a personal contribution to a superannuation fund.<br />
JONES: So if you put $ 3000..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
If you put a thousand in you get a 15% tax rebate but the cap, the total amount on which the rebate<br />
can be claimed in any one year is $ 3000 and that will yield you a maximum amount of $ 450. Now, if<br />
people put... If they put a $ 1000 into Superannuation yes they will get the 15% tax rebate providing<br />
that is their own personal contribution and you haven't already claimed a tax deduction on that. </p>
<p>JONES: All right, what about rental property. If we could just go.. because this is important to people... . the<br />
net income..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The net income up to a total of $ 3000...<br />
JONES: From rental property...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
From rental property, from any kind of investment..<br />
JONES: So the toughest way of getting it actually is to have the $ 60 000 in the bank account..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's not the toughest way Alan, be fair, what we are doing is to say that any kind of investment on<br />
which you get a return or a savings up to a total return on savings of $ 3000 a year will be eligible for<br />
the 15% rebate. It is right across the board, it does not have a means test. It is available in relation<br />
to self contributions to superannuation. Now of course you can say to me well why isn't it more<br />
generous but I'm not Santa Claus. If you don't have the resources, if we are to repay the debts<br />
and lay a secure foundation for our children then we can't go overboard with this, but this is the first<br />
government since federation that has given a direct and comprehensive, across the board without<br />
strings attached, incentives for Australians to save.<br />
JONES: Right, fair enough, but without nitpicking, do you concede that there is about 40% of households<br />
out there today to whom this means nothing.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, Alan, a household that can't afford to save obviously can't take advantage of any savings<br />
measure, whether it is this measure or the most generous measure in the world. Of course you need<br />
savings in the first place but we have other measures to help those households. We've delivered<br />
reductions in housing interest rates of We gave a one billion family tax package last year, we<br />
are giving $ 600 million in health insurance tax incentives on the first of July. We are doing other<br />
things in relation to household support...<br />
JONES: A bloke faxed me this morning, he said I've just been listening to Peter Costello extolling the<br />
wonderful advantages of the budget, I'll read you exactly what he said, especially the part about ' this<br />
budget will make people want to get out there and save'. " How out of touch and stupid are these<br />
bastards? Don't they know that after the cost of living is covered on the average wage, that there is<br />
no money left to save?"<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Alan, I understand that. And I say again that no matter what savings measure you have, there is a<br />
large section of the population that doesn't qualify for it, but it is the nature of budgets that not every<br />
measure is of equal relevance to every person. Not every person in the Australian community has<br />
children but that doesn't mean to say you don't try and provide family benefits. Not every person in<br />
the community is retired, that doesn't mean you don't try and provide benefits to self funded retirees<br />
or to people on the pension. </p>
<p>JONES: Just a final one on that savings question. You do say also which many people would applaud, but all<br />
superannuation contributions and earnings after mid 1999 will be locked into super funds to prevent<br />
early withdrawals, you can't take it out.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's right.<br />
JONES: What about Mps?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
MPs are going to be affected in exactly the same way.<br />
JONES: So they won't be able to take it...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
MIPs will be affected in exactly the same way, let me repeat, MPs will be affected in exactly the same<br />
way. JONES: So they won't be able to take their superannuation until retirement?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That provision is going to apply to them as well as to the rest of the community.<br />
JONES: Do they know that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, they were told about it, so I am advised, about three or four months ago but whether they are<br />
all conscious of it or not now let me make it clear they are going to be equally affected.<br />
JONES: Right, so that whole business about taking lump sums and then going into another job, another<br />
employment and all the rest of that...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, all I'm saying Alan is that the rules are going to be the same, it is going to be across the board<br />
that preservation rule.<br />
JONES: And the age at which the Super benefits...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That is a preservation rule. That's going to be the same across the board.<br />
JONES: But the age at which Superannuation benefits can be taken is going to be raised to 60 for those born<br />
after July 1960... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
A very very long lead time.<br />
JONES: Now, another caller rang and said well now look pharmaceutical benefits. For the people out there<br />
who a pharmaceutical, a prescription is something that someone else decides you need, a<br />
professional person has decided you need it. They have to actually pay more for that pharmaceutical<br />
benefit. They are saying to me well now what about the costs of MiPs now I know you people are<br />
under siege, but they get free travel for spouses, or a nominated parent, child, or sibling each year,<br />
nine return visits to Canberra, three return visits interstate, travel to official functions, free round the<br />
world trips for members and spouses per term per term etc... Shouldn't some of those things be cut<br />
back rather than pharmaceutical benefits?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, look, can I just say that in relation to MNP's benefits generally, their incomes despite the popular<br />
view has risen at no faster rate than those in the rest of the community. I mean really this constant...<br />
it's an easy hit. You can hit me, you can hit Beazley, it is a very very easy hit. But the truth is Alan<br />
that they have risen at no faster rate than the rest of the community. You were talking a moment<br />
ago about superannuation. For all that is said about the generosity of MI~ s' superannuation scheme,<br />
your after tax compulsory contribution to a superannuation scheme as an MNP is 11%. Now, I don't<br />
think any of your listeners would be in a superannuation fuind where they are compelled to pay 11%<br />
after tax out of their income. So, when you are talking about MI~ s and you can criticise the perks<br />
that we allegedly have, I don't know that having to travel to an official function is such a perk.<br />
JONES: No, I'm talking about non-MIP functions, non-MIP benefits.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well non-MIP benefits functions, you are not meant to be subsidised..<br />
JONES: No, I mean, non-MI' benefits, nine return trips to Canberra for spouses and for...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well there are a lot of organisations Alan, including private businesses that provide their employees<br />
with family reunion facilities when they are required to work lengthy periods of time away from<br />
home. Now, we can spend valuable time talking about...<br />
JONES: But not now.. they just made the point that you..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I understand that. It is an easy thing to make.... </p>
<p>JONES: Just back to the prescriptions and on that question. I mean, that is a cost that you obviously feel you<br />
must embrace a saving. Against that, there is this deferred pension bonus of $ 21 25 1 for a single<br />
person and $ 35 450 for a couple where they defer taking their pension. Why would we be spending<br />
$ 21 million a year keeping people at 62 in employment when people at 22 can't get jobs?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, my understanding is that in the early stages of this there is actually a saving because there is a<br />
lower pension bill as people remain in the workplace longer. So in the short term there is a saving,<br />
over a longer period of time it has a cost. The principle is very good, the principle recognises that<br />
people aren't on the scrap heap at the age of 65. The principle recognises that if that we now live<br />
in an age where people thankfully are living longer, they are healthy for longer, and why shouldn't<br />
they have some encouragement? Why shouldn't they been given an incentive? I mean we are often<br />
told that one of the great driving forces in a free enterprise society is the provision of an incentive<br />
and I believe that and I'm sure you do. I'm sure most of your listeners do. And why shouldn't they<br />
be given some kind of incentive, some kind of recognition that they are able beyond the age of 65 to<br />
remain in the workforce. We should value the contribution of our older citizens to this community<br />
rather than imposing some kind of statutory senility on them.<br />
JONES: Righto, well then.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There's a very sound philosophy behind this.<br />
JONES: One and half million unemployed though aren't there? They've already got jobs.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Alan, I understand that. But you won't, but this idea that somebody at the age of 65 who stays on<br />
for another year is denying a person at the age of 19 a job completely misunderstands the character<br />
of the labour market. We don't need a job replacement policy in this country. We need a job<br />
creation approach. And the only way you create jobs is to generate more growth and this Budget<br />
forecasts very solid growth into the future. And by getting rid of debt we are laying the foundation<br />
of that very solid growth.<br />
JONES: Right, just back to the battlers though. I can go to the doctor today and get a consultation for<br />
nothing and you've heard me on this before.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I have heard you on this before.<br />
JONES: And yet the poor bloke who's depressed and goes to the doctor and he gives him a prescription for<br />
an anti-depressant drug or a blood pressure drug or a cholesterol drug, from today or from July he's<br />
going to pay more. Is it fair that he pays more and yet I pay nothing except the Medicare levy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well let's just address the drug thing. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is going at an alarming<br />
rate and we can't ignore that. It is in fact, the growth in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is<br />
faster than the growth in many of the Medicare areas. So if you're worried about the blow-out in </p>
<p>health costs, you ought to be concerned about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. And what we<br />
have done with this measure I believe is to impose a very defensible and valuable discipline on<br />
doctors in relation to the prescriptions they make. It's going to be monitored and the drugs are<br />
going to be selected and the bench marks are going to be established, not by the Government, not by<br />
the politicians, but by medical experts.<br />
JONES: But the patients..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And I notice your great interest, you talk about the battlers, but Robert Fitzgerald, the president of<br />
the Australian Council of Social Services who's normally he can be quite critical of my government<br />
and of our measures in the social welfare area, he said that in principle what we were proposing was<br />
quite defensible. He then of course to be fair went on to say that he worried about the<br />
implementation of it but he didn't argue about the principle. Now, this is a difficult area but there is<br />
plenty of evidence that money is being wasted and what we are trying to do is not play around with<br />
the quality of health care but what we are trying to do is get a much needed discipline in this area.<br />
Dr Wooldridge is meeting the Australian Medical Association in half an hour to discuss the details of<br />
the scheme. I understand that the Pharmacy Guild has given tentative support or expressed tentative<br />
understanding of what the government intends to do in the area. It is not easy this area, because it is<br />
very very simple to generate some kind of fear campaign about it but there is a lot of money that it<br />
can be saved without in anyway impairing the quality of health care and we have an obligation to the<br />
battlers you speak of, we have an obligation to all Australian taxpayers to try and do something<br />
about that.<br />
JONES: Earlier this year in January you announced $ 41.6 million or Amanda Vanstone did, to a Green Corps<br />
over the next three years to employ and give job training to young people. Where's that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Where is it? Well it is in operation.<br />
JONES: It's already started?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh yes.<br />
JONES: And it is employing people?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It Is. I in fact launched it on the outskirts of Brisbane a few weeks ago. But it is up and running.<br />
JONES: So that's in place. Just a few quick ones before we go. What provision have you put in the budget<br />
for Wik compensation? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We haven't put a specific amount because at this stage it is absolutely impossible to calculate what it<br />
will be.<br />
JONES: Could knock the bottom line around.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
On the other hand it could be quite minor.<br />
JONES: Okay. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And this is one of the ridiculous things about this whole native title issue which I am very pleased to<br />
say we have a good effective plan to deal with, it's been overwhelmingly endorsed by the partyroom.<br />
It is very very difficult to determine precisely what the final outcome will be and in any event it will<br />
be some years into the future.<br />
JONES: Okay just one final thing which we haven't got time to canvass entirely public housing. Do you<br />
think that you've addressed that issue or there is to be a new commonwealth-state housing<br />
arrangement for again battlers out there who are in public housing?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I've heard some suggestions there was some suggestion that we were going to cut $ 200<br />
million out of it because that fear campaign by the New South Wales Labor Government...<br />
JONES: We might get some details.. then I can actually tell people..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Can I say to public housing tenets ignore any fear campaign about us imposing some kind of<br />
compulsory increase in your rent, that's not happened. We have imposed what I would regard as a<br />
modest efficiency dividend of $ 50 million out of about a billion on the federal payments to the states<br />
and there is plenty of room for efficiencies in the system at a state level to absorb that without<br />
effecting a dollar of the income security of any of the housing commission tenants.<br />
JONES: Okay, well thank you for your time. I mean, at the end of the day I just wonder do you think in the<br />
light of the polls last week and all the rest of it, that the battlers who came to you, you must be<br />
worried that you might have lost them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Alan, I will never take any of the Australian people who supported me in March of last year for<br />
granted, and I know that in a political journey and a national partnership between the government<br />
and the people who elected it, there will be periods when the people who elected it scratch their head<br />
and say oh gee he's not quite doing this the way I'd like him to do it. You go through those periods,<br />
I understand that, I'm sensitive enough both as a person and as a politician to understand that and I<br />
say to your listeners that I will keep faith with your fundamental needs. This budget, the second<br />
budget of my government has addressed the fundamental debt and deficit problems of the Australian<br />
economy. It is a magnificent story that in three years, we have turned a deficit of $ 10.5 billion into a </p>
<p>surplus of $ 1 .6 billion, without increasing taxation. We've provided a family tax initiative of a billion<br />
dollars, we are giving $ 600 million in tax incentives for private health insurance, we are giving<br />
almost a $ 300 million capital gains tax relief for small business starting on the first of July. It is a fine<br />
story, I know there will be some bumps along that national journey between myself and the people<br />
who supported us but at the end of the road I believe overwhelmingly they'll see that I kept faith<br />
with the promises I made and I'm very proud to say that of all the promises that your listeners will<br />
remember from the last election : the capital gains tax promise, the family tax promise, the health<br />
insurance promise, the savings promise, the Natural Heritage Trust promise, all of those promises<br />
have been delivered and in some cases they have been over-delivered.<br />
JONES: Well, just on that, and I said we'd make this this last but there are 700 000 people we now know<br />
went to John Howard and left Paul Keating in droves because of disaffection. Do you think the<br />
disaffection was so great that they expected immediate change of a very significant nature and<br />
there's a disillusionment that that change may not have been fast enough. Alan it is always the case<br />
that when you have a big shift after another government has been in power for a long time, but there<br />
are very high expectations. Expectations that the greatest government in the world can't match.<br />
Now, I accept that there's an element in that in what's occurring at the present time. People thought<br />
that just because there was a change of government, that and that alone would deliver miracles.<br />
Now, that doesn't happen and after that is realised some people aren't quite as enthusiastic as they<br />
might originally have been but then you go into another phase where people say well okay maybe my<br />
expectations were a bit unreasonable I'll really have a serious look at what these blokes are doing.<br />
Now, I think we're now going into that phase and they will judge us on our merits and if you look at<br />
the record, I mean, we have got the fundamentals really coming into place. When you are getting<br />
massive cuts in our debt, we are getting interest rates down, we've got low inflation and that's laying<br />
the foundation for an improvement on the jobs front which is a continued concern and preoccupation<br />
of my government. Now, can I just say to people, I understand that there were very high<br />
expectations. In a sense they could never be totally realised but I also say to you that all of those<br />
great promises you remember from the campaign, they have been delivered in full on time without<br />
deduction and in some cases they have been over-delivered but I'm not complacent, I don't take you<br />
for granted, I never will. I will never get out of touch.<br />
JONES: So when will you give us an indication of when you embrace upon this awful job of tax reform.<br />
When will we hear from..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You can always rely on one thing about me and that is that in the course of being in government<br />
there will always be a few surprises.<br />
JONES: Okay we look forward to that one. Can you surprise us also on the gap on medical insurance<br />
because it would save me a million and one letters which come in and say..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Can I say we look very hard at that when we are making some of the other health insurance changes<br />
and the overwhelming view that is continually put to me that if you allow gap insurance you would<br />
produce very significant increases in doctors charges.<br />
JONES: Yes but against that if you keep the gap insurance you are not going to get people back into private<br />
health care and the public health budget... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look I understand that argument, it's a fine balance and I talk to a lot of people about this, and I<br />
talked extensively to the AMA and the overwhelming view was that the trade off wasn't worth it<br />
because okay people would find it a little more attractive to insure but the premiums would be higher<br />
because the doctors' bills would be higher and nobody would be any better off Now, we have<br />
chosen the path of giving people tax incentives, and we have also altered the community rating<br />
arrangements we're still keeping the principle of community rating so it is a lot more attractive to<br />
go into private health insurance and I think you will find as the products begin to be advertised<br />
around the first of July many young people for the first time will have a look and say gee this<br />
mightn't be a bad deal after all and I encourage them to do so because when you combine the<br />
changes with the tax incentive, it really Is a lot more attractive deal.<br />
JONES: Okay and before you go, a word to the sick and the disabled and the people who have to look after<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
This budget is a magnificent budget for carers. The last budget was good for carers and this budget<br />
increases the domiciliary nursing care benefit by a very significant amount, by about 25% and Robert<br />
Fitzgerald, once again if I can quote him, the head of ACOSS congratulated me yesterday on the fact<br />
that for the second budget in a row this had been a very compassionate one for people in care and<br />
can I say in relation to nursing homes that the reforms that were introduced last year will result in<br />
more capital going into nursing homes. They are fair, they will not surprise people who have no<br />
support of the opportunity of a nursing home bed. They will not, contrary to the scare campaign,<br />
introduce an unfair income test. What they simply do is to invite people, require people who can<br />
afford to make a contribution to their care, according to their means to do so. Now, what on earth is<br />
unfair about that?<br />
JONES: No, fair enough. Good to talk to you and thanks for your time. We'll talk again.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Thanks Alan. </p>
