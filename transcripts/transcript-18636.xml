Australia will commit $33 million to help developing countries in the Asia-Pacific sustainably manage their oceans, fisheries and coasts.</p>
<p>Speaking at a Blue Economy event co-hosted by the President of Indonesia and the Prime Minister of Grenada, the Prime Minister said that oceans were an important part of sustainable discussions here in Brazil.</p>
<p>We have a large stake in the Blue Economy. It is our livelihood and our culture.</p>
<p>Protecting the world´s oceans has been a major focus of Australia´s contribution to the Rio summit.</p>
<p>That's why we will provide up to $25 million over four years to help Pacific Island countries address illegal fishing and minimise the destruction of marine and coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Australia will also commit $8 million to the Coral Triangle Initiative to help our neighbours such as Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste protect native species and sustainably manage marine and coastal resources.</p>
<p>More than 1.5 billion people in developing countries rely on marine resources for their protein intake, and fisheries support 170 million jobs world-wide.</p>
<p>And yet these pressures impact on the people and communities that are most vulnerable, such as those in small island states.</p>
<p>Australia will also work with the World Bank to help shape its new Global Partnership on Oceans.</p>
<p>This new partnership will address threats to the health, productivity and resilience of the world's oceans.  </p>
