PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 11 MAY 1977<br />
ADDRESS AT HOBART CAMPAIGN LUNCHEON<br />
I should begin by saying something about the air conLrollers<br />
strike which has so gravely harmed Tasmania over the last<br />
weeks, the most recent of a number of irresponsible strikes<br />
that have completely disregarded the hardship that they imposed<br />
on large sections of the Australian community.<br />
A large number of people have been harmed by the air controllers<br />
strike, because of school holidays, Australians overseas who<br />
had plan., ed on returning to Australia, and the normal travelling<br />
public. The air life-lines of our nation are being stifled by a<br />
few selfish men who are trying to circumvent the accepted procedures<br />
for settling disputes in this country.'<br />
Australians are sick and tired of small, affluent and powerful<br />
minorities using industrial muscle in the attempt to impose<br />
their will on. the whole community, and this is precisely the<br />
trend which tne air controllers strike exemplifies.<br />
The air controllers make twice as much money as the average<br />
Australian and thsy are now demanding a 36% increase. Perhaps<br />
they think that this is modest compared to their initial<br />
demand of 76%.<br />
By their actions these few men are posing the most direct possible<br />
threat to the jobs of over 30,000 Australians. The Australian<br />
public will no longer tolerate a continuance of this sort of<br />
disruptive strike, and neither will the Australian Government.<br />
The air controllers strike, witn all its selfishness, with all<br />
its disregard for the interests of the overwhelming majority of<br />
other Australians, is the strongest possible argument for the<br />
Industrial Relations Bureau legislation that the Government<br />
will soon be bringing down.<br />
We are now all coming to realise that every encroachment on the<br />
well-established procLedures for settling disputes only leads to<br />
further encroachments. Powerful vested interest groups must<br />
realise that we are living in a civilised community one in<br />
which there are rights and obligations. not a jungle in which<br />
the most intransigent get their own way no matter what the uost<br />
to others. / I make </p>
<p>I make one final appeal to the air controllers. End the hardship<br />
and misery being caused to tens of thousands. Return to work and<br />
let the highest arbitral tribunal in the land assess the merits of<br />
the case.<br />
The air controllers have nothing to fear if their case has ierit,<br />
the full bench of the A--bitration Commission no doubt will recognise<br />
it. Let all parties accept the verdict of the ful. l benich, and resolve<br />
this dispute by reasoned argument, not by coercion.<br />
Any decision which is made by the full bench will be supported by the,,<br />
Government with all the powers available to it. This strike, like<br />
so many strikes in recent years, has emphasised that Tasmanian<br />
industry and Tasmanian peoplev do have special problems. Problems<br />
arising from the costliness and vulnerability of communications with<br />
other states. I can assure you that the Government is well aware of<br />
your special position, and the policies we have initiated in the<br />
first eighteen months of office amply demonstrate this awareness,<br />
Wle have decided to relocate the Antarctic division at Kingston,<br />
involving an investment of over $ 7 million and the transfer here<br />
of over one hundred permanent positions. The Secretaria'L: iof the<br />
Advisory Council on inter-governmental relations will be established<br />
in Hobart this year, emphasising our concern to protect the interests<br />
of the smaller states in our federal system.<br />
To enable Tasjmanian business to compete more favourably on interstate<br />
markets, we have introduced a freight equalisation scheme, which this<br />
year will involve a total subsidy of about $ 16. W. e have authorised<br />
the importation of four aircraft for the Tasmanian air freight trade.<br />
Two of these are for a new service to be operated by IPEC, which,<br />
subject to a High Court challange which has been made, will provide<br />
considerable extra capacity for the Bass Strait route,<br />
As a result of our concern for the unique problems of Tasmanian<br />
industry, an inquiry commenced last December under SiiL Bede Callaghan<br />
~. nto the structure of Tasmanian industry and development. I expact tc<br />
receive an interim report within-the next few weeks.<br />
Other measures which we have introducud specifically to assist<br />
Tasmania have included a grant to assist the establishment and<br />
management of the internationally acclaimed South West National Park,<br />
the payment of some $ 36 million to restore the Tasman bridge and<br />
related works, continued support for the Apple and Pear Stabilisation<br />
Scheme at a cost of over 53 million this finanicial year, and the<br />
establishment of the Australian Mlaritime College. These programmes<br />
taken together provide ample proof that the confidence which Tasmaniarns<br />
showed in us at: the last election when for the first time in memory<br />
every electorate returned a Liberal Mlember was not misplaced.<br />
I would now like to turn to the referpndums which Australian--will<br />
be voting on in ten days time. It-is important that we talk about<br />
this ' because the success of the referendums will make a major<br />
contribution to the constitutional development of our country.<br />
The foir constitutional referendums propose fair, sensible a nd just<br />
changes to reform the constitution, and I am sure they will btw<br />
successful. In the past, people have tended to vote No on<br />
constitutional questions.. Out these referendums are different.<br />
They do not seek more power for politicians. They do not seek more<br />
power for Canberra. They do not weaken the statea. These referendums<br />
meet all the requirements Australians have set for constitutional change.<br />
/ The proposals </p>
<p>-3<br />
The proposals have been carefully considered. The principles of<br />
all four referendums were adopted overwhelmingly at the Constitutional:<br />
Convention here in Hobart last year, which included representativer<br />
of the Commonwealth, all the states, local government and all the<br />
major parties. The changes are suoported on a bi-partisan basis by<br />
all the major federal parties. Each of the four proposals passed<br />
in the House of Representatives without a single dissenting voice,<br />
and all were supported by all five Tasmanian Members Michael<br />
Hodgman, Ray Groom, Bruce Goodluck, Kevin Newman and Mlax Burr.<br />
Each waas passed by an overwhelming majority in the Senate,,<br />
including support for all four proposals from Senator Brian Archer<br />
of Tasmania.<br />
Putting the four proposals forward is evidence of our concern to<br />
make necessary constitutional refurms, and of our Lsupport for the<br />
Constitutional Convention which was initiated, -and this should be<br />
emphasised, by the states.<br />
The four changes are these. First, that elections for the Senate<br />
and House of Representatives should be held.' simultaneously. It is<br />
simply common sense that elections always be hold at the same time,<br />
and that the only tire you have to vote in a federal election is<br />
when you have to choose Australia's Government. This proposal<br />
means we will not have to vote in as many federal elec'Gions.<br />
Otherwise we could have as many as four elections in the neit<br />
four years. Simultaneous elections also proter~ t the smaller states<br />
like Tasmania. When there are separate elections for the House of<br />
Representatives, political leaders will be tempted to confine their<br />
campaign to New South Wales and Victoria which have over 60% of<br />
the seats. But if there is at the samc time an election for the<br />
Senate, in which all szates are equally represented, the campaign<br />
must be extended with vigour to all states.<br />
It is sometimes said that simultaneous elections can be achieved * by<br />
bringing the House of Representatives election forward to coincide<br />
with that o'l the Senate. Unless the constitution is changed, the<br />
only way to bring the elections tcgether would be repeatedly to cut<br />
short the term of the House of Representatives. The three year term<br />
is however aLready relatively short, one of the oiiortest<br />
parliamentary terms in the democratic world. Further reducing it,<br />
would damage good government. Most importantly, this proposol will<br />
maintain and strengthen the Senate and its capacity to prctect the<br />
states. If this proposal is not passed, the future of the Senate will<br />
ultimately he put in jeopardy.<br />
It was an accident that in 1975 there were bills enabling the Governor<br />
General to dissolve both Houses and make them both face the people.<br />
Had the Senate not been able to face the people themselves, so that<br />
their actions might be judged, a nuiliber of Senators would not have<br />
agreed to block supply. This attitude was soundly based because any<br />
House of Parliament that sends another House to the polls while not<br />
itself being judged by the people, will not Curviv2. I myself woul. d<br />
never have sought the blocking of supply from a Senate that wculd not<br />
itself have also faced the people of Australia. The only way, other<br />
than double dissolution, to ensure that the Senate does face the voters<br />
is to have a normal half-Senate election, but that can only be held<br />
every third year. For two years out of every three, the Senate<br />
/ could not, </p>
<p>-4<br />
could not, even if it uanted to, face the people to explain and<br />
justify its actions, The Senate's powers are great, and anyone<br />
who uants them to remain a living reality will campaign for<br />
simultaneous elections, and vote for them on Sa-Lurday week.<br />
For, unless the present system is changed, I can foresee tuo<br />
alternative consequences. The S--nate might refuse to check a bad<br />
Government unless there happened to exist the circumstances which<br />
would permit a double dissolution. Alternatively, if Senators<br />
were to make the House of Representatives go to an election<br />
without facing the people themselvesy, then there would be a<br />
public outcry against the Senate which could lead to the Senate's<br />
powers being restricted or aboli shed. Either of these alternatives<br />
would be bad for democratic government bad for the states, bad<br />
for Australia. That is why it is important that this referendum<br />
be passed.<br />
A* No vote on May 21 is a vote for the ultimate des truction of the<br />
Senate and one of the world's best constitutions,<br />
The second referendum proposal is that whenever a Senator dies<br />
or resigns, he will be replaced, for the remainder of his term,<br />
of office, by a member of the same party. This will guarantee that<br />
your choice of parties for the Senate cannot be altered by accident<br />
or design; Under the constitution as it now stands, a Senate<br />
vacancy can completely change the party balance. It is fundamental<br />
to oui: democracy that only the people should determine the balance<br />
of the parties in the Senate. Once this proposal is accepted, the<br />
peoples choice will be preserved until they have an opportunity to<br />
make another choice at the next slection.<br />
The third referendum proposal is that voters in the Australian<br />
Capital Territory and Northorn Territory should have a vote in<br />
all futurc referendums. This is 2 fundamental right all other<br />
Australians have. I know of no rational or reasonable argument for<br />
denying Territorial vciers this basic right. Territorial voters<br />
have the same obligations as other Australians. They pay taxes,<br />
they are obliged to observe the laws of the Commonwealth, they vote<br />
for members of parliament, and the outcome of referendumns -effect<br />
them as much-as they do other Australians.<br />
The fourth and final referendum proposal is to set a retiring age<br />
for federal justices. High Court.' justices would retire at<br />
and the retirement age for other federal court Judges would be<br />
determinoed by Parliament. The proposal does not affect the telrms<br />
of judg'--s already appointed t%-oth e bench. fMost~ jobs have retirement<br />
ages, and for good reason. Judges are as affected by old age as<br />
the rest of us. It ic-only fair that after the age of<br />
responsibility should be handed over to younger people,<br />
This is even more important now that the new system of federal<br />
family courts has been set up.<br />
All four referendum proposals are fair, just, and reasonable,<br />
They meet all the requirements for success. They have been<br />
extensively considered. They have the support of all major<br />
federal parties. Thay do not involve more power for Canberra,<br />
and they will make our constitution work better. / The polls </p>
<p>5<br />
The polls show that all referendums have significant support in<br />
all states. But those people who think the referendum propositions<br />
should be passed, cannot afford to be complacent. The referendums<br />
will not pass themselves,<br />
The proposals were first put forward at the Hobart Constitutional.<br />
Convention, and in this respect the people of Hobart and Tasmania<br />
have a special responsibility to ensure their success.<br />
All people who care about constitutional and political reform in<br />
this country have a responsibility to work for the referendums.<br />
If we all do this, then the referendums will be passed, and we<br />
will have a constitution which serves Australia's needs more<br />
effectively, </p>
