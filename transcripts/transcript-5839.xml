ELECTORATE TALK<br />
This year's meeting of the ANZUS partners, which starts<br />
tomorrow inL Canberra, marks the 30th anniversary of the<br />
ANZUS Treaty. These meetings are a valuable way of focussing<br />
our perceptions of current developments in the Asia Pacific<br />
region as well as the global situation. They also remind us<br />
of the close links which exist between Australia, New Zealand<br />
and the United States.<br />
ANZUS is strongly supported by the vast majority of Australians.<br />
It has stood the test of time, and it is profoundly realistic<br />
in relation to Australia'Is strategic situation in the 19<br />
ANZUS protects Australia' s vital interests; it secures<br />
Australia's sovereignty and independence; it demonstrates our<br />
willingness to play our part in achieving security for our<br />
region. We live in an unpredictable world. Dangers can come out of<br />
apparently clear skies, as the Falklands crisis showed so<br />
plainly. If problems ever arose in our part of the world<br />
which we thought might become greater than we could master on<br />
our own account, it is the ANZUS Treaty which would stand as<br />
the guarantor of Australia's security, through the support of<br />
our alliance partners.<br />
S The ANZUS Treaty itself has two main parts. It requires its<br />
members to take action, both jointly and separately, by means<br />
of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, to<br />
maintain their individual and collective capacity to resist'<br />
armed attack. Because of this emphasis on the importance<br />
of self-help, the expectation that the other partners will<br />
join in at a time of need is clearly bound up with each party<br />
taking measures on its own behalf to maintain its own security.<br />
In the second place, ANZUS provides for the alliance partners<br />
to consult together in times of emergency, if any of them sees<br />
threats in the Pacific to their territorial integrity, their<br />
political independence or their security.<br />
The Australian Government is committed to building a strong and<br />
self-reliant defence force for Australia, designed to meet a<br />
wide range of possible contingencies in the years ahead. At the<br />
same time we are committed to firm alliance relationships,<br />
based on the closest co-operation. Australia and the United / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
States have long been involved in co-operation across a<br />
wide range of common concerns, and that is a continuing process.<br />
It is important to realize that ANZUS does not only operate<br />
in emergencies or extreme situations, it has a day to day<br />
relevance, as-the basis of a working partnership.<br />
We see the partnership at work in joint exercises in the<br />
arrangements for B-52s to stage through Darwin, and in the<br />
visits of US naval ships to our ports. There have been more than<br />
330 visits to Australian ports by US naval ships in the<br />
last 10 years. The capacity for all United States ships<br />
without distinction to come to our ports is plainly valued by<br />
the United States. It contributes to strategic deterrence<br />
and it provides the kind of support that Australia would<br />
obviously want to give to allies. We also see the day-to-day<br />
partnership at work in Australia's access to US training<br />
schemes and technology and in the agreements which successive<br />
Australian Governments have entered into with the United<br />
States on joint facilities.<br />
One of the strengths of alliances and alliance arrangements<br />
between free! countries is that their terms and pro-, isions need<br />
to be acceptable to-all parties, and in making particular<br />
arrangemE-Its on matters such as joint facilities, and B-52s<br />
staging through Darwin and conducting low level navigation.<br />
flights over northern Australia, the Government has made<br />
sure of preserving absolutely Australia's own sovereignty and<br />
independence!. I want to refer particularly to the joint facilities at Pine<br />
Gap and Nurrungar, and to the naval communications station<br />
at North-West Cape. Pine Gap and Nurrungar are joint<br />
facilities concerned with defence space research and<br />
communicatio~ ns, together they form an important component of<br />
the alliancei between Australia and the United States, and<br />
as joint facilities Australia has full access to all<br />
information passing through them.<br />
The North-West Cape Communications Station is a relay facility.<br />
It does not initiate messages, but serves as one of the many<br />
channels through which the US transmits messages to its forces.<br />
One of its functions is a part of the nuclear deterrence<br />
system. It is a way of ensuring that information could always<br />
be transmitted to submarines, even underwater, in the Indian<br />
Ocean, and t: he effective deployment of deterrence is important<br />
to Australia's security as it is to the security of all western<br />
countries. The North-West Cape facility, as a joint facility,<br />
is used by Australia to transmit messages to our ships. I for<br />
one would not have any overseas government interfering in the<br />
messages we could send. And if we would not accept that for<br />
our message: 5, how could we expect to dictate to the United<br />
States what messages it might transmit through these facilities? 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
Beyond its day-to-day relevance, ANZUS also has a wider<br />
significance, for ANZUS is an important part of the web of<br />
alliances and treaty arrangements which constitute the entire<br />
Western Alliance. In the present world environment, the<br />
western countries need to demonstrate a greater resolve and<br />
commitment than ever in order to achieve world peace and<br />
security, in order to preserve the freedom and the way of life<br />
which we want to pass to our children.<br />
A stracg, stable ANZUS has a significant role to play in<br />
demonstrating the commitment and resolve that are so<br />
necessary. As a nation, Australia stands fully behind ANZUS,<br />
in support of these objectives. oOo---</p>
