SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
NATIONAL ROAD SAFETY SYMPOSIUM,<br />
CANBERRA, 30 OCTOBER 1094<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Road safety is a matter of continuing national concern.<br />
The road toll is one of our moqt horrific social<br />
problems. In fact more Australians have been killed on our roads<br />
in the last 12 years than died on active service in<br />
World War II.<br />
Putting the same point another way, more Australians<br />
died on our roads in the first four months of 1984 than<br />
during action in both the Korean and Vietnam wars<br />
combined. These dramatic comparisons highlight starkly an<br />
appalling waste of life. The annual cost to the<br />
community has been estimated to be approximately $ 3000<br />
million. To improve road safety is a national imperative. It is<br />
a responsibility we all share.<br />
None of us can afford to ignore the human and economic<br />
cost of the tragedy being played out daily on our roads.<br />
All Australians should be getting together to put an end<br />
to this carnage.<br />
There is no room here for parochial jealousies or<br />
jurisdictional disputes. All Australians should be more<br />
conscious of the dimensions of the problem and sho. ld<br />
join together in identifying and implementing the best<br />
means of remedying it.<br />
In the-past 18 months the Government has initiated the<br />
most comprehensive overhaul ever undertaken of<br />
Australia's national transport system. This is a<br />
fundamental contribution to improved road, safety. </p>
<p>On road construction and mainteniance alone we have<br />
increased our spending by 46 per cent to a record $ 1245<br />
million. The improvements made are evident to all who travel our<br />
highways, particularly the national highway system which<br />
the Federal Government funds totally.<br />
The benefits to the economy in creating employment,<br />
providing more efficient transport services, and<br />
utlimately in saving lives and avoiding injuries are<br />
there for all to see.<br />
We also have spent $ 7 million this year specifically on<br />
road safety administration, research an~ d promotion.<br />
This I believe is an excellent investment and is but a<br />
small price to pay for effective action in this critical<br />
area.<br />
However, money alone won't solve the problem it takes<br />
much more. Uo matter how much we spend on better roads,<br />
no matter how much we spend on regulating for safer<br />
vehicles, the behaviour of the person behind the wheel<br />
or the handlebars is still the greatest problem.<br />
The message we have to get across to our fellow<br />
Australians, particularly the younger generation is:<br />
" stop killing each other".<br />
In the hands of tChe inexperienced and the impetuous, the<br />
motor vehicle can be a lethal weapon. When added to<br />
this there is the driver attitude of " she'll be right",<br />
or " it can't happen to me", then we really have cause to<br />
worry. Such attitudes must be changed. Too many Australians<br />
take the road toll for granted. They seem strangely<br />
inui~ ed to the tragedy being played out around them. We<br />
need to put an end to the grisly pattern which,<br />
regrettably, is now all too familiar.<br />
Over the past few years we have quite rightly seen a<br />
concentration on the human aspect, of road safety. The<br />
Federal and State campaigns waged successful~ ly to combat<br />
drink-driving are excellent examples.<br />
As a co nsequence of these campaigns, public attitudes to<br />
drink-driving are changing with excellent results for<br />
families. The load on our hospitals who have to<br />
repair the damage -has also been proportionately<br />
reduced. </p>
<p>But at an even more fundamental level we need to be sure<br />
our drivers know how to drive. We should be teaching<br />
our young drivers more effectively than we do at<br />
present; we should also be doina as Much as we can to<br />
maintain and develop higher levels of driving skills<br />
among those who have gained their unrestricted licence.<br />
An increasing proportion of the Government's research<br />
and promotion budget is being directed to this end.<br />
The graduated driver licensing scheme by which those<br />
under 25 progress through four stages of supervision and<br />
instruction over a two year period, has been developed<br />
and put to the States as a practical attempt to ensure<br />
that new drivers are more competent.<br />
I was pleased to see that the -South Australian<br />
Government has adopted the concept and will be<br />
implementing a pilot program next year.<br />
Government action in this field will, however, never be<br />
enough. We all have to work together, especially within<br />
the family, our schools and community groups to secure<br />
better driving standards.<br />
We need to teach our new drivers and many older ones<br />
that driving safety is much more than being able to<br />
change gears, steer, park, and perform all those<br />
physical functions in getting the vehicle from A to B.<br />
We should persuade drivers that impatience, aggression<br />
and lack of consideration on the road serve no<br />
constructive purpose and might well prove fatal to the<br />
driver himself/ or herself.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
In'wishing this symposium every' success in its<br />
examination of priorities, and in its assessment of<br />
problems, information and remedial measures, let me give<br />
you one assurance: my Government is right behind you.<br />
We are cOmmitted t'o improving the nation's roads.<br />
Better roads are safer roads and we-are spending record<br />
amount of money on this, despite very strict Budgetary<br />
constraints. We are also committed to improved vehicle standards. We<br />
have introduced a certification system which, with<br />
current streamlining and considerable investment, will<br />
ensure that our cars are as safe as any others in the<br />
world. </p>
<p>We also want t-o see Australian drivers become better<br />
drivers. Every car driver, heavy vehicle driver,<br />
motorcyclist, pedestrian and push bike rider needs to be<br />
more aware of the dangers and to be better able to use<br />
our roads without mishap.<br />
This will only happen if all of us join in a<br />
concentrated effort to make our roads safer safer for<br />
all Australians.<br />
At the national level we have shown since coming to<br />
Government, that there is a very strong community spirit<br />
which an be harnessed for the common good. We should<br />
apply this to road safety as much as we are doing to<br />
economic matters, industrial revival, restructuring and<br />
industrial disputation.<br />
All Australians have a common interest in reducing the<br />
road toll. We should be doing all we can to minimise<br />
road deaths and injuries.<br />
That is why road safety is so important.<br />
It therefore gives me great plEasure to declare this<br />
National Road-Safety Symposium officially open. </p>
