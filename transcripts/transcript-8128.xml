TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH HATSUHISA TAKASHIMA, NHK<br />
IMPERIAL HOTEL, TOKYO 17 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
TARASHIMA: Prime Minister, thank you very much f or your<br />
time. PM: My pleasure.<br />
TAXASHIMA: Firstly I'd like to ask your view on the<br />
Middle East and the Gulf situation. Australia has sent<br />
two frigates there and actively participating in the<br />
naval blockade. How effective would you see the naval<br />
blockade against Iraq is now?<br />
PM: It's very effective. Firstly there is no oil<br />
getting out of Iraq. The pipelines are closed and no<br />
tankers are getting out. So the naval blockade is very<br />
effective indeed. We trust that it will have the effect<br />
which we want it to of peacefully bringing the leadership<br />
of Iraq to its senses.<br />
TAXASHIMA: So far Saddam Hussein hasn't shown any sign<br />
of pulling out his forces from Kuwait or releasing all<br />
the hostages from his country.<br />
PM: No, to this point that is true. There hasn't been<br />
what you would expect to be a rational response to the<br />
facts. Any rational assessment should lead the<br />
leadership of Iraq to understand these things. Firstly<br />
that almost universally the world has condemned the<br />
attempt to annex Kuwait. Secondly, arnd which follows<br />
from the first, the belief that Iraqi forces should<br />
withdraw. And thirdly that the way events have developed<br />
are such that Iraq simply cannot win its objectives. I<br />
would put the fourth point which we have hoped would've<br />
been conveyed and understood by Iraq, that if the<br />
leadership of Iraq believes that they have some<br />
legitimate grievances against Kuwait, be they territorial<br />
or any other form, then there exists within the<br />
international framework mechanisms like the International<br />
Court of Justice where those grievances, if they believe<br />
they exist, can be peacefully settled.<br />
TAKASHIMA: Would you think that some additional measures<br />
would be necessary to let Saddam Hussein realise those<br />
points you have just raised? </p>
<p>PM: Well we hope that nothing more will be required.<br />
Certainly I know that rnot only is it the attitude of<br />
Australia but I know that it is the attitude for instance<br />
of the United States and of the Western European powers<br />
that they don't want to take any additional measures of<br />
force. We're all committed to a peaceful resolution of<br />
this matter. But I don't think there is very much more<br />
that the world can do to convey the messages that I have<br />
put to you as being the messages that the world wants to<br />
convey to Saddam Hussein.<br />
TAKASHIMA: This is rather hypothetical but still<br />
possible situation-that if the United Nations Security<br />
Council decides to put some more pressure against Iraq by<br />
using additional measures, then what would the Australian<br />
Government do to contribute to the additional measures?<br />
PM: We have, from the very beginning, not only made our<br />
own decisions but we have continuously expressed the view<br />
that we want to have a position where the United Nations<br />
is endorsing action that's taken. And of course<br />
Resolution 665 of the Security Council gave that sort of<br />
cover. Now being ardent supporters of the United<br />
Nations, if it were to make a decision that further<br />
action was required, Australia would be supportive of<br />
that. TAKASHIMA: Now let me turn to the Japanese contribution<br />
and your view on that. You have once mentioned the<br />
possibility of the Japanese Government sending mine<br />
sweepers to the area. Do you still have the idea, or<br />
what PM: Let me make it clear. I didn't raise the questi on<br />
of mine sweepers. There had been speculation in the<br />
media in my country and around the world, there had been<br />
some speculation that the Japanese may be thinking of<br />
that. Now I want to make these points clear. My<br />
fundamental point is that what Japan does is a matter for<br />
Japan. The second point I make is that I appreciate the<br />
significant contributions that Japan has already made<br />
two billion dollars in support for forces that have been<br />
deployed and two billion dollars in very highly<br />
concessional loans for Jordan, Egypt and Turkey and a<br />
medical team of some one hundred. Those are very<br />
significant contributions. The third point I make is<br />
that, and that I'wanted to convey to Japan, having said<br />
that their decisions are a matter for Japan, I'd simply<br />
said if, and knowing that this is a sensitive matter in<br />
Japan whether there should be any sort of military<br />
contribution, I simply said that if Japan makes the<br />
decision, were to make that decision then from<br />
Australia's point of view we would understand that. But<br />
my pre-eminent point is what Japan does is a matter for<br />
Japan. </p>
<p>my pre-eminent point is what Japan does is a matter for<br />
Japan. TAKASHIMA: You used the word understand. But is there<br />
any special sentiment within the Australian people about<br />
the Japanese involvement militarily or whatever fashion<br />
to the peacekeeping effort of that sort?<br />
PM: We understand the sensitivities . that exist within<br />
Japan on this question. We know that it is a matter of<br />
significant debate within Japan. It would be<br />
presumptuous for me as Prime Minister or the Australian<br />
people to attempt to intervene in what is<br />
quintessentially a matter for Japan. I simply want it<br />
understood that we a) believe that Japan must make its<br />
own decision, but b) we will accept and understand the<br />
decision that Japan makes. But it's very important that<br />
Japan understands that. It's not for me or for Australia<br />
to tell Japan, or attempt to tell Japan what to do.<br />
TAKASHIMA: There are some possible sequences like<br />
Cambodian peace-keeping future or near future. So do<br />
you mean that Australia would have no objection if Japan<br />
decides by itself to participate peace-keeping<br />
PM: I do mean that. I do mean that. You see Australia<br />
has had now quite a deal of experience in peace-keeping<br />
forces under the umbrella of the United Nations. Our<br />
most recent experience of course has been in Namibia. I<br />
would like to preface my answer in regard to Cambodia<br />
which you raised by saying how much we in Australia<br />
appreciate the contribution that Japan has made to the<br />
process of trying to reach a resolution of the tragedy of<br />
Cambodia. -Indeed the Tokyo meeting was an important part<br />
of that prolonged process. As you know, Australia has<br />
played a very significant role in the final process that<br />
was adopted by the Permanent Five of the United Nations.<br />
Now I have made it clear as far as Australia is concerned<br />
that, if as that implementation of that plan develops,<br />
that there will be a significant United Nations peacekeeping<br />
presence in Cambodia then Australia will play its<br />
part. If Japan makes the decision that it would wish to<br />
be part of that process, we would welcome it.<br />
TAKASHIHA: Would you raise that question during the<br />
meeting, your meeting with Prime Minister Kaifu, which is<br />
on the 20th I believe?<br />
PM: Yes, well with respect I don't want to pre-empt by<br />
public observation what I will be discussing with the<br />
Prime Minister, as you'll appreciate. He is entitled to<br />
hear from me directly whatever it is that I have to say.<br />
TAKASHIMA: The next question is a bit broader one. The<br />
Russian foreign minister, Mr Shevadnaze when he visited<br />
Vladivostock recently, proposed having an all-Asian and<br />
Pacific foreign ministers meeting in two years' time in<br />
Vladivostock to establish a new framework of security and </p>
<p>PM: I think these things need to be said. Firstly<br />
Australia has not only welcomed but has been a part of<br />
the process whereby the atmosphere and the relationships<br />
between the superpowers has changed from one of<br />
antagonism to a constructive relationship which has been<br />
important a) not only in getting that better relationship<br />
between the superpowers but b) as you'll appreciate, as<br />
being significant in assisting in the resolution of<br />
regional conflicts, for example Namibia that I referred<br />
to before. That would not have happened if it hadn't<br />
been for the relaxation of tension between the<br />
superpowers. So Australia's position has been one and<br />
will always be one-of trying to get an atmosphere of<br />
constructive negotiations. Now having said that, we<br />
welcome the attitude of the Soviet Union of saying well<br />
what we have achieved in Europe we would like to see<br />
reflected also in an improved relationship in this<br />
region. But I think it's too early to be absolutely<br />
precise about a formula. We understand, if I may so, in<br />
particular the sensitivities of Japan. You have a<br />
particular long-running issue of dispute with the Soviet<br />
Union in regard to the islands. It would be presumptuous<br />
for me to say to Japan what should be the framework<br />
within which for instance you would wish to resolve your<br />
particular issues of dispute with the Soviet Union. So I<br />
don't want at this point to put a big tick against a<br />
particular structure. But I do want to put a very big<br />
tick against the concept of constructive dialogue and<br />
discussion. But at all points as far as Australia is<br />
concerned we will be involved in discussions with our<br />
friends, including Japan, as to what our attitude should<br />
be.<br />
TAKASHIMA: About the relations between our two<br />
countries, Japan and Australia, especially in economic<br />
terms. There are several frictions and some sort of<br />
dispute of Japanese buying up Australian land and real<br />
estate and so forth. How much are you satisfied with the<br />
Japanese-Australian relations especially in economic<br />
terms? PM: Let me say generally speaking the relationship<br />
between Japan and Australia in economic and commercial<br />
terms is good. I would say probably better than it's<br />
ever been. In significant measure this has been a<br />
reflection of the liberalisation policy of Japan in<br />
regard to imports. We are now, not only in regard to our<br />
traditional area of imports but also in regard to<br />
manufactured imports there's been a significant increase.<br />
We think there are more things to be done. But the<br />
actual relationship is good and we have as a measure of<br />
the importance of our trade, it's been in the last year<br />
about $ 23 billion. So it's significant and it's<br />
improving. Now let me go specifically to the question<br />
you raise about Japanese investment in Australia. The<br />
first point I want to make is that we welcome Japanese<br />
investment in Australia. I take this opportunity on your </p>
<p>program of saying to the people of Japan that if they see<br />
expressions from Australia from some small groups of<br />
resentment and opposition, that does not represent the<br />
attitude of the Australian Government or the Australian<br />
people as a whole. We regard Japan as an important<br />
economic partner, not only a trading partner but also in<br />
the area of economic enterprise in Australia. Having<br />
said that, let me make this point, that in the last year<br />
Japanese investment in Australia was at the order of just<br />
over $ 9 billion. Now 92 per cent, 92 per cent of that<br />
investment was in real estate and tourism. Now we<br />
welcome investment in real estate and in tourism but what<br />
I want to see is a diversification of Japanese investment<br />
so that we get more investment into manufacturing. The<br />
big challenge confronting Australia is that we diversify<br />
our economy, we will continue to rely to a very large<br />
extent on our agriculture production and our exports of<br />
minerals. But we want also to get a larger manufacturing<br />
base within which science and technology based industries<br />
will become stronger. We have the position in Australia<br />
that we have a very strong scientific base but we haven't<br />
been clever and successful in commercialising, if I can<br />
put it that way, our basic research. Where we think<br />
there is great scope for increased economic co-operation<br />
is in that area. So we would like to see that<br />
diversification of Japanese investment.<br />
TAKASHIMA: Prime Minister you mentioned the<br />
diversification of Australian industry, and you<br />
specifically mentioned about the science and technology.<br />
What is actually the specific, specialised field or area<br />
of science and technology you are envisaging as a<br />
possible area in which Japan and Australia can work<br />
together? PM: I don't want to be exclusive or exhaustive. But for<br />
instance one area in which we have developed a<br />
considerable degree of expertise, as certainly has Japan,<br />
is in the area of telecommunications and information<br />
technology. So we think there is considerable scope for<br />
co-operation there. Another area is food processing<br />
which is not something that is normally associated with<br />
science and technology. But in this world today the ways<br />
in which we can most effectively add value to our basic<br />
materials is something that's important. So that would<br />
go into the areas of food and wool and textiles, those<br />
areas. I think another very important area is in the<br />
area of environmentally benign technologies and one<br />
example there is, for instance, there has been<br />
co-operation between Japan and Australia in the area of<br />
developing brown coal and getting clean coal<br />
technologies. Down in our La Trobe Valley I think now<br />
something up to about a half a billion dollars has been<br />
spent in that area. Now, increasingly in your country<br />
and mine and around the world people are going to demand<br />
more environmentally benign technologies, and I think<br />
that's an area in particular where the opportunities for<br />
co-operation between us are tremendous. </p>
<p>6<br />
TAKASHIMA: Finally, the reason why you are here is to<br />
attract Melbourne as a possible venue for the 1996<br />
Olympics. How confident are you to make the successful<br />
bid for that?<br />
PM: I'm not brash about it and we haven't come here to<br />
knock other bidders. I think that the International<br />
Olympic Committee is in the fortunate position of having<br />
a number of cities with good qualifications. I simply<br />
want to say in regard to Melbourne's bid that I think<br />
intrinsically by which I mean the quality of<br />
facilities, the centrality and co-location of facilities,<br />
the existence of all the important infrastructure of<br />
transport and communications, also the commitment of all<br />
levels of government and a sports-mad city as Melbourne<br />
is, and also in terms of security, and also in terms of a<br />
clean environment I think when you take all those<br />
intrinsics, that Melbourne has the best case. We hope<br />
that by this time tomorrow night that that's the way it<br />
will pan out. Anyway, we'll be giving it our best shot.<br />
TAKASHIMA: Thank you very much Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
ends </p>
