COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. W. McMAHON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
APPROPRIATION BILL ( No. 1) 1971-72<br />
Second Reading<br />
( Budget Debate)<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 7 September 1971]<br />
Mr McMAHON ( Lowe-Prime Minister)<br />
( 8.26)-This is the twenty-second Budget<br />
since the Liberal-Country Party Government<br />
took office in 1949. Since then we in<br />
Australia have enjoyed a period of sustained<br />
economic growth combined with full<br />
employment which has not been rivalled in<br />
any previous period of our history.<br />
Let me illustrate by reference to the<br />
progress we have made in the last decade.<br />
Ten years ago our gross national product,<br />
at constant prices was around $ 17,000m.<br />
Last year it was $ 28, OO0m-an increase of<br />
about 60 per cent or an annual rate of<br />
increase of over 5 per cent. Ten years ago<br />
our workforce was less than 44 million. It<br />
is now over 51 million-a growth of about<br />
per cent. Our international reserves<br />
have more than doubled and now stand at<br />
over $ 2.3 billion. These facts, I suggest,<br />
speak for themselves.<br />
We are, I agree, now facing problems<br />
because cost and price inflation has recently<br />
gathered pace. In the interests of the whole<br />
community, we have to tackle -these problems<br />
and tackle them now. But they need<br />
to be handled in a way which will assist,<br />
rather than impede, our long-term growth<br />
goals. And a co-operative effort is needed<br />
by every group of Australians. We have<br />
one very important economic problem that<br />
the Treasurer ( Mr Snedden) highlighted in<br />
his Budget Speech. Our over-riding<br />
economic purpose in this year's Budget was<br />
14327/ 71 to combat inflationary pressures. We are<br />
well aware that the inflationary process is<br />
most complex and that there are important<br />
elements which the Government's fiscal<br />
and monetary measures do not influence<br />
directly. Wage rates, for example, are largely a<br />
matter for the Arbitration Commission and<br />
for employer and employee relationships,<br />
although the Government can play a role<br />
by trying to ensure that the general<br />
economic climate is not conducive to the<br />
making of wage awards that exceed increases<br />
in productivity. The problem we<br />
faced in framing the Budget was therefore<br />
to try to reduce inflationary pressures in<br />
those areas where the Government can<br />
have a direct influence. As I said iin the<br />
House on 18th February, we have to<br />
distinguish between cost inflation and<br />
demand inflation. I wish that this distinction<br />
could be made abundantly clear,<br />
because of all the speeches I have heard<br />
in this House and of many of the comments<br />
I have heard too, few have been<br />
able to draw this distinction effectively.<br />
Mr Foster-Yoyu are never in the<br />
chamber to -hear speeches.<br />
Mr McMAHEON-But I listen in on the<br />
radio. In any event, I disappear the moment<br />
I see you.<br />
I pointed out then that we were not faced<br />
with overall demand inflation of the classical<br />
type, except in three areas, namely, private </p>
<p>building and construction, private investment<br />
in plant and equipment, and Government<br />
expenditure. Here there was excessive<br />
pressure on resources. In addition, more<br />
recently the strong rise in the potential for<br />
demand inflation through increased personal<br />
consumption expenditure gave us cause for<br />
concern. in circumstances where prices<br />
had already been increasing much too<br />
rapidly, we felt that it would -have been<br />
irresponsible to risk the possibility of superimposing<br />
excess demand on wage inflation.<br />
To guard against the development of undue<br />
demand pressures, we therefore judged that<br />
it was necessary to restrain the growth in<br />
Commonwealth expenditures by severely<br />
pruning departmental proposals and we decided<br />
also that we had to raise additional<br />
revenues. These are in the nature of fine<br />
tuning adjustments which must be seen in<br />
proper perspective.<br />
After allowing for the transfer of payroll<br />
tax to the States the Commonwealth's<br />
domestic outlays are estimated to increase<br />
by $ 900m in 1971-72--only $ 90m less<br />
than in 1970-71. Similarly, receipts are<br />
estimated -to increase by only about S lO0m<br />
more than last year. In technical terms-<br />
I have to emphasise the word ' technical'<br />
because it has a technical meaning-these<br />
measures imply an increase in the overall<br />
domestic surplus of $ 170m. Combined with<br />
a restrictive monetary policy I have little<br />
doubt that they have -helped considerably<br />
in reducing the risk that excess demand<br />
inflation would develop. But these measures<br />
will not in themselves prevent the continuance<br />
of the -strong overall economic<br />
growth that we have been experiencing in<br />
recent years. It is nonsense -to suggest that<br />
they will result in mass unemployment. In<br />
the normal course of events registrants for<br />
employment will rise to a seasonal peak<br />
in January of next year. With the addition<br />
of school leavers, it would not be at all<br />
surprising if unemployment exceeded<br />
100,000 at that time. That would only be<br />
slightly in excess of the numbers that were<br />
registered in January this year. I want to<br />
assure the House that we remain firmly<br />
committed -to the maintenance of full<br />
employment and -that the Government will<br />
be keeping a very close watch on trends<br />
in the private sector to see whether they<br />
develop along the lines forecast.<br />
Our concern must be to try to provide aa<br />
-economic climate in which economic growth can proceed without excessive cost<br />
and price increases. Left unchecked, the<br />
rate of price increases would soon erodc<br />
the gains we propose for pensioner and<br />
other social welfare recipients. it could also<br />
jeopardise the strong economic growth we<br />
have enjoyed in recent years. It could<br />
threaten our export industries. It could limit<br />
-our -ability to improve the quality of life<br />
in Australia. In the final analysis, of course,<br />
the prospects for controlling inflation will<br />
be affected, as I have already said, by<br />
community attitudes-not by any single<br />
group in the community, but by the coinmunity<br />
as a whole. Recent experience<br />
overseas suggests -that once a cost-, price<br />
spiral is permitted to get a foothold in an<br />
economy, the measures then required to<br />
combat it successfully are very difficult<br />
to devise and decidedly less palatable than<br />
those contained in this Budget. Our aim<br />
is to prevent such a development in this<br />
country. Till now I have referred mainly to<br />
measures aimed at demand control. But<br />
it is wrong to suggest that -the Government<br />
has ignored the problems of cost pressures.<br />
The Treasurer referred -to a variety of<br />
measures which are being taken outside the<br />
immediate Budget context -and which arc<br />
aimed at reducing these pressures. It should<br />
however be recognised that the full year<br />
effects of wage and other cost increases<br />
which took place during 1970-71 will continue<br />
to be reflected in the economy for<br />
some time. The levels of -average weekly<br />
earnings and the consumer price index,<br />
for example, are already considerably<br />
above their average levels in 1970-71. This<br />
undoubtedly will be reflected in statistics<br />
during the remainder of 1971-72, no matter<br />
how effective the Budget and the Government's<br />
other measures may be in containing<br />
future cost increases.<br />
Now let us speculate about what the<br />
Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam)<br />
and his colleagues might do to solve the<br />
problem. The Leader of the Opposition<br />
says he notes many things which are not<br />
causes of inflation. He says that wage increases<br />
are not the cause of inflation. I will<br />
refer to these in a moment. He also says:<br />
Great sectors of our secondary industry have<br />
not contributed to inflation.<br />
The rural sector is not contributing to<br />
inflation; and clearly he believes that<br />
Government spending is not the cause, since </p>
<p>he wants the Government to spend much<br />
more on a whole range of projects. Moreover,<br />
as company incomes increased very<br />
little in the last financial year, presumably<br />
he does not find the cause of inflation in<br />
that area. What then is the cause in his<br />
view? It is important that not only we<br />
but all members of the Australian public<br />
should know. Having excluded so much,<br />
he leaves us in the dark as to what his<br />
analysis is and what the real causes might<br />
be. The Leader of the Opposition does, it<br />
is true, give us a most significant hint as<br />
to his views when he accuses the Government<br />
of refusing to acknowledge-and here<br />
I quote his own words-' the inevitable connection<br />
between rising prices and demands<br />
for increased wages.'<br />
I repeat his words ' The inevitable connection<br />
between rising prices and demands<br />
for increased wages'. Does this mean that<br />
after all, he accepts wage increases as a<br />
cause of inflation? The words may be<br />
ambiguous. He is strangely silent. I accept<br />
his silence as meaning that he does accept<br />
wage increases as the cause. The fact is,<br />
of course, that wage and salary earners<br />
have increased their share of gross national<br />
product. In 1970-71, wages, salaries and<br />
supplements accounted for nearly 55 per<br />
cent of gross national product; much above<br />
the proportion in 1969-70, when it was<br />
52.4 per cent, and in other recent years.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition refers also<br />
to ' half an income-price policy' under which<br />
be suggests the Arbitration Commission has<br />
the job of keeping wages and prices down.<br />
He should know, as a once potential lawyer.<br />
that the Arbitration Commission has power<br />
to set only minimum wage rates which in<br />
peither theory nor practicei amounts to<br />
setting actua3 wage rates. This is reflected<br />
in the fact that average weekly earnings<br />
have consistently increased much faster<br />
than award rates; for example, in the year<br />
to the June quarter 1971 by over 13 per<br />
cen~ t as against 9 per cent in the corresponding<br />
period last year. The truth is that the<br />
Leader of the Opposition is unable to provide<br />
any analysis of the causes of inflation.<br />
Not unexpectedly he is therefore completely<br />
silent on the crucial question of what should<br />
be done to control it. We do know that<br />
he criticises the Government for not spending<br />
enough. In almost the same breath he<br />
complains that the burden of taxation ' s too high. He cannot have it both ways. So<br />
we are left to the conclusion that Mr<br />
Whitlam's cure for inflation is to increase<br />
Government spending and to reduce taxation.<br />
This is just the kind of cure we must<br />
avoid if we are to make any kind of attempt<br />
to cure inflation. As I have said, it is the<br />
Government's firm belief that the only<br />
responsible course of action was to bring<br />
down a Budget designed to prevent the<br />
development of excessive demand inflation,<br />
superimposing itself on the existing cost<br />
inflation. I make it clear that our policy<br />
continues to be a flexible one, responsive<br />
to change and able to make adjustments<br />
needed to sustain full employmeot and<br />
economic growth. It is, of course, entirely<br />
possible to adopt a less restrictive monetary<br />
and fiscal policy if circumstances make that<br />
necessary. Mr Deputy Speaker, I want now to<br />
emphasise another important aspect of our<br />
policy. We have been able to take positive<br />
action to meet the various high priority<br />
needs of the community, despite the need<br />
to restrain Government expenditure to combat<br />
inflationary pressures. The Budget in<br />
fact provides for substantial increases in<br />
social welfare, defence, education and the<br />
arts, assistance to rural industries, and other<br />
areas of essential activity. The responsible<br />
Ministers will explain in detail those parts<br />
of the Budget which involve their own<br />
portfolios. But let me just mention social<br />
welfare as one example. Reference has been<br />
made to a fundamental reappraisal of social<br />
services which I said the Government would<br />
undertake. The Government looked at<br />
various possible measures in the social welfare<br />
field. We decided, as I shall outline<br />
in a moment, to take action in the areas<br />
of greatest need. If the Opposition wants to<br />
say that this policy was wrong and that it<br />
does not believe that those in the greatest<br />
need should receive the greatest assistance,<br />
it is up to -the Opposition to tell the Government<br />
and up to it to make it positive to<br />
the Australian people. It is all very well<br />
for the Leader of the Opposition to say<br />
glibly that the cost of paying pensions to<br />
all Australians would be no more than<br />
S300m. The fact is that, on the basis of<br />
present eligibility for age pensions, the cost<br />
would be about $ 440m. Now where would<br />
that money come from? Where did he get<br />
his figures from? What taxes would the<br />
Leader of the Opposition increase? Until </p>
<p>these questions are answered one must<br />
regard any propositions put by the Leader<br />
of the Opposition with extreme doubt.<br />
Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, my<br />
Government has acted responsibly by<br />
matching its welfare programme to what we<br />
have judged can reasonably be raised from<br />
taxation and other revenue sources. Frankly,<br />
Sir, I di d not think that we could increase<br />
revenue at all other than in the way in<br />
which we have done so. I did not want<br />
to touch to any extent, and neither did my<br />
colleague the Treasurer, indirect taxes which<br />
could clearly write themselves into the consumer<br />
price index. I repeat: We have helped<br />
where we thought the need or poverty was<br />
greatest. The increase of S$ 1.25 in the standard rate<br />
of pension and of S1 for each married<br />
pensioner provides a substantial improvement<br />
in the purchasing power of recipients.<br />
Taken with increases which were made<br />
last year and in April this year, there has<br />
been an increase of about 11 per cent in<br />
both pension rates since September 1970.<br />
The consumer price index rose by about 5<br />
per cent in the year to June 1971. Therefore,<br />
there is a pretty healthy margin of<br />
approximately 6 per cent that can improve<br />
the real standards of the pensioners themselves.<br />
So clearly, I think, we can take it<br />
that those most in need have received the<br />
benefits and they have received considerable<br />
gains. A further most significant measure was<br />
the increases granted in the additional<br />
pensions payable where a pensioner has<br />
dependent children. In addition, we have<br />
increased child endowment by 50c a week<br />
for each child under the age of 16 in<br />
excess of 2 in a family. These increases in<br />
pensions, child endowment and other social<br />
welfare and repatriatiori benefits should<br />
ensure a welcome improvement in the<br />
standard of living of those dependent on<br />
them, even after allowing for the faster rate<br />
of price rises. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have<br />
pledged my Government to do all within<br />
its power to eliminate pockets of poverty.<br />
This is and will remain our humanitarian<br />
aim. Our concern for the needy is<br />
unqualified. We will continue to keep<br />
measures to increase our help constantly<br />
under review.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition has moved<br />
to condemn the Budget on the ground that it contains no proposals to balance the<br />
finances and functions of the Commonwealth,<br />
States and local government.<br />
Obviously, the Leader of the Opposition,<br />
could not have written the speech. Obviously<br />
he could not have been guided by<br />
any person with a knowledge of the contents<br />
of the Budegt itself. The fact is that this<br />
Budget recognises the undertaking I gave<br />
when I came to office that I would give<br />
priority to making sure that the Federal<br />
system worked effectively. My two conferences<br />
with the Premiers in Canberra have<br />
resulted in a significant improvement in the<br />
States' financial capacity. First, my col,~<br />
leagues and I reached agreement with the<br />
States on a growth tax which is theirs to<br />
levy and which will give them an important<br />
addition to their revenue raising resources.<br />
Second, on top of the normal grants that<br />
they will receive under the -improved<br />
financial arrangements settled last year, we<br />
have provided special assistance of<br />
to help the States cope with their 1971-72<br />
Budgets. Third, while recognising the need<br />
to restrain the growth in capital spending<br />
by governments, we agree to support a<br />
substantial increase in the funds available<br />
to the States for expenditure on capital<br />
works. Fourth, in transferring payroll tax<br />
to the States, we agreed to meet the cost<br />
of exempting local authorities from the<br />
tax where it applies to their non-business<br />
activities-a move which has been widely<br />
welcomed by local government authorities<br />
throughout Australia. I now ask the question:<br />
How many members of the Opposition<br />
know of the amount of funds that<br />
have been made available to local government<br />
authorities? if they do know, why<br />
have they not referred to it in any one of<br />
their speeches? Certainly, the Leader of the<br />
Opposition did * not appear to have any<br />
knowledge of this innovation or the extent<br />
of it. The Government has taken these<br />
steps to improve the financial capacity of<br />
the States and their authorities. We did so<br />
because we recognise the important responsibilities<br />
which they have in providing basic<br />
services to the citizens of this country. The<br />
Labor Party, as we all know-this side and<br />
the other side-gives lip service to the role<br />
of the States. But we all know that what<br />
it would like to do is to take over the<br />
services provided by the States and run<br />
them from Canberra and to abolish the<br />
States if it had the constitutional capacity </p>
<p>to do so. We believe, however, in a cooperative<br />
federalism, in which full recognition<br />
is given to the role of the States in<br />
providing the educational, housing, health<br />
and other facilities that are so important<br />
in improving the quality of life. ( Extension<br />
of time panted.)<br />
The plain fact is that nearly $ 3, OO0m, or<br />
over one-third of this year's Budget, has<br />
been set aside to assist the States in providing<br />
these facilities. Portion of this assistance<br />
takes the form of grants for specific<br />
purposes, but some $ 2,300m is available to<br />
the States for expenditure as they see fit.<br />
To suggest that this Budget excludes all<br />
mention of cities completely overlooks the<br />
fact that the major portion of this assistance<br />
would be expended by State governments<br />
in their cities. The Commonwealth<br />
recognises that State governments are being<br />
faced with demands for improvements in<br />
every field of their activity. With our help,<br />
an increasing proportion of national<br />
resources is being devoted to the provision<br />
of Government services in the State and<br />
local sectors. It is inportant, too, to bear<br />
in mind, however, that the resources of the<br />
community drawn upon by all the government<br />
instrumentalities that service the<br />
community are necessarily limited. Just as<br />
we have had to limit spending in fields of<br />
Commonwealth responsibility, so too are<br />
there limits to the assistance we can pro,-<br />
vide to the States to improve their services.<br />
But there is no doubt, Mr Deputy Speaker,<br />
that the increased financial capacity of the<br />
States will do much to help improve the<br />
quality of Australian life. So, too, will the<br />
action which the Commonwealth is taking<br />
directly in many fields. 1 ' have already<br />
mentioned our social welfare programme.<br />
We are also making substantial contri-butions<br />
to Aboriginal welfare, -to education and the ' arts, and we have established a<br />
department whose functions include examination<br />
of environmental problems. All this<br />
is part of our effort to give national leadership<br />
and secure national unity.<br />
Mr Deputy Speaker, this Budget is a<br />
positive one. It is a Budget which will help<br />
us achieve our great national aims of economic'<br />
strength and prosperity, social welfare,<br />
and security. It will oontribute to a<br />
general improvement in the quality of life.<br />
There are some people who seem blind<br />
to our economic progress, and the real<br />
nature of our problems. They relish playing<br />
the role of prophets of gloom. Some<br />
talk of a stagnant economy. Some see<br />
unemployment rising in an uncontrolled<br />
way. The Leader of the Opposition professes<br />
to see the Budget as a divisive political<br />
exercise. People who talk in this way<br />
seem to be mesmerised by the immediate<br />
problems of the day. It is true that some<br />
of these problems-such as the current<br />
problem of inflation-have to be taken<br />
very seriously and solutions have to ' be<br />
found for them. But such problems should<br />
be kept in proper perspective. It is nonsense<br />
to suggest that mass unemployment<br />
is just around the corner. Our record in<br />
maintaining full employment is second to<br />
no other country in the world. We have a<br />
strong economy; an economy with enormous<br />
and exciting potentialities for future<br />
growth; providing only we act responsibly.<br />
People who suppress or distort these facts<br />
do no service to Australia. The sooner we<br />
learn to ignore them the better it will be<br />
for the development and prosperity of this<br />
country and the better we will be able to<br />
do for every single class of Australian<br />
citizen.<br />
