    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce Regional Partnerships program funding of $264,000 to upgrade and expand the Karuah Community Hub and its facilities.</p>
<p>The money will assist Port Stephens Council to renovate the existing hall for multi-purpose use, and also to construct a new building to expand the current pre-school. </p>
<p>This project will address community needs by providing facilities for numerous community groups and also access to a range of outreach health services such as breast cancer screening, drug and alcohol support, immunisation, parenting classes and speech pathology.</p>
<p>The hall will be extending its access from three to five days a week for use by the community including the local pre-school, which will also be expanded to provide additional capacity. </p>
<p>I congratulate the local community for working together to access Regional Partnerships program funding and particularly thank the Hunter Area Consultative Committee for helping to bring this project to fruition. </p>
<p>I would also like to acknowledge the financial support provided by NSW Dept Community Services, Karuah Preschool and Karuah 335B Hall Committee. </p>
<p>The Regional Partnerships program continues the Australian Government's approach of working with local communities to support their ideas, to generate economic activity and improved social amenity.  </p>
