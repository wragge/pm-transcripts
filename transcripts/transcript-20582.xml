    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was saddened to learn of the death of President Bernard Dowiyogo of Nauru on the 9th of March after heart surgery in the United States.</p>
<p> Nauru faces many challenges at present, and the loss of their President will be an especially heavy blow for such a small community.</p>
<p>Australia and Nauru have cooperated closely in recent years to improve Nauru's economic circumstances and to combat the threat posed to our region by illegal people smuggling. While he had been in office for only a short while, I welcomed the President's commitment to our cooperative effort.</p>
<p> I would like to extend my condolences, and those of the Australian Government and people, to the Acting President, the Hon Derog Gioura MP, and the people of Nauru, at this sad time.</p>
