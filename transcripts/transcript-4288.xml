JASRLIAL<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
ROYAL COMMISSION ON AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION 9TH DECEMBER, 1976.<br />
The Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration,<br />
under the chairmanship of Dr. H. C. Coombs, presented its report<br />
in July of this year.<br />
In announcing the submission of the report at that time, I said<br />
that the Government would study carefully and give thorough<br />
consideration to the recommendations made by the Commiss~ ion on<br />
the principles for more efficient administration. The necessary<br />
machinery has since been established for this purpose arid<br />
decisions on recommendations will be announced progressively.<br />
For purposes of our examination of the Commission's report, the<br />
Government decided that its recommendations could be grouped in<br />
five main categories on the following basis:<br />
matters requiring Cabinet consideration, by reason of their<br />
implications or the likelihood of legislation being; required<br />
if they were to be implemented<br />
matters which relate to the subject matter of other inquiries,<br />
and which will need to be taken into account in the Government's<br />
consideration of the reports of those inquiries<br />
matters relating to the allocation of functions among<br />
ministries and to possible changes in administrative<br />
arrangements matters having implications for particular Ministers and<br />
Departments matters having implications for most or all Ministers and<br />
Departments, or requiring follow-up by the Public Service<br />
Board.<br />
Action has been put in train in relation to each of the five<br />
categories. In particular, I have asked that Ministers let me<br />
have their views on the Commission's recommendations which have<br />
both specific and general relevance to departments and authorities<br />
under their control. I have also suggested that their consideration<br />
of the Commission's report could be regarded as a useful starting<br />
point for a wide-ranging examination of the efficiency and<br />
effectiveness of administrative procedures. 2/ </p>
<p>In response to my request, the Public Service Board has completed<br />
its initial examination of the matters specifically referred to<br />
it and I will shortly be announcing the nature of the further<br />
actior~ which it has in mind.<br />
The Government has now taken initial decisions on a number of the<br />
Royal Commission's recommendations.<br />
The Government has approved in principle the Commission's<br />
recommendations for implementation of a system of efficiency<br />
audits. officials have been asked to report on the details of<br />
how such a system might be implemented. The Government has also<br />
agreed that the Public Service Board should continue its management<br />
improvement functions, including efficiency and staff utilisation<br />
reviews, in general accordance with its present responsibilities<br />
under the Public Service Act.<br />
The Government has also noted the particular significance which<br />
the Royal Commission attached to integrated forward estimates of<br />
both financial and manpower requirements. In this regard, I mention<br />
that the Government has previously agreed with proposals by the<br />
Treasurer that forward financial estimates should be collected<br />
for the three years 1977-78 to 1979-80. The development of the<br />
Department of Finance will enable these to be pursued with great<br />
vigour. The Public Service Board has also been progressively<br />
developing a comprehensive system of forward manpower stimates.<br />
Whilst noting the complexity surrounding many of the i-, sues<br />
involved, and the Commission's view that development of a<br />
satisfactory process might take several years, the Government<br />
has decided that action should proceed immediately for detailed<br />
examination and report on the Commission' s proposals.<br />
A number of other decisions taken by the Government will, I<br />
am sure, be of interest to public service staff organisations.<br />
In particular: We have authorised the Public Service Board to commence<br />
discussions with staff organisation, departments and<br />
statutory authorities, and in Joint Council ( the joint<br />
consultative body presently operating under the Public<br />
Service Act) and to report to me on the manner in which<br />
the Royal Commission's recommendations both for expanding<br />
the jurisdiction of the Joint Council, and for creating<br />
consultative councils within departments and authorities,<br />
might be implemented.<br />
Approval has been given for drafting to continue on<br />
legislation to give effect to changes in the disciplinary<br />
provisions of the Public Service Act, in accordance with<br />
recommendations which resulted from a review of those<br />
provisions by the Public Service Board, in conjunction with<br />
the Joint Council. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
The Public Service Board has been asked to report t~ o me<br />
as soon as possible on a number of Royal Commission.<br />
recommendations relating to promotion processes in the<br />
Australian Public Service, after consideration of those<br />
matters has been finalised in the Joint Council and after<br />
the Board has completed all necessary consultations; with<br />
staff organisation. The Government strongly supports<br />
the Commission's recommendations on promotion by metrit.<br />
The Government has agreed that the Public Service Act should<br />
be amended at an appropriate time to abolish the present<br />
restriction on the annual intake of non-specialist graduate<br />
recruits into the Australian Public Service.<br />
The Government has endorsed the view of the Public Service Board<br />
that the present distinctions between the Third and Fourth<br />
Divisions of the Public Service were becoming increasingly<br />
irrelevant and the Board has been asked to consult with staff<br />
organisations on possible changes in the divisional structure<br />
and to report to the Government.<br />
The Board has also been asked to consult with staff<br />
organisations on the possible elimination of inappropriate<br />
distinctions between permanent officers and temporary<br />
employees in thepresent employment arrangements under the<br />
Public Service Act and to report to the Government.<br />
The Board has also been asked to continue its detailed<br />
examination of the desirability of developing arrangements<br />
under which the whole or much of Commonwealth Government<br />
civilian employment would be treated as one entity for a<br />
number of purposes.<br />
The Government has also accepted the Royal Commission's recommendation<br />
that a practice should be established permitting the Leader of the<br />
Opposition, before a general election, to confer with the Public<br />
Service Board and the Secretary to the Department of the Prime<br />
Minister and Cabinet, and permitting shadow Ministers to confer with<br />
the heads of relevant departments. Guidelines have been developed<br />
covering the conduct of these discussions and I have informed the<br />
Honourable the Leader of the Opposition of them. I seek leave to<br />
have the guidelines incorporated in Hansard.<br />
The Government has also accepted the Royal Commissio~ s<br />
recommendations that there should be guidelines governing the<br />
briefing of Members and Party Committees by Public Servants and the<br />
handling of requests for inf ' ormation by Members of Par' -iament to<br />
departments and authorities. The Government has endorsed draft<br />
guidelines for these matters and I have referred them to Members<br />
of the Government Parties. I am writing to the Honourable the<br />
Leader of the opposition informing him of the guidelines endorsed so<br />
that he may do likewise with Members of his Party. I Seek leave to<br />
have these guidelines also incorporated in Hansard. 4/ </p>
<p>-4-<br />
In response to the Royal Commission's suggestion that<br />
greater attention is required to theprovision of more<br />
realistic objectives for staff training and development<br />
activities, the Government has decided that all departments<br />
should be asked to review their overall arrangements in these<br />
areas. In the light of those reviews, the Public Service<br />
Board has been asked to review the nature of its own role<br />
in relationt o training and personnel development matters and<br />
to report its findings to the Governemnt by mid 1977.<br />
The Government did not take up the Commission's recommendation<br />
that the special statutory provisions for the appointment of<br />
ex-servicemen in Section 47A of the Public Service Act be not<br />
re-enacted when the Act is amended. We do not believe that there<br />
should be any suggestion of a lessening of the Government's<br />
special concern for veterans who served their country.<br />
I </p>
<p>The Government has noted that the Commission highlighted the<br />
proliferation of Commonwealth statutory authorities, particularly<br />
in recent years. For its part, my Government endorses the<br />
Commission' s conclusion in favour of adopting the departmental<br />
form of organisation for government agencies unless a clear necessity<br />
can be demonstrated for the functions concerned to be carried out<br />
by a body which is wholly, or in some desired way, separate from<br />
ministerial and departmental administration. In conformity with<br />
this approach, we have decided that formulation of broad guidelines<br />
for the creation of statutory authorities would be<br />
desirable. Accordingly, a working party of officials is to be<br />
established to prepare a guideline document as soon as possible<br />
for the Government's consideration. We would expect that the<br />
guidelines ultimately approved by the Government would boe<br />
applied not only in circumstances where creation of a new<br />
statutory authority was being proposed, but also for purposes<br />
of assessing whether existing statutory bodies continued to<br />
satisfy the guideline criteria. This would not pre-clude Ministers<br />
from proposing particular structural arrangements where they<br />
felt there were worthwhile advantages to be gained.<br />
As reflected in the terms of the decisions which I have now<br />
announced, my Government is conscious of the need for consultation<br />
with staff organisation on matters arising from the Royal Commission'<br />
s recommendations which have major industrial rElations<br />
implications. Such consultation will take place with the<br />
peak councils of the staff organisations and with other bodies<br />
as appropriate.<br />
Legislation introduced recently on appointment of Permanent<br />
Heads of Public Service departments and on early retirement,<br />
followed the Government's acceptance of the main thrust of the<br />
Commission's recommendations on these matters.<br />
Because of the wide-ranging terms of reference of the Royal<br />
Commission it was obviously not in a position to prepare<br />
detailed implementation plans for its recommendations. I<br />
believe that we have made substantial progress in our initial<br />
examination of the report and have set in train work to prepare<br />
such detailed plans. I have no doubt that, when implemented,<br />
these reforms will lead to a more efficient administration<br />
a matter which should be of concern to all Australians. </p>
