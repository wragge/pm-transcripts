PM No. 62/ 1971<br />
FOR PRESS: OUTCOME OF THE PREMIERS' CONFERENCE, JUE-1971<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. WILLIAM McMAHON<br />
Like the Conference in April the discussion at today's<br />
Premiers' Conference was both frank and extremely fruitful.<br />
In my opening statement to the Conference ( copies of which<br />
have been circulated) I said that the Commonwealth accepted the<br />
States' need for some greater flexibility and freedom in revenue<br />
raising. However, the constitutional position clearly debars<br />
the States from imposing virtually any form of sales tax and,<br />
on broad grounds of economic and social policy, the Commonwealth<br />
Government has decided that it would. not be advisable to re-open<br />
the field of personal income tax to the States. In these<br />
circumstances, I indicated that the Commonwealth was willing to<br />
transfer pay-roll taxation to the States on the basis set out in<br />
the detailed Commonwealth offer on that matter which was<br />
circulated to the Premiers following my opening statement.<br />
The Premiers re-affirmed their previously expressed views<br />
that the States need access to a new area of " growth" taxation<br />
to assist them in financing improvements in the services which<br />
State Governments provide. They indicated that, while some of<br />
them would prefer that the States be given access to income tax,<br />
they accepted that pay-roll tax would constitute-. a useful<br />
addition to their resources for revenue-raising purposes. </p>
<p>The Premiers pointed out, however, that the amount<br />
of revenue that they might be able to raise from the tax<br />
in 1971-72 would not in itself be sufficient to enable them<br />
to deal with the large deficits facing them in that year,<br />
even after taking account of other possibilities for<br />
improving their budgetary outlook.<br />
The Premiers emphasised strongly that, in these<br />
circumstances, they would find it very difficult to cope<br />
with their prospective 1971-72 budget deficits which, they<br />
said, are abnormally high due largely to the unavoidable<br />
" full year" costs of the extraordinary wage and salary awards<br />
granted in 1970-71.<br />
The Treasurer and I both indicated that the Commonwealth<br />
recognised that the States were again faced Ã± n 1971-72 with<br />
abnormal budgetary problems. At the same time we pointed out<br />
that the Commonwealth is itself faced with a very difficult<br />
budgetary problem in 1971-72, and this in circumstances where<br />
there is a need to do everything possible to combat<br />
inflationary pressures. . I also again emphasised that public<br />
authority expenditures are undpubtedly playing a leading role<br />
in the generation of these pressures. After careful<br />
consideration the Commonwealth came to the view that, as part<br />
of a co-operative effort, it should be prepared to play<br />
some further part.<br />
On these grounds the Commonwealth agreed that it should<br />
assist the States to meet their prospective revenue<br />
deficiencies by providing total additional revenue </p>
<p>assistance in 1971-72 estimated at $ 62.7 million.<br />
Of this amount, $ 40 million will take the form of a<br />
non-recurring grant to be distributed between the States in<br />
proportion to their financial assistance grants. A table showing<br />
the approximate distribution of $ 40 million is attached.<br />
The remaining amount of about $ 22.7 million represents<br />
the difference between the amount the States will receive from<br />
pay-roll tax collections in 1971-72. and the amount by which the<br />
1971-72 formula grants will be reduced that is,, the-deduction<br />
from the 1971-72 grants will be-smaller by this amount, This<br />
smaller reduction of about $ 22.7 million will also be made in<br />
the " base" used to determine the formula grants for 1972-73 and<br />
subsequent years so that the States will continue to benefit<br />
from it in those years. Over the remaining four years of the<br />
financial assistance grants the States should receive an<br />
additional 8100 million or so in this way. The method by-which<br />
the estimated amount of $ 22.7 million will be distributed<br />
between the States is described in' more detail in the<br />
attachment. A feature of the agreement betwebn the Commonwealth<br />
and the States to transfer pay-roll tax to the 6tatee, and </p>
<p>which is referred to in the detailed Commonwealth offer,<br />
is that, as from the date of transfer sometime in 1971-72,<br />
wages and salaries paid by local authorities, other than<br />
in respect of their business activities, will be exempted<br />
from pay-roll tax. The cost of providing this exemption,<br />
which I feel sure will be greatly welcomed by local government<br />
authorities throughout Australia, will be met entirely by<br />
the Commonwealth. The cost in 1971-72 will depend on the<br />
date of transfer and the cost in a full year is estimated<br />
to be of the order of $ 8 million.<br />
Further idetails of how the transfer will be'<br />
effected are included in the attachment andithese and: other<br />
technical and administrative aspects are tolbe the subject<br />
of further early discussion between Commonwealth and State<br />
Treasuries. However, there are two points I mention especially<br />
in relation to the transfer.<br />
First, it will be entirely up to each State to<br />
decide at what rate it will levy its own pay-roll tax and<br />
to decide what exemption and other assessment provisions it<br />
should adopt. For that reason it is not possible to say<br />
what additional amount of revenue the States might gain<br />
from pay-roll tax'in 1971-72 or subsequent ryears. It is<br />
one of the great advantages of the scheme" that each State<br />
is able to determine for itself the extent to which<br />
it should gain extra revenue </p>
<p>from this source, having in mind its particular budgetary<br />
circumstances. Secondly, I make it clear that# while pay-roll<br />
tax will be transferred to the States, the Commonwealth<br />
will continue to operate the export incentive scheme so as<br />
to give exporters the same benefits, based on the existing<br />
rate of 2J per cent, as they now enjoy. The Acting Minister<br />
for Trade and Industry will be making a separate statement<br />
about this scheme*<br />
The Commonwealth Government believes that, with<br />
access to this new field of taxation and with the substantially<br />
improved arrangements for the payment of financial assistance<br />
grants to the States settled at the June 1970 Premiers'<br />
Conference, the States should be well placed, after the<br />
difficulties of 1971-72 have been overcome, to meet their<br />
financial responsibilities fully in future. In saying<br />
that I am conscious, as I indicated in my opening statement<br />
to the Conference, that no system of public authority<br />
finance can reasonably be expected to contend with the<br />
consequences of wage awards in fields of partidular importance<br />
to public authority ! employment if they are going to be of the<br />
well-nigh crippling kind which has beset the States in<br />
particular, but alad the Commonwealth, in the course of the<br />
present financial year.<br />
It is fair to say that the severe restrictions<br />
which have had to be placed upon ithe growth of much-needed<br />
public authority works and services in the latter months of<br />
1970-71, and which will have to be maintained and perhaps<br />
intensified in 1971-72, have their origins in the events<br />
in the field of wage ldeterminati6h to which I have referred. </p>
<p>The additional revenue assistance of about<br />
$ 62.7 million which the Commonwealth has agreed to pay to<br />
the States in 1971-72, when added to the large increase<br />
in payments under existing arrangements, gives an<br />
estimated increase in total allocations to the States<br />
from the Commonwealth, including the amounts the States<br />
will receive from pay-roll tax, of over $ 340 million in<br />
1971-72. This would be 12 per cent higher than in<br />
1970-71. Further details of the estimated amounts<br />
involved in 1971-72 are set out in the second table attached. </p>
