The Northern Territory will continue to produce some of the nation's best hockey players with the help of new turf at Marrara Hockey Stadium in Darwin.</p>
<p>The upgrade brings the facilities up to the standard required to host national and international championship games in Darwin.</p>
<p>The Territory has a proud history in the sport of hockey, with home-grown Olympic medal winning athletes such as Nova Peris, Stephen Holt and Mark Hickman.</p>
<p>This new upgrade, which was an election promise in 2010, means Marrara Stadium can continue to foster Australian hockey players including current stars of the Australian men's team - Des Abbott and Joel Carroll.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government provided $500,000 for this project as part of a 2010 election commitment in partnership with the Northern Territory Government and the Northern Territory Hockey Association.</p>
<p>Senator Trish Crossin said the new upgrade would help the next generation of hockey players develop their skills on an international playing surface from day one.</p>
<p>It is also important for the 2,000 people or more who come to Marrara to play and watch sport every weekend.</p>
<p>Marrara Hockey Stadium Turf Replacement is one of 87 projects funded through the Community Infrastructure Grants Program, which is part of the $250 million regional community package committed by the Gillard Labor Government.</p>
<p>These projects are building and improving community centres, major sports grounds, heritage sites and other community infrastructure around Australia.</p>
<p>The project is an example of the Australian Government working together with state and local governments to boost social and economic development and support sustainable communities.</p>
