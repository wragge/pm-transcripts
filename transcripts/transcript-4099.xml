PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS A? RILL 18, 1976<br />
ELECTORAL TALK<br />
This week I want to talk with you about people and Government.<br />
The damage of big government and its potentially great power<br />
to the kind of life style that Australians want is far reaching.<br />
It can effect every part of society.<br />
The exercise of centralised power by big government removes<br />
incentive; it stifles initiative; it encourages laziness;<br />
it imposes uniformity and conformity and it greatly lessens<br />
the opportunity for self respect.<br />
Centralised power creates a society where people become servants<br />
of a government, rather than masters.<br />
The further away the decisions making proc ess takes place,<br />
the less chance there is of correct decisions being made.<br />
My Government and the Liberal National Country Parties in<br />
all states is determined to reverse this trend.<br />
We made a number of significant steps in ac'hieving this aim<br />
at the last Premiers Conference.<br />
First, all State Governments agreed with the Federal Government<br />
on the operation of a new tax sharing arrangement.<br />
After this reform, everyone will have a clear and precise<br />
knowledge of which government State or Federal is<br />
spending their money.. It is a much needed reform which will<br />
give people i. greater control over Government spending.<br />
Some people have suggested that this reform is double taxation.<br />
That view is totally false. There will be one form, one<br />
assessment, one set of tax rules and one system.<br />
Let me be perfectly clear on t his Governments v iews on personal<br />
income tax. A fundamental freedom Australians must have is control<br />
over the income they earn.<br />
Freedom to spend one's income is clearly a tangible expression<br />
of the right to choose.<br />
This freedom has in fact being eroded in Australia. Ever rising<br />
inflation has fueled the taxation growth which has paid for<br />
many socially irresponsible welfare programmes. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Last August the Labor Government budgeted for a net pay as you<br />
earn tax of $ 8.7 billion. This is three times the size of the<br />
1972/ 73 figure.<br />
Frequently rising taxes create a vicious circle of dependence<br />
where families can no longer cope adequately with their own<br />
needs because so much of their income goes to centralised<br />
government to finance extravagant, inefficient and often<br />
wasteful programmes.<br />
It is little wonder the person on average earnings has found<br />
it difficult to save for a house, buy the best education for<br />
his children and look after his ageing parents or relatives<br />
as he would wish.<br />
My Government is pledged to block this unlegislated tax grab<br />
by Canberra.<br />
We are going to introduce tax indexation the most important<br />
tax reform in Australia's history.<br />
Tax indexation will put earnings back into the hands of<br />
individuals and will eliminate as far as possible total<br />
dependence on big government programmes.<br />
Our Parliamentary opponents shed crocodile tears about our<br />
plans to put government responsiblity back into national<br />
economic management. They seem incapable of understanding.<br />
that it is not enough that programmes are worthy. Worthy goals<br />
are limitless, but resources are limited.<br />
There is no doubt that if government indulges all worthy<br />
programmes, it would destroy utterly the freedom of individuals<br />
to choose for themselves.<br />
This Government's approach to welfare is to place emphasis<br />
on directing assistance to those in real need. The. Government<br />
does not believe that the poor and disadvantaged can be best<br />
helped by increasing the dependence of everyone on what the<br />
Government chooses to provide.<br />
Our tax indexation reform will strongly reassert the right of<br />
people to retain their own earnings so that wherever possible<br />
they can meet their needs as they see fit.<br />
Another of t-fundamental issues Lhat is concerned with the<br />
relationship between government and people was also discussed<br />
at the Premiers Conference.<br />
The Conference agreed to set up an independent-council that will<br />
examine the inter relationship between each level of Government.<br />
The council will bring together representatives of each tier<br />
of government and private citizens. Significantly the Chairman<br />
of the council will be a private citizen. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
The Government believes that the effective interation between<br />
the three tiers of government is crucial if we are to improve<br />
the quality of representative government.<br />
Communities are becoming more complex. Their demands on specialist<br />
government services require more and more on the spot information<br />
and expertise.<br />
Only if government can operate where its effects are felt can<br />
Australians truly claim to be part of a meaningful and<br />
democratic political system. </p>
