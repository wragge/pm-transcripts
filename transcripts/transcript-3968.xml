HARVEY, CHANNEL NINE NETWORK<br />
12Z Nove: rs-ee:<br />
THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER, MR WHITLAM AND A NUMBER OF HIS<br />
MINISTERS ARE SUGGESTING THAT BACK DOOR DEALS WVERE DONE<br />
BETWEEN YOURSELF AND THE GOVERNOR GENERAL AND OTHERS TO<br />
BRING ABOUT THIS SITUATION<br />
FRASER THIS IS ABSOLUTE NONSENSE. I UNDERSTAND ITS BEEN OFFICIALLY<br />
DENIED BY GOVERNMENT HOUSE. I CERTAINLY DENY IT. THE<br />
SITUATION HAS COME ABOUT BECAUSE MR WHITLAM HAS BEHAVED<br />
AS NOBODY HAS FOR TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YEARS HAS BEHAVEDTRIED<br />
TO GOVERN WITHOUT FUNDS AND IF HE HAD TAKEN THE NORMAL<br />
COURSE WHEN FUNDS STARTED TO RUN OUT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN<br />
AN ELECTION LONG BEFORE THIS<br />
MR FRASER MR. WHITLAM ALSO SAID YOUR CAR WAS AT GOVERNMENT<br />
HOUSE YESTERDAY SOME MINUTES BEFORE HE GOT TO GOVERNMENT HOUSE<br />
TO BE ADVISED THAT HIS COMMEISSION HAD BEEN ' WITHDRA. WN AND THAT<br />
YOU IN FACT WERE IN ANOTHER ROOM IN GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT THE<br />
SAME TIME HE WAS.<br />
FRASER<br />
AS YOU KNOW THERE WAS WIDE SPECULATION THAT MR WHITLAM WAS<br />
GOING TO RECOMMEND A SENATE ELECTION AND I HAD A MESSAGE THAT<br />
CAME FROM MY OFFICE THAT MR WHITLAM WI1AEGOING TO GOVERNMENT<br />
HOUSE IMMIEDIATELY TO STOP SPEAKING IN PARLIAMENT. I WENT<br />
WITH HIM TO STOP SPEAKING. HE DIDN'T LEAVE FOR GOVERNMENT<br />
HOUSE THEN. I'D BEEN ADVISED THAT I WAS REQUIRED TO GO TO<br />
GOVERNMEN. T HOUSE ABOUT 10 MINUTES AFTER MR WHITLAM WOULD HAVE<br />
LEFT. I ASSUMED THE INSTRUCTIONS I HAD BEEN GIVEN WERE<br />
ACCURATE. MR WHITLAM IN FACT DID NOT GO FOR CONSIDERABLE<br />
TI. E AFTER THAT<br />
WHEN W: ERE YOU ADVISED TO TO GO GVERNMIENT HOUSE?<br />
FRASER I WAS IN THE HOUSE. I WAS ADVISED ' HAT MR W'IITLAM WAS GOING<br />
IMMIIEDIATELY HE STOPPED SPEAKING. / 2<br />
7 / 4i<br />
u </p>
<p>-2-<br />
MR FRASER THE RUMOURS PERSIST THAT YOU IN FACT KNEW WHAT<br />
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE PRIME MINISTER WELL BEFORE HE DID<br />
FRASER<br />
WELL ITS JUST NOT TRUE. THE GOVERNOR GENERAL, SAID IT WAS NOT<br />
TRUE. MR WHITLAM IS TRYING TO SAY THAT IT IS TRUE. NOW WE<br />
CAN'T DO MORE THAN THAT.<br />
IN THIS CONTEXT, WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT YOU WERE GOING TO BE<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FRASER<br />
AFTER THE GOVERNOR GENERAL HAD HAD HIS INTERVIEW WITH THE<br />
FORMER PRIME MINISTER.<br />
THE SUGGESTIONS THAT MEMBERS OF YOUR STAFF KNEW AT 11 A. M.<br />
YESTERDAY IS WIHAT?<br />
FRASER COMPLETE NONSENSE. THIS IS TYPICAL OF THE TACTICS THAT THIS<br />
PAST GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED TO PURSUE FOR A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD<br />
OF TIME. THEY ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH THE FACTS, THEY ARE<br />
CONCERNED ONLY TO GET-THE PARTICULAR STORY OR THE PARTICULAR<br />
SLANT ACROSS AND I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE WORDS THAT MR WHITLAM<br />
USED YESTERDAY IN SOME OF THE THINGS HE SAID TODAY DEMOSTRATE<br />
QUITE CLEARLY THE DEPTHS TO WHICH HE HAS TAKEN POLITICAL DEBATE<br />
IN AUSTRALIA. WE'RE NOT GOING TO ANSWER IN KIND. IF HE WANTS<br />
TO PLAY THAT SORT OF GAME LET HIM DO IT. THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE<br />
WILL BE BETTER JUDGES THAN TO BE PERSUADED BY THAT SORT OF<br />
ACTIVITY. MR FRASER WAS IT A FACT THAT YOUR DRIVER HID YOUR CAR AROUND<br />
A TREE'OR AROUND A CORNER AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE?<br />
FRASER I WOUND'NT HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT HE DID WITH IT AFTER I GOT OUT<br />
OF IT. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE GOVERNOR GENERAL WAS SEEING THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER?<br />
FRASER IN GOVERNMENT HOUSE<br />
DID YOU SEE THE GOVERNOR GENERAL AT ALL BEFORE THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER SAW HIM<br />
FRASER<br />
NO I DID NOT<br />
SO YOU WERE RECEIVED AT GOVERNNENT HOUSE AND YOU JUST WAITED<br />
UNTIL AFTER THE PRIME MININSTER HAD LEFT.<br />
FRASER I WAS PUT INTO A SIDE ROOM<br />
WEREN'T YOU EMBARASBED BY THIS MR FRASER?<br />
FRASER THERE ARE MANY ROOMS IN GOVERNMENT HOUSE<br />
DID YOU FEAL UNEASY CALLING AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE KNOWING THAT<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER WASN'T AWARE OF WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?<br />
FRASER I DIDN'T KNOW vWHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN EITHER<br />
MR FRASER IN A RADIO INTERVIEW WITH US ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON<br />
LAST YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULDN'T BACK DOWN AND YOU THOUGT(' i<br />
MR WHITLAM WOULDN'T BACK DOWN BUT YOU SAID THERE IS ANOTHER<br />
ALTERNATIVE BUT YOU W'OULDN'T EXPLAIN. WOULD YOU SAY THAT ' IAT<br />
HAS HAPPENED IS TIE ALTERNATIVE TH., Tr YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT? </p>
<p>1<br />
-4-<br />
FRASER WHAT I POINTED OUT GOING BACK OVER THREE OR FOUR WEEKS THAT<br />
THE PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIA IS COMPOSED OF THE QUEEN AND HER<br />
REPRESENTATIVES THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER ALL ALONG WAS TRYING TO SAY IT IS COMPOSED<br />
ONLY OF MR WHITLAM AND I WAS POINTING OUT THAT WASN'T TRUE<br />
THAT W'AS A FACT OF LIFE THAT MR WHITLAM HAD IGNORED THROUGHOUT.<br />
SO THE ALTERNATIVE YOU WERE REFERRING TO ON THURSDAY IS THE<br />
COURSE OF EVENTS<br />
FRASER I'M NOT ADDING TO. OR DETRACTING FROM THE ANSWER I HAVE ALREADY<br />
GIVEN MR . FRASER CAN I ASK YOU SIR WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PERSONAL<br />
STAFF OF FORMER MINISTERS, THEIR ENTITLEMENTS TO COMM! ONWEALTH<br />
CARS AND ANY ENTITLEMENTS MINISTERS HAD TO VIP AIRCRAFT<br />
FRASER WELL MR WHITLAM WILL HAVE THE ENTITLEMENTS TO A VIP AIRCRAFT<br />
THAT THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION HAS. FORM'ER STAFFS WHO ARE<br />
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE WILL BE IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE.<br />
OTHER MEMBERS OF STAFF WOULD BE GIVEN UNTIL THE END OF DECEMBER<br />
BY WHICH TIME AN ELECTION WOULD BE CLEAR AND THEREFORE THEIR<br />
FUTURES WOULD BE CLEAR<br />
MR FRASER I WONDER IF I COULD ASK YOU DID YOU HAVE AT ANY STAGE<br />
BEFORE YESTERDAY ANY CONSULTATION ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS<br />
WITH THE CHIEF JUSTICE SIR GARFIELD BARWICK.<br />
FRASER NO I DID NOT </p>
<p>'. 7 PRIME MINISTER YOU MENTIONED A FEW MINUTES AGO THAT THE CABINET<br />
CONSIDERED THE RUN DOWN OF THE ECONOMY. WHAT IS THE STATE<br />
OF THE ECONOMY AS REPORTED IN CABINET TODAY?<br />
MR FRASER<br />
A GOOD DEAL . MORE SERIOUS THAN WE HAD BEEN LED TO BELIEVE.<br />
I WILL BE MAKING A CONSIDERED STATEMENT ABOUT THIS IN A<br />
DAY OR TWO BECAUSE THE BRIEFINGS LED TO FURTHER QUESTIONS<br />
BEING ASKED BUT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF INVESTMENT AND<br />
CREATION OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES, FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF<br />
BEING ABLE TO CONTAIN INFLATION, MUCH MUCH MORE SERIOUS<br />
THAN WE HAD BEEN LED TO BELIEVE<br />
DO YOU SEE IT TAKING MORE THAN THREE YEARS FOR THE ECONOMY<br />
TO RECOVER UPON YOUR PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT<br />
FRASER UNDER NX~ OUR GOVERNMENT NO BECAUSE WE ENH1C HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED<br />
THAT IT WAS MORE SERIOUS THAN THE FORMER GOVERNMENT HAD<br />
INDICATED. WERE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THIS SPECI-FIC INFORMATION THAT THE<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT HAS CONCEALED ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY?<br />
FRASER<br />
YES I'LL BE MAKING A CONSIDERED STATEM. ENT ABOUT THIS IN A<br />
DAY OR TWO.<br />
COULD YOU INDICATE THE AREAS<br />
FRASER<br />
NO I'M GOING TO MAKE A CONSIDERED STATEMENT ABOUT THIS IN A<br />
DAY OR TWOS TIME<br />
IN BRINGING THE ECONOMY TO HEEL MR FRASER ILL IT BE NECESSARY<br />
FOR YOU TO CUT BACK ON GOVERNMENT SERVICES OR LAY OFF ANY<br />
PRESI. ENTLY EMPLOYED GOVERNMENT STAFF? </p>
<p>.1 I.<br />
I' -6-<br />
MR FRASER<br />
THE FULL DETAILS OF OUR ECONOMIC POLICY WILL BE UNFOLDED<br />
IN A POLICY SPEECH AND SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENTS THAT COME<br />
OUT AFTER THAT. I MADE IT PLAIN AT AN EARLIER PRESS<br />
CONFERENCE THAT I WOULDN'T BE ANSWERING QUESTIONS ON<br />
FUTURE POLICY UNTIL THAT TIME. IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT<br />
IF WE WERE FURTHER THAN A WEEK AWAY OR ABOUT A WEEK AAWAY<br />
FROM A POLICY SPEECH BUT SINCE ITS AS CLOSE AS THAT WE'LL<br />
WAIT UNTIL THEN<br />
MR FRASER COULD I ASK YOU IN YOUR PRESENT ROLE AS THE CARETAKER<br />
OF THE GOVERNMENT IS THERE ANYTHING YOU PROPOSE TO DO ABOUT<br />
TACKLING THE STATE OF ECONOMY GIVEN THAT YOU . SAY THAT IT IS<br />
FAR MORE SERIOUS THAN...<br />
MR FRASER<br />
ONE OF THE CONDITIONS OF MY COLMISSION FROM THE GOVERNOR<br />
GENERA-kL IS THAT THE POLICIES OF THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT<br />
CONTINUE UNTIL AN ELECTION DETERMINE THE RESULT. NOW THAT<br />
CONDITION WILL BE FOLLOWED THROUGH SCRUPULOUSLY.<br />
IN OTHER WORDS THERE IS NOTHING YOU COULD DO FOR THE<br />
ECONOMY IN THE TIME YOU ARE A CARETAKER<br />
FRASER UNTIL THE 13th OF DECEMBER<br />
WHY DECEMBER 13 MR FRASER<br />
FRASE R<br />
THATS THE DAY OF THE ELECTION<br />
WHY DID YO. U CHOSE DECEMBER 13<br />
FRASER </p>
<p>-7-<br />
F RAS ER<br />
ITS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FOR THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA TO BE GIVEN<br />
AN OPPORTUNITY TO JUDGE, AN OPPORTUNITY THAT MR IWHITLA14 WAS<br />
SEEKING TO DENY THEM ON THIS MATTER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO<br />
THAT IT CAN BE CLEANED UP THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA HAVING<br />
EXPRESSED THE PROPER AND DEMOCRATIC JUDGEMENT THAT OUGHT<br />
TO BE OPEN TO THEM BY PUTTING A PIECE OF PAPER IN THE<br />
BALLOT BOX AND THE 13th IS THE EARLIEST DATE THAT THAT<br />
COULD BE ORGANISED. BY THE 20TH IT STARTS TO GET INTO<br />
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES FOR THE RETURNING OFFICERS.<br />
COULD I ASK YOU ONE MORE QUESTION<br />
THE CABINET TEAM WHICH YOU HAVE CHOSEN TODAY, IS THAT LIKELY<br />
TO BE THE SAME TEAM SHOULD YOU BE SUCCESSFUL ON DECEMBER 13<br />
FRASER WELL THE GOVERNOR GENERAL HAS CALLED US A CARETAKER CABINET<br />
AND THATS THE TERMS OF THE COMMISSION. THATS PRECISELY WHAT<br />
IT IS AND NO ASSUMPTIONS SHOULD BE DRAWN UPON IT EXCEPT THE<br />
ANSWER TO QUESTIONS I GAVE EARLIER ABOUT THE TREASURER AND<br />
MR ANTHONY. </p>
