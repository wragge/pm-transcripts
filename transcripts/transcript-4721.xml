PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE REPORTS<br />
Mr. Speaker, I ask leave of the House to make a brief<br />
statement concerning the reports of Parliamentary Committees.<br />
Mr. Speaker, all honourable members will recognize that a great<br />
deal of most valuable work is done by committees of this<br />
Parliament. It is important that the reports of these<br />
committees, many of which reflect considerable thought, effort<br />
and often insight, received full and careful attention by<br />
Ministers. It is equally desirable that a procedure be established to<br />
make sure that Parliament is aware of the decisions which<br />
the Government takes in connection with such reports. In some<br />
instances, such a procedure is already in operation.<br />
As Honourable Members will know, Department of Finance minutes<br />
are provided to the Public Accounts Committee in respect of<br />
each of its reports. Similarly, the Government has been<br />
careful to see that its decisions in relation to each of the<br />
Expenditure Committee's reports have been announced to this<br />
House. The Government has now decided to apply this principle to all<br />
Parliamentary Committee reports. Henceforth, within six<br />
months of the tabling of a Committee report, the responsible<br />
Minister will make a statement in the Parliament outlining<br />
the action the Government proposes to take in relation to<br />
the report. If the six month period expires during a<br />
Parliamentary recess, the Ministerial Statement will be made<br />
at the earliest opportunity in the next Parliamentary sitting.<br />
As Honourable Members will appreciate, there will be some<br />
Committee reports which will not be appropriate to the<br />
procedure I have outlined. Among these are reports of the<br />
Committees relating to House Management, the Public Works<br />
Committee, and the Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament<br />
House. The present procedure relating to the Public Accounts<br />
Committee will, of course, continue to operate.<br />
There have been a number of reports tabled since the Government<br />
took office on which the Government's attitude has not yet<br />
been announced.<br />
I have asked Ministers to inform the Cabinet of action taken or<br />
proposed to be taken in relation to them and where appropriate,<br />
the Parliament will be informed in these cases, too. The<br />
procedure I have outlined reflects this Government's firm / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
intention to see that the excellent work of Parliamentary<br />
Committees does not pass unheeded.<br />
We need to use to the full the talents and resources available<br />
in this House and the Senate. One important way in which<br />
this can be achieved is the further development and enhancement<br />
of the Parliamentary Committee and I shall be making a<br />
further statement on that subject in a few days.<br />
Mr. Speaker, I believe the arrangements I have announced<br />
represent a further strengthening of the role of<br />
Parliament in our system of Government.<br />
