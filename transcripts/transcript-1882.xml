VISIT TO SOUTH EAST ASIA 1968<br />
LB^ Ry DJAKARTA<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINI3TER, MR. JOHN GORTON,<br />
AT BANQUET GIVEN BY PRESIDENT SUHARTO 13 JUNE 1968<br />
Mr. President, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:-<br />
Thank you, Sir, for your kind welcome and warm remarks about the<br />
relations between our two countries. My visit to Indonesia in the course of my<br />
first visit as Prime Minister to this area reflects the close concern and interest<br />
which the Government and people of Australia have in your country. This<br />
interest is not new found.<br />
Australians are proud to have extended the hand of friendship to Indonesians<br />
in the earlier days of the struggle for independence. Vie are even prouder, Sir,<br />
that you accepted that friendship and paid us the honour of nominating us as<br />
your representative at the United Nations negotiations at that time. It was in<br />
those days that a firm basis evas laid for an enduring and neighbourly relationship.<br />
Those early days of close co-operation were followed in due course by events<br />
that were less happy. But through all these times of differences and confrontation<br />
Australia's interest in Indonesia did not slacken.<br />
For example, during all that time our aid programme continued and your<br />
students remained at their studies at our universities, It was also possible at<br />
that time to reach agreement on the marking of our common border in Irian, In<br />
all our dealings during those, difficult times we sought to indicate that we were<br />
fully conscious of the need to preserve as wide an area of co-operation as possible<br />
and continue to work towards a confident and productive relationship. I believe<br />
that you shared this aim and looked forward with us to the time when the full<br />
warmth of our relations could be restored. And that time has come. It is a<br />
matter of the highest satisfaction to me and to all Australians that relations have<br />
now been fully restored and indeed, as I think, lifted to new levels.<br />
The Australian Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Hasluck, has visited<br />
Indonesia three times in the last sixteen months. Your Foreign Minister has just<br />
concluded a visit to Australia. There have been numerous visits by other<br />
Ministers between our two countries in the last two years. At the Parliamentary<br />
level we had a Parliamentary Delegation here last year and your Parliamentary<br />
Delegation has just returned from Australia. Large numbers of individual members<br />
of the Australian Parliament from both sides of the House have come here on<br />
visits both official and private. Our Air Force Commanders have exchanged<br />
visits. We have Army officers training in each other's country. Units of the<br />
Australian Navy have been most courteously received in recent visits in Indonesia.<br />
This is quite a satisfying list. But in itself it does not fully convey the<br />
; armth of the relations established, the growing frankness of the exchanges that<br />
we have and the desire to seek out even more ways of helping each other overcome<br />
our individual and our shared problems. It is this spirit and not just the fact that<br />
there have been these meetings which is so important and which ensures that we<br />
shall go forward along the course of mutual help and interest with trust and respect.<br />
None of this that I have said is surprising to me, nor, Your Excellency, from<br />
what you have said, is it surprising to you. Nothing is more natural than that<br />
Australia and Indonesia, situated as they are and occupying the places they do<br />
in the political and economic life in this part of the world, should be the best<br />
of friends with a common interest in developing good neighbourly relations.<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
For whatever happens in this part of the world affects us both, not always<br />
equally, but surely nonetheless. d'e look out on the same vista of international<br />
affairs from the samne geographical situation, and we give thought to the same<br />
questions, and cope with similar problems. The conclusions we arrive at, the<br />
actions we take, are not always going to be the same. VWe each have our<br />
particular traditions, and linkcs, and interests which togrether with the facts of<br />
geography, determine those individual conclusions and actions. But, in many<br />
cases those conclusions will be the same, and when they are not it is important<br />
that we both have a clear understanding of the reasons for any diversion of<br />
approach. And I think there is already ample evidence that this is a realistic<br />
aim and that this can, and will, be achieved.<br />
So I believe, Your Excellency, that our two countries must go forward<br />
tether. I believe also that each of our two countries recognises that. I believe<br />
that not only our two countries but the other neighbouring countries in the region<br />
must also go forward with us. And I believe finally that we shall accomplish<br />
this goal, God w., illing, to our mutual benefit, prosperity and to the service of<br />
the independence of each one of our countries and of those other neighbouring<br />
countries in the region.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, would you join me in drinking a toast to the<br />
President of the Republic of Indonesia. </p>
