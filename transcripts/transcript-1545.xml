ARRIVAL STATE1ffENT BY THE PRIMfE MINISTER,<br />
MR. HAROLD HOLT AT TAIPEI 4TH APRIL, 1967<br />
It. gives me great pleasure to make my first visit to the<br />
Republic of China, and to be the first Prime viinister of Australia<br />
to have made such a visit in that capacity.<br />
I greatly look forvard to meeting the distinguished<br />
President of the Republic, and to having the opportunity of<br />
discussing with him the many matters in which we have a common<br />
interest. These include importantly the menace of communist<br />
expansion in the Asian and Pacific region, a threat of which<br />
the Republic oi China has a long and intimate knowledge.<br />
Relations between the Republic of China and Australia<br />
have long been warm and friendly. Australia has consistently<br />
supported the position of the Republic of Chi. na in the United<br />
Nations and its agencies. The Chinese Embassy is one of the<br />
oldest diplomatic missions in Canberra, and Australia has recently<br />
re-established its own embassy with the Republic of China. Trade<br />
between our two countries has increased substantially over recent<br />
years. In addition to establishing personal contact with the<br />
President, his Ministers and other leading personalities, I hope<br />
during my visit to see something of Taiwan's impressive economic<br />
progress, about which we have had enthusiastic reports. I am<br />
particularly looking forward to visiting some of your modern<br />
industrial plants and port installations.<br />
We in Australia share goals of peace, stability and<br />
prosperity so widely held in Asia. We believe the Republic of<br />
China, with its growing economic strength and the resourcefulness<br />
of its people, can play a highly significant part in the combined<br />
e forts of all like-minded countries to satisfy these longings.<br />
We recognise that the Republic of China is Alre ady making a<br />
considerable contribution in thc form of its economic and technical<br />
aid to other countries. We likewise have been increasing the<br />
volume and variety of our economic aid.<br />
We are glad, also, to find ourselves fellovi-members with<br />
China of two new Asian organisations, the Asian and Pacific Council<br />
and the Asian Development Bank. Vie confidently anticipate further<br />
profitable co-operation between our two countries in both of them.<br />
