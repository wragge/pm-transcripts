<p>The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP) has been extended to people severely affected by flooding in the local government areasof South Burnett and Cherbourg, Queensland.</p>
<p>These floods have had a devastating impact on this community and it is a very difficult time for the people affected.  The AGDRP will provide a much-needed helping hand to the people of South Burnett.  Those directly affected by the floods in this area are encouraged to test their eligibility for the AGDRP.</p>
<p>The AGDRP is already being provided to individuals who have been severely impacted by flooding in the Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Bundaberg, Fraser Coast, Gladstone, Gympie, Lockyer Valley, North Burnett, Rockhampton and Somerset.  Further information on Australian Government assistance is available online at <a href="http://www.disasterassist.gov.au">www.disasterassist.gov.au</a>.</p>
<p>The Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy (DIRS) is also being made available to individuals in the LGAs of Banana, Gladstone, Ipswich, Scenic Rim, Somerset, South Burnett, Southern Downs, Goondiwindi and Toowoomba. This assistance provides payments to employees, small business persons and farmers who can demonstrate they have experienced a loss of income. </p>
<p>The assistance will ensure that people are able to stay in these areas and will support the longer-term recovery of the devastated local and regional economies. The DIRS is already being provided to individuals in the LGAs of Bundaberg, Gympie, Fraser Coast, North Burnett and Lockyer Valley.</p>
<p>The easiest way to lodge a claim for the AGDRP or the DIRS is online at <a href="http://www.humanservices.gov.auor">www.humanservices.gov.auor</a> by calling the Australian Government Information Line on 180 22 66 from 8am to 8pm local time, seven days a week.  Completed claim forms can also be lodged in person at a Department of Human Services service centre. </p>
