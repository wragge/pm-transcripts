TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE AT IMPERIAL HOTEL -TOKYO<br />
16 MAY 1986<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir, can you give a guarantee to ordinary<br />
wage earners tonight that the tax cuts as promised will be<br />
introduced from September?<br />
PM: I understand that in the discussions that took place<br />
today it was agreed that there would be a special meeting<br />
held under the auspices the advisory committee on prices<br />
and income and that it was accepted all those represented<br />
that anything which went to this question of the current<br />
account problem would be on the table for discussion. Now<br />
I have had discussions both the Treasurer and Mr Willis who<br />
were representing the Government at that meeting and it is<br />
my understanding from the Treasurer out of those discussions<br />
that it has been made clear and he has made it clear that<br />
there is no question but that the tax cuts will be delivered.<br />
It is understood that the question of timing can be a matter<br />
for discussion at this meeting. But there is no doubt that<br />
whatever that discussion as to timing that the cuts will<br />
be delivered in 1986.<br />
JOURNALIST: So there could be delays by as much as what<br />
time?<br />
PM: Let me say that out of . the discussion I have had the<br />
question of the timing of the cuts is accepted as being a<br />
matter on the table for discussion as I understand it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it your impression that the ACTU have<br />
suggested that they initiated the idea that they might be<br />
prepared to accept a delay?<br />
PM: You mean in the meeting today?<br />
JOURNALIST: No, I am now talking about the tax cuts either<br />
yesterday or before today?<br />
PM: I don't know whether at the discussion today the<br />
suggestion of our possible delay of the implementation of the<br />
tax cuts was raised by the ACTU. I simply don't know I am<br />
not hiding anything from you. I haven't been informed as<br />
to whether they raised the question or not. Indeed, as I think<br />
you can appreciate, this matter has arisen apparently </p>
<p>spontaneously out of a discussion that arose at the meeting<br />
a regular scheduled meeting of ACPI as I said to you today<br />
earlier in the press conference that apparently during the<br />
normal meeting the question of the current economic situation<br />
came up and particularly the question of balance of payments<br />
and the current account. And business representatives made<br />
the observation apparently that they weren't in the same<br />
position to be able to discuss these matters as was the ACTU.<br />
And my colleagues, Mr Keating and Mr Willis, said well feel<br />
free. I mean you should feel yourself free to be as involved.<br />
The ACTU apparently responded and said yes, we are quite<br />
happy about you being just as involved in those discussions.<br />
And it was out of that sort of spontaneous discussion apparently<br />
that there then came the agreement for this special meeting<br />
under the auspices of ACPI.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you have been telling us for two<br />
days that there is no need for drastic change of policy<br />
yet it seems that your two ministers have launched<br />
a meeting at which everything is on the table without first<br />
getting your OK to that. Is that right?<br />
PM: No, let me make it clear that I welcome this development.<br />
We had in our discussions in the Cabinet and there were<br />
discussions in the ERC the idea that some sorts of discussions<br />
may be desirable later, had been talked about. Now when this<br />
arose spontaneously at the ACPI meeting today it was perfectly<br />
appropriate that this suggestion should have been welcomed<br />
and been built upon by the Ministers representing the<br />
Government there because it was totally consistent with the<br />
discussions that we have had. And I welcome that. Let me in<br />
regard to that part of your question Michelle, which talks<br />
about drastic new directions. I don't believe that the fact<br />
that there is going to be a meeting of this kind of which I<br />
welcome should be seen as a drastic new change. I mean let me<br />
remind you that the characteristic of this-Government since<br />
we have been in office is that we do talk with the constituents<br />
in the community. We have done it from the very first day we<br />
have been in office and if a suggestion is made, as it was<br />
at ACPI, that it would be appropriate to have such a meeting<br />
then naturally we have welcomed it and it is totally consistent<br />
with our whole approach in the conduct of economic policy.<br />
JOURNALIST: What would the Government's. position be at. this<br />
-point? PM: Well, what we will be putting will be worked out between<br />
now and that time and I will stay in contact with my Ministers<br />
and I would hope and expect that the meeting will be able to<br />
be held soon after my return and by that stage, as a result<br />
of the discussion that will be taking place in Australia and<br />
my consultation with my colleagues, we will work out exactly<br />
what we think is the appropriate position to take at that<br />
level.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you believe the tax cuts ought to be deferred? </p>
<p>PM: I am not going to commit myself to that publicly now. I<br />
think clearly it is a matter as I have indicated to you that<br />
is said to be appropriately on the table. Now we will look<br />
at it in the light of the most up-to-date information that<br />
we have.<br />
JOURNALIST: Wages is on the table as well?<br />
PM: Well, I quess at least some of the people who will be<br />
represented there will wish to talk about it Mike. Let me<br />
make it clear, what I have been given to understand is that<br />
there has been no bar put upon what should go on the table<br />
out of the discussion which was held there at ACPI today.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will the Government begin re-appraising the<br />
policy between now and that meeting so that it can go to<br />
that meeting with an idea of what it sees as the policy<br />
direction ahead?<br />
PM: Yes, obviously we will continue to do what we have<br />
always done to look at the emerging circumstances, see what<br />
the appropriate mix of policy is and that is what we have<br />
done to this point and we'll continue to do it. And I would<br />
say again that I welcome the opportunity that there will now<br />
be within that ACPI framework to have a discussion in which the<br />
Government's own thinking can be enlarged and assisted by<br />
the views of those bodies represented. I mean the business<br />
organisations, the trade union movement and the States and<br />
the professional organisations.<br />
JOURNALIST: What form will this meeting take? Will it be<br />
open, who will chair the meeting, where it would be held?<br />
PM: Well, the ACPI meetings are not open and I wouldn't<br />
expect therefore that this would be. I mean don't let's get<br />
the idea that this is a new summit. It is deliberately as I<br />
understand it been expressed as a meeting under the auspices<br />
of ACPI so it would not be a public meeting. As to where it<br />
is held, I think that the ACPI meetings are normally held in<br />
Melbourne, this one was. I think they normally are held there.<br />
Now whether because there might be some enlarged representation<br />
of the constituents....... it may be held in Canberra or Sydney.<br />
I don't know whether they have addres-sed themselves to that.<br />
I don't think where it is held is a. matter of importance.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you normally don't attend these<br />
meetings. Presumably you will chair this one?<br />
PM: I guess that is possible. I would certainly be wanting<br />
to have an input in the preparation of the meeting and<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it certain you will chair it?<br />
PM: Well, I just haven't addressed myself to it. I have said<br />
that I believe that the meeting should held after I get back<br />
and I guess it is appropriate that I should be there.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you tell us please when you first heard about it<br />
this morning the preferred plan </p>
<p>PM: No not this morning. I didn't hear about it this morning.<br />
It was after lunch when I was informed that there had been<br />
contact made to our office from the Ministers as to the<br />
development and then I spoke first with Mr Willis because<br />
Paul was flying back to Sydney. I spoke first with Ralph and<br />
then I have been able to talk to Paul.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was your specific approval sought?<br />
PM: Of course it wa: Ij I mean he was* whx' would my approval<br />
be sought. You have a meeting in which you were represented<br />
by the Treasurer and the Minister. They are there in the<br />
knowledge that the Government has taken the view that some<br />
discussions may be desirable and out of this meeting the<br />
suggestion arises following this observation of the employers<br />
that they would like to be involved. The ACTU said yes that<br />
would be a good idea. If my Ministers, the Treasurer and<br />
Mr Willis, hadn't immediately grabbed hold of that and said<br />
yes we welcome it they would have been derilect in their duty.<br />
It is not a question of seeking my approval for that.<br />
JOURNALIST: So there was a Cabinet decision<br />
PM: Well, in the discussion that we have had in the Cabinet<br />
and the ERC there have been a view that at some stage Geoff,<br />
it may be desirable to have some wider discussions about<br />
these problems. We haven't made view about timing. And so<br />
wi'thin that context was once the suggestion the was raised<br />
within ACPI it was a perfectly proper response.<br />
JOURNALIST: To what purpose had this idea been proposed in<br />
Cabinet? PM: It was just that we were having a discussion about the<br />
economy and we certainly did in ERC. We are always doing that<br />
there to watch the developing framework. And I mean I don't<br />
want to say that even if it said now look, there has got to<br />
be a meeting with the unions and perhaps with business by<br />
next week. But it had been indicated that it would be likely<br />
to be desirable to have such a meeting. No plans have been<br />
made about and I am simply saying that when in the ACPI<br />
environment the suggestion was made and there was this positive<br />
position of the employers and the trade unions about such<br />
a meeting then it's-just a perfectly natural extension.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister do you see all of<br />
going straight to this meeting?<br />
PM: Well, as I understand from the discussion it has been<br />
said that any matter that the people want to put on the table,*-<br />
for discussion can be there. Now having said that I have no<br />
reasons to believe that the substance of the Accord is an<br />
issue. I have said before that there is provision in the<br />
Accord for a looking at its operation in the light of<br />
developing economic circumstances. Now there will be people<br />
who will want to talk about some matters which are relevant<br />
to that. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: PM: Of course I can, they are not inconsistent. I have said<br />
consistently that we have a position where the level of<br />
activity that has been going on in the past that has produced<br />
current account position which is not sustainable and our<br />
policies are of course directed towards creating a growth<br />
situation which is consistent with a reduction in our<br />
current account deficit while maintaining growth and employment.<br />
Arnd if the sort of meeting that can now be held under the<br />
auspices of ACPI can be of assistance to the Government and<br />
the community in achieving such a policy situation then that<br />
is precisely the sensible thing to do. It is precisely<br />
consistent with everything that we have done in the conduct<br />
of policy since we have been in Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mvr Hawke, do you think that Mr Keating's alarmist<br />
statements the other day were meant<br />
PM: I don't know that it would Greg, I mean I can't put<br />
myself in minds of the employers but as I understand it Greg,<br />
at ACPI meetings as with ERG what happens is that there is<br />
some statement made about the current economic situation<br />
and that certainly happens at the EPAC and I believe it<br />
happens at ACPI. Now it seems that in that context that<br />
part of the meeting of ACPI the observations were made by<br />
the employers to which I have referred. I wouldn't think they<br />
were prompted by anything that the Treasurer said before the<br />
meeting. JOURNALIST: Sir, why is this being held under ACPI and not<br />
through EPAC? I mean EPAC the main body that ensures that<br />
you handles these sorts of things.<br />
PM: Well EPAC has got a much wider representation and it<br />
just happened to be the case that this was the particular<br />
forum where it arose and where you do have relevant<br />
representation. I mean you have the business organisations,<br />
you have the trade unions, the have the States and you have<br />
professional associations with the. Commonwealth Government.<br />
And it seems an appropriate sort of forum in which that<br />
should occur.<br />
JOURNALIST: But you don't-have other people like, for example,<br />
people representing the under privileged, the social-services'<br />
area? PM: Well, they are not directly represented but I don't accept<br />
that the State governments and the Commonwealth Government<br />
don't have the interests of those people very directly<br />
I just don't accept that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why isn't this a summit if all these people<br />
are involved?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think that a summit is appropriate. I mean<br />
we hadn't at any stage in our discussions contemplated that<br />
the circumstances with which we were dealing required a call<br />
for a summit and nor apparently did those represented at the<br />
meeting this morning. I mean I don't think that it is sensible<br />
to be talking about a summit situation. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Would you allow the welfare sector......<br />
PM: Well, I don't accept that their interests are not<br />
represented by the Government's concern and I thin I given that<br />
there is desire to talk about the particular problem<br />
associated with the current account situation and balance of<br />
payments that the constituents that are represented at ACPI<br />
are appropriate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you said yesterday in response<br />
to a specific question on tax cuts this August......<br />
well, there is no decision been made tonight to put it<br />
back and I would like you to show me the part of the transcipt<br />
which says there has been a decision to put it back. What I have<br />
said is that out of the discussion today the question of the<br />
tax cuts has been said to be on the table and the timing of<br />
it would be regarded as relevant in that discussion. The question<br />
of decision on this matter will be one for the Government in<br />
the light of the thinking of the Government itself and<br />
particularly in the light of this meeting.<br />
JOURNALIST: PM: Well, it certainly implies that it is a relevant consideration<br />
for making fiscal and budgetary decisions relevant to the<br />
current account problem which faces the Australian nation<br />
and whether in fact out of all that discussion a decision will<br />
be made remains to be seen. That is a decision to be made<br />
as to a deferral but I would see nothing within either my<br />
knowledge of the existing situation or what has been relayed<br />
to me from discussions with the Treasurer and the Minister for<br />
Employment and Industrial Relations which would lead to any<br />
conclusion that the tax cuts would not be operative within<br />
this year.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, will this affect the current national<br />
wage PM: Well, it is a good question Gedff, the question was raised<br />
by Mr Willis and<br />
JOURNALIST: With you?<br />
PM: Yes,.:. as to the relationship of the timing of the meeting<br />
and the national wage case and if in fact the actual hearing<br />
of the national wage case had been formally finished before<br />
the meeting was held it is a possibility, I want this in<br />
respect to the Commission. I mean am I am not seeking to<br />
suggest what may or may not happen. What Minister Willis<br />
was putting was that if something concrete came out of the<br />
meeting which could be considered of relevance to the<br />
determination by the bench then it may be possible to re-open<br />
simply for the process of making the outcome of that meeting<br />
known. JOURNALIST: In those discussions you have had with Mr Willis<br />
today did the question of delaying superannuation....... </p>
<p>PM: No although I will take it from what Mr Willis said and<br />
what Mr Keating said that that would be a matter relevant to<br />
be considered. I mean I say this subject to correction. I don't<br />
recall in my conversation with Mr Willis that that was<br />
specifically mentioned although I must say that it would be<br />
not inappropriate for that matter to arise in terms of what<br />
they did say.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could you clarify what you had in mind in the<br />
earlier meeting that came up in Cabinet? Do you think that<br />
that could devise some sort of solution to the current account<br />
deficit? PM: Well, no it was simply that people were looking at the<br />
range of relevant considerations in the area of monetary policy<br />
we talked about, fiscal and budgetary policy we talked about,<br />
wages policy we talked about and within that context we simply<br />
said that at some stage it may be necessary to have discussions<br />
with the interest groups in the community that were affected.<br />
Now, I don't want to say as I have made it quite<br />
clear before that there is no suggestion we are going to have to<br />
do that at point a, b or c. That was there and it was in that<br />
context, as I say, I think it was very useful that the matter<br />
arose at this meeting and that the opportunity has been taken<br />
to have such a discussion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was the deferral of tax cuts discussed in Cabinet?<br />
PM: I think at one stage someone may have suggested it? I take<br />
it back. At one stage one suggestion was made may be<br />
a possibility but there was no concrete discussion or detailed<br />
discussion about it. When you are discussing a thing like the<br />
future direction of economic policy and the evidence of the<br />
problem in the current account area you are going to naturally<br />
in wide ranging discussion, every possibility comes up. You<br />
wouldn't be doing your job if you didn't look at all the<br />
elements of it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, a week ago you and Mr Keating were saying<br />
that things were travelling along in the right direction. Isn't<br />
this all rath.-er an over-reaction to one month's balance of<br />
payments figures?<br />
-PM: Well, let me re-say these things Greg, there is some<br />
suggestion that the figures are exaggerated by the treatment of<br />
Easter in March which hadn't sufficiently been taken into account<br />
by people who had been making their predictions. Now I want to<br />
make it quite clear that I am not in a position to quantify that<br />
and I don't seek to. But I think you will have to say that even<br />
if you have-~ got to breakdown the April figures of $ 1.5 billion<br />
to take that into account and that is still, I think, disturbingly<br />
high figure. It would mean perhaps that you are looking to high<br />
figures lower than the 1.5 but still of a disturbing sort of<br />
picture. Now I hope and we believe that we have seen the worst<br />
of the situation. I repeat as I have said to you before I think<br />
that we have seen an increase in the volume of exports beyond<br />
the level that was anticipated at the time of the Budget. ' 7C </p>
<p>We are looking at a decrease in the actual level of imports in<br />
the last couple of months so I think the evidence is there for<br />
a basis of optimism. But it would be foolish and irresponsible,<br />
I believe, of Government to say, oh well, we can simply explain<br />
these figures away, that we are certain we are going sufficientlyquickly<br />
on the right course. I think it is an exercise in<br />
responsibility to pick up this opportunity of discussion and<br />
get the views of everyone involved.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why didn't the Government then initiate it?<br />
PM: Well, I have indicated that we had considered the possibility<br />
perhaps of having such a meeting.<br />
JOURNALIST: But done nothing?<br />
PM: Well, I don't really think was saying that<br />
we had considered the possibility and the relevance of such a<br />
meeting at some stage. We hadn't felt it imperative to have it<br />
now to make decisions the people involved<br />
themselves at a relevant meeting made the suggestion that they<br />
thought it would be a good idea then it was a perfectly<br />
sensible thing to say, alright let's do it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Given what you have been saying in the last<br />
couple of days about wage restraint, do you think the unions<br />
would wear any deferral of the current superannuation decision<br />
or any further cutbacks in wages?<br />
Pm: Well, I don't know Paul. I understand there were three<br />
represenatives of the ACTU at the meeting. That was Mr Crean,<br />
Mr Kelt, and Mr Mac~ ean. And I understand that there is a<br />
meeting of the ACTU Executive in the week after next. Now<br />
obviously any position and attitude of the ACTU would have to<br />
come out of the meetings of the ACTU Executive. But I think<br />
it is relevant that the leadership of the ACTU has said<br />
that such a meeting would be appropriate in that anything<br />
could be on the table. So that doesn't mean, I mean you can't<br />
draw a conclusion from that that they are signalling any<br />
agreement to specific courses of action. I think that it's<br />
a good scene that both the trade unions anid theemployers are<br />
going into a discussion with Government about this important<br />
issue<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime ' Minister, in view of the serious nature of<br />
the discussions....... would you consider making it open so<br />
that... PM: No. I wouldn't I don't think it is appropriate an issue<br />
like this when I don't think that meetings of EPAC and ACPI<br />
be facilitated in the way only broad sort of discussion that<br />
needs at least to take place the public. But<br />
I can assure you Ken, that following the meeting we will<br />
endeavour to convey as much as we usefully can. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: A large part of the economic problems are caused<br />
by Australia's farming crisis and yet the National Farmers'<br />
Federation are not represented in ACPI. They are already<br />
making a noise in Australia about not getting an invite.<br />
Do they warrant<br />
PM: I don't think so. They will have the opportunity if they<br />
wish to to put their views to the existing business organisations.<br />
And if they want to put some new material the Government in<br />
writing which they regard as appropriate they can do that. But<br />
they have made detailed submissions about their views on<br />
economic policy. We are not unaware of them. But I repeat if<br />
they wish to make some new submissions to us then we would<br />
be prepared to hear from them as to what they have got to say.<br />
