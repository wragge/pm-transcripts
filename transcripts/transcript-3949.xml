PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH AT PUBLIC MEETING, ALICE SPRINGS<br />
1 NOVEMBER 1975<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen: I've had along standing engagement this week<br />
down in Port Augusta, but I thought that in the present circumstances,<br />
the time when the Senate is on strike, when it's holding the whole<br />
of the country to ransom, when there is going to be an election in<br />
the next few months for the Senate, and because despite all Country<br />
Party obstruction the people of the Territory will at last get a vote<br />
for Senators in the National Parliament,. it is the people in the<br />
Northern Territory and in Canberra who will break to strike by the<br />
Senate. And I'll give you some of the consequences of this strike.<br />
Because the two Territories, the Northern Territory and the Capital<br />
Territory, depend more than any other parts of Australia on what is<br />
in the National Budget. And for the first time in the country's<br />
history the Budget is being stalled. It's not been rejected; it's<br />
been stalled. The Senate hasn't gone on record against the Budget;<br />
as a matter of fact, they see nothing wrong with the Budget. They<br />
say if there is an election they'll pass the Budget the Budget must<br />
* be beaut. But they've tried,. But they've gone on strike. They won'tt<br />
vote on the Budget. And they've stalled it on one particular dirty<br />
Country Party trick. Three months ago, a Labor Senator died in<br />
Queensland. And a Country Party Premier appointed an anti-Labor man<br />
to succeed the deceased Labor Senator.<br />
Now don't blame the Liberal Ministers in Queensland because they<br />
voted to do the right thing. Every Liberal Minister in the Queensland<br />
Parliament voted in favour of a Labor replacement for the deceased<br />
Labor $ enator. But it was the Country Party Ministers, the Country<br />
Party Premier, the Country Party and Liberal rank and file who<br />
perpetrated this dirty trick. They chose an anti-Labor Senator to<br />
succeed a Labor Senator and accordingly when a motion was moved in<br />
the Senate to put off voting on the Budget, to defer the Budget, to<br />
stall the Budget, to go on strike, the motion was carried only because<br />
a Labor Senator had died. If the Labor Senator had still been there,<br />
if, a he had throughout his life., voted in favour of Labor principles<br />
then the attempt ' by the Count ry' Party to defeat, to defer, to stall*<br />
the Buidget would have been frustrated. As Senator Steele Hall said,<br />
a former Liberal Premier of South Australia,* the motion to go on<br />
strike in the Senate was carried over a dead man's corpse. ' If a<br />
Country Party Premier had done the right thing and had appointed a<br />
Labor replacement for a deceased Labor Senator, then the plot to go<br />
on strike would not have been carried in the Senate. The Senate<br />
would have had to vote for the Budget. And if there is a vote on<br />
the Budget itself, then it will be passed in the Senate. Because<br />
on T. V. last weekend a Liberal Senator, from Tasmania T. you might<br />
never have heard of him, his name is Bessel) Senator Bessell said<br />
that he would never vote against the Budget and he also said that<br />
there were a number of other Liberal Senators of the'same mind. That<br />
means that the Budget would be passed if it ever came to a vote. But<br />
it's not being passed for the sole reason, that the Senate has gone<br />
on strike.<br />
Now let me show you the results of this strike by the Senate.<br />
Because in the Budget there is a total for the Northern Territory<br />
of '$ 439 million, $ 439 m'illion will come to the Northern<br />
Territory as soon as the Budge---is passed. And this $ 439 million<br />
is being held up, it's being denied to the Northern Territory </p>
<p>because the Liberal and Country Party Senators have gone on strike.<br />
* Now up in the top, in Darwin, there is $ l02* million waiting<br />
to reconstruct Darwin. It's being held up by the Senate strike;<br />
-$ 102. rmillion. And then for housing and construction throughout<br />
the Territory, on top of that, housing and construction which in the<br />
Territory depend principally on Federal Government funds, there is<br />
$ 58 million being held up by the Senate strike. Once the<br />
Senate passes the Budget then this year there will be .$ 58 million<br />
available for housing and construction in the Northern Territory<br />
It's being held up by the Senate strike. And then for schools<br />
and colleges in the Territory, there is a sum of $ 45 mnillion.<br />
being held up by the Senate. The Senate strike is denying the<br />
Territory $ 45 million for education. Then for health services,<br />
hospitals, health centres) there is * the sum of $ 40 ' Million being<br />
held up by the Senate strike. Once the Senate calls off its strike<br />
there will be 40 million dollars available for hospitals and health<br />
services in the Territory. And then for* all the rest of<br />
the-functions which the Department of Northern Australia provides<br />
in the-Territory there is a sum of $ 113 million being held<br />
up by the Senate strike. And then for Aboriginal welfare and<br />
advancement there is a sum of '$ 32 million. being held up by<br />
the Senate strike.<br />
Now Ladies and Gentlemen, the strike may finally be broken by having<br />
elections for Senators in the Northern Territory and the Capital<br />
Territory. And I will give to you the long-protracted fight we've had<br />
to have in the Federal Parliament over the last three years to get<br />
the right. for people in the Territories to elect people to the<br />
Senate and to have votes for the people in the Senate. The Country<br />
Party and the Liberal Parties have put up the longest battle against<br />
this reform that they've put up on any issue whatever.<br />
Now first, you'll remember that back in my 1972 Policy Speech I<br />
promised that if we became the Government there would be Senators<br />
for the two Territori'es with full voting rights. Two Senators for<br />
the Northern Territory. Two Senators for the Australian Capital<br />
Territory. And I'm on the platform here with Labor's candidate<br />
as Senators for the Northern Territory, Ted Robertson and<br />
Kevin Frazer. Now this is one of the good Fra * zer' s. I don't think<br />
the other Fraser has ever been to the Northern Territory. Well<br />
I don't think Billy Snedden -you remember Billy Snedden, he was once<br />
Leader of the Liberals And I don't think he came here. And I don't<br />
remember Billy McMahon coming here. And I don't remember John Gorton<br />
' coming here, or Harold Holt, or Bob Menzies, that is, Liberal<br />
Prime MinistersrLiberal Leaders never came to the Northern Territory.<br />
I don't think Menzies or Holt, or Gorton, or McMahon, or Snedden or<br />
Fraser. I'm sick of the constant change.<br />
. I'm ih the process of doing over the fifth successive<br />
Liberal Leader. And I don't think any of them ever bothered to hold<br />
a meeting in Alice Springs. We did last last election in May,. ' 74,<br />
* but-. they never came here. Because they didn't have elections for<br />
the Senate. They didn't have to worry about you. But we promised<br />
at the last electionsthat we would see that the Northern Territory<br />
got representatives'in the Senate. Because you have to obey laws<br />
which are passed by the Federal Parliament, both the House of<br />
Representatives and the Senate. But according to the Liberals and<br />
the Country Party you weren't entitled to have-anybody in the Senate<br />
which had to make those laws. And because you will now have members in<br />
the Senate you will be able to break the log jam that the Senate<br />
has presented over the last three years. Because in the last three </p>
<p>years, the last three years, the Senate has rejected more Bills<br />
than it had in the previous" 72 years. In all the years between 1901<br />
and 1972 the Senate had rejected, all told, less than 70 Bills.<br />
In the last three years the Senate has rejected over * 90 Bills.<br />
So they've been more obstructive than any Senate in history.<br />
Three years: they've done more to throw out than they had in the<br />
previous 72. But this is what they've done about the Territory.<br />
Is there anybody in this audience who doesn't think the Territory<br />
should have representatives in the Senate? -Will you please raise<br />
your hand if you think that the Northern Territory shouldn't have<br />
a Senator? There's 2 people; there were 3 hands and 2 people. Is<br />
this the best you can do?-Aren't there any people who'll support<br />
the Liberals and the Country Party in denying the Territory<br />
* representation in the Senate? I just want to go back, that is, I<br />
want to tell the House of Representatives next week that in this,<br />
the largest political meeting ever held in the Northern Territory, 4<br />
there were only 2 people that were prepared to say that the Northern<br />
Territory shouldn't have members in the Senate. Because this is the<br />
history, this is the history of ourattempts to get representation in.<br />
the Senate for the Northern Territory-We brought in the Bill on<br />
the 30 May 19731 two and a half years ago in the House of RepresentativeE'<br />
we passed the Bill to give the Northern Territory two Senators. That<br />
is~ two and a half years ago. The Liberals voted against it. Gorton.,<br />
McMahon, Snedden, Fraser, they all voted against you having<br />
representatives in the Senate. The Country Party voted with us in<br />
favour of the Northern Territory having Senators. It's the only time<br />
the Country Party has ever voted for you to have representatives in<br />
the Senate and when it went to the Senate every member of the Liberal<br />
Party, every member of the Country Party and the DLP you<br />
remember the DLPI'? they voted against you having representatives.<br />
So that was the first time.<br />
On the 7 June 1973 the Opposition in the Senate denied you having<br />
representatives in the Senate. Then three months later we brought<br />
the Bill in again and on the. 27 September 1973 it went through t'-he<br />
House of Representatives; for the second time the House of Representatives<br />
said you should have Senators from the Northern Territory.<br />
It went up to the Senate and on the 14 November 1973 all the Liberal<br />
and Country Party Senators, all of them, voted to defeat the Bill.<br />
That meant the next election, the election in May last year for the<br />
House of Representatives and the Senate, you couldn't get Senators<br />
because the Liberal and the Country Party voted against you getting<br />
them. And you remember in May 1974 in this town I repeated that if<br />
we were returned once again we would try to get you Senators for the<br />
Northern Territory. And we won the election. We won the second time.<br />
And then we brought the Bill up again and in the House of<br />
it was passed for the third time. And for the third time the Senate<br />
rejected it; every Liberal, every Country Party Senator, on three<br />
occasions has voted against the Northern Territory having Senators.<br />
So then we had a Joint Sitting and at the joint sitting all the<br />
Liberals and all the Country Party, with one exception your Country<br />
Party member never speaks; silent Sam never has a word to say,<br />
but for once in his life he did the right thing; he voted for you<br />
to have representatives in the Senate. And such influence does he<br />
have on his Country Party colleagues that they all. left him alone<br />
and voted with the Liberals against you having Senators for the<br />
Northern Territory. </p>
<p>if the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory<br />
had had Senators, then the Senate would not have goneon Strike.<br />
Because this is what the strike is costing the Northern Territory:<br />
$ 439 million is being held up for the Northern Territory; $ 439<br />
million is being held up for the Northern Territory by the Senate<br />
strike. And $ 58 million is being held up because the Senators from<br />
the* States have gone on strike and $ 45 million is being held<br />
up because the Liberal and Country Party Senators from the States<br />
have gone on strike. And aboriginal welfare and advancement in.<br />
the Northern Territory is being denied $ 32 million; the Liberal<br />
and Country Party Senators have gone on strike. And hospitals and<br />
health services in the Northern Territory are being denied $ 40 million<br />
because the Liberal and Country Party Senators from the States have<br />
gone on strike. And schools and colleges, Government and Church<br />
schools and colleges, in the Northern Territory are being denied<br />
million because the Liberal and Country Party Senators from<br />
the States have gone on strike. All help and all the affairs<br />
of the Department of Northern Australia are being held up because<br />
$ 113 million for administrative services to pay employees, to pay<br />
contractors, to pay suppliers~ is being held up $ 113 million being<br />
held up for the Department of Northern Australia because the Liberal<br />
and Country Party Senators from the States have gone on strike.<br />
All told therem$ 439 million waiting to come<br />
tothe Northern Territory between now and the end of next June<br />
because the State Senators, the Liberal and Country Party Senators<br />
from the States have gone on strike.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen) I know perfectly well the attitude of the people<br />
of this Territory. Never again will you allow the Senate to go on<br />
strike. Never again, never again will the Senate be able to hold<br />
the Teriitories up to ransom. Because the Territories more than<br />
any other parts of Australia depend on the National Budget for their<br />
welf are, their prosperity and their progress. If the Liberals<br />
and the Country Party had not prevented the Northern Territory having<br />
Senators since May last year, if you'd had Senators from the Northern<br />
Territorythe Senate wouild not have gone on strike. The Northern<br />
Territory would be getting the $ 439 million to which it is entitled<br />
without interruption.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen , when the election comes don't forget to make<br />
Ted Robertson and Kevin Frazer the first Senators from the Northern<br />
Territory. Never again allow the Senate to hold up the welfare,<br />
prosperity, and progress of the Northern Territory. Never again<br />
allow State Senators to go on strike. </p>
