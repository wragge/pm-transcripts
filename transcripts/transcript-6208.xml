    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>23 September 1983</strong></p>
<p>Today's Arbitration Commission judgement in the National WageÂ Case is consistent with the Government's strategy for nationalÂ economic recovery.</p>
<p>I particularly welccme the Commission's strong statement thatÂ the general wage adjustments will be made only in thoseÂ awards where the unions involved give a public and unequivocalÂ commitment not to make extra claims.</p>
<p>The Commission's assessment of the current state of theÂ economy, following its hearing of detailed evidence fromÂ all parties, supports the government's understanding.Â There are signs of improvement in the economy, and these willÂ need to be nurtured.</p>
<p>The Comnmission, like the Government, believes that in presentÂ circumstanccs a centralised wage-setting system would leadÂ to a more stable industrial environment and that it wouldÂ provide the basis for a more rapid economic recovery than<br />would occur in any alternative system.</p>
<p>The new principles outlined by the Commission represent aÂ workable system for ensuring that economic recovery is notÂ frustrated by premature increases in real wages.</p>
<p>The Commission's judgement imposes firm oblicgations andÂ responsibilities on unions, employers, governments, andÂ State tribunals. All parties must accept commitment toÂ these requirements for the system to work.</p>
<p>For our part, the Government will be doing everythingÂ within its power to ensure that the system is not onlyÂ workable, but in fact does play its part in leading toÂ national economic recovery.</p>
