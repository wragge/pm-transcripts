    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Well, we’ve just seen an extraordinary story of Australian innovation, advanced manufacturing. The most advanced microphones in the world made here, right from the start.</p>
<p>You have seen those brass and aluminium bars in the shed. Out of this manufacturing process here in Sydney, here in Australia, you have the most advanced microphones in the world.</p>
<p>94 per cent of your sales are exports. Peter, it is an extraordinary achievement. It brings together everything that Craig Laundy and I, the Assistant Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science are seeking to do and the whole government is seeking to do - backing Australian enterprise.</p>
<p>Peter Freedman and his team have proved that Australians can do anything. They can be the best in the world. But you have to have those big markets to sell to. You have to have the environment that supports you.</p>
<p>That is why everything we are doing, we are seeking to ensure affordable, reliable and secure energy, and meet our emissions targets, because Australian businesses need to have affordable and reliable electricity that they can depend on.</p>
<p>Also, they need those big export markets. You can’t get rich just selling things to Australians, you need to have a bigger canvas.</p>
<p>And what Peter has done - think about this - in the last year, there were 100,000 new jobs in manufacturing in Australia. Manufacturing is growing in Australia. In the last year, Peter has employed another 70 people alone, here in Silverwater in Sydney. And how has he done that? He has done that through investment.</p>
<p>That is why we’ve got our Enterprise Tax Plan, to ensure that businesses are able to invest more because as they invest more, just as Peter has shown, they employ more. They can get out and market. Well, you are a great marketer, a great salesman. You have gone out there and sold to the world this extraordinary product.</p>
<p>This is a great Australian story of success and it brings together all of the elements that we are delivering. More affordable reliable energy, big export markets, more free trade deals to get into more markets, more ability of business to invest. That is why those enterprise tax cuts are so important. And overlaying it all, innovation. Australian innovation, Australian technology.</p>
<p>Some people say I talk about innovation too much. Well let me tell you, this would not be a business without innovation. This is an innovation business, and to succeed, we are an innovation nation. This is where jobs are being created, here in manufacturing, in Australia, beating the world. But we need the support of reliable, affordable energy. We need the support of more enterprise tax cuts to enable businesses to invest. And we need the opportunities of those big export markets. That is what we are delivering, supporting great Australian businesses like Rode.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong>Prime Minister, what is it like running a government where your predecessor appears to be knifing you in the back?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Look, I don't think Australians are very impressed by that latest outburst and I am not going to be distracted by it.</p>
<p>The issues Australians want me to be focused on is ensuring that they have affordable and reliable energy. That businesses have the ability to invest and employ. That our kids and grandkids have the opportunities to have great jobs in the future.</p>
<p>So I am not going to be distracted by outbursts like that. We all know what it is about.</p>
<p>As Mathias Cormann said, it’s sad.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong>You told 3AW this morning that Mr Abbott knows exactly what he is doing. What did you mean by that then?</p>
<p><strong>PRME MINISTER: </strong>Exactly what I said.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong>Prime Minister, Mathias Cormann, this morning, as you say, described Tony Abbott’s comments as ‘sad’. He also said they were destabilising, destructive and wrong. Have you dispatched Mathias Cormann to punish Tony Abbott and to blow up Tony Abbott because you’re concerned he’s going to blow up your party?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Mathias Cormann is a very experienced member of the Senate. He is a very experienced member of my team, a very senior member of my team. He spoke - you heard what he said. I think the views he expressed would be shared by many, many people in Australia and in the Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong>You say you won’t be distracted by it. You say you’re not going to be distracted by it, but it is, but it obviously is distracting. Is it time –</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>No, it’s distracting you. It’s distracting you. With great respect, it’s distracting you, it’s not distracting me.</p>
<p>I am focused on delivering for Australian families by ensuring that they have affordable and reliable energy, by ensuring that businesses have the markets where they can export and grow jobs.</p>
<p>What an extraordinary story this is. You may want to talk about an outburst on television last night. Peter Freedman has got, in one of the most competitive markets in the world, the best microphones. Rode microphones, they’re legendary, they are sold around the world.</p>
<p><strong>ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY, INNOVATION AND SCIENCE: </strong>They are sitting on top of your cameras.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Yep - you have them on your cameras here. And in a country where people say, where Bill Shorten would say that manufacturing is dying, Shorten is always going around saying that manufacturing is at an end. Here you see exactly the way in which manufacturing is growing. 70 new jobs just here. This business grew its labour force by 30 per cent and by the use of technology and automation.</p>
<p>Not only has Peter been able to grow his workforce here, and his production, but he is able to compete with the best in the world, including in markets where labour costs are lower.</p>
<p>So this is a great Australian story.</p>
<p>I am not distracted by political outbursts. I am focused on Australian jobs. That is what people want their Prime Minister to be focused on.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST: </strong>Given that Tony Abbott then is drowning out your message, because that is essentially what is happening, is it time that you had a sit down meeting with him and nut this out? And if you haven't done that, why not?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>Look, I have said all I need to say. The outburst is one that is distracting you. It is not distracting me. Mathias Cormann has described it and characterised it perfectly, succinctly and accurately.</p>
<p>My job is to focus on Australians’ jobs, their futures, their businesses, their opportunities. That is what I am doing and that is what I will continue doing.</p>
<p>Just remember this - in the last six months or so, my government has delivered more through the senate, through the whole parliament, then we did in the last three years.</p>
<p>I don't just give speeches about restoring the rule of law to the construction sector. My government has legislated the restoration of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. It is the law of the land.</p>
<p>I don't just give speeches about getting rid of politicians' gold passes and enabling ex-ministers and members to fly around the country at the public's expense. Do you know what I did? I abolished them. I have abolished them.</p>
<p>I don't just talk about parliamentary entitlements. I have set up a completely new structure to oversight them and manage them so that people know politicians' expenses are being dealt with properly.</p>
<p>I do not just talk about cutting taxes. I have cut them. My government has not put up personal income tax - it has reduced it. Done, tick, gone through the parliament. Half a million Australians on middle incomes are not moving in, over the next three years, into the second-highest tax bracket because of the reforms we delivered.</p>
<p>We didn't just talk about reforming superannuation. We have done it. So right across the board, we are delivering. We have got fewer seats in the house and fewer seats in the senate, that is true, but we are getting more done. Australians expect me to get on with the job. You may be distracted, so may others. I'm not.</p>
<p>Thanks very much, good to see you all.</p>
