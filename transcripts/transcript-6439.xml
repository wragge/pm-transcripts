EMBARGOED UNTIL 9.00 P. M. CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, DINNER IN HONOUR OF<br />
DR MAHATHIR, PRIMIE MINISTER OF, MALAYSIA<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE CANBERRA 9 AUGUST 1984<br />
Dr Mahathir, Dr Seri Hasmah, distinguished guests, ladies<br />
and gentlemen.<br />
It gives me very particular pleasure to welcome you all here<br />
tonight. I recall1 with special feeling my own visit to Malaysia in<br />
February this year. The warmth, hospitality and<br />
understanding accorded me by you, Dr Mahathir, was of a kind<br />
extended only as between friends. It said a great deal for<br />
the friendship and respect which marks the relations between<br />
our two countries arid guaranteed both the success of that<br />
visit and a sound foundation for the continued development<br />
of close ties between Australia anid Malaysia.<br />
Your visit here, Prime Minister, now affords us the<br />
opportunity to build on that base and to give shape to a<br />
future in which we can, in a spirit of mutual co-operation,<br />
secure the conditions necesspry for regional peace and<br />
security. We can also, from that base, consolidate the already very<br />
close links that exist between our two great countries.<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
It would be easy for me now to stress the closeness of our<br />
historical links the ways in which both our countries have<br />
successfully co-operated in the past. These links of course<br />
exist and we value them. But at the same time as drawing<br />
on the experience of the past, the principle concern for<br />
both Australia and Malaysia should be with the present, and<br />
the future. </p>
<p>Prime Minister,<br />
My Government's starting point in its international<br />
relations is that Australia is an integral part of the<br />
Asia-Pacific region not only geographically but<br />
economically and politically. My Government is intent on<br />
coming to grips with the consequences of this reality.<br />
We are moving systematically and deliberately to put into<br />
place the type of policies necessary to secure an effective<br />
and productive integration of Australian interests with<br />
those of our regional neighbours.<br />
It goes without saying that our Government will not be<br />
deflected from this course by racist attitudes of the kind<br />
recently expressed by a small and unrepresentative minority<br />
in Australia.<br />
Both Malaysia and Australia recognise the economic dynamism<br />
of this region and the opportunities it presents. The<br />
Japanese economy is undergoing continued industrial<br />
transformation at the frontier of technology; an<br />
increasingly outward looking China is achieving impressive<br />
early success with its modernisation plans; and continued<br />
growth at spectacular rates is being achieved in the<br />
Republic of Korea and several of the ASEAN nations including<br />
Malaysia. These developments have had a profound impact on trade and<br />
economic relations between all countries of the region and<br />
between the region and the world at large. The strong<br />
growth consistently achieved by the countries of the region<br />
has ensured the Asia-Pacific area a vital role in the<br />
maintenance of global economic prosperity.<br />
As you yourself, Prime Minister, recently observed, it is<br />
for the countries of this region " to seek out new frontiers<br />
and to promote sustained growth since the old<br />
established industrial nations can no longer be relied upon<br />
exclusively to provide the engine of growth in world trade".<br />
In this regard it is disappointing that the two-way trade<br />
between Australia and Malaysia has grown only slowly over<br />
the last five years by comparison with the growth throughout<br />
the 19701s. This is despite the fact that in the past three<br />
years we have seen six Malaysian Trade Missions visit<br />
Australia, two major trade displays, six technical and<br />
marketing seminars, four investment missions to Australia,<br />
and three visits to Malaysia by groups of senior Australian<br />
businessmen. Australia will continue supporting such trade<br />
promotion measures. </p>
<p>Prime Minister,<br />
I am aware that Malaysia's trade imbalance with Australia<br />
has been one of its largest bilateral deficits and that<br />
Malaysia is anxious to redress the imbalance.<br />
My own view is that if the multilateral trading system is<br />
working effectively there will inevitably be some deficits<br />
in some bilateral trading relationships. In itself, this<br />
should not be regarded as a cause for particular concern.<br />
There would, however, be valid grounds for concern when the<br />
imbalance arises out of artificial restrictions on trade.<br />
In the latter circumstances the objective should be the<br />
removal, within a manageable time-frame, of such<br />
restrictions. Prime Minister,<br />
You would doubtless be encouraged that the 1983/ 84<br />
provisional figures show a significant decrease in the trade<br />
imbalance in 1983/ 84 a drop from $ 265.5 million in 1982/ 83<br />
to only $ 212.1 million this year. While doubtless some<br />
measure of imbalance is likely to persist, the steps we have<br />
taken to redress the imbalance have had some effect.<br />
These steps include the Australian system of tariff<br />
preferences, the Australia/ Asean Trade and Investment<br />
Promotion Program, the Early Warning System on Australia's<br />
industries assistance process, and the gradual<br />
liberalisation of access to Australia's textile, clothing,<br />
footware and timber product markets. Australia, for its<br />
part, will continue to refine and develop measures such as<br />
these so as to ensure steady growth in the two-way trade<br />
between our two countries.<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
Our countries have tremendous human and natural resources.<br />
The challenge to both our countries is to capitalise on the<br />
opportunities which our location and resource endowments<br />
provide. The results are. likely to be most satisfying if the approach<br />
adopted is one of co-operative endeavour between all<br />
countries of the region.<br />
In this regard the recent agreement by ASEAN and its five<br />
regional dialogue partners, including Australia, to embark<br />
on a new Pacific Economic Co-operative venture, initially<br />
through the launching of a full-scale human resources<br />
development program, must stand as a landmark decision. it<br />
offers a basis on which vie can enhance present patterns of<br />
co-operation and ensure the achievement of an ever-growing<br />
number of circles of common endeavour. </p>
<p>It was this spirit which motivated my proposal in Bangkok<br />
last November that, in the light of suggestions of a new<br />
multilateral trade round, the countries of the region should<br />
identify interests they shared in such a round and consider<br />
how most effectively they might secure attention to those<br />
interests. The success of the subsequent Denpasar meeting<br />
and of the consultations that have ensued has been most<br />
encouraging. Indeed, the pattern of contact established on those trade<br />
issues is something I believe we should be encouraging still<br />
further, not simply on trade and economic matters, but<br />
across the full range of areas in which the countries of<br />
this region have shared interests.<br />
A relatively simple but critically important element in this<br />
involves the need to promote more extensive person-to-person<br />
contacts between our two peoples -t both official and<br />
non-official levels. A notably large number of Australian<br />
sponsored visit programs already exist. I nevertheless<br />
believe that a more flexible approach to the administration<br />
of these Australian schemes might contribute to a more<br />
productive pattern of contact between Australia and<br />
countries of the region. With this aim in mind, a review of<br />
Australia's present sponsored visit schemes is to be<br />
undertaken. On some matters, there will, however, obviously be a need<br />
for more concerted approaches. One such area of particular<br />
importance to Australia's relations with Malaysia is that of<br />
trade and economic policy. I believe the time has come when<br />
we should formalise the many contacts we have on these<br />
issues and have therefore suggested the establishment of an<br />
Australia/ Malaysia Joint Trade Committee. Such a<br />
development will be an important extension of the already<br />
close relationship between our two countries. Your in principle suppo<br />
Dr Mahathir, for this proposal has been greatly appreciated.<br />
Contacts of this kind will, however, only be productive if<br />
they take place within a framework of adequate policy<br />
approaches at the national level.<br />
For Australia this means pursuing internationally conditions<br />
conducive to an open international trade environment. At<br />
the domestic level, it means ensuring dedication of our<br />
resources to those activities in which Australians are most<br />
productive. The multilateral liberalisation of trade and the creation<br />
domestically of conditions conducive to such a regime are<br />
fundamental to the attainment and maintenance of both<br />
national and international economic growth and prosperity.<br />

1( t. i p </p>
<p>Hence the emphasis we are now giving in Australia to the<br />
need for a sound approach to the restructuring of<br />
Australia's industrial base. We regard it as axiomatic that<br />
if we are to raise Australian living standards, to provide<br />
full employment for our people, and to enter into full and<br />
effective partnership with the countries of the region, then<br />
we must raise productivity and improve our international<br />
competitiveness. This we are now seeking to do. Through a combination of<br />
domestic economic policies which are restoring Australia to<br />
a non-inflationary growth path, and, through carefully<br />
co-ordinated sectoral restructuring initiatives of the kind<br />
we have already undertaken in the motor vehicle and steel<br />
industries, we are seeking to establish Australia as a<br />
competitive, outward-looking and responsible participant in<br />
the international economic scene.<br />
The reforms we are undertaking in the Australian financial<br />
system are an essential component of our policies for<br />
improving our industrial structure and for promoting<br />
long-term growth.<br />
Together these measures reflect a keen appreciation of the<br />
economic and trading realities of the contemporary world and<br />
a determination to take full advantage of' Australia's<br />
abilities and potential.<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
Following your Government's initiative, and at its specific.<br />
request, I am pleased to tell you that, assuming all major<br />
producers within the region are prepared to do likewise,<br />
Australia is ready to make a cash contribution to the buffer<br />
stock of the Sixth International Tin Agreement. This would<br />
total 3.2 million English pounds, representing half of the<br />
Australian contribution otherwise made in the form of tin<br />
metal at the commencement of the Agreement.<br />
I welcome the initiatives already taken by Malaysia in this<br />
area and would hope that Malaysia, as the world's largest<br />
tin producer, will continue to pursue efforts aimed at<br />
securing the early restoration of stability and growth in<br />
the industry.<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
Australia aims to be a contributor as well as beneficiary of<br />
economic progress within our own region. This can only be<br />
to the benefit of countries such as Malaysia which are so<br />
particularly well placed to capitalise on the opportunities<br />
being created. S1'~ . r </p>
<p>It will also see Australia bidding competitively for major<br />
projects within the region. The recent acceptance by the<br />
Malaysian Government of Leighton's bid for the Telok Intan<br />
Hospital project was greatly appreciated here in Australia<br />
and will I hope be but a forerunner of a new type of<br />
involvement of Australian companies with the development of<br />
the region.<br />
This is not to gainsay the quality and continuing<br />
significance for both our countries of well-established<br />
patterns of co-operation.<br />
Prime Minister,_<br />
I know the importance you attach to the continued provision<br />
of places at Australian education instituiions for Malaysian<br />
students. I can assure you that Australia, to the extent it<br />
is able, intends continuing to develop its role as a source<br />
of educational services to the countries of the region.<br />
This we see as a positive and firm foundation to good<br />
relations and to our mutual understanding.<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
Defence co-operation has been another area of importance to<br />
both our countries. My Government's continued commitment to<br />
our Australian presence at Butterworth underlines the<br />
importance we continue to attach to our shared defence<br />
interests. Indeed the manner in which we were able early this year so<br />
quickly and effectively to agree on a mutually acceptable<br />
formula for the maintenance of the Australian presence at<br />
Butterworth was suggestive of a new order of confidence<br />
between Australia and Malaysia.<br />
It is my sincerest hope, Prime Minister, that, following<br />
your present visit, in the company of so many Ministers,<br />
officials and senior businessmen, the grounds for that<br />
enhanced confidence will be still further strengthened. The<br />
people of both our countries, and of the wider Asia-Pacific<br />
region, have a strong interest in this successful outcome. </p>
