The Coi-alonw-e: alth put b.-fore the States proposals which would have<br />
produc ~ d an incre ase in the total funds available to State s and th-ir<br />
aut'horitie s from these sources in 1967-63 of about 10 per ce-nt.<br />
As a re sult of th: e discussions with the: States, howve: r, the<br />
prospe ctive incre! ase is nowi estimatad at n. arly 13" j pe-r cent.<br />
T-he Comrcionwaalth agree! d to support a borrowinig programme for<br />
S'tat works and housinng purnoses in 1067-60 of $ 677 million. This is ' 32<br />
mllion more taan the: V1966-67 programme. </p>
<p>It was also agreed that the total borrowing programmes of<br />
' semi-governmental" authorities in the Stata. should be $ 311 million<br />
in 1967-60, or $ 43 million riore than the 1966-67 programm.<br />
It was also decided that there would ba no limit on the overall<br />
level of borrowings by State authorities which borrow less than $ 300, 0CW<br />
in a year. This means that authorities which had previously proposed<br />
to borrovi between 21C, Ca0n d $ 300, CC a year will no longer have<br />
to be accommodated in the States' ' semi-governmental' borrowinZ<br />
programm s. Consequantly, the smi-rov ernmental" borrowing<br />
programme will now be shared by a smaller number of authorities. In<br />
addition, those authorities whosea borrowin3s have been less than<br />
$ rC3, C00 will, with the approval of their State Premiers, be able to<br />
increase their borrowings up to a maximum $ 30, 400 without coming<br />
within the ' semi-govarnmental borrowing programme-s.<br />
The estimates the States had prepared envisaged " local<br />
authority' borrowings of about $ 73 million in 1967-68. As a result of<br />
the increase in the limit to $ 300, CC0 it seems highly likely that<br />
borrowings by local authorities as now defined will be considerably<br />
hiTher in 1967-63.<br />
The Commonwealth also agreed to provide direct financial<br />
assistance to Tasmania in respect of the financing of its hydro-electric<br />
programme associated with developments in the Gordon River area.<br />
Takin,-account of this, Commronwealth specific payments to the States<br />
for capital purposes are estimated to increase by about $ 73 million in<br />
1967-60. Thus the funds available to the States and their authorities in<br />
1967-63 for capital works purposes under the Loan Council ' orrowing<br />
programmes and from specific purpose capital paymert s are now<br />
estimated to total about $ 1,430 million. That will be close to $ 160<br />
million or almost 13 per cent mrore than in 196-67.<br />
7inancial Assistance Grants<br />
The Frirnme linister recall. d that, at the February 1907 Fr cmi rs'<br />
Conference, it vwas agreed to alter the grants formula used to calculate<br />
the financial assistance grants so as to reduce the time lag before<br />
increases in average v! ages are reflected in the grants. It was also<br />
agre-d to pay the Ctates a special, non-recurring grant of $ 5 million.<br />
The effect of the decisions taken at the February Premiers'<br />
Conf erence was that the States received a total of $ 026.6 million by way<br />
of financial assistance grants in 1966-67. This was $ 11. 9 million more<br />
than they would have received if the previous formula had continued<br />
to operate and if no special grant had been paid.<br />
At the -remiers' Conference just concluded the Commonwealth<br />
agreed that for purposes of calculating the financial assistance grants<br />
for 1967-6C ( and for future years) the amount of million paid to the<br />
States in '% 63-67 be treated as an addition to the formula grants for that<br />
year. After taking account of this addition of $ 5 million to the base for<br />
d etermnining the 1967-63 grants, it is tentativ ly estimated that the<br />
formula grants payable to the States in 1967-7T will be about $ 900 million.<br />
This would be an increase of about $ 73 million, or about C. 9 per cent,<br />
on the total gants actually paid in 1966-67.<br />
( The final figure of the forimula rants will depend on the<br />
movement in average wages for the twelve months ended Miarch, 1963<br />
and on the increase in each State's population betw: een D: ec ember, 1966 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
and December, 1967. These will not be mown until towards the<br />
end of the 1967-62 financial year.<br />
Commonwealth payromnts to the States in 1967-63 other<br />
than the financial assistanc grants and specific payments for capital<br />
purposes are also expected to show some net increase.<br />
Total Capital and Revenue Funds<br />
As a result of existing arrangements and decisions taken at<br />
the Premiers' Conference and Loan Council iMeeting, the total funds<br />
available to the States in 1967-53 from Commonwealth assistance and<br />
from borrowings for works programmes of the States and their<br />
authorities will be of the order of $ 2,450 million compared v. ith about<br />
200 million estimated to have been receiv ed from these sources<br />
in 1966-67. This would represent an increase of about 11 per cent.<br />
