Press Statement No. 508<br />
4 June 1975<br />
NEWCASTLE WOMEN'S CENTRE<br />
The Australian Government is negotiating the purchase<br />
of Lysaght's Recreation Centre in Newcastle for use as a community<br />
centre for the women of the Newcastle area.<br />
The Prime Minister said the project had been submitted<br />
by the Hunter Region Working Women's Group. It would be<br />
funded through grants from the Hospital and Health Services<br />
Commission_($ 25,000) the interim committee of the Children's<br />
Commission ($ 42,000) and ' the.* International Women's Year<br />
Committee 41, 2 20). These grants would cover the cost of<br />
the building and essential renovations.<br />
The new centre will enable the Hunter Region Wo-cking<br />
Women's Group to expand. its activities on behalf of women living<br />
and working in Newcastle and surrounding districts. The area<br />
includes many migrant women.<br />
At present the group is using temporary premises in<br />
Newcastle to conduct a women's health centre, through a grant<br />
from the Hospitals and Health Services Commission. The<br />
Attorney-General has agreed to second an officer through the.<br />
Australian Legal Aid Office-to provide legal advice for women<br />
using the centre. It is planned to develop more general<br />
couns-elling and information services for women in the work force,<br />
so as to involve them more in helping to improve their own working<br />
conditions. Since migrant women tend to be exploited in the<br />
work situation, it is hoped to appoint multi-lingual staff to<br />
the centre who can provide both English classes and special<br />
counselling for women unsure of their rights in their jobs and<br />
in the community at large.<br />
Special child care facilities will be provided by the<br />
centre and an officer appointed to help initiate other childhood<br />
services in the Newcastle community. At the same time,<br />
recreational programs will cater for a wide variety of known<br />
interests, and further research will be undertaken to establish<br />
the educational and recreational needs of women in the area.<br />
It is hoped that centres similar to the Newcastle<br />
working women's centre will be established throughout Australia.<br />
