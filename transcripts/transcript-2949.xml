APTIOTNTMENT OF AUSTRALIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE<br />
POLISH PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC<br />
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Whitlam, announced<br />
today that Mr Francis Stuart had been appointed Australian<br />
Ambassador to the Polish People's Republic. Mr Stuart will be<br />
the first resident Australian Ambassador and will succeed<br />
Mr L. J. Iawrey who has been dually accredited from Moscow.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the decision to accredit a resident<br />
Ambassador in Poland and to establish an Australian diplomatic<br />
mission in Warsaw reflected the Government's wish to develop<br />
closer relations with the Polish People's Republic as part of<br />
Australia's efforts to strengthen its diplomatic representation<br />
in Eastern Europe.<br />
Mr Stuart was born in 1912 and was educated at Geelong<br />
Church of England Grammar School and the University of Oxford.<br />
He joined the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1945 and served in<br />
Paris, Jakarta, Singapore and New Delhi before becoming Head of<br />
Mission. From 1957 to 1961 Mr Stuart was Minister and later<br />
Ambassador to Cambodia. From 1962 to 1966 he was Ambassador in<br />
Cairo and from 1966 to 1970 in Manila. He has recently completed<br />
an appointment as Ambassador to Pakista~ n with concurrent<br />
accreditation as Ambassador to Afghanistan.<br />
Mr Stuart, who is married, is expected to take up his<br />
appointment in September. </p>
