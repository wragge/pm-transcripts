PRESS STATEMENT NO. 563<br />
23 September 1975<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION<br />
The non-Labor parties are demonstrating once<br />
again their 4contempt for the democratic system by boycotting<br />
the Constitutional Convention which opens in Melbourne<br />
tomorrow. The cynicism and hypocrisy of the Opposition is<br />
all the more extraordinary because they have chosen the<br />
opening day of the Convention to release details of their<br />
so-called policy on federalism. The Liberal and National<br />
Country Party leaders, Federal and State, will be in<br />
Melbourne tomorrow for that purpose. By boycotting the<br />
Convention they are doing their best to frustrate the<br />
one ' procedure by which a truly modern and creative federal<br />
system can be evolved.<br />
The boycott is another example of the Opposition's<br />
abuse of political proprieties. Not content with blocking<br />
Government legislation in the Senate, not content with<br />
threateneing to block supply, not content with flouting<br />
the rules on Senate vacancies, not content with abusing<br />
these constitutional conventions, the Opposition and the<br />
non-Labor States are now denouncing the Constitutional<br />
Convention itself. They are serving notice that under no<br />
circumstances will they even discuss changes in a<br />
Constitution which their own spokesmen have acknowledged is in<br />
need of reform. They are not only sabotaging the Convention;<br />
they are thumbing their noses at the Constitution.<br />
The Convention has never been solely a Labor<br />
Party concern. The initiative for it came from the Victorian<br />
Parliament. The Australian Labor Government to k up the<br />
suggestion and organised the first meeting of ( he Convention<br />
two years ago in Sydney. Its purpose w~ as to examine self-evident<br />
deficiencies in the Australian., federal system. Every State,<br />
as well as opposition delegates from the Australian Parliament,<br />
attended the Convention. Useftil progress was made. The<br />
Convention established machinery for continuing work on the<br />
Convention with the apparent support of all delegates. / 2 </p>
<p>Until a few weeks ago all States and our<br />
opponents in the Australian Parliament were pressing for the<br />
Convention to be reconvened. Senator Greenwood said in a<br />
press statement on 24 March 1975:<br />
" The Federal Opposition wants the Constitutional<br />
Convention to continue its work. The immense amnount<br />
of research, deliberations and really worthwhile<br />
ef fort already contributed should not be wasted...<br />
The Opposition parties accept that there is a<br />
need for constitutional change. Experience<br />
has shown that changes will more readily be<br />
accepted if a consensus can be arrived at as to the<br />
particular changes needed. This is what the<br />
Convention can achieve."<br />
The Leader of the Opposition said in the House of<br />
Representatives only a month ago, on 21 August:<br />
" It is our hope that this Convention will be a<br />
useful forum in which State and Federal<br />
representatives may constructively consider<br />
constitutional reform in a way which will advance<br />
the good government of Australia...<br />
The Constitutional Convention does present an<br />
opportuiiity to identify areas where change is<br />
needed. It will ascertain what sort of consensus<br />
exists for change. It will provide a place where<br />
constructive efforts may be made to work out<br />
constitutional reform. For all of these-reasons,<br />
the Opposition is glad that the Constitutional<br />
Convention will be reconvened in Melbourne in<br />
September."<br />
The timetable and agenda for the resumed conference<br />
were determined, not by the Australian Government, but by the<br />
executive committee of the Convention on which the Australian<br />
Government was represented. There were representatives also<br />
of the Opposition, of every State Parliament, the Legislative<br />
Assemblies of the A. C. T. and the Northern Territory and local<br />
government. The date, place and agenda for the resumed meeting<br />
were all agreed upon by 13 August.<br />
Yet on 28 August I received a telegram from the<br />
Premier of Queensland advising that Queensland Government<br />
delegates would not attend the Convention in Melbourne and<br />
that the Premier would be moving that the Queensland<br />
Parliamentary delegation should not attend. Western Australia,<br />
New South Wales and Victoria subsequently took a similar attitude.<br />
No good reason has been given for their change of view. / 3 </p>
<p>A 3.<br />
Despite the obstruction of the non-Labor<br />
parties, the Convention will go ahead. It will meet<br />
tomorrow in the Windsor Hotel since the Victorian Government<br />
has now cancelled its invitation to use Parliament House.<br />
I believe that useful results can still be achieved by the<br />
plenary meeting. For its part, the Australian Government will<br />
press for agreement on amendments to the Constitution<br />
to expand the provisions for the inter-change of<br />
powers and to amend the Constitution to permit the<br />
Australian Parliament to make grants to local government<br />
bodies and raise loans on their behalf.<br />
I believe the Australian Government's attitude<br />
to local government is at the root of the Opposition'ss<br />
boycott. The non-Labor States and the Opposition opposed<br />
even having local government represented at the Convention.<br />
They are now frightened that the Convention will lead to a<br />
proper, developing role for local government in our federal<br />
system. Strong local government has a key role to play<br />
in the provision of needed services. From personal experience<br />
I know the cost of living and working in suburbs long<br />
deprived of proper health, transport, sewerage, housing and<br />
child care services all the things that make for the betterment<br />
and happiness of the Australian people. In my 1972 policy<br />
speech I pledged that local government would be made a<br />
genuine partner in ihe federal system. I declared that direct<br />
representation of local government at the Constitutional<br />
Convention would be a condition of the Australian Government's<br />
participation. In spite of the resistance of our opponents,<br />
we are honouring those pledges. We are determined to have strong<br />
local government properly financed and properly responsive to<br />
local community needs.<br />
F'ar from being centralist, the Australian Government<br />
has proclaimed its determination to bring decision-making closer<br />
to the people. The real centralists are the non-Labor States<br />
who have attempted to frustrate local government. The non-Labor<br />
States want to dominate local government at all costs. They<br />
have even challenged the right of the Territories to<br />
representation and votes in the Federal Parliament. They<br />
have tried to close off our support for local community groups.<br />
This is why the Victorian Government is leading the High<br />
Court challenge to the R. E. D. Scheme and the Australian<br />
Assistance Plan a challenge which imperils a whole range<br />
of local schemes which the Australian Labor Government has<br />
implemented. In Ãµ ' esigning innovative programs like community<br />
health and child care centres, the Australian Government<br />
has been conscious of the need for community groups to plan<br />
and run their own pr; ojects. We want community participation through<br />
community action. T1his will be achieved by vigorous local<br />
government working in harmony-. with Australian Government programs.<br />
These programs will go ahead despite the Opposition's boycott of<br />
tomorrow's Convention.<br />
