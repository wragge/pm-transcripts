FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 51/ 1968<br />
SYDNEY MARCH PAST<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
I was extremely pleased to see such a big crowd to watch<br />
our men back from Vietnam.<br />
The contingents from the three services gave an impressive<br />
display. They are men of whom Australia can be proud.<br />
In talking to some of them later, I felt they were men who<br />
believed they had been doing a job that needed to be done. They were<br />
justifiably proud of their contribution.<br />
CANBERRA 26 April 1968 </p>
