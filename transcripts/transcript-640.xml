Sir, Your J ccellency and Gentlemen<br />
I thirdk this is a splendid toast Australian<br />
Industry, No doi; WLt thlis is a comprellensixe expression.<br />
I can dwell on thte problems of pirimary iLndutry, touch<br />
lig'atly on th e problems of secondary industry and go to<br />
town on -the pro bleri of 1ertiairy incus try,, I tiir tihis<br />
is* splendi. But before i begin -to anako wha,, t you Will be<br />
delighted to know%-will be a very shlort sipeci it'~ s all<br />
right, thle Lord Mayor has, stipul-jated for an hour ( T-aughter)-<br />
* im. Kirby th-inks ho can comp-ss himself withi n thee quarters<br />
of. an houir and so I am goig to make P very short. spe) ch; q<br />
but before I do2 I worild. like to rnak%, asSI usually do, two<br />
orelim-inary Observ. ations,,<br />
The first iLs Tha t' i-hvo bcen h. er e boefore( L gt)<br />
I can remsmlber one year wvIien profit and loss -, ccounts were<br />
ra thler healthy-I-, whien I got a rg~ fL. l goo., d reception and<br />
another year when I froze in my pla~ ce and thel -ic--cagulated<br />
around ine,. ( Laughter) But I wn1 dwell, on thlese thiings.<br />
Thie fact is that, looking a&amp; r-cand i was delighted to<br />
find thaat there aie more yo Lzrg ma. n at the D-irmar than I ever<br />
rememe( ein eoe ( Aplue) o, as your vresident<br />
said to me, this may be merely the resuilt of t! he old adage<br />
tt ur get. n old wihen y-ou -L~ rnk thIe poli-Jcez;. en look<br />
youig, ( Laughl-ter) and of co~ urse, to , ne the pold ceme-. n have<br />
looked childishly you-ag for' years and. year-s,, I ain bound to<br />
s ay t o ycu, Mr, r~ ne th. at whoin I am being drivenl thr oughl<br />
Sydney, your young paliceman 11o doubt wel~ l disciplinted by<br />
you, always sal~ ute meo,, ( lraugt-ter) if I kept a diary I would<br />
makle a note of thtfact, But th.-is ivC. a splendid thiing that<br />
-in this Chiamber in a couna'ry In whicha m-anufactul-ring is going<br />
to be more and%, iore iprattas the population grovis, as the<br />
S-U-rengit[ 1 Of the coU; n'tx7y grows, you sliould have so mrany men who<br />
ar. e young men, I wonder if I could tell you a story about that.<br />
I have tried it on scoebody,, Soma of thle younger among you<br />
may have forgotten thlat by some accident.-Lal circumstance, I was<br />
Prime : KLinister cf the cvuntry in 1939 -it's only 23 years ago<br />
and I hiad * brought bacIh Sir Brudenell Wite, tht great man, to<br />
be Chnief of thle General. S-laff(, 1 was sitting in my office at<br />
tile Victoria Barracks and he came in and we walked into town<br />
together. Some of the mor-e travelled among you will know<br />
Melbo~ urne, I( aughter) There is a road calle-. d St. Kilda Road,<br />
Brudenell White and I, hie being at least fifteen, sixteen,<br />
perhaps seventeen years older tlln me were walking in side<br />
by side. He, slim and elegant and precise and I, as you<br />
might suppose. ( Laughter) We ad thiat day been discus. sing<br />
who oughlt to be given thLe conLmand of a division, because the<br />
War was on,, Brudenell ; daite said to me, " You know. Prime<br />
Minister, ( very courteously) I am a good deal older thllan you<br />
are~ l Aknd I sort of shru-Lgged my sho0ulders at th-Iat i. f a s mwu ch<br />
to says " Well, donft make too much of a poi-' nt of it", you see,<br />
He towantto say to you is that Jit will fallt your<br />
lot tomake many appointments i~ n your time; if you have a man<br />
who has the brains and the character and thle quality and some<br />
experience, never refuse to appoint him because you think he's<br />
too young." Now that was brilliant advice. And he then went<br />
00a &amp; OaO ao/ </p>
<p>on -to add with a wry smile.) and I remeinbcr this because hie<br />
vwas killed in an aircr; ., ft accident only nine months later,<br />
" You know, wh,, en I was first the Chief Staff Officer of the<br />
First Australian I was thirbyfour, and there hoave<br />
been people so kind as to th-ik I didn't vake a moss of .1<br />
Now this is something I have always remembered. And that's<br />
why, whien I walked i~ n b~ tonight, I was so delighited to fee'L<br />
that, hl have suffered froin the older members of the<br />
Chamber, year after year, ( Laughter) theewl b Am<br />
to come when ray success or will be a ble to deal with the bih<br />
and. mpcming and intelli1gent membors or_* the Cliarbor, ( Laugneter)<br />
( Applaus3) el tat' myfis preliminary observatioli,<br />
Hy second is this--I haven~ lu been able to size up<br />
yet completely who Might be here, but 1 have caught the eye<br />
over there or S" ir Frank Packer, and I don't th-ink IL ought<br />
to let the occasion pass, on our, first joint appearance in<br />
your city, withoutv saying that the chall-enge for the, Atmrica's<br />
Cup produced for Aust: calia moregoi~ 1l morc interest, more<br />
ernthusiasm, more news in t'Pe United States of Areica than<br />
anything else I can -rememer, ( 11ozar, ( h~ pplauze) c<br />

yuon behialf' of all of us, th). a-t w aeveyfrtf' to 01ou<br />
and those associatod with. you for' t1-is marvellous peeo<br />
enterprise. ( Hoar, ( plcTa' , r il<br />
Having said. thiat, Sir, 2' coma back -to my toast<br />
Australian Industry -aind as ' T said. l, t~ s a t'r-Irartitoe affair,<br />
but of course I krnow tha-t at hea-rt m-ost of YOU are mar, 7ufac-<br />
Curers and therefore yc-. u are properiy and pi': ofounCLy initerested<br />
iLn secondary indu-stry, There : L oin hp hn r w<br />
things that I want to say toyou about thi. S8<br />
First of' ali, as for ti-io attitude of Austra: lia tGo<br />
nmaniufacturing, th2 ssur; is, closod Every party at every<br />
rphase-4. modern Jaistralian histor-y believes i* n secondary<br />
industry and believes in a polic( y of protaeotion. ( Hear, hear)<br />
( Applause) I amn so oll now and doddering that I can remember<br />
a timo whien people actually argued about protection and free<br />
t r a d It secms intere sting tL. o go back on it,, 1 remember my<br />
father in a lit. tle country village bir-ing the great prcotectionist,<br />
Oddly onougli, he won the .1oca? 1 seat in Par-. liament and as his<br />
protectionist views became better 1kno; wm, ho of cou'rse lost it,<br />
I don't noeod to pursue that line any further. But all those<br />
old false issues have grone, I don't think[ any man would be game<br />
to stand up in any Par-liameont Federal or State and say that<br />
he didn't believe in an effective meaure of protection for<br />
effective Australian secondary industr-y0 And it is theoro,<br />
And so that is where we all st.. and,<br />
flut perhaps we occasionally have a temfttion to<br />
look at our section of industry and to think thnat you can<br />
look at it in a watertight co-_, partzment0OWll, Ilm a manufacturer<br />
and thais is my prime interest and we have, inevitably,<br />
differences from the primary indiistries and the secondary<br />
industries; of course, i-n part1cular, from time to timre, with<br />
the Goverrnment" ( whiich always means tha Covex'ninment c~ f t-e<br />
Commonwealth) ( Laughter). Now, gen-Ltlemen, all I want to say<br />
-to youa is this. The tiine bas come in Australia for us to<br />
realise that our commnon interests are inuch-superior to our<br />
-iLndividual interests, We are really moving in-to a new phase<br />
of our history. I don't want to make so:-cme contentious speech<br />

that way G.-( eea b Britain is going int;, o the CoLmon M3,.' Ket9 and<br />
that Groat iBritair-zind e Si. ur who,-C a ltoh cre feel that<br />
one of the great stroingth s about the Common Market will be<br />
t~ tthey will have an enormous honze market; and. th'at the-refore<br />
they can increaso their officiercy, their tL-Iurnov~ er, reduce<br />
heir costs on the goods thit they sell t h re? o h<br />
world including Australia. This is wher e manufacturers come<br />
into Lhis -oictuc0, Now th-is is9 tilf-k in all pvrobability,<br />
going to happen. Idother what have roead : racontly inproves the<br />
bargaining position of Groat Britain or not, I don~ t venture<br />
to say, except privately, but 1 tink thle truth is that this<br />
enormous modern development is going to occ-ur and, of coarse1,<br />
it prese-nts problem.,-to Australia0 So peozle triinik thal;<br />

' You may be disturboa6 about a problem but niot<br />

Bu~ t i do say to you thiat wo ha--er here ain enoriaous -problem<br />

of Course today if -it vi'Gre rnot for thie man-on tLhe lan-d and<br />

samane boaw emus inrcaingy think of ourselves as<br />

I would venture, Sir, looking arou~ nd this audierce,<br />

mechoanization re + placer, manpowor0All this is so true as to<br />
be hardly worth mentioning, but at thae same time, those whio<br />
manufacture should, and I knw wi] I, avoid thae temptation to<br />
Say, 111, ell, if you want us to employ + the increasing population,<br />
you must simply give us protection however high it may go and.<br />
whatever it may cost somebody else0The truthi is that while<br />
manufacturing develop:-: ent in, a growing economy is vital and<br />
I hope th. at my on people have-C sh-ownm tnat in what we ~ vo been<br />
doing it is st-ill tr,, ue thac-t the vo~ percentage of our<br />
export incomae is earned on farms and stations an d gardens of<br />
Auis tralia and t hat we muast not Pvrsue policies whicoh pr,. ice<br />
them out of exist-ence. Now thI., at7Ls elementary. Of course it<br />
is, D! Bu what it mean-s is that perh-aps over thne next five or<br />
ten years, we. should not so mu~ ich th'Liink of ourselves as<br />
manufacturers withi special i'nt-orcsts and no connection with<br />
thie firm next door or prinrjry prorluoer', graziers councils, wool<br />

-oil th ose things in mind tht Iecny announced publislyl<br />
that we were going -to conduct, throughi a competent commttee<br />
as Ihcw~ ewil ascmb]. e, an investigation into a great<br />
number of these miatters -not to discover ways and means of'<br />
pushing thE tari-ff up or pushing tho tar-', ff' down, not to<br />
discuss ways and means of subsidizing some primary industry<br />
or not subs idizing it but to get together on -thi. s matter so<br />
tat we may discover Uhat in this marvellous country of oiirs,<br />
ttere is a profound comm. unity of' interest.<br />
' Ae all have, gentlemen, unsuspectod capacity fo.-r<br />
unselfishxiess and this is what we must call on, because I am<br />
perfectly co'ir~ ain that if over the nes-t decade, and 1 ama<br />
happy to assure you that i won't be Primeic Minister at te<br />
