PRIME MINISTER 107/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY THEF PRTME MINISTER, THE BION PJ KEATING, MP<br />
MABO NEGOTIATIONS<br />
Reports this morning that the Federal Government has yielded to State pressure and<br />
made significant concessions on the draft Mabo legislation are untrue.<br />
The Commonwealth is still involved in discussions with the States but has already<br />
Informed them that any proposals to water down the principles on which the legislation<br />
has been based would be rejected.<br />
Officials have not been instructed to " Set a deal with the States",-In fact, officials were<br />
requested to tell the States that many of their proposals have been flatly refused,<br />
although we are prepared to discuss others which do not water down the principles of<br />
the legislation.<br />
I have always said it would be preferable to get agreement with the States, in order to<br />
achicve a national approach in dealing with native title, certainty of land management<br />
and, importantly, justice for Aboriginal people.<br />
But I have made it clear again this week that if the States do not accept our principles,<br />
and the notion that any State processes to deal with native title must be established and<br />
operated in accordance with our standards and guidelines, then the Commonwealth is<br />
prepared to itself operate the system outlined in the legislation.<br />
