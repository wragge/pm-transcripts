    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, The Right Honourable Tony Blair MP, will make an official visit to Australia from 25-28 March as a guest of the Australian Government.</p>
<p>Mr Blair's visit provides a valuable opportunity to discuss the expansion of the Australia-UK relationship, our shared commitment to stabilisation and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan and our common interest in fighting global terrorism.</p>
<p>During the visit, Mr Blair will attend sessions of the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games, including the closing ceremony on 26 March. Mr Blair will also address a joint sitting of Parliament and participate in the second Australia-UK Leadership Forum in Canberra.</p>
<p>  The Australia-UK relationship is as strong and vital as any international alliance.</p>
<p>  It is founded on a common heritage, shared values and institutions and a proud history of friendship and unity through periods of adversity and growth.  It continues to be strengthened by close, practical cooperation in a number of areas and a shared approach to a range of international challenges.</p>
