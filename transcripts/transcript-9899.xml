PRIME MINISTER 1/ 96<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MPDEATH<br />
OF FRANCIOIS MITTERRAND<br />
France, Europe and the world havc lost a distinguished statesman and<br />
outstanding leader in Frangois Mitterrand.<br />
Under his 14-year Presidency, France played an international role that was<br />
engaged, energetic and constructive. His most enduring legacy will be the<br />
vision of a unified, peaceful and outward-looking Europe. In particular,<br />
Frangois Mitterrand was determined that France and Germany should work<br />
together in building a uted Europe. He was an important force for<br />
cooperation betwccn Europe and the United States. Under President Mitterrand,<br />
France was active in seeking resolution to the problems of Cambodia and the<br />
Middic East.<br />
In the South Pacific, Franiois Mitterrand pursued policies of reconciliation and<br />
understanding towards the indigenous peoplcs of France's overseas territories.<br />
His decision to place a moratorium on French nuclear testing was a valuable<br />
and far-sighted contribution towards the goal of nuclear non-proliferation and<br />
won widespread appreciation in our region.<br />
In domestic affairs, Frangois Mitterrand's commitment to human rights, social<br />
justice and reform and his concern to apply innovation and creativity in<br />
prcparing for the future will leave their mark on France and beyond.<br />
Frangois Mitterrand was a truly impressive individual. He -bore his illness with<br />
courage and dignity. Throughout, he maintained an acute intellectual capacity,<br />
a profound sense of history and, as always, he had a crystal-clear sense of<br />
France's interests and its place in the world. I am very glad I had the<br />
opportunity to know Franjois Mitterrand pcrsonally.<br />
On behalf of the peoplc of Australia, I extend my deepest sympathies to<br />
President Mitterrand's family, and to the Government and people of France.<br />
Senator Evans will attcnd the memorial mass in his honour in Paris on behalf of<br />
the Australian Govermnent and people.<br />
