PRIME NINWSTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
THE COALITION AND THE ENVIRONMENT<br />
In selecting Senator Rod Kemp as Shadow Minister for the Environment,<br />
John Howard has made a truly shocking appointment. Not only are Senator<br />
Kemp's views completely hostile to a proper handling of this portfolio, it has<br />
now unbelievably been relegated from the Shadow Cabinet.<br />
But we should not be surprised. Mr Howard has again demonstrated the<br />
Coalition's contempt for national environmental responsibilities and policy<br />
making. Anyone concerned about the environment and casting a vote in New South<br />
Wales or Canberra this Saturday, should bear in mind the full significance of<br />
John Howard's appointment of Rod Kemp to this portfolio. It demonstrates a<br />
disregard for this immensely important area of policy, and the Coalition<br />
should be given the message that the community will not wear it.<br />
As an interview in today's Australian confirms, Kemp is blindly opposed to<br />
Australia signing up to international treaties. He regards the Commonwealth's<br />
use of the external affairs power to make and use environmental treaties to<br />
protect our environment as an abuse of the Constitution, and particularly of<br />
the rights of States. He wants the States to have the right to veto Australia's<br />
accession to international treaties.<br />
The Federal Government's ability to protect our environment depends to an<br />
enormous degree on the external affairs power and the international treaties<br />
we have entered into. These include the World Heritage and Climate<br />
Change Conventions, and the Convention on International Trade in<br />
Endangered Species.<br />
If John Howard and Rod Kemp had their way, those Federal protective<br />
powers would be knocked aside. With .! rs around with the instincts of<br />
Richard Court and John Fahey, the erivii rnental consequences would be<br />
as devastating as they would have been for the Franklin, the Daintree and<br />
the Tasmanian Forests in 1987, or the Great Barrier Reef under<br />
Joh Bjelke-Petersen. </p>
<p>At that time, under Howard's leadership, the Coalition's environmental<br />
oolicies hit rock-bottom. If he had won that election, he would have abolished<br />
the Environment Department, handed over control of Kakadu and Uluru to the<br />
Northern Territory, let the Franklin be dammed and logging go ahead in the<br />
Lemonthyme and Southern Forests, and only nominated the Wet Tropic<br />
rainforests for World Heritage listing if Queensland " approved". All<br />
environmental decisions would have been left to the States.<br />
Obviously, nothing has chan^.-.<br />
The Coalition, under the Howard-Ker'n oolicy regime, is still wedded to<br />
States' rights, at the expense of the national interest and proper<br />
environmental protection policies.<br />
