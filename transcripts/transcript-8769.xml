PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ. KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 13 DECEMBER 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Today John I-cwson announced that he is going to exempt food from the<br />
taxation under the GST. I've got one simple message for Australians and<br />
that is, you can't believe him. Hc'll put thc tax on the moment he wins an<br />
election. Hec'll do to the nation just what Jeff Kennett has done to Victoria<br />
say one thing before the election and do another thing later. Today he says<br />
in the newsqpapers ' in my own analysis it was fair to do what I planned'. In<br />
other words he is saying, I am changing the policy, but haven't changed<br />
my mind. It would be as easy as simply one press announcecmcnt to rcly<br />
upon those words today, in office, to say he's reconsidered and the tax on<br />
food is to again, to apply. The fact of the matter is Dr Hcwson has rcmoved<br />
this only because of pressure from his own party. Re rcmoved it under<br />
prcssure from the Federal Director of the Liberal party, Mr Robb, and the<br />
State Director of Victoria, Mr Georgio.<br />
Hc has not done it because he thinks it is the right thing to do, in fact he<br />
thinks it is the wrong thing to do. It's a political strategy, it's not a policy<br />
change, it's not a policy test that he's applied in removing his wish to tax<br />
food under a OST, it's a political test and the moment he thinks he could<br />
politically succeed in levying the OST on food he would.<br />
J: Isn't the danger though that the political strategy might work and he might<br />
win back some votcrs that he's lost because they think he's..<br />
PM: Food is just a small part of his total policy mix atid the OST wvill still apply<br />
to all sorts of services to theatres, to dry cleaning, to hair cuts, to water<br />
rates, to just about every service in the economy clothing. The fact is this<br />
is just part and, of course, there's the rest of the draconian policy. But he </p>
<p>said two days after announcing what is the most spectacular flip over in<br />
Australian politics, where he said he would resign before he had to<br />
introduce these changes, he had this to say in Perth on radio: ' I'm not just<br />
going to give a knee jcrk rcaction and respond to pressure because a lot of<br />
the trouble we're in today as a nation is because political leaders over the<br />
last couple of decadcs have just bcnt to cvcry breeze and problems have<br />
grown and been allowed to drift and ncver bccn dealt with because it was<br />
politically expedient not to bothcr, hut to try and fool people'. Now he said<br />
this two days after he's abandoned the most solemn commitments he's made,<br />
saying he would resign first bcfore hc would change.<br />
And in his press statement on food, on October 9 he said ' the argument that<br />
food should not be taxed simply doesn't stand up' and he went on to say<br />
' excluding food would mean raising the GST on all other products in order<br />
to maintain the revenue'. In other words hc's told us that if you take food<br />
out, the rate of tax on the rest of the products would have to be increased.<br />
Thcsc arc thc extravagant commitments he made in respect of food, he's<br />
now abandoned this. So, given the fact that hc's told us today that he still<br />
belicves he's right he says ' in my own analysis, it was fair to do what I<br />
planned', in other words it was fair to tax food given the fact that he said<br />
that today, you'd havc to belicve in fairies at the bottom of the garden to<br />
believe that if he won an election he wouldn't tax food. This change is a<br />
politically different change, he would ahandon it at the first opportunity.<br />
J: If he did that though Prime Minister, wouldn't it make the public reaction<br />
national, make what happcned to Kennett in Victoria look like childs play?<br />
Would any politician dare risk something like this?<br />
PM: I think Dr Hewson would, if he won office, because he has risked now the<br />
most amazing change to his stated position and his policy which he's had for<br />
a year I will never change, I'll resign he's just thrown it all away. But<br />
what he is saying is I'm right about it though, I'm changing my policy, but<br />
I'm not changing my mind. I say, once he wins an election he will put the<br />
GST on food. This is a guy that would just drive on with the changcs he<br />
wants to make, wilfully put that GST in if it kills him. And if he wins an<br />
election, cvcry Australian ought to know if they believe him, theyll<br />
believe anything. Every Australian ought to know this man will tax<br />
everything they eat, everything they dress iii and every service they<br />
consume. </p>
<p>3<br />
J: Prime Minister, will the Dcmocrats' move in the Senate in any way imperil<br />
your own announced program of tax cuts?<br />
PM: I don't think so, we have the normal huffing and puffing from the<br />
Democrats, but there wc are.<br />
J. Mr Keating, will you bring back Parliament after Dr Hewson's statement to<br />
make a reply?<br />
PM: At this stage, we are run by the Parliamcntary business load, and I don't<br />
quite know where that is.<br />
Dr Hcwson's plan to take away those tax cuts for high income earners,<br />
doesn't that take the wind out of your sails a bit?<br />
PM: We weren't proposing..<br />
