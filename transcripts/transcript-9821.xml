TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE AUSTRALIAN CHAMBER OF MANUFACTURES<br />
ANNUAL DINNER, REGENT HOTEL, MELBOURNE, 2 NOVEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
I am very touched that Peter Reith and John Moore are with us tonight.<br />
I mean yes, Peter said he is close to me, well he is not close on policy.<br />
I mean they get to hear me these days, Mondays and Thursdays.<br />
But Thursday nights I am touched and indeed a third one, Mr Kemp, I am very<br />
touched. They come out to take a few after hours pointers. A bit of<br />
off-the-job training and I don't mind doing a bit of that either.<br />
Well we are in a very interesting period of our economic history. I think<br />
everyone in this room understands that, because it wasn't all that long ago<br />
that Australia faced the long-end point of a very big decline in the terms of<br />
trade. Now that expression always ends up being an economist's expression,<br />
but it basically boils down to something like a ratio of the value of the things<br />
you sell versus the things you buy.<br />
And, of course, in the early post-war years, Australia's terms of trade were<br />
very good. The things we sold were very valuable and the things we<br />
produced were valuable. But the things we bought were fairly cheap and<br />
manufactures, generally, were inexpensive in those days. But raw materials,<br />
food, agricultural products and minerals were expensive. We have seen a<br />
long trend decline in that and it got to its bottom point in 1985-86, the year of<br />
the Banana Republic so-called, and that meant that we were still pursuing a<br />
lifestyle to which we had become accustomed, but without the income which<br />
we had for most of our post-war period.<br />
As a consequence, we were in deep trouble and not only that we had double<br />
digit inflation and we had profits in very bad shape, poor levels of investment,<br />
a regulated and over-valued exchange rate, a sclerotic financial market and,<br />
of course, high tariffs. In short, we were in a very parlous state. </p>
<p>Now what has happened since is a determined and conscious opening up of<br />
the economy and all of the things which affect our competitiveness are<br />
essentially being put right. The most important price in the economy, the<br />
exchange rate, was set in the market and, as you know, we had a very large<br />
fall in the exchange rate in 1985-86 by 25 per cent.<br />
Now this restored our competitiveness but the trick is to turn a big<br />
depreciation of the dollar into a real depreciation that is, to wash the price<br />
surge and inflation from it and we have done that. And today the Australian<br />
economy is 40 per cent more competitive than it was in 1983.<br />
Now, as a consequence, manufacturing exports have doubled, elaborately<br />
transformed exports have tripled and, as you know, manufacturing production<br />
has risen by over a third 35 or 36 per cent. All this, of course, has changed<br />
the nature of Australia and a part of that competitiveness has, of course,<br />
come through the Accord with wages.<br />
Now I want to say some things about this tonight because in the election,<br />
which is going to be held some time in the next six months a little note there<br />
for Andrew Robb, some time in the next six months, Andrew industrial<br />
relations will be an issue and the way in which we run Australia will be an<br />
issue. Now, essentially, what the Government has done with the ACTU has<br />
introduced a consensual model in the way in which the economy is operated.<br />
So we rely not just on budgetary policy, fiscal policy and monetary policy, but<br />
we also rely on the third instrument the Accord and in that instrument,<br />
essentially, we have made a bargain with the unions which is wage restraint<br />
for growth. Wage restraint for employment and throughout the history of the<br />
Accord we have now seen that restraint and we have seen a very large<br />
measure of that growth.<br />
So much so that we have quite phenomenal levels of employment growth in<br />
the period and, of course, we have seen GOP growth average 1.9 per cent<br />
during the period of the last Coalition Government that is a seven year<br />
period, it is a decent chunk of our history 1.9 per cent. The average GOP<br />
growth under this Government is 3.5 per cent.<br />
Now it is nearly double and you show me any economy in the world where the<br />
economy is growing twice what it used to grow and I will show you a much<br />
wealthier one and a better one. Now, of course, that growth has produced<br />
very high rates of employment growth and the employment growth is the thing<br />
which underpins, of course, the industrial cohesion and the egalitarianism.<br />
As a consequence, you get more compliance with the underlying objectives of<br />
the wage restraint and the commonsense.<br />
So, as a consequence of that, in the period 1 976-82 there was less than 1 per<br />
cent employment growth a year. In the period since, we have had between<br />
2 1/ 3 per cent and 3 per cent employment growth over the period. So we </p>
<p>have got nearly 2 1/ 2 times as much employment, probably just on three<br />
times as much employment. Now you take an economy which has got three<br />
times as much employment and twice as much economic growth and you<br />
have got a very large change. This has produced a quite profound change in<br />
incomes. Household disposable income has risen by 40 per cent since 1983 because<br />
more people in households are in work. And if we look at household income<br />
per capita that is wages, salaries and supplements looking at, also, the<br />
family allowance payments, pensions the works put that through it, we have<br />
had a 21 per cent increase in household disposable income per capita.<br />
That means that all of you out there operating a business, that want people to<br />
buy your products, there is more demand for your products because there<br />
has been real growth in household income and there has been more people<br />
in work.<br />
In 1983, we had a workforce of six million. Today we have got a workforce of<br />
just over eight million, which is a phenomenal increase in growth.<br />
Our workforce is growing about 2 to 2 1/ 2 times the western world average<br />
certainly the average of western Europe and this is what is putting the<br />
buoyancy under the economy and under the sort of markets that you are<br />
living with.<br />
Now, of course, the measure of the wage restraint is the profit growth and the<br />
very lowest profit share in GDP this is the proportion of national income<br />
going to profits the very lowest share was higher than the highest in the<br />
seven years of the last Coalition Government. The highest profit share in that<br />
period was in 1981, which is 15.89 per cent of GDP and the lowest we ever<br />
had was in June 1983 at 15.92 per cent of GDP. In the last few years, of<br />
course, profits are now bumping up against the 1988-89 high which, of<br />
course, has no historic precedence in Australian corporate history.<br />
So, the Accord which is the consensual model, which says you give us growth<br />
and we will give you wage restraint, you give us growth we will give you better<br />
profits, you give us growth and we will therefore give you better investment<br />
and employment, and all of that means that the Australian economy is more<br />
fully employed, people are more prepared to be part of a very large change<br />
and to make the adjustments.<br />
So when the dollar fell out of bed in 1985-86 as it has in many countries<br />
it dropped by 25 per cent, prices come up, the landed cost of imports rise,<br />
that price surge then goes into the economy, then it goes into wages. All of<br />
that was taken out and we turned a massive nominal depreciation of the<br />
exchange rate into a real depreciation. We did what most comparable<br />
countries don't do. They have the big depreciation, then they get the price<br />
surge, then they get the wage surge and the competitive benefit is gone. </p>
<p>We have captured the competitive benefit and that is why we are now seeing<br />
manufacturing exports growing so strongly and, of course, by lowering the<br />
tariff walls, we are starting to see very strong import competition, productivity<br />
between businesses and a better outcome altogether.<br />
Now this sort of model is something which is now fairly unique in the western<br />
world and people talk about the need for wage flexibility. Now the<br />
United States is often used as a model. People say, well look at the<br />
United States, it is a very flexible labour market, you can go out there and<br />
basically make an individual wage contract, people will take the job,<br />
they'll take whatever basically is on offer and, therefore, you will get a more<br />
flexible economy.<br />
But what the United States has shown is that it has had about one of the<br />
lowest rates of growth in labour productivity in the OECD for decades. In the<br />
United States currently, labour productivity growth is half that being<br />
experienced in Australia. Now that is one number I would like to sink in. That<br />
is, in the so-called most flexible labour market, the ultimate dog-eat-dog<br />
labour market, labour productivity is half that being experienced in Australia<br />
and, of course, you know the United States economy has a speed limit of<br />
2 1/ 2 per cent.<br />
Now everywhere in those big US markets, once that US GDP growth rate<br />
starts going over 2 1/ 2 per cent, the US Federal Reserve starts hitting the<br />
panic button, policy makers start hanging their heads. It generally hovers<br />
around 2 per cent, or under 2 per cent somewhere between 1 1/ 2 per cent<br />
and 2 1/ 2 per cent.<br />
Now we are doing either half that much again, or twice that much.<br />
So it doesn't say very much about their supposed labour flexibility that they<br />
have got a speed limit of 2 1/ 2 per cent. That is outside of the recessions of<br />
1981-82 and 1991, we have been growing now around 4 per cent for most<br />
years. It doesn't say much for the United States economy that where you<br />
have the supposed flexibility of a labour market without safety nets, or without<br />
award structures, that their labour productivity is so low and that their growth<br />
is so constrained.<br />
Now take New Zealand. We hear a lot about New Zealand. My colleagues<br />
here from the Opposition think New Zealand is somewhat of a model for<br />
them. But let me say this about their policy, the Employment Contracts Act of<br />
1991. Since that was introduced, the rate of growth of labour productivity has<br />
been 1 per cent per annum, while Australia's has been 2.5 per cent.<br />
Now there is a strong message, I think, in that and that is get people<br />
interested in running a business more productively and they do a much better<br />
job than putting the whip across their back.<br />
This notion that they are out there and they have got to keep their place and<br />
keep their head down and line up and take what you give them and then they<br />
will just be their most productive selves is, of course, a nonsense. And look </p>
<p>at some of the countries which have adapted to massive productivity change.<br />
Look at Japan, which had a couple of hundred yen to the dollar, 250 yen to<br />
the dollar, coming down to 88 yen to the dollar, it is now in the<br />
somewhere yen to the dollar. A huge call on that country for productivity<br />
change just to keep its exports going, massive productivity demands.<br />
How did they get it? They got it by bringing the employees into the<br />
productive system. They didn't get it by putting the whip across their back.<br />
Now in this country, we have been able to do that. We are now into a very<br />
big phase of enterprise bargaining, a very big phase. And I met a couple of<br />
people the other day at Tubemakers in South Australia they are producing<br />
extruded plastic pipes and I said how are you going here? And one fellow<br />
said to me, well look to be honest this is the best time of my working life.<br />
He was about 54 or 55. 1 said, is that right? He said, yes, I am earning more<br />
and I have got more time to myself than I have ever had. And he said we got<br />
that out of the last enterprise bargain and then they had a little discussion<br />
around the table.<br />
They said the first one wasn't that good, we didn't know really what to do with<br />
the first one, it was pretty much a reflection of what we had. The second one,<br />
we realised we could actually do a few things that would help the business<br />
and that gave us, you know, a better pay packet. But they said the third one,<br />
the one coming up, that is going to be a beauty because we have got this<br />
idea, that idea, this idea, that idea. They have just put in a new production<br />
line. They were saying how they actually improved the production line, how<br />
some of their ideas had actually made it more productive and how the<br />
management had taken some of their productive ideas on board and in the<br />
third model they think they are really going to hit the jackpot that the<br />
business is going to grow in productivity and the management was just as<br />
optimistic as the people I was speaking to at lunch.<br />
So I think we are starting to get the hang of doing things productively and<br />
cooperatively within a consensual framework and enterprise bargaining, the<br />
movement away from centralised wage fixing, is the key to this.<br />
But, of course, you know that under the Government's policy we say if you<br />
can't get an enterprise bargain, we give you an increase under the safety net<br />
and that you need the safety net to maintain real wages and the purchasing<br />
power that you have.<br />
Now we have a thing called the no disadvantage test. That means you can<br />
trade in things like overtime rates and penalty rates and holiday leave<br />
loadings, but you must come out the other side with something at least as<br />
good as you have now. You can't go backwards.<br />
So under enterprise bargaining we can see that flexibility. Under the safety<br />
net you get the protection and the two together mean that we can have higher<br />
levels of labour productivity, higher levels of profit, higher levels of<br />
investment, higher levels of production and, of course, a better Australian<br />
society. </p>
<p>Now the coming election will be about, amongst other things, whether that<br />
consensual model stays, whether the Accord model is thrown away and many<br />
people in business today, I think, don't remember what it was like back there<br />
in the 1 970s and the 1 980s. Let me just give you one statistic. In our period<br />
of Government, through strikes, we have lost an average of 70 working days<br />
per thousand. In the period of Government of the Coalition, the seven years<br />
from 1976 to 1983, the average days lost through strikes was 590 per<br />
thousand. Now I haven't got the numbers mixed up there 70 versus 590. Not for one<br />
year or six months, but for an average period of seven years in the case of<br />
the Coalition and 12 years in our case. Now that is what it was like. It was<br />
strikes the norm. There was, essentially, high interest rates to try and hold<br />
down inflation, which held down growth and with it held down profits and held<br />
down production.<br />
So there is no easy choice, there come the next election. If you vote for the<br />
Coalition at the next election you have got to really mean it because it's going<br />
to punch a very big hole in your company accounts. And the reason it is is<br />
because the consensual model is going to go out the door and what will come<br />
in is, essentially, a view about industrial relations which I now think is alien in<br />
Australia and where the central bank is asked, basically, to keep inflation<br />
under control through higher interest rates.<br />
But when it gets the flame-thrower out on inflation, it burns everyone else in<br />
the street as well. I mean we have had now, some of you might have heard<br />
this morning on radio the British Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. We see<br />
a lot of people like Mr Prescott these days coming and saying what are you<br />
doing in Australia that lets you grow at least half as fast, or twice as fast, as<br />
the rest of us with high rates of employment growth and low inflation?<br />
You are doing something here that we are not doing and people come here<br />
now inquiring about it. It is called throughout Europe, now, the Australian<br />
model. A lot of people in North America are interested in it and I think it is<br />
something that I am very proud of. That is we can, together, do something<br />
and when we do things together we are stronger. This is the point. When we<br />
do things together we are better.<br />
Now we want to make that big leap into Asia and consolidate it, we want to<br />
grow those market opportunities out, which we can do, we have got the<br />
products, we have got the intellectual capacity, we have got the R&amp; D, we<br />
have got the innovation and we have got the competitiveness. We have to<br />
keep the whole country signed up to it. Not just part of the country, but the<br />
whole country and that means keeping the executives, and business, and the<br />
boards of management of companies, and the employees, all signed up to the<br />
same view. That is, that we want to be able to while these windows are<br />
open in East Asia particularly, where we are now set so closely to the fastest<br />
growing economies in the world make every post a winner and we want to<br />
drive it. </p>
<p>Now, of course, that means more than just an Accord. It means product<br />
innovation, it means education and in education the Government has spent,<br />
now, a very large amount of budgetary dollars on the education system.<br />
Ten years ago, only three young people in ten completed secondary school.<br />
This year, it is just under eight in ten.<br />
We have lifted the number of university places from 340,000 to 600,000 this<br />
year and, of course, now we are rapidly building the Cinderella of Australian<br />
education TAFE, vocational education into a system that can sit beside the<br />
universities and that is the thing that will power the businesses along and<br />
make the difference in the sort of products we produce and the sort of access<br />
that we will have to markets around here.<br />
But the other thing we have got to do, we have got to want to be in it.<br />
We can't approach Asia as some sort of a fad, or a fashion. It has got to be<br />
something where we take a view that we are going to be in Asia, involved,<br />
forever and that we want to make our way with these Asian societies and<br />
Asian economies. Now we are making great strides. But we have still got to<br />
consolidate it. We still have to make them believe that we mean it.<br />
Now I was addressing a group of school children in Queensland a week ago<br />
and I said to them look when we came here in 1788 as Europeans, we were<br />
like miners in the field, we pegged the claim, we banged the white peg into<br />
the ground and said we will consolidate the place, we will get it to a critical<br />
mass, we will try and hang on to it. We have been doing that, and we have<br />
been doing that well, since that time.<br />
But the negotiation of our settlement in the neighbourhood is not complete.<br />
Our negotiation with Asia and the terms of our settlement into the<br />
neighbourhood is not done. We are part way through it. It is only 20 years<br />
ago that we had a White Australia Policy. We were very lucky not to be<br />
marginalised then as South Africa was marginalised to its great economic<br />
cost. And it is not a long time ago and memories are not that short.<br />
So people are watching Australia to see with what conviction we want to do<br />
this and how earnestly we want to make the settlement a final one, and it is<br />
why when you talk about the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, or its<br />
constituency, or its product, you are talking about really, amongst other<br />
things, not its role as an import replacer, or as an import competitor, but as an<br />
exporter into these markets. We won't keep the market opportunities unless<br />
we make certain that the political relationships are the right ones. So, this is<br />
another thing where the Government believes that foreign policy and<br />
domestic policy are all the one. That no longer in Australia do we have a<br />
domestic political discussion and then out there as an outrider is foreign<br />
policy, but rather it is all part of the one debate.<br />
When we succeed in this, of course, we will succeed as a country, but the<br />
opportunity we have is manifest and profound. Very few people, 18 million of </p>
<p>us, very few nations have been given this opportunity. Eighteen million of us<br />
in a continent this large with such bounty, now located amidst the fastest<br />
growing markets in the world, with a good environment and a good social<br />
attitude, a good social view, the view of egalitarianism and a fair go, very<br />
much built into Government policy.<br />
So, whether it is access and equity in health through Medicare or access and<br />
equity in education, or whether it is fair wages and the prospects of doing<br />
innovative things in the work place. Whether it is running the Australian<br />
economy on a consensual model or not. These are all the things which mark<br />
out our maturity and the way in which we can be in quite a special way a<br />
unique country that can do very unique things. Because we have been,<br />
through our history, our origins are European, yet we find ourselves perched<br />
with some of the oldest societies in the world, some of the largest countries in<br />
the world, large old Asian societies. So, they will always look askance at us<br />
until they are absolutely clear that we want to be with them forever, in an<br />
amalgam of co-operation and progress.<br />
The Accord is more than just a deal between the Government and the ACTU.<br />
It is about saying how can we operate as a country, as a community, how<br />
can we do the things we need to do that we must do be competitive, lift our<br />
profits, lift our investment, provide a decent income for people and carry this<br />
model right through the society, through the social wage, through our social<br />
policies, through issues about our identity and into our foreign policy. All the<br />
bits make up the whole, but the whole is a bigger whole than we have ever<br />
had as a society and as a country before.<br />
This, I think, is going to be a fork in the road. You know that saying, I came to<br />
the fork in the road and I took it. Well, there won't be any coming to this fork<br />
in the road and taking it. There will be a very clear choice. It will be one way<br />
or the other. But if the way is to take the view that we don't have faith in our<br />
fellow Australians, that we don't have faith in working people to see<br />
something good in all of this and to do co-operative and clever things, and we<br />
don't have the faith in Australian management to think more cleverly and<br />
more productively, if we don't believe we can do these things together, we<br />
won't. We will go back to a bickering society, that is clawing away at income shares,<br />
that are not at all agreed and where the strife which comes from it will be<br />
manifest again and we will look around for models and while we are looking<br />
we will watch all of the countries around us leave us for dead. That is not<br />
something I think Australians can really endure anymore.<br />
The model we put together is interesting, not just in Australian terms, but in<br />
world terms. It has been going now for nearly 13 years. Not 13 months.<br />
This is not a flash in the pan or an experiment and as I say, we have been<br />
just on doubling the GDP growth on average we had previously, lifting the<br />
profits to levels that have been unprecedented and giving us a rate of<br />
employment growth two or three times what it used to be. </p>
<p>This is a very strong thing and you know the old saying, when you are good<br />
thing stick to it. The thing, I think, for Australian manufacturing is that it may<br />
be a great irony that it took a Labor Government to give Australia a true<br />
market economy, but that is what has happened, and by knocking the tariff<br />
wall down and by letting you show us how you can compete and adapt and<br />
not just do that, but actually grow your business and your production while<br />
you are doing it and making yourself stronger, really means that that thing<br />
that most of us have always believed, that under stress and competition,<br />
Australians will always answer the call and always do well.<br />
Whether it is in business or commerce or sport or culture or what ever it might<br />
be, but the big call of the last decade has, I hope, changed the Australian<br />
economy forever. And the changes you have made as constituent companies<br />
of the ACM are as much part and parcel of that change as any change made<br />
by the unions and the Accord or any change made by the Government or any<br />
change made by the institutions. We have all been in it. As a consequence<br />
we have got a very remodelled Australian economy and a far more cohesive<br />
and much nicer Australian society as a result.<br />
My message, of course, is a simple one. Don't change horses. I don't know<br />
how many of you are going to rush out of here and think about this and make<br />
your way down to your local polling booth to vote Labor maybe not as many<br />
of you as I would hope. But, the thing is, even if you do support the Coalition,<br />
I know many of you in your hearts, you'll be hoping out there with those<br />
stubby pencils and all the other polling booths that other people don't.<br />
As a consequence, we will keep a co-operative model in this country and we<br />
will know when we have made a change of substance and we will know that<br />
thing, I suppose we have always known, that when we do things together we<br />
are stronger and we are better. That is the thing I want to keep doing.<br />
That is, I'd like to keep things going as they are, and that is to see Australians<br />
understand that something good is being done here and we should think long<br />
and hard about it before we put it asunder.<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
