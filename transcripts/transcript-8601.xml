PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY<br />
I am disturbed by recent reports in some sections of the media which suggest that the<br />
Government intends to withhold fup= ding for Olympic sports if our athletes fail to win<br />
sufficient medals.<br />
Nothing could be further from the truth.<br />
Indeed, in speeches to our Olympians, and all sporting bodies, I have expressed the<br />
very opposite sentiments.<br />
I have been at pains to stress that the fact the Olympic ideals of friendly competition<br />
and comradeship are very close to Australia's own and must surely help explain why<br />
we are one of the very few nations to have competed in every Games since 1896.<br />
The Olympics do not idealise winning so much as striving. Nor do they make a virtue<br />
of national glory so much as individual achievement and excellence.<br />
In truth, to have earned the right to compete with the best in the world is a rare honour:<br />
to participate in the greatest of all sporting events a singular reward for talent and<br />
immense dedication.<br />
Inevitably and justifiably Australians will share in the pride and the triumph of<br />
those athletes who win medals. There is no greater achievement in sport.<br />
But for those who do not win, we will be happy if they have done their best, and<br />
honoured the spirit of the Games and our Nation.<br />
T'his, I believe, is the view of the vast majority of Australians.<br />
For these reasons I make it clear that win, lose or draw, not a cent will be cut from our<br />
Olympic funding as a result of Australia's position in the so called " medal tally".<br />
