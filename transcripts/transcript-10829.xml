    <content><![CDATA[<p> I have pleasure in announcing the appointment of Mr Kim Jones,</p>
<p> Deputy Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT),</p>
<p> as the next Director-General of the Office of National Assessments</p>
<p> (ONA). The appointment will take effect on 15 December 1998.</p>
<p>Before being appointed Deputy Secretary of DFAT, Mr Jones was Ambassador</p>
<p> to France from 1991 to 1993. Among other earlier appointments, Mr</p>
<p> Jones was Deputy Head of Mission in Tokyo, First Assistant Secretary</p>
<p> of the Disarmament, Security and Nuclear Division in DFAT, and Acting</p>
<p> Deputy Secretary, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.</p>
<p>ONA is responsible for advising the Government on international political,</p>
<p> strategic and economic developments affecting Australia's national</p>
<p> interests. ONA also advises the Government on the adequacy and coordination</p>
<p> of Australia's foreign intelligence activities.</p>
<p>Mr Jones' extensive experience as a manager and his expertise</p>
<p> in international issues qualify him well for his new responsibilities,</p>
<p> and I wish him well as he takes up his new appointment.</p>
<p>I take the opportunity to record my appreciation to the outgoing Director-General</p>
<p> of ONA, Mr Dick Smith. Mr Smith has been Director-General since 1996.</p>
<p> Before becoming head of ONA, Mr Smith had a distinguished career in</p>
<p> the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, having been Ambassador</p>
<p> to the Philippines, High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Ambassador</p>
<p> to Thailand, and Ambassador to Israel.</p>
<p>Mr Smith has given long and dedicated service to Australia. I thank</p>
<p> him for that and wish him well for the future.</p>
<p> 24 November 1998</p>
