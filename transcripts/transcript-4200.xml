PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECHES BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA<br />
AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
ARRIVAL CEREMONY AT THE WHITE HOUSE<br />
10.30 A. M. TUESDAY 27 JULY 1976<br />
PRESIDENT FORD: Prime Minister Fraser, Mrs Fraser, Ladies<br />
and Gentlemen: In this Bicentennial Year, the United States has<br />
been honoured to welcome the leaders of many, many friendly<br />
nations, and we are especially and particularly pleased that<br />
the Prime Minister of Australia has come to Washington, D. C.,<br />
our nation's capital.<br />
Australia is especially close to the hearts of<br />
Americans throughout our country. The American and<br />
Australian people share common roots, common similarities<br />
and the strongest affinities. We hold in common a devotion<br />
to the preservation of liberty, not only in our own<br />
countries, but throughout the world. We share great<br />
responsibilities for assisting the emergence of a more just<br />
and stable international order.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, our countries have long been<br />
allies in war as well as in peace. We have worked together<br />
to support other free nations and to improve the condition<br />
of less fortunate people.<br />
Our two governments have a tradition of close<br />
consultation that will be continued in our meetings today.<br />
Australia is assuming increased responsibilities on a<br />
worldwide basis. Its position on international issues<br />
has not been narrowly confined to self-interest, but has<br />
taken on a wider view that we share in this country. </p>
<p>2.<br />
We respect this friendly and independent voice<br />
across the Pacific. We welcome Australia's important<br />
contribution to stability and progress in the Pacific<br />
region and in the world at large.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, you are deeply conscious of<br />
the need to preserve a global balance among the Great Powers.<br />
We sincerely appreciate Australia's support for our foreign<br />
policy. We assure you that the United States will remain a<br />
strong and faithful ally, worthy of Australia's trust.<br />
Australia its Government and its Citizens<br />
has done much to celebrate the American Bicentennial.<br />
Festivals have been held in Australia; performers have<br />
come to the United States and Australia will endow a<br />
Chair of Australian Studies at Harvard University.<br />
We thank you, and all Australians, for those<br />
warm expressions of friendship.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, you are a very welcome visitor<br />
to our nation's capital. I look forward to my discussions<br />
with you and the continuing close relationships with<br />
Australia and its people, our natural friends and allies<br />
in every sphere of life.<br />
PRIME MINISTER FRASER:<br />
Mr President, my wife and I thank you for your<br />
most warm and moving welcome to Washington.<br />
It is now six years since I was last in the<br />
United States and it is good to be back in this Bicentennial<br />
Year. Mr President, the revolution that you are<br />
celebrating this year was a great triumph for the then<br />
radical idea that man could be free, that a free people<br />
could not only survive and wcrk together, but that they<br />
could create a better society than had existed in the<br />
world before. It is from your revolution that we traced the<br />
birth of our own nation in 1788. Our two countries have<br />
travelled far since that time. We have both demonstrated<br />
the vitality and strength of democracy. We have both<br />
been able to build societies which are just and which<br />
enshrine freedom. / 3 </p>
<p>That we have similar ideals is not a matter of'<br />
mere coincidence. America's inderpendence, and its<br />
subsequent development as onc of the world's great<br />
civilizations, has been an inspiration and an example,<br />
especiall[ y to younger na-tions such as my own. In this<br />
Bicentennial Year, it is a debt to which we are pleased<br />
to pay tribute. Like you, we value our independence. We do<br />
not expect others to assume our responsibilities. Over<br />
time, however, our paths have come to run, to an<br />
increasing extent, in parallel.<br />
Comradeship in arms, on a number of occasions,<br />
has been the basis for a closeness; the sharing of purpose,<br />
which has, I feel, been to the benefit and comfort of both<br />
our countries. Over the last 30 years, it has fallen to the<br />
United States to provide leadership for the western world.<br />
You have our continuing support in this difficult role.<br />
For the sake of world peace and for the ideals we share,<br />
it is essential, Mr President, that this leadership<br />
continue and Australia has every confidence and knowledge<br />
that it will. We live in a world that continues to hold many<br />
dangers and challenges to human dignity. Many countries are<br />
confronted by appalling problems of poverty, hunger, disease.<br />
The developed countries face their own problems of inflation<br />
and unacceptably high rates of unemployment.<br />
These are challenges to be faced together,<br />
contributing whereever we can to their just and practical<br />
solution. In responding to them, the world will look, as<br />
it has so often in the past, to the United States to play<br />
a prominent role.<br />
It is in recognition of this, and the determination<br />
that Australia will play its full part, that I make this<br />
journey to the United States in this Bicentennial Year.<br />
Mr President, I look forward to my discussions<br />
with you and other members of your Government and to the<br />
opportunity to be among the American people on this occasion.<br />
Thank you very much, Mr President, for your<br />
hospitality. </p>
