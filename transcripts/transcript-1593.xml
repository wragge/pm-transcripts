TIEXT OF SPEECH BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER AND 1 3 JUN 1967<br />
MINISTER FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY, ' S<br />
MR. JOHN~ McEVTEN, SA<br />
AT THE EXPORT DEVELOPIOTIET COUNCIL DINNEKR,<br />
HOTEL CANBERRA, 31ST MfAY, 1967<br />
I recall when E. D. C. was established in 1958 to advise<br />
the Government on the expansion of our expnrt trade. The thought<br />
in my mind, which had the support s~ f the Gcvernment, was to invite<br />
a number of highly experienced, highly respected and highly<br />
competent people from the commercial world to join with a few<br />
similarly experienced officials of the Gove rnm ent Service.<br />
It is fortunate for the country that those who were<br />
invited to join what became known as the Export Development Council<br />
readily accepted the call to serve the country and establish this<br />
Council under the Chairmanship of the late Sir John Allison.<br />
Now, nine years later, no one would query a claim that<br />
it has been a most valuable adjunct both to government and to<br />
business. The Council has been fortunate in its Chairmen. First,<br />
Sir John, then the late Sir Alfred Armstrong, and now Dave McGrath.<br />
As exports expand, benefits should flow to those who<br />
invest in, and to those who work in, the export industries. This<br />
is essential. However, on the establishment of this Council, the<br />
basic motive in my mind was more profound than that.<br />
The majf'r cbjective was to generate for the nation aexcha~ nge<br />
bigger earning of foreign exchange. Adequate resources of foreign/<br />
are an essential to national growth.<br />
With my official advisers and my Cabinet colleagues, I<br />
join in working for the fast growth of this country, a growth<br />
built upon sound foundations. I see growth sound growth<br />
providing a widening level of prosperity, an assurance ' qf job<br />
availability, and with these the basis upon which a great and<br />
continuing migration programme can be confidently embarked upon.<br />
Earnings from export represent the most natural generation of<br />
holdings of foreign currency. Without sufficient foreign exchange,<br />
no great plans for national growth could be carried through. </p>
<p>It was as a Council concerning itself with the earning of<br />
more foreign exchange through export that the Council was seen as<br />
essential to the grand plan of fast, sound, national growth. It has<br />
a long record of devoted service and a long record of successful<br />
achievement. While the political government of the country can, and<br />
should, plan for growth, both the industrial growth itself and the<br />
earning of foreign exchange through export is predominantly in the<br />
field of private enterprise, not of government. So what we sought<br />
to create was a sense of partnership, the reality of partnership<br />
between the Government and its senior officials and those in private<br />
enterprise who have brought their wealth of experience and knowledge<br />
and imagination into the partnership.<br />
To bring big business so closely into association with the<br />
admiinistrative side of government, both at the political and at the<br />
official level, is the perfect setting to facilitate log-rolling by<br />
vested interests. From the outset we all understood that the Export<br />
Development Council was never tn be a facility for the promotion of<br />
private interests, individually or collectively, through contact with<br />
the Government. There are many things in connection with this Council of<br />
which we may all feel proad. High on the list of these things I<br />
would put the fact that there has never been an instance of the<br />
Council, its committees, or its individual members ever attempting<br />
to influence the Government at any level for purposes of individual<br />
profit. In view of the close association of so many people with<br />
government at high level and with those in government whose policy<br />
and administrative acts bear upon the profitability of business,<br />
this is something of which you can be proud.<br />
Impartiality has been the keynote of E. D. C's. advice.<br />
This is quite a record. I am sure it will be sustained.<br />
We have big dreams of growth. To make these dreams come<br />
true, we have big practical requirements.<br />
I remember saying when addressing an Export Convention<br />
in 1960 that those competent to make the calculation had satisfied<br />
me that Australia needed to lift its earnings through export to a<br />
higher level of œ 250 million a year within the next five years. To<br />
all who heard me quote this figure, or at least most who heard me,<br />
the figure sounded dramatically high, but to many it sounded<br />
ridiculously high. But, having estimated our need, government and<br />
private enterprise went to work to step up our income. The end<br />
result was that at the end of five years our export earnings had </p>
<p>increased by an annual rate, not of œ 250 million a year, but a rate<br />
of œ 500 million a year.<br />
You would not wish me to say that all of this is<br />
attributable to the work of the Exprt Development Council. Of<br />
course it isn't. But the Council has a long record of identifying<br />
the things that should be done, could be done, by government or by<br />
business to improve our export record.<br />
The Government has now for many years regularly invited<br />
those whom you choose from amongst yur members to come to the<br />
Cabinet room and give the Government ynur advice twice a year.<br />
Policies that the Council has proposed have been adopted by the<br />
Government and have to a large extent produced the results in<br />
business which were forecast.<br />
This leads me to say " Thank you"; and leads mc. furthr<br />
to. say YOUR WORK IS NOT DONE.<br />
Australia's need + o increase its foreign exchange arning....<br />
is as great to--day as it has ever been. What you have donc is tn<br />
prove that a group such as those who -ompose this Council can make<br />
a very valuable contribution to the sound growth of the nation.<br />
This, I believe, must produce a very satisfying feeling in all whn<br />
have. served on E. D. C.<br />
Dramati c things are happening these days in Australia in<br />
the mineral fields,. Expansion of lead and zinc production, a moder".<br />
industrial nation now self-aufficiont in copper and with a surplus<br />
for export. The formerly depressed coal industry transformed into a<br />
bright setting. New production of tin and the revelation of our<br />
immense resources of bauxite, of iron ore, of natural gas, and now<br />
of nickel; a new confidence in oil! These are splendid discoveries<br />
and splendid developments.<br />
Australians P. we a Lot to all cf those who have contributed.<br />
There are those who believe that our problem of earning<br />
sufficient foreign exchange need no longer bp a worry, that the<br />
metals will solve it,, True, minerals will become much more imprrtant<br />
foreign exchange earners. E. D. C's. estimate of Australia's oxpnrt<br />
needs of $ 5,000 million by the mid-1970' s means an increase of<br />
about $ 2,300 million over our current level f exports. Minerals<br />
will fill only a part of this gap.<br />
However, let me put this issue of foreign exchange earnings<br />
in its proper perspective. Foreign exchange is a form of money. We<br />
will not be a great ationL through merely being a rich nation. </p>
<p>Our objective, if you rmnember, was fast, sound, national<br />
growth. That is, millions more people, millions more jobs, hundreds<br />
of thousands more factories and farms. The objective of earning<br />
foreign exchange was not an end in itself. It was a means towards<br />
making possible that kind of national growth.<br />
As I see it, while the minerals are exported as such, or<br />
upgraded into metals, we will undoubtedly earn much exchange, but<br />
that alone will not create jobs by the hundreds of thousands or<br />
great industry. The kind of industries that you have been concerning<br />
yourselves with to a large extent, the farm industries, the manufacturing<br />
industries, will continue to provide the greatest basis for<br />
wealth production. Alcng with the tertiary industries, they will<br />
alsn prmvide the basis for job creation.<br />
Let us salute the -owth of the minerals industries, but<br />
not take this devel] npment as grounds for sitting back.<br />
I have spoken on othor -' ccasirns our option to choose<br />
the comfort of stagnation. For my part, and I am sure for ynur part,<br />
we would all prefer to sufi the discomfort of growing pains, so<br />
that we may leave a nation greater and stronger than wher' we found<br />
it. I give you the Toast<br />
" THE SPIRIT OF SERVICE TO THE NATION"<br />
