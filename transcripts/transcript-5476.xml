JOINT. STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE RT. 1J0N. MALCOLM FRASER, MP, AND THE<br />
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. J. D. ANTHONY, MP<br />
The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister today jointly<br />
condemned any attempts to induce independent candidates to<br />
stand as a means of attracting additional support for the<br />
Labor Party in the Queensland State elections.<br />
Any tactic which resulted in additional support for the Labor<br />
Party would inevitably be damaging to the future of the State<br />
of Queensland.<br />
The Coalition has given Queensland stable and successful<br />
Government over many years.<br />
Queenslanders are justly proud of the tremendous progress mnade<br />
in their State under the Coalition Government.<br />
It is immensely important that the Coalition Government continue.<br />
The fullest co-operation between Queensland and the Conaronw,, ealth<br />
. s essential in the national interest.<br />
The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime minister urged all<br />
Queenslanders to place their support in the Government parties.<br />
The Prime Minister urged the maximum support for the Liberal<br />
Party and for all Liberal preferences to go to the National Party.<br />
The Deputy Prime Minister called for the fullest support for t: he<br />
National Party and for all second preferences of the Party to go<br />
to the Liberals.<br />
This would ensure the strongest possible vote for the Government<br />
and prevent any possibility of Labor gaining office.<br />
Mr. Fraser and Mr. Anthony urged supporters of the Coalition<br />
Parties to remember at all times that the Labor Party was the<br />
opponent that had to be defeated and defeated soundly.<br />
