PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THURSDAY 23 NOVEMBER 1995<br />
MOTION OF CONDOLENCE PRIME MINISTER YITZHAK RABIN<br />
I move: That fhis House records Its deep sadness at the assassination on<br />
4 November 1995 of Yitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister of Israel;<br />
expresses its profound sympathy to Mrs Leah Rabin and her<br />
family and to the people of Israel in their bereavement; further<br />
expresses its hope that all the parties to the Middle East peace<br />
process will continue to follow the path of peace and reconciliation<br />
along which Mr Rabin had set out, and requests that this motion<br />
be conveyed by the Speaker on behalf of the House to the<br />
Government of Israel.<br />
Like all Australians, I was horrified to learn of the assassination of<br />
Yitzhak Rabin. Few people in international public life are called on to<br />
make decisions of such weight and consequence as those he had to<br />
make. And few have done so with such courage and clear-eyed vision.<br />
Yitzhak Rabin was a remarkable individual. His life was dominated by<br />
his absolute commitment to the state of Israel and its people. From his<br />
birth In Jerusalem in 1922, he was at or near the centre of most of the<br />
events which created and shaped his country. His life was devoted first<br />
to the foundation of Israel, then to ensuring Its survival.<br />
For many years, Mr Rabin expressed this commitment through his<br />
distinguished career as a soldier. He fought in the 1948 war of<br />
independence, then served for more than twenty years as a member of<br />
the Israeli Defence Force, His military career culminated in his<br />
appointment as Chief of Staff of the I DF and its commander during the<br />
Six Day War. ftAL v z157 2 &gt; 4 No. 0 </p>
<p>TEL<br />
After five years as Israel's Ambassador to the United States, Mr Rabin<br />
returned to Israel in 1973 to enter politics.<br />
Just as his military career was driven by his unswerving commitment to<br />
Israel's security, so was his life as a political leader.<br />
But although that deep commitment never changed, its form did and<br />
quite profoundly.<br />
During his second term as Prime Minister after 1992, Mr Rabin came to<br />
the view cautiously, almost reluctantly, but irresistibly that the cause<br />
to which he had committed his life Israel's survival and security was<br />
now served best by a sustained effort to negotiate a settlement with the<br />
Palestinians.<br />
This did not represent any change in his fundamental beliefs. But he<br />
had the imagination and courage to recognise that military superiority<br />
alone coulo1 not deliver lasting security for Israel. And he understood that<br />
a change of approach of parallel importance was taking place among<br />
the Palestinian leadership as well.<br />
This represented a fundamental shift in policy for Israel, and many<br />
Israelis were unsettled by it. It was possibly only Rabin, with his<br />
unassailable reputation as a defender of Israel's security, who could<br />
have carried most of the country with him in following this new path.<br />
The breakthrough came with the signature on 13. September 1993 of the<br />
Israel i-Palestinian Declaration of Principles. in that document, for the<br />
first time ever, Israel and the Palestinians recognised each other as part<br />
of the same neighbourhood and accepted the need to deal with each<br />
other as neighbours. That historic recognition was symbolised when Mr<br />
Rabin shook the hand of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat at the White<br />
House in September 1993.<br />
That handshake was the beginning, not the end, of a process. And<br />
despite the intense political pressure he came under pressure which<br />
went well beyond the normal and acceptable bounds of political debate<br />
Mr Rabin remained determined to keep the peace process going.<br />
Under his leadership, the peace treaty with Jordan was signed in<br />
October 1994 and then the Interim Agreement With the Palestinians, just<br />
two months before his death.<br />
The worth and substance of Mr Rabin's achievements not just for Israel<br />
but for the Middle East and the world were recognised when he was<br />
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, together with Mr Shimon<br />
Peres and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. T. E2L: 2 . Nov. 95 23 : 4 No Cui8 F,' CL </p>
<p>The great shock of Yitzhak Rabin's assassination was not so much that<br />
it happened, because violence in the politics of the Middle East is<br />
tragically common. It was that he was killed by another Israeli.<br />
Because at the core of Israel's existence has always been Its role as a<br />
sanctuary for the Jewish people.<br />
His assassin has done more than rob us all of the life and potential of<br />
Yitzhak Rabin. He has cheated the Jewish people of the security of the<br />
beliefs to which so many Israelis had dedicated themselves. That Israel<br />
was a place where, above all else, human rights and human happiness<br />
were the foundation of the society.<br />
Some good may come of his death if, as many of the country's political<br />
leaders and public figures have urged, it causes Israelis to reflect on the<br />
ways the political debate was abused and misused.<br />
And much good will come of it if it reinforces the commitment of Israelis<br />
and their neighbours to press ahead on the difficult but unavoidable path<br />
he had set.<br />
From my discussion with Prime Minister Peres, I know that he and the<br />
Israeli government are deeply committed to this task. As he told the<br />
Knesset yesterday:<br />
' Our main objective will be to arrive, if possible by the end of this<br />
century, at a comprehensive peace In the Middle East. To create<br />
a Middle Fast without violence, without bloodshed, without<br />
terrorism, without wars, and without the factors which led to all of<br />
these poverty, ignorance, backwardness and prejudice.'<br />
The best way Australia can honour Mr Rabin Is to continue to give our<br />
full support to the peace process. We shall continue to support the right<br />
of Israel to exist in security and safety, at peace with its Arab neighbours<br />
in the context of a comprehensive regional settlement. We shall also<br />
continue to help in whatever practical ways are possible, including<br />
through our participation in the Sinai peacekeeping force and United<br />
Nations peacekeeping operations and through our practical work on<br />
regional security and on water resources as part of the peace process.<br />
When I met Prime Minister Peres after the funeral, he told me that in the<br />
fifty years he had known Mr Rabin, he had never seen him as happy as<br />
he was on the night he was killed. He was buoyed by the support of the<br />
vast crowd of 100,000 which had turned out to rally for the cause of<br />
peace. For the first time in his life, he had sung in public. </p>
<p>IL~ L: 22. Nov. 95 23: 48 No. 018 P. 04/ 04<br />
Yitzhak Rabin's life was a life that mattered. He changed, fundamentally<br />
and for the better, the society which he led and the region of which Israel<br />
is part.<br />
But it is important to remember, too, that his murder was not just a<br />
political event. It was also human tragedy for the family of Mr Rabin and<br />
those who loved him. No one who saw his grand-daughter deliver that<br />
eloquent eulogy at his funeral could fail to be moved by this human<br />
dimension. That is why, Mr Speaker, I am sure that I speak for all the Members of<br />
this House when I offer our deepest condolences to Mrs Leah Rabin and<br />
the other members of Mr Rabin's family.<br />
I commend this motion to the House. </p>
