    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister today launched the Australian Centre on China in the World at the Australian National University (ANU). The Rudd Government will provide a foundation grant of $35 million to establish the Centre and a further $18.1 million to construct a signature building to house it on the ANU campus.</p>
<p>In the Asia-Pacific century, with China's increasing prominence in regional and global affairs, this is an investment in Australia's future.</p>
<p>Through international fellowships, conferences, public events and the media, the Centre will build awareness and understanding within Australia and internationally of China's unfolding global role. It will contribute to a well-informed debate that engages the broader Australian population in a dialogue directly concerning our future.</p>
<p>As a hub for national and international scholars, the Centre will create an integrated, world-leading institution for Chinese studies. It will conduct groundbreaking research and mentor new generations of scholars with deep expertise on China and its global presence.</p>
<p>Nationally and internationally, the ANU is uniquely placed to build on its China-related expertise through a vibrant program of integrated research, education and public engagement.</p>
<p>The Centre will be an independent, prominently branded entity at the ANU. With its far-reaching value as a resource for more than just government and academics, it is anticipated that the business and philanthropic community will provide strong support to the Centre.</p>
