SOUTH AUSTRALIANELECTION<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. J. D.<br />
Anthony M. P.<br />
Counting so far in South Australia of the votes cast<br />
in the State Election yesterday provides little comfort for<br />
the Labor Party.<br />
Although there has been a swing back from the vote<br />
given to the Liberal Party in 1979, the Liberals, led by<br />
Mr. Tonkin, have clearly attracted an increased core of<br />
support from which they will be able to mount a strong<br />
challenge to Labor at the next poll.<br />
The election was fought very much on South Australian<br />
issues, as senior Labor figures have ack~ nowledged. I have<br />
no doubt that attempts will be made by the Labor Party at<br />
Federal level to take credit for the result. It is clear,<br />
however, that. South Australians have rejected Mr. Hayden's<br />
attempts to turn the poll into a test of the policies of the<br />
Commonwealth Government.<br />
Mr. Tonkin has acknowledged that on present indications,<br />
he will not be able to form a Government. I very much regret<br />
that, because under his leadership for the past three years a<br />
new economic framnework has been constructed in South Australia<br />
which would never have been possible in the previous years of<br />
Labor Government.<br />
That framework has protected the State from the worst<br />
of many of the economic problems facing the world and Australia.<br />
Unless it is damaged by Mr. Bannon and his colleagues, it is a<br />
framework on which a stronger and more prosperous South Australia<br />
can be built. I believe Mr. Tonkin and all members of his<br />
Government deserve the thanks of South Australians for<br />
this achievement.<br />
