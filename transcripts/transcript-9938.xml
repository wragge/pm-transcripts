PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
ALEXANDER HEIGHTS COMMUNITY CENTRE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
8 FEBRUARY 1996<br />
I am very pleased to be here to support Carolyn in her effort to win Cowan for<br />
the ALP and to come to Perth in support of all our candidates.<br />
It will be hard work. but I think we can hold all our seats and even pick up one<br />
or two including Cowan.<br />
We have exceptional candidates in the West and we've had them for some<br />
time. Old hands like Kim Beazley have always had to work very hard. It has<br />
become a way of life.<br />
I was in Canning yesterday, where George Gear is going to have to work as<br />
hard as Kim has had to, and I left confident that George will come through too.<br />
This election will be hard. But we're used to that. None of them has ever<br />
been easy.<br />
But we must win this one. We have achieved so much in the last three years.<br />
We have got to a point where Australia is so much stronger and has so much<br />
to look forward to we can't give it to John Howard. Or Tim Fischer, or<br />
Alexander Downer. Or Peter Costello. Or Peter Reith and Bronwyn Bishop.<br />
We can't leave the future to people who live in the past. We can't hand<br />
Australia's future over to their conservative creed.<br />
And, however much they are hiding it and pretending that they're new-born<br />
social democrats and progressive thinkers, it is a backward and backwardlooking<br />
creed.<br />
Look at it its antecedents every reactionary fashion of the last fifteen years<br />
Thatcherism, Reaganism, the New Right, the HR Nicholls society, Joh for<br />
Canberra. the Greed is Good brigade. John Hewson. Fightback, John and<br />
Andrew, Andrew and John and Alexander and John again, and some hybrid<br />
now of John Howard, Newt Gingrich and the Fabian socialists.<br />

<p>To help distinguish this Mr Howard from the one I have known for the past<br />
years, in my own mind I call him Jack Howard.<br />
And I think it is only reasonable that Mr Howard do something to distinguish<br />
himself in the same way for the people of Australia.<br />
The point is that for all the changes of leadership, and the changes of rhietoric,<br />
and the changes of tactics and the changes of ideological fashion the<br />
Coalitions intentions today are essentially the same as they have been for the<br />
last decade.<br />
They still want to privatise the health system. They still hate Medicare. They<br />
still can't concede the value of a social safety net and a social wage. They still<br />
hate the Accrd. They still have a problem with tMe idea, that people should be<br />
able to combine to protect their common interests in the work place.<br />
The real nature of the Coalition, the real unreformed nature of their thinking<br />
and their intentions is nowhere revealed more clearly than in their industrial<br />
relations proposals.<br />
And, of course, nowhere have they made a more thoroughgoing effort to<br />
disguise thir real intentions.<br />
Of course there are some very obvious signs of what they have in mind. The<br />
legislation brought down by Jeff Keninett in Victoria is one example and for<br />
people who might think that we should not judge them by their record, it is a<br />
useful one.<br />
Their rcrd shows and John Howard's record particularly shows that the<br />
Liberal and National parties want nothing in the world so much as the<br />
destruction of the Accord. the breaking of the unions and the creation of a<br />
labour market in which the balance of power shifts heftily to the employers.<br />
John Howard has beern the most consistent advocate of these policies for the<br />
last 20 years. He has opposed all but two wage rises in that period. He has<br />
sdagain and again that tabour market reform of the kind he has in mind is<br />
his great mission in life. He was a passionate advocate of the draconian<br />
labour market proposals contained in lFightback.<br />
And so thoroughly is it understood within the Liberal Party that Jeff Kennett<br />
said recently when John Howard gets eklced those 400,000 Victorian<br />
workers who escaped from his legislation will have nowhere to hide. In other<br />
words, the Kennett legislation will become Commonwealth legislation.<br />
So we have their record to judge them by and Jeff Kennetfs legislation to<br />
judge themi by. And we also have the West Australian government by which<br />
to judge them. 466,3 </p>
<p>What the WA Government has been doing in public health, education, in their Un<br />
approach to nurses' oay and industnrial relations generally is wholly lin<br />
consiste.: with Joh:. Howard's .;. inkng over the past two dEcades. fal en<br />
Don't be fooled by the cardboard cut-out John Howard. Th<br />
Last time they fought a savage ideological battle. This time it's a battle of inc<br />
tactics. But the most conservative leader the Liberal Party has ever had is still the<br />
the most conservative leader the Liberal Party has ever had. wo<br />
But his policy on industrial relations exposes the truth. And you don't even Le<br />
have to draw comparisons between Mr Howard and Mr Kennett and Mr Court in,<br />
to prove it. You don't even have to draw the logical inference from his past. If;<br />
Remember how Jeff Kennett said that there would be nQ " loss of wages and sh<br />
conditions" end then when he was elected abolished all state awards and took rrm<br />
away holiday loadings? Th<br />
Remember when Richard Court said that he was no Jeff Kennett and that<br />
workers had nothing to fear and then when he was elected removed all Ne<br />
income guarantees from the West Australian system and cut youth wages to eff<br />
S3.77 an hour? W,<br />
And remember any one of hundreds of statements made by John Howard over m;<br />
the past dozen years. Jo<br />
There is no doubting their intentions. 0<br />
If John Howard is elected the Commonwealth industrial relations legislation will<br />
become the same as Kennett's and Court's. an<br />
But it will also be distinctly and expressly John Howard's. He hasn't waited Ethis<br />
long to look like he's imitating someone else. Tr La<br />
John Howard's industrial relations package in 1996 will deliver the same<br />
results as the package contained in Fightback. The only difference is that the Th<br />
Fghtback package spelt it out. jot fro<br />
In the new 8 January 1996 package you have to look at the fine print and in<br />
when you do you see that the " rock solid guarantee" that " employees cannot<br />
be worse off" is cynical nonsense. MI<br />
of<br />
Look behind the veil of comforting rhetoric shrouding his most recent policy<br />
announcement, and you can see the distinct shape of the old ideological M<br />
obsessions lower wages, less security, weaker unions: in short a labour rru<br />
market much more closely resembling the US labour market, and much less Ev<br />
our own labour traditions. ME<br />
The proof of the pudding is in the proposal itself. ye<br />
4664 </p>
<p>Under the Coalition's system the Industrial Relations Commission will be sidelined<br />
and made impotent. There will be no public testing or assessment of the<br />
fairness of contracts. Workers will have to bargain, as individuals, with the<br />
employer, in secret<br />
The Australian Workplace Agreement, which is what the Coalition is calling<br />
I, individual contracts, will be filed and that just means put in a cabinet with<br />
the new so-called Employment Advocate. It will not be looked at unless the<br />
Lets think about the circumstances in which a worker would ask for an<br />
inspection of their contract.<br />
If asked to sign a Workplace Agreement would a job applicant say, " let me<br />
show it to the union, or to a lawyer first", when they know that some other<br />
more compliant applicant will then get the job?<br />
The answer is of course not. Job applicants will have no effective choice.<br />
New workers will be forced onto agreements that will not be scrutinised by an<br />
effective or even expert body.<br />
With the high levels of job mobility which characterise our modemn labour<br />
maket. the system must quickly and inevitably reflect the law of the jungle.<br />
Job mobility is an issue with huge implications for the Howard legislation.<br />
Over 1.7 mnillion Australian workers face a new employer each year about<br />
300,. 000 tertiary education graduates: up to 150. 000 year 11 and 12 leavers:<br />
and 600.000 workers who change jobs every year.<br />
Every year 220,000 Western Australian workers take a new job. 33,000 are in<br />
Trades, 45,000 are Sales or Personal Service workers, and 55.000 are<br />
Labourers. The system will change radically, and quickly, because somebody wanting a<br />
job will sign up even if they are unhappy with the contract. And no one apart<br />
from the worker and the employer will know what has transpired because, as<br />
in Victoria and Western Australia, the contacts will be secret<br />
Many of these workers will be young around 750,000 people under the age<br />
of 25 take a new job every year.<br />
Many of them~ will be immobile and without much choice around 225,000<br />
marred women return to the workforce to new jobs after iooking after children.<br />
Every year.<br />
Many of them will have a poor understanding of Australian practices about<br />
150,000 people born in non-English speaking countries take a new job every<br />
year. 4665 </p>
<p>T,.<br />
Many of themn w.: l te taking their f si ever jot-about 2730 000 Australians W<br />
expenence, this every year.<br />
In proportionate terms, the figures are similarly striking. The number of new<br />
job takers over a year is about 40 per cent of all employees in Sales and<br />
Personal Assistant occupations, and the same for Labourers. Twenty five per<br />
cent of all all wage and salary earners take a new job every year. n<br />
Ask the most batsic question: how can an inexperienced jobseeker, possibly It<br />
with litte confidence, surel without a good understanding of the award 4<br />
system, and without doubt little recourse to the Australian Industrial Relations OL<br />
Commission, unions, or the government's award inspectors how can they<br />
expect to strike a fair and balanced agreement with an employer about the pay If<br />
and conditions of a secret individual contract? -cc<br />
Just taking the fact that over 40 per cent of workers have been in their current TI<br />
job for less thani 3 years, it must follow that over the first term of a Hoard PC<br />
government at least 3.2 million workers will be on individual contracts. SIC<br />
Secret indivdual c ontracts.<br />
Contracts that the applicant won't challenge, because if they do they won't get SI'<br />
the job. ba<br />
Contracts that the existing employee won't challenge. biecause if they do there Ir<br />
will be big and adverse personal and professional consequences. M<br />
Contracts that will change the nature of Australian workplaces and pay, and W<br />
with this the social fabric.<br />
Existing employees are also not going to challenge their employer if they think a,.<br />
the contract is unfair. This would amount to publicly questioning the W<br />
employer's honesty and credibility. ac<br />
The employer can make this costly in all sorts of ways -by not offering Jo<br />
overtime hours. by niot allowing holidays when they are wanted, by not giving 58.<br />
promotions, and even by the sack under the Coalition's impotent new unfair<br />
dismissals laws. T<br />
jus<br />
How can an individual worker resist? Th<br />
Why would an individual worker bring a complaint to the Employment $ 2<br />
Advocate when it has no judicial power, and no way of enforcing a decison, be<br />
othe than to take it to court where it could stay for many monfths and where AL<br />
the outcome is uncertain? ca pn<br />

<p>The eenI issues concerning the Coalition's new agenda in comrbination<br />
with the mobility in the Australian labour market are a profound part of this<br />
debate. They are explained in more detail in the Statement issued from my<br />
Office today.<br />
But for all the detail in that Statement and all the details of the Coalition's<br />
many statements, the industrial relations system has more fundamental<br />
meanings. It goes to the core of society. If the conditions in which we negotiate our<br />
working lives are unbalanced, our society is unbalanced. If they are unfair,<br />
our sciety is unfair unfairness will be built in.<br />
if intimidation of the weak is built into our workplaces it is built into the<br />
Tcohme mCuonaitlyit. on's industrial relations proposals are atac tic to disguise their real<br />
policy. And their real policy would make a monumental change not just to<br />
something abstract called the industrial relations system it will make a<br />
monumental change to the balances in Australian society.<br />
It will, effectively by stealth, take away the one means. by which workers have<br />
always been able to level up the social equation the right to join together and<br />
bargain collectively.<br />
In other words the Coalition's agenda is not just about low wages it is about<br />
moving the balance towards employers and away from workers.<br />
We can see it in the fine print of the infamous January 8th sech<br />
We can see it in their planned legislation on strike activity. They want to take<br />
away from workers any capacity for industrial action. They want the world of<br />
work to be defined by employers on the one hand, and individual workers<br />
acting alone on the other.<br />
John Howard said this just two days ago " individual contracts are lerrific!', he<br />
said. The Coalition applauded the actions of CRA in the recent dispute at Weipa,<br />
just because they were individual contracts.<br />
They did not mind that workers doing the same jobs as others were paid up to<br />
$ 20,000 a year more suiply because they weren't ass ated with collective<br />
bargains. The government believed strongly that this was wrong, and the<br />
Australian Industrial Relations Commission brought down exacly that ruling.<br />
There is dlearly a place for individual contracts. But we say there must be the<br />
capacity to negotiate conftras without discimination against collective 4667 </p>
<p>We say that an industrial relations system that denies workers freedom of<br />
assciation and . ollective action is unnalanced. urtair. and ultimately Fo<br />
Sworkabje. grt<br />
And yet that is the gist of the legislation. It is hidden but it is unmistakably Yo.<br />
there. del 001<br />
Consider this: Th;<br />
The Coalition said that strikes would be illegal for the duration of a Workplace are<br />
Agreement. wit<br />
Now imagine some of the circumstances that might justify workers taking It i;<br />
industrial action when the contract is in place. W1<br />
Imagine a workplace in which asbestos becomes a threat to the health of me<br />
workers and the employer is not prepared to take corrective action.<br />
Imagine a workplace in which safety procedures are poor and the employer is oft<br />
not prepared to take corrective action. wa<br />
Imagine a boss persistently engaging in harrassment. WIr in<br />
Even under these extreme circumstances. according to the Coalition, a strike war<br />
would be illegal. And illegal means just that time in prison for those taking ind.<br />
industrial action. Yo<br />
When Peter Reith was asked about this aspect of the Coalition's policy in yok<br />
1993, he admitted that a gaol sentence for the striking worker could follow. Th,<br />
There is more. in i<br />
of<br />
Because the Coalition's policy makes it illegal to strike while an agreement is<br />
in place, for many employers the strategic thing would be to stagger individual It i:<br />
contracts so that a disgruntled co-worker could never have other employee val<br />
support for action. to t<br />
What the Coalition has in mind is legislation for employers, pure and simple. Ant<br />
Legislation that will make it close to impossible for workers to bargain or chi<br />
negotiate or protest collectively. Ark<br />
So what does the Opposition hope to achieve by these proposals? Iib<br />
Higher labour productivy? But labour productivity in Australia has been more ow<br />
than twice that of New Zealand in the four years since they introduced an<br />
individual contract system. WE orm<br />
Less strikes? But wev had less strikes in the last year than in any year since<br />
1940. Under the Acrol te number of working days lost per 1.000 workers An<br />
has been cut by 67 per cent since the Coalition was last in power.<br />
4668 </p>
<p>For economic growth? But we've got growth. For inflation? But we've got<br />
growth with low inflation.<br />
You can run through half a dozen hypothetical reasons why they are so<br />
determined on this course. And you can't find a plausible answer until you<br />
come to the question of lower wages and insecure jobs.<br />
That is the Coalition model and it always has been the Coalition model. They<br />
are utterly obsessed with the notion that Australian business cannot prosper<br />
without a scramble in the labour market for low paid jobs.<br />
It is part of the Coalition vision as much a part now as it always was.<br />
What the Coalition means by labour market reform is wage cutting. They<br />
mean ripping away job security from hundreds of thousands of Australians.<br />
What they mean by labour market reform is a fundamental shift in the balance<br />
of the most fundamental of social relationships the relationship between<br />
workers and employers.<br />
What their proposals will also mean although they refuse to consider the<br />
implications is a direct assault on thousands of workers' families. Reduce<br />
wages, worsen conditions. cut penalty rates. reduce security and<br />
4iependence and you hurt families.<br />
You hurt their income, your hurt the opportunities available to their children,<br />
you hurt communities.<br />
Theywilcall what wesay ascare campanof course -but noone oudbe<br />
in any doubt that this debate on industrial relations goes to the very essence<br />
of the diffierence between Labor and the Coalition.<br />
It is about the soit of society we want Australia to be. It's about how much we<br />
value each other. It's about how deep the feeling runs that we are all entitled<br />
to fair treatment in Australia.<br />
And in ths campaign it is also about the truth: the Coalition hias not had a<br />
change of heart, it has had a change of tactic.<br />
And Australian workers and thewiryiles stand to be the losers.<br />
It is fundamental to Labors cause that we resist this and that we re-affirm our<br />
own vision and our own record.<br />
We have a very good story to tell of the last four years, and an even better<br />
one to tell about the future of this country.<br />
And in the next three weks across the country we are going to tef. l it. 4669 </p>
