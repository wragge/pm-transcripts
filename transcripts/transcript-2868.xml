NQ DATE<br />
27 March 1973<br />
S PRIR MINISTER TO VISIT IMIA<br />
~ The Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
Mr Whitlam, announced today that he would make a short visit<br />
to New Delhi from 4 to 7 June.<br />
Mr Whitlam recalled that, at his press conference<br />
* on 13 March, he had said he hoped to be able to accept an<br />
invitation from Mrs Gandhi to visit India this year. He had<br />
also said that no Australian Prime Minister had visited India<br />
since 1959. It had, therefore, given him considerable pleasure<br />
to hear last week from Mrs Gandhi that the dates in June which<br />
he had proposed were acceptable to her.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the visit would be to India only<br />
and would involve his being absent from Australia for slightly<br />
less than a week in all. He would be accompanied by his wife<br />
and by a small party of officials. ./ 2 </p>

Mr Whitlam went on to say that India, with its<br />
population of 548 million people, was known and accepted<br />
as the world's largest democracy. It was also a significant<br />
industrial and military power with an important part to play<br />
in the Asian region and a member of the Commonwealth. It was<br />
the predominant power in the Indian sub-continent. For all<br />
these reasons it was of considerable and growing importance<br />
to Australia. Mr Whitlam added that in recent years there had been<br />
increasing bilateral consultations and contacts.<br />
" Australia has sought to help and co-operate with<br />
India in tackling some of its economic problems," he said.<br />
" We have both followed with close interest and attention<br />
developments in South-East Asia and the Indian Ocean. Annual<br />
consultations are held between our respective Departments of<br />
Foreign Affairs." Mr Whitlam said he looked forward to discussing at<br />
first hand the various facets of our relations with India and<br />
to exchanging views with Mrs Gandhi on matters of common interest<br />
affecting our two countries.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that his visit to India was important<br />
also in the context of Australia's relationship with the Asian ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
region as a whole. He had recently made a successful visit to<br />
Indonesia. Later in the year he hoped to visit China and Japan.<br />
The forthcoming visit to India should be seen as part<br />
of a pattern of developing first-hand contacts at the head of<br />
government level with Australia's Asian neighbours.<br />
Mr Whitlam said he hoped that the visits he would be<br />
making this year would be followed up later by visits to other<br />
countries in the region. </p>
