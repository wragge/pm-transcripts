Yes it did. I. hadn't understood that he had not been well.<br />
I tnouht h ilht hAEVe been there for quite some time.<br />
PaUl T1,; 1e-.<br />
It's I-ard to be apoiLtical I know, but w.' hat sort of contribution<br />
do you thitk that he's made to Asrlaspolitical life?<br />
Prime Minister-:<br />
fie's made a distinctijv. e contribution to South Austral i an<br />
politics, and flowing out of that has had an impact on<br />
Australian politics overall. H4e's been, I think, qui-t e u -i i<br />
any other Prem1-ier b. c fore him. He's mada a very great<br />
contribution to the arts and to the % development of the arts.<br />
He as different. He contributced greatly and he worked<br />
very very hard. I think it is a great -tragedy that his<br />
poli-. ticL: a'L life hais ended through.-ill health. He is, in<br />
geZ eraL terms, still a pretty young man.<br />
Paul Brber:<br />
ill health is the reason that we are all given for his<br />
resm~ ton. I % e4 should accept that. I am just<br />
wonduering wheht aL raises the question in your mind<br />
about he-, alth amozng politicians generally, because most<br />
of ~ ve ia *-_ ctic lives. Is it a fairly common<br />
thing, do you r that politicians perhaps get run down<br />
and--doe-s that a their performance, do you think?<br />
r A 4Str f<br />
I i -Can It really is a most exhausting<br />
; o -7 rnt-ozt anding job put it that way. You have to le. arn<br />
to -vourse-l-_ because the demands on your own time are go-ing<br />
I! tusi ble. They just never end. In other words,<br />
z-; kej ot to know how to say For every invitation tUhat<br />
yo-ur~ acczept there are probably 10,20, 30, 40, 50, that have<br />
to b:~ ue~. Sometimes people will press very hard, sometimies<br />
your friends will press very hard but if they come in latncn<br />

Q u e stio n ( Cller)<br />
rr. P r imre Ministelr, Iwould like to ask you to Live up to<br />
your J-975 prcmrroses toPensioners. Your Budget-time argument<br />
for 12-montChly -increases instead of six-mionthly due to the<br />
Consumer Prtice Inde-; x being cut due to the fall1 in inflation<br />
making th-E increases naglible, has been proved quite wrong,'<br />
since inflation has again risen and your argumfen-t is no<br />
longer a valid one if it ever was.<br />
Prime MT-inister:_<br />
Inflation hasn't risen. The December Quarter Consumer Price<br />
Indax , was disappointing, I agree whthat but inflation has<br />
not riLsen. -Tho m-) veC down has flattened out but the 12-month<br />
rat,-e was siqnificantly below -the 12-month rate previously)<br />
and so inflation and has come down and it is going to continue<br />
to co-me ciow. n. VWe had some very difficult d-ecisions to mtake<br />
at the tjie-of the last Budget over a number of areas and<br />
one of : nm In 1975 inflation was 17 percent, it<br />
nait bre-n for a six-month period knocking 20 percent, 19 percent,<br />
an.; e nav got-aircat deal more stability into the economy.<br />
chat-did iro-restraining expenditure over a wide range<br />
o. r: s There 3ragain, many difficult decisions which in<br />
ot:-er timies peopl~ e Awould much prefer not to have had to take,<br />
believe th1-1-t overall the Budget is working very much<br />
ince ; rtterests . D Australia. We are starting to see now more<br />
1if -and in t ere s a stirring as somebody else said in<br />
~~-c. usrvand in telast few months of last year manufacturing<br />
er&gt; ovmnt taradto grow fEor the first time in many many years.<br />
Faciy da--ys yet, but I -think as a result of -the kind of<br />
have introduced, we are starting to see Australia<br />
on move.<br />
Ouas-~ on:( Paul ' Barber)<br />
Woi-. u be prepared to have another look at that pensi on<br />
situ TChough, because it has been the cause of concern for<br />
a lot .11 our callers. They say-, well-the rest of Australians<br />
have I-lf-yzearly indexation, why can't they? / 3 </p>
<p>3AW TAL -B3ACK 3<br />
Prime : ister:<br />
Sha%/-ner h v hlf-yearly inde. xalion, but alright, they<br />
igot circent last time, but they don't always get<br />
100 p: en:. ' Te-y gc maybe 50 percent, 60 percent, or<br />
perc t~ of ;, hhu. Wver the rate of inflation is. The<br />
coxn i to persioners, of course, is 100 percont, and<br />
tha, : umi-. cment is absol. ute.<br />
t think that, as some of our callers suggest, that<br />
you ar tre ating pensioners as second-class citizens?<br />
Prime 1Minister:<br />
T don't think so, because you see that makes a very great<br />
difference to if pensioners were to be treated the same<br />
as wau0n arners they would get the same indexation adjustment<br />
as wage earners. Now the Arbitration Commission sometimes<br />
says 100 percent but sometimes it might say 50 or 60 percent.<br />
I don't believe anyone believes that we should say 50 or 60 percent<br />
of the adjustment for pensioners and we've said it should<br />
be 100 percent. It will remain 100 percent, as it should.<br />
So there is a real distinction between the adjustments made<br />
for pensioners and the adjustments made for wage earners.<br />
Question: ( Paul Barber)<br />
Can you still give 100 percent, though, by doing it twice<br />
a vyear?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I know, but you said put them on the same position as wage<br />
earners. That's not a very good thing to do if wage<br />
earners are only 50 percent of the adjustment.<br />
Qu. stion: ( Paul 5ar. : r)<br />
By giving it to m at the same time as wage earners?<br />
P: ; inister:<br />
Th--' s not puttiL. g them on the same position.<br />
t "-. zke the proposition now of giving the 100 percent to<br />
a year.<br />
i'Ve .: ade our decision in relation to that. / 4 </p>

yiour wvill ro~ ynember tL-hat this legislation only applies in<br />
Ca'rraand there? are many tertiary students who are wonderirg<br />
what your Goven ,. nt and what you as Prime Minister can do<br />
t-o pror-.-cc the r. ight -s of students in all the Labor states<br />
and in Queens-la rtwhe -re tertiary students are still forced<br />
to joinI student uniLons before they can com-mence their<br />
tertiary educ tioni. Now, is there anything your Government<br />
can do to protect -the rights of these peiple?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Th-e legislation that hras been in-troduced in the Fecderal<br />
Par 1 Jam2an-wil 1 Le P:, s s -d because we be 1_ i th at it is totall1y<br />

which are totally agai-nst -the view s and inclinations of<br />
the student. In addition to that, we don't believe compulsion<br />
ok:-that kind iJs rcight. if student bodies want support they<br />
sh-ould be ebto attract support and I think that is the<br />
way i~ t c. ojht-to be. Now, Victoria has made some moves in that<br />
direction. Western_ Australia has. I would hope that other<br />
s-hztes w-J. ll follnw the Comrmonwealth legislation. I think. it<br />
is s L r ancj th at in universities people claim this is<br />
P].-ce of ac&amp; eia~ mc freedom, this is the place of intellectual<br />

V' vs~ u~ come ! baci from-t a time anbroad and learnt with<br />
groar; disma-that tankls have been 7out on blocks, as it were,<br />
0oL; t ofI co mss ion. Now, the war that your Government put<br />
us in-t o, and1 in uich some of us suffered very badly, what<br />
is the d-efeonce policy of this country? Are we serious<br />
about dctfendirng i-* C?<br />
Pr-imat r-11nis ter:<br />
Yes off course weare and I think, it ought to be under stoord1<br />
that it cught tr be_-understood that -for each of-the l1ast<br />
-th-r yo<_ ars="" sicgnific_-nty="" norce="" dollars="" and="" more="" in="" real=""></_>
is, more recsources have bea:-n made available to defence.<br />
Inat we,,' ve seekinq -to do is to make sure that a larger<br />
proportion oj: " L4e total defence voeis spent on capital<br />
equipment. During the previous administration, in one year,<br />
the expenditure On capital equipmtent was as low as 6 perceni<br />
I think 3. V percent of the defence vote. Well now we've<br />
got thI'at ' Figure hbacl -to between 14 and 15 percent. It's<br />
still not high enough. Part of the process of getting the<br />
rcct geup b~ een to keep a very tight rein on. other<br />

tc. t--x-2s and it is hard to understand in the bulk'terms,<br />
bt'c--n: t-;-xp ayers this year -in spite of that temporary<br />
tax in the last Budget -are paying $ 3,000 million<br />
less txtha-n tihey~ ; dould have if the tax scales that prevailed<br />
when~ tok. offce were still in force. Now you transiate<br />

substan ti a savjnc of several dollars a week. We understand<br />
and are ) Cymuci-concerned about the point you make about<br />
high taxes and w~ m would like to be in a positiona to reduce<br />

COLLLJ. you put a percentage on -that?<br />
No, 1 Uon' t think you can. 1 think the basic thrust of the<br />
purpose of mizost pensions is probably right and proper. But<br />
for eva-y particular pension there are probably some who<br />
abuse tesystem and take advantage of it. / 8 </p>

the case I mentionec, I thiink, it aould be very hard to<br />
hav--rz ministrativ-L, procedures that stopped it.<br />
0uestion: ( caller)<br />
I'm afraid RAwueos tralians are beginning to doubt your<br />
cre. ij. bility an%-I regard you as becoming perhaps one of<br />
the mcnx t n~' l i governments in the world and the<br />
poin-c w'hzich I wlish to draw to your attention is not just<br />
me-, falsit of many of your promises or many<br />

wz. u is the s-crecy of your Government, which of course<br />
scrcrt in the western world.<br />

Can yo,. give an example? / 9 </p>

I think thacthi raally is a great deal of nonsense I've<br />
never statisUics of this Jkind put -together and the<br />
roc~ L-Lhat ha-e been published in the time of moy<br />
Goi.-rnioient 1aeee n fEull and operi and that' s going -to<br />

a-t' thj; [ momen~ ft Lroelom of informat-ion legisation and<br />
we are commitLtera to , naking as much information available<br />
to te pblic as is possible. TI' -, ep cuA ite certain that we've<br />
acted upon that. Yo~ u know, the person who just asked that<br />
question seemed to have a large nurtbe: r of allegations to<br />
make but I don-t -think he had any substance in any part of it.<br />
Question: wantozd fi~ rst ': to congr atLulate you on the ( inaudible)<br />
Ithflink it Is a ver-y oac or Australi-a to get into the.<br />
Jxnt -rnatinalL market som-2how and about the tax-es how<br />
can woe expect the r-eduiction of taxes when people don't<br />
want to work f a!-all, if the-y d'. on) t work, they don' t<br />
earn any m_. oney and they don't pay taxes and then the<br />
Govern~ ment is njto -s give them money but they can' t<br />
maky-? it becausz if ou start printing oney then we are<br />
back to scxuare one.<br />
Prfi I~ nister:<br />
I mn: I agralwit everything that y,, ou've said. if<br />
gover~-nets ornt % ney we just add to inflation and that<br />
a lot ofamage noveryone. The more people do work the<br />

Q ( Pa BajrLb er)<br />
W" n:. nutti ~ e of people not wanting to work. I mean<br />
co1 ~ put a figure on how many Australians<br />
r7~ :.ñ nister:<br />
Its q-ate impossible. Quite obviously under present<br />
c ir-stances there are people who want to work but find it<br />
ver-icil to get work. On the other hand, I think we<br />
all stories of some people banding together in houses<br />
and together and not really going out and looking<br />
for a and maybe not taking a job when it is offered<br />
to the-' i I've heard of instances of this in the city and<br />
in country areas and I think it is one of the symptoms of </p>
<p>3AW TAL' -D. ACK 1.0<br />
Pvrme c-ter: ( cont tnudc)<br />
I. ho : ic asanceC gher(! unneomplovym-cnt is too hLgh. But when<br />
. hre moro job vaconcies, as recovery in the economy<br />
nahr pce, i think it will be much easier to test<br />
pLopI . L) d see 1whether tlhey really want to work or<br />
WhetQ: 2hev don-t.<br />
O-e ( Pau~ l Barbor)<br />
_ o he3. rd instances of people doing that sort<br />
* 1i!. aWvte you done aboit it? Have you sent<br />
Comrnonwieulth people around there to find out why they<br />
don't v , nt zo work?<br />
Dasically, if people apply to a particular employer for<br />
a job and don't want that job they make it perfectly plain.<br />
They are ofren cdoino so so that they will remain on<br />
unemployment benefits. I've had a number of employers,<br />
small and larqe, making that point to me.<br />
Question. ( Paul Barber)<br />
fave thoso-cases been followed by one of the DepartmenLs?<br />
Pri'e Minister:<br />
When that does happen the employers are meant to make thei:<br />

FP: rie Miniss tr<br />
They w. old be stopped for a time, yes. I don't anyone to<br />
assume that I'm saying that's everyone. I know very well<br />
it's I know there are people who want to work and<br />
who f-ELd it very difficult to get work under present<br />
circuL: st ances.<br />
Question ( Paul Barber)<br />
I'm surprised at what you say about long hair, and thongs<br />
and thal kind of thing... I wouldn't have thought that the<br />
appearance necessarily meant that the person didn't want<br />
to work.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well if somebody wants a receptionist and you turned up<br />
with no shoes on and whatever--you said thongs I meant<br />
no thongs either.<br />
Question: ( caller)<br />
Have you every though of the superannuation people. My husbad<br />
is a public servant and at 60, as a returned serviceman, he<br />
can retire now but he cocs on a 45 percent pension and i have<br />
ben listening with interest to the elderly pension during<br />
the week. We have to pay taxes, we don't get any reduction<br />
on -3tes, phones, medical and things like that. Now, I'm<br />
an arthritic and on one of my tablets it's $ 27 for 100.<br />
I often w. onder if the pensioners think of these people that<br />
are paying superannuation and then they just don't get any<br />
benefits at all.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
If you are on those tablets as a result of a doctor's<br />
prescription for arthritis isn't that on the national health?<br />
Question: ( caller)<br />
No, it's not. They are $ 27 for 100 and I have to take four<br />
a dcawhich means every 25 days you have to pay $ 27 for tablets.<br />
Pri.. ie Minister:<br />
Ic not necessarily over the airwaves but I'd like to<br />
i: to that if I could and I wonder if it would be<br />
. sor s e for you to leave your name and address with the<br />
stac. n, and the name of the tablets, because I would like<br />
to look in and find out why they are not on the national health.<br />
Ouesicn: ( Paul Barber)<br />
What are you going to do with your pension, by the way, when<br />
you retire? / 12 </p>

v e, tho. ugh bout what you're going to do wi. th the<br />
p": n -cn. though?<br />
I'd pro-bably go fishing.<br />
Question: ( Paul Barber)<br />
I don't know whether there's many pensioners in the community<br />
who could do that on their pension these days?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think a lot of people in Australia go fishing. It hasn't<br />
got to be an expensive pastime.<br />
Question: ( caller)<br />
A. ustralian petrol prices have gone up 47 percent in the<br />
last year, thus putting Australia in the bracket of three<br />
nations with the highest petrol prices in the world. Your<br />
Government's policy is to put the Australian price on<br />
an equivalent basis with other nations but we have surpassed<br />
all but two other countries. I would therefore like to ask,<br />
is your lack of concern based on the fact that you are<br />
chauffer-driven in brand new Government vehicles on petrol<br />
paid for by the people and not personally by yourself.<br />
Prim. e Minister:<br />
No, not at all. I suppose if you want to deal with it on<br />
a p'rsonal basis you could say that on the farm we use a<br />
gre-t deal of petrol and that's gets paid for as anyone<br />
els ' s petrol gets paid for. I think you misunderstand the<br />
or the reason, for the Government's policies. We were<br />
in situation wher-oil search in Australia had stopped.<br />
Pac'-ie weren't drilling for oil. They weren't developing<br />
fu: r h r existing holes because this is an expensive business<br />
ani -: plorers, developing companies, could get more by<br />
gand developing oil in other places where they'd<br />
gc-c~^ thng much nearer to the world parity price for<br />
wh .: ar they found. The policies of the previous administration<br />
oil search just at a time when there was a severe world<br />
cri::' in oil. Now, as a result of our pricing policies, and<br />
as resuit of some other inducements oil search is again<br />
getting underway in a healthy fashion in Australia. As a<br />
result oi our policies by 1984 or 1985, 30-to A0% of the<br />
oil that we will be using will be coming from reserves that<br />
have beien proven, developed, as a result of our changed policies.<br />
So I th'.: i that is showing that they are being successful. / 13 </p>

S Qu't. oie.: ( Paul _ irber)<br />
I I've been given a roujhn order of and<br />
t h results o' that about 12 o'clock.<br />
Ot. on: ( Paul Darber)<br />
c i: n-y -re b: iif a million unemployed, as the papers<br />
. re suqgesting this morning, are you worried about<br />
the psychological impact of that. It seems to me that<br />
once you get to the stage of half a million unemployed,<br />
you oare really getting into the big league there's no<br />
do; bt about that.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think it will be under that figure, on what I've been<br />
told. iWe knew we would be hitting a seasonal. peak at this<br />
time and I believe that we need to look at the other side<br />
of the ledger. In the last two or three months of 1973<br />
calendar year, over time was up to highor levels than it had<br />
obrean for many years; emiployment in manufacturing industry,<br />
'. ieed, private civilian employment, increased in a way<br />
: 1-at it _ Llso had not for many years.<br />
C-uLiion: ( Paul Barber)<br />
But with respect... ( tape turned over)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
. anfactur: ing emLployment had been reducing over a long period<br />
because it hbeame very uncompetitive as a result of the<br />
of .1 result of ( inaudible) of wages increases four or five<br />
ve s ago. I think all the signs in the Australian economy<br />
ar_ point-ing to tnhat position being changed. Manufacturing<br />
inC stry is starting to look ahead w. ith much greater confidence<br />
it had for a very very long while. Unless that happens<br />
, we are not going to solve the unemployment problem because<br />
i . pcndis upon selling more Australian goods in the Australian<br />
I depends upon Australian factories being able to<br />
ianto ex,, ort imarkets and being able to sell in export mar: e. s<br />
S e more they can sell the more Australian people will be<br />
in the factories making those products.<br />
O&gt; -ion: ( Paul Barber)<br />
ese figures are announced today do you intend to ride<br />
ouu : he obvious complaints and criticisms that there are going<br />
to or are you going to... / 17 </p>

or :-in questions andt then not givuing an opportunity for<br />
I: c-: nraen T h~ k zeh-cd expcriences of that kind onceC<br />
b--for-1n it is roally much more helpful if you do give<br />
a rai~ lror the answiqe.<br />
Tesocts ofE figqu-es that will come out today ha'ze been<br />
u 2. For a lonq while so there is no surprise about it.<br />
l1h. n o SLLtUden change. The po-int I am making is that<br />
thea uindt~ rlyirg thrust a-rd help for the Australian manufacturing<br />
i ~ ursy today is much better than it has been<br />
for a long while. People are looking to the Lfuture with a<br />
groat C. 2al of: confidence. The Ford order book,-s and many<br />
Australian f: onpanies are fuller than they have been for many<br />
N\' 3ars anid therefore we are moving into a much better situation<br />
than we've had. Ithink it is early days and if you like,<br />
the sjqns are stil tentative. Retail sales at the end of<br />
last. ycear? coupled with thie -improvement in overall euiploymert<br />
J-n a number of industries, gives us mnuch greater hope for<br />
confidence in 1979 and it is my very firm view that -this is<br />
coming to be widlely recog~ nise-d outside.<br />

of ajn d 600 people a day and over the course of a week<br />
Ti.-e t. O) speak to most of these people they are all concerned<br />
ab--uc the-iir children. Without exce-ption they all say " why<br />
71 oZe-; I -. C the Government reintroduce National Service?" Also,<br />
i~ r says that we cant ask our people who receive the<br />
aole to work, but we've got a responsibility to these young<br />
peopl to give them incentive and ambition and while we are<br />
givir~ a thkem the dole without requiring anything for it, we<br />
are t" h.'-ncj away their ambition and we have plenty of land<br />
ownednl the Board of Works, not owned, but controlled by<br />
the Dcr~ of Wocks . Could we give these young people an<br />
OPPO-ur-4ty to produce wildlife type give the responsibiliLy<br />
tw. o dlays a week for their dole and the ro-sponsibility<br />
Of pl~ z7,. ning and build3.-nq wildlife parks along the banks of<br />

<p>i qll 1 u r: serstand The concerns that you have in tnis<br />

. no. t of neoulo are inte'rested in the rc-intrnoduction<br />
nna l Serv c i t if ' ational Service were to be<br />
Inr c tin thlat would have to aply for a whole<br />

ffor a Arir) S Cc: hur than for defence, under the pcesent timai:<br />
it c-. racr e difficulties with it, quite apart from the cost.<br />
Sdor't Think it ould help the defence effort in the short-term<br />
where the major recuirement is to get more modern equipment<br />
into the detence forces. The point you make about young<br />
popDIa Losinc their ambition and incentive through receiving<br />
ur-nemployent benefits I think can b: a very real one. This<br />
is why a large part of the training progra7mmes that we have<br />
introduced have been designed cquite specifically to create<br />
opportuni[ ties for people, and especially for young unemployed.<br />
Over the course of this year something well over 100,000<br />
Australians, and many of them young Australians, will be<br />
helped in the various training programmes. Ian Viner, the<br />
Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, will be seckinq to<br />
est'ablish community based support prograimmes whiich will give<br />
young pople not in work the opportunity of doing some<br />
co:. piminty service of the kind that you mentioned. It. woulc n'<br />
a cor: p. rulsorv. It would be voluntary but I would hope that<br />
a significant numbe-: of young people % would want to particip.-e..<br />
-a are seeking to meet the concerns that you mentioned throuql<br />
tra. ining programnme. s which have alrea" y helped well over<br />
300,000 Austr-alians and about 100,000 over the course of<br />
this financial year and then for the development of a community<br />
scheme which I hone will meet the kind of things that you<br />
have in mind.<br />
Question: ( Paul Barber)<br />
get very ann-oyed when people interrupt you, why?<br />
