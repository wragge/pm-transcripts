ACTING PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 9 JANUARY 1986<br />
Their Excellencies the Governor-General and Lady Stephen<br />
will be visiting Thailand from 14 to 21 January 1987 at<br />
the invitation of His Majesty the King of Thailand.<br />
Their Excellencies' visit to Thailand will follow the<br />
very successful visit to Australia in December 1985 of<br />
the Crown Prince of Thailand, HRH-Maha Vajiralongkorn.<br />
During their stay, as well as visiting Bangkok and<br />
Chiang Mai, Their Excellencies will travel to the<br />
ancient capital of Sukhothai, including a visit to the<br />
historical site of Si Satchanali and the joint Thai<br />
Australian Ceramics Archaeological Project. At<br />
Kanchanaburi, they will participate in a wreath laying<br />
ceremony at Australian war graves.<br />
The visit, the first by an Australian Governor-General<br />
to Thailand, is an important mark of the friendly and<br />
active relationship between Australia and Thailand,<br />
which encompasses a wide range of areas, including joint<br />
efforts on international trade issues, commerce,<br />
development assistance, defence co-operation and<br />
cultural exchanges.<br />
Sir James Rowland, Governor of New South Wales,<br />
will administer the Government of the Commonwealth of<br />
Australia during the Governor-General's absence. </p>
