PRfIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 89<br />
8 May 1973<br />
STRATEGIC EXPORT CONTROLS<br />
The Government has taken a decision on a<br />
report by Departments on the question of strategic<br />
export controls over commercial trade.<br />
It has been decided that Australia will no<br />
longer maintain on commercial trade with the U. S. S. R.,<br />
Eastern Europe, China, North Korea, North Viet-Nam and<br />
Cuba, restraints different from the restraints on<br />
commercial trade maintained on any other country.<br />
The controls which have been maintained by<br />
Australia have not proved, in recent years, to have<br />
much relevance to our production and it has therefore<br />
been decided to treat trade with all countries on a<br />
similar basis. It is well known that controls by other<br />
western countries have been progressively reduced and<br />
the United States and European countries are selling<br />
highly sophisticated material to the communist countries.<br />
We have notified a number of our closest<br />
friends of this decision and assured them that Australia<br />
will not be a means towards circumventing any controls<br />
which they may maintain over their own production.<br />
This decision has no bearing on the controls<br />
which are-maintained by Australia over the export of<br />
arms and war-like stores and a+ tomic energy material.<br />
The embargo on trade with North Viet-Nam is<br />
being removed and we consider this is appropriate in<br />
view of the establishment of relations with that<br />
country.<br />
