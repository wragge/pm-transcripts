    <content><![CDATA[<p>It’s terrific to be joining the second last day of Pollie Pedal. It is nice to swap the Royal Australian Air Force jet for the bike!</p>
<p>It is great to be here in Mudgee in Mark Coulton’s electorate. It is terrific to be with Kevin Andrews, with Angus Taylor, with Guy Barnett and of course with Ara Cresswell from Carers Australia.</p>
<p>In the end, this is for the carers of our country; the people who care for someone in need. The great thing about all of these people is that they are putting themselves out every day 24/7 for someone they love.</p>
<p>Obviously, there is a lot the Government does for the carers of our country but I want to thank my colleagues and everyone involved in this ride over the last few days for literally and metaphorically going the extra mile for the carers of our country; letting the carers of our country know that the commitment of at least some of their leaders in Canberra is not just official but it is personal and practical as well.</p>
<p>I am so sorry that I have been a bit of a Pollie Pedal absentee for the first six days of the ride.</p>
<p>Thank you, Kevin, for leading the ride up until now and I hope you don’t mind if I steal the baton from your knapsack.</p>
<p>It is terrific to be here.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to a very good ride but most of all, Ara and team, it is just going to be great to be with you and to be doing something for those Australians who need recognition, who need a hand, and hopefully this is part of doing just that.</p>
