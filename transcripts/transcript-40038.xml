    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian House of Representatives will trial a new Constituency Question Time that will give Members an opportunity to ask specific questions relating to their electorates and the matters raised with them by their constituents.</p>
<p>From the next sitting week until the end of the year the Government will trial ‘Constituency Question Time’ to run every sitting day as part of Questions Without Notice.</p>
<p>Prime Minister the Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP said the change to the running of Question Time will present greater opportunities for Government MPs, and if they choose Opposition MPs, to bring local issues in their electorate to the attention of relevant Ministers.</p>
<p>“Representing their community is the first priority of every MP, regardless of which side of the House they sit on,” Mr Turnbull said.</p>
<p>This change to Question Time was originally proposed by the Leader of the House, the Hon Christopher Pyne MP, in a speech to the Institute of Public Affairs at the beginning of 2013.</p>
<p>“Local issues are the bread and butter of every Member’s job and the genuine concerns of constituents deserve to feature prominently in the Parliament,” Mr Pyne said.</p>
<p>This will typically involve approximately 5 questions from Government Members to relevant Ministers each day. </p>
