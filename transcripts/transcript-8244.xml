PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA18 JANUARY 1991<br />
The Australian Government condemns and deplores Iraq's<br />
missile attack on Israel.<br />
The attack is entirely unprovoked. It confirms that Iraq's<br />
regime is not interested in limiting and shortening this<br />
tragic war, but in widening it.<br />
We are particularly concerned that the nature of the attack<br />
indicates a deliberate Iraqi policy to attack civilian<br />
targets of no strategic significance.<br />
Our thoughts go to all civilians throughout the Middle East<br />
caught up in this terrible conflict.<br />
We call on Saddam Hussein to avoid catastrophe for his<br />
nation by ceasing attacks on Israel, and immediately<br />
complying with UN demands to withdraw from Kuwait.<br />
