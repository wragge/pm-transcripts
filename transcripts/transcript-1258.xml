FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 16/ 1966<br />
BRITISH DEFENCE REVIEW<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
I am pleased to see the affirmation in the White<br />
Paper of the British Government's belief that Britain should<br />
continue to maintain considerable strength in the Far East and<br />
South East Asia. In particular, I welcome its recognition of the<br />
importance of the retention of the Singapore and Malaysian<br />
military bases. The Australian Government believes that preservation<br />
of the defence situation in the South East Asian area requires<br />
common effort. Consultations will continue on various matters<br />
related to our mutual co-operation, including the exchange of<br />
information at military level on the question of military<br />
facilities in Australia in certain contingencies.<br />
To a very large degree, the principles relating<br />
to this area given explanation in the Wdhite Paper were discussed<br />
and taken into account at the time of the visit of Mr. Healey,<br />
the British Defence Minister.<br />
CANBERRA, 23rd February, 1966. </p>
