NOTES FOR THE PRIHE MINISTER<br />
CITIZEN MI1LITARY FORCES ASSOCIATION__ LU'-CII 4I I) LCLMBER, 94<br />
CITIZEN MILITARY FORCES HAVE PLAYED A LONG, HONOURABLE<br />
AND IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DEFENCE OF AUSTRALIA, WHILE THE 14ATURE<br />
OF THE ROLE OF THE RESERVE FORCES MAY BE SEEN TO alHANGE OVER<br />
THE YEARS, THERE IS NO DOUBTING THE CONTINUING SIGNIFICANCE<br />
OF THESE FORCES. iHE ARMY RESERVE, OR CHF AS IT USED TO BE<br />
KNOWN,, IS A VITAL PART OF AUSTRALIA'S GROUND FORCE CAPABILITY.<br />
IT FORMS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE BASIS OF EXPANSION OF THE<br />
WHOLE ARMY SHOULD THE NEED ARISE.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT' S. APPROACH TO THE NEEDS AND<br />
STRUCTURING OF THE RESERVE IS BASED ON ITS RECOGNITION OF<br />
THE VITAL ROLE WHICH IT PLAYS. WE WERE NOT SATISFIED THAT THE<br />
RESERVE FORCES HAD BEEN PROPERLY TREATED BY PREVIOUS<br />
GOVERNMENTS. THE MORALE OF THE CMF SUFFERED BADLY FROM THE<br />
WAY IT WAS TREATED AS A DUMPING GROUND FOR CONSCRIPTS, OR<br />
A HAVEN FOR MEN WANTING TO AVOID CONSCRIPTION, MEN WHO HAD<br />
JOINED THE CNF AND INDICATED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE<br />
OVERSEAS IF NECESSARY IN DEFENCE OF THEIR COUNTRY FOUND<br />
THEIR SERVICES WERE NOT SOUGHT. OR WANTED.<br />
My GOVERNMENT ABOLIS HED CONSCRIPTION AND SET<br />
ABOUT MAKING SERVICE IN THE ARMED FORCES MORE ATTRACTIVE<br />
TO VOLUNTEERS. LAST YEAR, AS PART OF ITS EFFORTS TO REVITALISE<br />
DEFENCE, THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO HAVE A COMPLETE REVIEW<br />
OF THE ROLE AND FUNCTIONING OF THE RESERVE, THE MINISTER </p>
<p>-2-<br />
FOR DEFENCE, MR P) ARNARD, COMMISSIONED THE FIRST-EVER<br />
INDEPENDENT INQUIRY INTO THE CMF. THE COMMITTEE WAS LED<br />
BY DR T. B. MILLAR AND ITS REPORT WAS TABLED IN PARLIAMENT<br />
ON APRIL 4 THIS YEAR.<br />
AT THE TIME MR BARNARD TABLED THE REPORT, HE<br />
LEFT NO DOUBT OF THIS GOVERNMENT'S INTENTION TO REVITALISE<br />
THE ARMY RESERVE. HE INDICATED THEN, AND ON SEVERAL OTHER<br />
OCCASIONS SINCE, THAT HE FULLY SUPPORTED THE BROAD<br />
RESTRUCTURING OF THE CMF RECOMMENDED BY THE CMF COMMITTEE<br />
OF INQUIRY. As PART OF THE NORMAL PROCESS OF PROTECTING<br />
NATIONAL SECURITY WE NEED TO MAINTAIN SOME REGULAR FORCES<br />
CAPABLE OF BEING IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE, AND THESE NEED TO<br />
BE BACKED UP BY RESERVE FORCES WHICH CAN BE BROUGHT TO A<br />
STATE OF READINESS IN A REASONABLY SHORT TIME. THE<br />
RESERVES MUST BE INTEGRATED WITH THE REGULARS, WITHOUT<br />
MAJOR RE-ARRANGEMENT AS IN THE PAST. REGULAR AND RESERVE<br />
COMPONENTS ARE TO BE WELDED INTO A " TOTAL FORCE" THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN ARMY. THE ARMY RESERVE, TOGETHER WITH THE<br />
REGULAR ARMY WILL PROVIDE A VIABLE BASE FOR AN EXPANSION OF<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN ARMY SHOULD THIS BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE.<br />
WE WILL HAVE A REGULAR COMPONENT ANT) A RESERVE COMPONENT<br />
WORKING TOGETIILPR ON A RASIS AS NTFAR TO EQUALITY AND<br />
PARTNERSHIP AS THEIR RESPECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ALLOW. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
TO GIVE EFFECT TO THI1S POLICY, THE ARMY RESERVE<br />
IS TO BE INTEGRATED INTO THE FUNCTIONAL COMMAND ORGANISATION<br />
OF THE REGULAR ARMY. IN ADDITION, ARMY RESERVE OFFICERS ARE<br />
TO BE APPOINTED As ASSISTANT COMMANDERS To FIELD FORCE<br />
COMMAND, LOGISTICS COMMAND AND TRAINING COMMAND. IN FACT,<br />
THE ASSISTANT COMMANDER TRAINING COMMAND HAS ALREADY ASSUMED<br />
OFFICE. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALSO APPROVED THAT RESERVE<br />
SOLDIERS WEAR COMPARABLE UNIFORM WITH THAT WORN By REGULAR<br />
SOLDIERS. IN GENERAL, THE CMF AT PRESENT CAN ONLY BE USED IN<br />
TIME OF WAR OR IN THE EVENT OF A DECLARED DEFENCE EMERGENCY.<br />
MR BARNARD HAS, ON A NUMB ER OF OCCASIONS, STATED WITHOUT<br />
RESERVATION THAT THE BROAD ROLE ENVISAGED FOR THE ARMY<br />
RESERVE, WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR EMPLOYMENT OF THE RESERVE<br />
IN SITUATIONS SHORT OF A DEFENCE EMERGENCY, IN CIVIL<br />
EMERGENCIES OR TO PROVIDE OTHER ASSISTANCE TO CIVIL AUTHORITIES<br />
AND ORGANISATIONS. LEGISLATION MUST BE ENACTED TO GIVE FULL<br />
EFFECT TO THIS ROLE AND THE ARMY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE<br />
ARE STILL EXAMINING THE MANY COMPLEX ISSUES INVOLVED IN THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF LEGISLATION.<br />
WHEN THE MINISTER FOR DEFENCE TABLED THE MILLAR<br />
REPORT IN PARLIAMENT HE SUPPORTED THE BROAD RESTRUCTURING<br />
OF THE FORCES WHICH IT PROPOSED. CLEARLY THE GOVERNMENT ' S<br />
INTENTION IS TO ADVANCE THE ARMY RESERVE, AND IT HAS ALREADY<br />
IMPLEMENTED SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE COMMITTEE.<br />
14/ 1 </p>
<p>MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS APPROVED SINCE 14 APRIL<br />
1974 INCLUDE:-THE APPOINTMENT OF MAJOR GENERAL A. C. MURCHISON<br />
AS INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE ARMY RESERVE ( IN<br />
ADDITION TO HIS APPOINTMENT AS CITIZEN MILITARY<br />
FORCES MEMBER). ON HIS RETIREMENT ON 27 OCTOBER<br />
HE WAS REPLACED BY MAJOR GENERAL J. M. MACDONALD.<br />
THE ARMY RESERVE BRANCH IN ARMY OFFICE HAS BEEN<br />
RAISED AND MAJOR GENERAL B. A. MCDONALD HAS<br />
BEEN APPOINTED AS CHIEF OF THE ARMY RESERVE,<br />
THE RESERVE BRANCH HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH THE<br />
PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF REPRESENTING ARMY<br />
RESERVE INTERESTS AND WILL DIRECT ALL ASPECTS OF<br />
THE RE-ORGANISATION AND OVERSEE ITS IMPLEMENTATION.<br />
THE BRANCH HAS A STATUS EQUAL TO ALL OTHER BRANCHES<br />
AT ARMY OFFICE.<br />
RECRUITING ADVERTISEMENTS ARE ALREADY USING THE<br />
NEW TITLE " ARMY RESERVE". THERE IS, OF COURSE,<br />
THE NEED FOR LEGAL CHANGE TO GIVE FULL EFFECT TO<br />
THIS NEW TITLE.<br />
A CHANGE IN THlE CLOTHING ENTITLEMENTS FOR THE<br />
ARMY RESERVE HAS NOW BEEN APPROVED. THIS NOW<br />
PUTS THE ARMY RESERVE ON A COMPARABLE BASIS WITH<br />
THE REGULAR ARMY. </p>
<p>MR BARNARD REFERRED THE QUESTION OF PAY FOR THE<br />
RESERVES OF ALL THE SERVICES TO THE COMMITTEE OF REFERENCE<br />
FOR DEFENCE FORCE PAY, AN INDEPENDENT BODY UNDER THE<br />
JUDICIAL CHAIRMANSHIP OF MR JUSTICE COLDHAM, A RECOMMENDATION<br />
HAS NOT YET BEEN RECEIVED FROM THE COMMITTEE OF REFERENCE<br />
THOUGH IT IS EXPECTED SHORTLY, HOWEVER, AS A MEANS OF<br />
IMMEDIATELY IMPROVING THE RESERVE CONDITIONS SALARIES WERE<br />
INCREASED BY 12 PER CENT AS FROM 1 JULY 1974,<br />
THE MILLAR REPORT ACKNOWLEDGED THE RECENT WIDENING<br />
OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN MEMBERS TO SERVE IN THE RESERVE AND<br />
RECOMMENDED FURTHER RELAXATION OF RESTRICTIONS AS CIRCUMSTANCES<br />
ALLOWED. STEPS HAVE ALREADY BEEN TAKEN BY THE ARMY IN THIS<br />
DIRECTION INCLUDING:-THE RESTRICTION OF ENLISTMENT OF WOMEN WITH<br />
DEPENDENT CHILDREN HAS BEEN REMOVED,<br />
THE RECOMMENDATION THAT AGE LIMITATIONS ON<br />
ENLISTMENTS, DISCHARGE, AND COMMISSIONING<br />
FOR WOMEN SHOULD BE THE SAME AS FOR MEN WILL<br />
BE IMPLEMENTED AS SOON AS CHANGES TO STATUTORY<br />
REGULATIONS CAN BE MADE, FOR INSTANCE, THE<br />
MINIMUM AGE FOR COMMISSIONED RANK WILL BE<br />
18 YEARS ( CURRENTLY IT IS 21 YEARS FOR WOMEN,<br />
18 FOR MEN), </p>
<p>-6-<br />
APPROVAL HAS BEEN GIVEN FOR WOMEN TO USE<br />
FIREARMS ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS SUBJECT TO THE<br />
APPROVAL OF THEIR HEAD OF CORPS. AN ARMY<br />
TRAINING INSTRUCTION IS CURRENTLY IN PRINT<br />
AUTHORISING THIS MATTER.<br />
EARLY NEXT YEAR WE EXPECT TO MAKE A DECISION ON<br />
THE MILLAR COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PREFERENTIAL<br />
HOUSING LOANS FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMY RESERVE WHO SERVE SIX<br />
YEARS OR MORE. THE GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO THE MAINTENANCE<br />
OF AN ALL VOLUNTEER ARMY. IT RECOGNISES THAT TO BE EFFECTIVE<br />
SUCH A FORCE MUST HAVE HIGH MORALE, HIGH DEGREE OF MOTIVATION<br />
AND SUITABLE CONDITIONS OF SERVICE. IT IS THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
INTENTION TO ACHIEVE THIS BY ALL THE MEANS AT ITS DISPOSAL.<br />
IBELIEVE THAT A GREAT MAJORITY OF EMPLOYERS ARE<br />
PATRIOTIC AND PUBLIC-SPIRITED. I APPEAL TO THEM TO ADOPT<br />
AND PROMULGATE POLICIES WHICH WILL BE HELPFUL TO THE ARMY<br />
RESERVE AND THE NATION. IN PARTICULAR AN EMPLOYEE WILL<br />
REQUIRE HIS EMPLOYER'IS PERMISSION TO ATTEND THE ANNUAL CAMP<br />
WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE YEARLY TRAINING CYCLE.<br />
HOPEFULLY, EMPLOYERS WILL WISH TO FOLLOW THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
POLICY WHICH IS, TO GRANT EMPLOYEES LEAVE WITH PAY TO ATTEND<br />
ANNUAL CAMPS. WE WANT TO SEE A RESERVE BACKED BY THE COMMUNITY<br />
OF WHICH IT IS PART AND WHICH IT IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT AND<br />
PROTECT. </p>
