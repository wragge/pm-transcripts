PRIME MINISTIER<br />
AUSTRALIAN RURAL ADJU. STMI-' NT UNIT SP'ECH<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CANBERRA, 30 OCTOBER 1984<br />
Ladies and. Gentlemen,<br />
I welcome this opportunity to Address you at this the<br />
beginning of a new period in the hist. ory of what until<br />
today has been called the Australian Rural Adjustment<br />
Unit. The Unit has played a very important role in promoting<br />
understanding of the implications of rural issues. It<br />
has brought together the concerns and expertise of many<br />
in rural areas, in universities and research<br />
organisations an3 others involved in formulating and<br />
advising on policy, to devise solutions to the complex<br />
problems of rural Australia. The Unit's contribution is<br />
a valued input to the task of developing sound rural<br />
policies. The agenda the Unit has set itself is diverse. During<br />
the past year it has addressed issues such as:<br />
Developing a plan for the training of professionals<br />
in soil conservation;<br />
A consultation program to develop agricultural<br />
education criteria;<br />
Investigations into a strategy. for the dairy<br />
industry; and<br />
An investigation into the role, financing and<br />
performance o rural local Government.<br />
The focus of the Unit's interest has therefore shifted<br />
from a concentration on adjustment problems to a broader<br />
concern for the rural sector generally and for the<br />
quality of life in rural Australia. I think it is quite<br />
fitting, therefore, that the Unit should now be renamed<br />
the Rural Development Centre.<br />
Obviously this shift in emphasis is in no way intended<br />
to diminish the importance of rural adjustment and<br />
productivity continued attention is needed to such<br />
matters. On top of this, however, there is a need for a<br />
balanced, integrated approach to the development of<br />
rural policy. It is in this sense that I welcome the </p>
<p>Centre's exaini, i i L on O ir n'-ti L: rs, ich -is col ndit ions<br />

Australia. Broad based consideratLions of this kind are<br />
re. uired if rural policy is to be ad'eqately sensitive<br />
to the interests of Australians in rural areas.<br />
It is a particularly welcome developne. it that the Centre<br />
now is launching a new publication called Inside<br />
Australia. It should be a useful vehicle through which<br />
to better inform Australians on the problems and<br />
conditions facing rural Australia.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
There can be no doubt that those in cural areas have<br />
made a major contribution to the well being of all<br />
Australians. Our rural export industcries have [ or<br />
several generations been a mainstay of Australia's<br />
enviably high standard of living.<br />
As a Government, we have sought to provide the<br />
conditions that would see our efficient and productive<br />
rural industries prosper.<br />
In this regard the direct and regular consultations we<br />
have had with the National Farmers Federation have been<br />
especially valuable. Their advice and their<br />
constructive participation in the National Economic<br />
Summit and in EPAC have contributed greatly to this<br />
Government's appreciation of the concerns of Australians<br />
in rural areas.<br />
The Government's approach to rural policy has operated<br />
on three broad levels, each of which supports the other.<br />
The first is in the provision of sound economic<br />
management. Here the record speaks for itself. This<br />
has wrought substantial benefits for the rural<br />
community.<br />
We have curbed inflation and, through the Accord,<br />
reduced wage pressures. This has assisted rural<br />
producers considerably in holding down cost pressures<br />
and should continue to assist them in the future.<br />
Our record of reducing interest rates will also have<br />
greatly helped those using capital intensive methods of<br />
production. </p>
<p>We have as vill been nost a-ctive as a Government in<br />
seeking to bcoad:. n Austcalia's access to foreign<br />
ma ckets. The jai ns s( ecLre d, for example, in the<br />
recently concluTe. 3 AustCalia-Japan beef agreement<br />
while noti all that we : 3ho). 1ld, hav: e * wanted will provid<br />
a solid basa for the further development of our cattle<br />
inids t ry.<br />
Th3e deregjulation of Austcalian Cinanci l markets and tlhe<br />
floating of the Australian dollar have also benefitted<br />
greatly Australia's rurcal producers. Most impoc tantly<br />
these landmark decisions have substantially boosted the<br />
competitiveness of our rural exports.<br />
The second level at which the Government has operated<br />
has been through the initiation of policies aimed at<br />
laying the foundations for the future prosperity of our<br />
rural industries. Confident of the long run<br />
contribution which our rural industries can make to<br />
Australia we have given particular priority to programs<br />
that address the longer-term needs of the sector.<br />
It is in this context that we have increased funds for<br />
rural research and wool promotion; that we have<br />
introduced'a soil conservation program; and that we<br />
have introduced fisheries management plans.<br />
There are nevertheless limits to what the Government can<br />
do. The real decisions affecting the day to day<br />
prosperity of the industry must be taken by the industry<br />
itself.<br />
This brings me to the third strand of our policy. We<br />
need to be sure that those taking decisions affecting<br />
rural industries themselves bring adequate expertise and<br />
experience to the task. We have taken steps to ensure<br />
that the management structures of the industries'<br />
marketing organisations are so designed that those<br />
organisations are most likely to secure the best results<br />
possible for the producer interests they serve.<br />
In making its decisions on policies affecting rural<br />
industries the Goverhment has been very conscious of the<br />
unique circumstances facing primary producers:<br />
-Despite popular opinion I can't make it rain or<br />
prevent floods.<br />
The Government has nevertheless taken steps to reduce<br />
the impact of these natural phenomena, and to cushion<br />
the effects of swings in market prices on Ehe rural<br />
sector. </p>
<p>We have retained , and na. o ;' nore flexible the R: ural<br />
Adjustment Scheme to facilitate the process of<br />
structural rahnigdj ' e to help overcome short Lterm<br />
difficulties. Only last week we announced additilonal assistance of<br />
under Part A of that scheme to help sugar cane<br />
growers in Queensland and iew South Wales.<br />
The Government has also supported marketing schemes<br />
which have featured mechanisms to b'ouf f. r the . ee: Ect of<br />
short teem fluctuations in prices.<br />
In taking Lthese decisions, the Government has recognised<br />
the close relationship between fluctualions in the<br />
prosperity of rural industries and the prosperity of the<br />
large numbers of people servicing those industries.<br />
-The work of the Australian Rural Adjustment Unit has<br />
focused attention on the close linkages that exist in<br />
this part of the economy.<br />
We have also been conscious of the often very special<br />
circumstances of those in the rural sector. These<br />
circumstances include isolation from the major<br />
population centres and the services located in these<br />
centres and the established pattern of families working<br />
the same property, sometimes for generations.<br />
Such circumstances have influenced our approach and<br />
decisions on a range of issues:<br />
SThe Pensions Assets Test includes special provisions<br />
in recognition of the special circumstances<br />
surrounding some farmers.<br />
Our final decision on Land Rights Legislation will<br />
reflect consultations with a spectrum of community<br />
groups, including those from the rural sector.<br />
Rural communities will also have better access to<br />
telecommunications through AUSSAT and better<br />
transport. facilities as a result of the Bicentennial<br />
Roads Program.<br />
Our concern for the rural community as part of the wider<br />
Australian community is evidenced by these and other<br />
decisions. The stance we have taken does, I believe,<br />
represent a fair compromise between the competing claims<br />
of different sectors of society. </p>
<p>I think it is a mark of our success is t GovtcrninentL tlat<br />
the balance we have srnck is genuinely ap1rciat,? d by<br />
Australia' 3; riiCral co-mmunitty. The imoCoverl e: noa thy and<br />
understanding which now tcists between the Labor<br />
Governinent andt thos in cural x: reais so-mething we as<br />
a Govertnment welcome. In large measure it is due to the<br />
untirinj efforts of our Minister for Primary Industry,<br />
John Kerin, and to the co-operative spirit with which<br />
rural producecs have been pre! pare:] to idc'ess the?<br />
Government. I see maintenance of this spirit as an<br />

focusing on issues relating to t'he ecohornic and social<br />
environmentL of rural area's, will bre a valued<br />
contribution to the ability of-Government to continue to<br />
reach informed andl fair decisions -aiffectiny rural<br />
Australia. Certainly a Labor Government will never<br />
underesti-mate the importace of such decisions.<br />
It will be among our greatest challenges and most<br />
important responsibilities as a Government to get those<br />
decisions right. I am sure we shall continue to do so. </p>
