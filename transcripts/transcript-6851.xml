FOR MEDIA<br />
The Queen has given formal approval to various amendments to the<br />
Constitution of the order of Australia. The amendments relate to<br />
the removal of the provision to appoint Knights and Dames,<br />
provide for representation of the Northern Territory and an<br />
additional four non-government members on the Council for the<br />
order of Australia as veil as an increase in the number of order<br />
of Australia awards available each year from about 400 to 700.<br />
( The removal of the provision concerning Knights and Dames does<br />
not affect existing appointees at this level.)<br />
The Queen's in principle agreement to these amendments was<br />
announced on Australia Day with several other important<br />
Government initiatives to enhance and develop the Australian<br />
honours system. The Queen's formal approval to the remaining<br />
matters will be announced progressively following the submission<br />
of the appropriate documentation to Her Majesty.<br />
The changes to the Order's Constitution follow an extensive<br />
review of the Australian honours system and the increase in<br />
non-government Council members from three to seven will increase<br />
community participation in recommending recipients of honours,<br />
while the additional allocation of awards will allow for wider<br />
recognition of those who have given outstanding service to<br />
Australia through their skills, dedication and community<br />
activities. 4 MARCH 1986 </p>
