PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH NOTES FOR LAUNCHING OF BRUCE<br />
STANNARD'S BEN LEXCEN: THE MAN, THE KEEL AND THE CUP<br />
CRUISING YACHT CLUB, SYDNEY, 26 SEPTMEBER 1984<br />
The launching of this book gives me enormous pleasure from<br />
three points of view. First, it enables me to salute the<br />
achievements of Ben Lexcen, an original Australian genius.<br />
Second, it gives me a chance to pay tribute to<br />
Bruce Stannard, whose magnificent radio commentaries and<br />
reports and whose unwavering confidence in Australia II,<br />
notwithstanding her early travails, made such an important<br />
contribution to the nation's experience of the America's<br />
Cup Challenge. Third, we have an opportunity to relive the<br />
enormous sense of national achievement which we all felt 12<br />
months ago today. In the laconic words of Bruce Stannard's<br />
book: " Race Seven<br />
24 September ( abandoned)<br />
Rerun 26 September<br />
Australia II defeated Liberty by 41<br />
seconds"<br />
Behind those laconic words, however, there was a great<br />
awakening of Australian patriotism unparalleled since the<br />
War. Whatever our differences all Australians could be<br />
extraordinarily proud of that achievement. On that 26<br />
September last year, this country was united. All<br />
Australians were-indeed brought together.<br />
But the Australia II triumph also represented something far<br />
wider. It was a symbol that this country was on the road<br />
back. Australia was on the move. Australia was winning<br />
again. The Australia II victory showed that Australian drive,<br />
Australian determination, Australian ingenuity could take<br />
on the world's best and triumph. And it was the triumph of<br />
Australia II that epitomised the new national spirit of<br />
confidence, commitment and achievement. </p>
<p>That wider significance of the Australia 11 experience<br />
makes this book even more worthy of consideration. Because<br />
it is Ben Lexcen's struggle and eventual triumph that<br />
encapsulates what the Australia II achievement was all<br />
about. And indeed because without Ben Lexcen there would<br />
have been no Australia II victory.<br />
Ben Lexcen emerges from Bruce Stannard's pages as original<br />
and remarkable a man as his yacht designs have been radical<br />
and innovative. I had expected that. he must have been born<br />
on Sydney Harbouir or at least somewhere by the sea. In<br />
fact, he is a boy from the bush, born in Boggabri in northwestern<br />
New South Wales.<br />
For those who see sailing as a silver-tail sport, it will<br />
come as a surprise to learn that Ben was born to hardship.<br />
He had a very tough childhood and, in fact, spent some time<br />
in a boys home. Life there was pretty hard but it had one<br />
enormously important benefit, both for Ben and for<br />
Australia: some unknown benefactor had donated to the home<br />
hundreds of old yachting magazines, from which he developed<br />
a fascination for boats and sail.<br />
Ben, like my Treasurer, Paul Keating another genius<br />
destined to come into his own in 1983 left school at 14.<br />
He worked as a metal worker at the Railway Depot at Cardiff<br />
near Newcastle and there taught himself to sail, design and<br />
build sailing boats and, as Bruce says, developed skills<br />
which a naval architect with a university degree would<br />
never dream of employing. Ben's sailing career is very much<br />
the story of sailing over the last 30 years in Australia.<br />
He began his sailing in those classic Australian craft, the<br />
VJ and VS. Later he made revolutionary design changes to<br />
those supreme and unique Australian racing machines, the<br />
18-footers. At the same time, he showed his expertise in<br />
international classes, such as the Soling and the Flying<br />
Dutchman, in which he won the title of Australian Yachtsman<br />
of the Year in 1967.<br />
From dinghies Ben graduated to, and showed his mastery in,<br />
ocean-going craft, designing such outstanding boats as<br />
Mercedes III and Apollo. Many of Ben's designs achieved<br />
superb results in international ocean racing.<br />
With this basis, he graduated to the supreme yacht racing<br />
test. His work on Apollo marked the beginning of his<br />
relationship with Alan Bond and his involvement in the<br />
America's Cup campaigns, unsuccessful ( occasionally<br />
bitterly so) in 1974, 1977 and 1980 and finally brilliantly<br />
triumphant in 1983. This is not a time, of course, to dwell<br />
on the losing challenges but they were very important in<br />
preparing the ground for the 1983 success. What emerges<br />
from Bruce Stannard's account of the early campaigns is the<br />
way in which the Bond team, and Ben particularly, learned </p>
<p>from their own experiences and from the innovations of<br />
other challengers, not only those from the United States.<br />
The other striking lesson is the way in which the team had<br />
the guts to-* bounce back after some frankly pretty<br />
disastrous results. We should remember that in 1974 and<br />
' 1977 the Australians went down 4 nil. One can only be<br />
impressed by Ben's honesty in blaming himself for the loss<br />
of the last race in 1980, when he believes he gave Jim<br />
Hardy bad tactical advice, and his realistic optimism after<br />
winning the one race in 1980 that Australia had the ability<br />
to win the America's Cup.<br />
Bruce Stannard's book properly gives importance to the<br />
famous Lexcen winged keel. Without this in~ spired<br />
invention, Australia II's results may well have been very<br />
different. Indeed, Ben Lexcen is fairly critical of her<br />
basic hull design and in view of his realism, honesty and<br />
determination to do better this suggests that the<br />
challengers in 1987 will have a real job on~ their hands.<br />
With the keel, Australia II, not only, in Ben's poetic<br />
words, " looked like a giant Plesiosaur with wonderfully<br />
rounded flippers," but, under the superb seamanship of John<br />
Bertrand and the crew, put up a performance! which took her<br />
into sailing history and caught the imagination of<br />
Australia and the world.<br />
The romance and mystery of the keel are an integral part of<br />
the story of Australia II. And every romance and mystery<br />
requires a villain. At this point, enter the New York<br />
Yacht Club. It has been suggested occasionally that I am<br />
somewhat prone to resort to litigation but with due modesty<br />
I doubt if I could compete with the ingenuity and total<br />
commitment which the NYCC showed in its attempts to keep<br />
Ben's magic keel out of the water. Basic t~ o their case, of<br />
course, was the suggestion that he had received improper<br />
foreign assistance in its design. Again, Ben's colourful<br />
words say it all; " They are accusing me of' cheating......<br />
I have a mind to admit it all and tell them that I really<br />
owe the secret of the design to a Greek guy who helped me<br />
out. He's been d-ead for 2000 years but invaluable. Bloody<br />
Archimedes." Bruce Stannard's technically informed and vividly written<br />
account of the seven races has all the excitement and<br />
professional competence which he brought to his radio and<br />
press commentaries at the time and crown what is, I<br />
believe, an outstanding book on Australian yachting and, as<br />
I have indicated, a great Australian character.<br />
In the story of Ben Lexcen I see one very important lesson<br />
for contemporary Australia: It demonstrates the importance<br />
of applying our native ingenuity and innovative capacity,<br />
while staying abreast of international technological </p>
<p>developments. Even as a child, he kept himself informed<br />
of, and learned from, what was being one by such great<br />
international designers as Nat Herreschoff, Uffa Fox and<br />
Manfred Curry. As a man, he was in no way ashamed of, or<br />
in any sense, hypocritical about, his use of the tank<br />
testing computer facilities in the Netherlands.<br />
Ben Lexcen's achievement lies in absorbing that<br />
international technology and going beyond it. Just as he<br />
helped to revolutionise the Australian 18 footer class in<br />
the 1962' s, so has he revolutionised the international<br />
12 metre class in the 1980' s. And his achievement has<br />
brought success to Australia at the summit of international<br />
competition. Ben's is an example which Australians in all fields of<br />
endeavour can look to, as our country faces the challenges<br />
of the late 20th Century. Australia II represents the<br />
latest state of the art in 12 metre yachting. That<br />
obviously involves a great deal of absorbed international<br />
technology and know-how but no-one can deny that<br />
Australia II is a magnificent Australian technological<br />
achievement any more than we can deny that Ben Lexcen is a<br />
unique Australian genius and original character. All<br />
credit to Bruce Stannard for telling the story of both of<br />
them. </p>
