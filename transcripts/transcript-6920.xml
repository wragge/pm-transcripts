TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW AT GOLDEN BULL GUEST HOUSE CHENGDU<br />
21 MAY 1986<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher seems to be saying<br />
that she doesn't believe that South Africa's military raid<br />
challenges or questions the effectiveness of sanctions.<br />
What is your view on the raid and should we be imposing<br />
sanctions? PM: Well the view of the Australian Government about the<br />
raids is it is a totally objectionable and reprehensible<br />
and an unacceptable intrusion into the affairs of sovereign<br />
and independent countries. I have had transmitted to the<br />
South African Government that view of the Australian Government.<br />
As to the effect that this may have on the processes that<br />
have been initiated by the Commonwealth I can't say with<br />
authority on that. It must impose a considerable strain<br />
upon them and I have yet to hear from Mr Fraser and the<br />
other people associated with the eminent persons group.<br />
JOURNALIST: So the question of sanctions would depend very<br />
much on their assessment, their report?<br />
PM: Well, that would be a relevant factor. What have I<br />
have asked to be done, I have sent a cable back to Australia<br />
and asked that there be prepared for Cabinet consideration<br />
a submission by the Department of Foreign Affairs in consultation<br />
with my own Department so that Cabinet can consider this<br />
matter on my return. </p>
