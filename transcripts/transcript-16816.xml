    <content><![CDATA[<p>ALBANESE: Today we've launched The Good Gear Guide for motorcycle and scooter riders.</p>
<p>Today we've had Malcolm Farr from the Daily Telegraph here assisting us. He's here in his capacity as a bike rider, and he might want to say something about this guide.</p>
<p>FARR: Minister, it's a most worthy project, given, as you would know possibly more than most, the sad statistics of the number of people who, when they fall off bikes, end up in hospital for a long, long time - or worse - and there are some basic protections that bike riders can take in the clothing they wear, and I think it's admirable that the Government, on a very bipartisan fashion, I might say, is supporting the promotion of the wearing of safety clothes.</p>
<p>ALBANESE: Thanks, Mal. Happy riding.</p>
<p>FARR: Thank you.</p>
