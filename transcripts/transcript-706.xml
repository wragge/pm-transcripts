FOR PRESS BIDATTLT TV. 1 111<br />
Statement by the Prime a R2tr. hYt. Hofln i Robert Menzies<br />
I hav3-today dis( C aIjed with~ Eenior collea gues<br />
and with Mr. Davidson the qluesl*-. zr:) of' tie showing c' the<br />
Bidault television intevview3<br />
It transpire--t, y r) rastrictiosexs uo<br />
newspaper publicatic.-a whic! 2 " t_ s : yond the 3ontrol of thie<br />
Commonwealth or upon the ohovirj1:: of" -tiie fiir in picture<br />
theatres. Under-these crci; roa we liave all agreed<br />
that the continuance of' thL. t. elevision ban wo-uld amount to<br />
discriminat-ion against th e t-1, n sJt atI-. o ns It has<br />
therefore been agreed,. that the P-c:-;-itastr-G eal il<br />
withdraw the diz-ecticns to theP l: ciision s ations. T he<br />
Postmaster-Genera.]. had anipile sttioypower to give his<br />
directions, and in fact he gav:-e thE'rni after consultations<br />
with some senior coliag,_ Q4o and ns. TrcJlf We all f elt that<br />
the television interview was, f:' cin the.-beginning, a great<br />
mistake. It undoubtoly* gave :' riso to strong ffeelings in<br />
France. France is a f~ ieiidly natl;. on' and is in fact our own<br />
ally in SEATO. HOWVl) aLng . cat e3. our own crit ical<br />
view a vi ew t o which we n6. he r it would be useless<br />
to pursue a prohib: Lt-. on which ex-cr omely l3initLed in its<br />
operation. It has t5herefore, as I hav,, e stated, been decided<br />
t'Uo cancel the e~ sigo d. s. Perhaps the whole incident<br />
will serve to mnake it piain outii e Asti-al~ ia t-hat the ABC<br />
is not an organ of the Au-itralian2 G enet, and that our<br />
power to direct -it is oae that wrould not wish to exercise<br />
except under e:: eeptiona'L. cJ; 7inmrat: er~ ces. To exercise it in<br />
relation to television alcne o. 2. i as the ev1. ents in th! e<br />
present case hiave showvn, sorame m turn out to be ineffective.<br />
