PRESS STATEMENT NO. 497<br />
18 April 1975<br />
TRIBUTE. TO. RAAF<br />
The Prime Minister today paid tribute to the humanitarian<br />
contribution made by the C-130 aircraft of the Royal Australian<br />
Air Force which have been operating in South-East Asia since<br />
March. He did this on the occasion of the return to<br />
Australia of three aircraft which require servicing.<br />
T2he Prime Minister recalled that the aircraft had<br />
originally been sent to South-East Asia to fulfil an urgent<br />
task in the uplifting of refugees at Da Nang. Australia had<br />
been the first country to respond to tL. his request for humanitarian<br />
assistance by providing an airlift capacity : subsequently the<br />
Royal New Zealand Air Force had also provided aircraft.<br />
Since their arrival the C-130 aircraft have been<br />
engaged in relief tasks, most of them connected with the<br />
movement of United Nations supplies. They have also played<br />
a role in the uplift of South Vietnamese orphans for adoption<br />
in Australia. The Prime Minister said that he regretted that there<br />
had been some misleading reports that the aircraft had been<br />
under-employed. In fact, their crews and all those associated<br />
with the carrying of relief supplies had been workina under<br />
very great pressure, in arduous conditions. For example,<br />
about half a million pounds of medical and relief supplies<br />
had been transported from Bangkok to Saigon and much of these<br />
had had to be loaded by hand by RAAF crews.<br />
The Prime Minister recalled that he had already referred<br />
in Parliament to tributes paid to the P. AAF performances.<br />
He said that he had asked the Chief of the Air Staff to<br />
convey his personal appreciation to all those who had been<br />
involved. 2 </p>
<p>The Prime Minister said that there had been<br />
discussions. this week with the Secretary-General of the<br />
United Nations, Mr. Waldheirm, and the coordinator of<br />
relief assistance for Indo China, Sir Robert Jackson,<br />
about the future role which RAAF planes might play in<br />
assisting United Nations agencies in their humanitarian<br />
tasks in indo China. As a result R F Hercules . ere to<br />
be assigned to the United Nations to play a bridging role<br />
in the transport of relief supplies until United Nations<br />
agencies were able to make satisfactory arrangements for<br />
the chartering of aircraft to meet their needs.<br />
The Prime Minister said he was particularly pleased<br />
that Australian Government aircraft would be able to play<br />
this essential humanitarian role in the service of the<br />
United Nations in transporting relief supplies contributed<br />
by the Australian and many other Governments.<br />
