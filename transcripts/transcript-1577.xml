COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH 2 6 MAY 197<br />
4BY8RARI<br />
The Rt Hon. HAROLD HOLT,,<br />
ON<br />
' VOYAGER' INQUIRY<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 17 May 1967]<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT ( Higgins-Prime<br />
Minister) [ 8.47]-The House has had a very<br />
thorough discussion on this particular<br />
matter. Three of my ministerial colleagues<br />
have jaken part in the debate, as has a<br />
former Minister for the Navy from the<br />
Government side. It is not my purpose at<br />
this stage to go over the ground again<br />
or to try to canvass all the points that have<br />
already been raised. We have reached a<br />
stage where the Parliament must recognise<br />
as I am sure most, if not all, honourable<br />
members from the outset have recognised,<br />
that we have an obligation to do justice.-<br />
justice to the living and justice to the dead.<br />
We also have an obligation to do justice<br />
to the Royal Australian Navy. I believe<br />
that we have a fine Navy with a splendid<br />
record-a Navy that has inherited the<br />
British tradition of naval efficiency and<br />
gallantry. Certainly our own'Navy, though<br />
small in size, ' has maintained a standard<br />
which is not surpassed by that of any other<br />
' Navy in any part of the world. It is a Navy<br />
operating in the best tradition established<br />
by what we believe to be the best of all<br />
navies, the British Navy. Yet, as a result<br />
of' allegations that have been made and<br />
canvassed in the course of this debate,<br />
justice is in danger of being obscured and,<br />
in the case of some people, denied unless<br />
this Parliament can resolve these matters<br />
as they should most properly be resolved.<br />
I devote the first portion of what I have<br />
to say to what I term a ground clearing<br />
operation. Although the allegations that<br />
6980/ 67 have been canvassed here have been<br />
directed in particular against the commander<br />
of the ' Voyager' on the night of<br />
this tragic collision, by implication they<br />
have reached out to other people; indeed,<br />
they have reached out to my predecessor,<br />
Sir Robert Menzies, who was then Prime<br />
Minister. There was created an atmosphere<br />
that the Government, in order to avoid<br />
some political embarrassment for itself,<br />
concealed evidence which should properly<br />
have been placed before the Royal Commission.<br />
Some cloud has been cast over<br />
even the Royal Commissioner himself, and<br />
certainly there have been references to<br />
, counsel assisting the Royal Commission,<br />
the, Chiefs of the Naval Staff, the Naval<br />
Board, and other senior naval officers. All<br />
these things I believe have created a<br />
situation which must be cleared. Let me<br />
. say a few words in relation to my distinguished<br />
predecessor.<br />
Mr Clyde Cameron-Do not blame him<br />
for it.<br />
i Mr HAROLD HOLT-I am not attempting<br />
to blame him, and I hope that no one<br />
else will blame him. What I want to make<br />
clear in relation to Sir Robert Menzies is<br />
that from the outset of this unhappy<br />
business he was determined that there would<br />
be the most searching inquiry into its<br />
causes. This was the reason that motivated<br />
him in deciding to have a Royal Commission<br />
rather than an inquiry by the Naval<br />
Board, which would have been in accordance<br />
with normal naval practice. To<br />
remind the House of what Sir Robert </p>
<p>Menzies said in his ministerial statement<br />
concerning the loss of ; HMAS ' Voyager',<br />
I-quote his ' words from page 1074 of<br />
Hansard of 15th September 1964 as<br />
follows: I do not'seek to minimise the tragic nature<br />
of the ' Voyager' collision, with its appalling<br />
consequences in lives lost. That is why we<br />
instituted the most searching public inquiry in the<br />
whole of our defence history.<br />
As one who was close to my predecessor<br />
at that time, being the Deputy Leader of<br />
his own Party and a senior member of the<br />
Cabinet, I can well recall the atmosphere<br />
and the spirit in which he addressed himself<br />
to these matters. So far as he was<br />
concerned, he wanted an inquiry that<br />
would produce the truth, not just for the<br />
Government to see but for the information<br />
of the people of this country. That is the<br />
spirit in which I and my colleagues have<br />
dealt with every aspect of this matter that<br />
has since come before us.<br />
There have been suggestions or allegations<br />
that Sir Robert Menzies bore some<br />
prejudice against Captain Robertson, but<br />
I never heard him utter words of prejudice,<br />
or for that matter words of criticism,<br />
against Captain Robertson. At the bottom<br />
of page 1075 of Hansard of 15th September<br />
1964 Sir Robert Menzies is reported<br />
to have said:<br />
Of the general capacity, not only of Captain<br />
Robertson but of Captain Stevens, there cannot<br />
be any real doubt. Each had a splendid record<br />
and very considerable naval experience.<br />
That is not the language of a man who<br />
bears prejudice or is trying in some way to<br />
do a disservice or to belittle one of our<br />
respected Service officers. Something was<br />
made of the fact that Captain Robertson<br />
had difficulty in securing senior counsel. The<br />
facts as I understand them are that at the<br />
beginning of the inquiry Captain Robertson<br />
did not want counsel; he felt that his own<br />
specialist naval knowledge would be of<br />
strength to him in whatever might be<br />
alleged during the inquiry. But as the proceedings<br />
developed and his own position<br />
came under challenge, it was suggested to<br />
him that he should have counsel. He applied<br />
for counsel. At the time it is true that he<br />
was first allotted junior counsel, but what<br />
has to be borne in mind is that he was not<br />
the only officer whose position was under<br />
some analysis and examination by the<br />
Royal Commission; there were several such<br />
officers, and if senior counsel were to be provided for each of them there would<br />
have been something of a practical problem.<br />
This matter was raised by the honourable<br />
member for La Trobe ( Mr Jess). Very<br />
properly he formed a view, no doubt after<br />
consultation or as a result of what came to<br />
him from Captain Robertson. As he will<br />
know, he finally brought this matter to me.<br />
I in turn took it to my leader, Sir Robert<br />
Menzies. I can assure the honourable member<br />
and the House that as soon as I made<br />
my own recommendation on this matter and<br />
explained the reasons for it, Sir Robert<br />
Menzies readily consented. It is a distortion<br />
of the situation to say, as has been said<br />
earlier in this debate, that this was the<br />
result of some pressure because there was<br />
a Party meeting coming up. It was dealt<br />
with on its merits and as it should have<br />
been dealt with. Thereafter Captain<br />
Robertson had the assistance of senior<br />
counsel. I make a brief reference to Mr Justice<br />
Spicer because it has been said that as a<br />
former Attorney-General and a Minister in<br />
a Menzies Government he was not an appropriate<br />
person to have been appointed to this<br />
Royal Commission. I do not think any<br />
member-from whatever party-who was<br />
in this Parliament at the time when Sir<br />
John Spicer was a senator and the Attorney-<br />
General will have any other view than that<br />
he is a man of integrity, whose objectivity<br />
and capacity for complete impartiality fitted<br />
him to deal with a matter of this sort. 1<br />
have never heard that seriously contested<br />
by any contemporary of his from any section<br />
of the Parliament. The fact of the<br />
matter is that over the years Sir John<br />
Spicer has built up something of a name<br />
as an expert in these disaster cases. I took<br />
the trouble only today to get some details<br />
of a number of these matters in which he<br />
has conducted inquiries. I find that he has<br />
conducted at least seven investigationsthe<br />
Trans-Australia Airlines Friendship<br />
disaster at Mackay; the Ansett-ANA Viscount<br />
disaster at Botany Bay; the Ansett-<br />
ANA Viscount crash at Winton; three<br />
marine courts of inquiry, including the<br />
' Atlas' inquiry and two in Western Australia<br />
so he was not unfamiliar with these<br />
naval matters, and the ' Voyager' Royal<br />
Commission. Therefore, I do not think the<br />
House will allow any argument to rest on<br />
the basis that these proceedings suffered<br />
on the grounds of lack of competence or </p>
<p>impartiality on the part of the Royal<br />
Commissioner. Counsel assisting the Royal Commissioner<br />
has come in for his share of criticism, it<br />
being alleged that he deliberately withheld<br />
evidence which had a material bearing on<br />
the matters before the Commission. The<br />
implication is that he did this to cover up<br />
in some way for the Navy or to withhold<br />
inlormafion which could have been of<br />
embarrassment to the Navy. The irony of<br />
this is that shortly before this he came under<br />
a great deal of criticism because it was<br />
alleged that his cross-examination and his<br />
analysis of Navy actions were much too<br />
severe. I do not think the House will place<br />
very much reliance upon that charge either.<br />
Some of my colleagues-including the<br />
presentMinister for Education and Science<br />
( Senator Gorton) who had been Minister for<br />
the Navy until a couple of months before<br />
this incident and my colleague the honourable<br />
member for Perth ( Mr Chaney) who<br />
was at the time of the incident Minister for<br />
the Navy-have by implication come under<br />
a cloud. If one draws from these allegations<br />
the belief that in some way the Navy was<br />
not in good shape and was not being<br />
properly conducted, the inference is that<br />
the Ministers I have mentioned, Chiefs of<br />
Naval Staff, the Naval Board and senior<br />
officers of the Navy, were not doing their<br />
duty properly by the nation. This charge<br />
all hangs on a single fabric, so far as the<br />
Parliament is concerned, and the fabric is<br />
the uncorroborated Statement of Lieutenant-<br />
Commander Cabban. There has not been<br />
any other evidence or material of consequence<br />
put before the Parliament in the<br />
days of this debate which goes beyond the<br />
statement that has been under debate and<br />
which comes from Lieutenant-Commander<br />
Cabban. I ask the House to weigh this<br />
because if the reputations of so many men<br />
in high places and if the prestige of the<br />
Australian Navy are at stake in this debate<br />
then the grounds for these charges and<br />
these suspicions must be thoroughly<br />
examined. Of course, those who have spoken in<br />
the debate have said: ' This is our purpose.<br />
This is what we want to achieve. We want<br />
to see whether these statements do hang<br />
together and whether they are worthy of<br />
credence.' I have no wish to make any sort of personal attack upon Lieutenant-Commander<br />
Cabban. I believe him to be a<br />
conscientious man with a sense of public<br />
duty which' he has demonstrated with some<br />
courage by the way in which he has brought<br />
these matters forward. But as my colleague<br />
the Treasurer ( Mr McMahon) pointed out<br />
earlier today, if we are to rely on this<br />
statement and build this structure upon<br />
that singlestatement then we cannot ignore<br />
some of the elements in the past record or<br />
in the personal history of the man who<br />
makes the statement.<br />
: Mr Clyde Cameron-So now the Prime<br />
Minister will drop the bucket.<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-The honourable<br />
gentleman is accustomed to that technique.<br />
I am putting as dispassionately as I can<br />
facts I believe to be relevant. If he thinks<br />
that they are not, he can say so or form<br />
his judgment upon them, but I. think it is<br />
of relevance when-statements are madeso<br />
far not corroborated, although great publicity<br />
has been given to the matter throughout<br />
Australia, and, I should imagine<br />
throughout the English speaking world. So<br />
far as I am aware no member on the opposite<br />
side of the House has brought forward<br />
any-substantial corroboration of the series<br />
of allegations that has been made. Here is<br />
a man who, having as a member of the<br />
Naval Air Arm, failed to make the grade<br />
and, being removed from that posting,<br />
sought twice to resign from the Navy;<br />
and who in the course of the first application<br />
said that he was disillusioned with<br />
the Navy. I think these are relevant facts.<br />
I do not wish to over-emphasise them but<br />
they are relevant when, I repeat, the basis<br />
of the allegations is the statement coming<br />
from this man.<br />
These statements bear on the career and<br />
reputation of a' man who had given long<br />
and able service in the navy of this country.<br />
He is a man who can no longer speak for<br />
himself, because he went down with his<br />
ship, and we, have a duty to do justice<br />
to him as we have a duty to do justice<br />
to the living. I mentioned a little earlier<br />
Captain Robertson. I think it is relevant<br />
again to remind the House of what Captain<br />
Robertson had to say about Captain Stevens<br />
in the transcript, as recorded, of the Royal<br />
Commission on the loss of the ' Voyager'. </p>
<p>Captain Robertson was being questioned by<br />
Mr Jenkyn, as follows:<br />
Did -you know Captain Stevens personally?-<br />
Yes. Do you know his record as an officer?-Yes.<br />
Do you know him as a competent commander<br />
of a destroyer?-Yes.<br />
And so this vessel which was manoeuvring with<br />
you you kniew was at least skippered or commanded<br />
by a competent captain?-Yes, but let<br />
me just qualify that. I knew his reputation as<br />
a very successful naval officer. From my own<br />
personal knowledge I had not served in a ship<br />
with him and so I cannot honestly say that I<br />
knew him as a good commander but I knew<br />
his reputation was certainly that, and I have no<br />
reason to doubt it at all.<br />
Ours is a small Navy and Captain<br />
Robertson was, as I understand it, about<br />
the age then of what would be the age<br />
today of Captain Stevens had Captain<br />
Stevens survived. In other words, they were<br />
contemporaries in the same fleet-in a<br />
small navy. I doubt if he would, on oath,<br />
have been expressing himself in these terms<br />
if he had reason to believe that there were<br />
attributes of Captain Stevens which made<br />
him an incompetent officer or which, on<br />
the occasion in question, would have<br />
raised doubts in ' his mind as to the course<br />
the other vessel was taking.<br />
I want to put to the House-and I do it<br />
with some reluctance but with a full<br />
sense of responsibility-confidential reports<br />
which were made over the ten years<br />
leading up to the incident which brought<br />
about the death of Captain Stevens. My<br />
predecessor gave powerful reasons why<br />
these confidential reports should not be<br />
made public. He pointed out that the<br />
officers who provide these reports are<br />
normally not below the rank of captain<br />
which, in naval terms, is the equivalent of<br />
a full colonel in the Army-in other words<br />
a senior officer of the Navy. The reports<br />
are made to the superior officer . of the<br />
officer reporting. If the reports are to be<br />
quoted publicly from time to time, then<br />
some inhibitions would be placed on the<br />
reporting officers and the usefulness of the<br />
reports would be eroded. We have thought<br />
long about, whether these reports should be<br />
made public and until the debate of the<br />
last two days it had been our decision,<br />
although we know of them and their substance,<br />
that they would not be made<br />
known. I believe that in justice to the<br />
memory of this dead naval officer and in view of the allegations that have been<br />
made against him, we have . a duty to his<br />
family, to his memory and . to the public<br />
to make known what his fellow officers<br />
thought of him at that time. [ Extension of<br />
time granted] I thank the House and 1<br />
shall endeavour not to abuse its patience,<br />
but the seriousness of this matter is well<br />
appreciated. I asked for reports going back over the<br />
ten year period leading up to the ' Voyager'<br />
incident. The first report is signed by an<br />
acting captain of the Royal Australian<br />
Navy. It speaks of Lieutenant-Commander<br />
Stevens, as he then was, as a very capable,<br />
forthright and reliable officer, really keen,<br />
alert and zealous who has the interest of<br />
the Service at heart and who does not<br />
spare himself to improve conditions. The<br />
report continues:<br />
He will do well. Physically fit and plays most<br />
games. A good messmate who is maturing with<br />
responsibility.<br />
The next report covers the period 1st<br />
December 1953 to 27th October 1954 and<br />
states: An extremely proficient and resourceful officer<br />
with a flair for organisation. Cheerful and very<br />
loyal ' with the interest of the Service at heart.<br />
A good leader and does not spare himself<br />
in the performance of his duties.<br />
Plays most games reasonably well and keeps<br />
himself fit.<br />
The next two reports cover very short<br />
periods and are marked by the officers<br />
concerned: ' Insufficient knowledge' and<br />
' Insufficient knowledge. Time only'.<br />
Mr Clyde Cameron-What dates do they<br />
cover? Mr HAROLD HOLT-They cover the<br />
periods 29th October 1954 to 15th April<br />
1955 and 9th June 1955 to 22nd September<br />
1955.<br />
Mr Clyde Cameron-What about the one<br />
in between, the one you have missed?<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-I have not missed<br />
any, and I ask the honourable member for<br />
Hindmarsh to restrain his normal impulses<br />
and behave himself. This report covers the<br />
period from 23rd September 1955 to 26th<br />
October 1955 and it reads:<br />
A volatile officei, extremely loyal and capable,<br />
who should do very well in the Service. Keeps<br />
himself fit.<br />
The next one covers the period from<br />
October 1955 to 15th April 1956. It is </p>
<p>signed by a captain of the Navy. It is<br />
customary for the next senior officer to<br />
whom one of these reports is forwarded to<br />
sign the document, or the flimsy, as I think<br />
it is called, and to add a remark if he<br />
thinks that necessary or desirable. This<br />
report reads:<br />
An outstanding officer who lives for the Service.<br />
Full of initiative and drive. Quick to make<br />
decisions and an officer who welcomes responsibility.<br />
Possesses a high professional standard. The<br />
ship's present state is due to a great degree to the<br />
qualities of her captain. This officer has served<br />
under me in another appointment and with my<br />
previous and present experience of him I would<br />
be glad to have him in higher rank at any future<br />
time. To this the rear-admiral added ' Concur' and<br />
his signature. The next one is for the period<br />
from 23rd September. 1955 to 7th July<br />
1956: A proficient seaman with plenty of initiative and<br />
drive. He has the ability to make decisions without<br />
any unnecessary delay. At times wears a doleful<br />
expression which is quite misleading. Extremely<br />
hardworking but nevertheless can relax. Most pronounced<br />
quality is that of loyalty. In view of his<br />
non-specialist training and his considerable small<br />
ship experience I am not sure regarding the<br />
measure of success in staff appointments at this<br />
stage of his career.<br />
The rear-admiral who sighted this merely<br />
signed it without comment. The next report<br />
is for the period from 7th July 1956 to<br />
19th December 1956. He was at that time<br />
a training commander and had been promoted<br />
commander. The report reads:<br />
A keen and enthusiastic officer who has the<br />
ability to bring out the best in the young ratings<br />
under training. He sets a high personal example to<br />
the officers under him and has good power of<br />
command. A good organiser and keen games<br />
player. He deserves very great credit for his work<br />
as Chief Marshal at the Olympic Games. A most<br />
likeable personality.<br />
Then I come to a report covering the period<br />
from 14th January 1957 to 1 lth July 1958:<br />
A very good officer with marked qualities of<br />
leadership. He tackles everything with enthusiasm<br />
and has the faculty of inspiring loyalty and keenness<br />
in his juniors. As well as efficiently fulfiling<br />
his duties as Training Commander he has run the<br />
F. N. D. Cricket Club and Australian Rules Football<br />
Club with success and was in charge of the<br />
arrangements for the Inter Service Sports 1957-58<br />
for which the Navy was host Service. These also<br />
were a great success. He is a good mixer, a<br />
splendid messmate and has considerable personal<br />
charm. The next report is from 28th July 1958 to<br />
December 1958. He was then an executive officer.'. The report . reads:<br />
I feel Stevens is finding it a little difficult<br />
being second in command. H' is a forceful<br />
character with only average brain power, and<br />
because of this he is inclined to rush his fences.<br />
At present he makes ' tioo much noise too frequently<br />
to inspire quiet confidence in a carrier.<br />
I have told him of this failing. He is energetic,<br />
of, sober habits and zealous. When he finds his<br />
feet and has a little more experience, I am confident<br />
he will be a complete success in his present<br />
appointment. That was signed by a captain and countersigned<br />
by a rear-admiral. Then I have a<br />
report from 17th December 1958 to 7th<br />
August 1959, when he was still an executive<br />
officer: A smart and enthusiastic officer who gives of<br />
his best at all times. He is inclined to brood<br />
over problems. A very good games player.<br />
To that the rear-admiral added:<br />
Concur. He has been a successful Commander<br />
of the Flagship.<br />
I have another report for the period from<br />
17th December -1958 to 3rd December<br />
1959: A keen and hardworking officer who has<br />
achieved good results. He is a firm and fair<br />
disciplinarian both with officers and men. He has<br />
been more cheerful and brooded less since his<br />
ulcer was successfully treated. Of good physique<br />
and smart in appearance. A keen and good games<br />
player. That report was followed by these remarks<br />
of the rear-admiral:<br />
Concur. He has been an efficient Commander<br />
of the Flagship.<br />
Then there is' a report for the period 14th<br />
Maich 1960 to 12th August 1960. The<br />
significance of this one is that it covers a<br />
period when he was in England as a student<br />
at the Royal , Naval Staff College at Greenwich.<br />
It is signed by a captain of the Royal<br />
Navy and there is an additional signature<br />
of a British rear-admiral. The report reads:<br />
A cheerful and very likeable officer whom I<br />
would welcome on my staff. Stevens has played<br />
a full part in all activities of the Staff College<br />
and has contributed well. Very co-operative. He<br />
should make a sound and reliable staff Officer.<br />
I believe this officer would be a useful Captain<br />
and therefore recommend him for promotion now.<br />
The rear-admiral added: ' Concur'. Captain<br />
Stevens was at the Naval Staff at the<br />
Admiralty during the period from 27th<br />
October 1960 to 7th March 1961, and this<br />
report was made on him:<br />
A bluff and cheerful officer who goes into his<br />
work with enthusiasm and has very quickly found<br />
out how the Admiralty organisation works. He is </p>
<p>conscientious, outspoken and willing to seek<br />
advice, and he is pulling his weight well. I am<br />
impressed by his commonsense outlook, particularly<br />
on Commonwealth matters. He is not ready<br />
for promotion yet, but I believe he will be suitable<br />
after a little more experience.<br />
That was signed by a captain of the Royal<br />
Navy and under ' Remarks of Senior Officer'<br />
we find ' Forwarded' and the signature of<br />
a vice-admiral, Fifth Sea Lord. Commander<br />
Stevens was still with the Admiralty between<br />
27th October 1960 and 18th September<br />
1961, and for that period the<br />
following report on him was made:<br />
The more I see of this officer the more I am<br />
impressed by him, and the more I like him.<br />
He is bluff and cheerful, but by no means a<br />
blowhaid. He gets on well with everyone and<br />
earns their respect for his professional knowledge<br />
and vigour. His commonsense is refreshing.<br />
Withal he is always prepared to seek and accept<br />
advice, and has learned rapidly how best to set<br />
about progressing-a project in -the Admiralty<br />
machinery. As an ' integrated' officer he has access<br />
to matters he might not see in a purely national<br />
capacity, but. I have absolute confidence in his<br />
discretion and no fear that he will abuse this<br />
position. I believe he will do well in a higher<br />
rank.<br />
The vice-admiral added ' Concur'. He was<br />
still at the Admiralty between 27th October<br />
1960 and 9th March 1962, and I have<br />
this report:<br />
I have nothing to add to my remarks on<br />
this officer in his last report except to confirm<br />
that I recommend him for promotion.<br />
That was signed by a rear-admiral and<br />
the vice-admiral added ' Concur'. Then<br />
there is a report from the Naval Staff<br />
Admiralty, for the period from 10th March<br />
1962 to 7th December 1962:<br />
A vigorous and forceful officer who deserves<br />
the goodwill which exists between him and all<br />
his contacts. He has dealt very effectively with<br />
the multiplicity of business for which he has<br />
been responsible. Coming directly from the Staff<br />
College, I believe that he has faced a challenging<br />
task with determination and efficiency. I do not<br />
doubt that he has found it useful experience both<br />
in general Staff. work and also in the work of a<br />
Service Ministry:<br />
That again was signed by a captain of<br />
the Royal Navy and to it was added<br />
' Concur' by a rear-admiral. Then there is<br />
a report on Captain D. H. Stevens, Commanding<br />
Officer, HMAS ' Voyager', for the<br />
period Ist February 1963 to 20th July<br />
1963: A popular and pleasant officer, who has a<br />
ready smile and is fine company. He has worked<br />
hard and well while with the Far East Fleet<br />
to good-effect. Very enthusiastic and rarely disheartened. There is sound material here but at<br />
present I cannot rate Stevens' chance of reaching<br />
flag rank higher than good.<br />
That was signed by a vice-admiral, and<br />
another vice-admiral added:<br />
I agree. Stevens has shown himself to be a<br />
good Post Captain.<br />
The last report I shall read in this connection<br />
covers the period from 2nd<br />
January 1963 to 6th January 1964:<br />
A very keen officer of average intelligence who<br />
is devoted to the Service. He has a volatile<br />
nature, considerable dash and much enthusiasm.<br />
He does not strike me as having great abilities<br />
and has probably reached his ceiling, though he<br />
will always give his best to the Service in any<br />
capacity. That was signed by a rear-admiral and the<br />
senior officer, a vice-admiral, added: ' Noted<br />
-I concur'. That is the last of the reports<br />
up to the time of this episode.<br />
Mr Whitlam-Are they the originals or<br />
copies? Mr HAROLD HOLT-They are copies.<br />
If the honourable gentleman believes that<br />
I would supply the House with false copies,<br />
he might say so.<br />
Mr Whitlam-You put in an anonymous<br />
letter once.<br />
Mr ACTING SPEAKER ( Mr Lucock)-I<br />
ask the Leader of the Opposition to refrain<br />
from interjecting.<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-I leave the matter<br />
to the fairminded judgment of the members<br />
of this House. A man has been the subject<br />
of confidential reports by senior officers<br />
from the rank of captain up to vice-admiral.<br />
More than twenty individual reporters are<br />
in the list that I have given to the House<br />
tonight. If the Leader of the Opposition<br />
wishes to study their names I shall make<br />
the reports available to him, but for obvious<br />
reasons they should not be generally canvassed.<br />
This has been the responsible judgment<br />
not only of officers of our own Navy<br />
but also of officers of the British Navy<br />
in Great Britain and outside that country.<br />
We are now told on the uncorroborated<br />
evidence of one man that we have been<br />
dealing with a chronic drunkard, a man<br />
who was not fit to command a ship at sea.<br />
Is it reasonable for anybody seriously to<br />
believe that the charge could be made that<br />
any one of these men, let alone all twenty<br />
of them, would be so lacking in a sense<br />
of duty and so lacking in a sense of responsibility<br />
to seamen under the command of </p>
<p>such an officer and going on operational<br />
duty with their lives at hazard, that the<br />
officers concerned would fail to report some<br />
blemish in the character of this man that<br />
made him unfit to control a ship or made<br />
him a hazard to the lives of the men under<br />
his command? That is what we have been<br />
asked over recent days to believe about<br />
this man.<br />
I ask honourable members to take their<br />
minds back twenty-four hours to the allegations<br />
that were being bandied about this<br />
place. Sir, I think I should put before the<br />
House one further piece of information that<br />
comes from a highly responsible source. It<br />
was prompted by the article that appeared<br />
in a Melbourne newspaper on 13th May.<br />
I am authorised to make this statement<br />
public on the authority of the Minister for<br />
the Navy ( Mr Chipp), who in turn was<br />
authorised by the gentleman concerned to<br />
release it. The Medical Director-General of<br />
the Navy, Surgeon Rear-Admiral Coplans,<br />
has stated: in view of certain critical statements<br />
appearing in a Melbourne newspaper on 13th<br />
May 1967 concerning the late Captain Duncan<br />
Stevens, I feel I must place on record my<br />
own perception of the man.<br />
I was acquainted with Captain Stevens for about<br />
twelve years. I use the term ' acquainted' in the<br />
sense that I am acquainted, by virtue of my profession<br />
and standing, with many officers and sailors,<br />
and their families.<br />
I knew Captain Stevens both professionally and<br />
socially. I have stayed with Captain and Mrs<br />
Stevens in their own home, and both were visitors<br />
to my house. I have never, at any time, seen<br />
Captain Stevens under the influence of alcohoL<br />
Indeed, he was so meticulous in observing his<br />
dietary restrictions that it became somewhat of a<br />
joke that when offered a drink he would invariably<br />
ask for a glass of milk.<br />
Even before his admission to hospital for treatment<br />
of his duodenal ulcer, he drove me many<br />
times both in the city and in the country. I refer<br />
to this because I do not normally like being<br />
driven by other drivers, but I never at any time<br />
had any doubts about Captain Stevens' ability to<br />
drive, and he was one of the few drivers in whom<br />
I felt confident at all times.<br />
I do not believe that Captain Stevens, with<br />
his history of dyspepsia and peptic ulceration,<br />
would knowingly suffer the pain, and risk the<br />
possible complications, of aggravation by over<br />
indulgence in alcohol.<br />
Somebody might say: ' That sounds all right,<br />
but what about that triple brandy?' There<br />
was evidence that, not having ordered anything<br />
to drink earlier in the day, on the<br />
night of this accident he ordered a triple brandy. A triple brandy sounds an enormous<br />
drink, but I suppose that if the Captain<br />
had ordered a tot of rum nobody would<br />
have thought it an enormous intake for a<br />
sailor. After all, the daily issue in the<br />
British Navy of a tot of rum has been<br />
going on for more than a century certainly<br />
and perhaps back beyond Nelson's time for<br />
all I know. A tot of rum consists of between<br />
2.6 and 3 ounces and'is the equivalent of<br />
a triple brandy. The medical evidence was<br />
that the autopsy which was conducted in<br />
an area of the body that would produce<br />
the least favourable results for this man,<br />
showed an alcohol concentration of<br />
0.025%. Much was made earlier in the<br />
debate of this result representing a rather<br />
considerable degree of alcohol absorption.<br />
It has been pointed out that 0.05% is<br />
normally regarded as the threshold at which<br />
insobriety commences but my understanding<br />
is that in Great Britain a man is taken<br />
to have reached the threshold of insobriety<br />
at 0.08%. In New Zealand, I think, it is<br />
taken as being reached at 0.07%. I speak<br />
subject to correction on this point.<br />
I do not want to canvass these matters<br />
in any technical spirit or in all their detail.<br />
They have been discussed by other members<br />
who are much more competent to deal<br />
with them. All I am trying to do is bring<br />
this episode back into something of the<br />
perspective that I believe it should rate. I<br />
have mentioned these matters in a desire to<br />
do, justice to this dead man who served his<br />
country for so many years, on the evidence<br />
before us, with great devotion, loyalty and<br />
ability. Nowhere in that record does there<br />
appear anyihing to suggest that his personal<br />
habits had disqualified him in any way for<br />
the conduct of a naval command. Earlier<br />
today the honourable member for Batman<br />
( Mr Benson) quoted some other evidence<br />
in relation to this man's physical condition.<br />
For reasons that we all understand he was<br />
not disposed to mention that his ulcer had<br />
played up again with him, but there is<br />
the evidence about the pain in which he<br />
found himself. There is also information<br />
to the effect that in times of great pain he<br />
would, as I have known other duodenal<br />
ulcer sufferers to do, take some spirits and<br />
water to ease the pain. However, what is<br />
alleged is a far cry from that. Indeed, the<br />
very symptoms that were alleged against </p>
<p>him are so inconsistent with a degree of<br />
alcoholic indulgence except indulgence such<br />
that no man could possibly carry out his<br />
normal naval duties, that they become consistent<br />
with a physical condition that was<br />
seriously affected by this peptic and<br />
ulcerated condition about which the<br />
Medical Director-General spoke.<br />
I return for a moment to a point raised<br />
by the honourable member for Batman in<br />
relation to Lieutenant-Commander Cabban.<br />
He asked: ' Why, if he felt that this man<br />
was in this chronically unsatisfactory condition,<br />
did he not make a report to a<br />
superior officer?' I ask that again, as did<br />
the honourable member for Batman, because<br />
it would be entirely in accordance<br />
with the duties expected of an officer of<br />
the Navy, even if it were a superior officer<br />
whom he was reporting. It would be<br />
entirely in accordance with the duty expected<br />
of him to report this condition to<br />
another officer of even more superior rank<br />
who could take appropriate action. I can<br />
tell the House that there is an interesting<br />
precedent for this in that one junior officer<br />
who did feel it his duty so to notify his<br />
superiors subsequently became Chief of<br />
the Naval Staff of the Royal Australian<br />
Navy. It did no detriment to his position<br />
in the Navy and is entirely consistent with<br />
what could reasonably have been expected<br />
of him.<br />
1 do not ask the House to judge these<br />
events tonight. I believe that not only is the<br />
dead man Stevens in a sense on trial in this<br />
Parliament in this debate, together with<br />
others to whom I have referred and over<br />
whom a cloud has been cast, but also the<br />
Parliament itseh is on trial as an institution.<br />
We are expected by the people of this<br />
country to behave with a sense of responsibility<br />
and a spirit of fairness in relation to<br />
this issue. The Government has not held<br />
back any material factor relating to this<br />
matter of which I am aware. After my colleague,<br />
the honourable member for La<br />
Trobe, had, for understandable reasons<br />
which we all can respect, pressed this matter<br />
so vigorously, it was discussed with him<br />
and considered by Cabinet. We came to the conclusion that we would<br />
not be justified in having any further public<br />
inquiry into this matter. Now that the House<br />
has had all the relevant information before<br />
it and has had an opportunity to discuss<br />
the matter, it is for the House to judge what<br />
course we should adopt. There are various<br />
possibilities. A select committee has been<br />
suggested, but anybody who has followed<br />
the debate closely during the last two days<br />
would have grounds. for questioning whether<br />
ihis Parliament, in this atmosphere and with<br />
so many personally committed in their views<br />
on this. subject, is the appropriate tribunal<br />
to'resolve, as between competing evidence,<br />
which should prevail. I leave that thought<br />
with honourable members. I do not exclude<br />
from my own mind a select committee as a<br />
possibility. There are other possibilities. I<br />
do. not. exclude any of them. There is the<br />
possibility of further judicial inquiry.<br />
There is the possibility that this matter<br />
having been" canvassed and laid bare as it<br />
has, with the question being asked of it<br />
whether this evidence would in any way<br />
have' affected the findings of the Royal<br />
Commission, we perhaps should consider<br />
whether any useful purpose would be served<br />
in further pursuing the matter and whether<br />
we would be justified in harrowing the<br />
feelings of others indefinitely by carrying<br />
these processes on. These are all matters<br />
which arise for judgment and I suggest io<br />
the House that it should not attempt to<br />
exercise its judgment tonight.<br />
I would like to have an opportunity to<br />
discuss ihese matters further with my colleagues<br />
and the members of our Parties. I<br />
have no doubt that the Leader of the<br />
Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) would wish to<br />
take a similar . opportunity to discuss the<br />
matters with members of his party. I<br />
would expect to be in a position to report<br />
to the: House at some stage tomorrow the<br />
recommendation which the Government<br />
would make to it regarding the future<br />
course to be taken on this matter. I would<br />
hope that' that recommendation would be<br />
based upon a responsible assessment, invoking<br />
that spirit of fair play and decent justice<br />
that I am sure all of us would wish to bring<br />
to our conclusions on this matter.<br />
