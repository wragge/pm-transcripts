The Prime Minister of New Zealand, the Hon John Key, will visit Australia from 18-23 August, accompanied by seven ministers from the New Zealand Cabinet.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand have a close partnership founded on common values and strong community links.  The countries share a similar foreign and trade policy outlook, founded on close cooperation in the Pacific, strong advocacy for open and liberal trade policy settings, and support for effective multilateral institutions.</p>
<p>Mr Key's visit will provide the opportunity to review invigorated work to build the trans-Tasman Single Economic Market and remove barriers to closer ties. </p>
<p>The Prime Ministers will also discuss the implementation of the outcomes agreed by leaders at the Cairns Pacific Islands Forum, with Australia, as Chair of the Forum, and New Zealand committed to closer engagement with our Pacific neighbours. </p>
<p>During Mr Key's visit, the inaugural joint Cabinet meeting between Australia and New Zealand will be held, recognising the two countries' special political and economic bonds and our shared future.</p>
