<p>Melbourne</p>
<p>The Prime Minister today officially launched the International Cricket Council Cricket World Cup 2015 with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key and Federal Minister for Sport Don Farrell.</p>
<p>This Cricket World Cup is one of the worldâs largest sporting events and will demonstrate Australiaâs expertise in delivering outstanding major sporting events.</p>
<p>It is expected to bring more than 50,000 international tourists to Australia, generating about $360 million in direct expenditure across Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The World Cup will also reach a global audience of over 900 million people, putting Australia in the international spotlight as a preferred tourism, trade, and investment destination.</p>
<p>A total of 49 one day matches will be played at venues in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Australian Government has made significant investments to upgrade many of the venues hosting matches â including the Sydney Cricket Ground, Adelaide, Bellerive and Manuka Ovals.</p>
<p>For our cricket-loving nation, hosting the Cricket World Cup with New Zealand takes on greater meaning as 2015 also marks the ANZAC centenary.</p>
<p>The Cricket World Cup 2015 is the 11th edition of the tournament and was previously hosted by Australia and New Zealand in 1992.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will work in partnership with the New Zealand Government, Local Organising Committee, the International Cricket Council, States and Territories to deliver a world class event.</p>
<p>The Cricket World Cup is an exciting global sporting event and we are committed to maximising opportunities for Australian businesses and spectators.</p>
