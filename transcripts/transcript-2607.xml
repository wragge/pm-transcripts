VISION VALLEY OPENING<br />
N. S W.<br />
Speech by the Prime tUinister, The Rt Hon. William McMahon, C. H. rM. P.<br />
3 June, 1972.<br />
The Reverend Alan Walker, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
When Alan Walker asks me to do something for one of the<br />
many projects which spring from his fertile mind, it isn't easy to say<br />
no'. I have known him for a long time and I admire him in the work<br />
he is doing in the name of his church for people in all walks of life.<br />
So whien he asked me to open " The Vision Valley Project"<br />
this afternoon, I could'nt say ' no' It is a great personal pleasure,<br />
Alan, for my wife and me to be here and for me to say a few words about<br />
this project. You have " reached for the stars", and here in this valley<br />
you and your colleagues have built a " Country Club" with a difference.<br />
This Centre will bring relief to young and old from the stifling life<br />
of the crowded city of Sydney. And in this way it will help to refresh<br />
the moral and spiritual values of our own community. In many ways I<br />
believe we can look upon it as a pathfinder for others. Its conception<br />
alone is inspiring and its practical value will be unlimited. It will<br />
give direct expression to some of the things my Government wants to secure<br />
for the Australian people. Among these is the development of a quality<br />
of life in Australia which has as its symbol and slandard, excellence in<br />
all things, and an end to oovcrty so far as it is within the power of<br />
mortal men, to achieve.<br />
There are tasks ahead in the seventies for all of us<br />
tasks which require us to share in a concerted national effort to protect<br />
the Australian environment not only from the man-made pollution of the<br />
air and the water, and the desecration of our great and unique natural<br />
assets, but from the diseascs of s) ciety which flow from crowded living<br />
and the tensions and pressures of contemporary life. Vision Valley will<br />
make a notable contribution to thlat effort.<br />
I sooke the other day Df Government plans to expand the work<br />
of the National Health and Mledi.: a2 Research Council, and of our wish to<br />
do something more in the nursing home and home care fields. </p>
<p>These are examples of a strong and continuing desire on the<br />
part of my Government to join with others in dealing with the social<br />
problems of the day, and to do our best to give to every man, woman<br />
and child in the Australian community the security and dignity that is<br />
theirs by right as citizens of this wonderful country.<br />
We will not rest in this task. Some of what we do can be<br />
measured in money terms and in the shape of buildings against the sky.<br />
But a lot, too, depends on the research we make possible; on the<br />
guidance we can give, and on the goodwill of the Central Missions of<br />
many faiths which we can foster.<br />
I think it is one of the remarkable aspects of Australian<br />
life that so much is being achieved by voluntary effort and by the<br />
gift of time and ideas and enthusiasms by a great legion of Australians<br />
who are insnired to do things in humanity's name. I hope it will<br />
always go on for it is one of the ennobling characteristics of any<br />
nation. Alan, I congratulate you and your fellow workers of the<br />
' ethodist Central Mission on the example you set and the leadership<br />
you give. Some of you may ask " What is the Government giving in hard<br />
cash to this project The honest answer is that it is not giving<br />
anything directly, because under the acts of Parliament as they stand<br />
we cannot spend the taxpayers' money in this way. But indirectly I<br />
want to tell you that we are helping, and I believe, helping significantly.<br />
We are doing this by tax deductability for donations of $ 2 and over to<br />
the project, and our contributions to projects run by the Methodist<br />
Central Mission which do qualify under existing acts of Parliament.<br />
This, of course, does allow the Mission to divert more of its<br />
own funds to exciting and original new projects like Vision Valley. And<br />
so many of you will know the Central Methodist Mission supports many<br />
socially significant and essential projects. There is its famous<br />
Lifeline Service, its homes for the aged and chronically ill and its aid<br />
to the physically and mentally handicapped so that they can be helped<br />
to find a useful nlace with dignity in our society. Homes for the aged<br />
and chronically ill and the handicapped do come under the acts I have<br />
referred to. And over the years the Commonwealth Government has given<br />
just over half a million dollars $ 574,000 to be precise to the<br />
' lathodist Central Mission for its nursing homes, hostels and home units<br />
for the aged. Now, under another act of Parliament under the Sheltered<br />
Employment Assistance Act we propose to give another substantial sum<br />
to the 1Methodist Central Mission.<br />
Mr Chairman, I have pleasure in announcing that my Government<br />
will grant the sum of $ 137,000 for the Mission's Sheltered Workshop at<br />
the Lifeline Centre in Rydalmere. This will be for the direct assistance<br />
of dibibled people. It will, as I explained before, also help to improve<br />
the development of Vision Valley by freeing other funds for this project. / 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
M. r Chairman, many people who are sorely troubled will come<br />
to this Valley and find comfort and hope. Others will find it a place<br />
to rest from their labours, and others, too: will find it a olace to<br />
refresh their spirit and body in healthy surroundings.<br />
All of them, I am sure, will find a new communion in life<br />
which will make them hapoier people.<br />
It is for these reasons I feel privileged to be here today,<br />
and to officially declare this Centre open. </p>
