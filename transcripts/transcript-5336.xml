NEW SOUTH WALES DROUGHT ASSISTANCE TO<br />
PRIMARY PRODUCERS<br />
The Commonwealth Government has decided to provide further<br />
drought assistance to New South Wales.<br />
he frollowing extensions to the Natural Disaster Assistance<br />
Arrangements have been agreed:<br />
road transport concessions for the carriage<br />
of both fodder and stock over distances exceeding<br />
km be determined at 50 per cent of approved<br />
standard rates for total distance travelled<br />
or 50 per cent of the actual cost, whichever is<br />
the lesser;<br />
1" carry-on" loans limit be increased from $ 5,000 . to<br />
$ 10,000, and<br />
the payment to primary producers for the slaughter<br />
of helpless and unsaleable cattle be increased from<br />
to $ 15 per head.<br />
This assistance will be of great value to the hard-pressed<br />
primary producers of New South Wales. The State, of course,<br />
is responsible for the administrative arrangements for<br />
distributing this assistance.<br />
On April 14, I announced Commonwvealth intitiatives on taxation<br />
concessions to assist primary producers to ensure water<br />
supplies and to encourage them to increase their capacity<br />
to withstand drought.<br />
This taxation decision extends the concession beyond what was<br />
available before the concession was: terminated by the Labor<br />
Government in 1973. It does this in two ways. First, items<br />
of plant in addition to structural improvements that were<br />
not subject to the pre-1973 concession, will be subject to the<br />
new one. Second, an investment allowance willbe available in<br />
respect of plant and equipment, the cost of which is coMpletely<br />
ded-Iuctible in the one income year. At no time since the<br />
investment allowances were granted in 1962 for manufacturing<br />
and mining, in 1963 for primary producers, in 1976 for plant<br />
generally, and this year for energy conversion has an<br />
investment allowance been available in these circumstances. </p>
<p>2<br />
In relation to New South Wales the Commonwealth Government<br />
has now agreed to the extension of the Natural Disaster<br />
Assistance Arrangements to include the provision of<br />
subsidies: to Councils and other organisations, as approved<br />
by the State, able to provide emergency water<br />
supplies based on existing facilities and on<br />
reasonable additional special costs ( excluding<br />
major capital items) incurred in providing<br />
emergency supplies to primary producers;<br />
to primary producers to assist them in meeting<br />
special costs incurred in the transport of<br />
emergency water supplies to their properties<br />
on the following basis:<br />
where water is carted in the primary<br />
producers' own vehicles, 50 per cent of<br />
assessed vehicle operating costs, as agreed<br />
between the Commonwealth and the State,<br />
for the journeys necessary; or<br />
( ii) where it is established by the State that<br />
a primary producer has no suitable vehicle<br />
for water cartage, a subsidy would be paid<br />
equivalent to 50 per cent of approved standard<br />
freight charges for the journeys involved<br />
if the cartage contractor is engaged.<br />
