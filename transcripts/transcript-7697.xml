PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, LAKESIDE HOTEL, 7 AUGUST 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: What is your reaction to David Lange's demise?<br />
PM: Well, I'm sorry that David felt it necessary to make<br />
that decision. I had some indication that it might be<br />
happening. I think it's an altruistic decision and I think<br />
that David Lange's made the decision, he's come to the<br />
conclusion that the interests of the Government and of his<br />
Party, are more likely to be advanced if he made the<br />
decision that he did. I think it's an entirely altruistic<br />
decision. Let me say, that it's a matter of record that<br />
David and I have had some policy differences, most<br />
particularly, of course, in regard to the decision I've<br />
taken in regard to the visits of nuclear ships from the<br />
United States. We've agreed to differ on that. But let me<br />
say this, that I've had a lot of work together with David<br />
Lange at three levels there's the bilateral level, there's<br />
the regional level and the broader international level. I<br />
pay an unqualified tribute to the way in which, in those<br />
areas, putting the other policy differences aside to which I<br />
have referred, in those areas David Lange has always been<br />
constructive, supportive. I'm sure that the economic<br />
relationship between New Zealand and Australia has been<br />
significantly advanced as a result of the way that the two<br />
of us working together have accelerated the Closer Economic<br />
Relations framework. In the South Pacific he has always<br />
supported our initiative, we've worked together well there<br />
and in the broader Commonwealth area I make the same<br />
comment. So, in total, I've lost a good working partner in<br />
all those areas and, putting aside the basic areas of<br />
difference that we had, he has been a constructive working<br />
partner across the Tasman.<br />
JOURNALIST: What was-the forward warning you were given?<br />
PM: Well, that's a matter between David and myself.<br />
JOURNALIST: Anzus?<br />
PM: That's a matter for New Zealand. At all times we've<br />
made quite clear to the New Zealand Government what our<br />
views are on this, but in the end we've said to them, as<br />
we've said to the United States, these things are a matter<br />
for decision by the Government of New Zealand. Now whether </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM ( cont): the resignation of David Lange will make any<br />
difference, I can't say. That's a matter for New Zealand.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you concerned that you<br />
might have sent out the wrong signals on another round<br />
of tax cuts in a time when the Government's still trying to<br />
get us to tighten our belts?<br />
PM: I never send out wrong signals. What often happens is<br />
that people get wrong interpretations of quite clear and<br />
unequivocal things that I say and I can't be responsible for<br />
that. Let me make it quite clear. I was asked a question<br />
yesterday about the possibilities of what might happen in<br />
the area of taxes, particularly viz a viz wages. I said no<br />
more and no less, as the transcript quite unequivocally<br />
shows, that that was a theoretical possibility. Let me<br />
remind you of what's happened. As we came up to prepare for<br />
the situation in 89/ 90, we had discussions with the ACTU<br />
earlier in 89 and we arrived at a decision which was<br />
economically responsible. That is where we had a projected<br />
wages outcome which was related to the decision we were<br />
going to make in regard to taxes. The significant surplus<br />
of the year 89/ 90, the year that we're now in, has been<br />
involved in that decision. Now all I have said is that as<br />
we come up to think about what we will do for 1990/ 91 then<br />
that question could be on the table. I said quite clearly,<br />
the transcript shows it quite clearly, I said now that's a<br />
possibility but I said we will make the decisions which are<br />
economically responsible. of course, in making that<br />
decision, our concerns about how the current account is<br />
going, will be pre-eminent in our considerations. So my<br />
statement, quite clear and logically unexceptional.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you had a talk with Mr Keating about these<br />
PM: Mr Keating has had to go to Sydney. He's had a funeral<br />
he's had to attend there. But I can assure you that the<br />
position between the Treasurer and myself is as it has been<br />
for a long time. one of cordiality, of at oneness on our<br />
commitment to make sure that we make the right economic<br />
decisions for the future welfare of this country. We have<br />
been working extraordinarily closely together. our<br />
relationship, as I think you will find if you ask him, our<br />
relationship has never been closer and more productive than<br />
it is now. It's a bit of a beat-up that I've noticed in at<br />
least one paper today and it will make no difference to<br />
that. JOURNALIST: in the last 24 hours?<br />
PM: Not in the last 24 hours. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
JOURNALIST: Are workers going to be happy with a<br />
national wage hearing that's going to be boosting income<br />
between $ 10 and $ 15 and will they want more?<br />
PM: You're referring to the decision that's just been<br />
announced are you? I haven't seen the decision yet so I'd<br />
prefer to have a look at the decision before I make any<br />
comment if you don't mind.<br />
JOURNALIST: Isn't there a danger in raising just a<br />
possibility of tax cuts next year that you're raising<br />
expectations PM: No. You see the only danger I have is that people like<br />
yourselves will try and read much more into a clear, simple,<br />
unequivocal statement than that will bear and carry. We<br />
live in a society where people like yourselves will do your<br />
best to beat something up and make it a beast to carry more<br />
than it's entitled or able to carry. I suggest that you<br />
read very carefully what I said yesterday. It was clear.<br />
Put down the hypothetical possibility that as we come to the<br />
end of this financial year and look to the future that that<br />
is something that could be on the table. But there is<br />
nothing more to be done in ' 89-90 out of what will be the<br />
considerable surplus for this year. Because that's already<br />
been done.<br />
JOURNALIST: If it's not a serious option Mr Hawke why raise<br />
it?<br />
PM: I'm a very polite person as you would've known from<br />
your long association with me. If I get asked a question<br />
from anyone, including yourself, I take it at its face<br />
value. I look at it and I analyse it logically and say well<br />
these are possibilities. So I discharge my responsibility<br />
of being polite, cooperative, analytical, constructive to<br />
you. I suggest that you should reciprocate and be precisely<br />
the same in analysing what I say.<br />
JOURNALIST: A new New Zealand Prime Minister. Will it<br />
affect the relationship between the two countries?<br />
PM: If we don't say that it must have some effect then we'd<br />
deny the influence of personality. I'll be the last person<br />
to deny that. Because I think it would make a hell of a<br />
difference to the welfare of this country if I weren't Prime<br />
minister. Now of course a change in leadership will make a<br />
difference. But let me say this. It's assumed they<br />
haven't made the decision yet have they it's assumed I<br />
think that Geoffrey Palmer would succeed Mr Lange. I know<br />
Geoffrey Palmer well. I've had the opportunity of meeting<br />
with him, not only privately but in a number of matters<br />
where we've been engaged in policy-making decisions. I have<br />
a very high regard for Geoffrey Palmer both as a<br />
personality, in terms of his capacity, he's a very able,<br />
hard working, dedicated man. I know that his attitude<br />
towards Australia is very positive and constructive. So </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM ( cont): assuming that he is going to be the Prime<br />
Minister, and I think that would be the decision, I can look<br />
forward to working very effectively and well with Geoffrey.<br />
JOURNALIST: Any concerns about the frigates?<br />
PM: They will make their decision about this. I don't<br />
think that the departure of David Lange from the Prime<br />
Ministership will affect that decision. I merely express<br />
the hope that I have before and that is that New Zealand<br />
will see that it is an appropriate decision in the interests<br />
of New Zealand and in the interests of Australian-New<br />
Zealand relations and of the region that they should be<br />
associated with the project. I trust that that's the<br />
decision they'll make.<br />
ends </p>
