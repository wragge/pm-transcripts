PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN WHITE, RADIO 3AK,<br />
MELBOURNE, 12 MAY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
WHITE: Sitting in front of me here in Melbourne is the<br />
Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. Good afternoon to you Sir. It<br />
was very kind of you to make that generous announcement that<br />
you made today.<br />
PM: Well it was a pleasure Brian. What you say about the<br />
contemporary music industry is absolutely right. I mean<br />
people tend to think of it just as entertainment and it's<br />
certainly that but it is a big industry in employment<br />
terms and it's growing in importance as an export earner.<br />
So we've been very pleased to put $ 600,000 in earlier to<br />
create a permanent source of revenue through that percentage<br />
of the royalties on the blanks and also to indicate to that<br />
we'll probably be doing a little bit more.<br />
WHITE: Alright. Now let's get down to business. The<br />
business of the day still appears to be the Liberal Party<br />
and it's frontbench. Are you surprised that John Howard has<br />
knocked back Andrew Peacock?<br />
PM: well it's obviously the end result of the stupidity<br />
where they clearly haven't got their best talent and it's<br />
not as though they've got a great deal of talent to play<br />
around with. But they haven't got their best talent when<br />
they don't have Howard in the ministry and to say that Jim<br />
Carlton will be better Shadow minister for Defence than John<br />
Howard would've been, is just an absurdity. What it reveals<br />
is that the bitternesses and divisions within the Liberal<br />
Party are as deep as they ever were.<br />
WHITE: Would you see it as an insult to Howard to offer him<br />
Education? PM: Yes. I think that's a fair way of describing it. It's<br />
your description and I can't bring myself to disagree with<br />
it. I mean he is clearly in a position where he's entitled<br />
to expect higher not that Education is not amongst the<br />
most important issue in this country I mean don't let me<br />
get that wrong but in terms of the ranking that it has<br />
within their portfolio structure, it was obviously knocked<br />
back. The two that Howard apparently wanted Foreign<br />
Affairs and Defence and what Peacock has done is very<br />
interesting. He said, " No John Howard. Ian Macphee is<br />
better in Foreign Affairs than you are." Most interesting.<br />
As you know John Howard in Defence, Jim Carlton, the bloke </p>
<p>-2-<br />
( PM cont) that you through out of the Shadow ministry all<br />
together and who is regarded within in his own Party and<br />
around Australia as a laughing stock after his performance<br />
as Shadow Treasurer, " I'm telling you John Howard that Jim<br />
Carlton's better in Defence than you are". Now it's pretty<br />
hard to get a more calculated insult than that I reckon.<br />
WHITE: Yes. Those none the less. All of this sort of<br />
thing is I guess usually epxected when a new leadership<br />
takes over any political party that there's at least the<br />
week of people settling old scores and bodies falling around<br />
all over the place. Once all that's settled down, one it's<br />
over, once ther is that new frontbench in place, what's it<br />
mean insofar as options for you as Prime minister?<br />
PM: It doesn't affect it doesn't go to my options at all.<br />
You see people tend to be asking this Brian, look I dont<br />
know whether you're asking in that sense about elections.<br />
WHITE: I didn't even mention<br />
PM: No, no. But that's the context in which it usually<br />
comes up. Now what you've got to remember is this. The<br />
bloke, the one bloke who raised the question of there being<br />
an early election was who? John Winston Howard. Why? Mr<br />
John Howard threw this scare thing into the ring because he<br />
had some idea there might be some sort of challenge going on<br />
against him, although it didn't seem to be too much on the<br />
boil about it. And so he was saying to those around him,<br />
" well look you can't go rocking the boat because Hawke's<br />
going to call an election". Now Hawke wasn't going to call<br />
an election. It was never in my mind to call an election in<br />
the middle of the year. He tried to line it up with the tax<br />
cuts. As I've said, the tax cuts were a delivery of a<br />
promise I made twelve months ago that I would give the<br />
people of Australia significant tax cuts from July 1. Now<br />
that's what it was about. Little Johnny Howard said, " oh no<br />
this means an election". Now the fact that he couldn't save<br />
himself and that he's gone and Andrew Peacock's in there<br />
doesn't do anything about my I didn't intend to have an<br />
election now and I'm not going to.<br />
WHITE: Well I didn't being up elections, you did.<br />
PM: And I thought that was the context that<br />
WHITE: Yes. Well I'm actually looking at it in the context<br />
of whether a populist leader of the Opposition against<br />
somebody such as yourself, a populist Prime Minister,<br />
whether that changes the way in which you will approach the<br />
problems that you have before you as Prime Minster? </p>
<p>PM: No. I mean why would you? I mean what we've been<br />
about is the process of making a range of tough decisions<br />
that have been necessary to handle the economic problems of<br />
this country, and that means essentially to get us back<br />
towards the full employment econoomy in which we've been<br />
spectularly successful. I mean the important thing that I<br />
ask your listeners to remember is that when we came to<br />
Office unemployment was over 10%. In their last 12 months<br />
there's been another quarter of a million thrown on to the<br />
unemployment scrap heap, and what I've said we've got to do<br />
is to make decisions between getting people back into work.<br />
We've been spectacularly successful, created jobs 4 times<br />
faster than undrer Fraser/ Howard/ Peacock, and we're doing it<br />
2 times faster than the rest of the world now. In that<br />
situation we've also got to take some tough decisions to<br />
keep the economy not exploding you know in a way which would<br />
just send us right back into recession. That means high<br />
interest rates at the moment. Now I want people to<br />
understand that I don't lightly make these decisions about<br />
having high interest rates, it's absolutely necessary now<br />
because if we didn't try to slow the economy down a bit we'd<br />
just be sucking in that much imports that we couldn't pay<br />
for and sustain. I think about this you know just about<br />
every day. I say to myself, you know I try to put myself in<br />
the minds of ordinary people out there and say, " well now I<br />
know that times have been a it tough for them, I know that<br />
high interest rates are hurting a bit. But is there any<br />
other way to protect the economy, not having a go but is<br />
there any other way?" You know I think about it every day.<br />
The answer is Brian that there isn't any other way. We've<br />
got fiscal policy as tight as we can. We've got wages<br />
policy tight. So we've just got to have monetary policy<br />
tight for some time. I just say to you all your listeners<br />
that I'm concerned about them and I won't have interest<br />
rates higher for one day longer than is necessary. But that<br />
also means that I'm not going to take high interest rates<br />
off a day before they should be.<br />
WHITE: But of course your opponents and that includes an<br />
increasing number of financial commentators it seems to me<br />
are saying that interest rates are going to be the<br />
death-knell for the Hawke Government. You also have people<br />
saying that there are ways of cutting a lot of money out of<br />
the fiscal side by reducing Government expenditure.<br />
PM: It's very interesting that people who say it<br />
particularly our opponents. They never say where and no-one<br />
acknowledges what we've done. Remember this, that when we<br />
came to Office Commonwealth outlays as a proportion of the<br />
gross domestic product were 29.1%. Now we've gradually,<br />
gradually cut away until the outlays now are not 29.1% but<br />
25.6% of gross domestic product. We've reduced a deficit<br />
that we inherited of the best aprt of $ 10B to a surplus of<br />
and we have a situation where the public sector<br />
borrowing is zero. The overseas debt is not a<br />
Commonwealth Government debt, it's in the private sector or </p>
<p>in the states. So we are acutally paying off debt. So we<br />
have done that by very, very severe cutting of expenditure.<br />
For 3 years in a row now there has been a real reduction in<br />
Governemnt outlays. So these people who just blindly say,<br />
" Oh well we'll cut another couple of billion off", let them<br />
be specific. I noticed just reading through some stuff<br />
during this week, Andrew Peacock said back in ' 87 in an<br />
article in the Bulletin that the Opposition must be<br />
absolutely specific and it must be soon about where we would<br />
cut, and he's right. Now where is he going to cut? Is he<br />
going to cut in Defence? I don't think so. Is he going to<br />
cut in pensions? I'd be surprised. Is he going to cut in<br />
other areas of social welfare, education, roads? Come on Mr<br />
Peacock, tell us where you're going to cut.<br />
WHITE: Well the Business Council of Australia what ten<br />
days ago did present an argument where it believes cuts<br />
could be made. Did you look at that?<br />
PM: Sure, sure. And yes there were some areas that they<br />
I know what their submission was, it added up to over a<br />
billion dollars it included some areas of assistance to<br />
industry but it's all very well for those people sitting in<br />
the Business Council of Australia I don't question their<br />
integrity at all. But they've got to understand that in<br />
these areas that they are making suggestions about it is<br />
not just a question of political difficulty but they've<br />
got to put it against the background of the massive cuts<br />
that we've already taken and we just believe that there is<br />
virtually no room left for perhaps one thing that they did<br />
say in their submission the one your talking about. They<br />
talked about cuts of about $ 500M from the states. Now we've<br />
made it clear that there's going to be at least $ 360M. We<br />
said that in the April Statement. There's at least $ 360M<br />
coming off the states. So there's some areas of agreement<br />
between us.<br />
WHITE: Of course, I haven't heard the term used for while<br />
but economists used to like talking about circuit breakers<br />
and one of the circuit breakers that I suppose might be<br />
around the place is if you were able to pursuade your own<br />
Party that selling off places like Qantas and the<br />
Commonwealth Bank would be a circuit breaker, it would help.<br />
PM: They are one off things. I mean you can theoretically<br />
argue cases for and against the sale of the but you've<br />
got to understand that that's a one off thing, that doesn't<br />
do anything in a continuing sense to meet these sorts of<br />
problems of balancing between revenue and outlays. You know<br />
it's in a different area. I mean we are different from the<br />
conservatives in that respect. I mean the Howard at any<br />
rate, you don't know what the Howard Opposition as<br />
distinct from the Peacock opposition was one which just<br />
had an ideological obsession against the public ownership of </p>
<p>( PM cont) any enterprise. Now this crowd, I think, is on a<br />
different certainly Macphee who has now been reserrected<br />
is out passionately against the Howard public asset sales<br />
situation. So one doesn't know what they are about. But<br />
the important economic point is that they are one off<br />
considerations which don't meet the situation permanently.<br />
WHITE: Let me come back to the matter of elections which<br />
you raised, not me. Robert Ray went on record the other day<br />
after the elevation of Andrew Peacock as saying that it did<br />
mean that there wouldn't be any reason for an early<br />
election. But Janine Haines who is not exactly regarded<br />
as a political heavy weight, but none the less is a very<br />
skilled operator as a politician Janine Haines reckons you<br />
ought to run right away.<br />
PM: Well when I get to the stage when I need to rely on<br />
Janine Haines for political advice in general or election<br />
timing in particular, I think I'd be in a bad state. That's<br />
all I need to say about Janine I think.<br />
WHITE: So what are we talking about with an election? Have<br />
you got any thoughts that you can offer that's new?<br />
PM: Nothing new. I mean I repeat, it's John Howard that<br />
precipitated all the talk, not Bob Hawke. I've said no<br />
early election.<br />
WHITE: There was no consideration being given at that time<br />
that Howard floated it?<br />
PM: No. I mean you see I was the one who knew what was<br />
happening about him. I was the one against all the<br />
political journalists none of them were on to it I said<br />
in the Parliament that it was on. I gave the numbers, I<br />
gave the timetable, I knew what was on. In those<br />
circumstances he didn't sort of know the actual details, he<br />
didn't know it the way I did. But he did have a vague idea<br />
that there was something happening. So what he wanted to do<br />
was to try and write down the impact of the announced July<br />
tax cuts to try and say, " Hawke was just dong this because<br />
he was going to have an early election,"' get people to think<br />
that this was a cynical exercise rather than simply what is<br />
was. That's how rough the Tory's are. You make a promise<br />
back there 12 months ago saying you'll deliver tax cuts from<br />
July 1 if there's a proper wages outcome, there is a proper<br />
wages outcome, you deliver it. But their standards are so<br />
abysmally low that they try and say, " Oh no, no he's not<br />
just delivering on a promise, he's trying to create an<br />
election". Now they got it wrong. They got it wrong.<br />
WHITE: I was in the Parliament t he day that you threw that<br />
number at John Howard the number being 34.<br />
PM: Yes. Did you see Andrew blush? </p>
<p>-6-<br />
WHITE: Well indeed what I did notice about Andrew was that<br />
he didn't smile. I did watch him.<br />
PM: well he was there wispering in the Leader's ear, " No,<br />
no I mean I wouldn't be doing this".<br />
WHITE: What did you mean by 34?<br />
PM: Well that's about where they were then 34. They<br />
needed 37 but Andrew's position was he wasn't going to run<br />
unless he had 40 or 41 because he took the view as he was<br />
putting it that you can't trust them. At the end when<br />
they go up to vote it might 2 or 3 back-sliders. They had<br />
34, 37 was enough, he wanted 40. Now he didn't have them<br />
then. But the events in regard to the Goldstein<br />
preselection and their perception of Howard's handling of<br />
that enabled him to tip the numbers. So I was right about<br />
the timetable, I was right about the numbers.<br />
WHITE: Rupert Murdoch's two newspapers in Melbourne the<br />
Melbourne Sun this morning suggested that you got, shall I<br />
say, a baking yesterday in your clash with Andrew Peacock.<br />
The Melbourne Herald this afternoon is running a poll, an<br />
opinion poll, which shows that Andrew Peacock would win an<br />
election if it were held right away by quite a substantial<br />
margin. How do you feel about that?<br />
PM: Well as for a baking, it was certainly not a baking.<br />
What happened is that I miss-heard a question that Andrew<br />
Peacock put to me at the beginning and it was quite clear<br />
that I'd made a slip in the Parliament earlier in the week.<br />
I'd said there'd been a increase in living standards of 8%<br />
per annuum. It obviously hadn't been it and never said<br />
that anywhere but apparently I in the Parliament and<br />
he's able to catch me out on that. It's not earth<br />
shattering. If that's the sort of question on which he's<br />
going to go as his first question, that suits me fine. I'm<br />
not worried about that at all. Later on I was misinformed<br />
about whether training funds for the Trade Union Training<br />
Authority was an amount that had been asked by a question<br />
and we had to correct that. No, no, no problems there. one<br />
of the problems we've got in the Parliament though which<br />
is obviously going to be increased under the tactics of Mr<br />
Wilson TUckey is this constant noise from the opposition,<br />
I mean they're just shouting, shouting, shouting, and that<br />
is somewhat disconcerting, I mean we're gong to have to deal<br />
with that. But as to the poll, I've said before there was a<br />
change in leadership, I said that if there is a change then<br />
there'll be a honeymoon period. I said it earlier this week<br />
when the thing was announced I said to everyone, " Well<br />
you've got to expect a honeymoon period". It usually<br />
happens when you get a change of leader and they get a run,<br />
that won't last. </p>
<p>WHITE: You don't have any concerns that why the 2 Melbourne<br />
papers are doing that which the Sydney papers didn't today<br />
that this might signal Rupert Murdoch deciding that Andrew<br />
is the next leader of the country?<br />
PM: I don't think that, you know, obviously I've had no<br />
discussions with him. I'd be very surprised if that were<br />
the attitude of Mr Murdoch. After all, Mr Murdoch has had<br />
the opportunity over many years now of seeing Mr Peacock and<br />
I'd be surprised if the assessment of Mr Murdoch on what<br />
he's seen and the comparison he's able to make, that he<br />
would come to that conclusion.<br />
WHITE: The other question that is uppermost in my mind<br />
today is one to do with Tom Uren<br />
0 PM: Yes.<br />
WHITE: Your old colleague. Now our Melbourne listeners<br />
would not have heard a long interview that I had with him<br />
yesterday, but just as a brief background, Mr Uren spoke, I<br />
must say move movingly than I've ever heard him speak<br />
before, on a subject which he's often talked about, which<br />
is the plight of former prisoners of war, Australian<br />
prisoners of war, of the Japanese. Yesterday was the first<br />
time that I've ever heard Tom talk about the diseases that<br />
afflicted these men on the Burma Thailand railway and all<br />
the various Japanese prisoner of war camps. He's appealed<br />
directly, through that program yesterday, for people to<br />
write to you to ask for more to be done to help them.<br />
What's going to be the answer?<br />
PM: Yes well, let me first of all say how totally I respect<br />
my friend Tom Uren on this issue. He's a man generally of<br />
enormous compassion, as you know, but this is an issue which<br />
is very close to him because he was a prisoner of war up<br />
there and on the railway and he saw so many of his mates die<br />
and he saw the rest of them come back, many of them with<br />
considerable problems. He's talked about this with great<br />
compassion in many places, including in the House recently.<br />
So what I've asked is that when we have a look at this,<br />
further at this situation and we will, you know, be taking<br />
into account what he's had to say and the very persuasive<br />
representations that he's made and we of that in the<br />
context of going up to the next Budget.<br />
WHITE: There are, as he says, fewer than 6,000 living<br />
former POWs of the Japanese, 70 percent of whom will die<br />
before their time because of the illnesses they contracted.<br />
PM: One can't argue about the very touching and real nature<br />
of the problem and I don't argue it. Simply one has to look<br />
at it in relation to the range of demands from a number of<br />
legitimate sources in the veterans community. I think it's<br />
true to say that this Government has an enormously positive<br />
relationship with the veterans community and their major </p>
<p>-8-<br />
( PM cont) organisation, the RSL. I was just meeting with<br />
them, for instance, Brigadier Garland and Ian Gollings,<br />
their National Secretary yesterday of matters. We have<br />
a very, very good relationship with them and we've got to<br />
look at this particular claim and issue that Tom is pressing<br />
so urgently in the framework of other demands, but we'll be<br />
looking at it sympathetically.<br />
WHITE: Now he has made the point, both in his speech this<br />
week and the one he made in October, that it was with some<br />
considerable dismay that he realised that it was the Hawke<br />
Government which did in fact cut back on some of the<br />
benefits that POWs were getting.<br />
PM: Well, if you look at the total range of what we've done<br />
for veterans generally, then we've spent more in increases<br />
in this area, in relative terms, the increase in<br />
expenditures on veterans has been greater than just about<br />
any other area of administration, Very, very substantial<br />
hundreds of millions of dollars of increase in outlays<br />
generally. One area in particular which the veterans<br />
community is particularly, you know, been responsive to us<br />
and grateful is the upgrading of the repatriation hospitals.<br />
So in all areas of Government there's hardly been one which<br />
has had a greater increase in outlays than veterans. You<br />
had to sort of balance within that massive increase in<br />
outlays the various issues that they put before you, the<br />
veterans and the representatives of the veterans community,<br />
the things which are their number one priorities and so. I<br />
can't say any more Brian, other than that I recognise and<br />
appreciate completely the integrity and total commitment<br />
with which Tom Uren puts these issues. I repeat, we'll look<br />
at what he's got to say.<br />
WHITE: I understand you just mentioned the fact that you<br />
had discussions only yesterday with the RSL I understand<br />
that this may have had to do with this new campaign which<br />
Legacy is also involved with, about getting into schools<br />
with the message about the Spirit of Australia. Is that<br />
right?<br />
PM: Well, that wasn't the particular issue yesterday.<br />
Really what we were talking about yesterday was that next<br />
year is the 75th anniversary of Gallipoli.<br />
WHITE: Yes.<br />
PM: And I announced recently that I would make available a<br />
707 aircraft to take Gallipoli veterans back there. So we<br />
were talking about that and starting to work out how<br />
together we would work out the details because there's a lot<br />
of logistics in that. These men are going to be chaps in<br />
their nineties and that's going to require a lot of medical<br />
and support back-up to go with them. So we've got to talk<br />
about that and also talk about what else we may be doing<br />
together to try and have an appropriate celebration for that<br />
anniversary because, of course, the reason for picking </p>
<p>-9-<br />
( PM cont) up that 75th anniversary is that by the time we<br />
get to the 100th, all those veterans will be gone. We want,<br />
therefore, to make the 75th anniversary one that will be<br />
vividly remembered.<br />
WHITE: Just on that subject, I am one of those Australians<br />
who grew up with a father who was overseas during World war<br />
II, he was a Rat of Tobruk, and I guess I've always grown up<br />
with the belief or a view that no Australian Government ever<br />
does as much as those men and the women really deserve. Do<br />
you think that your Government's approached the right level?<br />
PM: I think we've approached the right level. All I can<br />
say is that the retiring head of the RSL, Bill Keys, has on<br />
the public record been extraordinarily fullsome about the<br />
attitude of my Government and so I, in a sense, rest upon<br />
his judgement as head of longstanding of the RSL, about what<br />
we've done. But I think, having said that, I mean it's not<br />
a question of patting yourself on the back and saying ' well<br />
you've done better than anyone else has ever done<br />
enormous increase'. I guess it's an area in, one way you<br />
can never do too much because it's not an exaggeration of<br />
language or an exercise in rhetoric to say that we owe<br />
everything to these people. I mean these are the people who<br />
were prepared to lay down their lives for the future of<br />
their country and in that war, you referred to, the Second<br />
World War that your father was involved, the very future of<br />
this country The fact that we've got a free and<br />
democratic and prosperous country with all that it has to<br />
offer, we've got that and got it to pass on to our children<br />
in a very real sense, is because of the sacrifices those<br />
people made and were prepared to make. So how do you ever<br />
put an adequate measure on that?<br />
WHITE: Just one other side issue to this all again. The<br />
Japanese, there's Tom Uren who has got, I think, a very<br />
magnanimous attitude towards modern day Japan. But the<br />
issue of Japanese ownership of Australia or that part of it<br />
that they are buying up remains a sore, I would suggest,<br />
with a whole lot of people. Do you think it is?<br />
PM: Yes it does with some people and I'm glad you asked me<br />
the question. What I appeal to your listeners to think<br />
about Brian is this, these are facts that I'm putting not<br />
opinions. The fact is that Japan is our major trading<br />
partner. It buys more of our exports than anyone else and<br />
we get more of our imports from them than from anyone else.<br />
We are not an exclusive monopoly source of supply for them.<br />
If they wanted to decide to get their coal, their iron ore<br />
for instance, from other countries, they could. And their<br />
meat, they could. Now Australia can't have it both ways.<br />
We're either going to understand and accept the fact that<br />
this is our major trading partner and that our actual<br />
standard of living is determined in part by the fact that<br />
they are such a substantial buyer of our products and<br />
therefore carry the implication from that that they have<br />
rights in regard to this country. Well, we don't. You </p>
<p>( PM cont) can't say to the Japanese ' we want you to buy as<br />
much of our coal, our iron ore, some of our uranium, our<br />
wheat, our wool buy, buy, buy that Japanese friends so<br />
that you help to increase our standard of living, but we're<br />
then going to say to you that you're second class citizens.<br />
we'll discriminate against you, as against the world,<br />
and you will have differential and discriminatory investment<br />
rules against you'. Now what the Japanese will say? Say<br />
' OK, you think we're second class, you want to discriminate<br />
against us, that's alright, off we go, we'll do our buying<br />
elsewhere'. Now, who suffers? It's not just us today, but<br />
more importantly it's our children and their children. You<br />
can't live and operate in a world like that. But let me<br />
make the bottom line. It is legitimate for Australians, for<br />
your listeners, to be worried about levels of investment in<br />
certain areas, whether too much of a real estate is being<br />
bought up or so on. That's why we have a Foreign Investment<br />
Review Board so that we look at major investment decisions<br />
to take into account the Australian national interest. Now<br />
that's our position. In the Liberal Party, under the<br />
document that John Howard laid down and which Mr Peacock<br />
says he embraces, they would abolish the Foreign Investment<br />
Review Board so that you wouldn't have any mechanism there,<br />
no substantial separate mechanism to look at levels of<br />
foreign investment. But I'm pleased to say, and I say this<br />
in fairness to my political opponents, that while they<br />
differ from us on the question of a regulatory mechanism,<br />
therefore I think they are in an inferior position, as I<br />
understand Mr Howard's position, as he was then Leader and<br />
as I would understand it to be Mr Peacock's position, they<br />
would not differ from me at all in the exposition that I<br />
have just put. In other words, as I understand it, there is<br />
a bipartisan position and I congratulate them on that in<br />
terms of the view I just put. They would, I think, identify<br />
themselves with that.<br />
0 WHITE: I guess though that, I mean, in a sense I wasn't<br />
even really raising the question in the racist way that has<br />
been raised so often in Australia, but it's only 20 years<br />
that we had talking about buying back the farm and here<br />
we are selling it again.<br />
PM: Well, well, you either are part of one world which is<br />
interconnected in trade and commerce and economically or<br />
you're not and you can't say ' world, hiho world, we're part<br />
of you. we want to buy and sell with you, but world sorry,<br />
having done that little bit of the exercise, we're off'.<br />
Now every country is entitled, in my judgement, to have a<br />
national interest concept. I mean, in other words, take for<br />
instance if you got a national<br />
WHITE: Well the Japanese certainly do don't they? </p>
<p>-11-<br />
PM: Yes, although they are gradually opening up. They're<br />
gradually opening up. There's been a deliberate decision by<br />
the Japanese to open up and this is recognised<br />
internationally now that they are. They're still not as<br />
open as other countries in many respects but they are moving<br />
in the right direction. Now it is right for a country,<br />
including Australia, to say we are going to watch whether<br />
the level of investment and purchase of our assets is such<br />
that either in a strategic area or in quantities, too much,<br />
that we don't want it because it could put the control of<br />
our destiny, in certain respects, into the hands of others.<br />
Now, I will bow my knee to no-one in being totally<br />
committed, Brian, to protecting the integrity of this<br />
country, not putting our future in other peoples hands. But<br />
you take investment, what we need in Australia is to<br />
diversify upon so that we don't depend just so much on<br />
wheat and wool and iron ore and coal. We've got to get a<br />
stronger manufacturing sector. And if we are going to get a<br />
stronger manufacturing sector we need investment and we need<br />
it particularly I may say from Japan who've got, in many<br />
areas of hi-tech industries, the most advanced technology.<br />
So we want their investment, so they come in here and we can<br />
establish here in this country, sophisticated hi-tech<br />
industries which are able to boost the exports and the<br />
living standards of this country, but all the time watching<br />
that we don't allow a situation where the strategic<br />
sovereign control of our future passes to someone else.<br />
WHITE: Yes. Mr Hawke, thank you for that. Well, I've kept<br />
you well past the time that you had, but thank you for being<br />
here. It's good to see you.<br />
PM: Brian it's always a pleasure to talk with you. Thanks<br />
very much.<br />
