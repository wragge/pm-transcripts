PRESENTATION OF AUSTRALIAN FILM INSTITUTE<br />
AWARDS FOR 1969<br />
National Library, Canberra, ACT 2 DECEMBER 1969<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
Professor, Distinguished Guests and Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
It is usual, of course, to say that it is a pleasure to talk to an<br />
audience gathered together for whatever purpose it may be. On this<br />
occasion it is more than true because I think that what you have done in the<br />
past, and what we can, if I may say so, do together in the present and the<br />
future, will bring a new dimension to Australian life. We can show the<br />
rest of the world what Australia Is, how its people live, and impress on<br />
them the fact that there are other things than avant-garde kangaroos or<br />
Ned Kellys in this great country of ours.<br />
You m~ ay be a little surprised to hear me say that because I<br />
am sure that a number of you would remember some years ago, as a<br />
Senator when I didn't have to watch my words so closely because they<br />
were taken to mean what in fact they meant and weren't interpreted by<br />
others and then criticised as a result of the interpretation I pointed out<br />
in the course of a debate that I was attracted to the kind of television film<br />
and other films in which booted men advanced towards each other at the<br />
crossroads of a small town in the Western, used the immortal line from the<br />
" Secret Life of Walter Mitty" " I wouldn't do that if I wez yew, Toledo".<br />
I also found some attraction to the kind of private eye film where somebody<br />
went out into the night with a couple of revolvers, was attacked, hit on the<br />
head by beer bottles, knocked into the gutter, and five minutes later was<br />
able to get up and lick his weight in wildcats. This attracts me because<br />
it is the sort of milieu to which I am accustomed if you understand what<br />
I mean! Well, at the time that caused a little comment and I think for<br />
most of the population it caused a certain amusement because they agreed<br />
by and large with it. To a section of the population engaged in writing,<br />
particularly political correspondents from Canberra, it gave an opportunity<br />
to hold up their hands in horror that such a Philistine had come amongst us.<br />
But you must remember that at this stage and in that context, those remarks<br />
were made against a background of speech after speech after speech dealing<br />
solely and exclusively with culture in the films.<br />
Now I'm no Goering. Every time I hear the word. " culture",<br />
I don't want to reach for my revolver, but I do want and did want to have<br />
some opportunity to feel other than like a cultured pearl, if I may say so,<br />
and occasionally to swim into the sea and have these folk things before us.<br />
. e/ 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
But I think on the whole I might in the intervening years have been<br />
justified because you will agree with me, won't you, that critical taste<br />
on the whole has tended to catch up with me.<br />
I understand that Westerns are now high fashion and Western<br />
fans include the critics of " Les Cahiers du Cinema" and " Sight and<br />
Sound", so perhaps one was a little avant-garde oneself at that particular<br />
time. But on becoming Prime Minister, it did seem to me that the<br />
film industry here in Australia had reached that climax, that point<br />
where a decision had to be made, which occurs in all the best Westerns.<br />
And so one of my earliest acts was to push forward plans for the<br />
Australian Council of the Arts as a whole and I pay tribute to my<br />
pre decessor for having announced its inauguration and we nominated<br />
the Council Members in June, 1968. They met a month later and their<br />
Film and Television Committee had its first meeting in November of<br />
1968. The Interim Report of that Committee was in my hands by<br />
May 1969. It was adopted without any alteration, the moneys asked for<br />
were provided without any reduction which is even more unusual and<br />
in this year's Budget, provision was made for 11300, 000 $ 100, 000 for<br />
setting up an Interim Council to plan for a National Film and Television<br />
School The personnel for that Interim Council have been announced and<br />
the first action they are going to undertake is to all go overseas to study<br />
things, and then come back again and tell us what we ought to do. But<br />
at least that has been launched, and I think the travellers will be launched<br />
in about another three weeks.<br />
Then there was $ 100, 000 for the setting up of an experimental<br />
film fund to which you referred mainly for short subjects, short subjects<br />
which could be exhibited either on the television screen or as film in<br />
theatres. And then there was an exhibition fund another $ 100, 000 for<br />
the promotion and distribution of such experimental films.<br />
After the election, as I told you, the Council was named.<br />
But there are going to be interesting decisions to be made. Should the<br />
school be part of a university the National Film and Television School<br />
should it be part of a university so the film is seen essentially as an<br />
art form? I don't believe it should, but that will be a matter of<br />
recommendation and discussion and decision. I would prefer to see it in<br />
rather more practical terms. Perhaps it could be seen, and this is<br />
coming closer to it, I think, as a film school linked with one of the<br />
colleges of advanced education where technologists of all kinds and<br />
we must include in this, I think, if it doesn't upset people directors,<br />
producers, designers of scenery, script write14, all of whom have rn're<br />
than a merely theoretical part to play a practical part to play in the ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
development of film and television in Australia.<br />
Or should it as another alternative, and perhaps the best<br />
of the lot, should it be a part of some entirely new not college of<br />
advanced education, not university some entirely new centre where<br />
not only the National Film and Television School sets up for its purposes,<br />
but wher e the National Institute of Dramatic Art might perhaps set up<br />
for its purposes instead of in the University of New South Wales, where<br />
possibly the School of Opera or Ballet might also se t up for its purposes,<br />
and where all these art forms which have so much in common could<br />
perhaps cross-f ertilise aach other. Well these, and perhaps other<br />
things of which I haven't spoken, are the recommendations for which we<br />
are waiting and which, as soon as they are received, will be considered<br />
and on which a decision will be made.<br />
I am told by people closely associated with the industry that<br />
the films of the 1970' s may have very little in common with the films of<br />
the 1950' s or 1960' s in terms of form or content. As to the truth or<br />
otherwise of that, I don't know, but the experimental film fund, I suggest,<br />
is particularly important because through its tactics, through uts trials,<br />
perhaps through its errors, the new writers, directors and editors of the<br />
Australia of the 1970' s will be discovered. And we hope soon to advertise<br />
for applications for assistance to the Australian Council of the Arts and<br />
the Australian Film Institute.<br />
I said in a policy speech in 1969 that if we were returned as<br />
the Government, we would legislate for a film and television development<br />
corporation ( recommended to us again by our advisers), and that this<br />
legislation would be brought down in the first Session of 1970. An initial<br />
capital grant of one million dollars will be provided, and as that is spent,<br />
or as part of it is spent, it will be topped up each year to bring it back to<br />
one million dollars, and the fund will be administered by an independent<br />
board, whose members will be announced after the bill becomes law.<br />
I want to emphasise to you that this fund is intended for<br />
investment in films. It is not intended as a give-away programme.<br />
It is intended for investment. We will be indicating our optimism by<br />
such an investment, but we mustn't be expected, and I am sure it would be<br />
wrong if we did underwrite all the cost of a film or films in this<br />
programme. Producers will still be expected to have a substantial<br />
equity in a film and to show faith in their artistic judgment, and I would<br />
hope and expect that distributors those people whom I am sure many of<br />
us think of a the bA man in the Western films, stalking along in a black<br />
hat and black gauntlets the distributors should also be prepared to invest<br />
in such an enterprise and share the losses, if there are losses, and<br />
profits if there are profits. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
We believe, for we have optimism, that after a period of<br />
time, properly-made investments in film industries will be bringing in<br />
profits and that then there will be no need any longer for the public,<br />
through the Government, to top up the fund each year. That is our<br />
objective, and the measure of our success will be gauged by that.<br />
I hope that the Government, having shown the red badge<br />
of courage or in the case of a Liberal Government, the blue badge of<br />
courage should in turn encourage all investors to back this industry.<br />
We do expect profits in money terms. Above all, we expect<br />
profits in human terms. Our industry, I think in Australia, is one of<br />
the oldest in the world. I am told that " Soldiers of the Cross" was made<br />
in 1899 in Australia in Murrumbeena and frankly that is all I know<br />
about it and probably that is all most people in this room know about it,<br />
but at least there was a film made at that time in Australia. I would like<br />
to see it now. I am sure it has got all thcse jerky little motions they had<br />
in the films we used to see in the past. But that initial silent movie era<br />
was stopped in Australia by the introduction of the talking film, as so<br />
many of the film stars of the time had their careers ruined by the<br />
introduction of the talking film because it didn't seem quite in place for<br />
somebody playing the part of the Queen of Rumania to have a Brooklyn<br />
accent. So in Australia's case there was no great desire apparently in the<br />
rest of the world to hear an Australian accent. And the film industry was<br />
hurt further by the depression and suffered years of official neglect.<br />
Well, the Government has given support to other arts since<br />
the 1930' s ballet, drama, opera. Films in the 1960' s seem to us, and to<br />
me, to be a logical extension. of what we have been doing with increased<br />
momentum in the last couple of years.<br />
The demand for film is very much greater on television than<br />
it ever was when the picture theatres were at their peak. I am told that<br />
18-year-olds today have seen over 500 feature films by watching television<br />
which is more than we ever used to see as children or as 18-year-olds,<br />
travelling each Saturday to see the " Perils of Pauline" in the silent movies.<br />
So even to keep up a respectable proportion of Australian<br />
interest, to be able to show, to lift up to the world a mirror to this<br />
country of ours, we must produce more films and we must produce more<br />
videotape material a a </p>
<p>I assure you, Sir, and this audience, of my own personal<br />
determination, of my own personal commitment to this, and of my own<br />
personal burning desire that it should be successful for the sake of<br />
Australia and for the sake of the people living in it or some of the<br />
people living in it. Because this gives another opportunity for individuals<br />
with particular talents in this field to be able to express those talents,<br />
express their personalities, have a real reason, an interest in living,<br />
and this is part of what a modern society must provide to all those who<br />
are components of it.<br />
We have done well in the field of painting, of course; that<br />
is perhaps better known than any of our other arts overseas. If in the<br />
next ten years, in the exciting seventies, we can in the film world<br />
produce the equivalent of a Drysdale or a Dobell, then we shall have<br />
amply justified the work that all you gentlemen have done and the support<br />
that you in the audience have given.<br />
We need to be able to see ourselves through the world of<br />
film ourselves through other eyes if you like but the eyes behrzd the<br />
camera. This we need to see in our own country, but even more, I<br />
think, we need other countries to see just how we live and how we think<br />
and how we dispute and what we do.<br />
I doubt if many people living in Asia or in Europe would<br />
have any real idea of what life in the United States is like, if it were<br />
not for films and of course they haven't got any real idea of what life<br />
in the United States is like because they see films, but at least they have<br />
an impression which they get through films! I would hope that it would<br />
be our chance to give an impression, and a true ippression, to people<br />
of the world of what our couitry and our people are like in the city, in<br />
the country, and in the problems which beset each one of them and in<br />
the way in which they seek to overcome them.<br />
I think that in this way we can make a contribution to the lives<br />
of many people in this nation. Through the exciting seventies and at the<br />
end of them, I hope there will be established here a film industry, not<br />
yet as great as those in other countries, but so great that its ultimate<br />
greatness cannot be denied and cannot be prevented. And if this does<br />
come about, then this will be one of the most delightful things for me<br />
personally because I will feel I have had some part in it and I wi 1<br />
feel it is e thing worth having done. I will be able to hold that to myself<br />
even though I haven't done the work that all you others have.<br />
And therefore, Sir, I thank you for having asked me along<br />
tonight, and it was a real pleasure to be able to come. </p>
