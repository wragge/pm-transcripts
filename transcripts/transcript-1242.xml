FOR PRESS: STATEIvNT ISSUED FOLiO.-ING THE CON~ CLUSION OF<br />
DEFENCE CONSULTATIONS IN CANBERRA<br />
Consultations in the light of the British defence<br />
review have been taking place in Canberra during the last<br />
two days between Australian Ministers, Mr. Dean Eyre, New<br />
Zealand Minister of Defence and Mr. Denis Healey, British<br />
Defence Minister. The British Government's provisional conclusions<br />

New Zealand Ministers explained their attitudes towards<br />
the future problems of allied defence policy in this area<br />
of the world. Mr. Healey, who has also had discussions in<br />
Washington with United States Ministers, will be returning<br />
to London after a short visit to Singapore and Malaysia,<br />
to report to his colleagues.<br />
Arrangements have been made for consultation to<br />
continue as required through appropriate channels.<br />
