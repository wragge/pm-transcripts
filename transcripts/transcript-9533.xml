PRIME MINISTER 24/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS<br />
The Government has decided to recommend to the Governor-General in<br />
Executive Council the appointment of Mr Philip Flood AO, Director-General of the<br />
Australian International Development Assistance Bureau ( ALDAB), as the next<br />
Director-General of the Office of National Assessments ( ONA). It is proposed that the<br />
appointment will take effect on 24 April 1995.<br />
Before being appointed Director-General of AIDAB, Mr Flood was Ambassador to<br />
Indonesia from 1989 to 1993. He was Deputy Secretary in the Department of<br />
Foreign Affairs and Trade from 1985 to 1989. Amongst other earlier appointments,<br />
Mr Flood was Chief Executive Officer for Special Trade Negotiations from 1978 to<br />
1980. He was a member of the Administrative Review Council from 1986 to 1989,<br />
and headed a review of the Australian Customs Service and a review of the Schools<br />
Commission. ONA is responsible for advising the Government on international political, strategic<br />
and economic developments affecting Australia's national interests. ONA also has an<br />
important function in advising the Government on the adequacy and coordination of<br />
Australia's foreign intelligence activities.<br />
Mr Flood's substantial experience as a manager and his expertise in politico-strategic,<br />
trade and economic matters qualify him very well to give ONA strong leadership in<br />
providing accurate and timely assessments that will help the Government pursue<br />
Australia's political and economic interests in a rapidly changing regional and global<br />
environment. I wish to record my appreciation to the outgoing Director-General of ONA,<br />
Mr Geoffrey Miller AO. Mr Miller has been Director-General since 1989, having<br />
agreed to extend his original term of office. Before becoming head of ONA, Mr Miller<br />
had a distinguished career in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade where he<br />
was Deputy Secretary from 1984 to 1986 and as Ambassador to the Republic of Korea<br />
from 1978 to 1980 and to Japan from 1986 to 1989. Mr Miller will be undertaking a<br />
new appointment which will be announced shortly.<br />
