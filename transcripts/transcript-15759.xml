    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will tomorrow take up Prime Minister Gusmao's invitation to visit East Timor.</p>
<p>In East Timor I will meet Prime Minister Gusmao, Acting President Fernando Lasama de Araujo, the Parliament and the Opposition.</p>
<p>I will also meet Brigadier Baker and others from the Australian-led International Stabilisation Force.  </p>
<p>I will also meet with senior officers from the Australian Federal Police.</p>
<p>This visit will give me an opportunity to hear a first-hand assessment of the security situation and longer-term challenges from Prime Minister Gusmao and others on the ground in Dili.</p>
<p>I will use the visit to reiterate Australia's support for the East Timorese Government and for democracy in East Timor.</p>
<p>The Government and people of Australia were deeply disturbed by the attempted assassination of the President of East Timor, Dr Jose Ramos-Horta, and Prime Minister Gusmao.  </p>
<p>At this difficult time, it is important that Australia sends a clear message that we are absolutely determined to respond effectively to the request from the East Timorese Government for assistance.</p>
<p>We want to play our part in ensuring security and stability, and restate our support for long term economic growth and development in East Timor.</p>
<p>CANBERRA</p>
