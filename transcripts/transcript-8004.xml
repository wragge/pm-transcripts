SPEECH FOR THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
VETERANS' FAREWELL BREAK( FAST<br />
LADY DAVIDSON HOSPITAL<br />
SYDNEY 19 APRIL 1990<br />
Ministers, Distinguished Guests,<br />
Veterans, Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
If memory serves me right, it was sometime late in 1988<br />
the Year of the Bicentenary that Kim Beazley mentioned to<br />
me that Bill Hall, as Patron of the World War I Veterans'<br />
Association of New South Wales, had raised with him a great<br />
idea:<br />
That the A * ustralian Government might provide some assistance<br />
for a group of World War I Veterans to return to Gallipoli<br />
for the 75th Anniversary of the landing.<br />
Now we are on the eve of making that idea however<br />
improbable at first glance, however daunting in its<br />
execution a reality.<br />
And I count it as one of the great privileges conferred upon<br />
me by the people of Australia, to be able to take part in<br />
what is truly called the Pilgrimage to Gallipoli.<br />
And the greatest part of that privilege is to be in this<br />
magnificent company this splendid group of veterans, the<br />
Australians of Gallipoli.<br />
WiRen I announced officially last Anzac Day that the<br />
Pilgrimage would indeed take place, I had four<br />
considerations especially in mind.<br />
First was the intrinsic national importance of this<br />
Anniversary, the commemoration of am event which has never<br />
lost its hold on the imagination of the Australian people. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Second was the immense contribution that event made towards<br />
establishing a sense of the Australian national identity;<br />
and equally the importance I have always attached to And<br />
strengthening that sense of identity the fundamental unity ask<br />
of our richly diverse community.. wil<br />
Third, I welcomed the opportunity offered by this And<br />
anniversary for Australia, as a nation, to make a special Aus<br />
act of homage, not only to the surviving veterans of World<br />
War I, but to all Australian ex-servicemen and women. As twe<br />
And fourth, I had very much in mind the growing awareness of<br />
and interest being shown in their country's history by the 18<br />
new generation, as evidenced by the thousands of young qui<br />
Australians who are now making a point of visiting or<br />
Gallipoli; and doing so, not so much as tourists, but in<br />
consciously and deliberately as an act of pilgrimage and<br />
homage. The who<br />
Now, as the veterans here will understand -better perhaps Dis<br />
than anybody else in the world it is one thing to make an Nil<br />
executive decision to go to Gallipoli; and quite another<br />
thing actually to get there. wit hay<br />
It takes planning. But<br />
I am glad to say and you will be very glad to hear that men<br />
the planning for the second landing is a definite Gal<br />
improvement on the planning for the first. the<br />
This time round, it is an all-Australian show. And this ? 4uc<br />
time around it is not Turkish resistance that we face, but oni<br />
wholehearted assistance for which I am most grateful. But<br />
In the organisation of the pilgrimage I pay tribute to my the<br />
colleagues, Ben Humphreys and Kim Beazley. Without their the<br />
efforts and their enthusiasm, this pilgrimage would not have adv<br />
been possible. mat<br />
While the work was being co-ordinated through the Gallipoli Tho<br />
Task Force in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, all of us othl<br />
involved in its various stages have been gratified by the<br />
genuine spirit of co-operation with which the work has been And<br />
done. I sincerely thank and congratulate all concerned. I nexl<br />
recognise in particular the role which has been played by you]<br />
tbe RSL. And I especially wish to thank the staff of<br />
L~ dy Davidson Hospital for their role in providing and And<br />
organising care for our veterans. As<br />
But now, with the planning complete, it is time for us to<br />
ready ourselves for the expedition itself.<br />
I was pleased that over 400 World War I veterans, including<br />
over 100 Gallipoli veterans answered the Government's<br />
invitation last year to join the pilgrimage.<br />
1; 8i " 116, </p>
<p>And I am delighted to say that every Gallipoli veteran who<br />
asked to be included, and who is medically fit to travel,<br />
will be on the Qantas 747 tomorrow.<br />
And I say, quite simply, a more remarkable group of<br />
Australians has never left these shores.<br />
As World War I veterans, they were all volunteers. And<br />
twenty-five years later, with typical Australian disregard<br />
of mere rules, and the fact that most of them were over age,<br />
18 of them volunteered to serve in World War II. In 1939,<br />
quite a few of these veterans put their ages back to meet<br />
or beat the regulations just as some of them had done,<br />
in reverse, in 1914. In uniform and on Gallipoli, aged 161<br />
The travelling group includes a significant number of men<br />
who were decorated, including two winners of the<br />
Distinguished Conduct Medal and three winners of the<br />
Military Medal.<br />
With a track record like that, it is no surprise that they<br />
have volunteered to return to Gallipoli.<br />
But perhaps the most remarkable thing of all is that these<br />
men, all of them in their nineties, should be going to<br />
Gallipoli with exactly the same spirit which impelled them<br />
the first time, 75 years ago.<br />
Much has been written by others about the motives of the<br />
original ANZACS.<br />
But when we read and hear what they themselves say and<br />
they were great writers of letters, journals and diaries,<br />
these ANZACS two things stand out: their sense of<br />
adventure, and their determination to stick with their<br />
mates. Those are the two qualities which, I believe, more than any<br />
other, encapsulate the original spirit of ANZAC.<br />
And now, 75 years on, you have one more adventure ahead; and<br />
next Wednesday, Anzac Day, you will, once again, be with<br />
your mates on Gallipoli.<br />
And then, best of all, we will come home home to<br />
Australia. 1; 8 </p>
