, AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 14. NOVEMBER 1977<br />
GARRAN ORATION<br />
The Garran Oration honours the name of a most distinguished<br />
Australian. As Constitutional Lawyer and civil servant Sir Robert<br />
Garran was pre-eminent. His concern for Australia's law and<br />
Government was manifest throughout his long career. As<br />
Permanent Head of the Attorney General's Department he served<br />
with great distinction under no less than sixteen Governments<br />
between 1901 and 1932, and his personal influence continued<br />
long after that. It continues still, through his scholarly<br />
works. I am honoured to be directly associated with the annual commemoration<br />
of a man who contributed so significantly to the understanding<br />
and practice of government in this country.<br />
It is about a basic principle of our political system that I want<br />
to talk tonight the principle of responsibility in government.<br />
This has been much discussed in recent times, and a great deal of<br />
emphasis has been given to what are regarded as the limits to the<br />
principle of responsibility. It is even suggested on occasion that<br />
it no longer accords with reality.<br />
My theme tonight is to affirm the vital role of the principle of<br />
responsibility in our system, in which the Government derives its<br />
authority from and is the servant of the people. The essence of<br />
the principle is very simple. Those who make Government policy<br />
and control its implementation should be responsible and<br />
accountable for the performance of their trust.<br />
All democracies are based on the fundamental belief that the people<br />
choose the Government and charge it with pursuing the public<br />
interest, and that if they are not satisfied with its performance<br />
they can dismiss it. Among the democratic forms of Government<br />
however, our system is designated " responsible government" because<br />
it has another feature.<br />
The Government and its individual Ministers are responsible not<br />
only to the people at elections, but to the Parliament between<br />
elections. The people not only charge the Government with the<br />
responsibility of managing their public affairs. They also<br />
charge the Parliament with reviewing the Government's action.<br />
Ministers are individually responsible to the Parliament for the<br />
proper administration of their Departments, and the Government is<br />
accountable collectively for its performance. / The legislature' s </p>
<p>-2<br />
The legislature's power to scrutinise constantly the performance<br />
of Ministers and Government supplements and supports the requirement<br />
of regular accountability to the people at elections. if<br />
Parliament ceases to believe-' that the Government is-acting in the<br />
nation's interests, it can withdraw its support from the Government<br />
and the Government will lose office. Though this power is rarely<br />
exercised, recent events in Australia demonstrate that the<br />
Government's accountability is a living part of our constitutional<br />
sys tem.<br />
The principle of responsibility to the electorate and the<br />
Parliament is a vital one which must be maintained and strengthened<br />
because it is the basis of popular control over the direction of<br />
Government and the destiny of the nation. To the extent that it<br />
is eroded, the people themselves are weakened. If the people<br />
cannot call to account the makers of Government policy, they ultimately<br />
have no way of controlling public policy, or the impact of that<br />
policy on their own lives. For the Government to be truly accountable<br />
to the people and Parliament, the electoral and Parliamentary<br />
machinery must of course work effectively and democratically.<br />
But just as fundamental are two further requirements. First, people<br />
and Parliament must have the knowledge required to pass judgement on<br />
the Government. Second, the Ministers and Government must themselves<br />
be in control of public policy~ so that those who the Parliament and<br />
people can call to account are indeed those responsible. To the<br />
extent that responsibility is diffused beyond the elected governmentother<br />
than by legislative intent to that extent is effective,<br />
popular control diminished. These two conditions for effective<br />
responsibility in Government are complementary, but there are also<br />
areas where they compete.<br />
The clearest area of competition is the appropriate extent of<br />
confidentiality in Government. Too much secrecy inhibits people's<br />
capacity to judge the Government's performance. A complete absence<br />
of privacy in our system where advisers must be capable of advising<br />
Governments of different political complexions, inhibits the frank<br />
and open discussion between ministers, and between Ministers and<br />
officials which is critical to effective Government and Ministerial<br />
control. Responsible Government in Australia has over the years provided<br />
Government which, on the whole, has served the peoples wishes. It<br />
is important that we should seek to find and perfect the appropriate<br />
balance between the two principles which are essential to its<br />
operation. My Government has actively sought to reconcile these principles in<br />
the legislation on freedom of information and access to Government<br />
archives which is being developed, and which we propose to proceed<br />
with in the new Parliament, and in the Ombudsman and Administrative<br />
Appeals Tribunal, which are already in operation.<br />
I now turn to consider the various elements in our system of<br />
Government in more detail, in order to consider the implications<br />
of the principle of respd~ nsibility. Since I cannot deal with all<br />
the underlying questions in a limited time, I will concentrate on<br />
the Cabinet, the Minister, and the Public Servant, and on those<br />
matters which pose particular difficulties for the realisation of<br />
responsibility in Government. / Cabinet is </p>
<p>-3<br />
THE CABINET<br />
Cabinet is the focus of executive responsibility in our system of<br />
Government. It is not referred to in the Constitution and, until<br />
recently, was unknown to legislation. The Cabinet system has<br />
evolved over the years and this Government has effected and<br />
developed a number of measures including wide use of the<br />
system of Cabinet Committees, which I believe has enabled the<br />
business of Cabinet to be handled more effectively. Important as<br />
these measures are, however, I do not believe I should subject you<br />
to an extensive account of their intracies, and I have covered these<br />
in an addendum to the printed copy of this oration.<br />
Two of the basic aspects of responsible Government of which I have<br />
spoken are clearly evident in the functions and duties of the<br />
Cabinet.. In order tht the people can sheet home responsibility<br />
for the Government's performance, the Cabinet takes collective<br />
responsibility to people and Parliament for that performance.<br />
Equally, Cabinet responsibility can only work if Cabinet maintains<br />
effective control over Government policy.<br />
COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY<br />
Collective responsibility is the key feature of Cabinet Government.<br />
The classic doctrine is that each Minister must, in casting his<br />
vote in Parliament and in his public actions and statements, abide<br />
by, defend, and take responsibility for decisions of the Government<br />
of which he is a member. This basis of the doctrine is quite<br />
simple and immensely powerful. Unless the members of Cabinet<br />
pull together, once a decision is made, the Government's policies<br />
will lack cohesion and consistency.<br />
Those implementing decisions will receive confused and conflicting<br />
instructions and the public will lack a clear basis on which to<br />
judge a Government's performance. The requirement that a minister's<br />
public stance be supportive of Cabinet's decision does not mean<br />
that a Minister who disagrees with a particular decision ought to<br />
or does abandon his private opinions. What it does mean is that<br />
the Minister must stand by the Cabinet decision in public, and<br />
this applies in particular to the Prime Minister.<br />
Closely allied with the need for Cabinet solidarity is the need<br />
for privacy on the deliberations of Cabinet. This is fundamental<br />
to the operations of any Government, and the courts have long<br />
recognised the justification for Cabinet proceedings to remain<br />
confidential. I should perhaps mention that the need for<br />
confidentiality in advice given by ministers as executive<br />
councillors is specifically covered by the oath taken at the<br />
time of appointment. Without general observance of privacy, the<br />
Cabinet system as we know it could not survive. views would not<br />
be expressed with frankness; colleagues would not be consulted<br />
fully; and good government would suffer.<br />
Much of what I have said about collective responsibility and the<br />
need to have a smoothly operating Cabinet system, depends directly<br />
on the existence of mutual trust, confidence and respect as<br />
between Ministers in the Government. Cabinet is not, and cannot<br />
be, an organisation that relies on hierarchy and sanctions.<br />
Mutual trust, respect and confidence can be the only bases on<br />
which the full co-operation of all members of the Ministry can<br />
be secured. The significance of Cabinet unity, of Cabinet members'<br />
loyalty and support to one another cannot be over-emphasised, and<br />
/ I would </p>
<p>-4<br />
I would like to pay a tribute to the way in which my Ministers<br />
have complemented and supported one another. Co-operation is<br />
the word that comes most readily to mind when I look back over<br />
the past two years on my Cabinet's work. I believe that the<br />
foundations of a sound Cabinet system can only be built if there<br />
is a reasonable degree of stability in the composition of the<br />
Cabinet and Ministry. Membership of the Ministry and Cabinet<br />
must change and vary for many reasons, but too great a rate of<br />
change can be disastrous for responsibility in Government.<br />
The major threats to responsible Government, which I have<br />
seen, have occurred when high rates of change in the composition<br />
of Cabinet or Ministry have inhibited the growth of those<br />
necessary conditions. In the last Government, there were<br />
no fewer than 31 Ministerial changes in three years. In my<br />
view, such a record of shuffling and reshuffling of Ministers<br />
is not conducive to Cabinet confidence or good Government.<br />
The Cabinet system imposes most significant responsibilities<br />
and functions on the Prime Minister, and sometimes it is<br />
suggested that Australia is heading towards " Presidential"<br />
Government. On occasions I see in newspapers and journals<br />
that I have a " Presidential" style of Government. I do not<br />
usually bother to debate it because such an assertion is never<br />
clear as to its precise meaning nor what the evidence for it<br />
might be. If the comparison is with the President of the<br />
United States then on the one hand it overlooks that a<br />
President not in control of Congress has to face limitations<br />
that an Australian Prime Minister leading his Parliamentary<br />
party does not have. On the other hand, it overlooks the<br />
fact that an Australian Prime Minister must retain the support<br />
of his own party, and where applicable, of a coalition.<br />
If the commentators are implying that all power lies in the<br />
hands of the Prime Minister, then I can dismiss such an<br />
assertion simply by referring to the essential features<br />
of my own Cabinet. Strong Ministers taking responsibility<br />
daily inside and outside the Parliament for their individual<br />
actions and decisions within the framework of collective<br />
responsibility and mutual support between Ministers.<br />
The attribution of untrammeled power to a Prime Minister shows<br />
a lack of understanding of how an effective Cabinet system<br />
functions. It falsely assumes that the Prime Minister's<br />
views always prevail, because when Cabinet confidentiality<br />
operates as it should, a Prime Minister is never seen to adopt<br />
views at variance with those of Cabinet.<br />
Some deliberate checks to slow down the number of submissions<br />
and reduce the pressure on Ministers have been reduced. The<br />
Ministry has insisted on wider and more thorough consultation<br />
between Departments before matters come to Cabinet. But we<br />
are dealing with a lot more business, and it still has to be<br />
encompassed in the time available for meetings mostly in<br />
Canberra and on the days when Parliament is sitting.<br />
In this Government the consequence of the greater pressure<br />
that the Ministry has to cope with is not the emergence of<br />
one man rule but rather the opposite. A greater emphasis on<br />
consultation and a greater use of the mechanism of Cabinet<br />
than ever before. / What the </p>
<p>What the public does not see is the vast co-operative effort<br />
of Ministers and Departments to see that a proposal is fleshed<br />
out, examined, options considered and decisions taken.<br />
In the Cabinet Room proposals are explained, are freely discussed,<br />
privacy is respected and agreement is reached on a proper course<br />
of action. The collectivity of Cabinet is not just an academic<br />
phrase; it is a real, and necessary, and enduring part of our<br />
system. THE MINISTERS<br />
I turn now to the specific question of Ministerial responsibility.<br />
The role of the Minister in our system of Government is fundamental.<br />
It is through Ministers that the ends of Government are formulated<br />
and pursued in dynamic and creative ways. It is the Minister who<br />
as a Member of Parliament owes his position to popular election.<br />
It is the Minister who, between elections, is the person clearly<br />
identifiable as responsible for the initiation, the definition,<br />
and the administration of public programmes. Performance of the<br />
Minister is a vital factor judged when the Government faces the<br />
electorate. The Westminster system can only work if it is clear to the people<br />
that exercises of authority are controlled by those who have been<br />
elected. Writers on Ministerial responsibility are now recognising<br />
that the idea isnot an easy one to achieve in practice if it<br />
ever was. It has always been difficult for a Minister to be<br />
aware of let alone directly involved in every exercise of<br />
the powers conferred upon him. I do not know why this Ministerial<br />
inability to be Superman should surprise anyone. It is, after<br />
all, the very reason for the existence of a public service,<br />
organised into Departments, to act as the Minister's agents.<br />
Too often, commentators tend to overlook the Minister's role in<br />
controlling, guiding and continuously supervising the bureaucracy,<br />
and the mechanisms and structures necessary to secure effective<br />
Ministerial control. Occasionally this can lead to the notion<br />
that the Minister is there just to carry the can in Parliament and<br />
in public when something goes wrong in the public service.<br />
The Minister can even be seen as the Department's representative<br />
in the Cabinet and the Parliament, carrying the Department's<br />
position, bargaining for it and securing its victory.<br />
This picture is inaccurate but nonetheless when notions of this<br />
kind are present in our thinking and discussion they can condition<br />
proposals for change.<br />
For example, some contemporary discussion of the accountability of<br />
our executive Government is in terms of the accountability of the<br />
public service, and aims at developing checks and balances in the<br />
public service itself ( which basically bypass the Minister).<br />
The primary role and responsibility of the Minister, as the<br />
representative of the electorate, is to be responsible to it,<br />
through the Parliament, for the formulation of policies and their<br />
implementation. That is the positive aspect of the doctrine of<br />
Ministerial responsibility. Any suggestion or proposal whose<br />
effect is to restrict or confine this responsibility must be<br />
rejected. / I should </p>
<p>-6<br />
I should also make mention here of the valuable role being<br />
played by Ministerial staff in strengthening Ministerial<br />
control. The Ministerial staff provide an important support<br />
to the Minister in his carrying out of those functions which<br />
cannot be delegated to Departments without handing over<br />
responsibilities which must be his alone. The Ministerial<br />
staff have become an important increment to the resources<br />
available to the elected Government in carrying out the<br />
tasks for which it was elected.<br />
The experience of the present Government shows that it is<br />
possible for the Ministerial staff and Departments to work<br />
harmoniously together in carrying out their respective functions.<br />
Provided it is recognised that the functions of these two groups<br />
of staff are distinct, it is possible to avoid the damaging<br />
competition which arose in the past. I have no doubt that<br />
the system can continue to develop in a way which strengthens<br />
the principle of Ministerial responsibility in our system of<br />
Government. It is also appropriate to mention here that all<br />
Ministers in my Government and each member of their staff have<br />
provided me with a statement of their personal pecuniary<br />
interests, and have kept it up to date. Detailed rules have<br />
also been developed under. the present Government concerning<br />
the acceptance of gifts by Ministers.<br />
THE PUBLIC SERVANT<br />
The role of the public servant is to act as the agent of the<br />
elected Government. That is an extraordinarily important role<br />
and the responsibility of the public servant is a high and<br />
onerous one. By any standards, the Australian public service<br />
is highly sophisticated, knowledgeable, and professional.<br />
It has considerable security of tenure and constitutes a<br />
career system within which individual public servants can<br />
pursue their career ambitions.<br />
This range of benefits and reward opportunities is available<br />
almost exclusively to public servants in contemporary societies.<br />
In return, Australians have been well served by the Australian<br />
public service. It has performed its role with dedication and<br />
often under considerable pressures. In recent years, as part<br />
of the expansion of public expenditure promoted by our<br />
predecessors, the public service network underwent a very<br />
rapid growth which had a significant impact on the Budget<br />
deficit. This Government has pursued a policy of streamlining the<br />
service with the objective of making it a more efficient<br />
instrument of Government policy. In the period from<br />
November 1975 to 30 June 1977, the real reduction in total<br />
Commonwealth full time civilian staff under ceilings control<br />
was about 11,500.<br />
If, instead of this policy, Commonwealth staff had continued<br />
to grow at the average rate of 4.83 per cent experienced over<br />
the three years up to June 1975 about $ 770 million would have<br />
been added to the Commonwealth salaries bill over the past two<br />
years. When superannuation, office accommodation, and other<br />
overheads are included, the total cost of this would of course<br />
have been very much higher. / This initial </p>
<p>-7<br />
This initial process of streamlining has now been substantially<br />
completed. There will be pockets of expansion and contraction,<br />
but in general there will be stability in the service. There<br />
will of course continue to be change and progress to meet the<br />
changing needs of modern Government. It is important, however,<br />
that changes to the existing framework should only be brought<br />
about for good reason.<br />
I do not believe in changing the machinery of Government for<br />
the sake of trying to give an impression of new and grand<br />
initiatives. Constant reorganisation is disruptive to the<br />
Departments and often costly. The public service can only<br />
give of its best when it is not faced with continuing upheaval<br />
in its organisation.<br />
My Government looks to it, and its senior members in particular,<br />
for strong and competent support in the formulation of policies,<br />
and in taking a major part in administering those policies when<br />
they are determined.<br />
The responsibilities of the public service in part are onerous<br />
because the public servant must work in a political environment.<br />
The basic philosophy of our public service is that it is nonpolitical.<br />
This does not mean that a senior administrator<br />
should not have a sense of the political. Indeed, he must<br />
recognise the political context of his actions and their<br />
political components. This is applicable in all policy fields<br />
for even the most abstract science and neutral technology can<br />
have a profound political impact when translated into practice.<br />
The public service, however, must be able to serve the needs<br />
of the Government of the day, regardless of that Government's<br />
political complexion. Senior officers must canvass a range of<br />
policy options with Ministers, but once a decision is made,<br />
they must use all of their skills to ensure effective<br />
implementation. This may require a public servant to pursue<br />
policies and programmes with which he disagrees.<br />
There will be less strain on the official in doing this and on<br />
his capacity to behave similarly with a different Government,<br />
if he is politically detached and non-partisan. Unless this<br />
is the case with the career official, the stability and the<br />
professionalism of the public service will also be subject to<br />
severe strain.<br />
The present Government has recognised that there may be<br />
occasions upon which Governments will wish to appoint<br />
politically committed persons to the highest public service<br />
positions. When such politically committed persons are<br />
appointed, there should be no continuing commitment to them<br />
on the part of succeeding Governments. To argue that there<br />
should be is to misunderstand the nature of the Australian<br />
public service. / The appointment </p>
<p>-8<br />
This appointment of a politically committed individual as head<br />
of a department, might serve the interests of the Government<br />
making the appointment verywell. But new governments might<br />
conclude that it is impossible for a person so identified<br />
with their politicalopponents to serve them impartially.<br />
The senior administrator frequently finds himself in situations<br />
which require the highest degree of confidentiality.<br />
He is present at discussions with and between Ministers and<br />
Departments. On all such occasions, the public servant is<br />
occupying a position of trust. Where discussions between Ministers<br />
are concerned, the public servant is only present on the basis<br />
of trust. The result of the implantation of political partisans<br />
within a career public service would be the destruction of<br />
this trust, and ultimately the total destruction of the public<br />
service as we know it.<br />
We have responded to this problem with the Public Service<br />
Amendment ( First Division Officers) Act passed earlier this year.<br />
It establishes new statutory procedures for the appointment of<br />
permanent heads of departments. Primary responsibility is now<br />
placed in the hands of a committee headed by the Chairman of<br />
the Public Service Board. This Committee prepares for Cabinet<br />
a short list of suitable candidates. only a person appointed<br />
from this list or from any revised list prepared by the Committeeretains<br />
security of tenure. If the Government of the day chooses<br />
to appoint a person not on the short list, he or she can only<br />
be appointed initially for a fixed term of not more than five years,<br />
and on a change of government, the appointment can be immediately<br />
terminated. It is felt that these new procedures enable a government to make<br />
appointments from outside the normal public service career<br />
structure, but prevent any lasting breach of the principle of an<br />
apolitical public service.<br />
Non-partisanship and the observance of confidentiality are not<br />
simply the requirements of advisors and senior management.<br />
Citizens at all points of contact with public departments and<br />
agencies are entitled to expect, and receive, non-partisan<br />
treatment and to have their affairs treated respectfully and<br />
confidentially. Moreover, we expect officials to observe the<br />
highest possible standards of technical performance.<br />
On both counts in maintaining ethical and technical standardsthe<br />
government is able to rely to a considerable extent on the<br />
powerful ethos of the Public Service itself. The Government<br />
and the Parliament also rely on central coordinating agencies<br />
for advice and administrative assistance in maintaining many of<br />
these standards. More recently, innovations have been made to<br />
provide Parliament and people with additional information, and<br />
to provide aggrieved citizens redress for their complaints. </p>
<p>9-<br />
These include the House of Representatives Committee on<br />
Expenditure; efficiency audits by the Auditor-General;<br />
the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; the Commonwealth Ombudsman;<br />
the Administrative Decisions ( judicial Review) Act.<br />
other suggestions have been made to enhance the standards of<br />
performance and accountability for those administrative actions<br />
for which the Government is responsible. Many have come from<br />
the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration<br />
and are being considered by the Government.<br />
The Government will continue to work on the implementation of<br />
various aspects of the Coombs Report, which contains many worthwhile<br />
recommendation. We will help public servants with further<br />
training and education; we want to make the Public Service<br />
more mobile within and between departments; and we have<br />
approved schemes for executive training and exchanges between the<br />
Public Service and private industry. Such schemes will be<br />
mutually productive private industry and the Public Service<br />
will each understand the other better.<br />
I stress once again, however, thatthe first premise in our<br />
consideration of suggestions for change in the Public Service<br />
should always be that methods of accountability must enhance<br />
not diminish the positive roles embedded in the doctrines<br />
of Ministerial, Cabinet and Parliamentary responsibility.<br />
EXECUTIVE AND POLICY RESPONSIBILITY<br />
It now remains to speak briefly on how the three arms of<br />
executive government of which I have spoken Cabinet, the<br />
Minister and the Public Servant combine in the formulation of<br />
new policy.<br />
While the administration of the executive powers of government has<br />
a great impact on many business and private decisions, the<br />
formulation of policy reaching out to the future is clearly<br />
of equal importance. This is especially true in a world where<br />
circumstances, attitudes and behaviour patterns are changing<br />
rapdily as appears to have been the case in recent times.<br />
How is policy formulated? To what extent is it under the control of<br />
Ministers or bureaucracies? What power do those outside Government<br />
and bureaucracies have in influencing policy?<br />
Any competent administration will start from the point that no one<br />
person or group has a monopoly of good ideas good ideas are<br />
scarce. Hence a government must have the capacity to find these<br />
ideas, wherever theymay be and more importantly have the capacity<br />
to recognise and to act on them. A competent administrator does<br />
not necessarily have to be a person capable of generating novel<br />
or new ideas of his own. He will often be busy with the tasks<br />
of administration. </p>
<p>10<br />
But he does need to know how to find the ideas from which<br />
new policies can develop. My Government has sought to develop<br />
new ideas in several ways. Ideas, constantly flow out of<br />
Cabinet meetings, and on a number of occasions full Ministerial<br />
meetings have been held to discuss forward policy issues.<br />
Quite deliberately at these meetings, there has been no formal<br />
agenda in front of Ministers, nor are Ministers limited to<br />
putting forward ideas that cover only their own departments.<br />
They have been positively encouraged to put forward ideas across<br />
the whole realm of government.<br />
A Minister has a responsibility to see that his department is<br />
so organised that it does think positively about the future.<br />
The department that merely reacts to circumstances and cannot<br />
think of the future, that cannot propose ideas, is self-evidently<br />
bady organised. In addition, my Government consciously endeavours<br />
to reach out into the wider public for the development and<br />
formulation of ideas.<br />
We have done this both formally and informally. We have,<br />
for example, established a government economic panel and an<br />
economic consultative group for the formal communication of broad<br />
economic ideas. Ministers, also have frequent contact in the<br />
Cabinet room with the executives of various organisations.<br />
At these meetings, the conversation and exchange of ideas is<br />
quite informal. We also endeavour at these meetings to increase<br />
our understanding of how the general public will react to new<br />
proposals and programmes. This is not just a question of<br />
political advancement, which I suppose has to be part of the<br />
concern of all governments.<br />
It is also a question of being able to judge whether there<br />
is an aspect to a potentially new policy to which the public could<br />
be particularly sensitive, and which could cause the failure of<br />
the policy as a whole. This is not always an easy judgement to<br />
make, for people do react in unexpected ways.<br />
I can illustrate this point by taking an example from the<br />
economic area. Many people still look for public reactions to<br />
economic policies as though conditions have not changed from<br />
the time when the policies of Keynes were appropriate.<br />
Keynes developed the thesis that at a time of unemployment,<br />
increased government spending would create more jobs.<br />
Those who still propound that view today fail to understand that<br />
the pre-conditions for the successful applications of Keynes no<br />
longer exist.<br />
The public simply does not react in the classic manner Keynes<br />
described. Increased government spending leads people to<br />
increase their inflationary expecations. Businessmen start<br />
predicting higher costs and wages, and raise their own prices<br />
in anticipation. Wage and salary earners expecting a more<br />
difficult economic outlook, curtail their spending. The result<br />
is higher unEnployment in the private sector, offsetting any short<br />
lived stimulus arising from the intial government spending. / il </p>
<p>11<br />
CONCLUSIONS May I conclude by commenting briefly on the need for responsibility<br />
in government in its widest sense. If public confidence in our<br />
Parliamenttary institutions is to be maintained, it is vital<br />
that Ministers and those who aspire to Ministerial rank<br />
remain responsible in what they promise to achieve in office.<br />
Promises which are quite unrealistic and cannot be performed<br />
damage not just the politican who makes them, but our entire<br />
system of government.<br />
The Australian electorate is profoundly suspicious of any<br />
political leader who promises the world, particularly if he<br />
implies that his promises can be achieved at no cost.<br />
The electorate in fact pays a heavy cost for glossy new<br />
programmes with a big price tag either through higher taxes<br />
or through increased inflation. This is a lesson we have all<br />
learnt in the recent past.<br />
Our responsibility as political leaders is to contain the<br />
public's expectations of the government's performance within<br />
the bounds of what is in fact achievable. People must be able to<br />
see government effectively implementing the policies on which<br />
it was elected. A constant procession of promises followed by<br />
disappointment can onlylead to widespread public cynicism<br />
and disenchantment.<br />
The pressures placed on a Minister of meeting the expectations<br />
of the electorate and of satisfying the constant scrutiny<br />
of Parliament and of keeping firm control over this portfolio<br />
are very great, but it is vital that they be met.<br />
For the continuing health and vitality of our political system<br />
closely depends on the extent to which the duties of<br />
Ministerial responsibility in all its facets are fully<br />
performed. / Addendum </p>
<p>ADDENDUM<br />
ORGANISING THE CABINET<br />
To the extent that responsible government depends on the<br />
effectiveness of Cabinet, the efficient organisation of Cabinet<br />
becomes of paramount importance. Since 1956, Federal Liberal<br />
Governments have distinguished between " Cabinee' and " Ministry".<br />
Just as the British have found, it has been our experience<br />
that this division has greatly improved the overall decision<br />
making process.<br />
There are periodically meetings of the full Ministry, and<br />
Ministers not in the Cabinet are coopted to be present at<br />
Cabinet or a Committee when particular matters of interest<br />
to them are under discussion, or may attend with the<br />
Prime Minister's agreement.<br />
Under my government there are strict rules about what matters must<br />
be decided in Cabinet and on the procedures to be followed<br />
in the actual submission of items. Items considered by<br />
Cabinet include, major or significant issues ( including both<br />
the implementation of new policies and programmes and the<br />
revision of existing ones); proposals involving large expenditure<br />
or employment questions; proposals having a considerable impact<br />
upon relations with other governments; proposals requiring<br />
legislation; and senior government appointments.<br />
The present government has adopted a structure of Standing<br />
Cabinet Committees which range over the various areas of government<br />
activity. The General Administrative Committee, the Legislation<br />
Committee, the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee,<br />
the Intelligence and Security Committee, the Machinery of<br />
Government Committee, and the Planning and Coordination Committee<br />
meet frequently and have proved to be very useful.<br />
We originally established an Economic Committee but it touched<br />
on so many portfolios that it became akin to Cabinet itself.<br />
For that reason, Cabinet as a whole now normally deals with<br />
economic issues.<br />
How to resolve issues involving two Ministers or more,<br />
but not listed for Cabinet, is a matter for the judgement of the<br />
Ministers concerned, or ultimately for the Prime Minister.<br />
Committees are chaired by the Prime Minister or a Minister appointed<br />
by him, and make decisions or refer their conclusions to Cabinet as<br />
appropriate. Some Standing Cabinet Committees are supported<br />
by Committees of relevant permanent heads. They may coopt other<br />
permanent heads and they may work through sub-committees and<br />
task groups.<br />
In addition to the Standing Committees, frequent use is made of<br />
specialist committees embracing Cabinet members or other<br />
Ministers and these are disbanded on reaching a conclusion.<br />
They are often supported by officials drawn from relevant specialist<br />
areas and transact business which would otherwise absorb a<br />
great deal of Cabinet's time. </p>

The increasing load of government business has required us to<br />
make every effort to streamline the decision making processes<br />
of Cabinet, and I believe the comprehensive system of committees<br />
now in operation contributes significantly to our desire<br />
for more efficient government.<br />
THE CABINET AND OFFICIALS<br />
Cabinet does a large part of its business considering formal<br />
written submissions andits decisions are also formalised.<br />
Inevitably an effective Cabinet Secretariat is required.<br />
The system has come a long way since the 1940' s. Before that,<br />
department officials were not used to record the deliberations<br />
of Cainbet. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet<br />
has come to play an important role in advising the<br />
Prime Minister on the programming of the substantial volume<br />
of Cabinet business and on the completeness of subsmissions;<br />
in advising relevant Ministers of those decisions which are<br />
the basis for action; and in following up Cabinet decisions.<br />
Officials from Departments may be invited to attend during<br />
Cabinet or Cabinet Committee meetings to provide on the spot<br />
advice on specific issues, though such attendance is more likely<br />
at meetings of short term committees set up to examine<br />
particular matters.<br />
Officers of Departments also have important functions in the<br />
complex processes of consultation and coordination involved.<br />
In the overall programming of Cabinet business; in the production<br />
of coherent Cabinet papers; and in their subsequent implementation.<br />
I should say that while officials may attend Cabinet to<br />
provide advice covering technical areas or to supply the<br />
Cabinet with factual information, the Cabinet very strictly<br />
conforms to the practice that officials should only be in the<br />
Cabinet room to provide necessary information. Officials<br />
should neither become, not should they be seen to become,<br />
part of the process of debate which is involved in Cabinet<br />
reaching its decisions. In Cabinet the official's role is<br />
to inform, not to debate.<br />
Once the public servants have given the required information, the<br />
normal practice is for them to withdraw from the Cabinet<br />
decision-making process. This is necessary to make quite sure<br />
that they retain their impartiality. </p>
