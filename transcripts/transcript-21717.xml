    <content><![CDATA[<p>On the 25th of April each year we gather across Australia and around the world to honour the first ANZACs and those who have followed their proud example by serving our country in times of conflict.  This year, on the 90th anniversary of the original ANZAC landing, I am honoured to represent Australia at the commemorative services at Gallipoli.</p>
<p>The original ANZACs could not have known at the time that their service would leave all Australians with another enduring legacy: our sense of self.  The ANZAC legend has helped us to define who we are as Australians.  ANZAC Day is a chance to reflect with pride on what it means to be Australian and the values we hold dear: determination, courage, compassion and resourcefulness.</p>
<p>  On this ANZAC Day, Australian servicemen and women will be serving in a range of locations overseas including Solomon Islands, East Timor and Iraq.  These men and women are risking their lives to bring to other nations the same peace and freedom that we enjoy here in Australia.  As we gather to remember the sacrifices made by past generations in previous wars, our thoughts are with our current servicemen and women and their families.</p>
<p>ANZAC Day commemorative services and other observances around the country will ensure that the ANZAC spirit continues to endure in Australia.  I join you in commemorating the sacrifice of the ANZACs and expressing our continuing gratitude for their legacy.</p>
<p>  (John Howard)  </p>
