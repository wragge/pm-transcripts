PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT q 4 MAY 1978 r<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PETER HARVEY<br />
AT FAIRBAIRN , the<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, why the need for/ two Boeing 7271s.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The basic need is on the grounds of<br />
security, that's been very strongly put to me over recent<br />
days. When I first became Prime Minister it was indicated<br />
that it was alright to travel on commercial aircraft so long<br />
as proper precautions were taken. People were much happier<br />
travelling Qantas and other airlines. * Qantas doesn't travel<br />
through every route that one needs to go to and over the last<br />
couple of years there has been an increasing concern for<br />
security and as you know the number of incidents around the<br />
world have been fairly marked. It is not a question of a<br />
Prime Minister's security so much, or I don't think it is, but<br />
also the additional risk which you place on other passengers<br />
who are in an aircraft and that again.' has been expressed<br />
very strongly. Sir Robert Mark had some-elements of this in<br />
his own general report on security. As a result of that, I<br />
asked for technical evaluation again from our own security<br />
people and while much of that can't become public because<br />
its outlining the nature of the threat and what people do, or<br />
could do to put a flight or a person in danger in travel. I<br />
think Mr. Killen has tabled a document which is bringing all<br />
this together and a very hard recommendation that the Government<br />
ought to take some action. Now, you can say aren't there<br />
aircraft? Well the aircraft we are standing beside-is not a<br />
long-range aircraft. It can't travel overseas with any degree<br />
of satisfaction. Its a twin engine aircraft and its single<br />
engine performance is poor to say the best. It was a good<br />
aircraft for what it was originally bought, but it won't do<br />
the longer range job and it hasn't got the inbuilt security<br />
that you need with three engines. I was very reluctant and<br />
always have been very reluctant about this particular matter,<br />
but ultimately I have had to accept that the grounds of security in,<br />
1978 aind beyond are overwhelming. I suppose on two grounds<br />
the safety of a head of government and whatever, whoever, might<br />
be travelling with him, but also to avoid putting at risk<br />
other passengers who travel by normal commercial means on a<br />
normal commercial flight. 000---</p>
