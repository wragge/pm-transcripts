TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH TERRY WILLESEE -4 JUNE 1985<br />
TERRY 17ILLESEE:<br />
Mr. Hiawke thanks for Joining us.<br />
PRIME-MINISTER:<br />
My pleasure Terry.<br />
TERRY 1VILLESEE:<br />
First up, what is the likelihood that the government's proposals<br />
an taxation will becbme fact?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
w~ ell it the nine principles that I laid down in the election<br />
campaign the * ninth one, a very important one, was that we<br />
-would want to see a broad acceptance in the communtnity of our<br />
proposal. Now I believe, Terry, that in the period leading up<br />
to a national summit the majority of Australian people will see<br />
the good sense and benefit f or them of the proposal so I think<br />
we'll get there.<br />
TERRY IIILLESEE:<br />
You would expect heavy argument against the capital gains tax?<br />
Is there any likelihood you could change your mind on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well as regards the whole package the last paragraph of the<br />
White Paper says, Terry, that we want the community to examine<br />
the whole proposal and if we're in a situation where it's clear<br />
that the great majority of the community were against particular<br />
issues we would have to take that into account but I believe<br />
t * hat the community will say that that is a sensibl. e part of a<br />
total package. Can I just make this quick point about the<br />
capital gains tax or two quick points: the personal home,<br />
the private home is not involved; the second thing is that it<br />
is a tax upon real gains, not on nominal gains; and the third-<br />
I'm sorry I said two but the third and most important point<br />
is it's not a great revenue raiser but it is an absolutely<br />
important part, Terry, of the fight against tax avoidance and<br />
evasion.<br />
TERRY WILLESEE:<br />
But on capita] gains. M~ r. Prime Minister, Mr. IKeating told us<br />
prior to the election the governmnent had no plans for a capital<br />
. gains tax. Now post election he tells us he not only has plans<br />
for it but he wants to implement it. Have we been deceived? / 2 </p>
<p>SNo you have not been deceived. We said during the election<br />
campaign that we would prepare a position which vwould be put<br />
to the community as a whole about all the available areas that<br />
ought to be looked at to produce a fairer and simpler and more<br />
economically efficient system. You cannot possibly put before<br />
the community an analysis of the inade-quadies of the existing<br />
system and the areas for reform without talking about capital<br />
gains. TERRY WILLESEE:<br />
Well why were we told there were no plans for capital gains<br />
tax? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Because there were no plans and what we've got now is a<br />
situation where we've put a preferred position to the Australian<br />
community. I repeat that if the community as a whole said<br />
look we don't want that, we would have to take that into account.<br />
But I believe the Australian community will ask itself the<br />
question why is it that Australia uniquely of all the<br />
western countries would say there shouldn't be a capital gains<br />
tax. And I think they will come to the conclusion that it is<br />
fair . that if they, ordinary Mr. and Mrs. Australian, go to<br />
work and by the sweat of their muscles or the exercise of their<br />
brain power they get ' income and are taxed upon it, that there<br />
shouldn't be a discimination against them by there being no<br />
tax upon income which comes to people through no exertion of<br />
themselves. And secondly I'm sure they'll say they want to<br />
wipe out tax avoidance and evasion to the maximum extent and<br />
they will accept that this is a desirable part of that approach.<br />
TERRY WILLESEE:<br />
Well Mr. Hawke taxation new proposals or the current ones<br />
affect everybody to a certain extent. Now you're chauffeur<br />
driven to work and to social functions and to sporting events.<br />
Will your employer be obliged to pay the 46% tax on those<br />
perks. that you get. including, for example, your house?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There'll be no distinctions Terry on the approach that will<br />
apply to us and to people generally. I want to make the point<br />
on every available program that as far as I'm concerned I'm<br />
not looking for preferential treatment and I will ensure that<br />
at the end of this process in regard any benefit that might<br />
come to be available to me in regard to reduction in tax rates<br />
that I won't be seeking to take advantage of that on the<br />
contrary. TERRY WILLESEE:<br />
So you're saying all employers will be treated equally.<br />
But isn't it a bit silly that you as the Prime Minister of this<br />
country aren't entitled to a home in Canberra without your<br />
employer having to be taxed on it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it's not a question of it being silly. I think + he<br />
point that has to be understood Terry is this+-I think when<br />
you examine the paper you'll see the force of this: that fringe<br />
benefits are exploding in Australia, It's calculated that they<br />
go out to treble in something like three years time if nothing<br />
is done about them. Now all that means, Terry, is that the<br />
great bulk of Australians who don't get benefit of the fringe<br />
bip-fi+-ill havp a. rreater burden through time imposed upon I </p>
<p>them if we don't bring them to an end.<br />
TERRY ' WILLESEE:<br />
Well what about those perks the employer who normally provides<br />
them will now be taxed 46% on that. W~ on't he therefore somehow<br />
-have to recover that cost and presumably pass it on through the<br />
product he sells and therefore the consumer is hit again?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There will be a variety of reactions, Terry, from employers.<br />
It won't be anything consistent across the board. Some<br />
employers will sa~ y well we're prepared to absorb, others will<br />
say well we'll convert that sort of benefit to a cash payment<br />
and to the employees because of the very substantial reductions<br />
in marginal rates you'll get a benefit from that, and others<br />
may say well we won't go ahead with that particular benief it.<br />
There'll be a variety of reactions but I simply say that I<br />
believe that the Australian community when they look at the<br />
facts. see how this is exploding as an area of non-payment of<br />
tax, will say well we believe in the general interest of the<br />
community something needs to be done about it. But that's djust<br />
another area, Terry, where I want the Australian community to<br />
look at this issue as a package, There, of course, in any<br />
packag~ e will be elements of it which some people won't like.<br />
lhat ' is important Terry is that people as a whole look at this<br />
tax system that we've got., see that it's disintegrating and<br />
disintegrating in way which is imposing with each passing<br />
month a greater burden on ordinary Mr. and Mrs. Australia.<br />
Now wie've got to bring an end to that in the process if<br />
Aa:: atotal package we can produce a fairer, 4a more efficient<br />
system I think that's what Australia will want.<br />
TERRY WILLESEE:<br />
Well Mr. Hiawke the assets test, it was sold badly and in fact<br />
it had to be re-assessed. How bard will you be working to<br />
sell the tax proposal and are you sure you got it right?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'll be working very hard with Mr. Keating and others of my<br />
colleagues. We are not seeking to impose somthing. As I said<br />
the ninth principle that we laid down was that the community<br />
has got to be broadly satisfied. I wvant to make this point,<br />
Terry, that as of today 40%, or its 39% 40% of all Australians<br />
who are in full time employment are now at the point where of every<br />
dollar they earn at the margin they are paying 46 0. In other<br />
words half of every dollar is being taxed. Now that's no good.<br />
' We've got to get. A situation where the direct tax on people is<br />
very substantially reduced. Now you can only do that by<br />
comprebensive reform and I think people will want to see that<br />
happen because your., vd~ ewers, Terry, don't wiant a situation<br />
where half the their extra dollar that they earn is going in<br />
* tax and they are right in not wanting that.<br />
TERRY VIILLESEE:<br />
Mr. Hawke, thank you very much indeed for your time.<br />
PRIME MINISTE~ R:<br />
Terry, thank you very much. </p>
