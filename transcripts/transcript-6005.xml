WATER RESOURCE DEVELOPMENTS SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br />
South Australia stands to benefit substantially from the<br />
$ 640 m. Bicentennial water resources programme announced<br />
last Tuesday. The Government is acutely aware of South<br />
Australia's dependence on the Murray and deeply<br />
concerned about the effects of high salinity levels in<br />
South Australia.<br />
The Bicentennial Programme will be particularly<br />
important in helping to give South Australia better<br />
quality Murray water.<br />
Subject to discussion with the States, the Commonwealth<br />
will provide funding to raise the level of the existing<br />
weir at Euston to increase storage capacity and improve<br />
the regulation of water release from the Hume and<br />
Dartmouth dams. We will also increase the storage<br />
capacity of the Menindee Lakes.<br />
These measures will have a very positive effect on<br />
maintaining a sufficient flow of water down the Murray<br />
to South Australia and at the same time they will<br />
improve the quality of Murray water in South Australia.<br />
The Commonwealth will also provide further assistance<br />
for the Adelaide and northern towns filtration schemes.<br />
Building on the $ 15 m. already spent by the<br />
Commcnwealth, this further assistance will increase<br />
substantially the number of pe-ople receiving better<br />
quality River Murray water for domestic purposes. </p>

In addition, the extended National Water Resources<br />
Program will include the completion of flood mitigation<br />
works on the Torrens river providing protection from<br />
floods for about 5,000 homes and 500 commercial<br />
buildings. These measures are additional to the special grant of<br />
million for upgrading water supplies which South<br />
Australia received in the 19S2/ 83 Budget.<br />
The Bicentennial program also includes feasability<br />
studies of a number of far sighted and imaginative water<br />
developncnts. Of particular importance to South<br />
Australia, is the comprehensive engineering,-economic<br />
and environmental study of a new upper Murray dam. Such<br />
a dam would augment water supplies in the River Murray<br />
system, greatly to the benefit of South Australia.<br />
It is worth noting that if it hadn't been for the<br />
construction of the Dartmouth Dam many South Australians<br />
dependent on the Murray System would be enduring severe<br />
water restrictions today.<br />
Adequate quantities of water of sufficiently high<br />
quality is vital to the future development of South<br />
Australia. The Bicentennial Programme will help<br />
substantially improve both quantity and quality and<br />
thereby provie greater long term development<br />
opportunities for the State. oo000ooo---<br />
