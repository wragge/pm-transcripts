PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA. THURSDAY, JULY 16 1981<br />
BUDGET ALLEGATION'<br />
I repudiate entirely the irresponsible comments on the<br />
A. B. C. last night concerning the leaking of last year's<br />
Budget. The report stating that I was perhaps myself responsible<br />
for providing a reporter with advance information on the Budget<br />
was completely false and scurrilous.<br />
The very sam~ e report carried its own refutation in a statement<br />
from the Treasurer that the Budget " leak" could have only come<br />
from his _ own of fice, theTreasury o-he.. Government printer.<br />
The report further recognised that the reporter who received<br />
the Budget information had said he had not disclosed toanybody<br />
the source of the Budget story.<br />
The broadcaster's comments were seemingly designed to give<br />
credence to groundless rumours.<br />
Actions of this kind are a disservice to professional<br />
journalism and to the reputation of the A. B. C.<br />
