ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER. THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
NEW AUSTRALIAN CUISINE LAUNCH<br />
THURSDAY 25 MAY 1995<br />
It is a great pleasure to be here, among Australian and Japanese friends. to<br />
sample a truly unique culinary feast.<br />
The ' New Australian Cuisine' campaign reflects a number of important<br />
elements in the modem Australia-Japan relationship.<br />
At one level it is about contemporary Australian taste. At another it is about<br />
our largest manufacturing industry.<br />
In a sense, food is a touchstone of the change in Australia not abandoning<br />
traditional culture or traditional industries, but modifying them. adapting them,<br />
adding value to them.<br />
The change in taste and style is increasingly towards the cultures of our<br />
region Thai, Chinese, Malaysian, and of course Japanese.<br />
Neil Perry who has prepared this selection today is one of a number of<br />
leading Australian chefs who blend a Japanese influence into Australian<br />
food. And food or food processing is Australia's largest manufacturing industry.<br />
It will get larger we expect it to treble its exports by the year 2000.<br />
Japan is a priority market and one of the key investors in the industry.<br />
In 1993, 70 per cent of Japan's overseas investment in food processing went<br />
to Australia.<br />
For Australia's part, we are the third largest supplier of foodstuffs to Japan,<br />
and exorts are growing at a rate of 10.5 per cent.<br />
Australia is Japan's largest supplier of dairy products. We supply one fifth of<br />
Japan's imports of beef. </p>
<p>Food is the fastest growing area of our trade with Japan and as I said earlier<br />
today the potential is there to dramatically enlarge it<br />
Australi3n food is the product of a clean environmcnt. It is fresh and pure, it<br />
grows inth e Japanese off-season and it is eminently suitable for use in<br />
traditional Japanese cuisine.<br />
Because Australia is one of the most efficient agriculture producers in the<br />
world, Australian food is also cheap. And so, I might add, is the wine. And<br />
the wine is as good as the food which is to say as good as any to be got. Al<br />
These days we export less dried, canned and frozen food products and more 01<br />
fresh, clean and live like abalone. lobsters and salmon and asparagus et01<br />
margoes. Among the processed foods we export are Australian-maae T<br />
noodles like soba, udon and kamaboko.<br />
We see enormous potential in the Australian food growing and food<br />
processing industry, and the trade with Japan at once provides the greatest<br />
opportunity and the best measure of suc<br />
Food of course. is not just about trode dollars it is also a cultural exchange,<br />
It is a means, perhaps the best means of getting to know each other.<br />
Maybe even getting to know ourselves: " No man is lonely eating a bowl of<br />
spaghetti", Robert Morley once said. I have the same sense of communion<br />
with a plate of seahimi.<br />
This campaign we are launching tonight is a perfect illustration of the cultural<br />
dimensions of food.<br />
Let me welcome the six Japanese food writers who are heading off on a<br />
gourmet tour of Australia. I wish you a very enjoyablo and productive visit<br />
as I do the Japanese chefs, representatives of cooking schools and other<br />
food industry leaders who will follow the food writers.<br />
Once again, let me say thank you to Nail Perry for coming to Japan and<br />
preparing this food tonight<br />
And thank you also Mr Toyosnima, Chairman of JETRO for his participation<br />
in this launch and the opening of the Australia Business Centre.<br />
WA greatly appreciat JETRO's support<br />
Now It Is my pleasure to launchi m New Australlan Cuisine campaign 6587? 6588 </p>
