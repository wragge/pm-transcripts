the ' Last elecrion. I will be looking to the Committee for advice on Australia's<br />
energy reserves and on factors likely to influence the pattern of<br />
energ-y suppDly and demand, and future costs, in Australia; the<br />
assessment of and develenn-oent of our energy resources, and the economy<br />
of use of energy. The Commnittee also will offer advice on the balance of<br />
resources for research relating to the development of energy sources<br />
in Australia, and on developments both here and overseas in respect of<br />
methods and technology associated with the production and distribution<br />
of energy. The development of a natiOnal energy policy is a matter<br />
for detCailed an-. d enxq-; ert analysis.<br />
Vie must consider the present and potential contributions<br />

of tovarious sectors of industry and of the private cons'Umer.<br />

<p>SThe Cn. rr-. c I he Comrmittee is Dr Howard Wcrr. er,<br />
Se:.-.. ourwne, who is aso the Chairman of the Victorian Brown Coal<br />
rc?. and bov-: oi 2 nt Co.-' ittee<br />
Dr Worner is an eminent scientist who has had a long<br />
I:' singuished career in Australian industry.<br />
j am sure that under his leadership the Committee, which<br />
i-a outstanding group of people, will make an invaluable contribution<br />
r. : iis imn catint. area of Government policy.<br />
The Committee itself will consist of eighteen members<br />
:: ho have been selected with a view to covering a wide spectrum of<br />
':-: pertise in the energy field, and appointed on the basis of the<br />
S, 2ersonal contribution which they can make to the work of the Committee,<br />
as distinct from any representational role they might perform.<br />
I will look to the Committee to assess and recommend on<br />
::. jor matters of energy policy that will come before me in the future.<br />
In performing this role, I will expect the Committee to<br />
act as a link between the Federal Government and all bodies working<br />
Sin the energy field State Government departments and authorities,<br />
private companies, university research workers, learned societies<br />
and the like. As well as assisting the Government through its advice<br />
rn energy matters, I am sure the Committee will play a valuable role<br />
in tcimulating pulic awareness and debate on energy issues, including<br />
" he need1 fno energy conservation.<br />
In this way, investment decisions by industry and Government<br />
a.: thorities, both State and Commonwealth, can be based on better<br />
: rrnation; consumers, both large and small, will be better able to<br />
for the future, and Australia will be able to m. ake better use<br />
i' energy resources. / 3 </p>

Because tne -sablish. ent of the Committee recresents<br />
a ncr: undertaking, I ave aointed it as interim Cormittee<br />
i. first ins. ance, -o operate until the end of calendar year 1977.<br />
I will ask the Committee to report to m. e by the end of<br />
