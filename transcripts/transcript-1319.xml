FOR PRESS P. M. No. 44/ 1966<br />
COMMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. HAROLD HOLT ON<br />
STATEM. ENT BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION, MR.<br />
CALWE-LL<br />
The widely-reported statement attributed to the<br />
Federal Opposition Leader that Australian National Servicemen<br />
in Viet Nam apparently are being kept out of the most dangerous<br />
battle areas until after the Federal elections is a typical<br />
piece of Calwell fiction, utterly without foundation,<br />
recklessly made, mischievous in its effects and offensive in<br />
its implications.<br />
