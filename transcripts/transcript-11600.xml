<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good evening.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Hello. Can we just get your reaction to the Blue Mountains decision.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm delighted. As somebody who spent a lot of time in his childhood holidaying there it is a great Australian environment icon and this is world recognition. It's a great part of the world and I have great affection for it. It's got some nice golf courses, got some beautiful walks, even more importantly and I think it's a great decision.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What does it mean for the area?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think it just confirms its traditional historic role as a great place for holidaying, for walks and it's a beautiful repository of a wonderful part of our environment.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Just in relation to Question Time today as well, does Cheryl Kernot have some questions to answer in relation to these Queensland rorts?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh I think this is something Mr Beazley's got to deal with.</p>
