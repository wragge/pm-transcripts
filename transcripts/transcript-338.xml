COMMON MARKET<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
Mr. Duncan Sandys, Secretary of State for Commonwealth<br />
Relations, will arrive in Australia from New Zealand on July 6.<br />
The United Kingdom Government has informed the<br />
Australian Government that he would like to discuss with us<br />
various aspects of the European Common Market and the particular<br />
questions which would arise should the United Kingdom seek to<br />
join the Common Market.<br />
These problems have been the subject of occasional<br />
reference over the last two years. We have beon assured of full<br />
consultation before any decisions are taken. But, we have not<br />
had any specific views or proposals put to us. The moeeting with<br />
14r. Sandys will therefore give my colleagues and myself our first<br />
opportunity of hearing the views of the United Kingdom<br />
Government expressed with authority and in reasonable detail.<br />
There have been in the last few weeks meetings between<br />
officials. I suggested these when I was last in London at the<br />
time of the Prime Ministers' Conference. But although there have<br />
been quite a few discussions on the official level, it must be<br />
made clear that the problems have not been solved and that the<br />
outlines of practical proposals have not yct omerged.<br />
It will at once be seen that there are two aspects of<br />
the problem one is economic; the other is political. On the<br />
economic side, we have a large and legitimate interest in<br />
protecting the entry of our goods, particularly our agricultural<br />
products, into the markets of Great Britain. Should Great<br />
Britain obtain entrance to the Common Market without preserving<br />
Commonwealth preferences, the effects upon our trade would be<br />
extremely severe, heth,, r the European nations in the Common<br />
Market would be prepared to admit Great Britain to membership<br />
with reservations preserving her Commonwealth arrangements is an<br />
important question upon which we hope that Mr. Sandys will be<br />
able to throw some light.<br />
The political problems are also extremely important.<br />
The whole Common Market arrangements point in the direction of<br />
closer political association and even unity in Wester'n Europe. A<br />
Great Britain which acquired organic political relationships or<br />
obligations in Europe would I should imagine, find her normal<br />
Commonwealth political relationships profoundly affected. These<br />
are all matters upon which we will be anxious to receive the<br />
carefully analysed views which Mr. Sandys will no doubt be able<br />
to put to us.<br />
CANBERRA 3rd July, 1961. </p>
