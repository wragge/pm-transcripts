COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
Rt. Hon. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />
M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION AND<br />
DISARIMAMENT,<br />
[ From the " Parliamentary Debates," 22nd October 1964.]<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIFS ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister) [ 8.311.-Mr. Speaker, we<br />
have just heard a pathetic speech.<br />
Opposition Members.-Oh.<br />
'-' Sfr ROBERT MENZIES.-Yes. I repeat<br />
_ C at it was a pathetic speech. The question<br />
before the Chair, though we may not realise<br />
it from what was said, concerns a papera<br />
ministerial statement in relation to this<br />
o-called peace Congress. I would have<br />
jpected that the spokesman for the Opposition,<br />
first, would have explained to us why<br />
be believed in the Congress and, secondly,<br />
would have told us that he would attend it,<br />
and why. But, instead of that, we have heard<br />
a speech that was a rambling affair. I recall<br />
an old judge once telling an advocate in my<br />
presence that he had circumnavigated the<br />
entire globe of irrelevancy. If ever anybody<br />
did that, the honorable member for<br />
Werriwa ( Mr. Whitlam), speaking as Deputy<br />
Leader of the Opposition, did it this evening.<br />
He circumnavigated the entire globe of<br />
irrelevancy. Here, we are dealing with -a<br />
conference and a very serious problem concerning<br />
the question of whether this is a<br />
Comramunist front-which it is, beyond<br />
question. But did the honorable member<br />
address himself * to that matter? No. He<br />
13895/ 64. went on a little voyage of discovery. He<br />
talked about the Voyager disaster. He<br />
talked about Ansett. He talked about homes.<br />
He talked about overseas investment. He<br />
even brought into the discussion Sir Walter<br />
Murdoch, a most distinguished scholar who<br />
has been honoured by Her Majesty, not for<br />
* his political views, but for his great distinr_-<br />
tion in the world of literature. Really, the<br />
Deputy Leader of the Opposition is pretty<br />
hard put to it, is he not, when be has to<br />
come to this? He even told us who somebody's<br />
uncle was. I have had a few uncles<br />
myself whom I have liked. But there may<br />
be nephews of mine who would not want<br />
me dragged up on the occasion of some<br />
debate in the future. The honorable gentleman<br />
is hard put to it in this debate.<br />
Oddly enough, in the midst of all this, he<br />
has been devoting his attention to the somewhat<br />
anaemnic labour of reading the<br />
" Anglican which, may I tell you, is not<br />
the official organ of the Church of England.<br />
I happen to know that because, after it had<br />
published a few foul and defamatory remarks<br />
about me, I wrote to the then Synod<br />
of the Church and asked: " Is this your<br />
official organ? I was hastily assured that<br />
it was not. The last time I heard of the<br />
publisher of the. Anglican he-was in a </p>
<p>little trouble over an obscene publication,<br />
as honorable members will recall. The<br />
Deputy Leader of the Opposition, being<br />
frightfully anxious to avoid coming to the<br />
point, has been reading the " Anglican<br />
If he can find a Presbyterian who is a little<br />
pink, he quotes him. That is easy enough.<br />
I know quite a few of them myself. If he<br />
can find a Methodist, he quotes him. He<br />
ran over the landscape' and picked up a<br />
bishop or two, but never, ' from first to last,<br />
did he face up to the problem that once<br />
exercised his Party-the problem of whether<br />
this Congress is a Communist front. In spite<br />
of the most engaging invitations by some<br />
of my friends on this side of the House,<br />
he failed to say whether he would attend<br />
the Congress. I am prepared to lay a slight<br />
shade of odds within the limits of my<br />
purse-Mr. Hayden.-Oh.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-Within the<br />
limits of the honorable" iimeber's purse, if<br />
he likes. Let me put it that way. That puts<br />
it a little higher. I am prepared to lay a<br />
slight shade of odds that the Deputy Leader<br />
of the Opposition will not be at the Congress,<br />
because he will realise that selfpreservation''<br />
is the fist laii" of life. That<br />
is how the matter stands, Sir. He tried to<br />
make something out of the Pairiarch of<br />
Moscow. But he made such an awful blue<br />
there. He put questions in the House asking<br />
whethe"' the' Ptriarch" of Moscow-the<br />
guest of the Archbishop of Canterburyhad<br />
been refused a visa, or something of<br />
the sort. It turned out that he vas not<br />
speaking of the ' right fellow. But" that is<br />
nothing to the honorable gentfeman. The<br />
facts come easily and depart easily on his<br />
tongue. He took up about 30 minutes of<br />
the time of the House without thinking fit<br />
to come to the point of'this matter. I<br />
want to come to the point of'it, Sir.<br />
The Attorney-General ( Mr. Snedden)<br />
made a statement on this subject, and it is<br />
on the motion that that ' stateient be noted<br />
that this debate occurs, though nobody<br />
would have imagined it after listening to<br />
the speech just made by th~ Deputy Leader<br />
of the Opposition. After the Attorney-<br />
General had made his statement in this<br />
House, the organisers of; this beautifully<br />
polite, kindly iitentioned non-Communist<br />
Congress weie so shaken by ' whai" he ' had said that they advertised denying that the<br />
Congress was a continuation of a similar<br />
congress held in Melbourne in 1959. I do<br />
not remember most honorable members<br />
opposite, or even the honorable member for<br />
Werriwa, being at the conference of 1959.<br />
Although that conference had been practically<br />
conceded to be a Communist front,<br />
it was essential for the organisers of the<br />
present Congress to get away from that<br />
sort of thing. So they advertised, in a certain<br />
newspaper which I shall not advertise, denying<br />
that the Congress was a continuationof<br />
a similar congress held in Melbourne in<br />
1959. But, at the very moment when the<br />
Attorney-General was making his statement<br />
in this chamber, a brochure was in circula-t<br />
tion on behalf of the Congress. It stated-<br />
In 1959, there was held in Melbourne thr-'\<br />
Australian and New Zealand Congress for Inter<br />
national Co-operation and Disarmament. Following<br />
this Congress, State continuing committees<br />
were formed to carry on its work. In February<br />
1964, representatives of these committees decdded<br />
to'convene a panel of citizens to form a provisional<br />
sponsoring committee to begin preliminary<br />
planning for a national congress in October 1964.<br />
That Congress begins in a few days.<br />
Can anybody seriously believe that it is<br />
not the legitimate child of the<br />
1959 conference? Yet the organisers<br />
of the present Congress advertised<br />
that it " was not connected with the<br />
World Peace Council or any other organis*'<br />
tion either inside or outside Australia'<br />
They expressly denied that the Congress<br />
was a continuation of a similar Congress<br />
held in Melbourne in 1959. Yet I have just<br />
quoted the words of their committee, which<br />
demonstrate that that was simply a fat 1I<br />
On 18th August, before the statement<br />
was made, Congress News Bulletin No. 3<br />
was published. It contained a series of<br />
items which should be discussed at the<br />
Congress. After the statement by the<br />
Attorney-General, two of the items were<br />
omitted. They were the North West base<br />
and an independent foreign policy for<br />
Australia. This latter item was designed<br />
to get Australia, in the interests of peace,<br />
to abandon all its alliances with the United<br />
States, Great Britain and other countries.<br />
Sir, I can only assume that these items<br />
were so clearly related to Communist policy<br />
and unrelated to peace, as we understand<br />
peace, that the organisers felt that to have<br />
them discussed would rather reveal the<br />
true' nature of the Congress. I do ' not need </p>
<p>to labour this matter. Nobody with his<br />
ordinary wits fails to understand that this<br />
is a Communist-front organisation. Indeed,<br />
the honorable gentleman does not deny it.<br />
He merely quotes a number of people as<br />
giving respectability to a Communist-front<br />
organisation, forgetting that the whole purpose<br />
of Communist-front organisations is<br />
to get eminent and respectable people to<br />
lend an air of respectability to a conference<br />
that otherwise would be exposed as a<br />
Communist activity.<br />
SWhy do these Communist-front organisa-<br />
Jtions exist? The first reason that I can<br />
think of is that these people want to make<br />
Communists and Communism respectable.<br />
SNothing makes a person so respectable as<br />
to be seen in company with a bishop. That<br />
\ is a very interesting feature of life. There-<br />
_ fore, they get a bishop if they can. Nothing<br />
makes a person much more respectable<br />
than to be in the company of a Presbyterian<br />
clergyman. This appeals to me<br />
very much. I know two or three of thenm.<br />
I do not wonder that they are in this business.<br />
The first purpose of these organisations<br />
-is to make Communists and Communism<br />
respectable. The second purpose is<br />
to weaken the will of free people to resist.<br />
This is tremendously important. Why do<br />
they have a conference in Australia instead<br />
-af in Moscow?<br />
Mr. Pollard.-You are not crediting the<br />
people with' inuch common sense.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-If you do<br />
not mind, Reggie old boy; you are like me,<br />
" decent Presbyterian in your spare time.<br />
3 behave yourself.<br />
The second purpose of these organisations<br />
is to weaken the will of free people to resist.<br />
Why must these conferences be held in Australia?<br />
This is a vital question. If these<br />
people want to pass resolutions and explain<br />
to others the vital importance of peace, the<br />
abandonment of threats and the abandonment<br />
of aggression, why do they not operate<br />
in one of the Communist countries? Instead<br />
of doing so, they come here and bring some<br />
of their respectable sponsors here. Why do<br />
they do this? To tell the Australian Parliament<br />
not to be aggressive? To tell the Australian<br />
Parliament or Government not to<br />
lay covetous eyes on other' people's possessions,<br />
other people's lafds or other people's<br />
freedoms? ' Cani' nybody with a grain of common sense suppose that any government,<br />
any party or any parliament ini Australia<br />
needs to be persuaded that we want<br />
peace and we are against aggression? We do<br />
not need to be told about peace by these<br />
people. Some others in the world do, but<br />
these people never tell them.<br />
One of the objects of these conferences<br />
is to divide the free world. I have not the.<br />
time to do it, but if honorable members<br />
will look at some of the items that are to<br />
be discussed and have been discussed in the<br />
past at these conferences they will find that<br />
more is said in the resolutions and the<br />
debates against America than against the<br />
Soviet Union or Communist China. There<br />
is more cackle about American imperialism<br />
than there is about the sinister imperialism<br />
of the Communist world. But of course these<br />
people like to talk about American imperialism.<br />
They would have us believe-we<br />
have heard evidence of this in the last few<br />
days-that a great contribution to peace in<br />
the world would be made if the United<br />
States of America were to abandon South<br />
Vietnam, the South East Asia Treaty<br />
Organisation, its bases in the Pacific and,<br />
iricidentally, Australia. I will defy anybody<br />
to find a single word spoken by any of these<br />
people -that support A. N. Z. U. S.<br />
or the great liberal, free activities of the<br />
United States on behalf of free people all<br />
round the world. Not a word is spoken by<br />
them against the Soviet Union or Communist<br />
China. Mr. Stokes.-The North West Oape was<br />
on the agenda.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-Yes, but they<br />
have left that out for reasons that my<br />
honorable friend perceives in a flash. One<br />
of the purposes of these oonferences is to.<br />
promote nuclear disarmament. Nobody can<br />
deny that; it is all perfectly clear. It is on<br />
the record. We are all in favour of disarmament,<br />
but we are not such fools as toabandon<br />
the freedom of the free world by<br />
saying: " Abolish nuclear armaments but<br />
leave all conventional armaments untouched<br />
To do so, of course, would be to<br />
put the world in the hands of the Communist<br />
powers.<br />
Another purpose of these conferences is<br />
to discourage military alliance against Communist<br />
aggression. " Military alliance" is a<br />
rude expression. Really, are we to accept </p>
<p>this? I knew that I am discussing something<br />
that the honorable member for Werriwa<br />
did not care to discuss. I happen to be discussing<br />
the motion before the Chair. I want<br />
to make it quite clear on behalf of my<br />
Government that we are not in favour of<br />
persuading or driving the United States out<br />
of Vietnam and the western Pacific. But the<br />
active sponsors, the real organisers, the Communist<br />
promoters of this Congress are. We<br />
are not in favour of destroying Malaysia and<br />
removing the British bases from Malaya and<br />
Singapore. Where do the members of this Congress<br />
stand? Heaven knows, they have had three,<br />
four or five of these Congresses. The previous<br />
one was held in 1960 in Yokohama. I<br />
regret to observe that my friend, the honorable<br />
member for Reid ( Mr. Uren), was<br />
amongst the delegates present on that<br />
occasion. I hope he has been misrepresented,<br />
but according to the report a unanimous<br />
resolution was carried attacking S. E. A. T. O.,<br />
attacking Cento, which concerns us very<br />
much in. the Middle East, and attacking<br />
other military alliances organised by<br />
imperialist powers". I ask the honorable<br />
members to note the last words. Imperialist<br />
powers? I suppose that is a fine phrase to<br />
describe a very great power like the United<br />
States, a great power like the United Kingdom<br />
or a small power like Australia! We<br />
are all members of these treaty organizations.<br />
In Japan in 1960, since when, of<br />
course, they have suffered a sea change<br />
into something rich and strange, they were<br />
attacking all these things.<br />
May I just say, because time is not unlimited-<br />
I am grateful to the House for having<br />
given me as much as it has given methat<br />
in March 1951, which after all was<br />
after this Government came into office, the<br />
Federal Executive of the Australian Labour<br />
Psrty made a pronouncement. I shall quote<br />
its precise words. The Labour Party was a<br />
little more given to precision in those days<br />
than it is now. The Federal Executive said-<br />
We further denounce so-called peace councils<br />
as instruments of Soviet imperialism, and we<br />
warn members of the Australian Labour movement<br />
against being involved with appeals of<br />
organisations which exploit the dsire for peace<br />
in the interests of Russian plans.<br />
Those words, my honorable friend would<br />
agree, are fighting words. There is nothing<br />
ambiguous about them. They say, in effect: " Don't you be misled; don't do anything<br />
about this." Indeed, the Federal Executive<br />
went on to underline that expression in<br />
1951 by stating that it further declared-<br />
That this Federal Executive, being of the opinion<br />
that the Australian Peace Council is a subsidiary<br />
organisation to the Communist Party, we therefore<br />
declare that it is not competent for any member<br />
of the A. L. P. to be associated therewith and<br />
remain a member of the<br />
Those were the good old days of 1951 when<br />
the executive said: " Don't you go; if you<br />
go, you are out of the party." Does anybody<br />
-1 look at honorable members oppositeseriously<br />
want to tell me that these congresses<br />
have changed, that the congress of<br />
1964 is utterly unlike the one of 1959 or<br />
is utterly unlike the one that was considered<br />
and adjudged in 1951? Nobody believes that.<br />
If honorable members look at the names,<br />
and in particular the ecclesiastical names, of<br />
some of the people connected with the congress<br />
then and connected with this one<br />
now, they will find exactly the same set-up.<br />
I sympathise with a member of the<br />
Labour Party in this Parliament who is just<br />
as good a non-Communist as I am but who<br />
finds himself put in this ambiguous position.<br />
It is an ambiguous position. His own party<br />
has said: Have nothing to do with it or<br />
you are out of the party"; but now, i<br />
1964, it says through the present leader,<br />
that the A. L. P. in New South Wales-there<br />
seems to be a rather limited exemption given<br />
on this occasion-the A. L. P. in New South<br />
Wales--whioh, I -believe, was regarded, or.<br />
professed itself to be, as right wing un<br />
it endorsed Mr. Leslie Haylen as a candidate<br />
in the Senate election, when it abandoned<br />
its pretence-has decided that it will not be<br />
officially represented. but that individuals<br />
are permitted to participate. If there was<br />
anything funny about this it would be the<br />
funniest statement in the world-to say tothe<br />
in the greatest State in Australia:<br />
" You are not to be officially represented.<br />
Whatever you do is to be unofficial. If any<br />
of your boys go, they must go unofficially.<br />
They must even conceal the fact"-no<br />
doubt-" that they are members of the<br />
party What is this humbug?<br />
What is the position of a party which<br />
says, in the largest State in Australia:<br />
" Now look, we cannot officially be connected<br />
with this thing, but unofficially we-</p>
<p>don't mind if you nip in the side door"<br />
It is almost incredible.<br />
Mr. Clyde Cameron.-It sounds like<br />
Bolte to me.<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-I know that<br />
the honorable member has succeeded for<br />
a long time in being both official and unofficial<br />
at the same time, being a rebel and<br />
being one of the Establishment at the<br />
same time. I envy him this. This argues his<br />
great talent. But it does not detract from<br />
the point that I am making, looking at my<br />
friend, the honorable member for Banks<br />
( Mr. Costa) and the rest of you. How can<br />
' you be officially out and unofficially in?<br />
That is the position -that the Labour Party<br />
has got itself into.<br />
I conclude by saying that all of us in<br />
this Parliament-I say this with no reservations<br />
whatever-all of us want peace.<br />
None of us believes in an aggressive policy.<br />
We are, indeed, foundation members of the<br />
nuclear test ban treaty. Nothing could suit<br />
a developing country like Australia more<br />
than total disarmament, honestly<br />
effectuated. Does any honorable member<br />
ppposite seriously suggest that there ought<br />
, to be unilateral disarmament in this world?<br />
Of course not. Therefore, what we are<br />
after-all of us-is ultimate disarmament,<br />
honestly effectuated, so -that nobody is left<br />
with the power to crush another. But, those<br />
' ieing our objectives, I come back to where<br />
Afound myself a little while ago. Why<br />
have this conference? To persuade us of<br />
things of which we are among the world's<br />
greatest advocates? To persuade us? Of<br />
course not. These conferences do not direct<br />
themselves to the Communist powers; they<br />
direct themselves to us. Therefore, it is<br />
proper to say to them and to their unofficial<br />
friends and sponsors: What changes of<br />
policy do you seek in Australia? I do not want to have a lot of fustian<br />
here about wanting to get rid of the present<br />
Government, because honorable members<br />
have had that feeling-very properly, -if I<br />
may say so-for the last 15 years. I do<br />
not want a fustian of that kind. What<br />
changes of national policy do you want,<br />
you unofficial supporters of this congress,<br />
without seeking such changes, apparently,<br />
in either the Soviet Union or in China.<br />
You do not want a reduced defence vote.<br />
The speeches I have -heard recently indicate<br />
the contrary. Do you want a withdrawal<br />
from the South East Asian Treaty<br />
Organisation? Of course you do not. You<br />
would not dare to say you did. Do you<br />
want the abandonment of South Vietnam?<br />
If you do, which would make each of you<br />
more than an unofficial member of the<br />
Congress, pray get up and say so. Do you<br />
want the abandonment of Malaysia? Do<br />
you want a withdrawal from A. N. Z. U. S.?<br />
Sir, I could go on over the whole line<br />
of what I have believed to be indisputable<br />
national policies in Australia, and I doubt<br />
whether I could get more than one, two or<br />
three people on the other side of the<br />
House who would say about abandoning<br />
them: Yes, this is what we want to do<br />
Yet, these being -the objectives of this conference,<br />
we have reached a stage at which<br />
the Australian Labour Party, divided but<br />
still powerful, says to its members: Now,<br />
you cannot officially attend, but if you care<br />
to. go along and lend the benefit of your<br />
presence to this conference that will be all<br />
right with us Sir, it would be a tragedy<br />
if well-intentioned people-many people on<br />
the list of sponsors are well-intentionedwere<br />
beguiled into believing that those<br />
who are, as we in this place are, the practical<br />
friends of peace are in reality its<br />
enemies. The choice remains as it has stood<br />
for years: We can have either the peace of<br />
defended freedom or the peace of<br />
submission.<br />
