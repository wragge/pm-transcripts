AUSTRALIA' S INFLATION RATE<br />
The Prime Minister, Ur Fraser, said today he had receivedI<br />
official information which forecast that Australia during 1976<br />
will suffer the second highest rate of inflatI.-on amongst the<br />
major western nations.<br />
Mr Fraser said the forecast indicated that Australia's rate of'<br />
inflation during next year would be at a level more than three<br />

The Prime Minister stressed that because the information relating<br />
to forecasts of the level of inflation in other countries was<br />
confidential to OECD nations no statistical details could be given<br />
at this stage.<br />
. He expected that statistical' information would be released in<br />
mid-December.<br />
In the case of Australia, however, the forecast was highly relevant<br />
to the state of the Australian economy at the present time.<br />
He said the forecast confirmed his statement in an address to the<br />
nation eight days ago that the factors of the budget deficit,<br />
declining investment, slower than expected growth and low confidence<br />
all meant that next year Australia would be facing more inflation<br />
and the highest unemployment since the great depression. / 2 </p>

It was further confirmation that under Labor's policies the<br />
Seconomy is not coming out of its recession-.<br />
The Prime Minister reiterated that in fulfilling Its pledge to<br />
provide Australia with sound management until the election, the<br />
Caretaker Goverrnent had given special emphasis to its duty to be<br />
fully informed on the state of the economy and its future outlook.<br />
The unpleasant facts that had come to light showed that, as a result<br />
of past policies, Australia would face very severe problems of<br />
economi~ c management in 1976.<br />
These facts included the liklihood that the budget deficit will not<br />
be $ 2,800 million as planned but about $ 4,000 million. As well,<br />
the rate of price increase in the December quarter would be-about0<br />
per cent -one of the highest rates in the western world.<br />
Mr Fraser said the new forecast of 1976 inflation in Australia<br />
together with recent official statistics on the food price index<br />
and industrial production further supported these facts.<br />
They were further evidence of the extev-t of the damage caused by<br />
the incompetence of the former Labor government and the de gree<br />
of failure of its economic policies.<br />
It was essential as a first step'to prosperity that Australians 0<br />
be honest with themselves about what has happened in the past three<br />
years and to recognise the immensely tough problems that could be<br />
solved, if we are prepared to work together as a people. 0<br />
The principal objective of the incoming Liberal National Country<br />
Party Governmen b, would be to revive the basic health and strength<br />
of the-Australian economy so that Australians could once again<br />
* look ahead with. confidence and security confidence in themselves<br />
and in their country.<br />
This would be achieved through a full three-year programme to get<br />
Australia moving ahead, combining the taxation reforms recommended<br />
by the Math ews Committee together with the further policies which<br />
will be announced in -the Policy Speech on Thursday night. </p>
<p>Mr Fraser said these policies would provide a sound basis for<br />
the rapid rec , viry f Mnia ce d fTb7<br />
between all sections of the community for restraint in government<br />
spending. </p>
