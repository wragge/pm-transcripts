PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE SCULLIN BY-ELECTION<br />
19 January, 1986<br />
E&amp; 0OE -PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Bill Hartley to the Scullin electorate.<br />
PM: I have got nothing to say about that issue. As you know<br />
that will be considered by the National Executive on Thursday.<br />
It is not appropriate to talk about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, considering your calling the Liberals<br />
faction-ridden, don't you think that is slight the situation with<br />
ALP at the moment, over Scullin in particular?<br />
PM: No. The question of various groupinigs within parties has<br />
has always been there as far as Labor is concerned and as far as<br />
the others are concerned. What I am talking about is the way in<br />
which factions are operating. AS far as the Labor Party is<br />
concerned, the existence of different groups with different<br />
emphases has not affected the development of policy and the<br />
implementation of policy. As I said here, this is the most<br />
stable and competent government in recent Australian memory.<br />
Against that, the factionalism in the Liberal Party is just<br />
completely breaking them up because they can't formulate policy.<br />
You look at-any issue that they have talked about. Privatisation<br />
a total mess. The factions there are just absolutely opposed<br />
to one another. Some of them saying this is what has to be done.<br />
The others saying this is an absolute nonsense. You look at the<br />
question of wages regulation. -Some are saying you have got<br />
to abolish the Arbitration Commission. That is what Sinclair is<br />
saying and sections of the Liberal Party. Others are saying you<br />
must keep it. Now it is that sort of factionalism which I am<br />
talking about which is stopping the emergence of effective<br />
policy. JOURNALIST: Mr Hartley would say that Socialist Left isn't<br />
getting any say in policy though?<br />
PM: I haven't got anything to-say about Mr Hartley.<br />
JOURNALIST: I was going to say that the Liberals have said that<br />
it is the public's view of the factional fighting within the ALP,<br />
particularly in this electorate, which is going to do it damage.<br />
what do you say about that?<br />
PM: I have already answered that. The existing groups in the<br />
Labor Party have not prevented the emergence of strong, effective<br />
government.<br />
JOURNALIST: But does the public see it that way? </p>
<p>Pm: of course they do. Look at the polls and look what they are<br />
saying. They are repudiating the Liberals. Why do you think<br />
that Mr Gray has said of the Federal Leader of the Liberal Party<br />
he doesn't want him over there because he doesn't agree with what<br />
he is saying. He says his talk about privatisation, his talk<br />
about wages deregulation, Mr Gray has said in a letter on 3rd<br />
January to the Hobart Mercury, he said " that is nonsense. I wish<br />
he would stop talking about those things and talk about issues<br />
which are relevant to the people of Australia". Now it is that<br />
sort of factionalism and division which is ruining the Liberal<br />
Party in mainland Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawk you mentioned employment and inflation,<br />
the Government's record there. There was no mention today of the<br />
rally today of interest rates?<br />
PM: Well, I didn't mention interest rates. It is not an issue<br />
which I am being inundated with. What I am being told by the<br />
people of Australia is that they welcome the achievements of this<br />
Government in the areas that I am talking about employment and<br />
inflation. They know that to protect the exchange rate to some<br />
extent there has been a necessity to have fairly tight monetary<br />
policy for a while. And that taking the overall economic policy<br />
into account, which is producing a continuation of strong<br />
economic growth, that that particular phase that we are going<br />
through is one that is necessary within the total framework of<br />
policy. And the Australian people are much more intelligent than<br />
some commentators give them credit for.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is monetary policy likely to ease a bit now, Prime<br />
Minister? PM: I am not talking about monetary policy at this stage. I<br />
merely make the observation that you will have seen that there<br />
has been a strengthening of the dollar and slight easing of<br />
interest rates. And I welcome that. And simply repeat that the<br />
Government will continue the policies which are necessary to<br />
maintain what, I have referred to earlier today. That is the fact<br />
-that we have the strongest economic growth rate amongst the OECD<br />
countries and the highest rate of employment growth. We are<br />
going to have policies which enable us to sustain that growth<br />
with sustainable levels of inflation.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Liberals say they are going to make big inroads<br />
into your majority in this seat?<br />
PM: Is that right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you got any comment on the sanctions against<br />
Libya? PM: The Government will be considering this matter. There is a<br />
Cabinet meeting tomorrow. I merely say that I -endorse what Mr<br />
Hayden, the Foreign Minister, has said. That this country<br />
rejects the tactic of international. terrorism which has been<br />
increasingly emerging in the world. And we believe the<br />
international community needs to act together against this. We<br />
will be considering the issue in detail tomorrow.<br />
