    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Turnbull Government is pleased to announce that Mr Justin Milne has been appointed as the Chairman and a non-executive director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Board.</p>
<p>Mr Milne brings exceptional experience spanning the film, digital media, telecommunications and information technology sectors. He has served executive and non-executive positions across these sectors.</p>
<p>Mr Milne has a passion for media and the ABC, having first encountered the national broadcaster in rural South Australia during his childhood. After founding a small film production company in Adelaide, he expanded the business in Sydney and has since developed an impressive breadth of experience in digital technology and communications.</p>
<p>Mr Milne’s deep understanding of traditional and digital media and the broad technology and software industry will be of great benefit to the ABC. His leadership and extensive governance experience will complement the predominantly business and financial management skills of the ABC Board.</p>
<p>Mr Milne is well known as the former long-serving chief of Telstra’s BigPond Internet division and prior to that as CEO of OzEmail. Following his executive role with Telstra, Mr Milne has continued in his non-executive career, including as Chairman of MYOB Group and NetComm Wireless, and Non-Executive Director of NBN Co, Members Equity Bank and SMS Management and Consulting. Mr Milne was previously a Non-Executive Director at Basketball Australia and the Sydney Children’s Hospital.</p>
<p>Mr Milne has a proven track record of managing complex organisations. His technical and marketing savvy, inclusive leadership style and understanding of technology shifts will help shape the ABC’s strategy in an environment of rapidly changing technology and consumer preferences.</p>
<p>We thank retiring chairman James Spigelman AC QC for his leadership of the ABC Board over the past five years. He has steered the ABC through substantial change helping to ensure our national broadcaster represents and serves the breadth of Australian communities.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, Mr Milne has been appointed for a period of five years commencing on 1 April 2017. </p>
<p>Mr Milne’s appointment follows a selection process undertaken by an independent ABC Nomination Panel. Mr Milne was recommended by the Panel. </p>
