<p>PM: I just wanted to take this opportunity to say a few words about Dame Elisabeth Murdoch.</p>
<p>Dame Elisabeth Murdoch was a remarkable Australian.</p>
<p>Today we start our fond farewells to a woman who lived a long and amazing life.</p>
<p>We particularly admire her love of charity and doing good works for others.</p>
<p>She's been a fantastic patron of the arts in our country and has helped so many people forge their careers.</p>
<p>I do, as Prime Minister, want to offer my condolences to the Murdoch family and say that Dame Elisabeth will be missed.</p>
<p>She will be missed for her kindness and generosity.</p>
<p>She will be missed as an example of a long life well-lived.</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>
