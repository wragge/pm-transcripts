Press Statement No. 523<br />
June 1975<br />
AUSTRALIAN MARITIME COLLEGE<br />
The Prime Minister, the Hon. E. G. Whitlam, has<br />
confirmed the Government's decision, announced on 10 June 1975,<br />
to establish an Australian M aritime College to provide<br />
education and training for officers in the Australian<br />
maritime industry and to site it at Launceston.<br />
The decision results from a report on " Training<br />
Requirements for Sea-going Personnel" from Mr Malcolm Summers,<br />
who is the Royal Commissioner inquiring into various aspects<br />
of the maritime industry. The report was tabled on 11 July 1974.<br />
Launceston was chosen because the College needs to have<br />
practical training facilities at a seamanship centre-including<br />
a jetty, boat repair sheds, boats, liferafts and periodic access<br />
to a small training ship. It needs to be situated close to<br />
sheltered water with good access to the sea.<br />
Launceston has these requirements and its proximity to<br />
Bass Strait is a decisive consideration.<br />
The Government accepts the recommendation of Mr Summers<br />
that the College should be based on a requirement of 300 student<br />
places, with provision for future growth. The Government accepts<br />
the recommendations that the College should be situated close to<br />
a tertiary institution, which may need to be developed further<br />
than the existing advanced education facilities in Launceston.<br />
Library, hall of residence and some other facilities could, by<br />
arrangement with the-Tasmanian Government, be available for joint<br />
use with Tasmanian tertiary students. The Committee investigating<br />
post secondary education in Tasmania will be asked to recommend<br />
the manner of this association.<br />
The College will educate deck officers, engineer officers,<br />
radio officers, and provide for higher studies including nautical<br />
science degree qualifications, for which at present Australian<br />
seafarers are forced to go overseas.<br />
The College will be comprehensive. It-will be a college<br />
with predominantly tertiary level studies with associated courses<br />
at a level appropriate for seamen and fishermen and including<br />
practical training in safety, fire fighting, and life saving.<br />
