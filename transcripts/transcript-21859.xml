    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce the appointment today of two new members to the Taskforce on Workplace Relations Reform.</p>
<p>The Government Whip in the Senate, Senator Jeannie Ferris, and Mr Phil Barresi MP, both of whom have broad knowledge of workplace relations issues, will join the Taskforce.</p>
<p>The Taskforce is assisting the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon Kevin Andrews MP, in providing information to the community about the Australian Government's workplace reforms.</p>
<p> Senator Ferris, the Government Whip in the Senate, chairs the Government's Policy Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation. Combined with her long-standing interest in rural issues, Senator Ferris will provide a valuable contribution to the Taskforce, with a particular interest in rural and regional matters.</p>
<p>Mr Barresi is Chairman of the Government's Policy Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Employment Services and Chairman of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation. These roles, and his experience with industrial relations issues prior to entering Parliament, ensures he will bring a wealth of policy and reform expertise to the Taskforce.</p>
<p>The Taskforce, chaired by Mr Andrew Robb MP, will help explain to the community the importance of the workplace relations changes and their role in ensuring the continued growth of the Australian economy.</p>
