TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH GRAHAM WORLD, ABC AM PROGRAM<br />
APRIL 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
GW:-Mr Keating, the opening of the friendship bridge is the centrepiece of<br />
this visit. What tangible benefits should it bring for Australia?<br />
PM: Well, I think that it underlines the fact that Australia is very closely<br />
involved now with the region. And it indicates, obviously, we have<br />
comprehended the changes, which have taken place since the Cold<br />
War: that's the settlement in Cambodia; the economic reforms in Laos;<br />
the growth. in Thailand. the dramatic growth in Thailand; and the<br />
economic reform on the way in Vietnam. In a sense the bridge tends<br />
to symbolise the changes which are talding place within Indo-China.<br />
And Australia is now involved with each of these economies, it is<br />
involved with the Governments and it is tangibly involved by the<br />
development of this important piece of infrastructure.<br />
GW: Well, there is concern that the bridge could hasten the spread of Aids<br />
into Laos, that there will be new commercial pressures, environmental<br />
degradation. Having built the bridge what responsibilities do we have<br />
on those fronts?<br />
PM: Well, I think the Governments of these two countries, Thailand and<br />
Laos, wanted this bridge to be built. I think the per capita income of<br />
Laos is $ 200 a year, $ 4.00 a week. I don't think that people in this<br />
country saying look, we are quite happy to leave them on $ 4.00 a<br />
week as long as they don't get tangled up with the rest of us, that's<br />
fine. Well, I don't think that is much of a policy, frankly. It is up to the<br />
Laotian people to make their own minds up about their development,<br />
and infrastructure of this kind, simply a bridge to ford the river, the<br />
important Mekong River, is something of course that might have<br />
existed a long time ago, biiit for the fact that these countries can't fund<br />
these infrastructure needs. So, I think that, yes, the Governments will </p>
<p>need to be mindful of some of the development responsibilities here,<br />
but again it should give us a chance to lift the wealth of this area, and<br />
including particularly, Laos.<br />
GW: They can't even agree at this stage on precisely where the border<br />
should be.<br />
PM: Well I don't think we should worry about those sorts of things. One of<br />
the important things here is that Thailand is the second fastest growing<br />
ASEAN economy after Indonesia. It has got 58 million people. We<br />
-have always had very warm relations with Thailand, so because it is<br />
not a problem many Australians think, therefore, it shouldn't be in a<br />
sense, attended. That is, we shouldn't develop the relationship<br />
further. Now, I think we should develop the relationship further, that is<br />
part of the point of my visit. And the growth and wealth which has<br />
been generated in Thailand can flow into other parts of Indo-China<br />
including Laos. So, this will be a tangible help to lifting the income and<br />
living standards of these people.<br />
GW: Turning to the region in general, you have been building an extensive<br />
network of contacts, APEC has been your primary vehicle, but how far<br />
can this network go?<br />
PM: This is the way to set Australia up in this decade and for the 21 st<br />
cent Iury: to be part of the growth of the Asia-Pacific. And you can see<br />
just how quickly it has changed already. It wasn't too many years ago<br />
we lived in fear of Asia, or, if not fear, contempt of it. And then when<br />
the tigers took off we developed a bit of an inferiority complex about<br />
them, well, we are now shedding that. We are now engaged with the<br />
area, we are now relevant to these economies and societies, and the<br />
the way to do it is bilaterally. That is, between Australia and each<br />
other country relationship developing, and multilaterally through<br />
organisations such as APEC where we can increase the velocity of<br />
trade and investment, make the -Asia-Pacific a greater area of wealth<br />
generation for all of us. But we will always need to attend to these<br />
bilateral relationships and that is why I have gone out of my way to<br />
develop them in the area, be they with Indonesia, or Singapore, or<br />
Thailand, or Laos or Cambodia, et cetera.<br />
GW: In Thailand in recent days moves to reform the Constitution have been<br />
blocked that sparked some fears of civil unrest. How much is that a<br />
cause for concern?<br />
PM: Well, I mean, often the politics of some countries in the area, the<br />
mechanisms are not there to be exercised the way they are in this<br />
country, I think this is one of our great strengths. That is, our basic<br />
sense of democracy in this country is one of the things that actually<br />
stamps us out, marks us out in the area. But I don't think that this is a<br />
matter of, in a sense, concern to me in this visit. I mean these<br />
constitutional issues, no doubt, are of great significance in Thailand </p>
<p>and matters will come and go. But it is the relationship, nation to<br />
nation which matters. Even though we have seen over a period of time<br />
some quite regular changes of Government.<br />
GW: All right. With Vietnam how quickly do we want an economic and<br />
political relationship such as we now have with Indonesia?<br />
PM: Well, you have got to, I think, firstly understand that Vietnam's<br />
economy is about, well, only a fraction of that of Indonesia's, it is<br />
growing. We have got a very warm relationship with Vietnam which<br />
we developed over time. I had a chance to host a visit by Prime<br />
Minister Kiet when he came to Australia, and I am looking forward-to<br />
hit invitation-to return.<br />
GW: You said that Australia can never be an Asian nation, and that we go<br />
to Asia as we are, as Australians. So, given that to what extent do we<br />
have to play be their rules?<br />
PM: Well, I think the main thing, one of our strengths is that we play by our<br />
rules. We are a democracy, we have gone to Asia with our values<br />
intact, we are playing a leading role in shaping the region, as you can<br />
see in Cambodia and in APEC. We play our role in helpful<br />
infrastructure development of the kind of thing like, for instance, the<br />
Bridge which I will be opening during this visit. And I think that our<br />
open society, our sense of democracy, means that we are well<br />
regarded in the region and we don't need to be there apologetically,<br />
you know, playing by, if you like, the cultures or cultural standards of<br />
those countries. We don't need to accept the idea that we have to<br />
become a low wage society, that the only way that we can compete in<br />
Asia is to be a low wage country. I mean, it is one of the point of the<br />
Governments industrial relations changes introduced a week or so<br />
ago. It is one of the differentiating points with our opponents. We<br />
want to be an educated society selling high value added products,<br />
taking premium prices, being price setters and not price takers and the<br />
way to do this is to develop ones education system, research and<br />
development, product innovation, exports, keeping the<br />
competitiveness, the low inflation rate, and the general cultural shift to<br />
a more productive society, and taking that engagingly to Asia, and<br />
being relevant in the area. I mean, I think that is the thing which can<br />
set Australia up into the future.<br />
GW: Well, just finally, you mentioned domestic politics. You are flying out<br />
leaving a factional brawl going on in NSW. Does that need to be<br />
settled now by the National Executive?<br />
PM: I joined the Labor Party 35 odd years ago, this will be factional brawl<br />
number probably 210,341. Like all the other it will be settled at some<br />
point. It is over State pre-selections and fortunately I don't have to<br />
worry too much about those. </p>
<p>4<br />
GW: Even though it damages the Party?<br />
PM: These are all passing things. I mean if you want to see a brawl look at<br />
the one in the Liberal Party. It is a real one. It is about the national<br />
leadership of their Party.<br />
GW: Mr Keating thanks for joining us.<br />
