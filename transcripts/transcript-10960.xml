    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much Michelle. To both you and Kevin can I</p>
<p>   first of all say congratulations for having embarked upon and completed</p>
<p>   what remains one of life's most challenging exercises and that</p>
<p>   is to write a book. We may think, we politicians, that there are</p>
<p>   lots of books around, there are. But there are lots of people who</p>
<p>   think they would like to write a book. There are lots of people</p>
<p>   who start to write books, but many of them never finish writing</p>
<p>   those books. And of course there are some people who we wish would</p>
<p>   never have even thought of writing a book let alone completing the</p>
<p>   task. So congratulations to both of you for having made a very firm</p>
<p>   personal commitment to such a journey. </p>
<p>In case you don't know, Michelle graduated in arts with honours</p>
<p>   from the Australian National University, and now works as a research</p>
<p>   officer with Senator Alan Eggleston. Kevin, I think you all know,</p>
<p>   as having been the Member for Menzies for a number of years. He</p>
<p>   was a barrister of law before entering federal Parliament, married</p>
<p>   with five children. And he's made a very distinctive contribution</p>
<p>   to political and Parliamentary life in the time that he's represented</p>
<p>   the division of Menzies.</p>
<p>One of the valuable things that I believe this book will do is</p>
<p>   to provide a quite special source of information and point of reference</p>
<p>   to people involved in public affairs because what it does, on the</p>
<p>   examination that I've been able to undertake, is that it brings</p>
<p>   together under one cover so many of these statistics and the changes</p>
<p>   in trends that we in public life need to know about virtually on</p>
<p>   a daily basis. You can often find a book that, say, deals with demographic</p>
<p>   trends. You can a find a book that deals completely with economic</p>
<p>   trends. You can find a book that deals completely with social trends.</p>
<p>   And you can find plenty of books that deal with political trends.</p>
<p>   But what Changing Australia' does is to get all of those</p>
<p>   under the one cover and in the process provide a very valuable source</p>
<p>   of reference to those involved in politics. </p>
<p> It is of course a veritable treasure trove of politically</p>
<p>   relevant and socially alarming statistics. For example it tells</p>
<p>   us that the rate of youth suicide in 1960 was 3.5 per 1000, but</p>
<p>   in 1990 it had risen to 11.2. Australia has many things to boast</p>
<p>   about. One of the things of which it should be particularly ashamed</p>
<p>   is the very high level of youth suicide. It has statistics that</p>
<p>   are relevant to contemporary political issue such as the debate</p>
<p>   about taxation reform. It tells us that families with children comprise</p>
<p>   62% of households in the poorest 30% of society, but only 32% of</p>
<p>   those in the top 10% of Australian households measured according</p>
<p>   to wealth. It tells us that over the past decade personal income</p>
<p>   tax, as a share of Commonwealth government revenue, rose from 35%</p>
<p>   to 54%, that's in the last decade, and this compares with an</p>
<p>   average of only 31% for all OECD nations. I can't think of</p>
<p>   a more compelling and relevant statistic in favour of fundamental</p>
<p>   reform of our taxation system, and the need for a new tax system</p>
<p>   for a century in case you'd missed the point that I thought</p>
<p>   should relevantly be made in relation to that.</p>
<p>It's also been recorded in the book that between 1960, and</p>
<p>   this really is an extraordinary statistic, between 1960 and 1990</p>
<p>   the effective tax rate on individuals rose by 83% where as the effective</p>
<p>   tax rate on families rose by 360%. Now when some of us argue that</p>
<p>   there should be some re-weighting of the balance of the taxation</p>
<p>   system in favour of family groupings perhaps a statistic like that</p>
<p>   will demonstrate that we are not engaged in some kind of anti-single</p>
<p>   person crusade. We are merely in the business of trying to re-weight</p>
<p>   the imbalance that has crept into our tax system over the years</p>
<p>   and one of the things of which I am exceptionally proud as Prime</p>
<p>   Minister was the family tax initiative that we took to the 1996</p>
<p>   election, and the way in which it has been dramatically reinforced</p>
<p>   in the taxation reform package which the Treasurer introduced into</p>
<p>   the federal Parliament.</p>
<p>Speaking generally, one of the other things that the book does</p>
<p>   is to remind us of how we are no longer the society of joiners of</p>
<p>   organisations which we once were. And this applies right across</p>
<p>   the spectrum. It applies to political parties, it applies to movements</p>
<p>   within religious denominations, it applies to some of the best known</p>
<p>   service organisations and national institutions. And if I were asked</p>
<p>   to, in a phrase, define the younger generation of the 1990s and</p>
<p>   illustrate one of their differences with younger generations of</p>
<p>   earlier periods, I would say that they are above all an options</p>
<p>   generation. They don't like to commit themselves too far in</p>
<p>   advance to anything and they like to keep a decision on what they</p>
<p>   do with their lives to the very last moment. And I think it is one</p>
<p>   of the characteristics of the way in which society has changed.</p>
<p>   I don't say that in a sense of lamenting it. I think what you</p>
<p>   have to do with change is to always know that it's going to</p>
<p>   occur. You must always do your best to accommodate it. Where it</p>
<p>   is for the good you should accelerate it. Where it is for the bad</p>
<p>   you should argue against the wisdom of ever changing just for the</p>
<p>   sake of change. But you should never be pessimistic about society's</p>
<p>   capacity to change for the good because so much of what has occurred</p>
<p>   over the period of years covered by this book, although it has been</p>
<p>   unsettling to many in our society, it has also produced many beneficial</p>
<p>   outcomes. And there are characteristics of modern society which</p>
<p>   are infinitely more tolerant, infinitely more understanding, and</p>
<p>   infinitely more compassionate than used to be the case. I believe</p>
<p>   very strongly that one of the ennobling things about modern society</p>
<p>   is that we have a far more compassionate, enlightened, decent understanding</p>
<p>   approach to people within our community with any kind of handicap</p>
<p>   or disability compared to what was the situation 30 or 40 years</p>
<p>   ago where I think they were treated in many ways quite shamefully,</p>
<p>   and quite indecently. </p>
<p>So it is a very interesting volume and it reminds us that despite</p>
<p>   the decline in the membership of what you might call finite organisations</p>
<p>   which are involved in different kinds of good works, the number</p>
<p>   of people generically involved in volunteer work in Australian society</p>
<p>   is still as robust as ever and it records that the recent survey</p>
<p>   of unpaid work found that one in five Australians carry out voluntary</p>
<p>   work in the community. And that the nations 2.6 million volunteers</p>
<p>   donate the equivalent of 22 work days a year to community service</p>
<p>   which is the equivalent of almost a quarter of a million people</p>
<p>   working full-time. And it's also interesting to note that retired</p>
<p>   people carry out twice as much voluntary work as people in the paid</p>
<p>   work force.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentleman, I do want to congratulate both Michelle and</p>
<p>   Kevin on the compilation of this volume. I want to thank them for</p>
<p>   the contribution that this work will make to an informed understanding</p>
<p>   of the issues that we as members of Parliament are required to debate.</p>
<p>   Understanding our own nation is a prerequisite to governing our</p>
<p>   nation well and Changing Australia' will make a contribution</p>
<p>   to a better understanding of Australia and we should all be indebted</p>
<p>   to Michelle and Kevin for that contribution and I have much pleasure</p>
<p>   in launching the book. Thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
