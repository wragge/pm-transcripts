    <content><![CDATA[<p>
Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced a new hospital staff exchange program between Darwin and Bali to help Bali's Sanglah Hospital reach international medical standards.</p>
<p>The announcement came during a visit to the Royal Darwin Hospital by both the Prime Minister and Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono as part of the Australia-Indonesia Annual Leaders' Meeting in Darwin. </p>
<p>The exchange will see doctors, nurses and health professionals travel from Royal Darwin Hospital to Sanglah Hospital to mentor and share clinical and leadership skills and knowledge. </p>
<p>The program will also see the implementation of essential education programs for nurses in Sanglah Hospital.</p>
<p>The $600,000 program from 2012 to 2015 builds on Australia's previous funding support to Sanglah Hospital. </p>
<p>After the Bali terrorist attacks in 2002 and 2005, Australia provided a range of assistance to the hospital, including $5 million towards a new intensive care centre and burns unit  -  the 12 October Australia Memorial Centre  -  the refurbishment of the morgue, the installation of a new hospital incinerator and training for hospital staff to operate specialist medical equipment.</p>
<p>Australia is Indonesia's largest grant donor. This funding builds on the successful development partnership between the two countries that is helping to save lives, open up opportunities for the poor and promote sustainable economic development. </p>
