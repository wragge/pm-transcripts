PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 18 NOVEMBER 1986<br />
I will attend the 1987 Davos Symposium of the World<br />
Economic Forum in Switzerland.<br />
The Symposium is widely recognised as the most important<br />
annual gathering of the world's business and economic<br />
leaders. It is to be attended by around 800 senior<br />
business people, bankers and administrators from top<br />
companies and organisations and senior Government figures<br />
from around the world.<br />
I have accepted an invitation from the organisers to<br />
present the opening keynote address to the Symposium on<br />
Thursday 29 January.<br />
The Symposium is a unique meeting of eminent and<br />
influential people, and as such, offers a venue for<br />
informal discussions with business and Government leaders<br />
from those nations most important to much of Australia's<br />
trade and investment. </p>
