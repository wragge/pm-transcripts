FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 20/ 1967<br />
COMMONWEALTH AID TO TASMANIA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
I wish to make it clear that contribution by the Commonwealth<br />
of $ 250, 000 to help meet urgent cases of hardship which come to the<br />
notice of the Tasmanian Government is merely the first advance of the<br />
Commonwealth's bushfire assistance.<br />
I have already assured Mr. Reece and stated publicly that the<br />
Commonwealth Government recognises that Tasmania, being a small<br />
State with limited resources, will need more assistance in other directions<br />
such as with re-housing and rehabilitation of industry.<br />
I told Mr. Reece that the meeting previously arranged for<br />
next week of the Commonwealth and Premiers would provide a convenient<br />
opportunity to discuss these problems in the light of assessments made<br />
by then. I am sure the other State Premiers who have all sent messages<br />
of sympathy will be glad to join with the Commonwealth in doing what we<br />
can to help Tasmania through this disaster as speedily as possible.<br />
CANBERRA, February, 1967. </p>
