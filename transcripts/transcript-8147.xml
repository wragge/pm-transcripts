FOR MEDIA 27 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
I am delighted that N~ elson Mandela, the Deputy President of<br />
the African National Congress, has accepted my invitation to<br />
visit Australia as a guest of the Governent. Mr Mandela's<br />
visit is expected to take place from 23-25 October, and he<br />
will visit Ceanberra, Sydney and Melbourne.<br />
During his visit, Mr Mandela will have the opportunity to<br />
meet political, business and community leaders as well as<br />
the many ordinary Australians who have admired his courage<br />
and vision over so many years. In Canberra, Mr Mandela will<br />
meet with me and my Cabinet colleagues for discussions about<br />
recent and future developments in South Africa.<br />
I wholeheartedly welcome Mr Mandela's visit. It is a chance<br />
to express our admiration for the spirit of tolerance and<br />
human dignity which he has brought to the South African<br />
political sceane, and our support for the process of<br />
negotiation that he and President de Kierk have begun. I<br />
look forward to discussing with him not only the state of<br />
South Africa at present, but the shape of the new South<br />
Africa that is now emerging, and Australia's relations with<br />
it. </p>
