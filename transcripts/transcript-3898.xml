PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 564<br />
24 September 1975<br />
FOREIGIJ ITWJEST". 1IT " OT, I ry<br />
4In this statement I am amnoiumcirog details of further developments<br />
in the Government's -policies tov.-ards foreign investmient. These<br />
developments follow a revie',, b0y the Resources Committee of<br />
Cabcieet tai asect ofthe policies in the light of the<br />
ex-perience gained since December 19/ 72. Their are also intended<br />
to clarify certain aspects of our policies here th-cre appears to<br />
be some confusion in the minds of forelign inve-stors.<br />
T" his announcement comporises comnot stteen ofth<br />
Governmcnt's policy in the ffreg nvestment.<br />
Th Goverfii-, erit is deternrined to s?: eglizuard the leg~ itimate<br />

The Government is look ing to thqe bIusi ness commruni ty to<br />
cooert wIt it in hclopi-r to -hiev, the pol i cy<br />
objective of unaximrum actc -Lutlin particilation </p>
<p>2. in the activities of foreign companies operating in Australia,<br />
on the basis of fair and reasonable negotiations. It is<br />
also, of course, important for there to be appropriate<br />
co-operation between the Australian Government and the<br />
various State Governments in achieving these objectives.<br />
For its part, the Government will be doing all in its<br />
power to foster this co-operation.<br />
If this co-operation is forthcoming, I believe there will<br />
Sbe great benefits accruing to all concerned foreign<br />
investors themselves, Australian businesses and, most<br />
important of all, the Australian nation and the Australian<br />
people. I emphasise that the Government recognises that Australia<br />
will, for the foreseeable future, continue to require<br />
foreign-capital, including equity capital, if we are to<br />
achieve our basic aim of ensuring that Australia's resources<br />
and industies are developed in such a way as to bring<br />
maximum benefits to the Australian people. ' i7thin this<br />
over-riding goal, ho'wever, the Government, while continuing<br />
to welcome beneficial foreign capital, has a major longer<br />
term objective of the promotion of Australian control<br />
and the maximum Australian ownership compatible with our<br />
long term capital requirements and our need for access<br />
to markets, advanced technology and know-how.<br />
recognise that the private sector has a major role to<br />
play in achieving this objective. Public bodies such as<br />
the AIDC also need to participate to the maximum extent<br />
practicable if the objective is to be achieved.<br />
This statement covers three ' main areas:<br />
First, an expansion of the process of screening new foreign </p>
<p>investment poroposals, and proposals to expand existing<br />
foreign investment activities, * here these proposals do<br />
not invlove exchange control approvals. In a statement<br />
on 12 June 1974, I announmccd the establishment of a new<br />
interdepartental com-iittee ( tile Foreign Investment<br />
Committee) to examine and rovide advice on foreign<br />
investment proposals which come under notice through the<br />
exchange control mechanism. At the same time, I requested<br />
the bringing forward for the Government's consideration of<br />
detailed proposals for the screening of foreign investment<br />
activities w-hich do not involve exchange control approvals<br />
for example, investment proposals financed by foreign<br />
interests' from funds availhble to them from Australian<br />
sources. The second area covered by todav's stUtement is a further<br />
elaboraztion of the detail of the ' ove . riDt'S p olicy on<br />
foreign investiment in the miner. 1l sector. The Government<br />
hoas liven careful consideration to the questicn of foreign<br />
investent in the miner: ls sector in the light of various<br />
reoresentations it h(, s received to the effect that the<br />
policy has not been spelled cut publicly ith sufficient<br />
clarity, and that more specific guidelines are required<br />
in order to engender business eoIfidence and to permit<br />
both Austrilian and foreign companies to plan ahead on<br />
projects where risks are high at the exploration stage and<br />
lead tines are long at the develoment stag-e.<br />
It continues to be the Government's firm policy, however,<br />
to examine foreign investment proposals, w; hether in the<br />
minerals sector or elsewhere, on a case-by-case basis. The<br />
details outlined later in this statement should, therefore,<br />
be regarded more in the natire of guidelines than as<br />
co: istitutin inflexible rules. I stress that potential </p>
<p>4. foreign investors should subm.: it their proposals to the<br />
Governm, nt at an early date. Th s is oarticulrl1 imrortant,<br />
if the foreign investor is uncertain as to the acceptability<br />
of his proposals. Early submission will enable the investor<br />
to discuss the proposals with government and thereby obtain<br />
any necessary guidance on them.<br />
The third matter covered by today's announcement is a<br />
review of the Governmentbpolicy on foreign investment in<br />
Australian real estate.<br />
The Government has now reviewed the operation of its policy<br />
on foreig investment in real estate in Australia in the<br />
light of the ex: perience we have gained since the first<br />
announcement of that policy by the then Tre-asurer, M. r Crean,<br />
in ' M1arch 1973. In the light of this review, wie have decided<br />
to introduce certain modifications to the policy nd. to set<br />
out clearly the principles under which the policv is to be<br />
administered. The relevant details are set cut below.<br />
SCHREBNINI G OF FOR. IGI InVLE IT I<br />
First, the comprehensive scheme for the screening of foreign<br />
investment proposals as foreshadowed lest yer.<br />
Establishment of New Committee<br />
The foreign Investment Committee and the Committee on<br />
Foreign Takeovers are to be merged into a single Committee<br />
to be known as the Foreign Investment Advisory Committee.<br />
The new Committee will subsLime the roles of the two Committees<br />
which it replaces. Like these Committees, it will be<br />
advisory, and will report to the Treasurer as the ; inister </p>
<p>with overall responsibility for all foreign investment matters.<br />
The new Committee will have responsibility for examining<br />
and advising the Treasurer on foreign investment proposals<br />
whether or not they involve exchange control approvals. At<br />
present proposals which do not involve exchange control are<br />
not screened by either Committee unless they fall within<br />
the ambit of the Foreign Takeovers Act.<br />
Although the broadening of the Comimittee's role into the area<br />
outside exhange control and the foreign takeovers measures<br />
is a new development as far as the screening process is concerned,<br />
it does not involve any basic policy changes.<br />
Foreign takeovers will continue to be examined in terms of<br />
the Foreign Takeovers Act which was passed by the Parliament<br />
on 21 Aug 1975.<br />
In the non-takeovers area, the screening process will not,<br />
for the time being, be backed by specific new legislation.<br />
The Government believes that there are considerable advantages<br />
for all concerned in continuing ; ith a system which relies on<br />
0 the voluntary co-operation of business with the Government's<br />
policy objectives.<br />
Of course, where any aspect of a foreign investment proposal<br />
recuires approval under the Banking ( Foreign Exchange)<br />
Regulations, the Reserve Bank will continue its practice of<br />
withholding such approval until the Government has indicated<br />
that the proposal is not against the national interest.<br />
Membership of Committee<br />
The new Committee will comprise representatives of the<br />
Treasury, Attorney-General's Department, the Department of<br />
Minerals and Energy, the Department of Overseas Trade, the </p>
<p>Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department<br />
of ', anufacturing Industry, and the Reserve Bank. Representatives<br />
of other departments will be co-opted to the Committee as<br />
appropriate in the examination of particular proposals. As<br />
previously, the Treasury will provide the. executive to the<br />
Committee. Criteria to be used by Committee<br />
All examinable foreign investmeht proposals will be screened<br />
against the background of the Government's basic aim of<br />
ensuring that X ustralian industries and resources are developed<br />
in such alway as to bring maximum benefits to the Australian<br />
people. In e: amining specific investment proposals, the Coxmmittee will<br />
take into account~ various criteria, the most important of<br />
which are listed in Xttachment A to this statement. These<br />
criteria are not exclusive, however, and will be modified<br />
a, necesary to suit partiular cases and in the light of<br />
experience.<br />
Relationshi; between General Foreign Investment Policy and<br />
Foreign Thkeovers Act.<br />
Foreign investment proposals will be examined as appropriate<br />
for compatibility with the Covernment's general foreign<br />
investment policy and/ or for compliance with the Government's<br />
specific policy on foreign takeovers. However, foreign<br />
investment proposals hich are actionable under the Foreign<br />
Takeovers Act and which are deemed to be acceptable to the<br />
Government in terms of that Act will not also be examined in<br />
light of the general foreign investment policy. </p>
<p>7. 7orein Investments to be Screened<br />
For all foreign investment proposuls, " foreimn interests"<br />
for the purposes of tUhr screening process are corporations<br />
in ! which a single foreign shareholder, or associ: Ated foreign<br />
shareholders, own 15 percent or more of the equity of the<br />
corporation, or in , which the total foreign equity exceeds<br />
per ccnt; or individuals whose normal place of residence<br />
is outside Australia. Corporations are deemed to include all<br />
types of businesses.<br />
Commercial investment, by fori gn governments, other than<br />
investments related to their official representation, will<br />
also be screened.<br />
" Foreign investment" means funds to be invested in fixed<br />
as-ets whether o-ned or leased, whether financed from equity<br />
or loan funds, and 1whether financed from whatever source<br />
within Australia dr overseas.<br />
Sforeign investment proposal will be subject to the screening<br />
urocess if it is for the purpoe of the foreign interests<br />
establishing a new business or undertarking a new mining<br />
project. In' the case of manufacturing or service industries,<br />
such a proposal ill be taken to involve an establishment of<br />
a new business if it would result in a foreign interest carrying<br />
on a new primary activity as defined in the Australian Standard<br />
Industrial Classification as published from time to time by<br />
the Australan Bureau of Statistics, unless the new activity<br />
w! ere primar to a class in which the foreign interest is<br />
already engaged.<br />
Except for non-bank financial institutions and insurance<br />
conp~ jnies, which are dealt with later in the statement, the<br />
Committee will dso screen foreign investment roposals involving<br />
exponsions by existing businesses where the cost of the<br />
expansion, in any 12 months, amounts to more than 15 per cent </p>
<p>of the company's total assets before the proposed expansion,<br />
provided tiat any expansion involving more than .10 million<br />
in any 12 months will be screened and further provided that<br />
all proposed expansions in mining and real estate will be screened.<br />
The Committee will also screen proposals by companies operating<br />
in Australia to increase the overall proportionate foreign<br />
ownership of the cmpany by more than a specified percentage<br />
above the level of fo; reign ownership which existed at the date<br />
of this statement. In the case of non-bank financial<br />
institutions and insurance companies, proposals will be screened<br />
if the foreign ownership increases by more than 5 percent,<br />
and in other cases if the foreign ownership increases by . more<br />
than 15 p'er cent. This applies whether or not the company<br />
is already foreign controlled. The Foreign Takeovers Act<br />
applies whenever there is a change in control regardless of<br />
the degree of change in foreign ownership.<br />
Foreign investment proposals as defined above, except those<br />
involving the development of uranium, will not be subject to<br />
examination ;' here the btal Australian participation in the<br />
proposal is 85 percent or more, unless there are associated<br />
arrangements attaching to the foreign participation which<br />
give the foreign parties a greater degree of ownership or<br />
control of the venture than would appear prima facie to be<br />
the case.<br />
Except in the case of a new non-bank financial institution<br />
or a new insurance company, and except for minerals and real<br />
estate, foreign investment proposals which involve funds of<br />
less than i$ 1 million in any 12 month period will not be<br />
subject to aeamination by the Committee, although this will<br />
not affect the normal requirements of exchange control approval.<br />
Furthermore, except for non-bank financial institutions,<br />
insurance companies, minerals and real estate, if it can be </p>
<p>demonstrated that a foreign investment proposal will be<br />
Australian controlled, it will in general be approved.<br />
Proposals 1which are not . ustralian controlled will be ex-amined<br />
on their individual merits. Controlling interest in this context<br />
means the identiity of the interest ( company or person) in a<br />
position to determine the major policy decisions of the venture.<br />
Non-Bank Fiancial Institutions and Insurance Companies<br />
Non-bank financial institutions and insurance companies are<br />
subject to specific Australian Governrment legisltion. Australia<br />
is already adequately supplied with non-bank financial<br />
institutions and insurance co: 2panies. Accordingly it is<br />
the Governnent's general objective to require foreign interests<br />
wishing either to establish, or to participate in the establishment<br />
of, a new non-bank financial institution or insurance company,<br />
or to significantly increase their participation in an existing<br />
institution, to demonstrate that the Australian economy would<br />
be advantaged by their doing so.<br />
Foreign investment policy in respect of non-bank financial<br />
inrstitutions and insurance comnpanies will be broadly administered<br />
on the same basis as other forms of foreign investment ( with<br />
the exception of minerals and real estate). The application<br />
of the general screening process and criteria is qualified,<br />
ho,. ever, in four respects:<br />
ll foreign i nvestment proposals relating to new non-bank<br />
financial institutions or insurance companies will be<br />
screened, irrespective of the level of funds involved.<br />
11 propocals to increase the overall proportionate<br />
foreign ownership of companies by more than 5 per cent<br />
will be screened.<br />
Since the activities of non-bank financial institutions<br />
and insurance compnanies ar associn ted orincially<br />
wlith financial internediition, it uoul be i na roprite </p>

FOR IG IHV3K~ TI i TE II E7~ L~ S] CTOR<br />
There have been several previous statement of the Government' s<br />
genera7. l policy towcarcs forei Ign investment in the minerals<br />
sector by myself, and by rnf colleague the . Ll. inister for Ul1nerals<br />
and E nergy. On 7 NIov 1975, I t-ibled in Parliament a statement<br />
had previously made at the Tokyo imeetinsg of the Australia-</p>
<p>11.<br />
Japan Ministerial Committee. In addition, guidelines vere set<br />
out in my press statements of 5 Nov 1974 and 12 Uar 1975. The<br />
Minister for Minerals and Energy announced in the Parliament<br />
on 51 Oct 1974 the Government's policy tovy! ards uranium in the<br />
INorthern Territory.<br />
Despite these statements, it appears from various communications<br />
the Government has received that there is still uncertainty<br />
among foreign mining companies as to some of the details of the<br />
Gkovernment's policy on foreign -quity participation in the<br />
mining industry in the future. The purpose of tod-y's statement<br />
is to outline the Government's policy in detail in order to<br />
resolve these uncertainties..<br />
I emphasise, however, the point made earlier in this statement<br />
that it continu. es to be the Government's firm policy to examine<br />
all foreign investment proposals on a case-by-case basis in<br />
order to ensure th-at Australia's resources and industries<br />
are developed in such a way as to bring maximum benefits to<br />
the -uspteroaplliea. n<br />
Chere may, of course, be some proposals which do not meet the<br />
g: uidelines, hut whichIl will have characteristics wihich make<br />
them acceotable to the GoverneAnt. These could include cases<br />
where foreign coi: panies are urible to id significant Australian<br />
participation. Conversely, in the Government's consideration<br />
of specific proposals, there will be a prima facie presumption<br />
that proposals falling within these guidelines will be<br />
accept3. ble to the Government unless there are special<br />
circumstances attaching to the proposal which indicate that<br />
its approval would be against the national interest.<br />
A. Foreign Eq: uity Participation in . Iincral S;: ploration<br />
The Government has reviewed-the administration of its policy<br />
towa-rds foreign equity participation in mineral exploration </p>
<p>12. in the light of thle experievice ; ice rcC h etUbl-hnn<br />
of the 1Foreign Inve-tment Co,-nz-itt,+ ce in June 1974. T'fe consider<br />

The GovernMient viishes to see a significant d'egree of stralian<br />
involvement in mineral ex-olora tion, includ0ingc p. articipation.<br />
with foreign expl1, ora. tion coippanies. '. lthough it ! Azll nbt be<br />

For: Li~ n compa~ nios making co,;-crcial minera,. l discoveries<br />
will be able to proceed to -the development of those discoveries </p>
<p>13. only on the basis of thlie guidelines for Austr-, lin participation<br />
in development projects outlined below. Australian participation<br />
is to be sought on fair and reasonable terms, on the basis<br />
of normal commercial negotiations.<br />
B. Foreign Equity Participation at the Lineral Development<br />
Stage Uranium. The Government's policy objective is to<br />
seek full Australian ownexshi in the development of<br />
uranium deposits. However, in relation to foreign<br />
comPanies which alre dyv Ive di scoveredi, or may in<br />
the future discover, uranium ore bodies on exploration<br />
licences or equivalent exploration titles granted up<br />
S to the date of this statement, the Governm: ent will be<br />
prepared to discuss with those companies their<br />
partici-ation in the development of those ore bodies<br />
on fair and reasonable terms. The development of uranium<br />
ore bodies discovered on exploration licences or equivalent<br />
exploration titles granted after the date of this<br />
w; taitlelr cnbet on the basis of 100 per cent Australian<br />
ownership.<br />
( ii) Other 7inerals. The Govern-ent has as a desired objective<br />
the promotion of Australian equity in-and control of<br />
its mineral resources, and maxinun Austrlian ownership<br />
compatible with ustral. ia's longtcrm capital requirements<br />
and its need for access to mrkets, teclhnology and<br />
know-how. Howtzev er, given the existin high degree of<br />
foreign ownership and control in the ninerils sector,<br />
we recognise that this objective can only be met in a<br />
total sense in the longer term.<br />
a Lmsa jor step to-wards this objective, the Government<br />
will expect proposals-for all new mine-al development </p>
<p>14. projects ( other than those relating to uranium) to<br />
have no more than 50 per cent foreign ownership, and<br />
with the foreign participants having no more than<br />
per cent of the voting strength on the board of the<br />
development compuany. The Governmcnt w'ill not insist<br />
on the Australian participants necessarily being the<br />
technical operators and supervisors cf the project, but<br />
will expect Australian nationals to have a significant<br />
role to play in the managgeent, tecinical operation and<br />
4 control. This procedure will apply to development proposals both<br />
on-store and off-shore.<br />
In considering proposals for foreign equity participation<br />
in mineral development projects, account will be taken<br />
of the relationship between the prospective foreign<br />
participant and the expected main sources of demand for<br />
the output of the development.<br />
SExport Licences<br />
A foreign investment proposal for mineral development which<br />
receives approval from the Government as being not inconsistent<br />
with its fo:-ign investment policies can be assured that it<br />
will not be disadvantaged, in. applications for export licences,<br />
because of the degree of foreign participation in the development.<br />
AC U TI''" I OF REAL ESTATIE BY FOREIGI INTERE77. T<br />
In a statement on 20 March 1973, the then Treasurer, Mr Crean,<br />
drew attentio to the Government's concern about the ownership<br />
and control of Australia's resources and, in particular,<br />
asked overseas interests not to enter into significant commitments<br />
for real estate purchases for the time being. Later that year,<br />
I said that specific proposals involving foreign investment </p>
<p>in real esttte would be examined on their merits. This<br />
case-by-case approach to foreign investment in real estate<br />
has operated since then.<br />
The Government has reviewed its policy, and the administration<br />
of this policy, in this ea in the lighit of the experience<br />
gained in the past two years.<br />
Within the general context of the foreign investment policy,<br />
the Government is particularly concecned to ensure that<br />
Australian real estate does not mme under the ownership<br />
of foreign interests except in certain specific instances.<br />
The detailed principles which will govern the administration<br />
of the Government's policy with regard to foreign investment<br />
in ustralian real estate are set out iq Attachment B to<br />
this statement.<br />
SUB' I " SIFoI P iH1E. ji', I T PCLW: L<br />
41 There a foreign takeover is involved, foreign investors should<br />
continue to submit their proposals to the Treasury in Canberra.<br />
All other proposals should be submitted, in duplicate, either<br />
to the Treasury or to the Reserve Bank.<br />
In the non-tzIkeove: s area, applicants ctn expect to receive<br />
a decision by the Gove-nient. on their proposal within a<br />
maxi. ium -euiod of 90 days from the d'eo of submission of the<br />
proposal. It is expected, however, that most proposals will<br />
be determined in a significantly shorter time. In the<br />
takeovers area the time periods are laid down in the Foreign<br />
T,. eover . ct. </p>
<p>ATTACHMENT A<br />
CRITERIA FOR ASSESSMENT OF FOREIGN IMrSTiENT PROPOSALS<br />
The objectives of the Government's foreign investment policy<br />
are twofold: To ensure that foreign investment proposals are<br />
associated with productive investment which adds<br />
to Australia's real resources and brings benefit<br />
to the nation; and<br />
Whilst continuing to welcome beneficial foreign<br />
capital, to promote, in the longer term Australian<br />
control and maximum practicable Australian<br />
ownership of its industries and resources.<br />
For foreign takeovers the criteria wvill continue to be as<br />
spelt outein the Treasurer's second reading speech on the<br />
Foreign Takeovers Bill 1975. In the non-takeovers area<br />
the Foreign Investment Advisory Committee will, in considering<br />
cases for the purpose of advising the Treasurer whether or<br />
not proposals ares against the national interest, take account<br />
of a wide variety of criteria. The most important of these<br />
are outlined below ( they are similar to those applicable to<br />
takeover proposals). iowever, given the very great variation<br />
between proposals, it should be kept in mind that not only<br />
vill a specific criterion not necessarily apply in a: particular<br />
case but that the weighting given to it may well vary from<br />
case to case.<br />
OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL<br />
In the light of the Governmentts objectives with regard to<br />
Australian control and ownership, the Committee will take<br />
into account: the extent of Australian control ( including<br />
management) and ownership in a project; and<br />
the extent to which the participants have sought<br />
Australian equity participation from either the<br />
private or the public sector.<br />
NET ECONOMIC BENEFITS<br />
The Committee will take into account whether, against the </p>

POLICY ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN AUSTIRALIAN REAL ESTATE<br />
Application of the real estate policy is not restricted to<br />
large invetments, but covers all cases no matter what their<br />
size unless otherwise specified below. The policy covers<br />
ownership of Australian real estate, and therefore applies<br />
to all forms of freehold acquisition. However, it also<br />
applies to certain types of leasehold acquisition. The<br />
policy also applies whether or not the foreign investment<br />
proposal requires exchange control approval. The sale and/ or<br />
transfer of real estate between foreigners is subject to the<br />
real estate policy.<br />
SThe acquisition of an interest in real estate for mining or<br />
quarrying purposes will not be determined in the context of<br />
the Government's real estate policy. Such investments will<br />
be examined, as in the past, in the light of the Government's<br />
policy on foreign investment in mining.<br />
Investment by a foreign interest associated with and made in<br />
order to complete a contractual commitment to acquire or<br />
dovelop real estate made prior to 20 March 1973, will continue<br />
Snot to be affected by the Government's real estate policy.<br />
SThe following categories of real estate investment will, as<br />
Sa general rule, be approved as being in conformity with the<br />
Government's policy:<br />
acquisitions of real estate by life insurance<br />
companies where such , acquisitions represent the<br />
investment of the company's Australian statutory<br />
funds; acquisitions by foreign or overseas controlled<br />
charities or charitable trusts which operate in<br />
Australia for the benefit of Australians;<br />
acquisitions of land-and/ or a residence; a business;<br />
or a farm, for their own ultimate use by:<br />
expatriate Australians who intend to resume<br />
residence in Australia ( up to a total amount<br />
of $ 100,000, with applications for amounts </p>
<p>in excess of this to be considered on their<br />
individual merits);<br />
intending migrants who have been formally<br />
accepted as such by the Australian Government.<br />
transfers of real estate between overseas residents<br />
who are members of the same family, provided that<br />
the grounds for undertaking any such transfer do<br />
not conflict with the Government's policy in this<br />
or other areas;<br />
acquisition of residences by foreign or overseas<br />
controlled companies exclusively for use by their<br />
f<br />
employees resident or temporarily resident and<br />
working in Australia;<br />
S( f) acquisitions of residences for their own or their<br />
irimediate family's use by foreign individuals,<br />
temporarily working or resident in Australia;<br />
S( g) acquisition of offices and residences by foreign<br />
missions for use as official missions or as<br />
residences for staff.<br />
Approval for acquisitions listed in and above<br />
will be conditional on the properties being sold to Australians,<br />
C or other eligible purchasers, when they are no longer being<br />
used for the approved purpose.<br />
Applications for the acquisition of the following types of<br />
real estate will be critically examined, having in mind both<br />
the Government's normal criteria for foreign investment<br />
proposals and the special significance the Government attaches<br />
to foreign acquisition of real estate. ( The normal criteria<br />
are listed in Attachment A to the Prime Minister's statement.)<br />
real estate incidental to other purposes. This may<br />
include factories, shops, hotels, etc or sites<br />
therefore acquired by foreign interests and necessary<br />
for their own use in pursuit of the purpose concerned;<br />
real estate which is in the nature of normal stock-intrade<br />
for real estate developers and which is to be<br />
developed within a specific period and sold to<br />
Australians ( or to foreign interests oligible to<br />
acquire Australian real estate) on completion of </p>
<p>development. Land held by developers for speculative<br />
purposes or for development at some indefinite time<br />
in the future will not be regarded as nor. mal stock-intrade;<br />
properties for long term use for rural purposes and<br />
which can be expected to continue to be available for<br />
such purposes.<br />
All forms of real estate acquisition other than those outlined<br />
in the foregoing ill not normally be approved.<br />
As well as freehold, the term " real estate" for the purposes<br />
of this statement includes leases which provide for profit<br />
sharing arrangements to the foreign lessee, which carry<br />
options to purchase, which provide for a transfer of ownership<br />
in specified circumstances, or which provide for compensation<br />
or payment on surrender of the lease. Leases which do not<br />
include any of these provisions will normally be accepted as<br />
being in conformity with the Government's policy. </p>
