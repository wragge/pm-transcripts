TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH GREG GARY, RADIO 4BG, BRISBANE,<br />
MONDAY, 16 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
GC: The Prime Minister, Paul Keating, visiting our city and joints us for a few<br />
minubes. Nice to see you.<br />
PM: Good, nice tobe here.<br />
GC: You've been out at Skifford school today talking about all kinds of<br />
things. It went well, good to see the kids?<br />
PM-It was a realty nice day and the Premier and I got such a nice welcome<br />
from the kids and we were delighted. The cause of going was tha<br />
Wayne Goss promoted, at the Council of Austrian Governments, the<br />
Premier meeting, the notion of a national Asian languages strategy<br />
which we were happy to join the states with and to join Wayne with and<br />
It will mean that we will be focussing on Japanese, Chinese, Korean and<br />
Indonesian in the first instance in schools in Australia. And, out there at<br />
Stafford today there was a Chinese class which really did tremendous..<br />
It is very interesting to see a bunch of Australian kids speaking Chinese<br />
with a very enthusiastic techer of Chinese.<br />
GC: * You wouldn't have thought it a few years ago would you?<br />
PM: No. And, Wayne tells me there are 100,000 kids in Queensland<br />
studying Asian languages right now. So, Queensland has been the<br />
leader an this and I took the opportunity to congratulate the Premier on<br />
his initiative in this respect because for Australia joining the world I<br />
mean, when I grew up all we knew was basically that Australia belonged<br />
to the. Commonwealth and that sort of thing, that we were part of Europe<br />
and North America and wouldn't have known that much about the </p>
<p>MAY. 16 ' 94 6: 56PM P. 2<br />
2<br />
region, you certainly couldnt have spoken the languages. So, to be<br />
able to do that is going to be a tremendous fillip for this country.<br />
GC: So, when you were out there with the children and you were looking at<br />
their young shiny faces full of potential and prospect and the rest, do<br />
you allow yourself ever to think about our country 40 or 50 years down<br />
the road when they in turn are having their children. And I wonder if you<br />
allow yourself that thought, what kind of county it will be at that time?<br />
PM: I do and much of what I do is about that Thats what motivates me and,<br />
I think, that kids will have a much more interesting life then than we had.<br />
Not that we didn't have good lives, but were they as interesting as they'll<br />
have? And the answer is, no they weren't. Theirs will be far more<br />
interesting and I was just making the point to them today, talking about,<br />
particularly young children, the messages have got to be ones that they<br />
can digest You know, the 747 jumbo jets changed all of our lives.<br />
When I was a teenager the only destinations from Australia were all met<br />
by sea. They were not met by you know, when in half a day being in<br />
North Asia or South-east Asia. And, given that mass transportation is<br />
going to change the opportunities for people to move around this area<br />
of the world are going to be tremendous and in employment and in<br />
incomes. So, it gets back to what I said in the Budget. We want this to<br />
be a high wage, high productivity, culture and the way to get it is<br />
through training education and training.<br />
GC: Just talking about the schools for a moment We've had several calls<br />
this afternoon, Prime Minister, concemed about the story about the<br />
republican kits going into schools.<br />
PM: This is a story in today's Sydney Morning Herald. Somebody has given<br />
a journalist a lead in Canberra, but the Government didn't actually adopt<br />
these proposals. It was for the development of an enhanced<br />
understanding in our educational institutions of the Constitution,<br />
because the Republican Advisory Committee, which was chaired by<br />
Malcolm Tumbull, that Committee discovered that to their chagrin one of<br />
the problems we had was people understanding the Constitution and, in<br />
fact, that is understandable when even an institution like the federal<br />
Cabinet is not mentioned in the Constitution. It mentions, in terms of the<br />
Executive Council, the thing that advises the Governor-General. So,<br />
there is all this code in the Constitution that people don't understand<br />
and a lot of the kids today are disillusioned about public life and politics<br />
and if we can't at least communicate to them things about the<br />
Constitution, well, where are we going to begin.<br />
So, it was a proposal to do that, but the Government didn't adopt it. We<br />
might in the future, but we haven't yet. </p>
<p>MAY. 16 ' 94 6: 57PM 3<br />
GC: Does that relate, some of the things you just said then, to that wonderful<br />
line you dropped with John Laws last week on this radio station, when<br />
you talked about a culture of criticism-Can you expand on that a little?<br />
PM: Well, I think, that the culture of criticism in Australia has got tothe point<br />
that instead of the media standing back saying, look, there are some<br />
good and important things happening here and my point was, that<br />
Australians had earned the recovery, that they had earned the right to<br />
be accredited with meeting the challenge of economic transformation<br />
which they have in the last ten years. We have gone from an Inward<br />
looking, shut little place to an open, aggressive trading country. And<br />
here we are now teaching languages in 3chools and the whole culture is<br />
changing. Yet, instead of that positive compilation being presented to<br />
the public of a nation which is at the leading edge of change, certainly in<br />
western world terms, growing faster than any substantial western<br />
economy, low inflation, big shift in education, big shift in the productive<br />
culture, this is not getting through to the public, it is all niggardly stuff..<br />
Journalists are in the position now where if they present the positive<br />
things, their peer group pressure is such, that somebody says, hang on,<br />
you're going soft on the Government or soft on this Minister or soft on<br />
that Which, I think, is a pity because the public are looking for,<br />
listening for the value. They are listening through the screen of noise to<br />
find the bits they know have got some value to them.<br />
One of the values of doing radio interviews like this is that you ran talk<br />
about these things. But, by the time it gets filtered through the media..<br />
GC: Maybe it is media driven, but I wonder if it is wider than the media in that<br />
Lee Kuan Yew comes to Australia and wants to tell us how to run our<br />
race when, in terms of any country on the planet, we are doing all right.<br />
Is there an underlying lack of confidence perhaps still residing in our<br />
country, that we are prepared to accept that critical assessment all the<br />
time?<br />
PM: I think, if's not so much that we are prepared to accept, we politely<br />
accept it. There is a diference between being polite and uncritical<br />
acceptance by us. One of the things I was pleased to say a week or two<br />
after Mr Lee's visit was that productivity per person in Australia was<br />
much higher, say, than Singapore. much higher. That's productvity per<br />
person. The only measure that is really worth, if you are-tialking about<br />
the productive quality of the countries, the only measure worth having.<br />
The thing is, Australians have got faith in themselves and they believe<br />
that Australia can do, as a nation, good and important things and we<br />
have done them. I mean, in the last ten years Australia has been<br />
through a most profound transformation and it's still going on. Ten<br />
years ago, only three kids in ten were completing school. This year it's<br />
eight in ten. it will soon be nine in ten and by the White Paper changes<br />
we're going to make sure that no kid who drops out of school isn't </p>
<p>MAY. 16 ' 94 6m: 57PM 4<br />
picked up, that the transition from school to work is a good one. All of<br />
those sorts of changes which are primary to a culture which is about<br />
productivity, innovative products, research and development, exports, it<br />
is a shift we've made and the public are enrtitled to get a tick for it.<br />
GC: We only have four minutes ahead of the news. Two questions I want to<br />
put to you. One, our listeners have talked at great length this afternoon<br />
about whati's happening in Rwanda. There is much confusion and<br />
people hear you talking abotithe prospect of us being Involved in the<br />
UIN force. Is that on the cards and if it is, why?<br />
PM: We have been asked by the United Nations if we would be willing to<br />
provide military assistance to ensure the delivery of humanitarian<br />
assistance in Rwanda. No formal security council decision about the<br />
operation has yet been made, so we don't really know what the<br />
character of such an operation would be. Now, in the past we have<br />
given sympathetic consideration to what we might usefully do to help<br />
with difficult humanitarian problems. In this place there have been<br />
200,000 deaths already. Well, it is inconceivable in Australian terms,<br />
but the first thing we need to do is to see the shape of the proposed<br />
operation before we make any decision. But~ essentially we expect the<br />
UNoperation to be aimed at assisting relief operations and not<br />
sepsiriffng the waring parties. So, we wouldn't be in there trying to say,<br />
hang on, we're going to be the referee here, but rather assisting in the<br />
humanitarian operation. So. we don't know what the UN is proposing<br />
and at this stage we haven't made a decision about it although we have<br />
responded to the UIN in similar situations around the world.<br />
GC: There remains a risk none the less doesn't there. We had a caller a litte<br />
earlier about to go to Rwanda in a couple of weeks from now, said he<br />
had been in Somalia and elsewhere and whilst our motives can be<br />
applauded, when you get on the ground over there the bottom line<br />
question, is it worth risking one Australian life to help these people who<br />
seem not too keen to help themselves?<br />
PM: Well, we either subscribe to the notion that we have an international<br />
order and the governing body is the United Nations and support that<br />
body or we don't. As you know, the same argument could have been<br />
mounted in the mid-west of the United States when same mother said of<br />
her child, why should I send him to the South-Pacific? Why should they<br />
fight in the Solomon Islands or anywhere else?<br />
GC: But we knew who the good guys and the bad guys were.<br />
PMV: I know, it was a more obvious thing. But I mean, in these things, I think,<br />
there has to be a view about Australia's role in the world and we are very<br />
careful about the conditions under which we commit people as were in<br />
Somalia, as we've been in the Middle East. But, good things do </p>
<p>MAY. 16 ' 94 6: 58PM<br />
happen. We've been involved with UN operations as part of peace<br />
keeping forces in the Middle East, we've done that long enough now to<br />
see the Israelis and the Palastinians come to a peace accord which will<br />
change the character of that area. So, we are either in the business of<br />
helping and seeing better world outcomes or we're not. But, again,<br />
these are on-balance judgements and we look, at each time, the nature<br />
of the operation.<br />
GC: We are a better and larger and more decent country than sometimes we<br />
take the time to think of ourselves aren't we?<br />
PM: Well, we play a larger role in the world. Always, I think, we have played<br />
a role in the world larger than our relative size and that is a compliment<br />
to Australians I think, the fact that we can take it I mean, look at the<br />
settlement in Cambodia as a case in point in our own area.<br />
GC: South Africa. Just talking about South Africa I was faxed a, I think, a<br />
head line from the New Zealand Herald today and it ran this story the<br />
former Deputy of white supremacist Dr Juan Smith in the church of the<br />
creator organisation, is understood to be leaving South Africa for<br />
Australia. South African sources said yesterday that Mr Youhan Grieff?<br />
had applied for residency in Australia and that we might be already on<br />
his way here having left South Africa Should we be letting people<br />
like this into our country?<br />
PM: I don't know whether he's applied or he hasn't, but we don't, generally,<br />
try and import into this country extreme views and, I think, that is a pretty<br />
good policy.<br />
GC: So, if it was likely this fellow turned up on the front door?<br />
PM: I can't say. I'd have to find out all about it.<br />
GC: OK, in the meantime your Canterbury Bulldogs sit atop the premiership<br />
ladder. They are looking good.<br />
PM: Thats right, they are doing really well and the other side I support<br />
Collingwood in Victoria are in the middle of the field and rising. So, I'm<br />
going for the yearly double, annual double.<br />
GC: It's good to see you. Next time you visit come by and we'll talk some<br />
more.<br />
PM: OK, Greg and thanks very much.<br />
ends </p>
