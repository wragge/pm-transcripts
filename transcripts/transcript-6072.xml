b,) U) STKRA L1, A<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
For media Wednesday, 30 March 1983<br />
Traditionally Easter is a time when Australians take the opportunity<br />
for holidays or travel.<br />
Unfortunately, it has also been one of the worst periods on the<br />
nation's roads.<br />
over the next few days all Australians can contribute to avoiding<br />
the tragedy and suffering caused by the road toll.<br />
It is encouraging to note the recent success of efforts to reduce<br />
the road toll.<br />
Random breath testing, for example, has had a significant impact.<br />
More than 100 people are alive in NSW alone, because of random<br />
breathtesting, who-might otherwise have died on our roads in the<br />
last few months.<br />
Tougher traffic law enforcement, wider application of random breath<br />
testing and effective TV advertising campaigns have combined to<br />
assist in reducing death on our roads.<br />
But in the end the answer to the problem lies with motorists.<br />
Australians do not need long lectures on using the roads carefully.<br />
However, I would like to make three important requests to those<br />
driving at Easter:<br />
be patient and don't take unnecessary risks during your<br />
journey. An extra hour or so travelling will still leave<br />
plenty of time over the long-weekend;<br />
don't drive after having too much to drink. The risks are too great;<br />
make sure everyone in your car uses a seat belt.<br />
They are proven life-savers.<br />
Of prime concern at this time are our children.<br />
Whether they be passengers, cyclists or pedestrians, we owe it to<br />
them to set a good example, and to protect them by all driving<br />
responsibly. People in a mature, caring society can act in ways to demonstrate<br />
a concern for others as well as themselves.<br />
I believe Australia is such a society. </p>
