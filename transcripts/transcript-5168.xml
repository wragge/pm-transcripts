P RI AAE MDINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 16 OCTOBER 1979<br />
ADDRESS TO ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING<br />
IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE, SYDNEY<br />
I would like to say something about some of the world trading<br />
problems as I see them at the moment and about what Australia<br />
seeks to do principally in looking after our own atfairs and<br />
hopefully also i~ n trying to contribute to a more responsible<br />
international economic community.<br />
We all know that the vnrld's economies are interdependent and<br />
that what happens in the United States sooner or later tends<br />
to affect us all.. Thus what happens in Europe tends to affect<br />
all major countries, all industrialise d countries and<br />
developing countries.<br />
There have been very many difficulties in world trade over<br />
most of the last decade. Since the early 1970' s growth in<br />
trade has been about four per cent a year. In the previous<br />
years growth was something like eight per cent a year.<br />
Those two figures alone illustrate imuch of the problems of<br />
high unemployment and low growth in world marki-ets. That low<br />
growth in world trade and low growth in world markets has<br />
quite obviously coincided with the period of high and deeply<br />
imbedded inflation, which is still with us and which in<br />
present circumstances shows no signs of abating.<br />
This poses problems for all countries both for developed<br />
countries and for developing. I do not know that we have<br />
addressed our national policies to these problems as<br />
adequately as we could. We certainly haven't done as much*<br />
about that as we ought to do.<br />
The first question I would like to raise is how do we return<br />
to a vigorous growth in the world trade how do we get<br />
back to that eight per cent a year, instead of the four per cent<br />
that we have had for far too long? Secondly, regardless of<br />
whether we can get back to that eight per cent or not, what<br />
are the prospects for a resource and energy-exporting country<br />
such as Australia?<br />
Obviously getting inflation down is a paramount, a first<br />
priority. But a lot of people have said much about that.<br />
There has not always been adequate action in national policies.<br />
./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
We all know that high inflation destroys confidence. It<br />
destroys profitability. It creates uncertainty. It reduces<br />
market growth. It reduces the flows of world trade, leads to<br />
new and increasing and more perfidious forms of protection,<br />
and leads to higher unemployment which can have severe social<br />
and economic consequences in a number of countries.<br />
The consequence of inflation endangering the social system is<br />
a real one. William Miller, Secretary of the United States'<br />
Treasury, said only a short while ago and this is in a<br />
country where inflation is now at an annual rate of 14 per cent-<br />
" Inflation is a clear and present danger. It struck at our<br />
at-ion's vitality. If it is-not checked then it will threaten<br />
our democratic system itself. We must attack the root causes.<br />
and totally eradicate the basic sources. What is needed is a<br />
comprehensive, sustained and total war against inflation"<br />
The rhetoric is easy, and the rhetoric can be found in many<br />
countries around the world. But in what countries do we find<br />
that total war? There is no harm in pointing out that<br />
two major and significant countries have been more successful<br />
than many: Germany and Japan.<br />
At international meetings whether the international conference<br />
in Jamaica, UNCTAD V in Manila, the Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government meeting in Lusaka, or more conventionally, the<br />
International Monetary Fund or the OECD, they will all accept<br />
that inflation must come down. They will all give<br />
prescriptions for getting inflation down. But inflation has gone<br />
on through this last decade at high and often rising rates,<br />
increasing in many countries as it has been at the moment. We<br />
know what we need to do to get it down. But how many countries<br />
commit themselves to the policies that will do what we know<br />
needs to be done.<br />
Van Lennup, of the OECD has spoken often enough about positive<br />
adjustment policies a somewhat misleading term, because<br />
what he really means is: " Governments keep out. Don't subsidise<br />
wages. Don't subsidise inefficient industries. Don't have<br />
protection that is too high. Just let the market forces work.<br />
Allow the normal re-structuring that will take place if<br />
governments don't get in the way. Let it all occur and then<br />
world trade will start to grow again and industry will start to<br />
be efficient again. There will be vigour and life, in world<br />
economies again". He preaches and he talks and people say<br />
and they believe him. But governments still do not act.<br />
I do not think it is necessarily only governments' fault,<br />
because sometimes when they try to act, the beneficiaries of<br />
the present system of inefficiency so often say: " No, you must<br />
not, it will hurt too much. We know that what you are trying<br />
to do is right, but it would be much better to forget all about<br />
it and to go along as we are at the present time". / 3 </p>
<p>Unless we all realise that defeating inflation is a first<br />
priority I do not believe there will be a significant liftin<br />
the growth of world trade. That obviously has very<br />
considerable long-term consequences for the steel industry<br />
and for other major industries right around the world.<br />
Also, I believe, that even though we need to get inflation<br />
down and even though that is a paramount need a pre-requisitegetting<br />
inflation down alone in the circumstances of 1979,<br />
1980 or beyond, may not be enough to return to the levels<br />
of growth that we knew in the latter years of 1940, 1950s,<br />
the 1960s and into the very early 1970s.<br />
If that is so, we need to address something more fundamental,<br />
more significant and ask ourselves what has happened, what<br />
is different between 1949 perhaps and 1979. It is worth<br />
looking at what has happened over the years. We need to<br />
see our present circumstance against the historical background<br />
of the years since the last World War.<br />
From the mid-40s to the early 170s the very early 170s<br />
there was a dramatic growth in world trade; one of the<br />
greatest sustained periods of expansion in markets, growth in<br />
trade, that the world had ever seen. What were the reasons<br />
for that! a depression before the war; the war itself;<br />
the enormous pent-up consumer demand; the M. arshall Plan;<br />
new technology; the re-building of Europe. All of this<br />
led to a sustained upsurge in growth and incomes of a kind<br />
that the world had never previously seen.<br />
It was not only the developed world that took advantage of<br />
this. This was also the period in which more developing<br />
countries experienced some lift in their standard some<br />
improvement from the abject poverty that they had known<br />
for so long and which so many still know as the only way<br />
of life; not necessarily entirely from their fault or<br />
from their circumstance.<br />
By the mid-1970s, for a variety of reasons perhaps-, thSe<br />
consumer boom itself which did much to fuel this growth<br />
in-incomes, tended to be running down. other things also<br />
were happening. This was a time when inflation began to<br />
be deeply imbedded in Europe and in North America. It was<br />
also at a time when the expectations that governments could<br />
go on providing and meeting all requests put to governments:<br />
that governments had ani inexhaustible supply of funds, that<br />
Keynesian policies had made deficit financing responsible.<br />
All of these things led to governments following policies<br />
that they ought not to have followed from about 1972-73<br />
onwards, and led to governments believing themselves<br />
that they could still meet the wishes of their people<br />
when they asked for things, or industries when they asked<br />
for things. o./ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Instead of saying governments themselves acquiesced, printed<br />
more money, and inflation becamie more deeply embedded.<br />
Trade and market growth began to shrink.<br />
I do not believe governments then understood the economic<br />
realities that began to unfold. Perhaps they understand now,<br />
but policies did not flow as a result, as I believe they should.<br />
High inflation was thus built into too many economies.<br />
We have also had two oil crises: in 1973-74 oil prices quadrupled.<br />
There was a significant increase in the already worsening<br />
,. inflation position. European inflation, OECD inflation, went.<br />
from 8 per cent to 13 per cent. As a result of that oil<br />
crisis, adequate energy policies were required, but much, if not<br />
most of the world ignored the warning. It has happened once: it<br />
has not happened before: it will not happen again -that was<br />
the attitude of too many people.<br />
By 1978 inflation had been painfully ground back to 8 per cent<br />
still very high, still much too high but with people perhaps<br />
beginning to think " 8 per cent is endurable". But 8 per cent<br />
was probably too high to achieve the kind of market growth that<br />
most of our industries need.<br />
Then came a second oil crisis not as severe as the first<br />
but enough with other factors to put OECD inflation once again up<br />
to 13 per cent, leading to reduced expectations of market growth,<br />
reduced expectations for employment and the solution of economic<br />
problems of a kind that concern many countries at this present time.<br />
In these circumstances, there are increased pressures on<br />
governments for intervention, for more protection of one kind or<br />
another. Despite the trade negotiations that have just concluded,<br />
the pressures for renewed protection, for new kinds of protectionlevies<br />
and wage subsidies and export subsidies, special protective<br />
devices, subsidised loans and all the rest, voluntary restraint<br />
agreements which even have been visited upon BHP all of these<br />
things helped to add to the rigidity in economies and industries<br />
and made it harder to get rid of the inef ficiencies in f rom<br />
our systems.<br />
* Thus, we have a new kind of restraint to ' investment<br />
and development, because what we are talking about provides a<br />
restraint, a roadblock, to efficient investment, to efficient<br />
development, to efficient profit-making. But then, over the<br />
same period, especially during a period of high growth, we<br />
had many concerns environmental concerns, restrictive trade<br />
practice legislation, foreign investment policies, national<br />
investment policies all of which tended to put impediments of<br />
one kind or another to profitable enterprise; impediments that just<br />
were not there in 1949, which have grown over the years when people<br />
came to take growth and progress for granted because the world<br />
went through the best and most sustained period of growth and<br />
development that it had over about 30 years after the war. </p>
<p>With all these impediments now within our systems, sometimes<br />
requiring three, four or five years for an environmental<br />
approval, where before a board could make a decision in the course<br />
of a day or a week but now you have to get through government<br />
arrangements which might take three years or more.<br />
Against that kind of background, even if inflation does come<br />
down, is there then going to be an adequate growth rate to<br />
enable a return to the level of profitability, the growth in<br />
national economies, that is necessary and desirable if world<br />
economic problems are to be put aside.<br />
There is a growing international awareness of the danger that<br />
getting inflation down alone may not be adequate. The<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Lusaka has decided<br />
to establish a worldwide group of experts to study this problem<br />
and offer some suggestions for national policy-making<br />
which might be an aid to a greater rate of investment and<br />
market growth in countries around the world.<br />
What then are the prospects for a country like Australia<br />
14 million people, a middle-ranking power if we are going to be<br />
in a period of high inflation and low market growth. Obviously,<br />
more rapid market growth helps a country like our About<br />
per cent of our GDP is traded, but I do nt thin we<br />
can look forward to this rapid growth not as a certainty.<br />
It may be remote. What then do we do in a difficult world trading<br />
scene? There is a great deal that a country like Australia<br />
can do, is doing, intends to do. We are one of the few<br />
countries that can get through the 1980' s without difficulty<br />
no matter what the world scene may be.<br />
Over the last two to three years, Australia has, through world<br />
trading negotiations, with Europe, with the United States<br />
and with Japan, established a network of bilateral trade<br />
agreements on a basis that I believe gives our exporters greater<br />
securitL. y than they have ever had. Obviously, the trade agreements<br />
are beneficial in both directions. A good deal of energy<br />
and effort has gone into securing access to markets. That<br />
is important indeed.<br />
Then again, we have paid particular attention to trade with<br />
developing countries of Asia and the Pacific because in our<br />
experience it is trade with these countries that has served<br />
us in very good stead, as we found it more difficult to trade<br />
with the more affluent and large markets in Europe because of<br />
European Economic Community policies. If it had not been for<br />
the diversion of our trade to countries such as Korea, Taiwan,<br />
Japan, the ASEAN countries, to China itself, Australia would have<br />
been in very real difficulty.<br />
There is another message that comes out of this changed trading<br />
relationship that Australia has experienced, because it is not<br />
just our exports to these countries that have grown. Our trade<br />
both ways has grown with the newly industrialising countries,<br />
the countries of the Pacific and South East Asia, very dramatically<br />
indeed. / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
ASEAN exports to us have increased by about 30 per cent a<br />
year over the last 10 years. Our exports to their countries<br />
have also been growing at a rapid rat.-, although not quite<br />
as rapidly as that. The prospect for rapid market growth in the<br />
newly industrialising countries'is a very real one, and one which<br />
I think the older industrialised countries ought to grasp<br />
eagerly. They should not see this tv-ade as something to be<br />
shunned or feared, because wages the--, e are lower and they<br />
would therefore be more competitive. If opportunities are<br />
grasped, trade both ways will grow very greatly. Markets in<br />
newly industrialising countries will ! e there for the products<br />
and the goods, of the older industrial countries, for the countries<br />
of Europe and North America if we all. have but the wit to grasp<br />
and take the opportunities instead of fearfully saying; " No,<br />
we must not do it, we want selective safeguards. We want<br />
to be able to say goods from these ccuntries can be excluded<br />
from us because we are frightened of their competitive power".<br />
I think if we seize the opportunities there is nothing to be<br />
fearful of, and much to be gained by a greater rate of economic<br />
take-off in a greater number of developing countries. We ought<br />
to look to see what could be done to . promote that.<br />
Australia, in this part of the world with our trading experience,<br />
has some reason to look forward with confidence. But there are<br />
other reasons why we can look forwar with a great degree of<br />
confidence. We are a net energy expxrter. We have very<br />
significant reserves of coal, of nat'; ral gas and of uranium,<br />
as you know. Coupled with Australia' s mineral resources,<br />
there are opportunties open for us t'at may be not open to all<br />
other countries.<br />
The $ 4 billion worth of investment i: aluminium and aluminium<br />
processing taking place in Australia right at this time, could<br />
not have occured if it were not for the adequate reserves<br />
of bauxite, perhaps even more important, adequate reserves of<br />
relatively cheap coal-based electricity which has been<br />
important and necessary for that processing and development.<br />
I think over the next decade and bevyond more of that kind<br />
will be put together in Australia, mcking use of our resources<br />
and of Australian energy, and achieving a greater degree of<br />
processing within this country. Tha-will not come by some<br />
Government decree, Government direct. ve. We do not work that way.<br />
But if through the normal commercial processes, it seems that<br />
is the best path to take, then there are some things that a<br />
Government can do to stimulate it, t encourage it. I believe<br />
that is one of the directions in which Australia will move and<br />
one of the reasons why we will be abLe to attract to ourselves<br />
perhaps a greater share of world investment in resources and<br />
in energy projects, than otherwise might take place.<br />
The other reason why we might well alttract a greater share<br />
of world investment than would otherw. ise occur is because<br />
I believe our economic policies will and are, attracting that<br />
kind of investment. We are determined to maintain a downward<br />
thrust on inflation. Our deficit as. a percentage of gross<br />
domestic product will be under 2 per cent this year. That is<br />
less than most OECD countries on a C-rmparable basis. It is<br />
certainly much less than has been the case in Australia for<br />
a long while. </p>
<p>-7<br />
It is still too high, but we can work at it and we will get<br />
it down further.<br />
Government expenditure in real terms-, has been held static<br />
over the last four years, despite much increased sums-goi ng<br />
into defence and despite an ageing population in spite<br />
of it being a young country our social security payments<br />
have also increased. Quite plainly, such technical matters<br />
as money supply growth have got to be rigidly controlled as<br />
they are, and as they will continue to be.<br />
When we took office, when my Government took office, our i nflation<br />
was about 5 points above the OECD average. It is now-about<br />
3 or 4 points below the OECD average and we intend to keep it<br />
that way. The more the OECD gets-its inflation rate down, so<br />
it makes it tougher for us to stay below the average of the<br />
OECD countries. But, the better I like it, because we intend<br />
to keep it below that average to enhanceAustralia's competitive<br />
position.<br />
Against that background, putting together the economic policies<br />
that we pursue, Australian resources and Australian energy I<br />
have said nothing about Australian initiative and enterprise<br />
but putting those things together, I believe the future for a<br />
country such as Australia is a good one. If any of you have a few<br />
dollars you would like to invest in this country, it would be our<br />
intention that you would make better profits on those dollars<br />
than dollars you invest in your own. That is not meant to be<br />
offensive. I would hope it would become a fact of life.<br />
So, there are many unresolved problems. Trade growth is slow,<br />
inflation is too high. There is, in some cases, exchange rate<br />
instability. There are uncertainties in energy. But I believe<br />
despite all that, I look to this country to the 1980' s with<br />
enormous enthusiasm and with enormous confidence, because the<br />
policies we have pursued for nearly four years are starting<br />
to pay of f. I think there are a few investors in Europe and in<br />
Britain and in the United States who have made that very same<br />
judgement, because they have been voting with their dollars,<br />
their Pounds and Deutschmarks and Yen and all the rest, in<br />
investment in this country. Again, we intend to maintain<br />
the policies that will make sure those investments are soundly<br />
based so that the dollars that have come will be followed<br />
by more.<br />
The advantages we have are real. Maybe it is because<br />
we are.. a lucky country, but it is up to us to use the<br />
resources that are available to us and to do it wisely.<br />
