JOINT PRESS STATEMENT ON THE COMMITTEE TO ADVISE ON<br />
POLICIES FOR MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, and the<br />
Minister for Industry and Commerce, Senator Roben. t_ Cotton,<br />
today announced that Volumes III and IV of the report<br />
of the Committee to Advise on Policies for Manufacturing<br />
Industry, the Jackson Committee, had been tabled'in the<br />
Parliament. The main part of the Committee's report Volume I<br />
had been released on 30 October 1975. Volumes III and<br />
IV contained studies commissioned by the Committee in the<br />
course of it,* s work. Volume II of the Committee's report<br />
containing statistical material would be released as soon<br />
as copies were available from the printer, which was<br />
0 expected i-aabout two weeks.<br />
The.-. eight studies in Volume III deal with:<br />
* industrial Policy in certain O. E. C. D. countries<br />
the Industries Assistance Commission's approach to the<br />
development of industries<br />
* financing manufacturing<br />
* foreign-owned manufacturing-firms in Australia<br />
* European policies regarding large foreign companies<br />
worker participation in Australia<br />
worker participation and policy integration in<br />
Yugoslavia and Romania<br />
* communication between the Australian and State Governments<br />
on industry policies. / 2 </p>
<p>Volume IV contains studies dealing with the economic<br />
and social aspects of seven selected industries.<br />
Copies of the reports could be ordered through any<br />
Commonwealth Publications and Inquiry Centre.<br />
The Government trusted that publication of the volumes<br />
would help to promote continuing discussion of the many<br />
important issues concerning manufacturing industry raised<br />
in the Committee's main report. These issues would also<br />
have to be considered in the preparation of the White<br />
Paper which would be presented to the Parliament in the<br />
Budget Session.<br />
The White ; Paper would provide a basis on which industry<br />
could plan ahead with greater certainty as to the nature<br />
and direction of Government policy. Interested parties<br />
had previously been invited to forward submissions to<br />
Senator Cotton setting out their views on matters to<br />
be covered in the White Paper. At present relatively<br />
few submissions had been received and it was hoped<br />
that many more would be forthcoming before 1 July 1976.<br />
