FOR PRESS P. M4. No. 12/ 1966<br />
SUCCESS OF DAY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Australia has taken decimals in its stride<br />
and Australians can feel proud of the way in which they<br />
have co-operated to make this a smooth transition.<br />
I have been receiving reports today from the<br />
Chairman of the Decimal Currency Board, Sir J,. Valter Scott,<br />
the Reserve Bank and the Commonwealth Treasury. The<br />
enquiries made by these three sources have covered a very<br />
wide field and they have all been able to report to me that<br />
the smoothness of the changeover has exceeded our best<br />
expectations. As anticipated, there have been a few isolated<br />
and minor problems but nothing has emerged so far to cause<br />
any real concern. Satisfactory reports have been flowiing<br />
in from banks, retailers, transport services and all sections<br />
of the community in all of the States.<br />
Based on the first day's results, we can have<br />
full confidence that Australia will readily adapt itself<br />
to its new currency and soon reap the many substantial<br />
benefits that we expect to flow from this more efficient<br />
money system.<br />
