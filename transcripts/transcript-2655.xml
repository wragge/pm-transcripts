FOR PRESS: PM. No. 76/ 1972<br />
OIL INDUSTRY DISPUTE<br />
MEETING OF PARLIAMENT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. William<br />
McMahon, C. i. M. P.<br />
On Sunday night in a national broadcast on the oil<br />
industry dispute, I made an appeal to the men on strike to<br />
return to work so that their outstanding claims could be<br />
dealt with by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.<br />
I said then that if the men did not go back to<br />
work, I would arrange for Parliament to be called together<br />
this week. Whilst I am still hopeful that all the men will<br />
return to work, I am, in accordance with my previous<br />
announcement, requesting the Presiding Officers to take<br />
steps to call the Parliament together for Friday, 4 August,<br />
at 10.30 a. m.<br />
CANBERRA, 1 August, 1972. _ j </p>
