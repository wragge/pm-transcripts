MINISTER FOR AIR<br />
27th July, 1962.<br />
My dear Prime Minister,<br />
I refer to your letter of 27th July and to our<br />
conversation this afternoon.<br />
It is clear that I have formed an opinion of<br />
the nature of our interests in the negotiations for<br />
British entry into the Common Market which differs in<br />
significant respects from that of my senior colleagues<br />
in the Cabinet. I appreciate the points you make and<br />
tender my resignation accordingly.<br />
In doing so I should like to emphasise that the<br />
difference is essentially one of perspective and emphasis,<br />
and that I support fully the efforts which you and Mr.<br />
McE'en have been and are making to safeguard the interests<br />
of those of our industries most likely to be directly<br />
affected. This episode in no way diminishes my high personal<br />
regard and feelings of friendship for you and our colleagues.<br />
You may rely confidently upon my support for yourself and<br />
the team as in the past.<br />
With kindest regards, Yours sincerely,<br />
Leslie Bury.<br />
( L. H. Eo Bury)<br />
The Right Honourable RoG. Menzies,<br />
C. Ho, MoPo,<br />
Prime Minister, </p>
