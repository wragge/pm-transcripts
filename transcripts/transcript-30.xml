" TO 700 ' BUSINESSMEW-AT FINqNEYlSAUDITORIUM,<br />
BRISBANE, OW-FRIDAY. JULY 22, 1955.<br />
This . is, a very remarkable gathering,<br />
because . I have-. just . been. considering. whether!* I have<br />
ever been . called upon to'speak to-so-many people at~ a<br />
single dinner~ anywhere in the world before. ! And with<br />
some difficulty,. I have.. dredged~ up out.. of nmy. memory<br />
an occasion on which, through -somebody'-s courteous : error,<br />
I made. a speech-in London to.. a thousand people. at. a<br />
dinner.-That! is. the only occasion that I can-thinkaof,<br />
in alongand mis-spent life , which : excels in-numbers<br />
this-very remarkable gathering,<br />
Ken Morris is here tonight, . and: I jist<br />
want to say-in.. the simplest possible words,: that.. * 1<br />
a veteran in these affairs. I don't want you to think<br />
that: I. am doddering~ into the grave, bit. I. havereached<br />
the . ripe. age of. 60. . want to tell.. you that Ken Morris<br />
Dleases-me-beyond. words. There is nothing that I can<br />
dio for him that I won' t do for him, It is a'* splendid<br />
thing. to have, particularly here . and in State politics..<br />
somebody who has enthusiasm: -who is full of hope or:<br />
as he would say,-as he has said to me full of<br />
realism, and who goes out to win, -And you know, Sir:<br />
a good deal of my political life,. when I've heard . State<br />
politics discussed in Queensland I have heard people,<br />
actually .1 have heard-them shrug their shoulders,. and<br />
say-, ' Oh well, you know'. And if there-is anything<br />
I detest it-is these fellows who say:. ' You I4now'. I1<br />
have had a-lot of experience of this kind of thing.<br />
May I tell you that ' I can rehnember as vivid~ ty~ asany,<br />
living man,, how. in 1943 we were told that . Labour was<br />
in office in Canberra almost forever. And-in 1949<br />
they,-had the bi~ ggest defeat that any party had-had-for a<br />
long, long time, You don' t win political campaigns </p>
<p>by. being. an. apologist. ' You don't win political<br />
campaigns by . not being too clear : about what. youtstand<br />
for. You. don t win political campaigns -by going<br />
around: andijoining the Proqhets of Gloom, because the<br />
Prophe _ ait_ at_. ar__ te largest<br />
religious oanisationin Australia. But you wn<br />
campaigns: b y saying -' I. am going to win. : And. when<br />
the Leader says that, then it just depends on how<br />
many people can rally around and say. ' Right; and we<br />
are going to win with you'<br />
Now, I commend my friend, Mr. Morris,<br />
to. you. He has: been down in Canberra. I halve had<br />
the benefit of: a number of long discussions with him<br />
I want tosay to you, ' I believe in this man', And<br />
if everybody in this room tonight and you. are the<br />
most influential collection of men who could be<br />
brought together in this State if everybody in this<br />
room believes in him, believes in my friend<br />
Frank Nicklin,. whose absence I so much regret tonight,<br />
then ; they can win. I know all about the question of<br />
whether the. electorates. are so organised, but I hope<br />
you will allow me to sdy that I never come into<br />
Queensland myself, without remembering that in 1949,<br />
in 1951, in 1953. and in' 1954; this* State of'Queensland<br />
was my sheet anchor. Butfirst of all, may Isay a word or<br />
two about this great and historic meeting that is<br />
occurring jn Geneva. I don't know. what it is going.<br />
to do any ' ore than you do. I don't know what the<br />
result of it is going to be any more than any of those<br />
who are taking part in it, because the more responsibility<br />
you have on international affairs the<br />
less likely are you to be dogmatic in advance about<br />
what's going to occur. But I just want to put one<br />
or two thoughts. into your minds about this conference.<br />
The first of them is this; that one of<br />
the great troubles in our time, in modern times, is<br />
that it is. almost-impossible for the heads of </p>
<p>Governments to. have genuinely private conversations with<br />
each other. That is something that is worth remembering<br />
They decide to meet. They have scores and scores of<br />
technical . advisers The Press of the . world, the wireless<br />
of the world. are all organised.. The people are<br />
fascinated: by it. And the result is that discussions<br />
which if they. are to be for the greatest good of man._<br />
kind, ought-to occur quite privately, occur under the<br />
fierce glare of publicity. And that,, I. think : is one<br />
of the unfortunate things of our time, Just imagine,<br />
the four men sitting down. together nobody . else present.<br />
With no. agenda. saying to.' B. Now look,. we<br />
are in great trouble What are your real troubles. about. us?<br />
And the other one reciprocating. and saying: What. are<br />
your: real troubles about us?' And they -talk as men may<br />
talk. Not to the recordc . not for the audience : but they<br />
talk to each other as any four of: us tonight might talk<br />
to each other sitting in a private room. chatting about<br />
some matters about which we had disagreed,<br />
rAnd that unfortunately, appears nowadays<br />
to be almost completely impossible. And the tragedy of<br />
that is, that the moment you amke. a negotiation between<br />
nations or between men. a matter of'public debate you<br />
must accept the consequences qf public debate.<br />
Public debate clarifies differences, it<br />
cry tallises differences . but . so far as I know. it never<br />
resolves differences, Because when you golinto. a: debate<br />
you go into it to win. That is the essence of. debate,<br />
And you don't normally go into a debate unless you know<br />
quite clearly what you have in your own mind, what your<br />
views are and how wrong the other man's views may be,<br />
I think public debate is a useful thing in Parliament<br />
because it lets the ordinary voter know what the issues<br />
are. It may be a very useful thing on an occasion like<br />
this, . because it may serve to let the world know what<br />
the differences~ are. So it-is useful solong as we<br />
remember that public debate does not resolve differences.<br />
And I-am hoping very much that. when-the. good things that<br />
will undoubtedly come out of this meeting-have come, when<br />
ice has. been broken,. when people have ibecome : accustomed </p>
<p>-4-<br />
to talking to each other: in. a friendly way, when there<br />
is more understanding and more knowledge, I am hoping<br />
that. after that, there may be private discussions,<br />
quite: informal discussions, with no publicity which<br />
will enable problems to be looked at from the point<br />
of view of resolving them and not from the point of<br />
view of expounding them. I hope I make my view on<br />
that matter perfectly plain.<br />
In the meantime, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
so far as we are concerned, in this remote corner of<br />
the world, all we can do in the old words of Holy<br />
Writ is ' to watch and pray'. These talks can't<br />
produce peace . nor; indeed, can they hope to resolve<br />
particular differences which require immense technical<br />
examination. But I believe they can open a door that<br />
the world has wanted to see opened I believe that<br />
they can. roduce among heads of Government and among<br />
those immediately associated with them, a new spirit<br />
of friendliness maybe that is too great a word to<br />
use but a new: spirit of understanding. And a new<br />
feeling that well I have met the other man and I<br />
know him. I have had myself, in my own very small way,<br />
a vast experience in international discussions and I<br />
have never engaged-in one that-was half so useful as the<br />
private talk with the head of-some other Government a<br />
private talk with some Minister, the kind of talk in<br />
which you can, -in the metaphorical expression; can let<br />
your hair down, and get to understand what it is and<br />
what the trouble is about. And the only things that<br />
have happened which I would regard as effective<br />
internationally in my own second term as Prime Minister<br />
have been brought about by private talks when you met<br />
as man to man and talked personally and not for. the<br />
benefit of. a gallery. And, therefore, all-I-want to'say to<br />
you about this great conference, and it is a great<br />
conference, this is quite historic, is that we are not<br />
to expect too much. It is a very human temptation,<br />
isn't it, to think that after a week or ten days of<br />
talks we will be given the complete recipe for </p>
<p>universal peace. Now don't. let' s have any such ideas.<br />
Peace is not producedby'resolutions. Peace: is. not<br />
produced by-some article of protocol. Peace is prod uced<br />
byanattitude of mind ln the nation': s concern. We will<br />
have peace in this . world when the people. of the Soviet<br />
Unioh, the people of China, the people wherever they may.<br />
be.. have'--th. same instinctive desire for peace. as we<br />
have and have Ithe power to make that desire effective in<br />
governingfrces. And, therefore,. don't let's be over-..<br />
. simple in our minds on this matterand-say Wel. l, this<br />
will produce-some resolution which will mean-that we-can<br />
beat our : swords iinto ploughshaies'.. Bec4ause ! to; expect<br />
such athing from one meeting,! fronvthe', first-meeting,<br />
would, 1I think, ; be : a -fatal erro..<br />
: In -the ! second place, don.' t : let us fall<br />
-int6 the.: i rror, ladies : and gentlemen,. of ithinking-that if<br />
much: advancei s made i in u; siderStanding, : and that; is'the object<br />
of-the conference uin.' Geneva, that; the result may be that<br />
, we will abandon our def. ence programmes : and give ourselves<br />
a: defence holiday. That, let me remindyou, is : some--<br />
thing that has ialmost happened before. Between the two<br />
. wars-there were lots of people who'said: ' Well, we-have<br />
the ' League of. Nations, ' and because we Wave the) League of<br />
Nations1: : all is -well. We -have collective ' security.'<br />
And la -lot of peopl'e -said: ' We-ll, colle-ctive security : i-s<br />
security'.. Whereas-, collective security merely meant<br />
. something-that had: to . be ' backed ' by ' strength -in the<br />
interests of common seturity. : And because that wasn'-t<br />
. understood:, w e haduin this world between-the two wars<br />
the'spectacle of the victors in-thefirst. World. War.<br />
the British Empire: as it was,: I-am happy to. remember,<br />
still called:.. the United Statesof -America -France.<br />
What happened? ' The . victors in-the . war proceeded-to<br />
disarm-each other , by agreement, but not the ienemy.<br />
The result-of this illusion this ! amotional cloud cuckoo<br />
land, inwhich we lived -for'the -seCond-tie rin this<br />
century we Iwent . within ace of utter -defeat -in a war.<br />
Now, we must-remember-these things.<br />
You may nbver confidently,-and you certainly may never<br />
comfortably, argue international problems ' from -weakness. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
It is our-duty-to be strong, and I. don't want to be<br />
regarded by any of you as having. a pessimistic view.<br />
I believe that this conference will do an immeasurable<br />
amount of good. But when it isover, I will-be<br />
surprised,. if. as Prime Minister of-Australia, if I<br />
still don't have to say to my own people: ' We-nmust<br />
still be-strong'. Now. Sir, thattinduces me to mention<br />
one other matter, and. I mention-it merely because<br />
every now: and then -some echo comes ' down from Queensland:<br />
-And. after all. Queensland has every right to<br />
be-regarded. : by me as -my favourite Stat e. I wouldn't<br />
be here'bit for Queenslnd. -I know that. ' But-every<br />
now: and then, somebody says: ' We'll, there is a great<br />
propaganda moverent going on. It-is occasionally<br />
promoted by people-with their tongues in-their qheeks<br />
about the necessi. ty'for defending Queensland,: and what<br />
is the -Commonwealth doing about it? And, therefore,<br />
I: want-all of you to do-a little thinking between-the<br />
18th hole and the 19th on : thiis matter,: and-sayto your-<br />
, selvesi ' Where', is Queensland best defended?.<br />
Now,-like-all of you, I am British, and<br />
. British-:. to the boot heels. andJI have an undying<br />
affection-for the Old: Country,. And I, therefore, recall<br />
to your ,! inds -that Great Britain has been the<br />
principal home of liberty. and the principal: defender<br />
oftliberty: inthe whole of-the modern history of-the<br />
world. Therefore. ' it-is worth recalling that-from the<br />
Battle of Hasting in 1066, : f i<br />
on throu&amp;._ whoija -o-f-momder n--' ia tor y-),,, Grea.-BrritailLhas<br />
defended her. own. territorial. integri-ty -inothe-r--<br />
places~ and not on her own-soil, The only time when<br />
f sion was in prospect, arose when'the fatt). e<br />
of Britain went onin the recent war, And there the<br />
Battle'for Britain was won-magnificently in the: air over<br />
GreaitBritain and later on, by the indomitable -spirit<br />
of people confronted by new, strange weapons-. coming<br />
from distant places But for 9G0 years, almost 900<br />
years'the good-sense of that country and of its-people<br />
has indicated that you want to defend yourself: as -far </p>
<p>-7-<br />
away from yourself : as.. you can. ' fAnd, -therefore, * when,<br />

at this momnent, when the. United. Kingdom~ has õ . under<br />

Now, Sir, the othermatter: thatl ~ thought<br />
I might trespass on. youritime~ about~ for.-a-, faw. minutes<br />
is our internal Ceroblews, -the ' internal ecortomy. I can<br />

<p>some other countries in the world We have at the elbow<br />
of our wage-earner a smaller supply of power than his<br />
opposite number in the United States has. In other<br />
words, we are feeling. at this moment thep ure of hig<br />
monetary demands on a. re-. tricted_. suppLy4. f-abL. au<br />
management and materials. And, Sir, that gives rise to<br />
problems that are not to be brushed off. These problems<br />
require thought, Somebody who says Well, the right<br />
way to deal with that is for the Government to let us<br />
have more of our own money: seems to settle. the argument.<br />
He hasn t necessarily settled it, Somebody says<br />
: Well, this is the perfect case for. a great migration<br />
programme, so that we may have more and more people to be<br />
employed', I am a great supporter of. a high migration<br />
programme. But, please look at; it both ways. A<br />
migration programme does in the short. run increase the<br />
demand upon. capital: facilities . the demand. upon factory<br />
accommodation, the demand on plant, the demand on schools,<br />
on hospitals or whatever it may be. The capital demand<br />
that is generated by 120,000 150 000' migrants coming into<br />
the country every. year is enormous : In the long run ;--it<br />
may be five years it may be eight years I don't know how<br />
long in the long run the productive effort of the new<br />
population will be counter inflationary, because it will<br />
stimulate the production of goods the people want. But<br />
you can't go through. a period of: intense migration without<br />
understanding that that s a period in which inflationary<br />
pressure is bound to be quite substantial,<br />
I balance those two things, one: against the<br />
other and. I have come down heavily in favour of migration<br />
because I believe that what this country wants more than<br />
anything else is population more and more millions of<br />
people, But all I am talking to you. about this matter: for<br />
is this don t please. accept the idea that when you have<br />
said we will have more millions of people that you have<br />
solved the problem, because we will, in consequence for<br />
some time have a high pressure of demand on our resources<br />
of men and of materials. and those are things that may<br />
require, occasionally stringent financial measures. rAnd<br />
the stringent financial measures which we took in 1951, in<br />
the short run; produ. ced hostility. and misunderstanding. and<br />
criticism and, sometimes, abuse. But if you don't. mind </p>
<p>abuse and I assure you I thrive on it then you<br />
know in the long run that if you have been right, you<br />
will find that the economic position has been improved<br />
by it and that in the long run, as now, everybody is<br />
better off. Now Sir. I don t want to make a long<br />
sermon to you about this matter. But could I, perhaps<br />
illustrate the. kind of thing I have iximind and I<br />
have been talking rather longer than I intended to<br />
by talking about a matter just quite shortly which most<br />
of you.: gentlemen here tonight have discussed privately<br />
I amsure, more than once, And that is the question<br />
as to how: we get more capital into Australia from<br />
overseas, There, again, I occasionally find,<br />
Mr, ' Chairman that people oversimplify this matter, and<br />
theysay : Well. let's get capital in from overseas and<br />
everythingoin the. garden is lovely'-Then every Premier<br />
will have what he wants, though I don t believe that'day<br />
will ever come, and there will be plenty o. f money to do<br />
everything, Well in the first place I think we ought<br />
always to remember this, that if everybody in Australia<br />
let's put it in this way if every working man if every,<br />
man capable of work, caab f mployment in Australia<br />
is in fact employed, and you add œ 100 million of capital<br />
to the demand upon his services do you create more men? 7<br />
Do you make them more willing to work? My experience has<br />
been I hope I am not entirely pessimistic that the<br />
greater certainty of a job, the more likely it is that the<br />
productive effort will tend to fall. I don't want to<br />
put it too high, That goes for you. too as well as to<br />
the fellow who carries the bricks, It goes for me. no<br />
doubt, If somebody were foolish enough to guarantee me<br />
that I will be Prime Minister for the rest of my natural<br />
life I don't mind telling you with all shame, I would<br />
take three weeks holiday for the first time in my life,<br />
And therefore, it isn t just a matter of<br />
adding money to the economy. I agree that to develop<br />
Australia and Australia is in spite of its remarkable<br />
efforts, a relatively undeveloped country to develop<br />
Australia we need capital But we also need manpower<br />
we need skill, we need effort, We need more production </p>
<p>-11-<br />
of: the materias.-that-are wanted for this. work. And<br />
. you mustn<br />
fYouican -solve : it for me?, iby, borrojing.@. œ 0' million.<br />
.1 hope I rake-that point quite plainly-to<br />
you,. because: at this moment in! Australia there is no unc<br />
: employment. Onthe contrary,: we have: a demand an<br />
unsatisfied demand; for peopleto.-be . employed. There: are<br />
more jobs thanmen. Nowdoes ' that mean~ thatwe~ are -not<br />
to concern ourselves with overseas -borrowing. Not at all.<br />
I. would like to tell~ you . a-simple little story about that,<br />
because JI kriwsomething about overseas borr owing.<br />
In 1950, just after we had-come back into<br />
office ,: and justafter our distinguished opponents. had<br />
Ssaid lthat you couldn t-borrow money, and couldn' t : borrow<br />
dollars~ and we must, therefore, go-without-the dollar<br />
goods ; for . which at that: time there was no substitute,<br />
great earth-moving-equipment, all isorts of things . needed<br />
for : public works. They-said it can'. t be done. : And I sat<br />
in myl room until half past one-in the morning-for: about<br />
two months and read all the documents I . could. get * out of<br />
all the departments on these matters, and then wentiinto my<br />
Cabinet and~ said: ;' Well, we have no aiswertothis vital<br />
shortage of capital goods.' You: see why -I mention * capital<br />
good. ; It i s not just a, matter of . bringing money in and.<br />
adding: to monetary demand,-: but a matter of buying capitaf<br />
goods. that wouldcome . in here. and be producers -from the<br />
time. they. arrive. I sawno hope of that unless we can<br />
raise a dollar loan-and. I would have thought that thatiwas<br />
impossible. And-. so eloquent ; was on this matter -and I<br />
have my-moments,-thatall my colleagues: beamed at me and<br />
said: it is quite unanswerable,. you had better go<br />
abroad-and borrow-some dollars". I-said, Iwas<br />
saying Lexactly the opposite'. And they -said: " Yes,<br />
I know, but still give it a go. Go and-see whetheryoucan<br />
borrow some dollars'. That. was a pretty good assignment.<br />
. and-I went. Now,: you don't borrow money anywhere-in the<br />
world, and this again I want. you to have in mind,: unless </p>
<p>-12-<br />
your country is regarded: as creditworthy, unless your<br />
administration is regarded: as-reputable and creditworthy:<br />
and unless you, yourself, are regarded: as-a<br />
responsible person. And-I don't mind telling . you that<br />
the credit of; Australia when we came inat the end of<br />
1949 was'such, that had it continued, nobody would<br />
have been able to borrow dollars in the United States.<br />
I have not the-slightest doubt of it. And I went over<br />
to. England on one of these tours that people com~ plain<br />
about ? so much. Great holiday jaunts. they call them.<br />
I was there for five days and I had three or four long<br />
discussions with my friend, Stafford Cripps ( my<br />
political opponent). who was-then the Chancellor of the<br />
Exchequor. I got him to agree : that if I could borrow<br />
dollars-in the United States, I wouldn't have to put<br />
them'into: the dollar-sterling pool, which is very<br />
important from our point of view, because then: everybody<br />
-else would have a cut out of it, you see. I<br />
said: i'I want them': for myself, Stafford'. : Andhe<br />
agreed. And then I went to the United States.<br />
Well, I had my negotiations with the<br />
International Bank. I: started, being -fairly long<br />
in the tooth now, with President Truman. I got him<br />
on mylside. I: then ' got Dean Acheson on my-side, -then<br />
gotrAverell Harriman on my side. There is nothing like<br />
having: a'few-friends,. you know. I have sometimes had<br />
very : few, but-you always wanlit a few. And we got from<br />
-the International Bank 50,000,000. in as many days<br />
as they. had-taken. months to lend them to any other<br />
country in the world. But. every dollar, every dollar was<br />
earmarked, not just to stimulate some monetary demand<br />
in Australia, but was-earmarked for -the importation<br />
into Australia of capital goods of massive working<br />
equipment needed for the developmtnent of this. country.<br />
That -is the. whole point I am making. Don't borrow<br />
for money, borrow for things, bdrrow for the things<br />
that you need. And on my last visit through-there,<br />
Mr. Black, President of the World Bank, said to. me that </p>
<p>he would like me to come to the World ' Bank to sign the<br />
last. borrowingwe had-made. He had the whole of his<br />
of them,. in the room,-from all: the<br />
countries in the world, or a great number of the countries<br />
iuthe. world. and. I signed a loan contract for.$ 542<br />
million. -He pointed out to the Directors that: Australia<br />
had, during our time in office,--permit me to emphasise<br />
that Australia had secured from'the World Bank 258%<br />
million for capital goods, mare dollars than had been<br />
se'cuwredby~ any other country in the world.<br />
One has only to go aroondfAustraIia to see<br />
theiimpact of this kind of thing. Well,; I mention that<br />
to you to demon strate how I approach this matter of publ ic<br />
: borrowing. ; We don't-share the Labour Party s horror of<br />
borrowing; These silly statements that ' are made: at<br />
, Canberra from time.-to timeabout putting yourself: into<br />
the hands of-the Overseas Bankers. This is~ alot of<br />
nonsense. Nobody in this room, in his five. wits, can fail<br />
* to~ understand'that if we hadn't-secured all this dollar<br />
finanne there would be works : s tandiig h alf-completed all<br />
round ' Aust'ra lia, which have now been done. iAnd~ what', you<br />
must do: is not-to borrow justifor'the: fun of it, not to<br />
borrow with. reckless indifference: as to how you'repay,<br />
because we have had-all thatin mind all that matteriwell<br />
in hand. ; But to borrow on the public account, not just<br />
to~ add to expenditure,: but to. add to our physical resources<br />
of plant and equipment in Australia.<br />
And, Sir, the other.. aspect of'the matter is,<br />
of course, . private'finance. There-hassbeen a'fairly<br />
substantialmovement of private investment. capitaliinto<br />
Australia. : But'there again,: I point out to. you, that<br />
nobody bringing œ 100 million into Australia~ can by that.<br />
si-mpl-e. act, create-another X thousand employees. I f we<br />
haven't more people, tMIER ne. adds'to the demand and up<br />
goes the cost of wages, up goes the price,. up-goes the<br />
inflationary movement. -And, ' therefore, we ourselves have<br />
always to consider that while we encourage overseas in--<br />
vestment, we believe in private invesgtment,. we believe in<br />
private capital. : We have'. none of these.' silly'ideas. I<br />
merely-. want you to have-in mind that-if private capital </p>
<p>-14-<br />
coming into Australia: is to be effectively. employed<br />
for our benefit,: and for its own legitimate benefit,<br />
then: we must : face up to the . conditions of that kind of<br />
thing. One of-those conditions is that we must<br />
justify additions to our capital supply by additions to<br />
our productive effort. : And that doesn't really mean<br />
one man or-two men or-three men. It means management,<br />
it means efficiency of organisation, it means technical<br />
improvement, it means genuine productive-effort on the<br />
part of the : employee. This . goes all tound. Otherwise<br />
we will become'drunk with the idea of money; we<br />
will say: ' Well, there is more and more money. rThe<br />
turnover is greater'. We don't pause to: say'. ' Well<br />
it may be greater, because the price level has risen'<br />
We can : easily become obsessed -with the idea of money,<br />
whereas for genuine continuing prosperity in : Australia,<br />
we-must match: more and mre ' purchasing power'with more<br />
and more productive: effort: an' productive: achievement,.<br />
And if I might . bring that-to. a simple-single point, I<br />
would: say this to . you:.-<br />
This country,,. through the Arbitration<br />
Court : and-various State Jaws, -has a 1forty-hour wtdk.<br />
This : country.. can afford a forty hour w ek, but onlyif<br />
it is forty hoursiwork. If we are goingto'be-such<br />
' fools : in the face of history as to get : all-the -enormous<br />
benefits of. a forty hour week, : all the leisure that: it<br />
Sproiducefs :-and wthis eis a country of enormous leisure--<br />
are going'to be such fools. as to think, that<br />
hav-ing. a Tforty hour week, we can-by this rule or that<br />
regulation or that practice. to whittle it away to<br />
to 30 to' 28. then we must be intelligent nengh to<br />
face up to the consequences of-that; Andthe consequences<br />
of aniy such: attitude of mind as that must<br />
inevitably be -that our costs will rise, that our prices<br />
will rise and the day may well come when we price even<br />
our'export. indistries on-the land out of the world<br />
market. If we are going to do that, then we will<br />
have reached the last folly; because although there may<br />
be some people in the world who believe that a Government </p>
<p>with inexhaustible-supplies of money can subsidise-every-'<br />
body, so that everybody remains happy. You don't<br />
believe that. Nor do I believe that. This country! s<br />
prosperity,: so great, must be a-solid prosperity. I<br />
would go out of office miserable, out of politics dejected,<br />
if I-thought that all I had done was to-leave<br />
my own. country in a state which looked likea -state of<br />
pro'sperity. and in reality was : a'state of complete<br />
delusion. J1 am not a pessimist. I am an optimist. But<br />
if you are going to be full of hope about your~ country<br />
and ' full of confidence n its future, then it becomes<br />
necessary,: every :. noi vand then to; say: ;' ontlet : s. forget<br />
the simple, sensible conditions of continuing prosperity.<br />
Don't: let's abandon the ancient virtues'.., Because, you.<br />
know,-. if you go around Australiaand lookatwhat'has*! been<br />
done: anid. what is being -done, you constantly . remind,. yourselves<br />
that'this was done : by the ancient pioneering-. virtues<br />
that made iAustralia, work done by simple people. who worked.<br />
in their day. and~ generation,. who were as hone! õ t as the: day<br />
and-honedty takes many forms, just: as~ dishonesty doeswho<br />
were honest in their day and generation; * God-fearing<br />
people. who believed in'their familics. and ; in. their : future<br />
andin their country. * God knows: there is not a man here<br />
tonight who-doesn'. t come from-some familyof that kind.<br />
And, therefore, let us retore in our own minds, repair An<br />
our own minds, these great virtues, so that the-happy state<br />
oF-affairs -in which we now live will continue.<br />
Now, Sir, I-said just now'that I was about<br />
to finish,. but will.: you permit me just three ninutes; to<br />
mention one other matter beforeI have done? -I-haven't<br />
except . in. a glancing way, referred to-the impact upon<br />
Australia of the greattinfluence against production,; and<br />
against . effort ' that . we have and,-that; is the ' Communist<br />
movement.. .' That is its ' stock-in-trade. It believes -in<br />
the strike. It believes in ' slowing dbwn. -It believes-in<br />
getting rid of prosperity, because then-it has the ' soil-in<br />
which its doctrines may grow. I -hope everybody in ' Australia<br />
has observed in the last few months that the two'elements<br />
which have conspired together honourably and-effectively to<br />
get-rid of ' Communist control in unions the sec-ret ballot<br />
and'the groups in the unions who stood against iCommunism<br />
have both come under violent attack by Dr. Evatt. The </p>
<p>-16-<br />
attacks, so violent and so successful, partly<br />
cloaked. as some bogus sectarian view, partly cloaked<br />
in other ways, have been so successful that if you<br />
open your newspapers week by week, you begin to read<br />
how this union which was under Communist control and<br />
came out of it, has gone back to it. Does this give<br />
pleasure to the people of Australia? This is no<br />
accident. This is deliberate. This is the price<br />
that, is paid for Communist support. I never read any<br />
of the records of these things without feeling, that one<br />
of the most shocking things that has happenedin my<br />
time-is that the great Labour Party, which really is no<br />
more Communist than I am, as a Labour Party should have<br />
been misled into. a course of conduct which is greeted<br />
with cheers in Marx House, and greeted with despair by<br />
decent trade unionists who have for years been: battling<br />
against Communists. </p>

VOTE OF THANKS TO: THE PRIME MINISTER MOVED BY<br />
MB. KEN MORRIS PARLIAMENTARY LEADER OF THE<br />
LIBERAL PARTY IN QUEENSLAND,<br />
It is my'very, very proud opportunity to<br />
propose a vote of thanks to the'Right Honourable<br />
R. G. Menzies. : As I looked around the'table. as he. was<br />
speaking, : and as I heard the reception that you gave to<br />
him. at the conclusion of his speech, I realised that<br />
every one of you in the room tonight would-like to. be<br />
doing the same thing. Because . Ibelieve that. you will<br />
be with me when I say that we have got in our Prime Minister<br />
ofAustralia, in Robert Gordon Menzies, the. greatest<br />
Australian that we have known in our generation.<br />
Many of you will have heard me say that. not<br />
only in the presence of the Prime Minister, but also in<br />
his absence. And I have heard you say the same thing. The<br />
proposal of a vote of thanks, of. course, is usually-the<br />
formal. conclusion of a gathering. But there are some<br />
exceptional occasions, when we have an exceptional guest, that<br />
it resumes somewhat greater proportions, as it does to-night.<br />
And when I think of the pages that will be written in history<br />
in the future about -our Prime Minister, I believe that. all<br />
the historians will most proudly put him shoulder to; shoulder<br />
with that other very great leader of our generation,: and of<br />
a previous one, that great Englishman, Sir Winston Churchill.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, we of the Liberal<br />
Party have ideals of which we are enormously proud. . We have<br />
issued, as you know, a booklet called ' We Believe'. I<br />
think all of you have had it, But I feel that those ideals<br />
which are illustrated in that booklet, ' We Believe', are the<br />
ideals for which our Prime Minister has worked and fought<br />
and sacrificed let us not forget that and sacrificed<br />
over the past 25 years. It is because he has sacrificed<br />
himself for those ideals that he is bringing to Australiat<br />
something that we could never have had, if it hadn't been for </p>
<p>18-<br />
his presence. I ask you to co--operate with my<br />
Parliamentary colleagues in the State sphere to'give<br />
him what I believe he needs, a government in the State<br />
sphere which will. co.--operate with him to bring to<br />
Queensland the real development and the real advance..<br />
ment that Queensland'so richly deserves: but-is<br />
losing because of the lack of co-operation that we<br />
have from the present administration.<br />
I want you to know th, t everyone.: of my<br />
Parliamentary colleagues in Queenslan, believes with me<br />
that they, and you, who are leaders of your industries<br />
have faced in the years that have g6ne by. tasks that<br />
have been difficult. tasks that have been almost<br />
frightening in theirdifficulty. We in the State<br />
sphere face a task, not at all frightening; but a task<br />
which is admittedly difficult. But I can assure you<br />
that all of us bei. eve that with your . co-operation we<br />
will, most definitely, win the elec'tion next year.<br />
That is not optimism, but it is based on a realistic<br />
analysis of every electorate in Queensland. And don't<br />
forget this that in the past few months, I have had the<br />
opportunity of visiting with my Leader, Mr, . Frank Nicklin<br />
all the large areas throughout Queensland. I say to<br />
you in conclusion on that matter that if you will co<br />
operate with us, as I. know you will, if you will go<br />
out, as I think Sir Arthur. Fadden-said a moment ago.<br />
if you will go out on a crusade and spread the gospel<br />
of the ideals of Liberalism whi. ch are the greatest<br />
political ideals which it is possible to have then you<br />
will'see the change of Government in this State.<br />
To you Sir, may I say that I am awfully<br />
proud to be the mouthpiece of those who are here now.<br />
and-who heard you, We feel it is more than an honour<br />
to be associated with you. You are our Leader, and to<br />
you we give all the thanks for the work that you have<br />
done. We will show you what we think in the State<br />
election next year in 1956. </p>
