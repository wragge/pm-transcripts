PRIME * MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
INAUGURATION OF NORTH WEST SHELF STAGE 2<br />
PERTH -19 SEPTEMBER 1989<br />
Premier Dowding,<br />
Distinguished guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
Forty years ago, on the other side of this vast continent,<br />
the Australian people began construction of one of the<br />
largest and most complex engineering projects in the world:<br />
the Snowy Mountains Scheme.<br />
Today, we celebrate a milestone in another massive feat of<br />
Australian engineering: the North West Shelf project. It's<br />
called upon the same capacity for vision and the same<br />
reserves of human skill and dedication that characterised<br />
the Snowy Mountains Scheme, and it's created an industry<br />
that will foster Australian jobs and Australian exports into<br />
the twenty-first century.<br />
Australians may perhaps be blase about the magnitude of<br />
resource projects throughout our continent: the huge coal<br />
fields in the eastern States, the vast iron-ore mines in<br />
this State, the oil fields of Bass Strait, our bauxite, gold<br />
and copper mines.<br />
But this one dwarfs them all. The North West Shelf project<br />
is, simply, the largest single resource project in our<br />
history and perhaps the largest anywhere in the world.<br />
Back in the 1960s, not even the most optimistic of people<br />
who saw a small company called Woodside Petroleum acquire a<br />
number of exploration permits in the remote North West of<br />
Western Australia could have imagined the scale of the<br />
discoveries that were to be made, or the magnitude of the<br />
development those discoveries sparked:<br />
375 billion cubic metres of natural gas;<br />
$ 12. billion in investment expenditure;<br />
8000 jobs onsite and offsite;<br />
exports worth up to $ 2 billion a year from 1994. 1% 907 </p>
<p>2.<br />
What that barrage of figures tells us, very simply, is this:<br />
for a nation, dependent as Australia is on successful<br />
competition on the world's market places, the North West<br />
Shelf represents a massive contribution to our economic<br />
wellbeing and to the prosperity of future generations of<br />
Aus t ral1i a.<br />
That is why, as Prime Minister, it is my very great pleasure<br />
to congratulate the joint venturers on their tremendous<br />
achievement in bringing this project to fruition; to welcome<br />
the support of the eight Japanese electricity and gas<br />
utilities who will purchase LNG from the North West Shelf;<br />
to pay tribute to the work of the National Liaison Group<br />
which has played a vital consultative role throughout the<br />
duration of this project; and to thank the skill, energy and<br />
commitment of the thousands of workers and staff who have<br />
given their best efforts to this project.<br />
It is of course a matter of regret to me that due to a<br />
variety of circumstances we are not gathered at Karratha<br />
today to see this great project. I certainly look forward<br />
to inspecting it one day.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
I've been making the point recently, in discussing<br />
Australia's economic position, that we are undergoing an<br />
investment boom.<br />
Those who are worried about our current account deficit<br />
should come to the North West Shelf and see the way in which<br />
this project dependent as it has been in part on foreign<br />
investment will translate into future export growth.<br />
Across the whole spectrum of industry not just in resource<br />
projects but throughout the manufacturing sector<br />
investment which today is contributing to our current<br />
account deficit is laying the foundations for substantial<br />
export growth in the future.<br />
At the same time it's impressive that such a large<br />
proportion of the work on North West Shelf has in fact been<br />
performed by Australian industry.<br />
Of the more than $ 6 billion already spent, about three<br />
quarters has been spent in Australia.<br />
In other words, Australian industry can compete with the<br />
best of them when it comes to major resource projects like<br />
this; at the same time we have acquired new skills and<br />
capacities which will help make us even better partners in<br />
major resource and engineering projects in the future.<br />
I want to express a special welcome'to our Japanese guests<br />
today.<br />
19908 </p>
<p>Exports from the North West Shelf mark the beginning of a<br />
new phase in the already very healthy relationship between<br />
Australia and Japan.<br />
The future is very bright for both of us.<br />
In the mid 1990s, this project will be providing some 15 per<br />
cent of Japan's LNG imports. And Australia can play an even<br />
greater role in supplying energy resources to Japan. Over<br />
the next decade, energy exports to Japan could treble in<br />
real terms to $ 3 billion a year.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
The North West Shelf has been completed on budget, and two<br />
months ahead of schedule. That's a great achievement in<br />
itself proof, if more was needed, of the hard work,<br />
cooperative spirit and sheer dedication brought to this<br />
project by thousands of people.<br />
I offer my congratulations to you all and my confident best<br />
wishes for the future of this great project. 1909 </p>
