RELATIONS WITH FRANCE<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
Mr Whitlam, announced today that the Attorney-General, Senator<br />
Lionel Murphy, will represent the Australian Government at the<br />
Ministerial talks to be held with the French Government in Paris<br />
O on 18 and 19 April.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that Senator Murphy's visit to Paris<br />
and the discussions he would have there with French Ministers<br />
were important in the Government's continuing and strenuous<br />
efforts to prevent further nuclear tests being conducted in<br />
the South Pacific. Because of the value it attaches to its wider<br />
relations with France, the Australian Government was<br />
determined, Mr Whitlam. added, to explore all possible avenues<br />
in seeking to achieve a solution to this one, but very<br />
important, disagreement between the two countries. </p>
