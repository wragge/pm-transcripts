PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR EDIA6 AUGUST 1985<br />
On 6 August 1945, an atomic bomb devastated the city of<br />
Hiroshima. Since that day, the world has lived in the<br />
shadow of nuclear weapon'*.,<br />
Forty years after the end of the Pacific War, nothing<br />
more clearly signifies the determination of Australia<br />
and other South Pacific countries to emerge from that<br />
shadow than the current efforts of the South Pacific<br />
Forum to achieve a Nuclear Free Zone in our region.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government, I renew our<br />
commitment to use all the influence we have to prevent<br />
the spread of nuclear weapons and to encourage all<br />
nuclear weapons states to reduce and ultigpately<br />
eliminate them through balanced and verifiable arms<br />
control agreements. ** u,. I*.. e* e. iue..* iuuiueu. h,. I </p>
