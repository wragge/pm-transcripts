    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST: (inaudible) the execution of the Bali Bombers overnight?</p>
<p>PM: I think today is a time for us all to bear in our thoughts and our prayers the 200 Australian and Indonesian families who were shattered by the Bali Bombing six years ago.</p>
<p>Their lives remain shattered. They have been changed fundamentally by that murder. So it is their lives that we think about today.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Is it something you particularly reflected upon during your time in church this morning?</p>
<p>PM: I was thinking, as Therese was, about all those families. When memories come searing back, it is really hard. This is more than 200 families, Australian, Indonesian, from elsewhere in the world. Lives which were just completely changed in the most horrific of ways by the Bali Bombing.</p>
<p>So let's think about them today, it's really important.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, a change in Government in New Zealand overnight?</p>
<p>PM: Yeah last night I rang the Prime Minister elect John Key. I congratulated John on his election, a fine win for himself and for his party. The great thing about the Australia New Zealand relationship is it really goes beyond party politics.</p>
<p>We have committed afresh to building this important relationship for both of us.</p>
<p>I have also invited John to visit Australia at the earliest opportunity and for him to undertake an official state visit. I think that would be a great opportunity to begin this new period in the relationship.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: New Limited is reporting today that Malcolm Turnbull has complained about being snubbed by Therese. Can I please get your reaction to that?</p>
<p>PM: Oh look, I think that is a matter for Mr Turnbull, isn't it?</p>
