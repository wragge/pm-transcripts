COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. HAROLD HOLT, M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE VIP FLIGHT<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 4 October 1967]<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT ( Higgins-Prime<br />
Minister)--by leave-It would have become<br />
obvious, I think, to all members of the<br />
Parliament that in recent times lines of<br />
criticism have developed in certain sections<br />
of the Press and also amongst some<br />
members of the Parliament directed against<br />
the conduct of the VIP flight. This criticism<br />
has been directed in such a way as to give<br />
quite a distorted picture to the public of<br />
the way in which the flight operatcs and<br />
the extent and nature of its use. I felt that<br />
the Parliament should have an authoritative<br />
statement before it so that any comment<br />
that might be made in future would at<br />
least be made against the background of<br />
an accurate and comprehensive statement<br />
of the recent history of this flight. I propose<br />
in-the course of my statement to give the<br />
House some facts showing how the flight<br />
has developed over recent years. I use the<br />
term ' developed' in the context of the aircraft<br />
currently employed. There were nine<br />
aircraft in the flight in 1958. When the<br />
replacements have been received and the<br />
planes that they replace have been removed<br />
there will be nine aircraft operating again<br />
in the flight. Recent history will fihow<br />
that this is not a matter which has suddenly<br />
leapt ahead in recent times and indeed it<br />
13945/ 67 will show that for several years Cabinet<br />
has been giving consideration to the problem<br />
which was arising with the obsolescence<br />
of some elements of the flight-the need to<br />
replace some and the need to have a more<br />
diverse range of aircraft for the changing<br />
and varying conditions to be found around<br />
the continent of Australia.<br />
The VIP flight has actually been in<br />
operation for somewhere in the neighbourhood<br />
of 20 years, but it is over more recent<br />
times that criticism of its use has intensified.<br />
1, therefore, put these facts before the<br />
Parliament. I go back to November 1962<br />
when the Cabinet decided to appoint a<br />
Cabinet committee to consider the replacement<br />
of the flight with modern aircraft.<br />
By April 1963 the committee had carried<br />
on its own investigation and had decided<br />
that there was a need, not only for replacement,<br />
but for a more ready availability of<br />
aircraft to assist Ministers and to deal with<br />
the increasing VIP traffic coming to this<br />
country. The committee authorised the<br />
Minister for Air to investigate the possibility<br />
of immediate replacement of or<br />
additions to the existing flight pending the<br />
introduction of pure jets. It was decided to<br />
recommend to Cabinet that an order be<br />
placed for three DH125 aircraft at that </p>
<p>time and that civil aviation aircraft supplement<br />
the operations of the Royal Australian<br />
Air Force flight. In point of fact, while<br />
Cabinet endorsed the recommendation in<br />
June 1963 for the purchase of the three<br />
aircraft to replace threc Dakotas and agreed<br />
that consideration should next be given to<br />
the replacement of the ageing Convair<br />
Metropolitans * by aircraft of the BACIII<br />
type, it did not go ahead with the order of<br />
the DH125 aircraft because in January<br />
1964 it decided in favour of Mysteres as<br />
being more suitable for Australian circumstances.<br />
It also at that time agreed that the<br />
suitability of adding Viscounts to the VIP<br />
flight be immediately investigated.<br />
This consideration went on through 1964<br />
when Cabinet decided to buy two Viscount<br />
aircraft to supplement the existing Convairs<br />
and Dakotas and to leave in abeyance the<br />
purchase of any jet aircraft. The Minister<br />
for Air was to keep the requirements of<br />
the flight under review, and in November<br />
1965 Cabinet considered the whole question<br />
and authorised the purchase of three<br />
Mystere aircraft and two Hawker Siddeley<br />
748 aircraft. These five aircraft were to<br />
replace five Dakotas which, at that point<br />
of time, were 20 years old. Orders were<br />
to be placed for two BACI 11 aircraft to<br />
replace two Convair Metropolitans which,<br />
at that time, were 9 years old.<br />
It will be seen from this recital of the<br />
facts that no aircraft actually has been<br />
ordered in the life of my own Government.<br />
I say that not because I do not accept full<br />
responsibility for, or approve of, the decisions<br />
which were taken earlier but because<br />
a picture seems to have been conjured up<br />
in the public mind that we have suddenly<br />
leapt into some expansion of the service<br />
here in Australia whereas, in fact, the<br />
decisions on which orders were placed were<br />
taken back in November 1965. 1 do not<br />
think that anybody who had any contact<br />
with my predecessor, Sir Robert Menzies,<br />
would ever argue that he was a spendthrift<br />
of the public money. I know of no public<br />
leader in my time who had greater regard<br />
for the careful use of public funds. I made<br />
the point that the fleet we now have was<br />
ordered back in November 1965. It replaced<br />
very old aircraft. In fact, my colleague the<br />
Minister for Air reported to Cabinet that<br />
the Chief of the Air Staff had told him that<br />
the Dakota aircraift had reached a point at which they were below reasonably safe<br />
operating conditions for use as VIP aircraft<br />
and that in a short space of time would<br />
have had to be declared unfit for such use.<br />
As to the capital cost of these aircraft<br />
-again there has been an attempt to conjure<br />
up a picture of a great splurge of<br />
expenditure in one year-this was spread<br />
over a period of three financial years commencing<br />
in 1965-66. It is perhaps typical<br />
of the kind of criticism we have had to face<br />
that one newspaper I saw recently stated<br />
that to increase the age pension by<br />
would cost about $ 20m a year whereas we<br />
were spending $ 21 .6m on these aircraft.<br />
Not only were the payments spread over 3<br />
years; normally one can expect these aircraft<br />
to have an operational life of 10 to<br />
15 years.<br />
Mr Duthie-What was the cost?<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-They cost S21.6m.<br />
I will refer to that matter in a moment. This<br />
was the cost of the aircraft only, the fly<br />
away cost, and included the price of spares<br />
and matters of that sort. I do not need to<br />
go into too much detail about the Dakota<br />
aircraft. They are well known to honourable<br />
members. They were great work<br />
horses in their time. When the time came<br />
for them to be replaced, the Minister<br />
pointed out that for our VIP aircraft there<br />
were two principal requirements. In the<br />
majority of eases the use of VIP aircraft<br />
involves the carriage of small numbers of<br />
passengers over the main routes of Australia.<br />
This is their role for a good deal of the<br />
time and for this purpose we need a small,<br />
fast, reasonably comfortable aircraft.<br />
Secondly, there is -a small but significant<br />
number of operations which involve the use<br />
of relatively undeveloped airfields of limited<br />
length. For these operations an aircraft<br />
equipped with turbo propeller engines was<br />
required; an aircraft with -better takeoff and<br />
landing performances. The Mystere met the<br />
first requirement and the Hawker Siddeley<br />
748 met the second requirement.<br />
The Mystere is described customarily in<br />
the Press and by some of our parliamentary<br />
critics as a luxury jet. I have flown in this<br />
aircraft several times. It has the great merit<br />
of speed. When I heard a member from<br />
another place talking about the chicken<br />
and bubbly and so forth which were available<br />
in the aircraft I wished he had been </p>
<p>with me on Monday. We were flying over<br />
the Australian Alps. He would have had<br />
great difficulty in controlling either of those<br />
commodities at that time. The standards of<br />
catering are similar to those which have<br />
always existed in the aircraft. I am sure<br />
some could paint a pretty picture of the<br />
services and standards provided. But as one<br />
who has been a very regular user of the<br />
VIP flight, I find that salad, in which the<br />
ice has not been quite thawed out, and<br />
lacking the flavour of a home cooked meal,<br />
soon loses its appeal. When we were<br />
coming back from Western Australia<br />
recently, after attending the opening of the<br />
North West Cape naval communication<br />
establishment, my wife thought that, in<br />
order to secure a change of diet for us, she<br />
should order some pies and sausage rolls.<br />
That was the luxury meal that we had on<br />
that occasion.<br />
For the replacement of the two Convair<br />
Metropolitan' aircraft, the Minister recommended<br />
the BAC111 which was somewhat<br />
cheaper than the generally comparable<br />
DC9. As I have said, the need for special<br />
air transport available to the Commonwealth<br />
Government has been recognised for<br />
some 20 years and the business of Government<br />
would be certainly less efficient if<br />
the most senior Ministers had their work<br />
and travel restricted to the rigid timetables<br />
of the commercial airlines. I illustrate this<br />
point by a look at the Canberra airline<br />
schedules. There were no commercial flights<br />
to Sydney today between 9.30 a. m. and<br />
12.30 p. m. There is a 3-hour gap in the<br />
morning and a 4-hour gap in the afternoon<br />
on most days to Melbourne. There are no<br />
daily flights to Sydney after 9.15 p. m. or to<br />
Melbourne after 6 p. m. There are no daily<br />
flights into Canberra from Sydney after<br />
8.15 p. m. and none from Melbourne after<br />
6.30 p. m. At weekends, when the business<br />
of government, certainly in my own case,<br />
and in the case of most of my other<br />
Ministers, still goes on, the normal<br />
schedules are even more limiting. The<br />
schedules to other capital cities are even<br />
more restricted.<br />
The work of government goes on around<br />
the clock and I think I can fairly claim to<br />
average an 80-hour working week. Work<br />
must continue even while we are flying to a<br />
destination. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) could confirm<br />
this from his own experience. The aircraft<br />
serves as a flying office, with staff available.<br />
The use of executive aircraft is common to<br />
governments of most other countries. This<br />
is particularly the case in the United States<br />
of America and Canada, where industrial<br />
development and distances provide comparable<br />
problems with those experienced in<br />
Australia; and the availability is certainly<br />
no less in Great Britain and other European<br />
countries.<br />
I mentioned earlier that when the decision<br />
was made in 1965 to re-equip, the VIP<br />
flight then consisted of nine aircraft, as<br />
indeed it has since 1958. We purchased 2<br />
Vickers Viscounts second hand that were<br />
built in 1959 and 1960, 2 Convair Metropolitans<br />
and 5 Dakotas. The Convair<br />
Metropolitans and the Vickers Viscounts<br />
are no longer in production, so that even<br />
had we chosen to replace the ageing aircraft<br />
with others of the same type we would not<br />
have been able to procure them. The VIP<br />
flight remains a flight of nine aircraft, and<br />
for some time still it will include the two<br />
Vickers Viscounts, which however have<br />
only a limited operating life to run.<br />
I can give the House some idea of the<br />
extent of use, and, indeed, the character<br />
of use, of the aircraft. From January to<br />
June of this year the aircraft were used<br />
by the Governor-General of Australia on<br />
41 occasions, by myself on 46 occasions,<br />
by the Treasurer ( Mr McMahon) on<br />
occasions and by the Minister for Trade<br />
and Industry ( Mr McEwen) on 22 occasions.<br />
It will be seen that apart from those<br />
relating to the Governor-General-who is<br />
required to make frequent journeys for<br />
ceremonial purposes-those figures relate<br />
to the three most senior members of<br />
Cabinet. No other Minister reached double<br />
figures in his use of the aircraft, and seven<br />
Ministers did not use the flight at all. Other<br />
users were visiting rIPs. The service is<br />
available to, and has been used by, the<br />
Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy<br />
Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Barnard)<br />
and by officials, including the Service<br />
chiefs. It might be of some interest to the House<br />
to have an indication of the actual VIP<br />
use of this flight in the past 12 months.<br />
The users included Prince Charles, the<br />
Prime Minister of Thailand, the Queen </p>
<p>Mother, the New Zealand Minister -of<br />
Defence, the New Zealand Deputy Prime<br />
Minister, the Canadian Secretary of State,<br />
the British . Secretary for the Colonies,<br />
the President of the British Board of Trade,<br />
The Prime Minister of Malta, the Prime<br />
Minister of South Vietnam, the Governor<br />
of the National Bank of Cambodia, the<br />
Malaysian Minister of Defence, the British<br />
Secretary for Commonwealth Affairs, Princess<br />
Alexandra, the Duke of Edinburgh,<br />
the Foreign Minister of Israel, the Deputy<br />
Prime Minister of Malaysia, the Secretary-<br />
General of the Commonwealth Secretariat,<br />
the Prime Minister of New Zealand and<br />
the Indian and Pakistani parliamentary<br />
delegations. Some of these visitors had<br />
large retinues and official staff. For instance,<br />
on one occasion it was necessary for us<br />
to provide two Viscounts and one DC3 in<br />
order to transport a visiting party around<br />
Australia. For ceremonial visits there is<br />
-always a large number of persons to be<br />
carried and a large quantity of luggage,<br />
and this often necessitates the provision of<br />
more than one aircraft.<br />
Particularly in relation to VIP users of<br />
the service, the serviceability of the aircraft<br />
at the time is a matter of importance. These<br />
people are holding to tight schedules on<br />
significant public occasions. I found, in<br />
arranging to welcome the Prime Minister<br />
of New Zealand, that two of the aircraft<br />
we had sought to make available to him<br />
were unserviceable, and a third aircraft had<br />
to be found. Last Friday, when I had to<br />
attend in Sydney with the President of Italy,<br />
I found that two of the Mystere jets, one<br />
of which I would have normally used,<br />
were unserviceable, and a third aircraft had<br />
to be made available. In other words, some<br />
margin of utility has to be available if these<br />
tight schedules are to be met. In the case<br />
of visiting VIPs in particular we usually<br />
have to have standby aircraft-this applies<br />
most certainly in the cases of members of<br />
the Royal Family and visiting Prime Ministers-<br />
in case they would otherwise be<br />
unable to carry out their commitments.<br />
The use of these aircraft is strictly limited<br />
and controlled, and only two Ministers have<br />
authority in relation to this. Other than in<br />
my own case and that of the Governor-<br />
General or a member of the Royal Family,<br />
the use of the aircraft is part of the responsibility<br />
and exercise of ministerial authority of the Minister for Air. In cases where he<br />
entertains some doubt as -to an application<br />
he consults with me, so that, between us,<br />
we exercise, on behalf of the Government,<br />
the responsibility in relation to this service.<br />
In simple -terms, thanks to this service,<br />
Ministers can travel long distances quickly,<br />
they can work on their way in reasonable<br />
comfort and with security for classified<br />
documents, and when they travel together<br />
they have useful opportunities for continuing<br />
discussions and for consultations.<br />
The use of executive aircraft is common<br />
these days, not only with governments but<br />
with large companies in various parts of<br />
the world. I know of one European company<br />
with a turnover smaller than the<br />
defence vote of this country which maintains<br />
a flight of the same dimension as<br />
ours. There would be at least half a dozen<br />
American companies that maintain a flight<br />
of the same dimension as our own. Proportionately,<br />
I would say without hesitation,<br />
the flights maintained by the governments<br />
of the United States of America, Canada<br />
and the United Kingdom would all be considerably<br />
larger-even taking the difference<br />
of population into account-than the Australian<br />
flight.<br />
What is often lost sight of, quite apart<br />
from the service provided for Ministers,<br />
officials, the Leader of the Opposition, the<br />
Deputy Leader of the Opposition and others,<br />
is the role that the flight plays in the training<br />
of Air Force personnel. It provides a<br />
valuable training medium in a variety of<br />
directions, and many transport pilots have<br />
received a course of training in VIP aircraft<br />
before passing on to the work of transport<br />
pilot in the Air Force proper. The hours<br />
flown count towards the qualification of airmen<br />
in various aspects of their air service.<br />
It is this training role which makes the<br />
problem of costing, to which I will refer in<br />
a moment, complex if a clear and not misleading<br />
picture is to be available to the<br />
public. As to the use of these aircraft by VIPs<br />
coming to Australia, it will be a matter of<br />
common knowledge that the number of such<br />
persons is increasing considerably as<br />
Australia's significance and economic importance<br />
grow throughout the world. I am<br />
sure that all honourable members will have<br />
been struck by the increase in interest which </p>
<p>heads of government, senior political figures<br />
and senior industrial figures from other parts<br />
of the world are manifesting in Australia<br />
these days. Aircraft of the VIP flight, as I<br />
have indicated, are available to Royal Aus-<br />
-tralian Air Force pilots from all branches.<br />
These* aircraft provide training for pilots in<br />
modern aircraft and a necessary opportunity<br />
to build up their flying time to the<br />
level required by the Service.<br />
The test as to whether a reasonable use<br />
is made of the flight is, I suggest to thc<br />
House, a matter of the responsibility of<br />
~' those directly concerned, and they are the<br />
Minister for Air and myself. If I felt that<br />
the Minister for Air was not behaving<br />
. responsibly in relation to the service, I could<br />
take action. If the public thought that I was<br />
not behaving responsibly in the role which<br />
I play in relation to -the service I have nio<br />
doubt that it would -take action against<br />
me. This has a bearing on the problem of<br />
costs. I have looked into this matter to see<br />
whether a dissection of costs is feasible<br />
as between uses of the aircraft, including<br />
training purposes for which the aircraft are<br />
used, and to make a dissection in such a<br />
way as to present a realistic picture. I have<br />
no doubt that the Air Force could come<br />
up with a figure showing the total cost of<br />
operating the service, but if you wanted a<br />
realistic picture there would necessarily<br />
have to be some division between the<br />
training role of the aircraft and its other<br />
uses. The training costs would vary, in<br />
respect of a particular aircraft, almost<br />
from flight to flight, depending on which<br />
members of the crew are undergoing training<br />
and the duration of that training. If<br />
there were several Ministers in one aircraft,<br />
should the cost be spread over the<br />
various departments which they administer?<br />
If there were in the one aircraft three or<br />
four senior Service officials-perhaps thc<br />
three Chiefs of Staff-do you spread the<br />
cost through each of the Services?<br />
It is my understanding that the Public<br />
Accounts Committee, having looked at this<br />
general problem in other directions, has<br />
come to the conclusion that it is not satisfactory<br />
to try to spread over a number of<br />
departments the cost carried by a particular<br />
department for services rendered to those<br />
other departments. But I have no wish to<br />
deny to the public or to the Parliament information which should reasonably be<br />
available to them. It has never been my<br />
practice to do so. This flight operates as an<br />
essential element in the structure of govern--<br />
ment. If ways and means could be found<br />
of determining costs in a realistic waynot<br />
a misleading way which would present<br />
a false picture to the public-I would be<br />
only too willing to see that course pursued.<br />
I do not know which would be the most<br />
appropriate body to do this. I imagine that<br />
the Treasury contains more expertise on<br />
these matters than any other area of government<br />
that I could point -to and I would bewilling<br />
to have the matter examined there.<br />
Before I conclude perhaps I could deal<br />
with what I might term some of the<br />
mythology that has developed around'<br />
this subject. I have already given one or<br />
two illustrations of how far fetched some<br />
of the criticism has been. Seeing that I have<br />
been. involved in one, or two of these*<br />
criticisms perhaps I could give the facts. I<br />
know that a picture has been conjured upin<br />
the public mind of frequent use of these<br />
aircraft by members of my family. T1herehas<br />
been only one instance since I ' became<br />
Prime Minister on which members of my<br />
family have travelled on an aircraft which<br />
was not an aircraft carrying me to my<br />
destination. In that instance the ' aircraft was<br />
proceeding to Melbourne to pick up four<br />
Ministers for the return journey to Canberra.<br />
That was the extent of the incident<br />
about which criticism was raised on that<br />
occasion. One or two of my friends opposite havebeen<br />
making gibes about the use of an air--<br />
craft for a fishing trip. The facts of the<br />
matter are that being in Rockhamptonnobody<br />
has challenged my use of the air-.<br />
craft to go to Rockhampton-I proceeded'<br />
in the aircraft to Townsville. It was not<br />
necessary for me to proceed to Townsville<br />
in that aircraft. I was picked up in Townsville<br />
in a privately owned aircraft and taken<br />
to my destination, which was Dunk Island.<br />
The aircraft belonged to a friend, who had<br />
come from Sydney earlier, and he could<br />
just as easily have picked me up at Rockhampton<br />
as at Townsville.<br />
What critics overlook is that a Prime<br />
Minister is never able to divorce himself<br />
from his job. He is never in a real sense<br />
absent from his duty. I had to have staff' </p>
<p>with me from Rockhampton to Townsville.<br />
Wherever I go my staff must be available.<br />
They have to keep in touch with the<br />
enormous machine that runs the business of<br />
this country. They were stationed by me.<br />
I repeat that in a very real sense a Prime<br />
Minister is never off duty. I only wish that<br />
sometimes I could be. That particular<br />
weekend was the first in three on which I<br />
had not been tied -up with official functions.<br />
I hope that not too many honourable<br />
members opposite will begrudge me an<br />
opportunity to have a little recreation and<br />
fresh air occasionally at the weekend. That<br />
is the extent of the incident for which they<br />
would level criticism.<br />
The other matter about which I would<br />
like to clear the air is what I regard as a<br />
malicious and cruel presentation of an episode<br />
in which my colleague, the Treasurer,<br />
was involved when his young daughter was<br />
seriously burned. His doctor advised that<br />
she should be taken as speedily as possible<br />
to a Sydney hospital in case skin grafting<br />
had to be carried out. The allegation was<br />
made that an aircraft was specially provided<br />
for this purpose. An aircraft had been<br />
previously ordered for the Treasurer, as was<br />
his entitlement. He travels around with a mass of classified documents and normally<br />
works while on his journeys. All that he<br />
did on this occasion was advance the aircraft's<br />
departure time by half an hour in<br />
order to see that his young daughter was<br />
given a proper opportunity to have hospital<br />
treatment. Some of the newspaper editorials<br />
directed towards this episode showed how<br />
malicious and unreasonable some elements<br />
of the Press can be when a public figure or<br />
a politician is involved in a matter. I take<br />
this opportunity to put the, facts before the<br />
House. I hope that I have given honourable<br />
members enough detailed material to enable<br />
them to see the operation of the service in<br />
its true perspective. If there are to be criticisms<br />
let them be honest criticisms, not<br />
politically motivated or designed to demean<br />
the politician in the eyes of those who are<br />
always too ready to accept criticisms of<br />
those of us who sit in this place. With this<br />
background I hope, that honourable members<br />
will be better equipped to deal with<br />
comments about this matter when they come<br />
under their notice. I present the following<br />
paper: Royal Australian Air Force VIEP Flight-Ministerial<br />
Statement, 4 October 1967.<br />
By Authority: A. J. Airnit, Commnonwealth Government Printer, Canberra </p>
