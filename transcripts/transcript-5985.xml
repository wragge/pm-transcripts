ALICE SPRINGS TO DARWIN RAILWAY BY 1988<br />
The Commonwealth Government has decided that the Alice Springs<br />
to Darwin railway will be completed by 1988 Australia's<br />
Bicentennial Year.<br />
This rail link will be of tremendous economic, social and defence<br />
significance to Australia and will be the largest currentrailway<br />
development project in the world. It will be completed<br />
at a cost of $ 545 million.<br />
There are 1,440 kilometres of track to be laid, almost twice the<br />
length of the new Tarcoola to Alice Springs railway. During<br />
the construction phase it will provide employment, both<br />
directly and indirectly, for over 1,250 people.<br />
The project will be of particular significance to South Australia,<br />
and the Northern Territory. For example, about 150,000 tonnes<br />
of steel rail will be required from Whyalla and more than<br />
2h million concrete or steel1 sleepers will beneeded. This'new<br />
production will provide much needed job opportunities and a<br />
welcome shot in the arm for the steel industry.<br />
The massive undertaking will provide long term benef its for<br />
all Australians.<br />
As well as breaking down the isolation of our North, the provision<br />
of fast, economic and reliable all-weather rail link, will be a<br />
boon to the economic and social development of the area. It will<br />
ensure effective competition between all modes of transport to.<br />
provide the most cost effective movement of qoods. It will give<br />
greater-accessibility for manufacturers, the mining industry<br />
and primary producers to domestic and international markets. It<br />
will also help this fascinating area of our continent realise its<br />
full tourist potential.<br />
I am confident that major development projects such as this<br />
capture the imagination of all Australians. They have the<br />
potential to stimulate our national pride and confidence.<br />
They demonstrate the need for us to set national goals. They<br />
reflect our confidence. in the future of our great nation.<br />
This project gives effect to an undertaking first made, to the nation<br />
by the Commonwealth in 1910. It will also bring forward the<br />
fulfilment of our 1980 election promise to complete the Alice<br />
Springs to Darwin railway in 10 years. We have an obligation to this<br />
land, which gives us so much, to ensure that such visionary projects<br />
are not just concepts but realities. Only then will we be well<br />
placed to reap the rewards of Australia for Australians.<br />
