PRBIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, MAY 4 1980<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The world is currently faced with a most dangerous position.<br />
It has come about-because in December, the Soviet Union sent,<br />
thousands of its troops into Afghanistan where-it-overturned<br />
the government of a non-aligned and independent country.<br />
It imposed military control, against the will of the people,<br />
over a sovereign state.<br />
The Soviet Union has acte, . and is continuing to act, brutally.<br />
It has thrust the most powerful ] and armyin the world into an<br />
S area of . great strategic sensitivity. The Soviet move into<br />
Afghanistan has the most profound implications for the.<br />
. stability of global order.<br />
It-. has had a destabilising effect on'the . whole south west<br />
Asian region. The Soviet Union is now well placed to intimidate<br />
-either. Pakistan-or Iran if a suitable opportunity presents itself,<br />
or can be manufactured, and to threaten the oil producing states<br />
of the Arabian-Gulf.<br />
It has called into question the whole basis of east-west<br />
relations, and raised the prospect of confrontation between<br />
the super powers. Recently, as you know, the situation in Iran<br />
has worsened. All the norms of accepted intefnation-al behaviour<br />
have beeh put aside.<br />
The seizure of the American hostages and their detention for<br />
almost six months is unforgivable and a gross breach of<br />
international'law. The government of Iran can no longer pretend that a group of<br />
so-called students was responsible for this seizure. The<br />
responsibility belongs to the government. It appears, however,<br />
that one of the very real problems in Iran is the. absence of<br />
one recognised power centre; there are several power centres,<br />
often competing with each other.<br />
Since the American rescue attempt, the difficulties for the<br />
United States in handlingthe hostage issue must have become<br />
more serious. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
We are all conscious of the risk that subsequent events could lead<br />
to an even more dangerous situation. 1n the ' short to mnedium termi,<br />
we cannot discount the possibility of Soviet influence or control<br />
over Middle. East oil supplies.*<br />
As'a counterforce to the insecuriLy and tensions building up<br />
in the world, a stronger western alliance is emerging an<br />
alliance which has developed a more unified approach and a<br />
common strategy in -seeking the achievements of shared goals<br />
and objectives.<br />
This visible and stronger alliance, particularly between<br />
Europe and North America, enormously strengthens the United States<br />
in its leadership role in containing the Soviet Union.<br />
It will greatly help in seeking to achieve the release of<br />
the hostages.<br />
The Australian Government is in strong support of the<br />
United States in its handling of the hostage issue in-Iran.<br />
President Carter's dec-ision to attempt the rescue of the<br />
hostages was a. conurageous one and it is a tragedy that the<br />
attempt was not successful. We have expressed our sympathy<br />
and support to President Carter and the United States people<br />
in their efforts to secure the release of the hostages and to<br />
contain the Soviet Union.<br />
The enormous responsibility which rests on the United States<br />
for leading the western alliance in maintaining the security of<br />
the free world imposes heavy burdens on President Carter and on<br />
his cabinet.<br />
The President's is an awesome and onerous job and a very lonely<br />
one. He deserves and needs goodwill and support from America's<br />
allies. This he will get from the Australian Government.<br />
So too, will his new Secretary of State, Sena~ tor Ed Muskie,<br />
whom I+ know and respect as a resolute and fair man.<br />
Australia is in no special position to point the way towards<br />
solutions to the problems besetting the world. We are, however,<br />
prepared to take actions in support of our conviztions and of'.<br />
our allies, for it is in concerted action and apiproach that we<br />
can best arrive at a settled world order.<br />
We have taken a series of trade and diplomatic actions in relation<br />
to Iran, in concert with the U. S. and her friends. The thrust<br />
of the position we have taken is similar to that taken by<br />
European nations, who are standing four square with the United<br />
states in these critical days. Australia will continue to support<br />
the United States in its desire to free the hostages, and will<br />
continue to take appropriate measures to help secure that<br />
objective. We shall continue those measures which will make sure that<br />
Australia's attitude towards the Soviet Union and its invasion<br />
of Afghanistan are registered with absolute clarity. ./ 3 </p>

Four decades ago the world embarked on the terrible conflict<br />
which Winston Churchill rightly called, " the unnecessary war".<br />
It was unnecessary because comparatively modest steps would<br />
have been sufficient to deter it had they been taken early<br />
enough. In the name of peace and business-as-usual, those steps were<br />
not taken.<br />
Those who advocated them, including Churchill himself, were<br />
denounced as war mongers. It would be tragic-indeed it would<br />
be disastrous for the human race if that mistake were ever<br />
made again.<br />
The case for a firm, measured and sustained response to the<br />
present crisis the case for giving effective support to the<br />
United States is essential in order to avoid another unnecessary<br />
war. </p>
