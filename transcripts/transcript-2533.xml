S'tatemtent by the Prime D-in ste-, The Rt Hon. Willl)* a-. MCidon<br />
In my opening stateme(-nt to the Conference ( copie-S of wh-ich<br />
have been circulated) I outlined. the Coutmornwea2th's a., sessmezmc<br />
of the economic sit-oation arid orosP,_ c-L and indlicatcd in boroad<br />
terms the programme of action which the Government Ilad developedt<br />
on the basis of its det'ailed review of the_. eCcomty. This review<br />
Was, of course, consi ~ tent with our commitment tc keep the<br />
economy under review but it was also undertakon, ! having in m~ ind<br />
the opportunity today c Conference presented, to -take into<br />
account the views of the Premiers on our assessm~ ent and oi.. our<br />
programme. The proqramnxe I outlined to-, Å he Premiers this morniLno<br />
was to increase unemployment-" benefits and associated short<br />
term sickness and special benefit. for adult males -froin<br />
per week -to $ 17 per week with commensurate increases<br />
for juniors;<br />
-to i4ncrease the amtount of the qr-r a nts T intro_' uceO last<br />
Decermber for emplo) ent-cxeatinq activities in nonmetropolitan<br />
areaas from $ 2 .25 mill ion per montCh to e. 4<br />
million per morith a rate' of $ 48 million per yea~ c;<br />
t~ o restore the special investment allowance on investment<br />
in new manu,_ acturing-. plant and, equipment as from this day<br />
in tef rm n vWhich it previd6usly existed.<br />
to seek agreement to increases in the States' works and<br />
housing and seni -, qovernment borrowing prognrammnes.<br />
In discussion with the Treasurer and myself the Premiers<br />
indicated that they welcomed the proposals, both for theirbeneficial<br />
effect-oil the ecoainy and particularly on unemp'loyment_,<br />
but also for their impact on the social hardship of some indivic~ uals<br />
in the community. </p>

In P. y openii n, statement thi s morrrig i had sai. 1 tbal--A* 1n<br />
the light of the Government's overall objectives, includ ncr<br />
maintaining t-he momentum of economnic growth an' henc e of emp-loyrient<br />
we believe there is a case ." or an increase both in the States, works<br />
arid housing and! semi-governrient prograinxnes, anid I noted that an<br />
in~ crease in the works and housing programme i. whIrich miglit be agreed<br />
would involve the Commonwealth in taking up pa: rt of-" such an increas3<br />
in the form of interest-free capital grant. Ifl reaching this view<br />
whad noted that within the overall picture of rather stronger<br />
growth in public sector expenditure this year than last year,<br />
total public authority capital. expenditure is growing more Slowly<br />
than current expenditure. Moreover, despite considerable spf: cial<br />
assistance from the Common: weaith, rapidly escalating wage costs<br />
had meant that in 1970-71 a number of intportanit State works had<br />
had to be deferred. Similarly, the works activities of certain<br />
of the State semi-governmental and local autriorities have also<br />
had to be curtailed and the Prcmiers had indicated in discussion<br />
that they welcomed some increase in this'area. Additionally,<br />
of course, the loan raising programmes have been very successful<br />
in this financial year to date.<br />
After the fullest considtraton of the evidence and<br />
arguments : produced by thc States full agreem~ ent has been reaichod<br />
by the Loan Council on the amo~ nts of the increases of these<br />
programmes. The amounts now agreed are<br />
for the works and housing programmes an increase of<br />
$ 32 million;<br />
for the semi= governmental programme an increase of $, 0m~ lon.<br />
It has been agreed that the works and housing programmes<br />
of the' States for 1971-72 will be increased by $ 32 million,<br />
bringing the total to $ 892 million. This increase is made up of<br />
mili! lion on the same basi-s as the existing programme that<br />
is, approximately one-quarter is -interest-free capital grant<br />
and the remainder loan money with the ramaining $ 2 million<br />
being entirely interest-free grant.<br />
The additional $ 2 million interest-free capital grant has<br />
been provided by the Commonwealth having regard to the continuing<br />
costs in which the States will be involved in administering the </p>

lesthan the -total of such programie in 1971-7 2 as decidod! at this<br />
m.~ eeting. In agreeing to the Commonwealth proposa~ l to -incr2-ase<br />
the borrowi-ng pro:-rarmmes, the Premiers have given their<br />
assurance that the additional funds rwill, sC) far as is practicable<br />
without loss of efficiency and ef-fectiveness, be untilised auic,: 1iy.<br />
having in mind the desirability of procucinq-an early impact on<br />
emnployment. In my opening statement I said that Premier5 -might also<br />
wish to consid: er riot only their loan programm~ nes bt~ t also their<br />
prospective revenue buadgets for-1971-72, and 1 assured t hem that<br />
we would listen carefully -to anything that they might care to<br />
put on this aspect. I did poirnt out, howeve) r that revisions<br />
to elements of the formula determining the financ4* al assistance<br />
grants to be paid to the States-in-1l07l-72 indicate that the<br />
amount the States will . recqeive by way of ge neral revenue assistance<br />
this financial year presently cald'ulated to increase 1) y the<br />
order of $ 20 million.<br />
In the event, we have today had a very frank disd'ijssion. of<br />
this aspect of the States, finances.<br />
All the Premiers indicated their budgetary position.<br />
Followi. 7ng a very full discussion, a special general revenue<br />
grant of $ 15 million will be made by the Commonwealth to the<br />
_ ri 1971 This will De distributed between the States on the<br />
S?. l9basis as the financial assistai~ ce jgrants.-( The figurec for<br />
individual States are shown in the-attached Tabl~ e.<br />
New South Wales cJearly has a much greater budgetary problem<br />
in 1971/ 72 than any of th,-other States. The Commnonwealth has<br />
therefore agreed to extend additional assistancc to that State in<br />
ordE--r ; to enable it to avoid taking extreme nmeasures to improve its<br />
budgetary position. A lcai of $ 17.5 million will be provid'sd hy the<br />
Commonwealth to New South Wales this financial year on terms anm'.<br />
condi tions similar to the loan made available to Victoria for t-he<br />
same purpose at the cndI of 1969-70. The loan will be made on the<br />
basis set out in the Attachmepnt.<br />
