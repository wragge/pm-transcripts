FOR PRESS 9 JANUARY 1977<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY: 9.00 pm<br />
ADDRESS TO THE NATIONAL CHRISTIAN YOUTH CONVENTION, CANBERRA<br />
I am pleased to be with you tonight at your ninth National<br />
Christian Youth Convention.<br />
It is a particular pleasure to welcome to Australia delegates<br />
and distinguished visitors from overseas. The fact that the<br />
Convention has been able to attract so many people from so many<br />
nations is a tribute to the continuing vitality of the Convention.<br />
The response to the Convention has, I am advised, been unparalleled.<br />
This is not surprising given the relevance and the diverSity Of the<br />
issues which the Convention will discuss.<br />
The Convention of-fers an outstanding opportunity for young people<br />
of'different backgrounds and nationalities to come together and<br />
grapple with some of the basic problems and significant issues<br />
which concern modern societies. Issues such as the nature of<br />
personal relationships, contemporary moral problems, the nature<br />
of personal freedom and education, the problems of the disadvantaged,<br />
religious ethics are of fundamental importance to contemporary<br />
society as they have been to all societies across history. It<br />
is particularly important that young people have opportunities<br />
to come together and discuss such issues thoroughly.<br />
What differentiates young people from older people is tha~ t theirs<br />
is a learning period, a time of growth and development.<br />
Conventions such as this have an enormously important contribution<br />
to make to this process of development by giving young PE: 00le the.<br />
opportunity to participate in a community, to live and to work<br />
together. In this community, for an intense although short period,<br />
young people can test their ideas against others, refine and<br />
elaborate them, and sometimes change their ideas. It would be<br />
facile to suggest that what would emerge is a unified consensus<br />
on all the issues discussed. Young-people are as diverse-in their<br />
political, social and philosophical perspectives as are people<br />
over thirty. But by bringing fresh perspectives to bear on<br />
/ social </p>
<p>-2-<br />
social issues, young people can assist in clarifying the nature<br />
of these issues, and improve on existing solutions.<br />
This Government is seeking to develop youth policies which will<br />
support the process of continuing individual growth, and contribute<br />
to establishing a society in which every individual has the<br />
opportunity to develop his full potential. This goal cannot<br />
be achieved by Government alone. All sections of the community<br />
should be involved, and most importantly, young people themselves<br />
should be involved -as masters of their own destiny.<br />
To achieve a society in which all people have the opportunity to<br />
realise their potential, the diversity of contemporary society and<br />
contemporary youth must be recognised. There must also be a<br />
balanced relationship between Government initiatives ' and the many<br />
voluntary agencies and organisations which are associated with youth.<br />
A practical example of the way in which the Government is seeking to<br />
contribute to this type of relationship is the Community Youth<br />
Support Scheme. This scheme is designed to encourage community<br />
involvement in the provision of supportive programmes and services<br />
to the young unemployed. Support under this scheme will be provided<br />
for job search orientation groups and for voluntary community activities<br />
which perform a useful function for the individuals involved and the<br />
community. These include, among other things, the organisation of<br />
youth recreation activities, social service activities, minor<br />
maintenance to community facilities, and social surveys. I<br />
Support is also being provided to enable the sharing of knowledge<br />
and skills with other unemployed who could assist in imparting basic<br />
job skills.<br />
Another approach which has also been taken to the problem of the<br />
young unemployed is the establishment of the special youth employment<br />
training scheme. This subsidises employers providing training for<br />
the young unemployed. In the first instance, priority was given to<br />
school leavers from 1975 who had been unable to establish themselves<br />
in stable employment. The scheme took off from the moment it began.<br />
The acceptance the programme achieved in the community and<br />
particularly with employers, enabled-the Government to extend the<br />
conditions for entry. By mid-December, 3,600 young people had been<br />
placed in employment under the scheme.<br />
Both these schemes are practical demonstrations of the Government's<br />
resolve to develop a creative relationship between the Government<br />
and voluntary sector in meeting the issues faced by young adults.<br />
Unemployment among the young is a particularly significant problem<br />
because of the loss of self-esteem and dignity brought by the<br />
prolonged inability to participate in productive employment.<br />
There are also a number of other concerns and issues facing<br />
young people. / Cabinet </p>
<p>3<br />
Cabinet has considered reDresentations from individuals and<br />
organisations on the establishment of a Youth Bureau and an<br />
inquiry has been established to report on youth matters generally.<br />
It has been asked to examine the advantages of establishing a<br />
Youth Bureau or Youth Advisory Panel to advise the Government<br />
on all youth matters. Through the inquiry, the Government seeks<br />
to identify the issues affecting youth and their needs to examine<br />
the services provided by voluntary organisations and the three<br />
spheres of Government and how these may be improved.<br />
The inquiry will also look at how overseas experience can be<br />
used to assist in the development of models of youth consultative.<br />
and co-ordinating machinery. The inquiry will provide an important<br />
way through which Government can obtain the views of youth across<br />
the broad spectrum of issues.<br />
If we are to make progress in coming to grips with the problems<br />
facing Australian society and Australia's young people, we must<br />
be willing to get the benefit of a variety of perspectives and<br />
at least be forced to argue our position through.<br />
This Convention will make a valuable contribution to the process<br />
of discussion, of reasoning together, and I wish it every success.<br />
I have great pleasure in declaring this Convention open. I<br />
