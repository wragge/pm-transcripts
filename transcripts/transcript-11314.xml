    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..................</p>
<p>  Thank you very much Ita. To Dr John Keniery, Mr Charles Jamieson, to John</p>
<p>   Olsen the Premier of South Australia, my Ministerial colleagues, Larry Anthony,</p>
<p>   Judith Troeth, my Parliamentary Secretary colleague, other very distinguished</p>
<p>   guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>  It's a great delight, I think for the first time as Prime Minister to attend</p>
<p>   this very important event. And it's an occasion not only to say a couple</p>
<p>   of things, as Prime Ministers are want to do on occasions like this with</p>
<p>   captive audiences, about the superb economic performance of the Government,</p>
<p>   but it's also an opportunity to honour the real heroes of the Australian</p>
<p>   economic performance over the last couple of years and that is the exporters</p>
<p>   of Australia.</p>
<p>  If I had addressed you one year or two years ago I probably wouldn't have</p>
<p>   been able to report as robustly as I can tonight on the general health of</p>
<p>   the Australian economy. A year ago even we'd have looked forward with some</p>
<p>   foreboding about the potential impact of the Asian economic downturn on</p>
<p>   our economy. That we have been able to stare down that economic collapse</p>
<p>   and have come out of it in a sense stronger and better than ever is due</p>
<p>   to a lot of things. But one of the things it is really due to was the capacity</p>
<p>   of the exporters of Australia to switch their export focus away from the</p>
<p>   disappearing markets in the collapsing Asian economies towards new and expanding</p>
<p>   markets in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>  They were aided and abetted by a very flexibly and sensibly administered</p>
<p>   exchange rate policy. But without a great deal of Australian grit and determination</p>
<p>   and application it simply wouldn't have been possible. So on behalf of the</p>
<p>   Government I express my and the gratitude of my colleagues for the tremendous</p>
<p>   effort put in by the exporters of Australia particularly over the last couple</p>
<p>   of years.</p>
<p>  The last 12 months of course has been a very important policy year for the</p>
<p>   exporters of Australia because they are amongst the biggest winners from</p>
<p>   the Government's major overhaul of the Australian taxation system. There's</p>
<p>   always a danger with something like tax reform that we tend to get preoccupied</p>
<p>   with and bogged down by the minutiae, and the micro aspects of its implementation.</p>
<p>   And we think too much about the detailed application of it in this or that</p>
<p>   sector. And we lose sight of the enormous generic national economic benefits</p>
<p>   that taxation reform brings. And one of the great, and it can't be overstated,</p>
<p>   benefits of the introduction of a goods and services tax and the removal</p>
<p>   of the old indirect tax system which will occur on the 1st of</p>
<p>   July next year, is the tremendous boost that it will give to exports from</p>
<p>   this country. All exports will be free of the GST. It will make us more</p>
<p>   competitive in world markets. It will give us a chance to punch even more</p>
<p>   effectively against those competitors who've had the advantage of a more</p>
<p>   modern taxation system up until now. So amongst the many beneficiaries of</p>
<p>   taxation reform are the exporters of Australia. And it's been calculated</p>
<p>   that the benefit to them of the new taxation system is in the order of $7</p>
<p>   billion to $8 billion a year. And that is another $7 billion or $8 billion</p>
<p>   of competitive edge and advantage that Australian exporters will have available</p>
<p>   to them from the first of July next year.</p>
<p>  I'm very conscious ladies and gentlemen as I speak that over in Seattle</p>
<p>   a World Trade Organisation meeting is taking place. The publicity so far</p>
<p>   coming out of the meeting is about some organised demonstrations in the</p>
<p>   streets of Seattle. I can't imagine less well directed, less intelligent</p>
<p>   demonstrations than those that are taking place in Seattle because if you</p>
<p>   really want to cripple the future growth prospects of the poor nations of</p>
<p>   the world, if you really want to leave in the hands of a number of relatively</p>
<p>   rich and highly protective trade policy nations of the world, then you will</p>
<p>   condemn the current World Trade Organisation meeting in Seattle to failure.</p>
<p>   Because in the long run developing countries have more to gain from opening</p>
<p>   up world trading opportunities than many, not all, but many of the developed</p>
<p>   countries.</p>
<p>  It is only through building market access that many of the least developed</p>
<p>   countries in the world can have a show of lifting their standards of living.</p>
<p>   And if you look at those countries that were once poorly developed, that</p>
<p>   have grown dramatically over the last thirty years, it is those countries</p>
<p>   that have aggressively pursued export opportunities and have aggressively</p>
<p>   utilised market openings that have been made available to them. So not only</p>
<p>   do I want that meeting to succeed for Australia's sake and it's very important</p>
<p>   that it does because it can't be said too frequently that the world trading</p>
<p>   system is still weighted against efficient agricultural producers in particular</p>
<p>   such as Australia.</p>
<p>  But I also want that world trade round to succeed in the name and in the</p>
<p>   interests of the least developed countries of the world. And this is a message</p>
<p>   that was not lost on some of the poorest nations that were represented at</p>
<p>   the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Durban in South Africa which</p>
<p>   I attended a few weeks ago on behalf of Australia. They were intelligent</p>
<p>   enough and sensible enough to see that in the long run they had an enormous</p>
<p>   amount to gain from the prizing open of the large and growing markets of</p>
<p>   the more developed part of the world.</p>
<p>  We live forever in a globalised world. We can't stop it, we can't change</p>
<p>   it, we can't get off it. And those who pretend that we can are deluding</p>
<p>   themselves. There is no refuge in going back to protectionism and the erection</p>
<p>   of old barriers but there is a responsibility on governments to explain</p>
<p>   better the benefits of more open trade. To use the right language, to talk</p>
<p>   about freer trade and more open trade rather than free trade because no</p>
<p>   nation practices perfect free trade. Australia doesn't and nor does any</p>
<p>   other country. And we have an obligation to explain to our population better</p>
<p>   the benefits of more open trade. To translate into hard concrete examples</p>
<p>   the benefits of a more open trading environment. And one of the ways we</p>
<p>   do that is to hail and applaud those who are achievers and performers on</p>
<p>   the export markets of Australia.</p>
<p>  We are deservedly as a nation intensely proud of our sporting achievers.</p>
<p>   And I can't think in all the years I have been following sport in Australia,</p>
<p>   and that's been most of my life, I can't think of a year when Australia</p>
<p>   both on an individual basis and in team sport has had a greater year of</p>
<p>   achievement in sport than this current year. But not only should we laud</p>
<p>   and magnify them for what they have done but we should equally hail and</p>
<p>   acclaim those people who are great successes in business, great successes</p>
<p>   in the arts and particularly great successes in export performance. Because</p>
<p>   the future economic strength of Australia will ultimately come down, with</p>
<p>   a nation of fewer than 20 million people, to our capacity to aggressively</p>
<p>   and competitively trade in every area of economic activity around the world.</p>
<p>  And that is why tonight is very important to me, it's very important to</p>
<p>   the Government. We have at the moment probably, in generic terms, the strongest</p>
<p>   economy Australia has had for the last 30 years perhaps since the end of</p>
<p>   World War II. The fundamentals are better now than they were in the late</p>
<p>   1960s because then we had a far more closed, cloistered and protected economy.</p>
<p>   We now have an economy that's torn down many of those old protective barriers</p>
<p>   and an economy which is expanding into new areas undreamt of only a few</p>
<p>   years ago.</p>
<p>  So we have great opportunities but that puts a special obligation on all</p>
<p>   of us who are involved in any position of leadership be it in government</p>
<p>   or in business to better explain and communicate to the people of our own</p>
<p>   nation the benefits of opening things up and liberalising things. Because</p>
<p>   unless we do that we run the risk of losing the argument to populist clamour.</p>
<p>  And we must also remember, ladies and gentlemen, that when the entire nation</p>
<p>   is doing well those within our midst who are not doing well feel the difference</p>
<p>   even more keenly. All disadvantage within a society does tend to be relative.</p>
<p>   And it is true although the national strength of the Australian economy</p>
<p>   is greater than it's been for many decades there are regions of Australia,</p>
<p>   particularly outside the metropolitan areas, which are doing it tough.</p>
<p>  And I was reminded of this when I read the other day the disaggregated figures</p>
<p>   of the Australian Bureau of Statistics on unemployment levels which disclosed,</p>
<p>   for example, that in the Northern Beach area of Sydney the unemployment</p>
<p>   rate is about 1.8 per cent, the lower North Shore, 1.7 per cent, the Eastern</p>
<p>   Suburbs of Sydney about 2 per cent and even in the central western suburbs</p>
<p>   of Sydney only about 4 per cent. Yet when you get out into the regions and</p>
<p>   you get into the Wide Bay, Burnett district of rural Queensland, for example,</p>
<p>   the level is 12 to 13 per cent. And that is an illustration that where there</p>
<p>   are sections of the Australian community that are not sharing the boom times,</p>
<p>   they are not sharing the generic national prosperity that we acknowledge</p>
<p>   tonight. And that puts a great obligation on all of us to keep that in mind.</p>
<p>   It puts an obligation on us to always explain and communicate in language</p>
<p>   that people can clearly understand the benefit of more open trade, the benefits</p>
<p>   of exports, the jobs that are created by export performance and export achievement.</p>
<p>  And I want to congratulate all of Australia's exporters tonight. I particularly</p>
<p>   acknowledge the contribution of those who will be announced as award winners.</p>
<p>   You have done great things for our country. You have played a major role</p>
<p>   in the economic resurgence of Australia. You played a crucial role in piloting</p>
<p>   Australia through what could have been an enormous economic challenge but,</p>
<p>   in fact, has turned out to be a great economic triumph. And that is our</p>
<p>   capacity and our strength as a nation to stare down the worst economic downturn</p>
<p>   our region has seen and in that the exporters of Australia have played an</p>
<p>   absolutely indispensable role. Thank you.</p>
