OPENING OF T14E GMX' S ENAMEL FAINT FACTORY PROJECT<br />
ELIZABETH ADELAIDE, 20 MARCH 1992<br />
Mr Smith, Premnier Bannon, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
This ceremonvy marks another significant investment by GMH<br />
in Australia, and further entrenches its commitment to<br />
this state and this nation.<br />
It is a $ 120 million re-affirmation of confidence in the<br />
future of car making in Australia.<br />
More than that, it demonstrates the company's confidence<br />
in the industry's ability to be world competitive.<br />
It is an investment which recognises not only the need to<br />
embrace international best practice in quality and<br />
standards, but our ability to do it.<br />
I congratulate GMH on their confidence and vision.<br />
I also believe the union movement has reason to be proud<br />
today. The success of this investment is assured by their<br />
recognition of the need for an effective partnership with<br />
management. Such partnerships are at the heart of the government's<br />
strategy for our economic future, which is embodied in<br />
the One Nati~ on statement.<br />
In recent years there has been a great change in the<br />
industrial cultu re of Australia, and that is what we are<br />
going to build on.<br />
There is a new understanding, a new recognition of what<br />
can be done. </p>
<p>101 -2<br />
With it comes new confidence and, with that, most<br />
importantly, new jobs.<br />
And there are more grounds than this for confidence.<br />
The productivity and export competitiveness of our<br />
efficient manufacturing industries is growing year by<br />
year. In the motor vehicle industry exports have increased by<br />
more than 1.50% since 1984; from $ 369 million to over<br />
$ 950 million i-n 1990.<br />
The figure for 1991 is expected to be in excess of $ 1.1<br />
billion, and by the end of the century our automotive<br />
exports will exceed $ 2 billion in today's dollars.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Just as we are witnessing the emergence of a new car<br />
industry, so w-e will see the emergence of a much stronger<br />
Australia in thie 1990s.<br />
The fundamentals are being put in place.<br />
Low interest rates, low inflation, lower labour costs and<br />
the new industrial culture are making us more competitive<br />
on world markets.<br />
The initiatives taken in the One Nation document will<br />
take us further -much further.<br />
This new emphasis on partnership, on pooling our energy<br />
and ideas, on shared national goals, combined with the<br />
great infrastruCture projects, higher quality training<br />
support, greater incentives to investment -when One<br />
Nation begins to work its chemistry we will see just how<br />
strong Australia can be.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen.<br />
General Motors H-olden has long been a household name in<br />
Australia, and this new project says very clearly to the<br />
country that It will continue to be.<br />
We welcome that and congratulate the Company and all<br />
those associated with this project.<br />
And we wish it: well in the future.<br />
Thank you. </p>
