PRIME MINISTER'S TOUR OF SOUTH-EAST ASIA<br />
Speech given by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold f<br />
at a Government Luncheon at Sjgapore in reply to a'<br />
speech of welcome by the Singapore Acting Prime<br />
Minister, Dr. Toh Chin Chye 29TH APRIL, 1966<br />
Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, your Ministerial colleagues<br />
and distinguished guests<br />
Thank you very warmly, Dr. Toh, for your warmth of<br />
welcome to me and to those who have accompanied me as we have gone<br />
about this phase of our journey here in Singapore.<br />
As you have put it to us, Australia has a long friendly<br />
association going back throu h some of the dramatic episodes of<br />
this uarter of a century which has now passed since the militar<br />
operations in which we found ourselves involved at the time of I<br />
Second World War. And that represented a watershed of history in<br />
the life of the Australian people as far as this area of the world<br />
is concerned. You have stressed the fact that the first major journey<br />
I have made as Prime Minister has been to various centres here in<br />
South-East Asia. I don't think this follows, that I have for the<br />
first time realised the importance of the area.<br />
This can I think, represent a new phase in the relationship<br />
between Australia and the area, but of course we have been<br />
actively interested in this area of the world at least dating back<br />
to the lime that I have mentioned.<br />
There was first our involvement with you here at the time<br />
of the Japanese invasion. There was later our association through<br />
the lon and difficult period of the emergency when the guerilla<br />
activities had to be eliminated, we with other friendly Commonwealth<br />
forces. And now, in association with other Commonwealth forces,<br />
wteh ath avwee htahvies bpehaens e liofn kerde sitsotgientgh erth ei np rsoomcee ssoefs thoef mcoornef rsoingtnaitfiiocna, n tso<br />
episodes and phases of historical development in South-East Asia<br />
over these years in the military field.<br />
But, of course, there has also been an active and regular<br />
contact between us in the field of trade and commerce.<br />
You have always maintained a very active entrepot trade.<br />
lany Australians have passed through here, either as tourists or<br />
en route to the United Kingdom and Europe, and you have come to be<br />
known to us I think, better than almost any other country, and<br />
certainly almost any city, in Asia.<br />
More of our people are aware of what Singapore has to<br />
offer this very colourful, rich and most exotic city which for<br />
many Australians is the first point of contact they make with the<br />
countries of Asia.<br />
Now we find ourselves considering together some problems<br />
which you have directly in your own economic efforts and your own<br />
security, but we also find we have a common interest and concern<br />
in developments in the South-East Asian area. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
And it is in relation to these that my own visit has been<br />
of considerable value to me, and I hope that as a result of the<br />
discussions that I have been able to engage in with yourselves,<br />
and with the other Jovernments that I have been in contact with<br />
in recent days, our store of knowledge will have been increased<br />
and we will be better equippoed to inform our own judgment as to<br />
the courses we should be following in the future.<br />
We are together in one of the critical periods cf the<br />
history of mankind as I see it, and there will be in the period<br />
ahead of us three factors which will not only make this a<br />
critical area for the future of mankind, but which will involve<br />
our omwn countries very directly.<br />
The first of these is the revolution of change that is<br />
going on in Asia generally; not merely a revolution in the expecations<br />
of people, their hopes for a better order of life but<br />
actual changes which are taking place in the way of life that they<br />
have known for centuries.<br />
And secondly, there is the impact which inevitably will be<br />
made increasingly in the years ahead from the rapid growth of<br />
population in the area. The better health standards, a higher<br />
rate of survival and so, taken all round, such a rapid mte of<br />
growth of population that it has been estimated that the fifteen<br />
hundred million people of Asia will be some three throusand million<br />
by the end of this century.<br />
Now this quite obviously poses problems of adequacy of<br />
supply, the need for efficient distribution, the removal of the<br />
causes of strife so that the productive efforts of the area can<br />
be rost effectively prganised to meet this situation. And yet<br />
while we are facing these tasks, we have to contend also with the<br />
cancerous growth of communism in certain parts of the area to<br />
which I refer.<br />
There is the communism of China itself. Well, we don't<br />
contest the right of any country to make its own choice of the<br />
kind of government or system of society by which it wishes to<br />
live. What we do contest is the efforts made by the aggressors<br />
to impose their systems on those who would prefer the system of<br />
their own choice, and just as we have joined together in resisting<br />
the aggression which threatened to dislocate your own country's<br />
domestic and economic life, so we have felt bound to join with<br />
others in resisting that aggression in Viet Nam.<br />
I have come from there with a feeling of encouragement as<br />
to the future, without understatin the many difficulties, both<br />
of the political, economic and military kind that lie ahead.<br />
But I think that daylight can be seen, and that there is a<br />
prospect for stability in the not too distant future.<br />
Now we are linked by our geography, by our history, by the<br />
destiny which places us together in the midst of these quite<br />
historic developments, and with a tradition and practice of<br />
friendship between our two countries which should encourage us,<br />
and indeed enable us, by our own discussions together, to make<br />
some contribution to the future of this part of the world.<br />
It is in that apirit that I have joined in the talks with<br />
your colleagues this morning. It is in that spirit that I hope<br />
That Australia's friendly association with your country will<br />
continue through the years ahead.<br />
Please convey to your Prime Minister, when you are next<br />
in touch with him my own best wishes and those of my Government.<br />
We hope that we sall be seeing him again soon, and that in the<br />
years ahead, Singapore will find a way through its problems. </p>
<p>I -3-<br />
What you-rhave -said to us about your trade difficulties and<br />
the need to ind some solution of that will be studied sympathetically,<br />
as a good friend of the country should. And you wi1ll be<br />
hear n from us on that matter after I have been able to discuss<br />
these hings which we have had outlined together for us today and<br />
which I know you already communicated on in more detail with my<br />
own government. We shall discus', those when an early opportunity<br />
presents itself.<br />
And so, good wishes to you, and through you to the people of<br />
Singapore and my thanks on behalf of my colleagues here with me<br />
today and myselT for the generosity of your hospitality and warmth<br />
of your greeting to us. </p>
