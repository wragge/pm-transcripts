INTINJPIATI. N. L ALIR TRA'SPORi T A3SOCIATICN ME2&amp;, ING<br />
In Sydney. 3rd October. 1963.<br />
Speech byZ the Prime iinis ter the Rt. Hon. Menzies<br />
I am delighted to be here this morning under your<br />
presidency, because really Sir Kudson Fysh is one of the most<br />
remarkable of living Austr:: aians. He was the true pioneer of<br />
commercial flying in Australia. I have no doubt that back in<br />
those earlier days he thought this vas a bold stroke to start a<br />
-thing and call it Queensland Northern Territories Aerial<br />
Services hop from here to there, and hop back again. with a<br />
little bit of luck. That is how it all be:, an. Now it is one of<br />
the great airlines of the world. And the man rho began it and<br />
who thought of himself, first of all primarily, I hage no doubt,<br />
as a pilot and an adienturer, still remains an adventurer. But<br />
he has in one sense ceased to be c pilot and become a pirate,<br />
because he tarns out to have, and unexpectedly in those<br />
circumstances, a positive flair for business, for driving an<br />
enterprise on he saw , rith an eye of imagination all round the<br />
world and, what is more, he has, in my experience ( and I don't<br />
want to say this to encourage any of the others of you) an<br />
unrivalled capacity for rifling the Treasury.<br />
Now, Sir, having said that and all the good bi. ts<br />
about you are completely true I just want to tell you that at<br />
the week-end I thought " Jhat can I say in opening a conference of<br />
this kind? I suppose I ought to be completely agreeable and<br />
pat everybody on the back". But when I sat down I found that at<br />
the end of two hours all the things I had thought of about<br />
aviation, about civil aviation, were extremely disagreeable. I<br />
recall the fact that over the better part of a million miles I<br />
have been sitting in mid-air in my time trying to think and<br />
failing, trying to read and failing, arriving at the other end<br />
in a state of complete intellectual dejection, being cross<br />
examined by people in press conference and television interview.,<br />
people who had been to bed the previous night. One has some<br />
of these strange memories.<br />
Indeed I ' ant to tell you this great historic<br />
disclosure: I am a fairly senior sort of Prime Minister<br />
attending Prime Ministers' Conferences and about 5 or 6 years<br />
ago, attending one, I proposed that we should form a Prime<br />
Ministers' Union. iWell, of course, you know not all Prime<br />
Ministers appreciate that kind of remark and so it was rather<br />
badly received. I said, " Well, it's perfectly simple. The<br />
union has only one rule. It won't have anything to do with<br />
-ages and conditions or any of that sort of thing we ill do<br />
the best we can in those departments ourselves but" I said,<br />
" there must be one rule and that is No press or television<br />
interview . rithin 24 hours of arriving after a flight of not less<br />
than 3,000 miles". I said that to give Diefenbaker a chance<br />
from Canada. And do you kno, that with the exception of my<br />
support, this wise, humane proposal this statesmanlike idea was<br />
unanimously rejected. They all went away feeling that I was an<br />
extraordinarily frivolous fellow and I have never had the same<br />
status in a Prime Ministers' Conference since.<br />
But, Sir, in spite of these qualified remarks about<br />
flying, let us agree that flying is here and your business is to<br />
make flying better, safer, more economical, meaning by that<br />
economically -ore sound, I may say something about those things<br />
in a moment, but before I do I just want to remind myself and<br />
all of you, of some of the benefits that have come to us hrough<br />
flying. </p>
<p>A great deal of trouble in the -orld has arisen from<br />
notions of insularity, each country tending to live to itself,<br />
drag its cloak about it, feel that it is a better country than<br />
any other and that on the -hole it is prudent not to know the<br />
neighbours. This idea of insularity is an idea which has, in<br />
our lifetime assailed even the greatest of nations and what<br />
flying? international flying, has done, perhaps more than any<br />
other instrumentality, is to break down this feeling of<br />
insularity. Thousands more people, to take the example of<br />
Australia, zisit us and we visit them. Thousands of people, in<br />
an early day and by other means perhaps, saw little of us except<br />
the ports, and ports with great respecc to Sydney are seldom<br />
the most fascinating parts of a country. Lots of people who<br />
did not ; et beyond the ports now by reason of the greater speed<br />
of arrival and the more time that they have available to them,<br />
see a great deal more of the country and that goes for the<br />
people of our ow. n who travel abroad.<br />
Then, inside our own country and this is worth<br />
remembering in Australia, a country roughly the size of the<br />
United States of America with only 10 million people flying<br />
has done more than any othe4' thing in our history to eliminate<br />
many of the symptoms and disabilities of remoteness in our<br />
country. A country like ours wiill never develop unless those<br />
people who have the feeling cen be encouraged to live and work in<br />
remote places: otherwise we shall be all city heads and nothing<br />
else. Before flying, a man was remote in the centre of<br />
Australia. A man who was in the far outback was indeed removed<br />
from his fellowmnen. He indeed felt the great loneliness that can<br />
come to a man, and that can come to a woman, to the wives even<br />
more so. 3ut today with our air services instead of being weeks<br />
away from other people, people are only hours away from other<br />
people. We have great things like the Flying Doctor Service in<br />
Australia. This is one of our prides and joys. People who on . e<br />
would have been left almost literally to die in remote places are<br />
today, rithin a few hours call by a flying doctor and a proper<br />
medical aerial sarvice.<br />
People get letters more frequently. They have the<br />
great and stimulating advantage of leading the newspapers more<br />
frequently, which is an awfully good thing for the digestion<br />
because it stirs something up in you.<br />
So, Sir, I believe that inside Australia and outside<br />
Australia commercial flying has a great record and an even<br />
greater opportunity in the future. But when I have said that I<br />
want to turn from prestige to the work of your great Association.<br />
I may tell you at once that its recording system is remarkably<br />
good because Twhen I said, as one does on these occasions, " Have<br />
they sent me any dope so that I will know rhat to talk about?<br />
Has Sir Hudson Fysh drafted a speech for me?" or words to that<br />
effect, the answer was to bring indeed all the speeches made by<br />
the presidents and the heads of governments welcoming conferences<br />
of IATA since it began. I want to tell you that I am a glutton<br />
for punishment: I read the lot. But I still found myself left<br />
with this: W'hat is it that you are doing? Tell you are, I<br />
believre, primarily engaged in developing what in effect is a<br />
co-operative system, a system based on mutual understanding and<br />
mutual willingness to help and to eliminate absurd things. I<br />
believe that if you can do this to perfection, the future of<br />
aviation is going to be much better than even its very<br />
remarkable past. </p>
<p>And safety: you know we road the newspapers and from<br />
time to time we read of another crash somewhere. These are<br />
dreadful things but, . rhen you compare them against the enormous<br />
number of millions of people carried safely every year, I<br />
venture to say that one of the most astonishing things in the<br />
history of civil aviation has been the safety factor; and I<br />
dare say that it is a rapidly growing safety factor when you<br />
consider the enormous demand on air services. This doesn't<br />
happen by chance. This happens by tremendous scientific<br />
researd by vast expenditures on safety measures, vast<br />
expenditures on the machinery, the tackle that is needed in<br />
order to control flying, in order to make air movements safe<br />
movements. I know that there are organisations which have,<br />
perhaps, a more particular interest in that mattor and a more<br />
particular responsibility than you have but another thing which<br />
must have given you great exercise is that there is, alter all,<br />
a disposition in the :. orld to say, " We have an . irline, our<br />
prestige requires that , we should, so to speak, have no connection<br />
with the firm next door". I can o1ll imagine that it is not a<br />
simple matter to get a areat number of airlines together and get<br />
them to work out ways and means of the interchange of their<br />
services, the working out of routes so that people, instead of<br />
having to be precipitated at their ultimate destination iith the<br />
highest speed ill be able to change over, will be able to pause<br />
hero have a look at this country, learn something about this<br />
country, and then go on in an orderly pre-arranged progress.<br />
This kind of thing seems to me to be tremendously important.<br />
But one of the things I do not envy you and I do not<br />
envy governments who are concerned in these matters, and that is<br />
that as the world goes on, faster aircraft are produced, faster<br />
aircraft are demanded. ; e are about, I believe, to enter the<br />
ultimate miseries of supersonic international aviation. I have<br />
a pet the. ry myself that my successor, because I am bound to<br />
have one you know, that my successor, in a few years' time, will<br />
be rung up and will be invited by the Primo Minister in London<br />
to " nip over and have dinner, there are one or two matters I'd<br />
like to have you talk with me about". He will then go out and<br />
be put in a sort of capsule, will be fired off up into space,<br />
dodging those copper needles on the journey, and will no doubt<br />
be brought down by some form of remote control at the other end,<br />
and go to dinner. It is a terrible prospect to me, but I do<br />
know quite practically, that every time an airline today<br />
re-equips it begins a process that is already half over.<br />
It gets the latest as it sees the latest. It knows<br />
quite well that in a couple of years' time there will be<br />
something later than the latest; it may, when it buys its new<br />
equipment or aircraft of a particular type, optimistically say<br />
" Well now, we'll amortise the cost of these over X years". At<br />
the end of half that time it is sometimes suddenly reminded that<br />
after all it's impossible to resist re-equipment with this new<br />
one because you are being driven out of business by your<br />
competitor and so the partly amo-tised cost suddenly becomes a<br />
write off. How the financial men connected with the great<br />
flying companies manage to survive and have dark hair in so many<br />
cases, I do not understand.<br />
This problem of the economics of flying is one to<br />
which I believe we all and you in particular must direct<br />
more and more attention, because I do not believe it is possible<br />
to go on just keeping up with the Jones's whatever the cost of<br />
keeping up with the Jones's may be. The last thing that you<br />
want to have happen, or that I want to have happen, is to have<br />
international flying or domestic flying, civil aviation in the<br />
broad, regarded as something that is inevitably insolvent or<br />
to put it another way, is something which inevitably cannot live<br />
except without massiv3subsidies. </p>
<p>I do not believo that needs to be true. I do not<br />
believe that it is beyond the wit of man to solve these problems,<br />
to organise the production of now types of aircraft, and to<br />
organise new programmes so that they have some relation to the<br />
effective use of the reoat assets already in oporation. I do<br />
not know Ahether there is a temptation among flying people to<br />
look down on the earth and say that is a matter for pedestrians.<br />
This, of course, is a very pedestrian problem I am reminding you<br />
of; but it is a problem that will have to be solved because the<br />
people themselves in the world who, in the long run pay, will<br />
require to be satisfied that the economics of air travel are<br />
regarded today with equal urgency and importance as the mechanics<br />
of civil aviation, or the electronics of controlling aircraft and<br />
their passage through the air.<br />
Now, Sir, I know that you have all those things in<br />
mind. I apologise for reminding you, therefore, of them. But<br />
speaking as one who sees no limit to what may be done in the air<br />
in the second half of this century, I would like to feel that it<br />
was not only going to be something dramatic, sonithing exciting,<br />
something of immeasurable use to the world, but that it was<br />
something that could, to a very large extent, live on itself,<br />
depend on itself and not be beholden too much to the politicians<br />
of the world. Now, before I conclude, I just want to tell you that I<br />
mentioned a little while ago how remoteness in my own country was<br />
being overcome by flying. Political remoteness, I may add<br />
before I close, is being overcome in just that way. In the old<br />
days my earliest predecessors, as Prime Ministers of this<br />
country, if they wanted to go to Jestern Australia, travelled<br />
by an international ship. They went comfortably, or<br />
uncomfortably, across the Great Australian Bight; they had four<br />
or five days of leisure, which, no doubt, they devoted to reading<br />
heavy matter and engaging in powerful thoughts. They then<br />
arrived at Perth, they discharged some of these powerful<br />
thoughts at a meeting, and then they got back on to the ship and<br />
came back to the Eastern States. This is a marvellous form of<br />
life. I look at it now just retrospectively. But it was<br />
impossible for them to know very much about Australia. Today,<br />
the problem is solved by flying.<br />
In the last six months I myself, just inside Australia<br />
and as normal routine, have flown just under 20,000 miles and<br />
will fly another 10 or 11 thousand before polling day if I may<br />
refer to that unhappy event.<br />
I think it is quite safe to say that in the course of<br />
the last 12 years I must have flown, inside Australia, the better<br />
part of half a million miles and all this has been done into<br />
every corner of the continent, into remote mining towns north,<br />
north west, north central, south central all over Australia, to<br />
places Icould never have gone to if it were not for flying. This<br />
I trust, though I am not the best judge of it, has made me a<br />
slightly less incompetent Prime Minister than I other ise would<br />
have been. It has broadened my kncwledge, broadened my horizons,<br />
brought into my ears and into my eyes, the problems of people<br />
whom otherwise I would never see. This, I believe, in a country<br />
like ours, is the ultimate, marvellous . ans.. er to that remoteness<br />
4hich might otherw ise overcome the Federal Capital with its<br />
limited opportunities on the part of Ministers to see the<br />
country and the people for wom they are responsible. </p>
<p>And so, Sir in spite of my initial complaints which<br />
are genuine, but not to be taken out of proportion I stand here<br />
as the debtor of civil aviation, and as your debtor, because as<br />
I see it, I reard you as some of the -reat driving men in this<br />
business in this country. If I venture to suggest that I have<br />
some uneasiness in my mind about whlere we are getting to,<br />
economically, when we consider this tremendous rapidity with<br />
which re-equip-: ent becomes necessary, it is only because I think<br />
so highly of civil aviation all around the world that wouldn't<br />
care to have it put at the mercy of other people, or put<br />
financially into a precarious condition.<br />
I relcome you and I declare this Conference open. </p>
