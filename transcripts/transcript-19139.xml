<p>International Women's Day had today been marked with a pledge to continue Australia's efforts to eliminate and prevent violence against women and girls.</p>
<p>The United Nations theme for International Women's Day this year is a promise: time for action to end violence against women.</p>
<p>The first International Women's Day rallies were held in March 1911, a time when support for the right for women to work, vote and hold public office was building momentum.</p>
<p>We have a come long way since that time and made significant gains in achieving greater gender equality and enabling women's social, political and economic empowerment.</p>
<p>But tragically, far too many women around the world are still victims of violence by their governments and armies and by those who should love and protect them - by partners and family members.</p>
<p>And we know that there are other areas where action is still required to address inequality. The gender pay gap is still too wide and the number of women in senior roles is still too few.</p>
<p>Hundreds of events take place around the world for International Women's Day and it truly is a day when countries can unite and work together to end and prevent all forms of violence, whether physical, sexual or psychological.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister spoke about the challenges facing women and girls at an IWD Breakfast in Sydney.</p>
<p>In Washington, Ms Collins participated in a panel examining domestic and international initiatives aimed at improving gender equality and to attend the International Women of Courage Ceremony.</p>
<p>Ms Collins has been in New York to lead the Australia delegation at the 57th session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, the world's main policy-making body, at which countries agree to a set of concrete recommendations to be implemented to improve gender equality.</p>
<p>The theme at the Commission this year is the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls.</p>
<p>Domestically and internationally â including through our aid program and advocacy â Australia is promoting a world where women and girls can thrive and where their safety is guaranteed.</p>
