RGY . jAUSTRALZA<br />
FOR MEDIA 27 SEPTEMBER 1988<br />
Her Majesty Queen Beatrix and His Royal Highness Prince Claus of<br />
the Netherlands will make an official Visit to Australia from<br />
Monday October 24 to Saturday November<br />
It will be the first time a reigning Dutch monarch will have<br />
visited Australia.<br />
The visit will take the Royal Couple to the Australian Capital<br />
Territory, Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria and New South<br />
wales. It is fitting that Her Majesty and His Royal Highness visit<br />
Australia to honour our Bicentenary, as Dutch navigators played<br />
such an important part in the discovery by Europeans of this<br />
continent. indeed the Dutch were the first recorded Europeans to sight and<br />
to set foot on Australia, and the mapping of much of the western<br />
part of our coastline was carried out by them.<br />
In the ACT, the Queen and Prince Claus will be given a ceremonial<br />
welcome at RAAF Base Fairbairn on 24 October. Later that day,<br />
they will be the guests of Their Excellencies the<br />
Governor-General and Lady Stephen at a State Dinner. Other<br />
highlights of their visit to Canberra will include a lunch hosted<br />
by myself and Mrs Hawke at Parliament House on 25 October, and<br />
visits to the Australian War memorial, Mt Stromlo Observatory,<br />
the Regatta Point Exhibition and the Canberra School of Art, as<br />
well as a reception for members of the local Dutch community.<br />
other important events in the visit will be the unveiling of a<br />
monument to the Dutch navigator, Abel Tasman, in Hobart, and<br />
attendance at the Melbourne Cup.<br />
Further details of the visit elsewhere in Australia will be<br />
announced separately by the Premiers of Tasmania, South<br />
Australia, Victoria and New South Wales.<br />
I know many thousands of Australians of Dutch descent and<br />
indeed all Australians will give. Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus<br />
a warm and enthusiastic welcome. 27 </p>
