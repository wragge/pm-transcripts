FOR PRESS: PM No. 52/ 197 1<br />
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINJA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon--<br />
T he A us t rali an G overnment has noted the rapid<br />
succession of events which suggest a marked development in the willingness<br />
of the People's Republic of China to deal with the rest of the world.<br />
We have already stated that it is our long term objective to<br />
normalise our bilateral relations with the Government of the People's<br />
Republic of China and we have further decided that we will now explore<br />
the possibilities of establishing a dialogue with the Government of the<br />
People's Republic. We must bear in mind that a major obstacle to the<br />
development of formal relations with the People's Republic of China<br />
has been that Government's support for insurgency and subversion in<br />
countries of the region with which we as an Australian Government<br />
have close relations and mutual strategic interests.<br />
For those reasons we will proceed with caution and we<br />
will want to ensure that when any steps are taken there will be some<br />
response of a reasonable kind from Peking.<br />
Whatever we do will be without prejudice to the rights of<br />
the Republic of China on Taiwan.<br />
Subject to security requirements there are, of course,<br />
no restrictions on the rights of Australians to visit the People's<br />
Republic of China.<br />
