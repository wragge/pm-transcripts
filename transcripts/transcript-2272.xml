FOR PRESS: P. M. No 62/ 1970<br />
NATIONAL MARITIME MUSEUM<br />
Statement, by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Government will preserve the Sydney Customs House as<br />
a National Maritime Museum.<br />
The Premier of New South Wales, who, along with many<br />
other interested persons and organisations, has supported this<br />
course of action, has been informed.<br />
I am sure that this decision in principle will be welcomed,<br />
but the Customs House will be required for its present purpose<br />
for many years and it is not possible to cay when it will be<br />
vacated by the Department of Customs and Excise.<br />
The Customs House was built in 1887 and was the work<br />
of the colonial architect, James Barnet, who was responsible<br />
for a number of important buildings in Sydney.<br />
