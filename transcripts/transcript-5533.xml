ELECTORATE TALK<br />
It is Commonwealth Day tomorrow, so it is opportune to remind<br />
all Australians of the relevance of the Commonwealth, because<br />
the Commonwealth does mean much to Australia. It is<br />
particularly significant in 1981 because the Statute of<br />
Westminster, the British Parliamentary Act which led to the<br />
I Commonwealth is 50 years old, and the CommonwealthHeads of<br />
Government Meeting will be held in Australia for the first time.<br />
There is more to the Commonwealth than it being a symbol of<br />
Australia's traditional links with Britain. The Commonwealth<br />
of today has its own identity. ' It has a record of accomplishmients<br />
of which Australians can be proud, and it continues to work<br />
towards solving international problems.<br />
The Corncnwealth is unique from other international organisatiLons<br />
based on geographic, economic or ideological considerations.<br />
Instead, the bond between all-the countries which make up the<br />
Commonwealth is their historical connectioi with Britain.<br />
It is a voluntary association operating only on the basis of<br />
consensus.<br />
The Commonwealth is relevant in that it provides Australia with<br />
access to the views of 43 countries on a wide variety of topizs<br />
of world i mportance. Australia's membership of the Commonwealth<br />
t ' enables us to influence those views.<br />
There are no obligations involved in membership, no-treaties nor<br />
written commitments, only a dedication to the ideals of<br />
the Commonwealth.<br />
One of the Commonwealth's major strengths is its practice of<br />
holdiipg its discussions confidentially, and reaching decisions<br />
without voting. This enables the members to talk fully, and<br />
frankly but simultaneously making a special effort to reconcile<br />
the different points of view in trying to solve both global<br />
and regional problems.<br />
Then there ' are those critics without any alternative, constructive<br />
ideas, who decry the achievements of Australia's involvement<br />
in the Commonwealth. ./ 2 </p>

The Leader of the Labor Opposition, Mr. Hayden, views the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting as " an anachronistic<br />
institution, a talk-shop of dubious-' value to Australia". This,<br />
is his description of an occasion which brings together some<br />
44 Heads of Government, over 90% of whom-represent Third-World<br />
countries.<br />
Those attending will include people-of the calibre of<br />
. Indira Gandhi, Pierre Trudeau, Julius Nyrere, Margaret Thatcher<br />
and Lee Kuan Yew all of whom according to the Leader of-the<br />
opposition are prepared to travel long distances and to wastetheir<br />
time on a useless gathering.<br />
What can one say about such a view? Wel'., first one-., can<br />
say that it is utterly old-fashioned. It is the sort of thing<br />
that used to be said 20 or 30 years ago, before the Commonwealth---.<br />
had been transformed into a multi-racial association of independent<br />
states drawn from all continents. Since then it has become<br />
an important and very contemporary instrument for dealing with<br />
North/ South economic issues, African and Asian issues, as well<br />
other matters of concern to its members.<br />
I have no doubt that anyone meeting Mr. Ramphal, the Commonwealth<br />
Secretary-General, who is known and respected in the diplomatic<br />
centre of the world, and Mr. Hayden would have any difficulty<br />
in determining who was really the anachronism in today's world.<br />
Indeed, after saying what he did, Mr. Hayden had to immediately<br />
contradict himself and acknowledge that this so-called talk-shc'p<br />
had achieved notable success ( his words) at its very last meetinc<br />
in Lusaka, where the settlement on Zimbabwe was negotiated.<br />
He did not explain how an anachronism was able to achieve this.<br />
The only conclusion that one can draw from the Leader of the<br />
Opposition's foolish and insulting remarks about the Commonwealth<br />
is that he does not anticipate ever being in the position of<br />
representing Australia at one of its meetings. For how, after<br />
what he has said, could he ever justify his attendance?<br />
N<br />
The agreement on an effective declaration against apartheid is<br />
just one example where member nations of the Commonwealth have<br />
overcome their differences despite their varied political groupings<br />
at other forums such as the United Nations.<br />
Australia has a very special responsibility in re lation to the..<br />
South Pacific, particularly since Vanuatu is the newest member<br />
of the Commonwealth.. The obvious connection between South Pacific<br />
countries and us is through the Commonwealth.<br />
Many Australians relate to the Commonwealth at another level.<br />
There are 300 non-government organisations through which Australians<br />
meet, learn and share experiences with overseas colleagues working<br />
in technical and professional fields. Australia hosted the<br />
Commonwealth Broadcasting Conference last year, and we will host the<br />
Commonwealth Press Conference this year. Appellate judges from<br />
various Commonwealth countries also met in Sydney in 1980. / 3 </p>

A. job 000---<br />
The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting to be held in<br />
Melbourne ' in September/ October will be the most important<br />
international event ever held in Australia. This will further,<br />
Commonwealth co-operation. Its flexibility and consequent<br />
worthwhile results have already been demonstrated, Australia<br />
having played a major role at the two previous Heads'of Government<br />
Meetings I have attended.<br />
Australia was deeply involved in the Commonwealth negotiations<br />
to bring about an end to the conflicts in Rhodesia and the<br />
subsequent formation of Zimbabwe. There has been progress on. a<br />
common fund for commodities with a significant input from Australia.<br />
At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Lusaka,*' Australia<br />
was responsible for beginnifig a report on the constraints to<br />
world economic growth. Another study intitiated by Austra&amp; lia.<br />
in 1979 has laid down guidelines for international co-operation<br />
in the field of media and cormunications,. an area much politicised<br />
in other international organisations.<br />
Not only will the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting'in<br />
Melbourne later this year the most important international<br />
event ever held in Australia, but it will also be one of the,<br />
most important international events ofl98l. It will follow th~ e<br />
OttSauwm it o Wesern developed countries and the proposed<br />
Brandt Summit in Mexico City. Both of these meetings will discuss<br />
international economic issues, the North-South dialogue. Both<br />
will be hoping to point the way towards a stable and equitable<br />
economic svstem.<br />
It is hoped this will result in a round of-global negotiations<br />
at the United Nations.<br />
The Melbourne Commonwealth Heads cf Government Meeting will be<br />
the largest meeting of Heads of Government of developed and<br />
developing c6untries in 1981. It will also be able to capitalise on<br />
whatever agreements are reached at Ottawa and Mexico City.<br />
That is why the Melbourne Commonwealth meeting has a special<br />
significance. It is not the question of Australia trying to grandstand on the<br />
world stage, but'a serious attempt to bring about practical and<br />
constructive solutions to problems which should concern us all.<br />
Co-operation at such breadth and depth must prove to be useful,<br />
in resolving many world issues. Such a high level involvement<br />
ensures the future development of the Commonwealth, and Australia's<br />
continued recognition of its value. </p>
