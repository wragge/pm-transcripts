PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE GRADUATE SCHOOL, INAUGURAL DEAN'S<br />
LECTURE, 5 AUGUST 1994<br />
1 am very pleased to have been asked to give this, the first of the Dean's<br />
lectures, at the new University of Melbourne Graduate School.<br />
This new school is a very good idea. It is bound to raise both the quality and the<br />
quantity of research at a great University.<br />
Because it is multi-disciplinary, it should be the scene of creative dialogues: who<br />
knows what social and scientific benefits might flow when research into art or<br />
history or literature crosses currents with engineers, mathematicians and<br />
architects? The new school will create a much more pronounced research focus at the<br />
University of Melbourne. It will of course make life easier and more rewarding<br />
for the University's 7,500 post-graduate students. It will boost the general profile<br />
of what is already a renowned institution both at home and abroad.<br />
I would not like to be seen encouraging vulgar competition, but I should imagine<br />
it will help Melbourne claw back some ground from Monash.<br />
The School is an idea for the times we are in our future depends so much<br />
upon knowledge and the use we make of it; our ability to secure a rewarding<br />
place in the world depends upon it; our standard of living and quality of life<br />
depends upon it; the sort of material, intellectual and aesthetic environment we<br />
leave to our children depends upon it.<br />
In fact this new Graduate School is so obviously a good idea we might wonder<br />
why it took so long.<br />
Not that I would pass judgement. When you have been in politics for as long as<br />
I have you are no stranger to the phenomenon of good ideas passing by<br />
ungrasped. Politics is a contest of ideas and for ideas. It is a contest between the ideas of<br />
the rival parties between the greatest of all Australian political ideas, the Labor<br />
Movement, and its opponents. And there is no greater contest of ideas than the<br />
one which occurs within the Labor Movement itself. </p>
<p>But politics is more than a contest of views. It is at times a contest between<br />
those with ideas and those without them.<br />
And in turn between those with the wit and persistence necessary to see ideas<br />
made into reality, and those who are content to merely spout them and argue<br />
about them. It is a contest between the pragmatists and posturers; the doers<br />
and the talkers.<br />
It is between those who want to go to the heart of things and those who forever<br />
tinker at the margins.<br />
Ultimately it is between those who are excited by the challenge of change and<br />
those who recoil from it.<br />
We should never underestimate the do-nothings and the think-nothings. They<br />
are a formidable foe. For substantial periods of our history they have held<br />
sway. Against obscurantists victory is never assured.<br />
For myself, I find it difficult to comprehend any purpose for a political life other<br />
than reform. I remain genuinely puzzled by those familiar parliamentary figures<br />
who seem dedicated to no better cause than improving their smiles or perfecting<br />
their rendition of the two-fingered sloth.<br />
It pains me a little to say it, but I have been in Federal politics for a quarter of a<br />
century. That is half my life and it doesn't take a mathematician to tell me that<br />
the longer I stay the worse the ratio will get.<br />
But a mathematician will not be able to explain why it is that the longer I stay the<br />
greater grows my conviction why the experience of 25 years in the Federal<br />
Parliament has turned a belief in reform into a thirst for it.<br />
For instance, after twenty five years, I ask myself if I could not be forgiven<br />
sidestepping the Hilmer Report on competition policy. Those States can be so<br />
perverse. It would be so much easier to roll over to them.<br />
How many Australians would notice if we did not insist that the State authorities<br />
accept the same competitive disciplines as those borne by Australian business<br />
and Australian unions.<br />
The Commonwealth will get no credit for success, and all the blame for failure.<br />
In political terms the States have nothing to lose either way.<br />
So why take it on? For the same reason that we take APEC on. Or vocational<br />
education and training. Or Mabo. Or Regional Development. Or the Republic.<br />
Because the times demand it, the next century demands it and you can't do<br />
justice to one without the others.<br />
.-nI any -event,-4udge-the-job-n ow-and posterity will catch up with you. After twenty<br />
five years in the Federal Parliament I cannot think of a single item of reforming<br />
legislation not even the most flawed which has damaged the fabric and the<br />
future of Australia in a dimension comparable to that caused by inaction or<br />
regression. </p>
<p>And what is true of this last quarter century is even more true of the one before it<br />
it was not what they did, it was what they failed to do.<br />
In a perverse way I thank them for it whenever I feel a bit run down I think of all<br />
those years through the fifties, sixties and seventies when good ideas passed<br />
Australia by. When the world passed us by. And it stirs me into action again.<br />
In a healthy democracy you can defend to the death the right of governments to<br />
do things you disagree with. But you can never defend their inaction they have<br />
no right to slough off that responsibility.<br />
You cannot defend a government which continually fails to see what's coming or<br />
what's begging to be done.<br />
If I have one hope for posterity it is that the Government in which I have played a<br />
part since 1983 will be judged to have recognised and confronted the huge<br />
challenges Australia has faced, and continues to face, in the last decades of the<br />
century.<br />
The politics of reform is a gruelling business and I confess to wondering<br />
sometimes why we do it.<br />
I also confess, entirely without apology, that power has a fair bit to do with it. I<br />
never met a good politician who didn't like using it wrestling with it.<br />
On the other hand I have met a lot of bad ones who shrank from it. And never<br />
trust the ones who say they are not politicians would you trust a dentist who<br />
told you he was really a boilermaker?<br />
The best politicians make no bones about it. The best politicians want power<br />
because they know that, for all its imperfections, as a vehicle for turning ideas<br />
into reality a political career has no equal.<br />
How you could get hold of power and just sit on it is beyond me.<br />
In the end it is probably a matter of instinct. I mean in the end good politicians<br />
and good governments are obliged to obey the human instinct to provide<br />
security for succeeding generations.<br />
In a very real sense politics boils down to a contest between ideas about how<br />
that is best done.<br />
In an ideal world, this would be too obvious a point to make. In the real world<br />
the truth of it is pretty thoroughly obscured.<br />
In the real world, all sorts of media and other imperatives combine with a<br />
perfectly natural scepticism to create a climate in which the political system is<br />
generally deemed at best a deeply qualified success, and politicians sometimes<br />
strugU3Acz-rnatajn the! r-status as -normalVmembers of the species.<br />
It is not a particularly bad thing it manifestly can't be. For the truth is that even<br />
through the mists of cynicism you can see the contrary indications: by and large,<br />
our political system serves us very well; by and large, our traditions serve us<br />
well; by and large, as a nation and a people we have succeeded. </p>
<p>And, in my view, we have never succeeded so well as we are succeeding now.<br />
It is true we have the best conjunction of economic circumstances in memory.<br />
It is true that we are now a competitive and outwardly-oriented economy.<br />
It is true that we think differently about the world and our place in it.<br />
It is also true that we have sophisticated and effective social policies and<br />
programs with few equals in the world.<br />
These are all measures of success. But there seems to me an even more<br />
profound measure I mean the cultural shift, the shift in attitudes.<br />
We are proving that as a nation we can live with change. We can adapt. We<br />
can initiate change.<br />
Who would have thought a decade ago that we would number universities<br />
among our leading export earners?<br />
Just as I am painfully aware of how rapidly my twenty five years in Parliament<br />
have passed, I am conscious that many of you those of you who are still in your<br />
twenties will have no memory of the things which used to plague Australia.<br />
I mean things like one of the world's worst strike rates. Notoriously inefficient<br />
work practices in key industries. Inflation dragging us down. Financial<br />
regulations gumming up the works. A weak and uncompetitive manufacturing<br />
sector. You need only go back another decade to find the White Australia Policy still in<br />
existence. The great task of the eighties was to make Australia an international player in its<br />
own right. To make it competitive, outward-looking, phobia free.<br />
It is very useful to be reminded that within half a generation such things fade<br />
from the public memory.<br />
It comes as a bit of shock, for instance, to think that the great majority of this<br />
year's first year university students were not born when John Kerr dismissed the<br />
Whitlam Government.<br />
It is a reminder of how quickly generations pass, and of why one generation<br />
cannot waste time in getting the ground prepared for the one to follow.<br />
And why governments must not sit on their hands. Why governments must<br />
provide for this generation and the next. Why they must, therefore, be prepared<br />
to embrace change and encourage the people to embrace it.<br />
The pace of change quickened in the eighties. It is moving even faster now.<br />
But we can keep up. A decade ago we couldn't. </p>
<p>A decade ago you wouldn't see, up the back of The Economist where they keep<br />
the economic indicators, Australia leading the world not just in growth at<br />
present, but in the international forecasts for growth and for inflation.<br />
In December 1983, Australia's growth was the lowest in the industrial world.<br />
Australia's inflation was among the highest. Today it is among the lowest.<br />
Quite unthinkable a decade ago. And no less unthinkable was a manufacturing<br />
sector with exports to rival those in agriculture and mining let me tell those of<br />
you who were not present at the time, in the 1970s the orthodoxy was that<br />
Australia could never succeed as an exporter of manufactures.<br />
We could never be sufficiently competitive, it was said, at least not without<br />
adopting the wage rates of the developing world.<br />
No one then imagined that a decade later Australia's fastest growing exports<br />
would be elaborately transformed manufactures. Or that overall exports would<br />
represent 20 per cent of GDP.<br />
Or that, whereas in the early eighties about 3% of our GDP was invested<br />
abroad, today it is 20%. Or universities and colleges would become principal<br />
players and principal earners in the new export culture, the new era of<br />
internationally traded services.<br />
I could go on for a long time about these remarkable changes, including those in<br />
education and training. I could point out that whereas 4 in 10 young Australians<br />
completed secondary school in the early eighties, 8 in 10 do now. And I could<br />
point out that we are about to expand vocational education on the same scale.<br />
But the most important lesson to be drawn from these changes is not their<br />
individual dimensions but the general revolution they imply. It is not just what<br />
they have won for us so far it is what they assure us of winning in the future.<br />
For they have meant that we are competitive. They have meant that we are<br />
players. That we now have a presence where we didn't before. That, as markets<br />
became global, we have adjusted quickly enough and dramatically enough to get<br />
into them.<br />
As Asia became the most dynamic economic region in the world we have<br />
directed our national focus there, and our companies have moved to take<br />
advantage of the extraordinary opportunities. It is no accident that as I visited<br />
Jakarta to talk to President Soeharto about the forthcoming meeting of APEC<br />
leaders in Indonesia, a huge Australian trade exhibition was being held there.<br />
The fact is that we are on the threshold of an unprecedented era of opportunity,<br />
one in which by our own efforts and according to our own lights we can deliver<br />
the great promise of Australia. We are in with a huge chance.<br />
We. have . only. got-to.-this-stageby overcoming our inertia. In an article in the<br />
Australian on June 1 this year, Xavier Pons wrote the following: </p>
<p>Is there a common point between, say, Mabo, the Industrial Relations<br />
Reform Act, multiculturalism, the push for an Australian republic and the<br />
upgrading of Australia's military cooperation with Indonesia? Could there<br />
be some logic to it all?<br />
Beyond the diversity and specificity of these recent developments, one<br />
can detect the premises of an unprecedented cultural shift as Australia,<br />
somewhat reluctantly, leaves behind the comforts of illusion and braces<br />
itself to face reality on its own terms.<br />
Xavier Pons is right. There has been a cultural shift. There is a common point<br />
between those legislative landmarks. There is a thread of logic binding them.<br />
And it is most definitely about facing reality.<br />
And I would say there is another thread: one which links the Government's<br />
willingness to legislate on these big issues with the willingness of Australians to<br />
make changes of comparable dimensions in their own lives in their workplaces,<br />
in their schools, in the way they go about their enterprises, in accommodating<br />
multiculturalism, in recognising the new realities.<br />
If I might regress for a moment to the matter of the contest between inertia and<br />
reform: we got this cultural shift by exposing ourselves to necessity. That is the<br />
essence of it.<br />
There remain a few people on both sides of politics who disagree, but the fact is<br />
undeniable only by establishing an environment of necessity did we get these<br />
changes. Nothing else would do.<br />
The recognition of necessity has driven change in the past decade and it will<br />
drive it in this one. There is no greater weapon against the tendency to inertia.<br />
No better way to expose and defeat those without ideas and policies or the will<br />
to realise them.<br />
In doing so, it has been essential to maintain the social equation. In fact we are<br />
in the vanguard of progressive social policy.<br />
Compare our health system with other countries; our welfare system; our<br />
legislation protecting womerrand programs to expand their opportunities; our<br />
system of family payments; our recently introduced " jobs compact" and other<br />
measures to assist the long term unemployed announced in the White Paper<br />
compare our social legislation with the advanced countries of the world and you<br />
will see that we have recognised change will not work, and is not worth<br />
attempting, if the social and cultural fabric of the nation cannot be kept intact.<br />
And we have kept it intact. Most importantly we have to make sure the<br />
measures announced in the White Paper are effectively delivered, and the longterm<br />
unemployed are brought back in touch with the labour market.<br />
There. is-a. great-deal more we can do to-make our social system deliver more<br />
opportunity and more security. And there is a great deal we are doing reforms<br />
like the Home Child Care Allowance I launched yesterday. </p>
<p>7<br />
The important thing is to keep the equation in balance we must maintain the<br />
social safety net and extend equality and opportunity through progressive social<br />
legislation, but the same purposes are also served by measures to make the<br />
economy more dynamic and competitive.<br />
Without them, there would be infinitely less opportunity, infinitely less chance for<br />
the next generation of Australians.<br />
Deregulation taught us not just what was needed, but what we were capable of.<br />
It brought out the creativity in us. Non-restrictive immigration policies and<br />
multiculturalism brought out the tolerance, and the capacity to build a much<br />
richer society.<br />
The new openness of the 1980s exposed us to the world and in so doing, as<br />
never before, exposed us to ourselves. We see ourselves more clearly now, I<br />
think. We have a better understanding of our capabilities.<br />
I think we need to bring the same principles and the confidence we have<br />
developed from exercising them to every significant realm of our national life.<br />
I believe Australians have every right to see their era as one of unparalleled<br />
achievement. Our history is often said to be built on a succession of noble<br />
failures, and our national character is said to reflect this.<br />
Romantic and agreeable as this interpretation is, I think we can now aim to<br />
launch Australia into the next century on a tradition of success.<br />
As a politician I believe in stirring Australia's economic and social broth. I think<br />
we should engage the whole of it. I think it puts more strength in the brew, and<br />
brings out our best, most generous and creative qualities.<br />
I have always thought that there are more of these in the Australian community<br />
than the polls and the media would generally have us believe.<br />
I profoundly believe in Australians belief in themselves their seriousness of<br />
purpose, their capacity to rationalise their way through problems.<br />
That is why I was confident we could pursue the just cause of Mabo and win<br />
and why I remain confident that the legislation we introduced will survive every<br />
petty and mean attempt to undo it.<br />
The Native Title Act will deliver to the Australians of the twenty first century what<br />
we have not enjoyed the foundations of justice in the relationship between<br />
indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. It will be a foundation for greater<br />
confidence and national self-esteem.<br />
The same of course can be said for the Republic.<br />
There. arerany. number. of. reasons why. Australia should become a Republic. The<br />
simplest one and I think a perfectly sufficient one is that an independent<br />
nation with an independent destiny, and with traditions and a way of life which<br />
are uniquely its own, ought not to have a foreign Head of State. </p>
<p>8<br />
And those who believe this is not the case should tell us why. I have not yet<br />
heard so much as a shred of a good reason other than the weak refrain that the<br />
Queen is irrelevant.<br />
I hear them say " if it ain't broke don't fix it". This of course is a doctrine of<br />
inertia. It is an argument for the perfectly preserved horse and cart.<br />
Or I hear them say there are more important issues. This is true, just as there<br />
were more important issues a century ago when the Federation was designed<br />
and passed by the people.<br />
Or I hear them say as John Hewson said the other day having an Australian<br />
as Australia's Head of State is not important. Yet as recently as the 1950' s<br />
having the Queen of England as our Head of State was considered to be terribly<br />
important " the crown as an abstract notion" united us, Bob Menzies said.<br />
And it is true in the 1950' s that British monarchy constituted a significant element<br />
of Australia's national sentiment and national cohesion. Our Head of State then<br />
commanded great respect, affection and loyalty.<br />
But there is no denying that the British monarchy no longer commands that<br />
respect, affection and loyalty. It is equally true that our interests have grown<br />
increasingly away from those of Great Britain, and that the proportion of our<br />
population who have come from non-English speaking backgrounds has<br />
dramatically increased.<br />
And it is just as true that these trends will continue.<br />
So what do we say to the next generation of Australians? What do we say to the<br />
Australians of the 21 st century?<br />
That, even though the British monarchy has little or no relevance to your lives,<br />
values and aspirations, we will leave it with you?<br />
Or will we say we had the wit and the will to bequeath to you a Head of State<br />
who stands for the things we believe in? Who stands unambiguously for<br />
Australia? An appropriate Head of State, in other words.<br />
So I say it is important that Australia's Head of State be an Australian. I say that<br />
it will be an appropriate mark of our achievements as a nation not least of our<br />
achievements in recent years.<br />
As you will have gathered today, if you have not gathered before, I hold an<br />
emphatic belief that politicians and governments should lead. That is what they<br />
are elected to do and paid to do.<br />
And recent experience leaves me in no doubt that when a lead is given<br />
Australians will respond businesses, unions, communities, institutions like this<br />
one. will -respond..<br />
But governments work within a system which has been determined by the people<br />
and which cannot be changed in any fundamental way without their approval.<br />
The Government has invited the people to change the system and the people<br />
are now responding. </p>
