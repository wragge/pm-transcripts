PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 19 JUNE 1978 -cl7<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN FLOWER<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, you've just returned from knocking<br />
at1WtEC's door and yet today Mr. Froggart ,, the Chairman<br />
to of Shell, who was appointed/ the AIDC only last week, says you<br />
should be looking for markets elsewhere. What's your<br />
comment on that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I think we should be looking for our<br />
markets everywhere and we are. If you look at the way in which<br />
our markets have expanded in Asia with countries like Korea<br />
and obviously Japan you will know quite well there has<br />
been an enormous expansion of trade with the emerging developing<br />
countries in Asia and the Western Pacific and that goes ahead<br />
but you know its saying something of great consequence to<br />
many Australian industries if we are to say " alright, the<br />
European community, well over 200 million of the world's<br />
wealthiest, most technologically advanced people have markets<br />
that are to be closed to important Australian products". It's<br />
in Europe that we're up against non-tariff barriers that<br />
exclude us from their markets. We are not up against such<br />
barriers in Asia and other countries where our trade has been<br />
expanding in a very satisfactory manner and its obvious<br />
therefore, that since in a sense Europe has been the trouble<br />
spot that Europe should attract a great deal of attention and<br />
its all the more disturbing because many countries in Europe<br />
are now behind particular proposals which are designed to<br />
break down the most-favoured nation principle in trade and<br />
if that happens middle-ranking countries, smaller countries,<br />
developing countries would have a great deal to fear from<br />
the major power blocs.<br />
QUESTION: Do you see your trip as being worthwhile in what<br />
tangible evidence do you bring back to say to the Australian<br />
people " this what I've done for Australia, this is what I've<br />
brought back for Australia"?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Australia's view is well known, it's now<br />
understood inrelation to the wider trade matters and of<br />
course Mr. Garland has been continuing to press the<br />
particular European matters. There are two strands in what's<br />
been happening; entry to Europe on a bilateral basis through<br />
the European community and the broader based international<br />
trade negotiations being undertaken at Geneva. It's been<br />
terribly important that Australia stress her point of view,<br />
have it known and understood and also have it known that we<br />
are going to be pressing it as hard as we possibly can with<br />
great determination. Europe knows that, other countries<br />
know that it was essential that Australia put herself in<br />
this position.<br />
QUESTION: Did the Common Market ( inaudible), Mr. Jenkins,<br />
the Presid-ent, like what he heard when you put your views to him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wasn't negotiating with Mr. Jenkins and<br />
deliberately not, because that had been done with Mr. Gunn </p>
<p>INTERVIEW WITH JOHN FLOWER. JUNE 19,1978<br />
2-<br />
and at the same time the Commission had said that Australia's<br />
bilateral problems should be resolved, dealt with, in the<br />
wider forum, in the multilatereral forum in Geneva and for<br />
the moment we are taking the Commission at their word but<br />
we are going to test the validity of the Commission's view<br />
that entry for beef and other Australian products can be<br />
achieved through sensible and more broadly based arrangements<br />
arrived at in Geneva. I told Mr. Jenkins this was the real<br />
reason why I wanted to see him; that it would: be a grave<br />
mistake to underestimate the strength and the determination<br />
behind the strength of Australia's view.<br />
QUESTION: Where will you be putting Australia's situation<br />
next, t eneva--or the MTN?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It will be put at MTN and Geneva and we will<br />
be arguing very very strongly for agriculture to be included,<br />
as we must and we have been assured that the United States<br />
will walk away from the negotiations if agriculture is not<br />
included. So, at least the United States and Australia are<br />
both arguing for agriculture to be included in the final<br />
results of the MTN. Now, if that occurs, that will be a major<br />
victory for Australia because on previous negotiations, ever<br />
since the war, agriculture has been pushed aside in a sense,<br />
into the " too-hard" basket, leaving it open to countries to<br />
use whatever restrictive unreasonable rules they like in relation<br />
to agriculture. 000---</p>
