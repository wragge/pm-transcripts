    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government has announced $538.8 million to help Australian health and medical researchers find the cures, treatments and medical devices of the future.</p>
<p>The funding will support 773 National Health and Medical Research Council grants, which will help ensure Australia remains a world leader in medical research.</p>
<p>It has been estimated that every $1 spent in this field generates more than $2 in health benefits alone.</p>
<p>That is one of the reasons the Government committed to foster more Australian breakthroughs through the Medical Research Future Fund.</p>
<p>There are economic benefits from research, from a reduced burden on our health system, and in the form of earnings from our biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and medical technology industries.</p>
<p>Australian researchers have been world leaders in medical discoveries, such as the cervical cancer vaccine, the bionic ear, and the world's first anti-influenza drug.</p>
<p>Our health and medical research sector is worth around $6 billion a year, and is the key driver of productivity and innovation in the healthcare sector, which employs more than a million Australians.</p>
<p>Over the past 20 years, this sector has grown by an average of 12 per cent a year. It is now Australia's largest manufacturing export sector, generating $4 billion a year in export income.</p>
<p>It has strong potential for continued expansion â creating more local jobs in manufacturing, and increasing our export earnings.</p>
<p>This round of NHMRC funding provides $47.3 million towards 19 Centres for Research Excellence and $7.3 million for eight NHMRC Partnerships for Better Health projects.</p>
<p>Nearly $420 million will fund 553 Project Grants, which include research in areas from auto-immune diseases and dementia to antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>Early Career Fellowships worth $39.4 million will support 125 promising researchers at the start of their careers, while 58 early to mid-career researchers will benefit from Career Development Fellowships totalling $24 million.</p>
<p>Ten researchers will also share in $1.7 million directed to Translating Research Into Practice Fellowships.</p>
