PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR JOHN GORTON AT SHERATON MOTOR HOTEL;<br />
MELBOURNE. 24 OCTOBER 1969<br />
PM: P'am always happy when Gallup Polls are runiiing for rather<br />
than against. I can only repeat what I said previously that the real<br />
poll we are interested in is the poll on Saturday the<br />
Q. Would you care to forecast the election outcome, Mr Gorton?<br />
' PM: I wouldn't like to forecast by how many seats we will win it,<br />
but I don't think there is any doubt but that we will win it. The only<br />
reason I wouldn't like to forecast by how maany seats is because I<br />
leave that to the political experts and pundits. I wouldn't like to be as<br />
wrong as I think some of them might be.<br />
Q. You don't feel you might have been better having more<br />
public meetings. than you -have held in this campaign?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so, or if so, perhaps one or at the most<br />
two more-. I have had public meetings in Perth and Adelaide and<br />
Hobart if you count the sort of thing to which the press came in<br />
Evans; it was not really a public mee ting, but I think those sort of<br />
things do in Melbourne and Sydney and Brisbane and Townsville<br />
and Rockhampton. I might have had one more if I had replanned because<br />
it was planned to have the majority of them towards the end of the<br />
campaign.<br />
Q. Would you -have had them in a capital, Sir?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think we would need to have another meeting<br />
in a capital city/ After all, we had a fairly good one at Moonee Ponds<br />
and a good one in Sydney the night before. I don't want to go around to<br />
the suburbs and have a couple of hundred listless people like Whitlam<br />
does.<br />
Q. There have been a lot of people ringing up in Melbourne<br />
and saying what a scurrilous campaign it is. Do you think it has<br />
been rougher.... ./ 2 </p>
<p>K'"<br />
2.<br />
PM: i think there has been for a long time a sort of fairly<br />
organised smear campaign going<br />
Q. Aimed at you personally or other candidates?<br />
PM: No, think mainly at me. t don't know about the other<br />
candidates.<br />
Q. Would ; you like to say who might be behind it?<br />
PM: No.<br />
Q. Do you think it has b een effective?<br />
PM: t would hope not. I don't think there is room for this sort<br />
of thing in Australia.<br />
Q. How do you stop it, then?<br />
PM: I don't think there is any way to stop it except to believe<br />
that Australian people are not affected by it.<br />
Q. Does it distress you?<br />
PM: I think it is rather revolting that that sort of thing should<br />
happen. IL reminds you of little white frog-bellied things scurrying<br />
around in a sewer. But I don't think it has got a proper place and<br />
t wouldn~ t say that it unduly distressed m . e personally.<br />
Q. What are the symptoms of such a campaign?<br />
PM: I don't know what you mean by symptoms.<br />
Q. Where do you see it reflected?<br />
PM: Oh, in the sort of literature that is put out, photographs<br />
put ouit and that sort of thing.<br />
Q. This is separate, you feel, to any allegations that St. john made?<br />
Or do you think it is part of the same thing.<br />
PM: PM: t hink it is all part of the same picture. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Q. Do you think St. John himself.<br />
PM: I wouldn't want to comment on Mr St John.<br />
Q. You me n t ioned earlier in the week, it was in the<br />
Sun-Pic. I think last Saturday that there were two people<br />
running a campaign against you. It left us with a guessing gameand<br />
you mentioned in Brisbane that they weren't politicians.<br />
Are these people in public life and are these the sort of people<br />
you think are running this campaign against you or ' Eese just<br />
individuals who are oppos ed to you or they journalists<br />
PM: Oh, I think we can leave this as a guessing game.<br />
Your guess would be as good as mine. I am fairly sure it would be.<br />
Q. Have you learnt any lessons from this campaign is<br />
there anything you would have done differently....?<br />
PM: No. I don't think I would have given the Policy Speech<br />
in any different way because a Policy Speech as such ought to be<br />
one that can be put before people in a composed and coherent way<br />
without being broken up. There are meetings I like better than<br />
doing that sort of thing, but I still think it is probably the best<br />
way to do it if a Policy Speech is to. be regarded as putting programmes<br />
before the people for the next three years. We can't have the<br />
staged faithful at a public meeting the way our principal opponent<br />
can. So I think we will continue to do it that way.<br />
Q. Why not Sir?<br />
PM': Well in the first place, we don't go along and attempt<br />
to bust up<br />
Q. We are talking about having it on stage. Why couldn't<br />
this be done in the same way?<br />
PM: I suppose you could if you filled the hail by tickets<br />
only admission tickets only but that is about the only way you could<br />
do it, because if it was a meeting where tickets were issued to the<br />
faithful only it could scarcely be called a real public meeting.<br />
[ f it is a real public meeting and the likelihood of interjections<br />
and noise and so on which I like the likelihood of At a meeting<br />
we hold is much greater than at a Imeeting they hold, and I think this </p>
<p>4.<br />
would interfere with the proper presentation of the Policy Speech.<br />
But after that, I would sooner be out speaking publicly. I think the<br />
meetings I liked the strect meetings we had in Queensland, at<br />
Tow nsville and Rockhampton. t would not be sure and this<br />
is just thinking; it is not to be attributed to me you are asking<br />
me the approaches and these are not decisions... I might possibly<br />
have a couple more meetings earlier on, but I am not sure in my own<br />
mind whether it is better to have a few and then concentrate them in<br />
the last five or six campaigning days.<br />
Q: On the question of campaigning, Sir, has this campaign<br />
brought home to you the absurdity of the Broadcasting and Television<br />
Act in respect of the broadcasting and televising of political material?<br />
What are your inclinations towards the amendment of that Act?<br />
PM: tI think the absurdity was first brought home when there<br />
was to be a by-election for some State seat, and the question arose<br />
wie<br />
Q. Curtin, wan't it?<br />
PM: lIt was a State by-election somewhere... in theory that<br />
was supposed to have prevented in some way the covering of the<br />
0 . Curtin one. I can't imagine why these restrictions were brought in.<br />
tI can't see any practical reasons for them.<br />
I don't think it is terribly important. It is very nice for the<br />
S newspapers. It is strange to hear a newspaper complaining'<br />
Q. Are you going to change it?<br />
PM: We will have a look at it.<br />
Q. Senator Greenwood seemed to think this week that what<br />
the na tion needed most rather than a five cent cigar is a censor to<br />
watch the way we write about politics....<br />
PM: H-e has denied that, you know.<br />
Q. Did he deny it publicly?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
Q. He denied that the report was accurate, did he?<br />
PM: Yes. I haven't gone into it in any depth but he has<br />
denied that the report as it came out was accurate and said what he </p>
<p>PM: PM:<br />
Q.<br />
PM: was trying to say. I am repeating what a newspaper reported what<br />
he had to say so I won't vouch for the truth of it'. It was reported<br />
that what he had to say was he didn't say that at all because he thought<br />
there should be some way of seeing that policies put forward were not<br />
distorted or were reported or something of that kind.<br />
1 ' 11 , Argue it out with him later.<br />
I would be a bit surprised if he said there should be any<br />
censorship because I am quite sure we wouldn't. I am sure I don't.<br />
Are you happy with the reporting of your campaign?<br />
Not particularly ' Unhappy with it. Not particularly unhappy<br />
with the reporting of the campaign. But I query some of the comments<br />
of some of the reporters. I am not disturbed about this but you asked<br />
me and it is in my mind. I think I had. a good meeting, for example,<br />
at Forrest Place. We had interjectors and that was rather fun. Somebody.<br />
went over with Mr Whitlamn and said Fare st Place was a much better<br />
meeting because he had more people and he didn't have any interjectors,<br />
and he had won the battle hands down. Fair enough. But if that is to<br />
happen, then when I go to Townsville and have 1, 000 people on the same<br />
street corner that he had 85 that might rate a mention too. That's<br />
what I meant. But I don't feel deeply about it. It's a small thing.<br />
This -limitation of candidate's expenses has come up again.<br />
I think it is $ 500 isn't it?<br />
Quite frankly, I wouldn't like to tell you with complete<br />
surety what it is because I know when I was standing for the Senate,<br />
for example I always used to as ~ itxxisx everybody else on<br />
both sides did sent in their returns and said they hadn't spent<br />
anything or just spent their hotel bills, which in fact was true. We<br />
hadn't. Somebody had. They had put advertisements in and put things<br />
on. Whether, legally, somebody doing that means that you have done it,<br />
I don't know. It can't I don't think. I suppose the basis of it of<br />
putting a limitation on spending out of one's own pocket is to try and<br />
give everyone a fair go, to try and stop a chap with a whole lot of<br />
money from overwhelming somebody who hasn't. That I am sure must<br />
have been the genesis of it. But whether you can extend that to say </p>
<p>that nobody can help a candidate is rather a trickier sort of<br />
a question.<br />
Q. As it is the law is being thrown rather into contempt<br />
by the fact of some candidates, for example, refusing to sign<br />
a declaration that they have spent particular amoits. There<br />
has neveK been any suggestion that anything should be done about<br />
them. Doesn't it seem a bad law<br />
PM: Whether the law only applies to spending out of one's<br />
own pocket is something. fairly significant, and I haven't had a<br />
legal interpretation of just whether it does. I would think there<br />
would be very few candidates who would spend out of their own<br />
pocket more than was allowed, but I would think that every candidate<br />
would have people collecting funds for him or donations being given<br />
to him which he would use in his'campaign. Whether that is a<br />
breach of the law or not, I doubt, but I am not giving a legal<br />
opinion on it.<br />
Q. Will 18-yiear-olds have a vote at the next Federal<br />
election?<br />
PM: t believe they will. There is the question as you know<br />
of getting uniform with the States,, so that we can have a uniform<br />
electoral~ roll and ther-is, so the conference of Attorneys -General<br />
tell me, other problems which come up and which they are<br />
discussing well, all right, if somebody is deemed to be a major<br />
and not a minor, what about inheritance of property and all those<br />
other kinds of things. But I have little doubt at all but that that<br />
will be ironed out.<br />
Q. . By the time this three years is up?<br />
PM: Yes. I would have little doubt that that would be so.<br />
Q. You think they will be voting next time round<br />
PM: I think so.<br />
Q. Are you happy with that prospect from your party's<br />
point of view?<br />
PM: Who knows what the situation will be in three years'<br />
time. We certainly wouldn't lose by 18-year-olds voting, but<br />
I don't think that ought to be the deciding factor </p>
