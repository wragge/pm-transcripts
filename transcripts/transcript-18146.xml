Today marks an important day in the recognition of long-serving police officers with the awarding of the first National Police Service Medals (NPSM).</p>
<p>Sixteen serving officers  -  two from each State and Territory  -  have become the first to be honoured with the newest medal in the Australian honours system.</p>
<p>The NPSM recognises police officers who have provided the highest standards of ethical and diligent service over a period of 15 years or more.</p>
<p>The medal also commits the officers to dedicated duty for the duration of their policing career as recipients must maintain the high standards of conduct in order to retain the medal.</p>
<p>NPSM holds up to our nation the fine example of police officers who set the benchmark for ethical and diligent service.</p>
<p>The medal is not only a measure of the length of service but a measure of the quality of that service.</p>
<p>This morning's presentation of the NPSM at Parliament House was the realisation of a 2007 election commitment to honour police officers who serve their community with dedication and integrity, and is the culmination of the hard work of the Police Federation of Australia and Australia's police commissioners to bring the NPSM to fruition.</p>
<p>The medal and its ribbon were designed by serving officers from the NSW and Australian Federal Police forces.</p>
