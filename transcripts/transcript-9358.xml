TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP AT " TMAROl DUARINGAI QUEENSLAND<br />
SEPTEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: .( inaudible)<br />
PMV: .( inaudible) it's got very expensive, I think, because of the fact that It<br />
has gone on for so many seasons. You know, It's got to the point<br />
where there is virtually.. . the grass has disappeared and you're really<br />
Into very dry country, and I think ( Inaudible) What it means Is that<br />
the breeding stock Is starting to go, and this is a long term problem for<br />
the cattle industry.<br />
J: You have talked to some of the hardest hit farmers in Central<br />
Queensland in that room there what are they demanding?<br />
PMV; Well, they're not demanding anything. I think they are very sensibly<br />
saying that this is a major economic and social problem and what we<br />
have got to do Is think our way through It to make sure that whatever<br />
measures we put Into place are most effective. Now, the point I made<br />
to them Is the thing that has motivated this Government Is the policies<br />
of Inclusion, that Australian society goes on together and we don't let<br />
one group slip behind. I said at election time we wouldn't let the<br />
unemployed slip behind, and I don't want to see the rural community<br />
slip behind, so I think this Is a chance In the face of this drought to<br />
sort of rennovate some of these policies to see that we do stay<br />
together In our society, and that the country is wealthy enough and<br />
compassionate enough to make sure that rural people are not denied<br />
income support and the sort of support they need to carry on their<br />
businesses.<br />
J: There are reports that the Federal Government will commit to a $ 100<br />
million package... a I--4 1 1' 4 U U U L. r v </p>
<p>I Li.. 2<br />
PM: Well look, I mean I'm reeking in questions about money I get every day<br />
of the week, frankly. Wait and see. What you want here are really, I<br />
think, thoughtful appraisals of policies to see whether they work rather<br />
than how much money Is it going to be. I mean, it will be as generous<br />
as we can make it but, most Importantly, more effective, as effective as<br />
we can make It.<br />
J: Did you expect it to be this dusty?<br />
PM: I did, but I didn't expect it to be so denuded of stock, end also to see<br />
some of the regrowth dying off. I mean, I think that's a pretty ominous<br />
sign to see some of this regrowth from species of scrub that can<br />
virtually exist on anything and they're dying too.<br />
J: Did you hear some sad stories in there today?<br />
PM: Well, now, I don't want to say they're sad stories, but they're<br />
meaningful stories. You know, they're stories that are looking for hope<br />
and want some sensible appraisal of their circumstances and that's<br />
wh~ at I'm here for.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well, again, we've already spent $ 100 million In the last.. slnce ' 92 on<br />
the RAS Scheme for drought. Thats the Commonwealth, and of<br />
course, we've stated, Queensland receives more. But It's not enough.<br />
It's a matter of how much we can do, but then how effectively we can<br />
-see it come down to where people can use It best.<br />
J: Do you think ( inaudible)...<br />
PM: Well, If we can get some handle on this In time, 1 will. Otherwise it will<br />
be a little later.<br />
J: And you spoke about a long-term drought strategy what was that?<br />
PM: Well, that's what I mean. There Is a set of .( inaudible In<br />
assistance that looks Into Income support, carry-on support, where<br />
they go after the drought financially those sorts of things that are In<br />
place year-in, year-out. They are there perpetually.<br />
