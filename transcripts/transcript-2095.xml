FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 64/ 1969<br />
DROUGHT RELIEF FOR QUEENSLAND<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. John Carton, referred<br />
today to the extra measures of drought relief assistance which<br />
he had agreed to make available to the Queensland Government<br />
in a letter to the Premier on 29 July.<br />
He recalled that in 1968-69 the Commonwealth<br />
gave approximately $ 2 million to Queensland on a dollar-fordollar<br />
sharing arrangement between the Commonwealth and<br />
the State. Mr. Gorton has now told the Queensland<br />
Government that in 1969-70 the present financial year the<br />
Commonwealth is prepared to give $ 2 million on the same<br />
sharing basis, and in addition will give the whole of any agreed<br />
relief expenditure which the State may incur in excess of<br />
$ 4 million. This excess expenditure is tentatively estimated<br />
to be approximately $ 6 million.<br />
The result is that as compared with a grant of<br />
$ 2 million last year the Commonwealth stands ready to provide<br />
an estimated $ 8 million this year.<br />
