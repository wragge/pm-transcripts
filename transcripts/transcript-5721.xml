TEAUSTRALIANFA<br />
The Australian Flag is the symbol of our nation's unity. it<br />
does not need me to remind all Australians that respect for<br />
our Flag should be encouraged.<br />
School. s, of course, play a vital role in bringing knowledge of<br />
the Flag and its correct use to our young people. Some time<br />
ago I met a group of school children who told me that the<br />
Australian Flag was flown at their school on only one day of the<br />
school week. I found this difficult to understand. Why don't<br />
our schools fly our National Flag with pride daily?<br />
This has prompted me to write this week to the Premiers and<br />
the Chief Mliiister of the Northern Territory, asking them to<br />
encourage schools to fly the National Flag every day of the<br />
school year.<br />
Since May 1979 the Fla;, of course, has been available free of<br />
charge not only to schools, but to very many other community<br />
groups. This Commonwealth initiative was designed to foster<br />
respect and familiarity with the symbol of our national unity.<br />
In that time more than 16,500 flags have been distributed through<br />
members of the Federal Parliament. </p>
