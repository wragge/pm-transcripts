    <content><![CDATA[<p>1 MARCH 1986</p>
<p>I have sent the following message to Mr Ingvar Carlsson, Deputy Prime minister of Sweden:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">" I was deeply shocked and saddened to hear of the murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme and the wounding of Mrs Palme.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sweden and the world have lost an outstanding leader. Olof Palme was a tireless and passionate fighter for social democracy and world peace. He stood for constructive dialogue and moderation in the resolution of international conflict and he has left an indelible imprint on the search for disarmament and international security in the Report which bears his name.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is a particular tragedy that a senseless outrage of this kind should strike Sweden, a country that has contributed so much to humane endeavours both at home and abroad.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I send the condolences and deepest sympathy of the Australian Government and people and of the many colleagues in the Australian Labor movement, including myself, who knew Olof to his wife and family and to the Government and people of Sweden.</p>
