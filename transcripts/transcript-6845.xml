    <content><![CDATA[<p>1 MARCH 1986</p>
<p>I have sent the following message to Mr Ingvar Carlsson, DeputyÂ Prime minister of Sweden:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">" I was deeply shocked and saddened to hear of theÂ murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme and the woundingÂ of Mrs Palme.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sweden and the world have lost an outstanding leader.Â Olof Palme was a tireless and passionate fighter forÂ social democracy and world peace. He stood forÂ constructive dialogue and moderation in theÂ resolution of international conflict and he has leftÂ an indelible imprint on the search for disarmamentÂ and international security in the Report which bearsÂ his name.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is a particular tragedy that a senseless outrageÂ of this kind should strike Sweden, a country that hasÂ contributed so much to humane endeavours both at homeÂ and abroad.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I send the condolences and deepest sympathy of theÂ Australian Government and people and of the manyÂ colleagues in the Australian Labor movement,Â including myself, who knew Olof to his wife andÂ family and to the Government and people of Sweden.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Bob Hawke"</p>
