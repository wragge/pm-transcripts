NE1: W YEUARI IMEAE<br />
Sta temcnt by the Acting Pr ime Mi n ister<br />
the Rt lion. J. D. Anthony, Mi. P1.<br />
Trhc fact that 1983 will he a difficult year should not caIuse<br />
us to throw in the towel but make us ask ourselves what we can do<br />
to minimise our problems and make the most of our oJpportUni ties.<br />
We would be foolish to try to hide the difficulties<br />
Australia and its people face in the coming year.<br />
Yet despite the problems the outlook beyond the immediate<br />
future is anything but gloomy. We have an abundance of natural<br />
resources and great productive capacity. We also have the human<br />
resources necessary to enable us to take advantage of world<br />
economic recovery when it occurs.<br />
Our current economic problems are partly the result of the<br />
world-wide recession as a result of which unemployment is at very<br />
serious levels in virtually all developed countries. In<br />
Australia, our own situation was worsened by excessive wage<br />
increases which occurred when production was not rising. These<br />
increases added to costs and inflation, they undermined our<br />
competitiveness, and contributed in a major way to the rise n<br />
unemployment But there are some things we can do to help ourselves. As<br />
events in New South Wales in the last few days have shown, if we<br />
are prepared to attack a serious problem when practical means are<br />
available to do so, excellent results can be achieved.<br />
Random breath-testing, despite the concern some people have<br />
about it, does appear to have achieved a most important and<br />
worthwhile reduction in the road toll over the Christmas period.<br />
This demonstrates that if the community is prepared to<br />
accept a radical approach and the disciplines and limitations<br />
such approaches demand, very worthwhile results can be achieved.<br />
The wages pause which the Commonwealth is seeking to have<br />
put in place is, for Australia a radical approach to our economic<br />
problems, and in particular the problems-of unemployment.<br />
It is an approach which involves discipline and even a<br />
degree of sacri fice on the part of those who have jobs, in the<br />
interests of helping those who want jobs, or are anxious about<br />
losing jobs.<br />
If we are all prepared to make the-wage pause work, it can<br />
he of real value. If some of-us are not prepared to give it a </p>
<p>fair go, and seek to undermine it, there is no chance of its<br />
working, and achieving the results it is capable of achieving.<br />
Last week's decision by the Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Commission to implement a 6-month pause in federal award rates is<br />
a welcome reflection of the consensus which is developing in our<br />
community. Some State tribunals have made similar decisions.<br />
Unfortunately, some union leaders have attacked the<br />
tribunals' decisions and have announced their intention to ignore<br />
or circumvent them. Such an approach would be selfish and<br />
misguided. I do not believe thinking Australians will support<br />
this sort of approach.<br />
To circumvent the Commission's decision, to ignore a measure<br />
which all governments have agreed is necessary, by campaigning<br />
for over-award wage rises, by threatening industrial action, will<br />
not help our economy to recover and will not create jobs.<br />
I ask all wage and salary-carners to give the wage pause a<br />
chance to work. We all owe that to our fellow Australians who<br />
are suffering real hardship.<br />
For many Australians, the New Year, unless good rain falls<br />
soon, will see a continuation of an already desperate situation.<br />
The drought that is ravaging a large part of Australia is<br />
affecting not only many thousands of individual farmers and their<br />
families, but also the communities of which they are part, and<br />
the nation as a whole.<br />
The scope of the disaster is perhaps not yet fully grasped,<br />
nor is the extent of the economic consequences of the drought<br />
fully apparent. It is certainly adding to the severity of the<br />
recession and adversely affecting the whole economy.<br />
The Commonwealth, and the various State Governments, are<br />
doing a great deal to try to help people get through the drought,<br />
and this is costing the taxpayer a lot of money.<br />
There may be a need to do more. The Government will respond<br />
to such needs as they become evident.<br />
Wheat growers need finance to plant their next crop and,<br />
when the drought ends and we all hope that will be very soon<br />
farmers will need help in financing re-stocking. I am confident<br />
the banks and other financial institutions will be as<br />
understanding as they can be of farmers' needs, and indeed of the<br />
needs of every section of the community affected by the<br />
drought. The Government will be giving close attention to these<br />
requi rements. As we enter 1983, the challenge is to remember that our<br />
future lies largely in our own hands. </p>
<p>3.<br />
We can put the blame on everyone else, or on things we<br />
cannot control or we can look for things we can do to help put<br />
Australia back on a strong economic footing.<br />
We often speak of the need for all Australians to pull<br />
together in times of difficulty. The wage pause even though it<br />
is but one element of our efforts gives us an opportunity to do<br />
just that: for everyone who receives a wage or salary, or who<br />
receives a professional income, to join together in an exercise<br />
in restraint. Here is something we can do. Let's do it, and let us all<br />
put our efforts into making Australia in 1983 a more productive<br />
efficient and rewarding place for its people.<br />
