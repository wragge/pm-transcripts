<p>E&amp;OE...........  </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well before you ask any questions can I just say what an absolutely fantastic job these men have done for Australia, the credit they have brought to the Australian Defence Force, the respect they have won amongst their coalition partners, and most importantly the gratitude of the Australian nation that they deservedly receive for having put their lives on the line. Tragically one of their number did not return and we think of him in particular on this occasion, Sergeant Andrew Russell, we think particularly of him.  I just want to say to everybody that they';ve done a great job and we';re all very proud of them. We know their loved ones are very happy to have them home.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, another SAS trooper went public today saying he was dealt very shabbily by the Army and he was [inaudible].  Do you think we';re doing enough for troops who return? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don';t obviously know the circumstances of that particular case. I';m quite sure that as a result of what has been said today the authorities will have a look at it and respond. Generally speaking I think the conditions that are offered are good. It';s always possible I suppose to say they could be better but they were significantly improved before the East Timor deployment and they';re the sort of things that are kept under constant review. But as to the particular circumstances of that case I can';t answer that but I';m quite sure the Army people will respond.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do troops going to Afghanistan go in the comfort that they';ll be looked after …?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. Absolutely, absolutely without qualification and I think the reaction of people today indicates that whilst they saw their mission as being a difficult one, they saw it as part of the job that they signed up to do and they';re very proud to have done it and I believe that the conditions that are offered and the way in which generally the Army responds to people is first class. Obviously if there are circumstances in a particular case that need to be looked at they will. But I don';t know those circumstances and I really can';t take any more questions on it because I just don';t know the circumstances.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, interest rates remaining the same for now. Are you happy with the decision of the Reserve Bank?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I think it';s a good decision, a very good decision. It';s not a surprising decision because we have low inflation in this country and we therefore should continue to have low interest rates. But it doesn';t mean to say that there won';t be some variation at some time in the future. I';m not going to guarantee that they';ll never go up again. That would be ridiculous. But I am going to guarantee that they';re more likely to remain lower under our policies than the polices of any alternative that';s even remotely on the horizon.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There';s talk of a rise of sort of 0.75%. Can you see that happening down the track?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I';m not going to get into that sort of speculation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Many financial experts predicted the rates would rise today but you';re saying you';re not surprised.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I';m not the least bit surprised. I didn';t think they';d put them up today.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] states are behind it, scientists are behind it, what';s the government';s position?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I';ll be having something to say about that at an appropriate time over the next couple of days. What I';ve done is to talk to a lot of scientists. I';ve also consulted religious leaders. It';s not an easy issue. It involves some important medical research issues but it also involves some very important ethical issues and it';s very important that if we are going to move in this area that we get the balance right. I believe that the attitude the Government will take on this issue will get the balance right. It';s not a case for careless haste, it';s not a situation where there should be careless haste. Equally we have to take into account the medical science potential.  So we';re doing all of that and I can assure the Australian public that the attitude the Federal Government takes will be a fair and balanced one and will take all of those factors into account.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Has the Government decided a position?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I';ll be saying something about it quite soon.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I am aware of Archbishop Carnley';s view. His view is a bit different from some of the other people. That adds to the interest of the subject doesn';t it, that everybody';s got such a range of views and what we';ve got to try and do in the public interest is strike the right balance. I believe we will and I think the Australian public will support the decision and the stance we take.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the COAG meeting tomorrow, this is the first time you';ve met with all Labor Premiers…..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can';t wait.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You can';t wait?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean it';s Friday, I can';t wait to meet them all.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You can';t see a sort of Labor versus Liberal sort of…..?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there won';t be from me. I mean if they want to divide them against me well it will be they who are dividing the country on political grounds. I don';t go to these COAG meetings wanting to fight Premiers. I enjoy having Premiers to dinner and around the table. I look forward…..</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I forget, take your pick.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is there bad blood after the Treasurers'; meeting with the GST…..?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No bad blood on my part and no bad blood on the Treasurer';s part. The Treasurer and I are milk and honey when it comes to the Premiers.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard is the Governor General going to the Queen Mother';s funeral?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What';s happening on this front? Is anyone going?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I';m representing Australia. I think that';s enough. I don';t think you need any more than just the Prime Minister. That';s the appropriate thing. I';ll be attending. I know that the Prime Minister of Canada is going and the Prime Minister of New Zealand is going. I don';t know about other Commonwealth leaders but that';s in my view the appropriate representation. I don';t think there';s any need for anybody else. I don';t think that'; really seriously suggested. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you see the SAS soldiers as heroes?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think all Australian soldiers, sailors and airmen and women who put their lives on the line for this country are heroes, unqualifiably yes, all of them. I thought our people in Timor were heroes and I think these men are heroes. That world is thrown around a little too carelessly on occasions but I think it does apply here. I think they';re wonderful people and I';m very proud of them and so are all Australians.  Thank you.</p>
