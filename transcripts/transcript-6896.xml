FOR MEDIA 23 April 1986<br />
ZMBARGOED UNTIL 100pm ITALIAN TIME, 9Olbpz AEST<br />
The Prime Dlinister of Australia, and the Prime Miniatar of<br />
Italy# Signor Czraxil today signed an historic treaty on social<br />
security matters.<br />
Mr Hawke said that dincuasions between the two countries had<br />
been proceeding in a desultoxy fashion since 1952 but there<br />
have always been obstacles in the way of progress.<br />
He said " my Government which camne to office in March 1983 has<br />
shown the initiative and determination to find the solutions.<br />
We ha~ ve consulted widely with migrant communities in Australia<br />
and-the solutions we haus found have widespread support".<br />
The Italian and Australian social security systems are quite<br />
different. Italy has a contributory system whereas the<br />
Auctralian system is funded fromn taxation revenue. Italy pays a<br />
penaion based on periods of contribution combined with level of<br />
eanings ( with a minimum level of pension) whereas Auntralia<br />
pays a fiuad rat pension. The Italian systam applies generally<br />
to income earners whereas the Australian oystem applieB to all<br />
adults who have resided in Australia.<br />
The Australian Government has had to pacs legislation introducing a<br />
system of proportional portability of pensions to credta a basis<br />
on which it could negotiate agreemente.<br />
Mr Hawke said " ths completion of this agreement will be a major<br />
benefit to Italians and Australians who have spent some-time in<br />
both countries. It overcomes gaps in coverage of the two social<br />
security 3yatems which'have led to inequitios in treatment in the paot.<br />
' it is a major cocial advance.<br />
" Over 20,000 people in Auatralia and*. ItAly. tane expected to benefit<br />
directly. These people will include:<br />
people who have spent less than the minimum qualigying period<br />
in ona of the countries ( eg less than 15 years employee<br />
contributions in Xtaly or less -than 10 years residen= kiAintralia),<br />
people who have spent son-ie :. time in AustralizY but who have<br />
returned to Italy before they have beome due for a penaion.<br />
" I am delighted that thic Agreement wil11 enable Auetralia to pay<br />
pensions to many people who have contributed to society in Australia<br />
but who have chosen to retire in Italy. </p>
<p>2.<br />
" Australia is proud that some 500,000 Italians have chosen<br />
to migrate and to make Australia their new home. They have<br />
made a major contribution to economic, social and cultural<br />
development in Australia and hence to its progress as a<br />
nation. This agreement brings us closer together and<br />
enables people who have moved their country of residence<br />
to receive better rewards for a lifetime of work.<br />
" Officials from the two countries are now working on<br />
administrative processes to ensure that the Agreement<br />
can be ratifieA11and come into force ot the earliest<br />
possible time.<br />
Mr BuW~ ke -; idd√± ztib~ ite t the work done my Mr Howe, the<br />
Ministerlfor Social Security, for the work done in bringing<br />
these negotiations to finality. He said that without his<br />
interest in the welfare of ethnic cozmunities and his<br />
initiative we would still be dithering as other Ministers<br />
had done since 1952.<br />
He added that Mr HOwe will issue Statements from time to<br />
time advising the public of progress with other agreements. </p>
