2 May 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
RADIO INTERVIEW ALAN JONES RADIO 2UE<br />
E&amp; O E<br />
JONES: The Prime Minister, with plenty on his plate is sitting absolutely opposite me. Prime<br />
Minister, good morning.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good morning Alan, always good to be with you.<br />
JONES: Don't say that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I will.<br />
JONES: Oh really.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's true!<br />
JONES: Now look, I thought we would start by listening to the people who are your<br />
constituency. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Sure. JONES: Because this morning I took two calls, one from David and one from Bruce. This is<br />
David. DAVID: Alan, I'd like you to put something to Mr Howard. I want him to consider that you've<br />
worked all week, right up ' til Wednesday afternoon to pay taxes, direct, indirect taxes<br />
and government charges. Now I don't want to see one more cent of my tax dollar go<br />
to reconciliation. I believe there's enough money allocated for, per head, of<br />
indigenous people to make everyone of them well off, provided that it's administered<br />
correctly. There's a hell of a lot of waste there and I want to see it stopped. I'm sick<br />
of it, and I know a lot of other people are sick of it.<br />
JONES: Well, just combining that call, the very next call PM and I just take calls as they come<br />
up, there's no manipulation of anything here, these are the first two callers on the line<br />
this is Bruce. </p>
<p>BRUCE: Alan, when you talk to the Prime Minister there's two things I'd like you to ask him.<br />
Alexander Downer said yesterday that Pauline Hanson's policies would cost jobs. I<br />
would like to know what have politicians, not just governments and oppositions I'm<br />
talking about, done in the last 20 or 30 years to save our industries and save our jobs<br />
when we have one and a half million out of work?<br />
JONES: And then that followed with a caller who said well, when we're talking about jobs we<br />
think about Bob Hawke and Malcolm Fraser and Paul Keating and John Howard.<br />
We'll just take the first point then, how much money is Wik going to cost the<br />
taxpayer9 PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we haven't agreed if it's going to cost anything. I mean, I'm going to sit down<br />
no doubt and be presented with requests from the Aboriginal community for an<br />
economic empowerment package. Like any other section of the community they can<br />
put a view to me. But can I say, I agree with that first caller. There is a lot of anger in<br />
the community. There's a feeling that millions of dollars have been wasted in the<br />
Aboriginal affairs area. I mean, just remember and can I say this to that caller and<br />
can I say it to you that I'm the Prime Minister who took money out of the ATSIC<br />
budget. I'm the Prime Minister who was attacked by the media of this country for<br />
taking money out of the ATSIC budget. I'm the Prime Minister who insisted that<br />
when we came into government we should direct money into areas that were really<br />
needed in the Aboriginal affairs department. I'm the bloke that's been under constant<br />
attack from Aboriginal leaders since the time I became Prime Minister for being<br />
insensitive to their situation. Now, I'm the Prime Minister who tried to end the farce<br />
of the Hindmarsh Bridge and the secret women's business. I lead the Party that<br />
opposed that legislation. I'm also the Prime Minister who belonged to the Party that<br />
voted against the Native Title Act in 1993. Now, it's all very well, and I can<br />
understand why people feel like that but I want to get the record straight, any<br />
suggestion that we have perpetuated the Aboriginal industry is wrong. Any suggestion<br />
that we have continued the ludicrous practices of Robert Tickner when he was<br />
Aboriginal Affairs Minister are wrong. But equally they are Australians like you and<br />
me and when you are dealing with matters that affect the Aboriginal people, like native<br />
title, they are entitled to be consulted, they are entitled to be treated decently and<br />
ordinarily like anybody else.<br />
JONES: But to what extent then is the Wik issue a fight over money? I mean, the Century Zinc<br />
Mine matter..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think everything has a financial dimension to it. And you know what the<br />
problem with Wik can I there are two things about Wik. The Wik mess and it is a<br />
mess was caused by a very bad Native Title Act drafted by Paul Keating, which we<br />
opposed, compounded by a highly impractical decision of the High Court of Australia<br />
in December last year and I had the responsibility of cleaning up that mess..<br />
JONES: Paul Keating though put into that native title legislation that pastoral leases would<br />
extinguish native title.. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No he didn't, no he put it in... no he stripped it... no, I'm sorry...<br />
JONES: Well hang on, you people voted against the native title bill entirely. Had he shoved<br />
that thing in...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No that is... I'm sorry Alan, that is just nonsense...<br />
JONES: Did the National Party people cross the floor to support the extinguishment of native<br />
title? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look Alan, Alan, Alan look...<br />
JONES: Well, yes or no?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I mean, I'll decide...<br />
JONES: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Alan look, I'll decide how I... you can decide what questions...<br />
JONES: Well it's a simple answer.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I'll simply state my position and that is simply just that I'll decide how I answer<br />
the question...<br />
JONES: It's a pretty simple question.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, the simple question is this, that Paul Keating refused to put a clause in the Native<br />
Title Act in 1993 to extinguish pastoral leases because he couldn't secure the<br />
agreement of the parties to that and he wasn't willing to so provide in the legislation.<br />
JONES: My information is that there was no one person in 1993 who then lobbied the<br />
Government, who argued that native title should co-exist with pastoral leases.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, my information is quite different and I have spoken to people who were present<br />
at the discussions and they deny that.<br />
JONES: </p>
<p>Okay, well we might actually raise that ( inaudible),.. not this week...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well can I say, can I say with respect, that was three and a half years ago. It is now<br />
May 1997 and what the farmers of Australia want now is the uncertainty removed.<br />
And the only plan that is going to remove that uncertainty is my plan, no other plan.<br />
An extinguishment option in the wake of the High Court decision is not going to<br />
remove the uncertainty and people who run around saying it is don't understand the<br />
situation...<br />
JONES: So what access will Aborigines have to land which is the subject of pastoral activity<br />
which you won't specifically say has extinguished native title because that's a one<br />
sentence solution?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it won't be a one sentence Alan, no pastoral activity under my plan can be<br />
interfered with by a native title claim, none.<br />
JONES: So pastoral leases do extinguish native title, why don't you say it in one sentence?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well Alan, I've answered that question.<br />
JONES: But if no pastoral plan can be in anyway interfered with by native title...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No pastoral activity, no farming activity can be interfered with by native title.<br />
JONES: So why don't you just say pastoral leases will extinguish native title..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I can I am required to state these things in a manner that is consistent with the<br />
law. I mean, you have the luxury of using shorthand terms like that, I don't.<br />
JONES: So how I just want to come back to that point if nothing involved in a pastoral lease<br />
can be interfered with..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Nothing involved in pastoral, farming or agricultural activity under my plan can be<br />
interfered with by a native title claim. It may well be that in the course of that activity<br />
being carried out there is some extinguishment or some overriding of a native title<br />
right. If that is so then because of the law of this country they are entitled to<br />
compensation and so..<br />
JONES: So how much...?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>we're dealing in practical realities. And the practical reality is that my plan will<br />
enable every pastoral leaseholder in this country to run his property without<br />
interference, without having to get the permission of any native title claimant, and my<br />
plan will deliver a greater degree of certainty at less cost and less frustration both to<br />
farmers and to the Australian community.<br />
JONES: So what then are you saying to Aborigines who're meeting with you every second day<br />
and arguing that pastoral leases must co-exist with native title? That's what...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But what I am saying to them is that they can't have the Wik decision. I have said<br />
from day one...<br />
JONES: And will they take that decision to court then?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, look Alan, I can't stop anybody taking something to court. If you extinguish<br />
native title, if you do what you have been arguing for and what some others have been<br />
arguing for, you will end up in court. ci 26 4ye;-p </p>
<p>JONES: Therefore it's going to be tremendous cost..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Alan, Alan...<br />
JONES: .( inaudible) your plan won't ( inaudible) the cost.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Alan, we are a democracy. You cannot wipe out anybody's right to go to court.<br />
JONES: So there could be big costs here.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well there will be much bigger costs if you go down the extinguishment route...<br />
JONES: Well if I'm a farmer and I go about my business...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
there will be much bigger costs if you go down the extinguishment route. If people<br />
out there are worried about cost, don't support extinguishment because<br />
extinguishment will lead to mega cost, extinguishment could lead to constitutional<br />
challenge, extinguishment will inflame and already difficult situation.<br />
JONES: But I thought you just told me that your pastoral lease will extinguish native title.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Not blanket extinguishment.<br />
JONES: How much money out there, the taxpayer wants to know...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes I understand that and I am sticking up for the taxpayer by rejecting the option that<br />
would lead to a much larger compensation bill. Can I say that again if you really<br />
want a huge compensation bill go down the extinguishment route. Do you understand<br />
that blanket extinguishment... whatever you might think of the High Court decision,<br />
and I've got to say I thought it was an impractical decision, the fact remains that I as<br />
Prime Minister of this country have got to deal with the law of the land as it is, not as<br />
we would want it to be. And if you have blanket extinguishment the potential<br />
compensation bill is much greater, I repeat, much greater for all of your taxpaying<br />
listeners than the alternative that I have proposed.<br />
JONES: So what are you going to do with the $ 1.4 billion land fund which was the trade-off of<br />
the Mabo legislation? Is that offer withdrawn? Are the new cards on the table? Does<br />
the $ 1.4 billion land fund stay in place?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well once again, depending on who you talk to, there are different versions about that<br />
land fund. I've spoken to some of the people who were present. Some of them say it<br />
was a trade-off for the Aboriginal community agreeing to validation of old titles.<br />
Others say it was a trade-off for something else. I have already said that it is<br />
something that I will bring into consideration when I am looking at other proposals<br />
that are being put to me. If you're asking me to say is there any possibility of that land<br />
fund being used for compensation to which native title holders might be entitled in the<br />
event that there's any compulsory acquisition of their title or any extinguishment of<br />
their title, the answer is, well that's something I'm going to consider.<br />
JONES: Okay one final question, one final..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I can well understand why people would want to see me take that into account.<br />
JONES: One final point then on the Wik thing. John Howard then puts this 10 Point Plan into a<br />
lump of legislation and in that legislation, according to what is said to me, there's<br />
going to be no interference with the right of the farmer who has a pastoral lease to<br />
pursue pastoral production.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's right. So he won't have to get anybody's permission...<br />
JONES: Right, but then the second point that John Howard says though is no one can be<br />
denied, and rightly so, access to the law.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's right.<br />
JONES: So suddenly a native title claimant decides well, I'm going to challenge, as did the Wik<br />
case, I'm going to challenge John Howard and we're going to go to the courts. How<br />
on earth can that create certainty for the farmer or the miner?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well Alan, what you're saying there is that the only way you can create certainty is to<br />
take away the rights of one section of the Australian community to go to court.<br />
JONES: I'm not saying that. I'm saying your plan will provide certainty...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But Alan, there is no plan the Howard plan, the one line extinguishment plan, some<br />
other plan there is no plan that can stop somebody going to court.<br />
JONES: So we could in fact have this uncertainty about whose right, entitlements, over a lump<br />
of land between now and the year 2000.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Alan, Alan, this plan of all the plans is more likely to produce certainty than any other.<br />
But you're asking me to guarantee that there is a plan that will a) prevent people going<br />
to court and b) prevent a decision that is impractible. I can't do that. We live in a<br />
democracy. JONES: It's going to be great fun...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I am the Prime Minister, I am not the Chief Justice of the..<br />
JONES: Well, the Chief Justice said that it was an absurdity to say that they could co-exist.<br />
problem with them.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well he was in the minority. He was in the minority. But look Alan this is an<br />
important issue and it is easy to say what you have just said. You know, we are going<br />
to have this enormous problem, isn't this terrible etcetera.... Look, I can only deliver a<br />
plan that I genuinely believe will guarantee the greatest amount of certainty that is<br />
available. I am doing that and I say to your listeners, if you want greater uncertainty,<br />
support extinguishment, if you want a bigger bill at the end of the day, support<br />
extinguishment, if you want to inflame an already difficult situation support<br />
extinguishment, but if you want something that delivers a better prospect of stability<br />
and security, support my plan.<br />
JONES: Okay, in March 1996, John Howard became Prime Minister. He was just an MP and<br />
leader of the Opposition. Equally Kim Beazley became Leader of the Opposition<br />
having just been a Minister. It was also the month in which a person called Pauline<br />
Hanson became an NVP. In that brief period of time she apparently commands anythinQ<br />
up to 10 -25% of the electorate's support. What mistakes have Howard and Beazley<br />
made between them that have enabled that drift of support to go to a person who was<br />
unknown 15 months ago.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well being an incurably optimistic person Alan, a positive person, I don't sort of dwell<br />
on my own mistakes, I acknowledge I make a lot of them, but plenty of other people<br />
dwell on them, but let me explain why I think there is a transitory appeal for Pauline<br />
Hanson in the opinion polls. I think Pauline Hanson is tapping into the frustrations of<br />
sections of the community. She's not offering any solutions. I mean, for example, she<br />
talks about foreign investment, what is she saying? Is she saying that we should cut<br />
out foreign investment. If she's saying we should cut out foreign investment what she<br />
really wants to do is to destroy the jobs of thousands of Australians because if it<br />
weren't for foreign investment, a lot of Australians who now have jobs wouldn't have<br />
jobs. JONES: All right let me ask you this..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
So it's very easy, it's very easy at any time in the history of this country... </p>
<p>JONES: She thinks that you were elected to allay those concerns. The head of the tax office,<br />
international tax division, said in October last year this, and I quote exactly from the<br />
tax office " the vast majority of local and foreign multinationals pay little or no tax in<br />
Australia 60% and this is an official of the tax office 60% claim to be in loss and<br />
pay no tax, the remaining 40% claim to be only marginally profitable". He went on<br />
that 7000 multinationals claimed $ 30 billion in interest expenses which was 60% of all<br />
interest expenses claimed by Australian based companies with transactions of over<br />
billion. Now, what perhaps the people are whingeing about, Pauline Hanson, is that<br />
if you have the abattoirs 80% owned by foreigners, baby food 100%, beef processing<br />
biscuits 90%, car manufacturers 98%, frozen vegetables 95%... there's a hell of a<br />
lot of inaudible...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
being eroded. The tax avoiders activities.., people who try and avoid tax. Just a<br />
minute... JONES: The only difference is the money that is being repatriated by them is providing jobs for<br />
people.... PRIME MINISTER:<br />
this notion that you somehow or other help Australia by chopping off their foreign<br />
investment... PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Alan, Alan look, what I said and I repeat, this notion that you somehow or other help<br />
Australia by chopping off all foreign investment...<br />
JONES: I don't think anyone is saying that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't know, is she..<br />
JONES: Well hang on, are those levels of foreign investment acceptable?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no you asked me...<br />
JONES: No, she's not the leader, you are.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No but you just asked me a question about it.<br />
JONES: No, are you happy...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No you asked me a question about... </p>
<p>JONES: Are you happy with the level of foreign investment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Hang on, don't change the subject. You asked me to react to why there was some<br />
kind of opinion poii rating by her and I gave you my response to that. I mean, what<br />
she is doing is mouthing slogans. She is mouthing slogans...<br />
JONES: So all these people you are talking to who actually support her are racist or sloganeers<br />
or something, are they?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I haven't said that.<br />
JONES: Well what do you say about these people who actually think she's got a bit going for<br />
her?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You asked me to express a view. I am expressing a view and you're now trying to get<br />
onto something else. I mean, you asked me about Pauline Hanson. I gave you a<br />
response and now we're getting onto something else.<br />
JONES:<br />
No, you challenged me about foreign ownership. Are you happy with the levels of<br />
foreign ownership?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I'm actually challenging her nostrums on foreign ownership. I mean, what she is in<br />
effect saying is we shouldn't have any foreign ownership and the point I'm simply<br />
making is that is simplistic nonsense.<br />
JONES: No, she's not saying there should be any foreign ownership.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well what is she saying?<br />
JONES: She is saying that the levels are too high.<br />
PRJME MINISTER:<br />
Is she? I haven't heard her say that.<br />
JONES: Do you think they are too high?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think in some areas they are. I mean, for example in..<br />
JONES: So what are you doing about it? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well for example, in the media for example, which is in the news at the moment, we've<br />
made it clear we don't want foreign investment to go any higher, haven't we.<br />
JONES: Abattoirs in this country have been closed because the meat industry, just take one<br />
example, is predominantly owned by American interests. The same American interests<br />
are now signing on to large export orders from Japan. They are being denied by<br />
Australia. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes that's true and unhappily, very unhappily we've had the situation in the last few<br />
days where the largest Australian company is going to close its operation in Newcastle<br />
and jobs are going to be lost. Now I think both of those developments, both of those<br />
developments are very unfortunate and quite tragic for the people involved. The point<br />
I simply make is that don't assume that if everything is Australian owned, you will<br />
automatically prevent all...<br />
JONES: We're not expecting them all to be Australian owned.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It is a question of balance and the only way that you can build up, you can build up<br />
Australian ownership in this country is to generate greater savings.<br />
JONES: Okay, let's take that point. Before I come back to savings and let's just write that<br />
down because I will come back to you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I hope you do, I hope you come back to it.<br />
JONES: I will. We're a member of the World Trade Organisation, aren't we?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes. JONES: We are. Every country which is a member of the World Trade Organisation is bound<br />
to accord foreign companies full rights to establish themselves in all sectors of the<br />
economy of that particular country, that's Australia. That is, you are required under<br />
the WTO arrangements to adjust domestic laws which might favour local industries at<br />
the expense of foreign companies. they are the rules of being a member of the WTO.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
They're one of the rules, yes.<br />
JONES: Do you think that's sensible, that you are required, if a foreign country comes, if a<br />
foreign company comes in here to take charge of an Australian industry that we are<br />
required to adjust domestic laws if those domestic laws create an imbalance or a<br />
favoured position to an Australian company in the same business. Is that sense? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, let me put it this way, in practice it's not the sort of rule that I would allow my<br />
Government to follow.<br />
JONES: Well, you're a member of the World Trade Organisation. Are we making<br />
representations to repair that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look Alan, that is a gross, may I say so, is a gross oversimplification of the rule.<br />
JONES: It's not, it's not. Just come back to savings, what is your attitude towards savings?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think what we have to do increasingly in this community is to encourage all forms of<br />
public and private savings. I mean, it's no good railing against the level of foreign<br />
investment unless you provide an alternative that increases Australian ownership and<br />
the only way that you can increase Australian ownership is to increase savings. It's the<br />
only way, otherwise you have to put up with a lower standard of living. I understand<br />
why people don't like high levels of foreign ownership but if you want to get rid of<br />
them, what you have to do is to provide Australians with a greater investment stock so<br />
that more Australian companies can afford to retain their positions and to buy other<br />
assets. Now there's no alternative to that<br />
JONES:<br />
None what ever, none what ever...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And we are tackling that problem in a number of ways. I mean, one of the reasons<br />
why, dull though it sounds, one of the reasons why we are reducing the budget deficit<br />
is that the more you reduce the deficit the more you increase national savings because<br />
when you go into deficit you've got to borrow and by borrowing you crowd out the<br />
capacity of companies to use the money thereby borrowed to do productive things in<br />
Australia.<br />
JONES: Let me take it simpler than that, can I.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes. JONES: There are thousands of people, hundreds of thousands of people listening to you now.<br />
They get $ 300, $ 400, $ 500 bucks a week. They're taxed on that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, they are.<br />
JONES: They then take what's left and they deposit it into a bank account. they pay one of<br />
your taxes on that deposit, a federal financial instruments duty bill. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
They pay income tax.<br />
JONES: They've paid income tax and they pay a financial institutions duty...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's now a state tax.<br />
JONES: Hang on, you've got the capacity to address savings. Then when they save, earn<br />
anything on the savings, that's taxed as well and you're expecting them to believe that<br />
you're on the side of the bloke that wants to save.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think the present taxation system does operate harshly on personal savings. I think it<br />
does. JONES: Don't you think we need more income, more profit and more savings and therefore the<br />
tax system should be changed to encourage all of those and we need less expenditure<br />
and the tax system ought to be changed to actually tax expenditure. Isn't that a<br />
powerful case for a GST?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We certainly need less expenditure and we need lower tax.<br />
JONES: Is there a powerful case for a GST?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I supported a GST in the past, you know that and you also know that I made a<br />
solemn promise to the Australian people on your programme and on numerous other<br />
programmes that we wouldn't introduce a GST in our first term.<br />
JONES: But aren't you flexible enough to recognise that out there they are desperate for<br />
changes to the tax system?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Flexibility equals in this case a blatantly broken promise?<br />
JONES: Well, if that is the right thing to do, break the promise.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
To break promises?<br />
JONES: If it's the right thing for the country... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I'd never think it is the right thing for a Prime Minister who has looked people in<br />
the eye and made a solemn promise and on that basis helped to get elected. To<br />
cynically say...<br />
JONES: No matter what damage it's doing to the community?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Alan, I don't believe that the damage that is being done as you put it, is anywhere near<br />
as great as the damage...<br />
JONES: Well you've told me we've got a problem with our savings.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Alan can I please just, you've asked me a question and please let me finish. I don't<br />
think the damage that would be done would be nearly as great as the damage that<br />
would be done to the integrity and the system of government if I were to break such a<br />
solemn promise and I'm not going to do it. I mean, you can criticise me and people<br />
can attack me but when I have looked people in the eye and said I will not in my first<br />
term introduce a GST, I have repeated that during the campaign, for you to come<br />
along and say, I should just chuck that out the window, that would do immense<br />
damage for the respect people have for the system, and God knows, that system, that<br />
respect is not as high as it might be.<br />
JONES: Even if out there the taxation system is screaming for overhaul, veritably yelling out.<br />
You told me there was an absence of savings and the tax system penalises savings.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Can I tell you, if I could have a moment, can I tell you some of the things that we have<br />
done to improve the tax system but do you know from the first of July this year, any<br />
small business man in Australia will be able to sell a business and invest up to<br />
million of the proceeds of the sale of that business in the purchase of another business<br />
without paying any capital gains, without paying any capital gains tax.<br />
JONES: He wants to hang onto his business, Prime Minister, not sell it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, a lot of them want to sell one business and get into a better business. I mean, this<br />
is called progress. It's called making a profit in one business and going into another.<br />
Now that is an enormous boost, it's an enormous boost to people in small business and<br />
that will lead to more jobs.<br />
JONES: Okay, well on that basis since Wallis was brought down, can you tell me one<br />
businessman you know who is paying cheaper interest rates?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Since Wallis was brought down? Well I know a lot of businessmen who are paying<br />
cheaper interest rates since we came into power. I know business men who are paying<br />
one to one and a half percent interest rates since we came into power. The interest </p>
<p>rates are still too high but I know lots of business people who are paying lower interest<br />
rates since we came to power. They're still too high but they are lower than what they<br />
were in March of 1996.<br />
JONES: When Peter Costello tells us that we've killed inflation and we've got inflation below<br />
2% or whatever, isn't that an admission that real interest rates are amongst the highest<br />
in the industrialised world?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Our real interest rates are too high and I have said and I will say it again on your<br />
programme now that we still don't have enough competition for small business finance<br />
within the banking system and one of the objectives of the Wallis inquiry was to inject<br />
more competition into the small business area. We have lower, much lower housing<br />
interest rates in Australia now than small business rates. In fact the housing rates are<br />
the lowest we've had for almost 40 years and the reason you've got much lower<br />
housing rates Is you've got people like John Symons and RAMS and Aussie Home<br />
Loans and all those tremendous outfits that have come into the market and provided<br />
more competition. I mean, the reason you've got low housing rates is that you've got<br />
more competition. That is what you need in the small business area. Now you're right<br />
in saying that small business rates are too high. You are wrong to suggest that they<br />
haven't come down at all since we've been in power. I mean, let's get the facts<br />
correct. JONES: What I am suggesting is that we did have a small business bank once. it was called the<br />
Commonwealth Bank. They actually didn't make profit the bottom line, it was the<br />
people's bank. Why wouldn't John Howard say to big banks, you've had your chance<br />
to lend money to small business at affordable rate, we will direct the Reserve Bank to<br />
lend money to what will be called a small business bank.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You can't generate credit out of thin air.<br />
JONES: Hang on, Japan do this every time they get into problems with unemployment. They<br />
direct the Bank of Japan to lend money..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Japan's low unemployment is a product of a completely different culture in that<br />
country, a culture of lifetime employment and it's an utterly different culture and to<br />
suggest that you can just pick one...<br />
JONES: Prime Minister, that's what they do. They direct the Bank of Japan to lend money at<br />
an affordable rate, they do it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Alan, the reason why unemployment in Japan is much lower than Australia is that<br />
Japan has a different culture from this country and to suggest that you can transplant<br />
that culture holus bolus and graft it onto a different society, that just doesn't work.<br />
JONES: </p>
<p>So in other words we just can't send someone up to Japan, arguably the most<br />
successful economy in the world and say, how is it that they can lend money to<br />
business and one and a half and two percent"<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Alan, to be fair, that wasn't the point I was making. What I am saying and what I<br />
know to be a fact is that the principle reason why unemployment is much lower in<br />
Japan than in Australia is that companies in Japan have a culture of lifetime<br />
employment and they never had it in this country. Now there are many features of the<br />
Japanese economy I would like to see adopted in this country but to suggest that over<br />
night you can transplant a there are a lot of things about Japanese society I admire.<br />
There are also a lot of things about Japanese society that I wouldn't like to come here.<br />
It's not as free and open a society, it's not as equal a society as Australia is.<br />
JONES: How can you argue then that Japanese business are paying one and a half and two and<br />
a half percent for their money and our blokes here are paying twelve and a half and<br />
thirteen yet we still expect our business to compete with Japan.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
One of the reasons that we are paying much higher, real interest rates in this country is<br />
that over the years we've run a huge budget deficits and when you run up huge budget<br />
deficits, people who lend you money from abroad charge a premium and that's one of<br />
the reasons why Peter Costello and I are cutting the budget deficit. We get criticised<br />
for being bean counters, we get criticised for being obsessed with the bottom line but if<br />
the bottom line hadn't been so bad for so long small business men in this country<br />
wouldn't be paying high interest rates. Now that is an economic fact, it's an<br />
unavoidable fact of life and in the long run, if you want to get interest rates down you<br />
get rid of budget deficits. People who criticise the removal of budget deficits are really<br />
arguing for much higher interest rates.<br />
JONES: ) 4 000 full time jobs were lost in this country in April, that's the last month. Banks are<br />
getting rid of them, Telstra is getting rid of them, BHP is getting rid of them, Jeff<br />
Kennett's public service are getting rid of them. Well there's an outfit, a text called<br />
Divided Nation, put together by not a ratbag outfit but the Institute of Public Affairs<br />
and the Melbourne University Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research and<br />
they are saying this unless fundamental policy changes are made speedily, the<br />
proportion of Australians in work could be reduced to 80% leaving 20% or one in five<br />
to be poor outsiders. What policy changes are going to be made urgently to provide<br />
jobs for that 20% that could be unemployed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the first thing you've got to do is you've got to get the economy right. Now<br />
that's the first thing you've got to do and that means balancing the budget, dull though<br />
that sounds but it does mean that because if you don't have a balanced budget in times<br />
of reasonably high economically growth you will go hopelessly into the red when<br />
there's a slow down. So that's the first thing you've got to do. Now I know that<br />
sounds unexciting and I know you can take pot shots at it and say we're obsessed with<br />
the bottom line but unless you get the budget right you can't get anything right. Now<br />
that's the first thing and every household in Australia knows that. The second thing<br />
you've got to do is you've got to keep inflation down and you've got to try and get<br />
interest rates down. Now we are doing both of those things. The third thing you've </p>
<p>got to do is fix the industrial relations system and we have begun the job of doing that,<br />
and the fourth thing you've got to do is to remove all of the other impediments to<br />
economic growth by having much greater competition and we're in the process of<br />
doing that.<br />
JONES: So you won't create a small business bank to lend money..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, I don't think creating a special small business bank quite frankly is going to..<br />
JONES: That's what the Commonwealth Bank was for.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No the Commonwealth Bank had a more..<br />
JONES: The Commonwealth Bank was... so was the Rural Bank.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The Commonwealth Bank was formed in 1912 to provide a Government alternative<br />
savings.. JONES: 1% to build railway lines and all the rest of it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But everybody charged 1% in those days.<br />
JONES: Do you think your Government is in touch or out of touch with the people?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think on most issues very in touch and I know quite, Alan, look I know... what<br />
happened was this You had 13 years of another Government. We get elected to<br />
power with a very big majority. There are very high expectations. I knew that we<br />
would enter this period. I knew when we were elected that for the first year or so<br />
there would be a honeymoon period and then after a while because there hadn't been<br />
dramatic changes, and no governments can achieve dramatic changes, change by<br />
Government is always incremental. It is never as great as people expect. It is never as<br />
great as the supporters of that government hoped for. Now we are going through a<br />
period right now that I knew that we would enter, where people would say, hang on,<br />
things haven't changed a lot, have they. They've changed a bit but we've still got<br />
reasonably high unemployment. Alan, I knew when I became Prime Minister that I<br />
couldn't get rid of unemployment in the space of a year. I can't and I'm not saying to<br />
the people now I can get rid of it over the next two years. I will be disappointed if I<br />
haven't brought it down a bit by the date of the next election.<br />
JONES: But David Kemp introduced a bill into the parliament in relation to unemployment or<br />
education and how it might help employment. That was debated for about two-and-ahalf<br />
minutes. And there was a debate on palliative care which went for 14 hours on </p>
<p>euthanasia. The Parliament got rid of the euthanasia provisions of the Northern<br />
Territory when 75% of the electorate are in favour of euthanasia. Is the dog wagging<br />
the tail. Who are you meant to be responding to?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Euthanasia was a conscience vote. I voted in favour of the anti-euthanasia bill. Now,<br />
I know that was out of step with what the polls say...<br />
JONES: It was in step with the Parliament.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No well..<br />
JONES: Well the parliament voted for it on your side..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Alan it was an individual conscience vote.<br />
JONES: parliament vote...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well so what, so what?<br />
JONES:<br />
Well, I'm saying that they are out of step. If 75% of the electorate think euthanasia<br />
is... PRIME MINISTER:<br />
in other words on every single issue what you do is you run an opinion poll before...<br />
JONES: I didn't say that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that's the implication.<br />
JONES: I'm just saying that out of step.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well one minute people are saying to me " you are poll driven". The next minute they<br />
are saying that you mustn't take a decision which is out of step with public opinion.<br />
But euthanasia was an atypical non-Party issue. It wasn't conducted on party lines. It<br />
was conducted on non-party lines and I voted against euthanasia. Now, that's a<br />
conscience view that I have. I accept that the majority of people listening to this<br />
interview didn't agree with me on that but I owe my conscience and I owe them the<br />
honesty of a personal view. If it is out of step I acknowledge it, if people don't like<br />
that, I accept it, but I can do no more than say what I believe and act according to my<br />
beliefs. If you want a Prime Minister who is going to be driven by an opinion poll on </p>
<p>every issue you get somebody other than John Howard. Get somebody else. I'm not<br />
going to conduct myself like that on any issue.<br />
JONES: Just on the previous point then about budgets and reducing costs and getting the<br />
deficit and everything down. Health care is one area where surely there is very<br />
significant waste. Where you and I today can go one hundred times to any doctor in<br />
Sydney and pay nothing for those visits. Is that a sensible way...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we're not paying nothing. We are paying a Medicare levy and in my case, I'm<br />
paying more than $ 2000 a year for private health insurance cover for my entire family<br />
and from the first of July this year the federal government will be providing a $ 600<br />
million tax incentive. Now this is the unreformed tax system that we were talking<br />
about a few minutes ago. We will be paying $ 600 million to your listeners who have<br />
private health insurance to subsidise the purchase of that private health insurance.<br />
Now, we are a long way behind the 8 ball on health because we inherited after 13 years<br />
a health system where the former government in defiance incidentally of Graham<br />
Richardson's advice had deliberately run down private health insurance. The former<br />
Labor government sabotaged, stabbed in the back private health insurance in this<br />
country. It was s61% when they came into power. It was 35% of the population<br />
when they left office and if something had been done five years ago, then we wouldn't<br />
now have this drain on public hospitals.<br />
JONES: But a government in trouble. Can a government in trouble, can't find money, has<br />
never got enough money, the public are always wanting money. Is bulk-billing a<br />
legitimate policy initiative?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The community, particularly the poorer section of the community needs bulk-billing.<br />
JONES: You're not poll driven you just told me?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I'm making a social value judgment.<br />
JONES: But you must know the community want that because of a poll.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No no no. I think it is right to provide to poor people in the community the sort of<br />
support that bulk-billing affords.<br />
JONES: The community were in favour of euthanasia too. The community...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, that is a social judgment Alan. I'm making a social judgment that it is fair to<br />
have...<br />
JONES: </p>
<p>So you are in favour of bulk-billing because the community are in favour of it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, I'm in favour of bulk-billing because it is fair for the poor in the community.<br />
That's why I'm in favour of it.<br />
JONES: Means test it. Make sure that the people who aren't poor don't get bulk-billing, can't<br />
use bulk-billing.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, that's an alternative, it's not part of our policy and I'm certainly not suggesting<br />
that we are going to do it.<br />
JONES: Okay I've got a young man here on our staff who's married and whose wife has just<br />
had a baby and they investigated yesterday the health care reforms in relation to<br />
incentives to take out private health insurance. They are going to be entitled to the full<br />
$ 450 rebate incentive. The only problem is his private health insurance premiums have<br />
increased by more than that. So there's no benefit to him.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, he's a lot better off than if he weren't getting a tax subsidy because those health<br />
insurance premiums would still have increased, so he's $ 450 a year better off You're<br />
not seriously arguing that if we hadn't promised the tax subsidy the premiums still<br />
wouldn't have gone up. I mean, the premiums... I'll tell you what..<br />
JONES: I'm just wondering whether the private health insurance isn't using the tax subsidy as<br />
an opportunity to..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Can I tell you why private health insurance premiums have gone up. They've gone up<br />
because more and more people have drifted out of private health insurance. It<br />
becomes a self perpetuating process. The more people who drop out the worse it<br />
becomes, they have to put their premiums up and if you increase the premiums you<br />
force more people out. Now something should have been done to staunch the flow of<br />
blood, pardon the analogy, a few years ago but it wasn't. Now, at long last you've got<br />
a got a government that recognises that people need tax incentives for private health<br />
insurance and they are going to start on the first of July. Now, it is five minutes to<br />
midnight on private health insurance but at least we are trying to do something about<br />
it, and I would say to the young man in your office, he's still going to be $ 450 bucks a<br />
year better off under the Howard government. If it hadn't been for us, he'd have been<br />
$ 450 a year worse off and he might in fact be facing the possibility of having to drop<br />
private health insurance. And I know lots of people in that situation who can no<br />
longer afford it. I mean, I understand why. I mean it's more than $ 2000 a year. It's<br />
very expensive.<br />
JONES: Just one final thing. You've had a tough innings here.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I always do. </p>
<p>JONES: You always do. I asked a question about Newcastle just finally. BHP, the big<br />
Australian, there's 2300 people up there looking as though they are out of work. Do<br />
you call the board or the chairman in and say 523 2look this is a bit rich. You've taken<br />
profits out of the joint for 82 years, now when the going gets a little bit tough you are<br />
going to knock the workers off Do you actually read a riot act to these people? I<br />
mean, is that something that you support, or does business just take all the good times<br />
and then ditch the workers when the bad times come?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I've had two discussions with the Managing Director of BHP about this issue.<br />
The first one was some months ago when he said they wouldn't be able to continue<br />
steel making in Newcastle indefinitely and he gave me a lot of reasons as to why that<br />
was the case. Governments only have taxpayers' money. If I say to the Managing<br />
Director of BHP, well, you know, I want you to invest over there and not where you<br />
decide to invest, I'm in effect appropriating the money of his shareholders in saying<br />
where it should be spent. And I don't think anybody suggests that a government<br />
should do that. The second thing, I saw him the other night. I have to say that I was<br />
disappointed and I express my strong disappointment that I was not told about the<br />
precise timing of the announcement until the day before the announcement was made.<br />
And I made it very plain to him then and I make it plain to you this morning, I think<br />
that is unacceptable that companies have obligations, particularly companies of that<br />
size, to keep governments informed. I mean, if we had known precisely when they<br />
were going to make the announcement, it wouldn't have meant that I could have told<br />
him not to make the announcement because I don't own BHIP, BHP's owned by the<br />
shareholders...<br />
JONES: But if you've got the best iron ore mines in the world and some of the best coal mines<br />
in the world, and you can't make competitors steel, isn't there something wrong with<br />
the way the joint is run?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yeah, well of course the argument that BH-P have is that the steel making process,<br />
which is now operating in Newcastle, is an outdated steel making process and that<br />
modern technology means that it is no longer profitable for the company to maintain<br />
that type of steel making in Newcastle. Now, that is a technical commercial<br />
judgement. If it can be demonstrated that in a technical commercial sense that is<br />
utterly wrong then fine. But I mean, I don't own BHP. BHP is owned by the<br />
shareholders. It's owned by your listeners. And if you get to a situation where Prime<br />
Ministers are saying to companies...<br />
JONES: Not my listeners at $ 18.50 a share, I can assure you...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, hang on, if they have superannuation...<br />
JONES: They don't know that, they don't know where the super's going.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well, a lot of it goes into BHP.<br />
JONES: They don't know that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it's true. And when you, you know, when people talk glibly about BHP shares<br />
and so forth just remember that most of the superannuation funds of this country that<br />
have the superannuation contributions of your listeners have shares in companies like<br />
BH-P. So it ill-behoves John Howard to sort of say well, look, I'll set myself up as the<br />
supreme economic tsar of Australia and I will say you should invest there but not over<br />
there. A lot of the share holders would get pretty unhappy pretty quickly.<br />
JONES: Okay, well I said that was the last but I will come back to a point I raised before<br />
because I just must ask you this question again. Foreign ownership in this country is at<br />
enormous levels. It's stretching our credibility surely that believe that all thee people,<br />
foreign companies, are so poor that they actually have to borrow for that investment.<br />
In other words, everyone is so much in debt that they stack up the levels of debt to the<br />
extent that the interest on their debt is $ 30 billion a year and that's the level of interest<br />
deduction. Do you think they're taking us for a ride? Do you think that there are<br />
foreign companies investing in here with a strategy that says load up the investment<br />
with debt so that we get a tax concession for the interest on our debt and therefore we<br />
won't have to pay tax on profits?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't think any companies invest in this country to sort of do us a favour, I'm not<br />
that stupid, any more than there are a lot of Australian companies that do things to do<br />
particular favours for people either. But if you're suggesting...<br />
JONES: ( Inaudible)... provide jobs for Australia.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, a lot of foreign companies provide jobs for Australia..<br />
JONES: ( Inaudible)., profits they... ( Inaudible)...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I know, yes, but I mean, you can't avoid the fact Alan, if you are Mitsubishi<br />
Motors, for example, in South Australia, which is a foreign country..<br />
JONES: The Prime Minister of Japan ( inaudible) gave you a lesson on tariffs did he?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No he didn't actually. </p>
<p>JONES: I thought he did.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well he didn't, because I was there. He didn't. All he said was that it was a matter for<br />
the Australian Government to decide.<br />
JONES: He said that Prime Minister but:-I'd like you to realise that this tariff regime will affect<br />
my two companies.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, he also said that he believed in trade liberalisation. He was having, if I may say<br />
so, both sides of the argument and I don't blame him.<br />
JONES: Something that oppositions never do.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it depends, it depends. You've got responsibilities. Because often there are<br />
many sides of the argument.<br />
JONES: Absolutely. Prime Minister, thank you for your time. Have some breakfast, you've<br />
earned one. </p>
