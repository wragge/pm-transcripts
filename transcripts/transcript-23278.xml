    <content><![CDATA[<p>Finance ministers from the worldâs biggest economies have just been meeting in Sydney.</p>
<p>Australia is the chair of the G20 this year â and the finance ministers have been working on how to encourage growth and jobs right around the world.</p>
<p>These G20 finance ministers represent 85 per cent of the world economy and 75 per cent of total world trade.Â  Their focus has been on freeing up funding for new and better infrastructure right around the world.</p>
<p>This G20 aims to be so much more than a talkfest.Â  Our aim is to make a real difference to the lives of families and small business people around Australia and indeed around the wider world.</p>
<p>Creating more job opportunities and helping families with cost of living pressures is at the heart of our economic plan and itâs at the heart of our message to world leaders.</p>
<p>Scrapping bad taxes like the carbon tax and the mining tax, cutting red tape, improving productivity and opening up export markets with Free Trade Agreements will be good for Australia.</p>
<p>Indeed lower taxes, less regulation and freer trade will help all countries to boost their growth and help their people.</p>
<p>Now, soon there will be a special Senate election in Western Australia.Â  It will be an election to give the people of Western Australia a vote for a strong team that will stand up for West Australians.</p>
<p>The West Australian Liberals have proven that they are always prepared to stand up for their state.</p>
<p>Western Australia has carried the rest of the country through tough economic times and itâs now time we got rid of anti-Western Australia taxes like the carbon and the mining tax.Â  So, at this coming election, Western Australians have a chance to make this happen and to tell the Senate to get on with the job.</p>
