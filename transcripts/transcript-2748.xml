r( 7 PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEIENT NO. 16<br />
14 December 1972<br />
ABORIGINAL EDUCATION ASSISTANCE<br />
The Federal Government will launch a campaign to have<br />
aboriginal children living in distinctive aboriginal communities<br />
given their primary education in aboriginal languages.<br />
The Government will also supplement education for<br />
aboriginal children with the teaching of traditional aboriginal<br />
arts, crafts and skills mostly by aborigines themselves.<br />
The Government will assist in the training of teachers<br />
and teacher aides some of them aborigines in help with the<br />
introduction of language teaching in primary schools.<br />
Planning of the projects is already taking place within<br />
the Office of Aboriginal Affairs.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. WÂ¾ hitlam, announced the moves today<br />
after consultations with the nominated Minister for Education,<br />
Mr. K. E. Beazley, and Dr. II. C. Coombs.<br />
Ir. Whitlam said the Government felt a need for greater<br />
respect for aboriginal languages and culture. The tribal<br />
cultures should be preserved, not crushed, he said.<br />
Mr. ! Whitlam said in introducing the programs the<br />
Government was implementing conventions of both the I. L. O. and<br />
U. N. E. S. C. O. which encouraged the teaching of indigenous people<br />
in their own languages.<br />
In primary schools in aboriginal communities English<br />
will be taught as a second language.<br />
Among the traditional and cultural skills which will be<br />
taught aboriginal children will be art, carving, music, dancing,<br />
tracking, traditional religion and mythology.,<br />
When the program is fully implemented it will affect most<br />
aboriginal children in the Northern Territory and will be extended<br />
to tribal areas of northern Queensland, the Kimberleys in<br />
Western Australia and northern South Australia.<br />
