    <content><![CDATA[<p>It was with shock and sadness that I learnt of the sudden passing of Don Randall, the Federal Member for Canning.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government and the Liberal Party, I convey my condolences and deepest sympathies to Donâs wife Julie and their two children.</p>
<p>Don was an outstanding local member. He was a passionate and persuasive advocate in Canberra and a hardworking community leader in Western Australia.</p>
<p>He was first elected to the House of Representatives as the local member for Swan in 1996. He was elected as the local member for Canning in 2001 and re-elected in 2004, 2007, 2010 and 2013.</p>
<p>Don made a fine contribution to the Howard Government and particularly to the Coalition during our years in opposition.</p>
<p>He was a mentor to many and integral to the success of our Party in the state of Western Australia.</p>
<p>He served the Party for many years prior to his election to Parliament including on the state executive.</p>
<p>Itâs hard to credit that this strong voice for Western Australia and servant of our Party has left us so soon.</p>
<p>All his colleagues will mourn his passing and honour the contribution that he has made.</p>
