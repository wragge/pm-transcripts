TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH DALE SINCLAIR, ELECTORATE OF MAKIN, 4<br />
DECEMBER 1986..<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Duff y has been saying that he believed media<br />
ownership. How does that fit with Mr Murdoch taking over so much of<br />
the popular press?<br />
M: The legislation that we will be bringing in will do more than has<br />
ver been done in this country to ensure that there is diversification<br />
within areas. What is important is that there be no monopoly of the<br />
total media. For the first time, we will bring in a cross-media<br />
limitation so that in no region will one person or group be able to<br />
monopolise the television, radio and print. And I believe that will be<br />
a good thing.<br />
JOURNALIST: But within the popular press. here in Adelaide and in<br />
Brisbane you will have Mr Murdoch owning the only print media we have.<br />
PM: We will see what happens. Mr Murdoch has yet to make decisions as<br />
to what he will divest. And he has made it clear, he has got to think<br />
about what he will, do. We will wait and see.<br />
JOURNALIST: You understand concern though of people like the PKIU who<br />
believe that up to a third of their membership is threatened in<br />
Adelaide alone?<br />
I'M: I don't know whether a third of their membership is threatened. I<br />
.) ntsay that and it is just hypothetical at this stage to say because<br />
we don't know what decisions Mr Murdoch will make. He has now acquired<br />
or in the process of acquiring a vast range of media in the three<br />
mediums. And he is going to have to make decisions both in accordance<br />
with the legal requirements and in accordance with commercial<br />
considerations. So I am not pre-judging what the outcome will be<br />
because no-one, including the PKIU, knows.<br />
JOURNALIST: Even before any final decisions are made there is a<br />
certain percentage of the Labor Party who are as mad as hell that Mr<br />
Murdoch is likely to have any sort of monopoly in South Australia<br />
because he, in the past, has turned against Labor. And they blamed him<br />
for the loss of the 1979 election.<br />
PM: I see. Of course, I suppose they say we have got a magnificent go<br />
from the Advertiser in the past they will be sorry to see that<br />
influence, I know they have been enormous supporters of the Labor<br />
Party, as has the West Australian in Perth. and the Herald in Melbourne.<br />
We just give prayers of thanksgiving every night for the enormous<br />
support we have received from those newspapers in the past.<br />
