FOR PRESS PM No. 70/ 1970<br />
BARRIER REEF ENQUIRY: ASSISTANCE<br />
WITH LEGAL COSTS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
The Commonwealth will meet the reasonable legal<br />
costs, including Counsels' fees, of five conservationist bodies<br />
appearing before the Royal Commission on Barrier Reef Petroleum<br />
Drilling. Requests for financial assistance fur full-time<br />
legal representation were received from the Australian Conservation<br />
Foundation and four Queensland scientific or conservationist<br />
organisations; The Great Barrier Reef Committee, the Queensland<br />
Littoral Society, the Save the Barrier Reef Committee and the Wild<br />
Life Preservation Society of Queensland.<br />
Earlier, 35 members of the Queensland Bar had<br />
offered their services gratuitously to assist the conservationists<br />
in presenting their evidence. This would have resulted in each<br />
set of counsel appearing for one week at a time, a course which would<br />
have presented obvious difficulties.<br />
