    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the very first nomination that I'll be putting forward on behalf of the Government is Anzac Cove at Gallipoli.  It seems overwhelmingly the appropriate first choice for listing on the National Heritage List.  I think that will draw the support of all Australians.  It has a special unquestioned place in the history and the hearts of all Australians.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does it matter that it's not Australian soil?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think that matters. I think anybody who goes to Gallipoli feels immediately they arrive that the soil there is as much part of Australia as the earth on which their home is built.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>....Turkish Government permission...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have no doubt that the Turkish Government will give permission.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Has the Government been in contact with the Turkish Government?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have had some preliminary contact, yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you encourage all Australians to come forward with ...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I do.  I think one of the great virtues of the new approach is that we are asking people to put forward ideas.  It's always good to do that so everybody feels some ownership of the process.  The national heritage of a country is not something that belongs to the government of the day, it belongs to all of the people of our country and my fellow Australians have as much stake and as great a role in this as I do.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>... well, that's good and nobody has a monopoly on wisdom and understanding of these things.  And it's essential that everybody feel that our history and our heritage, whether it is the built environment, whatever it may be, it's something that belongs to them and not just to a small elite group.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>...but it commits your government to caring ...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, one of the great advantages of this new legislation is that it provides a protection mechanism, in the past that hasn't been there - this does provide a protection mechanism.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How would that be enforced if you are in Turkey and something happens...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm quite sure that the understanding that we hope to reach with the Turkish authorities will ensure that happens.  But I think that's the sort of thing I must say is being a bit negative.  I don't think there are going to be any incursion on the heritage value.  There hasn't been in the past and I don't expect that in the future.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] superannuation ... are you aware of those changes?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I'm not aware of any detail.  But I should point out that a couple of years ago we made a major change which brought the entitlement age for parliamentary superannuation into line with the community standard.  Now that was initiated by us in 2001.  Now, obviously, if there are some other changes I'll wait and see what they are.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>...leaving troops in East Timor beyond May...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Our general position is that we'll keep forces in East Timor whilever it is necessary.  We made a very big investment of people, a very strong investment in terms of taking a political stand in East Timor and we don't intend to leave until we are confident that we are leaving behind a stable united country that has a strong future.  Now part of that process is for the East Timorese themselves to be confident and involved and part of our role is the training of their police and the like and there are also responsibilities for others.  So I'm not going to put any time on it expect to restate the principle that we will continue to be part of a stabilisation process in East Timor whilever it's necessary.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you know of some reports from authorities in Nauru that children have been coerced into joining a hunger strike?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm still having those reports investigated. I'm not making any claims at the moment because I don't know the results of those investigations. Thank you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>... superannuation. Can you see any other areas in politics...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think the changes that were made a couple of years ago were very significant and they're overlooked in the whole examination.  But that was a change initiated by the Government.  Thank you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you review ...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we always review things. We do that everyday.  Thank you.</p>
