PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, WOODVILLE, SA, 20 MAY 1989<br />
ZI-9PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: First of all, from what the protesters are<br />
O saying out there, the small amount of protesters<br />
PM: Very small.<br />
JOURNALIST: What are you going to do about Kakadu?<br />
PM: That's a matter that will be decided. An you know we've<br />
it's a conservation zone there and therm are<br />
investigations going on in which we're taking into account<br />
the interests of the conservationists, the Aboriginal people<br />
and the home. of the mining Inaterests and we will make a<br />
decis ion which we believe is appropriate in the<br />
circumstances. So the people out there are properly<br />
concerned, they have that conservation interest taken into<br />
aacumt and it will be and I think we're entitled, on our<br />
record in the six years of Government, to be able to claim<br />
credit f or doing more to preserve the heritage of this<br />
country than any other government's ever done before. We<br />
will properly take thee things into account. I haven't<br />
anything more to say about that because it's a matter to be<br />
S considered by Cabinet.<br />
JOURNALIST: How far away is the decision?<br />
PM: I'm not quite sure how far down the track it is but we<br />
won't be rushing the matter.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think the next election will be an<br />
environment election?<br />
PM: No it won't be just an environment election, but quite<br />
clearly environmental issues will be of considerable<br />
importance as they have been to us from our first election.<br />
You will recall, 1983, which Party was it that promised to<br />
save the Franklin, It wasn my Party. Who saved it? My Party.<br />
Who established Kakadu into the World Heritage listing? My<br />
Party# my Government. Who was it that saved the Daintree<br />
Rainforest? My Government. Who was it that saved the<br />
rainforest in Tasmania? My Government. Who was it that put </p>
<p>A. 0<br />
PM ( cant) the areas of Tasmania onto the World Heritage<br />
listing? My Government. Hasn't been a record in protection<br />
of the environment like the Hawks Labor Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: With the latest advisory committee coming out<br />
and saying that interest rates are likely to stay high well<br />
Into next year, have you totally given up hope that you had<br />
earlier in the year that they will came down?<br />
PM: I'm not saying anything predictive about interest rate.<br />
at this time because it's a delicate issue longterm<br />
forecast I was making. I don't intend to say anything now<br />
until further on into the year. The fact is, as I have said<br />
and Paul Xeating has said, that we will keep monetary policy<br />
as tight-as necessary for as long as is necessary to protect<br />
the Australian economy. I mean let me say to your viewers<br />
the obvious facts. I m an intelligent politician, I don't<br />
keep interest rate. higher than necessary for one day longer<br />
than necessary. I'm not a masochist, I don't want to hurt<br />
myself. I'm not a sadist-and I don't want to hurt the<br />
Australian people but I know that with the level of activity<br />
that we ' vs got in this country, if we relax on interest rates<br />
policy at this time we'd lose the dollar and then interest<br />
rates would go through the roof and the economy would<br />
collapse. The best interests of the Australian people at<br />
this time and into the near future, demand the maintenance of<br />
tight monetary policy. Although that might be considered<br />
politically dangerous by some commentators, I'll do it<br />
because it a necessary in the beet interests of this<br />
country. JOURNALIST: Therefore how tied are interest rates in your<br />
election strategy?<br />
PM: I haven't got an election strategy. I mean the only<br />
person who's talked about elections is the fellow who was<br />
Leader of the Liberal Party. I keep making the point that<br />
here we are, less than two years away from the last election,<br />
I've never mentioned early election., John Howard did because<br />
he was worried about the impact of the cuts in interest<br />
rates, cuts in taxes I mean, that we had promised twelve<br />
months before and which was brought in and to try and<br />
divert attention from that he started talking about an early<br />
election. He was also a bit worried about his own scalp,<br />
well he couldn't save that and I'm not'in an election mode<br />
consideration. It's got nothing to do with it.<br />
JOURNALIST: So why the three day trip to Adelaide?<br />
FM: Well I ' spose on that basis, any trip I do immediately<br />
after an election is electioneering. I sean, I can't, after<br />
an election# go to any electorate for what period? Until<br />
the next election is announced? I mean, I don't mean to be<br />
rude to your but that's stupidity. I am the most travelled<br />
Prime Minister I think in the history of this country. </p>
<p>PN ( cant) I like travelling around the electorate, I do it<br />
consistently and I do it from soon after elections. I man<br />
don't read any early election by the fact that I'm here with<br />
Rod Savford, who is making Port Adelaide safe for democracy.<br />
JOURNALIST: You mentioned briefly the ructions in the<br />
Liberal Party. Do you think Ian McLachlan will be a help or<br />
a hindrance in that area?<br />
PM: He'll be a great hindrance to Fred Chaney's ambitions.<br />
They tell &amp;@-Fred's been taking a few headache powders over<br />
the last 24 hour., as well he might, because Mr Chaney of<br />
course engaged in the chicanery and deception against Mr<br />
Howard on the basis that they were going to lose the next<br />
election. Mr Peacock, the interim leader, he's going to take<br />
over. Now I think that the Liberals will be looking at Xr<br />
McLachlan, that is if he beets Mr Porter. I man Mr Porter<br />
has been there for such a long time you'd think he'd have his<br />
preselection safe, but if he's not and Mr McLachlan gets in,<br />
I think the person in the federal Parliament who's worried<br />
most about that is Fred Chaney.<br />
end. </p>
