CHIFLEY MEMORIAL LECTURE, DELIVERED BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE<br />
14 AUGUST 1975<br />
As the fourth Chifley Memorial lecturer in 1957 I said:<br />
" The way of the reformer is hard in Australia." I<br />
intended neither pessimism nor prophecy, although one may<br />
concede that little has occurred in the intervening 18 years<br />
or the last two and a half years to lead to the belief that<br />
reform in Australia is altogether a primrose path. In my 1957<br />
lecture I attempted to point up the difficulties confronting<br />
the Australian Labor Party in carrying out its policies under<br />
a federal system and in particular the impediments which the<br />
Australian Constitution placed in the way of achieving reform.<br />
This was no exercise in negativism, in finding excuses.<br />
You will accept that that has never been my way. I was however<br />
concerned then by the way in which the Labor Party's failure<br />
to move on, to look ahead, to attempt to find new ways towards<br />
reform was shortchanging the Australian people and shortchanging<br />
the Party itself. In 1957, the Platform, policies and structure<br />
of the Australian Labor Party had remained basically unchanged<br />
since the days of the Chifley Government, already by then<br />
8 years distant. Even in 1957, the Party still tended to interpret<br />
the 1949 election result as an aberration, much as the Liberals<br />
today still see 1972 as an aberration. The Party became<br />
obsessed with the idea that rather than being about renewal for<br />
the future, its purpose was to return to a more comfortable past<br />
not renovation but mere restoration. As a result, both the<br />
achievements of the past and the hopes for the future receded<br />
equ~ ally . The Party stagnated and the Platform was stultified.<br />
For his heirs, the setbacks which Chifley had met<br />
became not an experience for building but an excuse for baulking.<br />
At best we learnt only half the lesson of the Chifley experience.<br />
We acknowledged that we could not nationalise the banks or indeed<br />
any important part of the economic system, but our rhetoric remained<br />
unchanged the rhetoric both in the Platform and from our<br />
platform speakers. In at least one policy speech the acknowledgement<br />
of the Constitutional impossibility of nationalisation was<br />
presented as if it were a positive undertaking impotence was<br />
to be a guarantee of future good behaviour. The acknowledgement<br />
became an alibi an alibi for the Party's failure to develop new<br />
policies, to work out new programs whereby the basic ends<br />
envisaged by Chifley could be achieved by other means.<br />
In 1956 I had been elected a member of the Joint<br />
Committee on Constitutional Review. By virtue of that experience,<br />
I became better acquainted and more preoccupied with the<br />
difficulties and barriers raised by the Constitution against not<br />
only reform but good government in Australia. With one exception<br />
national responsibility for Aborigines the Constitution remains<br />
unchanged, despite the unanimous all-Party recommendations of the<br />
Committee in 1958 and 1959. These unanimous recommendations covered<br />
a wide range of matters, particularly in the fields of economic<br />
management and electoral reform. All-Party acceptance in 1959<br />
has become partisan resistance whenever the opportunity to<br />
implement these recommendations has arisen. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
For example, it is often forgotten that all Parties,<br />
the Country Party as much as the Liberal Party, accepted the<br />
recommendation of the Committee that the enrolment in any<br />
electorate should not vary by more than 10 per cent from the<br />
average enrolment in all electorates within a State. As a<br />
result of the Joint Sitting last year, that all-Party<br />
recommendation is now the law of the land. But partisan<br />
resistance has nullified that law. The redistribution proposals<br />
by which alone the recommendation of the Committee of 1959 and<br />
the legislation of the whole Australian Parliament in 1974 could<br />
be made a reality have been rejected by the Senate.<br />
Yet despite the lack of Constitutional amendment, there<br />
has been Constitutional advance not by amendment at referendums,<br />
but by interpretation in the High Court. The High Court, in<br />
such matters as monopolies and restrictive trade practices, civil<br />
aviation and television, has widened the powers of the national<br />
Parliament in ways which, in my 1957 lecture, I looked for<br />
through Constitutional amendment.<br />
The chief purpose of my 1957 Chifley lecture was<br />
therefore to examine not just the barriers against Labor reform<br />
put up by the Constitution but the means by which these reforms<br />
could be achieved within the Constitution. I put the view that,<br />
while amendment of the Constitution must remain a fundamental<br />
objective, neither the Party nor the nation should be expected<br />
to wait indefinitely for amendment before reform. It was not<br />
a question of trying to circumvent the Constitution, but to<br />
make the best use of it, not supinely to accept the limitations<br />
of powers imposed by the Constitution, but to use the powers<br />
offered by it. For example I said:<br />
" In our obsession with Section 92 which is held up<br />
as the bulwark of private enterprise, we forget<br />
Section 96, which is the charter of public enterprise."<br />
I further illustrated how in the fields of social welfare, health,<br />
education, housing, transport, urban and regional development,<br />
industrial relations, restrictive trade practices and law reform,<br />
significant advances could be achieved under existing powers to<br />
a very great extent* The themes foreshadowed in that lecture<br />
became the basis for the substantial rewriting of the Platform<br />
at subsequent Federal Conferences of the Australian Labor Party,<br />
particularly the great reform Conferences of 1967, 1969, and 1971.<br />
The policies thus developed provided the framework for the 1972 policy<br />
speech and to that extent, the framework for the programs of the<br />
Australian Labor Government in the past two and a half years.<br />
My purpose in this lecture is to review those programs<br />
in terms of the basic objectives they were designed to achieve,<br />
to examine how the successes of the program may best be<br />
consolidated in the light of the economic conditions in which<br />
Australia now finds herself.<br />
It is easy enough to generalise about the need for reform.<br />
Reform, however, must be relevant to objectives which are both<br />
desirable in themselves and perceived to be desirable by the public.<br />
A reform Party needs to convince a majority of the people that the<br />
reforms it proposes are desirable and a reform Government has to<br />
keep them convinced. Quite apart from overriding questions of<br />
economic management there are always going to be four special / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
difficulties in that task. The first is the sheer problem of<br />
public perception of what has been done and why it is being donethe<br />
so-called communications problem. There may be even some<br />
Members of Parliament who might not pass an examination of the<br />
substance of the Government's programs.<br />
Secondly, there is a law of diminishing returns in<br />
politics whereby a demand once met ceases to be an issue.<br />
Thirdly, there is frequently a long delay between implementing<br />
a reform and the delivery of its actual benefits. Fourthly,<br />
a great many reforms by their very nature benefit and are<br />
expressly intended to benefit a minority in the community who,<br />
in general, are among the least articulate and least influential<br />
in the community; they are therefore the people least able to<br />
translate their grievances into political action or their<br />
gratitude into effective political support.<br />
In a sense the Party of reform in a democratic system<br />
carries a self-created handicap as a reforming Government.<br />
In Opposition, its essential task is to raise the public<br />
perception of the need for change, the need for reform. That is,<br />
its task is to raise expectations. The nature of politics,<br />
founded as it is on human nature itself, is that there will<br />
always tend to be a gap, a shortfall, between expectations<br />
aroused and expectations met.<br />
A conservative Government survives essentially by<br />
dampening expectations and subduing hopes. Conservatism is<br />
bas ically pessimistic; reformism is basically optimistic.<br />
The great tradition which links the American and French<br />
revolutionaries of the Age of Reason with the modern Parties<br />
of social reform is the tradition of optimism about the possibility<br />
of human improvement and human progress through the means of<br />
human reason. Yet inevitably there will be failures, and the<br />
higher expectations rise, the greater the likelihood of at least<br />
temporary failure to meet them.<br />
Up to December 1972 the task of the Australian Labor<br />
Party was three-fold: first to state the reforms we proposed,<br />
secondly to state the means by which we intended to achieve<br />
those reforms, thirdly to convince a majority of the electorate<br />
that those reforms were both achievable and desirable. We<br />
achieved office because we raised expectations and convinced a<br />
sufficient majority that those expectations could be met.<br />
Yet the specific reforms we proposed were related to<br />
general goals and had to be so related if they were to be seen<br />
and accepted as part of our general mandate to govern. The<br />
meaning of the " mandate" in a Parliamentary system has been<br />
subject to critical analysis by Parliamentarians and academics<br />
for more than a century. In Australia the meaning has been<br />
especially scrutinised in the past two and a half years because<br />
of the very great emphasis my own Government has always placed<br />
on the fulfilment of the program set out in the policy speech of<br />
1972 and confirmed in the policy speech of 1974. Another reason<br />
why the meaning of the " mandate" has become significant in the<br />
current Australian political debate is because of the existence<br />
of a hostile majority in the Senate and the use to which that<br />
hostile majority has been put. So the debate about the meaning<br />
of the mandate has centred on the question of whether in 1972 / 4 </p>
<p>and again in 1974 the Australian Labor Party was given only<br />
a general mandate to govern or a specific mandate to implement<br />
each part of its program.<br />
Is the mandate merely general or is it specific? Is it<br />
a grant of permission to preside or a command to perform? our<br />
opponents naturally interpret it in the weakest sense as a<br />
general and highly qualified mandate to govern on their terms<br />
and indeed by their grace and favour. I interpret the mandate<br />
as being both general and specific a general mandate to govern<br />
for the term for which we were elected and a specific mandate<br />
to implement the undertakings we made, within that term. But even<br />
when I speak of a general mandate I cannot accept the conservative<br />
definition of a mere mandate to govern, a permit to preside over<br />
the administration of government and, hopefully, to administer<br />
the existing system in a sufficiently acceptable way to give<br />
reasonable prospects of re-election for a further renewal of<br />
the mere mandate to preside. The mandate as I interpret it is<br />
to move by specific programs toward the general goals and the<br />
general objectives accepted by the people at the elections.<br />
What was that goal? I defined it in these words in the<br />
Parliament on 5 March 1970:<br />
" on this side we believe there is one clear goal that<br />
this national Parliament should set for itself, which should<br />
define and motivate each specific action we take. It is the goal<br />
of equality. The true quality of our national life will be<br />
principally determined by the way in which and the rate at which<br />
we advance towards true equality. It is this that gives meaning<br />
to our possession of prosperity. If I interpret the history of<br />
this country and the character of our countrymen and women<br />
correctly, it is this search which alone can give any worthwhile,<br />
enduring meaning to our fortuitous possession of this most<br />
fortunate, peaceful and privileged continent in this most turbulent<br />
and deprived region of the world."<br />
I regard the thrust towards equality as the natural<br />
extension of the great thrust of the Chifley Government which<br />
was towards security for all. There is no phrase more quoted<br />
than Chifley's " light on the hill'. Very few remember what the<br />
metaphor meant. As Chifley used it it was not-just a fine phrase<br />
but a quite specific objective it was security. As Chifley<br />
said in the policy speech of 1949:<br />
" it is the duty and responsibility of the community<br />
and particularly those more fortunately placed, to<br />
see that our less fortunate fellow-citizens are<br />
protected from those shafts of fate which leave<br />
them helpless and without hope. That is the<br />
objective for which we are striving. It is the<br />
beacon, the light on the hill to which our eyes<br />
are always turned and to which our efforts are<br />
always directed."<br />
In other words Chifley saw that the fundamental duty of the<br />
community, acting as a whole through its elected representatives,<br />
was to provide security for all its members. To that I add the<br />
basic objective of promoting the basic goal of equality. As I<br />
see it, the two goals are inseparable. I have always put the<br />
search for equality in positive terms, that is, the promotion of<br />
equality, not the imposition of equality. As I implied in my </p>
<p>1957 Chifley lecture and specified some years later in my<br />
Curtin Memorial lecture of 1961:<br />
" Socialists are now more concerned with the creation<br />
of opportunities than the imposition of restraints.<br />
Within Australia we do not have to ration security<br />
but to plan abundance."<br />
I state the underlying philosophy in this way: in<br />
modern communities, even the wealthiest family cannot provide<br />
its members with the best education, with the best medical<br />
treatment, the best environment, unaided by the community.<br />
Increasingly, the basic services and opportunities which determine<br />
the real standard of life of a family or an individual can only<br />
be provided by the community and only to the extent to which<br />
the community is willing to provide them. Either the community<br />
provides them or they will not be provided at all. In the<br />
Australian context, this means that the community, through the<br />
national government, must finance them or they will not be<br />
financed at all.<br />
over the span of years the common factor which links<br />
the doctrine of security and the doctrine of<br />
equality is the insistence upon community responsibility for<br />
the promotion of these twin goals.<br />
This concept of equality what I call positive equalitydoes<br />
not have as its goal equality of personal income. Its goal<br />
is greater equality of the services which the community provides.<br />
This approach not merely accepts the pluralistic nature of our<br />
system, with the private sector continuing to play the greater<br />
part in providing employment and growth; it positively requires<br />
private affluence to prevent public squalor. The approach is<br />
based on this concept: increasingly a citizen's real standard<br />
of living, the health of himself and his family, his children's<br />
opportunity for education and self-improvement, his access to<br />
employment opportunities, his ability to enjoy the nation'ss<br />
resources for recreation and cultural activity, his ability to<br />
participate in the decisions and actions of the community, are<br />
determined not so much by his income but by the availability<br />
and accessibility of the services which the community alone can<br />
provide and ensure.<br />
The quality of life depends less on the things which<br />
individuals obtain for themselves and can purchase for themselves<br />
from their personal incomes and depends more on the things which the<br />
community -provides for all its members from the combined resources of<br />
the community. What we aim at is the achievement of the classic liberal<br />
idea of the career open to the talents equality of opportunity<br />
in a vastly expanded form. Equality of opportunity is a splendid<br />
ideal; but to confine it to equality of job opportunities is not<br />
merely to restrict it, but to negate true equality of opportunity.<br />
The older, narrower ideal of equality of opportunity concentrated<br />
almost exclusively on education. The assumption was that the mere<br />
provision of free education would guarantee equality of opportunity.<br />
Even in a community as homegeneous and socially mobile as<br />
Australia this has proved not to be the case. / 6 </p>
<p>In modern communities, not least Australia, opportunities,<br />
social, economic and cultural opportunities are really determined<br />
by where a family lives, even more than by a family's income. So<br />
we have no preoccupation with equality of incomes. We are striving<br />
for an equality of environment in the total sense of those things<br />
which increasingly the community alone can provide welfare,<br />
health, education, recreation, transport.<br />
The general argument against this concept turns on the<br />
question of private incentive and individual initiative. This<br />
really gets to the heart of the philosophical differences between<br />
the Labor Party and its opponents. The argument that collective<br />
welfare destroys private incentive is a very old one indeed.<br />
It is the argument which has been used to resist every advance<br />
in social welfare, even the most basic ones, such as the provision<br />
of old-age pensions. It was the argument used at every stage of<br />
the very massive expansion of the social security system under<br />
Curtin and Chifley represented in money terms by an increase<br />
from $ 36 million provided before the war to $ 200 million in 1949.<br />
Such were the colossal sums which Chifley used in those days<br />
to undermine free enterprise and destroy individual incentive.<br />
The argument is in fact based on a particular view about<br />
human nature and human motives. In the final analysis it<br />
predicates fear and greed as being the principal spurs to human<br />
action. It says in effect that if people know they are guaranteed<br />
an income in retirement they will be both lazy and improvident during<br />
their earning days; if people are not afraid of the price of<br />
sickness they will abuse and overuse the health services the<br />
community provides; if public schools are made as good as<br />
private schools then parents will not work so hard to earn the<br />
fees for their children's eductional; if the attempt is made to<br />
make underprivileged communities more decent places to live,<br />
people will lose the competitive urge.<br />
we are going to hear a lot more of these arguments,<br />
put in perhaps more subtle ways. The counterargument is that<br />
the removal or reduction of basic fears and insecurities, far<br />
from being a limitation on individual incentive, represents a<br />
liberation for human creativity. The contest between the two<br />
opposing views of human nature and human society is still the<br />
esseace of the philosophical debate between the Parties to<br />
the extent that the political debate is conducted in terms of<br />
philosophy and to the extent to which either Party can be said<br />
to have a philosophy.<br />
The programs developed between 1967 and 1971 and presented<br />
in the policy speech of 1972 sought to give practical application<br />
to these attitudes. A political program, particularly a program<br />
for a democratic election is of course not an essay in philosophy.<br />
Policies are not developed in a political or economic vacuum;<br />
still less are they implemented in a vacuum once the appeal to the<br />
electorate has been successful. The program as presented in 1972<br />
had to be related to economic and political realities as we<br />
judged them to be in 1972 and as we assumed, to the best of our<br />
judgement, they would exist during the three years for which we<br />
sought and won a mandate. Carrying out the program has to be<br />
related to the political and economic realities as they exist.<br />
In 1972, we made two important assumptions which seemed very<br />
reasonable at the time. One was political; the other was economic.<br />
Both proved partly wrong. The first, the political assumpetion<br />
was that if elected we would have a clear three years to fulfil<br />
the program. / 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
The second, the economic assumption was that domestic<br />
growth would be sufficiently restored and that the world economy<br />
would remain strong enough to permit an avowedly expansive and<br />
expensive program of social reform to be implemented without<br />
massive tax increases or without massive inflation.<br />
The fundamental and continuing difficulty of the<br />
Government has been and remains to reconcile the demands of the<br />
program with the falsification of two of the key assumptions on<br />
which it was based.<br />
It is hard to estimate and hard to exaggerate the damage<br />
done to the Australian political system and the Australian economy<br />
by the conduct of the majority in the Senate. From the beginning,<br />
that conduct has had one overriding objective to deny the<br />
very legitimacy of the Labor Government. But its real effect<br />
has been to cast doubt on the legitimacy of an elected Government<br />
itself, to cast doubts on the legitimacy of the electoral and<br />
constitutional proceses.<br />
One has to bear in mind that the elections of 1972 were<br />
for the House of Representatives alone. The program was drawn<br />
up as a 3-year program. Whatever the result of the 1972 elections,<br />
the state of the Parties in the Senate had to remain unchanged;<br />
an anti-Labor majority was guaranteed until at least July 1974.<br />
So the question of who would control the Senate was<br />
never an issue in 1972. If you cast your minds back, you would<br />
agree that nobody approached the 1972 campaign with any thought<br />
other than what Australians were doing then was electing a<br />
Government for a normal three-year term. There. might have been<br />
some fleeting thought given to the possibility of the circumstances<br />
by which Labor, if successful, might be brought to the need for a<br />
double dissolution. But certainly no-one seriously considered<br />
the possibility of the House of Representatives being forced to<br />
an election by the refusal of Supply by the Senate. And no-one<br />
considered the possibility of a double dissolution triggered off by<br />
the threat of refusal of Supply by the Senate. It has been a remarkable<br />
example of the unthinkable becoming apparently quite acceptable.<br />
During the 1974 campaign I frequently quoted an article<br />
written in 1968 by Sir Robert Menzies in which he castigated Senate<br />
pretensions as " a falsification of democracy". That phrase is<br />
now very well known. What is not so well know is that what<br />
Sir Robert Menzies was condemning was not the ultimate falsificationthe<br />
refusal of Supply but the repeated rejection by the Senate<br />
of legislation passed by the House of Representatives by the<br />
majority forming the Government. I quote from Sir Robert Menzies'<br />
article in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 18 February 1968:<br />
" In Australia we practise the system of ' responsible<br />
government'. Indeed it has been judicially declared<br />
that it is embodied in our Constitution by necessary<br />
implication. In that system Ministers sit in and are<br />
responsible to Parliament; but Cabinet may be<br />
displaced by a vote of the House of Representatives<br />
( not Sir Robert's emphasis the Senate) and therefore<br />
holds office at the will of the House of Representatives...<br />
" It would be a falsification of democracy if, on any matter<br />
of Government policy approved by the House of Representatives<br />
possibly by a large majority, the Senate, representing<br />
the States and not the people, could reverse the decision." 1 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
The basis of Sir Robert's concern at that time early<br />
in 1968 is interesting and instructive. He was writing shortly<br />
after the Liberal Party had elected Senator Gorton as its leader.<br />
Sir Robert's concern was that once the Senate had made the<br />
big breakthrough in providing a Prime Minister, its ambitions<br />
and pretensions would thereby increase. He feared the Upper House<br />
might become altogether too uppity.<br />
He pointed out that the situation by which a Government<br />
in the House of Representatives lacks a majority in the Senate<br />
is frequent enough in itself to be normal. The falsification<br />
aginst which he warned was the rejection of legislation, not the<br />
refusal of Supply. He didn't deal with that question for one<br />
simple reason: it just never crossed his mind that this was a<br />
practical possibility worth arguing about.<br />
Yet the Labor Government, the Australian administration,<br />
Australian business and the Australian community have had to live<br />
with this possibility since April 1973 according to the evidence<br />
of Senator Withers, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate,<br />
who said in April 1974:<br />
" We embarked on a course some 12 months ago to<br />
bring about the House of Representatives election".<br />
That is, for all but the first few months of the Labor Government<br />
a new and gross element of instability and unpredictability has<br />
been introduced into Australian political life. No important<br />
aspect of our political or economic system has remained<br />
unaffected by it.<br />
It may be true that hanging concentrates the mind<br />
wonderfully but it is not generally regarded as good for the<br />
morale or the health.<br />
We can see in retrospect that the election campaign of<br />
1974 and its long drawn-out aftermath interrupted for more than<br />
four months the normal business of the nation and, at a critical<br />
time, diverted the attention of the planners, whether they were<br />
in Government, in administration, in finance or in business, from<br />
crucial matters relating to the economy to purely political<br />
pre-occupations. One should not think that administrators in Government<br />
can divorce themselves from the preoccupations of their political<br />
associates least of all in so political and politicised a<br />
capital as Canberra. The fact is that during political crises,<br />
decision-making in Australia virtually halts. This regularly and<br />
properly happens when there is a normal election in the normal<br />
course of events that is each three years. To make this turmoil<br />
endemic, to threaten it each six months, is thoroughly destructive<br />
of good administration and good government.<br />
The present Australian Government is the only Government<br />
since Federation and the only Government in the English-speaking<br />
world to have been placed in this situation. I confine my remarks<br />
in this context to the political consequences, the direct<br />
consequences, of the continuing threat by the Senate to refuse<br />
Supply. It's not to my present purpose to deal at length or in / 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
detail with the Senate's record of legislative obstruction the<br />
score of key bills which have failed to pass. In passing, however,<br />
I mention two aspects of that obstruction, both related to the<br />
concept of the mandate, as I see it, and the proper working of<br />
democracy, as Sir Robert Menzies saw it.<br />
The legislation rejected in the Senate was foreshadowed<br />
in 1972 and repeated in the 1974 campaign. Much of it was put<br />
as long ago as 1969. These Bills are not ring-ins. They are not<br />
to be dismissed just as Whitlam's whims. I put this proposition:<br />
if a matter is thrashed out in three campaigns and throughout the<br />
intervening years, and if the proposals which a Party has put on<br />
those matters are endorsed by sufficient Australians to result<br />
in that Party being elected, surely in the name of anything that can<br />
pass for democracy, that Party in Government is entitled to claim<br />
a mandate for such proposals. More, is not that Party obliged<br />
as a Government to try to implement such proposals? That has<br />
been the background, the basis put in 1969, in 1972, in 1974<br />
of so much of the legislation now stalled or rejected by the<br />
Senate. Reflect that Medibank itself would not now exist if<br />
the Senate had had its way. Medibank exists only because of the<br />
double dissolution of 1974 and our subsequent ability to get<br />
the legislation through at the Joint Sitting.<br />
Furthermore, for all the present pretensions of the Senate,<br />
for all the Hamlet-like approach of the Leader of the Opposition<br />
to what he will or will not do about the refusal of Supply,<br />
the fact remains that while the Government did not obtain a<br />
majority of the Senate seats in the Double Dissolution, it did<br />
obtain a majority of votes for the Senate over all the Parties<br />
then represented in the Senate a majority of 43,000 over the<br />
Liberal Party, the Country Party, the Democratic Labor Party,<br />
combined. A majority of seats in the House of Representatives;<br />
a majority of votes in the Senate is this or is it not a mandate<br />
to govern? Yet on specific legislation forming an integral part<br />
of the policy put at these elections and on its basic right to<br />
govern, the legitimacy of this Government is challenged month<br />
by month, day by day.<br />
So for most of the period of our Government we have had<br />
to live with an unprecedented political problem. Equally,<br />
there has been the problem of world-wide economic difficulties.<br />
As I said before, our program was predicated on certain assumptions<br />
about internal growth and the strength of the world economy. We<br />
had devised a program of social reform designed to catch up<br />
with a backlog, as we perceived it, created by 23 years of<br />
conservative rule. We were concerned that so wealthy a country<br />
as Australia, which had once been a pioneer and leader in social<br />
reform, should have fallen so far behind. I had stated our<br />
belief in these terms in the 1969 policy speech:<br />
" We make these assertions: firstly, that Australians<br />
should not be deprived of opportunities which citizens<br />
of every comparable country enjoy. Secondly, there is<br />
every reason why Australia, wealthy and well-endowed,<br />
in many respects incomparably so, should be giving a<br />
lead to other nations in the equality of opportunities<br />
and the quality of the opportunities we make for our<br />
own citizens and in the help we can give to others.<br />
Twenty years ago, Australia was indeed a pioneer and a<br />
leader: now we lag behind." </p>
<p>It should be remembered however that that period of<br />
conservative rule in Australia coincided with an extraordinarily<br />
protracted period of world economic growth. The world had enjoyed<br />
a virtually uninterrupted boom of twenty years. In general, a<br />
relatively high rate of growth was accompanied by a relatively low<br />
rate of inflation. Through most of that period Australia shared<br />
both these characteristics of the world economy. Although in 1972<br />
the Australian economy was already showing the signs of the twin<br />
problems of inflation and unemployment, with a poor growth rate<br />
which was subsequently to become world wide, the great<br />
catastrophes about to fall on the international economy were not<br />
foreseen. With hindsight we should perhaps have foreseen the<br />
inevitable economic consequences of the way in which the United<br />
States chose to finance the war in Vietnam. We could not, however,<br />
have foreseen the energy crisis of 1973.<br />
I know that it is now considered in some quarters to be<br />
mean-spirited, to be buck-passing, for an Australian Minister to<br />
mention international economic problems or to make international<br />
comparisons, or to explain any of our economic problems whatsoever<br />
in international terms. But these international problems remain<br />
a fact of life and, whether we like it or not, they affect our<br />
national life.<br />
When my Government was elected our aim was to finance<br />
our new programs from growth. But world-wide inflation and<br />
recession frustrated this objective. This is no mere selfjustification.<br />
The whole industrialised world is currently going<br />
through the worst peacetime inflation on record and the deepest<br />
recession since the 1930' s. Within the OECD, the membership of<br />
which includes virtually every industrialised country in the<br />
world, the average rate of inflation jumped from 3.9 per cent<br />
per annum in the decade 1962 to 1972, to 7.9 per cent in 1973<br />
and 13.4 per cent in 1974. Real Gross National Product which<br />
ros e at the rate of 5.4 per cent per annum in the decade to 1972<br />
declined slightly for the OECD countries as a whole in 1974 and is<br />
expected to show a decline of about 1.5 per cent in 1975.<br />
The OECD Economic Outlook stated on 17 July 1975:<br />
" The present recession in OECD countries is the most<br />
serious since the war. It is remarkable not only for its length<br />
and depth a third consecutive half-year of negative growth<br />
has now been recorded for the area as a whole but also for its<br />
widespread nature: virtually every OECD country grew by less<br />
than its medium-term average rate in 1974, and no economy is<br />
expected to take up slack in 1975. The margin of idle resources<br />
in the OECD area is now the largest in the post-war period, with<br />
unemployment at record levels. The forecasts presented in the<br />
December Economic Outlook, and to a greater extent those being made<br />
at that time by national authorities, proved to be too optimistic.<br />
Industrial output in the major countries fell very sharply in the<br />
last quarter of 1974 and the first quarter of this year. The extent<br />
and simultaneous nature of the decline was unlike anything recorded<br />
in the post-war period. The combined GNP of the major countries,<br />
which was thought at the time to have increased marginally in the<br />
second half of 1974, is now estimated to have fallen, at an annual<br />
rate, by over one per cent. Output was expected to continue<br />
stagnating in the first half of this year; it may in fact have<br />
fallen at an annual rate of about five per cent. The December<br />
Economic Outlook gave reasons for supposing that the balance of<br />
uncertainties attaching to the forecasts was on the downside; but<br />
the extent to which this proved to be the case is astonishing." / 11 </p>
<p>-11-<br />
There is no way in which Australia could have escaped<br />
being caught up in these disruptive world-wide economic developments.<br />
We are after all a major trading company, . so what happens to<br />
our major trading partners the United States, Japan and the<br />
United Kingdom is bound to affect us. It is estimated that in<br />
the course of the recession industrial production fell by<br />
per cent in Japan, by over 14 per cent in the United States and<br />
by over 8 per cent in the United Kingdom. Even West Germany,<br />
which has ridden out this storm better than most, suffered a fall<br />
in industrial production of over 11 per cent. What is more, these<br />
declines should be viewed against strong upward trends previously<br />
existing at least for the Japan and West Germany; on this<br />
basis the loss of potential output has been much greater than<br />
these figures imply.<br />
What is not widely recognised is that Australia has<br />
fared comparatively well among the industrialised countries during<br />
this period of economic turmoil. Our unemployment has been a<br />
great deal lower than that suffered by a number of industrialised<br />
countries; our loss of production has been less; and many<br />
industrialised countries have had much more severe inflation.<br />
Unlike most industrialised countries, we have moreover been<br />
entirely free of balance of payments problems.<br />
In spite of our economic problems the Australian employee<br />
has on balance done well over the last two years. Average<br />
minimum award rates have risen by 55 per cent and average earnings<br />
by 48 per cent while the cost of living as measured by the CPI<br />
has increased by 32 per cent. There have, therefore, been<br />
substantial real gains to wage and salary earners, supplemented<br />
by improved education, health., and other benefits by this<br />
Government. There is a widespread expectation that 1976 will see<br />
strong economic recovery across the world, accompanied by a<br />
continued slowdown in the rate of inflation. It is important that<br />
Australia should participate in both. There is a widespread view<br />
that, to the extent that inflation is not contained, the recovery<br />
may not be a sustained one. I share this view. I am convinced<br />
that we must get inflation down to an acceptable level in<br />
Australia, all the more if other countries with which we trade<br />
and compete in world markets do so.<br />
I again acknowledge the awful impropriety of my making<br />
international comparisons. I'll have to bear that cross. But<br />
despite everything let me make this assertion: while Australia<br />
shares to a greater or less extent these economic problems, while<br />
in some respects we are making a better fist of dealing with them than<br />
some other nations, we are alone in this that while dealing<br />
with very difficult, with unprecedentedly complex economic problems<br />
which all nations share, we have made significant and enduring<br />
advances in social reform, in so changing the structure of welfare<br />
in this nation as to be of permanent benefit to future generations<br />
. when the problems of the present are but a vague and distant memory.<br />
Our goal now is to consolidate the reforms instituted in<br />
the past two and a half years.<br />
The 1975-76 [ Budget which the Treasurer, iIr Hayden, will<br />
introduce into Parliament next week will be a major step towards<br />
this goal. In spite of the urgency we see in proceeding with our<br />
programs, we have decided to slow down the rate of increase in<br />
outlays this year. Let me emphasise that, contrary to a lot of<br />
ill-informed comment, we are not going to reduce expenditure, but<br />
/ 12 </p>
<p>-12-<br />
to slow down the rate of increase. Our expenditures will still<br />
increase in money terms and in real terms, but less rapidly than<br />
would otherwise have been the case.<br />
One effect should be to leave room for the private sector<br />
of the economy to expand, to play its proper role in the recovery.<br />
Another effect will be to moderate the extent to which the<br />
Australian Government's budget generates monetary expansion.<br />
A slowdown in the rate of monetary expansion is clearly essential<br />
if inflation is to be brought under control.<br />
It is not appropriate, however, for me to say too much<br />
about the Budget at this stage, beyond that it will be a responsible<br />
budget consistent with out long term objectives of reform, with<br />
consolidation of what we have already achieved, and with progress<br />
towards a stable, growing economy. What I can speak of, however,<br />
are our plans stretching beyond this Budget.<br />
We plan, and I use the word advisedly, to review our<br />
programs and commitments to ensure that, in total and in each<br />
category, our expenditures will be consistent with our overall<br />
objectives for the economy and will consolidate the vast new<br />
programs we have introduced.<br />
We have to look carefully at the question of what<br />
proportion of the resources available in the economy should be<br />
directed through the Australian Government's Budget and how these<br />
resources should best be allocated between the various programs<br />
of the Government. I see this task as having immediate priority.<br />
All new programs and proposals will have to be assessed against<br />
and accommodated within this framework.<br />
Now is a time for consolidation, evaluation planning<br />
for the future with an appropriate balance between welfare and<br />
economic responsibility. Policy must always reflect our concern<br />
for those in want; it must choose the most effective and<br />
efficient means to that end.<br />
We have striven to reform the overall structure of the<br />
Australian economy. In our first year in office, before Australia<br />
was engulfed in the world-wide economic turmoil, we pushed ahead<br />
with the revaluation of the Australian currency and tariff reductions<br />
and removed a number of anachronistic subsidies and taxation<br />
concessions which operated to support less efficient industries.<br />
We replaced the aged Tariff Board machinery with the more up-to-date<br />
and broadly constituted Industries Assistance Commission. Trade<br />
Practices Legislation has been passed and a Trade Practices<br />
Commission established to protect the consumer and enhance<br />
competition. I have no doubt that, in the long run, the Australian<br />
economy will benefit greatly from these measures.<br />
We shall certainly continue to maintain proper exchange<br />
rates and tariff policies. We have made clear our resolve to<br />
encourage and assist the Arbitration Commission to maintain a<br />
wages policy consistent with the slowdown in the rate of inflation,<br />
while protecting the position of wage and salary earners in this<br />
country. / 13 </p>
<p>-13-<br />
In the context of arbitration, it is difficult to take<br />
into account the immensely enhanced value of services now provided<br />
by the ccinmunity and no longer provided from incomes. I mention<br />
in particular the Schools Commission in school year 1974 and<br />
onwards, Medibank in fiscal year 1975-76 and onwards.<br />
We are now in the process of adjusting our fiscal policies<br />
to ensure that they will now and in the long run contribute to<br />
the stability of the economy. Through the Reserve Bank and the<br />
banking system we shall maintain responsible monetary policies<br />
which ensure that credit is available, as needed, for the<br />
development of the Australian economy but that the monetary system<br />
is not awash with liquidity in a way which permits and even promotes<br />
inflation. We must all recognise that the path to price stability<br />
and full employment will not be a short one. We certainly<br />
cannot hope to get there in 1975-76. It is important, however,<br />
to make quite sure that we get on that path and stay on it.<br />
Our aim is to consolidate what we have done, to plan ahead<br />
to produce an environment conducive to economic growth, and<br />
thereby to produce the means of completing the task we set ourselves,<br />
and which we were elected to carry out.<br />
An essential part of the consolidation relates to the<br />
provision of income security for all Australians. When we camne<br />
to power in 1972 there was need for immediate improvement in<br />
welfare services. Considerable progress has been made to effect<br />
that improvement. Further improvements of a more fundamental<br />
kind are needed. To assist in determining new directions, the<br />
Government has a number of expert reports which will form the<br />
basis of a review process over the next year.<br />
We have the reports of the Woodhouse Committee and the<br />
legislation arising from it which the Senate hasreviewed and inxotedupon.<br />
We have some of the reports of the Henderson Inquiry into Poverty.<br />
We have the interim report of the Hancock Inquiry on National<br />
Superannuation, and the final report is expected within the next<br />
few weeks. We have a report from the Priorities Review Staff<br />
canvassing issues raised in the inquiries already mentioned and<br />
discussing possibilities for social welfare reform in Australia.<br />
We are expecting a report later in the year from Mr Justice Toose<br />
on Repatriation. The Asprey Report on Taxation also needs to<br />
be mentionedt there is, of course, a very close relationship<br />
between reforms in the welfare and taxation areas.<br />
Two of the reports I have just mentioned the Henderson<br />
and PRS reports will be released before the end of this month.<br />
They both draw attention to a number of problems which need<br />
attention and to a variety of possible solutions to those problems.<br />
They are reports which require the most careful examination by<br />
the Government. They are reports which I hope will stimulate<br />
public debate and public contribution of a kind which will assist<br />
the Government in taking decisions on them in due course.<br />
Against that background, the Government has decided that<br />
a full year should be set aside in which, in the light of published<br />
expert reports, to develop an equal, fair and workable income<br />
security system for Australia. The review will be conducted by<br />
the Government itself, with Ministers closely directing the work<br />
undertaken and reviewing the progress at regular intervals. / 14<br />
I </p>
<p>-14-<br />
By the time of the 1976-77 Budget I expect the Government<br />
will be in a position to determine its long term program of reform<br />
in the welfare area and the steps which will need to be<br />
progressively taken to achieve those reforms.<br />
The new Budget attempts to be as relevant to the<br />
implementation of the Labor program as its two predecessors. In<br />
the framing of those Budgets, we were concerned about priorities,<br />
the priorities of meeting needs as we saw them, the priorities<br />
of reaching towards goals as we saw them.<br />
The common ground of economic debate between the parties<br />
today is the need to reduce the rate of growth of government<br />
spending. The present Leader of the Opposition makes no specific<br />
proposals about what cuts should be made, while the Leader of<br />
the other Party proposes only more subsidies and new spending.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition's most recent predecessor did at<br />
least make a specific proposal: it was to make percentage cuts<br />
across the board. We have not taken that course because it<br />
avoids the basic task for a Government the task of determining<br />
priorities. In this Budget you will find that we have been as<br />
much concerned about getting our priorities right in circumstances<br />
of great difficulty and complexity as we tried to do when both<br />
national And international circumstances permitted us a far<br />
wider range of options.<br />
The abiding challenge for statesmanship in a democracy is<br />
to try to get the priorities right and to resolve the conflicting<br />
demands about priorities in the context of the desirable and the<br />
possible, the politically possible, the economically possible.<br />
The nature of our Australian society is such that everyone<br />
in politics or government is faced with an ever-increasing range<br />
of demands from the articulate, from the powerful, and equally<br />
inescapable demands and hopes from the less articulate, the least<br />
powerful, that their priorities are the ones which should be adopted.<br />
A remarkably permanent aspect of our Australian society<br />
and Australian history is that for all our sense of independence,<br />
for all our ability to improvise, to take initiatives, our demands<br />
for action always turn into demands for Government action, for<br />
Government assistance. At this very moment, almost every demand<br />
for the protection of free enterprise, for the enhancement of<br />
business freedom, is couched in terms of Government assistance<br />
a subsidy, a quota, a tariff.<br />
It has ever been thus. From the beginning, when we in<br />
Australia have spoken about national priorities, we have really<br />
meant priorities set for the nation by the Government.<br />
Australian political debate has always been extremely vehement.<br />
The peculiar vehemence of Australian political debate<br />
has always been about priorities set by the Government of the day,<br />
whether elected or appointed. One only needs recall that one of<br />
the principal charges against Macquarie, one of the principal<br />
items used to discredit him in the Bigge Report, was the building<br />
of the Obelisk which still stands in what is now Macquarie Place<br />
as the measure of distance from all places out of Sydney. It was<br />
charged against Macquarie-that he had got his priorities wrong.<br />
Those who govern Australia are still accused of trying to build<br />
monuments, when their real wish is to get Australians priorities<br />
right, right for the present and right for generations ahead. </p>
