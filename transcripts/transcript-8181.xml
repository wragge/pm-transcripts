PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY HAYDN SARGENT ON BRISBANE RADIO 4BC<br />
1/ 11/ 90.<br />
E 0 E Proof only.<br />
HSI Our Primre Minister joins us now. Mr Hawke, good morning.<br />
PM: ' Morning Haydn.<br />
HS: Mr Hawks thanks for your time.<br />
PMS Pleasure.<br />
HS: Are you happy about the outcome of the Premiers'<br />
Conference? PM: Very happy indeed, Haydn. A great tribute to my colleagues<br />
right across the political spectrum, they entered the conference<br />
and they prepared for the conference constructively, cooperatively,<br />
and it's reflected in a communique which I think<br />
promises a great deal of benefit for the future.....<br />
HS: Mr Hawke, as far as the Premiers' Conference is concerned,<br />
there were Some very significant developments I guess a lot of<br />
us were expecting or hoping for some other things or extra things<br />
as well. one) of the things that I wondered about was the impact<br />
of this increased costs on the road industry.<br />
PMI It's not a question of increased costs on the road<br />
industry, what we've got now is a situation where the costs of<br />
our transport are unfairly distributed. What is happening is<br />
that our rail freight industry to a considerable extent is<br />
rendered uncompetitive by the fact that the users, the heavy<br />
users of our roads, are subsidised and they are subsidised by the<br />
rest of Australia and what is involved here is ensuring that we<br />
have a system whereby those who actually cause the damage and use<br />
the roads pay a greater and fairer contribution to the cost which<br />
is otherwise unfairly borne by the rest of Australians.<br />
HS: You're talking about the heavy vehicles users, operators.<br />
PM; Yes.<br />
HS: But isn't that going to contribute somewhat significantly<br />
to our inflation rate?<br />
PM: No of course not, what happens at the moment is that your </p>
<p>-2<br />
PM ( cont): t inflation rate is made up of a whole number of<br />
factors. What the community pays for its roads is made up in a<br />
number of ways and whatever the cost is its met. It's being<br />
unfairly met at the moment by the fact that those who actually<br />
use it and cause most of the damage are not in fact meeting a<br />
reasonable share of the damage that they cause.<br />
HSs Yes, but the road operators are the ones who ship the<br />
freight from the factories in Sydney and Melbourne to Brisbane,<br />
to Adelaide to Perth or wherever, and they charge x dollars for<br />
the delivery of that freight. Now if that freight charge goes up<br />
because they're going to have to pay higher fees and heavier<br />
costs, isn't it going to come out in the supermarket on the<br />
shelves? PM: Not necessarily, you will have a situation where you're<br />
going to create a more competitive transport situation in this<br />
country. We will certainly be making, for instance, the rail<br />
freight will become more competitive because we are going we've<br />
already signed yesterday a National Rail Freight Corporation.<br />
That will be established by July of next year. The governments<br />
will be prepared to put capital into making that system more<br />
efficient. As it stands now the road operators have had a very<br />
great advantage because of the fact that they don't have to meet<br />
the costs that really they are associated with in the use of the<br />
roads and in the maintenance of the roads for their use. Now by<br />
making our rail system more competitive there will be more<br />
competition introduced between rail and road and within the road<br />
system itself. So in the end Australians are going to benefit<br />
from the fact that at long last governments have had the<br />
imagination and the courage to face up to creating a more<br />
efficient and competitive system for moving our goods around the<br />
country. HSs With respect, I would hardly think that simply raising the<br />
costs in terms of the road freight operators makes the railways<br />
more competitive. That's seems like putting a ball and a chain<br />
around the ankles of the guys who have been able to operate a<br />
fairly competitive freight delivery service in a nation where<br />
we've got this absolutely ridiculous situation where trains have<br />
to change from one track to the next.<br />
PM: Well the whole point of attacking the question of the rail<br />
system is to introduce more capital restructuring into your rail<br />
system. Not only will that flow from the work we'll do under the<br />
National Rail Freight Corporation, but in the plans that we have<br />
for lifting our transport infrastructure generally and in regard<br />
to rail that is something that simply needs to be done to start<br />
to meet some of the problems that you are referring to in regard<br />
to the fact that we have a railway system that up until now has </p>
<p>3<br />
PM ( cont) zi been dominated by the f act of we living under six<br />
separate States. What the States are saying now is that we are<br />
going to co-operate to make rail more efficient. Butr<br />
irrespective of that you've got a situation which has now been<br />
recognised by a number of independent inquiries, including the<br />
latest report from the Interstate Commission, that we have a<br />
position where those who use and profit from our road systems are<br />
not making a fair contribution to the impact they have on our<br />
road system. In other words, as it is now consumers are<br />
subsidising operators through the fact that what is not met<br />
through a proper registration system which has relation to the<br />
impact of users of our roads, what's not met in that way has to<br />
be met in othdrs by consumers through their taxes.<br />
HS: Yes, but you're only looking at one side of the Coin.<br />
PM: I'm not looking at one side of the coin, the whole point of<br />
what I've been saying Haydn is that we're looking at all sides of<br />
the coin and all sides of the coin when you're talking about the<br />
movement of goods around Australia involves these things they<br />
involve air, they involve sea, they involve the ports, they<br />
involve rail, they involve roads. Those are all the elements of<br />
transport affecting consumers in this country and each one of<br />
those areas is being addressed.<br />
HS: And the consumer always pays the costs of the transport.<br />
PM: The consumer pays currently in Australia a much higher<br />
price. The costs for consumers in Australia are much higher<br />
because up until now there have been inefficiencies in road,<br />
rail, air and in regard to sea and our ports. There have been<br />
inefficiencies in all of those areas and it's this Government,<br />
and now in co-operation with the States, which is tackling all of<br />
0those areas. I mean the logic of what you're saying is that we<br />
allow road operators, heavy road operators, to continue to be<br />
subsidised by the rest of the transport industry and by consumers<br />
by not paying what has been recognised by every independent<br />
inquiry, every independent inquiry that's looked at it has said<br />
that they are being unfairly subsidised, they're not paying a<br />
fair share of what they use to deliver their service.<br />
HS,. No, what I'm saying is that in terms of the logic of the<br />
economics is that if the cost of rail freight goes, up, it is<br />
invariably the consumer sorry road freight goes up, then the<br />
consumer ends up paying the added cost.<br />
PM: All I'm saying is if you are talking about the economics of<br />
it Haydn, you're setting yourself up against every independent<br />
and expert inquiry that's investigated the subject and if you<br />
believe Haydn -and yo're entitled to if you believe that you </p>
<p>4-<br />
PM ( cont): t know better than every independent expert inquiry,<br />
every independent expert inquiry and all the governments, then<br />
you are entitled to feel that. But, with respect I don't wish<br />
to be rude but with respect<br />
HS: Now don't do a Hollingworth on moe.<br />
PM: Well I can certainly tell you what I'm not going to do, I'm<br />
not going to sit passively when people put views to m~ e which are<br />
not correct Hasydn.<br />
HSI Well if not correct not correct in your opinion.<br />
Prime Minister, what moves are going to be made now to get a<br />
unified railway system in Australia because surely when it gets<br />
down to it thist'e the bottom line isn't it?<br />
PM: Well the first step is what we've done. We've signed the<br />
heads of agreement yesterday to establish a National Rail Freight<br />
Corporation and that will establish a fully commercial rail<br />
freight authority designed to operate to world standard<br />
efficiency. Now that's going to involve a clean sheet<br />
industrial award, we've got to start off afresh and so that the<br />
unions know that they are operating in what is going to be a<br />
competitive situation and overmanning or irrelevant work<br />
practices will not be accepted. We have already, an the<br />
Commonwealth, allocated $ 50 million for upgrading rail<br />
infrastructure preparatory to the establishment of this<br />
Corporation and further equity injections into the Corporation<br />
will be discussed with the States. The States and the<br />
Commonwealth will contribute to the Corporation in the form of<br />
both assets for example rolling stock, terminals and other<br />
infrastructure and financially with the levels of contributions<br />
to be determined. The Corporation will be able to tender on a<br />
commercial basis to provide rail services other than those simply<br />
relating to interstate freight, so in this way with the<br />
establishment of this Corporation we'll be goinq not only to<br />
the whole question of interstate freight, creating a capacity to<br />
provide competitive Services within states. So there is a<br />
specific way in which we've started to tackle this issue within<br />
the fact that we're confronted with that you've got these<br />
differing State systems.<br />
HS: Bearing in mind that there are a variety of different<br />
factors that go to make up for inefficiency in say any system,<br />
this case the railway system, how big is the factor that you've<br />
got to keep changing trains between Perth and Cairns to ship<br />
f reight. How big a factor is that in the inefficiency of<br />
railways? PM: Very big and part of the work of the Interstate Rail<br />
Freight Corporation will be to make all the changes that </p>
<p>PM ( cant): t possibly can be made to reduce the cost impact of<br />
those changes.<br />
HS: Yes, leaving aside that for the moment and that was a<br />
positive thing that came out of it, although I think there is a<br />
sting in the -tail and time will prove one of us right how far<br />
down the track are we do you think in terms of the sentiments<br />
expressed at. the Premiers' Conference for the end of the<br />
duplication of so many services at State and Federal level?<br />
PM: A long way down the line, we obviously in the preparation<br />
for the conference, Haydn, and at the conference itself we<br />
addressed these issues and we've already in one area made a<br />
specific decinion. That is a very important area of service<br />
delivery by both levels of government in respect of people, our<br />
fellow Australians with disabilities and we've now made a<br />
specific deci-sion that will divide the responsibilities there,<br />
end a lot of the overlap by the States accepting the<br />
responsibility for accommodation and the Commonwealth accepting<br />
responsibility, for the employment related services. Now that<br />
decision has been made. we are then, have listed the other areas<br />
home and community care and then, of course, a whole range of<br />
other areas where there are duplication of services like aged<br />
care, housing, child care, supported accommodation, assistance<br />
programs, education all these things now are the subject of<br />
specific working parties with deadlines on their work next year<br />
to give us reports, operating on the agreed principles. And the<br />
agreed principles are this, that the level of government best<br />
situated to deliver the service shall get it and if that means us<br />
giving up func~ tions, so be it, we'll do that and there'll be<br />
financial compensation where that is required. We now have a<br />
very specific working program and deadlines to effect the changes<br />
which will e: liminate, as far as possible, the duplication of<br />
services that exist. But not only in terms, Haydn, of the<br />
duplication of services, but one of the areas which is operated<br />
against the inkterests of Australians is the existence of a whole<br />
set of separate State regulatory systems, and manufacturers and<br />
providers of services have had to look at a whole series of<br />
satisfying a whole different series of regulations. Now that's<br />
crazy, it's been recognised as crazy and we're doing these things<br />
about that we've already agreed at this conference that<br />
there'll be uniform national food standards and we'll work to<br />
achieve that; in other areas where you can't necessarily get<br />
uniformity, either at any time because it might be too complex or<br />
immediately, we've adopted the system of mutual recognition and<br />
that simply means that what we'll work out is a basis on where<br />
you have, one State has a regulatory system with certain things<br />
to be satisfied then other States will recognise that in their<br />
State, so that something that comes from, say, New South Wales </p>
<p>-6<br />
PM ( cont) a which satisfies the regulatory requirements of that<br />
State then Queensland will accept that.<br />
HSI That's a real step forward because that is actually costing<br />
Australian manufacturers, and therefore ultimately the consumers,,<br />
millions a year isn't it?<br />
PM: It is indeed and it's a very signif icant step forward and<br />
we will benefiat greatly from that. Another area where we've made<br />
a decision that will operate by the end of the first half of next<br />
year is that. in regard to professional and occupational<br />
recognition. That is where a lawyer who is recognised in<br />
Queensland, heD has his I mention lawyer but you can have a<br />
tradesman.... HS: Registered in Queensland.<br />
PM: Where their qualifications are registered and recognised in<br />
Queensland, then there'll be recognised elsewhere in Australia.<br />
HS: That will be a good thing, I mean that's been bothering<br />
nurses for a long time.<br />
PM: In other words you can see, Haydn, that very significant<br />
decisions have already been taken. It's not a matter of just<br />
setting down reviews with deadlines in other areas which we've<br />
had to do and which will be dealt with during next year, but<br />
we ' ye obviously made decisions which are going to be very<br />
important.<br />
HS: Prime Minister it's good to yarn, I thank you for your<br />
time. PM: It's always good to yarn to you Haydn, thank you and all<br />
the best.<br />
Ends </p>
