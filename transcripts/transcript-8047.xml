PRIMESTRAINITE<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE WITH GEOFFREY PALMER,<br />
PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
2 JULY 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: Ladies and gentlemen, I had the opportunity last<br />
night of having lenghty discussions with my friend and<br />
colleague Geoffrey Palmer, the Prime Minister of New<br />
Zealand. I had further opportunity of one on one with<br />
him this morning for half an hour and then we've just had<br />
a very useful period in the Cabinet with a number of my<br />
Ministers. I think it appropriate Geoffrey as the<br />
visitor that I hand it over to you and if you'd like to<br />
make any comments, if you would.<br />
PALMER: Thanks very much Bob. I appreciate that very<br />
much. The discussions that we've had in Australia have<br />
been very very useful and fruitful. A joint Ministerial<br />
statement has been issued on CER. That statement<br />
indicates that the momentum on CER has been kept up and<br />
advanced. The bedding down of the micro-economic reforms<br />
in Australia, those microeconomic reforms are very<br />
important obviously. What the statement makes clear is<br />
that the CER implications will be considered as those<br />
reforms are carried out. The services protocol now has a<br />
process attached to it with a date. CER has always<br />
worked best when there's been a date set and work has to<br />
be done by that date. The harmonisation of the laws<br />
which this statement highlights is advancing very well<br />
indeed and we are really now at a point where CER is<br />
clearly an outstanding success. We have to think a<br />
little about what the future will bring. The result of<br />
CER has been that the relationship between Australia and<br />
New Zealand has deepened, it has broadened. And the<br />
Australian Prime Minister and myself have agreed that the<br />
Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand should meet<br />
together once a year to discuss the Australia-New Zealand<br />
relationship. Those regular meetings will enable us to<br />
see how the relationship is progressing and review where<br />
it is going. In effect, we'll be working on annual<br />
stocktakes of our relationship. This is a very<br />
significant development in Australia-New Zealand<br />
relations because New Zealand has no such arrangement<br />
with any other country of this character. Obviously we<br />
meet regularly at Commonwealth Heads of Government<br />
meetings, at Forum meetings and things of that sort, but<br />
to have a meeting once a year that concentrates at Prime </p>
<p>Ministerial level on the trans-Tasman relationship is a<br />
very important development and I'm very grateful to the<br />
Australian Government and the Australian Prime Minister<br />
for agreeing to this proposal. I see it as a way of<br />
lifting our game, both bilaterally, regionally, and<br />
globally. That's really all I've got to say. I'll be<br />
happy to answer questions.<br />
PM: Could I just very briefly add to supplement what<br />
Geoffrey's had to say and then, as I say, we'll be open<br />
to questions. On the question of questions may I say if<br />
we could have them firstly directed to Australia-New<br />
Zealand matters and then if per chance the Australians<br />
have any questions on any other matter we'll take those<br />
at the end.<br />
May I confirm what Geoffrey has said. It has been a very<br />
useful meeting. This is not the usual comfortable words<br />
of politicians who meet. We've discussed a range of<br />
matters of considerable substance, not only bilaterally<br />
but in regard to the region Geoffrey was good enough to<br />
discuss with my colleagues in the Cabinet the<br />
implications of the review, the very substantial review<br />
that's just recently been completed by New Zealand in<br />
regard to the South Pacific. That has some implications<br />
for us and I think once again out of that we're able to<br />
be sure that we go to the Forum meeting in Vila in a few<br />
weeks' time with a common position on matters of<br />
substance. We did also have some discussions about global matters<br />
and found ourselves at one on our assessment of what was<br />
occurring there. In the bilateral matter, the communique<br />
covers those matters. I'd just like to make this point,<br />
that it is the case that the progress under CER has been<br />
significantly in advance of the anticipations at the<br />
beginning of that process, vide that we're now into the<br />
free movement of goods across the Tasman some five years<br />
earlier than was anticipated. We have realistically<br />
faced up to the question of services.<br />
New Zealand liked the idea of a data That makes<br />
sense and we understand that. We've got to make it<br />
clear, as Geoffrey has alluded to, that we are in the<br />
process right now of looking at some of the important<br />
areas of services, some of the most important,<br />
particularly in telecommunications and banking. Banking<br />
comes into another category of concern. But in regard to<br />
what we're doing in the area of telecommunications and<br />
aviation, we are, in those two areas in particular,<br />
looking at what the changes are going to be in Australia.<br />
New Zealand understands that because of that fact we have<br />
to have the reservations which in a sense are reflected<br />
in the statement about those concerns. But having said<br />
that, we've given the undertaking in that what we do in<br />
those areas we will be taking into account the concerns<br />
and interest of New Zealand. We will be advancing </p>
<p>further work in the area of the potential for<br />
harmonisation of commercial laws and practice.<br />
So it's been a constructive meeting and I want to thank<br />
you Geoffrey for the way in which while advancing the<br />
interests of cross-Tasman relationships from New<br />
Zealand's point of view I think also you've been<br />
understanding of the particular concerns and needs that<br />
we have and our present processes of considering the<br />
micre-economic reform that we're undertaking in<br />
Australia. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, New Zealand Prime Minister,<br />
is the question of a monetary union beyond the power of<br />
PALMER: Any monetary union would be a very long way down<br />
the track. We haven't had any discussions about that.<br />
But who can know what in twenty or thirty years the<br />
situation trans-Tasman will be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, in terms of banking and<br />
investment does your bilateral relationship with Japan<br />
make as far as most favoured nation treaty is<br />
concerned? PM: Well in banking, let me go to banking and deal with<br />
the implications of that, and investment. As Geoffrey<br />
and the New Zealanders understand, the Nara Treaty we<br />
have with Japan in the area of investment means that we<br />
can't get into an agreement with New Zealand which would<br />
give them benefits that we've not extended to Japan. But<br />
I think the important and New Zealand understand that<br />
I think the important thing to understand though in the<br />
investment area is this, that if you look at the<br />
statistics and I think they were reflected in the<br />
communique, but they are very telling. From 1983 until<br />
the present time, cross-Tasman investment has increased<br />
from $ 1.5 billion to just over $ 10 billion which is about<br />
a 680% increase. Now, that is massive, and fortunately<br />
it's very evenly balanced. There's nothing in the<br />
balance of investment one way or the other.<br />
Substantially, that means as far as New Zealand and<br />
Australia are concerned, that they have not met with<br />
difficulties. So while there may be some theoretical<br />
concern about the limitations imposed by the Nara<br />
agreement, in practical terms we've seen this enormous<br />
increase in investment. That I think is going to<br />
continue. In regard to banking there's a somewhat<br />
different situation there which we've frankly talked<br />
about with one another. We made a decision in this<br />
country about the number of banks, foreign banks that<br />
we'd have in here. While New Zealand has a situation<br />
where they have a right to say no to any bank coming<br />
in, in practical terms virtually any foreign bank that<br />
wants to go in there can go in. If you were to have<br />
complete freedom in banking services between Australia<br />
and New Zealand, that could mean that our position of </p>
<p>having a limit would be subverted. We've frankly<br />
discussed this and I think New Zealand understands that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Palmer, the Opposition here is<br />
considering a consumption tax and Mr Reith, the Shadow<br />
Treasurer, has just been to your country to have a look<br />
at how it works. In retrospect, would you recommend that<br />
a country have a consumption tax in light of your<br />
experience? PALMER: I can say that the GST tax that we introduced<br />
was a great success from the point of view of its<br />
administration. It's easy to run, simple to administer,<br />
very hard to escape from and certainly has helped our tax<br />
mix. But whether any other country should adopt it is<br />
not a concern for us.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Palmer, will you pushing for a New<br />
Zealand special preference if Australia either<br />
decides to competitor in communications market or<br />
allows investment in one or our existing carriers?<br />
PALMER: We won't be asking for special New Zealand<br />
preference in that connection. We understand that there<br />
are important micro-economic changes going on. Those<br />
policies have yet to be considered by the Australian<br />
Government. All we are asking, and all this communique<br />
says is that the CER aspects of these things will be<br />
concerted as those policies are developed.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, there are several areas where<br />
pushing for more open services investment, trans-<br />
Tasman shipping. One gets the impression that Australia<br />
is somewhat prone to slow things down, at least not going<br />
at the speed of New Zealand What's your<br />
PM: I can understand in a sense that view being there<br />
because, let's be quite open and frank about CER as<br />
Geoffrey has been in the Cabinet this morning. CER is in<br />
a sense more important to New Zealand than it is to<br />
Australia for no other reason than size. I mean, we're<br />
seventeen million, you're four. The opportunities that<br />
are opened up for New Zealand to have access to that<br />
vastly enlarged market, by definition, I mean it's no<br />
reflection-on New Zealanders or Australians, it's simply<br />
an arithmetical fact that it is more significant for New<br />
Zealand. It's therefore talked about more in New Zealand<br />
as is a matter of evidence than it is here. But the next<br />
point to make is this, and it's at least as important,<br />
that at the political level here in Australia we take it,<br />
I think, as seriously as in New Zealand. We understand<br />
the importance of it for us but we certainly also<br />
understand the importance of it for New Zealand. It is<br />
the case that it was because of our cooperation with New<br />
Zealand that we ' ye got this vast acceleration in freeing<br />
up trade and goods. That couldn't have happened unless<br />
we'd agreed to it. We agreed to it because we thought it<br />
was in the interests of Australia and of New Zealand. So </p>
<p>if you had to stand still now in 1990 and look at the<br />
progress of CER as against the anticipations and<br />
expectations of 1983, by any judgement it's proceeded<br />
infinitely faster than was expected. That could not have<br />
happened without the cooperation of Australia. Now,<br />
having said that, we now reach the point of the important<br />
area of services, very important for New Zealand and for<br />
US. It is the fact that New Zealand has made a set of<br />
decisions in regard to its services sector before, in a<br />
sense, we have made our sets of decisions. And that's<br />
particularly true in regard to telecommunications. New<br />
Zealand understands that it's not open for us to make a<br />
firm decision about the relationship and opportunities<br />
for New Zealand in Australia, and Australia in New<br />
Zealand in that area, until we have completed our<br />
consideration. That doesn't reflect any desire on our<br />
part to slow processes down. It is just the political<br />
reality in that area.<br />
PALMER: There's an additional point. A lot of the<br />
micro-economic reforms in Australia involve the States.<br />
Now New Zealand doesn't have this problem. Not that it<br />
might not be a problem, but we do not have<br />
PM: Don't kid yourself. Let me interrupt. I tell my<br />
New Zealand friends over there that they will never fully<br />
understand the beauty of politics in New Zealand. No<br />
States, no Upper House, no Constitution. I mean when<br />
you're elected, you're elected.<br />
PALMER: And when you want to do micro-economic reform<br />
you can do it. And the problem is that obviously we<br />
understand because of those obstacles that the timetable<br />
could not be necessarily the same in Australia as it was<br />
in New Zealand. And a number of these things require to<br />
be worked through. They require further discussions,<br />
they require a lot of complementary legislation even<br />
perhaps in some cases with the States. So we're not<br />
impatient, we're not expressing some feeling that there<br />
is any dragging of the chain going on here, not at all.<br />
It's just that the profile of the environment in which<br />
you make decisions here is inordinately complicated.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Palmer, how concerned are you about the<br />
predatory behaviour of the emerging international megacarrier<br />
airlines, how quickly do you think that Australia<br />
and New Zealand need to get a joint aviation market to<br />
help ensure the viability of national operations both<br />
here and in New Zealand?<br />
PALMER: We're in favour of a joint aviation market.<br />
We've got studies that are going on now which will lead<br />
to some further consideration in Australia about what<br />
their policies will be. That work's well advanced. We<br />
are confident that it'll come out in such a way that we<br />
will be happy with it. </p>
<p>PM: Can I just add in that area, there is already, as<br />
has been indicated, there is work going on, joint work<br />
between our people and the New Zealanders about the<br />
implications of a trans-Tasman aviation market. I'm not<br />
reluctant to say that that's something that's got to be<br />
considered. It has some obvious implications. But not<br />
only for that market, but then for the relationship<br />
between that market and the rest of the world. Those<br />
things are being looked at and I think it's inevitable<br />
that at some point that market is going to emerge. I<br />
think the question is how long, when, when that sort of<br />
thing happens. I think we're both comfortable with the<br />
rate at which that's being looked at.<br />
PALMER: I was just going to add in relation to that<br />
question that New Zealand's experience about having an<br />
Australian airline in New Zealand has been very good in<br />
the sense that the competition between Air New Zealand<br />
and Ansett on our domestic routes has improved things for<br />
the New Zealand consumer enormously.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could I ask either or both or you whether<br />
you discussed the question of the Johnston Atoll and<br />
whether there's any difference between<br />
PM: Yes you can ask it, yes of course. The answer is<br />
yes we did allude to it and I think the obviously<br />
Geoffrey will answer it himself. But what was conveyed<br />
is that they will want to be looking at that in<br />
considerable detail and get advice on it, as indeed will<br />
we. I would hope that out of that investigation that's<br />
done on both sides, that we'll be able to have a common<br />
position when we go to the Forum.<br />
PALMER: There's some United States' officials, as I<br />
understand it, coming to New Zealand. I am going to be<br />
meeting with them to get a briefing on precisely what is<br />
happening and how. The Government of New Zealand will<br />
determine its position when we've had that briefing.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you've indicated in the statement<br />
you'll be designating two new carriers in the area<br />
PM: I said I'll be what?<br />
JOURNALIST: Designating two new carriers in the area of<br />
trans-Tasman air freight. Have you decided going to<br />
be? PM: Yes, there is a decision.<br />
JOURNALIST: What is that decision?<br />
PM: Not to be announced here. I've got a Minister who<br />
will make an announcement.<br />
JOURNALIST: How soon? </p>
<p>PM: Quite soon.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Palmer, on Bougainville, you've recently<br />
currently offered three of your warships. Were you able<br />
to tell Mr Hawke whether the Bougainville Revolutionary<br />
Army or the PNG Government have accepted your offer, and<br />
what communications you have had with them?<br />
PALMER: New Zealand has kept the Australian Government<br />
fully briefed on these developments, not only after they<br />
happened but before they happened. What we are aiming to<br />
do is simply offer a neutral venue for talks, a secure<br />
venue so that those talks can take place. Our<br />
information is that the BRA is likely to accept that<br />
offer. But it's not easy for us to delve into their<br />
decision-making process.<br />
PM: Could I just make the point on that that we welcome<br />
the initiative of New Zealand. It is obviously easier for<br />
New Zealand to do that than it would have been for<br />
Australia, for obvious reasons, as far as the BRA is<br />
concerned. There is no suggestion whatsoever that we are<br />
other than pleased with and welcoming of the facilities<br />
that New Zealand has agreed to provide if the two parties<br />
agree to use them.<br />
JOURNALIST: have discussions with the BRA, or<br />
through intermediaries or<br />
PALMER: We have had various means by which their views<br />
have been transmitted to us.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Palmer, can I just clarify with you, Mr<br />
Beazley, I think, has flagged the possibility of a merger<br />
between Qantas and Air New Zealand. Do you have any inprinciple<br />
objection to that option being on the table?<br />
PALMER: Of course Qantas has a significant shareholding<br />
in Air New Zealand now. And the way in which the future<br />
companies organise themselves no doubt will have to be<br />
considered in due course as the new Australian policy is<br />
developed and after it has been announced. But at the<br />
moment the New Zealand Government does not have a<br />
position on that question.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you have a time limit where becomes<br />
more important for Air New Zealand and New Zealand's<br />
interests to be such that you would start looking around<br />
for other alliances if Australia doesn't act in this<br />
area? PALMER: We're not endeavouring to bring pressure on<br />
Australia in that way. We are quite content with the<br />
processes that have been put in train here.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Palmer, if there is a merger between<br />
Qantas and Air New Zealand, it's going to make it fairly </p>
<p>difficult for Air New Zealand to then get domestic rights<br />
within Australia.<br />
PALMER: Well that's really not a question that I've<br />
considered. I would need to study that with my Minister<br />
of Civil Aviation and work out exactly what is proposed.<br />
It's not a proposal that I've even heard of.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Willis, in an interview on television<br />
yesterday, left open his view on whether Senator<br />
Richardson was still trying to secure his downfall from<br />
the Ministry for his own political purposes. Do you see<br />
that going on behind the scenes in<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you ever offer Mr Willis an overseas<br />
posting of any sort?<br />
PM: Any discussions that I have had with any of my<br />
Ministers are confidential.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: and now, if you are going to write that up Hawke<br />
refuses to deny, OK, that's I have always, I think<br />
you know Milton, taken the view that conversations with<br />
my JOURNALIST: I understand that<br />
PM: I've got to take, I've got to take the risk that<br />
that's the way it will be run, that Hawke refuses to<br />
deny. But I am not going to break the rule that I've<br />
followed for seven years of not, you know, going into the<br />
details of private conversations I have with any, any<br />
Minister. JOURNALIST: do you expect Mr Willis to stay in the<br />
position he's in for the rest of the term?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: While you say you're not aware that Senator<br />
Richardson is trying to get rid of Mr Willis, yet Mr<br />
Willis has suggested that<br />
PM: No, no, no. I watched that program. I didn't know<br />
Mr Willis was going on it, but as I tend to watch the<br />
program, I didn't get the impression that Mr Willis said<br />
that that was still going on.<br />
JOURNALIST: had gone on<br />
PM: Well, that's not the question you put to me. I<br />
mean, what I'm, what I'm saying is he gave an answer<br />
which, as I recall, I say it subject to correction, was<br />
that he would not deny that that had happened. My </p>
<p>equally clear recollection was that he did not say that<br />
that was still going on.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does it concern you that did happen though?<br />
PM: Well, you had a situation at the, after the last<br />
election where it was thought in some quarters that<br />
Victoria was over-represented. Now, there was that<br />
thought in some quarters. Let me make it clear that I<br />
took the view that as far as Ralph Willis was concerned,<br />
he deserved to stay in the Ministry and I took steps to<br />
ensure that that happened.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what are you going to do about<br />
these on-going tensions which seem to be bubbling to the<br />
surface between<br />
PM: What I'm going to do is to make sure that this<br />
Government goes about the business of Government and that<br />
is to make relevant decisions and that's what we're<br />
about. And I make this suggestion to you that we're now<br />
at the beginning of this financial year ' 90/' 91 and that<br />
in the first half of this financial year, or which is the<br />
second half of calendar ' 90, you will see a range of very<br />
significant decisions taken by this Government in regard<br />
to the conduct of macro and micro economic policy which<br />
will be extremely important for the future welfare of<br />
this country. That's what I'm going to do I'll be<br />
sitting in the Cabinet, chairing the meetings of the ERC,<br />
of the Structural Adjustment Committee, of the subcommittee<br />
of SAC in regard to sustainable development, as<br />
well as chairing the Cabinet. I will be chairing all<br />
those meetings and ensuring that the business of<br />
Government is undertaken. One day, one day you will get<br />
your balances right. I mean, it's all very interesting,<br />
and this is not said in criticism, I mean, if I were<br />
sitting where you were, I would write up the stories<br />
about what Senator Richardson has said or what Mr Willis<br />
has said. That's, that's your duty, but I'm simply<br />
saying in a friendly fashion, I mean, get your balances<br />
right. I mean, it's as though the Government is<br />
consumed, if you were to read your stories, by continual<br />
back-biting and some Minister having a go at another.<br />
Yes, some of that has happened. I mean, wouldn't I be an<br />
idiot to deny it. But the important thing is that the<br />
processes of Government are going on and the proof of<br />
that particular pudding will be in the eating. You will<br />
see as this year goes on, a range of decision making and<br />
important decision making which will be as substantial or<br />
more substantial than anything that has occurred in the<br />
period of this Government. That's my responsibility, to<br />
ensure that those things happen and they will.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, will you be telling your Ministers<br />
to get their balances right?<br />
PM: Well, I would say that essentially they have. I<br />
mean, if you want to use the word balance between hard </p>
<p>constructive work that's being done by those Ministers<br />
and the occasional off-beat comment which I would have<br />
preferred they hadn't made, Michelle, I mean, I'm not<br />
going to be stupid and say I'm happy that all these<br />
things have been said, but you use the word balance<br />
JOURNALIST: you use the word..<br />
PM: I know, and you picked it up in regard to individual<br />
Ministers and I'm saying if you would almost believe,<br />
from the way you write, that all that's being done by<br />
these Ministers is to spend their time sniping. Whereas<br />
the, the fact is in regard. to all of them, they are<br />
working extremely hard and playing their part in this<br />
process that I've referred to. 1990 will be seen as a<br />
year of most significant decision making and that could<br />
not have happened unless all Ministers were playing their<br />
part. JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I'll come back to..<br />
JOURNALIST: I'm sorry, I was going to say in this<br />
situation, you'd have to agree that it's a fairly unruly<br />
way to go about the process. For a Minister to be<br />
talking on one hand about how the Government does need to<br />
show more control Cabinet in what they say, and<br />
yet, on the very same breath pointing to people who he's<br />
disagreed with?<br />
PM: Well, he was asked a question. I mean, I would<br />
think if you look at the Minister in question, Mr Willis,<br />
over a period of seven years he is not a Minister who<br />
would be characterised as a talker to the Press. Indeed,<br />
if I recollect correctly, what the Press has complained<br />
about, in a sense, or has analysed Mr Willis for, is some<br />
reluctance to push his own interests, talk about what<br />
he's doing and so on. I think it comes as a little bit<br />
strange in regard to Mr Willis if he has said something<br />
now that he really is someone who, you know, is given to,<br />
to loose statements or unwise statements and I would find<br />
it hard to make that judgement. Now obviously, having<br />
said that and it goes, I think, back to Michelle as, as I<br />
think the supplementary question she was asking. I mean,<br />
I've made the point in the period since the election that<br />
I would have been happier, obviously, if some of these<br />
statements hadn't been made. They haven't been helpful,<br />
but if I had been of the view that what was happening was<br />
that the processes, the important processes of Government<br />
were being neglected, I would be very much more unhappy.<br />
I take the view that they now find themselves in a fourth<br />
term of Government, I'm pleased about that some of them<br />
may be surprised, they're all pleased and there may have<br />
been some, can I put it down this way, some letting down<br />
of the guard. Now I believe that that guard will go up,<br />
I expect it to, but importantly, I repeat, the hard </p>
<p>unremitting work of Government has been going on and will<br />
go on.<br />
JOURNALIST: Dr Charles' job is on the line?<br />
PM: Beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: About Dr Charles.<br />
PM: Dr Charles, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: It is the second time in, I think, more than<br />
a week that a leading public servant has spoken out<br />
against Government's..<br />
PM: I have read with considerable interest the remarks<br />
attributed to Dr Charles. When I read them I contacted<br />
the Secretary of my Department, Mr Codd, who was in<br />
Melbourne and indicated my concern at the remarks, if<br />
they were an accurate report of Dr Charles. I have<br />
requested Mr Codd to follow this matter up and as a<br />
result of that discussion with Mr Codd, I understand that<br />
Mr Codd will be seeing Dr Charles this afternoon to<br />
ascertain if the remarks attributed to him in The<br />
Financial Review are correctly attributed and Mr Codd<br />
will be reporting to me. That's what I've done and I'm<br />
awaiting the report to me from Mr Codd.<br />
JOURNALIST: Dr Charles' job on the line?<br />
PM: I will be awaiting the report from Mr Codd. The<br />
f act that I have done this, indicates the degree of my<br />
concern. Let me make this point. It is not simply, if<br />
if it is accurate, it's not simply the remarks as such,<br />
the criticism as such. But if one were to allow that to<br />
go unnoticed, unremarked and undealt with, then you<br />
obviously would have an untenable situation as far as<br />
Government is concerned, not just this Government, but<br />
it's been true of all governments that it is not the<br />
entitlement of public servants to be indulging in the<br />
criticism of Government. They have the right and indeed,<br />
in my judgement, the responsibility to push to their<br />
Ministers a view, an analysis of where they think<br />
Government policy may be wrong, alternatives. That<br />
should be done internally, but it is a canon of<br />
Government which has been followed by governments of both<br />
persuasions that that expectation you have of public<br />
servants that they will do that within their job and<br />
within the Public Service does not extend to public<br />
crticism. So I'll receive the report and then I'm not<br />
hypothecating what I will do. I don't know what's going<br />
to be in the report to me.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, don't Dr Charles' comments and<br />
comments of Mr Phillips last week indicate quite serious<br />
reservations amongst those who advise the Government<br />
about the monetary policy and the direction of<br />
economic </p>
<p>PM: Well, Geoff, I'm not going to, to the question of<br />
what is attributed to Dr Charles because I have got to<br />
have it established that, that the remarks are correctly<br />
attributed. But in this area obviously there is a<br />
situation where people, economists, will have different<br />
views. It has never been the case in the field of<br />
economics at this period, or at any other, that you have<br />
a unanimity of view amongst economists. It has never<br />
been true and it's not true in Australia at this time<br />
that you have unamimity of view amongst economists.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there was a suggestion that<br />
the Pyramid Building Society collapse was raised at the<br />
Premiers' Conference last week. Did Mr Cain seek any<br />
help from the Federal Government?<br />
PM: There was some I think he had some discussion<br />
with Mr Keating and he did have some discussion with me.<br />
You will note the statement that has been released by the<br />
Reserve Bank today which I welcome. That's the Reserve<br />
Bank is the appropriate arm of, of the official<br />
structure, the federal official structure, to make a<br />
comment on this and I'm pleased, as I'm sure Mr Cain and<br />
people in Victoria will be, with the statement that has<br />
been made by the Reserve Bank. I have nothing to add to<br />
it. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you talked about substantial<br />
progress in both micro and macro policy making in the<br />
next little while. I was just wondering does that signal<br />
a major change in the weightings of economic, macro<br />
economic policy?<br />
PM: No. No.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: No. I announced during the election campaign what<br />
the program of the Government would be, the sort of time<br />
table in the areas in which we've be acting made that<br />
clear then. Since our re-election we've moved to give<br />
effect to that commitment I made during the election.<br />
JOURNALIST: You're absolutely happy with the weighting<br />
between monetary and fiscal policy at the moment. You<br />
see no need re adjustment there?<br />
PM: Yes I am happy. I think we've, Michelle, in this<br />
area there will, as I said, there will always be room for<br />
argument between economists as to getting the absolutely<br />
perfect relationship between the major three arms of<br />
policies, monetary and fiscal and, and wages. In the<br />
Australian political scene where we have the great<br />
advantage of course, is that we have an affective wages<br />
policy. Which means that as between the alternatives of<br />
Labor and the Conservatives, there does not have to be<br />
the same weight upon the other two arms of policy as </p>
<p>13<br />
there would have to be under the Conservatives not having<br />
a wages policy, there would have to be more weight upon<br />
monetary policy and fiscal policy. Now, we will continue<br />
to have the three arms of policy tight. We are now as a<br />
Government about to go into the worst period of the year,<br />
as I've told you before, the ERC process will start in<br />
earnest this week really next week and that will be<br />
there to ensure that on the fiscal side, policy remains<br />
tight. And I think yes, that we've got it right. I<br />
mean, you don't want me to bore you with the statistics<br />
again. I can do it very easily, they are well in my<br />
mind. But if you look at the area of fiscal policy,<br />
Michelle, been very tight for the last three to four<br />
years and I can assure that the Budget we bring down will<br />
continue a period a policy of fiscal rectitude.<br />
Wages policy, you know, that's set and in that sense<br />
monetary policy is the, is a swinger of what you are<br />
doing in the other areas. Now there is always some room<br />
for some argument as to whether the balance is absolutely<br />
right. But it is my view and the view of Paul and the<br />
Government that we have it right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke isn't the present balance taking a<br />
very heavy toll in the competitiveness of Australian<br />
exports? PM: Well, one of the fascinating things about the<br />
discussion, Geoffrey, is this that there is some<br />
assumption that in regard to some of the criticisms that<br />
have been made, that under the position, say, of Mr<br />
Phillips that you would have easier monetary policy. Not<br />
true. I mean, what has been argued by many and it seems<br />
by Mr Phillips, and I'm not getting into a criticism of<br />
any individuals, but I'm simply making the point, don't<br />
let there be the easy assumption that what's being argued<br />
is some easier position for business in terms of easier<br />
monetary policy. If you were giving a greater weight to<br />
the fight against inflation, as is argued by some, there<br />
would be higher interest rates and higher interest rates<br />
would certainly not be consistent with what you are<br />
talking about a more competitive position for<br />
Australian industry. Quite the contrary.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, a special category for the Chinese<br />
in Australia before June 20 last year. Does that cover<br />
all Chinese Government employees in Australia, including<br />
those at the Chinese Embassy and Consulates and if so<br />
could this create problems of its own?<br />
PM: No. It doesn't create problems of its own. In the<br />
case of these people who are making those applications<br />
for asylum, they will be dealt with according to the<br />
normal way in such applications are made. It doesn't<br />
create any difficulties at all. OK?<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the St George Building<br />
Society I understand has written to you, I don't know<br />
whether you have received the letter or not </p>
<p>14<br />
PM: I haven't received any letter from them yet.<br />
JOURNALIST: Expressed outrage at Mr Willis' comments<br />
yesterday about relative safety of investing funds in<br />
building societies. How do you respond to that sort of<br />
suggestion that building societies are upset by them. Do<br />
you endorse Mr Willis' comments?<br />
PM: I'm not, I'm not making any comment upon that<br />
other that to say this. Mr Willis didn't intend to upset<br />
building societies or make any attack upon them. He was<br />
and I believe nothing could have been further from his<br />
mind I think he was simply referring to the fact of the<br />
difference in the relationship between the banks and the<br />
Reserve Bank the Reserve Bank behind the banks in the<br />
absence of that situation via a vis the building society.<br />
Now that's, that's not a question of value judgements.<br />
That's simply a fact and I think he was referring to<br />
that. Mr Willis would in no way be seeking to attack or<br />
cast a reflection upon building societies. That was the<br />
essential fact to which he was referring. Thanks.<br />
