CONDOLiJNCC MO'ION: THE HON. FRANK STEWART<br />
Mr. Speaker, I move tihat this House expresses its deep regret at the<br />
death on 16 April, 1979, of tlhe lonourable Francis Eugene Stc. art,<br />
a Memiber of this House for the Division of Lang from 1953<br />
to 1977, and for the Di-ision of Grayndler since 1977 and<br />
a Minister of the Crown from 1972 to 1975; and that this<br />
House places on record its appreciation of his long and<br />
meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy<br />
to his widow and family in their bereavement.<br />
We were saddened to hear during the recent recess of the death<br />
of the IHlonourable Frank Stewart, a long-standing and highly<br />
respected Member of this House.<br />
Mr. Stewart's untimely death takes from the Parliament a " an<br />
who had given the country much, and had so much more to gi-ve.<br />
His passing takes from hij. s wife and six children a loved<br />
and respected husband and father.<br />
Frank Stewart was born in Belmore, Sydney, on 20 February 1923<br />
and was educated at St. Mary's Cathedral College. FranIk was<br />
always a keen sportsman. HI-Ic had been a first class Rugby<br />
player, and was an excellent tennis player.<br />
Before entering the Parli-ament, he worked in the State Departent<br />
of Transport for 14 years. This period was interrupted by<br />
his four \ ears service in the Australian Infantry Forces<br />
during World War II. IHe served in New Guinea and achieved the<br />
rank of Sergeant.<br />
In 1953, Frank Stewart won a by-election to the Sydney metropolitan<br />
seat of Lano, which he represented continuously until it w': as<br />
abolished in 1977. Hle then contested, and won, the new sc-t<br />
of Crayndler, which generally coincided with the area of his<br />
former division.<br />
DinLg nis 26 years as a Federal Momber he served with<br />
charactoristic conscientiousness on several Parliamentary<br />
comm itte Cs. lie was an active member of the Standing Committee<br />
on Printing from 1959 to 1969 and the Joint Committee on<br />
Parliamentary and Government Publicati. ons from 1962 to 1964.<br />
Frank Stowart held the posi-tion of temporary Chairman of<br />
Committees from 1964 to 1969. / 2 </p>
<p>More recently over the past threc years he served<br />
as Deputy Chairman of both the Standing Committee on<br />
Expenditure and the Select Committee on Tourism.<br />
In addition, on numerous occasions, he representcd the<br />
Parliament and his Government at international conferences.<br />
During the term of Labor Government, Frank Stewart held<br />
Ministerial appointments, including Minister for Tourism<br />
and Recreation and Vice-Prcs: ideat of the Executive Council.<br />
He also assisted the Treasurer and other Ministers in<br />
their portfolio responsibilities. As Minister for Tourism<br />
and Recreation in the Labor Government, he demonstrated his<br />
ability as a capable and hard-working administrator and as<br />
a man with a sharp sense of his responsibility to<br />
this Parliament.<br />
Frank Ste. wart was a man widely respected for his integrity and<br />
resolution in holding to his convictions. He was recognised<br />
as an adherent of the " old school" of the Labor Party.<br />
Hle was also a highly principled and deeply religious man a<br />
Roman Catholic who actively pursued moral causes.<br />
All Honourable Members will recall the force and conviction<br />
with which he espoused his views. Though many Members of<br />
this Chamber may have disagreed with him at times, I believc that<br />
his Parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the House had<br />
a respect and affection for him--for his character, honesty<br />
and sinagle-mindedness of purpose.<br />
We all feel a great deal of sadness at the loss of a colleague<br />
who distinguished himself as a Parliamentarian, a Minister,<br />
and a dedicated member of his Party.<br />
On behalf of the Government, I extend to his widow and family<br />
our sincere sympathy at the passing of a fine Australian.<br />
