and destruction caused by the earthquake that occurred in<br />

This is the second disaster of this nature to have struck<br />
Italy in the last four years.<br />
Australians share the grief of those who have l. ost members of<br />
their families or friends as a result of -the earthquake.<br />
The Government and people of Italy can be assured of the support<br />
and sympathy of all. Australians. The Australian Government has<br />
decided to relax migrant entry requirements so that relatives<br />
of Australian residents affected by-the earthquake can be<br />
sponsored for migration as quickly as possible. The Minister<br />
for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will announce details later<br />
today. In addition, the Government has begun discussions with Italian<br />
authorities as to the most suitable ways in which Australians<br />
can contribute emergency relief.<br />

$ 500,000 to the Australian appeal which is being established<br />
by leaders of the Italian Community in Australia. I have<br />
agreed to be Patron of that appeal.<br />

could be treated as deductible for taxation purposes. The<br />
Commonwealth would also agree to match dollar for dollar funds<br />
contributed by the States. The specific purpose for which the<br />
money will be used will be decided in consultation between the<br />
Italian and Australian Governments and the organisers of the<br />
Australian appeal.<br />
