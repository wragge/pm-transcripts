FOR PRESS PM. No. 63/ 1971<br />
BELL BAY PROJECT<br />
Joint Statement by the Prime Minister ( Mr W. McMahon)<br />
and the Premier 6 Tasmania ( Mr W. A. B ethune<br />
The Prime Minister ( Mr McMahon) and the Premier<br />
of Tasmania ( Mr W. A. Bethune) this morning discussed the<br />
financing of the Bell Bay Railway Project<br />
This project is being planned by the Tasmanian<br />
Government to serve the development in Northern Tasmania of<br />
a wood chip industry based on large export contracts with Japan.<br />
The improvement in rail services will also assist more generally<br />
the development of the Bell Bay region.<br />
Today's discussions were against the background<br />
of Commonwealth assistance already approved towards the<br />
construction of a new rail link between Nelson's Creek and Bell<br />
Bay at an estimated cost of $ 3.5 million.<br />
In the light of further submissions now made by<br />
the Premier, the Commonwealth has agreed to extend this assistance<br />
so as to relate to a total cost of $ 5 million to take in the upgrading<br />
of the Nelson's Creek/ Launceston sector of the existing line and<br />
certain minor associated works.<br />
It was understood that responsibility for arranging<br />
the provision of the necessary additional rolling stock would lie<br />
with the Tasmanian Government.<br />
