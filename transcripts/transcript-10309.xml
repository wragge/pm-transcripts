18 April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
SPEECH TO THE HUNTER VALLEY WINE ASSOCIATION<br />
THANKSGIVING DINNER, POKOLBIN<br />
Thank you very much Mr Barnes. To our host and hostess, to Brian and Fay<br />
McGuigan, to that great Liberal colleague of mine, Bob Baldwin, the Member for<br />
Paterson, come on, give him a clap, and to many other distinguished guests and very<br />
great and famous names in the wine industry of Australia and can I particularly<br />
acknowledge the presence of Len Evans who I have known, I have known Evans for<br />
years and like so many people who have spent most of their working life in the city of<br />
Sydney, some people who live in Canberra at the moment complain that I still spend<br />
too much of my working life in Sydney. They say I should spend more of it in<br />
Canberra but I think the people of Sydney think otherwise. I have enjoyed the<br />
hospitality of Len at the Bulletin place and it's terrific to see he and his wife, Tricia<br />
here and to know what a tremendous life they've made for themselves here in the<br />
Hunter over the last ten years.<br />
Can I say, this is an enormously relaxing way to end a week where one or two things<br />
happened. I can almost say a " Wik" in which one or two things happened but I can<br />
assure you that sort of hasn't flickered out yet. We're still working very hard at it but<br />
it really is a great escape to come here to celebrate the end of the harvest, to<br />
congratulate you on the tremendous contribution that you are making to the Australian<br />
economy, to say what marvellous economic conditions the new Government has<br />
created for such a great industry, to extol the virtues of a stable taxation system,<br />
predictable taxation system, and really I guess share with all of you as Australians the<br />
national champion that the wine industry of Australia has now become.<br />
We hear a lot about national champions. We hear the banks saying they want to be<br />
national champions. We hear some people in the media saying they want to be national<br />
champions but I think the great national champion of the last few years of the<br />
Australian export industry has in fact been the wine industry of this country, it really<br />
has. The way in which it's all changed, the way in which you've been able to penetrate </p>
<p>markets that were regarded only 10 or 15 years ago was absolutely beyond the call as<br />
far as the Australian wine industry is concerned is quite remarkable and the way in<br />
which here in the Hunter you have combined not only a great industry that delivers<br />
enormous pleasure and relaxation and congeniality to so many Australians but also the<br />
way in which you've generated a tremendous tourist industry and also I hope<br />
preserved some of the special rural and provincial character of the district has really<br />
been quite remarkable.<br />
I must say that I was struck through the introduction with the cricketing analogy. Of<br />
course that was obviously tailored, it was obviously tailored to sort of touch the heart<br />
of somebody like myself who is quite a lover of that game and I was saying to Tricia<br />
Evans that the most memorable luncheon I have ever had in my life was a luncheon I<br />
had in Adelaide about five years ago with the late Max Schubert when he was still very<br />
much with us, thank God, Sir Donald Bradman, and it was an extraordinary privilege<br />
to spend a couple of hours with those two giants of their respective ways of life and<br />
their respective achievements and it was just a very humbling reminder of the massive<br />
achievements and the massive talents of so many of our fellow Australians.<br />
So I want to thank all of you for the contribution that you are making to our country.<br />
I want to congratulate all of you for the sheer excellence and quality. One of the great<br />
experiences you have now, you can go anywhere in the world now and people speak<br />
admiringly of the quality of Australian wine and this is something that I must say of<br />
Prime Minister of Australia, somebody who has the opportunity on occasions of<br />
representing our great nation abroad. The sheer kick that I get out of people saying<br />
how wonderful Australian wine is and the awe in which it is held, the quality, the<br />
consistency of the quality of Australian wine, the fact that there is a uniformity and<br />
quality about it which is quite extraordinary given the size of our country, and I think it<br />
is something that gives tremendous pride and tremendous pleasure to me, it gives<br />
tremendous enjoyment and pride and pleasure to me also and to the other, just about<br />
all of the other 18 million Australians.<br />
So you deserve to have a good time tonight. Thank you for the contribution that you<br />
are making to Australia. Congratulations on your domestic achievement. To Brian<br />
and Fay, thank you very much and can I say to Fay, I recently appointed her to the<br />
Prime Minister's Supermarket to Asia Council and she's doing an absolutely fabulous<br />
job on that Council in helping to build up our export performance and our export<br />
potential into Asia. You are one of the great success stories of this country's wine<br />
industry and Janette and I are absolutely delighted to be amongst you here in the<br />
fabulous Hunter Valley.<br />
Thank you. </p>
