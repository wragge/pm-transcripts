CHECK-AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MINISTERFOR<br />
MEDIA THURSDAY, 23 SEPTEMBER 1982<br />
REVIEW OF COMMONWEALTH ADMINISTRATION<br />
in my statement in Parliament on 21 September 1982,<br />
concerning the Royal Commission on the Australian Meat<br />
Industry, I referred to breakdowns and administrative<br />
failures in a number of areas of government admini.-<br />
stration over the last decade or so.<br />
These matters are obviously of the gravest concern to<br />
all Australians: efficient and effective public<br />
administration is Vital for maintaining the kind of<br />
Australia that we want for our children. The people of<br />
Australia have a right to expect good, honest, efficient<br />
and effective administration, and the Government is<br />
determined to take every possible step to ensure that<br />
this occurs.<br />
In each instance wherethere has been a breakdown in<br />
Public Service administration over recent years, the<br />
Government has made an appropriate and prompt response<br />
to remedy the deficiencies that have come to notice.<br />
But the Government believes that it is vital not only to<br />
remedy deficiencies in administration as they become<br />
known, but also to look more broadly at the Public<br />
Service and the demands upon it in order to do whatever<br />
can be done to prevent such breakdowns occurring.<br />
The general health of the Public Service, including its<br />
efficiency and management, must be a matter of the<br />
highest concern for government. The Public Service<br />
broadly interpreted to include departments and<br />
authorities must be equipped with the kinds of<br />
management structures and tools which will enableit to<br />
deliver government programmes effectively to the people<br />
of Australia, and which will allow it to keep up with<br />
new technology and with changes in community and<br />
business requirements and attitudes. </p>
<p>The Government believes there is a question whether the<br />
Public Service, as presently organised, has the<br />
management tools, the flexibility and the capacities to<br />
meet the challenges that presently exist and that lie<br />
ahead. Departments and authorities must be able not<br />
only to meet the demands of today, but to anticipate the<br />
demands of tomorrow.<br />
There are three evolutionary changes which present<br />
challenges to public administration at the present time.<br />
The first is changing technology, and the so-called<br />
information explosion.<br />
The Public Service needs to be able to cope with the<br />
significant technological changes and the growth of<br />
information which have been and will be taking place,<br />
including the relevance of computer technology to public<br />
administration. Governments and their agencies must be<br />
able to be responsive to, and to take advantage of, new<br />
methods of gathering, processing and applying<br />
information.<br />
But it is not just a matter of applying new technology<br />
to growing information. It is also a matter of knowing<br />
what information is needed and in what form it is<br />
needed to enable departments, authorities and<br />
Ministers to carry out their functions efficiently and<br />
effectively; and a matter of being able to take<br />
practical steps for satisfying these requirements.<br />
The second challenge is posed by the increasing demands<br />
on the public sector flowing from a greater involvement<br />
by government in areas such as social welfare, health,<br />
education and national development, plus many other<br />
areas of concern to the community. The increased scope<br />
and the wider activities of government obviously<br />
enlarges the responsibilities of public administration<br />
enormously and creates difficulties in relation to<br />
adequate communications, accountability and control.<br />
The third challenge, I regret to say, arises from a<br />
deterioration in what I might call the " business<br />
ethics" of a minority.<br />
There was a time when the administration, in its<br />
relationships with business, could assume that a high<br />
degree of trust was appropriate. The Service did not<br />
have to be geared to handle cheating on a large scale.<br />
Of course, there have always been those in the community<br />
who have been prepared to get away with as much as they<br />
can without too much regard for what might be regarded </p>
<p>as. honour, let alone the law: but in the past this has<br />
not been an element which has put significant stress on<br />
the Service itself.<br />
As recent events relating to taxation, meat substitution<br />
and health schemes show only too clearly, there are<br />
those outside the administration and I stress that<br />
they are very much a minority who are prepared to act<br />
ruthlessly in what they perceive as their own interests,<br />
without regard either to the interests of the community<br />
or the observation of the law.<br />
It is that third challenge, which has been particularly<br />
instrurental-in leading the Government to the view that<br />
at this time there is a need to look closely at the<br />
management tools, the.-flexibility and the capacity of<br />
the Service as presently organised. There have been a<br />
number of administrative breakdowns which have flowed<br />
from the Service's inability to respond speedily and<br />
adequately to the challenges posed by those who seek to<br />
behave unethically or even illegally.<br />
Those in the community who cheat on their obligations to<br />
others or attempt dishonestly to evade the law, whether<br />
by evading taxation or meat inspection regulations or<br />
any other laws or regulations, not only bring dishonour<br />
on themselves: they impose real strains on the public<br />
service of this country, and on the social and economic<br />
fabric which is vital to our way of life.<br />
It is a particular tragedy that small numbers of<br />
failures by individuals who have fallen to temptation to<br />
give favours or seek favours have brought the Public<br />
Service into disrepute.<br />
The Public Service itself wants to respond to the<br />
criticisms that have been made against it..--They are not<br />
criticisms that are made against the Service as a whole<br />
but the Service as a whole is touched. by them. many<br />
public servants feel that the reputation of the Service<br />
has been badly tarnished by recent happenings and that<br />
it needs to re-establish the high reputation that it<br />
feels it has earned in the past.<br />
I would not wish what I am saying to. overshadow the very<br />
solid work that is being done in the greater part of the<br />
Public Service: it is unfortunate, but inevitable, that<br />
public attention tends to be focused on what is wrong,<br />
not on what is right. But I have said before and I say<br />
again now that I have enormous.: respect for the<br />
dedication and management skills of the Public Service,<br />
and for the people who staff it.. By world standards we<br />
have a public service of high reputation. </p>
<p>But the Public Service cannot live on its reputation and,<br />
in particular it must meet changes with adequate-. administrative<br />
responses. It is clear that the Service needs<br />
to be a jump ahead of those who seek to frustrate it in<br />
carrying out its proper functions.<br />
Both to assist in achieving this and to create the<br />
opportunity for the public to be reassured about the<br />
future of the Service, the Government proposes that<br />
there should be a report to the Government on aspects of<br />
the performance of the whole Commonwealth<br />
Ad mi ni strat ion.<br />
Both through an examination of the underlying . causes of<br />
major administrative deficiencies of the kind that have<br />
occurred in recent years, and through a wider<br />
examination of management skills and management<br />
structures throughout Commonwealth Government<br />
departments and authorities, the Review of Commonwealth<br />
Administration is to be asked<br />
to examine, report on and make recommendations in<br />
relation to the requirements for an efficient and<br />
effective public service in Australia;<br />
and in particular to identify the demands and<br />
pressures placed upon the public service, and the<br />
mechanisms, procedures and management structures<br />
which are required to enable the public service to<br />
carry out its functions, implement Government policy<br />
and deliver programmes effectively and efficiently<br />
to the people of Australia.<br />
The Review in particular should take into account:<br />
the need for-the public service to-have high<br />
standards and good morale;<br />
the need for the public service to provide the<br />
professional managerial component of public<br />
admin-istration;<br />
the need for the public service to possess<br />
management skills and to develop management<br />
structures capable of meeting and responding to the<br />
challenges of an increasingly complex business,<br />
economic and social environment;<br />
the need for the public service to provide<br />
constructive and imaginative policy advice, and<br />
adequate mechanisms for ensuring the effective<br />
implementation of the Government's policy decisions;<br />
the need for accountability of the public service </p>
<p>while maintaining the concept of a non-political<br />
career public service based on merit, capable of<br />
providing effective support for Ministers in<br />
relation to their administrative and policy-making<br />
responsibilities."<br />
Although the. Review involves a major examination of<br />
Commonwealth administration, it is not intended that it<br />
should be a protracted one. The Government accepts that<br />
in the interests of a timely completion of the Review,<br />
in some areas of concern-it may be possible only to<br />
provide indications of further work that will need to be<br />
done to achieve our ultimate objective.<br />
It is not proposed that this Review should repeat the<br />
work done by the Coombs Royal Commission, which was the<br />
first comprehensive review of government administration<br />
in over 50 years and had the broadest possible terms of<br />
reference. Nor is it proposed to duplicate the<br />
particular work done by parliamentary committees, by the<br />
Auditor-General,.-by the Public Service Board and by<br />
management consultants and others who may have examined,<br />
or be examining, particular aspects of the Service.<br />
This Review is to focus specifi cally on the management<br />
framework, the constraints which face public sector<br />
managers, and the challenges that they will have to<br />
confront in the future.<br />
The Government is looking for a report, from people of<br />
high reputation in their own business fields, which<br />
assesses what they see as the deficiencies, the problems<br />
and the appropriate remedies.<br />
Mr J. B. Reid, has accepted the role of Chairman<br />
of the Review. Mr Reid is Chairman of James Hardie<br />
Industries Limited, Vice Chairman of Qantas and a<br />
Director of BHP and Barclays International Australia<br />
Limited. He was a member of the Administrative Review<br />
Committee in 1975/ 76 ( chaired by Sir Henry Bland) and a<br />
member of the inquiry into the Commonwealth Serum<br />
Laboratories in 1978. He has been also a member of<br />
various other government bodies and currently is<br />
chairman of the Australian Bicentennial Authority.<br />
Mr Reid will -be assisted by Sir Ronald Elliott, and<br />
Professor John Rose.<br />
Sir Ronald Elliott is a Director of Brambles Industries<br />
Limited and International Commodities Clearing House<br />
Limited. He is the former Managing Director of the<br />
Commonwealth Banking Corporation. Sir Ronald has been a<br />
member of the Council of the Administrative Staff<br />
College and is a Fellow of the the Australian Institute </p>
<p>of Management.<br />
Professor Rose is Sidney Myer Professor of Commerce and<br />
Business Administration at the University of Melbourne,<br />
and since 1976 has been a Consultant in my private<br />
office. All three members of the Review are obviously well<br />
qualified for the task, and the Government is grateful<br />
to them for accepting this most important role.<br />
The Review will have full access in all areas of<br />
government administration to see and consult with<br />
whoever they determine, whether from inside or outside<br />
the Public Service and statutory authorities.<br />
The administration will have an opportunity to explain<br />
its task and its methods of carrying it out and, also,<br />
the nature of the constraints which distinguish<br />
government administration from the business world.<br />
People from outsde the administration, with substantial<br />
and established reputations in the business world, will<br />
have an opportunity to say what they think the Public<br />
Service should be doing and here the Review would be<br />
looking no doubt for positive and realistic guidance<br />
capable of being put into practical. effect.<br />
The Inquiry will be assisted by a small secretariat,<br />
headed by Mr H. B. MacDonald, Deputy Secretary in the<br />
Department of Administrative Services.<br />
Mr Reid has indicated that he would expect to be able to<br />
report before the Autumn sitting of the Parliament.<br />
As I stated earlier and as no-one in this House would<br />
deny, the people of Australia have a right to expect<br />
good, honest, efficient and effective administration in<br />
the public sector. With the assistance of this Review<br />
of Commonwealth Administration the Government is<br />
determined to see that they get it.<br />
