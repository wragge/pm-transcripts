JjAUSHA L IA Q 3<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 16 SEPTEMBER 1979<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Qver the past week the leaders of the trade union movement<br />
have shown scant regard for the people they supposedly<br />
represent the working men and women of Australia.<br />
The wages policy adopted by the ACTU Congress in Melbourne<br />
is a recipe for economic disaster. If successful, it would<br />
lead to a massive increase in the numbers of unemployed.<br />
It would push even further into the distance the time when<br />
the unemployed can be offered jobs. It ranks of the utmost<br />
foolishness and utmost selfishness.<br />
Pu t simply, what the ACTU is saying is this: " Employersand<br />
the Government should abide by the decisions of the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission leaving union.<br />
free to pursue any wage claim they want, over and above<br />
increases awarded by the Commission". This dog-in-the-manger<br />
attitude would make it even harder for employers to<br />
provide jobs.<br />
How could a union movement, supposedly concerned for the<br />
welfare of its members, put forward a plan that would deprive<br />
those very members of the~ r jobs.<br />
Let's look back in the year to March 1975, when wages went<br />
up a staggering 38 per cent in the space of 12 months. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
One can easily see that if wages go up by that much in<br />
one year, it is going to cause a great deal of. harm to<br />
Australian industry.<br />
The ACTU has caved in to the extremists. It is this<br />
left-wing element which is pushing for huge wage increases<br />
irrespective of the capacity of industry to pay. They<br />
remain blind to the simple fact that there is awell-established<br />
link between wage increases and unemployment. The two are<br />
inseparable. While the leadership may be blind, not so the rank and file;<br />
the people who understand and feel the consequences. Of 800<br />
members of the workforce questioned in a survey in May of<br />
this year, 6 out of 10 agreed that wage increases these<br />
days mean somebody else loses a job.<br />
Two out of three believed that wage increases wouldn't help.<br />
I don't believe that Australia's working men and women are<br />
as uncaring and greedy as to deny a workmate of a job.<br />
I don't believe that the " I'm all right Jack" attitude is<br />
evident to any real extent in Australian society.<br />
It is disturbing that the Labor Party has also caved in to<br />
its more radical elements and come up with a wages policy<br />
that is virtually identical and equally as disastrous as<br />
that of the ACTU's.<br />
Mr. Hayden seems to have forgotten that in February this<br />
year, in one of his more sane economic moments, he observed<br />
that" the unions must accept that the economy cannot bear<br />
unreasonable wage claims". Yet, the Labor Party now has a<br />
policy which, as a principal feature, avoids any reference<br />
to wage restraint in any shape or form. </p>
