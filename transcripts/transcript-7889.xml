TRANSCRIPT OF UNEDITED INTERVIEW WITH KEVIN HUME, RADIO<br />
6WF, PERTH, 8 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
HUME: Prime Minister, seven years in power and certainly<br />
very difficult times you've had to face. Why do you<br />
think you need more time?<br />
PM: Well, I'm yet to find anyone who believes that the<br />
0 world has stopped after seven years. We live in a<br />
rapidly changing world and what we've had to do is to<br />
take on an over 30 years of conservative inertia where no<br />
attempt was made, Kevin, to change the basic economic<br />
structure or attitudes of Australia. There is universal<br />
recognition that in the seven years we ' ye done more in<br />
the area of macro-economic reform and of micro-economic<br />
reform than has ever begun to be attempted before. We<br />
are turning this country around, we are making it more<br />
competitive. The attitudes of the workforce and of<br />
management are changing, but there's still a lot of work<br />
to do. We've got it on the right track and I want to be<br />
there to ensure that as we go now into this final decade<br />
of the 20th century, we do make all those changes of<br />
policies and, fundamentally, of attitudes and practices<br />
which is going to make Australia competitive.<br />
HlUME: The 1990s, a fresh decade some would say that<br />
the Hawke Government, what it promises for a fourth term<br />
is more of the same rather than a fresh agenda. Do you<br />
think there is sufficient freshness coming through in<br />
terms of ideas that Labor has got to promise something<br />
different? PM: Well, let's have a look at what we've achieved and<br />
whether people really don't want more of that. Let's<br />
look at employment. We've created 1.6 million new jobs<br />
and that's a rate of employment creation five times<br />
faster than when we came to Office. I would think that<br />
people would like that continuation. We've undertaken a<br />
truly revolutionary social engineering change as far as<br />
education in this country is concerned. When I came to<br />
Office the conservatives had been in power for seven<br />
years and the retention rate of kids in schools had<br />
lifted by a magnificent two percentage points, from 34 to<br />
36 percent. They went out of office leaving Australia<br />
with one of the worst retention rates in the world<br />
certainly in the developed world. Only really one in </p>
<p>three of our kids stayed on in school. I said that's<br />
going to change. I've got that up to 62 percent. In<br />
other words, they shift it from 34 to 36, I've shifted it<br />
from 36 to 62 and rising. I would think Australians<br />
would want more of that because this is the most<br />
fundamental change you can make in this country. I<br />
inherited a position where really there was a pattern of<br />
privilege on the map, on the educational map of<br />
Australia. If your kids came from Dalkeith or Vaucluse<br />
or Toorak you could be sure they were going on in school,<br />
but not if they came from the poorer or the poorer to<br />
middle suburbs. Now the stream of kids from Australia<br />
doesn't depend upon the affluence of your parents.<br />
Similarly in regard to tertiary education. In seven<br />
years they created 27,000 new places. By the end of this<br />
triennium, we'll have created almost 150,000 new tertiary<br />
places. I would imagine Australians want more of that.<br />
I'd imagine Australians want more of a situation where,<br />
when I came to Office a Professor of Economics, ANU, said<br />
of the taxation system, for the rich in this country it's<br />
a matter of choice for them as to whether they pay their<br />
taxes. Now it's recognised that we have a fair and<br />
efficient taxation system. I guess they want more of<br />
that. HUME: Many people on the Labor heartland though who are<br />
wondering whether they should vote Labor and give Labor<br />
another go in the 1990s, would argue that the 1980s has<br />
been a decade in which Labor has helped the privileged.<br />
PM: Well, they're absolutely wrong and they don't say<br />
that. That's a thing that's said by people like yourself<br />
to try and stir up a Prime Minister perhaps, but they are<br />
not saying that for the simple reason that the facts<br />
don't sustain it. In the period since we've been in<br />
Office there has been, in real terms, an increased<br />
allocation of about $ 9 billion in real terms to social<br />
justice programs unparalleled in the history of this<br />
country. In the area of kids, for instance, now over $ 2<br />
billion per annum going out in family allowances and<br />
family allowance supplements payments never happened<br />
before and I've just talked to you about a situation in<br />
regard to education where it's the kids of the poor who<br />
are now staying on in the education system where they<br />
didn't do before. So the facts belie, with respect, that<br />
nonsense. HUME: As far as the West . is concerned though, we've<br />
certainly seen the 1980s being the decade of the big<br />
entrepreneur and we're starting to see those<br />
entrepreneurs topple like<br />
PM: Some of them, Kevin.<br />
HUME: Some of them<br />
PM: Sure. </p>
<p>HUME: And the Labor Government here has been seen<br />
certainly as the friend of big business, WA Inc and all<br />
and I wonder whether, in fact, that doesn't provide<br />
sufficient disillusionment for the election to be lost<br />
here in the West.<br />
PM: No, the election will not be lost here. Won't be<br />
lost anywhere. We'll win the election and that's not<br />
said with complacency, it's because I believe the people<br />
of Western Australia are intelligent as I had cause to<br />
say yesterday. I mean, I am a Western Australian, I grew<br />
up here. I know Western Australians and I don't think<br />
they're dumb, I don't think they're stupid.<br />
HUME: But they're very disillusioned.<br />
PM: They may be disillusioned with some aspects of<br />
Labor's performance in this State, but when it gets down<br />
to the line, and Mr and Mrs Western Australia has to go<br />
into the ballot box, do you really believe he or she is<br />
going to say, ' look Peacock has promised no health policy<br />
other than the abolition of Medicare and additional<br />
expenditure we can't be quite sure of, but it might be up<br />
to $ 2.6 billion, I'm going to inflict an absolute mess<br />
and chaos of a medical system upon myself by voting in<br />
the federal election to put Peacock into Government to<br />
give us a mess in health, in education. I'm going to<br />
vote for Peacock to give billions of dollars to the, to<br />
the rich by abolishing the capital gains tax. I'm going<br />
to do that because I want to give Mr Dowding or the West<br />
Australian Labor Government a kick in the tail'. I Just<br />
don't think they're that silly.<br />
HUME: But in Thomastown surely Victorians aren't that<br />
different. What we've seen there is a massive swing away<br />
from Labor<br />
PM: But in Thomastown who was going to govern<br />
Australia federally wasn't on the table.<br />
HUME: But still straws in the wound that indicate<br />
there's a great deal of mix in peoples attitude<br />
PM: There is no doubt<br />
HUME: State and federal issues and disillusionment<br />
still?<br />
PM: There was a lot of disillusionment in Thomastown<br />
with the Victorian State Government and the Victorian<br />
Premier and the Ministers have acknowledged that. Now<br />
I'm not saying, it would be stupid for me to say, that<br />
people have been entirely happy with the fact that<br />
they've had to have high interest rates. But again, I<br />
think the Australian electorate is intelligent. They<br />
know Bob Hawke. They know that I'm neither, as I've put<br />
it, a masochist or a sadist. I don't want to hurt<br />
myself. I haven't had high interest rates for fun to </p>
<p>hurt me. I haven't had them to be a sadist to hurt the<br />
people of Australia. The fact is that Australians have<br />
been consuming more than they are producing and that's<br />
flowed over into a level of imports that was<br />
unsustainable. So we had to slow things down. It wasn't<br />
as though we just relied on tight monetary policy we<br />
had the tightest fiscal policy in the history of the<br />
country, we had tight wages policy and we had to have<br />
tight monetary policy to go with it. Now, it's working<br />
and things are easing of f, but still there is a bit of a<br />
residual there but when the chips are down do you<br />
think they are going to say we' re so unhappy about<br />
the fact that Mr Hawke had to do that that we're going<br />
to, as I say, vote for Mr Peacock, the abolition of<br />
Medicare, the reversion to a pattern of privilege where<br />
health policy will be determined by how you put more<br />
money into the pockets of the private health funds and<br />
the doctors rather than looking after the people and<br />
education is going to be a return to a situation where it<br />
depends upon the wealth of your parents whether you stay<br />
on in school or go to university'. They' re not going to<br />
do those sorts of things.<br />
HUME: But the cost surely of tightening monetary<br />
policy, for example, and the slow down in the economy<br />
which the Government obviously wants is going to be,<br />
surely, more people out of work for example and less<br />
revenue for the Government to provide the sort of<br />
services that allow for the social justice agenda that<br />
you're talking about.<br />
PM: Kevin, with respect my dear friend, that's the<br />
most facile exposition of economic analysis I've ever<br />
heard in my life because it carries an assumption that<br />
there is an alternative that we as a country can say to<br />
the rest of the world thank you world, we know world<br />
that you will look at us and say that we're not producing<br />
as much as we want to consume and therefore world you are<br />
going to continue to supply the balance of what we can't<br />
produce ourselves, but we want to consume. And the world<br />
is going to say to us that's alright Australia, you're a<br />
special case, we love your sun-bronzed country. We love<br />
your surfing beaches, we love you Anzac people, so we're<br />
going to have different rules for you Aussies, different<br />
rules for you. Now don't be silly. That's not the way<br />
the world works.<br />
HUME: I'm not suggesting that at. all. What I'm<br />
suggesting to you is that, as far as local voters are<br />
concerned, they think essentially with their hip pockets<br />
PM: Don't you see<br />
HUME: They look around and see, are there jobs for their<br />
kids PM: Look, my friend </p>
<p>HUME: Are interest rates high<br />
PM: My friend<br />
HUME: Are the services there?<br />
PM: All I can say, my friend Kevin, is that you regard<br />
your fellow Australians and your West Australians with a<br />
contempt that I don't. I just think, as distinct from<br />
you obviously by your question, unless you're trying to<br />
be funny<br />
HlUME: I wouldn't say that at all.<br />
PM: You do because you are saying that they have not got<br />
the intelligence or the capacity to understand the<br />
necessity of what's happening What you're saying, you<br />
read your transcript, they're going to punish Bob Hawke<br />
and his Government because they've made things at this<br />
stage with high interest rates, a bit tough. That they<br />
can't have all the things at the relatively cheap price<br />
that they could have before and we're going to be<br />
punished for that. I simply say to you I have a higher,<br />
a much higher assessment of the intelligence of your<br />
fellow West Australians and Australians, than you have.<br />
HUME: OK, let's have a look at another matter. That is<br />
the revolution that this Government has put forward in<br />
the workplace. Award restructuring and all of that<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
HlUME: Again profound changes, changes of attitude that<br />
you talked about at the beginning of our discussion. How<br />
much patience do you think there is within the workforce<br />
to accept that radical change within the constraints of<br />
very tight wage limits?<br />
PM: Well you've got to sort of look at, when you're<br />
asked that question about what's happened to, not just<br />
wages, but to real household disposable income. In other<br />
words the welfare of a family is not just determined by<br />
the wage they get. Now just let me give you a couple of<br />
statistics, just to without swamping you with them, but<br />
which are important to understand that point, Kevin. if<br />
you look at the last two completed years and the<br />
financial year we're in. That's 87/ 88, 88/ 89, 89/ 90. In<br />
87/ 88, Kevin, the average weekly-earnings went up by 6.6<br />
percent and it's true CPI went up by a bit more went up<br />
by 7.3 percent so real earnings declined, but real<br />
household disposable income went up by 3.6 percent. In<br />
other words that reflected the improvements in income<br />
which came from a combination of more employment, greater<br />
social service payments and changes in the tax<br />
system. So that was 3.6 increase in real disposable<br />
income, household disposable income in that year, despite<br />
a slightly lower level of real wages. The next year<br />
88/ 89, same sort of pattern, earning 7 percent increase, </p>
<p>CPI 7.4, so real earnings down a bit but real household<br />
disposable income up by 3.5 percent. Current financial<br />
year, 89/ 90, what looks like being the picture for this<br />
financial year is same sort of thing earnings up by 7<br />
percent, prices up by 7.5, so real earnings down a bit,<br />
but real household disposable income up by 4-percent.<br />
Because, if you look at this here, what we brought in<br />
in June was this massive improvement in disposable income<br />
by the very, very significant tax cuts. So if you<br />
combine tax cuts and the increase in earnings, you had<br />
the income of the family increasing by very, very much<br />
more than, than prices. And that's what we can offer<br />
to the people of Australia. We have got a relatively<br />
tight wages policy, but it's because we've had a tight<br />
wages policy that we've had employment growth of 1.6<br />
million. You can't have everything. I could have had a<br />
wages policy when I came in which is a massive real<br />
increase in wages would have had it for a year or two,<br />
but then, collapse. That's what happened in the last<br />
years of the other mob. They abolished centralised wage<br />
control, you had a massive wage blowout and you had the<br />
worst recession you've had for 50 years, unemployment<br />
grew by a quarter of a million in their last 12 months.<br />
So, sure, if you want to say we'll have massive real<br />
increase in wages, beaut<br />
HUME: So<br />
PM: Delude yourself that you'll have it for 12 months,<br />
but you destroy the system.<br />
HUME: OK, just one indicator then for families<br />
themselves. PM: Yes.<br />
HUME: Need they fear that more of their members will be<br />
out of work in a year's time or not?<br />
PM: No, no. We will have, and it's generally accepted<br />
that what we are aiming at we're likely to get. That's a<br />
soft landing. A soft landing really means that we will<br />
retain economic growth and we will retain employment<br />
growth, but it won't be as massive a rate of employment<br />
growth that we've had before. The average rate of<br />
employment growth over the seven year period that we've<br />
been in Office is 3.5 percent per annum which is very<br />
high. We've had a rate-of-employment growth which is<br />
twice as fast as the rest of the world. We won't keep on<br />
doing that in the immediate period ahead, but it will<br />
still be growth.<br />
HUME: So another key indicator to many in our community,<br />
the question of child poverty which you, an issue you<br />
obviously feel very strongly about.<br />
PM: I do indeed. </p>
<p>HUME: The pledge in 1987 that by 1990 no Australian<br />
child-PM: No financial need.<br />
HUME: Yes, need not live in poverty.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
HUME: Same time we've seen yesterday, for example, the<br />
Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Councils of Social<br />
Service across Australia launch yet another campaign to<br />
remind Australians that there are, by their count at<br />
least, 450,000 young Australians living in poverty. How<br />
do you regard that?<br />
PM: Well, let me first of all give you the quotes of<br />
what these organisations have said about the promise I<br />
made. Last year Bishop Hollingworth in the George Syme<br />
Oration, 7 May, ' In strict income security terms, it's<br />
true that the Prime Minister's promise, Prime Ministerial<br />
promise that no children shall live in poverty by 1990<br />
will be achieved. This represents significant<br />
progress'. 4 May, the Brotherhood of St Laurence ' this<br />
pledge the most significant social commitment of the<br />
century has been the subject of an historic package. We<br />
congratulate the Federal Government on its work, an<br />
historic breakthrough the solid foundation<br />
HUME: But for<br />
PM: Now wait a minute. I'm not avoiding that. But<br />
so you see that everyone that's in this area has said<br />
that the promise has been delivered. Australian<br />
Institute of Family Studies, May 1989, ' by these means<br />
the Government's pledge to meet the benchmarks has been<br />
met'. In other words, what we did, and it's important<br />
that understand and say that we will ensure that<br />
there be no financial need and we didn't just pluck these<br />
figures out of the air. We sat down and consulted with<br />
these people themselves, with the social welfare lobby<br />
and we said now, what's the way in which a Government can<br />
do what it must do on behalf of the community to meet a<br />
pledge that there'll be no financial need for the kids to<br />
live in poverty. They said well, we'll have to have<br />
these payments as a proportion of the pension. They<br />
worked out the proportion that would be necessary so I<br />
said, we'll deliver that and delivered it ahead of<br />
schedule. We're doing it by, let me say, a financial<br />
outlay of over $ 2 billion a year. Now, that did not mean<br />
that you weren't going to have a situation where there<br />
wouldn't be children living in poverty for a whole range<br />
of reasons outside the fact that we were delivering on<br />
our pledge. And that's why I met with the social welfare<br />
people last year. What we've agreed to do is to meet<br />
together, with the States now, and with other<br />
organisations, and that meeting will be on 15 February.<br />
There we are going to see what are the sorts of things </p>
<p>that we need to do in our areas of service delivery,<br />
which are partly the Commonwealth, partly the States, and<br />
in combination with community organisations to deal with<br />
the areas of poverty that exist. Because you're still<br />
going to have that despite the fact that we make the<br />
money available to the parents. If the kids have left<br />
home, run away, well the fact that money is going to the<br />
parent in that situation doesn't mean that the kid is not<br />
going to be somewhere in poverty. You've got to bring<br />
governments of all types together, of all levels<br />
together, to deal with this. I really think that the<br />
most important comment that's been made about this, and<br />
it's an absolute indictment of the Opposition, is again<br />
what Hollingworth said on 22 August ' 89. He said this;<br />
' the Government's made real advances in recent years in<br />
building a more secure and adequate system of income<br />
support for Australians living close to or below the<br />
poverty line.' And this is what he then said, and this<br />
should stick in the mind and may I say the craw of<br />
Peacock and these people who are trying to make some<br />
cheap line out of this situation. He said, this is<br />
Hollingworth, ' These reforms are too important to be<br />
caught in the crossfire of political conflict. The<br />
Opposition ought to openly acknowledge the merit of such<br />
reforms and move towards a more bipartisan stance on<br />
welfare policies for children.' And that's the truth of<br />
it. HUME: Politics obviously is very much still the art of<br />
the Governments must move as popular pressure to<br />
some extent dictates. The 1980s, as I've indicated<br />
earlier, is seen by many as the decade of greed. Some in<br />
fact have seen it as the decade of the revenge of the<br />
rich on the poor. I wonder whether the 1990s you see is<br />
a decade in which Labor's social agenda greater<br />
priority. There might<br />
PM: That's not<br />
0 HUME: for greater regulation what's more of the<br />
business sector.<br />
PM: This crap, if I may, to coin a phrase. The revenge<br />
of the rich upon the poor. How do you reconcile that<br />
with the facts? I mean I know when people use phrases<br />
like that facts are a bit of an uncomfortable thing that<br />
you don't like to deal with. But just let me put the<br />
factsup in terms of what the Government can do in regard<br />
to the decade, because it's been our decade. The revenge<br />
of the rich upon the poor. How do you reconcile that<br />
with the fact that when I came to office and now,<br />
comparing that, there's been a move from 50% to 59% in<br />
the proportion of Government outlays, excluding payment<br />
of interest on debt. From 50% to 59% on social justice<br />
programs which involves what I said, in real terms, an<br />
increase of over $ 9 billion. That's what the pattern of<br />
the 80s has been under my Government. That's totally </p>
<p>inconsistent with this nonsense you've just been talking<br />
about.<br />
HUME: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Now wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br />
You've had your exposition Kevin. You've explained that<br />
it's said that this is the decade of the revenge of the<br />
rich upon the poor. Now you're going to let me, with<br />
respect, answer that nonsense. Because the facts which<br />
get in the way of that need to be put out. And I'm just<br />
telling you, in the period ' 83 to the end of the decade,<br />
an increase from 50% to 59% in the proportion of total<br />
Commonwealth Government outlays to the poor. And how has<br />
that happened? It's because in that period I've imposed<br />
in part it's happened because I've made the rich pay<br />
their taxes. When I came to office Professor Russell<br />
Matthews said, as I put to you, said it was a matter of<br />
choice as to whether the rich paid their taxes. That was<br />
before Hawke. It is not now a matter of choice. If you<br />
want to talk about revenge upon the rich, under this<br />
Government, I've taken the revenge in the sense for too<br />
long, after 30 years of conservative government, the rich<br />
had it as a matter of choice or option whether they paid<br />
their tax. Not now, because I've abolished the haven of<br />
the rich, the protection of the rich, where they could<br />
accumulate income through capital accretion and not pay a<br />
cent of tax. Now, through the 80s, by the end of this<br />
decade, they will, and into the last decade of the<br />
the rich who had the haven will now pay billions of<br />
dollars in tax that they didn't pay before. They accrued<br />
benefits before through fringe benefits which they didn't<br />
pay any tax upon. I abolished that. So if you're<br />
talking about the 80s being the revenge of the rich upon<br />
the poor, I mean it's a lovely phrase to roll off the<br />
tongue in the ABC studios<br />
HUME: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: So why don't you look at the facts?<br />
HUME: If I may simply just add one comment as a<br />
postscript to that point of discussion. A comment by a<br />
far more emminent gentleman than myself, John Kennett<br />
Galbraith, looking across a whole range of Western<br />
economies PM: But. you didn't-<br />
HUME: including Australia.<br />
PM: Yes, but the people listening to you when you rolled<br />
it of f may have been excused that you were talking about<br />
Australia. I don't have the responsibility my dear<br />
friend Kevin for the rest of the Western world. I have<br />
had in the 80s the responsibility for Australia. And if<br />
there is one phrase that you couldn't use about Australia<br />
in the 80s under Hawke, that it was the revenge of the </p>
<p>rich upon the poor, when I've hit the rich who were<br />
protected after 30 years of conservative government.<br />
Because you quote your Galbraith about the rest of the<br />
world, I'll quote your Matthews. The foremost authority,<br />
I repeat what Matthews of Australia said about Australia,<br />
not the rest of the Western world. Before Hawke a matter<br />
of choice whether the rich paid their taxes. Not after<br />
Hawke. HUME: Ok, let's take up another matter then.<br />
PM: I hope so.<br />
HUME: Of revenge, if we may. And that's revenge close<br />
at hand it would seem for the many areas of WA Inc that<br />
Peter Dowding is likely to suffer.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
HUME: It's said that you've endorsed Carmen Lawrence as<br />
his successor. Have you?<br />
PM: No Kevin, I haven't. I'd invite you mate to have a<br />
look at the whole transcript. Now there was an attempt<br />
by the media, and if I'd been sitting where they were and<br />
looking at Hawke I would've tried to nail him. What<br />
I had to do, and I hope I did it successfully, was say<br />
look I can't enter into this decision. Nor should I.<br />
It's a matter for the State Parliamentary party. And I<br />
said really that's where it's got to be. I was asked a<br />
question about did I know Carmen Lawrence? I do. What<br />
did I know about her? I said from what I know of Carmen<br />
she looks a capable no-nonsense sort of person. But<br />
really Kevin I can't be coming in and patting either one<br />
of them on the back. It's now a declared contest to be<br />
settled on Monday. It's a matter for the State<br />
Parliamentary party.<br />
HUME: It would certainly help if Peter Dowding went, as<br />
far as your own re-election chances were concerned though<br />
wouldn't it?<br />
PM: We will win the Australian federal election for some<br />
of the reasons Kevin that we've been talking about.<br />
We'll win I think. I'm not being cocky or complacent<br />
about that. But we deserve to win for a lot of the<br />
reasons I've been talking with you about and also the<br />
inadequacies of the alternative. I, for the reasons I've<br />
put to you, don't think West Australians are essentially<br />
going to be different in their approach to who should<br />
govern them federally than the rest of Australia.<br />
HUME: You must be concerned though at the prospect, and<br />
the very real prospect, whoever leads the Labor Party,<br />
the Labor Government here in the West, that the<br />
Opposition will combine its numbers in the Upper House<br />
and force supply. It always causes a nasty taint in the </p>
<p>mouth, if you like, for Labor people with sort of long<br />
memories back to Whitlam.<br />
PM: Yes well it's a very<br />
HUME: Is that a real prospect? Do you see yourself<br />
something that you fear?<br />
PM: I don't know. I don't know about the Opposition<br />
parties here. What I do know is we probably have the<br />
continuing hypocrisy of conservatism which has been their<br />
characteristic over the ages. And that is that if you<br />
want always to find the mouthing of commitment to<br />
propriety, to law and order, to principle, go to the<br />
rhetoric of the Liberals and the National Party. That's<br />
where the rhetoric will pour out about how we as a<br />
society must be committed to principle. But as soon as<br />
they see the possibility of breaking every convention and<br />
principle about allowing elected governments to govern<br />
then the temptation becomes almost overwhelming for them.<br />
Although I say to the credit of Hendy Cowan here in<br />
Western Australia to this point that he has put principle<br />
before opportunism. And-I haven't any reason,<br />
personally, to believe that he'll change that.<br />
HUME: So is the Labor Government lost here do you think,<br />
or not?<br />
PM: No, I certainly don't believe that at all.<br />
HUME: You don't think that Western Australians, not<br />
withstanding your comments about their undoubted<br />
intelligence, are so dissatisfied here with Labor here in<br />
the West that they may welcome the chance to throw the<br />
Labor Government out?<br />
PM: In the State? I think that they would say, no, if<br />
the time, in the normal function time when it came for a<br />
proper election, if at that time they were dissatisfied<br />
with the State Labor Government they may make that<br />
decision. But there's quite a long way before that<br />
proper effluction of time. I would believe that the<br />
State party Kevin would have the good sense to understand<br />
that there's some level of concern about their<br />
performance to this date. And after all they've only run<br />
just over a year haven't they of this term of office.<br />
There's plenty of time I would think for them to improve<br />
their. performance. Because-you-see-elections are not<br />
just about making a judgement about one side. It's<br />
obviously true that there's dissatisfaction in this State<br />
about the performance of the State Government. They<br />
acknowledge that themselves. But when the time comes,<br />
the proper time comes at the end of the fourth period of<br />
the Parliament, then, as I say, two things will have<br />
happened. I think they will have lifted their game and<br />
dealt with issues of concern and then people will have to<br />
make a judgement about that, whether they've lifted their<br />
game. And they'll also have to make a judgement about </p>
<p>12<br />
the alternative. If you look at the conservative parties<br />
in Australia today it's a pretty unattractive prospect.<br />
HUME: You're obviously enjoying the political..<br />
PM: Love it.<br />
HUME: Could I put to you the comments of Andrew<br />
Peacock that a vote this time at the coming federal<br />
election for Bob Hawke is a vote for Paul Keating. To<br />
which Mr Keating responded a vote for Andrew Peacock is a<br />
vote for Andrew Peacock. Is it as simple as that?<br />
PM: Well these days Andrew unfortunately can very rarely<br />
get anything right. His own party is appalled at his<br />
performance. The Liberal Party throughout Australia is<br />
full of despair about Andrew. It's not surprising. I<br />
don't want to add to his problems. But that's a fact.<br />
And in that situation he's saying some very silly things.<br />
The fact is that I will lead the Labor Party in this<br />
election, I hope and believe, to victory. And I will go<br />
the full term as I have said for some time. Now Andrew<br />
thinks that he perceives that Paul is not as well-liked<br />
out there as I am. So he's trying to say because he<br />
can't produce a health policy, he can't produce any<br />
policies of his own. So what's he got to do? He's got<br />
to fear, scare people. You might like Bob but Bob's not<br />
going to be around for three years. It's going to be<br />
Paul. Good try Andrew old boy, but like most of the<br />
things, you're talking nonsensical hot air boyo. Now try<br />
and put your time into getting a health policy together.<br />
Something like that.<br />
HUME: So at the moment of maximum advantage, is it<br />
time now to call a federal election? You<br />
PM: I've enjoyed the program with you. It's been very<br />
good.<br />
HUME: But you're not going to tell me?<br />
PM: I think you should be rewarded in some way. I'll<br />
get you a cup of coffee afterwards. But I can't give you<br />
the real coup of announcing the election date. No.<br />
HUME: Mr Hawke, thank you for joining us.<br />
PM: It's been a pleasure. Thank you Kevin.<br />
