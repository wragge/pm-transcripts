PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 23 SEPTEMBER, 1979<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The Commonwealth Statistician gave the nation some<br />
encouraging news this week with the publication of figures<br />
showing that food prices are evening out.<br />
In fact, the CPI food index for August fell by 0.6 of<br />
1 per cent.<br />
This, of course, does not mean that the fight against<br />
inflation has been won. Far from it.<br />
Several cost and price increases are already in the pipeline.<br />
They will mean that the CPI for the September, and<br />
particularly the December quarters, will inevitably rise.<br />
The Ju ne national wage decision, oil prices increasing sharply<br />
in July, and the sharp rise in the price of beef and other<br />
-meats have affected the CPI.<br />
The key point to be remembered is that these price increases<br />
have already occurred, even though they will continue to<br />
affect the CPI through the remainder of the calendar year.<br />
Although the next few months will see inflation edge up<br />
again, the downward trend that Australia has now enjoyed<br />
for some time should reassert itself in the new year.<br />
That will come about because the Government is-firmy.-<br />
resolved in continuing with anti-inflationary policies--<br />
policies that are paying off.<br />
One has only to glance at the business pages of the daily<br />
newspapers to see the renewed enthusiasm in the Australian<br />
financial world. Large scale investment is taking off with<br />
millions of dollars tagged for projects right around the nation.<br />
They are the projects that will provide sound, rewarding jobs<br />
for the working men and women of Australia.<br />
One of the things that has been of great benefit to Australia<br />
is that we have been able to keep our inflation rate below<br />
that of most other industrialised western nations. We have not<br />
sat back and blamed overseas developments. They are a fact of<br />
life we have faced up to them, and are carrying out policies<br />
that minimise the damage they cause. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
In an earlier period, under Labor, inflation in Australia<br />
shot up to 17 per cent levels 5 points above the average<br />
of the and caused by policies pursued in Australia.<br />
In the last 6 months, with an inflation rate ' round 9 per cent,<br />
we are doing much better than the O. E. C. D. nearly<br />
3 points below their average.<br />
We are not suffering the agonies of Britain and the United States.<br />
In Britain over the past 6 months inflation has been running<br />
at annual rates around 22 per cent in the United States<br />
at about 14 per cent.<br />
In this climate our manufacturers and our exporters have an<br />
increasing competitive edge both in Australia and<br />
in overseas markets.<br />
The Much improved international competitiveness of Australian<br />
industry is demonstrated by the rise of 16 per cent in the<br />
volume of manufactured exports in 1978-79.<br />
And because of our almost unequalled natural resources, our<br />
great mineral wealth and because of our lower inflation<br />
we are attracting more than our share of investment.<br />
Overall, more than $ 13 billion worth of investment in mining<br />
and manufacturing are ready to go forward in Australia.<br />
That's a real sign of confidence as hard-headed investors show<br />
their faith in our country. We are, in short, seeing the<br />
benefits of the Government's sustained responsibility in<br />
economic policy.<br />
At the* same time, let me recognise quite frankly that some<br />
economic problems persist. The outlook is for a subdued world<br />
economy and Australia cannot expect to be completely immune<br />
from the consequences.<br />
Nevertheless, we are in-a much sounder position than most of<br />
the industrialised world to withstand those difficulties<br />
and to make the most of the opportunities on offer.<br />
One economic lesson we have learned from the decade of the<br />
is crystal clear: nations plagued by high inflation<br />
do little to enhance the welfare of their peoples.<br />
That's why it's in the interests of all Australians and<br />
not just business that we keep on with firm<br />
economic management. It is a responsibility we will not shirk.<br />
