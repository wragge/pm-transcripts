<p>E&amp;OE..................</p>
<p>  Well thank you very much Dr Sharman Stone, the Member for Murray, to Mrs</p>
<p>   Anne McCamish, to Professor Alan Gilbert, the Vice Chancellor of the University</p>
<p>   of Melbourne, to Mr Paul Griggs, and may I say to you Paul thank you very</p>
<p>   much for your words of welcome and I reciprocate by sending my warm respects</p>
<p>   and regards to the Yorta Yorta people who you are representing here today</p>
<p>   and it is very important the involvement of the indigenous community in</p>
<p>   this and indeed in many other community projects and to Professor David</p>
<p>   Simmons who is the inaugural overlord, if I can put it at that, of this</p>
<p>   venture to which I am turning the first sod today.</p>
<p>  This as I have indicated to other audiences over the last few hours is my</p>
<p>   first visit to Shepparton as Prime Minister and it is a major regional centre</p>
<p>   by any measurement in Australia, not just in Victoria, with a population</p>
<p>   in the immediate city vicinity of 30 000 and much larger in the more broadly</p>
<p>   defined Goulburn Valley area. It makes a major contribution to the economy</p>
<p>   not only of Victoria but through, in particular but not only it's horticultural</p>
<p>   industries, a major contribution to the economy of Australia. It is properly</p>
<p>   described as something of a food basket for the entire Australian community</p>
<p>   and it has a very energetic Parliamentary representative in the person of</p>
<p>   Dr Sharman Stone who has been very active in the three and a quarter years</p>
<p>   that she has been your member in pushing the particular challenges and the</p>
<p>   particular causes of this area.</p>
<p>  I think we all know that in Australia at the moment there is a properly</p>
<p>   intense debate about the position and future of rural and regional communities</p>
<p>   within our national life. I don't think there would be an Australian who</p>
<p>   would dispute that part of the history, the essence and the being of the</p>
<p>   Australian identity is the contribution that has been made to that identity</p>
<p>   by what is variously described as rural Australia, regional Australia or</p>
<p>   more affectionately "the bush" and over the years it has made</p>
<p>   an enormous contribution to shaping our national identity and it has also</p>
<p>   made an enormous and it continues to make a great contribution to the wealth</p>
<p>   of our country particularly to our export income.</p>
<p>  Earlier this morning I visited the largest pear producer in Australia and</p>
<p>   this marvellous enterprise built on the back of a family business is an</p>
<p>   example of the expertise and the skill of this district and the importance</p>
<p>   of it. But rural communities and regional communities and Shepparton, although</p>
<p>   larger than many has not been in anyway exempt or has not escaped the process,</p>
<p>   has felt the pressure of the relocation of services, has experienced the</p>
<p>   pressure of some services disappearing and has felt the pressure particularly</p>
<p>   of declining availability of medical services and it was identified when</p>
<p>   we came into Government as being an issue that needed a great deal of attention.</p>
<p>   There was a chronic problem and there remains a chronic problem in attracting</p>
<p>   enough doctors to rural areas of Australia. There are a variety of reasons</p>
<p>   and there are many under this tent who will understand the reasons for that</p>
<p>   better than I do but the Government does understand that it is a major challenge</p>
<p>   and over the last few years we have set about responding to that challenge</p>
<p>   because we believe that the quality of life of people in any part of the</p>
<p>   community is based on the ready availability of some basic services, based</p>
<p>   on a ready availability of police services, the ready availability of educational</p>
<p>   services, the ready availability of medical services and the ready availability</p>
<p>   of some, at least recreational services. When one or other of those services</p>
<p>   are not available and particularly medical services then people are entitled</p>
<p>   to claim that they are not being treated fairly and equally as part of the</p>
<p>   Australian community. There are a lot of advantages of living in the bush</p>
<p>   or regional Australia over living in the cities but there are also disadvantages</p>
<p>   and the role of any Government in a fair way is to try and equalise the</p>
<p>   opportunities and equalise the comforts. We are keen to do that in relation</p>
<p>   to information technology, we don't want a society where you have technology</p>
<p>   haves and have nots and we have had a number of initiatives particularly</p>
<p>   out of the proceeds of the sale of the first instalment of Telstra to ensure</p>
<p>   that that has happened. In relation to the problem of the shortage of Doctors</p>
<p>   we have put a lot of effort into that. We have put extra resources, we have</p>
<p>   introduced new schemes which are designed to attract more doctors through</p>
<p>   a variety of devises attract more doctors to both go to the bush and to</p>
<p>   stay in the bush.</p>
<p>  Recently Dr Wooldridge, the Health Minister, himself a medical practitioner</p>
<p>   and John Anderson, the newly appointed Deputy Prime Minister and leader</p>
<p>   of the Federal Parliamentary National Party went on a tour of rural areas</p>
<p>   to listen to the concerns of people and to explain to those people what</p>
<p>   the Government was doing in response. In many ways that visit was something</p>
<p>   of a watershed in producing both a deeper understanding on the part of the</p>
<p>   Government of the feeling of people in rural communities and also on the</p>
<p>   part of the rural communities, a deeper understanding on their part that</p>
<p>   the Government had indeed over the past few years been doing a number of</p>
<p>   quite practical things to try and turn around the drift of doctors away</p>
<p>   from rural areas and to try and get more of them back to where they are</p>
<p>   so sorely needed and to address in some way in the process the over supply</p>
<p>   of doctors in many of the metropolitan areas of Australia by addressing</p>
<p>   the under supply of doctors in rural areas.</p>
<p>  Now one of the elements of that strategy has been to encourage the establishment</p>
<p>   around Australia of centres which focus on rural health and rural health</p>
<p>   problems. And the Federal government is providing on a recurrent basis funding</p>
<p>   of $1.5 million over five years for this project, and it's also providing</p>
<p>   capital support of $2.5 million.</p>
<p>  I want to thank the University of Melbourne who's represented here today</p>
<p>   by Vice Chancellor Professor Alan Gilbert, as well as the other universities</p>
<p>   that are involved, the other Victorian universities that are involved in</p>
<p>   the consortium which is associated with the school. What this school will</p>
<p>   do will be to address very directly the, I guess, accumulation of deficiencies</p>
<p>   and shortages as far as rural health is concerned. Not only the shortage</p>
<p>   of doctors but also some of the challenges of which Sharman Stone spoke</p>
<p>   in her words of introduction. It is not of course the final total answer</p>
<p>   to the problem but it is another element of the integrated response that</p>
<p>   is needed. What it does do of course is bring together the contributions</p>
<p>   of the Federal government, the State government, the universities of Victoria,</p>
<p>   the local communities in every sense of the word. Not only the local medical</p>
<p>   fraternity but all others involved as health professionals, the local indigenous</p>
<p>   community, it brings together as indicated by this audience today a cross</p>
<p>   section of the entire community of Shepparton. And I hope it is seen as</p>
<p>   not only a symbol, but also a very practical gesture by all of those who</p>
<p>   are concerned about addressing the problems and deficiencies of rural health.</p>
<p>  Having said something for a few minutes about problems and deficiencies</p>
<p>   in the health area, could I by way of balance and perspective say something</p>
<p>   about the pluses of the health system, not only of Victoria but the health</p>
<p>   system of Australia. It's very fashionable these days whenever anybody occupying</p>
<p>   a political position on either side of politics gets in front of a microphone</p>
<p>   to say something critical about the Australian health system. Now I would</p>
<p>   be the first to acknowledge as Prime Minister that the Australian health</p>
<p>   system does have deficiencies. It has shortages of doctors in some parts</p>
<p>   of Australia, it has some deficiencies in public hospitals, it has weaknesses</p>
<p>   in many areas. But having acknowledged all of that, I make so bold as to</p>
<p>   assert that with all its deficiencies the Australian health system is probably</p>
<p>   better than any other in the world.</p>
<p>  And I think it's very important that we don't allow the Australian health</p>
<p>   system and the esteem the Australian public has for the Australian health</p>
<p>   system to be cut down in the cross fire of endless political exchange because</p>
<p>   we have without doubt, given the size of our population, made a greater</p>
<p>   contribution than virtually any other western nation to medical research.</p>
<p>   We have world class doctors, we have world class medical researchers. And</p>
<p>   I'm very proud of the fact that in the last budget the government announced</p>
<p>   that over the next five years it would double the amount of money going</p>
<p>   to health and medical research in this country. And here particularly in</p>
<p>   Victoria, Melbourne has an absolutely marvellous reputation for its research</p>
<p>   capacity without peer anywhere in Australia, and certainly widely respected</p>
<p>   around the world.</p>
<p>  I frequently say that it's better if you're a battler to get sick in Broadmeadow</p>
<p>   than the Bronx. And the reality is that our health system with all its flaws</p>
<p>   and all its deficiencies is an infinitely better system than any on offer.</p>
<p>   We have dedicated health professionals, compassionate hard working nurses,</p>
<p>   and people generally who work together in a very cooperative fashion. Now</p>
<p>   that is not the refrain of the complacent, and it's not a Prime Minister</p>
<p>   saying everything in the garden is lovely, because everything in the garden</p>
<p>   is not lovely and there is a place for a legitimate ongoing debate about</p>
<p>   the status of our health system. We as a government remain committed to</p>
<p>   maintaining the Medicare system. That is absolute and unqualified. We believe</p>
<p>   that it can be built on. We believe that there is a role for private provision</p>
<p>   in health. We believe that the two should complement each other. There are</p>
<p>   imbalances and there are always changes and improvements that need to be</p>
<p>   made. We've put more resources into private health insurance. We think that's</p>
<p>   a positive move and we think over time that will make a contribution. We</p>
<p>   have increased resources to the Australian States in relation to their responsibilities.</p>
<p>   We don't ourselves see enormous merit in yet another wide ranging national</p>
<p>   inquiry. I think the Australian community is a little tired of endless inquiries.</p>
<p>   They're more interested in specific actions and specific initiatives such</p>
<p>   as the centre for which I'm going to turn the first sod today.</p>
<p>  So ladies and gentlemen, in acknowledging that there are a lot of problems,</p>
<p>   and I do acknowledge that. And I acknowledge particularly the legitimate</p>
<p>   concern, even anger of people in rural and regional Australia about the</p>
<p>   inadequacies of some medical services. I want on the other hand to extol</p>
<p>   some of the generic strengths of the Australian health system and to support</p>
<p>   the magnificent quality of the doctors and the other health professionals</p>
<p>   of Australia because they are in my view, without peer anywhere in Australia.</p>
<p>  But finally can I again congratulate all of those associated with this project.</p>
<p>   Can I thank Professor Alan Gilbert in particular for being here today and</p>
<p>   representing the University of Melbourne, and the contribution of the universities</p>
<p>   of Victoria to this project. I wish all of those associated with it well.</p>
<p>   I agree with Sharman Stone that we should provide inducements for those</p>
<p>   who work here not to slip back to Melbourne at the weekend and that is why</p>
<p>   it's appropriate that I turn a sod for the accommodation wing so that there'll</p>
<p>   be the proper wherewithal to entice them to remain in this beautiful community.</p>
<p>   And again can I thank the people of Shepparton for their very warm welcome.</p>
<p>   It's a delight to be in the Goulburn Valley, and I know that I should perhaps</p>
<p>   have brought some of that Sydney rain with which I am reasonably well familiar.</p>
<p>   But I hope that that turns to your advantage before too long and thank you</p>
<p>   again for having me with you.</p>
<p>  [Ends]</p>
