INCR-ASE TV AUSTRALIAN QUOTA<br />
The Prime Minister and ' Icting Treasurer said<br />
today that Australia had formally consented to an increase<br />
of % 0100 million in its quota in the International Monetary<br />
Fund and had now taken steps to make the necessary subscription.<br />
The increase in Australia's quota from<br />
8400 million to $ 500 million was approved by Parliament<br />
in May this year and is part of a general increase of<br />
per cent in the quotas of all member-countries of the<br />
Fund. To secure this higlher quota, Australia needs<br />
to make a corresponding su'. scription to the Fund of<br />
$ 100 million of which $ 25 million is payable in gold and<br />
the remainder in Australian currency. The gold subscription<br />
of 825 million ( L~ A1l. 2 million) was paid to the Fund on<br />
Wednesday, 29th September. The Australian currency portion<br />
takes the form of a non-negotiable note whaich enables the<br />
Fund, in certain circumstances, to use Australian currency<br />
in its transactions. The gold payment to the Fund involves a corresponding<br />
fall in Australia's holdings of gold and foreign exchange.<br />
On the other hand, the enlarged quota will increase Australia's<br />
drawing rights in the Fund ( our second-line reserves) from<br />
$ 525 million to $ 650 million. The increase in the quota<br />
will become effective when members having not less than<br />
two-thirds of the total quotas in the Fund have consented<br />
formally to their quota increases. This requirement is<br />
expected to be fulfilled in the near future.<br />
The Prime Minister added that one-third of the<br />
gold required for this transaction had been provided from </p>
<p>-2<br />
the Reserve Bank's gold holdings and that the Reserve Bank<br />
had utilised portion of its sterling and dollar holdings to<br />
purchase the remairning two-thirds in equal proportions from<br />
the United Kingdom and the United States. In deciding to<br />
adopt this course, the Government had been influenced by<br />
the fact that Australia's gold holdings were relatively modest<br />
and that the Fu~ nd is prepared to make arrangements to mitigate<br />
the effects on the two reserve currency countries of sales of<br />
gold which they might make to other countries for purposes<br />
of the general quota increases.<br />
