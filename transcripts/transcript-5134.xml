INTERVIEW WITH REV. NEIL ADCOCK, 6PR, PERTH<br />
( TELEPHONE-INTERVIEW)<br />
QUESTIONS NOT AUDIBLE ANSWERS ONLY<br />
Question Prime Minister-<br />
No I haven't seen that, but there are going to be some very<br />
great changes and we are going to have to learn to tackle<br />
them. Question Prime Minister<br />
I think we are as well equipped to handle these changes as<br />
any other country, and maybe a lot better than most. Some time<br />
ago we established a very high-level committee looking at the<br />
problems of technology and technology change. That will be<br />
reporting, and hopefully give us some pointers to future<br />
government policy. But, in so many areas, Australia is now<br />
becoming more competitive. There will be more things that<br />
Australians can do and that all provides jobs and opportunities<br />
for Australians. It in that area where the great challenge<br />
really does lie.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
I think we've got to tap the advice and expertise that is<br />
available from different sections of the community, and certainly<br />
the trade uni4on movement and consultation with the trade union<br />
movement has oviously got a very real role to play. There is;<br />
an obvious area. If a firm is introducing new technology, it's<br />
of greatest importance that a firm consult with its own<br />
employees, with the unions representing those employees, so that<br />
what is happening will be understood. Also, if there is<br />
disruption of past practices and employment patterns,<br />
arrangements, a firm with a concern for industrial relations,<br />
will try and make sure that any necessary technical changes<br />
are undertaken in a way that minimnises disruption to its own<br />
people. I think a great deal of this is already happening.<br />
Question / 2<br />
PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister<br />
People say that. I've got some doubts. The modern<br />
technological revolution is different but it will not, in<br />
my view, change society as substantially as the Industrial<br />
Revolution changed society. It is easy to recall that people<br />
who were concerned with village industries, who were believing<br />
that the factL-ories were going to put them all out of work,<br />
the Industrial Revolution provided greater opportunities and<br />
greater continuity of employment and ultimately much greater<br />
livr'L.. g standards for people than could ever have occurred<br />
throuqh the continuation of the village-based industries, the<br />
cottaue industries. But at the beginning of that process<br />
there was concern, there was fear, fear of the unknown. Now I<br />
think we are much, much better equipped to handle changes in<br />
technology than<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
In certain areas it certainly can. There are two aspects of<br />
this. Moder-n technology, new practices, that can open up new<br />
market-s,. it car. produce new products that people want. Things<br />
that were undreamt of. A lot of that has already happened.<br />
You go back 30 years, 40 years, and people didn't have<br />
refrigerators, they didn't haven't deep freezers, well it was<br />
netwe hooynwidsrial processes, that brought these<br />
sor-s of household goods within the reach of virtually every<br />
household in Australia. The jobs, the opportunities provided<br />
as houses equip themselves, are obviously very great.<br />
I believe new technology is going to continue to throw new<br />
products onto the market. That is one way in which greater<br />
opportunities will be created. Going beyond that, if we don't<br />
use new technology, our industries will become outdated, their<br />
costs will rise, and they won't be able to compete whether it is<br />
in the Australia market or whether it is in export-markets.<br />
So, Dart of this is a necessary drive to make Australian<br />
industrie-s as modern and as competitive as possible, and that<br />
means t-hat they can get out and sell more in Australia, get out<br />
and capture export markets. That all provides more opportunities<br />
for Australians. So, whatever the concerns, whatever the fears,<br />
one might have for technology and its introduction, I am quite<br />
certain that there is no alternative; that we need to embrace<br />
new technology and use it to the advantage of Australian<br />
industry. Certainly there will be problems. We need to pay<br />
greater attention to those and to minimise the social impact, the<br />
economic impact, in certain areas. We need to pay very close<br />
attention to that. But, we want to try and put fear out of<br />
our minds and hearts if we can, because I think there is no<br />
alternative. Question / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think we are making progress. When you get imbalances<br />
in aan economy that are very great and very serious, it takes<br />
a long while to work out, especially in a democratic kind<br />
of society like Australia you are right. If somebody<br />
was able to say wages are going to remain static or even be<br />
reduced and have that apply without enormous industrial<br />
disruption and if you were able to arbitrarily cut expenditure<br />
programs without any concern for the social or economic<br />
consequences, then quite plainly it can be easier to control<br />
int. Flation than it is in our kind of society. But the<br />
disruption, the harm could be very great indeed. we have to<br />
work within the institutions that we've got. In the wages<br />
area you've got State Tribunals, you've got the Arbitration<br />
Coimm-ission. We have to work within that institution.<br />
There are some obligations for Government expenditure which<br />
go on regardless. Nobody has suggested that welfare payments<br />
or payments to repatriation people should be reduced. They<br />
would regard it as a denial of a fundamental obligation. if<br />
a Government did do that. So therefore, it takes a while to<br />
get inflation out of an economy. It is not only what you can<br />
do within Australia, it is not only what a Government can do<br />
or a Government and people acting together can do, even a<br />
totalitarian dictatorship will still be subject very often to<br />
increases in oil prices or increases in commodity prices.<br />
Those things can create inflationary pressures which a<br />
Government needs to respond to. So, even a totalitarian<br />
regime, if you could use those kinds of powers, which I would<br />
very much doubt, even in a dictatorship, would have problems.<br />
I -think when we look at what has happened in Australia and<br />
compare Australia's position with most country's in the<br />
advanced western world Europe, North America we are improving<br />
out position steadily because even though there are some<br />
renewed inflationary pressures in Australia at the moment, there<br />
are greater inflationary pressures in North America and in<br />
much of Europe, and the margin in favour of Australia is<br />
growing all the time. While we can keep it that way, again,<br />
it points to a better future for Australian industry because<br />
they will be becoming more competitive.<br />
Ycu asked. me a hyepothetical question. The thought of totalitarian<br />
powers i's so repugnant to -most Australians that I find it,<br />
in a sense, even to reach out and think what a totalitarian<br />
government might be able to do.<br />
Question<br />
I </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That partly depends upon the faith and confidence you have<br />
in your own people. We've stuck with a difficult course because<br />
we believe it is right, not because we like doing nasty or<br />
unpleasant things. We are starting to get, I think, into a<br />
better overall balance, as the last Budget showed, and we were<br />
able to make some useful advances in the welfare field and<br />
areas of social concern. Because we have the resources at<br />
long last to be able to make those changes. I think if a<br />
Goverrnment is prepared to take people into its confidence,<br />
they will accept what they regard as responsible government.<br />
I don't believe that the modern Australian voter, elector,<br />
is -really bemused by promises that a Government can cure all<br />
ills, or bemused by the thought of Government spending more<br />
money on a great variety of programs, because they know that<br />
that is just not a responsible course.<br />
It is very like managing a family family finances. If the<br />
housekeeper is going on spending too much money week after<br />
week on the grocery bill, and the breadwinner doesn't do anything<br />
about it and says you are running us into bankruptcy, they will<br />
end up along the track with some kind of disaster, with the<br />
family hopelessly over-cornmitted. and the breadwinner has just<br />
got to say, look, I am sorry we are spending too much week<br />
by week. We've got to spend a little less. Management of<br />
a nation's finances is not all that different from the management<br />
of a family's own finances. In that environment, in the family<br />
environment, everyone knows that there is a limit to what the<br />
family can spend. They also know that it is sometimes difficult,<br />
that it is sometimes a struggle. It is the same thing with a<br />
nation. Question Prime Minister<br />
California started that process with a Budget surplus.<br />
They did not have a Budget deficit. You've really got to take<br />
a gr-eat anv other things into account. In California, the<br />
economyl? has been growing very very rapidly over the last<br />
several years. I think it has been one of the greatest growth<br />
areas of the United States. Since they had a surplus in their<br />
Budget, and could therefore reduce taxes without adding to<br />
inflation, I've got no doubt that the tax cuts would have helped.<br />
But at the same time, there has been a natural growth process<br />
going on in California compared to other parts of the United States.<br />
QuestLion </p>
<p>Prime Minister<br />
It couldn't stand the kind of tax reduction that happened<br />
in California because it would make a deficit that is still<br />
significant, even larger. That would lead to problems in<br />
how you finance it. You've got three ways of financing a<br />
deficit either you can tax people, you can borrow it on the<br />
open market, or you can go to a printing press and print it.<br />
If you go to the printing press it is straight-out inflationary.<br />
if you borrow it on the market, well all right, that is a<br />
responsible way of financing it, but if you make the borrowing<br />
recm'rement too large, you obviously have great pressure<br />
on in-terest r-ates and then that starts to affect home builders<br />
and a whole variety of other activities that affect people.<br />
Quest~ o<br />
Prim-e-Mi-nist-er.<br />
It's so much giving more teeth to ASIO. It is putting ASIO<br />
within a proper statutory legal framework, because ASIO has been<br />
operating under successive governments of both Liberal/ National<br />
Party Coamlition Governments and earlier under Labor Governments,<br />
but wi-thout the necessary statutory charter which will set the<br />
limits of what ASTO can do and at the same time provide<br />
adequat~ e protection to individuals. We will be establishing<br />
an aptpropriat[_ e appeals arrangement for people who are subject<br />
to an adverse security report. That is a very substantial<br />
prcotection.-or individual rights. In the past people would be<br />
subject to an adverse security report and they mightn't even<br />
know abou-t it and they certainly had not appeal. So, the<br />
legislation shouldn't just be looked at from the point of view<br />
of giving ASIO more teeth. It should be looked at from the<br />
point of view of providing an appropriate legal framework for<br />
a security organisation to operate in.<br />
Why do we need ASIO or why do we need a security service?<br />
I think every government, and especially a democracy such as<br />
Australia, needs to know of the open threats to the integrity<br />
o: tecountry, t'-o the 9fab--, c of your society. They need to<br />
know of certain events occurring which might need to be<br />
countered in some way. You need to know what foreign agents<br />
are doing within your own country and in some embassies, for<br />
example, a significant number of the normal accredited people<br />
we know have security intelligence, espionage, functions.<br />
Some countries that send trade missions to this country we<br />
would know that anything up to 30% or 40% of the members of<br />
that trade mission would have some intelligence or espionage<br />
function in addition to their normal commercial trade functions.<br />
If this is happening, if that is the kind of world we live in,<br />
we have had embassies overseas that are bugged and that was<br />
exposed some time ago in relation tothe Moscow embassy well,<br />
we need to know about it, we need to be able to combat it in the<br />
protection of Australia's own national interests. / 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
This is something it would be a much better world if nations<br />
didn't indulge in these kind of practices and you didn't therefore<br />
need the sort of defensive mechanism that ASIO provides us.<br />
I think one of the good things about the present time is that<br />
the whole, or anyway so far as the Federal Parliament is<br />
concerned, the whole political spectrum believes that the ASIG<br />
organisation is necessary.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
All the parties have accepted to go to the Constitutional<br />
Conference that Prime Minister Thatcher has called for the<br />
of September. So she has moved very quickly. I think it<br />
could be a long and difficult road in getting those parties<br />
to ultimate agreement. But the Lusaka Conference did point the<br />
road to peace. it has opened up an opportunity for a<br />
settlement. I know that the United Kingdom authorities, and<br />
Margaret Thatcher in particular, as with the other countries<br />
Zambi-* a, Tanzania, the front line states, they are committed to<br />
making that agreement work. There will be many pitfalls, many<br />
problems, and there can't be any guarantees. But we do see now<br />
the possibility of ultimate peace. That is the only thing that<br />
will give securitv to white and black alike in Southern Africa.<br />
The f'irst step has been overcome. They have been saying<br />
un :) leasant thnsabout each other, but the parties have all<br />
acc= ep* te. to go to the Constitutional Conference.<br />
