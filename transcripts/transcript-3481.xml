TRANSCRIPT OF C HANNEL 0 INTERVIEW WITH PRIME MINISTER<br />
BRISBANE, NOVEMBER 22, 1974<br />
INTERVIEWER: Sir, the big, burning issue in Queensland at the<br />
moment is Mr. Crean, which was announced yesterday.<br />
Can I ask you a few questions. When did you take<br />
the decision to relocate Mr. Crean?<br />
PRIME MINISTER Oh, about three or four weeks ago.<br />
INTERVIEWERWhy did the public not know about it till yesterday?<br />
PRIME IN1ISTER 1For t wo reasons. Dr. Cairns was away a week ago and<br />
a week before that and when he got back the Governor-<br />
General was away until yesterday.<br />
INTERVIEWERDr. Cairns was reported as saying he would not<br />
accept the position as Treasurer. What changed<br />
his mind?<br />
PRIME MINISTER He was referring to just after he was elected<br />
' Deputy Leader of the Party., Deputy Prime Minister,<br />
last June. At that time of course, I asked him<br />
if he'd like it, and he wasn't anxious at that time.<br />
INTERVIEWERDo tyou think he'll make a better Treasurer though,<br />
than Mr. Crean?<br />
PRIME MINISTER I appoint people to the jobs that I think they can<br />
do best. Quite obviously, in my view, Dr. Cairns is<br />
the man best able to be Treasurer. Now that's obvious,<br />
surely.<br />
INTERVIE W&amp;. Well, there seems to be a considerable difference of<br />
opinion about that in Caucus.<br />
PRIME MINISTER No, there isn't it's my job to allocate portfolios,<br />
and I would.-have thought that was a-very obvious<br />
question to ask..<br />
IN -RVIEWE? Do you take complete responsibility?<br />
PRIME MINISTER-Of course I do.<br />
INTERVIEWER<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
INTERVIEWER What happens if Caucus now, and the ACTU<br />
It won't-It's none of the business of the ACTU<br />
and the Caucus, of course, operates under very well<br />
established rules where it is the Prime Minister's<br />
job to allocate portfolios. I've done my job<br />
according to well-known, well established rules.<br />
It seems to me, Sir, that there are two main<br />
criticisms. One, that this has. taken an awfully<br />
long time... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER I've given you reasons.<br />
INTERVIEWER And thatwas the only reason?<br />
PRIME MINISTER Exactly.<br />
INTERVIEWER Was Mr. Crean aware<br />
PRIME MINISTER I couldn't finalise this matter whiler. Cairns was<br />
away, and then after he was back the Governor-<br />
General was away fdr two or three days. The<br />
Governor-General came back to Canberra yesterday<br />
about midday. I saw him in the afternoon.<br />
INTERVIEWER Was Mr. Crean himself aware of this three weeks ago?<br />
PRIME MINISTER Yes.<br />
INTERVIEWER And he went along with it, at that time?<br />
PRIME MINISTER You've read the announcement.<br />
INTERVIEWER It says here that Mr. Creanin the Financial Review<br />
today<br />
PRIME MINISTER Well, look, I'm not going to comment on other people's<br />
interpretations. If you don't mind, I will not do it.<br />
INTERVIEWER It says he was dismissed..<br />
PRIME MINISTER-I will not discuss other people's interpretations.<br />
You can ask for my interpretation. I've given it<br />
to you. if<br />
INTERVIEWE.. But at this point in time/ you get a very strong<br />
criticism coming forward from the ACTU.....<br />
PRIME MINISTER There will not be. You're asking me to speculate.<br />
1. re hasn't been. There will not be.<br />
INTERVIEWER There are a number of reports of criticisms<br />
PRINE MINISTER They are not accurate reports, obviously.<br />
INTERVIEWER Well Sir, thank you very much. </p>
