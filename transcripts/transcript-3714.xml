CONSERVATION<br />
Sunday 20 April 19715<br />
I don't suppose there is a more beautiful State in<br />
Australia than Queensland. Its rich vegetation, its tropical<br />
climate, its diverse natural beauty, its superb coastline<br />
make it a haven for tourists and a constant joy for its ow%, n<br />
citizens. Whatever I may feel about the Queensland Government<br />
from time to time, I hope no one blames me when I come to<br />
Queensland as often as I can for a spell of relaxation.<br />
Queenslanders have a special obligation to preserve the<br />
natural beauties of their State not just for themselves,<br />
but for all Australians and for future generations. It's<br />
distressing to find the State Government neglecting this<br />
important task. They just don't seem to care.<br />
The best way to keep an area unspoiled and beautiful<br />
is to declare it a national park. That means it will always<br />
be protected from mining, from building, from development;<br />
and that wildlife will be safe. Here in Queensland you ought<br />
to have more national parks than any other State. Five percent<br />
of the State's land area would be a reasonable figure The.<br />
Labor Party in Queensland promised a 5 percent -target in their<br />
election policy three years ago. The actual amount now is a<br />
little over half of one percent, and even that low figure has<br />
been achieved only by adding a vast slab of the Simpson Desert.<br />
If we exclude the Simpson Desert, Queensland has as much land<br />
dedicated as national park as Tasmania. That's not good.<br />
Of course it's not possible for the Australian Government<br />
to set up national parks on State territory, but we can help<br />
in other ways. We have established a National Parks and<br />
Wildlife service to manage national parks in Australian territories,<br />
and the professional help of that service is available<br />
to the States. This financial year we are providing $ 9 million<br />
as part of a three-year program to help the States acquire land<br />
for nature conservation purposes. That $ 9 million is a first<br />
instalment. We have launched the National Air Monitoring<br />
Program; and a program to prevent sea. pollution by the dumping<br />
of wastes from ships; and we are insisting that all Australian<br />
Government projects likely to affect the environment are subject<br />
to detailed scrutiny by the Department of Environment. </p>
<p>Cke very importrint thing iJe Australian Covernmant<br />
can do is create marina national parks to protect parts of<br />
the sea or the coastline. That's wx'iat wer doing around<br />
the Great Barrier Reef. Natural~ y we would like the marine<br />
park established in cooperation wi~ th Queensland, with a park<br />
authority appointed jointly by the two Governments. Unfortunately<br />
Mr. Bjelke-Petersen has shown lift-le willingness to cooperate.<br />
I mentioned in an earlier broadcast the row between<br />
Mr. Bjelke-Petersen and Mr. Gorton over the Barrier Reef.<br />
Mr. Gorton, when he was Prime Minister, wasn't satisfied<br />
that the Queensland Government was doing enough to protect<br />
the Reef and its environment and he was quite justified<br />
in that suspicion. Because of his row with Queensland a<br />
Royal Commission was set up jointly by Queensland and the<br />
previous Australian Government. Wle shall be acting promptly<br />
on the basis of the Commission's report. It declares quite<br />
firmly that there must be no oil drilling or other damaging<br />
activity on the reef. But now Mr. Bjelke-Petersen comes along<br />
and asks us to hold up our legislation for a marine park while<br />
he challenges in the Courts our sovereignty over the Continental<br />
Shelf. He is still waiting for a Court decision on the validity<br />
of some earlier legislation on this subject. Quite frankly,<br />
we are not prepared to wait any longer while he argues the<br />
toss. The Royal Commission's findings are perfectly clear.<br />
Our responsibility to protect the Reef is perfectly clear.<br />
While we would rather set up a Barrier Reef marine park in<br />
cooperation with Queensland, we will, if necessary, go ahead<br />
and do it alone. There has been delay enough already. We<br />
are quite resolved that the Reef a natural asset of unique<br />
beauty and irreplaceable value should be preserved for all<br />
time. I only wish Mr. Bjelke-Petersen, with his oil and mining<br />
interests, showed the same determination.<br />
And it's not just natural beauties we have to preserve.<br />
What we call the " National Estate" includes all the beautiful<br />
buildings, historic sites and parks, and Aboriginal areas that<br />
must be safeguarded by any civilised community. This idea of<br />
a national estate is a fairly recent one. we are the first<br />
Australian Government to recognise its importance; one of the<br />
first things we did was establish a nation-wide investigation<br />
into the places and things worthy of preservation. This year<br />
we are setting aside nearly a million dollars to assist worthwhile<br />
projects in Queensland. The money is there; the projects<br />
have be en recommended; the plans are ready; the agreement with<br />
Queensland has been signed. I regret to say that the Queensland<br />
Government has not yet made a request for payment, and until<br />
they do, not a cent can be paid. All sorts of restoration<br />
works and studies in Queensland cities and towns are waiting<br />
to go ahead the moment the Queensland Government chooses to<br />
request the funds. Let me mention a few : the re-erection of<br />
the beautiful old Bellevue Homestead, formerly situated near<br />
Coominya; the restoration of the old Government House and </p>
<p>3.<br />
the Colonial stores in Brisbane; the historic City Hall<br />
in Warwick; the Caloundra lighthouse; the Bowen River<br />
Hotel near Collinsville; the James Cook monuments at Round<br />
Hill Head. The list is long. It will be tragic if these works<br />
are neglected, if the Barrier Reef remains at risk, if<br />
our efforts to preserve the natural beauty and wildlife<br />
of this State are frustrated by a State Government that<br />
simply doesn't care enough about the great natural heritage<br />
which belongs to Queenslanders and to all Australians. </p>
