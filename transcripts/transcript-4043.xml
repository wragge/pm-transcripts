REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING<br />
IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS, THE GOVERNMlENT HAS UNDERTAKEN A SEARCHING<br />
REVIEW OF ALL ITS SPENDING PROGRAMMES.<br />
I CAN NOW ANNOUNCE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE DECISIONS WHICH<br />
WILL REDUCE GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE BY ABOUT $ 300 MILLION IN 1975/ 76.<br />
SAVINGS IN LATER YEARS WILL BE CONSIDERABLY GREATER.<br />
TEE GOVERNMENT IS COMPELLED TO MAKE THESE CUTS BECAUSE IT INHERITED<br />
FROM LABOR AN ABYSMAL ECONOMIC SITUATION. INFLATION WAS RAMPANT<br />
AS THE RECENT DECEMBER QUARTER CONSUMER PRICE INCREASE RISE SO<br />
FORCIBLY REMINDS US: UNEMPLOYMENT WAS AT RECORD LEVELS; THE<br />
MONEY SUPPLY WAS RISING AT A RATE WHICH FOSTERED CONTINUED INFLATION<br />
BUSINESS AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE WAS AT AN ALL-TIME LOW.<br />
THIS SITUATION HAS LARGELY BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE LABOR GOVERNMENT<br />
BUDGETARY IRRESPONSIBILITY.<br />
UNDER LABOR GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ROSE MASSIVELY. IN 1972/ 73<br />
THE TOTAL BUDGET OUTLAYS WERE 10.2 BILLION. THIS YEAR THE LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT BUDGETTED OUTLAYS WERE 21.9 BILLION, A RISE OF 115%<br />
IN THREE YEARS. DESPITE MASSIVE INCREASES IN TAX RECEIPTS A<br />
GROSSLY INFLATIONARY DEFICIT EMERGED. BUSINESS AND CONSUMER<br />
CONFIDENCE WAS TUDERMINED. INVESTMENT AND CONSUER DEMAND FELL<br />
AWAY AND TH E RESULTING FALL LN PRODUJCION CAUSED<br />
INCREASES IN UNEMPLOYMENT.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO MANAGE AUSTRALIA'S FISCAL AFFAIRS<br />
PROPERLY. IT IS DETERMINED TO TACKLE INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT<br />
FIRMLY. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN DECISIVE POLICY ACTION TO THESE ENDS.<br />
THE 40% INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN INITIATED. THIS IS<br />
DESIGNED TO STIMULATE INVESTMENT, BOOST AUSTRALIA'S PRODUCTIVE<br />
CAPACITY AND ASSIST WITH JOB OPPORTUNITIES.<br />
A COMPREHENSIVE MONETARY PROGRAMME TO CONTROL THE INFLATIONARY<br />
GROWTH IN THE MONEY SUPPLY AND PROTECT SAVINGS HAS BEEN IMPLEMENNTED.<br />
IT WILL ALSO ASSIST IN FINANCING THE DEFICIT.<br />
WE HAVE SOUGHT TO REDUCE INFLATION AND CREATE EMPLOYMENT<br />
OPPORTUNITIES BY OPPOSING THE PASSING OF THE FULL C. P. I. INCREASE<br />
INTO WAGES.<br />
ALL THESE MEASURES ARE PART OF OUR PROGRAMME TO REDUCE INFLATION<br />
AND PROVIDE JOBS FOR ALL WHO WANT TO WORK.<br />
TO SUPPORT THESE MEASURES, WE AIM TO CUT BACK THE UNNECESSARY<br />
GROWTH IN GOVERNMENT AND THE EXCESSIVE DEFICIT WHICH HAS<br />
ACCOMPANIED IT.<br />
SOME SPENDING CUTS PREVIOUSLY'ANNOUNCED HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUT<br />
INTO EFFECT.<br />
STAFF CEILINGS HAVE BEEN IMPOSED ON THE COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC<br />
SERVICE INVOLVING A SAVING OF UP TO $ 30 MILLION; THE REMAINING<br />
PUBLIC SERVICE OVERTIME VOTE HAS BEEN REDUCED BY 50%, SAVING<br />
UP TO $ 10 MILLION IN 1975/ 76.<br />
SPENDING ON TRAVEL HAS BEEN CUT BY $ 20 MILLION IN THE REMAINDER<br />
OF 1975/ 76. ADVERTISING HAS BEEN RESTRICTED TO THE ABSOLUTELY<br />
ESSENTIAL. THE TREASURER MUST NOW APPROVE ALL NEW ElPLOYMENT<br />
OF CONSULTANTS AND ALL RENEWALS AN EXAMINATION IS ALSO BEING<br />
MADE OF EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS. </p>
<p>THE ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW COMMITTEE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED UNDER<br />
THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF SIR HENRY BLAND TO'RECONMEND WAYS OF<br />
ACHIEVING MAXIMUM ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY AND OF ELIMINATING<br />
WASTE AND DUPLICATION WITHIN AND BETWEEN GOVERNMENT-DEPARTMENTS,<br />
AND BETWEEN COMMONWEALTH AND STATE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.<br />
THERE HAS BEEN* A RATIONALISATION OF COMMISSIONS, BOARDS OF INQUIRY,<br />
AND OTHER ADVISORY BODIES AS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY.<br />
THiESE MEASUIRES WILL REDUCE SPENDING IN 1975/ 76 BY UP TO $ 60 . MILLION.<br />
THE NEW DECISIONS TAKEN TODAY WILL REDUCE SPENDING IN 1975/ 76<br />
BY ABOUT $ 300 MILLION, THIS BRINGS THE TOTAL SAVINGS MADE IN THE<br />
YEAR TO A FIGURE OF UP TO $ 360 MILLION.<br />
CABINET HAD BEFORE IT A REPnsRT FROM AN OFFICIALS' COMMITTEE ON<br />
THE SPENDING PROGRAMMES OF EVERY DEPARTMENT FEXCEPT. DEFENCE. A<br />
TOTAL OF NO LESS THAN 230 EXPENDITURE ITEMS WAS INDIVIDUALLY<br />
EXAMINED. DECISIONS WERE MADE TO END, REDUCE OR DEFER SPENDING<br />
ON MOST OF THESE ITEMS.<br />
MANY OF THE ITEMS INVOLVED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS; OTHERS,<br />
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS; OTHERS, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.<br />
IN TAKING ITS DECISIONS THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT CUT BACK ON ANY<br />
ESSENTIAL PROGRAMMES WHICH IT UNDERTOOK TO PRESERVE.<br />
MINISTERS WILL FILL IN DETAILS ON THE DECISIONS RELATING TO THEIR<br />
PORTFOLIOS WHEN IT IS PRACTICABLE TO DO SO.<br />
HOWEVER A GENERAL INDICATION OF WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED CAN BE GIVEN.<br />
THE MAIN AREAS IN WHICH SAVINGS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED ARE SET OUT<br />

OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN WHICH SIZEABLE SAVINGS HAVE BEEN EFFECTED ARE<br />
CAPITAL TERRITORY, CONSTRUCTION, NORTHERN TERRITORY, PRIMARY<br />
INDUSTRY AND TRANSPORT. HOWEVER AS I NOTED EARLIER SAVINGS<br />
HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED IN ALL DEPARTMENTS EXCEPT DEFENCE.<br />
I SHOULD STRESS THAT THE REVIEW OF SPENDING PROGRAMMES WILL<br />
CONTINUE. MINISTERS AND THE OFFICIALS' COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN<br />
DIRECTED TO REPORT ON A VARIETY OF OUTSTANDING MATTERS AND,<br />
AS ANNOUNCED LAST MONTH, A FULL-SCALE REVIEW OF MEDIBANK IS<br />

CLEARING THE GROUND FOR A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE BUDGET IN 1976/ 77.<br />
SOME HARD DECISIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN. THERE WILL BE MORE. BUT,<br />
ALONG WI-TH TLE GOVERTNMENT'S OTHER ECONOMIC POLICY ACTIONS, THEY<br />
MUST BE TAKEN IF THE ECONOMY IS TO REGAIN HEALTH AND EMPLOYMENT<br />
OPPORTUNITIES ARE TO BE CREATED.<br />
