24 August 1978<br />
STATEMENT ON THE TELECOM DISPUTE<br />
This morning the discussion between Telecom and the Australian<br />
Telecommunications Employees Association before Commissioner<br />
Clarkson, broke down.<br />
Commissioner Clarkson had been working on a compromise proposal<br />
to settle the Telecom dispute. Telecom had accepted his<br />
proposal, as indeed it had his earlier proposals. The union2e-z-4'-<br />
has rejected the proposal. The proposal was reasonable and<br />
fair, and would have protected the interests of all parties.<br />
It would have allowed a review of A. T. E. A. classifications.<br />
It would have provided adequate and proper consultation on the<br />
development of the new technology necessary to protect the<br />
interests of the Australian consumer.<br />
The dispute, which has been going on for the best part of a month,<br />
now enters a most serious stage. On Mlonday and Tuesday, union<br />
officials will be seeking endorsement of their rejection of<br />
Commissioner Clarkson's proposals. It is time for the<br />
Government to state-its own position in this dispute. The<br />
continued industrial action by the A. T. E. A. is causing great<br />
inconvenience and harm to tens of thousands of people throughout<br />
Australia. It is gravely disrupting business right throughout<br />
Australia. Communications are bound to deteriorate further,<br />
causing more hardship to individuals and more damage to<br />
business, and to Australia's international reputation.<br />
The Government fully supports the decisions taken by Telecom.<br />
It believes that Telecom has been reasonable in a very difficult<br />
situation. Telecom has fully supported Commissioner Clarkson' s<br />
proposals for settlement. The Government fully supports<br />
Telecom's policy of no work, no pay. </p>
<p>2<br />
Over 3,000 employees are already off pay because they<br />
have refused to do the work they are paid for.<br />
The number will inevitably increase significantly.<br />
Wages are now being lost at the rate of $ 1.6 million a<br />
fortnight, and so the hardship on A. T. E. A. members alone<br />
is considerable, and is bound to increase. They will not<br />
regain that pay.<br />
The Government also endorses the decision of Telecom to<br />
commence de-registration proceedings against the A. T. E. A<br />
forthwith.<br />
The union has resolutely rejected not just one, but three,<br />
sets of proposals by Commissioner Clarkson.<br />
The members of the A. T. E. A. have a responsibility to<br />
Australia. They are in a service industry which is<br />
essential to this nation. Australia needs them. They<br />
need Telecom for their jobs and their security. They<br />
are unlikely to find other jobs as well paid for which<br />
they are qualified.<br />
I suspect the public is not aware that Telecom has given<br />
a ten-year guarantee to A. T. E. A. members against any<br />
retrenchment as a result of technological change.<br />
What other industry, what other employer, has achieved<br />
that in terms of security for its own employees?<br />
Against this background, I think it is necessary for me<br />
to be more specific.<br />
The Government supports Telecom, and it will continue to<br />
do so because in supporting Telecom it is supporting the<br />
interests of all Australians.<br />
We have a long-standing tradition of arbitration in this<br />
country. The union officials are now seeking to throw<br />
that tradition aside. They refuse to accept the umpire's<br />
decision. Commissioner Clarkson said that he was " bitterly<br />
disappointed at the lack of leadership shown by union<br />
officials." They are saying " It must be our decision<br />
and on our terms."<br />
That view is not acceptable to the Australian community,<br />
and it is not acceptable to this Government. / 3. </p>
<p>3<br />
The Commonwealth has a range of legal powers available<br />
to it, and it will not hesitate to use these powers if<br />
members of this union do not accept their responsibility<br />
to the community.<br />
The longer that this dispute continues, the more the<br />
families of A. T. E. A. members will suffer; the more wages<br />
they will have lost.<br />
Commissioner Clarkson expressed the hope that A. T. E. A.<br />
members would be given the opportunity to consider his<br />
recommendations and see the sense of them.<br />
Members will have that opportunity on Monday and Tuesday.<br />
I ask the members of the union to reflect upon these<br />
matters, to consider what is in their own interest, and<br />
what is in the interest of their own families, and the<br />
interest of this nation. </p>
