    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government congratulates Emmanuel Macron on his election as the President of the Republic of France.</p>
<p>Australia enjoys a strong relationship with France, underpinned by common values and a shared vision for a secure and more prosperous future. Our people-to-people links continue to grow and Australia's 100,000-strong French community makes a vibrant contribution to our nation. </p>
<p>Our security and defence partnership was forged on the battlefields of World War I and has been the cornerstone of our relationship for a century. Australia’s Future Submarine Program continues this partnership.</p>
<p>We signed a Joint Statement of Enhanced Strategic Partnership during Foreign Minister Ayrault’s visit to Australia in March, enhancing cooperation between our two countries on a range of global challenges including terrorism, transnational, serious and organised crime, proliferation, and climate change.</p>
<p>Australia and France also have a substantial trade and investment relationship, with two-way trade valued at $8.7 billion in 2015-16. Over 500 French companies operate in Australia, employing an estimated 60,000 people. </p>
<p>The Australian Government looks forward to working with President-elect Macron to further bolster French-Australian relations. We thank outgoing President Francois Hollande for his commitment to enhancing the already close ties between our countries including through his 2014 visit to Australia, the first by a sitting French President.</p>
