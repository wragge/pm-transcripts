FOR MEDIA 25 July 1983<br />
The Prime Minister today chaired the first meeting of the<br />
Economic Planning Advisory Council.<br />
EPAC has been set up to continue the process of co-operation<br />
which was begun at the Summit.<br />
Today's inaugral meeting continued that spirit of constructive<br />
co-operation.<br />
The purpose of EPAC is to provide independent community-based<br />
advice to the Government on the broad conduct of economic<br />
policy, particularly in a medium and longer-term context.<br />
The membership of the Council is drawn from Commonwealth and<br />
State Governments, industry, the union movement, local<br />
cgovernment, consumer and welfare organisations.<br />
The preparation of the 1983-4 Budget is nearing completion and<br />
therefore non-Federal Government members of EPAC have had no<br />
involvement in or responsibility whatsoever for what will be<br />
in that Budget.<br />
Nevertheless, the Federal Government was assisted by observations<br />
from those non-Federal Government members in what they regarded<br />
as relevant appropriate considerations to be taken into account<br />
in reaching decisions about the Budget.<br />
The Council discussed developments in prices and incomes<br />
matters, including the Government's intention to introduce<br />
legislation establishing a Prices Surveillance Authority<br />
early in the forthcoming Budget Sittings of Parliament.<br />
The Prime Minister sought the reaction of Council members to<br />
the appointment of an additional member to EPAC through<br />
consultation with the relevant small business organisation,<br />
the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia.<br />
It was felt that a member with special knowl-edge and experience<br />
of the problems faced by small businesses would be able to<br />
make a particularly valuable contribution to the Council's<br />
work. Legislation to amend the EPAC Act for this purpose will be<br />
introduced in the Budget Sittings.<br />
The Council considered the future areas of work to be undertaken<br />
related to its Predominant role in considering the optimum<br />
future patterns of economic development in Australia.-/ 2<br />
OMNI".* </p>
<p>The structure of the Council's work program to give effect to<br />
this fundamentally important task will be examined in detail<br />
at the next meeting. 0<br />
By this time an appointment will have been made to the position<br />
of Director of the EPAC Secretariat.<br />
However, it was thought to be useful immediately to commission<br />
work on some areas which will inevitably be relevant to the<br />
Council's broad responsibilities however they develop.<br />
These areas are:<br />
updating and further development of the " Summit"<br />
scenarios, analysis of existing Federal Government mechanisms<br />
concerned with issues relevant to economic development,<br />
analysis of the existing data base,<br />
a summary of the major findings of previous studies<br />
the Asprey Report) dealing with the revenue<br />
base, and<br />
a n examination of the likely employment growth and<br />
workforce participation in the process of the<br />
anticipated economic recovery.<br />
The appointment of a Director to head the planned independent<br />
Secretariat is expected to be made over the next month and<br />
the recruitment of other staff will follow.<br />
In the meantime, the Council will be assisted by a small number<br />
of staff seconded from Commonwealth Government Departments. </p>
