    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Commonwealth has decided to honour Sir Donald Bradman by issuing a new Australian 20 cent coin. The new coin will be an enduring symbol of the great affection that the Australian people hold for the memory of Sir Donald, and his enormous contribution to this country.</p>
<p>In addition Royal Australian Mint and the Perth Mint will also be issuing three limited edition collector coins to commemorate Sir Donald. The collector coins will be minted in a gold and silver combination, silver and bronze respectively. The designs for the collector coins have been developed in conjunction with the Bradman Foundation, and royalties from the sale of these coins will go to the Foundation.</p>
<p>Production of the new 20 cent coin will commence next month, and the coins will begin circulating soon afterwards. The new coin will be issued for a limited period.</p>
<p>It will not replace the traditional 20 cent coin bearing the platypus. Both coins will be in circulation simultaneously.</p>
<p>The response of the community to the death of Sir Donald on 25 February showed just how much his achievements and the values he embodied have meant to this country.</p>
<p>Sir Donald dominated his sport and became a national hero at a young age. Through his sporting achievements and the example he set Sir Donald gave the country a sense of hope and inspiration, helping people to believe in themselves in difficult times.</p>
