Statement bjy te Prime Minister, Mr. W illiam McMahon<br />
" I am pleased to announce that. Australia has-been invited-to<br />
accede to the Convention on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and<br />
Development E. C. the Prime Mfinister, the Rt. Honourable William Mcl\ ahon,<br />
said today. " The Government has decided that Australia should accept the<br />
invitation and hence become a full member of 0. E. C. D. Mx. McMahon added that<br />
these formalities would be completed on 7th June during the course of the 0. E. C. D.<br />
Ministerial Council Meeting to be held at the Organisation's headquarters in Paris.<br />
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry, the Honourable<br />
J. D. Anthony, will lead the Australian delegation to the meeting.<br />
Mr. McMahon described the 0. E. C. which includes among its members<br />
the major industrialised countries, as one of the most important consultative bodies<br />
in the world today on economic and related matters He said the decision to join<br />
0. E. C. D. represented a significant step in Australia's foreign economic relations. In<br />
addition to its main function of consultation on financial and economic policies, the<br />
Organisation considers such matters as science policy, manpower questions and a<br />
range of social issues.<br />
The Minister for Foreign Affairs will have the general administrative<br />
responsibility for 0. E. C. D. but other Ministers and Departments will of course<br />
have the principal interest and responsibility for those activities of direct concern to<br />
them. ," Australia will, I am certain, benefit considerably from participating in the<br />
Organisation's activities and looks forward to close involvement in the work of the<br />
Organisation", Mr. McMahon said. " The invitation to join the Organisation can be<br />
justly regarded as clear -recognition of Australia's economic standing and of the<br />
valuable contribution Australia can make on major international economic questions."<br />
The Prime Minister recalled that the 0. E. C. D. was established in 1961 to<br />
succeed the former Organisation for European Economic Co-operation E. E. C.)<br />
whose functions were revised and extended in various ways and whose membership<br />
was expanded to include the United States and Canada, and later Japan and F inlandi.<br />
Thbe broad aims of the 0. E. C. D. are to promote policies conducive to balanced<br />
economic growth of its member countries, to contribute to sound development in<br />
developing countries and to contribute to the expansion of world trade. With these<br />
objectives in mind, regular consultations take place within the 0. E. C. D. at both<br />
Ministerial and senior official levels in all major fields of economic activity. Its<br />
22 members account for over 60% 0 of the world's trade and industrial production, and<br />
provide over 90% 0 of the aid granted from all sources to developing countries. e a / 2 </p>

Mr. McMahon said that Australia had already been participating in part of<br />
the Organisation' s activities since February 1966 when Australia joined the<br />
Development Assistance Committee A. Australia had derived considerable<br />
advantage and understanding from the contacts with other aid-giving countries which<br />
membership of the D. A. C. afforded, and had been able to contribute to the D. A. C.<br />
the benefits of Australia's experience in the aid field.<br />
Mr. McMahon said that at the 0. E. C. D. Ministerial Council on 7th-Sth June<br />
Mr. Anthony viuld be assisted by representatives of the Departments of Foreign<br />
Affairs, the Treasury, and Trade and Industry. The delegation would include<br />
Australia's Am-bassador designate to the 0. E. C. D. Sir Ronald Walker, C. B. E.<br />
Sir Ronald would head a permanent delegation to 0. E. C. D. which Australia mould<br />
establish-in Parts in June.~<br />
