TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH RADIO 2UE, 2GB AND ABC NEWS, CANBERRA<br />
9 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Do you think the markets will believe the bottom line on this Budget?<br />
PM; It's easy enough to believe. The starting point deficit was around $ 6<br />
billion, there are $ 3 billion of discretionary changes by the Government<br />
that's on outlays, spednad receipts and there is then the sale<br />
of Government assets, which improves the structure of those<br />
institutions, and removes long-term public debt-interest effects.<br />
Altogether, $ 6 billion to $ 3 billion, to a surplus of $ 700 million it's all<br />
there in the Budget papers.<br />
J: The Opposition says it's a " fudge-it budget"?<br />
PM: What else can they say? They are left without a feather to fly with<br />
they were presented tonight with a Budget surplus, next year, a Budget<br />
surplus free of any asset sales, and the biggest change in the nation's<br />
history in terms of a private savings plan.<br />
J; Is the extent of the asset sales justified given the Commonwealth Bank<br />
decision?<br />
PM: It improves the institution let's take the Commonwealth Bank what<br />
was it? A couple of years ago, it was the old State Savings Bank of<br />
NSW. Then, we bought the State Bank of Victoria. It is now a real<br />
institution. Then, under this Government, we floated it we sold half of<br />
it, it strengthened in the market, it's share prices strengthened. Sold,<br />
completely, it will then have a strong capital base in the market it is<br />
the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do for the institution -the<br />
right thing to do for the Budget. And it is the same with Qantas<br />
Qantas needs capital that the government can't give it, it has the<br />
chance of being the primary airline in this part of the world of South-<br />
East Asia and why shouldn't it have that chance? </p>
<p>J: Is this an election Budget?<br />
PM: This is a Budget that does as the Treasurer said, quite eloquently: " A<br />
key objective of current policy is to address the national savings<br />
investment balance, while maintaining strong economic growth". What<br />
this Budget does is give the lie to John' Howard's cynical, opportunist<br />
claim about " five minutes of sunshine". We have had now three and a<br />
half years of growth, and the Budget forecasts are forecasting another<br />
3 years. In other words, what is very clear to the Australian people<br />
from this Budget, is that there will be 6 years of continuous growth,<br />
with low inflation, but at the same time, filling that massive savings pothole<br />
which is sitting up there around the late 1990s and the year<br />
2000 with the biggest private change ever with superannuation.<br />
J: Why haven't you gone harder on spending cuts?<br />
PM: We have gone very hard. We have got net spending cuts in the<br />
Budget of $ 700 million, but gross spending cuts of about $ 1500 million.<br />
So, there are $ 1500 million of actual cuts, but there is a lot of new<br />
policy a lot of it is unavoidable new policy, the spending on families,<br />
leaves us with $ 700 million of net spending cuts, and that rises next<br />
year. The key thing is that the $ 3 billion of changes we have in this<br />
year, rises to over $ 4.5 billion next year that is the discretionary<br />
receipts and outlays changes.<br />
J: How do you overcome credibility problems with scrapping the second<br />
round of On e Nation tax cuts, and bring in the superannuation tradeoff?<br />
PM: I don't think there is any credibility problem. If you say to people " what<br />
would they prefer $ 10 or $ 15 in their hands, or the chance to have a<br />
decent income in retirement?". I think you will find in the Budget<br />
papers, for someone on average weekly earnings, who has been in the<br />
workforce for 40 years, they go out with something like $ 0.5 million<br />
dollars. Half a million. That is a person on average weekly earnings.<br />
So if you give that choice to Australians... . remember this the<br />
Government paid and brought forward the first round of tax cuts, and<br />
on this occasion will be paying more than the second round of the One<br />
Nation tax cuts will be paying more. But they are paying it directly<br />
into superannuation accounts, and then that will give all Australians<br />
everyone, particularly the lower income earners a much higher<br />
standard of living in retirement.<br />
J: During the last election, you promised that the company tax rate would<br />
come down to 33 cents in the dollar now you h7Ve -taken ifb-a-k up to<br />
36 cents in the dollar what happened to our international<br />
combativeness? </p>
<p>PM: You remember that at the same time, John Hewson was going to take<br />
the company rate from 39% to 42%. And we had the Business Council<br />
all out there cheering a 42% rate, and we said " don't mind u s we are<br />
going to reduce it to Not a soul gave us a point for it. We did<br />
reduce it to 33% from 39%, but the companies it's the highest level of<br />
profits in Australian history at the moment. And taking that up by 3<br />
cents only to 36 cents is still a long way down from the 46 cents it was<br />
when John Howard left it all those years ago...<br />
J: But they are warning....<br />
PM: . taking it up to 36% will bring in, I think, $ 300 million this year, and<br />
$ 1500 million next year. Now, that is off the massive level of<br />
profitability which companies enjoy, and that is where the burden<br />
should be.<br />
J: But they already warning about jobs growth and employment<br />
prospects.<br />
PM: But who some flapper from the Business council?<br />
J: But what about the tax on motor cars going back up 5% we have<br />
already had the motor traders saying that is going to hurt employment,<br />
particularly in Victoria?<br />
PM: What we did, we reduced it to 15% and 16% in One Nation for the<br />
express purpose of kick-starting the motor industry in the recession. It<br />
did that we are now up to as high a Tevel of s'ales as we have seen,<br />
and now is the time to bring it back. It was cyclical policy then it was<br />
counter-cycle policy then, and it is counter-cycle policy now. In other<br />
words, we took it down when it needed to go down, we are taking it<br />
back up to where it was because now the need has passed. The key<br />
point in all this the Liberals don't know where to go with all this they<br />
are now facing a Budget surplus this year, and a surplus next year<br />
without asset sales or anything, and a massive change for everyone in<br />
the country having 15% put away for their long-term savings. Mr<br />
Howard almost shrivelled up tonight looking at it we have had<br />
nervous giggles, we have had all sorts of rehearsed lines, extravagant<br />
press releases the Liberals know that their cynical line that there was<br />
only going to be 5 minutes of sunshine, and that the Government was<br />
not going to have galloping interest rates, has now fallen for the fact<br />
that it has no truth. And what this will mean with this Budget with this<br />
very great change to fiscal policy, and to long-term savings, much less<br />
pressure on any prospect on interest rate rises.<br />
ends </p>
