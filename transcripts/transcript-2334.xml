FOR PRESS: P . N1617<br />
W] THHOLDING TAX AMENDMENTS TO TAX LAW<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, kMr. john r ton<br />
The Government has consistently emphasised the importance to Australia of<br />
a strong and continuing inflow of overseas development capital. We have equaly<br />
emphasised the need toietain and increase Australian equity in, aind ownership of, our<br />
expanding resources.<br />
We have now decided to propose to the Parliament, in the early part of next<br />
year, amendments to the taxation law as it affects overseas borrowings, such<br />
amendments to be effective as from 1st July 1971.<br />
We -have recently completed a review of the effect of the interest withholding<br />
tax which must be deducted by Australian borrowers, at the rate of 10%, from interest<br />
payments made to overseas lenders on loans raised overseas.<br />
We believe that this tax, intended to fall on overseas lenders who earn interest<br />
in Australia, frequently falls instead on the Australian borrower. An overseas lender,<br />
knowing that 10% 0 of the interest payments to him will be withheld in Australia, increases<br />
the rate of interest above the level at which it otherwise would have been, or requires<br />
the borrower to meet the tax.<br />
This additional cost falls on Australian Companies for they, of course, do not<br />
have the advantage of access to loan funds from abroad through overseas parent<br />
companies, or associated companies.<br />
kt was, of course, never intended that the interest withholding tax should<br />
make it more difficult for Australian Companies to participate in venture.-in Australia<br />
on equal terms with Companies from overseas. It is therefore intended to amend the<br />
income tax law to exempt from the payment of withholding tax interest payments made<br />
overseas on borrowings overseas by Australian controlled Companies for predominantly<br />
Australian owned ventures, or for financing a substantial Australian equity participation<br />
in a venture. This review of the law regarding taxation of interest on overseas borrowings is<br />
designed to give further effect to the Government's policies of helping to protect<br />
Australian equity and ownership.<br />
At the same time as it proposes the above amendment the Government will<br />
also propose to the Parliament that Sections 126 and 128 of the Income Tax Assessment<br />
Act should be amended so that interest paid overseas on overseas borrowings made<br />
by means of a public issue, or widely offered private placement of bearer bonds, will<br />
no longer incur penalty rates of tax or be subject to withholding tax.<br />
This will apply whether such borrowings are made by Australian controlled<br />
companies or by overseas companies and should confer important benefits on all<br />
Companies operating in Australia.<br />
Our central aim is to create conditions under which overseas investment will<br />
continue to be attracted to Australia yet under which there will be improved opportunities<br />
for Australian participation in development enterprises and industrial expansion<br />
requiring overseas capital.<br />
