    <content><![CDATA[<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Australia, you are in the blocks. Peter Costello has given you</p>
<p>   the pre-race massage. The warm up has been completed and you are</p>
<p>   waiting for the Prime Minister to fire the starter's pistol.</p>
<p>   It has now been made obvious, if you run through to an election</p>
<p>   in July or August and you elect John Howard's Government, there's</p>
<p>   a pot of gold. On the line, the Prime Minister. Good morning Mr</p>
<p>   Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Neil.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>You disagree with that interpretation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I wouldn't describe it as a pot of gold but what I would</p>
<p>   say is that we have given Australia the most secure economic foundation</p>
<p>   for a quarter of a century. If we hadn't done what we've</p>
<p>   done over the last two years with what has happened in Asia the</p>
<p>   Australian economy would now be a lot weaker. And if there is a</p>
<p>   change of Government the low interest rates, that are a product</p>
<p>   of our hard work, will be put at risk. So that is how I would describe</p>
<p>   it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But isn't the pot of gold the tax cuts?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are going to cut income tax as part of our personal tax package</p>
<p>   and that was always our intention. And we'll be introducing</p>
<p>   taxation reform off the back of a very strong economy and off the,</p>
<p>   I guess, the healthiest Budget outlook that this country has had</p>
<p>   for more than 20 years. Because there is nothing phoney about the</p>
<p>   economic forecast in the Budget. Nobody will be able to say that</p>
<p>   we have exaggerated growth. In fact, some people think our growth</p>
<p>   figure is very conservative indeed.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I'd like to get to those figures in a moment if I may but</p>
<p>   have you told your party room that the election could be any time</p>
<p>   after the end of June?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I have. Now that doesn't mean its going to be soon after</p>
<p>   the 30th of June, that's the normal precautionary message that</p>
<p>   a Prime Minister gives at the beginning of this sort of Parliamentary</p>
<p>   session Neil.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Have you decided when.......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I haven't. I can honestly say to you that I haven't</p>
<p>   decided when the election will be. I know it's your job to</p>
<p>   keep asking me. I can't be any more helpful than to say that</p>
<p>   I don't yet know when the election will be.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Obviously you'd have a few options in your mind wouldn't</p>
<p>   you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there are a series of options. If there is to be a double</p>
<p>   dissolution, then the Parliament has got to be dissolved by the</p>
<p>   29th of October and the election held in practice four or five weeks</p>
<p>   after that. If there is not a double dissolution then the Parliament</p>
<p>   can run on until March or April of next year which would be the</p>
<p>   third anniversary of the election of my Government.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Presumably a double dissolution is preferable though isn't</p>
<p>   it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well if you want to get the blocked legislation through at a joint</p>
<p>   sitting, yes. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And you want to do that, therefore the most likely possibility</p>
<p>   is an election this year.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is one of the options Neil. I am not trying to be evasive.</p>
<p>   I don't want to mislead anybody. I honestly have not decided.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What will influence you on when you call an election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you always want to go at the right time.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>You want to win.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, of course I want to win. I mean I am not ashamed to say that.</p>
<p>   The reason I want to win is that I think I can deliver better Government</p>
<p>   than my opponent and I'm not shy about saying that and I don't</p>
<p>   think anybody would believe me if I said otherwise and they'd</p>
<p>   be entitled to disbelieve me if......</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Fair enough, but do you reckon you'd win at the moment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I do.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think you'd win next year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I do.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think the Asian crisis, which is one of the issues raised</p>
<p>   in the Budget, is going to affect the economy to the point that</p>
<p>   it will make it more difficult to win next year.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think it does and saying that I think I would win,</p>
<p>   I am not complacent. I think it'll be hard and the public is</p>
<p>   entitled to run over what we've done and run over what the</p>
<p>   alternative offering is an make a decision. But as far as Asia is</p>
<p>   concerned, the message simply is, that if we hadn't of got</p>
<p>   the Budget in order, we'd be in a real mess now.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is it fair to say, that there's not [inaudible] the next election</p>
<p>   will be a tax based election? It will be a fight about tax, tax</p>
<p>   policy.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That will be a big issue, yes. I think industrial relations reform</p>
<p>   will also be part of it. I think people will make a judgement about</p>
<p>   whether they want a reformed waterfront or whether they want the</p>
<p>   rorts of the past but tax will be a very big issue. But also people</p>
<p>   will ask themselves what's the reason for putting Labor back?</p>
<p>   I mean they threw Labor out resoundingly less than three years ago.</p>
<p>   Since then their interest rates have come down and the country is</p>
<p>   back in the black. We've weathered the worst effects of the</p>
<p>   Asian economic turmoil and on top of that, we've got the guts</p>
<p>   to reform the Australian taxation system. They've got to ask</p>
<p>   themselves what earthly incentive is there for putting Labor back</p>
<p>   because you'd only get more of the same. And those interest</p>
<p>   rates that have come down so much would go up again. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well if tax is the issue, and I agree with you it is likely to</p>
<p>   be. The Treasurer last night was making the point the tax system</p>
<p>   is awful, that's it's almost ripping people off. Do you</p>
<p>   agree with that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's very unfair. Well look at all those disparate sales taxes.</p>
<p>   For example, and the high rates of marginal tax and one of the advantages</p>
<p>   of tax reform is that you do have the opportunity to reduce some</p>
<p>   of the cheating that occurs under the present system.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well isn't it best to fix that as soon as possible?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And is your package ready?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we've done a lot of work on it. It's not ready</p>
<p>   for release yet and there is still some more work to be done. And</p>
<p>   now that the Budget is out of the way, we can turn our attention,</p>
<p>   with even greater intensity, to the preparation of the package.</p>
<p>   But Neil, it's well advanced. We've got a very good idea</p>
<p>   of the broad architecture, if I can borrow that overworked expression</p>
<p>   in economic matters, but we've still got some work to do.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I guess that's part of the point I'm making, is it needs</p>
<p>   to be done quickly. Isn't it best to get an election, get it</p>
<p>   over and done with and get on with things?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is, but you've got to get it right. And it's a very</p>
<p>   big change. This will be the biggest change to the Australian taxation</p>
<p>   system in 80 years. So we better be certain that we've got</p>
<p>   it right. Other people have tried this reform in the past and not</p>
<p>   been successful. We don't intend to repeat that failure because</p>
<p>   we think the Australian economy desperately needs a new taxation</p>
<p>   system. And the fact that we've been able to get the country</p>
<p>   back in the black and we've been able to turn around a $10.5</p>
<p>   billion deficit into a $2.7 billion surplus will give the Australian</p>
<p>   people a lot of confidence that we have a competent Government in</p>
<p>   charge of the economy.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>If you go to an election in the next year obviously, and you are</p>
<p>   re-elected, how quickly can tax reform be implemented? If your package</p>
<p>   is accepted by the people when do they actually see the benefits</p>
<p>   in the tax they are paying?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well all I can say in answer to that at the moment Neil is that</p>
<p>   it will be implemented as soon as feasible. I can't say any</p>
<p>   more than that. As soon as humanly possible. But these things do</p>
<p>   take a lot of preparation and they do involve a lot of change but</p>
<p>   I would not see any sense at all in delaying it a month longer than</p>
<p>   was absolutely essential. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>There is going to be a few problems in the months ahead when we</p>
<p>   talk about Asia, we talk about unemployment.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well unemployment, of course, is better now than it's been</p>
<p>   for eight years.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It's not good enough is it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it's not good enough and you never rest. I mean when people</p>
<p>   say to me, are you satisfied with the unemployment rate. The answer</p>
<p>   is always no, but I can say that we've created 280,000 new</p>
<p>   jobs in just over two years. We do have the lowest rate for eight</p>
<p>   years and we've created more full-time jobs in the last two</p>
<p>   years than the former Government did, in the last eight months rather,</p>
<p>   than the former Government did in its last six years in office.</p>
<p>   So we are not doing, comparatively speaking, we are not doing badly</p>
<p>   on that front, but there is still a long, long way to go. And don't</p>
<p>   think for a moment that I regard that as anything other than still</p>
<p>   a first class challenge, it is.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, well the Budget predictions are around eight per cent unemployment</p>
<p>   aren't they?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well edging down to seven and three quarters. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yeah okay. But are we getting to the stage where we have to accept</p>
<p>   full employment at around seven-and-a-half per cent.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't believe that. I think that you have to realise</p>
<p>   that it's very hard to get it below a certain level. But I</p>
<p>   think that certain level is lower than seven and a half per cent.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can't say that with any precision but it is noticeably lower</p>
<p>   than seven and a half per cent. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But you must have a figure in mind?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't have a particular figure in mind. I just have</p>
<p>   a sense that, given the structure of the Labor market, given the</p>
<p>   change that's occurring in the composition of the workforce,</p>
<p>   that the lower you get the harder it gets to make further gains.</p>
<p>   But you've got to look at countries like the United States,</p>
<p>   for example, the United States now that has an unemployment rate</p>
<p>   of less than five per cent. Now the United States does not have</p>
<p>   as kind a welfare system as Australia has and there are many features</p>
<p>   of the American welfare system that I would not want to emulate.</p>
<p>   I think you've got to have a balance between making sure that</p>
<p>   people have an incentive to be in a job but also recognising that</p>
<p>   in a compassionate society you need a decent safety net. And that's</p>
<p>   the basis of our mutual obligation principle and our work for the</p>
<p>   dole policy. What we are saying to people is that we'll support</p>
<p>   you if you can't get a job but we want you to do something</p>
<p>   in return. The Americans are harder than that and I don't want</p>
<p>   to go that far. I think the Australian way is different and better.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Just finally on the election. I know that there are some reports</p>
<p>   that there's a debate going on already about whether Kerry</p>
<p>   O'Brien will host a debate between Kim Beazley and John Howard.</p>
<p>   I think radio is the place to do it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Neil, I'll leave that to the Federal Director of my party.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Have you got any problems with Kerry O'Brien?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look I'm not going to get into personalities on your</p>
<p>   programme or, indeed, on any other programme. Arrangements on my</p>
<p>   behalf for the debate will be handled by the Federal Director of</p>
<p>   the Liberal Party, Lynton Crosby, and I'll leave all the discussions</p>
<p>   and negotiations to him. He does it very well. Andrew Robb did it</p>
<p>   very well before him on my behalf last time and I'll be very</p>
<p>   happy to leave it to him.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay. Final point on the election. There is a possibility when there</p>
<p>   is election talk around, there's that sort of mood at the moment</p>
<p>   but it can be a distraction. Does that concern you and is that an</p>
<p>   influencing factor, that we've got all these issues coming,</p>
<p>   so let's get an election out of the way and face them.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'd rather we didn't have it but it seems to be unavoidable</p>
<p>   and we started getting election talk when we faced this problem</p>
<p>   about getting the Native Title Bill through the Parliament. If the</p>
<p>   Senate had passed the Native Title Bill I don't think an early</p>
<p>   election would be something that people were talking about a lot</p>
<p>   but because they didn't and the prospect of a double dissolution</p>
<p>   was there and the fact that we came back at the beginning of the</p>
<p>   Parliament this year and put the Bill up again and it was rejected</p>
<p>   again by the Senate, it turned up the heat on that whole issue.</p>
<p>   I don't think it's helpful but there's really nothing</p>
<p>   I can do about it. It's not of my generation. I'd be delighted</p>
<p>   not to have to answer any questions on the election until I give</p>
<p>   advice to the Governor-General to hold it.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But your Budget is very much preparing for an election, isn't</p>
<p>   it?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Some people have said it's unlike a pre-election budget. Many</p>
<p>   people have said it's quite restrained in the spending initiatives.</p>
<p>   I think it strikes the right balance. It's got the country</p>
<p>   back in the black. It's attended to a few areas that needed</p>
<p>   attending to and it's given people a great ring of confidence,</p>
<p>   particularly in relation to low inflation and low interest rates.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Ring of confidence? That sounds like a toothpaste.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's true. I apologise if anybody is accusing me of plagiarism</p>
<p>   but it is absolutely true. I mean, people must now feel that the</p>
<p>   show is being run by a group of men and women who know what they</p>
<p>   are doing.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Can I ask you about some specifics in the budget. The self-funded</p>
<p>   retirees getting a health card, now $67,000 is what they can earn</p>
<p>   as a couple...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>As a couple, yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And get their health card. That's an enormous amount of money.</p>
<p>   Now, that really looks to me as if it's a cynical attempt to</p>
<p>   get back that vote, to get the grey vote. Why do you give...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I suppose where you draw these lines is always difficult and whenever</p>
<p>   you draw a line, whenever you have an income test, those who just</p>
<p>   miss out are cranky no matter what their income is and those who</p>
<p>   just get it of course are very grateful and the previous limits</p>
<p>   were significantly lower than that and we took the view that people</p>
<p>   who have been thrifty enough to make provisions for their own retirement</p>
<p>   felt that on occasions their thrift was not recognised. The other</p>
<p>   thing you've got to say is that that particular group of people</p>
<p>   have not got as much out of falling interest rates as homebuyers</p>
<p>   because many of those people have investments. They have lent money</p>
<p>   and when interest rates go down, it's great if you are borrowing</p>
<p>   money but it's not so good if you are lending money.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes but on one hand we seem to have a philosophy where you will</p>
<p>   be tough on welfare payments, and so you've got to really deserve</p>
<p>   this. You are not getting money for nothing but on the other hand,</p>
<p>   here's somebody, here's a couple who could be earning</p>
<p>   $67000 and we're going to give them a hand out.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, you're only talking here about a discounted rate for pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>   You're not talking about giving them a pension.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes but it's a fair old hit, isn't it?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>$190 million over four years and that's about, just under $50</p>
<p>   million a year and it will benefit about a quarter of a million</p>
<p>   people. So it's not as if you are handing them a fortune but</p>
<p>   what you are doing through that is you are recognising the contribution</p>
<p>   that a very thrifty section of the Australian community has made</p>
<p>   to relieving the taxpayer of the obligation of looking after them.</p>
<p>   I mean, these people don't get the pension. These people are</p>
<p>   not a burden on the taxpayer. I am not criticising people who get</p>
<p>   the pension, by the way, I am just making the comment that people</p>
<p>   who save and have been thrifty and careful, many of them, they are</p>
<p>   not living in luxury. They have just been very careful and very</p>
<p>   provident and they appreciate the fact that the Government recognises</p>
<p>   the contribution they have made and the way in which they have relieved</p>
<p>   the taxpayer of an obligation.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I understand that but at the same time where you tightening up on</p>
<p>   say childcare but loosening up with people on $67,000 a year.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You say we are tightening up on childcare. I mean, we have actually</p>
<p>   increased the amount of money that we are contributing to childcare</p>
<p>   in the two budgets that we have brought down. We are providing an</p>
<p>   additional 83000 places over the next four years. I don't think</p>
<p>   you could say we are tightening up on childcare.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The health area still Mr Howard, case mix severely criticised here</p>
<p>   in official reports on the way the hospital system is working is</p>
<p>   really a damning report. Health Ministers today have already issued</p>
<p>   a statement saying, well, the Budget doesn't help health. It</p>
<p>   doesn't do anything for the hospitals. Now do you accept that,</p>
<p>   because people are going to continue to suffer in hospitals?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't accept that. I don't want to get into a running</p>
<p>   commentary on the Victorian health system. That is something that</p>
<p>   I will leave to the Victorian Government to deal with but I can</p>
<p>   only repeat that our Medicare agreement offer for the next five</p>
<p>   years involves an increase of 3 per cent a year, that's 15</p>
<p>   per cent over the period of the agreement and that's at a time</p>
<p>   of zero inflation. On top of that, we gave the States an extra amount</p>
<p>   of money when we brought in the Gold Card for those additionial</p>
<p>   50 000 World War Two veterans because paying for them is already</p>
<p>   in the base that we've given to the States and by rights, we</p>
<p>   should have taken that out of the base when we brought in the Gold</p>
<p>   Card but we are leaving it in there, so that's just a free</p>
<p>   gift of additionial money for the States. Queensland has signed</p>
<p>   up because it thinks the arrangements are fair. We will honour the</p>
<p>   offer we made from the first of July and there were some other benefits</p>
<p>   in the health area that were announced last night.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But isn't the bottom line here that people... whether it's</p>
<p>   just Victoria or right around the country, the hospitals aren't</p>
<p>   working properly because of this dispute.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No that's not right. I mean, the dispute itself has not affected</p>
<p>   the operation of the hospitals. The dispute at the moment is manifested</p>
<p>   in a debate between those States that haven't signed up and</p>
<p>   the Commonwealth Government and that's not affecting the quality</p>
<p>   of care.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It's affected public confidence in the system, I think.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Neil, the States ultimately are responsible for their hospitals</p>
<p>   and the stark facts are that under the health care agreement they</p>
<p>   are getting the increase that I just described. The general tax</p>
<p>   payments that are going from the Commonwealth to the States are</p>
<p>   going to go up by almost 5 per cent next year and that's in</p>
<p>   a time of zero inflation and we argue with those figures that the</p>
<p>   States have received fair provision from us and it's up to</p>
<p>   them, with their own resources, to provide the services that are</p>
<p>   needed within their own States. You can't have it both ways.</p>
<p>   You can't assert the right to run a State fully without Commonwealth</p>
<p>   interference in the areas of your responsibility and then, whenever</p>
<p>   there is a shortfall, simply turn around and say, if the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   Government would give us more money there would be no problem. We</p>
<p>   have to put a measure of reasonableness over any claim made by the</p>
<p>   States and we have done that and we think on any measure, what we</p>
<p>   are offering in a time of zero inflation is very fair.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I wonder, could I just ask you about the social bonus that was to</p>
<p>   come out of Telstra. Now I didn't see any specific reference</p>
<p>   to that ....</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No because there was no announcement made about it. We are yet to</p>
<p>   make a decision on that.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But still, the social bonus will still be there?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes, very definitely. I made that very clear. The size of it</p>
<p>   and where it is going to go we haven't decided but we will</p>
<p>   be taking out of the proceeds of selling the remaining two thirds</p>
<p>   of Telstra to the Australian people, we will be taking a social</p>
<p>   bonus out of that. That certainly has not changed and the announcement</p>
<p>   I made on that remains but that's something that we will make</p>
<p>   statements on further down the track.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Just on the economy finally, Mr Howard, if I might, this doesn't</p>
<p>   look all that bright for the year ahead. Asia, the prediction is,</p>
<p>   Asia is going to hit quickly and heavily. The dollar has gone down</p>
<p>   further today. Inflation, it is forecast inflation to be up. Unemployment</p>
<p>   stable but as we discussed, not great. Current account deficit bad.</p>
<p>   Why is this a good economy?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because it's still growing very strongly. It's still growing</p>
<p>   at at least 3 percent a year by the end of the coming financial</p>
<p>   year.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But even that's not a great...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Compared to the rest of the world it's a terrific figure and</p>
<p>   the other reason it's a great economy is that we, despite the</p>
<p>   very, very modest hiccup that you mentioned in inflation, we've</p>
<p>   now got the lowest rate for 30 years. We've got the lowest</p>
<p>   interest rates for more than 30 years and we've got a very</p>
<p>   high level of business investment and we are no longer living beyond</p>
<p>   our means and by the turn of the century with the sale of the rest</p>
<p>   of Telstra, we will have our debt level down to an unbelievably</p>
<p>   low proportion of GDP, the sort of freedom from debt that this country</p>
<p>   has not experienced in the lifetime of anybody listening to this</p>
<p>   programme.</p>
<p> MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p> ends</p>
