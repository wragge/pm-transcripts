FOR MEDIA EMBARGOED UNTIL 6.00 PM WEDNESDAY 11 APRIL 1990<br />
Together with the Minister for Science and Technology and<br />
the Minister Assisting me on Science, Simon Crean, I am<br />
announcing today the winners of the inaugural Australia<br />
Prize. The international award is shared jointly by<br />
Professor Allen Kerr of the University of Adelaide,<br />
Professor Jeff Schell of the Max Planck Institute in Cologne<br />
and Professor Eugene Nester of the University of Washington.<br />
This year's prize, valued at A$ 250,000, is awarded for<br />
outstanding achievement in science and technology promoting<br />
human welfare in the field of biological sciences related to<br />
agriculture or the environment. Professors Kerr, Schell and<br />
Nester are honoured for their achievements in genetic<br />
engineering of plants and microbes which will ensure a more<br />
productive and environmentally benign agriculture for the<br />
future. The three scientists have led research teams which, over the<br />
past 20 years, have provided some of the most crucial<br />
insights into the biology and genetic systems of the crown<br />
gall bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. This bacterium<br />
can be considered as a natural genetic engineer. It can<br />
transfer DNA from bacterial cell to plant cell. This DNA<br />
directs the plant to synthesize hormones which promote<br />
uncontrolled cell division and tumour development. The<br />
hormone synthesizing genes have been located and, for<br />
genetic engineering of plants, eliminated. They can be<br />
replaced by more desirable genes.<br />
These studies have led to the construction of genetically<br />
engineered plants that are resistant to herbicides, to<br />
insect pests and to viruses. Plants can also be directed to<br />
produce pharmaceutical compounds. In addition, basic<br />
studies on gene regulation in plants depend on this<br />
technology. Clearly, the genetic engineering of plants is<br />
-' oing to have a major impact on crop improvement, on basic<br />
studies in plant biology and on the pharmaceutical industry.<br />
It will also lead to less environmental pollution and<br />
degradation. Herbicides are used mainly to allow crop<br />
production by minimum soil disturbance; this markedly<br />
reduces soil erosion, a serious environmental problem in<br />
Australia. Insect pests and diseases of plants are usually<br />
controlled by toxic chemicals. The construction of<br />
resistant plants will reduce the requirement for such<br />
chemicals. </p>
<p>The three scientists and their research teams have made<br />
breakthroughs which will radically alter our approach to<br />
agriculture in the 21st century. Providing a biological<br />
alternative to chemical disease and pest control will ensure<br />
a safer and cleaner planet.<br />
The Government established the Australia Prize last year as<br />
part of its commitment to science and technology in this<br />
country. The funding of scientific research is an<br />
investment that will repay itself many times over through<br />
the benefits to humanity and through boosting of our<br />
national scientific and technological capacity.<br />
I look forward to presenting the prize and an inscribed<br />
medal to the winners at a ceremony which will be held in<br />
Parliament House on 14 May 1990.<br />
