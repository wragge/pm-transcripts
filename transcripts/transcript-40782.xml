    <content><![CDATA[<p>I look forward to welcoming His Excellency Mr Joko Widodo, President of the Republic Indonesia, and Her Excellency Mrs Hj Iriana Joko Widodo, to Australia from 25–26 February.</p>
<p>The visit will highlight Australia’s deepening economic and strategic links with Indonesia. The bilateral relationship with Indonesia is vitally important to both countries and has never been stronger.</p>
<p>As close friends and neighbours, Australia and Indonesia have a long, shared history. And as multicultural democracies, our countries have developed a strong 21st century partnership spanning broad areas of cooperation, including trade, tourism, counter-terrorism, education and disaster relief.</p>
<p>During this visit, President Widodo and I will hold our Annual Leaders’ Meeting as we continue to further strengthen the Australia-Indonesia relationship.</p>
<p>Identifying opportunities for expanding our economic, investment and commercial relationship will be a focus of our discussions, including our commitment to concluding a high-quality Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement later this year. This Agreement will benefit Indonesians and Australians alike, generating jobs, promoting business and boosting investment.</p>
<p>Indonesia is also one of Australia’s most valued counter-terrorism partners. Our practical cooperation makes our communities safer and our region more secure.</p>
<p>I look forward to my talks with President Widodo and returning the warm hospitality I enjoyed during my visit to Jakarta in 2015.</p>
