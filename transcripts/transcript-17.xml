COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
RT. HON. R. G. MENZJES, M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
CONSTITUTION ALTERATION ( POST-WAR<br />
RECONSTRUCTION) BILL 1944.<br />
[ Fromn the " Parliamentary Debates," 23rd Februtry, 1944.]<br />
Mr. ) IEES Kooyong-ileader of<br />
the Opposition) am grateful<br />
to the Prime Minister ( Mr. Curtin) for<br />
the consideration that he has shown me,<br />
because I fear that it will not be possible<br />
for me to deal with this matter very<br />
briefly. Every bill to amend the Constitution<br />
deserves the earnest attention<br />
of everybody in this country. This bill<br />
contains fourteen proposals for the<br />
amendment of the Constitution, and I1 am<br />
sure that honorable members will regard<br />
me as merely discharging my duty as<br />
Leader of the Opposition if I submit the<br />
u measure to close examination. I desire<br />
to do that. I believe that it is undesirable<br />
in time of war to hold a referendum<br />
on proposed changes of the Constitution.<br />
The Government is familiar with the<br />
views of myself and others regarding, this<br />
matter. Those views may perhaps be<br />
summed up by saying, that at the time<br />
when hundreds of thousands of people are<br />
completely preoccupied by war matters,<br />
and many of them by fighting, it is not<br />
possible to get that calm and dispassionate<br />
judgment which constitutional<br />
changes deserve. However, the Government<br />
has introduced the bill, which<br />
authorizes the taking of a referendum.<br />
2155. Therefore, I assume that a referendum<br />
will occur. Consequently, it becomes<br />
necessary for us, as members of this<br />
House, to consider these proposals on<br />
their merits-not solely their academic<br />
merits, but their merits in the cireumstanees<br />
of the country as they now exist<br />
and as they are likely to exist for some<br />
time to come.<br />
The Attorney-General ( Dr. EVatt), in<br />
moving tile second reading of the bill,<br />
said, in language which I have employed<br />
at one time or another, that amendments<br />
to the Constitution ' should not be<br />
approached on a party footing, and that<br />
these are questions which are above and<br />
beyond party. Well, we all say that<br />
when they are our own proposals. When<br />
we are in office, we invariably beg all<br />
others to consider the matter on a nonparty<br />
basis. I have recollections, reinforced<br />
by a considerable perusal of<br />
Uansard in the last few weeks, of amendments<br />
put f orward by honorable members<br />
on this side of the House, when we<br />
were in office. Those proposals incurred<br />
grave criticism from the Labour<br />
party, though they were designed to increase<br />
the powers of the National Parliament..<br />
Just as honorable members<br />
JCN C) </p>
<p>opposite have sometimes not hesitated to<br />
say, that whilst they would like certain<br />
powers, they would not like an anti-<br />
Labour government to possess them, so<br />
must every honoratble member on this<br />
side of the chamber now take into consideration<br />
the nature of the Government,<br />
any time limit, and the proposals themselves.<br />
Normally, of course, amendments<br />
to the Constitution should not be discussed<br />
or decided on a party basis, and<br />
that is particularly true when we are<br />
making permanent changes in the Constitution.<br />
The Constitution is designed<br />
to accommodate contending political<br />
policies, and the needs of contending or<br />
successive governments. But, at the<br />
present time, that may be regarded as a<br />
counsel of perfection, because the amendments<br />
that are nowv before this Rouse<br />
are to operate for a limited period and<br />
for special purposes. Honorable members<br />
should bear in mind that these proposals<br />
are for a limited period of five<br />
years after the conclusion of hostilities<br />
in this war. We would be indeed<br />
curiously superhuman if we failed to take<br />
into account the probability that for a<br />
considerable portion of that time, at any<br />
rate, the government of this country will<br />
be highly coloured by the views of the<br />
Labour party. Whilst I know that there<br />
is good precedent for the view that the<br />
Government will be out of office in twelve<br />
months, I think I may say, without giving<br />
anything away, that the chances are<br />
against that happening. With the Government<br />
possessing such a commanding<br />
majority as it has in this House and<br />
with a large majority, in the homely<br />
phrase, coming up in the lift and due<br />
to arrive in July in the Senate, the<br />
chances are that practical working<br />
politics will for some period be highly<br />
coloured and influenced by the views of<br />
the Labour party.<br />
Mr. SHEEHAN.-We had nine years of<br />
United Australia party governments.<br />
Mr. MENZIESL-That is so; and the<br />
country will have another nine years of<br />
them. Do not doubt that! But the consideration<br />
which ii have mentioned is<br />
one which is quite proper to bear in<br />
mind when the Government asks for<br />
amendments to the Constitution for a<br />
limited period of time. Indeed, I am<br />
perfectly certain that that consideration will not be exactly absent from the minds<br />
of my friends opposite when they go on<br />
the hustings to advocate an affirmative<br />
vote. After all, the Government has<br />
publicly associated its political programmes<br />
with its quest for additional<br />
constitutional powvers, and I see no reason<br />
why that which has been joined together<br />
by the Government should be put asunder<br />
by mcmbers of the Opposition. ' Why<br />
Phoitld we divorce these two things? So I<br />
say that this problem is not one to be discussed<br />
academically. We are not in an<br />
academic debating society. We are here<br />
in the National Parliament to determine<br />
whether these powers should be written<br />
into the Constitution; whether. these<br />
powers that are to be written into the<br />
Constitution should go to the people; and<br />
how we shall stand in relation to our<br />
advocacy of them. That does not mean<br />
that because we are opposed to this<br />
Govern M'ent it should be deprived of the<br />
powers which any government would<br />
nieed to have. That, of course,<br />
would be utter folly on the part of the<br />
Onposition. But it does mean that<br />
an alert Opposition is in duty bound to<br />
scrutinize these requested powers with<br />
great care in order to satisfy itself that<br />
they are needed and that, if obtained.<br />
they will be properly exercised. The<br />
Opposition is bound also to take such<br />
steps as it can take to see that the powers1<br />
sought are not in excess of the real re<br />
quirements for the period in question.<br />
It is odd-but perhaps it is not politically<br />
odd-that the Government has so<br />
far preserved a high degree of silence, if<br />
that is a permissible expression, on the<br />
problem of why these new powers are!<br />
needed and of what would be done under<br />
them. We know, in a general way, what<br />
the Government's political programme is,<br />
buAt t tthhei s Gpoovinert, n more ntth ahta ps oinnot, t soauird ptoow eurss, a'<br />
stop short of enabling us to do this thing<br />
or that thing which should be done It<br />
is not enough for the Government to<br />
wave a rhetorical hand and say, We<br />
cannot deal with this problem or that<br />
problem unless we have more power<br />
If it does so, the people may well ask:<br />
Why cannot you do so? What do you<br />
want to do in relation to employment?<br />
Will you tell us what you want to do and<br />
how far the things you desire to do </p>
<p>are beyond the existing constitutional<br />
powers? If such questions were answered<br />
we should, at least, have a clear-cut issue<br />
upon which we could reach a balanced<br />
decision." I wish to make one other point before<br />
turning to the bill. Every honorablh<br />
member who has ever held office in the<br />
Commonwealth Government must have<br />
realized how true it is that under a<br />
federation the central power is always<br />
seeking to increase its authority. I believe<br />
it was James Bryce who once referred<br />
to " the tremendous centripetal<br />
force in a federation<br />
Mr. SPENDER.-That could be said of<br />
all powers.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-That is true. Power<br />
always seeks to add to itself. Under a<br />
federation the central power is always<br />
seeking to add to itself. That is perhaps<br />
not a bad thing. But the view is so<br />
commonly held that the central power is<br />
always wiser and more efficient than the<br />
local government that I must point out<br />
that it is not sound doctrine. Why is the<br />
central government wiser or more efficient<br />
than the local government? As a<br />
matter of fact a writer in New South<br />
Wales has recently pointed out that one<br />
of the curses of Australia. administratively<br />
speaking, is that we have no adequate<br />
tradition of local government,<br />
local administration, or regional administration.<br />
It is unfortunate that we have<br />
the growing tradition that as the central<br />
power is located in Canberra all questions<br />
must be referred to Canberra. Centralized<br />
power with decentralized administration<br />
focuses epigrammatically<br />
a very striking view, but we have no<br />
great tradition in Australia yet of decentralized<br />
administration. On the contrary,<br />
we have almost invariably tended<br />
to accompany more centralized power<br />
with a more centralized administration.<br />
The other night I was reading-and I<br />
always find it a stimulating exercisesome<br />
of the discussions that occurred in<br />
the great days of constitutional debate in<br />
the United States of America between<br />
Alexander Hamilton and Thomas<br />
Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson, after all,<br />
was a great liberal thinker. He preferred<br />
the liberty of the subject to the power of<br />
government, just as Hamilton seemed to<br />
prefer the power of government to the liberty of the. subject. Although I do not<br />
necessarily adopt as having full modern<br />
application the following passage in<br />
which Jefferson stated his views, I think<br />
it has great wisdom in relation to a large<br />
and scattered country like our ownthe<br />
way to have good and safe<br />
government is not to trust it all to one, but to<br />
divide it among the many, distributing to<br />
every one exactly the functions he is competent<br />
to fulfil What has detrnyed<br />
liberty and the rights of men in every government<br />
which has ever existed under the sun?<br />
The generalizing and concentrating all cares<br />
and ' powers into one body, no matter whether<br />
of the autocrats of Russia or France, or ot<br />
the aristocrats of a Venetian senate. And I<br />
do believe that if the Almighty has not<br />
decreed that man shall never be free ( and it<br />
is a blasphemy to believe it), the secret<br />
will be found to be in the making himself'the<br />
depository of the powers respecting himself,<br />
so far as he is competent to them, and. delegating<br />
only what is beyond his competence by<br />
a synthetical procees, to higher and higher<br />
orders of functionaries, so as to trust fewer<br />
and fewer powers in proportion as the trustees<br />
become more and more oligarchical.<br />
The passage is couched in the<br />
phraseology of 125 years ago, but if honorable<br />
members will direct their minds to<br />
the notions in it they will see that the<br />
claim that the central government has, in<br />
itself, some virtue denied to local government<br />
can be put aside by five minutes of<br />
quiet reasoning.<br />
The next point I wish to make is that<br />
in practically all the statements made by<br />
or on behalf of the Government in<br />
respect of this most important bill, it is<br />
suggested or stated that the Commonwealth<br />
Government will be inadequately<br />
equipped to deal with immediate pos. t-war<br />
problems in the transition period unless<br />
its powers be much enlarged. I am not<br />
quarrelling with the putting forward of<br />
that claim, but I shall proceed to examine<br />
it in order to see just how far it is true.<br />
I shall therefore turn, first, to the existing<br />
powers of the Commonwealth. When<br />
any government asks for more power to<br />
deal with certain problems it is right that<br />
we should ask, What power does the<br />
Government now possess? There is a<br />
very widespread failure to appreciate the<br />
nature of the powers already possessed<br />
by -the Commonwealth, and I esteem it<br />
to be my duty to put before the House<br />
and, through the House, to the people,<br />
for their consideration, the nature of the </p>
<p>powers already possessed by the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament and Government<br />
to deal with the immediate post-war<br />
problems. I shall take these more<br />
in their order of constitutional expression<br />
than in their order of<br />
importance. ' Section 51 of the Constitution<br />
clothes the Commonwealth,<br />
in the first place, with power to make<br />
laws with respect to trade and commerce<br />
with other countries, and among the<br />
States. We have talked a great deal about<br />
the trade and commerce power as<br />
something not possessed by the Commonwealth,<br />
and have apparently forgotten<br />
that the ' Commonwealth has power<br />
to deal with trade and commerce<br />
" with other countries and among<br />
the States". It is that power which<br />
has authorized this Parliament to legislate<br />
with respect to such matters as overseas<br />
exchange and overseas investments.<br />
These fall within the ambit of overseas<br />
trade and commerce. It is under this<br />
power, also, that this Parliament, for<br />
many years before this war, attempted<br />
to deal with orderly marketing of primary<br />
products. In that period before the war,<br />
the difficulty that arose was not a difficulty<br />
which existed because of the inherent<br />
quality of the power of the Commonwealth;<br />
it existed because of section<br />
92 of the Constitution. That section says<br />
that trade, commerce and intercourse<br />
among the States shall be absolutely free.<br />
Because of that guaranteed freedom of<br />
interstate trade, the Commonwealth and<br />
the ' States may make agreements on<br />
marketing. as they have done repeatedly;<br />
they may give them statutory form in<br />
their respective Parliaments, as they<br />
have done repeatedly; the right honorable<br />
member for Cowper ( Dr. Earle<br />
Page) is a veteran of such discussions.<br />
Then, section 92 would, so to speak, pop<br />
up and say: " That is very well; but<br />
you cannot touch the interstate transaction<br />
except in a very limited fashion,<br />
so your scheme has a crack in it and will<br />
ultimately break up and disappear I<br />
recall that matter, not only because I<br />
want to point out that, subject to section<br />
92, the interstate trade and commerce<br />
power is a very great one, but also<br />
because, oddly enough, I am not able to<br />
find in this bill any proposal for the<br />
amendment of section 92. Dr. EVATT.-The right honorable<br />
gentleman means that it is not there?<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-It is not there.<br />
Dr. EvAr.-That is correct.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-In other words,<br />
section 92 is to remain unamended.<br />
Mr. SPENDER.-But not necessarily the<br />
same construction will be placed upon it.<br />
Dr. EVAT'r.-All the powers will be<br />
subject to the existing constitutional<br />
restrictions, including those contained in<br />
section 92.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-The honorable member<br />
for Warringah ( Mr. Spender), in an<br />
interjection that is not to be disregarded,<br />
points out that an altered form of certain<br />
matters in the Constitution may lead to<br />
an altered interpretation of section 92.<br />
I should not expect it, and I venture to<br />
think that the Attorney-. General, too,<br />
would not. Consequently, section 92<br />
stands. Dr. EVATT.-That is right.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-The next power<br />
which the Commonwealth has is the<br />
power of taxation. I wonder whether or<br />
not it is yet fully realized that it is<br />
under this taxation power, not under the<br />
war powers, that the Commonwealth has<br />
been able recently. to institute uniform<br />
income tax<br />
Mr. ' CAIVELL.-TIh State Premiers<br />
understand it.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Under the uniform<br />
income tax law the State is, in substance<br />
-the form does not matter-removed<br />
from the income tax field, and the Commonwealth<br />
completely occupies it. We<br />
know quite well that the Commonwealth<br />
now collects all income tax, and makes<br />
a grant to the States under a power to<br />
which I shall refer a little later, as some<br />
recompense to them for the loss of their<br />
income tax revenue. That power to<br />
impose uniform and, therefore, in practice,<br />
exclusive income tax, belongs to the<br />
Commonwealth under its taxation power;<br />
and its taxation power is not a war<br />
power, but a permanent power. What<br />
has been done in relation to income tax<br />
can quite plainly be done in relation to<br />
land tax and entertainments tax. There<br />
is no direct form of taxation which, in<br />
view of the decision of the High Court,<br />
cannot be made exclusive to the Commonwealth<br />
under this constitutional power. </p>
<p>Dr. EVATT.-How could the same<br />
principle be applied to land tax?<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-The Commonwealth<br />
need only make the land tax so high<br />
that no State would dare to impose one<br />
subsequently; consequently, it would br<br />
exclusive to the Commonwealth. I hope<br />
that my friend the Attorney-General will<br />
keep that to himself, not tell the Treaurer;<br />
I do not want to incite anybody in<br />
this matter.<br />
The next power is the power to impose<br />
indirect taxes, such as customs and excise.<br />
The taxing powers have always been<br />
exclusive to the Commonwealth under<br />
section 90 of the Constitution. If we<br />
combine the direct and the indirect taxing<br />
power, we find that all means of<br />
revenue other than loan-with which I<br />
shall deal in a moment-are within the<br />
grasp of the Commonwealth, and that<br />
through them the Commonwealth can, in<br />
fct, exclude the States entirely. I mention<br />
this power because, after all, a<br />
mendous lot of what will have to be done<br />
by governments in the face of post-war<br />
emergency will call for monetary<br />
resources and power; and it can hardly<br />
be said that a government is destitnute<br />
when, in fact, it controls-or, if it so<br />
wishes, can control-every form of<br />
revenue derived by pecuniary imposts of<br />
any kind within the limits of the Commonwealth<br />
of Australia.<br />
From that I turn to the other source of<br />
' revenue-borrowing. What about the<br />
borrowing power? The Commonwealth<br />
has always had a borrowing power; and<br />
ever since the Financial Agreement, and<br />
the amendment written into the Constitu-<br />
' ion in order to facilitate or validat that<br />
' agreement, the Commonwealth, acting in<br />
its place in the Loan Council and utilizing<br />
the Loan Council machinery, has, in<br />
substance, been placed in control of the<br />
loan revenues of Australia. It is quite<br />
true that, in theory, the Commonwealth<br />
can be outvoted on the Loan Council. 1<br />
is equally true that, in practice, it never<br />
has been. Therefore, whether the source<br />
of money be taxation or loan, the Commonwealth<br />
occupies in this country an<br />
undisputed position in relation to it.<br />
The next in this category of powers<br />
dealing with finance is to be found in<br />
c'ction 96 of the Constitution. It is under that section that the Commonwealth Parliament<br />
can provide grants to States. Tts<br />
relevant words are these--<br />
The Parliamentthat<br />
is, the Parliament of the Commonwealthmay<br />
grant financial assistance to any State mI<br />
such terms and conditions as the Parliament<br />
thinks fit.<br />
In the years 1918, 1919 . and 1920, the<br />
years immediately after hostilities on the<br />
last occasion, the significance of section<br />
96 was not fully understood. Somebody<br />
thought, if he thought at all, that it was<br />
a section which enabled some special compensation<br />
to be given to a State; in other<br />
words, that it could justify a body such<br />
as the ' Commonwealth Grants Coinnlission,<br />
and the making of special grants to<br />
South Australia, Western Australia and<br />
Tasmania. But a few years later it was<br />
discovered, and the matter was decided<br />
by the High Court, that section 96 went<br />
far beyond that; because, in 1926, the<br />
Federal Air Roads Act was challenged<br />
by three States in the High Court.<br />
If I may be permitted a personal<br />
recollection, I recall that I was counsel<br />
for the challengers, that I had lumbago<br />
very badly, and six hostile judges in<br />
front of me equally badly, and that I<br />
failed completely.<br />
It was argued in that case that,<br />
although section 96 stated that Parliament<br />
could grant money to a State on<br />
such terms and conditions as it thought<br />
fit, it could not attach to the grant<br />
any conditions which amounted in substance<br />
to the exercise of legislative<br />
authority which it did not otherwise<br />
possess. In other words, we argued<br />
that the Commonwealth could not grant<br />
money to the States, and attach conditions<br />
setting out where the roads were<br />
to be built, by whom they were to be<br />
built, and what kind of roads they<br />
should be, because the Commonwealth<br />
had no power to make legislation regarding<br />
the building of roads. However, the<br />
High Court dismissed that argument. It<br />
held that section 96 meant just what it<br />
said, namely, that the Commonwealth<br />
could grant money to the States as it<br />
thought fit, and that it could attach any<br />
conditions it liked to the grant.<br />
Dr. EATrr.-Any relevant conditic: nt. </p>
<p>Mr. MENZIES.-Yes, relevant to the<br />
granting of the money. In other words,<br />
the Commonwealth Government can say<br />
to the States, " We are granting you<br />
this money, and it is for a certain purpose,<br />
and we now set down in a schedule<br />
all the rules which you must observe<br />
Let us take another example: Suppose<br />
the Commonwealth wanted to embark<br />
upon a Commonwealth-wide housing<br />
scheme despite the fact that it had no<br />
legislative power to make laws in respect<br />
of housing. The Commonwealth, as the<br />
sole provider of funds, could say to a<br />
State, We will give you œ 5,000,000, and<br />
the conditions upon which you are to<br />
receive this money are these The<br />
terms and conditions, as prepared by<br />
the Commonwealth housing authority,<br />
would then he stated.<br />
Mr. ARCHIE CAMERON.-As the Cnmmonwealth<br />
did in 1928.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-That is so. The<br />
point I am making is that, in respect of<br />
the group of powers which I have been<br />
discussing, the Commonwealth has complete<br />
financial authority, and there is<br />
ample machinery to enable the Commcowealth<br />
to impose its will upon thec<br />
States. I now come to the defence power of<br />
the Commonwealth, and I am saved the<br />
necezsity of saying much on this subject,<br />
because the Attorney-General himself<br />
referred to it, and analysed its chief<br />
features in his last speech. The defence<br />
power of the Commonwealth is not one<br />
those powers the limits of which can<br />
be defined with certainty. Indeed, T<br />
scmetimes wonder whether there are any<br />
powers under the Constitution the limits<br />
of which can be defined with certainty,<br />
because, in the last resort, all the powers<br />
in the Constitution mean what the High<br />
Court of Australia ultimately says they<br />
mean. Mr. HOLT.-And from time to time.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Yes, and from time<br />
to time. However, the defence power<br />
oi the Commonwealth in respect of certain<br />
imattc: rs is, I believe, beyond<br />
ci, ntroversy, and one of those matters is<br />
tih power of repatriation. I confess thati<br />
when I looked at this bill I was<br />
astonished to see in the forefront of it<br />
reference to repatriation. Why should<br />
it be included? This is the first time that it has ever been suggested to me that<br />
the Commonwealth did not possess this<br />
power. I can understand its obvious electioneering<br />
value as something to put in<br />
the shop window, but never before has it<br />
been suggested that the Commonwealth<br />
did not possess the power stated in paragraph<br />
of proposed new section<br />
51A. I can recall only one case in<br />
the period between the two wars in which<br />
the exercise by the Commonwealth of its<br />
repatriation power was ever challenged.<br />
I refer to the case of the Attorney-<br />
General for the Commonwealth v.<br />
Palding, 27 398. The question<br />
arose as to the priority to be enjoyed<br />
by repatriation authorities in respect of<br />
debts. I quote from the judgment of the<br />
former Chief Justice, Sir Adrian Knox,<br />
Mr. Justice Isaacs, Mr. Justice Gavan<br />
Duffy and Mr. Justice Rich. There was<br />
a separate and concurring judgment by<br />
Mr. Justice Higgins. The court unanimously<br />
and briefly gave its judgment in<br />
these terms-<br />
In our opinion, the Commonwealth Parliament<br />
had power under section 51 ( vi) of the<br />
Constitution ( the defence power) to enact this<br />
provision. It is a provision for the reestablishment<br />
in civil life of persons who have<br />
served in the defence forces of the Commonwealth<br />
when they are discharged from such<br />
service. That is a matter so intimately connected<br />
with the defence of the Commonwealth<br />
as manifestly to be included within the scope<br />
of the power.<br />
Mr. ABnoTT.-Would that apply to<br />
munitions workers?<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Why not? They are<br />
brought into existence as munitions<br />
workers in order to serve the interests of<br />
the country in the exercise of its defence<br />
power, just as soldiers, sailors and airmen<br />
are brought into existence in their respective<br />
capacities in order to serve the interests<br />
of the country. Am I to be told<br />
that, although the Commonwealth may<br />
repatriate a soldier-that is, put him out<br />
of military life and into a civil job-it is<br />
iot, under the defence power, at liberty to<br />
toke a worker out of a munitions factory<br />
S-nd put him into another job? Such<br />
reasoning would not hold water for five<br />
: iinutes in a court of law. My view is<br />
that whatever the defence power enables<br />
you to do in time of war it enables you<br />
to undo in time of peace. If the defence<br />
Ipower authorizes the Commonwealth, in<br />
the course of fighting a war, to mobilize </p>
<p>the entire nation, it equally authorizes<br />
the Commonwealth to demobilize the<br />
nation during the period of transition<br />
from war to peace. It is an error to<br />
suppose that great constitutional powers<br />
work only in one direction. It was Sir<br />
Isaac Isaacs who stated on one occasion<br />
that the Constitution is not to<br />
he mocked What an absurd thing<br />
it would be if far-reaching powers enabled<br />
the Commonwealth Government to take<br />
the country fromn this point to that, hut.<br />
ti. nn made it necessary for the Governiicnt<br />
to leave the country there with all<br />
the resultant confusioln.<br />
. Mr. lMorAm. x.-Does the defence power<br />
give the Commonwealth Government,<br />
Sauthority to enforce preference to returned<br />
soldiers?<br />
Mr. MENZLES.-Yes, that authority<br />
falls abundantly within the defence<br />
power. The Attorney-General, in the<br />
ook vwhich he prepared in connexion<br />
with the Constitution Convention, stated<br />
that, although the defence power would<br />
enable the Commonwealth to unwind the<br />
war effort, it would not enable the Coinmonwealth<br />
to wind up the peace effort.<br />
1 dislike these sayings, which attempt to<br />
over-simplify problems. The fact is that<br />
you do not unwind the war effort and<br />
then set about winding up the peace<br />
effort. It is the unwinding of the war<br />
ef'ohr whlich constitutes the winding up<br />
of the peace effort. They are identical<br />
processes. I shall be most astonished to<br />
' 1 be told by the court, by any authority,<br />
a year, two years, or three years after<br />
this war that everything that is done<br />
under the defence power just drops as<br />
soon as the war finishes. It would he<br />
a monstrous power. It would not be a<br />
defence power in those circumstaincc<br />
but a destruction power.<br />
The next powers that I want to refer<br />
to are those relating to banking<br />
and currency. The Commonwealth,<br />
under its currency and banking powers.<br />
which it both possesses and employs.<br />
rot only deals with the mechaniec<br />
of the note issue, but also exerci. ses<br />
effective control over central banking.<br />
the creation of credit, and a great number<br />
of those elements which bear upon the<br />
stabilization of finance. All these thines<br />
it does under its existing powers.<br />
It has its insurance power and, under its insurance power, schemes of health<br />
and unemployment insurance can be.<br />
instituted, so long as they are . purely,.<br />
insurance, that is, so long as they possess<br />
the contributory character.<br />
Mr. POLLARD.-Ah!<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-If they are not-to.<br />
possess the insurance character-and I i<br />
know that my honorable friend does not<br />
want them to-no doubt the Common-,,<br />
wealth will have to look elsewhere for-.<br />
the power. For myself, I will be no<br />
party to giving it the power, because<br />
I believe that all these social schemes<br />
ought to be based on the insurance<br />
principle. Then there is the power to<br />
deal with invalid and old-age pensions.<br />
That power has already been very fully<br />
exercised by this Parliament.<br />
Next, there is a power about which I<br />
speak with diffidence in the presence of<br />
the Attorney-General, because he has, 1<br />
think, some claim to be the author of<br />
its extension, and that is the external<br />
affairs power. This, though technical,<br />
is of profound importance and<br />
interest. The external affairs power was<br />
conferred on the Commonwealth just in<br />
those terms, " external affairs", and, for<br />
a long time, it was thought to be a<br />
power which gave authority to the Commonwealth<br />
to make laws on things which<br />
were, in . the true sense, external to<br />
Australia, foreign obligations, foreign<br />
representation and that kind of thing,<br />
until it was finally put to . the High<br />
Court, which approved the submission<br />
that external affairs went far beyond<br />
such limits, and that in fact if<br />
Australia made a treaty which was<br />
within its competence, the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament could give effect<br />
to that treaty, notwithstanding that<br />
no other power dealing with the<br />
matter was to be found in section 51.<br />
Let me give an illustration. Suppose<br />
Australia became a party to a treaty<br />
with New Zealand-I mean a real treaty<br />
with New Zealand-and that in* that<br />
treaty the Commonwealth and New<br />
Zealand agreed that, for their mutual<br />
advancement in this part of the world,<br />
it was of first importance that there<br />
should be a standard 40-hour working<br />
week in both countries. It would never<br />
have occurred to me that the making of </p>
<p>that treaty would give the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament power to declare a<br />
week, but so far as I understand<br />
it the High Count has held that it does.<br />
Mr. CALWELL.-A good decision.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-The justices of the<br />
High Court would be delighted to have<br />
the honorable gentleman's approval, with<br />
his technical knowledge of these matters.<br />
The moment I say that, honorable members<br />
will see how far-reaching the external<br />
affairs power can become, and<br />
what a tremendous instrument it is in the<br />
hands of the Commonwealth. It is no<br />
use quoting your second best when you<br />
can quote your best. That is a very old<br />
rule. Therefore, I will refer briefly to<br />
what was said in the High Court of<br />
Australia in the case Rex v. Burgess. It<br />
arose over the airman Goya Henry. My<br />
honorable friend the member for Balaclava<br />
( Mr. White) will remember what<br />
the case was. Under the Air Convention<br />
the Commonwealth Parliament had<br />
sought to make laws for Ihe national<br />
control of -the air. Mr. Justice Evatt, as<br />
he then was, and Mr. Justice McTiernan,<br />
in a careful and considered joint judgment<br />
said, 55 C. L. R. 6S0-<br />
But it is a consequence of the closer con<br />
nexion between the nations of the world<br />
( which has been partly brought about by the<br />
modern revolutions in communication) and ot<br />
the recognition by the nations of a common<br />
interest in many matters affecting the social<br />
welfare of their peoples and of the necessity<br />
of co-operation among them in dealing with<br />
such matters, that it is no longer possible to<br />
assert that there is any subject-matter which<br />
must necessarily be excluded from the list of<br />
possible subjects of international negotiation,<br />
international dispute or international agreement.<br />
By way of illustration, let us note<br />
that Part XIII. of the Treaty of Versailles<br />
declares that universal peace can be established<br />
only if it is based upon social justice<br />
and that labour unrest caused by unsatisfactory<br />
conditions of labour imperils the peac"<br />
of the world. In face of these declarations<br />
and the setting up ( under the treaty) of the<br />
International Labour Organization it must now<br />
be recognized that the maintenance or improvement<br />
of conditions of labour can ( as it does)<br />
form a proper subject of international agreement,<br />
for differences in labour standards nma)<br />
increase the friction between nations which<br />
arises even when trade competition takes place<br />
under conditions of reasonable equality.<br />
Honorable members will follow the<br />
reasoning of that. It is very powerful<br />
reacci ng and it is very pertinent t this<br />
prc-bkm. Later, on page 687, ' Their Honours dealt with the question as to<br />
whether external affairs power was confined<br />
to treaties and conventions of a<br />
formal kind, and they said this:-<br />
It would seem clear, therefore, that tie<br />
legislative power of the Commonwealth over<br />
external affairs" certainly includes tlhe<br />
power to execute within the Commonwealth<br />
treaties and conventions entered into with<br />
foreign powers. The legislative power in section<br />
51 is granted " subject to this Constitution"<br />
so that such treaties and conventions could<br />
not be used to enable the Parliament to set at<br />
nought constitutional guarantees elsewhere<br />
contained, such, for instance, as sections 6, 28,<br />
41, SO, 92, 09, 100, 110, or 117. But it is not<br />
to be assumed that the legislative power over<br />
external affairs is limited to the execution<br />
of treaties or conventions; and, to pursue the<br />
illustration previously referred to, the Parliamnent<br />
may well be deemed competent to legislate<br />
for the carrying out of recommendations<br />
as well as the draft international conventions<br />
resolved upon by the International<br />
Labour Organization or of other international<br />
recommendations or requests upon othe.<br />
subject-matters of concern to Australia as : a<br />
member of the family of nations. The power<br />
is a great and important one.<br />
The power they quoted very rightly is<br />
a great and important one.<br />
Mr. McEwEN.-Would that apply to<br />
the control of, say, acreage production of<br />
primary products pursuant to an international<br />
agreement?<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-On that reasoning,<br />
yes. Dr. EvATT.-I said that in my secondreading<br />
speech. That is my view.<br />
Mr. MENZIES. The Attorney-<br />
General, then sitting as a justice of the<br />
High Court, made the view of himself and<br />
of his brother, Mr. Justice McTiernan,<br />
abundantly clear. I have read and reread<br />
that case and I still believe that it<br />
was the prevailing view in that case. It<br />
is true Mr. Justice Dixon had an entirely<br />
different view, but the one I have quoted<br />
was the prevailing view, and it means<br />
that the external affairs power is something<br />
infinitely more far-reaching than<br />
99n people out of 100 thought, at any<br />
rate, in 1901. It was a splendid example<br />
of the way in which great constitutional<br />
changes sometimes occur without any<br />
change in the language of the Constitution<br />
at all. I do not want to elaborate<br />
that point, because I am sure that honorable<br />
members will see how far-reaching<br />
an authority that is. One has only t,,<br />
think of the Atlantic Charter and the </p>
<p>lend-lease agreements, with all their<br />
economic implications, to see how far a<br />
power of that kind can run.<br />
The next power is the aoquisition ol<br />
property on just terms from any State or<br />
person for any purpose in respect of<br />
which the Parliament has power to make<br />
laws That power to acquire pro.<br />
perty is far-reaching. 1 refer to it<br />
because several honorable members on<br />
this side of the House have been a little<br />
concerned to know whether the repatriation<br />
power would extend to the resumption<br />
of estates, the acquisition of Crown lands<br />
and the establishment of soldiers on such<br />
lands. Quite plainly it does, because of<br />
the repatriation power belonging to the<br />
ommonwealth under the defence power.<br />
So the power to acouire property on just<br />
terms " from any State or person "-it<br />
includes Crown lands-is quite effective<br />
so lon, as it is being acquired for a<br />
valid Commonwealth purpose. In this<br />
astance the valid Commonwealth purpose<br />
i: the repatriation of returned soldiers.<br />
It is true-I meet this point occasionally<br />
-that after the last war soldier settlement<br />
was conducted by State governments<br />
and State Parliaments.<br />
Sir EARLE PAGE.-That was by agreement.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-The reason for that<br />
is twofold. In the first place, it was dtone<br />
by agreement very largely as a matter of<br />
convenience, as the States had the Lands<br />
Departments and Departments of Agriplture<br />
and all the local machinery for<br />
dealing with such matters. ' In the second<br />
place, as the right honorable member for<br />
Cowper ( Sir Earle Page) will be disposed<br />
to agree, it had not at that time<br />
been quite fully appreciated that section<br />
6, containing the power to make grants<br />
to the States, was so far-reaching as it<br />
turned out to be.<br />
Sir EARLE PAGE.-But the Commonwealth<br />
power was not disputed at that<br />
time. Mr. MENZIES.-I do not think that<br />
it has ever been disputed. Then there<br />
is a power in these terms: The acquisition,<br />
with the consent of a State of any<br />
railways of the State on terms arranged<br />
between the Commonwealth and the<br />
State". The Commonwealth has always<br />
hi,' a pcw'r in toe ter'Cns to acluire the<br />
railways of the States. If the Comnn: nwealth were to exercise that power, it<br />
could standardize the railway gauges.<br />
There would be no difficulty about that,<br />
because the railways would belong to the<br />
Commonwealth, which could do as it chose<br />
about the standardization of railway<br />
gauges. I point that out, because one ot<br />
the powers that are now being sought<br />
appears to relate to the uniformity of<br />
railway gauges, and it has puzzled me not<br />
a little, having regard to . the terms now<br />
to be found in the Constitution.<br />
Mr. CURTIN.-Suppose the Government<br />
of Victoria refused to enter into an agreement<br />
with the Commonwealth Government<br />
for the-transfer of its railways?<br />
[ ir. MENZIES.-Then the Commonwealth<br />
could not assume control of theni.<br />
Mr. CuRTIN.-But the Commonwealth<br />
might desire to standardize the railway<br />
gauges. Mr. lMENZIES.-I the Common<br />
wealth Government proposed to acquire<br />
the railways of a State independent of<br />
the consent of the State, what the Prime<br />
Minister states would be all right. I<br />
would not quarrel about that. If the<br />
Commonwealth desires to take over the<br />
railway systems of Australia, I have not<br />
the slightest objection.<br />
Dr. EVATT.-The Constitution does not<br />
permit that. Does the Leader of the<br />
Opposition mean that he would favour<br />
an alteration of the Constitution to grant<br />
to the Commonwealth that power?<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Apparently I misunderstood<br />
the Prime Minister. It is<br />
clear from what I read that the acquisition<br />
of the railways of a State is conditioned<br />
by the consent of the State.<br />
Mr. Cr. TIN.-Dc. es the right honorable<br />
gentleman contend that the Comr<br />
uonwealth could standardize railway<br />
gauges at the present time without an<br />
amendment of the Constitution?<br />
Mr. MENZTES.-What I said was<br />
that if the Commonwealth were to exercise<br />
its power to acquire the railways of<br />
a State. it could do what it liked with<br />
the railways.<br />
Mr. CuRTIN.-The Commonwealth will<br />
not be able to standardize railway gauges<br />
unless it orsumc. 9 control of the railways.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-I hope that that is<br />
a formal pdl'mision. It w: il solve on::<br />
of nny pro. lelirs. </p>
<p>Mr. CURTIN.-The right honorable<br />
gentleman said that.<br />
Mr. ARCHIE CAMERON.-The Prime<br />
Minister declared that coal could be<br />
mined without the Commonwealth Government<br />
taking control of the mines.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-There is no occasion<br />
for us to be at cross purposes on this<br />
issue. The existing power enables the<br />
Commonwealth to acquire the railways of<br />
a State with the consent of the State. If<br />
the State refuses its consent, the Commonwealth<br />
cannot acquire the railways.<br />
Therefore, if the Commonwealth Government<br />
desires to standardize railway<br />
gauges, I agree that it will need some<br />
kind of power. The ' Commonwealth<br />
Government could achieve its objective<br />
either by taking over the railways with<br />
the consent of the States, or by offering<br />
to meet the cost of standardizing the<br />
gauges, and dealing with the States under<br />
section 96. I shall come to that point in<br />
a moment. What I was concerned with<br />
was to draw attention to the power, with<br />
all its limitations, which now exists in<br />
relation to State railways.<br />
The last power to which I desire to<br />
refer is the appropriation power. Section<br />
81 sets up a consolidated fund for<br />
the Commonwealth out of which there<br />
may be appropriated moneys " for the<br />
purposes of Ehe Commonwealth As the<br />
Attorney-General knows, there has ' been<br />
a discussion for a very long time as to<br />
whether the Commonwealth can appropriate<br />
money for purposes which are not<br />
otherwise within its legislative powers.<br />
The argument, by practice, has resolved<br />
in favour of the Commonwealth, because<br />
the Commonwealth has in the past appropriated<br />
moneys for matters not otherwise<br />
within the legislative power. For<br />
example, it is difficult to discover where<br />
the Commonwealth derives authority for<br />
the Maternity Allowances Act, unless it<br />
br. under the appropriation power.<br />
Mr. SPENDER.-It has never been<br />
challenged. Mr. MENZIES.-I know that! Of<br />
course, it has never been challenged!<br />
What I am asking is: Where is the power<br />
t, legislate for maternity allowances<br />
unless it is in the appropriation power,<br />
because it is not in any one of the other<br />
provisions of the Constitution? We<br />
have created in this country certain government-controlled or ultimately<br />
government-controlled corporations, such<br />
as Commonwealth Oil Refineries and<br />
Amalgamated Wireless ( Australasia)<br />
Limited. These have been great experiments<br />
in partial governmental control,<br />
but they have been done under the appropriation<br />
power. When the Royal Commission<br />
on the Commonwealth Constitution<br />
sat sixteen years ago, it heard a lot<br />
of evidence of the most learned kind from<br />
authorities on the ' question of whether<br />
the Commonwealth could appropriate<br />
moneys for purposes for which it had<br />
never been given specific legislative<br />
authority. If honorable members are interested<br />
to see an excellent summary, of<br />
the various views on that matter, they<br />
will find it in the report of the royal<br />
commission in a chapter beginning on<br />
page 137. It is of interest to note that<br />
Sir Robert Garran, who gave evidence<br />
before the royal commission on that subject<br />
and who could speak with the most<br />
far-reaching experience of the Constitution<br />
not only in theory but also in practice,<br />
adhered strongly to the view that<br />
the appropriation power was unlimited<br />
and that the Commonwealth could appropriate<br />
funds for any purposes that it<br />
thought fit, and not just for some purposes<br />
in respect of which it could make a<br />
law. He also indicated in the course of<br />
his evidence that that view had been<br />
acted upon consistently by the Commonwealth.<br />
It has been acted upon consistently<br />
in the United States of America, I<br />
think, but I have not said anything about<br />
that aspect because there is a slight difference<br />
in the language of the two Constitutions<br />
on that matter and I do not<br />
consider that any great argument can be<br />
built up on the American practice.<br />
I pause here at the end of this fair<br />
and objective statement on existing<br />
powers to say this. It is a misuse of language<br />
to say that a government and a<br />
parliament possessing such far-reaching<br />
authorities as those which I have been<br />
describing and in a position to impose<br />
its will upon State governments through<br />
its financial power, is in any real sense<br />
bereft of power to deal with the immediate<br />
post-war problems. This does not<br />
mean that some further power may not<br />
be desirable. I have been discussing, so<br />
far, whether the Commonwealth is so </p>
<p>powerless to deal with the post-war<br />
period as we have been given to understand<br />
it is. The answer to that question,<br />
in my view, must be No<br />
Before turning to a consideration of<br />
the provisions which the Government<br />
desires to have written into the Constitution,<br />
I shall say a few words about<br />
ai argument which has great currency<br />
in Australia and which, it is alleged,<br />
will have a close bearing on the fate<br />
of the referendum. The argument is<br />
that the last depression in Australia<br />
was somehow caused, or permitted, or<br />
was inadequately dealt with, because of<br />
divided constitutional powers in this<br />
: ict country. If the people are told that our<br />
., Constitution had anything to do with<br />
the last depression, and if they believe it,<br />
they will be misled, for the Constitution<br />
had nothing to do with it. Is it to be<br />
forgotten, -either inside or outside this<br />
zr House, that the depression came to the<br />
iniworld with equal severity in unitary<br />
countries, such as Great Britain and New<br />
Zealand; in federal countries with a very<br />
strong central power, such as Canada;<br />
and in federal countries with somewhat<br />
more divided authority, such as the<br />
United States of America and Australia?<br />
The depression came to countries of all<br />
forms of government, and when we talk<br />
about it and consider what we must do to<br />
avoid another depression, do not let us<br />
forget that Australia . began to emerge<br />
from the last depression probalbly earlier<br />
" n: than any other country in the world.<br />
That fact is well recognized outside of<br />
Australia, and I believe it is recognized<br />
in this country by all except a very few<br />
people. Tllis bill sets out fourteen powers<br />
VS-presumnahly, to be regarded as new<br />
powers-w-hich, it is said, should be<br />
written into the Constitution by way of<br />
additions to existing authority which<br />
this Government niust have in order to<br />
deal with post-war problems. I point<br />
out to the House that, except for unavoidable<br />
verbal alterations, this bill is<br />
similar to the Commonwealth Powers<br />
Bill which issued from the Canbcrrn<br />
Convention of November and Deccember.<br />
1942. That bill, as honorable members<br />
vill recollect, was prepared for submission<br />
to State Parliaments by State<br />
Premiers, and was to be recommended to the Parliaments by them. As we<br />
know, two State Parliaments passed the<br />
bill without amendment; two others<br />
passed it. with amendments; one passed<br />
it with a reservation as to action by<br />
other State Parliaments, and one-the<br />
Parliament of the smallest State in the<br />
federation-rejected it, though the rejection<br />
was by only one House of the<br />
Parliament. That bill was drafted by<br />
expert advisers, who, I say with great<br />
respect, sided with the Commonwealth.<br />
The State Premiers did not have expert<br />
advisers Dr. EVATT.-Oh, yes they did.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Not on the drafting<br />
committee. The Premiers had their<br />
experts to whom they could rush during<br />
a dinner adjournment, or whom they<br />
could meet in the corridors.<br />
Dr. EVATT.-They had their advisers<br />
in Canberra, just as we had ours.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-I am afraid the<br />
Attorney-General is underestimating the<br />
strength of his own experts on this committee.<br />
The right honorable gentleman<br />
was himself the chairman of the committee,<br />
and he had the Commonwealth<br />
Solicitor-General, Sir George Knowles,<br />
as the secretary of it. I sympathize<br />
with the lay Premiers because of the<br />
position in which they found themselves<br />
on that occasion. In this job of draftsmanship<br />
they were confronted by a most<br />
powerful phalanx of experts representing<br />
the Commonwealth. It is a mistake,<br />
also, to believe that this bill was, in<br />
any sense, fully discussed by the convention,<br />
as a convention. The report<br />
of the discussion of these fourteen<br />
powers-and they were discussed in toto<br />
-occupies only twelve pages of the<br />
published book. ' With great respect to<br />
all concerned, I say that it would be<br />
impossible adequately to discuss fourteen<br />
powers of the kind set out in this bill,<br />
and to arrive at definite conclusions,<br />
within the compass of. twelve pages of<br />
Tan sard.<br />
Mr. CURTIN.-The drafting committee<br />
occupied several days in its discussions,<br />
and the report of those discussions is<br />
not included in the book.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-I have said all I<br />
want to say about the defective nature<br />
of this committee, having in mind the </p>
<p>need for a balanced result. Every provision<br />
in this bill deserves the most<br />
anxious consideration. I have made these<br />
remarks about the convention because I<br />
believe that every citizen owes a duty<br />
to himself and to his country to consider<br />
these matters without prejudice, and<br />
without feeling that he is estopped from<br />
discussing them. There should be the.<br />
most careful scrutiny of this measure.<br />
also, because, although a five-year period<br />
is stipulated, there cnii be no doubt that<br />
if the amendments be adopted the next<br />
constitutional amendment to be submitted<br />
to this Parliament will be designed to<br />
remove the time limit.<br />
It is a very great misfortune that these<br />
fourteen powers have been included<br />
within the compass of one bill. By<br />
including them in one bill the Government<br />
has said to the people, " If there<br />
is one of these fourteen powers which<br />
you don't like, and you reject it, you<br />
reject the lot The Government may<br />
have had its reasons for adopting this<br />
course, and I can speculate about them.<br />
Dr. EVATT.-The reason is that the<br />
powers are all a part of the one nareement.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-We have long passed<br />
the point of any agreement. The<br />
Attorney-General appears to be h:: gridden<br />
with the idea that there is an<br />
agreement with the Premiers. On their<br />
own showing it must be assumed that<br />
the agreement has been torn up. There<br />
can be no earthly point in the Attorney-<br />
General insisting, in this Parliament<br />
or anywhere else, that an agreement<br />
exists. If the Government desires tr<br />
concentrate the opposition to cons; itiitienal<br />
change in this country it can<br />
hardly do it more effectively than by<br />
wrapping up all the proposals in c; i'<br />
parcel and saying, " You take the lot.<br />
or you leave the lot". However, that<br />
is its risk, and I imagine will turn out.<br />
to be its funeral.<br />
I have said all I want to say about<br />
repatriation powers. No one in this<br />
Parliament, or in any State Parliament,<br />
will quarrel about the Commonwealth<br />
having power in the terms of paragraph<br />
to which I have referred; but<br />
neither wiil any one s. crio;~ ly di;-;: iu<br />
that the Corimcnv.-wulth alrc.'. y ha tIhni power. For that reason, I say that this<br />
clause is window-dressing and is designed<br />
to attract the votes of hundreds of thousands<br />
of people who may be led to believe<br />
that a N vote will mean that the<br />
Commonwealth will have no power to<br />
deal with repatriation. That is most<br />
misleading, because I say deliberately,<br />
and I sl:: l! repeat it whenever the<br />
occasion may so require, that the I,: ver<br />
contained in pragraphl i; a power<br />
which this Government has, and which<br />
any Government would have. It is a<br />
pov-. wer which, in fact, as everybody ill<br />
recall, was freely and beneficently exercised<br />
for a score of years between the two<br />
wars by governments and the repatriation<br />
departments.<br />
The next new power is that which relates<br />
to " employment and unemployment".<br />
That phrase, in my opinion, is highly<br />
ambiguous and unscientific, for the r. ason<br />
that employment and unemploymnut<br />
are results, not causes, and are not subject-<br />
matters of legislation in the true<br />
sense, any more than an external symptom<br />
would be a subject-matter of med'ical<br />
tratment. What an absurdity it would<br />
be to say to a doctor, " You may treat<br />
this patient for some skin infection, but<br />
. ou are not to go behind that and finm<br />
out what it is inside the patient which is<br />
causing the skin infection". The term. s<br />
" employment and unemployment have<br />
been chosen, no doubt, because of themselves;<br />
they are undefinable; they are<br />
without definition; they are without<br />
limit. But they have been chosen, and<br />
very adroitly, because the draftsman<br />
lnew that nobody could possibly construe<br />
these powers except by saying,<br />
The Parliament is to have the<br />
power to deal with all the causes of<br />
employment and unemployment". The<br />
result of the exercise by the Commonwealth<br />
of the power over trade and commerce,<br />
over banking, over insurance, over<br />
what you will, may be to produce employment<br />
or unemployment. What I emphasize<br />
in the first instance is, that this is<br />
a statement in terms of results, not in<br />
Srms of causes. Therefore, what power<br />
is it that is being given to the Commonwealth<br />
by this phrase? The Attorney-<br />
General land the Prime Minister smile.<br />
' iTh-, I. li. idL r that thi: dEo es not matter<br />
very The Attoruey-C'ncral inade </p>
<p>no atenipt at the convention to set any<br />
limits to this power. He knows that he<br />
cannot set any limits to it.<br />
Dr. EVATT.-It is the widest power in<br />
the bill.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Of course it is; the<br />
most far-reaching power in the bill.<br />
Dr. EvaTT.-It is the power for this<br />
Parliament to provide employment and<br />
prevent unemployment. It is so simple<br />
that everybody understands it.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-The right honorable<br />
gentleman knows that that is mere<br />
rhetoric; it does not define a subjectmatter<br />
of legislation.<br />
Dr. EVATT.-Th1 object is to enable this<br />
Parliament to secure employment for the<br />
people, which the Commonwealth cannot<br />
do to-day.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-The attempts to<br />
define this power are very illuminating.<br />
I adopt the statement of the right honorable<br />
gentleman, namely, that it is the<br />
most far-reaching power in the bill. That<br />
P. o i' what I am concerned to establishthat<br />
this will enable the Parliament to<br />
dc.' al with every economic factor which,<br />
by a chain of causation, may result in<br />
employment or unemployment. I wait<br />
for thai statment to be challenged.<br />
Having done so, I proceed to say that, if<br />
the Commonwealth receives at the hands<br />
of the Australian people this power in<br />
these terms, then there will be no aspect<br />
of the economic life of Australia which<br />
will stand outside the control of the Commonwealth.<br />
That will not be denied. It<br />
1,, 1is all very well to attach a label, to say:<br />
" The man down the street knows about<br />
employment and unemployment". Of<br />
course he does. The man down the street<br />
is thinking, as he has the right to do,<br />
about unemployment as it affects him.<br />
But we in this place have to consider<br />
unemployment as a source of legislative<br />
power. We have a real responsibility in<br />
this ma tter, and when we write words<br />
into the Constitution we ought, at all<br />
events, to have some vague idea as to<br />
what we are doing with the Constitution.<br />
That lower, at one blow, will effect unification<br />
by concentrating power in the<br />
central government of Australia.<br />
Mr. BRENNAN.-The right honorable<br />
gentleman fills me with new hope.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Oddly enough, I did<br />
not think that the prospect would distress my friend from Batman; not at<br />
all. He is a unificationist. If he were<br />
seeking to amend the Constitution, he<br />
would simply say, " Cut out all these<br />
limitations in section 51, and give the<br />
Commonwealth all the power".<br />
Mr. SCULLIN.-Did not the right honorable<br />
gentleman say that he supported<br />
the African system?<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Yes; I am very keen<br />
on the African system. When a convention<br />
is held in this country to discuss<br />
permanent changes in the Constitution,<br />
1 shall elaborate my opinions with not<br />
the slightest hesitation. But I am now<br />
discussing a bill that is designed to give<br />
powers for five years, and to whom? I<br />
leave it to my friends opposite to say.<br />
The power, of course, is put forward in<br />
the belief that employment and unemployment<br />
can be created by governments.<br />
Indeed, honorable members opposite<br />
believe that all that a government has<br />
to do is to turn the handle of the<br />
monetary machine, or something of the<br />
kind, and employment will result.<br />
Mr. Por. LLAD.-That is a false statement.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-What they are leaving<br />
out of account is that employment<br />
and social security in Australia will<br />
in reality depend primarily upon a<br />
revival of enterprise and of business.<br />
There cannot be real security and employon<br />
a basis merely of government<br />
works; we must look forward to a revival<br />
of business and enterprise at the earliest<br />
possible moment. In that respect, unlike<br />
the chattering Minister for Information,<br />
I happen to believe, as I know<br />
he does not, that the driving force will<br />
b. the man of business, and not the<br />
learned clerk in the reconstruction department.<br />
The next power, which is, after all,<br />
a small one compared with ( ii)<br />
is " organized marketing of commodities<br />
There is a very strong case,<br />
as we on this side of Parliament<br />
thought, and as those on the other side<br />
did not think a few years ago, for the<br />
organized marketing of primary commodities<br />
of which there is an exportable<br />
surplus. For many years, that has been<br />
an acute and difficult problem, but the<br />
power sought by the Government relates<br />
to commodities generally. No doubt that </p>
<p>will be spoken of loudly in the country<br />
electorates, and whispered down in<br />
the metropolitan electorates, except, of<br />
course, in a selected few. The power<br />
relates to all commodities and, oddly<br />
enough, it will still be subject to section<br />
92 of the Constitution. This very power,<br />
which was impaired by one thing only,<br />
section 92, in the period between the<br />
two wars, is still to be impaired by tli<br />
same section because, apparently, that<br />
section is an awkward thing to deal<br />
with when considering amendments t,<br />
the Constitution.<br />
The next power is " companies, but<br />
so that any such law shall be uniform<br />
throughout the Commonwealth". There<br />
is very great merit in the proposal for<br />
a uniform companies act. It has beei<br />
supported for many years by a good<br />
many people in Australia. A uniform<br />
companies act, if it followed the usual<br />
model, would deal with such matters as<br />
the formation of companies, the prospectuses<br />
they issued, the constitution of<br />
companies, and the winding up of companies-<br />
all those matters which arc<br />
ordinarily covered in the companies ac::<br />
of the States. We shall be told that<br />
this power is designed to facilitate the<br />
passing of such an act by the Commonwealth,<br />
but that statement is absurd on<br />
the face of it. Is it seriously proposed<br />
to pass a uniform companies act for<br />
five years only? Why, that would create<br />
chaos in the business world. It would<br />
be absurd to pass a Commonwealth a:.<br />
setting up a registry, and providing for<br />
the appointment of officers to deal with<br />
applications for registration, and then<br />
allow the whole thing to lapse in five<br />
years' time. It is against reason to<br />
suplose that this power was designed<br />
just to produce a uniform companies<br />
act, and so we had better go back to<br />
the power itself, and when we do we<br />
see that the subject-matter of the power<br />
is simply " companies In other words,<br />
the Commonwealth may pass any law<br />
it chooses in relation to companies, lo<br />
their activities, their boards of directors,<br />
their profits, the wages they pay, in fact,<br />
anything you like.<br />
Mr. CALWELL.-And in relation<br />
their undisclosed profits.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Yes, their undisclosed<br />
profits. Mr. CALWELL.-That is what the<br />
Leader of the Opposition is afraid of.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-The honorable member<br />
need not fear that he will ever have<br />
any undisclosed profits to be affected.<br />
Mr. CALwELL.-Anything which 1<br />
have was got by honest work.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Anything which the<br />
Minister for Information has is in the<br />
shop window, and a not very imposing<br />
display it makes. I could go on speaking<br />
of the kind of . laws which could be<br />
passed under this power until I made<br />
the mouth of the Attorney-General water,<br />
but if it is right for the Commonwealth<br />
to have such powers in relation to companies,<br />
why should it not have similar<br />
power in relation to partnerships? Why<br />
should the Commonwealth pass laws controlling<br />
the activities of companies, while<br />
leaving competing interests under the<br />
control of the . States? I am forced to<br />
the conclusion that this power was put<br />
in as a sop to those who want a uniform<br />
companies act, and that it was done in<br />
the expectation that those persons would<br />
not realize that the whole thing would<br />
come to an end in five years' time.<br />
I mention the next proposal with some<br />
diffidence in the presence of the Deputy<br />
Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hughes),<br />
because it relates to ". trusts, combines<br />
and monopolies against which the right<br />
honorable member couched a lance when<br />
this Parliament first came into existence.<br />
I wish that the Attorney-General would<br />
find himself able at some time to tel1<br />
us what the expression used in the bill<br />
means. Dr. EVATT.-Does not the right honorable<br />
member know?<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-I do not know, and,<br />
with great respect, I venture to say<br />
that the Attorney-General does not know,<br />
either. Dr. EVATT.-I do know, and so does<br />
the right honorable member.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Then the Attorney-<br />
General had better put it in the bill.<br />
I suppose a monopoly is an undertaking<br />
which has sole rights to manufacture<br />
or produce' or deal in certain commodities.<br />
This is one of the expressions that<br />
sound magnificent from a political platform,<br />
when the candidate is able to say,<br />
" You give us the power and we will<br />
smash the combines". But what are </p>
<p>the combines? The candidate will say,<br />
" You give us the authority and we<br />
will clean up the trusts When I was<br />
listening to the brains trust" the other<br />
day-I suppose they will come under this<br />
power now-I heard one of its more<br />
distinguished members use a new and<br />
horrible word, " trustification". Of<br />
course, we know what the American<br />
anti-trust laws are, and they are an<br />
indication of what the American legislature<br />
regarded as trusts. We know that<br />
there may be certain combinations in<br />
restraint of trade which ought to Ib<br />
dealt with. There is a ' Commonwealth<br />
act in regard ' to these matters, but I<br />
have not heard that this Government<br />
has invoked it.<br />
Dr. EVATT.-The right honorable<br />
member knows that the act has been<br />
declared by the High Court to be inapplicable<br />
to domestic trade.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-I shall leave it to<br />
the Attorney-General to tell us in his<br />
reply what trusts, combines, and monopolies<br />
are. If he wants power to deal<br />
with combinations in restraint of trade<br />
I shall help him all I can.<br />
Dr. EVATT.-That is a matter for<br />
Parliament to determine.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Perhaps the Attorney-<br />
General will open up on this subject<br />
at some convenient time. The next<br />
power is in relation to profiteering<br />
and prices For some period after<br />
the war prices must, unquestionl<br />
ably, remain subject to control. To<br />
remove control suddenly would be to<br />
produce hopeless confusion. I am not<br />
concerned to advocate the removal of<br />
all control as soon as fighting ceases. I<br />
believe that many departmental activities<br />
will continue for some time after the<br />
war. I believe -that we must convert<br />
the nation from a war to a peace footing<br />
with infinite care, and with as much skill<br />
as possible. The prices power allied<br />
with the profiteering power is very important.<br />
Prices, yes; but profiteering,<br />
as I said before, is one of those topics<br />
which is just as big or as little as<br />
Parliament cares to make it. To the man<br />
in the street, profiteering means the extorting<br />
of an unreasonable profit, but if<br />
the Commonwealth chooses to make a<br />
law of general application that no profit<br />
shall exceed 2 per cent., will the High Court declare such a law . to be invalid?<br />
The Court will say, We do not. know<br />
what constitutes an undue profit. It is<br />
for Parliament to determine that, and<br />
Parliament has power to restrict profits<br />
to any figure it likes<br />
Mr. SPENDER.-The right honorable<br />
gentleman does not object to power in<br />
respect of prices, but he objects to power<br />
in respect of profiteering because it is<br />
meaningless? Mr. MENZIES.-I object to power<br />
over profiteering because it is meaningless.<br />
I said that prices must continue to<br />
be controlled for some period after the<br />
war. Whether control over prices<br />
requires extra power or not depends on<br />
what I said about the extent of the wartime<br />
powers that the Government<br />
possesses. If we turn to ( vii) we come to the<br />
power which, together with employment<br />
and unemployment, really confers upon<br />
the Commonwealth' full authority to deal<br />
with everything, because it is power to<br />
deal with " the production and distribution<br />
of goods There are two provisos<br />
that-No law made under this paragraph<br />
with respect to prifnary production<br />
shall have effect in a State until<br />
approved by the Governor in Council<br />
of that State; and<br />
no law made under this paragraph<br />
shall discriminate between States or<br />
parts of States.<br />
The second proviso does not matter very<br />
much for this purpose, but the first seems<br />
to me to be entirely unnecessary. I do<br />
not know why, once the Commonwealth<br />
has power to make a law, its exercise of<br />
that power should be conditioned by the<br />
consent of the Government for the time<br />
being of a State. I . think that is an<br />
undue limit on any reasonable Commonwealth<br />
power. But the power itself is to<br />
deal with the production and distribution<br />
of goods. If the people grant to the Commonwealth<br />
power to deal with employment<br />
and unemployment and production<br />
and distribution of goods, all limitations<br />
of substance will have been removed<br />
from the ' Commonwealth's legislative<br />
authority. In fact, it would hardly need<br />
any of the other powers to be found in<br />
the bill. Those two are completely farreaching,<br />
they are completely without<br />
limit. </p>
<p>Mr. CALWELL.-And are very necessary.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-The honorable inmber<br />
thinks so, but he ne, d not keep<br />
reminding me that that is his belief. The<br />
power to deal with production and dis<br />
tribution of goods is as extensive, I<br />
venture to think, as the complle-e grant<br />
of trade and commerce power to the<br />
Commonwealth. Of course---and this is<br />
the milk in the coco-nut-it would<br />
ensble the Commonwealth t-nationalize<br />
indusu ies.<br />
Mr. CAL. WELL.--The same old bogy.<br />
Mr. ANTHONY.-It is the policy of<br />
the Labour party to control produtr. ion,<br />
distribution and exchange.<br />
Mr, MENZIES. The honorable<br />
gentleman is right-production and distribution<br />
in this, and exchang: in another.<br />
The point about this proposal is that if<br />
we can get power for five years to make<br />
laws in respect of production and distribution<br />
of goods, with 1no interstate<br />
limitations or restrictions of that kind,<br />
we shall be able to carry out,<br />
rot a bogy, but the declared policy<br />
of the honorable member for Melbourne<br />
( Mr. Calwell) ald his colleagues,<br />
this wonderful Jekyll-and-Hyde<br />
Government. Honorable members know<br />
that the Minister for Munitions ( Mr.<br />
Makin), with characteristic frankness and<br />
candour, says to the people, We must<br />
lave these powers because I want to be<br />
able to carry on civil production in thest<br />
munitions factories when the war is<br />
over He tells us that. He is quite<br />
honest about it. That is what I want<br />
to do he says. " I want to be able to<br />
go into competition with other people in<br />
niinufacturing goods of that kind when<br />
the war is over."<br />
Mr. FADDEN.-The Minister for War<br />
Organization of Industry ( Mr. Dedman)<br />
has always said that.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Yes, 1 am sure that<br />
the Minister for War Organization of<br />
Industry concurs in that view. At the<br />
moment I direct attention to the fact<br />
that this is the power under which tha,.<br />
is to be done; what happens? A strange<br />
silence falls over those who have been<br />
advocating socialization, and the more<br />
irresponsible members of the Cabinet<br />
say, Bogy! bogy! bogy! They can<br />
keep on saying " Bogy!" but the simple fact is-and the honorable member for<br />
Melbourne will not deny it-that this<br />
power is designed, amongst other things,<br />
to enable the Government to carry on<br />
business in these war-time factories when<br />
the war is over.<br />
Mr. CALWELL.-In order to prepare<br />
against the next war.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-I accept the honorable<br />
gentleman's answer. In order to<br />
prepare against the next war, munition<br />
factories are to be used to manufacture<br />
farm implements in competition with the<br />
established farm implement manufacturers.<br />
The next power on the list is the control<br />
of overseas exchange and overseas<br />
investment but overseas exchange and,<br />
overseas investment, as I should have<br />
thought anybody would agree, are already<br />
within the Commonwealth's power. t<br />
have never understood that to be<br />
challenged. " The regulation of the raising<br />
of money "-meaning by that borrowings<br />
by the Government and, to some<br />
extent, under the gentleman's agreement,<br />
scmi-governmental bodies-is already<br />
controlled by the Loan Council. So this<br />
power must refer to the control of private<br />
borrowing. All right. There will need<br />
to be some control over investment when<br />
the war is over. I am not quarrelling<br />
with that. But it is well that it should<br />
be understood that this power, which is<br />
so pleasantly wrapped up in power to<br />
control governmental activities, is not<br />
designed to deal with that at all.<br />
Then there is air transport I need<br />
i: ot occupy any time over that. Air transport<br />
should be taken over by the Commonwealth<br />
on a permanent footing. It<br />
may very well be that the addition of.<br />
the words " regulation of" may be'<br />
desirable for various reasons, but<br />
that is a minor matter. The fact is that<br />
air transport is, as many of us have long<br />
agreed, a matter over which the Commonwealth<br />
should have control.<br />
Mr. SPENDER.-The addition of those<br />
words would make a difference.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Undoubtedly. The.<br />
tenth power is " uniformity of railway<br />
gauges and, as I was beginning to say<br />
a little earlier, that power is extremely<br />
puzzling to me. If the ' Commonwealth<br />
Government proposes to take over<br />
the State railways, it obviously does not </p>
<p>need a special power to alter gauges. If<br />
it does not propose to take over State<br />
railways, I do not suppose that, with any<br />
decency, it could ask for or require gauge<br />
conversion, unless it paid the cost. I<br />
could hardly imagine, for example, that<br />
the Commonwealth Government, having<br />
investigated uniform railway gauges,<br />
could say to my State of Victoria, You<br />
must convert your tracks to the 4-ft.<br />
S8-in. gauge at your own expense",<br />
because that would involve the State of<br />
Victoria in the expenditure of, say,<br />
œ 10,000,000. That would be, I should<br />
think, an under-estimate, and there<br />
would be no corresponding advantage to<br />
" rictoria. Mr. ABBOTT.-It would involve a<br />
complete rebuilding of the Queensland<br />
railways system.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-The honorable memher<br />
would agree, and I am sure every<br />
inister would agree, that you could not<br />
possibly say to a State, You must convert<br />
your track to a certain gauge and<br />
pay the cost".<br />
Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p. m.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-If the Commonwealth<br />
Government proposes to take over<br />
the State railway systems, it will not<br />
need any special power to authorize it<br />
to make the gauges uniform. But if<br />
the Commonwealth Government does not<br />
propose to take over the State railways,<br />
in, in my view, it could not demand a<br />
Aversion of the gauges unless it paid<br />
the cost. The point, then, is that under<br />
section 96 the Commonwealth already<br />
has power to do that. It could say to<br />
any State under section 96, We shall<br />
vance you the money for converting<br />
, e railway gauges in your State if you<br />
will undertake to do the work in accordance<br />
with the report and scheme that<br />
we have prepared So that the power,<br />
as a special head of power in this hill.<br />
is a little puzzling to me.<br />
The next power is one to carry out<br />
national works, with this addendum--<br />
ibut so that, before any such work is under.<br />
taken in a State, the consent of the Governor<br />
in Council of that State shall be obtained and<br />
that any such work so undertaken shall<br />
be carried out in co-operation with the State.<br />
Once more, I confess to finding that<br />
very puzzling as it stands, because if<br />
2155.-2 the Commonwealth can carry out a public<br />
work only with the consent of the<br />
Government of the State concerned, why<br />
can it not do that at the present time<br />
under section 96 of the Constitution?<br />
I believe that the Commonwealth ought<br />
to have power to cairy out national<br />
works. We may need, indeed we probably<br />
shall need, some great national works,<br />
particularly in the immediate post-war<br />
years. Therefore, what surprises me is<br />
that instead of asking for the power, if<br />
it be needed to carry out national works<br />
in the discretion of the Commonwsalth.<br />
the Government should seek a power<br />
which is unduly confined by its reference<br />
to the consent of some State administration.<br />
If we are to have power to deal<br />
with national works, it ought to be an<br />
unqualified power.<br />
What I have just said is also true of<br />
the power sought regarding " national<br />
health, in co-operation with the States<br />
or any of them". If national health is<br />
a fit subject for national treatment, it<br />
ought to be within the power of the<br />
Commonwealth without this qualification<br />
that is attached to it relating to the<br />
States. Each of those two powers, of<br />
course, is in a sense related to the power<br />
of appropriation. I desire to say one<br />
more word about the power of appropriation,<br />
because I find that in at least one<br />
or two places some misapprehension<br />
exists regarding what I said earlier in<br />
my speech. I have not said that it is<br />
clear that the Commonwealth's power<br />
of appropriation is unlimited.<br />
Mr. SPENDER.-I thought that the<br />
Leader of the Opposition said that Sir<br />
Robert Garran made that statement.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-I did. Sir Robrn.<br />
Garran expressed that view when giving<br />
evidence before the royal commission.<br />
Dr. EVATT.-The Leader of the Opposition<br />
merely stated that the Commonwealth<br />
had acted often upon the assuimption<br />
that that power existed, but he<br />
knows quite well that the courts have<br />
left the matter open.<br />
Mr. MENZTES.--That is the only<br />
reason why I referred to it. This matter<br />
last came before the courts in the<br />
clothing factory case.<br />
M'r. SPENDER.-In 1935. </p>
<p>Mr. MENZIES.-The view was expressed<br />
by two judges that the appropriation<br />
power was limited to the existing<br />
heal of legislative or executive<br />
authority, but the majority of the court<br />
left the matter expressly open. Consequently,<br />
it cannot be said that this matter<br />
has been decided one way or the other.<br />
In the report of the royal commission,<br />
honorable members will find an admirable<br />
summary of the two contending<br />
views. My own opinion, for what it is<br />
woinh, and I do not put it forward<br />
dogmatically, has always been in favour<br />
of the view that the appropriation power<br />
is not unlimited; but the practice of<br />
the Commonwealth has been quite consistent,<br />
so far as it has been disclosed<br />
in action, in regarding -the power of<br />
appropriation as going beyond the heads<br />
of legislative power. That is the only<br />
point which I desire to make.<br />
Dr. EvAr.-If the position he allowea<br />
to remain as at present, the power may<br />
later be destroyed by a couirt decision.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-If that were the one<br />
power upon which we had to rely, I1<br />
would say unhesitatingly to the Attorney-<br />
General, Let us resolve all doubts<br />
because there are doubts in relation to<br />
that power. But I have plainly indicated<br />
' to the House that some matters<br />
here seem to be reasonably free of doubt.<br />
Others are plainly sublect to doubt. The<br />
limits of the defence power are always<br />
hazy, because at a certain point of time<br />
it is difficult indeed to say where the<br />
power will actually s9top. I have said<br />
that. But if honorable members will<br />
consider the cumulative effect of all the<br />
powers, they will find that a great body<br />
of power exists in the Commonwealthmuch<br />
greater than some of the protagonists<br />
admit.<br />
Mr. CURTI.-And changing its amplitude<br />
as the result of varying decisions<br />
which the High Court makes.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-4 cannot accept that.<br />
Dr. EVAr.-Not in those words.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Neither in those<br />
Wvords nor in substance. In point of<br />
fact, the High Court's decisions on the<br />
defence power have been extraordinarily<br />
consistent. Mr. CUETIN.-I should not think so. Mr. MENZIIES.-In the last war, the<br />
Commonwealth's defence power was consistently<br />
upheld.<br />
Dr. EvATT.-More so than it has been<br />
during this war.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-In this war, the<br />
High Court has certainly found in two<br />
or three cases that certain regulations<br />
were not related to the war. With great<br />
submission I should have thought that<br />
the court was plainly right. In other<br />
words the High Court has not abdicated<br />
its responsibility in this matter. The<br />
court has said, We must be satisfied<br />
that what is done in the name of the<br />
defence power has some specific relationship<br />
to the problem of winning the warand<br />
marshalling the nation<br />
Mr. CuitTIN.-Is not the Parliament<br />
the proper body to determine what is<br />
necessary to prosecute the war?<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-The answer to thatis<br />
" Certainly not Every honorable<br />
member knows that a comfortable<br />
majority in Parliament may decide-<br />
Mr. CONELAN.-There was not a comfortable<br />
majority in the last Parliament.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-I did not say that<br />
the honorable member was comfortable.<br />
He became uncomfortable shortly after<br />
the last election.<br />
We cannot dispose of constitutional<br />
limitations by saying that the Parliament<br />
has to be trusted. If that were<br />
the answer, we could tear up the Con-'<br />
stitution and forget about it. I say<br />
this to the Prime Minister, who perhaps<br />
has not had to wade through these cases<br />
so much as I have, that the High Court<br />
has time after time declared that these<br />
are matters in which the wisdom and',<br />
judgment of Parliament and the Executive<br />
it controls, are of paramount importance.<br />
Therefore, when in doubt,<br />
the court has always upheld the validity<br />
of laws made under the defence power,<br />
and has said quite consistently that only<br />
when, in its opinion, a regulation goes<br />
beyond that point will it declare such a<br />
regulation invalid. The court has done so<br />
in a few relatively trifling cases. We can<br />
say broadly that the defence power has<br />
proved itself the most flexible and most<br />
extensible power ever written into this<br />
or any other Constitution. </p>
<p>I suggest to the Attorney-General that<br />
the power relating to " family allowances<br />
is a little vague. If it is intended<br />
to provide for a validation of child endowment<br />
or something of that kind, perhaps<br />
it ought to be somewhat more specific.<br />
Most people will support the power<br />
relating to the people of aboriginal<br />
race though they will have some doubt<br />
as to whether it is in its nature a fiveyears<br />
power and not a permanent<br />
power. I say no more about it,<br />
because whether the proposal be<br />
for five years or permanently there can<br />
be no doubt that the welfare of the<br />
aboriginal races deserves far more attention<br />
in the future than we have ever<br />
riven to it in the past.<br />
Before I leave those topics, may I<br />
revert momentarily to the problem of<br />
health. I have said that health is a<br />
matter which lends itself to national<br />
treatment. When I say that, I do<br />
aope that everybody will be willing to<br />
attach this proviso, that its administration<br />
shall not become over-centralized<br />
and remote from the people. As I said<br />
earlier, the problem of over-centralized<br />
administration in Australia-there is a<br />
great deal of it and a bad tradition<br />
of it-is intimately associated with the<br />
problem of distribution of powers. There<br />
is more than an ounce of truth in Pope's<br />
old tag-<br />
For forms of government let fools contest.<br />
' What e'er is best administered is best.<br />
If the health of the people is a national<br />
matter, as it und-oubtedly is, the power<br />
should be unqualified.<br />
From what I have said it will appear<br />
to a great number of honorable members<br />
that the powers sought in this bill, whilst<br />
hey contain matters of merit, are in<br />
excess of the requirements of the period<br />
to which the bill relates. In addition to<br />
that, one should say that permanent<br />
alterations, and this bill does not seek<br />
to make permanent alteration, ought<br />
to be made in a proper atmosphere and<br />
after due deliberation. It would be a<br />
great pity, in fact it would be in some<br />
ways a tragedy, if a discussion in this<br />
House and in the country of temporary<br />
alterations were allowed to obscure and<br />
perhaps indefinitely to postpone a permanent<br />
revision of the Constitution.<br />
Therefore, we on this side of the House<br />
2165,-3 believe that as soon as possible after<br />
the war and after the people are able<br />
to devote their attention to this important<br />
and permanent problem, a popular<br />
convention ought to be summoned to<br />
make a thorough review of the whole<br />
of the structure and working of the<br />
Constitution. I am indebted to honorable members<br />
for their patience in listening to me.<br />
This is not a matter to be dealt with<br />
very shortly. The examination that I<br />
have made indicates that in my view, at<br />
least, certain of the powers, namely,<br />
repatriation, the control of overseas exchange,<br />
overseas investment and public<br />
borrowing, the standardization of railway<br />
gauges, and probably national works, to<br />
say nothing of one or two minor aspects,<br />
are already possessed by the Commonwealth.<br />
Other powers, such as those<br />
relating to rationing and the control of<br />
prices and investments-what we call the<br />
general set-up of war-time economic controls-<br />
are probably, and as I think<br />
certainly, possessed by the Commonwealth<br />
in the immediate post-war<br />
years under the defence power. But if<br />
there be any real doubt about those<br />
matters, the Opposition will support<br />
amendments designed reasonably to remove<br />
those doubts. Some of the other<br />
powers cannot be justified as powers for<br />
a limited and emergency purpose. Regarding<br />
the second and seventh proposed<br />
powers, there can be little doubt that<br />
their effect is immeasurably far more<br />
reaching than anybody contemplating<br />
the needs of the post-war years would<br />
desire. It is proper that I should draw attention<br />
to a statement that is being put<br />
forward by certain persons as authoritative<br />
on these matters, to the effect that<br />
the people of Queensland, for example,<br />
should not worry about this referendum,<br />
and might just as well vote affirmatively,<br />
because, forsooth, the Queensland Parliament<br />
has already referred the powers<br />
to the Commonwealth. That is a most<br />
disingenuous argument. It is true that<br />
the Queensland Parliament has referred<br />
powers for a number of years in the<br />
terms of this bill, and that the Commonwealth<br />
Parliament could exercise those<br />
powers in relation to Quensland if it<br />
chooses to make Commonwealth laws </p>
<p>which will operate in only one State. It<br />
is true, also, that the measure passed ' by<br />
the Queensland Parliament referring the<br />
powers to the Commonwealth may be<br />
repealed by the Queensland Parliament<br />
during the currency of the period, provided<br />
that the repeal be approved by the<br />
electors in accordance with the appropriate<br />
section. As I understand it, that<br />
means by referendum. The point must<br />
be recognized, however, that when the<br />
citizens of Queensland vote on a referendum<br />
to change the Commonwealth Constitution,<br />
their vote determines not<br />
merely the powers to he exercised in<br />
Queensland but also those to be exercised<br />
in other parts of Australia. I do not<br />
believe, nor do I consider that any other<br />
honorable member will believe, that the<br />
Commonwealth would exercise referred<br />
powers if the exercise were confined to<br />
two or three States. The Queensland<br />
Parliament has . passed the Commonwealth<br />
Powers Bill without reservation<br />
and so has the Parliament of New South<br />
Wales. The Parliament of Victoria has<br />
passed a bill with an addendum almost<br />
Machiavellian in quality.<br />
Dr. EvATT.-Almost Dunstonian.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-I do not wish to buy<br />
into that fight. Therefore, I prefer to<br />
put it on some fellow who is dead. The<br />
fact is that the Victorian measure will<br />
not become operative unless uniform<br />
legislation be passed in all the other<br />
States. The Parliaments of . South Australia<br />
and Western Australia have passed<br />
the bill with amendments, the result, no<br />
doubt, of a great deal of careful thought.<br />
The Parliament of Tasmania rejected<br />
the bill by reason of the vote in the<br />
Legislative Council. I gather from all<br />
this that if the ' Commonwealth Parliament<br />
desired additional repatriation<br />
power, or doubts were entertained as to<br />
whether it had adequate power, the Parliament<br />
of Victoria would unquestionably<br />
pass a bill referring such additional<br />
power as had been proved to be necessary.<br />
I do not believe that in such circumstances<br />
either House of the Tasmanian<br />
Parliament would refuse to fall<br />
into line. It is of no use to say to the<br />
people of Queensland and New South<br />
Wales, " It is all right; the argument is<br />
over". The argument is not over. The<br />
argument we now face is not whether<br />
other State Parliaments will refer power, but whether the Commonwealth Constitutiou<br />
should be changed. That will<br />
depend upon an affirmative vote at a<br />
referendum . by the majority of the people,<br />
in a majority of the States. The people<br />
of Queensland, therefore, have as lively<br />
an interest in this problem as have the<br />
people of Victoria or Western Australia.<br />
I shall make one other comment on<br />
these amendments. One of the features<br />
of the administration of this countryan<br />
inevitable feature probably-has been<br />
the amazing growth of official and administrative<br />
control. I shall not be so<br />
foolish as to pretend that this was completely<br />
avoidable in a time of war. It<br />
would be impossible for a Parliament to<br />
do all the tasks that need to be done in<br />
time of war; therefore Parliament<br />
: delegate power on a grand scale. But<br />
the truth is that so far has delegation<br />
gone in Australia, and so richly armed<br />
have the executive, and particularly<br />
e:: ecutive officials, ' become, that for tl:<br />
private citizens to-day life does not consist<br />
so much in submitting to the rule of<br />
l-w as in submitting to the rule of officials.<br />
Sometimes this is excellent, because<br />
we are fortunate in Australia in<br />
liaviig many able officials with a welldeveloped<br />
sense of responsibility.<br />
Mr. CURTIN.-Hear, hear!<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Every one who has<br />
had experience as a Minister in this war<br />
will gladly make this admission. I am<br />
not among those who slander the public<br />
servsants of this country. I am too muc<br />
in their debt to engage in cheap abus<br />
of them. But the fact remains that in<br />
on? hundred and one different ways, the<br />
public finds itself enmeshed in officialdlom.<br />
Officials have a power, the working<br />
out of which can never be adequatel"<br />
canvassed in this House, and the detail.<br />
of which must remain unknown to most<br />
honorable members.<br />
Mr. CURTIN.-If such power had not<br />
becn-granted and exercised chaos could<br />
easily have occurred in this country.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Up to a point.<br />
Dr. EVATT.-The Government led by<br />
the right honorable member appointed<br />
most of the officials.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-I am glad of that<br />
admission. I have not noticed that many<br />
of the officials we appointed have been<br />
dismissed by this Government. </p>
<p>Dr. EVATT.-NO, very few.<br />
M[ r. MENZIES.-Retrospectively, the<br />
Government has appropriated most of<br />
them to its own party from a period<br />
antedating its accession to office. Of<br />
course there must be additional officials<br />
during a time of war. But the Government,<br />
in my opinion, need not have<br />
been so fertile. Of course, ' steps had<br />
to be taken to deal appropriately with<br />
private citizens in order to preserve the<br />
economic structure of this country. I do<br />
not need to be told that in the whole<br />
economic structure of a country in time<br />
of war there must be check and balance<br />
or, if you like, irritation and counterirritation,<br />
in order to produce stability.<br />
I do not pretend that immediately the war<br />
ends this control must end. The controls<br />
must be reduced slowly with the restoration<br />
of peace conditions. The Parliament<br />
had to be armed with greater powers<br />
which, in their nature, were needed in<br />
war-time. But if the Parliament is to be<br />
clothed with greater powers for use in<br />
peace-time, I believe that we have the<br />
right to demand that those powers shall<br />
he exercised by the Parliament and not<br />
by the Executive, and that special steps<br />
shall be taken to see . that they are so exercised.<br />
Consequently honorable members<br />
on this side of the House, consider that<br />
if additional post-war powers are to be<br />
granted they should be exercised<br />
pr: imarily by the Parliament. If, in the<br />
administration of legislation passed<br />
under such additional powers, rules need<br />
to be made, they should be brought to<br />
the notice of the Parliament before they<br />
become operative, and not afterwards.<br />
' That, I consider, is of very great<br />
importance if the authority of the Parliament<br />
is to be preserved during the<br />
extremely difficult days upon which we<br />
shall enter in the post-war period.<br />
We do not desire to see the problem of<br />
constitutional reform exhausted by what<br />
is, after all, a . temporary solution. That<br />
is why we press upon the Government<br />
the proposal that within two years after<br />
the end of the war, it should take steps<br />
to convene a popular convention in Australia<br />
to which it should say, " Now let<br />
us see wha. t we can produce in the nature<br />
of a fundamental revision of the Constitution<br />
It may be that some revision<br />
will be made which will alter the whole balance of power, by reversing the residual<br />
powers or by adopting the model of<br />
Soulh Africa. Fundamental changes in<br />
thi: C onstitution will never be passed in<br />
Australia if they proceed from any party.<br />
We may as well have our eyes open to<br />
that fact. Some changes have a chance<br />
of being made in Australia if they proceed<br />
from a popular convention, which<br />
lias had abundant time and opportunity<br />
to consider problems that have to be<br />
faced and to form reasonable conclusions<br />
in respect of them.<br />
Mr. HOLT.-By " popular", does the<br />
right honorable member mean elective?<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Yes. I move-and<br />
I say to the Attorney-General that these<br />
are not drafting amendments, but are<br />
subject-matters put forward in general<br />
terms-That all the words after " that" be left out<br />
with a view to insert the following in lieu<br />
thereof I. The reinstatement and advancement of<br />
those who have been members of the fighting<br />
-ervices of the Comnionwealth in any war and<br />
the advancement of the dependants of those<br />
members who have died or been disabled as<br />
the consequence of such war, the reinstatemilent<br />
and rehabilitation of those other persons,<br />
who by reason of war conditions have been<br />
liplnlcc: tl from their normal peace-time occupations.<br />
the reconstruction of primary and<br />
sccondary industry are the first obligations<br />
r; f government in the immnediate period after<br />
the war:<br />
2. That the existing powers of the Commonwealth<br />
are not shown to be inadequate for<br />
. uch purposes;<br />
3. That it is, however, proper that any doubt<br />
on tliese points should be resolved by ,!) propriatc<br />
constitutional amendment;<br />
4. That no amendment should be approved<br />
which would authorize the socialization of<br />
industry, the undue centralization of admiinistration.<br />
or the maintenance of such laws as<br />
unnecessarily interfere with the liberty of<br />
citizens to choose their own means of living<br />
and to exercise their rights as free people;<br />
5. Further, that the House is concerned at<br />
the extent of the surrender of legislative<br />
powers to administrative officials;<br />
6. That, to afford adequate power to the<br />
Government and sufficient protection to the<br />
citizen, the bill should be withdrawn and<br />
redrafted so as to declare or provide, over a<br />
period of five years from the termination of<br />
actual hostilities, that the Commonwealth Parliament<br />
has, or should have ( as the case may<br />
be) power to make laws for the peace, order<br />
and good government of the Commonwealth<br />
with respect to the fullest repatriation powers;<br />
the use of grants, loans, insurance, training </p>
<p>and public works for the provision of employment<br />
and the prevention or correction of<br />
unemployment; the organized marketing of<br />
primary products of which there is normally<br />
an export surplus; and, notwithstanding anything<br />
contained in section 92, the prevention<br />
of unreasonable restraint of trade; the prevention<br />
of inflation; the use of economic regulations<br />
only to the extent necessary to deal with<br />
the problem of transition from war to peace;<br />
air transport; national health; family endowment;<br />
and the people of the aboriginal race;<br />
but should not have power to enable the Executive<br />
to engage in any civil production,<br />
industry, or commercial process, not authorized<br />
by its now existing powers; 7. That provision should be made that during<br />
such period the exercise of such additional<br />
powers, when it possesses a legislative nature,<br />
should be by Parliament or if performed by<br />
virtue of some delegation by Parliament<br />
. lluld be in terms which when Parliament is<br />
sitting have been first laid before and not<br />
disapproved by Parliament, and when Parliament<br />
is not sitting have been circulated to<br />
members at least fourteen days before becoming<br />
operative;<br />
8. That provision should be made for the<br />
setting up, within a period of two years after<br />
the termination of actual hostilities, of an<br />
elective popular convention for the review of<br />
the structure and working of the Constitution.<br />
