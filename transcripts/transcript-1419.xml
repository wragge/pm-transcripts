STATEMENT BY TH. I PRIMEI MINIST Mi. HARCLD HCLr,<br />
IN THI; HOUSE CF REPRESENA'rIVES<br />
21STCCTCBER, 1966<br />
ORD RIVER PROJECT.<br />
I desire to make a-statureni a tio, co the Ord River Project.<br />
This matter has been raised by the Honourable Member for Dawson ( Dr.<br />
Patterson). It is. of course of wide interest, and especial interest to<br />
Honourable Members from Western Australia. The Cabinet has given<br />
very close consideration again and extensive consideration to the<br />
request which had come to us from the West Australian Government for<br />
financial assistance for the development of stage two of the Ord River<br />
Scheme. Mr. Cleaver What more needs to be done?<br />
I have sent a letter, following the decision of the Cabinet, to<br />
Mr. Brand, the Premier of Western Australia indicating the Government's<br />
decision not to commit itself to provide financial assistance for stage two<br />
of the Ord River Project at present. In this letter I indicated that major<br />
uncertainties still exist in regard to the future prospects of the scheme,<br />
which the Commonwealth Government felt could be clarified only in the light<br />
of further experience with the pilot project comprising stage one of the scheme.<br />
These uncertainties are, of course, related to the request that the<br />
Commonwealth commit itself to funds in excess and perhaps over the years<br />
substantially in excess of $ 70 million over the next 15 years, and to the<br />
present considerable commitments on the Commonwealth's limited resources.<br />
More importantly, in the context of the project itself, our<br />
uncertainties are closely tied in with unresolved doubts about the viability<br />
of the scheme. The terms of the letter in order to save time were<br />
telephoned through to the W'est Australian Premier's Department. I have<br />
since received a telegram from the Premier in which he comments that he<br />
has received my telephone version of the letter and that he found it difficult<br />
to believe that such a decision had been made. He asks: " What more can<br />
be done to satisfy you on the Ord? What other evidence do you want? Cur<br />
belief is that the Ord River project could be the forerunner of similar<br />
developments in the north. A great vision for Australia is being unduly delayed.<br />
The telegram ias just reached me. This Government would<br />
emphatically deny that we are lacking in any way a vision for the<br />
development of this country which, during the period of office of my<br />
predecessor and of the Parties which I now have the honour to lead in<br />
Government, has made the greatest surge forward in its development. We<br />
have created the environment for development. We have encouraged projects.<br />
We have maintained the economic policies which have produced these results.<br />
In Western Australia very considerable sums are currently being outlaid<br />
and have previously been outlaid to encourage development in that State.<br />
However, we also have a responsibility to the whole of Australia that our<br />
resources shall be wisely employed. Our resources are not unlimited, and<br />
when considering a project which involves a commitment of upwards and I<br />
repeat perhaps substantially upwards of $ 70 million then we are bound to<br />
make the closest examination of it.<br />
Dr. Patterson Spread over 15 years.<br />
The Honourable gentleman says " over lb years", but every year the<br />
Government has other commnitments. A $ 70 million commitment does not<br />
become less than $ 70 million simply because the payments are spread over a<br />
number of years. We are spreading payments over a number of years in<br />
respect of a great range of items, some in the field of defence, some in the<br />
field of development. </p>
<p>Let me.. indicate-some of the difficulties which had to be considered by<br />
us. First, we looked at the world market outlook for cotton. It is generally<br />
a breed that this project at present stands or falls as a cotton project. It is<br />
strictly a monoculture project. There has been no attempt to argue that<br />
there is any alternative which would make it a viable project at the present<br />
time. It has been suggested that there are supplementary crops which<br />
could be grown in assistance of the cotton project but it is as a cotton<br />
project that the venture must basically be considered.<br />
Cotton is a surplus commodity in world markets. In recent years<br />
world production has exceeded consumption and large stocks have accumulated<br />
particularly in the United States Recent UI. S. legislation will probably<br />
put more U. S. cotton on world markets and further depress prices which<br />
have already fallen appreciably in recent times. In fact prices have fallen<br />
since the U. S. legislation came into effect on 1st August, and market<br />
investigations indicate that there could be further falls in the long term.<br />
As to cotton yields, average yields have improved considerably.<br />
However, it remains to be seen whether the farmers can attain a level at<br />
which, without cotton bounty, they would' be protected against likely increases<br />
in farm costs and possible further falls in world cotton prices. We acknowledge<br />
that there is a possibility of average yields reachiAng 1, 00j~ A lb. of lint per<br />
acre, but our technical advice is that this will require intensive research<br />
and a high standard of farming and handling of the crop.<br />
Now I come to the suggestion about stud cotton. One of the arguments<br />
advanced was that the practise of producing stud cotton, that is of allowing<br />
the cotton plant to bear for two seasons, would improve the overall economics<br />
of the scheme. But the experiment was tried out on only 35 acres, and our<br />
investigations overseas suggest that the stud cotton method is not a practice<br />
that is at all widely favoured. Indeed there is some evidence to the effect<br />
that it could attract additional pests and could weaken the prospects of the<br />
venture over the long term. Although considerable cost savings are<br />
claimed for this practice experience to date has been far too limited for us<br />
to draw greneral conclusions about its effect on production costs, yields and<br />
quality. As to supplementary crops, such as wheat and sorghum, these have<br />
not yet been grown commercially in the region and it is necessary to consider<br />
this project fundamentally on the basis of cotton. As to the cattle industry,<br />
the economic and practical feasibility of feeding cotton seed or grain to cattle<br />
in the region has not been demonstrated.<br />
There are a few other circumstances that a national government has to<br />
bear in mnind. The project would involve a considerable expansion in local<br />
production of cotton for sale on world markets, but, as I have said, cotton is<br />
a product that at present is surplus throughout the worldl and the market<br />
outlook for it is most uncertain. In this situation, and haviiag regard<br />
particularly to the fact that the area concerned is relatively isolated, in a<br />
relatively remote part of Australia we must be all the more careful not<br />
to appear to throw out any assurance to those who would hazard their<br />
capital and energies there that we have beconie completely convinced of the<br />
viability of the scheme.<br />
In this situation there is a need to be clearer on the future possibilities<br />
of cotton before committing ourselves or potential Crd farmers to the larger<br />
Ord project. The success of the project is of great importance not only for the<br />
farmer but also from the point of view of our international trade relations </p>
<p>-3-<br />
including-our relations with many less developed countries to whom cotton<br />
is an important project. In all probability, exports of cotton from Australia<br />
would have to be subsidised. Some $ 17 million has been spent by the<br />
Commonwealth and State Governments in constructing stage one of the<br />
project as a pilot scheme. It is not unreasonable, having regard to the<br />
uncertainty still persisting and the implications of failure, to allow stage<br />
one to fulfil its function as a pilot scheme more completely before<br />
proceeding to the full project.<br />
I think enough has been said to indicate that this matter has been<br />
most carefully considered. This Government, no less than any other<br />
Government and no less than any other political party, wants to do things<br />
which please the people who ask it to do things. But more than popularity,<br />
and more than approval from the government or the people of a State<br />
or from the people of the country as a whole, are involved here. What is<br />
involved is the responsibility we have as the national government to ensure<br />
that development will proceed as affectively as we can contrive and that<br />
we will make the best use of our limited resources of finance, manpower<br />
and the other elements required for an undertaking of this kind. </p>
