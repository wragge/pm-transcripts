Premiers' Conference and Loan Council Meetin!)-<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon.<br />
William Mcahion, C. li iP<br />
22 June 1972<br />
This has been my fourth meeting with the Premiers in<br />
this forum since I became Prime Minister.<br />
The three previous meetings were all characterized<br />
by a genuine effort by all parties to reach accommodations<br />
which took account of the problems of all of us. I am<br />
delighted to be able to say that the same atmosphere of<br />
warm and friendly co-operation has once again characterized<br />
this meeting. Our discussions on the States' fi1nancial. positions and<br />
requirements were greatly assisted by the States making<br />
available to us in advance of'the meeting extensive information<br />
on their financial positions and prospeCts. We appreciate<br />
their cc-operation in this.<br />
The discussions today have been conducted with great<br />
freedom and frankness. As a result I feel that we all have a<br />
greater understanding of the problems each of us faces.<br />
The Commonwealth, for its part, entered the discussions<br />
anxious to do what it could to assist the States in meetin5T theirheavy<br />
responsibilities. We know that they have great pressures<br />
upon them. All sections of the community have their ox'm<br />
requests to make. Each, naturally enough, sees its own<br />
problems as being of greatest moment. The State governments are<br />
therefore faced with a great variety of competing demands, which<br />
they have to deal with in some order of priority. </p>
<p>-2<br />
The Commonwealth is in a similar situation. One of<br />
its highest priorities, however, is the need to enable the<br />
States to meet their responsibilities. The allocation of<br />
funds for this purpose is the greatest single element in the<br />
Commonwealth Budget.<br />
Against this background we approached this meeting<br />
with the firm reso" lve that we had to reac~ h a fair and equitable<br />
agreement with the Premiers, having in mind both their<br />
responsibilities and the other responsibilities facing the<br />
Commonwealth. I am glad to be able to say that we have<br />
succeeded in reaching such an agreement.<br />
The elements of this agreement are as follows:-<br />
Revenue Assistance Additional assistance in the form of a permanent<br />
increase of $ 112 million to the financial assistance grants<br />
will be provided by the Commonwealth in 1972-73.~ This amount<br />
will be built into the formula grants for the purpose of<br />
calculating the grants for subsequent years, and will be<br />
distributed in proportion to the 1971-72 formula grants as<br />
escalated in 1972-73 under the formula.<br />
In addition to this extra $ 112 million, the<br />
Commonwealth will provide further amounts of approximately<br />
$ 7.1 million to New South Wales and $ 5.4 million to Victoria<br />
in 1972-73 by increasing the per capita payments over ' and above<br />
their formula grants by $ 1.50 from the present $ 2 to $ 3.. 50.<br />
The per capita payments, as increased, will be added to the<br />
formula grants for the purpose of calculating the grants in<br />
future years. A further amount of $ 3.5 million will, be paid to<br />
Western Australia in 1972 -73 as a special temporary addition to that </p>
<p>3.<br />
State's financial assistance grant in that year.<br />
Borrowing Pro rammes<br />
Works and housing programme<br />
The borrowing programme for State governments will<br />
total $ 982 million, an increase of $ 90 million or 10.1 per cent<br />
over 1971-72. Of the total, $ 248.5 million will be in the<br />
form of a grant, and ', 733.5 million will represent borrowings<br />
to be arranged by the Commonwealth.<br />
Larger authorities programme<br />
The borrowing programme for the larger (" semi-government")<br />
authorities will be $ 488 million, an increase of $ 49 million or<br />
11.2 per cent over 1971-72. The basic programme will total<br />
$ 466 million, and to this will be added a permanent addition<br />
of $ 10 million to New South Wales' share of the programme, and<br />
special temporary allocations of $ 3 million for Queensland<br />
and $ 9 million for Western Australia.<br />
Smaller authorities programme<br />
The practice of recent years of not imposing any<br />
limit on the over-all amount to be borrowed by smaller<br />
authorities will be continued. The limit on borrowings by<br />
individual authorities in this category will be raised from<br />
$ 300,000 to S400,000, thereby adding an amount conservatively<br />
estimated at 310 million to their total borrowings in 1972-73.<br />
Non-Metronolitan Unemplo rment Relief Grants<br />
The amount being provided by the Commonwealth for the<br />
relief of non-metropolitan unemployment will be increased from<br />
million to 6 million monthly. This increase will operate to<br />
the end of 1972, before which date the scheme will again be reviewed.<br />
Details of these decisions, and the distribution of the<br />
various amounts between the States, are shown in the tables attached. </p>

* It must be emphasised that the revenue grants figures shown are not comparable with those shown<br />
for the increases in the borrowing programmes. The former represent the additional assistance<br />
to be granted in 1972-73 over and above that which would be paid under existing legislation,<br />
whereas the latter represent increases over last year's levels. ( 4) Total 94.3<br />

3. Local Authority Programme<br />
The limit on individual borrowings by the smaller authorities<br />
was raised from $ 300,000 to $ 400,000. It is conservatively estimated<br />
that, as a result of this increase, the smaller authorities might borrow<br />
some $ 10 million in excess of the amount they might otherwise have<br />
raised. The practice of imposing no over-all limit on borrowings by these<br />
authorities has been continued.<br />
