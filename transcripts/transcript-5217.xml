FOR MEDIA THURSDAY 13 DECEMER 1979<br />
AIRFIELD DEVELOPMENT IN DERBY W. A.<br />
The Commonwealth Government is giving consideration to improving<br />
defence capabilities in northern Australia.<br />
The Department of Defence is currently delineating the optimum<br />
location south of Derby, Western Australia for a major RAAF<br />
-airfield.<br />
The Western Australian Government is cooperating in this work.<br />
Investigations are already underway involving drilling operations,<br />
and topographical surveys are to commence soon.<br />
It is intended to develop this airfield as a bare base capable<br />
of supporting all RAAF operational aircraft.<br />
It is expected to be similar to the base at Learmonth which has<br />
been under development for some time.<br />
