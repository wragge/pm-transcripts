    <content><![CDATA[<p>Consequent upon the Government's decision to increase the emphasis on program review, moves are being made in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to discontinue the separate existence of the Priorities Review Staff and to create within the Department a new Division - the Projects Division - to concentrate on program review. The Division, as well as reviewing Government policies and programs, will provide support for ad hoc bodies appointed by the Government to conduct major program reviews or policy examinations, including some currently in progress, and will also service the Planning and Co-ordination Committee of Cabinet.</p>
<p>In association with this change, other changes are being made in the Department's structure. The Policy Co-ordination Unit will be terminated and policy co-ordinator will largely lie within the responsibility of existing Divisions of the Department and the Projects Division.</p>
<p>Mr. Austin Holmes, the Director of the Priorities Review Staff, will become Consultant Economist to the Department, replacing Professor Gruen who is returning to the Australian National University in early March. Mr Holmes  appointment will not affect his work on the Medibank review on which he is now engaged.</p>
