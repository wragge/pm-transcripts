PRESS STATEMENT 499<br />
21 April, 1975<br />
DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT<br />
The Prime Minister has announced that the Governor-General<br />
today approved the change of the name of the Department of the<br />
Environment and Conservation to the Department of Environment.<br />
The Governor-General subsequently swore the Honourable Moss Cass,<br />
M. P. as Minister of State for Environment.<br />
Thie Prime Minister said that the former name suggested<br />
that conservation was a separate matter from the environment<br />
whereas it was in fact a major component of the Government's<br />
total environmental program. To refer to it as a separate area<br />
of concern was misleading.<br />
The Prime Minister noted also that " evrnet is<br />
the term used by all relevant United Nations agencies and the<br />
O. E. C. D. and includes all conservation programs of those bodies.<br />
