TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE -FRIDAY 11 APRIL 1986<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: Ladies and Gentleman this press conference was originally<br />
called to preview the overseas visit I'm undertaking next week.<br />
I'll just give you a brief resume of my views on that. There may<br />
be perhaps some other matters that you want to ask me questions<br />
about, which you can do after I've done that. You will<br />
appreciate that the common theme running through the talks I'll<br />
be having in Washington, London, Brussels, Rome and Athens, that<br />
is the concern the Government has for the position of Australia's<br />
rural producers, in the light of the corruption of international<br />
markets for agricultural commodities. So with that as our<br />
primary concern we will in the United States be asking basically<br />
two things. Firstly, that the administration of the United<br />
States should have regard to the interests of Australia's<br />
producers, in effect to their farm legislation. And that there<br />
should be, in so far as they proceed with that program, there<br />
should be a specific targeting of the program against those with<br />
a real concern in the United States and that there should not be<br />
an adverse impact upon Australia's rural producers. The second<br />
consideration that will be advanced is that the United States<br />
should use its best endeavours to ensure that at the Tokyo Summit<br />
meeting the question of trade and agricultural products should<br />
be on the agenda and that the United States and the rest of those<br />
engaged in the Summit should ensure that at the upcoming MTN<br />
round that agriculture should have a prominent place so that a<br />
much more stringent rules and regime in the GATT that apply to<br />
manufactured products should also apply in the case of<br />
agricultural goods. of course I'll be proceeding with the same<br />
range of arguments less the specific consideration of the United<br />
States farm legislation when I go to the United Kingdom, Brussels<br />
and to Rome and to Athens. While in the United States I will be<br />
addressing other matters in my conversations with the President<br />
and other representatives of the administration and Congress.<br />
without being exhaustive about those other matters, we'll be<br />
talking about the ANZUS alliance. About the South Pacific<br />
nuclear free zone and the desire that we as a country in the<br />
South Pacific have that the United States should adhere to the<br />
protocol of that treaty. we'll be talking about East/ West<br />
relations and arms control. And certainly I'll be wanting to<br />
talk to President Reagan about questions concerning southern<br />
Africa. I will in my visit to Rome and Athens, of course, be<br />
talking about matters of bilateral interest to us which spring<br />
very much from the fact that we in Australia have benefited so<br />
significantly from having a large Italian and Greek origin<br />
population. There will be matters of general interest for 8 A-1-n </p>
<p>discussion. Quite specifically also I'll be talking about the<br />
question of reciprocal social security arrangements. In that<br />
respect we'll be signing the relevant treaty arrangement with<br />
Prime Minister Craxi. So ladies and gentleman, that broadly is<br />
the ambit of the visit that I'll be undertaking. I think it may<br />
be most efficient if we have any questions directed to that area,<br />
then throw it open to anything else you want to talk about.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke the administration has already given<br />
Australia a number of assurances and taken a number of measures<br />
to ensure Australian agricultural trade is not affected by the<br />
Farm Act. Do you think it's realistic to expect further<br />
assurances and concessions?<br />
PM: I believe so. of course those assurances that you refer to<br />
already have flowed most recently from the very valuable work<br />
done by Mr Dawkins, the minister for Trade, on his visit to<br />
Washington. I'll be attempting to build on that work.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke in all the time that the GATT's been going<br />
there's been very little done for agriculture. Have you any<br />
particular reason to be more hopeful of the outcome this time?<br />
PM: I think there's one reason in particular and that is that<br />
the burden of the common agricultural policy of the European<br />
Community is, of course, increasing very significantly and is n ow<br />
of such dimensions that it is not only causing very considerable<br />
problems for efficient producers, like Australia, but it is also<br />
assuming increasing burden for the European countries themselves.<br />
It's adding significantly to their own costs and price structure.<br />
That involves a divergent and a misallocation of economic<br />
resources. It means that they can't optimize their own levels of<br />
economic activity. Now I think the understanding of that fact is<br />
one reason why we should have some greater degree of optimism in<br />
this area than we could have had in the past.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, more or less on the subject, could you<br />
give us a summary of your talks with Secretary Weinberger?<br />
PM: Well we covered-the issues of the ANZUS alliance, what the<br />
current position was and put the certain hypothetical situation<br />
if the New Zealanders went ahead with their proposed legislation.<br />
Of course I repeated what I have said both privately -and,<br />
publicly, that in that event we would be looking for. a position<br />
where the United States did not seek to repudiate the treaty<br />
itself. It makes sense to leave that in place and that as<br />
between the United states and Australia there should be an<br />
interchange of letters between President Reagan and myself, the<br />
effect of which would be to establish that as between our two<br />
countries the provisions of the treaty continue to operate. We<br />
discussed, as well, at some length, the South Pacific Nuclear<br />
Free Zone Treaty. I was at pains to establish in the mind of the<br />
Secretary that it would be a quite wrong interpretation of the<br />
development of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty to<br />
believe that for any of the countries of the South Pacific it<br />
represented any reaction to some Soviet position. A view that at<br />
* least implicitly could have been said to be expressed in a recent<br />
Department of Defence publication in the United States. I </p>
<p>stressed to the Secretary that this was a truly indigenous view,<br />
strongly held, unanimously held by countries in the forum. I<br />
emphasised that in our advocacy of the treaty and in all the<br />
argumentation that had gone on in the forum we had stressed that,<br />
as far as Australia was concerned, the treaty would not be, and<br />
would not be allowed to be by us, inconsistent with our treaty<br />
obligations and arrangements with the United States. And in that<br />
sense I expressed the hope to the Secretary that the United<br />
States would be able to see its way clear to become adherence to<br />
the protocols. We talked also about developments in the<br />
Philippines. They were the most substantial areas of discussion.<br />
There was some discussion on SDI as well.<br />
JOURNALIST: Sir did the Secretary give you any confirmation of<br />
the reports out of Washington that the Americans are planning<br />
more strikes against Libya.<br />
PM: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you raise with him the continued nuclear testing<br />
in Nevada?<br />
PM: No I did not go specifically to that.<br />
JOURNALIST: When you put to him that it would be helpful for the<br />
Americans to adhere to the three protocols of the treaty what was<br />
his response? Did he indicate that that might happen in the<br />
short-term, or long-term?<br />
PM: No. It would not be fair to the Secretary to say that he<br />
gave any such indication. I think the fairest way of putting it<br />
is he listened very carefully to the exposition I put, the strong<br />
expression of view that I put, that we would not allow our<br />
obligations, responsibilities and rights under our<br />
pre-arrangements with the United States, to be in any sense<br />
abrogated or diminished by the treaty. I think he understands<br />
that. Now, of course, the processes within the United States<br />
Administration will have to be pursued to what decision they make<br />
on this matter. It's a point that I'll be taking up further when<br />
I'm in the United States.<br />
JOURNALIST: How optimistic are you sir that they will eventually<br />
go along with it?<br />
PM: I think it's a matter in which it is unwise to post the<br />
odds. But I think our case is strong and I think the United<br />
States is persuaded of the integrity and validity of the position<br />
that we're putting. I think perhaps that the problem is not in<br />
that respect, but rather is to what impact adherence to the<br />
protocols by the United States may have for them, in their<br />
relations elsewhere.<br />
JOURNALIST: What was the substance of the discussion on SDI?<br />
PM: I said to the Secretary that I understood that the Defence<br />
minister, Beazley, had discussed this in detail with him, which<br />
he confirmed with me he had. And so therefore the Secretary had<br />
a clear understanding of our position which had been put by the </p>
<p>4<br />
minister in the Parliament earlier this week. Not much of<br />
substance beyond that, expect that on my part I reiterated the<br />
belief of the Government that while we accepted completely the<br />
integrity of the United States in their approach on this matter<br />
we could not be persuaded that, as far as we were concerned, it<br />
would be appropriate for Australia to be associated with the<br />
program. JOURNALIST: Mr Weinberger has made it clear that he is still<br />
going to offer Australian companies an opportunity to take part<br />
in the SDI program. Are you happy with that?<br />
PM: It's not a question of happiness, or unhappiness. As has<br />
been made clear by the minister for Defence, we will be<br />
receiving, as a Cabinet, submissions from the appropriate<br />
ministers on this matter and those residual areas, as the<br />
Minister for Defence referred to, will be considered in the light<br />
C of those submissions. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: On the Dawkins' matter, Mr Hawke, if the situation<br />
arose in the future in a situation similar to Mr Dawkins', would<br />
you be quite happy for a Minister to adopt the same attitude as<br />
Mr Dawkins, that is to make his own decision as to whether there<br />
is a conflict of interest or do you think it is preferable to<br />
put the matter before his colleagues.<br />
PM: Mike, I made clear in the Parliament today, and despite<br />
rather asinine observations from those opposite, there was no<br />
change from the position that we had put from the beginning on<br />
this. And that is that as a matter of regular, consistent<br />
requirements there will be, as laid down in the documentation<br />
which I tabled and of which you are aware, the requirement<br />
of the declaration of interest in regard to the Minister and<br />
members of their immediate family defined as you know it is.<br />
Now, that is step one. Step two, as I have said in the Parliament<br />
today, I don't think it is possible to have a general rule for<br />
fairly obvious reasons. Now, in saying that, there clearly<br />
could be cases in which some interest beyond the Minister and<br />
his or her immediate family could be relevant. Therefore, my<br />
pos ition would be that I would expect my Ministers to exercise<br />
their judgement. I can't have a general rule beyond immediate<br />
family. And I don't think anyone is really suggesting that you<br />
can. So therefore at the second level beyond immediate family,<br />
it becomes a question of judgement by the Minister concerned.<br />
Therefore, I say i~ n regard, and I take this opportunity of<br />
repeating in this audience, that I believe that the judgement<br />
made by Mr DAwkins was one taken in good faith and that he<br />
believed, on his consideration of it, that there was no conflict<br />
involved. He did not need to disclose. it. On the record of<br />
my Ministry in the over three years of government now, I have<br />
faith in the integrity of all of them. If we want to look<br />
comparatively at the record of this Government with our predecessors,<br />
there is only one conclusion that you can come to and that is<br />
that the previous government was scandal -ridden. There was<br />
a procession of resignations and dismissals. There should have<br />
been more, as I indicated today in the Parliament. This has<br />
been a solid Ministry and one of integrity. I have no reason<br />
to believe Mike that any of my Ministers would not address<br />
their minds, in the hypothetical situation to which you refer,<br />
and come up with the appropriate decision. And in those<br />
sort of circumstances where, by defintion, I think it is not<br />
open to have a general rule beyond the immediate family. One<br />
is in a position where you need to rely on the integrity of<br />
Ministers. I have every confidence in all of them.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you now happy with the situation where if he<br />
knows his mother stands to benefit from a decision in which he<br />
is taking part, he doesn't have to declare it. Is that what you<br />
are saying?<br />
PM: Yes. If the Minister makes the decision and addresses his<br />
or her mind to the question and is satisfied that there is no<br />
conflict of interests then on all the evidence I have had to<br />
this point, I have no reason to belief that the integrity of<br />
the decision making process will be prejudiced.<br />
JOURNALISTS: Why not take the same attitude to wives and<br />
children? </p>
<p>PM: I think for fairly obvious reasons. There is much more<br />
likelihood in the natural course of events of disposition of assets,<br />
not only in regard to Ministers, but everyone affairs, there<br />
is much more likelihood of a flow of assets between a person,<br />
whether it is a Minister or not, and wife and children than there<br />
is to distant relatives.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mother isn't distant, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well, it is not a normal sort of situation that you are<br />
in the acquisition of assets, going to be placing them with<br />
your mother. It is much more likely that there will be a<br />
co-location of assets and interests between husband and wife<br />
and husband and children.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, surely this is the wrong way round.<br />
PM: You may say surely it is the wrong way round..<br />
JOURNALIST: The flow of assets usually from parents to<br />
children? PM: In terms of the bequest of assets. I am talking about<br />
the situation as you acquire assets yourself. The reason for<br />
the immediacy of the rule, I think, has been quite clear. It is<br />
not only our rule. -The defintion that is involved in the Bowen<br />
rules and it is the definition that was involved in the decision<br />
made by the House recently. That is made sense in practical,<br />
realistic terms, conforming with normal practice, to talk about<br />
immediate family. What you are implying by your question is that<br />
there has been a mistake made not only by this Government in<br />
terms of the guide to Ministers, but by the House, by the Bowen<br />
set of definitions. It reflects th~ e fact that you talk about<br />
the Minister and immediate famil~ f5Teflects, I believe, the<br />
realities and the practicalities. AHaving said that, I want<br />
to emphasise that I don't believe that you cannot have a<br />
situation where an interest held by a person in relationship<br />
with the Minister, other than in terms of that immediate family,<br />
cannot be relevant. Now, you reach a point therefore, I am saying,<br />
where the judgements have to reside somewhere. I have no reason,<br />
on all the experience of my Ministers in three years, that they<br />
are not going to exercise that judgement with integrity.<br />
JOURNALIST: Where there are cases of doubt, wouldn't it be<br />
better for that judgement to be done collectively or by you<br />
as Prime Minister for the sake of consistency?<br />
PM: Once you say that you are going into the area beyond the<br />
immediate family, well then I think you are likely to have<br />
a position where a whole range of issues being considered by<br />
CAbinet and committees, you are going to have Ministers saying<br />
well however infinitesimal it is, well I better that, I better<br />
mention this. And I think that that is not going to produce<br />
an effective and realistic position. If I were faced with<br />
a position where I had any reason to believe, on three years<br />
of Government now, that my Ministry had given evidence as acting<br />
te. than in a proper way, then it may be that the different<br />
sort presumption that you would seek to apply would be appropriate.<br />
I have had no evidence to this point, that I need have that sort<br />
of concern. </p>
<p>7.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you have made the same judgement in Mr DAwkins'<br />
position, Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: How can I say that. I simply can't put myself in the<br />
situation of relationships between Mr Dawkins and his mother.<br />
JOURNALIST: In the case of your father, perhaps, of having<br />
a shareholding in one of those companies, would you have..<br />
PM: You are really getting into the hypothetical area.<br />
The old man wouldn't know what a share looked like.<br />
JOURNALIST: Shouldn't Senator Button have known that a<br />
company of which he was a director had shares in BHP?<br />
PM: Well, I doubt that he should have. If you are talking<br />
about the drawing of long bows, I think this"' about the longest<br />
one of all. According to the note I had passed to me in the<br />
Parliament later today, Senator Button publicly declared hi~ s<br />
directorship of that company. It is not something that he<br />
had hidden. I don't know whether it is the normal practice<br />
for directors to know of the shareholding, the whole portfolio<br />
shareholding of every company with which they are associated.<br />
I would think it surprising. I doubt if our friends on the<br />
other side of the House who have had associations, directorships<br />
of companies, many of them would pretend to know the exact<br />
portfolio shareholding of every company with which they are<br />
associated. I would be surprised if that was the normal<br />
practice in business.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, this company had invested half<br />
a million dollars in BHP shares. Wouldn't you expect the directors<br />
to know that?<br />
PM: Well, all I can say is this. And this is the important<br />
question. If Senator Button says he didn't know, I accept that<br />
fact. I have no reason at all on this or any other matter<br />
to question the integrity of Senator Button. And I would suggest<br />
neither have you. Nor anyone else in this room.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, in your statement of September 1983 you<br />
made it clear that there was an obligation upon ministers to declare<br />
if there was-* any possibility that a situation may arise out of<br />
a conflict of interests, for them to declare the situation.<br />
I am just wondering what extent has this actually worked in<br />
practice? PM: Without going to all the details, I can say Paul, that it<br />
has operated. And the records show that there have been occasions<br />
on which this has happened.<br />
JOURNALIST: : Have there been any occasions in the past when the<br />
possibility of government appointments of close relations of<br />
Government Ministers?<br />
PM: I can't give you the total list because I haven't had the<br />
total list put before me. I simply had a note that the records<br />
show that there have been a number of occasions on which this<br />
has happened. I am quite prepared to get that list and give you<br />
an answer to that question. Ian not in a position to do it<br />
at the moment. I simply don't have the information. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on that point about Senator Button.<br />
I thought, in your statement of September 1983, that Ministers were<br />
required to resign from directorships, a that Senator Button has<br />
not done.<br />
PM: I have got the House of Representatives thing here.<br />
will cover shareholdings, directorships of private companies. And<br />
I should make it clear in respect of that category that Ministers<br />
are required to resign any directorship from public companies and<br />
directorships of private companies unless for example such companies<br />
operate ( inaudible) or investments and the retention of<br />
the directorship is not likely to conflict with the public duty<br />
of the Minister." Now, I think the judgement that would have<br />
been made by the MInister is that the retention of the directorship<br />
is not likely to conflict with his public duties.<br />
JOURNALIST: In the light of the information we have today,<br />
do you think he should resign that directorship?<br />
PM: I had nothing put before me, at this point, that would<br />
lead me to that conclusion. I intend to have a discussion<br />
withiSenator Button. And when I say I intend to have a discussion<br />
I don't want any implication to be drawn from that, that I have<br />
any dissatisfaction with the Senator. But as it has now been<br />
a matter of public record, I think it is appropriate that I<br />
should have a discussion with him.<br />
JOURNALIST: But you now know Sir, that that company stood to<br />
make a very big profit from Senator Button's deliberations<br />
PM: No. But what I do know is that he has said that he was<br />
unaware of that shareholding. And I therefore know that, by<br />
definition, it could not have been a matter which affected his<br />
deliberations on that matter. It just seems to me appropriate<br />
Laurie, that it-having been raised, it would make sense for me<br />
S to talk with him, find out with him what is involved in his<br />
directorship. The nature of that involvement. It seems a<br />
very sensible thing to do. And I am sure he would want to<br />
talk to me about it. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: He conceded in the Senate sir, that under the<br />
Companies Act he has an obligation to look after the interest of<br />
shareholders of that company. Doesn't that conflict with his<br />
duties as a minister in some circumstances?<br />
PM: Not necessarily but it is precisely because, I guess, that<br />
possibility could arise that I want to talk with him. I can't<br />
JOURNALIST: Discussing the possibility of him resigning from the<br />
di rectorship?<br />
PM: Well, I won't be going in that sense I will be simply saying<br />
look John, this matter has arisen. I accept completely your<br />
statement that you were unaware of that shareholding, because I<br />
would have absolutely no reason to believe that he would tell<br />
other than the truth. I know he wouldnt. And ask what is the<br />
nature of the function he has their and the sorts of things that<br />
are involved. How much he is involved as a director, just what's<br />
the range of matters which come into that directorship and then<br />
as a result of that discussion see whether I would make that<br />
judgment. But I don't go into it with the basis that I am saying<br />
look you should resign. I mean it seems to me appropriate that I<br />
should find out what the situation is.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just to follow that up, Mr Tuckey is not a director<br />
of the company yet he was able to find that it had these shares<br />
in BHP. Don't you think Senator Button could have if he regarded<br />
this as an important principle.<br />
PM: Well, I guess Laurie, that when the matter came before the<br />
committee it didn't occur to him. I guess there was no reason why<br />
it should have. And now that he has become aware of it well, that<br />
matter has now been dealth with. But all, it seems to me, that<br />
one can do properly in these circumstances is that the matter has<br />
arisen, as I say, I repeat to you it does seem appropriate now<br />
that I should talk with him about it to see if there is any<br />
potential conflict of interest and in the light of that<br />
discussion make a decision.<br />
JOURNALIST: Doesn't that awareness though invite self<br />
constituted conflict of interest because he is dealing directly<br />
with an area all the time with BHP?<br />
PM: Well, his portfolio does very much come, into that area. He<br />
was responsible for the steel industry plan that's right. But I<br />
would simply make the point on that issue that the decision of<br />
the Government, in regard to the steel industry was one which-was<br />
not made for the benefit of BHP as such. It was made for the<br />
benefit of the country as a whole to the extent that BHP<br />
benefited from the steel industry plan. That was a residual, it<br />
was not the intention of the Government action. But I don't think<br />
I can usefully add to what I have said. I am clearly not trying<br />
to avoid the question that has arisen as a result of the<br />
disclosure of his directorship. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Can I go back to an earlier point Prime Minister,<br />
since he has conceded under the Act he has an obligation to look<br />
after the interests of shareholders of that company which holds<br />
BHP shares as well. Isn't that intrinsically a conflict of<br />
interest?<br />
PM4: Potentially it is, it is one of the matters......<br />
JOURNALIST: Intrinsically, doesn't the conflict exist all the<br />
time? Can he look after the interest of those shareholders and<br />
still fulfill his duties as a Cabinet minister honestly and<br />
without any conflict?<br />
PM: It raises a prima facie problem and that is why I want to<br />
talk with him.<br />
JOURNALIST: Where does that leave the Cabinet decision then Mr<br />
Hawke, if Senator Button does accept that there was a conflict of<br />
interest? Doesn't that undermine the Cabinet decision itself?<br />
PM: I don't believe it undermines the Cabinet decision.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, doesn't this point concerning<br />
Senator Button just highlight the problem of relying on a<br />
minister's own judgment about a possible conflict of interest in<br />
that you have to now go back to him and really run Senator Button<br />
through his thought processes and see if you agree with them.<br />
PM: Well, let me say and I pick up really a point that was made<br />
by Mick Young in his speech in the House. I think the logic of it<br />
and the sequence of it should be understood. When the previous<br />
government was in power they resisted strenuously any attempt to<br />
try and bring in some rules and order into this question of<br />
private interests and public responsibility. We have moved now to<br />
bring a greater degree of regulation into that area. Now as the<br />
Special Minister of State said, and I believe rightly, this issue<br />
is going to evolve. I don't think that the Government, certainly<br />
I wouldn't make the judgment that we necessarily have got it 100%<br />
right when we made the change. What I would assert without any<br />
possibility of I believe relevant objection is this that we<br />
have made a substantial move to improve the position of bringing<br />
into juxtaposition the question of public responsibility and<br />
private interest. we have done infinitely more than has ever been<br />
done before. Now if there are some bugs i-n it, if it can be<br />
improved then so be it, that will be done. We are not to be<br />
criticised for that. We have made the move to improve the<br />
situation. If we can do it better, we will.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just on that point Mr Hawke, while recognising what<br />
the Government has done on pecuniary interests. In the light of.<br />
what has happened involving both Senator Button today and Mr<br />
Dawkins in the last couple days, would you be prepared to<br />
concede that at least to some extent your ministers have been a<br />
bit less than careful in adhering to your statement in September<br />
1983 that they should inform on any matter that may give rise to<br />
a conflict of interests. </p>
<p>Pm: You see it goes back to the answer I gave before Paul, that<br />
I believe Mr Dawkins when he said that he addressed his mind to<br />
this matter and believed that there was no conflict. And I am<br />
prepared to accept that judgment and certainly in the case of<br />
Senator Button. I accept without question his observation that he<br />
did not<br />
JOURNALIST: that is the point<br />
PM: Well, could I finish. What is said here and I am referring<br />
to the passage I understand which says ministers have to make a<br />
declaration at meetings of Cabinet committees of any matter which<br />
may give rise to a conflict of interest. By definition where the<br />
knowledge is with them, in the first instance they have to make a<br />
judgment as to whether there will be a conflict of interest. Now<br />
I have said at the beginning I don't think you can have a general<br />
rule about that beyond on the immediate family. Now you ask me do<br />
V I think that they may have made an error of judgment. I don't<br />
think in, it was only one case because with Senator Button there<br />
was no knowledge, in the case of Mr Dawkins I am prepared to<br />
accept his judgment. I don't believe in his consideration of the<br />
matter that he was affected in his consideration of it by the<br />
knowledge that his mother had some undetailed holding in Bell. I<br />
watched him in action. I am now speaking with hindsight of<br />
course, but I watched him in action, I listened to him. I had no<br />
reason at all to believe from my recollection of the meetings<br />
both with BHP and with Bell that Mr Dawkins was influenced by<br />
that fact. There was no evidence in any way.<br />
JOURNALIST:........ correct political judgment given the<br />
circumstances? PM: Well, it may be that Mr Dawkins would now make a different<br />
judgment. I don't know but I accept without hesitation that ( a)<br />
he addressed his mind to it, as a matter of logical thought<br />
processes he believed there was no conflict in it. I accept that<br />
that happened and those processes. I have no reason therefore to<br />
believe that he acted improperly. It may be that now he would<br />
make a different decision but who can say that. The important<br />
thing in regard to the attack that has been made on Mr Dawkins<br />
was in regard to that circumstance. I believe implicitly that he<br />
acted with integrity, that he did what he said he did.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you recollect how many times you have been<br />
called on by other members of the ministry to make a judgment on<br />
possible conflict of interest?<br />
PM: No, I can't recollect that as I said in answer to a previous<br />
question. JOURNALIST: Sir, can I change the subject briefly?<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you expect Senator Georges to be expelled from </p>
<p>the Party for voting against the Government today?<br />
PM: Let me say what has happened. I have spoken with at their<br />
request the Chairman and Secretary of Caucus, Mr Mildren and Ros<br />
Kelly and they have indicated that they are conveying to both the<br />
Queensland State Secretary and Federal Secretary of the Labor<br />
Party the action of Senator Georges and I would anticipate that<br />
the processes of the Party will now follow.<br />
JOURNALIST: What processes?<br />
PM: Well, when you say processes I can say what is the provision<br />
in the Party. A person cannot do what Senator Georges has done.<br />
We haven't got any recent processes on which to rely but I assume<br />
that once the State Secretary of the Party has been informed that<br />
they would move to give effect to the provisions of the<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you, like me, believe there is no alternative to<br />
expulsion in the rule?<br />
PM: Well, I am one who doesn't have a public exposition of what<br />
goes on within this great Party. I allow that to occur privately<br />
without expressing my view.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the same subject Prime Minister, three members of<br />
the House of Reps got up and amendments from the Senate<br />
which provides for the extension of the deregistration time scale<br />
from 3 to 5 years. They got up at about 4.25 pm. They said it<br />
hadn't gone to Caucus, should it have gone to Caucus?<br />
PM: Well, we had a time problem here. They discussed with the<br />
minister and with the Leader of the House and the problem that we<br />
had was that if in fact you have it going back to the House with<br />
the Democrats amendments not being accepted and then going back<br />
to the Senate, there is a timetable which the minister has in<br />
fact initiated and in regard to which the unions involved are<br />
then that would have been frustrated. Now in those<br />
Scircumstances the minister met with the Caucus committee in<br />
. offering a time to have the normal processes to which I have<br />
referred and that was regarded in the circumstances, I believe,<br />
by the majority of people Parliament House<br />
