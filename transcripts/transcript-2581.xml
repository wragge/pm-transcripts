/ NOT FOR RELEASE<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, PARMELIA HOTEL,<br />
PERTH. W. A. 4L/ f<br />
4 May 1972<br />
I wonder if I could go through some sort of preliminary<br />
explanation to you first.<br />
As we all know, there has been a deal said about our<br />
Imiration Policy and programme, so on the way here, I had a talk<br />
to D. For es, the Minister for Immigration, in Adelaide; and then<br />
on the way across here, I personally edited a statement relating to<br />
Government policy.<br />
Now this is of great national importance because it will be<br />
definitive, but it will explain exactly what our policy is, in fact,<br />
and the way the administration of that policy will be carried out in<br />
the future. I don't know how you'd like me to handle this, but I have<br />
copies of this paper prepared for you. Simultaneously, on the trip<br />
coming here I prepared one on the differences between the Policy of<br />
my own Government, the Liberal/ Country Party Government, and that<br />
of the E: Pposition., and the questions that the Opposition must<br />
* answer. I've done both of those they're in type.. If you'd like<br />
I could just read them out to you now and then you could know<br />
exactly what our policy is. Then, you can go on to any other kind<br />
of question that you want to ask me. I think the first one is so<br />
important, the precision is also important to us.<br />
Q Prime Minister, your visit here is being seen by some<br />
as the launching of the Liberal Party campaign for the<br />
Federal Election this year. If so, how worried ar you<br />
about the Election?<br />
PM Well, the first ~ part of your statement is wrong<br />
the second one is not necessarily cause for alarm.<br />
Q Sorry, Mr Prime Minister, for reverting the statement<br />
like that. Could you tell us whether you see any disparity<br />
between this statement and those made by Mr Chipp?<br />
PM Mr Chipp has gone on the record. I'd say that he<br />
endorses the statement made by my colleague, the Minister<br />
for Immigration, and has no differences with him whatsoever<br />
as to what Government policy is and means.<br />
Q We've a very severe drought in our goldfields areas -9<br />
at the moment. What are the prospects of our pastoralistsJ<br />
in those areas getting Commonwealth loan grants<br />
PM Yes, we have a policy that ought to be pretty well<br />
known by now because it's been in existence at least since<br />
I was in the Treasury, and I was one of those who could be<br />
regarded as the father or the mother of the programmes<br />
relating to drought and other national disasters. What<br />
we do is to say to the State Governments you handle these<br />
up to the limit of your capacity. If it is beyond your<br />
capacity then let us know, and we will do our best to help.<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Now, put in terms of pounds, shillings and pence, we say<br />
to the various State Governments,' all right, you handle<br />
these droughts anid other tradegies up to a certain limit,<br />
and above that, providing we agree with you as to the<br />
conditions that exist, then we'll find the finance for<br />
the rest of it.<br />
So the position today is that, if the Labor Government<br />
in Western Australia, think that there is a drought existing<br />
there of severe proportions that they can't handle themselves,<br />
and was beyond the financial amount that has been agreed<br />
upon between the two Governments, they can then make an<br />
application to us for the funds.<br />
Q Sir, will your Government intervene in the dispute<br />
between Queensland and Papua/ New Guinea over the far north<br />
of the Queensland border, and try to settle the dispute<br />
while Papua/ New Guinea is still under Australian jurisdiction<br />
or take the matter to the International Court that was<br />
mentioned by MR Whitlam, I think<br />
PM Could you go through that again for me, please Just<br />
read it again if you don't mind.<br />
UQQ ueenslWailnl dt hea ndG oPvaeprunam/ eNnetw inGtueirnveean eo veirn tthhee dFiasr puNtoer thbeertnw een pluV&amp;<br />
Queensland border, and try to settle the dispute while<br />
Papua/ New Guinea is still under Australian jurisdiction<br />
rather than wait till Papua/ New Guinea gets independence,<br />
and then take the matter to the International Court?<br />
PM At the moment, it's clear without any doubt that the<br />
jurisdiction over the areas there are with the Queensland<br />
Govenrment. It is a matter that we could naturally talk<br />
to the Queensland Government about, but it is one that<br />
does not, I think, justify any action by the International<br />
Court of Justice.<br />
Q Prime Minister, in the light of the happenings of<br />
this week do you consider the way in which the war in<br />
Vietnam is conducted, say two or three years ago, was a<br />
waste of time<br />
PM No I don't. I do not. I think we gave the Vietnamese,<br />
through the joint operations of our allies and ourselves,<br />
the opportunity to defend themselves, and to complete<br />
their policy of Vietnamisation. What I have to admit is<br />
that it does appear as though the attack by the North<br />
Vietnamese strongly supported in arms and equipment by<br />
the Russians, has created a dangerous situation there.<br />
I don't concede it was a mistake to intervene. I think<br />
it was proper, providing we accept that the basic<br />
principle was to help that country defend itself, and keep<br />
its own independence. I hope they continue to be successful.<br />
I hope they do.<br />
Q Are you still in close contact with * Mr Nixon about our<br />
policy in Vietnam<br />
PM No, not in close contact with him: Not as close as I was<br />
during the period that we had troops at Phuoc Tuy Province. ./ 3 </p>
<p>33.*<br />
Q But this would mean that we would discover our own<br />
policy irrespective of the policy of the United States<br />
at the present time<br />
PM What do you mean by that -because we have no troops<br />
there, and I have already stat~ d that we won't be permitting<br />
troops to return, combat troop Is so there is very little<br />
of our policy involved here.<br />
Q We would not act in any othe'rway<br />
PM No.<br />
Q Prime Minister, could I revert back to the statement.<br />
Mr Calwell seems to think that there is evidence that<br />
the settlement of non-Europeans in this city is notsuccessful.<br />
Your statement here says that obviously<br />
the policy and its administration has been successful.<br />
What do you have to say about MIR Calwell's mment?<br />
PM From the information given to me as late as today<br />
the number of non-European, or people of partial non-<br />
European stock coming to Australia, is not very great.<br />
But percentage-wise, there is a bigger number coming into<br />
Western Australia than to other parts of Australia. But<br />
the second point that I want to make is that they seem to<br />
be being integrated fairly well, and so far as we are<br />
concerned, looking at it from a totally Australian point<br />
of view, there have been very little difficulties. But<br />
nonetheless we recognise that there are more coming here,<br />
percentage-wise, and consequently it's a matter which we<br />
have and will continue to give very close attention.<br />
I don't regard it as an insuperable or difficult problem<br />
to manage.<br />
QMr Whitlamd has accused you of not giving voting rights to<br />
18 year olds becauseyou might be afra:. d of how young<br />
Australians might express themselves at the polls. What<br />
answer do you have to this and what is the reason why _ jou<br />
have rejected the proposition of ' 18 year * old voting rights?<br />
PM Well, the answer to the first part is that I take very<br />
little notice of what Mr Whitlam says, ever, and I'll<br />
continueto adopt that policy while I remain the Prime Minister,<br />
and I hope that will be a long time. And it's a political<br />
question, therefore, that I have to answer. But I made it<br />
clear in the House that we would not be giving a vote to<br />
the 18 year olds during the forthcoming election. And<br />
I believe that to be correct for several reasons.<br />
The first one is that if you look -at our Constitution<br />
itself, you will find that there is a clause in it that<br />
requires the person to be of adult age. I know that there<br />
is a great deal of difficulty in various interpretations<br />
that can be based upon . the words. But until they are at a<br />
stage throughout Australia where they are given complete<br />
adult status with all the rights and responsibilities,<br />
then I feel we are correct in maintaining the correct<br />
position. The second pointis that if you test Australian opinion,<br />
./ 4 </p>
<p>PM conf lict<br />
Q PM and the gallup polls are helpful here, although I don't<br />
necessarily say that we look at the gallup polls under<br />
all sets of circumstances; But if you test the gallup<br />
polls, I think you'll find that a pretty healthy majority<br />
of people feel that it's bett-er to wait until you feel<br />
that they have these responsibilities and privileges,<br />
full adulthood, before we move to give them the vote in<br />
the Commonwealth Parliament.<br />
And don't forget, under our Constitution, you can't<br />
be a member of the Commonwealth Parliament unless you're<br />
21 years of age.<br />
Mr McMahon, on the financial scene, do you expect<br />
to be able to announce the results of your enquiry into<br />
the State taxation system before the next Federal election<br />
No. Will the Federal Government consider taking over<br />
Company legislation in Australia<br />
What I hiive said during the course of the last dy<br />
or two, in fact I said it last night, published in today's<br />
papers, that what we are doing immediately is to look at<br />
the Restrictive Practices Act and we will considerably<br />
strengthen= t. But bfore-we move to legislation, we will<br />
table a statement in the Senate and the House of Representatives;<br />
we will throw it open to full debate there, and we will invite<br />
discussions from commercial, industrial and other interests,<br />
before we put it down in terms of a BILL. We feel that this<br />
is what is necessary. And of course, if we legislate, and we<br />
believe we have proper power under the Constitution to<br />
legislate, then of course to the extent to which there is any<br />
between State and Commonwealth legislation, our legislation<br />
will prevail. That is number one. The other one that I<br />
mentioned which is relevant, but not necessarily relevant<br />
to the question you asked, but also we'll be ta. b. ling a paper<br />
round about the same time on capital inflow into this country,<br />
and of course foreign takeovers, or attempted takeovers<br />
will be considered in the context of both those statements.<br />
Sir, you were met at the airport by a group of de<br />
strators whose theme seemed to be unemployment. Would you<br />
care to comment on how you feel abouEttisparticularly<br />
in Western Australia an increase or a decrease<br />
WEll, first of all, I saw a small group, but I didn't<br />
know what they were yelling out about. And last time I<br />
was here, I remember up to one of them and saying ' Aren't<br />
you the son of so-and-so, a pretty good Liberal?' And he<br />
said ' Yes'. I said ' What are you doing here?' He said<br />
' I get $ 10 for this'. So I've forgotten it. I've never<br />
heard that before anywhere. I hope it doesn't spread too<br />
far. But what do I feel * personally about the unemployment<br />
position, on a general plane? I think that any reasonable<br />
person, knowing that we have to absorb 180,000 young people<br />
leaving school or tertiary education over the Christmas<br />
NEW Year period, must know that the figure we've got the<br />
enemployment down to now, by the end of March, was pretty good.<br />
") dly S-/ 4 </p>
<p>I dont' want to enter the field here of making forecasts<br />
in front of my colleague, the Minister for Labour and<br />
National Service, because he takes the responsibility<br />
and when the figures become available, I think he should<br />
announce them, and if they've fallen substantially, get<br />
the credit for it.<br />
But of this I can assure you, that on thebasis of a<br />
general overall look, and knowing the trends, and loo]~ ing<br />
at them as he and he alone could look at them on the advice<br />
of his advisers, he feels the outlook is pretty good.<br />
Naturally, I'll be waiting until the next figures comes<br />
out, and I think if I can just fall in with his optimism,<br />
I think it's the right way to look at it without mak~ ing<br />
any positive forecasts.<br />
As to the specific position of Western Australia,<br />
of course you have your difficulties other than the one<br />
of school leavers and people leaving tertiary education.<br />
What you had is the end of the mining boom, and consequently,<br />
you must have felt a more severe rise in unemployment than<br />
you have in any other state. But what have we done We<br />
gave you money for rural unemployment, and rural unemployment<br />
is pretty sound now. If you look at the March figures, you<br />
will see that percentage wise you've-done better than in<br />
March of other years, and certainly for the last two.<br />
Thirdly, we gave pretty substantial votes to your<br />
Government in order to improve economic conditions.<br />
And so you'll find gradually a greater feeling of<br />
confidence, and I'm sure it is here now rate of demand<br />
for labour, and I know that that regular demand is<br />
improving, particularly in the vacancies position, is<br />
improving very strongly. So we hope, the Government hopes,<br />
and I particula-rly hope that as a result of what we've done<br />
at Loan Council and Premiers' Conference, and later on with<br />
the mini-Budget, that we'll find the kind of result that we<br />
need, and we'll get the figures that we think are satisfactory.<br />
But, if we don't get them, the economy isn't moving<br />
along the way we-want. And, as we've done so frequently,<br />
we will move again. I don't think we'll have to, but as<br />
my Government doesn't believe in the old fashioned idea<br />
of moving only at budget time. we've shown that we don't<br />
stick to that hold and I can assure you that if we find<br />
it necessary to move again, we most certainly will do so.<br />
Q On that tack, Sir, Mr Gorton is quoted as suggesting<br />
that the Liberal/ Coun-' ry Party coalition could do with<br />
revitalising and new ideas. Do you have anything to say?<br />
PM No. I have never commented about Mr Gorton or any of<br />
his statements.<br />
Q Then the suggestion from me that there could be<br />
revitalising and new ideas<br />
PM Well, I don't put you in the same class as Mr Gorton.<br />
If you don't mind, I'd rather answer him direct.<br />
Q. Then an idea which is old in the Liberal Party.<br />
Do you see room in the Liberal Party for continuing rights<br />
of the individual and free enterprise In a growing<br />
nation, can that principle be pursued </p>
<p>/ 6.71<br />
PM I've lived for those two ideals that you've mentioned.<br />
I wouldn't have gone into Parliament if I'd not thought I<br />
could make a contribution to maintaining the rights of the<br />
individual to feedorn and independence within the law.<br />
And I'll do everything I can in the time that I am there<br />
to see that those rights and those privileges are kept<br />
in tact. And that's why I'll do my best to defeat the<br />
Labor Party that is socialist in outlook, and if you get<br />
to know them as I know them, you'll know that they're not<br />
only socialist, but centralist, but they want their will<br />
to be enforced upon the people rather than think of<br />
themselves as there in the interests of the people and<br />
the liberties of the people themselves. And that's why<br />
all so frequently we do come along and want the people to<br />
live within the law. That's why we try to strengthen it<br />
whenever we can as for example in our industrial relations.<br />
As to free enterprise, free enterprise has made us the<br />
great country we are. You in Western Australia know what<br />
it's meant to the development of this country, the developof<br />
the mining interests. And of course I'll protect it all<br />
I can; of course I should have praised-it much more than I<br />
have in the past few months. But I can assure you, that now<br />
that you've raised it, tomorrow at the meeting with Industry<br />
and Commerce I'll priase them,-and let you know exactly<br />
what I think of them..<br />
Q Mr McMahon, on the question of inflation how important<br />
does the Government think it is to Keep these brakes on the<br />
economy in order to control inflation during the next few<br />
months? And secondly, in view of the high level of<br />
liquidity on the surface at the moment, will the Government<br />
consider a prices and incomes policy to prevent a further<br />
growth of inflation?<br />
PM There's obviously misconception in what you've stated.<br />
And the second part of your question, the conclusion doesn't<br />
follow from your premises. So that's the easiest and most<br />
definite ~ ay in which I can answer your question. Would you<br />
mind then if I give my impression of what you mean. There<br />
are two ways of looking at an economy today. The first one<br />
is to look at the question of inflation and ask yourself.<br />
how is it caused. Is it due to demand or is it due to wages?<br />
Our inflation as we know now, is fundamentally due to wage<br />
inflation. And if you've seen wages rising at about 11% or<br />
more, and you've got productivity rising at the raeof 2<br />
then, without any doubt whatsoever, as to the difference<br />
between the two, you will have an inflationary pressure<br />
which sooner or later must manifest itself. So that is<br />
there, and it depends on the wage fixing tribunals as to<br />
the extent of inflation. This sort of wage cost inflation<br />
will go on. But, as I tried to say a few minutes ago,<br />
we in the Liberal Party don't live with the old fashioned<br />
ideas that everything is created by a single cause. And we<br />
don't believe in the old theory that demand inflation is the<br />
only cause of inflation. So what we've shown pretty clearly<br />
since November of last year, is that we would when we realised<br />
that demand was not growing as rapidly as we wanted it to, </p>
<p>we knew that cost inflation would go on for some<br />
time if our policies turned out to be successful,<br />
inflation would be gradually reined in under control<br />
we decided that demand wasn't high enough so we<br />
stimulated through monetary policy.<br />
WE then had the Premiers Conference I believe the<br />
most successful I've known in 22 years and we then gave<br />
the States aditional ability to spend, and that created<br />
further demand. Later on, we approved, in the field of<br />
education. a large grant for the building of schools.<br />
And in the mini-budget we again boosted demand to a<br />
considerable extent by about $ 180 million, which by<br />
indirect effect wouldt probably increase demand over<br />
a period by as much as a minimum of $ 350 m.<br />
So that we've shown that we are prepared to move in<br />
terms of assisting demand, but at the same time we have<br />
taken action to rein in cost wage inflation if we can.<br />
An importarlit decis:. on willbe that of the Commission in the<br />
National Wage Case when it appears early next week.<br />
As to the last part of your question, I said it did't<br />
follow. It was a non sequitur, or the conclusion that you<br />
came to wasn't a logical one based on the facts that you'vye<br />
mentioned. But if you could tell me exactly what it is<br />
that you want me to answer, I'll give you the precise answer<br />
to it.<br />
Q IN VIEW of the extent of wage costs causing inflation,<br />
in order to prevent this happening again, will the Government<br />
consider implementing some kind of prices and incomes<br />
policy?<br />
PM I've given the ans-.' er to this in the House on several<br />
occasions. We frankly do not believe, not at the moment<br />
anyhow, that a wage price tribunal can be successful.<br />
We've not seen it successful in any other country. And<br />
we know of no good reason why we think that there should<br />
be something novel about it in the case of Australia.<br />
But what I have done is ask the Treasury to prepare a<br />
paper for me it would be another form of white paper<br />
showing the actio~ n taken in other countries, and the<br />
results or the consequence of theaction that has been taken.<br />
THis will be debated, and if we felt that, after the debate<br />
had occurred in the House, we were justified in making some<br />
changes, we would do so. But I can assure you of this-that<br />
unless wages themselves are brough) t under control by the<br />
tribunals, then it would be extremely difficult to get a<br />
prices and incomes policy that would be satisfactory or<br />
would give an appearance of being able to work reasonably.<br />
Q Mr Prime Minister, our Wooldgrowers will express ( 61_<br />
unhappiness if they've got to wait any longer for their<br />
wool acquisition plan. They say that the RAndall Report<br />
should have been completed in time for legislation to be<br />
introduced this session. The situation is quite acute.<br />
Can you offer them any hope?<br />
PM First of all I dispute your words; the last word that<br />
you've used.-But secondly, I ask. you people this question.<br />
We appointed the RAndall Committee, and Sir Richard is a<br />
very talented civil servant, and we asked him if he would<br />
report to us on what should be done, particularly with<br />
regard to the deficiency payments in the 1972/ 73 woolgrowing<br />
season. That report is very nearly ready I belio-ve / 8 </p>
<p>8. L<br />
it will be ready within the next two or three weeks.<br />
I don't belive that a Government should be called upon<br />
to make adEcision for the 1972/ 73 season until that report<br />
is in our hands. I believe it would be wrong, having asked<br />
that Committee to make it; it has spent a lot of time and<br />
a tremendous amount of effort; if we were to turn round<br />
and we were to foreclose any of the options of that<br />
Committee or any other recommendations that had been made<br />
to us. Thiey'll come to us very quickly, and we'll certainly<br />
be mna position to act well before the next wool-selling<br />
season commences so that the closing part of your statement<br />
is correct.<br />
Q MR Prime Minister, it has been suggested from Country<br />
Party members that the LIberal Party members are opposed<br />
to an acquisition scheme, particularly those members in<br />
Sydney, in that area<br />
PM I have given you the answer to the question which<br />
follows on the one that was immediately asked. I see<br />
no reason in the wwrld why we should foreclose any of<br />
our options before the Randall Committee Report. it<br />
will be reporting to us within fourteen days or not<br />
much later and until that stage is reached, neither I<br />
nor any of my colleagues will be prepared to make any<br />
kind of statement publicly about acquisition.<br />
Aansd t. h t1e part of your statement about<br />
a difference of opinion on that aspect you are wrong.<br />
Q Last month, it was announced that there would be a<br />
review of the taxation system. What chance is there of<br />
us seeing any reforms in this year's budget<br />
PM I've answered that questirn already based upon the<br />
findings of the Committee.<br />
Q Prime Minister, do you think it's fair the intervention<br />
of the Government particularly State Governmentsin<br />
business as we've experienced in the last few days<br />
or week or so, to do with the Ansett takeover.<br />
PM Forgive me, for saying this is one question I don't<br />
want to answer. The first reason is that it was an<br />
action taken by Sir Henry Bolte himself at a time whe~ n<br />
I had stated what the attitude of the Government was,<br />
and it was a clear one. I would not have permitted<br />
Ansett to be taken over or to be controlled by any foreign<br />
interests.. Secondly I would have ensured that our own<br />
securities over the assets of Ansett, the money we'd<br />
lent them, would be protected. And thirdly, I thought<br />
it right that market forces should operate because they<br />
were two Australian corporations acting under Australian<br />
management, and very largely under Australian ownership.<br />
But, this has happened. I don't want to become involved<br />
in these circumstances with Sir Henry Bolte.<br />
Q In to the general principle would it mean that<br />
Australia would eventually have to have, again, tighter<br />
controls on foreign investments and foreign ownership in<br />
this country.<br />
PM I have said a few moments ago that we have already / 9 </p>
<p>initiated two sets of enquiries one related to private<br />
capital movements and I stated in my statement that I<br />
made yesterday, that that could lead to greater control<br />
or greater regulation of private capital inflow into<br />
Australia so consequently, we've got to consider this<br />
question of whether we'll have and in what way and to<br />
what extent we'll permit ownership of Australian assets<br />
by overseas interests.<br />
And the other one relates to the retiiv prcies.<br />
This will involve takeovers by internatinal or overseas<br />
corporations as well as local and domestic ones. So<br />
these are well in my mind. I want the-nfiaximum of Australian<br />
ownership. I want the maximum of Australian control.<br />
I want Australians to participate in management and this<br />
is a goal we've set and this is a goal we'll be looking<br />
to achieve when we get these reports. But we'll do it<br />
on a basis of knowing the facts knowing where Australia's<br />
best interests lie. Because we are not going to do anything<br />
foolish that is going to work agianst your interests,<br />
or the interests of average Australians. We are not going<br />
to work against the interest of full employment, rapid<br />
growth and a better standard of living amld better educat;. c-n.<br />
These are the tests that we'll face and these are the questions<br />
that we'll have to answer.<br />
Q ( Inaudible)<br />
PM Of course I've regretted it. But, of course, part<br />
of it had to be expected because of the fall-off there<br />
had been in international trade. I regret I'm not fully<br />
briefed on this question, but I do know that my Minister<br />
for W~ atiocnal ! Development was -,--illing to live all the<br />
assistance that he was able to give.<br />
Q The elections, Prime Minister is there anything<br />
you could indicate that will show how your Party will<br />
tackle the election? in the next few months<br />
PM No, there isn't because I think you can go too<br />
soon, just like a horse that jumps over the barrier<br />
before the barriers have gone up, and is apt to get<br />
his mouth caught in the strands. I believe, certainly,<br />
that the Labor Party has gone off twice already<br />
and what more it's got to say, I don't know, and I<br />
believe people are rapidly losing confidence in them.<br />
So let them go on this way. The more they do it, the<br />
happier I'll be. What we are doing is acting. We will<br />
keep on acting When we make our decisions we will let<br />
the Australian people know what they are. And then when<br />
we feel the time is right to start animouncing policy for<br />
an election, we'll do so. But I can assure you of this.<br />
We won't hold any of decisions pending a policy speech.<br />
We'll make them as and when we make them.<br />
Q Could I ask whether Mr Chipp's call for a multiracial<br />
society in 1980 is at all reconcilable with<br />
the stipulation for true precautions on the volume and<br />
type of migration </p>
<p>~~ bs<br />
PM THis is our policy, as I have stated it in the<br />
statement. And it is the one that will be applied<br />
by my Government. Mr Chipp has stated that he agrees<br />
with that wholeheartedly and I know he does.<br />
Q Sir, have you given any consideration at this<br />
to the export of natural gas, from the North West<br />
PM I haven't come into this question of the export<br />
of natural gas. I've looked at it on a very broad<br />
plane. I've looked at the proposals associated with<br />
the production and export of natural gac;, but I can't<br />
explain it so far as it applies in a specific way to<br />
Western Australia.<br />
Q Mr McMahon have you set a date for the election<br />
yet<br />
PM No, no.<br />
On the way over, just before I cam here, I thought<br />
I'd get a question on Garden Island. And I asked my<br />
colleague, the Mini*, ster for the Navy, whether we could<br />
have some good news for you about what we could do.<br />
Q Prime Minister, Garden 7S land has been much in the<br />
minds of West Australians over the past few years. How<br />
much land will people be allowed to enter when the<br />
Naval Base is completed Can you tell us if anything<br />
more has been decided<br />
PM WEll, I've personally taken a very deep interest<br />
in Garden Island because I knew that the local people here,<br />
or a large number of them, particularly the yachting<br />
experts, wanted to have continued access to Garden<br />
Island. So I cave instructions to the Navy that they<br />
ought to begin to be as generous as they possibly could.<br />
We had the Commonwealth Public Works Committee examining<br />
-the problem, and they will shortly be submitting a<br />
report to us. And I also got the Minister for the Navy<br />
himself who became directly involved, and we have<br />
decided in the last few days, without actually moving<br />
to a final decision to increase the size of the coastline<br />
that could be used, from seven to ten miles out of the<br />
total fourteen miles. And we've also decided to increase<br />
the acreage that could be used by civilians under the<br />
control of the Navy from 1,250 acres to 1,800 acres.<br />
In other words, we've taken another step forward<br />
and I believe this will meet with a great deal of<br />
satisfaction from the people of Perth.<br />
Q On the general question of defence, and in relation<br />
particularly to Western Australia, we've seen the<br />
planning for Learmonth, the air base, and now the<br />
planning for H. M. A. S. Stirling at Garden Island. Has<br />
there been any advance on the pos 3ibility of an Army<br />
Base in Western Australia </p>
<p>c4 -7<br />
PM As well as the two points you've mentioned, we<br />
do, of course, carry out maritime surveillance f4 e4*<br />
Western Austral~ ia, and we also have exercises, and<br />
have recently had one exercise with the United Kingdom<br />
Government fleet, part of the United Kingdom Government<br />
fleet, in Western Australian waters.<br />
As to establishing an Army Base here, the<br />
decision has not yet been made. But what I can say<br />
is that we have not ruled out establishing an Army<br />
Base in Western Austra'!. ia<br />
Q ( Inaudible)<br />
PM Mr Chipp referred to a multi-racial society.<br />
You are referring to a more homogeneous society; is<br />
there<br />
PM Essentially homogeneous society with the<br />
emphasis on homogeneous, and Mr Chipp falls in with<br />
that policy omple_ E6ly. He has no difference of<br />
opinion , cth me nor with the Government.<br />
Q Do you envisage any increase in the number of<br />
non-European migrants in this country<br />
PM No, but I'm looking at policy now and not at<br />
the details of that policy. If you wanted to ask me<br />
if there was any contemplated increase relating to<br />
the 1973 year, it's too early to make any forecast<br />
at the moment, but I don't anticipate any.<br />
Q Do you think there's any racism in Australia<br />
PM I don't think there is and I've made in abundantly<br />
clear that I DON'T like racism. And I do believe<br />
in having a-homogeneous society, and I don't believe<br />
in introducing elements that can cause us problems in<br />
the future. So let me answer it in two ways.<br />
One, I believe, and Australians I beltc;:,-e<br />
go along with me; we want one nation and one people.<br />
So we want people who can integrate, and fairly<br />
quickly. Two, it couldn't be racist because we do allow<br />
u * p to 9,000 non-Europeans, or people of partial non-<br />
European descent. If you have a policy like that, you<br />
couldn't be racist. But we are selective. We don't<br />
want to create little enclaves.<br />
Q Well why do you think there was such a furore<br />
over Mr Chipp's statement<br />
PM I'm not going to answer why there was such a<br />
furore. I'm telling you what our policy is, and I've<br />
explained it twice already today.<br />
Q You were reported at being angry at Mr Chipp's<br />
statement originally ./ 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
P14 Well, I'm not going to answer to wha. t people<br />
think I am without asking me. Nobody asked me<br />
whether I was annoyed or not.<br />
Q Is it true that non-European migrants do not<br />
get the same treatment as European or white migrants<br />
to this country for example in such things as hostels<br />
PM I am not the Minister for Migration, but what I<br />
can say is that of course in terms of assisted migration,<br />
we only give assisted passages to those we need and those<br />
we want. So that we have to be very selective about it.<br />
If we feel we don't have a real need-for them, we don't<br />
provide assisted passages.<br />
Q So you don't give assisted passages to non-<br />
Europeans<br />
PM No.<br />
Q Do you contemplate doing this at all<br />
PM No.<br />
Q Mr Snedden, the Treasurer, today made mention<br />
of the national policy on foreign investment and made<br />
references to tile Victorian thing Do you intend<br />
to take action against the Victorian Government's<br />
attitude towards the takeover bids Ne,<br />
PM My only answer to this I personally, and my<br />
Government, never act hastily when we don't know what<br />
the consequences are likely to be. In Government, where<br />
it affects the long-term interests of the Australian<br />
people, we don't make hasty judgments. So, I've stated<br />
and Mr Snedden with confirm this, we are both of a<br />
single mincq, that what we have done is to ask the<br />
Treasury to prepare papers relating to overseas capital<br />
inflow into this country. And that will involve the<br />
capacity of overseas concerns to take over or to control<br />
Australian corporations.<br />
Q Is there any intention.........<br />
PM So that paper will ) 5e coming up before us. At<br />
the same time we will be considering papers on<br />
restricted practices and that will involve the same<br />
conditions. In other words we will give very thorough<br />
consideration to the problem of the ownership or control<br />
of Australian industries. Ourattitude is a clear one.<br />
We want maximum Australian ownership. We want, equall~ y<br />
importantly, Australian management. We want Australian<br />
technocrats to be able to join in and assure the<br />
development of this country. And above all, we want<br />
to do all these things in the interests of Australia.<br />
We want a growing economy, we want full employment, and<br />
we want policies that will ensure that the Australian<br />
people are entitled to and will in fact, increase their<br />
standards of living. That's our poli-* cy, and whatever<br />
we do, it will be directed toward achieving those<br />
objectives. / 13 </p>
<p>13<br />
Q Do you approve of the Victorian Government's moves<br />
to control the takeover bid by I. T. T. and T. N. T.<br />
PM That is an exceptional case. I stated our policy<br />
quite clearly, and it &amp;-as this. WE would not have<br />
permitted overseas corporations to have taken over or<br />
to obtain control of Ansett. We would not have permitted<br />
it. We would have protected our own securities. Now<br />
Sir Henry has intervened as he has a legal right to do,<br />
and a constitutional right, and for the moment, I have<br />
not come to any final conclusion about it so I can say<br />
no more. </p>
<p>pp ' q<br />
A Segment from Prime Minister's Press Conference, BUNBURY. W. A.<br />
6 MAY 1972<br />
Q Could we just have confirmation In a Conference today<br />
one of the motions that was passed was that the Commonwealth<br />
Development Bank, the Rural Reconstruction Scheme, and the<br />
Marginal Dairy Farmers Scheme be controlled by one existing<br />
body and to delete all others<br />
PM I have long thought that we needed to consider the<br />
desirability of having a national rural bank that would<br />
cover a wide area of operation. And this proposal, this<br />
idea is being examined very very carefully, by the<br />
Treasury OFFICIALS and they will look at it in the widest<br />
context. I can't go any further than to say that I like<br />
the idea. I do not know whether or not it is administratively<br />
sound, but at least we are investigating it.<br />
The only other comment I can make about this is that<br />
frankly we have so many matters that we have to give<br />
consideration to these days, more than I've ever known<br />
in the whole time I've been in political life, that when<br />
we'll get around to making a decision on this matter is<br />
in the lap of the Gods. But I'll do my best to see that<br />
it's pursued, and that we try and get a decision on it<br />
as quickly as we can. </p>
