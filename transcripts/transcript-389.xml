JR'W SOUTH JILES INTRA-STTU ARLINES<br />
Statement y the rii me Minister, the Rt. 1on. R. G. Menzies<br />
I have written to iMr. Heffron, the Premier of New<br />
South Jales, suggesting to him that having regard to the<br />
important details that have to be rorked out bet. reen the<br />
Commonwealth and New South ; ales in relation to the country air<br />
routes in that State, there should be a deferment of operative<br />
decisions until after the Federal Election. There are two very<br />
good reasons for this.<br />
The first is that, as has been pointed out by Mr.<br />
Borthwick, who made a special enquiry on behalf of the New<br />
South iales Government, the-e are practical difficulties<br />
associated with the p-tting into operation of the plan<br />
recommended by him e. g. fare anomalies, provision of<br />
additional aircraft capacity, payment of appropriate<br />
Commonwealth subsidies, redundancy of staff, etc. Mr. Borthwick<br />
pointed out that ' concurrence and assistance" of the<br />
Commonwealth would be necessary to carry out effectively any<br />
plan adopted by the New South ! ales Government. The<br />
Commonwealth aviation advisers, in the very limited time they<br />
have had, feel that the proposed reallocation of air services in<br />
New South . ales could result in some cases in fare increases, in<br />
the substitution of DC3 aircraft for Fokker Friendships on some<br />
routes, in some possible redundancy in some classes of airline<br />
staff, in requests for increases in subsidy, and quite posibly,<br />
though perhaps temporarily, a curtailment or cessation of<br />
services to certain rural centres in New South Jales. These<br />
are all important matters which I have quite frankly told Mr.<br />
-effron deserve discussion between us before licences are<br />
actually issued. I have no reason to doubt that Mr. Heffron<br />
will see the force of these views.<br />
Second, I always try to adhere to what I believe to<br />
be the sound constitutional rule of practice that, when a<br />
Parliament is dissolved, major decisions should not thereafter<br />
be made by the Government until after the elections. This is a<br />
sound principle, for the arrangements made by the out-going<br />
Government, after the dissolution of Parliament, might, in the<br />
event of the defeat of that Government, prove to be completely<br />
unsatisfactory to the new Government. As nobody can reasonably<br />
say that the matters which arise for discussion between New<br />
South Jales and the Commonwealth in relation to these airlines<br />
are not important and don't give rise to any elements of policy,<br />
I am hoping that Mr. Heffron will agree to my suggestion of<br />
deferment. The problems that have arisen are much more likely<br />
to be solved by sensible and detailed discussion between the<br />
aviation authorities and the airline operators than by public<br />
hostilities. Having said this I want to say something about the<br />
position of the two country airlines in New South -ales. I<br />
understand that it is said in some quarters that the existence<br />
of East-Jest Airlines is threatened. It is certainly not<br />
threatened by my Government. . ie want to have the New South<br />
Tales intra-State airlines system maintained on a sound and<br />
efficient basis with East-West airlines playing its part in a<br />
sound and efficient system. . e believe that the prevailing<br />
interest in this matter of air services is the interest of<br />
country people themselves. le are anxious that that interest<br />
should be studied and given the greatest possible consideration. </p>
<p>a 2,<br />
The East-Jest Company, which has an honourable record of service<br />
to a number of country districts can be assured that the<br />
Commonwealth Government is in no way trying to render it<br />
ineffective or precarious. On the contrary, re would like to<br />
see it continue in a healthy state just as we vant the pecple<br />
in the country areas served by Airlines of New South 4ales to<br />
continue to have an effective service.<br />
h y Government has in fact and under the present<br />
Minister for Civil Aviation demonstrated its good faith in these<br />
matters. It introduced the system of suOsidy from uhich both<br />
last-Jest Airlines and Airlines of New South jales have<br />
substantially benefitted. It assisted East-lest Airlines to<br />
secure the bulk of the fleet of aircraft which it now employs.<br />
Spaking generally for the moment, and not just in<br />
relation to New South ales, the fact is that the Commonwealth<br />
has throughout these years given great practical assistance in<br />
order to make it possibe for country areas to have the effeptive<br />
and much needed air services which are now in existence, not<br />
least in the more remote areas. Services have been established,<br />
for instance, in lestern Australia, the Northern Territory,<br />
. estern Queensland, to Lord Howe island and the Sass Strait<br />
Islands. The services in these pl. ces Lnd elsewThere are<br />
supported in direct fashion by subsidy payments totalling<br />
Å 500,000 annually. But, over and above that, there have been<br />
many millions of pounds spent in providing airports in country<br />
areas, providing other airways facilities, extending generous<br />
financial help to the owners of country airports, and assisting<br />
in appropriate cases the introduction of turbine-powered aircraft<br />
such as the Fokker Friendship.<br />
Jhatever comes or goes in the present argument in New<br />
South ales, Ye have no intention to abandon subsidy arrangements<br />
for either airline. All that we have said, and very properly, 7s<br />
that there should be no assumption that additional routes would<br />
automatically carry fixed entitlements to additional subsidy.<br />
The question of subsidy must always be most carefully consideied<br />
for it involves the application of public funds. However we are<br />
not contemplating any proposal that the Cornmonwoalth should, in<br />
respect of these two airlines, pay in total less subsidy than in<br />
the past. To lend point to this, I now state that the short<br />
period of deferment which I have suggested to Mr. Heffron, would<br />
not hurt anybody because the Commonwealth would, in the meantime,<br />
accept a liability to pay subsidy to each airline at the current<br />
1960/ 61 rates. I hope that these reasonable proposals will be acceptAd<br />
There is no profit in public disputes on such matters but there<br />
is great importance to be attached to the proper interests of all<br />
those citizens who are now served by each of the two airlines.<br />
