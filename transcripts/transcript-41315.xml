    <subjects>Same-sex marriage survey</subjects>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES: </strong></p>
<p>That is a nation breathing a sigh of relief. Most of the people, the majority of the nation, is breathing a sigh of relief. I believe you were one of the people who was breathing a sigh of relief – is that right Mr Turnbull?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. This is such a great day. It’s such a joyful day.</p>
<p>You know, the overwhelming majority of Australians have reached out and they’ve put their arms around same-sex couples and said, “We love you; we respect you; your relationships are equal to everybody else’s; you will be able to call your relationship, your committed relationship, a marriage just as men and women have been doing forever”.</p>
<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES: </strong></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>So it’s a huge social change and what a great way of doing it. You know, I went to the election, I said, “Everyone should have their say”. We gave everyone the chance of having a say. 80 per cent took up that opportunity and as you just said, just under 62 per cent voted ‘yes’, as did Lucy and I. So we are delighted.</p>
<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES:</strong></p>
<p>As did me, my family, my children are delighted. I’ve been sent a photo of them with their equality cupcakes that they are about to devour. My 77-year old mother, she voted ‘yes’ from a country town of Warrnambool where she lives. Look, not everyone, Malcolm – I have to say this because we just had Nath Valvo, a very funny comedian in here, he’s had to leave – but he said that he was still, there are still people upset that the vote had to happen. You’ve got to acknowledge there is still people upset about that?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>But what a great affirmation. I mean, if you think about it, if you’re a young person, you’re gay, you’re worried about how you’re being perceived perhaps by your parents, perhaps by some of your friends – this is an affirmation of you, of your equality. It’s an affirmation of respect for you, not just from Parliament but from 62 per cent, overwhelming majority of the Australian nation. This is a big deal. This is a historic day.</p>
<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES: </strong></p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>It’s a day when Australians have had their say – very democratic – they’ve had their say and a vast majority have said, “You know, we respect you, we’re the country of the fair go, you’re entitled to call your relationship a marriage and the law to recognise it as such”.</p>
<p>So this was ‘yes’ for equal marriage, for marriage equality; it was ‘yes’ for fairness; ‘yes’ for commitment; ‘yes’ for love.</p>
<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES: </strong></p>
<p>It’s an overwhelming majority. There is no doubt about that.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Yeah, it’s huge.</p>
<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES: </strong></p>
<p>The numbers do not lie so we’re happy and you’ve said this will get passed through Parliament before the end of this year? That’s a guarantee?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>You know, it’s a free vote, so strictly speaking I can’t guarantee it, but – fascinating though the subject is – I’m absolutely sure that the Members of Parliament won’t want to keep talking about it until Christmas Eve.</p>
<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES: </strong></p>
<p>No, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>So I’m highly confident it’ll be dealt with before Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES: </strong></p>
<p>We had Bill Shorten in here earlier and he said that he thinks 92 or 95 per cent of Labor members will vote this through. Have you got any idea on your side how many, what percentage will be voting ‘yes’?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well the overwhelming majority of members on both sides, all sides, will respect the wishes of the people. I mean, of the electorates – you know, just under 90 per cent of all federal electorates voted ‘yes’ and of the electorates that voted ‘no’, most of them were actually Labor electorates. Most of them in fact were in Western Sydney. So you know, people always say regional Australia is much more conservative than the cities…</p>
<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES: </strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that was surprising. That was surprising.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that’s right. But I mean there was only one National Party electorate for example that voted ‘no’.</p>
<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES: </strong></p>
<p>Yeah, do we think that – I suppose – is it religious, do you think? Do you think those electorates may be more religiously focused do you think? Do you?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well look Hughesy, I haven’t drilled down into it, I’m just thrilled that we’ve had such a strong participation.</p>
<p>You know, let’s just reflect on this: this was a voluntary vote; it’s a postal vote. 80 per cent of the people – there were 16 million ballots sent out – 80 per cent voted. Now in a federal election, when you’re determining who is going to govern Australia for the next three years and its compulsory and they fine you if you don’t vote…</p>
<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES: </strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>…You only get a 90 per cent participation. So this was amazing.</p>
<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES: </strong></p>
<p>Yes, it’s huge. Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>It shows you how much people wanted to have their say.</p>
<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES: </strong></p>
<p>And the fact is, people don’t ever post letters any more. So for them, a lot of them, for the first time in their lives to find a postbox and get involved is, it’s a brilliant moment.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, it is.</p>
<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES: </strong></p>
<p>The next brilliant moment is when it passes through. Do you have any friends of yours who are going to get married Malcolm?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Oh, stacks – absolutely stacks who will get married. Lucy and I have been asked to come to so many weddings, you know, next year after this goes through the Parliament. But look, this is a great moment in our history. A unique political moment.</p>
<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES: </strong></p>
<p>Malcolm, it is. Could you possibly get your celebrant’s licence? Is it possible? That would be a great moment.</p>
<p>[Laughter]</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>I think I’ve got enough to do with my day job.</p>
<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES: </strong></p>
<p>Alright, yeah you do.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES: </strong></p>
<p>Good luck mate, well done. Well done.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Good on you Hughesy.</p>
<p><strong>DAVE HUGHES: </strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull.</p>
