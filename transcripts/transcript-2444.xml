YOUNG LIBERALS' RALLY<br />
MET-L BOUR NE 12 UjLY 1971<br />
Ãµ Sechby the Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
-Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
I want to talk to you tonight about China the People's Republic of China.<br />
I do so for two reasons.<br />
First, because that country will be of tremendous significance in our<br />
region for as far ahead as we can see and therefore it should properly engage the close<br />
attention of Liberals. And then because I feel it is time to expose the shams and the absurdities<br />
surrounding Mr. Whitlam's excursion into " instant coffee" diplomacy. You will have<br />
been reading thousands of words about his visit to China and his talks with Chou En-Lai.<br />
He has spelt out a policy which is dangerous for Australia. I doubt if I<br />
have ever read such a damaging and irresponsible series of declarations by any political<br />
leader in all my time in politics in Australia.<br />
. The Whitlam Policy as it stands would isolate Australia from our friends<br />
and allies not only in South-East Asia and the Pacific but in other parts of the Western<br />
world as well. This policy must be disowned by us. We must not become pawns of the<br />
giant communist power in our region.<br />
The Labor mission to China began, of course, as an ingenuous exercise<br />
by the Australian Labor Party, instigated by Mr. Mick Young, which wanted to play<br />
Party politics with wheat sales to China. It was turned instantly and skilfully into an<br />
international propaganda exercise by the Chinese Premier, Chou En-Lai, who committed<br />
the Labor Leader to a position Australia could never accept and from which Mr. Whitlam<br />
himself cannot withdraw.<br />
In no time at all, Chou En-Lai had Mr. Whitlam on a hook and he played<br />
him as a fisherman plays a trout. It was done in public and in a way that guaranteed a<br />
world-wide coverage. There are, of course, certain rules of courtesy which are observed by<br />
visitors to a foreign country. Mr. Whitlam went far beyond what was necessary in<br />
responding to his hosts when sensitive matters were raised. In the process he managed<br />
to insult just about most of our friends and allies in Asia and the Pacific.<br />
Chou En-Lai set out to denigrate the United States and Japan the first<br />
being our greatest ally in Asia and the Pacific and the other being our best customer<br />
in trade. He even told Mr. Nixon how to run his Administration or get thrown out.<br />
What an impertinence to the Leader of the United States., and it is not likely to be<br />
forgotten by the American Administration. </p>
<p>Mr. Whitlam just stopped short of denouncing the ANZUS Pact, presumably<br />
because he wants the benefits without sharing any of the responsibilities.<br />
Chou En-Lai raised the fear of a revival of Japanese militarism when<br />
there is no evidence to support that fear.<br />
Mr. Whitlam accepted Chou En-Lai's statement about Japanese militarism<br />
without question. And yet only a few months ago he was telling the Australian Parliament<br />
that Japan had a diplomatic role in Asia and that we, in Australia, were well placed to<br />
make an effort to have Japan become the West's bridge with China.<br />
One voice at home, a different voice abroad. This is a typical sample of<br />
his inconsistency. I remind you, Ladies and Gentlemen, that only a few days ago the<br />
American Administration reaffirmed that nuclear protection for Japan would be available<br />
from the United States if the need arose. This statement was a response to reports<br />
that the Japanese would have to develop a defensive nuclear weapon by 1980.<br />
It is obvious that Mr. Whitlam didn't know the facts and fell easily for a<br />
very, very clever piece of propaganda.<br />
He spoke contemptuously of the Soviet Union, with whom my Government<br />
is slowly building bridges towards a better understanding beneficial to us. He described<br />
the termination of the Sino-Soviet friendship Treaty as an " abominable" act by the<br />
Soviet Union. He sneered at Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines and Cambodia all<br />
countries with whom Australia has trade and friendly relations. He said Thailand and<br />
the Philippines were " trying desperately to insinuate themselves" into China's good<br />
graces. What a presumption to talk about third Governments in this way, and on<br />
what grounds. And so he went on playing his wild diplomatic game knocking our friends<br />
one by one until he was virtually alone in Asia and the Pacific except for the communists.<br />
The things he did not mention cried out for notice. He ignored recent<br />
history, and the fact of China's involvement in military action on her frontier with<br />
LIndia, the, Korean War and in Tibet.<br />
He had nothing to say about China's part ini wars of national liberation<br />
in Vietnam, Thailand and Laos. He did not ask what the roads China was building into<br />
Northern Laos were for. One will run East to Vietnam and the other towards North-<br />
Eastern Thailand. He did not make a plea for Mr. Chou to use his good offices to secure<br />
an honourable peace in Vietnam.<br />
Not only did he fail to do that but he allowed himself to be put forward as<br />
a kind of intermediary and spokesman for the latest manoeuvres of North Vietnam and<br />
China at the Paris peace talks. ./ 3 </p>
<p>He cabled me professing to have confidential information from the highest<br />
source that the latest communist peace proposals were intended to " differ in kind and<br />
extent from all previous proposals."<br />
Without the slightest knowledge of what the other side of the picture was<br />
-because he was travelling in a closed society, he said " 1 am convinced that America<br />
is being given an honourable opportunity for early disengagement.<br />
Now, this " confidential information" has already been published in the<br />
" People's Daily" the official newspaper in Peking and references -in a similar vein are<br />
in the transcript of Mr. Chou's public interview with Mr. Whitlam.<br />
He must have known that the United States haS, been trying to initiate<br />
private talks in Paris to ascertain the North Vietnam ese intentions, but the communist<br />
negotiators there keep evading the opportunity to seriously discuss any proposals.<br />
This is history. I told him by cable that the proper place for the Chinese to press their case<br />
was in Paris. I have no doubt that once again Mr. Whitlam has let hinself get caught up<br />
on a stunt. I can only think that he is doing this for such cheap notoriety as it may<br />
bring him. It does harm both to Australia and the cause of peace in Vietnam.<br />
I find it incredible that at a time when Australian soldiers are still engaged<br />
in South Vietnam, the Leader of the Labor Party is becoming a spokesman for those<br />
against whom we are fighting.<br />
Now let us look for a moment at the question of Taiwan, because this is<br />
the crux of the matter so far as Mr. Whitlam's recognition plans are concerned.<br />
He had declared bluntly that a Labor Govern ment would recognise the<br />
People's Republic on the lines of the Canadian formula. He goes further. He would take<br />
the initiative in severing relations with Taiwan and he would visit Peking as " the sole<br />
capital of China". By accepting Peking as the sole capital he is abandoning Taiwan, whatever<br />
he says about the Canadian formula.<br />
Mr. Whitlam says Mr. Chou made no reference to Taiwan in their public<br />
discussions. But the transcript of those discussions which is freely available in Australia<br />
and has been published in several newspapers shows that MrI. Chou did in fact do so,<br />
and he described the island as China's " province of Taiwan"<br />
Mr. Whitlam has made his choice. Without morality, without responsiility<br />
he would go " all the way" with one and dump the other. He would dump fourteen million<br />
people on Taiwan. Now, Mr. Chairman, let me tell you where the Government stands on<br />
China with the People's Republic on the one hand arid Taiwan on the other. </p>
<p>As you know, we are seeking a dialogue with the People's Republic Mil<br />
call it China for convenience sake with the long-term object of establishing normal<br />
diplomatic relationships. This was not a new or recent idea. It was the outcome of a study begun<br />
long before those ping pong games were played. We have already had diplomatic<br />
contact with China but I cannot yet report any progress. But we are not surprised.<br />
Progress will be slow and we must be patient. We are acting cautiously and privately<br />
as is the way with proper diplomacy and I hope the Chinese will react in the same way<br />
if they really want to get down to a solution of the problem.<br />
What an unpleasing spectacle Mr. Whitlam's public diplomacy makes. A<br />
Government engaged in diplomatic activity in sensitive areas of international relations<br />
cannot perform in public. It has to put the trappings of propaganda aside and get down to<br />
realities. That is what we are doing with China.<br />
The first major movement in China's bid to enter the community of nations,<br />
so far as Australia is concerned, is likely to be her admission to the United Nations and<br />
the security council. If it doesn't take place this year, it will almost certainly take<br />
place next year. We have said that Australia is not opposed to this. It would be reasonable<br />
to accept this as a recognition of a fact of life of the Chinese Government's established<br />
authority. But there are other considerations when we come to the next stage<br />
recognition. That may be a long way off but we are prepared to work towards it if we<br />
get any co-operation from China as we go.<br />
But we are not prepared to do so at any cost to our own country. Our own<br />
vital interests will come first.<br />
In all we are doing, we are naturally consulting with our allies and our<br />
friends, particularly with the United States and Japan.<br />
We are morally bound to consider the position of Taiwan. It would be our<br />
hope that Taiwan would be able to and ready to retain membership of the United Nations<br />
when China is admitted. We would also want to see the separate rights of the people of<br />
Taiwan protected. We are consulting with them and with our friends on this, too.<br />
That, in short, is the position. I believe it is the only honourable course<br />
that Australia can take. The judgments we make must be long considered and soberly<br />
made. Now, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Whitlam's undisciplined foray into a league that<br />
is far too big for him began with wheat. So let me say something briefly on this point,<br />
and on the relationship we already have with the People's Republic.<br />
Wheat has been one part only of our trade with China, and let it be<br />
remembered, we sell a lot of wheat to places other than China. e a </p>
<p>I a There is no discrimination against China in our tariff and import policies.<br />
Although China is not a member of GATT, we have applied GATT rules against nondiscrimination<br />
to China and we will continue to do so. We give her, like other countries,<br />
most favoured nation treatment.<br />
Furthermore, we have no barriers to visitors from the People's Republic.<br />
They can come like any others and are subj ect only to those normal procedures which<br />
apply to visitors from any country.<br />
On its part, China usually exercises the strictest control over visitors<br />
from here. Now about wheat in particular. The intervention of the Labor Party in<br />
the wheat question has not helped matters at all. The Labor delegation has played the<br />
Chinese game by introducing politics into wheat. We think our best interests will be<br />
served by leaving it to the Wheat Board and keeping it out of politics.<br />
If you read the recent Chinese communique on the subject carefully<br />
you will see they have not given any guarantees for future purchases of Canadian wheat.<br />
They say, in effect, they will continue to treat Canada in the future as they have treated<br />
her in the past that is to consider her first as a source.<br />
That's not a new position. It applied before Canada decided to recognise.<br />
It is not even a decision to buy. And what's more, even if China were applying a little<br />
blackmail there are other markets for our wheat right now.<br />
Now, Ladies and Gentlemen, that is the position as the Government sees<br />
it. The Labor Party is putting politics into wheat at a time when our rural industries<br />
need help, not hindrance. Mr. Whitlam is putting personal notoriety before the national interest.<br />
He is showing slickness that even his critics would not have believed of him.<br />
He has made sweeping judgments " on the voices" as it were, the voices<br />
of skilled propagandists all on one side of the fence.<br />
It would be laughable if it were not tragic. It would be pathetic if it were<br />
-not so dangerous. I ask you to see this as a sample of the kind of diplomacy the Labor<br />
Party would exercise if ever it came to power. Let this be our incentive to see that it<br />
never does. </p>
