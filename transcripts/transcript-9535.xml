TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH MINISTERS COLLINS AND<br />
FAULKNER, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, MARCH 30 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: As most of the people in this room are very well aware, we have had a<br />
somewhat seminal debate in Australia about the twin objectives of<br />
being able to protect those areas of native forest and wilderness that<br />
are pertinent to the heritage of Australians, and the need to maintain<br />
and develop further, a sustainable wood products industry. This<br />
debate, of course, has raged in Australia for a very long period of time,<br />
and while the Commonwealth Government doesn't operate the forests,<br />
they are operated by the States. The community looks to the<br />
Commonwealth for leadership, to see that these great national assets<br />
are protected, or at least define the basis in policy upon which we can<br />
arrive at a system where we can seek both to protect them and at the<br />
same time, allow a wood products industry to prosper. Today the<br />
Cabinet met to consider a strategy for the long-term future of<br />
Australia's native forests and its industry, and agreed to a number of<br />
measures I suppose prime amongst them was to ensure that by the<br />
year 2000, Australia will have a system of reserves comprehensively<br />
representing all forest types, while at the same time, a diverse wood<br />
products industry. As the first step in this and this is against the<br />
backdrop, of course, of the National Forest Policy Statement, and the<br />
commitment of States to it the first step in this is a discussion paper<br />
which will be released by the Government, detailing the<br />
Commonwealth's position for a future forest reserve system. The aim<br />
will be to stimulate public comment on the appropriate criteria, and<br />
during the six-week consultation phase, the Commonwealth will be<br />
working with State and Territory governments to develop nationally<br />
agreed criteria for application in the development in Regional Forest<br />
Agreements for more regions. Now, we think that with the co-operation<br />
of the States, the Commonwealth can use these criteria to undertake a<br />
preliminary reserve analysis to set aside areas pending completion of<br />
Regional Forest Agreements. And this should enable the 1996<br />
woodchip export licences to be issued on a regional rather than a<br />
coupe-by-coupe basis, which of course you will know is a change from<br />
that which we have had. 0 1 201 </p>
<p>So our strategy will be to make sure that the Government's policy of<br />
protecting high conservation value forests, in perpetuity, will not be<br />
compromised while Regional Forest Agreements are being developed,<br />
and industry will enjoy more certainty about the availability of<br />
resources. These Regional Forest Agreements will identify areas for<br />
incorporation in the National Reserve System, and adequately and<br />
comprehensively represent all forest types and areas which may be<br />
harvested on a strict basis of ecological sustainability. And we hope<br />
that we will be able to undertake over the next ten weeks consultations<br />
with a view to finalising this document by the middle of the year. Now,<br />
can I also say that Cabinet today has also agreed to recommend to the<br />
Minister for Resources that he ask woodchip companies to refrain from<br />
sourcing woodchips from 264 coupes that Cabinet believes might be<br />
required for a future reserve system, and that were originally proposed<br />
for the States in 1995.<br />
Now, I will go to those in a moment, but let me take you through quickly<br />
for our own memory a little bit of mathematics: originally the<br />
Commonwealth set aside for investigation as to the representativeness<br />
or otherwise, 509 coupes. During the course of that setting aside, 110<br />
coupes were released for logging on two lots there were 57 and 53.<br />
This left 399: of the 399, 37 have been withdrawn but the states,<br />
because they no longer want to log in those areas for woodchips,<br />
which left 362, and of that 362, the Commonwealth is seeking or the<br />
Cabinet is seeking with the agreement of the Minister for Resources,<br />
to oblige companies to refrain from sourcing from 264 of those coupes.<br />
So, I will . as a consequence of that change, I will be asking the<br />
States to fully protect all those coupes, including the non-national<br />
estate coupes we set aside pending finalisation of the Regional Forest<br />
Agreements. Now, the Government recognises of course that<br />
requesting companies to stay out of areas proposed by states for<br />
logging will have consequences for the livelihood of some forest<br />
workers. The Government will provide income support under existing<br />
programs for those people. For any self-employed people, the<br />
Government will consider the payment of transitional assistance. And,<br />
of course, local CES offices will be active in ensuring that workers are<br />
made aware of their programs and are eligible to join, and that other<br />
forms of assistance are immediately available to them. The<br />
Government has developed a tailored package of assistance available<br />
immediately for self-employed workers, employees and their families<br />
affected by structural adjustment to the industry. The Forest Industry<br />
Special Assistance Package will provide individuals with access to<br />
training and employment programs under Working Nation, including<br />
the National Training Wage, JobStart and JobSkills, and assist with<br />
relocation and travel costs. And so we will then talk with the States<br />
about a range of projects that may be employed for employment<br />
opportunities, such as plantation and farm forestry etc.<br />
So, perhaps I might return to this theme, and say that what we are<br />
seeking here is to take the view that the best policy for Australia is to </p>
<p>have both of these things: one, a policy that protects forever the<br />
unique and irreplaceable nature of our forests, and develop the<br />
profitable and sustainable forest industry. Now we think there is a<br />
point of computability here, and mutually reinforcing quality to that. It<br />
is possible that Australia can develop a model industry, and in the<br />
development of representative reserve systems, do so with the<br />
injunction to think global and act local. Because I think it is possible<br />
for Australia, at this juncture where we have had this debate running<br />
now for so many years, it will get back to the development of these<br />
Regional Forest Agreements around the comprehension of the paper<br />
the discussion paper we are now to present while in the interim,<br />
keeping those 264 coupes until their qualities can be assessed in<br />
terms of those representative reserve systems. Were we able to reach<br />
that point, Australia would truly have a representative forest system,<br />
where all species are adequately represented. And I think you will<br />
find, also, we are talking there about a broad benchmark roughly of the<br />
order of 15% of the pre-1788 distribution of each forest community,<br />
and that is in terms of representing it in statutory conservation<br />
reserves. So, we are talking here to a very high standard about the<br />
representativeness of any such reserve system, while at the same<br />
time, seeking to move the industry into a position of sustainability and<br />
so we avoid this position of coupe-by-coupe discussions every year,<br />
rather than discussions on a regional basis where we can actually<br />
agree to regions having a capacity to export and not simply us looking<br />
or being obliged to look coupe-by-coupe.<br />
Now, there have been many critics of this process, but you have to<br />
understand that the Commonwealth is not the manager of forests. The<br />
Commonwealth database could only and always depend on the<br />
information given to it by States, forestry authorities and by scientific<br />
analysis and re-analysis of the information which is sent. These are<br />
the things that Nations have to do to move towards that sort of a<br />
system, but let me say it is a far better approach than the approach of<br />
our opponents who believe and this is the belief of the Spokesperson<br />
for the Environment that the Commonwealth shouldn't be using its<br />
external affairs powers, should not be signatory to international treaties<br />
and wouldn't be using the export powers to advance this debate in any<br />
way, shape or form, and where the coalition is taking the view that<br />
even a policy of restraining clear-felling is not one that they should<br />
adopt. This is difficult as it is the only way to move towards this sort<br />
of a system, and let me say clearly, building on, what I think is the very<br />
significant and internationally significant environment record of the<br />
Government over now a long period of time, that it was only ever to be<br />
this Government that would come to terms with our native forests and<br />
the timber being taken from them, in the context of some sustainable<br />
reserve system. And those who have been chortling at the difficulties<br />
of evaluation, should understand that no great endeavour such as this<br />
would ever be easily attained, and it can never, of course, be secured<br />
without there being a systemic approach to forest management in<br />
Australia. So I think that says in the general that which I wish to say.<br />
Could I just say I would like to express my appreciation to my two </p>
<p>colleague Ministers beside me for a long process of consultation and<br />
negotiation and discussion that they have had including, of course,<br />
with the Minister for Resources, and the Minister for Industry, Science<br />
and Technology towards arriving at this position, and I think again<br />
this is what marks out the Government from the Coalition that we have<br />
people of this calibre able to take on these sensitive tasks, who<br />
understand the nuances of them and try to reach at a position that they<br />
can defend. Now, I'm not sure whether either of them wish to<br />
complement my remarks they are very welcome to, and I would invite<br />
Senator Collins should he choose.<br />
BC: I'll just take questions Paul.<br />
JF: I'm happy to take questions.<br />
PM: Well, they are happy to take questions I think we all are.<br />
J: Prime Minister, you have announced 264 coupes which won't be given<br />
approval for woodchip exporting the State governments still have<br />
control over land-use matters in terms of logging how confident are<br />
you that logging won't go on in any of those coupes, or could it be that<br />
logging will go in some of those coupes?<br />
PM: What we are saying is this we have asked the States to protect these<br />
coupes until we go into this broader discussion about representative<br />
reserve systems it has always been a State prerogative to the<br />
Commonwealth export powers have only ever gone as far as<br />
woodchips, and if the States wish to continue to give approval to<br />
logging for saw-log or veneer they are able to do that. This still<br />
remains the position, but I think States do want to get on with the<br />
development of a representative reserve system and I think we are at<br />
the stage where a number of projects which value-add to the pulp and<br />
paper and timber industry in this country are in the offing, but may<br />
never come to fruition without the development of such a system. So I<br />
think States will bear upon, will consider this question. Can I say that<br />
some of these coupes, of course, are in NSW that is to be released for<br />
export woodchipping, and these will be the subject of discussion with<br />
the incoming Carr Labor Government in NSW.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what is your estimate of the employment impact of this<br />
decision?<br />
PM: It varies in certain places, I think we do have a compilation of the<br />
number I don't have it with us. I don't think we can accurately say<br />
that here....<br />
BC: It would be impossible, at this stage can I say to accurately predict<br />
that, but it is clear that there may be some job losses, and that is<br />
acknowledged in the Statement in the sense that this is the<br />
consideration Cabinet has given to what we do about that, but a lot of<br />
that will depend, I have to say, on a fairly intensive period of </p>
<p>discussions we will now have to embark on with the States in terms of<br />
what arrangements can be made to minimise that effect, and there will<br />
be arrangements that can be made in terms of rescheduling where it's<br />
possible and so on. But, I think the important thing to note and I don't<br />
know if you have got them yet but there are two important discussion<br />
papers that are being released here this afternoon. One on the criteria<br />
that will be used to establish reserve systems, and the other on an<br />
industry plan. Now, both of those papers I have to say have been<br />
developed after a very intensive period of consultation. The criteria<br />
paper is an important one that was developed after a high-level<br />
scientific group chaired by the Chief Scientist reported to the<br />
Government, and indeed, the Government has drawn very heavily on<br />
that report, in putting that criteria discussion paper together. And it is<br />
important to understand, I think, just how vital a document that is<br />
because if in negotiations with the States we can achieve that, it will be<br />
a world best in terms of reserve systems there is no question about<br />
that. The International Union of Conservation an Nature which is the<br />
international body that determines World Heritage status has<br />
recommended a 10% reserve system of existing resources. Canada<br />
which is a heavy forest nation has around 13% of its existing<br />
resources in reserves, the United States [ has] around This<br />
recommendation will secure 15% of Australia's original forest resource.<br />
Now the reason that this has happened, is that we are in the unique<br />
position in the sense that we still have 60% of that original resource in<br />
Australia, but that equates to around 25% of the existing forest<br />
resource in aggregate in reserves, which will be world best practice.<br />
J: Prime Minister, you said that this system that you have just outlined<br />
should be removed by 1996, you need the coupe-by-coupe<br />
assessment because there will be regional agreements in place does<br />
that mean in 1995 there will be another coupe-by-coupe assessment,<br />
will we have to go through this process again?<br />
PM: Well, I'm saying that if we are able to advance this process at the<br />
speed I think we would like to, that is, that we are able to detect the<br />
position before we actually get to RFAs, it may be possible to do that.<br />
But again, that would depend on co-operation.<br />
BC: And I might add, as I am sure you are aware, the situation in<br />
respective reserves differs widely across Australia from state to state.<br />
Some states are in far better shape than others.<br />
J: Which states... . of the protection . coupes?<br />
PM: Well, I think you will see that in the broad when we publish information.<br />
But of course, this will be published after the decision by the Minister<br />
for Resources.<br />
BC: The important thing, I think, in that consideration is the same criteria<br />
applied across the board, and that is the central criteria of putting<br />
aside those coupes which the Government considered necessary to </p>
<p>establish a comprehensive, adequate and representative resource<br />
system in Australia. So even though there are regional differences it is<br />
important to note that those regional differences are reflected in the<br />
different states of the reserve systems in those states.<br />
J: Is it true that coupes were in New South Wales and most of the<br />
( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well, I think you will have to wait for the publication of the decision. As<br />
I have already indicated to you that we will be speaking to the New<br />
South Wales Government, so obviously we can't be saying to you what<br />
we might do in New South Wales before:<br />
a. the Minister the for Resources having made a decision and<br />
b. the New South Wales government being consulted.<br />
J: Loggers are threatening to bring their trucks back if they are unhappy<br />
with the result. Are you confident that this is the end of the ramble<br />
over the 1995 logging<br />
PM: Well, I said at the time to representatives of the timber industry that it<br />
is only under this Government will they get the option of having a<br />
sustainable wood forest products industry because I think only we<br />
have the inclination and the capacity to deliver a reserve system and<br />
you have already seen that. You are already seeing the Coalition<br />
spokesperson saying that they believe, he believes that these<br />
questions of land management are exclusively state issues. He is<br />
saying that he opposes any use of treaties or the external affairs<br />
power. Now, if that were to be the position of any Coalition<br />
government, I think it does follow logically that this Government is the<br />
only one capable of delivering any system that resembles<br />
sustainability in forest products.<br />
J: Mr Keating, are you saying that the Minister for Resources hasn't yet<br />
given a tick to these Cabinet decisions?<br />
PM: No, this is the Cabinet's recommendation to him and he will consider<br />
that and he will announce the decision.<br />
BC: Which is the statutory process.<br />
J: How confident are you of state co-operation particularly with<br />
Tasmania?<br />
PM: Well, I think there is a general willingness on the part of the Premier to<br />
sign the Forest Policy Statement and to be in the development of a<br />
regional forest agreement. But there is no doubt a lot of stresses and<br />
strains within the Tasmanian cabinet with the former Premier, Mr Gray<br />
and others seeking to undermine the Premier. But, again, everyone<br />
there must think about the long-run interests of Tasmania and its </p>
<p>forests and its forest's industries. So, I think the nature of these<br />
decisions will encourage the Tasmanian government to be part of the<br />
process.<br />
JF: I think the other thing that ought to be said in relation to state<br />
co-operation is this, that the most recalcitrant state in terms of working<br />
with the other states and the Commonwealth to develop a<br />
comprehensive, adequate and representative resource system has<br />
been New South Wales. From the middle of last year, New South<br />
Wales has refused to even release a discussion paper developed by<br />
the states on the criteria for a comprehensive, adequate and<br />
representative reserve system. We do have a change in government,<br />
of course, in New South Wales, a new Premier and new government<br />
elected on a platform of protection and conservation of areas of high<br />
conservation value of native forests and I think the Commonwealth can<br />
look forward to a lot more co-operation from the New South Wales<br />
government and in the area of the development of the Carr reserve<br />
criteria and comprehensive regional assessments where the<br />
Commonwealth had offered to fund New South Wales on old growth<br />
and wilderness surveys, all the offers of Commonwealth funding and<br />
assistance have been rejected now for a number of years. I think we<br />
can confidently look forward to a very different attitude and a very<br />
positive attitude from the incoming New South Wales government.<br />
J: Prime Minister, do you think... original list is something like 1300?<br />
PM: Well, did the original list have any veracity in terms of<br />
representativeness and in terms of the other qualities that were<br />
ascribed to and I think that the answer to that is no. There has been<br />
the development here of an approach which has been consistently<br />
applied. As Senator Collins has said, where there has been multiple<br />
checking with the states between Commonwealth offices and<br />
Commonwealth agencies and the states. Under that criteria of the<br />
status of these coupes and again, I think one of the outcomes in this is<br />
that those who are going around saying there were 1300 pristine<br />
stands of trees etc, can't defend that position. So therefore, their<br />
credibility must suffer accordingly.<br />
J: Prime Minister, does the credibility of those who go around saying<br />
there were only 86 that should be protected, they must also suffer<br />
given you have now decided<br />
PM: Well, I don't think that the Cabinet took the view that it accepted that<br />
view. It took the view that was not acceptable.<br />
BC: I might add all those lists had the caveat on them, all of them, that they<br />
were all subject to further assessment. That assessment has now<br />
been concluded.<br />
J: Prime Minister, how much... what is the estimated cost of the<br />
assistance package to the timber workers? </p>
<p>BC: No, that hasn't finally been determined but the Cabinet did determine<br />
today that there will be a substantial package of financial support for<br />
the industry and that will be announced in the Budget in terms of the<br />
actual quantum of that amount. But there will be a substantial amount<br />
of support provided by the Government. I might add the central<br />
premise of that industry statement which is available for you and to get<br />
back to your previous question, the central premise of that whole<br />
industry statement is that it is a fact that you will never satisfy the<br />
extremes in both sides of this debate. Of the industry paper, in fact,<br />
says is what we know can be done, that is that we can establish in<br />
Australia a vibrant and a value added timber industry in Australia at<br />
the same time as maintaining the conservation values that must be<br />
protected. It can be done.<br />
J: Prime Minister, when exactly do we find out about this...( inaudible)...?<br />
PM: That will be soon, but there is statutory process here and it is important<br />
that it is followed.<br />
J: How do you propose to deal with the hostility of Green groups on this<br />
and other environment issues in the lead-up to the next election?<br />
PM: Well the Green groups have got to be able to sustain, if one wants to<br />
make an extravagant argument, you have got to be able to sustain an<br />
extravagant position. I think what this evaluation reveals is that the<br />
extravagance of the claims of about 1300 coupes could not be<br />
sustained and was incredible. And also remember that I said in a<br />
statement last year that we will be moving to phase out woodchipping<br />
outside of those places from whence timber comes under an RFA. So,<br />
the first, if you like, substantial steps to changing the nature of this<br />
industry has always in this country come from the Labor Government,<br />
this Labor Government.<br />
And I just might add again, for those who think this is of no account<br />
that in the last year we did reserve these important areas of the<br />
national estate such as Shoalwater Bay and Jervis Bay and we put<br />
$ 24 million in the Budget to buy back the Hole in the Heart of the<br />
Daintree and seek to move down the path of developing a sustainable<br />
basis for the wood products industry in the context of the preservation<br />
of important heritage of native forests and forests of heritage value.<br />
BC: I might add that a central element for the conservation movement in<br />
terms of their interests and Australia's interests is the extension of the<br />
reserve system in Australia and a number of weeks ago, I publicly<br />
supported Tricia Caswell's statement of the ACF about the importance<br />
of this central element in this package and I will just reiterate that the<br />
Government has accepted the advice of Professor Pitman, the Chief<br />
Scientist, and the committee that he gathered around him in terms of<br />
the 15 per cent criterion, I have just indicated with two brief examples, </p>
<p>one Canada and one the United States, the criteria the Government<br />
has adopted is way in front of the word's best in terms of resources.<br />
JE: If I can just make a very brief comment. The number of coupes that<br />
the Prime Minister has indicated that the Cabinet has recommended to<br />
the Minister for Resources is far and away the greatest number that<br />
have ever been protected through an application of the export<br />
woodchip licence renewal process. There is no other number of<br />
coupes in any previous year that is in anyway close to that same order<br />
of magnitude.<br />
J: Why couldn't your Government come up with this number last year?<br />
JF: The key thing that needs to be remembered here is that the National<br />
Forest Policy Statement has as its fundamental conservation element<br />
or objective the establishment of a comprehensive, adequate and<br />
representative reserve system. There has been slow progress on the<br />
establishment of criteria for that reserve system, particularly courtesy<br />
of the New South Wales government, but we have really been able to<br />
progress that over the last few months and that is the key conservation<br />
objective of the NFPS and it is going to deliver as well in my view, the<br />
industry plan real and tangible, long-term environmental benefits. That<br />
has been the very significant move forward that we have seen and I<br />
think it really is a demonstration that we are serious in terms of<br />
delivering on an environmental agenda.<br />
PM: Can I just add to that. You need to understand also, I think, that the<br />
days of locking away areas which, I suppose were never easy but<br />
much easier than development a federal compact between the<br />
Commonwealth and the states on forests, there was a very large<br />
transition from that and the high expectations have generated as<br />
always to the hard tack of a sustainable system. Now this has<br />
happened over the period when Ros Kelly was Minister for the<br />
Environment with a National Forest Policy statement and now with<br />
John Faulkner. But there is always an expectation, particularly<br />
amongst Green groups, that we can be kicking goals on reserves<br />
which has in fact happened when there was a much easier delineation<br />
of important stands of areas of the national estate now. Just the same<br />
as it's fallen to this Government to deal with Aboriginal land rights or<br />
Aboriginal health. It is into the hard areas of change and I think the<br />
co-efficient ( inaudible).., rises when you try and get into a<br />
sustainable system of this variety. And those who seek to easily<br />
criticise Ministers should understand that the degree of difficulty is<br />
very much greater than it has been in the past.<br />
J: Prime Minister, just on the reserves, would you agree that there could<br />
be widely different impacts depending on the region of Australia we<br />
are talking about because of different patterns of land clearing since<br />
white settlement, for example a 15 per cent minimum reserve in<br />
northern New South Wales or parts of northern New South Wales and<br />
Queensland could mean reserving all the remaining forests or where in </p>
<p>Gippsland, for example, where there are large stands of certain types<br />
of forests, it could lead to a big increase in the amount of logging<br />
simply to be kept because it is 15 per cent of a much bigger area of<br />
type of forest?<br />
PM: Well, I think we have just seen a big state plebiscite run on some of<br />
those policies with Bob Carr. He said quite up-front where thinks that<br />
the balance of that argument should go.<br />
JF: Our approach is in Australia, from a Commonwealth Government<br />
perspective with the release of this paper, to see a high-level of<br />
biodiversity conservation. As Bob Collins has said, it is 15 per cent. It<br />
is virtually higher than anywhere else in the world. We are also<br />
developing specific criteria for wilderness and old-growth levels of<br />
reservation and they are very significant steps forward in this particular<br />
debate and obviously will have application as we move through into<br />
the future in further rounds of decisions in relation to the issue of<br />
export woodchip licences.<br />
PM: Can I perhaps conclude on this point that is that the Minister for<br />
Resources will consider the Cabinet's recommendation and make a<br />
decision and that of course will be published. The broad numbers in<br />
that recommendation have been given to you today and I am confident<br />
that if we can get down to the consultation period finished by mid-year<br />
we will have a reasonably firm basis to make decisions for 1996 other<br />
than on a coupe-by-coupe basis which will be important to us. But<br />
perhaps I can conclude on this very last point, of thanking Bob Collins<br />
and John Faulkner for a very large and sustained committed effort to<br />
this very intractable problem and trying to see that in this country we<br />
can do something the rest of the world has not been able quite to do<br />
and to do it well.<br />
ends. </p>
