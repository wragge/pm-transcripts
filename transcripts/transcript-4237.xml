TEXT OF ADDRESS BY PRIME MINISTER AT LOCOMOTIVE NAMING AT<br />
CLYDE INDUSTRIES, SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br />
-I regard it as a great honour to have a new locomotive named<br />
after me, particularly as it is the first of. a new class of<br />
locomotives for A. N. R.<br />
The builders are to be congratulated on the latest example<br />
of their craft.<br />
I understand that locomotives have been named after a number of<br />
former Prime Ministers.<br />
I hesitate to ask what has happened to each of them.<br />
I hope that theoGough Whitlamohas not run off the rails somewhere.<br />
i believe that the " Robert Gordon Menzies" is still running well:<br />
indeed that it completed three million miles on 30 June last.<br />
Clyde of course, are no strangers to the manufacture of locomotives.<br />
Clyde started making steam locomotives at Granville, N. S. W. works<br />
in 1907.<br />
They are certainly one of the leaders in diesel electric<br />
locomotives in Australia. They have delivered about seven<br />
hundred of these locomotives to the various Australian systems.<br />
-Their association with general motors electro-motive division has<br />
ensured that they have kept abreast of world technology aud<br />
developments in the field.<br />
The new locomotive has been selected by A. N. R. as the locomotive<br />
best suited to their needs on the Trans Australian Railway.<br />
The diesel electric locomotive was introduced early to the<br />
Australian scene by men of vision who staked reputations on<br />
these machines while the traditional steam locomotive was still<br />
supreme.<br />
Australia now needs men of even greater vision, to meet the<br />
crisis which all the railway systems are currently facing.<br />
The financial situation of Government railway systems has<br />
deteriorated at very fast rates in the last few years. / 2 </p>
<p>The combined deficits of Government systems rose from $ 62.7 million<br />
in 1969/ 70 to 40. miion19/ 7. This represents over<br />
for every man, woman and child in Australia and about<br />
for every employed Person. This could be-in the region of<br />
$ 600 million within a year or two.<br />
Clearly no Government can continue to bear losses at present<br />
levels, let alone tolerate rapid escalation which is occurring.<br />
Some drastic action is necessary to bring the situation under<br />
control.<br />
Australia is not unique.<br />
Railway systems throughout the world are faced with similar problems.<br />
But this is no reason why we should just wait for the problem<br />
to be solved elsewhere.<br />
The Commonwealth through its own system, will be meeting a<br />
deficit of $ 60.8 million-in 1976/ 77 but most of this is on the<br />
South Australia region ( 37.4 million) and the Tasmanian Region<br />
( 18.2 million)<br />
One of the principal problems is the relationship between salaries<br />
and wages and total revenue earned. In a number of cases I<br />
understand that the wages and salary bill exceeds revenue.<br />
In these circumstances, minor exercises in cost pruning or improvement,<br />
in efficiency will at best have a marginal effect.<br />
Clearly drastic action is necessary to bring costs of providing<br />
the service below revenue earned.<br />
The railways at present are highly labour intensive.<br />
In the face of challenge from other modes of transport the<br />
railways must be prepared to change their traditional methods if<br />
they are to survive.<br />
This will require active consultation with, and the cooperation of,<br />
unions concerned.<br />
The railways should concentrate-on developing those areas where<br />
they can provide the most economic and viable services.<br />
There is a need for a complete reappraisal of the proper role of<br />
railways in the Australian transport system of the latter quarter<br />
of the century.<br />
Some people seem to think that the railway's ills can all be<br />
overcome by giving them more funds.<br />
In this view, the railways have not been able to compete because<br />
they have not had adequate funds to purchase equipment or make<br />
the improvements needed. And I can certainly understand a<br />
manufacturer such as Clyde wishing there were more funds available<br />
I recognise that there are areas whe-,-c railway performance has<br />
been adversely affected by the lack of funds.<br />
However,' there is a more fundamental malaise and unless this is<br />
overcome other improvements can really only have a marginal effect. / 13 </p>
<p>Improvements in the efficiency of the railways may entail the<br />
elimination of some services which are no;-longer effectively<br />
demanded and certainly will mean the introduction of improvements<br />
designed to give the most efficient service.<br />
This involves both technical changes and changes to operational<br />
methods. It will require railway systems to give greater attention to their<br />
management and marketing practices.<br />
In the area of locomotive performance and utilisation, the diesel<br />
locomotive has certainly brought considerable benefits to the<br />
systems.<br />
Almost 3,800 locomotives were required to perform the freight<br />
transport task of 11,900 million tonne kilometres in 1954/ 55.<br />
years later, a fleet of less than 2000 locomotives is used to<br />
perform the freight tas1 k of 29,800 million tonne kilometres, i. e.*<br />
in a 20 year period, the task per locomotive' has multiplied al. most<br />
five-fold.<br />
If similar improvement could be effected in labour productivity,<br />
there would be every reason for confidence.<br />
I have no doubt that the railways will continue as a vital force<br />
contributing to the well-being of the nation. But the present<br />
escalating deficit position cannot continue..<br />
Railway people have shown in the past how they are ready and<br />
willing to rise to a challenge.<br />
I am sure they will in the future.<br />
