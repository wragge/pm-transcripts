FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 25 MARCH 1982<br />
ANNIVERSARY OF THE TREATY OF ROME<br />
Today is the Twenty Fifth Anniversary of the signing of the<br />
Treaty of Rome which brought the European Economic Cormunity<br />
into being on 25 March 1957.<br />
I should like to pay tribute to the vision of a united<br />
Europe which guided the formation of the Community. We in<br />
Australia have a shared history and shared cultural values with<br />
Europe and a common commitment to democracy as partners in the<br />
Western alliance. We continue to attach importance to a strong<br />
and united Europe.<br />
We also look to Europe with its great economic and political<br />
power, for leadership towards outward-looking and constructive<br />
goals and a continuing commitment to liberal, multilateral<br />
trading. This is especially important at a time when the<br />
international trading community is facing difficulties.<br />
It is Australia's hope that the broad vision which led to the<br />
formation of the European Community twenty five years ago will<br />
continue to guide Community policies. </p>
