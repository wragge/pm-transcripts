1. The Prime 1Minister of Australia, Mr. Menzies, and<br />
other Australian Ministers have du, rin-g the last fed days had<br />
discussions with the British Secretary of State for Commonwealth<br />
Relations, Mr. Duncan Sandys.<br />
2. Mr. Sandys explained the various considerationis whiich<br />
had led the Britishi Government to re-examine its attitudo -towards<br />
and realations'nip with the European ., Oconomic Commirunity ( thec<br />
" Common M-arkt"), established by the 21roaty of Rome.<br />

that sheo will become incru-' singly involved in not only theo<br />
economic policies of th--e Cormmuni. ty but ,-1so in matters of an<br />
intternationai -and political kind. Sandys emphasized that<br />
the 3ritisa Governmeont wvas convinced that the obj.. ctivao of closer<br />
unity in Europe wxras in no ra,-y incompatiblo with tema-intenance<br />

accoim. plished at theo cost of d-i'vision within the Connearw.-alth or<br />

But Australian Ministers explained the srious adverse<br />
consequences for Australin producers and for the Australian<br />
balance of payments which ould confront Australif if the<br />
United Kingdom were to enter the Cormlmon Market on a basis which<br />
failed to safoguard Australian trade interests for the future.<br />
6. Mr. Sandys assured the Australian Government that the<br />
British Government fully shared its concern to naint. in the<br />
long-established flow of trade betoecn iheir two countries. If<br />
nogotiations took place, the intention would be to secure special<br />
arrangements to protect these imp: rtant trading inter,, sts.<br />
7. Mr. Sandys mado it clear that he did not ask the<br />
Australian Governiiont to express an opinion on the question<br />
whether Britain sihould join the Cormon Market. The British<br />
Government itself had as yet reached no decision on this issue.<br />
The im ediate question was whether or not to open negotiations<br />
with the European Economic Cormnunity.<br />
F. As the whole qucstion is of naj. or importanco for Britaii<br />
aind for decision by her, Australian Ministers did not feel<br />
entitled to object to the opening of negotiations by the British<br />
Government should it reach the conclusion that this was<br />
desirable. But they made it clear that the absence of<br />
objection should in the circumstances not be interp: rted as<br />
implying approval. They further stressed that, as in any such<br />
negotiations, varicus Australian export industries would be<br />
materially involved, Australia should be in a position to<br />
ne-otiate direct on Australia's behalf when details and<br />
arrangements affecting items of Australian trade were being<br />
discussed.<br />
9. Mr. Sandys said he well understood the position of the<br />
Australian Govermlont; and he appreciated its understanding of<br />
Britain's problem. It was a: reed that these talks, which had been<br />
conducted in a m., st helpful and constructive spirit on both<br />
sides, had resulted in a more complete understanding of the<br />
inportant and corplex issues involvod.<br />
