SPEECH NOTES FOR THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
FOR THE HOBART CIVIC RECEPTION, 15 FEBRUARY 1975<br />
1. IN 1803 LIEUTENANT JOHN BOWEN MADE THE FIRST<br />
EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT IN TASMANIA AT RiSDON ON. THE<br />
EASTERN SHORE OF THE DERWENT. THE SETTLEMENT<br />
WAS NAMED HOBART AFTER LORD HOBART THEN BRITISH<br />
COLONIAL SECRETARY. THE SITE WAS LATER FOUND<br />
TO BE UNSUITABLE.<br />
2. IN FEBRUARY 1804 19 FEBRUARY, 171 YEARS AGOLIEUTENANT<br />
GOVERNOR DAVID COLLINS SELECTED A<br />
SPOT FIVE MILES FARTHER DOWNSTREAM AT SULLIVAN<br />
COVE AND TOOK POSSESSION FOR THE SETTLEMENT<br />
PROPER OF HOBART TOWN. THIS NAME REMAINED IN<br />
OFFICIAL USE UNTIL 1881.<br />
3. GOVERNOR MACQUARIE VISITED HOBART TOWN IN 1811<br />
AND FOUND BUILDINGS ERECTED IN A VERY IRREGULAR<br />
MANNER AND WITHOUT ANY PLAN WHATEVER. HE HAD<br />
A PLAN DRAWN UP SHOWING A MAIN SQUARE AND<br />
SEVEN STREETS AND HE FORMULATED REGULATIONS<br />
FOR FUTURE BUILDING. ON. HIS SECOND VISIT IN<br />
1821, MACQUARIE WAS IMPRESSED BY THE<br />
IMPROVEMENT MADE. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
14. IN 1838 A POLICE ACT WAS PASSED WHICH WAS THE<br />
GENESIS OF HOBART'IS MUNICIPAL HISTORY. UNDER IT<br />
THE SURVEYOR GENERAL WAS AUTHORISED TO SET OUT<br />
THE LIMITS OF THE TOWN; OTHER SECTIONS RELATED<br />
TO SUCH MATTERS AS THE MARKING OUT OF FOOTPATHS<br />
AND THE BREADTH OF CARRIAGE-WAYS.<br />
IN 18142, HOBART WAS CREATED A CITY. FROM 1846<br />
IT WAS GOVERNED BY COMMISSIONERS ( ELECTED BY<br />
THE RATEPAYERS) WHO PROVIDED FOR LIGHTING,<br />
CLEANING AND PAVING. THEIR POWERS WERE LIMITED,<br />
AND IN 1852 AN ACT WAS PASSED ESTABLISHING A<br />
MUNICIPALITY. IN 1857 HOBART WAS INCOPORATED<br />
AS A CITY, AND ITS MOTTO SIC FORTIS HOBARTIA<br />
CREVIT THUS IN STRENGTH DOES HOBART GROW.<br />
6. THE FIRST MAYOR OF HOBART WAS WILLIAM CARTER IN<br />
1853. THE PRESENT LORD MAYOR, ALDERMAN SOUNDY,<br />
HAS HELD OFFICE SINCE 1970. HIS FATHER WAS,<br />
IN 1932,. THE LAST PERSON TO BE CALLED MAYOR<br />
OF HOBART. By 1938 AFTER A PERIOD OUTSIDE THE<br />
TOWN HALL, HE HAD BECOME THE SECOND LORD MAYOR<br />
OF HOBART. SIR JOHN SOUNDY SET A FINE CIVIC<br />
RECORD FOR HIS SON TO FOLLOW. THE SOUNDY<br />
FAMILY HAS MADE AN EXTRAORDINARY CONTRIBUTION<br />
TO THE GOOD GOVERNMENT OF THE CITY OF HOBART. 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
7. THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S CONCERN FOR THE WELFARE<br />
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. LAST YEAR<br />
WE MADE GRANTS OF $ 56,345., 000 TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
BODIES THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA. OF THAT SUM,<br />
$ 1,669,000 CAME To TASMANIA. IT WAS THE FIRST<br />
TIME IN AUSTRALIA'S HISTORY THAT AN AUSTR'ALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT HAD MADE DIRECT GRANTS TO LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT.<br />
8. MANY PEOPLE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND<br />
WHY NO GRANT WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE HOBART<br />
CITY COUNCIL. THE GRANTS COMMISSION HAS GIVEN<br />
A GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT TO THE STATUS OF CAPITAL<br />
CITY LOCAL GOVERNING BODIES, AND THE EVIDENCE<br />
INDICATES THAT EACH OF THEM HAS A VERY<br />
SUBSTANTIAL ABOVE-STANDARD CAPACITY TO RAISE<br />
REVENUE. THE COMMISSION DECIDED TO RECOMMEND<br />
THAT NO GRANTS BE MADE TO THE CAPITAL CITY<br />
COUNCILS IN SYDNEY, MELBOURNE, ADELAIDE, PERTH<br />
AND HOBART.<br />
9. YOU WILL-ALL BE AWARE THAT A SPECIAL PREMIERS<br />
CONFERENCE WAS HELD YESTERDAY IN CANBERRA.<br />
WE RECOGNISE THE NEED FOR MORE. DIALOGUE BETWEEN<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE STATES AND ONLY<br />
LAST WEEK I ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF A SPECIAL<br />
COMMITTEE OF MINISTERS TO BE CONCERNED PRIMARILY<br />
WITH THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S RELATIONS WITH<br />
THE STATES. eie/ 4 </p>
<p>THIS COMMITTEE WILL ALSO EXAMINE PROGRAMS OF DIRECT<br />
ASSISTANCE TO REGIONS, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL<br />
COMMUNITIES, YESTERDAY IN CANBERRA YOUR PREMIER, ERIC REECE,<br />
AND I SIGNED AGREEMENTS BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENTS<br />
RELATING TO THE NATIONAL ESTATE AND NATIONAL<br />
SEWERAGE PROGRAMS, THE TWO AGREEMENTS UNDER<br />
THE URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT ( FINANCIAL<br />
ASSISTANCE) ACT AMOUNT TO FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE<br />
OF MORE THAN $ 3 MILLION, TASMANIA'S GRANT OF<br />
$ 895,277 FOR NATIONAL ESTATE PURPOSES WILL GO<br />
TOWARDS THE PRESERVATION OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS<br />
AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONSERVATION STUDIES<br />
AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS,<br />
11. I AM DELIGHTED THAT $ 15,000 HAS BEEN ALLOCATED<br />
FOR ASSISTANCE WITH MAINTENANCE AND RESTORATION<br />
WORK ON THE THEATRE ROYAL THE OLDEST AND<br />
SURELY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THEATRE IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
I AM LOOKING FORWARD VERY MUCH TO THE ROYAL<br />
SHAKESPEARE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE THERE TONIGHT, </p>
<p>12. THE HOBART CITY COUNCIL IS TO RECEIVE $ 6,000<br />
FOR A STUDY OF THE FUTURE USES OF SALAMANCA PLACE<br />
AND ITS REMARKABLY PRESERVED HISTORIC STONE<br />
WAREHOUSES. THE FACT THAT THE AREA NOW PULSES<br />
WITH LIFE THROUGH ITS SATURDAY OPEN-AIR MARKET<br />
AND ITS RESTAURANTS, THAT THE ARTS ARE<br />
ENCOURAGED AND THAT TALENTED YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE<br />
BEEN ABLE TO TURN 63 SALAMANCA PLACE INTO A<br />
FAVOURITE COMMUNAL RESOURCE CENTRE IS A<br />
TRIBUTE TO THE IMAGINATION OF BOTH THE CITY<br />
COUNCIL AND THE PEOPLE OF HOBART.<br />
13, THE HOBART CITY COUNCIL HAS ALSO RECEIVED A<br />
GRANT OF $ 175,000 THROUGH TOURISM AND RECREATION<br />
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SYNTHETIC ATHLETICS<br />
TRACK. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO LAST YEAR'S<br />
GRANT OF $ 60,000 FOR THE TRACK AND FIELD<br />
CENTRE. IN VIEW OF MAX WALKER'S GREAT PERFORMANCE<br />
ON THE MAINLAND IN THIS LAST TEST SERIES,<br />
MAYBE SOME MORE INVESTMENT IN CRICKET PROMOTION<br />
HERE WOULD BE MORE THAN JUSTIFIED.<br />
14. LAST YEAR $ 300,000 WAS APPROVED UNDER THE CHILD<br />
CARE ACT, BUT I UNDERSTAND THE COUNCIL HAS HAD<br />
SOME DIFFICULTY IN FINDING A SUITABLE SITE FOR<br />
BUILDING. I HOPE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE<br />
THAT GRANT AT WORK FOR THE BENEFIT OF HOBART'S<br />
YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
I HAVE DELIBERATELY LEFT UNTIL LAST ANY MENTION<br />
OF THE'TASMAN BRIDGE ACCIDENT AND ITS AFTERMATH,<br />
You WILL BE AWARE OF MY OWN DEEP CONCERN AT THE<br />
EXTRAORDINARY MISHAP, AND THAT THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT PLEDGED FULL AND READY CO-OPERATION<br />
IN RESTORING THE TASMAN BRIDGE ITSELF ANb<br />
MAKING GOOD THE LOSS AND DISRUPTION SUFFERED BY<br />
PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE DERWENT,<br />
LEGISLATION WILL BE INTRODUCED SHORTLY PROBABLY<br />
NEXT WEEK TO HONOUR FULLY AND PROMPTLY THE<br />
UNDERTAKINGS WE HAVE GIVEN, UP TO $ 13 MILLION<br />
WILL BE PROVIDED FOR WORKS NECESSARY TO RESTORE<br />
THE BRIDGE ITSELF, AND TENDERS WILL SHORTLY<br />
BE CALLED TO PROVIDE FOR THE CLEARING OF THE<br />
WRECKAGE FROM THE VICINITY OF THE BRIDGE THUS<br />
ALLOWING FURTHER EXAMINATION AND PLANNING FOR<br />
RECONSTRUCTION TO BE CARRIED OUT, MR BARNARD<br />
HAS APPROVED THE PROVISION, THROUGH THE ARMY,<br />
OF SUFFICIENT BAILEY BRIDGE MATERIAL TO ALLOW<br />
CONSTRUCTION OF A TEMPORARY BRIDGE UPSTREAM<br />
TO CARRY ESSENTIAL COMMERCIAL VEHICLES, AND<br />
CONSIDERATION IS BEING GIVEN TO THE PROVISION OF<br />
A PERMANENT SECOND BRIDGE, </p>
