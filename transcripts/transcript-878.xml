P 0 ] SIIZI3G OPPICLAL OPIMING<br />
SPEECH BY THE RIGHT HONUA SIR ROflRT KkNZIESS K. T. 4 Cd.. C. hP<br />
Sir and Mrs. Bass wAn % entlemms<br />
Would those who were present the last time I opened a building<br />
near here please show their hwAmd? 1.11, thank heavens for that,<br />
because I complained as we came up that I've fallen into the habit<br />
of openirW buildings and each time I appear to see the same people<br />
and each time I've tried to say something fresh, aud each time I ve<br />
tried to get a laugh Am occasionally. And the next time I<br />
can't remember what I said and I can only hope that they don't. But<br />
today as far as you are concerned, you are all clean skins, because<br />
only five or six people held their bonds up, so I'm free. I like<br />
tkat reference that wae made to my previou. s enterpripes in this<br />
a~ ea, becaLse during the last election a thing of which you may have<br />
heard I was very interested to discover how many younger people<br />
attended meetings and shoved interest in what went on and I always<br />
try to keep up to date arA therefore I've become familiar with the<br />
new language of the young and it appeare that I am a ' square'an<br />
here I am today, the livirng proof of it the fourth corrierl<br />
Talking atbcut elections, Sir, I don't want to make a political<br />
Wspeech here, of course, but talking about the election, some of you<br />
Will rememiber that when I decided to have one, quite a few of you<br />
thought I ought to be examined. But now, of course, everybody knows<br />
it was the right thing to do. But may I tell you that I used to say<br />
to my colleaguaes, whom I'd plunged into this vortex of politics, at<br />
an election,-' Don't worry, if I win all will be forgiven, if I lose<br />
I'm goinrg to catch the earliest and slowest ship to the furthest<br />
corners of the earth'. In fact I was prepared to nominate, if such<br />
a thing had been available bere, a slow banana ship, becauzse I<br />
understand that that kind of ship would suit so very well. Now, of<br />
ccurs, thfs was a lighthearted remark in a sense for me to be making<br />
tc them because 1 must say I didn't entertain many doubts about having<br />
catch ai ban~ aa ship, but I stan here as a fellow wr~ o's opened the<br />
, ar. tas buildinf, well of course Hudson ? ysh, ( is Hudson here today?)<br />
Hudson owns kantas a" we pay for it, and therefore I bave a certain<br />
SInterest and so have the members of the Government, In Qantas, and<br />
Wwhenever I travel by air I go to great pains to travel ' by Qantas, for<br />
the best reasons In the world. But my great ambition don't use this<br />
against me my great ambition when I finally do get heaved out of<br />
politics, is to retain eniough health and strength to travel thereafter<br />
* bNy sea and in. no other fashion, and that's why I'm delighted at the<br />
end, at tn-is fourth expedition in this area, to come back to the sea<br />
but of course In Australia when we talk about travelling by sea we have<br />
poor nemorles If we don't suddenly _ find ourselves reuem~ erinq P 0 and<br />
Orient. I know there are other shipping lines down below I asked for<br />
R~ booking on one of them to see wbat reaction I would get and it was<br />
apuropriate! But travelling by sea I know that it's alwmys easy jo<br />
say that the rotne goes out of travel it does In a sonse; I<br />
* iareeay that when the men who sailed the seas under sail found smoky<br />
steamers frequenting the sea lane they said ' This is a stop backwards,<br />
this is terrible, this is monstrous' and, every stop forward that occuri<br />
produces some reaction. But I was remembering today, ecoing down here,<br />
that remarkable little poem of Kipling's, do you remember, in which he<br />
is talking about this kind of thing and the dying away of romance and<br />
then says sddenly ' komanoe brought up the 9.15'. Now this Is true<br />
thie, business of travel can be a romantic thing in a prosaic life, it<br />
can1 be Rt neesearv exerc~ se in a busy one. And, of course, we all wt-. c<br />
ire c,) nr,-rned with affairs in this country, like to imagine that we are </p>
<p>extremely busy and that every minute counts and that's w~ w nowaidoys<br />
they are always devising some means of travelling faster and. faster.<br />
~ Y successor, Heaven help him, will have to fly supersonically; he'll<br />
be in London before he leaves here, or worts to that effect, and if<br />
mW experience counts for anything the faster you go, the more weary<br />
you are at the end of the journey; but still, time, they say, is<br />
m~ oney, and I understand this and I don't resist it, a" as a follow<br />
who may have been carted around now about a million miles in the air,<br />
I practice it. But the sea, the sea, when time doesn't matter all<br />
that much and when you reall1y want to ame something of the world and<br />
when you want realy to relax, when you want to be able to arrive at<br />
your destination in fins shape for whaatev er it is that you want to do,<br />
provided you're not in too much of a hurry, this is the way to travel;<br />
this is the way to see foreign ports, this is the to have a glance<br />
at foreign people, at now people, at now climates. ' ye found in<br />
travel by sea the most exciting of all experiences and its exciting<br />
for a* because it isn't exciting in the sense that so maq other<br />
things one has to do are exciting. And therefore I'm a great man for<br />
travelling by sea and one of these days as I said, I'm gon to gratify<br />
myself, I'm going to glut my low tastes, I will be at sea all the time<br />
I'll be at sea so much ( my opponents, of course, know that I have<br />
been in one sense, for a long time) but I will physically be at mea so<br />
much that I'll be able to go along to Donald Anderson and say ' Donald,<br />
Wmy boy, I'm a very good customer, could I have a slight discount on My<br />
next fare?' WAn whn that time comes you'll know that I have achieved<br />
paradise. Now there's one other thing that I would like to say about this<br />
Wfamous Company or Group of companies we talk about the Victorian<br />
era, to a certain extent with disrespect. We're so much cleverer than<br />
they were * in the 19th Century, we're so much wiser, we understand so<br />
much better how to make war and causee trouble in the world we are<br />
rather superi or to the 19th Centuzy. Very interestin that the<br />
Peninsular Company began in the ver7 year that Queen Victori a came<br />
to the throne, and terribly interesting to discover as I did when I<br />
read the notes, that one of the two partners who projected this<br />
enterprise wsa an Anderson. And then, of course, later on, the Orient<br />
Line very interesting to realise that when the Orient Line first<br />
Sbegan to see the possibilities of travel to the Bast, travpl to India,<br />
V they not only went around the Cape, but they went through a phase that<br />
preceded the Bues Canal, in which rasnweesr e disembarked at<br />
Alexandria and went across to Bues by Camel tralla. Well, of course,<br />
travelling on a Canel was all-right if you had boen travelling by sea<br />
Sin those days no doubt passenger* hardly noticed any breach of<br />
V continuity. But isn't It interestig that tod@ y there should be so<br />
closely associated with us, so fanilar in the mouths of so mawy<br />
hundreds of thousands of Australians, a Compaqy, which has in these,<br />
various phases, been associated with, or at any rate, contemporary<br />
with, very remarkable historic evests. thereto another aspect that<br />
I realise~ tor the first tine when I was looking Into this matter, and<br />
that is that after the war,-half of the fleet of each CompaxV had gon<br />
they came out with I think Ion right In sowing " 0 in the cae<br />
of the Orient, " 0 in the case of the P 0. Now this meant, of course,<br />
in a sense, starting from scratch,. It must have presented a challenge,,.<br />
it mast have produced in the first Instance a certain feeling of sorrowthat<br />
such blows should have been struck. But in the result, the<br />
opportunity was &amp; aimed of making all things modern, and in the result<br />
the great fleets of this Compam or Gru fCaniet. getfet<br />
today are, if I may say so, the last woz. ' yve occasonally had the<br />
satisfaction of going across the Atlantic in one of the Veat ships of<br />
the world quite frankly, Sir Donald, without buttering you up in any<br />
way, I would sooner travel aboard one of yours. We have an onorsous<br />
service. Down below they have om the doors as you cam in the swring<br />
glass doors a couple of symbls, did you notice themp instead of<br />
.18 </p>
<p>door handles, one that looks like throe penguins standing side by<br />
side indicates the passenger ships it's symbolic; and the other<br />
one which is all covered with squiares, oddly enough -it represents<br />
the cargo aspect of the business. Wel# of oourset I was at great<br />
pains to come through the passenger entrance beeause both as Prime<br />
Minister mid asLR. l enzies I can speak In the highest possible<br />
tors of the pasenger transport activities of this Company. But<br />
when It comes to cargos I always have to speak subject to the<br />
Department of Trade anid subject to the Department of Primary<br />
Industry, you know what I mean; just as I'm about to become<br />
enthusiastic they sq ' Now wait a moment old boy, we're trying to<br />
got the freights down' and so we'll reserve judgement on that. But<br />
Sir, we live in a time in which comuaications In the world have<br />
developed out of all sight it's only the other day I was present<br />
at the opening of the first conversations on the Compac the now<br />
submarine cable for telephone purposes. We've had all thes<br />
experiences I've said something about flying, television all<br />
tlkene matters have opened up a now world of communications<br />
tremendously important, provided that we use the instruments in<br />
that world with wisdom. But shipping, travelling by sea, retains<br />
one thing which none of these otboe can aspire to, because it gives<br />
to a lot of people the opportunity of greater speed than their<br />
grandfathers ever thought of, but at the same time of leisure,<br />
happineess a sense of explorationg a ense of discovery after<br />
exploration.<br />
San AtWtohrenne yI-( Gfiernsetr alw, eonft aAt usthtrea lieax peton sea ttoefn dth ea ctaoxnpfearyeenrcs e, t o thEensgel anwde reas<br />
wonderful days may I just mention them, quite nostagioally? We<br />
wernt by sea, we travelled by an Orient ship, we took a long time<br />
five and a half weeks. We sometimes in an exuberant moment, or at<br />
one tiae A twice, I think got off at the South of France and<br />
travelled up through Parts. We arrived in London, we were met by a<br />
Minister, who didn't ask us any questions except whether we found<br />
ourselves suitably arranged for at a hotel and we found It wasn't a<br />
bad hotel some cheap dump'lik* the Savoy, or something of that type.<br />
And then we were left alone for about throe days MAn then we were<br />
. eagdievern a handsome lunoheon, where speeches were mode, but as only the<br />
of the Delegation spoke I me on ' the free list. Az4 then<br />
days later, we had the first comference and the Lasder of the<br />
Australian delegation put a powerful case, ( I hope) end the President<br />
O Tohf omtahse, Bhoea rdw ouolf d Trsaayd e ' oWer lwl htoheivse r iist v emriyg hti nhtaevree stbienegn aonrd thvea lulaatbel e, J imwmeie<br />
would like to consider this. When would it be convenient for you to<br />
resume?' And it finally appered that Tuesday week would be a suitable<br />
time. ( I wouldn't want this to go beyond this room you know, but still<br />
it's a long time ago all claims against me are now statute barred).<br />
Then you went up to Scotland, or If you felt that way disposed you<br />
went over to Ireland some reckless characters nipped over to Paris<br />
and on Tuesday week you resumed and the other man made a powerful<br />
speech and this was very good; it was leisurely at the end of<br />
eight weeks we usually got an agreement by the simple process of<br />
threateninpa to catch the next ship unless we got it, and we got it,<br />
but it was a good agreement and. it was kept. Now what happens?<br />
You catch the ' Plane, you put your head on one side, you put your head<br />
on the other, you go uV9 you go down, seventeen hours flying time,<br />
whatever it is and you re in London, you hop out, as well as you can<br />
after a long period of time in which you really haven't slept. You're<br />
ushered into the presence of all tbese camera boys and television<br />
people and press reporters, where you have to give a celebrated<br />
imitation of being extraordinarily intelligent and disposing of<br />
international problems almost with a witty aid* you know, which is<br />
.14 </p>
<p>4.<br />
usually quoted against you for the next twelve moaths. And then you<br />
get into the hotel, you take a bath, you bhange your linen and the<br />
conference begins at half past two the same day and then it goes on<br />
every morning, every afternoon, every night with a reception, same<br />
people, different place. And at the end of ten days you hurtle out<br />
a&amp; gain. Now you ask me to cast a single first past the post vote as<br />
to which system I prefer and in my doddering old age I will tell you<br />
that the earlier one had much to be said for it. And Sir, nobody<br />
contributed more profoundly to this happy state of affairs than the<br />
Orient sl. irpinr Company arid the P 0 shipping Company at that time.<br />
T: is wae the beginning of my affection for them, an affection that<br />
, ae never faded away. And therefore you can see that I have many<br />
reasons, some of them public, many of them private and personal for<br />
being delighted to be here and most honoured to be asked to declare<br />
the building open. .* 7 </p>
