ADDRESS TO THE NATION<br />
Nobody likes paying their taxes, but we all know that<br />
governments have to provide services of a gi'-at many<br />
kinds for education, health, roads z~ nd commnunications,<br />
for the-general. well-being of the commnxr~ ity and it is<br />
important that all people contribute !_ airly, in accordance<br />
with their incomes, -to the goveranent revenues, needed to<br />
provide them.<br />
I am talking to you tonight because there are some people<br />
who have not been contributing fairly. They have been<br />
seeking to avoid or -evade paying taxes and by doing so,<br />
they put a heavier burden on other Australians.<br />
Two important principles are involved in fighting tax<br />
avoidance and tax evasion principles that have come<br />
in-to conflict recently. The first is that in general,<br />
legislation should not be retrospective, and the second<br />
is the overriding need for governments to be fair to all<br />
Australians. over the last several years, the Government has maintained<br />
an unrelenting fight against tax evasion and tax avoidance<br />
and a significant number of . artificial schemes have been<br />
outlawed by legislation. In recent times, this has become<br />
a contentious political matter in relation to what are<br />
known as bottom-of-the-harbour schemes..<br />
These schemes were particularly unpleasant. Whatever the<br />
variations, they always involved three elements: first,<br />
a company was sold with an unpaid tax liabilityl second,<br />
the price paid for the company reflected the fact that<br />
one way or another the tax liability outstanding at<br />
the time of the sale simply would not be paid; third,<br />
those who bought the company stripped it of its assets<br />
so that it had nothing left to pay its taxes.<br />
It was both as simple and as blatant as that It was not<br />
a complicated tax avoidance arrangement, but a straight<br />
out case of a company being emptied of assets with intent<br />
to deny payment of tax which remained legally due.<br />
Two groups of people. gained from these transacti~ ons. These<br />
were, first, the original owners of the company, the vendor<br />
shareholders who received a much better price for their-*<br />
shares than would have been the case if the tax had been paid. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Second, there were the promoters, the people who arranged<br />
the deals who received their promotion fees out of the<br />
evaded tax. A very large sum of money was involved. In many<br />
cases, the current year profits of a company involved in<br />
these schemes would be half a million dollars, and in a<br />
few cases, three or four million dollars or even more.<br />
So, we are not talking about small sums. In total, we<br />
are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars..<br />
The Government introduced legislation in November 1980 to<br />
outlaw these schemes and to impose criminal penalties for<br />
the first time against them, carrying sentences of up to<br />
five years in gaol. We have now passed legislation to<br />
establish a special prosecutor who will prosecute those<br />
who acted illegally. The special prosecutor will have<br />
particular responsibility for action against promoters<br />
of the illegal bottom-of-the-harbour schemes.<br />
Last wee k, we int~ roduced lagislationdes igned to recoup<br />
the tax that shoulId have been paid from those who benefited<br />
from the schemes. This legislation is tax legislation.<br />
it is not crimiri.~ l legislation. it does not carry criminal<br />
penalties. It simply will be saeking to collect the<br />
tax that should have been paid much earlier.<br />
There is an element of retrospectivity in this legislation,<br />
and 1I particularly want to say something about that ' and<br />
about the principle of fairness to all Australians.<br />
None of us like retrospective legislation and there is an<br />
important principle involved in that. Normally the<br />
Government would not consider it, but in these circumstances<br />
we believe that retrospectivity is justified. Retrospective<br />
tax legislation is, after all, by no means, unprecedented.<br />
There are a-t least two occasions in 1936 and in 1978<br />
when the British Parliament passed retrospective legislation<br />
against tax avoidance, . and appeals against the 1936 legislation<br />
were rejected by England's highest courts of appeal.<br />
I and my colleagues in government and I am sure the<br />
overall majority of Australians are absolutely fed up<br />
with the few people who are being unfair to their fellow<br />
Australians. It is clear the Government had to make a<br />
difficult choice between supporting absolutely the<br />
principle of no retrospective legislation or maintaining<br />
its support for the principle of governing fairly for all<br />
Australians. in this instance, in relation to the bottomof-<br />
the-harbour schemes, we made the decision that we must<br />
place the principle of fairness above the principle. of.<br />
retrospectivi ty.<br />
The Government represents all Australians. Its duty is to<br />
govern fairly for all Australians. At elections, people<br />
divide up their votes between political parties, but once<br />
elected to office, it is the duty of governments and of<br />
Members of Parliament to represent all people. That deeply<br />
held conviction is the very foundation of my party, and to<br />
represent all people you have above all to be fair. </p>
<p>-3<br />
I hope that the legislation will be given a thoughtful<br />
but nevertheless speedy passage through the Parliament<br />
so that we can get on with the business of collecting<br />
taxes that should have been paid long ago. There is no<br />
doubt that the legislation will be passed. We wiJll not<br />
allow a situation to exist in which some Australians<br />
need to pay more because a very few are seeking by<br />
improper means to pay less, or none.. </p>
