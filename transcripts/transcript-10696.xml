<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Primer Minister John Howard today continues with a hectic schedule</p>
<p>   of events around the country promoting the Government's new</p>
<p>   tax package. Since the release of the package on Thursday there's</p>
<p>   been a wide range in response. The business sector has been particularly</p>
<p>   enthusiastic about the changes saying it will lead to increased</p>
<p>   investments, while initial responses from the welfare lobby were</p>
<p>   also positive, some have expressed concern about the devil in the</p>
<p>   detail. Meanwhile the package ahas not been embraced by Premier</p>
<p>   Peter Beattie who's expressed fears about Queensland's</p>
<p>   financial position and the impact on our tourism industry. This</p>
<p>   morning Prime Minister John Howard joins me in the studio. He's</p>
<p>   willing to take your call so if you have a question for Mr Howard</p>
<p>   about how this whole tax package will affect you please call us</p>
<p>   now on 1300 36 06 12. John Howard good morning, good to see you</p>
<p>   back here.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Carolyn, good to be here again.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Could I start with whether Parliament's definitely going to</p>
<p>   be reconvened at the end of August?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's the plan.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Is that going to happen?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's the current plan, yes.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>There's just some concern around this morning about the wool</p>
<p>   stockpile and whether that will actually...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Parliament is scheduled to meet on the 31st of</p>
<p>   August.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>All right. What do you make of the polls in the paper this morning</p>
<p>   in response to your tax package? Do you read that as a good thing?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't get carried away with polls. We still have the job</p>
<p>   ahead to explain it. But I am encouraged by the fact that people</p>
<p>   do see this plan for what it is and that is a long-term plan for</p>
<p>   the good of Australia. This is not a plan for the political advantage</p>
<p>   of the Coalition, it's not a plan for a tax cut, it's</p>
<p>   not a plan for a GST, it is a comprehensive attempt to reform a</p>
<p>   ramshackle old-fashioned taxation system and give the country a</p>
<p>   system fit for the 21st century. The Labor Party had</p>
<p>   13 years to fix Australia's tax system. Mr Beazley and Mr Keating</p>
<p>   were at the helm during the whole of those 13 years and they just</p>
<p>   tinkered at the edges and it's obviously going to do the same</p>
<p>   again. We on the other hand recognise that for the sake of Australia</p>
<p>   we need to tackle the weakness of the system, root and branch, and</p>
<p>   that's what we're doing. And you can't look at one</p>
<p>   item in the plan in isolation from everything else. It's interdependent,</p>
<p>   it's interlocked, it's a comprehensive assault on the</p>
<p>   system.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>It's not negotiable?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The essential thrust of it can't be changed. I mean we said</p>
<p>   from the day it was announced that we would have an expert committee</p>
<p>   to deal with some of the minor details and to talk to the community...</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, I'm afraid I'm going to have to interrupt</p>
<p>   you. If you've just joined us, for our regional listeners who've</p>
<p>   joined as at this stage it's 8:35am. You're with Carolyn</p>
<p>   Tucker and the Prime Minister and we're talking about the tax</p>
<p>   package. Now you say that all of these parts are of equal importance.</p>
<p>   Why do you think people are having so much difficulty seeing the</p>
<p>   advantages for them? I mean even though about half of those polled</p>
<p>   think that it's a good thing for the country, only about 20%</p>
<p>   seem to think it's a good thing for them.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Carolyn, it is a big plan. Although once it's fully understood</p>
<p>   and I think it takes a little while for that to occur and that's</p>
<p>   perfectly natural because we are proposing some things that Australia</p>
<p>   hasn't had before. But the great advantage of this is that</p>
<p>   we attempt to tackle the root problem. I mean, what people feel</p>
<p>   about the tax system is that, over the last 13 years in particular,</p>
<p>   Governments have just sort of tinkered at the edges and come election</p>
<p>   time they've offered a personal tax cut. But a personal tax</p>
<p>   cut on its own is not tax reform. I think Australians increasingly</p>
<p>   understand that you can't have the benefit of personal tax</p>
<p>   reductions without fundamental reform to the system. And fundamental</p>
<p>   reform to the system has to involve a goods and services tax, it</p>
<p>   really does. Because the present indirect system is old fashioned,</p>
<p>   it's unfair and imposes a lot of hidden taxes that people aren't</p>
<p>   aware of. I mean I wonder how many of your listeners are aware that</p>
<p>   there's a 22% wholesale sales tax on soft drink, toothpaste,</p>
<p>   pet food, soap and shampoo, cordial, razors, toilet paper, dishwashing</p>
<p>   liquid and washing powder. Now they are ordinary household items</p>
<p>   and they carry not a 10% goods and services tax, they carry a 22%</p>
<p>   wholesale sales tax. So when people say that the price of everything</p>
<p>   is going to go up by 10% they're wrong. The price of many things</p>
<p>   will actually fall because a 22% wholesale sales tax on items like</p>
<p>   that is far greater than a 10% goods and services tax. So what we're</p>
<p>   trying to do is to change, for the sake of Australia, to change</p>
<p>   the whole system. And it will be better for the Australian economy.</p>
<p>   It will allow the Australian economy to grow more strongly. It will</p>
<p>   take $10 billion off business costs in Australia and will take $4.5</p>
<p>   billion of the costs of our exporters.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Well the National Party appears to be somewhat unconvinced about</p>
<p>   the mechanism to assure the GST stays at 10%. I know they issued</p>
<p>   a statement yesterday and then clarified that statement. But what</p>
<p>   about the concept of a referendum to ensure that it stays locked</p>
<p>   in?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you don't, you don't....the likelihood of ever</p>
<p>   getting agreement, Carolyn, and I speak to you as a former Treasurer</p>
<p>   and as a current Prime Minister, that the likelihood of ever getting</p>
<p>   all of the States of Australia, all of the Territories, the Federal</p>
<p>   Government, and the Senate and the House of Representatives to all</p>
<p>   agree on one single thing is so remote as to constitute the most</p>
<p>   practical way imaginable to prevent any future rise, and I think</p>
<p>   it's an extremely effective mechanism.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>That may be the case but if you're having difficulty convincing</p>
<p>   your own Coalition colleagues about that how are you going to convince</p>
<p>   the public.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we're not having difficulty convincing them of it. They</p>
<p>   acknowledge that it's an extremely effective mechanism and</p>
<p>   that is what Mr McDonald said last night and he's the Federal</p>
<p>   Treasurer of the National Party. </p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Yes, second time round though. We haven't heard much from</p>
<p>   One Nation since the release of your tax package but I did catch</p>
<p>   up with the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, this morning for</p>
<p>   a response. Let's have a listen to what she had to say:</p>
<p>HANSON:</p>
<p>I don't, look the big problem I feel, it doesn't address</p>
<p>   the multinationals not paying their share of tax in Australia here.</p>
<p>   Most of the revenue comes from the P-A-Y-E taxpayer and only a very</p>
<p>   small percentage of multinationals and the really big corporations,</p>
<p>   big business, actually pay tax. So therefore Howard is not addressing</p>
<p>   multinationals paying their share of tax.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Is that the only problem you have with it?</p>
<p>HANSON:</p>
<p>No, actually I was going to put out a report this afternoon on</p>
<p>   my concerns about it. Also with the independent retirees I feel</p>
<p>   the one-off payment doesn't really address it because once</p>
<p>   they lose their, the...once the pensioners start paying out then</p>
<p>   they lose that. They're actually paying 15% so that it's</p>
<p>   going to, the superannuants capital is going to be eroded and the</p>
<p>   amount of the duration of pension will be reduced.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>You feel they should get more compensation?</p>
<p>HANSON:</p>
<p>Well, I don't feel that with paying the 10%, because see you've</p>
<p>   got the superannuation fund managers are exempt from paying tax</p>
<p>   on the 15% of the earnings at the moment. See, once the...once</p>
<p>   he brings in the 10% tax then they'll be paying that. So that</p>
<p>   one-off payment doesn't help superannuants with the independent</p>
<p>   self-funded retirees.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>You don't feel the abolition of provisional tax is a good</p>
<p>   thing for the self-funded retirees?</p>
<p>HANSON:</p>
<p>No it doesn't. It doesn't attempt to offset the abolition</p>
<p>   of the superannuation fund managers. Also you've got, my concern</p>
<p>   is with the housing prices which will go up. The $7000 does not</p>
<p>   cover people, first home buyers. Now that first home buyers means</p>
<p>   that people who have never ever been involved in a first home loan</p>
<p>   before in their life. Now say if you met someone new and you may</p>
<p>   not have had a first home loan before but they could have, well</p>
<p>   you're not entitled to it.</p>
<p> TUCKER:</p>
<p>  And you remain opposed to the GST.</p>
<p>HANSON:</p>
<p>Yes I do. I had an open mind about it but I don't believe</p>
<p>   it's in the best interest of the Australian people. We're</p>
<p>   actually looking at, and bringing out a tax policy ourselves that</p>
<p>   will tax system address a fairer tax system and it's virtually</p>
<p>   scrapping the whole lot and starting from the beginning.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>That's Pauline Hanson, the One Nation leader. Prime Minister,</p>
<p>   any immediate response to those comments?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, most of what she said was wrong. To start with multinationals</p>
<p>   are not getting an easy ride. In fact one of the changes that we</p>
<p>   have made is to require the full payment of company tax before a</p>
<p>   remittance is made to an overseas shareholder through a system of,</p>
<p>   known in the trade as full franking of dividends. In other words</p>
<p>   if a payment is made to a company, a shareholder overseas, than</p>
<p>   the Australian Company tax rate, the full rate has got to be deducted</p>
<p>   before a remittance is made. She said all of the burden is being</p>
<p>   carried by P-A-Y-E taxpayers. There's a $13 billion tax cut</p>
<p>   for P-A-Y-E taxpayers. I don't know what she's talking</p>
<p>   about when she says we're taxing superannuation funds. There's</p>
<p>   no change in the tax rate on superannuation funds. There's</p>
<p>   a full imputation in relation to the shareholdings of superannuation</p>
<p>   funds. She said she's against the abolition of provisional</p>
<p>   tax. I'm amazed that she should be against the abolition of</p>
<p>   provisional tax. It's the bane of existence of a lot of farmers,</p>
<p>   of a lot of small businessmen and a lot of self-funded retirees.</p>
<p>   So just on that very quick reading, and she says that the pension</p>
<p>   would phase out because of the introduction of the 10%. I don't</p>
<p>   know what she means by that. We're increasing the pension by</p>
<p>   4% on the 1st of July in the year 2000. In fact there</p>
<p>   are 10 individual benefits in this plan for pensioners and self</p>
<p>   -funded retirees. She mentioned the $1000. That is only one of ten</p>
<p>   measures. She didn't mention that we're increasing the</p>
<p>   retired persons rebate, tax rebate, by $250 a year for a single</p>
<p>   person, $350 for a couple. She didn't mention that we're</p>
<p>   reducing the pension taper rate from 50% to 40%. She didn't</p>
<p>   mention that we're increasing the free area by 2.5%. She didn't</p>
<p>   mention that there is a 30% tax rebate for private health insurance.</p>
<p>   The percentage of retired people who have private health insurance</p>
<p>   is higher than that within the general community therefore that</p>
<p>   particular proposal is of greater benefit to retired people than</p>
<p>   any other section of the Australian community.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Okay. Well, let's get onto calls so you can mention all the</p>
<p>   other things in the tax package. Would you mind slipping those headphones</p>
<p>   on because you won't be able to hear them otherwise? Anne,</p>
<p>   good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Oh hi. Me, is that me?</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Yes it is.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Oh sorry. Mr Howard, I was wondering if you could actually listen</p>
<p>   to, and answer a question of mine without pulling out the usual</p>
<p>   automatic political spiels. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know that we've spoken before so....</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Firstly can you not interrupt me?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I've watched your mannerism okay....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, I'm sorry. I'm simply not going to....you</p>
<p>   and I have never encountered each other before so I reject what</p>
<p>   you have to say.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] could you just answer my question?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, when you give it to me.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Okay, I will in the moment. Firstly though I'd just like to</p>
<p>   point out that politicians and people who support the GST have in</p>
<p>   my opinion already rorted the current tax system and made their</p>
<p>   money and no matter what happens now it's not going to affect</p>
<p>   them.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You don't have a question, you have a statement.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>You and Mr Beazley and I'm sure a lot of other high-income</p>
<p>   earners have said that you will have a GST advantage of around about</p>
<p>   $80 a week. Yet ordinary battlers who work just hard, if not harder</p>
<p>   than you, will only get an advantage of approximately half of that</p>
<p>   at the most. Can you justify why that difference is fair because</p>
<p>   real people who live in the real world can't and they're</p>
<p>   the one who voted last time remember?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, now that I've heard that statement Anne, let me give</p>
<p>   you my statement. My statement is that the people who have relatively</p>
<p>   high incomes of course pay much higher levels of taxation than people</p>
<p>   on lower incomes. That is the way a progressive taxation system</p>
<p>   works. We have not reduced the top marginal rate but we have reduced</p>
<p>   the bottom rate from 20 to 17. We've got rid of the 34 and</p>
<p>   the 43 cent rates and between $20,000 and $50,000 where most tax</p>
<p>   payers are, that's $20,000 a year and $50,000 a year, there</p>
<p>   will be a new single rate of 30%. Now that means that people in</p>
<p>   that income range will be able to earn a bit more overtime and have</p>
<p>   a wage increase without passing into a higher taxation bracket.</p>
<p>   It is always the case with a progressive taxation system that a</p>
<p>   person on a higher income, in dollar terms, gets a larger tax cut</p>
<p>   than a person on a lower income because that person is paying a</p>
<p>   lot more tax in the first place. I mean that is how a progressive</p>
<p>   taxation system works. But I'd also point out to you that people</p>
<p>   on higher incomes like Mr Beazley and myself, as a result of our</p>
<p>   first Budget, do not have such generous superannuation arrangements</p>
<p>   as we once had and that particular superannuation change only applies</p>
<p>   to people who earn over $70,000 a year. So in our very first Budget,</p>
<p>   in the name of fairness, in the name of being fair to the battlers</p>
<p>   which you claim to be speaking for, we introduced a measure that</p>
<p>   only applied to high-income earners and in fact was widely criticised</p>
<p>   by those people.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Question: for the real of people of this country, so you have definitely</p>
<p>   lost my vote...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't think I had it in the first place.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Thank you Anne for your call. Don, good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning. Mr Howard, actually you answered Pauline Hanson by</p>
<p>   saying that the overseas shareholders are taxed or will be tax through</p>
<p>   their payments etcetera. But what you didn't say is if a company</p>
<p>   is operating from an offshore company, offshore base, how much tax</p>
<p>   do companies like Toyota, Nissan, Coca-Cola and that pay in this</p>
<p>   country where they can transfer large lumps of sum...large lumps</p>
<p>   of money out of the country untaxed because they've brought</p>
<p>   product into the country at a sale price, not at the wholesale price.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there are provisions in taxation legislation already about</p>
<p>   transfer prices so they are there already. And I'd make the</p>
<p>   point again that one of the provisions that we are introducing is</p>
<p>   a requirement under the dividend franking arrangements, sorry for</p>
<p>   the jargon, but that's how it's described, whereby if</p>
<p>   a company operating in Australia pays a dividend to an overseas</p>
<p>   shareholder....</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>That's the dividend?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah, well I know. Well that is the way you evacuate the profit</p>
<p>   made to your overseas shareholder. I mean that's the way it</p>
<p>   works.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Evacuating [inaudible].</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if it's being evacuated through a transfer pricing mechanism</p>
<p>   there are other transfer pricing prohibitions in the income tax</p>
<p>   legislation, and there's a further device that I haven't</p>
<p>   mentioned and that is that in relation to the arrangement we're</p>
<p>   proposing for the abusive trusts, and I noticed Mrs Hanson was talking</p>
<p>   about those in the paper this morning. One of the things we announced</p>
<p>   on Thursday, with effect from Thursday, is that where you've</p>
<p>   got a series of cascading trusts, the head trust in effect has got</p>
<p>   to disclose the name of the ultimate beneficiary of those cascading</p>
<p>   trusts otherwise that person is taxed at the top marginal rate.</p>
<p>   Now the effect of that of course is, in my view, will be to stop</p>
<p>   a lot of the abuse that is occurring through the use of trusts offshore.</p>
<p>   A practice that was allowed to flourish for 13 years under the former</p>
<p>   Labor Government.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Happy with that Don?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>No. He's talking about trusts which I imagine would be Australian</p>
<p>   companies setting up trusts.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm talking about tax avoidance, that's what I'm</p>
<p>   talking about. And I'm talking about a device announced by</p>
<p>   the Government to clamp down on a tax avoidance practice that was</p>
<p>   allowed to develop when Mr Beazley and Mr Keating were running the</p>
<p>   country.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Well it's not the dumping of policy but what I'm saying</p>
<p>   is if someone exports a car from say, Japan into Australia, and</p>
<p>   sold in Australia for $20,000 or whatever and all they've got</p>
<p>   to do is write out the invoice for 19,500 and say: well it cost</p>
<p>   them $500.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the point I'm making is that there are provisions in</p>
<p>   the Act which are designed to prevent that sort of dishonesty occurring</p>
<p>   and those provisions have been there for some time.</p>
<p>TUCKER:</p>
<p>Thanks Don, we'll have to move on I'm afraid. Hello Margot.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Oh, good morning. Good morning Carolyn and good morning Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, it was stated recently in the University of New South</p>
<p>   Wales report that aged pensions are below the poverty line now.</p>
<p>   With couples just being in line on low costs and singles falling</p>
<p>   $50 short of living low costs. This 4% you're throwing pensioners</p>
<p>   will not compensate for the increase in food and other items. Mr</p>
<p>   Howard, the question I'd like to ask you: are you prepared</p>
<p>   for an increase in the Medicare bill?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Am I prepared for an increase in the Medicare bill?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure what you mean by an increase in the Medicare</p>
<p>   bill.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Right, well...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I'm trying to be obscure. I'm just not</p>
<p>   quite sure what you mean.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>No, I realise that. But pensioners will cut down on food and more</p>
<p>   trips to the doctor because of the inadequacy of the nutrition in</p>
<p>   the food that they should be getting. And this was already stated.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know what....I think I've now got the</p>
<p>   thrust of your reference to Medicare. Well, I don't agree with</p>
<p>   you. The increase in the general cost of living as a result of the</p>
<p>   changes will be 1.9%. I mentioned earlier that there are a lot of</p>
<p>   items that will actually fall in price.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes, I heard that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Now, and I think it's very very important that people understand</p>
<p>   that the reason why, with the 10% GST, the across the board price</p>
<p>   increase is only 1.9%. It is because things like confectionary,</p>
<p>   and biscuits, and flavoured milk, and ice-cream, and soft drink,</p>
