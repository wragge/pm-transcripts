12 March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD, MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THlE OFFICIAL OPENING OF THE<br />
TORRUMBARRY WEIR ECHUCA, VICTORIA<br />
E&amp;<br />
Well thank you very much Professor Luvering. To Mr Pat McNamara, the Deputy<br />
Premier of Victoria, to my Federal Ministerial colleagues Mr John Anderson, the<br />
Minister for Primary Industry and Energy, Senator Robert Hill, the Leader of the<br />
Government in the Senate and Minister for the Environment, to Marie Tehan, to<br />
Sharmnan Stone the Federal Member for Murray and to all of my other Parliamentary<br />
colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It really is a tremendous pleasure to be here on this very special occasion for this part<br />
of Australia. Can I say what an enormous delight it is to get out of Canberra and out<br />
of Sydney an~ d out of Melbourne and out of all the big population centres of Australia<br />
and come to rural Australia. I mean, it's not that I've got anything against those other<br />
places it's just that on occasions we get accused of thinking that the world, sort of,<br />
rotates around those parts of Australia and when in reality Australia is made up of<br />
many parts of many different parts. And one of the many things that I'm<br />
endeavouring to do and the many things that my Government is endeavouring to do is<br />
to establish a very profound and effective contact and resonance with rural and<br />
regional Australia. And as a token of that yesterday the Federal Cabinet had its first<br />
meeting in regional Australia at Pakenllam. Some people might say that's just a<br />
tentative step into regional Australia, but it's going to get better and better as time<br />
goes on so that at the end of three years we will have chalked up a significant number<br />
of meetings that are being held outside the major population centres. So this event<br />
here today has a place in that but it's more important that than.<br />
This is a very special event and its an occasion that's marked quite a milestone so far<br />
as the locality is concerned. It marks a milestone in another example as the<br />
engineering capacity of Australians and the ingenuity of Australians. This is, I<br />
understand, the first major the first intervention of any kind in the flow of the river<br />
since 1924 when the original weir was constructed. And what today's event does it,<br />
sort of; brings together the modem engineering capacity and skill of Australians, but<br />

<p>Fax from it's also tinged with some of our history. And to travel here on that lovely paddle<br />
steamer, to be reminded by the local member that 30, what, 50, &amp; o 70 years ago you<br />
had a magnificent ship building industry here. That paddle steam er was built here and<br />
Echuca has the largest gathering, if you call a group of paddle steamers a gathering,<br />
the largest gathering of paddle steamers anywhere in the world and I think that's sort<br />
of a mixture of the old and the new and the wonderful historic touch is something that<br />
adds to the occasion. But even beyond that, of course, this is an occasion to remark<br />
upon the important work of the Murray/ Darling Basin Commission. 40 per cent of<br />
Australia's agriculture is contained within the Murray/ Darling Basin. The construction<br />
of the new weir is a cooperative effort between the Federal Government and the State<br />
Governments of Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia and I particularly<br />
want to acknowledge the contribution of the Victorian Government and the presence<br />
here today of the Deputy Premier of Victoria, Pat McNamara.<br />
But ladies and gentlemen, looking to the fuxture, fixing up the Murray Darling Basin is<br />
about the most important environmental challenge that this State can have. That lovely<br />
poem talks about the pollution in the River Murray, and there is pollution. There is<br />
pollution in the river. There is the degradation of soil through salinity. There are many<br />
other ongoing environmental challenges that this country has. And I think all<br />
Australians now want a balance between environment and development. They want to<br />
look after our national heritage but they also want industrial progress, and you can<br />
balance the two. It's not a situation of saying that all development is bad. That is<br />
crazy stupid nonsense. Equally worse we've passed the day when we could take<br />
action that effected our environment and believing that somehow or other the problem<br />
would cure itself The problem doesn't cure itself And we do need to invest time and<br />
resources into caring for our environment. And that's the reason why the Federal<br />
Government promised before the last election and I'm very happy to say that we are<br />
now in a position to implement it we promised the establishment of the Natural<br />
Heritage Trust of Australia. And that Natural Heritage Trust will have paid into it just<br />
under $ 1.2 billion and that will be out of the proceeds of the sale of one third of<br />
Telstra. And that $ 1.2 billion will be used over a period of years exclusively for<br />
environmental projects. And out of that we will fully fund the $ 163 million that the<br />
Commission believes is necessary to carry out important environmental work for the<br />
Murray Darling Basin. And that $ 163 million will be one of the first ( inaudible) on that<br />
Natural Heritage Trust. And I'm therefore able to say to people who are intimately<br />
connected with the Murray Darling Basin recognising the long term importance of it to<br />
the agricultural base and the agricultural future of Australia, I'm able to say to you, to<br />
all of you, that we have a firm deliverable commitment in relation to the<br />
recommendations of the Cormmission and the changes to the environmental care that<br />
that Commission has recommended. And it does represent an historic commitment by<br />
Australian governments to the environmental future of our nation and it delivers on a<br />
very, very important commitment that I made to the Australian people at the time of<br />
the last election. Believing as I did then and I do now that the future of this nation<br />
rest very heavily upon getting the right balance between development, industry and<br />
the environment, particularly in the regonal parts of Australia.<br />
So Professor Luvering can I say that we have taken notice of the views expressed by<br />
the Commission and we are very, very strongly committed to the implementation of an<br />
action plan of the type the Commission has outlined. Fafrft12/ 03/ 97 18: 03 Pg: 8 </p>
<p>Fax from A great deal has already been said about the weir and I had the intricacies of it<br />
explained to me as I came here today. And it has been a collaborative project and it's<br />
been contributed to by all of the four governments that I mentioned. And it'will<br />
improve the water quality. It will establish environmental ( inaudible) capable of<br />
sustaining natural processes and it has developed an integrated management strategy<br />
for the river system.<br />
But in addition to that of course, as Pat mentioned, I'm very happy to be associated<br />
with the armouncement today of a further local initiative to compliment the new weir<br />
and to stimulate local development and that is the Logan Murray 2000 plus strategy<br />
And my colleague, John Anderson, will sign the memorandum of understanding on<br />
behalf of the Federal Government immediately after this opening ceremony.<br />
But the purpose of this strategy is to bring together the Federal Government, the State<br />
government, the local community, in working out strategies that can most effectively<br />
secure and promote and maintain development in a coordinated, economically sensible<br />
way, a community sensitive way, in the local area. And we will, in association with the<br />
Victorian Government, be investing some $ 660 000 to support the objectives of that<br />
memorandum of understanding.<br />
But the last thing, ladies and gentlemen, I want to say to you today is something that is<br />
really at the core of what this region is all about and the core of what our nation is all<br />
about and that is that sense of cooperation, that sense, if you like, of community<br />
obligation, of mutual obligation that we each have to the other. This weir has been<br />
made possible through the cooperation of four governments. We each acknowledge<br />
the contributions of the other government. It is not just a Commonwealth Government<br />
project, it's not just a Victorian government project, or a New South Wales or South<br />
Australian government one. It is a project of all of the four governments. And our<br />
communities rest very heavily on that notion of cooperation and that notion of sharing<br />
responsibilities. I have a very deep personal commitment to the future of regional Australia. I know<br />
some of the problems that regional Australia has passed through over recent years. I<br />
don't pretend to you that I have all of the answers, but I do have all of the energy and<br />
all of the commnitment to try and address those problems. I know the importance of<br />
small business to areas such as this area. I know the importance of small business to<br />
the rural and regional towns of Australia and that is why my Government has placed<br />
such a great importance on small business. I know the value of infrastructure to<br />
regional Australia. I also know the value of community cooperation. And in that<br />
connection, let me say that the Federal Government's ' work for the dole' scheme,<br />
which I announced details of yesterday after the Cabinet meeting in Pakenham, is<br />
designed to harness the combined energies and commitment of local communities,<br />
local business organisations, the local service clubs and all the other groups that are<br />
interested in tackling some of the great national issues it confronts. So unemployment<br />
and youth unemployment remains one. And I salute the achievements that have<br />
chalked up in that area which Pat McNamara mentioned as a tribute to those that have<br />
taken risks and have invested. Faxro'~ 12/ 03/ 97 18: 03 Pg: 9 </p>
<p>Fax from But cooperation between diferent parts of the community and that sense that we do<br />
have obliga tions to each other and we do have obligations to cooperate with each<br />
other in tackling great national problems as well as regional problems is a very, very<br />
important message for all of us.<br />
So in being here today in formally opening or commissioning I think you commidssion<br />
weirs rather than open them, it looked pretty open to me on the way over ill being<br />
here today to take part in the commissioning of this Weir may I conclude by<br />
complimenting Tiess, complimenting Guthridge, Hascombe and Davies,<br />
complimenting the Commission and all of those that have been associated with this<br />
project. It always warms my heart, it always has, to see a great tangible solid<br />
engineering achievement. You really feel as though something's been achieved when<br />
you can see it and you can see what the money's been spent on and there it is, the<br />
direction of the river has changed, it looks as though it works and you are<br />
tremendously impressed with it. And I can see by the happy faces of some of the<br />
Wmers here that it does work.<br />
So ladies and gentlemen it's an occasion above all to be thankful about being an<br />
Australian, thankfu~ l for the great quality of life that you have in regional and rural<br />
Australia. Thank the lovely school children that led us in the singing of the National<br />
Anthem and that magnificent poem and those who organised that competition. But I<br />
may 1, on your behalf, salute those that have made the weir possible. Their skill, their<br />
engineering capabilities and their design skills have brought it to fruition and therefore<br />
I have great pleasure in commissioning it and thank you very much for having me here<br />
today. Thank you. Fafrvi12/ 83/ 97 18: 83 Pg: </p>
