FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY JUNE 23 1982<br />
VISIT TO CHINA<br />
I shall be visiting China from 4-6 August, in response<br />
to an invitation from the Chinese Premier, Mr Zhao Ziyang.<br />
I previously visited China in 1976.<br />
This visit will provide me with an opportunity to meet<br />
Premier Zhao and other Chinese leaders for the first time<br />
and to discuss international issues of mutual interest as<br />
well as the further development of bilateral relations.<br />
1982 marks the tenth anniversary of Australia's relations<br />
with China. In that short period Australia and China have<br />
developed a close and valued relationship with exchanges<br />
taking place in many fields. China plays a major political<br />
and strategic role in the Asia/ Pacific region, and is of<br />
economic importance to Australia.<br />
The Austral: Lan Government places a high priority on its<br />
relations with China and welcomes this opportunity for<br />
direct. discussions with China's leaders. </p>
