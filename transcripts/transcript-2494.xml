COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Ri Hon. W. MeMAHON, M. P.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
ON<br />
Visit to the United States of America and<br />
Great Britain<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 23 November 1971]<br />
MW McMAHON ( Lowe-Prime Minister)-<br />
I seek leave to make a statement on<br />
my recent visit to the United States of<br />
America and Great Britain.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Is leave granted? There<br />
being no objection leave is granted.<br />
Mr McMAHON-The statement is in 3<br />
parts-the United States, Britain and<br />
general matters common to both countries.<br />
I think most honourable members in this<br />
House would agree that Australia stands<br />
on the threshold of a transitional period in<br />
its development as a nation. We are living<br />
in a world in which relations with our<br />
traditional allies and friends and with the<br />
nations of the Asian and Pacific region are<br />
changing significantly. And so, having<br />
received invitations from ' both President<br />
Nixon and Prime Minister Heath, I<br />
believed it was wise to go to Washington<br />
and London.<br />
It was natural that as the head of a<br />
recently formed government I should welcome<br />
the opportunity for discussions with<br />
the leaders of 2 major powers who are<br />
traditionally close friends and allies of this<br />
country. With the passage of time there is<br />
inevitably a risk that changing circumstances<br />
might erode the understandings and<br />
contractual arrangements of long standing<br />
between us and put under strain the com-<br />
23253/ 71 mitments; embodied in them. Moreover,<br />
changes are taking place in the world strategic<br />
balance of power which are of fundamental<br />
importance to us. As honourable<br />
mem'bers know, I left Australia on 27th<br />
October and returned last Thursday, 18th<br />
November. 1 believe this visit was timely,<br />
successful and to Australia's advantage.<br />
A new -balance is emerging which<br />
includes the United States, the Soviet<br />
Union, the People's Republic of China,<br />
Japan and the European comnmunity,<br />
including Britain. In this situation the<br />
voice and influence of a medium power<br />
such as Australia is becoming increasingly<br />
significant. On behalf of the Government<br />
of this country, I wanted to establish close<br />
personal contact with leaders in the United<br />
States and Britain and -to explore their<br />
thinking on major international issues,<br />
their attitudes to which are of importance<br />
to us. I also wanted to put at the highest<br />
level our own views on some of these<br />
bilateral and international questions.<br />
My visit to America followed closely the<br />
United Nations vote on the admission of<br />
the People's Republic of China which<br />
created a new situation in the world body<br />
and in the Asian region. It followed Dr<br />
Kissinger's return from his second visit to<br />
Peking. And, as it happened, it occurred at </p>
<p>the same time as the defeat of the foreign<br />
aid Bill in the United States Senate. It<br />
came shortly before Mr Laird's visit to<br />
Vietnam and President Nixon's planned<br />
announcement of further American troop<br />
withdrawals from that country. It also<br />
preceded the President's planned visits to<br />
Peking and Moscow. My visit to the<br />
United Kingdom followed immediately<br />
after the House of Commons had voted in<br />
favour of British entry into the European<br />
Economic Community. It also preceded Sir<br />
Alec Douglas-Home's present attempt to<br />
find a solution of the Rhodesian. problem.<br />
In the international economic field the<br />
world's currency arrangements are in<br />
disorder and the stability and growth of<br />
international trade are threatened.<br />
In the United States, I had lengthy and<br />
very frank discussions with President<br />
Nixon, Secretary of State Rogers, Defence<br />
Secretary Laird, Deputy Secretary Packard,<br />
Dr Kissinger, Under Secretary of the<br />
Treasury Volcker, Chairman of the Council<br />
of Environmental Quality Russell Train,<br />
and Senator Fulbright, Chairman of the<br />
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I also<br />
had discussions with many others including<br />
tthore SRceoptut; b ltihcaen SeLceraedtaerry inf orth eC oSmenma-eter, c eS, enMar-<br />
Morris Stanq, who is to visit Australia<br />
shortly; and the Managing-Director of the<br />
International Monetary Fund and the<br />
chairman of the Export-Import Bank. All<br />
of these talks were very frank and<br />
friendly. I have returned with the firm<br />
impression that the American Administration<br />
is well disposed towards Australia.<br />
This reinforcement of our relationship at<br />
the personal level is worthwhile in itself.<br />
An important result of my visit was the<br />
public reaffirmation by President Nixon of<br />
the continuing strength and validity of the<br />
AINZUS Treaty. President Nixon gave me<br />
an unconditional and unqualified assurance<br />
that ANZUS is as valid today as it -was<br />
when it was signed, 20 years ago. The<br />
ANZUS Treaty, as honourable members<br />
will know, provides that in the event of an<br />
armed attack on any one of them or on<br />
their forces in the Pacific area, the United<br />
States, Australia and New Zealand would<br />
each act to meet the common danger in<br />
accordance with its constitutional processes.<br />
The reaffirmation is important for 3<br />
reasons: Firstly, it was described by the<br />
President as one of the fundamental pillars of American Policy in the Pacific, giving it<br />
a special emphasis at a time when a new<br />
balance of forces is emerging throughout<br />
the world; secondly, it was a most positive<br />
public affirmation of the Treaty following<br />
the announcement of the Nixon Doctrine<br />
which outlined new American attitudes in<br />
the Asian and Pacific region; and thirdly,<br />
it came at a time when a minority in Australia<br />
was doubting its worth and others<br />
were downgrading its importance. I should<br />
add that, in all my discussions on this subject,<br />
it was clear that we shared the view<br />
that ANZUS is more than a Treaty. It is<br />
the symbol of the close co-operation which<br />
exists between Australia, the United States<br />
and New Zealand. But more than that, in<br />
addition to providing for the annual meeting<br />
of Ministers, it furnishes a framework<br />
of practical co-operation under which there<br />
is constant exchange of information and<br />
views of the greatest importance to Australia.<br />
Senator Fulbright, who has been<br />
critical of many of America's involvements<br />
beyond its shores, also said-to use his<br />
own words-' ANZUS was different' and<br />
was a commitment of indefinite duration.<br />
None of this must suggest any easing off in<br />
our determination to strengthen and<br />
enlarge our defence capacity. We are a<br />
nation of increasing influence in the world<br />
with a fundamental responsibility for our<br />
internal and external affairs. This responsibility<br />
is ours and ours alone. But if circumstances<br />
beyond our capability arise, we<br />
know we have reliable allies.<br />
On my way home I discussed defence<br />
strategy in the Pacific with the United<br />
States Commander-in-Chief, Pacific, in<br />
Honolulu. We spoke of the continuing<br />
danger of Communist subversive and<br />
insurgent activities throughout the region. I<br />
also remind the House of the uncompromising<br />
speech by the Chinese delegate to<br />
the United Nations on his first appearance<br />
at that for-um earlier this month. We have<br />
no hostility to the great Chinese people<br />
who have contributed so much to the culture<br />
and history of mankind and we<br />
favour an accommodation with them.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Order! I remind those<br />
honourable members who are interjecting<br />
that there is a great deal of interest in this<br />
statement both inside and outside the<br />
House. The Leader of the Opposition is to<br />
follow the Prime Minister and I hope that<br />
he will be accorded the same kind of </p>
<p>reception as is given to the Prime Minister.<br />
So I suggest that honourable members contain<br />
themselves.<br />
Mr McMAHON-But we should not<br />
forget that this great revolutionary power<br />
in Asia still holds fast publicly to its policies,<br />
including its support of National Liberation<br />
movements. We will seek to<br />
advance our own dialogue with China but,<br />
as I have said before, we will proceed with<br />
caution. In my talks with the Secretary for<br />
Defence and Deputy Secretary Packard,<br />
who has recently visited this country, I<br />
raised the question of the security of the<br />
Indian Ocean. It was agreed that the<br />
increased Soviet naval presence does not<br />
constitute a serious threat at present to the<br />
vital sea lanes across the Southern Indian<br />
Ocean, but it was also agreed that the situation<br />
needs to be watched with care, particularly<br />
in view of the fact that the Soviet<br />
presence, of course, can be built up<br />
quickly and sustained, especially if the<br />
Suez Canal were to be re-opened. I am<br />
satisfied the United States is fully aware of<br />
the political and strategic importance of<br />
the Indian Ocean and agrees that a careful<br />
watch should be continued in this area.<br />
The United States will continue visits and<br />
transits by its naval ships and naval exercises<br />
in the Indian Ocean. They have welcomed<br />
the possibility of using facilities at<br />
Cockburn Sound and are, with the United<br />
Kingdom, maintaining a communication<br />
station at Diego Garcia.<br />
During my talks with President Nixon<br />
and Mr Laird we exchanged assessments<br />
on the situation and the future in Indo-<br />
China. The view, which I questioned<br />
closely, was put forward that Vietnamization<br />
in both the military and the economic<br />
sense was making very good progress and<br />
that the situation in South Vietnam was<br />
much more stable and promising than<br />
seemed likely 9 months ago. I was also<br />
informed of American intentions regarding<br />
troops to remain after the withdrawal of<br />
American combat forces and on the maintenance<br />
of air and naval support for the<br />
Vietnamese forces for some time to come.<br />
I informed the President of our decision in<br />
principle to assist in the training of Cambodian<br />
troops in South Vietnam after our<br />
own combat forces are withdrawn if practicable<br />
arrangements can be made in conjunction<br />
with the other countries concerned. The President and other members<br />
of the Administration expressed their<br />
appreciation in the warmest terms of our<br />
constant support and help in Indo-China.<br />
If I might digress for a moment, our hope<br />
in Vietnam and indeed in Cambodia and<br />
Laos is simply that these countries will<br />
have the opportunity to live in peace and<br />
to determine their own futures, rather than<br />
have imposed upon them, by force,<br />
unwanted communist regimes. Can anyone<br />
in this House seriously contest the sense<br />
and propriety of this objective? In essence<br />
our policy towards Cambodia, which<br />
attracted so much public interest while I<br />
was overseas, is to play a modest part<br />
through aid and training programmes in<br />
helping to give that country a chance to<br />
survive as an independent non-communist<br />
state. As I have emphasised before, there is<br />
no question of sending Australian military<br />
advisers or instructors to Cambodia. During<br />
my discussions I invited President<br />
Nixon to visit Australia at a time when it<br />
would be possible for him to do so.<br />
The Australian Government has been<br />
giving much thought to the question of the<br />
environment. I took the opportunity while<br />
in Washington to have discussions with Mr<br />
Russell Train and other members of the<br />
council on environmental quality. From<br />
these discussions I gained valuable insights<br />
into American experience of the problems<br />
of dealing wi'h pollution and environmental<br />
protection measures, especially in<br />
the context of a federal-state relationship.<br />
They are willing to assist and advise in this<br />
field where they have already made some<br />
notable advances. In Washington, I took<br />
advantage of the presence of the Prime<br />
Minister of India, Mrs Gandhi, to have a<br />
full discussion wi'h her on the situation in<br />
the east of the sub-continent. After this<br />
meeting I sent another message to President<br />
Yahya Khan urging upon him once<br />
again the need to deal with the elected<br />
representatives of East Pakistan and with<br />
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. During the discussion,<br />
Mrs Ghanii said she would<br />
welcome a visit by Australian members of<br />
Parliament to see for themselves conditions<br />
in the refugee areas.<br />
I turn now to * my visit to Britain. In<br />
London I had detailed discussions with the<br />
Prime Minister, Mr Heath; the Foreign<br />
Secretary, Sir Alec Douglas-Home; the<br />
Minister for Defence, Lord Carrington; the </p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Barber;<br />
the Minister responsible for the British<br />
relations with the European Economic<br />
Community, Mr Rippon; and the Governor<br />
of the Bank of England. I also addressed<br />
the Cook Society, the Confederation of<br />
British Industries and the Australia-British<br />
Tiade Association. Naturally, I spent a<br />
great deal of time discussing the British<br />
entry into the European Economic Community.<br />
I started from the point that,<br />
while we had been disappointed at the<br />
terms agreed upon for British entry, those<br />
terms were now a fact and we should look<br />
towards the best arrangements we could<br />
make for the future.<br />
Generally, I expressed the hope that Britain,<br />
having made its decision, would now<br />
use its influence to ensure that the community<br />
was outward-looking and international<br />
in its approach, that it should be flexible in<br />
its approach to world trade, rather than<br />
regionally exclusive in its attitude. I also<br />
pressed strongly for assurances that during<br />
the transitional period the British would<br />
adopt as helpful an attitude as possible to<br />
Australian commodities affected by the<br />
British entry. I was assured by Mr Heath,<br />
Sir Alex Douglas-Home and Mr Rippon<br />
that Britain would use its influence to see<br />
that the European Economic Community<br />
adopted an outward-looking policy. The<br />
point was made to me that Britain<br />
depended heavily on its trade and, consequently,<br />
the widest area of multi-lateral<br />
trade and payments was a source of<br />
strength. The point was made to me also<br />
that a weak Britain would be of little use<br />
to its old Commonwealth friends. A<br />
strong Britain within the EEC woruld be of<br />
value to countries like Australia. Mr<br />
Rippon also explained fully the inclusion<br />
of a clause in the entry agreement that if<br />
imports of an agricultural commodity subject<br />
to import levies were seriously affected<br />
or likely to be affected by British entry,<br />
either Australia or Britain would have the<br />
right to raise the matter before the<br />
commission. Assurances-the value of which<br />
admittedly can only be fully tested in<br />
time-that Britain would, during the transitional<br />
period, be ready to discuss on a<br />
commodity basis those commodities likely<br />
to be affected by British entry into the<br />
Common Market, were reaffirmed to me.<br />
The point was also made to me that it would be desirable for the industries concerned<br />
to be active in presenting their<br />
cases themselves. I urged upon British<br />
Ministers the need for the EEC to adopt<br />
measures to ensure that the exports of<br />
tropical produce from. Papua New Guinea<br />
are in a no less favorurable position than<br />
those from other developing countries<br />
which are to receive special treatment.<br />
Notwithstanding that Papua New Guinea<br />
is still a trust territory, the British are<br />
hopeful for early progress towards agreement<br />
on this matter. I should tell the<br />
House that I questioned repeated assertions<br />
that although the United Kingdom is to<br />
enter the Common Market its bilateral<br />
relationship with Australia would not<br />
change. I can report that I was assured by<br />
Britain's Ministers that there was a pervasive<br />
desire to maintain the closest possible<br />
co-operation with Australia.<br />
During my talk with the Chancellor, I<br />
raised with him my concern that the voluntary<br />
restraint on the movement of British<br />
capital to Australia should not be<br />
maintained, while, at the same time, movements<br />
of capital were liberalised in respect<br />
of the EEC countries with consequent<br />
disadvantage to the traditional flow to Australia.<br />
Members will be glad to learn that I<br />
received an assurance of the fullest consultation<br />
and co-operation before any decisions<br />
are made. When Britain enters the<br />
EEC she will be creating a situation in<br />
which her longstanding trading preferences<br />
in the Australian market will come to an<br />
end. These foregone preferences will be<br />
available to us for bargaining purposes.<br />
our policy in any negotiation of new<br />
arrangements will be based on recognition<br />
of the principle that trade, to be successful<br />
in the world of today, needs to be multilateral.<br />
In my discussions with persons<br />
involved in commerce and industry, I<br />
repeatedly emphasised the point that,<br />
despite some problems, our economy was<br />
fundamentally sound and that we could<br />
look to a long-term annual growth rate of<br />
around 5 per cent or more. These views<br />
were generally well received and British<br />
interests with whom I discussed the matter<br />
continue to regard Australia as a country<br />
of promise and a suitable place for British<br />
investment. Mr Health and I agreed-and<br />
this was followed up later in my talks with<br />
the Minister for Defence and the Foreign<br />
Secretary-that even closer consultation and<br />
communication should be effected between </p>
<p>the two Governments. This included strong<br />
confirmation of the policy that the British<br />
and Australian High Commissioners should<br />
have, when needed, immediate direct<br />
access to the respective Prime Ministers.<br />
At the same time, we would take the<br />
opportunity to step up our direct contact<br />
with other EEC members and strengthen<br />
our representation -in Brussels.<br />
I had useful and wide-ranging discussions<br />
on defence matters with the British<br />
Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence<br />
and the Foreign Secretary. I was assured<br />
that the Heath Government in-tends to<br />
maintain its political interests and defence<br />
commitments in South East Asia. We<br />
reviewed the five-power defence arrangements<br />
for assistance in the defence of Singapore<br />
and Malaysia. The signature of the<br />
new arrangements on 1st November<br />
reflects the readiness of the Heath Government<br />
to make a contribution to the security<br />
and stability of our region which is both<br />
welcome and timely. I am aware that the<br />
British Government is actively considering,<br />
with other Governments in the five power<br />
arrangement, further areas of co-operation<br />
in the defence field. There was also -a close<br />
identity of views on the security of the<br />
Indian Ocean. I was left in no doubt about<br />
British concern for the implications of the<br />
Soviet naval influence in the area.<br />
Mr Heath indicated to me that his Government<br />
intends to maintain a naval presence<br />
in the Indian Ocean. This reaffirms<br />
his statement to the conference of Comnmonwealth<br />
Heads of Government in Singapore<br />
last January. We also had useful<br />
opening discussion directed to increasing<br />
defence co-operation in the Indian Ocean<br />
area and work is proceeding on proposals<br />
about improved procedures for co-ordinating<br />
resources and surveillance. I ws given<br />
a survey of the situation in Western<br />
Europe, includng NATO and was informed<br />
that Britain would maintain -its commitments<br />
to SEATO, in which it still sees, to<br />
use their own words, itself as a ' full<br />
partner'. I want to turn now to some of the mattens<br />
which are common to my visits to<br />
America and Britain. As a result of my<br />
visit, the Australian Government now has<br />
a deeper appreciation of American and<br />
British thinking on a wide range of international<br />
issues of importance to us, such<br />
23253t71-2 as: The British entry in the EEC; the<br />
future of China and Taiwan; the future for<br />
Vietnam and Cambodia; the Soviet presence<br />
in the Indian Ocean; overseas trade;<br />
President Nixon's forthcoming visits to<br />
Moscow and Peking-, the international<br />
monetary situation; and the Rhodesian situation.<br />
For our part, I was able to give<br />
American and British Leaders a clearer<br />
picture of our Government's thinking on<br />
the role we expect to play in the Asian and<br />
Pacific region. And to emphasise that,<br />
while we are a dependable friend, we shall<br />
make our own independent judgments<br />
based upon our own national interests.<br />
I also took the opportunities available to<br />
me in my discussions to emphasise our<br />
changing role in a changing world. I<br />
emphasised the need to take full account<br />
of Japan in the emerging balance between<br />
the United States, China and the Soviet<br />
Union in North Asia. I emphasised the<br />
role we were seeking to play in regional<br />
economic co-operation and regional<br />
defence co-operation in South-East Asia. I<br />
also emphasised the importance of a stable<br />
and peaceful Indonesia in South East Asia<br />
and the weight we give to our relations<br />
with that country. I believe the administration<br />
in the United States, the Government<br />
in Britain and leading representatives of<br />
the media in both countries now have a<br />
greater awareness of Australia-as a<br />
country of stability and increasing<br />
influence in the South East Asian region. I<br />
believe, too, that they may now be more<br />
conscious of the importance and vitality of<br />
Japan and Indonesia in the Asian region.<br />
, Before I left I had been concerned for<br />
some time to find that, perhaps because we<br />
are so far from North America and Europe,<br />
ignorance about Australia and misunderstanding<br />
of some of our policies are still<br />
quite widespread in these areas. For these<br />
reasons, I talked in New York over 2<br />
special lunches to the editorial writers and<br />
correspondents specialising in Foreign<br />
Affairs of ' The New York Times' and of<br />
the Time Life Incorporated. A member of<br />
my party did a similar briefing on Australia's<br />
role in South East Asia for The<br />
Washingyton Post. In London, at a similar<br />
lunch I was able to speak to the editors of<br />
nearly all the main newspapers published<br />
in England. I believe this was worth while<br />
in focusing the interest of leading opinion<br />
formers in the media in the United States </p>
<p>and in Britain on Australia and its prospects<br />
and policies. My mission also<br />
received considerable public notice in the<br />
media of both countries, particularly in the<br />
responsible Press. And I think this, too,<br />
served to project Australia effectively to<br />
the man-in-the-street.<br />
I turn now, Sir, to the international currency<br />
situation, a difficult, unresolved<br />
problem for us all. I discussed the situation<br />
with the President and members of the<br />
Administration in Washington-with the<br />
Prime Minister. and senior Ministers in<br />
London-and with high officials and trading<br />
and financial interests in both<br />
countries. In both Washington and London<br />
I emphasised that Australia wants an early<br />
resolution of the present impasse as being a<br />
matter of the greatest importance for the<br />
whole trading world.<br />
I pointed out the impact which the<br />
United States import surcharge and the<br />
uncertainty about exchange rates has had<br />
on the market for some of our products,<br />
including wool. I mentioned the charges<br />
that temporary expedients could harden<br />
into dogmas and that a widespread slowdown<br />
in economic activity could result.<br />
Unless there is an early, sensible and adequate<br />
readjustment in trade and currency<br />
arrangements, competitive devaluation<br />
could occur, and increasing protectionism<br />
in trade develop, with a consequent threat<br />
to economic stability and growth around<br />
the world. I stressed, particularly in the<br />
United States, the indirect implication for<br />
Australia of any sharp check to economic<br />
growth and trade in third countries, such<br />
as Japan, as a result of the United States'<br />
measures. There were dangers in isolating<br />
Japan, which has to be seen as a country<br />
finding a new role in the world, and particularly<br />
a role in the economic development<br />
of South East Asia. I have made it<br />
clear that, in relation to currency matters,<br />
Australia reserves its position. We will take<br />
our decision when any realignment is settled.<br />
Our decision will be based on the<br />
interests of the Australian economy and<br />
the Australian people. way of world trade in agricultural commodities,<br />
and raised at the highest level the<br />
problems we face in our attempt to export<br />
Australian wool and meat to the United<br />
States. These discussions were followed up<br />
at other levels. There are good grounds for<br />
believing that the United States is seeking<br />
ways of being helpful to us in respect of<br />
both wool and meat.<br />
Sir, in concluding this outline, I think it<br />
would be appropriate to say something<br />
about Australia and where we stand today.<br />
I believe that my visits to New York,<br />
Washington and London did something to<br />
project Australia to a Britain, which is<br />
becoming increasingly involved in Europe,<br />
and an America which is subject to varying<br />
degrees of pressure to withdraw from<br />
its overseas involvement, and to remind<br />
them that they have in the southern hemisphere:<br />
A vigorous, like-minded but independent<br />
friend; a country of great prospect,<br />
of influence and stability in the South<br />
East Asian region; a country willing and<br />
able to make its contribution to a secure<br />
and stable Asian and Pacific area increasing<br />
in economic strength.<br />
I pointed out that we have our problems-<br />
such as inflation and the state of<br />
some of the rural industries-which we<br />
must solve but, at the same time, our<br />
friends should not lose sight of the fundamental<br />
soundness of the economy and the<br />
great promise of this country. For our part<br />
we should concentrate on representing<br />
Australia to the world as a tolerant, stable,<br />
healthy member of the international community-<br />
increasing in size and strength as<br />
it develops, but threatening no-one. I<br />
attempted to do this during my tour.<br />
In short I emphasised that we in the<br />
Government will direct our energies to<br />
building a greater Australia based on selfconfidence,<br />
determination, co-operation,<br />
and a vision of an unlimited future. Mr<br />
Speaker, I recommend that this statement<br />
be studied by members of the Opposition. I<br />
lay on the table the following paper:<br />
In America I urged on the Administra-Visit to the United States and Britain-Ministion<br />
the need to remove barriers in the terial Statement, 23 November 1971.<br />
