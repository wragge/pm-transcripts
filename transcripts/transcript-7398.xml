PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF ' THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE'<br />
CANBERRA 14 SEPTEMBER 1988<br />
Any scholarly project which draws on the work of dozens of<br />
academics working in different fields, and which coordinates<br />
their research in many cases their new research into a<br />
single publication ranging across historical and<br />
contemporary issues must by definition be a important event.<br />
This book does all that, and it is a credit to its editor,<br />
Dr James Jupp, to all its contributors, and to its<br />
publishers Angus and Robertson.<br />
But what makes this book a real tour de force is its subject<br />
matter: nothing less complex, fascinating and significant.<br />
than the Australian people themselves.<br />
with the publication of " The Encyclopedia of the Australian<br />
People", a glaring gap in our understanding of ourselves has<br />
been filled.<br />
Now it can at last be said that the Australian community in<br />
all its diversity and richness has received the<br />
comprehensive and sympathetic scholarly attention it<br />
deserves. In our Bicentennial year, when Australians are giving<br />
renewed consideration to the question of what it means to be<br />
an Australian, this publication is especially welcome<br />
because it provides part of the answer. It helps us to<br />
understand ourselves, our past and the identity we carry<br />
into the future. I commend the Australian Bicentennial<br />
Authority for its financial support of this book; it is a<br />
work of real excellence, which adds great distinction to our<br />
Bicentennial year.<br />
" The Encyclopedia of the Australian People" is a work of<br />
great scholarship. It is an encyclopedia of our current<br />
knowledge of the Australian population and of contemporary<br />
relationships within our society. It is not merely a<br />
catalogue of the cultural and national groups that make up<br />
Australia. it is a history of the Australian people, the<br />
story of a community. J6<br />

<p>James Jupp was extremely well qualified to undertake the<br />
daunting task of compiling this book a task on which he<br />
embarked in 1984. V<br />
Like almost a quarter of the Australian population, Dr Jupp<br />
was an immigrant. He came originally from Britain, and<br />
since coming to Australia has held a number of academic<br />
posts concentrating on the study of Australian immigration<br />
and multiculturalism. His expertise is manifest in the<br />
Encyclopedia's detailed study of the regional cultures of<br />
the English people who formed such a large proportion of<br />
Australian immigrants.<br />
He is also well known as the Chairman of the Committee which<br />
examined Government services in a multicultural society and<br />
indeed which laid down those principles of multiculturalism<br />
which formed the basis of Government policies in this field.<br />
These included the establishment of the office of<br />
Multicultural Affairs. James Jupp has worked closely with<br />
that office and his advice is well respected. So it gives<br />
me great pleasure to announce today that he has agreed to<br />
formalise his relationship by becoming a member of the<br />
Advisory Council on Multicultural Affairs. Dr Jupp will<br />
join the other members for an important meeting this Friday<br />
a meeting at which I will receive from the Advisory<br />
Council their discussion paper on the National Agenda for a<br />
Multicultural Australia.<br />
What this book spells out in compelling and extraordinary<br />
detail is the fact of Australia's ethnic diversity. And may<br />
I say how pleasing it is to see, in a Bicentennial<br />
publication, Australia's Aboriginal and Islander communities<br />
given appropriate and detailed recognition in the<br />
encyclopedia. The scholarship and research bought together<br />
here will be a major information resource, which will be<br />
relevant and valuable for years to come.<br />
There are those today, including some unfortunately who are<br />
based here in Parliament House, who pretend that Australians<br />
can in some way choose whether or not we should be a<br />
multicultural nation. The truth is of course we cannot<br />
choose Australia's multicultural identity is an indelible<br />
part of our social make-up today.<br />
Just as importantly, this ethnic diversity has been a tact<br />
of Australian life for the last two hundred years.<br />
Australians are not really multicultural by choice. Infact,<br />
after reading in this book about the convicts who came<br />
here from Greece, Italy, Hungary, India, Mauritius, Russia,<br />
the West Indies, Egypt, Persia as well as from England,<br />
Scotland, Wales and Ireland you could conclude, from all<br />
these enforced settlers, that in a real and literal sense<br />
Australia became multicultural by conviction. 2007 </p>
<p>This book details Australians of more than 100 different<br />
cultural or national backgrounds: the British, the Irish,<br />
the Greeks, the Italians, the Yugoslavs, the Chinese, the<br />
Vietnamese, the Lebanese as well as some of the lesser<br />
known and smaller groups such as the Kurds, the Manx, the<br />
Seychellois, the Tibetans.<br />
Today, four out of ten Australians are immigrants or their<br />
children half of them from non-English speaking<br />
backgrounds. As James Jupp says in his introduction, " Most<br />
Australians tracing their descent will very quickly come<br />
across ancestors who never lived in Australia and who<br />
possibly had no idea where it was."<br />
In my ' awn case, great-grandparents on both sides of my<br />
family came from Cornwall. I was impressed to see in<br />
" The Encyclopedia of the Australian People" such a lengthy<br />
and informative section devoted to the Cornish men and women<br />
who came to Australia and especially those who created the<br />
mining industries in South Australia. May I say I am proud<br />
to be a descendant of those Cornish miners.<br />
Because what was true of the Co ' rnish experience is true of<br />
dozens of other Australians from other lands and cultures.<br />
AS this book describes, they were motivated to uproot<br />
themselves and their families and to embark on the hazardous<br />
journey to Australia where, upon arrival, through hard work,<br />
they secured the foundation of their own prosperity and the<br />
prosperity of their new land Australia.<br />
And they did this without losing contact with or pride in<br />
their own traditions and ways of life.<br />
That is the Australian achievement that people of<br />
different backgrounds can become Australians if they possess<br />
this sole requirement: commitment to Australia, to its<br />
interests and to its future. That commitment is what unites<br />
this nation of many cultures and many traditions.<br />
The openness of Australians, our willingness and<br />
preparedness to accept people as individuals, to give<br />
everyone a fair go, our tolerance, acceptance and respect<br />
these are not attributes of which to be afraid but<br />
attributes in which we can all take pride.<br />
They are attributes that can't be confected or imposed with<br />
conformist, repressive enjoinders like " One Australia".<br />
That way lies insecurity, friction and division.<br />
We are one Australia because we all have the common<br />
cominent to our country Australia and that Australia<br />
is the stronger, the richer because of the diversity of our<br />
backgrounds and the total absence of any semblance or<br />
suggestion of discrimination in our immigration policies.<br />
And, ladies and gentlemen, I pledge to you that as far as<br />
this Prime Minister and this Government are concerned that<br />
is the way it will remain and unequivocally remain.<br />
2008 </p>
<p>4.<br />
This book will be a valuable resource and reference for many<br />
Australians. It is one of those books that should be read,<br />
by all Australians. It is something which I personally am<br />
very proud to be associated with. I have great pleasure in<br />
launching it.<br />
