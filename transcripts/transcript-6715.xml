PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST ' DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
AUSTRALIAN BICENTENNIAL EXHIBITION MELBOURNE<br />
Vol 6 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
I am delighted to be here today to launch the Australian<br />
Bicentennial Exhibition, a major project in the<br />
Commonwealth Government's National Bicentennial Program.<br />
The Commonwealth will provide $ 19 million towards this<br />
exciting, innovative project with a most significant<br />
contribution of $ 6 million being made by BHP. It is<br />
fitting that Australia's largest company should choose<br />
to support this the largest exhibition ever to tour<br />
Australia. Like BHP, the Bicentenary is an Australian enterprise.<br />
Both the Commonwealth Government and the State and<br />
Territory Governments are shareholders in the<br />
Bicentenary, and all Australians have a special stake in<br />
the planning and implementation of our celebrations in<br />
1988.<br />
Only a few weeks ago I had the pleasure of being present<br />
at BHP's Centenary Dinner. On that occasion I mentioned<br />
how the development of BHP has mirrored the development<br />
of Australia itself. BHP and the strength of the<br />
Australian economy are closely intertwined.<br />
BHP is taking a most welcome initiative through its<br />
commitment to the Bicentenary. The company's generous<br />
contribution to the Exhibition is a mark of its<br />
confidence in this nation. I have no doubt it will<br />
provide an incentive for other Australian companies to<br />
invest in our Bicentenary and I strongly urge them to<br />
join with BHP and the Australian Government and get<br />
behind our celebrations.<br />
The returns on our investment in the Bicentenary will be<br />
substantial and lasting. The dividends will be a<br />
greater pride in our nation, in our heritage, in our<br />
skills and in our achievements. And all Australians </p>
<p>will be the ri ' her for it.<br />
The Bicentenary will also 1 ovide a unique opportunity<br />
for a national stocktake. It will be a time not only<br />
for celebratioi but for reflection, a time to learn from<br />
the past so th~ it we can better plan for the future.<br />
The Bicentennial Program wilL facilitate this process in<br />
a number of exciting ways.<br />
The Terra Australis to Australia Conference will<br />
bring togeth 0 experts in different fields from<br />
around the wqrld to examnine our history and our<br />
relationshipiwith and pe! rception of our unique<br />
environment. The Australian Studies Project will review the<br />
teaching and research of Australian studies in our<br />
schools and tertiary institutions.<br />
An extensive publications program will enrich our<br />
understanding of Australian life and culture.<br />
The Australian Bicentennial Exhibition will invite<br />
Australians throughout the country to participate in<br />
this national stocktake. The Exhibition will offer new<br />
insights into what it means to be an Australian, it will<br />
communicate the uniqueness of our country and its<br />
enterprise, and will tell the story of those who have<br />
shaped our nation. It will also encourage us to turn<br />
our minds to the future through its use of the latest<br />
Australian technology and communications systems. The<br />
Exhibition will be tribute to Australian ingenuity. Its<br />
unique structure will lead the world in-the development<br />
of travelling museum technology and will provide a<br />
legacy long after 1988 has passed.<br />
I believe it is especially important to put on record<br />
* the fact that the Bicentennial Program will provide a<br />
wide range of activities involving the arts,<br />
entertainment and sport;<br />
A feature will be the tall, ships event.<br />
Magnificent sailing ships ' from around the world<br />
will take part in a spectacular parade of sail on<br />
Sydney Harbour on 26 January 1988. While in<br />
Australian waters they will visit many ports around<br />
Australia. There will be special international sporting<br />
events, for example in football, cricket and<br />
cycling. There will be military tattoos and air displays in </p>
<p>capital cities a~ ross the country.<br />
There will be toirs by the very best of Australian<br />
and overseas artists and performing companies.<br />
A major Bicentennial project here in Melbourne<br />
is the construction of a new home for the<br />
Australian Ballet, to which the Commonwealth<br />
and Victorian Governments will each contribute<br />
$ 2.6-million under the Commonwealth/ State<br />
Bicentennial Commemorative Program.<br />
So too will ho-Australian Bicentennial Exhibition<br />
provide a feast of exciting entertainment. Some of the<br />
highlights have already been outlined the theatrical<br />
performances, the concerts, the laser beam displays and<br />
the audiovisuals. There will indeed be something for<br />
everyone.<br />
The planning for the Exhibition is an excellent example<br />
of the way in which the Bicentennial Authority is<br />
developing its projects to achieve something of value<br />
for the Australian community.<br />
Planning for this project began back in 1982. In a cooperative<br />
effort co-ordinated by the Authority, a<br />
Working Group of australian scholars, historians,<br />
business people and advisers from many different fields<br />
came together to develop the proposal as the centrepiece<br />
of the celebrations.<br />
The Exhibition continues to be a product of united<br />
effort. The Commonwealth Department of Housing and<br />
Construction is acting as a project manager for the<br />
design and construction phases. The Exhibition<br />
structure has been designed by one of Australia's<br />
leading architects, Daryl Jackson.<br />
The Australian Bicentennial Authority is seeking<br />
assistance from many other areas of government and<br />
private enterprise in this venture. It is seeking a<br />
selection of unique Australian artefacts and items from<br />
museums and collections around the country.<br />
It is seeking assistance from experts in such fields as<br />
the transport and catering industries; from<br />
manufacturers of technical and display equipment; from<br />
local government authorities who will host the<br />
Exhibition as it traverses the countryside, and most<br />
importantly, it is seeking the participation of<br />
communities across Australia.<br />
In this way and in many others the Exhibition fulfills<br />
the Bicentennial theme of " Living Together". This theme </p>
<p>was chosen to reflect a co-operative effort by every<br />
Australian. It speaks of our rich and varied heritage,<br />
and draws attention to the importance to our way of life<br />
of relations between AustraliaEns of different ethnic<br />
origins, between country and city people, between one<br />
state and another, and between Australia and other<br />
nations. It is a forward looking theme which refers to<br />
a process that is as yet uncompleted.<br />
The Exhibition will carry this message throughout the<br />
nation encouraging the widest possible involvement of<br />
all Australians in our celebrations. It will visit more<br />
than fifty cities And towns in each State and Territory.<br />
Its arrival will provide a stimulus for community<br />
activities and will give a special focus to celebrations<br />
in outback areas.<br />
These activities will be greatly assisted by local<br />
Bicentennial Community Committees, almost 500 of which<br />
have already been established in local government areas<br />
across Australia. The Commonwealth Government and the<br />
Australian Bicentennial Authority are very much aware of<br />
the importance of encouraging this grass roots<br />
involvement in our celebrations. With this in mind, an<br />
amount of $ 17.5 million has been allocated from the<br />
National Prograim funds for the Bicentennial Local<br />
Government Initiative Grants scheme.<br />
The Bicentenary and this Exhibition will also focus<br />
attention on our relationships with our neighbours and<br />
the rest of the world. We can look forward to a<br />
significant international participation in our<br />
Bicentenary.<br />
The Government is of course aware of the recent<br />
criticisms of planning for our Bicentenary. Much of<br />
this has been proposed in a constructive way, and has<br />
been taken account of in our approach to the<br />
Bicentenary. W'hat I believe will be achieved is a<br />
Bicentennial Program that has something for everyone.<br />
It will be both purposeful and exciting. The projects<br />
will be both large and small. They will involve our<br />
whole, diverse community. They will be of lasting<br />
benefit to future generations of Australians. All<br />
Governments will be involved; all political parties<br />
will be involved; private enterprise will be involved;<br />
and above all the people themselves will be involved.<br />
Again, I pay tribute to the generous contribution of BHP<br />
in this venture a venture which will link BHP's<br />
enterprise with the national goals and aspirations for<br />
this special year. And, may I add, the increasing<br />
international vision and involvement of BHIP itself<br />
reflects the fact that our bicentennial celebration will </p>
<p>not be simply introspective but will enable us to see<br />
ourselves as part of an increasingly inter-dependent<br />
world. It is with confidence, pride and pleasure that I now<br />
launch this Australian Bicentennial Exhibition. </p>
