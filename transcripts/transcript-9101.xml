PRIIMNEIS TE<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRJM MINISTER, THE H9ON P. J. KEAT[ NG, MIP<br />
MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT<br />
The Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, Mr Alan Griffiths,<br />
has today tendered to me his resignation from the Ministry. I have advised the<br />
Governor-General to accept the resignation.<br />
Mr Griffiths has informed me that he has serious concerns about possible misuse of<br />
funads he has received for party political purposes, possible misuse of the facilities of<br />
his Melbourne electorate office, and irregularities in documentation relating to<br />
electoral fuind raising and expenditure.<br />
He told me that he had no involvement at all in any of those matters and that his<br />
lawyers are satisfied that on the material presented to them in respect of those matters<br />
in their opinion he is not guilty of any wrongdoing or impropriety. However, Mr<br />
Griffiths has informed me that in the best interests of the Government and the ALP he<br />
has decided to tender his resignation so that these matters can be fiuy investigated.<br />
He has expressed to me his absolute confidence that after that process is concluded his<br />
name will be fully cleared.<br />
The Australian Federal Police have been asked to excamine these matters and determine<br />
whether an investigation is warranted.<br />
In addition to any consideration by the Federal Police, Mr Griffiths has asked me to<br />
arrange for a full investigation by an independent person to determine whether his own<br />
conduct in these matters has met appropriate standards of Ministerial behaviour. He<br />
has expressed confidence that such an inquiry would exonerate him and permit him to<br />
recontest his ministerial position at the earliest opportuity.<br />
I intend to grant Mr Griffths' request for an independent inquiry and have informed<br />
him that I would advise the Caucus not to fill the vacancy until after the investigation is<br />
concluded. At that time, if appropriate, I expect Mr Gr-iffiths to put his name forv~ kd<br />
to the Caucus for re-election to office.<br />
I expect to be in a position to announce new Ministerial arrangenmns next week<br />
Mr Griffths will be available to comment this evening at 7.3Oprn at 4 Treasury Place.<br />
