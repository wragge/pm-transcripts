    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Glad to be here today to announce another $1.5 billion dollars going into our roads, mostly in Perth but also the Bunbury Outer Ring Road. So it's a very big package - congestion busting package - very excited about it.</p>
<p><strong>HOST:</strong></p>
<p>So did we have a win on the scratchies - where did all the money come from?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong></p>
<p>Well you know, we do have stronger revenues for this year's budget and that is because we have a stronger economy. It's because of the big growth in jobs. More people are in work. So more people will be paying tax; fewer people are on unemployment benefits. So this is what happens – you have good economic management, you get stronger growth, more jobs, better jobs and you also get more tax revenues which means you can invest in more infrastructure.</p>
<p>Right now you need it. I mean Perth is growing rapidly. You've got the need to have better roads, better rail. Metronet is a great project. We've already put a lot of money into the airport link already that goes from Morley, from Bayswater I should say.</p>
<p>And now we’re putting money into the Byford extension and the Morley to Ellenbrook extension. So this is a big part of a big project.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>Okay. I’d to ask you about another issue because every year I think millions of Aussies are balking at the price hike of private health insurance and we're damned if we do we're damned if we don't. We tried to get Health Minister Greg Hunt on the show that didn't happen so now you get hit with the question.</p>
<p>People are dropping out of health insurance by the thousands because it is so expensive and there's a huge gap still to pay which puts pressure on our public health system because there's too many people in that system now and the private health companies are making more profits than the big four banks. So what are you going to do to better regulate the industry?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>I don’t think that’s right actually, they're not making more profit than the big four banks. The big four banks are much bigger concerns. But look Kymba, the way they get the cost of private health insurance down is to reduce the costs. And we've been doing a lot of work on that particularly in respect to the cost of prosthetics hips, artificial hips and knees and all of those things are a big part of it.</p>
<p>So, Greg has done a very good job in negotiating with the industry to secure lower costs for all of those implants and other appliances and prosthetics is the term that's used. That's a big part of it. But generally we keep we keep a very close focus on it. And private health insurance, while it rose last year, has risen at the lowest rate for some time.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>But people can’t afford it, Australians can't afford it. Surely the bottom of health insurance is going to fall out if we all go into the public system because you're relying on everybody to stay private. And when we turn 30 we’re forced into it. People aren't having options and no one can afford it. So while there's a profit that's that big the system doesn't work well.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>Are you saying that the private health insurance companies are making unjustifiable profits?</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>Yes. And government can't be regulating that, because if it was working people wouldn't be dropping out in droves.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>Well, as you know they are all businesses and they are competitive. There is a lot of competition in the area. Some of the smaller funds are under enormous pressure actually.</p>
<p>So, I don't think in a business sector like this the thing that we've got to do is try to ensure that the costs of all of the various services that are insured for and I mention prosthetics because that is a very big part of it because we're all living longer and more healthily and that means people are getting hip replacements and so forth right into their 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>And reducing the cost of all those devices has been a big part of it. But I'll make sure you get Greg on the show and a lot of it is a big issue.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>Yes please, give him a call.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>I have a lot of questions. Health insurance is a big issue.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>Well you should! I can see it is, but the thing we're talking about today, I'm just happy to get back to it for everyone listening. Many of the people listening will be caught in traffic and they'll be pleased to know we're putting this money to work with the state government.</p>
<p>I'll be announcing it with Mark McGowan today day and we're talking about $5.5 billion collectively between us going into congestion busting in Western Australia.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's with us, and I have an apology to make Mr. Prime Minister, because a couple of weeks ago I did tweet when you appeared amongst our wonderful swim team to struggle with the words to You’re The Voice, so I went to JB Hi-Fi last night - I’ve got you a gold limited edition copy of John Farnham’s album.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>Ok, excellent that’s great – thank you.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>That’s Whispering Jack the biggest selling Australian domestically sold album ever. That’s for you and Lucy to have a Friday sing along.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>We do a traditional Friday sing along here but the album has the lyrics there for you. Would you be keen to join in with us?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>Well you know, I don't actually sing very often. There's a reason for that.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>We don’t sing often either. And can I just say unlike most Australians, I admire you more when you don’t know the words to some of these songs. You’re not on your own, don’t worry. </p>
<p><strong>HOST:</strong></p>
<p>I've railroaded you in by just want to apologise for tweeting about you not knowing the words.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>Yeah that's alright. You can tweet away, everyone else does.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>Here’s the song.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>You were playing Olivia Newton-John before.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>That was Kymba singing that.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>What’s your favourite Olivia Newton-John song?</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>I wouldn’t even know an Olivia Newton-John song... other than Let’s Get Physical.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>I Honestly Love You.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>Hopelessly Devoted To You.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>Do Grease songs count as Olivia Newton-John songs?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You look a bit like John Travolta.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>See you come on the show and think you come on this show and think you’re going to talk about billions of dollars to ease congestion and GST but…</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>Well what's your favourite song on this on this album?</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>: </p>
<p>It’s got to be Pressure Down.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>Yeah I was just thinking. That is one of the great classics.</p>
<p><strong>HOST:</strong></p>
<p>Touch of Paradise, that beautiful Ross Wilson song.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>Did we mention the Ellenbrook train line or pass over that?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>The Ellenbrook train line. Yes.  You know you should be really proud of what's happened in Perth with public transport and I'm really proud that we're helping with it and supporting it.</p>
<p>Because it's only very recently that others are the big cities in Australia have been building urban rail and Perth got going on it - how long how long did it really get started again? Would it be 15 years ago?</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>As in Ellenbrook or the train line itself?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>The train-line…</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>Almost a generation ago now.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>Yeah. They are really getting into it in New South Wales and we’re supporting a big new rail project there in western Sydney and obviously a big new one in Melbourne that we're going to build in partnership with the state government out to Tullamarine.</p>
<p>But Perth has really led the way and it's a great credit I think to Western Australia that it has been forward looking in terms of urban rail and we're really pleased to be able to support it very substantially now.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>Well 11 days to the budget. Next time we get you in we'll have another crack at getting you to sing in public. Enjoy your album.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>The good line in You’re The Voice of course is for the Treasurer – “we’ve got to make ends meet before we get much older”.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>ScoMo are you listening?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>That’s the classic line. I was struggling to remember that the other day on radio.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>: </p>
<p>You've got more important things to do to be honest.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER</strong>:</p>
<p>Yeah. Well thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>HOST</strong>:</p>
<p>Always a pleasure to have you and good on you. Good to see you.</p>
