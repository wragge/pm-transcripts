EMBARGO 0001 AM TUESDAY 8 MARCH 1994<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING, MP<br />
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'$ DAY<br />
Today is a significant day on the international calendar, commemorating the<br />
achievements of women the world over who have contributed to improving<br />
the status of women.<br />
International Women's Day is especially significant for Australian women this<br />
year as the nation celebrates the centenary of women's suffrage and<br />
commemorates the struggles of earlier generations of women to gain<br />
fundamental democratic rights.<br />
International Women's Day provides an opportunity to consider the gains<br />
which have been made, as well as where further action is needed, to Improve<br />
women's lives and opportunities.<br />
Over the last 12 months, the Commonwealth Government has acted on the<br />
issues that Australian women have nominated as their most pressing<br />
concerns. Since launching the Government's New National Agenda -for<br />
Women in February last year, progress has been made in a number of crucial<br />
areas. Employment Historically, International Women's Day recognises the efforts of those who<br />
have fought for women's rights in employment. At the beginning of this<br />
century, women garment workers in the United States were striking for better.<br />
pay and working conditions and, at the first Australian Women's Day rally in<br />
1928, -women called for equal pay for equal work and an eight hour working<br />
day.<br />
The new Industrial Relations Reform Act ( 1993), which comes into effect at<br />
the end of this month, makes a significant contribution to the Government's<br />
achievements in the employment and industrial relations arenas. in addition<br />
to legislating to ensure that all workers in Australia have access to key<br />
minimum entitlements in employment, the new Act will introduce a range of<br />

mechanisms to ensure that enterprise bargaining is accessible and fair for<br />
women. Discriminatory provisions in new awards and enterprise agreements were<br />
made unlawful under amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act in 1992. The<br />
new Indtustrial Relations Reform Act takes this reform even further by<br />
ensuring that discriminatory provisions in awards cannot be deemed to be in<br />
the " public interest". The Act also requires that an annual report be made to<br />
the Minister for Industrial Relations on the impact of enterprise bargaining on<br />
women. Under the new Industrial Relations Act, the Industrial Relations Commission<br />
will, in addition, be able to make orders to ensure that men and women<br />
receive equal remuneration for work of equal value, including, for the first<br />
time, In the over award area which is especially important for women.<br />
Carling for Children<br />
The Government is taking steps to recognise the unpaid work of women<br />
caring full-time for children. The Government will introduce the Home Child<br />
Care Allowance of up to $ 30 a week. This payment will provide an<br />
independent source of income for women in unpaid employment in the home.<br />
It will not be income tested on family income.<br />
The Home Child Care Allowance will replace the Dependent Spouse Rebate<br />
which Is currently paid as a tax rebate to the spouse in employment, usually<br />
the husband. The replacement of a tax concession with a cash payment has<br />
many advantages for women. First, the payment can be made directly to the<br />
person with primary responsibilities for caring for the children, usually the<br />
mother. Second, some 55,000 low income families who do not pay enough<br />
tax to get the full value of the Dependent Spouse Rebate will now be entitled<br />
to the direct payment. And finally, up to 120,000 families will be able to claim<br />
the new payment as soon as their circumstances change, such as when a<br />
woman leaves work to have a baby, rather than waiting for a new financial<br />
year as is the case now..<br />
Currently, most working families do not receive any assistance from the<br />
Government In paying for child care. The introduction of the Child Care<br />
Rebate on 1 July this year will provide long overdue recognition of the high<br />
cost of child care for many working families.<br />
A rebate of up to '$ 28 a week for one child and $ 61 for two or more children<br />
will be available. The full rebate will be payable where families have spent<br />
$ 110 a week on child care for one child or $ 220 for two or more.<br />
There has been some criticism that the Child Care Rebate is unfair as it will<br />
not be income tested. The Government's view is that the cost of child care<br />
should be treated similarly to other expenses workers incur in earning an<br />
income, expenses such as the payment of union dues, the cost of the<br />
membership of professional associations and the cost of protective clothing. </p>
<p>118. Mr .94 S: 3 No 0C1.<br />
Such expenses are treated as tax deductions and are not income tested. The<br />
criticisms against the general child care rebate seem to imply that expenses<br />
born, by and large, by women workers are somehow less worthy of<br />
recognition than the more traditional costs incurred primarily by male<br />
workers. Stopping violence against women<br />
This Government has been the first to tackle, at a national level, community<br />
attitudes to violence against women. We have launched hard hitting<br />
education and publicity campaigns which emphasise merls responsibility for<br />
their violence.<br />
We are also tackling the issue of gender bias in the legal system. The<br />
Government has provided funding to the Australian Institute of Judicial<br />
Administration and the Family Court to conduct gender awareness programs<br />
for judges, magistrates and court personnel.<br />
The Australian Law Reform Commission was also asked to report on<br />
women's equality before the law and its Interim report was tabled in<br />
Parliament last week.<br />
This reference generated an unprecedented level of public interest.<br />
Hundreds of women from around the country came forward to recount their<br />
experience of the legal system. A particular focus was the link between<br />
violence against women and their lack of access to justice. Many women<br />
drew attention to serious difficulties they have in gaining protection from, or<br />
redress for, violence against them.<br />
The Government will be considering the recommendations of the Interim<br />
Report, including the establishment of a National Women's Justice Program<br />
to meet the needs of women for legal advice, Information and advocacy as<br />
well as for greater opportunities to effect the development of new laws.<br />
We are also working with the States and Territories to achieve national<br />
consistency in domestic violence legislation.<br />
And we have given priority to the safety of women escaping violence, with<br />
funding for programs to assist women in rural and remote areas and with<br />
ongoing funding for women's refuges.<br />
Women's Health<br />
The Government is proud that Australia now has among the best breast and<br />
cervical cancer screening programs in the world.<br />
With improved breast cancer screening underway, we are now seeking<br />
further improvements in the way treatment and care are provided to women </p>
<p>I EL . Mar 94 : 352 L LY<br />
diagnosed with cancer. Our aim must be to get the system right and to make<br />
sure women have much better information about treatment options and a real<br />
ability to choose what best suits their condition.<br />
Commonwealth and State Health Ministers have made the tight against<br />
breast cancer a priority. They are soon to release a National Health Policy<br />
discussion paper for extensive consultations, including with women and<br />
women's organisations. The paper will propose a national goal to reduce<br />
deaths from the disease and invites views on strategies to achieve that goal.<br />
The strategies include improved diagnostic, treatment and support services,<br />
better access to services, as well as enhanced clinical and other research.<br />
Choice and Equity<br />
Essentially the Government's policies are about providing women with<br />
greater choice and backing up those choices with supportive employment,<br />
income and child care arrangements.<br />
The proposals under consideration in the context of the Green Paper on<br />
Restoring Full Employment are about making sure that women have access<br />
to job and training opportunities and that appropriate support is provided for<br />
those who choose to remain outside the paid labour force to care for children.<br />
I recently hosted a meeting of over 40 national women's non-government<br />
organisations to obtain their views on the Green Paper proposals and other<br />
priority issues. These Round Table consultations, with a broad range of<br />
women's organisations, will take place twice yearly to ensure that women's<br />
voices are heard on major policy issues. They are a new addition to the<br />
measures I have adopted to ensure that Government policy is sensitive to<br />
women's needs and reflects women's views and priorities.<br />
Conclusion Earlier this year I said that one of the great reconciliations underway in<br />
Australian society is the reconciliation between men and women over roles<br />
and responsibilities and the enhanced opportunities for womerf participation<br />
in the workforce and society generally. On a day when we commemorate the<br />
undeniable and irresistible momentum that has changed forever the<br />
opportunities available to women, it is Important to remember also that such<br />
changes demand greater flexibility and understanding by men and women.<br />
Without a doubt, Australia benefits from womerfs greater participation in the<br />
economic, social and family life of the nation. It Is incumbent upon the<br />
Government to find ways to promote real choice and equity for women and<br />
also to support women and men in coming to terms with the changes.<br />
