    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thank you very much. To my good friend John Caputo, thank you for those very warm words of welcome. To the Italian Consul-General, to my fellow parliamentarians of both sides of politics, and I think they may forgive me for sending a particular welcome to Connie who has just joined us in the Federal Senate.</p>
<p>This day marks the 59th anniversary of the establishment of the Italian Republic in 1946, but for years now it has become the occasion on which the rest of your fellow Australians pay tribute and pay honour to the enormous contribution of Australians of Italian descent to the building of the modern Australia. And I'm here today to express on behalf, not of the Government, but I know of the nation, in a genuinely bipartisan way, the great affection we have for those of you who've contributed so much to our country. Many of you, of course, were born in Italy; many of you weren't. But whether you were born in Italy or were born in Australia of Italian parents, it has made no difference.</p>
<p>You have achieved that remarkable double of retaining in a corner of your heart an affection for, and a natural love of, the country of your heritage, but at the same time you have given so much to Australia. And as we look around we think of the contribution that Australians of Italian descent have made to our country in every field of human endeavour in Australia - whether it's business, it's politics, it is sport, it is music, it is cuisine, it is other forms of entertainment. Whatever the activity, you will find people with an Italian heritage there making a wonderful contribution. And when the rest of you fellow Australians think of the relationship between Australia and Italy, they do so with a smile on their face and with a great deal of warmth in their heart because that is the nature of the relationship - it's close, it's affectionate, and it's very genuine.</p>
<p> The modern Italy, of course, has a very strong commercial and trade and economic relationship with the modern Australia. The greatest asset we have, the greatest link we have, is of course based upon the common values that we share. In the history of Italy today marks the celebration of Italian democracy, and, of course, as nations, Australia and Italy are united in our commitment to democracy. It hasn't been a bad year for democracy around the world. We've seen it break out in a number of places where we thought we mightn't have ever seen it. We saw that wonderful demonstration in the Ukraine of the people standing up and demanding democracy. We've seen it spread in the Middle East. We've seen the wonderful transformation to democratic ways in other parts of the world. But we Australians, and along with the people of Italy, are very committed to the values of democracy.</p>
<p> But finally can I say, of all the bonds that we have, none of course is more important than the human bonds, the people-to-people bonds - the passion we have, that you have for your links with what is still to many of you, and understandably so, the old country. The rest of your Australian citizens understand that. We thank you for your massive contribution to the modern Australia. We thank you very much for what the Italian heritage has meant to the overall Australian heritage. It's been a wonderful contribution, and today all of us join in unconditionally celebrating it. I hope you have a wonderful day, and thank you for your contribution to our nation.</p>
