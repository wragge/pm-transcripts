PRIME MINISTER 62/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME~ MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING<br />
Cabinet met last night to consider further Australia's response to President Chirac's<br />
announcement on 13 June that France would resume nuclear testing in the<br />
South Pacific.<br />
Cabinet's deliberations were against the background of the French rejection of the<br />
efforts of the South Pacific Forum delegation, led by Senator Evans, to persuade<br />
Franco not to proceed with the tests.<br />
Australia's response to the French decision has been strong, unequivocal and concrete,<br />
The Government has attacked the decision in very strong terms first in a statement I<br />
issued on 14 June immediately following on President Chirac's announcement<br />
deploring the decision. I announced in that statement that the Government had frozen<br />
cooperation with France in the defence field. The language of that statement was<br />
repeated by the Foreign Minister, in Japan at the time, in a series of press conferences,<br />
and in a direct telephone conversation with the French Foreign Minister,<br />
Mr Ilerve de Charette. The Acting Foreign Minister called in the French Ambassador<br />
and issued a formal protest and our Ambassador did likewise in Paris.<br />
The Government has also taken the lead in promoting a strong South Pacific regional<br />
action. On 15 June, I issued a statement as Chair of the Forum condemning the<br />
French decision, after consultations with my fellow South Pacific Forum heads of<br />
government. On 19 June Senator Evans led a delegation of Forum reprcsentatives<br />
which conveyed direct to the French Government the region's condemnation of the<br />
decision and the deep resentment it has aroused in the whole region.<br />
The Government gave instructions to its embassies abroad to make our position<br />
known on the French decision. Many countries have expressed their opposition to the<br />
tests, including a number of our closest neighbours.<br />
Australia has also made active use of multilateral forums to leave no doubt as to<br />
where we stand on this issue. We have expressed our outrage at the French decision<br />
in the United Nations in New York, as well as the International Atomic Energy<br />
Agency in Vienna and the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. </p>

On 19 June I made a speech in Parliament setting out the Governimcnt's views on the<br />
decision and Australia's relationship with France.<br />
Concerned about flow-on consequences of the French decision, I have instructed our<br />
Ambassador in Washington to welcome the continued US commitment to its<br />
moratorium and urge the United States to maintain its leadership in negotiating a<br />
Comprehensive ' Test B~ an Treaty ( CTBT) in terms acceptable not only to the nuclear<br />
weapon statcs but thc widcr international community Our Ambassadors in Beijing,<br />
London and Moscow will also be making representations to the other nuclear weapon<br />
states in favour of the moratorium on testing and early conclusion of the CTBT.<br />
By any measure this amounts to an unequivocal response. I am in no doubt that the<br />
French are clear about our views.<br />
Last night, Cabinet after hearing a report and recommendations from Senator Evans<br />
decided upon a series of further measures now to be taken and in the light of the<br />
outcome of the Forum delegation's visit to France. Covering actions at the bilateral,<br />
regional and global level, thcse measures are in line with the Government's consistent<br />
policy on this issue which has been to respond in a measured, graduated way, leaving<br />
open every avenue for France to respond to South Pacific concerns.<br />
The flil details of the proposed measures are set out in the attachment. In broad<br />
outline, they are as follows:<br />
The Government has decided that Australia's Ambassador in Paris is to be recalled<br />
for urgent consultations and briefing on how Australia can best continue to react<br />
to the French decision.<br />
e The Government has decided to extend the curtailment of defence contacts with<br />
France in the areas of ship and aircraft visits, training, senior officer visits, material<br />
acquisition, and defence-related agreements and arrangements. The senior ADF<br />
representative in Paris will be recalled. ( In relation to the curtailment of aircraft<br />
visits, Defence will take the operational steps required to continue to provide the<br />
samne level of maritime surveillance to the Pacific Island countries.)<br />
a The Gove'rnment will convene a special meeting of South Pacific Environment<br />
Ministers to discuss the environmental impact of testing.<br />
9 The Government will be consulting with Forum countries on possible regional<br />
measures including the suspension of France's status as a South Pacific Forum<br />
dialogue partner for the duration of testing; a possible boycott by individual<br />
Forum countries of the South Pacific Games to be held in French Polynesia in<br />
August; and the formation of a Forum Regional Action Commiittee to coordinate<br />
responses to France's decision, mobilise and support community campaigns in<br />
Forum countries, and report to the Madang Forum in September.<br />
' t'he Government will1 be conisulting with Forum countries on thc desirability of a<br />
public information campaign being mobilised in France to sensitise public opinion<br />
to the strength of regional opposition to French testing and the reasons for it. </p>
<p>TEL: Jun 21): 40 rlo 0 F 0&gt;<br />

a At a wider international level, Australian delegations and representatives will take<br />
advantage of all available opportunities to register Australian and regional<br />
opposition to French testing in the UN and all other appropriate multilateral<br />
bodies, including where appropriate through the initiation of resolutions.<br />
A high-level officials mission will be sent to nuclear weapons states to argue the<br />
case for an acceptably drafted and quickly negotiated CTI3T.<br />
While it is not proposed to embark upon any trade or other direct economic<br />
restrictions, it should be noted that the existing policy of entering into no new<br />
contracts for the sale of uranium to France until France enters into a Comprehensive<br />
Test Ban Treaty will remain in force,<br />
The Government will keep the implementation and impact of the above measures<br />
under close review in the months ahead. We are determined to do everything we<br />
possibly and reasonably can to ensure that France understands the nature and extent<br />
of Australian and South Pacific opposition to its test resumiption decision, and acts<br />
accordingly. CANBERRA 23 June 1995 </p>
