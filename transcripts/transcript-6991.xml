PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
LABOR BUSINESS FORUM<br />
ADELAIDE 27 AUGUST 1986<br />
THAN'.( YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN DIRECTLY TO YOU<br />
JUST N-OW THE BUDGET MEETS AUSTRALIA'S CURRENT ECONOMIC<br />
CIRCUPS7TANCES. BECAUSE IT IS UNQUESTIONABLY THE RIGHT<br />
BUDGET FOR AUSTRALIA TODAY.<br />
IT IS IMPORTANT TO RESTATE AT THE OUTSET, BECAUSE SOME IN<br />
THE OPPOSITION NOW SEEK TO DENY IT, THAT THE VERY CONDITION<br />
FOR AUSTRALIA'S CAPACITY TO MEET THE CHALLENGES WE NOW FACE<br />
TOGETHER IS THE CO-OPERATION OF ALL SECTIONS OF THE<br />
COMMUNITY BUT ESPECIALLY BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS, BUSINESS AND<br />
UNIONS. THIS IS NO LESS TRUE NOW THAN IT HAS BEEN FOR THE<br />
PAST THREE AND A HALF-YEARS. IN FACT, IF ANYTHING, THE NEED<br />
FOR THA. T CO-OPERATION IS NOW ALL THE GREATER.<br />
THROUGHOUT THE PAST WEEK, PAUL KEATING AND I, TOGETHER WITH<br />
OUR SENIOR COLLEAGUES, HAVE UNDERTAKEN THE RESPONSIBILITY' OF<br />
EXPLifkXNING TO THE PEOPLE 0F AUSTRALIA THE NATURE OF OUR<br />
PRESE2NT PROBLEMS, AND THE ECONOMIC STRATEGY NEEDED TO MEET<br />
AND OVERCOME THOSE PROBLEM~ S.<br />
THE BUDGET, CRUCIAL AS IT IS, IS ONLY PART OF THAT STRATEGY.<br />
LET HE SAY EMPHATICALLY, THAT THE TASK MY COLLEAGUES AND I<br />
HAVE UNDERTAKEN IS NOT SOME SORT OF POLITICAL EXERCISE TO<br />
" SELL" THE BUDGET. WE SEEK TO PUT TO THE NATION FAIRLY<br />
AND SQUARELY THE ECONOMIC REALITIES WE NOW FACE. BUT<br />
HAVING DONE THAT, WE SEEK ALSO TO M4AKE PLAIN THAT NOT ONLY<br />
DO WE RECOGNISE THE NATURE OF THE TASK BUT ALSO THAT WE HAVE<br />
THE POLICIES TO SEE US THROUGH.<br />
AND, CERTAINLY AS FAR AS THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA ARE<br />
CONCERNED, WE HAVE BEEN HEARTENED BY THE NATURE OF THEIR<br />
RESPONSE. IN A~ LL THE RESPONSIBLE SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY OVER AND<br />
BEYOND THE PREDICTABLE REACTION OF THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION<br />
AND ThE SELECTIVE CRITICISMS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST GROUPSTHAT<br />
RESPONSE HAS BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE.<br />
IT HAS BEEN THE RESPONSE OF A MATURE AND INTELLIGENT PEOPLE. </p>
<p>IT HAS BEEN A RESPONSE BASED UPON A CLEAR RECOGNITION OF THE<br />
REALITIES. IT HAS BEEN A RESPONSE BASED UPON A REALISATION OF THE<br />
IRRELEVANCE TO USE THE KINDEST TERM OF THE ALTERNATIVE<br />
OFFERED BY THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION.<br />
AND ABOVE ALL, IT HAS BEEN THE RESPONSE OF A PEOPLE WILLING<br />
TO ACCEPT THE POSTPONEMENT OF SHORT-TERM BUT ILLUSORY<br />
BENEFITS FOR TIIE SAKE OF LONGER-TERM AND ENDURING GAIN NOT<br />
JUST FOR THEMSELVES, BUT FOR THEIR COUNTRY AS A WHOLE AND<br />
FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF AUSTRALIANS.<br />
I AM CONVINCED MORE THAN EVER OVER THE PAST WEEK THAT<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS RESPOND IN THIS WAY: BUT<br />
ON ONE CONDITION, AND ONLY ON ONE CONDITION.<br />
AND THAT CONDITION IS THIS: THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA nUST BE<br />
ABLE TO BELIEVE, AFTER ALL THE RELEVANT M4ATTERS ARE PUT TO<br />
THEM, FAIRLY AND SQUARELY, THAT THE TOUGH DECISIONS THEY ARE<br />
CALLED UPON TO ACCEPT ARE THE DECISIONS OF A GOVERNMENT ON<br />
THE RIGHT TRACK. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEY 14UST BE<br />
CONVINCED THANT PRESENT SACRIFICES ARE THE PRICE WE MUST ALL<br />
PAY FOR HOPE AND CONFIDENCE IN A STRONGER, BETTER FUTURE.<br />
AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS NOW THE UNDERSTANDING AND<br />
CONVICTION OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
IN PARTICULAR, I BELIEVE THEY HAVE COME TO UNDERSTAND, EVEN<br />
MORE CLEARLY THAN BEFORE, THAT AUSTRALIA IS NOW BETTER ABLE<br />
TO DEAL WITH OUR PRESENT STRAITENED TRADING CONDITIONS ONLY<br />
BECAUSE THEIR GOVERNMENT WAS SO EARLY COMMITTED TO<br />
DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING-. ECONOMIC REFORMS TO MAKE THIS<br />
COUNTRY BETTER EQUIPPED TO COMPETE ON WORLD MARKETS. IF IT<br />
HAD NOT BEEN FOR THIS VISION, AUSTRALIA WOULD NOW BE FACING<br />
A VERY REAL PROSPECT OF A PROLONGED AND DEEP ECONOMIC<br />
RECESSION. INSTEAD, WE ARE IN A POSITION TO FACE UP TO<br />
THESE CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES WITH GROWING CONFIDENCE.<br />
THAT IS THE REAL MESSAGE OF THE BUDGET. THAT IS OUR MESSAGE<br />
OF THE PAST WEEK. IT IS MY MESSAGE TO YOU TODAY.<br />
OF COURSE, THIS IS NOT A NEW MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH<br />
AUSTRALIA. JUST TWO WEENS AGO I CAME TO THIS CITY AND HAD THE PLEASURE<br />
OF OUTLINING JUST THIS MESSAGE TO A SEMINAR CONDUCTED BY THE<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN EXPORTERS ASSOCIATION. THE PARTICIPANTS AT<br />
THE SEMINAR WERE EXPORTERS WHO WERE KEENLY AWARE OF THE<br />
TRADING ENVIRONMENT THAT WE NOW FACE.<br />
THEY ARE PEOLE WHO HAVE TO CONFRONT EVERY DAY OF THEIR<br />
LIVES THE REALITY THAT THE PRICES THAT WE ARE RECEIVING FOR<br />
THE GOODS WHICN WE EXPORT ARE PITIFULLY LOW.<br />
MEASURED AGAINST A BASKET OF WORLD CURRENCIES, METALS PRICES<br />
FELL BY ABOUT 17 PER CENT, ON AVERAGE, OVER THE COURSE OF<br />
1985-86. </p>
<p>NON-FOOD AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS PRICES DECLINED BY 15 PER<br />
CENT. IN JUST THE JUNE QUARTER WHEAT PRICES FELL 23 PER<br />
CENT IN $ US TERMS AND THE DECLINE HAS CONTINUED SINCE.<br />
THE DECLINE IN WHEAT PRICES IS A PARTICULARLY HARD PILL FOR<br />
AUSTRALIANNS TO SWALLOW. IT REFLECTS NOT ONLY THE CONDITION<br />
OF WORLD EXCESS SUPPLY IN WHEAT. IT REFLECTS ALSO AN<br />
UNFORTUNATE AND, FOR ALL CONCERNED, A VERY COSTLY CHANGE IN<br />
THE TRADING PRACTICES OF OUR CLOSEST ALLY, THE UNITED<br />
STATES. THIS CHANGE WAS IN TURN A REACTION TO THE DISASTROUS<br />
POLICIES OF THE EUROPEANS. FIRST, THE EUROPEANS SOUGHT SELF<br />
SUFFICIENCY BUT WENT FAR BEYOND THAT GOAL. IN THE PROCESS<br />
THEY CONSTRUCTED AN EDIFICE OF AGRICULTURAL PRICE SUPPORT<br />
WHICH RISKS UNDERMINING WORLD TRADE IN AGRICULTURAL<br />
PRODUCTS. THE COSTS OF THESE POLICIES ARE NOW BEING SHEETED<br />
HOME DRAFIATICALLY TO EFFICIENT SUPPLIERS SUCH AS AUSTRALIA.<br />
THEY ARE ALSO TELLING HUGELY AGAINST THE COUNTRIES WHICH<br />
INITIATED THEM. THE CITIZENS OF THE SUBSIDISING COUNTRIES<br />
ARE PAYING VIA MASSIVELY BLOATED BUDGETS, HUGELY<br />
MISALLOCATED RESOURCES, AND, IN THE CASE OF THE EUROPEANS,<br />
TRAGICALLY SWOLLEN UNEMPLOYMENT QUEUES.<br />
IT WILL. TAKE MANY YEARS FOR THESE WRONGS TO BE UNDONE, EVEN<br />
IF WE TIERE TO START PURPOSEFULLY TOMORROW. IT IS FOR THAT<br />
REASON THAT THE CURRENT MEETING OF AGRICULTURE MINISTERS IN<br />
CAIRNS A\ ND THE FORTHCOMING NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT THE RULES<br />
WHICH GOVERN WORLD TRADE UNDER THE GATT, ARE VITAL. BUT WE<br />
SHOULD NOT HAVE UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS ABOUT EARLY<br />
SUCCESS. IN THE NEANTINE, OF COURSE, AUSTRALIA HAS TO COPE WITH THE<br />
SITUATION AS IT IS. IT IS NOT JUST AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS<br />
WHICH AR'S BRINGING DEPRESSED PRICES. AS I SAID EARLIER,<br />
MANY METALS, MINERALS AND FUELS ARE ALSO SUFFERING. THE<br />
CONSEQUENCE IS THAT AUSTRALIA'S TERMS OF TRADE AN OVERALL<br />
MEASURE OF THE PURCHASING POWER OF OUR EXPORTS, AND THUS OF<br />
OUR LIVING STANDARDS HAVE FALLEN BY SOME 15 PER CENT SINCE<br />
THE END OF 1984.<br />
IF THE FURTHER DECLINE IN THE TERMS OF TRADE WHICH IS<br />
FORECAST IN THE BUDGET FOR 1986-87 EVENTUATES, AUSTRALIA'S<br />
TERMS OF TRADE WILL SINK TO THEIR LOWEST SINCE THE 19301S.<br />
INITIALLY THE BURDEN IS BEING BORNE BY OUR EXPORTERS. BUT<br />
IT CANNOT ULTIMATELY BE BORNE ONLY BY THEM.<br />
THE DECLINE IN OUR TERMS OF TRADE TO DATE IS CURRENTLY<br />
COSTING AUSTRALIA $ 6 BILLION PER ANNUM. IT IS A LOSS IN OUR<br />
NATIONAL ECONOM4IC CAPACITY WHICH WE CAN IGNORE ONLY TO OUR<br />
COST. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, THE ECONOMY WILL ADJUST. WE CAN CHOOSE<br />
HOW WE COPE WITH THE NEW ENVIRONMENT WE CANNOT CHOOSE<br />
WHETHER WE WILL ADJUST FOR ADJUST WE MUST. </p>
<p>THIS BUDGET REFLECTS THE CHOICE OF THIS GOVERNMENT TO OPT<br />
FOR THE ADJUSTMENT PATH WHICH WILL GIVE US THE BEST PROSPECT<br />
OF AVOIDING MASSIVE, PROLONGED RECESSION AND MASSIVE,<br />
PROLONGED UNEMPLOYMENT.<br />
INDEED THE DECLINE IN OUR TERMS OF TRADE HAS HIGHLIGHTED<br />
ANOTHER QUITE FUNDAMENTAL LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT.<br />
THAT is THAT WHILE AUSTRALIA HAS BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN A<br />
HIGH LEVEL OF CURRENT CONSUMPTION IT HAS ONLY BEEN ABLE TO<br />
DO SO BY BORROWING MORE FROM ABROAD. LAST YEAR WE SPENT, AS<br />
A NATION, 6 PER CENT MORE THAN WE EARNED. o<br />
WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO DRAW ON OTHER PEOPLE's SAVINGS TO THAT<br />
EXTENT TC FINANCE OUR OWN LIVING STANDARDS. WE NEED TO<br />
BEGIN NOW BY TAKING A TEMPORARY CUT IN THOSE STANDARDS AND<br />
TO BOOST OUR DOMESTIC SAVING EFFORT.<br />
WE NEED, ALSO, OVER THE LONGER-TERM TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF<br />
OUR EARNINGS FROM ABROAD. INDEED THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN<br />
REGAIN OUR FORMER GROWTH IN STANDARDS IS TO TRADE OUR WAY<br />
OUT I. E. TO EXPORT MORE AND TO SWITCH AWAY FROM IMPORTED<br />
GOODS TO ' COST COMPETITIVE DOMESTICALLY CRAFTED ALTERNATIVES.<br />
THIS UNAVOIDABLE REALITY HAS CLEARLY BEEN RECOGNISED BY THE<br />
FOREIGN r-. XCHANGE MARKET AND IS REFLECTED IN THE 40 PER CENT<br />
FALL IN 4' TE VALUE OUR CURRENCY AGAINST THE AVERAGE OF OUR<br />
TRADING PARTNERS AND, INDEED, A 50 PER CENT FALL AGAINST<br />
THE YEN. I<br />
THESE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE UNLEASHED THE MOST POWERFUL<br />
INSTRUME'T OF ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT WHICH IS AVAILABLE IN<br />
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE: A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN OUR<br />
INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS.<br />
THE QUESTION FOR US IS:-WHAT WE DO ABOUT THE CHALLENGES<br />
THESE FACTORS PRESENT US WITH? AND HOW DO WE MAKE THE MOST<br />
OF THE OPPORTUNITIES WHICH THEY PROVIDE?<br />
THE RESPONSE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE NEEDS TO COME AT<br />
SEVERAL LEVELS. IN RECOGNITION OF THAT REALITY, GOVERNMENT<br />
POLICY IS DIRECTED AT SEVERAL LEVELS.<br />
THE BUDGET IS QUITE FUNDAMENTAL IN EACH CASE.<br />
WHEN I LAST SPOKE IN THIS CITY, I SAID THAT THE THEN<br />
FORTHCOI-rlIG BUDGET WOULD BE A TOUGH ONE. I CHARACTERISED IT<br />
AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR OUR FUTURE AND THAT OF OUR CHILDREN. I<br />
SAID THAT IT GAVE ME NO JOY TO FORESHADOW A TOUGH BUDGET BUT<br />
THAT NO OTHER COURSE WAS OPEN TO A RESPONSIBLE OR FAIR<br />
GOVERNMENT DEDICATED TO MAXIMISING LONG-TERM JOB PROSPECTS.<br />
THE BUDGET HAS DELIVERED HANDSOMELY ON THOSE PROMISES. THE<br />
CENTRE-PIECE OF THE BUDGET IS ZERO REAL GROWTH IN<br />
COMMONWEALTH OUTLAYS. THAT WAS NOT EASILY ACHIEVED. POLICY<br />
DECISIONS SINCE THE FORWARD ESTIMATES FOR 1986-87 WERE<br />
PREPARED HAVE HAD TO BE TAKEN WHICH YIELD NET SAVINGS OF $ 2<br />
BILLION. BUT JUST AS IMPORTANTLY, THESE DECISIONS WILL<br />
REDUCE OUTLAYS IN NET TERMS BY SOME $ 1.5 BILLION IN 1987-88<br />
IN OTHER WORDS WE HAVE GIVEN OURSELVES A FLYING START IN<br />
PREPARING NEXT YEAR's BUDGET. </p>
<p>IN CONJUNCTION WITH SOME MEASURES TO LIFT COMMONWEALTH<br />
RECEIPTS IN LINE WITH THE NEED TO LIFT OUR DOMESTIC SAVINGS<br />
EFFORT, THIS HAS ENABLED THE BUDGET DEFICIT TO BE CUT BY<br />
MORE THAN $ 2 BILLION TO $ 3.5 BILLION.<br />
I HAVE SOMETIMES HEARD IT SAID OVER THE PAST WEEK OR SO THAT<br />
IT WILL TAN( E MORE THAN JUST ONE GOOD BUDGET TO SOLVE<br />
AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. I HEARTILY AGREE.<br />
BUT THIS IS NO PAIJLIAN CONVERSION. THE RECOGNITION OF THE<br />
NEED CONSISTENTLY TO PURSUE FISCAL POLICY APPROPRIATE TO THE<br />
TIME HAS UNDER-PINNED THE ENTIRE 3 1/ 2 YEARS OF MY<br />
GOVERNMENT. LET ME REMIND YOU THAT WE INHERITED A PROSPECTIVE DEFICIT OF<br />
$ 9.6 BILLION FROM OUR PREDECESSORS. LET ME REMIND YOU THAT<br />
I SAID AT THE TIME THAT AUSTRALIA REQUIRED A DEGREE OF<br />
FISCAL STIMULUS TO KICK-START THE ECONOMY FROM THE RECESSION<br />
AT THAT TINE, BUT THAT IT WOULD BE OUR AIM TO PROGESSIVELY<br />
REDUCE THlE STIMULUS. AND LET ME REMIND YOU THAT IN FACT WE<br />
QUITE RESPONSIBLY TOOK THE VIEW, EVEN IN THE RECESSIONARY<br />
CONDITIONS WHICH WE INHERITED, THAT A DEFICIT SIGNIFICANTLY<br />
BELOW $ 9.6 BILLION WAS REQUIRED AND WE SET ABOUT PARING IT<br />
BACK. AS I SAY THlE REASON THAT WE BEGAN THAT PROCESS AND<br />
SUSTAINED THE EFFORT IN EACH OF OUR THREE SUCCESSIVE BUDGETS<br />
WAS OUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE FACT THAT AS PRIVATE SECTOR<br />
DEMANDS FOfl CREDIT GROW, THE PUBLIC SECTOR MUST ADJUST. IN<br />
OUR NEW ENMVIRONMENT, IN WHICH THE WORLD VALUE OF OUR<br />
NATIONAL INCOME HAS BEEN CUT, THAT FACT HAS EVEN GREATER<br />
RELEVANCE. TO IGNORE THAT REALITY WOULD SIMPLY BE A RECIPE FOR FURTHER<br />
HIKES IN INTEREST RATES, SUSTAINED CURRENCY INSTABILITY AND<br />
PROLONGED UNEMPLOYMENT. ONE OBJECTIVE OF THIS BUDGET,<br />
THEREFORE, IS TO PERMIT THE BURDEN OF POLICY TO SHIFT AWAY<br />
FROM HIGHER INTEREST RATES. THIS IS THE WAY SIMULTANEOUSLY<br />
TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR A LOWER CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT<br />
AND AN INCREASE IN GROWTH SUSTAINING INVESTMENT.<br />
BUT, JUST AS IMPORTANTLY, THE HALLMARK OF OUR APPROACH TO<br />
FISCAL POLICY HAS BEEN TO ACHIEVE THE NECESSARY " BOTTOM<br />
LINES" IN A WAY WHICH IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH OUR OVERRIDING<br />
OBJECTIVE TO PROMOTE FAIRNESS AND TO SUPPORT THE GENUINELY<br />
NEEDY. AS A GOVERNMENT, WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY SOUGHT TO RE-ORDER OUR<br />
SPENDING PRIORITIES IN FAVOUR OF THE NEEDY. THIS IS<br />
REFLECTED PARTICULARLY IN THE FACT THAT BY END 1986 THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE INCREASED THE STANDARD RATE OF PENSION<br />
BY 7.3 PER CENT IN REAL TERMS, COMPARED WITH THE MISERLY<br />
PER CENT INCREMENT DELIVERED OVER THE WHOLE PERIOD OF THE<br />
FRASER GOVERNMENT.<br />
ALTHOUGH SEVERELY CONSTRAINED BY THE TIGHT FISCAL DISCIPLINE<br />
WHICH WE HAVE HAD TO ACCEPT WE HAVE NONETHELESS BEEN ABLE TO<br />
INCREASE THE BENEFITS PAID TO THE POOREST OF OUR PENSIONER </p>
<p>FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN, TO INTRODUCE SOME NEW PROGRAMS IN<br />
RESPONSE TO THE MILLER REPORT ON ABORIGINAL TRAINING NEEDS<br />
AND TO BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES TO PROVIDE IMPROVED CARE<br />
FOR THE AGED.<br />
IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ALSO CONSISTENTLY SOUGHT TO DELIVER<br />
MORE OF THE WELFARE DOLLAR TO THE RECIPIENTS. WE HAVE DONE<br />
THIS BY MORE EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES; THE BETTER<br />
TARGETING OF PROGRAMS; AND MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT BENEFITS<br />
ARE DRAWN ONLY BY THOSE ENTITLED TO THEM.<br />
THIS BUDGE1 IS NO EXCEPTION.<br />
IN THE BUDOET WE HAVE INSTITUTED A QUITE FUNDAMENTAL REV IEW<br />
OF THE WAY IN WHICH UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND SOLE PARENTS<br />
BENEFITS ARE ADMINISTERED. IN BOTH CASES, THERE WILL BE<br />
GREATER SCRUTINY NOT ONLY IN THE INTEREST OF PROVIDING<br />
APPROPRIATE SERVICES TO THE LONG-TERM~ UNEMPLOYED AND THOSE<br />
WITH SPECIAL NEEDS, BUT ALSO TO ENSURE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE<br />
DISPENSED PROPERLY.<br />
BUT EVEN TEOSE MEASURES ON THEIR OWN WERE NOT SUFFICIENT AND<br />
ADDITIONAL SAVINGS HAVE HAD TO BE FOUND.<br />
IN ALL SOPKE $ 500 MILLION HAS BEEN CUT FROM THE EMERGING<br />
SOCIAL SECURITY BILL AND SOME $ 300 MILLION FROM THE HEALTH<br />
AREA. OP COURSE, WE WOULD HAVE MUCH PREFERRED TO AVOID<br />
MAKING TFESE SAVINGS. BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE TASK WAS SO<br />
GREAT THsT THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE; THE FIGURES JUST WOULD<br />
NOT ADD UP~ IN OUR NEW ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES IN ANY OTHER<br />
FAIR WAY.<br />
ONE PARTICULAR DECISION IN THAT AREA RELATES TO THE<br />
PHARM4ACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME.<br />
IT IS PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET THAT THE COST OF A SCRIPT<br />
SHOULD RISZ FROM ITS PRESENT $ 5 TO A MAXIMUM OF $ 10 FROM 1<br />
NOVEMBER 1986. CURRENT ESTIMATES PUT THE AVERAGE EXPECTED<br />
SCRIPT CHARGE A LITTLE OVER $ 7.<br />
HOWEVER, CONSISTENT WITH OUR WISH TO PROTECT THE NEEDY, THE<br />
RISE FOR HEALTH CARE CARD HOLDERS WILL BE LIMITED TO<br />
CENTS ( BRINGING THEIR TOTAL CHARGE TO $ 2.50) AND PENSIONERS<br />
WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE ITEMS ON THE PHARMACEUTICAL<br />
BENEFITS LIST FREE OF ANY CHARGE. MOREOVER WE HAVE TAKEN<br />
SUBSTANTIAL STEPS TO PROTECT THE CHRONICALLY ILL.<br />
NO INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR MORE<br />
THAN 25 PRESCRIPTIONS IN A YEAR. IN OTHER WORDS THE<br />
ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM A FAMILY OR INDIVIDUAL WILL PAY PER YEAR<br />
UNDER THE NEW SCHEME IS $ 250 AND FOR CONCESSIONAL USERS<br />
THE MAXIMUM COST PER ANNUM WILL BE $ 62.50.<br />
THIS MOST NECESSARY REFORM WILL CLEARLY PROTECT THOSE IN<br />
NEED. BUT IT NONETHELESS ACHIEVES SIGNIFICANT FULL YEAR<br />
SAVINGS OF $ 67 MILLION TO THE BUDGET. </p>
<p>I WOULD ADD THAT SIGNIFICANT NEW MEASURES HAVE ALSO BEEN<br />
INTRODUCED TO CONTAIN, EQUITABLY, THE GROWING COSTS OF<br />
HIGHER EDUCATION. AN ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION CHARGE OF $ 250<br />
IS TO BE XNTRODUCED IN 1987 FOR STUDENTS AT UNIVERSITIES AND<br />
COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION. POOR STUDENTS, NOTABLY<br />
THOSE IN RECEIPT. OF TERTIARY ALLOWANCES, WILL NOT BE<br />
DISADVANTAGED BY THE CHARGE.<br />
BUT IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT WE WERE FORCED TO THE VIEW<br />
THAT WE COULD NOT CONTINUE WITH THE SITUATION IN WHICH<br />
STUDENTS MADE NO CONTRIBUTION TO COVER THE COSTS OF THEIR<br />
EDUCATION THE AVERAGE COST FOR A FULL-TIME STUDENT IN<br />
TERTIARY EDUCATION IS $ 8200 PER ANNUM. THE CHARGE IS TO<br />
DEFRAY SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEADS FACED BY<br />
INSTITUTIONS. SUGGESTIONS THAT THE CHARGE EQUATES TO A<br />
TERTIARY TUITION FEE ARE CLEARLY LUDICROUS WHEN SET AGAINST<br />
THE AVERAGE COST OF PROVIDING A PLACE.<br />
PART OF THE PROCEEDS, WHICH ARE PUT AT SOME 97 MILLION IN<br />
1986-87, WILL BE RETAINED BY INSTITUTIONS FOR THEIR OWN<br />
PURPOSES. PART WILL BE DEVOTED TO PROVIDING OFFSETTING<br />
BENEFITS TO POOR STUDENTS. AND PART WILL ALSO BE USED TO<br />
PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND PLACES OVER AND ABOVE THE<br />
ADDITIONAL TWO THOUSAND WHICH IT WAS PREVIOUSLY INTENDED TO<br />
PROVIDE FROM THIS BUDGET.<br />
WHILE SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS OVERALL HAVE BEEN M4ADE IN THE<br />
AREAS OF EDUCATION, HEALTH, SOCIAL SECURITY AND HOUSING AND<br />
COMMUNITY .!-MENITTES, THE SHARE OF TOTAL OUTLAYS DEVOTED TO<br />
THESE PROGRAMS WILL RISE FROM 46.4 PER CENT To 46.7 PER CENT<br />
IN THIS BUDGET. THIS IS THE CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THIE PRIORITY<br />
WHICH WE CONTINUE TO GIVE TO THESE AREAS, EVEN WITHIN THE<br />
TIGHTEST LIMIT ON AGGREGATE SPENDING.<br />
THE BUDGET GIVES EFFECT TO THE NEXT STAGE OF TAX REFORM.<br />
THE REFRM* PACKAGE WILL DELIVER SUBSTANTIAL TAX CUTS TO<br />
PERSONAL TAX PAYERS, BEGINNING ON 1 DECEMBER WITH THE FINAL<br />
INSTALMENT ON 1 JULY 1987. THE BUSINESS SECTOR WILL ALSO<br />
RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE IMPUTATION<br />
SYSTEM TO R~ EMOVE DOUBLE TAXATION OF DIVIDENDS AND A SIMILAR<br />
MEASURE IN RESPECT OF SMALL BUSINESS, THE REMOVAL OF<br />
DIVISION 7. THERE ARE NO NEW DIRECT IMPOSTS ON BUSINESS IN<br />
THIS BUDGET.<br />
THE PACKAGE OVERALL WILL YIELD REVENUE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF<br />
BILLXON IN A FULL YEAR, BUT WILL RETURN TAX BENEFITS TO<br />
THE COMMUNITY OF $ 4.5 BILLION I. E. THREE TIMES THE YIELD<br />
FROM THE NEW MEASURES.<br />
BOTH THE TREASURER AND I HAVE MADE PLAIN ON A NUMBER OF<br />
OCCASIONS OUR WILLINGNESS TO LOOK AT LEGITIMATE COMPLAINTS<br />
ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION AND TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE FRINGE<br />
BENEFITS TAX. IN LINE WITH THAT COMMITMENT THE TREASURER<br />
YESTERDAY ANNOUNCED SOME MARGINAL CHANGES TO THE CURRENT<br />
LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO AVOID SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES<br />
OF THE TAX. </p>
<p>BUT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBTING THE ESSENTIAL VALIDITY OF THIS<br />
MEASURE. BUSINESS CANNOT ON THE ONE HAND ARGUE FOR WAGE<br />
RESTRAINT AND ON THE OTHER CONTINUE TO PAY UNTAXED BENEFITS<br />
TO A SELECT GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS. OTHER TAX PAYERS THE<br />
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF TAX PAYERS WOULD HAVE TO BEAR A<br />
HIGHER BURDEN IN ORDER TO PERMIT THAT TO CONTINUE. A<br />
GOVERNMENT COMMITTED TO FAIRNESS AND EQUITY COULD NOT<br />
ACQUIESCE IN THAT.<br />
THE BUDGET HAS ALSO OUTLINED IN UNEQUIVOCAL TERMS THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH TO WAGES POLICY.<br />
WAGES HAVE UNAMBIGUOUSLY BEEN THE SUCCESS STORY OF THE LAST<br />
THREE YEARS. FEW OTHER COUNTRIES IN THEIR HISTORY HAVE'<br />
MANAGED TO PRODUCE A DEGREE OF WAGES ADJUSTMENT TO MATCH<br />
THAT OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
REAL UNIT KABOUR COSTS HAVE DECLINED BY 7 PER CENT OVER THIS<br />
PERIOD. A MAJOR ELEMENT OF THAT HAS BEEN A FALL OF THE<br />
ORDER OF 5 PER CENT IN REAL WAGES.<br />
THAT HAS OCCURRED IN AUSTRALIA BECAUSE OF THE GOOD SENSE OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN WORKERS. THEY HAVE RECOGNISED THE NEED TO WORK<br />
WITH MANAGEMENT TO BEGIN TO UNDO THE MANIFESTLY<br />
UNCOMPETITIVE COST STRUCTURE OVER WHICH COALITION<br />
CONSERVATNVE GOVERNMENTS HAD PRESIDED FOR SO LONG NOT<br />
JUST, INDEED, PRESIDED OVER BUT WHICH THEY HAD POSITIVELY<br />
FOSTERED.<br />
THAT ACHI1% VEMENT STANDS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE UNITED<br />
KINGDOM WHERE THERE WAS A REAL RISE IN EARNINGS OF 10 PER<br />
CENT. THE BUDGET DOCUMENTS MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IT WILL BE NECESSARY<br />
TO SEEK AND OBTAIN YET FURTHER WAGE RESTRAINT IN THE PERIOD<br />
AHEAD. TO THAT END WE WILL BE SEEKING A 2 PER CENT DISCOUNT<br />
AT THE NEXT NATIONAL WAGE CASE. IF NECESSARY, A FURTHER<br />
DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT TO WAGES WILL BE SOUGHT AT THE FIRST<br />
CASE AFTER THAT IN 1987.<br />
ON THE FIGURES NOW BEFORE US THAT WILL PERMIT A FURTHER<br />
DECLINE IN REAL UNIT LABOUR COSTS IN 1986-87 OF 1 PER CENT.<br />
IT WILL HELP SUBSTANTIALLY TO PRESERVE THE MASSIVE<br />
IMPROVEMENT IN OUR INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS AN<br />
IMPROVEMENT WHICH BEGAN WITH THE WAGES OUTCOMES DELIVERED<br />
UNDER THE ACCORD AND WAS FURTHERED BY THE SUBSTANTIAL<br />
DEPRECIATION WHICH HAS OCCURRED OVER THE PAST YEAR OR SO.<br />
WE WILL BE SEEKING FURTHER WAGE RESTRAINT NOT BECAUSE WAGES<br />
HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DIFFICULTIES WE ARE NOW<br />
FACING. BUT IT IS INESCAPABLE THAT WHEN OUR NATIONAL INCOME<br />
IS UNDER ATTACK, PART OF THE BURDEN OF ADJUSTMENT MUST BE<br />
BORNE BY WAGE AND SALARY EARNERS, WHO RECEIVE OVER AROUND<br />
PER CENT 0? OUR NATIONAL INCOME.<br />
WE WILL BE SEEKING THAT RESULT ALSO BECAUSE IT IS AN<br />
INESCAPABLE FACT THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN TRADE OUT OF<br />
OUR EXTERNALLY IMPOSED DIFFICULTIES WILL BE TO PRESERVE OUR </p>
<p>IMPROVED COMPETITIVENESS. PASSING HIGHER IMPORT COSTS INTO<br />
HIGHER WAGES COSTS WORKS DIRECTLY AGAINST THAT REQUIREMENT.<br />
I SAID EARLIER THAT THIS GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THAT THE<br />
RESOLUTION OF OUR PROBLEMS DOES NOT REST WITH ONE GOOD<br />
BUDGET, NOR EVEN WITH FOUR GOOD BUDGETS IN SUCCESSION AS<br />
WE HAVE PRODUCED SINCE 1983. 1 HAVE NOTED ALSO THAT WE HAVE<br />
PURSUED A WAGES POLICY WHICH HAS DELIVERED RESPONSIBLE<br />
OUTCOMES THE OUTCOMES NEEDED TO GET AUSTRALIA BACK INTO<br />
THE INTERNATIONAL GAME.<br />
BUT THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH IS EVEN BROADER THAN THIS.,<br />
FOR THREE YEARS NOW THIS GOVERNMENT HAS PURSUED POLICIES TO<br />
REVITAL! SE AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY. WE HAVE SOUGHT TO<br />
INTERNATIONALISE AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURING AND THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
SERVICES SECTOR. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED POLICIES:<br />
TO ENCOURAGE R&amp; D;<br />
TO R2_. ORM OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM SO AS TO IMPROVE OUR<br />
SKILLS BASE;<br />
TO LIFT THE THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF TRAINING<br />
OPPORTUNITIES WHICH WE GIVE TO OUR YOUNG POST-SCHOOL<br />
WORt4' ERS; AND<br />
TO IREMOVE THE BARRIERS WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE<br />
INHI. BITED THE EXPANSION OF EFFICIENT AUSTRALIAN<br />
ENTERPRISES.<br />
THOSE POLICIES ARE OF THREE YEARS STANDING. THOSE POLICIES<br />
HAVE PREPARED AUSTRALIA TO CONFRONT THE CHALLENGE POSED BY<br />
THE FALL IN OUR TERMS OF TRADE.<br />
BUT IN SAYING THAT LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT IS NEW ABOUT<br />
THAT CHALLENGE. THE NEW ELEMENT OF THE CHALLENGE IS NOT THE<br />
FACT THA~ T WE HAVE TO RESTRUCTURE OUR INDUSTRIAL BASE. THAT<br />
HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON THIS GOVERNMENT'S AGENDA AS IT SHOULD<br />
HAVE BEEN ON ALL PREVIOUS AGENDAS, BUT FREQUENTLY WAS NOT.<br />
THE NEW ELMENT TODAY IS RATHER THAT WE FACE A MUCH SHORTER<br />
TIME-TABLE FOR RECONSTRUCTION THAN COULD HAVE BEEN ENVISAGED<br />
EVEN A YEAR AGO. IT IS THIS RECOGNITION OF URGENCY WHICH<br />
PROVIDES THE POINT OF DEPARTURE FOR THE 1986-87 BUDGET, ON<br />
THE STRONG FOUNDATIONS LAID BY ITS THREE PREDECESSORS.<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
THE BUDGET AND ITS ASSOCIATED POLICIES GIVE THE ECONOMY<br />
THE NEW DIRECTIONS IT NEEDS. THEY SET IN TRAIN THE NEW<br />
DEGREE OF ADJUSTMENT NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THE ECONOMIC<br />
NUMBERS ADD UP ESPECIALLY THE BALANCE BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND<br />
FOREIGN SOURCES OF SAVING. NOW WE NEED, AS A NATION, TO<br />
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE NEW DIRECTIONS TO ENABLE US TO GET<br />
OUR COLLECTIVE ACT TOGETHER. </p>
<p>.0<br />
DESPITE rj. E CHANGE IN THE NATURE OF OUR CURRENT PROBLEMS,<br />
THAT WAS ESSENTIALLY THE TASK AND CHALLENGE FOR US ALL IN<br />
1983. THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY AND ESPECIALLY BUSINESS<br />
AND UNIONS RESPONDED IN A REMARKABLE WAY.<br />
THE SPIRIT OF 1983 LIFTED AUSTRALIA TO THE JOBS PINNACLE OF<br />
1986. IT WAS THE SPIRIT OF CO-OPERATION AND RESTRAINT OF<br />
1983, AS IKUCH AS THE POLICIES WE ADOPTED, WHICH ACHIEVED THE<br />
RECOVERY AND GROWTH IN THE YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED.<br />
THE SPIRIT OF 1983 PRODUCED A COMMONALTY OF PURPOSE AND A<br />
WILLINGNE2SS TO ACCEPT REAL WAGE. CUTS IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE<br />
THE LIVING STANDARDS OF AUSTRALIANS TODAY AND IN THE FUTURE.<br />
THAT WAS THE SPIRIT OF~ 1983, AS IT REM4AINS THE SPZRIT OF THE<br />
ACCORD. 4' N D THE WORD " SPIRIT" IS NO MERE RHETORICAL<br />
FLOURISH, IT IS NOTHING MORE THAN A READINESS TO RECOGNISE<br />
REALITY. IT IS NOTHING LESS THAN A COMMONSENSE,<br />
DOWN-' TO-YZARTH AUSTRALIAN APPROACH.<br />
IN THE VAP. ST WEEK, I HAVE BEEN STRENGTHENED IN MY FIRM BELIEF<br />
THAT THE SPIRIT OF 1983 WILL EMERGE AS STRONGLY AS EVER, TO<br />
LIFT THE AUSTRALIA OF 1986, AND THAT ONCE AGAIN WE WILL<br />
EMERGE TRIUMPHANT. </p>
