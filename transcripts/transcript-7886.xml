TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, NEW ZEALAND HIGH<br />
COMMISSION RESIDENCE, CANBERRA 6 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: The Democrat preferences in Thomastown don't<br />
seem to be going, or aren't going your way. Does this<br />
worry you?<br />
PM: Look, if there's any worry about the votes of the<br />
Democrats in Thomastown it should be by the Liberals. To<br />
have themselves being outvoted by the Democrats is a very<br />
real concern for them. We haven't disguised the fact,<br />
before the Thomastown election, that there'd be a swing<br />
and that there would be dissatisfaction down there<br />
amongst the voters in that electorate. I said that would<br />
be so before the election and I've said it since.<br />
Predominantly, not exclusivesly, but predominantly they<br />
have been state issues. The Liberals are the ones who<br />
need to worry about what's happened to the vote in<br />
Thomastown. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, when will the Government<br />
work out its position on foreign ownership of television<br />
networks? PM: Well the Minister has had some discussions about it<br />
and he will be considering this again in the next week or<br />
so. The Government will make its position clear when<br />
he's concluded his considerations and recommendations to<br />
US. JOURNALIST: Does it concern you that the delay favours<br />
Kerry Packer rather than Alan Bond?<br />
PM: Well what would concern me if we were to take any'<br />
particular decision which manifestly was seen to or would<br />
in fact favour one player rather than the other. It's in<br />
that sense almost a no-win situation. But we don't<br />
intend to make our decisions in terms of favouring one<br />
player or the other either in regard to that network or<br />
anyone else.<br />
JOURNALIST: trip to Western Australia, will you be<br />
attempting to diffuse the issue of WA Inc in regard to a<br />
federal election. </p>
<p>PM: WA Inc is a state issue there. I'll be going over<br />
there to talk about those issues which will determine the<br />
welfare of West Australians in the period ahead as far as<br />
federal government is concerned. It's who's in<br />
government in Canberra which will determine whether the<br />
people of Western Australia will be devastated by changes<br />
to Medicare and the abolition of Medicare which the<br />
coalition parties propose at the federal level. These<br />
are the sorts of issues that I'll be talking about. The<br />
question of WA Inc as you say is a matter of state<br />
politics and to be worked out over there. There is<br />
nothing that we've done to create WA Inc. That is<br />
entirely a West Australian matter and will be seen by the<br />
electorate as such.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does Mr Dowding enjoy your unqualified<br />
support as leader in the West?<br />
PM: All the leaders of my Party wherever they are enjoy<br />
my unqualified confidence.<br />
JOURNALIST: Senator Button is suggesting that a deal has<br />
been done between yourself and Mr Keating for the<br />
leadership after the next election.<br />
PM: Not so.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Peacock said this morning that your<br />
Government Prime Minister is practising the politics of<br />
the big lie, that key groups are not supporting the ACTU<br />
wage struture. The National Farmers Federation<br />
dissociated themselves and small business is not happy<br />
with it.<br />
PM: Yes but he really couldn't do much better than the<br />
National Farmers Federation. did it with a bit of a<br />
flip Earlier in the day they were part The<br />
simple indisputable fact is that the major employer<br />
organisations in Australia have said to the Opposition's<br />
wages policy what any intelligent person would've<br />
expected them to say. And that is you can stick your<br />
wages policy because it is a recipe for industrial<br />
disaster. That is the judgement of everyone in Australia<br />
that has any significance, including the major employer<br />
organisations. They have no support from any section of<br />
the trade union movement. They have no support now from<br />
the major employer organisations. And this is not<br />
surprising because no intelligent person concerned in the<br />
Australian industrial and economic scene wants to see a<br />
return to the disaster of ' 81-' 82 when you had your wages<br />
explosion. And the employers and the trade unions<br />
understand that what Mr Peacock is proposing is precisely<br />
such a recipe. So it's not surprising that as in most<br />
other areas of policy intelligent people and relevant<br />
organisations are saying to the Opposition you are<br />
pathetic, you are irrelevant.<br />
