EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
S -SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF THE MURDOCH INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH INTO BIRTH<br />
DEFECTS MELBOURNE 17 FEBRUARY 1987<br />
Mr Neil Walford<br />
Professor David Danks<br />
Mr Rupert Murdoch<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
About 15 months ago, I had the honour, with the Premier,<br />
John Cain, of opening-the-new-bui-lding-for-the-Walter--and--...<br />
Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. In its 72 years,<br />
that Institute has proven itself a world class medical<br />
research institute.<br />
Alongside the growth of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute,<br />
Melbourne residents have witnessed the growth of two other<br />
major institutes of medical research, the Howard Florey<br />
Institute of Experimental Physiology and Medicine and the<br />
Baker Medical Research Institute.<br />
Tonight we are celebrating the rise of Victoria's fourth<br />
medical research institute of national and international<br />
significance: the Murdoch Institute for Research into Birth<br />
Defects. The creation of the Murdoch Institute indeed the<br />
flourishing of medical research in-Melbourne-in-general is<br />
the result of the vision, generosity and skills of'many<br />
people: donors, administrators, and scientists alike.<br />
The goal of the Murdoch Institute is described in the words:<br />
" to work towards the day when every child is born healthy<br />
with normal abilities". There could hardly be a higher or<br />
more worthy ambition.-<br />
At this gathering tonight we see some of the people whose<br />
generosity has given the Institute the resources to strive<br />
towards that goal, and some of the people whose research<br />
skills will contribute towards-achieving it. </p>
<p>Tonight we formally launch an Institute which in fact has a<br />
history of high quality research stretching back over<br />
years. Its genesis and growth within the Research Foundation<br />
of the Royal Children's Hospital was made possible through<br />
the generosity of the Victorian public through the Good<br />
Friday appeal, which raised millions of dollars for the<br />
research work.<br />
The achievements of that research group are known<br />
internationally, especially for discoveries about<br />
__ phenylketonuria; about genetic defects in the utilisation of<br />
copper in the body; for the discovery_ of a number of<br />
metabolic diseases; and for the development of methods of<br />
di-agnos-ing-and-t-rea-tf-mnetabo-l-i-e-d-i-sease-s.-ts<br />
__. computerised syndrome diagnostic sys_ temis highly regarded<br />
-and will-. shortly be released internationally, possibly-to<br />
become the world's standard system.<br />
But the transformation of this research group into the<br />
Murdoch Institute opens a vital new chapter in its growth.<br />
The Murdoch family's place is already firmly fixed in<br />
Australian history thanks to the outstanding contributions<br />
made to the Australian community over the decades by<br />
Murdochs including Sir__ KeithMurdoch,. Sir-Walter-Murdoch and-<br />
Rupert Murdoch.<br />
Western Australia's second Uni. ve. rsity bears . the Murdochname.<br />
And now this Institute bears witness to the Murdoch<br />
family's generous contribution to the community. It must be<br />
unique in Australia for the one family to have given its<br />
name to two major institutions a record of which the<br />
family can be proud.<br />
I noticed that some questions have been raised, usually by<br />
those not entirely disinterested, about Rupert's<br />
" Australianness". I had cause to say at a private function<br />
recently, in the presence of many Americans, that the<br />
crucial test of his loyalties was provided by the America's<br />
Cup challenge off Fremantle Rupert barracked for an<br />
Australian victory! I observed parenthetically that this<br />
was one of the very few occasions when Rupert was on the<br />
-losing end of any contest.<br />
Nothing could better demonstrate his commitment to this<br />
country than this extraordinarily generous $ 5 million<br />
contribution by Rupert Murdoch and his family.<br />
By their encouragement and generosity, the Murdoch family,<br />
along with a number of other donors, are targetting a very<br />
complex medical problem which has serious--implications formany<br />
Australian families. </p>
<p>In today's Australia, birth defects are the most important<br />
paediatric health problem. Each year 5,000 Australian<br />
babies are born with birth defects which will kill or cause<br />
long-term disability. Each of these births brings anguish<br />
to the family concerned anger, self-accusation, sadness<br />
and the long-term burden of coping with a child with an<br />
intellectual or physical disability.<br />
The total cost of birth defects to the Australian community<br />
cannot be calculated, because one-cannot put a price on-the<br />
heartache-and-m-oQioal c-_ sat suffered by disabled children<br />
and their families. However, spending by Federal and State<br />
Governments on special services to Australian children<br />
siu f f e-ri ng-i nte-ll-ec-tu-arl--o-r--phy--isa -da-b--l-i-, t-ies-i i--he<br />
_ roder f hundreds-o. f . milii QnS o. f ollars--a--y-e-ar.<br />
For it is to government that families look for help in<br />
coping with problems of this type. Families look to the<br />
health services to tell them what is wrong and why it went<br />
wrong. Families need help in assisting the child to live<br />
with the disability and to maximise its abilities.<br />
Government services provide hospitals and special education<br />
centres and the transport to travel to and from them. They<br />
provide direct financial aid when additional costs are<br />
involved. In extreme-situations,. government agencies are<br />
called upon to provide total care and support. Governments<br />
are also involved in rehabilitating those many people with<br />
disabilities who can learn to take their places in-soc. iety.<br />
But our responsibilities as a community do not end there.<br />
For we must also take the responsibility of endeavouring to<br />
protect future generations of Australian children from<br />
suffering debilitating birth defects.<br />
This is where Murdoch Institute will make its mark, for<br />
research into the causes of birth defects offers the best<br />
hope of early detection and prevention of birth defects.<br />
The truism that today's research becomes tomorrow's medical<br />
practice has already been borne out in numerous examples<br />
such as immunisation against rubella.<br />
Now even genetic diseases are becoming preventable. Early<br />
prenatal tests are now available for over a hundred<br />
different genetic diseases.<br />
New discoveries of molecular genetics are making prenatal<br />
diagnosis available for more and more genetic diseases,<br />
including, in very recent years, thalassaemia, haemophilia,<br />
muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis.<br />
The skills and facilities needed for these diagnoses are<br />
specialised, and the tests are not cheap. However, in every<br />
one of these diseases the cost of preventing a single case<br />
is less than one tenth the cost of caring-for a single<br />
patient. </p>
<p>Twenty years ago it would have seemed unbelievable that by<br />
1987 scientists would have isolated the defective genes<br />
responsible for dozens of genetic diseases and would be<br />
using this knowledge for prenatal diagnosis.<br />
Today, the correction of defective genes in the cells of a<br />
patient seems hard to believe, yet some scientists<br />
anticipate such progress_ in the _ next 20. years. __ The . Mu. rdoch<br />
Institute may well play an important role in the advancement<br />
of science towards the goals of.-prevention and. curati-ve<br />
treatment of birth<br />
Located in Australia's largest paediatric hospital, some of<br />
he-4Mu -rdoch -I-n t-te-s--t-a-f-f---ae--i-nvo-l-ved.-in--d-iagaosi-ngenetic<br />
diseases_ andcounsellingfamilies, and in planning<br />
the rationaLdevelopment of services. Others-are--studying<br />
nfundamental aspects 6f biology like the -control 6f-gene<br />
action, the biochemical processes involved in embryonic<br />
development and the role of an essential element like copper<br />
in maintaining normal health.<br />
So, in short, to have the Murdoch Institute working in this<br />
field can only foster further advances, better techniques,<br />
improved health care, and new hope for many families.<br />
It is always remarkable to observe the quality of<br />
Australia's research base, which has produced and is<br />
producing so many figures of world-renown<br />
These research skills cannot however be acquired or applied<br />
by a community without support, including financial support,<br />
from many sources.<br />
It is clear Australia has lagged behind Britain, Canada and<br />
the USA in private sector support of medical research. But<br />
if sport and the arts can become the object of corporate<br />
promotion, so surely should medical research.<br />
The private sector donors to the Murdoch Institute are<br />
leading the way, I hope, towards significant improvements in<br />
level of private support for medical research.<br />
Their support will amount to $ 9.5 million, which is a very<br />
firm foundation indeed for an Australian research institute.<br />
It represents great faith in-the ability of Australian<br />
researchers to compete successfully in the difficult but<br />
fundamentally important task the Institute has set itself.<br />
For its part, the Government is pleased to have played a<br />
role in backing the venture. It was once popular to<br />
criticise low Government allocation of money to medicalresearch<br />
in Australia relative to other Western nations. My<br />
Government has increased this allocation in real terms each<br />
year since it was elected, during difficult years ' which have<br />
seen reductions in research expenditure in many other<br />
countries. </p>
<p>C. Over the years, Government funds have been made available to<br />
medical research through the National Health and Medical<br />
Research Council. Block grants of large sums for repeated<br />
year periods have been awarded by the NH&amp; MRC to the Walter<br />
Eliza Hall Institute, to the Howard Florey Institute and<br />
more recently to the Baker Institute. Now the NH&amp; MRC has<br />
decided to award Block Grants to the Murdoch Institute as<br />
well as to the Garvan Institute in Sydney. -The Government's<br />
support for the Murdoch Institute amounts to $ 3.7 million in<br />
real terms over five years.<br />
So the Institute we launch tonight is a product of a true<br />
spirit of co-operation and collaboration between the private<br />
-and--public -sectors.--I-n-formally launching the -Murdoch----<br />
In. stitute forResearch into Birth Defects, I convey the<br />
Government's -best wishes to the Institute and its future; I<br />
again express my thanks to the Murdoch family and the other<br />
private sector donors for their magnificent gesture; and,<br />
beyond the Institute itself, I commend to other research<br />
areas in Australia this fine and fruitful example of<br />
collaborative effort between the public and private sectors.<br />
