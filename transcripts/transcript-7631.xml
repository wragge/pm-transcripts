TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH GARRY WEST AND CRAIG MOORE,<br />
RADIO 3BA, BALLARAT 8 JUNIE 1909<br />
9 0 1 PROOF ONLY<br />
INTIRVIIWZR: We have the Prime Minister of Australia, Bob<br />
Hawke, in the studio. Good morning, Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: Good morning, Gary, nice to be with you.<br />
INTERVIE MR: Nice to have you in Ballarat I might add too.<br />
PN: Thank you.<br />
INTERVIEWER: It's a day visit today, you're doing a lot of<br />
running around. you've got a lot of people to meet I know<br />
it's a meet the people sort of a tour, Craig, which is good.<br />
CRAIG MOORE: it is good. At one o'clock this afternoon at<br />
the Central Square Shopping Centre is where you'll be.<br />
INTERVIEWER: That's one of the areas where a lot of Ballarat<br />
and District people can meet the Prime Minister if they'd<br />
like to. We're running short of time this morning. There's<br />
a nuber of questions we wanted to put to you and we've had a<br />
lot of listeners ask us to ask you certain questions<br />
PH: Sure.<br />
INTERVIEWER: over the past few weeks, but China has to come<br />
up first. The situation Is worsening over there, we're aware<br />
of that. Can you see it going any further though at this<br />
stage. PN: No-one can say with accuracy, Gary,, what's going to<br />
happen. The reporting out of there is all qualified and<br />
saying well this is what we think may be happening. First<br />
thing to say, however, is that our Embassy is still saying<br />
that there is no firm evidence at this point to substantiate<br />
the stoies of massive and serious fighting between different<br />
army units of the People's Liberation Army. That's not to<br />
PRIME MINISTER </p>
<p>say It won't happen but I'm merely sounding a caution,<br />
there'Is no hard evidence yet. The most tragic thing I think.<br />
apart from the obvious tragedy of the deaths of thousands of<br />
people which stands out as the worst element of what's<br />
happened, but for the future the most disturbing element Is<br />
then question of the Secretary-General of the Party there,<br />
Zhao Ziyang. He's a leader that I've spent a great deal of<br />
time with, he's a force for moderation, a magnificent man, I<br />
believe, who I think is simply central to the future of<br />
China. But they seem to have pushed him amid., there have<br />
been some stories that fates worse than that were possibly In<br />
store and I really think the critical thing is whether he's<br />
going to survive and be able to come back because I can't see<br />
anyone else there that's got the capacity to revive China.<br />
INTERVIEWSR: Your Department hasn't been able to find out If<br />
he is OX or not?<br />
PM: No, it's not only our resources, but no-one is able to<br />
say, none of the other countries with whom we share<br />
Information on theme matters, no-one is able to say with<br />
certainty what his physical condition is. It's quite clear<br />
that he's been shunted aside from his official position but<br />
as to what his actual condition is we're not sure.<br />
INTERVIEWER: But Mr Hawke this tragedy seem to have happened<br />
so quickly it just hit the world overnight really, didn't<br />
it? I mean, we woke up, read it in the press,. saw pictures<br />
coming in via satellite and it doesn't look like its going to<br />
be over very quickly. As far an Australia is concerned what<br />
else can we do at this stage?<br />
PM: There is nothing that Australia can do to alter the<br />
course of events. I think the sensible thing to do is<br />
precisely what we are doing, and that is that we have taken<br />
immediate steps to evacuate Australian citizens there whose<br />
interests were at risk, we're keeping, however, a skeleton<br />
staff of the Ambassador and about a dozen other people<br />
because that's important for two reasons. One, to try and<br />
keep a handle on what's happening so we can be properly<br />
informed and secondly, to watch our interests there and to<br />
continue to say in the strongest possible term that we<br />
deplore what's happened and that the interests of China, the<br />
region and the world are going to be best served by an<br />
abandonment of forces. Because force, killings, the<br />
restriction of human rights may provide some perceived<br />
temporary solution to the authorities there it will never<br />
provide any final answer. So we've got to keep getting the<br />
message through as far as we can with others around the world<br />
that their own Interests are best served by abandoning this<br />
course of action. </p>
<p>INTEKVIZWfl: Mr Hawks. apart from China being in the<br />
headlines. Interest rates too, they've been mentioned quite<br />
frequently too. They're at record levels, Its been<br />
disastrous for many Australian homebuyers. I guess people in<br />
Ballarat are no exception. Now I know you are aware of theme<br />
hardships that people are facing, but can you give us any<br />
indication today as to how long these high interest rates<br />
will last?<br />
PM: Well, they will last not a day longer than is necessary.<br />
I mean, I'm sure Craig and Gary that you understand that<br />
there is no way I would have interest rates higher for a day<br />
longer than Is necessary. We haven't got them there for fun,<br />
we haven't got them there because we want to hurt people. I<br />
mean, I've been In office for six years now trying to Improve<br />
the lot of the Australian people, to create more jobs, which<br />
we have, and to bring the inflation rate down and to look<br />
after people who are in hardship. That's what we've been<br />
doing for six years and we're not doing this now, as I may,<br />
for the fun of it because we want to hurt people. We're<br />
doing itbe caue9 It Is what must be done I don't want to<br />
put this in economic jargon terms because I know your<br />
listeners won't want that but the simple fact is that the<br />
level of activity In Australia Is that high at the moment, it<br />
has been f or some time, which has had good features<br />
associated with It, more jobs and more investment. We need<br />
that. but we are now with that level of activity bringing in<br />
so many imports that we can't afford to pay for them by our<br />
exports, so we've got to lower activity. That's why interest<br />
rates are high. As the level of activity comes down, as I<br />
believe it will In the month. ahead of us, then of course In<br />
that condition Interest rates will be able to come back. But<br />
then worst thing we could do for Australians now would be to<br />
may oh it doesn't matter, we'll pull interest rates down,<br />
aotivity go upt more Imports and in that situation we'd loss<br />
the dollar, the dollar would just go through the floor and<br />
interest rates through the roof. so we've got to keep it<br />
tight for a while.<br />
O INTZRVIRWER: Otherwise the situation would get worse?<br />
PM: It would got worse and I know that In a sense it's<br />
politically unpopular to have interest rates now, but I'm not<br />
going to dodge the hard but riaht decisions f or some<br />
perceived temporary political popularity. I mean, we must do<br />
the tough things and, look, I want to say to your listeners<br />
there's not a day passes in which I don't think about this#<br />
try and work out whether there are some sort of things that<br />
can be done differently which would make it better for<br />
people. Because I can remember when I was a young bloke who<br />
went first to the ACTU back In the fifties, I can remember<br />
the struggle about meeting repayments on a mortgage. I know<br />
the pressures that It creates. So I just say to your<br />
listeners, as soon as its humanly possible those rates will<br />
be coming down. But in the meantime, as I say, I remind them<br />
that within a matter of just a few weeks now from the first<br />
of July thoue very substantial tax cuts will be coming<br />
through and they will be substantial and it will be a real<br />
help. I hope that those tax cuts will help your listeners<br />
who are particularly suffering from higher mortgage<br />
repayments that those tax cuts will help them through the<br />
toughest period in the period ahead and before the rates come<br />
down again. </p>
<p>fITfVThWIR: Well, Mr Hawke. as far as the unions go and the<br />
wage-tax deal. you're not tempted to back off there at all?<br />
PM; No, on the contrary, if we were to back off there, if we<br />
were to say the tax cuts are not on, then the uanions in this<br />
situation of high economic activity have the capacity to just<br />
take wages through the roof. I mean, in fact, what the trade<br />
unions have been doing, to their great credits Is resisting<br />
offers that are being made about massive wage increases.<br />
They've been taking the responsible course and said alright<br />
we'll accept relatively lower wage increases as part of the<br />
wage restructuring deal on the basis that we know that we're<br />
going to get tax cuts which is a cheaper way for the<br />
community, a lees Inflationary way for the community of<br />
maintaining their real Income.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Mr Hawke, with an election coming up and<br />
possible in the next twelve months or so, do you thinkc the<br />
changes taking place as far as the Opposition is concerned<br />
with the parties, will that mean that you'll have a real<br />
fight an your hands when you go to polls?<br />
PM4: Well, I'm not coming up here In Ballarat just to pour a<br />
bucket on my opponents. I just make the obvious point that<br />
Mr Peacock was Leader before and hi. own Party regarded him<br />
as inadequate, they threw him out. Then they had Mr Howard,<br />
they regarded him as inadequate. But then the important<br />
point Is there was no-one else around, their resources are so<br />
poor that they've had to go back to a man about whom they<br />
had made their own judgement, about whom the President of<br />
the Party, Mr Elliott, has expressed In the past<br />
extraordinary observations about his inadequacy. So you have<br />
the Liberal Party having no-one else to go back to, putting<br />
in a fellow that the Federal President of the Party has<br />
spoken most disparagingly about in the past, so is a man who<br />
wasn't before able to got their policies together, they still<br />
haven't got their policies together, all they're living on at<br />
the moment is the understandable concern in the community<br />
about high interest rates. Apart from that they've got<br />
nothing going for them and we're a Government which has<br />
0 created record employment increases, bringing inflation down,<br />
putting more kids into a better education system these are<br />
the fundamentals that will endure in the judgement of the<br />
electorate I think.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Well there wasn a friendship for a time, Mr<br />
Hawks, between yourself and Andrew Peacock is it still<br />
there now that he's the opposition Leader?<br />
PM: Oh, look. I'm not going to create a situation in which<br />
jim in a state of personal enmity with Andrew Peacock. I<br />
don't like operating that way. I like, in the whole of my<br />
life, including the political aspects of my life, I like to<br />
have a decent friendly workable relationship with those on<br />
the opposite side of the fence. I think that's the way it<br />
ought to be as far as you can. I think the differences ought<br />
to be on the basis of policy and perceived positions about<br />
the best way you govern the country# and as far as I'm<br />
concerned that's the way I try and make it. </p>
<p>INTEIRVI3WER: Well who would you prefer to n* an the<br />
Opposition Leader, John Howard or Andrew Peacock?<br />
PM: I really don't think It makes very much difference<br />
because you've got to remember that when Andrew was there and<br />
had been Leader of the Opposition for some months, his<br />
standing with the electorate went down to the sort of level<br />
that Mr Howard's has been at. So I think he'll have<br />
something of a honeymoon, I think that's always the case, I<br />
think he'll have something for a period, but it won't last<br />
terribly long. In the end I think people are going to make<br />
Judgements about records and policies, I don't deny that<br />
leaderships have got something to do with It, of course it<br />
has, but if we've got a story of good government to tell, as<br />
we have, and they've got a story of a bad record and not very<br />
relevant policies, I think that's what will determine the<br />
election.<br />
INTERVIEWER: Well, it it wasn't Mr Peacock or Mr Howard, is<br />
there somebody else you'd like to have a challenge from from<br />
the Liberal Party?<br />
PM: Well, Its interesting you know Craig, if you look at the<br />
way the cycle's gone, who did I come up against first, it wasn<br />
Mr Framer<br />
INTERVIEWER Who may well be listening this morning, of<br />
course PM: G'day Malcolm. And this Is not a plug for you mate.<br />
There was Fraser, then Peacock. then Howard, now It's back to<br />
Peacock. There's a certain logic about this. The next one<br />
ought to be Framer. Perhaps we'll have Malcolm back.<br />
INTERVZWM Or will It be John Elliott?<br />
PMt I know there is a God there and he couldn't be that kind<br />
could he?<br />
INTERVIEWER: Mr Hawke, if you are returned to government<br />
what do see as honestly the biggest foreseeable challenge in<br />
the years ahead?<br />
PM: I think the continuing challenge that we an Australians<br />
have got is to be tough enough and Intelligent enough to<br />
realise that we live in a world of enormous change, that<br />
we're a very small nation in numbers of people we're loan<br />
than 17 million people in a world of five and a half<br />
billion that we can't live as an island uÃ± nto ourselves,<br />
that we've got to restructure the way we do things so that we<br />
can become competitive. The world doesn't owe us a living,<br />
we've got to be able to go out there not just as we'll<br />
continue to have to do to be the beet sellers of wool and<br />
wheat and meat, we're going to have to continue to do those<br />
things, but we've got to be able to manufacture good. that<br />
the world will want at competitive prices, provide services<br />
that the world wants at competitive prices. That's going to<br />
require toughness on the part of the Government, the trade<br />
unions, employers and the community generally. Provided<br />
we've got-the intelligence and the toughness to do those<br />
things, there's nothing that's beyond Australia. 2--</p>
<p>INTERVIEWZ: We'd better leave it taere . L % nanK. " w<br />
apologies everybody for the news this morning but it's not<br />
every day we have the Prime Minister of the country In the<br />
studio and it's about the only time that we'd drop the<br />
national news. You have a busy schedule today. We would<br />
like to mention some of the areas you're going to because I<br />
know a lot of people would like either to say hello to you or<br />
tell you what they think of you and I really think they<br />
should have the opportunity seeing that Bob Hawks is in town.<br />
The Prime minister will be at Grevillea Primary School for a<br />
tree planting ceremony.<br />
PM: I'll be at all these places with John Mildren, my friend<br />
and colleague, the local Member.<br />
INTERVIEWIR; And also at Central Square which I think is a<br />
good one at one o'clock today because it's a brand new<br />
complex we have in our city and it's proving extremely<br />
popular, particularly in our climate because it's all well<br />
under cover as you'll no doubt see today and It's also<br />
heated. I guess you're probably used to a few cool mornings<br />
in Canberra.<br />
PM: Yen, yes but you've got your own particular brand of<br />
cool down here if I may so.<br />
INTERVZWZ: It grows on you, it you come back and spend<br />
some more time with us I'm sure you'll get to like it. We<br />
hope you can do that and we do appreciate your time this<br />
morning. PM: It's a pleasure being with you Gary and Craig, thank you<br />
very muchi indeed, and to your listeners.<br />
