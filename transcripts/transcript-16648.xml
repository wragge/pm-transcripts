    <content><![CDATA[<p>Amber Callaghan: I read in the local paper that he was going to be in Logan and I said to my husband âwe should see if he wants to come to the bakery' and the only way that I thought I could directly message him was on Twitter, which I just joined.</p>
<p>So I messaged him and it's hard to ask someone, especially the Prime Minister, to come to your bakery with 160 characters [Laughter].</p>
<p>So I had to send two and it all, all eventuated so, yeah, so it was quite surprising that I could do that... he reads it too, I think that's a nice thing to that he actually is in touch with like, you know, the normal people not just have to go through different avenues to get to him so yeah, it's good.</p>
