AUSTRALIA DAY MESSAGE<br />
By the PRime MinLster_ Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
We celebrate today the foundation of our country.<br />
It is a time to remember the courage of those first settlers,<br />
to take a just pride in their hard-won achievements and the<br />
achievements of those who came after them, But it is also a<br />
time to think about our nationhood and of the contribution<br />
which we, who are the inheritors, can add to what has been<br />
done. We are growing in numbers and we are growing in<br />
wealth of production. Our progress has been great and there<br />
is no limit to our horizons.<br />
Whether we are of the farm or of the city, employed<br />
or employing, newcomer or born here, we can, in a spirit of<br />
national co-operation, help to build a still greater nation<br />
where, under the rule of law, equal opportunity will continue<br />
to exist for everyone. R. G. MENZIE3<br />
CANBERRA1 January, 1962. </p>
