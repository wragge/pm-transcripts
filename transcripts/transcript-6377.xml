PRIME MINISTER<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JEREMY CORDEAUX, MACQUARIE RADIO 5DN, ADELAIDE<br />
18 APRIL 1984<br />
E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
Cordeaux: You must be happy with the Bulletin popularity polls<br />
PM: Obviously you would be quite dishones8t if you<br />
didn't say that you were happy every politician wants to tie liked,<br />
and not only politicians, we all like to be liked. It is satisfying,<br />
it does seem to indicate that people like your style of government,<br />
your approach to government.<br />
Cordeaux: I have read that it is particularly important to<br />
you, to be liked. Would you say that is true?<br />
PM: I don't think it is any more important to me than<br />
it is to anyone else. Of course I like to be liked, I haven't met<br />
anyone who doesn't. There might be the odd masochist in the world<br />
who gets some perverse pleasure out of' being disliked. But I: think<br />
it's notan unusual characteristic for me to be liked.<br />
Cordeaux: Does it make making the hard decisions more<br />
difficult. Because you can't be popular all the time.<br />
PM: I dislike that insinuation. I've always in my life,<br />
been prepared to take the tough decisions, if' I believe they've been<br />
right. In politics if you're going to be effective, in leadi~ ng a<br />
government, in leading a country like this, it's obviously sensible<br />
to try and get the greatest degree of acceptance and understanding<br />
because it's not just the making of the decisions that is important,<br />
it's the carrying through of the decision, end the decision is going<br />
to be carried through more effectively if you've got a greater degree<br />
of understanding as you possibly can, arid that for example, was my<br />
reasoning in regard to the Assets Test, I decided there that we werer'<br />
going to walk away from the principle but it was quite clear that ther<br />
was a degree of misunderstanding about what-we were seeking t: o do,<br />
and there was also within the proposals that we had the possiLbility<br />
for some confusion and inequity. So 1 decided we would refer that<br />
to a committee of people in good standing and experience in the<br />
community so that we would be able in giving effect to that decision<br />
later on, to have a greater degree of understanding. Now that's not<br />
to me a sign of weakness, it's a sign of, if I may say so, good sense,<br />
because in the end it will mean that a genuinely necessary decision,<br />
which incidentally I noticed in this morning's paper was endorsed by<br />
major employer organisation, will. operate more effectively.<br />
Cordeaux; Has that been the toughest decision? What has been<br />
the toughest?<br />
PM: No. Well, my mate Mick Young, last year, having<br />
to accept his resignation at that. time'. Nov that was very tough at<br />
the time, but Mick has come back magnificantly, he's strong In the<br />
House, he's strong in the Cabinet, he's doing a tremendous job, but<br />
at the time because of the closepness of our association, it was<br />
very hard. </p>
<p>2. Cordeaux: If there is one thing that marks your Prime<br />
Ministership, I think is style. It pleases me, but I think there<br />
are probably people in the community, in your party, who don't li. ke<br />
you style, your presidential style of leadership, what would you say<br />
of that. You've got the figures, the 75% popularity to prove..<br />
PM:. Let me say about there maybe some who s8ay<br />
they don't like the style but if they are members of parliament,<br />
they'll be very, very happy to get the residual benefit at any time<br />
of an election. They won't be asking me not to come to theireiectorate.<br />
CordeauxY What about the people who do resent your style,<br />
and maybe even resent your success, within your own party I mean.<br />
PM: We're becoming a much more united and cohesive<br />
party, it may have something to do with perceptions about approaiching<br />
election times in some people's minda, but, no sepiously, in a SOCial<br />
democratic party like ours is, all aver the world', you have p( 4ople,<br />
it's an umbrella type organisation, conservative party's are too<br />
to some extent, or marked perhaps in social democratic party, people<br />
who want to do things perhaps a bit more quickly than others, or<br />
who have particular issue which obsesses them almost, and if you're<br />
not doing exactly what they want on a particular issue, they get a<br />
bit annoyed. But it's quite clear, you've referred to the poll this<br />
morning, I guess, in one sense that the very satisfying part of that<br />
is that it shows 94% of Labor voters, support the way I am going<br />
about things, so I guess you've got to put these things in perspective,<br />
and if there's a few who don't there is a hell of a lot more who do.<br />
Cordeaux: About security problems, that obviously existed<br />
yesterday, I saw you arrive by car at the side entrance and being<br />
whisked away with great drama it must cause concern to everybody<br />
in Canberra that that parcel with the potential to be real,<br />
managed to get inside Parliament House. There's great security<br />
around you today, can you still function happily with people..<br />
PM: Let's get this into perspective. One of the great<br />
features about Australia is that I as Prime Minister, can move around<br />
amongst lO0s, l000s of people. The other day in Newcastle where<br />
the estimate was 5,000 people in the mall, I moved around amongst<br />
them. Hardly anyother democracy in the world where that happens with<br />
a minimum people around me and protection. One of the great<br />
strengths of Australia that we have the capacity for real freedom<br />
like that, and I don't have any sense of inhibition by security.<br />
We have a small group of dedicated and very efficient people attached<br />
to me, who are unobstrusive. But going to the point of Parliament<br />
House, I have to confess there is some concern, for instance, iveLve<br />
had the occasion earlier last year where people in the gallery were<br />
able to throw stuff down, harmless what they throw down<br />
Cordeaux: You were assulted here in Adelaide, somebody<br />
managed to get close enough to throw a projectile at you.<br />
PM: And hit me with it, yeah sure. Well frankly in<br />
that respect I think there was a little inefficiency was involved<br />
here, that there had been some warning that there were going to be<br />
some people there, it was either inefficiency or it was the normal<br />
quote of police, watching against what they had warning of.<br />
.3/ </p>
<p>Cordeaux: At night, do you think about your own safety.<br />
PM: No, I can honestly say it, is not a matter that:<br />
occupies my mind.<br />
Cordeaux: Let me ask you about anti-uranium march, the o3LZ'd,<br />
of that demonstration throughout Australia, did it surprise you'?<br />
PM: No not really. When you describe it as an ant~ i<br />
uranium march, the emphasis was much more on disarmament and the<br />
threat and the problems of nuclear war. And I understand those<br />
concerns, I share them. It doesn't surprise me those sorts of<br />
numbers. There was certainly an element of anti-uranium but of<br />
course a lack of logic in identifying the question of mining or<br />
not mining uranium with the question of disarmament. Not only a<br />
lack of logic but there is an internal contradiction. The only<br />
relevant instrument in the international relations between countries<br />
which is effectively directed towards preventing the spread of<br />
nuclear weapons and providing more safeguards in the use of..<br />
the non proliferation treaty, and that is central to the policy the<br />
Labor Party adherence to the non proliferation treaty. Now Article 4<br />
of that treaty, which the supporters of disarmament embrace, article 4<br />
of that treaty imposes an obligation to make available to all<br />
developing countries the capacity For the peaceful use of nuclear power.<br />
Cordeaux: Dr Helen Caldicote says it doesn't workl it will<br />
find its way into bombs<br />
PM: With respect to Dr Caldicote she has not assisted<br />
rational debate in this country. Anyone who watched her, and I am<br />
not attacking her personally, she has a an emotional feeling about<br />
this, I respect that, it is simply irrational to equate the mining<br />
of uranium, I simply repeat my point. If you had the non-proliferation<br />
treaty as a central instrument in preventing this threat of nuclear<br />
weapons and under that treaty, article 4 there is an obligation<br />
imposed upon countries to supply the capacity for peaceful use of<br />
nuclear power. Then you see logical contradiction of identifying<br />
the mining of uranium with the question of weaponary, and of course<br />
there is other misinformation, saying we supply uranium to<br />
the Phillipines, we don't.<br />
Cordeaux: She has also said you are a dangerous man.<br />
PM: Yea, she got here and said that, and seemed to<br />
get some advice that that wasn't very sensible thing to say, and<br />
at the rally she had me as a possible saviour of the world. Now,<br />
she was a bit exaggerated on both accounts.<br />
Cordeaux: In tandem with that uranium debate, the sons! ' tive<br />
issue of American bases on Australian soil. It has been said that<br />
Pine Gap could be a nuclear target, you're Foreign Affairs Minister<br />
Bill Hayden seems to have broken some new ground this morning, by<br />
admitting that one of the three key US installations is a high priority<br />
9.4/ </p>
<p>PM: Bill hasn't broken any new ground there. This<br />
sort of thing has been conceded before. But let's be quite clear<br />
about it. We are an aligned nation, and have been since the last<br />
war. It was a Labor Government that forged the alliance with the<br />
United States, and Labor and non-Labor Governments without<br />
interruption since the Second World War have maintained that alliqp ce<br />
relationship. Now obviously it is true that if you're in an a1: 1iace<br />
relationship and provide facilities to the major partner in that:<br />
alliance, United States, then that carries risks$ of course it: does,<br />
and it would be dishonest to say otherwise. But in this world<br />
there is nothing that doesn't carry risks, and the judgement hat3<br />
bean made by successive governments, Labor and non Labor alike, that<br />
the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. The most simpliatic<br />
approach to this issue is to assume that if Australia and the rest<br />
of the non Soviet block were to disarm, that that brings world peace.<br />
There is no evidence to sustain that at all, we would be running<br />
greater risks. W<br />
Cordeaux: Are you embarrassed that Bill Hayden has..<br />
obviously pointed to the north-west..<br />
PM: Of course I am not embarrassed. He has not said<br />
anything new in that respect. Anyone who knows anything about wuorld<br />
strategic balance, has known that in respect of these bases it<br />
has been said before, Bill was just in the context of' an important<br />
speech that he was making, and re-emphasising that point, nothing<br />
new about it.<br />
Cordeaux: So the bases will stay, and we will live up to<br />
our side of the alliance.<br />
PM: We certainly will. We are not going to indulge<br />
in the stupidity of assuming that unilateral neutrality and disarmament<br />
is going to add to world peace,. it is likely to add to instability.<br />
If I could see in the Soviet Union marches of millions of people,<br />
demonstrating disarmament, then this whole thing would have more<br />
impact. What we've got to do, and what we have done, we've done<br />
more in our year in office than any government in the history of<br />
this country, is to work sensibly for disarmament. Not unilaterally<br />
but across the board. I'm proud of the fact that in November of<br />
last year, in the United Nations first committee, which is the<br />
committee dealing with disarmament, an Australian resolution which<br />
New Zealand sponsored with us, was carried. We were able to persuade<br />
the United States which veto, the previous year vetoed that, by<br />
voting against it. They abstained. Now that means there will be<br />
a year ' s work done there sensibly, addressing both sides of the d'uper<br />
power conflict, and try in that way, to get a -reduction in the level<br />
of nuclear and conventional armament. Now that's the way, if you're<br />
sensible, you go about things.<br />
Cordeaux: Can you ever see a time when you would order the<br />
construction or the development of nuclear weapons? </p>
<p>PM: No, I can't see that. That's as I see the world.<br />
Neither Bob Hawke nor anyone else, for ever, into every conceivable<br />
circumstance, whether you're talking about this Issue or anything<br />
else, exactly what you would do. All I can say is, that as far<br />
as I'm concerned, it wouldn't happen, I can't eee that it would aidd<br />
to Australia's capacity to try and add to the possibility of amoe<br />
peaceful world, it's not on our agenda.<br />
Cordeaux: Have you heard anything about the sub base thai:<br />
South Australia has been trying to get and sub construction,<br />
it would be a target though<br />
PM: If you're building them *. in this world if you<br />
take on, whether it's in politics or anything else, if you<br />
say you won't do anything because there's a possible risk in doing<br />
it., then we would still be in the caves. We as a government, are3<br />
looking at the question of' the building of uubmarines, in Australia,<br />
replacement submarines, A number of States are interested in having<br />
this facility ordered to them to do that work. John Bannon I muist<br />
say to his credit, has been extraordinary vigorous in pushing the<br />
case of South Australia. Now, I can't commit my government at this<br />
stage, who will get the contract, all of this will be examined, but<br />
South Australia could certainly not have had a more vigorous advocate<br />
than John Bannon in pushing of the case.<br />
Cordeaux: Seems to be a choice between Newcastle and South<br />
Australia. PM: Robin Grey also put in a bid from Tasmania. The<br />
Western Australians could be interested, and certainly Queensland<br />
is interested, so just about every state.<br />
Cordeaux: Could it be suggested that we need it more?<br />
PM: I'm sure if you're in South Australia you would<br />
see the case as being overwhelming for South Australia. But I<br />
understand it's particular position because you've had a falling<br />
off of employment in the vehicle industry and it would be very<br />
useful to be able to, to the extent that there is some continuing<br />
reduction of the motor vehicle industry in South Australia, if that<br />
was to occur, then you've got people with the training, experience<br />
and qualifications. So I understand that arguement, and that's one<br />
of the facts that will be taken into account.<br />
Caller: The bomb threat to you in Parliament House, I<br />
was just wondering how did they feel after leaving Parliament Houee<br />
under that sort of threat.<br />
PM: I don't know how the others felt but I am not<br />
affected by these things, I not trying to sound brave or anything,<br />
it is just a fact of life. I think if you get worried about these<br />
sorts of issues, you're just not going to do you job effectively.<br />
I have basic confidence in the security forces and police, that they<br />
will do their job to the best-of the ability. As I said before,<br />
compuared with many other countries in the world, we are fortunate.<br />
I think there are some people in the community who perceive advantage<br />
in playing these things up. I think it is beat that they be given<br />
as little publicity as possible, I think they tend to perhaps excite<br />
some people to action.<br />
// 6 </p>
<p>PM: In regard to Parliament House, there perhaps<br />
needs to be a review to see whether security there can be tightened<br />
up somewhat, because you've got the basic problem that parliament<br />
is the house of the people, it's where their affairs are being<br />
discussed, and you really want to have 8 situation where people can<br />
8s freely as possible go into, see that parliament. Particularly<br />
when it is operating. Against that desire which I think is very<br />
important. You do also have to sensible and try ensure that liuieO<br />
are not going to be unnecessarily endangered. I think there w il<br />
be a review of the security situation, but I hope that it ia not.<br />
going to result in a situation whore there is going to be any<br />
significant dernanution in the possibility of ordinary Australians<br />
to go into their Parliament.<br />
Caller; I think the potential bomber was feeling like a<br />
lot of Australians do, in that he is threatened with nuclear war.<br />
Especially those people in Alice Springs where they're very cl otie.<br />
to Pine Cap.<br />
PM: I don't want to appear rude, but that is the most<br />
unadulterated nonsense I have every heard in my life. If you have<br />
got the position where you say a person is concerned about a nuclear<br />
war and of death and destructio ' t to people, and that you are going<br />
to express your concern about death and destruction and harm to others<br />
by threatening the lives yourself or other people, now that's a logic<br />
that escapes me absolutely.<br />
Caller: A lot of people are threatened or feel threatened,<br />
and probably like your colleagues in Parliament House they felt<br />
threatened and had to get out of there. It isthe wrong way, and I<br />
don't know why governments any where in the world should went nuclear<br />
weapons. PM: I agree, that is why my government has done more<br />
in the international forums to press for the reduction of nuclear<br />
weaponary and to prevent its spread beyond the five powers that<br />
have that capacity at the moment. All I've been saying is that I<br />
wish people would exercise some logic in distinguishing between<br />
desire, which I have as strongly as anyone in this country, to secure<br />
nuclear disarmament, between that question and the question of<br />
mining and export of uranium for peaceful purposes. They are two<br />
entirely different matters as the central non-proliferation treaty<br />
recognisesa. 2nd Caller: As an ex-serviceman, your now song for Australia<br />
( anthem), when we swore ourselves in as soldiers, we swore allegiance<br />
to Her Majesty the Queen, does this mean we are now going to swore<br />
allegiance to you?<br />
PM: Certainly not. The anthem has nothing to do with<br />
the oath of loyality and I noticed In this morning's paper, they are<br />
desperately discredited and hopeless opposition through the person of<br />
Mr Rosher in Perth, it was suggested that we are going to take the<br />
Royal out of our Royal Australian Navy and our Royal Australian Airforce<br />
.7/ </p>
<p>PM: That is totally untrue arid is a measure of the<br />
depths of despair that they hove descended. They are going to<br />
disappear off the Austrlian political scene altogether if they<br />
keep telling lies like that. No it doesn't, effect that at all.<br />
What it means is that Australia, now we are an independence<br />
of a nation, is going to have its own national anthem, as I have<br />
said recently when I announced the decision, I have been appalled<br />
in the past at the time of the Olympics, when you see a situation<br />
where an athelete from Britain gets up and wins a medal, the I6ou<br />
Save the Queen is played, an Australian gets up later and wins a<br />
medal, the same national anthem is played. We are a different<br />
nation to the Brits, I love them and respect them, but we are a<br />
different independence of a nation. 1 want to see the position<br />
when Australians do something they identified as Australians.<br />
When you went to the war, you didn't go there thinking you weren't<br />
fighting for Australia, you were fighting for Aus ralia. Our causes<br />
were also identified with the causes of Britain. Let me remind you,<br />
if' you think back to that period, the great Australian Prime Minister<br />
John Curtin, had a fight with Churchill because Chirchill wanted to<br />
say well we won't worry about Australia'sa war in the Pacific, we'll<br />
keep you here fighting in the middle-east, and when we've fixed<br />
that up if Australia hasn't been gobbled up then, you'll go back then.<br />
John Curtin said look my friend, the primarily obligation of the<br />
Australian Defence Forces is the defence of Australia. Now don't<br />
lets get confused in these things, we as Australians, have a primary<br />
obligation to Australia, not to some other country. They are primarily<br />
responsible for Australia, and in having a national anthem for<br />
Australia, is in no way, implying directly or indirectly that the<br />
oath of loyality to the Queen will not be made. She is remember<br />
this, the Queen of Australia, under the law of this country. She<br />
is the Queen of Australia.<br />
Caller: If an Australian soldier was awarded a medal in<br />
the field of battle, would it be a British Order or is it going to<br />
be an Australian Order.<br />
PM: Up until this time, you've had the situation<br />
where we have used those British Orders, and I must state quite<br />
directly to you, there is a bit of a problem at the moment, for<br />
instance, the Victoria Cross, that is a distinctly British Order<br />
and we've got to keep a situation whore in my judgement, the<br />
opportunity for Australian servicemen in the hopefully unlikely<br />
event that they are going to be in another war that this sort of<br />
tradition and opportunity for them to participate in that is kept<br />
alive. But that is a matter we are looking at, because we<br />
we are not about to destroy traditions, that is a negative approd'ch.<br />
What I and the government want to do within where tradition is<br />
very important, but within that frame work we also want to make! sure<br />
Australian tradition, and the capacity for Australian traditions, is<br />
enhanced, and we've got marry the two things together.<br />
Cordeaux: Just on the subject of Waltzing Matilda, as a<br />
folk song, the Americans couldn't possibly have copyright over it.<br />
see8/ 7 </p>
<p>PM: As soon as this raised with mep I have had the<br />
Attorney General's Department working on it, a lot of work here and<br />
in the United States, as soon as it is clarified, the legal position,<br />
and if it emerges that there is some right outside this country and<br />
the United States, I can assure that I will. initiate action to try<br />
and see that it comes back to where it belongs.<br />
Cordeaux: Everyone will agree with that.<br />
Caller: A question about Senator Ryan's proposal foi<br />
affirmative action. Given the fact that 7( 1% of registered unemployed<br />
are men, and we have men leaving the state because they can't get<br />
jobs, I find it to have a proposal whereby we are going to try<br />
and increase the amount of women in the work force. How can you<br />
justify that?<br />
PM: What is involved in the concept~ of the affirmative<br />
action let me say what we are doing. We have prepared what, is<br />
called a green paper, and the difference between a green paper and<br />
a white paper is that a white paper is a way in which government<br />
announces what it is going to do, a green paper is a basis for<br />
discussion. That green paper will now be circulated in the community<br />
and give everyone the opportunity of making submissions of points of<br />
views, and that will lead us into a decision. We are going to have<br />
s joint working party from employers, trade unions and other interested<br />
groups, helping to have a dissemination discussion under the green<br />
paper. Having said that is what going to happen, the concept behind<br />
it is not that you are going to force employers to have a quota,<br />
and increase quota that must be so many women, we are simply going<br />
to be saying it is the fact that about 37% of the work force is<br />
female. If women weren't in the work force, if they withdrew for<br />
some reason, this economy would collapse. They are an important part<br />
of the work force with rights. With equal rights. We can't in this<br />
society say yes we believe in equal rights for all human beings, then<br />
say we don't really believe in it. In particular something like<br />
of the workforce is female, now what we are saying is that historically<br />
women have had lesser opportunities and rights within the workf~ orce<br />
and we're saying in cooperation with larger firMa, that will be<br />
confined to firms employing more than 100 people, that cooperatively<br />
they should seek to improve the opportunity for women to move through<br />
their employment so they are just not confined to particular menial<br />
categories, they have the opportunity to go for any position. That is<br />
an absolutely laudible correct and decent thing to do. It is n~ ot<br />
saying to employers here's a quota that you must have women, it is<br />
recognising that women are equal human-beings to men, they are<br />
entitled to the same rights.<br />
Caller: I disagree...<br />
PM-. If you think as a man you are superior to a women,<br />
you are entitled to that, I don't happen to believe it.<br />
Caller: By equal I mean having the same function. Obviously<br />
the men and women are equal in status, but what I am saying biological<br />
differences.. 0 09/ </p>
<p>9. PM: Of course there are biological differences, but<br />
that doesn't mean that because a woman, and what we are talking about<br />
is the women who has the reproductive function of actually bearing<br />
the child, that doesn't mean that she is an inferior person with<br />
lesser rights.<br />
Caller: That fact is often not recognised in these sorts<br />
of policies, the fact that women want easy access into the labor<br />
market and easy access out for that sort of reason. Therefore their<br />
asp irations to get to the top would not be same as men..<br />
PM; How can you possibly from the comfort of your<br />
non-bearing situation make that ascertion or assumption. What do<br />
you know. I don't want to be rude, but the blatant arrogance of<br />
your assumption that you know what women want to ' do, that women<br />
don't want to achieve satisfaction by becoming engineers or top<br />
executives, it is an arrogant assumption that I don't accept.<br />
Caller: It is a matter of degree, obviously the<br />
woman who can do those positions quite well<br />
PM: You say, ' the woman', your condescending attitude<br />
' the woman' that can do those things quite well, you have no quarrel<br />
with. It is total arrogance on your part to assume that some women<br />
may be able to do it, but generally speaking women of course can't<br />
do it as well as men, there is no basis for it. Women in the<br />
history of this world in the areas of science, look in the area of<br />
politics, Mrs Gandhi and Prime Ministers in other areas, aviation,<br />
you can look at science, women have shown that they have the capacity<br />
to do things as well as, and in many cases better than men. It is<br />
a complete contradiction of what I think is fundamental to a democracy<br />
and the end of the 20th century that women have equal rights to men<br />
to put in these assumptions that you do, that we must regard them as<br />
inferior. Let me make one final point, It is imperative that people in<br />
responsibility see those attitudes are not allowed to emerge in a<br />
way in which women are seen to be inferior, they are not. In saying<br />
all those things, the position of my government is one which clearly<br />
respects the wishes of women who see their total sense of fulfillment<br />
in the home and being wives and mothers. That is going to continue<br />
for very many women to represent their total sense of fulfillment<br />
and in nothing that I have said, is there implication that they are<br />
any less deserving of the concern of the community. The role that<br />
they fulfill is an irreplacable one, and is for very many of them,<br />
still totally what they want in terms Of satisfying their aspirations<br />
and ensuring that we do provide for women who want to go into thd'<br />
workforce an equality of opportunity. That-carries no implication<br />
or denegration of those women who don't want to go into the workforce.<br />
Cordeaux: That could be worth a few more points on the<br />
popularity poll. know<br />
PM: I don't if it is worth it or not. I am simply<br />
saying that is what the truth is.<br />
Caller; Talking about equality for women, my question is<br />
when are you going to be fair to the men and give them a pensicon at<br />
or stop the women until 65. 1 worked on until 68 before I glet a<br />
part pension. We worked hard to get our home. Another thing, look<br />
after the old age pensioners. </p>
<p>PM: Let me say this madam, it is recognised by<br />
pensioner organisations of this country that the Labor Party which<br />
is the one political organisation in this country which has moved<br />
towards fairness to pensioners. In the 1970s we were the ones<br />
which set the target of 25% of average earnings to move up the<br />
pension and in government between 72 and 75 we moved to do that<br />
against the opposition of our political opponents. Now that we<br />
are back in office we have started again. We have lifted pensions,<br />
and we will be doing all that we can to lift them again.<br />
Caller: We've got to keep our homes and land,. I get a<br />
part pension of $ 60 a--week. My husband gets nothing because where<br />
he was working at 50,. he had to leave. He is strong and<br />
healthy, he can't get any money at all. We are living out of that<br />
a week, we are having to live on our savings that we saved all<br />
our lives. We have never had a holiday, we put that money asidaq<br />
we are living on our savings now. Quick to the point, look aftatr<br />
the older people.<br />
PM: All I can say is that is precisely what we are<br />
doing, and I am glad to say that has been recognised by welfare<br />
and community organisationa, that is what we have been doing. I<br />
am not avoiding the fact that there is recognition and very glad<br />
to see in today's press a major employer agreed with us. We have<br />
got to make sure that we don't pay pensions to people who absolutely<br />
don't need them, we must avoid double dipping, we should avoid the<br />
situation for instance, a person like myself who has one form of<br />
superannuation, a very generous one, isn't allowed to dip in again<br />
to the public purse because there are those of us in the community<br />
who don't need a public assistance and others who very do need it.<br />
We are going to make sure that we bring about a fairer community<br />
so that those elderly people in the community or have retired and<br />
have made their contribution to our society, are going to get the<br />
assistance they deserve.<br />
Thank you. </p>
