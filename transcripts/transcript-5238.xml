PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 20 January, 1980<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
This week I had the pleasure of receiving in Canberra, the<br />
Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Ohira.<br />
We had extensive discussions covering a wide range of bilateral,<br />
regional and international matters.<br />
I believe our talks were highly productive.<br />
It is a mark of the maturity and strength of the relationship<br />
between Japan and Australia that a Japanese Prime Minister<br />
can fly here for a brief visit and, with a minimum of formality,<br />
get down to solid and frank discussions on the international,<br />
economic and strategic issues which concern us.<br />
It shows that we have developed an effective working relationship,<br />
over a long period of time, of great mutual benefit.<br />
One of the more important matters Mr Ohira and I discussed was the<br />
expansion of the cultural basis of our relationship, so that the<br />
level of understanding between our peoples can reach the level that<br />
exists between our governments.<br />
Much progress has been made in this area but more needs to be done.<br />
We. are taking a number of initiatives to realise this..._<br />
The Australian Government will be contributing to the extension<br />
of the Australia, Japan and Western Pacific Economic Relations<br />
Project at the Australian National University.<br />
The Japanese private sector is already organising fund raising for<br />
this purpose, and Mr Ohira has indicated that the project had his<br />
co-operation and support.<br />
We are increasing funds for the Australia-Japan Foundation.<br />
We will be pursuing arrangements for working holidays for Australia's<br />
and Japan's young people in each other's countries.<br />
And we are pressing ahead to reduce air fares to a scale comparable<br />
to that already achieved on other international routes out of Australia<br />
In the trading and investment area, I urged Mr Ohira to encourage<br />
greater participation by Japan in the development of Australian<br />
resources and energy supplies, and also in putting the two together in<br />
Australia rather than in Japan to produce Australian-processed products </p>
<p>2<br />
The concept of a Pacific Basin Community was also a major theme of<br />
our discussions.<br />
The Western Pacific area has abundant human and natural resources<br />
and is one of the fastest growing areas in the world.<br />
Japan and Australia will have an important co-operative part to<br />
play as opportunities grow for greater regional co-operation in<br />
development. The Pacific Basin Community concept is a forward looking idea, and<br />
we agreed that as a first step, we will discuss it with our friends<br />
in the region.<br />
If the response is encouraging, Australia would be prepared to<br />
sponsor a seminar for this purpose later this year at the Australian<br />
National University, hopefully one of the first of a series of<br />
such seminars around the region.<br />
I look forward to the further development of this concept if our<br />
consultations with. other countries indicate an interest in taking<br />
it further.<br />
Mr Ohira's visit came at a time of increasing international concern<br />
about events in Iran and especially Afghanistan.<br />
Mr Ohira assured us and I quote " the Japanese position<br />
( on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan) is identical to the position<br />
taken by Australia".<br />
The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan represents the greatest threat<br />
to world peace and stability since World War II.<br />
We should especially understand the fact that Afghanistan,-a non-aligned<br />
country, did not prevent it being invaded by the Soviet Union.<br />
And it is absolutely critical that the free world meets the<br />
challenge of impressing upon the. Soviet Union an understanding_<br />
that there are clear limits to its aggression.<br />
If Soviet aggression is allowed to procced unchecked into the<br />
neighbouring countries of Iran and Pakistan, and into the Persian<br />
Gulf area, the consequences for the free world would be momentus:<br />
and disastrous.<br />
Some would argue that this is a " worst case" option, but our advice<br />
is that the prospect cannot be ignored.<br />
It must be anticipated in advance, We must use our resources to<br />
prevent it.<br />
The overwhelming United Nations vote of condemnation of the<br />
Soviet Union's aggression 104 in support, only 18 against<br />
shows the. depth of world-wide revulsion and concern about what the<br />
Soviet Union has done..<br />
The challenge is now, to the NATO countries in particular, but<br />
also to smaller countries and others in the region, to make known<br />
to the. Soviet Union that its ruthless opportunism will not be<br />
tolerated. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
We must do what we can to build a free world consensus on these<br />
issues.<br />
With this same objective, I will shortly be making a working visit<br />
to the United States and to Britian for discussions with<br />
President Carter and Mrs Thatcher.<br />
In addition, the Foreign Minister, Mr Peacock, is planning to visit<br />
the ASEA21 countries and India and Pakistan.<br />
We will be discussingwith. these various governments the<br />
present international situation and in particular, the implications<br />
for future security and stability following the Soviet invasion<br />
of Afghanistan an invasion that has given all nations, whether<br />
aligned or non-aligned, cause for grave concern about broader<br />
Soviet ambitions.<br />
If detente with. the Soviet Union is-ever to be restored, and if<br />
nations are ever again to conduct relations with the Soviet Union<br />
on a basis of trust, it can only be through the free world<br />
its small, middle and large members alike showing now the<br />
strength, unity and determination that have characterised itsgreat<br />
achievements in the past.<br />
I believe that in this regard, Australia must not shirk its<br />
responsibilities, and the. Government will discharge these in the<br />
long term interests of all Australians.<br />
