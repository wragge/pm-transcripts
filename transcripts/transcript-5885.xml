A R<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIASUNDAY, 8 AUGUST 1982<br />
( THE FOLLOWING IS A PRESS STATEMENT BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR JOHN HOWARD)-REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL 1982 REVIEW<br />
The Remuneration Tribunal's 1982 Review, which is being released<br />
today, sets a clear example of wage restraint. The Tribunal,<br />
properly, has placed great weight on the submissions put to it<br />
by the Government regarding the economic situation facing Australia.<br />
As a result, the Tribunal has decided that the salary increases<br />
for politicians, senior officials and judges, should be kept as<br />
low as is reasonable, and well below the increase in the C. P. I.<br />
since its last review.<br />
The Tribunal's modest and responsible findings have come at a<br />
critical time. If this lead is followed by major Australian<br />
companies at senior levels of their own organisations, by other<br />
wage-fixing tribunals, and by wage and salary earners generally,<br />
it will help us turn the corner in achieving the levels of wage<br />
restraint throughout the workforce which are now so vital,<br />
particularly in the cause of saving jobs.<br />
I welcome the Tribunal's findings. It has done a very gooa job.<br />
