ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J KEATIN, HP<br />
TO THE EAST JAVA CHAMBER OF COMMC] C AND INDUSTRY<br />
SURABAYA, THURSDAY, 23 APRIL 1992<br />
I am very grateful for the opportunity to address you this<br />
evening here in Surdbaya where the great success of<br />
Indonesia's economic transformation is perhaps most obvious.<br />
Where the newly liberalised Indonesian economy is serving to<br />
restore a city to its historic commercial pre-eminence.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, Australia is also in the process of<br />
transformation.<br />
our perspective on the world is changing.<br />
As never before in our history we recognise that our future<br />
substantially lies in our own region. In Asia and the<br />
Pacific. in Indonesia,<br />
That is where the great opportunity is.<br />
we know that seizing that opportunity will be no easy thing<br />
to do.<br />
It involves something like a revolution in the way we do<br />
things, and the way we think about ourselves and the world.<br />
When you have been for so long a branch office of empire<br />
there is tendency to go on expecting special treatment long<br />
after head office stopped opening the mail.<br />
If this were characteristic of Australia once, it is not<br />
true now.<br />
We do not entertain the notion that someone else will do the<br />
hard things for us.<br />
or to us. we do not accept the idea that we are forever at<br />
the mercy of the major economic powers. I.. r P I V) I IU VI II W </p>
<p>2<br />
In 1992 we k~ now that we need a degree of national energy,<br />
inventiveness and purpose which we have not had before In<br />
peacetime. You will see evidence of this emerging attitude in AUStralia<br />
now. In the near future, I believe, you will see evidence of it<br />
in the Asia-Pacific region. You will see evidence of it in<br />
Indonesia especially, perhaps, here in Surabaya.<br />
These days to the majority of Australians the-need to<br />
integrate our economy with that of the region is selfevident.<br />
we long since ceased to believe that we could sustain<br />
ourselves by exporting commodities, and manufacturing for a<br />
tiny market behind tariff walls,<br />
The seventies and the early eighties showed us we had to<br />
change. As a result of the economic policies of thei Australian<br />
Government since 1983, Australia is now a m~ ore efficient,<br />
productive, competitive, and outward-lookipg nation,<br />
It is more geared to exports, more receptive to foreign<br />
investment, and more resilient in the face of external<br />
economiic pressures.<br />
Like Indonesia, Australia reformed its economy in the<br />
eighties. We floated the dollar, and allowed a more competitive<br />
exchange rate to be determined by the market.<br />
We reformea our indmstrial relations, so that we have far<br />
fewer strikes, greater flexibility, and lower labour costs.<br />
We reformed our financial system, so that interest rates and<br />
not quantity controls balance supply and demand for funds#<br />
and moot financial business can be transacted free of<br />
government control.<br />
We reformed spending and taxing, so that we now have one or<br />
the lowest tax regimes and one of the most disciplined<br />
government sectors of any OECD nation.<br />
We adopted industry policies to lower the crippling level of<br />
protection we inherited, so that we are now one of the most<br />
open economies in the world.<br />
The results of reform have been spectacular in Australia, as<br />
they have been here in indonesia.<br />
Over the eighties Australia's economy expanded by more than<br />
one third. Today we export more than twice the quantity of<br />
goods we did at the beginning of the eighties. 4 H p I-' LC , 1,4C j ij i I </p>
<p>i LL 3<br />
Led by tourism, we have more than tripled exports of<br />
services. We export nearly four times the val~ ue of<br />
manufactures we did in 1980.<br />
The meazures introduced in our One Niation Statement in<br />
February will build upon these earliÃ± er ref orms and entrench<br />
the trend towards a more open and outward looking economy,<br />
while at thie same time stimulating growth.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, the change in your own economy has<br />
been no les3 dramatic or fundamental. The economic<br />
transformation of Indonesia over the last 20 years has been<br />
nothing short of astonishing.<br />
Between 1966 and 1991, your economy expanded 450 per cent.<br />
Over the last few years growth has averaged around 7 per<br />
cent and growth rates of 5 to 6 per cent are expected to the<br />
end of the century.<br />
Indonesia has gone from a commodity-based economy to on6<br />
geared to industrial expansion and manufacturing exports.<br />
Through a sound policy of encouraging foreign investment,<br />
bureaucratic reform, financial deregulation, support for<br />
manufacturing, and lifting of trade barriers, you have<br />
emerged as a dynamic and competitive economic force.<br />
Today, our very different countries are changing in ways<br />
which will enable us to find much more ' common ground the<br />
economies of Australia and Indonesia are beginning to<br />
complement each other.<br />
Certainly, I see the strengthening and broadening economic<br />
relationship between our two countries * as representing the<br />
direction-in which the AuStralian economy must go.<br />
Towards the world. Toward greater diversity in our exports.<br />
Above all, toward stronger connections with our region.<br />
The developing economic relation with Indonesia shows the<br />
way we must go.<br />
our exports to Indonesia are rapidly increasing, as are our<br />
imports from Indonesia.<br />
The trade is also demonstrating greater diversity, with<br />
Indonesia manufactured goods joining timber and petroleum in<br />
sales to Australia, and Australians construction, banking,<br />
telecommunication, engineering and legal services joining<br />
wheat and metals in our exports to Indonesia.<br />
Manufactured goods, machinery, computers, telecommuunications<br />
products, power generation equipment and motor vehicle* have<br />
all grown to form a larger proportion of Australia's exports<br />
to Indonesia. H pf-IlL, : Uv i1o ul I r </p>

Ten years ago, Australian exports to Indonesia totalled<br />
$ 356 million.<br />
Today they are worth nearly $ 1.5 billion.<br />
Over the last two years imports from Indonesia have nearly<br />
doubled.<br />
Just as trade has grown in recent years, invest" Ont between<br />
Australia and Indonesia has also diversified and<br />
consolidated. Australia is now the Sth largest foreign investor in<br />
Indonesia, accounting for about billion in assets.<br />
There are more than 120 Australian companies with<br />
Significant interests in Indonesia. In the areas of coal<br />
mining, and to a lesser extent gold mining, Australia is the<br />
dominant source of investment.<br />
The number of companies investing in manufacturing<br />
industries is also rapidly increasing.<br />
In services too, such as business and engineering<br />
consultancy, Australian companies are becoming a significant<br />
presence. Ladies and gentlemen, one area which has enormous economic<br />
potential for both our countries and where Australia is<br />
already making a significant contribution is right here in<br />
East Java.<br />
For many years novr, Australia's development assistance<br />
program in Indonesia has had a strong focus on the special<br />
needs of eastern Indonesia,<br />
East Java is the fastest growing commercial area in<br />
Indonesia. Already home to key agricultural industries, it<br />
is quickly becoming a major industrial and manufacturing<br />
region with activity in petrochemicals, shipbuilding,<br />
cement, metal processing, machine tools, and<br />
pharmaceuticals. The manufacturing sector has already attracted significant<br />
foreign investment, including from Australia. Ready-mix<br />
concrete, plasterboard, roofing tiles and medical products<br />
are areas in which~ Australian companies have existing or<br />
planned investments.<br />
Infrastructure development, such as in natural gas<br />
production and processing and bulk water supply, is also a<br />
major area for investment, and one in which Australian<br />
companies are already or potentially involved.<br />
Tourism 13 a growth area, as is evidenced by the presence of<br />
aQNTAS office here in Surabaya. </p>

S<br />
Now Australian business is beginning to realise the<br />
potential of the area in such fields as dryland farming,<br />
tourism, mining and manufacturing.<br />
Through your introduction of special tax incentives to<br />
encourage foreign investment in eastern Indonesia, this<br />
potential can be more easily realised.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, as our commercial relationship<br />
continues to grow, institutional arrangements will need to<br />
be developed to manage the relationship at all levels.<br />
On thio visit we have concluded five important bilateral<br />
agreements ranging from taxation to science and technology<br />
collaboration. -I<br />
We have agreed in principle to conclude four other<br />
agreements from investment protection to maritime<br />
boundaries.<br />
And most significantly, we have agreed to explore the idea<br />
of setting up a regular ministerial meeting, chaired by our<br />
foreign ministers, and including economic ministers, which<br />
will give a more coherent framework to the multitude of<br />
ministerial exchanges now taking place.<br />
Just as such institutional arrangements can assist bilateral<br />
commerce, regional institutions can and do play a critical<br />
role in regional economic development.<br />
in the regional sphere, Indonesia's active participation in<br />
ASEAN and APEC have been crucial in ensuring the success of<br />
these forums.<br />
since its formation in 1967, ASEAN has proven its value as a<br />
vehicle for economic growth in the region. The cohesion and<br />
stability it has provided has enabled Australian business to<br />
develop links with the region with confidence.<br />
Today, the fastest area of growth of Australia's exports is<br />
to the ASEAN Group. It has now displaced the EC as our<br />
secon? lairges-t export market after North-East Asia.<br />
As the largest member of ASEAN, Indonesia has played a<br />
pivotal role in providing clear direction and stability<br />
within ASEAN itself.<br />
Jutt as ASEAN has provided the basiS for long-term growth<br />
and stability in South-EaSt Asia, APEC will, I believe, form<br />
the foundation for economic cooperation throughout the Asia<br />
Pacific region. The 15 members of the APEC group accounts<br />
for half the world'a GDP and 40% of world trade.<br />
APEC provides us with the first ever opportunity to harness<br />
and direct the powerful economic forces at work around the<br />
Pacific Rim. TEL </p>

By bringing Japan and the US, the two most powerful<br />
economies in the Pacific, together with the other economies<br />
of the Pacific Rim, APEC can work to ensure that these<br />
forces develop to the benefit of Us all and to the benefit<br />
of the open, multilateral trading system which has<br />
underpined the economic dynamism of the region.<br />
Indonesia's response to the APEC initiative has been one of<br />
the most positive and construtlv-e of all the APEC nations.<br />
Your strong endorsement of APEC at the recent ASEAN Summit,<br />
and your offer to host the 1994 APEC Ministerial Meeting,<br />
signal your continuing commitment to this very important<br />
initiative. In the multilateral sphere, Indonesia and Australia have<br />
worked together in the Cairns Group in suppbrt of a<br />
successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of negotiations<br />
in the GATT.<br />
As we have discussed with our Indonesian hosts, Australia<br />
and Indonesia are now concerned that a protracted stalemate<br />
in negotiations may jeopardise a successful outcome of the<br />
Round. The open trading system has been a key factor in the growth<br />
of countries liXe Indonesia and Australia, and it is<br />
important that the major economies continue to work to<br />
strengthen and develop wurld trade.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, Australia is changing. Our economy is<br />
emerging from a recession in more competitive shape than it<br />
has ever been.<br />
We are casting aside the baggage of the past and directing<br />
our energies towards greater integration with our region.<br />
And within this region we look especially to our<br />
relationship with Indonesia our largest and most important<br />
neighbour as a material and symbolic example of the way<br />
our two countries are resolving themselves for the 21st<br />
century. TnTQ1. P. P* </p>
