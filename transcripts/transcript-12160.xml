<p>3. President Megawati Soekarnoputri and Prime Minister Howard noted Australia and Indonesia's shared interest in security, prosperity and democracy in South-East Asia. The Prime Minister reaffirmed Australia's support for Indonesia's territorial integrity and unity, noting that Australia's national interests are closely linked to Indonesia's stability and prosperity. The two leaders underlined the importance of a comprehensive approach to solving the problems of Aceh and Irian Jaya through advancing the primacy of dialogue, greater respect for human rights, and the implementation of special autonomy status within the unitary state of the Republic of Indonesia.</p>
<p>4. Prime Minister Howard reaffirmed Australia's commitment to support Indonesia as it addressed its social and economic challenges and to support international efforts aimed at assisting Indonesia's economic recovery. He affirmed that Australia would continue to encourage the international community's support for Indonesia, including in the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and welcomed the importance placed by the Government of Indonesia in reaching agreement with those institutions on programmes of economic reform and management of Indonesia's debt.</p>
<p>5. The President expressed Indonesia's appreciation for Australia's development cooperation programme for 2001-02. The Prime Minister briefed the President about the Australian development cooperation programme, particularly regarding its focus on Eastern Indonesia, education and training, and governance. Beginning this year, the programme includes further initiatives in economic and financial management, legal reform and assistance for non-government and other organisations.</p>
<p>6. The two leaders welcomed the strong commercial links between Australia and Indonesia, noted that two-way trade had grown by 25 per cent over the past year to a record level of $A6.4 billion, and expressed their desire to see bilateral trade grow further from both sides. They welcomed the trade and investment mission led by the Australian Minister for Trade, the Honourable Mark Vaile, MP, to Indonesia in February 2001, and looked forward to a return visit to Australia by an Indonesian trade and investment mission.</p>
<p>7. The two leaders agreed that the Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum provided an effective mechanism for furthering bilateral cooperation. They welcomed the substantial progress made on the Joint Plan of Action agreed at the meeting held in Canberra on 7-8 December 2000, and looked forward to the sixth Ministerial Forum in Indonesia in mid-2002.

The Prime Minister reaffirmed Australia's readiness to assist with the resettlement and repatriation of East Timorese refugees. The two leaders underlined their view that the international community's support in this matter is highly important. The continued full cooperation by all parties concerned, including UNTAET, UNHCR and other relevant international humanitarian agencies with the Government of Indonesia is key to the success of the process.</p>
