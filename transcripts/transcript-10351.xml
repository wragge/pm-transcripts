INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIME<br />MINISTER, JOHN HOWARD.<br />STAN GRANT PRESENTER:<br />Good morning again. John Howard could be forgiven right now for contemplating<br />that old saying about not pushing too hard for what you want, because you just<br />might get it. Certainly the Prime Minister, if he was ever in fact in any doubt, must<br />now fully appreciate the difficulties of office. Mr Howard would've hoped to have<br />been out selling his budget, one he trumpeted as a political circuit breaker.<br />Instead, he's back out on the stumps selling his Wik plan, and still ticking away is the<br />time bomb of media ownership. Add to that, Pauline Hanson's popularity, high<br />unemployment and even criticism of his own leadership and you have a picture of<br />someone perhaps anything but relaxed and comfortable. The Prime Minister joins<br />us this morning, along with our panel, Seven's Glenn Milne and Anne Davies from<br />the Sydney Morning Herald.<br />Prime Minister, good morning to you.<br />JOHN HOWARD PRIME MINISTER:<br />Good morning Stan, how are you?<br />Rownm &amp; Aztnia Montorin Swvics Pty Ltd ACN 006 369 982<br />Suit S01 MH eiy rwso BuonhanCinemr .

I suppose<br />into the lion's den. You've weren't how... howled down though. What's your<br />reaction to the response you received?<br />HOWARD: I thought it was a very very good meeting. I didn't expect them to stand and cheer<br />because they've been fed an enormous amount of misinformation by people who, I<br />think, are being a little mischievous. It was a first class opportunity for me to get<br />across the guarantees that the ten point plan gives to Australian pastoralists, and all<br />in all, I was very pleased about the outcome. I didn't expect them to<br />overwhelmingly endorse, but I think I made an impression and Tim Fischer and I felt<br />well pleased after the meeting.<br />We we had an opportunity of talking to them directly and to give them a lot of<br />assurances. I was amazed, absolutely amazed, at the level of fear and<br />misinformation. GRANT: Well well let's deal deal with that. Because I saw someone last night, a<br />woman with a couple of children on her hips, saying she didn't know how she was<br />going to to feed the children in the future.<br />HOWARD: Well I mean this is this is it.

Because in no way is anybody's title at risk. In no way can<br />anybody, even if nothing is done about the Wik decision, can anybody be driven off<br />their property. But we are going to do something about the Wik decision.<br />We're going to wind it right back. Not as far as they might want us to go, but we<br />are certainly going to wind it back. But can I just say again, nobody can lose their<br />farm, nobody can lose their pastoral lease. Nobody can be prevented from carrying<br />out their pastoral activities and an expanded range of primary production activities.<br />And they can do that without having to get the permission, or the approval of any<br />Aboriginal native title claimant.<br />GRANT: Personally, the the fact that you were you were out there on the weekend,<br />just so soon after the budget, having to to sell the the Wik proposal. Some<br />have described you as fog bound by the whole the whole Wik issue.

I I think political leaders ought to get out of the television<br />studio, you know, pardon your presence, ought to get out of the television studio a<br />little more often and actually go and talk to people who are affected by something.<br />I mean, there were fifteen hundred to two thousand people there yesterday.<br />They'd come from all over north Queensland, some from the Northern Territory,<br />some from New South Wales, some from Western Australia. They feel deeply<br />about this issue. They are entitled to hear from their Prime Minister and Deputy<br />Prime Minister about it and so far from yesterday's experience discouraging me<br />from face to face contact with people, it's actually renewed my belief in the value of<br />it. GLENN MILNE SEVEN NETWORK:<br />I don't think there's any doubt though Prime Minister that some people out there<br />probably feel that you've been preoccupied with the wrong issues, even though<br />Wik is obviously a very weighty and important one. Now that you've got the<br />legislation through the party room, it's going into the Parliament. Will you now back<br />off selling Wik, or are you still going to continue?<br />HOWARD: No, I think no, look I'm not going to back off doing anything that's important.<br />But I think now that it's through the party room, the political interest in it will be<br />less because everybody now knows it's government policy and I'm not going to<br />change it.

Obviously, it's not going to be as preoccupying over the<br />next few weeks as it has over the past few weeks. But this idea that being prime<br />minister is only about the budget, is only about industrial relations, is only about<br />cutting things, or about the taxation system, has always been wrong. Getting Wik<br />right, getting native title right is very important to the long term economic future of<br />Australia, but it's also important for the social cohesion of the nation.<br />We have to get the balance right. The pendulum has swung too far in the direction<br />of Aborigines in the argument. What I'm trying to do is bring it back in the middle,<br />but I'm not going to push it back over the other side because it needs to be in the<br />middle, and that's what I think Australians want.<br />MILNE: Prime Minister you say that you're very determined on this issue. You won't brook<br />any changes in the Senate.<br />HOWARD: Mmm.

But I'm not going to have it watered down.<br />But what we do is something we'll decide if and when that that that arises.<br />GRANT: One of the things that has been raised, a possibility of a a double dissolution on<br />this iss... issue Are you prepared to go that far?<br />HOWARD: Oh look I'm not going to say what we'll do if the Senate were to knock it back. Tim<br />Fischer and I have had a discussion about that and we've got a very clear view of<br />what our response might be. But for reasons<br />GRANT: Is it some something you can discuss?<br />HOWARD: No, Tim and I have discussed it. Of course we have.

I I just can't believe we waited for<br />thirteen years to get into government. We've been in government fourteen months<br />and these characters are running around talking about leadership. I mean, you've<br />got to be joking.<br />GRANT: How seriously do you take them?<br />HOWARD:<br />Well I I noted at the end of last week the the absolute anger of the great<br />majority of the members of the National Party towards a few and I I think his<br />leadership is very solid. He really has done a great job for the bush and he's done a<br />terrific job for Australia as a trade minister and he's very highly respected in the<br />business community.<br />I noticed when I had that fourteen person business delegation with me in China,<br />how warmly they spoke of the job that Tim Fischer is doing for Australian<br />exporters. He's always out there, getting a market, pushing an Australian product.<br />Now that's his job and anybody who criticises his leadership is is politically stupid<br />and has no understanding of the absolutely invaluable job that he's doing for<br />Australia. I think it's just a touch of, what shall we call, autumn madness.<br />ANNE DAVIES SYDNEY MORNING HERALD:<br />But hasn't there been a breakdown of trust between yourself and the National<br />Party organisation over Wik?

Now I've I<br />spent Friday evening with the Federal President of the National Party who's a<br />pastoralist in Queensland and I've a very good personal relationship with him. He's<br />a very pleasant individual, Mr MacDonald. We've had a slight difference of policy on<br />this, but that's part and parcel of the of the process and he indicated to me on<br />Friday night that he thought the whole idea of the visit to Cloncurry and Longreach<br />had been very good and that the smaller group we met on Friday night there<br />was a lot of shifting of opinion during that discussion. Because for the first time I<br />think they really understood the protections that are in the plan.<br />But you have these sorts of things along the way. You've got to involve the<br />organisation. You've got to talk to it. But at the end of the day, the people who<br />have been voted into office, that's Tim Fischer and myself, have got the authority<br />and the responsibility to take decisions.<br />MILNE: Prime Minister, if we can turn now to the budget.<br />HOWARD: Mmm. MILNE: One of the most negative reactions seemed to come from, what I would term, one<br />of your natural constituency groups, the Business Council of Australia. I think Stan<br />Wallis, the President, said that he didn't think the Government had a great deal of<br />strategic vision.

Firstly, all of the things that we<br />said we were going to do before the election, industrial relations reform, capital<br />gains tax relief for small business, family tax reform, health insurance rebates, all of<br />those things have been ticked off. And one of the things the Business Council has<br />been very strong about is reducing the budget deficit.<br />I mean, we did inherit a deficit of ten and a half billion, and by the end of our first<br />term we'll have a surplus of one point six billion. Now that is a spectacularly<br />successful implementation of what the Business Council has been on our back about<br />for a long time. And it's made all the more puzzling to me by the fact that at the<br />same time as I'm being criticised by the President of the Business Council, that very<br />same body is asking the Government for spending measures and tax concessions<br />that would total four to five billion dollars a year.<br />MILNE:<br />What was this in their pre-budget submission?<br />HOWARD: No, no in a submission they've put to another government inquiry. They want the<br />restoration of DIFF, they want the restoration of the R&amp; D tax concessions that<br />were paired back in the last budget, they want the restoration of the tariff<br />concession change incidentally DIFF and the tariff concession we promised to do<br />in our election campaign and they want a four to five per cent tax rebate on<br />exports. Now, all of those things in their own right, I suppose have merit, but where's the<br />money coming from? Now where do you find another four to five billion dollars and<br />Raiwna AuiaiM onftoerr Sorvk Pty Lld AcN 006 369 9a2<br />Ste SOt Henry Lawsm OinasW Cerm.

Now you you can't, I<br />mean a government has got to strike a balance, and and where does that<br />money come from? I mean, we have already cut what people would call middle<br />class welfare, the HECS charges, the nursing home charges, all of those things that<br />were implemented in the last budget represented a a heavy targeting of the<br />government dollar. Now there's a limit beyond which you can't go otherwise you<br />do start cutting into the genuine social safety net and I've got to strike the balance. I<br />have obligations to all of the Australian people.<br />MILNE:<br />You talk about striking a balance, could we just turn to industrial relations?<br />HOWARD: Mmm. MILNE: lan McFarlane, the Governor of the Reserve Bank said this week that he felt there's<br />more to be done on labour market deregulation. You're now looking at further<br />changes to the unfair dismissal laws, do you think there's another raft of changes to<br />IR legislation coming through? Is that your plan?<br />HOWARD:<br />Well I think it's a a I mean, we don't sort of have a a have a bag, a<br />second wave in the drawer, but it's it's an evolutionary process, you always have<br />to be looking at further changes. But this debate about IR, we really have to sort of<br />stop perhaps talking in code.

They<br />shouldn't say, well we want further industrial relations reform. If if what you<br />mean is, we should cut the minimum wage in the hope that if the wages bill of<br />employers is lower, then they'd be able to employ more people. If you're not<br />meaning that, we'll you should specify what you what you what you really<br />do mean.<br />I think there's a lot of sort of double talk in this whole industrial relations debate<br />because most of the major changes, other than getting rid of the minimum wage,<br />we have made. Now I made it dcear before the last election that we were going to<br />guarantee a safety net, as far as the minimum wage was concerned, and that was<br />the take-home value of the take-home pay value of the award. Now, I'm not<br />going to walk away from that. I'll make other changes. I'll entertain any other<br />changes, but that rock solid guarantee that I gave in relation to the take-home pay<br />under the award stays, and I'm not going to compromise that or walk away from it.<br />GRANT: Prime Minister if I could just just take take a short break there. We'll come<br />back after this and deal with the other area of reform that's been called throughout<br />the community, taxation reform. Just after this.<br />COMMERCIAL BREAK<br />GRANT: Welcome back. Our guest this morning, Prime Minister John Howard. Prime<br />Minister, before the break we were talking about industrial relations reform.

GRANT: Does does that include revisiting a GST [ indistinct]?<br />HOWARD:<br />Well you can't you can't have a reform unless you look at all of the options.<br />Now, I can't deny that in the twenty or so years that I've been in politics, I I have<br />been over the years a consistent supporter of tax reform. I think of all of the people<br />that are, you know, have had a bit of an influence and a bit of a say in Australian<br />politics over the years, I've been a more consistent supporter of tax reform than<br />most. And but we made a commitment about this term of government, quite<br />precise commitment, and I'm I'm obviously very conscious of that and I I<br />intend to honour that commitment.<br />But if you if you're saying to me, do I envisage the Australian taxation system<br />remaining as it is for the next five or ten years, I'd have to say no.<br />GRANT: The the other area of course of change, a bit more imminent perhaps than<br />tax change, is in media ownership.

I mean, this is a very interesting debate.<br />Everybody's got a view. I think perhaps we ought to have a new ground rule on this<br />debate that that journalists who have a very strong personal view in this ought to<br />declare their positions before they write columns, or ask questions, or give<br />interviews because there's a lot of I mean, James Packer and and Kerry<br />Stokes and others are out there openly stating what their view is.<br />I think it's also fair to say that many working journalists, quite rightly, and I I<br />don't for a moment contest their right to have a view and to lobby for that point of<br />view, which many of them are now doing. But I think the public ought to know<br />where they stand when they make comments on these things and offer opinions<br />and views. Because it's not just the Packer's and the Stokes' and the Murdoch's<br />who have a view on this, journalists have a view on it as well. They're entitled to<br />have those views, but we are entitled to know their views as well as know<br />[ indistinct]...<br />GRANT: We we actually have someone here who perhaps could be could be affected<br />DAVIES: I'm a Fairfax journalist and I have a strong view about it.

We are going to examine all of the<br />options and we're listening to your views as as well as reading your views on it<br />which and we're listening to the views of other people, including Mr Packer and<br />Mr Stokes and Mr Murdoch and Mr Price of the of IEL, who's got an interest in<br />Fairfax. I mean, it's a it's a very very interesting debate and it'll perhaps go on for<br />a little while longer before we take a decision.<br />There's a lot of opposition in Australia to a further concentration of foreign<br />ownership.

If I could be forgiven for quoting your opposition number<br />in Sydney and that's the Sydney Daily Telegraph, that paper has an enormous range<br />of views within its borders. Whereas some other media outlets, like the ABC on<br />political and social issues, tend to have too narrow a spectrum of views and it's one<br />of my criticisms of the ABC that it doesn't have a a right wing Phillip Adams, if I<br />could put it like that. If the ABC had a greater spectrum of views, then I think a lot<br />of people would feel that it was a a better disbursement of the taxpayer dollar.<br />But their views tend to be so predictable, you you can almost close your eyes<br />and say, well I know what the ABC's going to say.<br />GRANT: Prime Prime Minister, we'll have to pause there. We'll come back after the<br />break and perhaps we can ask you questions again [ laughs].<br />HOWARD:<br />Sure, okay. COMMERCIAL BREAK<br />GRANT: Prime Minister, welcome back. A lot of talk about cent... centring around the<br />media ownership issue, is talked-about deals and that certain people are going to<br />to make a big killing out of any change to media ownership rules, including Michael<br />Kroger, reported to be receiving something in the range of a seven million dollar<br />bonus if the media ownership rules are changed in favour of Kerry Packer.

I was just making the<br />obvious comment that I don't see the Australian taxation system remaining static<br />indefinitely, but I'm conscious of what we said before the last election and I'm not<br />going to walk away from that commitment, and it remains rock solid. But looking<br />forward, you have to acknowledge that the Australian taxation system is less than<br />perfect and I don't know how anybody can argue otherwise and I've certainly<br />always been, in the long term, in favour of quite fundamental change and reform.<br />But it's a question of of timing, it's a question of explanations, it's a question of<br />balance.
