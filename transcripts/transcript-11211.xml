    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..........</p>
<p>Thank you very much Mr Chairman. I intend to make a very short introductory</p>
<p> statement to allow the maximum amount of time for questions.</p>
<p>As you all know the relationship between Australia and Japan is very</p>
<p> close. Japan has been for a long time and remains Australia's best</p>
<p> customer and therefore as Prime Minister I pay a great deal of attention</p>
<p> to the relationship both at a personal level between myself and the</p>
<p> senior people in the Japanese Government and also at a broader national</p>
<p> level between our two societies.</p>
<p>The Australian economy is enjoying a period of very strong growth</p>
<p> at present. The growth rate is between four and five per cent a year.</p>
<p> We have just received some unemployment figures which have taken our</p>
<p> unemployment level to the lowest in 10 years. It is now down to 7.2</p>
<p> per cent which historically is a very low figure in our country over</p>
<p> the last decade. We have the lowest interest rates and the lowest</p>
<p> level of inflation for the past 30 years and in three years my Government</p>
<p> has eliminated a budget deficit of over $10 billion Australian and</p>
<p> we now have a budget surplus of a half per cent of GDP.</p>
<p>The Government has just taken through the Parliament a major reform</p>
<p> of our taxation system which involves the introduction of a broadly</p>
<p> based goods and services tax as well as major reductions in personal</p>
<p> income tax. That reform is to be followed very shortly by proposals</p>
<p> to reform our business taxation system. All of which together will</p>
<p> contribute to making the Australian economy more competitive internationally.</p>
<p>In my discussions with Mr Obuchi and other senior figures in the Japanese</p>
<p> Government I have emphasised the strengths of the bilateral relationship.</p>
<p> I've pointed out that we have the lowest level of industrial disputes</p>
<p> in Australia in almost 90 years. That we continue to be a very reliable</p>
<p> supplier, not only of raw materials but also of other products we</p>
<p> continue to be a country that welcomes large numbers of Japanese tourists</p>
<p> and we of course are a nation which is now experiencing an extraordinary</p>
<p> growth in teaching of the Japanese language amongst young Australians</p>
<p> and therefore a greater understanding of the culture of this country</p>
<p> by tens of thousands of young Australians.</p>
<p>I'm encouraged by the signs of greater growth in the Japanese economy.</p>
<p> I do not believe the Japanese Government has received as much credit</p>
<p> as it deserves for the reforms it had been undertaken in the financial</p>
<p> sector and elsewhere. In my discussions with Mr Obuchi I have naturally</p>
<p> underlined the leadership role Japan has, not only in the region but</p>
<p> in the world as its second largest and strongest economy, and that</p>
<p> it is not only important for Japan but it is also important for the</p>
<p> region and the world that the Japanese economy grow more strongly</p>
<p> and that some of the sluggishness of recent years be put behind it.</p>
<p>We continue in Australia to press for more liberalisation of world</p>
<p> markets, particularly in agriculture. We would like to see more open</p>
<p> access for agriculture in this country. It is our largest market for</p>
<p> food. I said to Mr Obuchi that both of us should work together at</p>
<p> the upcoming APEC meeting to encourage a leaders declaration calling</p>
<p> for a comprehensive world trade round which I believe is important</p>
<p> to the process of further liberalisation.</p>
<p>The final point I'd make in my opening remarks is that we spent some</p>
<p> time in our discussions talking about the situation in Indonesia.</p>
<p> I indicated to the Prime Minister of Japan that I felt that Indonesia</p>
<p> had undertaken a remarkable and historic move towards greater democracy,</p>
<p> that the elections had been conducted with comparatively little blood</p>
<p> shed and the indications were that the ballot had been essentially</p>
<p> transparent and open and that it was a very considerable achievement</p>
<p> that a nation of 211 million people after an authoritarian system</p>
<p> being in place for 40 years was able to embrace a more democratic</p>
<p> approach and that the Indonesian Government deserved more credit for</p>
<p> what it had done. We both agreed on how important it was to Indonesia's</p>
<p> international representation that a clean, open and transparent ballot</p>
<p> take place in East Timor to determine the future status of that part</p>
<p> of Indonesia, whether it be as an independent country or as an integrated</p>
<p> territory, enjoying autonomy within the Republic of Indonesia. Any</p>
<p> questions?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Two questions if I may. Despite the sluggish state of economy in both</p>
<p> Japan and within the other parts of Asia, the Australian economy has</p>
<p> been enjoying very robust growth under your leadership, and also under</p>
<p> your leadership you now have for two consecutive years a fiscal surplus.</p>
<p> Can you give us a pointer as to how this was possible? I suppose it</p>
<p> was due to the excellent policies followed by yourself Prime Minister</p>
<p> Howard. But what is the clue.</p>
<p>The second question. I wonder is it possible for you to consider elimination</p>
<p> of the withholding tax altogether within Australia. It is considered</p>
<p> that the withholding tax system Australia is not very favourable because</p>
<p> it taxes for example on top of the interest rate 10 percentage points</p>
<p> on the interest rather when any foreign party were to make investment</p>
<p> into Australia. So if for example the Japan Export Import Bank were</p>
<p> to consider investment into Australia there would be taxation on the</p>
<p> interest rate. So this withholding tax has been undermining, if you</p>
<p> will, every potential investment by the Japanese into Australia. Of</p>
<p> course I would imagine this is due to the very rigid stance and policy</p>
<p> followed by your ministry of finance and in any given countries around</p>
<p> the world, bureaucrats are known to have very, shall we say, rigid</p>
<p> stance. But may I invite you Prime Minister to study this matter and</p>
<p> consider altogether the elimination of the withholding tax.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>In relation to the first question, the reason why Australia has been</p>
<p> able to stare down the Asian economic downturn is really I think due</p>
<p> to the fact that over the last 10 to 15 years governments of different</p>
<p> political persuasions in Australia have embraced very significant</p>
<p> reforms and we have now begun to get the real benefit of those reforms.</p>
<p> I think there are five major changes, I call them the five pillars</p>
<p> of the modernisation of the Australian economy. The deregulation of</p>
<p> the financial system which was begun under the former Coalition government</p>
<p> in 1982-83 continued with the support of the Coalition in Opposition</p>
<p> by the Labor party. That included the floating of the Australian dollar</p>
<p> and the clever management of our exchange rate over the last 18 months</p>
<p> has been one of the reasons why the Australian economy has done so</p>
<p> well.</p>
<p>The tariff reforms, the reductions in tariffs that were undertaken</p>
<p> by the former government, once again with Coalition support, I think</p>
<p> they were very valuable indeed. The present government's tackling</p>
<p> of the budget deficit has been of major value and without it I don't</p>
<p> believe there would have been the international confidence in Australia</p>
<p> nor the domestic confidence and the contribution getting rid of that</p>
<p> deficit made to reducing our interest rates.</p>
<p>Also under the present government there has been of course the major</p>
<p> reform of the Australian industrial relations system. We now have</p>
<p> the lowest number of industrial disputes in 90 years and I think in</p>
<p> a sense as far as reform is concerned, industrial relations over the</p>
<p> last couple of years has been, to use an Australian expression, the</p>
<p> bolter. I think what it has done is to produce a greater boost to</p>
<p> productivity than many people imagined. The reforms went much further</p>
<p> than some of the critics two or three years ago suggested. And finally,</p>
<p> of course although the tax reforms haven't come into place I do think</p>
<p> that the fact that we were able to embrace tax reform and get it through</p>
<p> has given a great deal of heart to people who believe in the long-term</p>
<p> cause of reform.</p>
<p>So the answer to your question is that it's the fruit of a series</p>
<p> of measures taken and I'm very happy to acknowledge the contribution</p>
<p> of the former government in a couple of areas in relation to financial</p>
<p> deregulation and tariff reform. Without that we wouldn't have been</p>
<p> as good. But I will make the point that in Opposition we supported</p>
<p> the former government in relation to both of those things, so you've</p>
<p> seen the benefits of 10 or 15 years of intelligent reform.</p>
<p>Withholding tax I should tell you that we will be getting the major</p>
<p> recommendations of our business tax review committee at the end of</p>
<p> this month. So I won't try and speculate as to what it might recommend</p>
<p> but it has been a very comprehensive review.</p>
<p>The other thing, can I emphasise, is in relation to the first question</p>
<p> that the skilful management of a flexible exchange rate meant that</p>
<p> we were able to divert exports away from weakening markets towards</p>
<p> other markets when the Asian downturn hit and that has been a very</p>
<p> major reason why we have done so well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Michael Millett, Sydney Morning Herald and Melbourne Age.</p>
<p> Japan is coming under increasing pressure both internally and externally</p>
<p> to adopt some of the structural economic reforms that you have just</p>
<p> been referring to. In your talks with senior Japanese business leaders</p>
<p> over the past few days do you detect a willingness and capacity of</p>
<p> Japanese industry to undertake what are often painful reforms such</p>
<p> as labour market restructuring?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Michael, yes to a greater extent than I have found in the past, yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Head of the International Division within the [inaudible]. I am also</p>
<p> a member of the planning committee here at this National Press Club.</p>
<p> I'd like to ask a question about how you foresee the future of APEC.</p>
<p> APEC was a forum created under the leadership of Prime Minister Hawke</p>
<p> back in 1989 and in 1994 it set objectives for further liberalisation</p>
<p> at Bogor. However, some say that APEC has been losing momentum as</p>
<p> a result of various factors inclusive of the downturn in the Asian</p>
<p> economies and also the financial turmoil in the Asian economies. Some</p>
<p> even say that the role of APEC has now been concluded. I am wondering</p>
<p> if you could share with us how you foresee the future of APEC and</p>
<p> its role thank you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A fair amount will depend on how the next meeting goes. The last meeting</p>
<p> we really marked time. What happens at the next meeting will be quite</p>
<p> important. I am still optimistic but we have had a decision from the</p>
<p> American administration overnight on lamb exports from Australia and</p>
<p> New Zealand which does not bode particularly well for the cause of</p>
<p> more open trade. But we will continue to argue very strongly the important</p>
<p> role of APEC but clearly the next meeting will be quite important.</p>
<p>Could I just add that APEC is still the best medium, longer-term hope</p>
<p> for the region. It's still offers a lot more hope by way of higher</p>
<p> living standards and growth particularly for some of the poorer countries</p>
<p> of the region than any other understanding.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Nigel Blunden from the Macquarie Radio Network, Mr Howard. In your</p>
<p> talks with Prime Minister Obuchi and the other government officials</p>
<p> how do you believe your message on free trade has been received?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's very clearly understood. I'll know whether it's been received</p>
<p> when I know the outcome of some of the gatherings over the next few</p>
<p> months particularly the APEC gathering. It's outcomes that really</p>
<p> matter in relation to things such as trade liberalisation rather than</p>
<p> rhetoric. Now, there's a general commitment to further trade liberalisation,</p>
<p> there's a very strong commitment to a comprehensive WTO round. I think</p>
<p> all of us have to wait and see what the final outcome is.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Thank you very much. I am from the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper a question</p>
<p> about East Timor. Australia has made a substantial commitment to the</p>
<p> situation in East Timor however if we compare interest of the Japanese</p>
<p> commitment if we compare the past Japanese commitments to countries</p>
<p> such as Cambodia it seems that the current Japanese commitment to</p>
<p> East Timor seems to be less robust. Prime Minister, what is your view</p>
<p> on the Japanese commitment to East Timor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Could I answer that in the context of Japan's very generous contribution</p>
<p> to helping the region through recent economic difficulties. Japan</p>
<p> has been very generous and along with Australia the only other country</p>
<p> to contribute to each of the three rescue packages. It is to be expected</p>
<p> that because of the proximity of East Timor to Australia and the history</p>
<p> between our two.or the territory and our country, that Australia would</p>
<p> make a big contribution. That's to be expected. So I don't think it's</p>
<p> strictly fair to contrast Japan's contribution with Australia's given</p>
<p> that there is a clear and evident proximity in the case of Australia.</p>
<p> We would naturally make the point that if there is a continuing burden</p>
<p> in relation to East Timor it can't be born by Australia alone. And</p>
<p> we do need help from other countries and thus far that help has been</p>
<p> forthcoming although Australia is making a very big contribution.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Hello, this is Bruce Elsworth with Bridge Financial News and I have</p>
<p> questions about your statement that it said, "skilful foreign</p>
<p> exchange management has helped to redirect exports to other markets"</p>
<p> and I am wondering if this means that you think a continued weak Australian</p>
<p> dollar will be necessary to maintain exports? And also a question</p>
<p> about unemployment rate - if you have any future goals for further</p>
<p> reductions in the unemployment rate? Thank you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I never talk about the level of the Australian dollar only its skilful</p>
<p> management. I express no view about future levels. As far as unemployment</p>
<p> goals are concerned our only goal is to drive unemployment down as</p>
<p> low as possible. We don't have a particular numerical target we just</p>
<p> want to get it as low as possible. We are pleased it has come down</p>
<p> but we still have a long way to go.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Two questions if I may. A question about agriculture. You talked about</p>
<p> seeking greater access for agricultural products. I wonder if you</p>
<p> could be more specific as to what you will be pursuing, for example,</p>
<p> are you going to be seeking further reductions in the tariff rate</p>
<p> or will you be seeking greater allocation within the minimum access</p>
<p> vis a vis Australian products? Do you have any specific, shall we</p>
<p> say, proposals or suggestions that you have brought with you on this</p>
<p> visit? And secondly, did you have any concrete discussions with the</p>
<p> members of the Japanese Government during your visit about expanding</p>
<p> access?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we take the view that in an area like this there's no hard and</p>
<p> fast and better way of achieving access. It varies according to product,</p>
<p> it varies according to circumstance. There has been an improvement.</p>
<p> We acknowledge that but it is still a market that in many areas, as</p>
<p> we found was rice, is not easy to break and we still have a long distance</p>
<p> to go. And the general desirability of greater access, of course,</p>
<p> is swept up in the world trade round. If you have a successful world</p>
<p> trade outcome you have greater access because markets that are currently</p>
<p> closed are open or further liberalised as a result of the world trade</p>
<p> outcome. It's not something that you can do entirely on a bilateral</p>
<p> basis. It's better to be done within a multilateral framework.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, Fran Kelly from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</p>
<p> The World Heritage Bureau is meeting in Paris on Kakadu and the question</p>
<p> of whether to list Kakadu as world heritage in danger. The decision</p>
<p> won't be made until Monday but I understand there are some signals</p>
<p> coming already. Can you give us any update on how the Australian Government</p>
<p> thinks it's going?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I have a natural caution - born of political experience - about</p>
<p> interpreting early returns, Fran. I don't know what is going to come</p>
<p> out of it. We do not believe that it should be listed as endangered</p>
<p> and we have put a very strong case - very strong case. But you will</p>
<p> also know that the Australian Government is resolute in the belief</p>
<p> that proper environmental concerns have already been taken into account.</p>
<p> We do not believe that there should be any departure from decisions</p>
<p> already taken and there will not be any departure because we believe</p>
<p> within the domestic sovereignty of Australia all care has been taken</p>
<p> and all proper procedures have been followed.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Associated Press Television News. We have a question regarding PNG</p>
<p> and Taiwan. So [inaudible] raising around so it could [inaudible]</p>
<p> the prosperity in regional economy, regional prosperity. So Mr Skate</p>
<p> has stepped down. So how is Australia viewing the situation and also</p>
<p> is there any possibility at all for Australia to consider to take</p>
<p> some sort of measurement of PNG in Taiwan? PNG's policy towards Taiwan.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What was the.what was the last bit about Australia?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is there any possibility for Australia to consider to take some sort</p>
<p> of measurement..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Some measures?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Some sort of steps towards PNG's policy towards Taiwan?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am not going to comment on the domestic politics of Papua</p>
<p> New Guinea. Mr Skate has stood down and it's up to the political processes</p>
<p> of his country to chose a successor. I merely say that Australian</p>
<p> governments for some years now have adhered very strongly to a one</p>
<p> China policy and I repeat that position today. We recognise the people's</p>
<p> Republic of China and that remains the position. That does not prevent</p>
<p> us having productive commercial associations with Taiwan. We'll continue</p>
<p> to do that in accordance with well understood modalities but we don't</p>
<p> intend in any way as far as Australia is concerned to divert from</p>
<p> the one China policy.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Asahi Shimbun Newspaper. Many view that the Asian currency or financial</p>
<p> turmoil has subsided at least for the time being and that the Asian</p>
<p> economies are on their way to recovery. In the last two years Australian</p>
<p> Government, as well as the Central Bank, has made substantial contribution</p>
<p> toward the stabilisation of this situation in the Asian economies.</p>
<p> Now having said that, some predict the possibility of the resurgence</p>
<p> of financial turmoil in Asia down the road and there has been much</p>
<p> discussion about introduction of preventive mechanisms so within the</p>
<p> Asian economies vis--vis the resurgence of financial turmoil in the</p>
<p> future. Two years ago Japan with an understanding had proposed the</p>
<p> possible establishment of the so-called Asian Monetary Fund as a way</p>
<p> to prevent financial turmoil in the Asian economies. I wonder how</p>
<p> the Australian Government would react to such a fund and such preventative</p>
<p> mechanisms? Would Australia be supportive and do you think that Australia</p>
<p> might even take a very active role by making financial contribution</p>
<p> to such fund? Thank you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are in favour of some reforms to the international financial system.</p>
<p> We're not particularly attracted to the regionalisation of the international</p>
<p> financial architecture. That has been our position for some time.</p>
<p> We don't support the possible emergence of an Asian IMF. We don't</p>
<p> think that makes sense and I would have thought from a long term point</p>
<p> of view given Japan's status as a world financial power it necessarily</p>
<p> makes long term sense for this country either.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I'm afraid time is fast running out so if I may use or abuse the prerogative</p>
<p> of the moderator I would like to ask the final question if I may.</p>
<p> Here in Japan we now have a discussion over the possible designation</p>
<p> of the song Kimi Gayo as the national song. Kimi Gayo has</p>
<p> unofficially been treated as the national song for Japan for many,</p>
<p> many years and now we're talking about the possible official designation</p>
<p> of the song Kimi Gayo as the national song. However, there are parties</p>
<p> or camps that are strongly opposed to the official designation of</p>
<p> this song as the national song or national anthem rather. When I was</p>
<p> covering Australia some 23 to 24 years ago I recall this similar type</p>
<p> of discussion that ensued in your society as to whether or not to</p>
<p> designate God Save the Queen or Advance Australia as Australian national</p>
<p> anthem. I wonder if you could share with us Prime Minister what the</p>
<p> most difficult part was you believe in designating Advance Australia</p>
<p> as the Australian national anthem. Also if you have any views as to</p>
<p> the designation of Kimi Gayo as the national anthem I would</p>
<p> appreciate it and we would certainly appreciate any advice that an</p>
<p> Australian Prime Minister can make on this point. Thank you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I will take the second part of the question first and say I don't</p>
<p> offer a view as to what Japan's national anthem should be. On the</p>
<p> designation of Advance Australia Fair that in fact was made the national</p>
<p> anthem of Australia by a proclamation of the Hawke Government in 1984</p>
<p> following a plebiscite in which it received more support from the</p>
<p> Australian people that any of the alternatives. But in the interests</p>
<p> of full disclosure I should tell you that in that plebiscite I personally</p>
<p> voted for an alternative and that was Waltzing Matilda. But I should</p>
<p> quickly add that Advance Australia Fair has become very widely accepted,</p>
<p> very enthusiastically sung and I don't mean by that personal confession</p>
<p> to in any way reopen debate. But I do like Waltzing Matilda.</p>
