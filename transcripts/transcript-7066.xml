TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, TOWN\ SVILLE, FRIDAY 19 DECEMBER 1986<br />
Question: Well, you must have had an early Christmas present, Sir, with<br />
the OECD report that's. been issued?<br />
PM: Well, it was very good. We're pleased with it, but not ent irely<br />
surprised, because I've been saying, as has Paul Keating) that<br />
we've had the right policies In place, and we've expressed<br />
Cautious optimism for 1987. I'm pleased that the OECD has<br />
confirmed that. It shois that they expect quite solid growth<br />
rates in 1987.<br />
Mr Howard said on radio this morning that he thought that...<br />
PM: Who's that?<br />
Mr Howard.<br />
PM: Ohl I just () heard.<br />
that those figures were too O+~ ASh.~<br />
PM: Yes, well what do you expect, they are dedicated to trying to<br />
write down the Australian economy. They weep tears whenever<br />
good news comes out. That's why Mr Howard is treated with<br />
contempt by the Australian people, because Australians do not<br />
like people running their country down, and that's all that Mr<br />
Howard does. That's why he won't be leader for very much longer.<br />
Q. He-. cl~ i~ ed;-in tact., that thote-figures actually reflect the<br />
Treasury view?<br />
1. </p>
<p>I I PM: Oh, does he? Well, I don't think anyone takes any notice of<br />
Mr Howard anymore. The facts are quite clear we have been<br />
saying on the basis of the statistics that have been coming out<br />
in regard to investment, to trade, exports, imports, that the<br />
policies that we've put in place are workinbg, and that judgement<br />
has been confirmed now by many people, and the OECD report Is<br />
simply the latest confirmation of what we've been saying. I<br />
repeat, it's a tragedy that Mr Howard has a vested interest<br />
in trying to run his country down, and he's paying a very heavy<br />
price for that lack of commitment to,. the welfare of his countrymen.<br />
The OECD did warn that unemployment would rise cy acout<br />
percent? PM: Well they have indicated that it could be at about 8.5 percent.<br />
There's going to be rising employment I refer to the increase<br />
in the workforce we would hope that we may be able to bring<br />
unemployment down in 3987. The major thing we have to do is<br />
to ensure that we don't allow too high a level of economic<br />
activity, because if you do that you will put an<br />
unbearable strain upon our external account position. Now<br />
it would be easy to just pump prime the economy,<br />
lift up levels of activity and thereby, perhaps fcr the shortterm<br />
increase employment activity. But you've got to have<br />
the right timescale. You've got to make the tough declsions<br />
now still exercise a degree of restraint, so that we will<br />
get on top of that external accou't problem, and when we do<br />
that we'll ensure that we have a lowering Interest rate regime<br />
during 1987, and we'll put Australia into a position for being<br />
in the strongest basis, the strongest possible basis, for secure,<br />
long-term growth in output and employment. We are not going to<br />
sacrifice the long term for some cheap political stunts now<br />
which might up the activity, the oLutp4 levels, up the emnployment<br />
growth but then lose the external account altogether.<br />
Cri" nt&amp; ~ i-<br />
Mr Hawke, businessmen here isay that the QANTAS reciprocil<br />
rights agreement is stiflifng tourism...<br />
PM: Stifling tourism?<br />
Yes. PM: In Australia?<br />
Yes* man.<br />
Well, en. </p>
<p>Q: o<br />
S8couse there aren't as many tourists coming to<br />
PM: Well, if there's one thing that isn't being stifled in Australia<br />
it's tourism. I mean...<br />
Q:<br />
S But it could be better if there was an open air agreement.<br />
Any chance of that?<br />
PM: You can't just simply say we're going to have an open air<br />
agreement like that. The whole question of international air<br />
agreements between countries is a complex situation. Australia. Ldro. bev<br />
itself is not able to lay down the law as to what will apply,<br />
and I simply go back to the overall question tourism. It<br />
is one of our oustanding successes, not least because of the<br />
activities of the outstanding Minister for Tourism that we have<br />
John Brown. We've had a position where now in this last<br />
year something like one-and-a-quarter million overseas arrivals<br />
we're aiming for two million by our Bicentennial year, 1988.<br />
We're very pleased that, as a result of the efforts that we've<br />
made in promotion and investment allowances, thatQueensland,<br />
and northern Queensland in particular, is sharing very largely<br />
S in that tourist explosion something like a third of those<br />
tourists over 400,000 come here to Queensland. And that's<br />
good.<br />
