FOR PRESS PM. No. o91/ lb9<br />
RiLTLREML. T OF MR ALLEA FAiRAL<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
I deeply regret that Allen Fairhall has decided to<br />
retire. We have worked together since 1949 and he will be a great<br />
loss to the Parliament and to the Cabinet. But he told me some time<br />
ago that he felt he should, in the interests of his health, not stand for<br />
Parliament again. He has given outstanding service to Australia<br />
during twenty years in the Parliament, and has made a particularly<br />
noteworthy contribution as Minister for Defence. We shall miss his<br />
wise counsel in the Cabinet Room.<br />
CANBERRA, 19 August 1969 </p>
