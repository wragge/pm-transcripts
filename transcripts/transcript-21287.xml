The Shadow Treasurer Simon Crean should explain to the Australian public precisely what he means in proposing an intergenerational fund.</p>
<p> Does he have in mind the imposition of a tax surcharge to build up the fund over coming years?</p>
<p>If he's not going to increase taxes to pay for this fund, is he going to run down the surplus?</p>
<p>Who is going to operate the fund and what are its governance arrangements?</p>
<p>These questions need answering.</p>
<p>In this year's Budget, the Government outlined a strategy to meet Australia's demographic challenges by building economic growth and boosting retirement incomes.  Generous new incentives were outlined for people who invest in their own superannuation.</p>
<p>Given its new found interest in planning for the future, Labor should wholeheartedly support these initiatives.</p>
<p>Labor's latest 'promise' of an intergenerational fund comes on top of its promises of:</p>
<p> (i) more spending</p>
<p>(ii) bigger tax cuts</p>
<p> (iii) larger surpluses</p>
<p> (iv) reductions in net debt; and</p>
<p> (v) lower taxation and spending as a share of GDP</p>
<p>Something's got to give.</p>
<p>Mr Crean owes us an explanation.</p>
