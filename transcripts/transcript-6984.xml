PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
AUSTRALIAN RAILWAYS UNION DINNER CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF<br />
INDUSTRIAL UNIONISM IN RAILWAYS<br />
SYDNEY 13 AUGUST 1986<br />
It is a mtatter of great pride and pleasure that I am able to<br />
join you tonight for this dinner marking the centenary of<br />
the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Railways union.<br />
As a forn~ er ACTU President and as a Labor Prime minister it<br />
is, of course, an occasion of special significance when a<br />
union li: ie yours, which spans the industrial and political<br />
wings of the Labor movement, reaches a milestone like its<br />
100th anniversary.<br />
Tonight is an opportunity to pay tribute to your union's<br />
record of service to both its membership and to the railway<br />
industrcy and, in turn, to acknowledge those men and women<br />
who hctve served the union and the wider Labor movement. The<br />
birth In 1886 of your union's predecessor ( the Amalgamated<br />
Railway and Tramway Service Association) coincided with the<br />
first tc-ntative steps to establish a Parliamentary Labor<br />
movement. Those moves found a strong ally in William Schey,<br />
your foundation State Secretary, who became a Member of<br />
Parliamont before the Labor Party was formally established.<br />
Over tho years that relationship between your union and the<br />
ALP has grown into a strong and productive alliance. it<br />
would be an impossible task to list all of the officials of<br />
the ARU in NSW who have made significanit contributions to<br />
the Auztralian Labor Party. But there is no doubt that the<br />
ALP hao been enriched, made more effective by their<br />
contributions. A selective roll call of ARU leaders who have made their<br />
mark should perhaps begin with the late Jack Ferguson, a<br />
former State Union Secretary, a Federal ALP President and a<br />
confidant of Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley.<br />
I am sure that his peers would regard it as no slight to<br />
describe Dr Lloyd Ross, another former Secretary ( who is<br />
with us tonight) as the most learned ARU stalwart to offer<br />
his talents to the broader movement. His benchmark<br />
biography of John Curtin and service to the nation during<br />
his time with the Department of Post-War Reconstruction are<br />
just two highlights of a brilliant career. More recently,<br />
the im~ mediate past secretary Jack Maddox, and the present<br />
leadership of the union, President Harold Dwyer and<br />
Secretary Jim Walshe, have continued this fine tradition. N </p>
<p>The hundred years which the ARU's history spans encompasses<br />
the progression of the labour movement from its formative,<br />
difficult beginnings to the important role which it plays in<br />
today's industrial society, particularly in influencing the<br />
future direction of our nation.<br />
The Prices and Incomes Accord the basis of the most<br />
successful peace-time incomes policy of any Australian<br />
Government is a monument to the evolution of trade union<br />
thinking. The Accord's underlying philosophy, and the<br />
benefits it has brought to the Australian economy, stand in<br />
stark contrast to the history of conflict and confrontation<br />
which the union movement has at times had to endure.<br />
Three years ago my Government set for our nation a simple<br />
and vital program; national reconciliation, national<br />
recovery an. 1 national reconstruction. National<br />
reconciliation between sectional interests was fundamental<br />
if the goal3 of national recovery and reconstruction were to<br />
be achieved.<br />
The Accord miade an invaluable contribution to achieving<br />
national reconciliation and proved to be central for the<br />
achievement of national economic recovery.<br />
we can all be justly proud of reaching such an unprecedented<br />
level of undorstanding about common goals, priorities and<br />
problems. should also be proud of the way the parties to<br />
the Accord have responded to changing economic circumstances<br />
and have maintained the Accord's primary objective of<br />
promoting economic and employment growth : key determinants<br />
of the welfar: e of all Australians.<br />
The ARU knows~ too well the impact of past confrontationist<br />
policies. ' i3hen former governments decided economic<br />
circumstancoo warranted adjustment within the rail industry,<br />
they did notC always either understand the value of, or the<br />
fundamental importance of, consultation with those most<br />
affected the railway workers.<br />
Inevitably, the result was industrial disruption and lost<br />
productivity in the railway industry. Therein lies the<br />
certain folly of confrontation in industrial-relations it<br />
diminishes rather than improves productivity.'<br />
The contrast, at the national level, between consensus and<br />
confrontation-based approaches is clear when this Labor<br />
Government's economic policies are compared with the<br />
divisive ' light inflation first' approach of the<br />
Fraser/ Howard years.<br />
For two significant reasons this approach was abhorrent.<br />
First, it Ghowed a callous disregard for its social and<br />
personal imnpact especially on the job security of bread<br />
winners and on the prospects of young people seeking their<br />
first jobs. </p>
<p>3<br />
Second, the approach failed even by its own narrow<br />
standards; the inflation rate remained high and employment<br />
rose. it was little wonder that in 1983 Australians<br />
completely rejected both the method and result of these<br />
policies. The contrast of the Accord with this approach could not be<br />
sharper. it has had as a basic aim the protection of<br />
employment and the promotion of job opportunities. It is an<br />
infinitely fairer approach because it is designed to ensure<br />
that income claims are arbitrated justly. Because it pays<br />
attention to the value of Government spending on the social<br />
wage in supporting and, when appropriate, improving the<br />
living standards of ordinary Australians it also stands as a<br />
fairer approach. o<br />
I don't ncecd, in this forum, to detail the proof of the<br />
success of our policies over the past three and a half<br />
years. But in an area of obvious relevance tonight, the<br />
latest industrial disputes figures show the lowest annual<br />
level of days lost since 1969. Our predecessor's sorry<br />
achievement was an average level of industrial disputation<br />
more than double these figures. The Accord has on this<br />
evidence delivered industrial harmony replacing the conflict<br />
and disputation which had previously worked to the detriment<br />
of the Australian community.<br />
We have alzo achieved high rates of economic growth without<br />
the wage excplosions which cut short previous periods of<br />
economic expansion.<br />
The general compliance of the union movement with wage<br />
fixing pL-: Thciples consistent with the aims of the Accord<br />
allowed the acceleration in economic growth to be translated<br />
into more jobs, rather than into a debilitating wage/ price<br />
spiral. Before an audience like this the most graphic and relevant<br />
statistic I can cite to demonstrate the success of the<br />
Accord is the creation of more than 600,000 new jobs in our<br />
first throe years in office.<br />
That is an achievement of which this Government is immensely<br />
proud. It is an achievement of which the Trade Union can also be<br />
immensely proud.<br />
It has been your commitment to the Accord processes which<br />
has played such an important role in getting that employment<br />
result.<br />
Under the Accord the living standards of wage earners have<br />
been protected by a combination of wage indexation, tax cuts<br />
and improved social benefits. </p>
<p>The commitments the ARU and most other unions have given<br />
to the basic tenets of the Accord co-operation,<br />
consultation and consensus are proving stronger and longer<br />
lasting than our opponents would have liked them to be. The<br />
opposition never tires of forecasting the-demise of the<br />
Accord. My Government recognises the contribution that rail unions<br />
and employees can make to the development and improvement of<br />
the railways. my colleague, the Minister for Transport,<br />
Peter Morris, consults with the rail unions frequently to<br />
improve understanding and co-operation within the industry.<br />
There have been over twenty such meetings to date.<br />
We have also worked closely with the ACTU and the rail<br />
unions to establish a Railway Industry Council. This<br />
Council will bring together government, management and<br />
unions to develop strategies for revitalising the rail<br />
industry. Peter Morris expects the Council to be<br />
established formally at the next bi-annual meeting of<br />
Australian Transport Advisory Council.<br />
The recent appointment of former ACTU President, Cliff<br />
Dolan, to the Commission of the Commonwealth's own railway<br />
system, Australian National, brings to that body a greater<br />
depth of understanding of industrial relations issues.<br />
Our Government, like the ARU, recognises that an efficient<br />
land transport system is vital to the economy and our<br />
exports. Initiatives to revitalise manufacturing depend on<br />
an effective transport industry. we have revitalised our<br />
public t,. ansport authorities, taken major steps to upgrade<br />
our roadG2, and improved the shipping and road transport<br />
industries.<br />
This Federal Government is the first to pass legislation<br />
enabling interstate road transport operators to be charged<br />
for the cost of road damage. As a result the road and rail<br />
transport systems will be forced to compete on a more equal<br />
footing.<br />
While recognising the continuing importance of rail in our<br />
transport system, it must be recognised that there remain<br />
serious problems. Commonwealth and State Governments fund a<br />
rail deficit of over $ 1.4 billion each year. In the end<br />
there is a limit on the level of support taxpayers can give<br />
industry, particularly in today's tight budgetary climate.<br />
Clearly major changes will be required. Our Government will<br />
ensure that the ARLI is fully informed about, and<br />
participates in the debate about, these changes.<br />
Having said that, you should be in no doubt that this<br />
Federal Government is committed to improving the railways.<br />
We recognise the economic potential for rail authorities to<br />
gain a larger share of interstate traffic. Under the<br />
Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program $ 30 million<br />
has been allocated to urban rail projects. The Australian<br />
Land Transport Program includes an option of some limited<br />
funding for projects to improve the mainline rail network<br />
tied to improvements in commercial and operational<br />
practices. </p>
<p>Our own railway system, Australian National, has seen real<br />
progress under this Government. We enacted legislation in<br />
1983 to allow AN to operate more commercially and revenue<br />
assistance to AN from the Budget has been reduced by 42 per<br />
cent in real. terms since 1982. This is an achievement of<br />
which all involved in AN can rightly be proud.<br />
we have also been prepared to provide AN with up-front money<br />
to implement programs to improve its financial viability.<br />
These include $ 16 million in 1985 to fund an early<br />
retirement scheme and funds to rehabilitate the Tasmanian<br />
railway system.<br />

seeks to achieve its major economic objectives in a spirit<br />
of consensus and co-operation.<br />
Past Governments' objectives were all too often frustrated<br />
because of-confrontation and division.<br />
The importance of the Accord lies in its provision of a<br />
framework C-or consultation and discussion between the<br />
GovernmenZ and the trade union movement about a wide range<br />
of policies. The real strength of this framework is that it<br />
has proved edaptable to changing economic circumstances.<br />
This adaptability and responsibility is being tested again.<br />
As I expla. ned in my recent address to the nation, the<br />
Australian economy now faces a difficult period of<br />
adjustment to the recent-severe decline in our terms of<br />
trade. Auztralia also faces the inter-related problems of<br />
an unsustainably high current account deficit and the<br />
dramatic depreciation of the Australian Dollar.<br />
The decline in our terms of. trade means that the prices of<br />
many of our staple exports have declined in international<br />
markets. The effect of this is that our overall " national<br />
cake" is smaller than it would otherwise have been. In cold<br />
money termsz that is a $ 6500 million loss in national income.<br />
We have n3 alternative but to accept, for a time, reduced<br />
standards of living.<br />
we cannot bury our heads in the sand and pretend nothing has<br />
changed. Let me, at this point, make it quite clear that this<br />
Government does not seek to attribute any blame for these<br />
changed and difficult circumstances to the trade union<br />
movement. On the contrary: the contribution of the unions, through<br />
the Accord, to improving the competitiveness of the<br />
Australian economy has been significant. However, this is<br />
not to dim~ nish the nature and extent of the crisis we, as a<br />
nation, are facing. </p>
<p>6<br />
In simple terms, we have been dealt a dud hand by the<br />
agricultural trading practices of the EEC and the United<br />
States and the collapse in world commodity markets.<br />
A major task of policy in the period immediately ahead is to<br />
spread the burden of adjustment to this reduced standard as<br />
fairly as possible. A fair distribution of this burden will<br />
mean restraint front everyone, governments, businesses and<br />
unions alike.<br />
in my addz-ess to the nation, I indicated some ways in which<br />
the busin. ass, community should co-operate in these difficult<br />
times. I later wrote to major businesses and business<br />
associations requesting restraint both in non-wage<br />
remunerat-cn, such as executive salaries, and in the setting<br />
of prices. Most responses received to date have supported<br />
this request. I am confident that business will play its<br />
part in the overall restraint required.<br />
The restraint required from governments was reflected in the<br />
cuts in State borrowing programs announced after the<br />
Premiers Con~ ference in June. It will also be reflected in<br />
the Budget being brought down by Paul Keating next Tuesday<br />
night. Budgetary restraint means many new policies will be placed<br />
on the sholf for a time, and many existing programs will be<br />
trimmed te the bone. The extent of the restraint required<br />
may not be wall received by many people. However<br />
unpalatable, we must adjust our expectations of the services<br />
governmento can provide in present economic circumstances.<br />
This Governnent has always faced up to the hard task of<br />
fiscal restraint. The Trilogy of Budgetary restraint<br />
commitments announced nearly two years ago represented the<br />
most disciplined framework of restraint adopted by a<br />
post-War Government.<br />
By contrast, our opponents only speak bravely of the n eed<br />
for restraint when in Opposition. When in Government, they<br />
lack the courage to face up to the hard decisions.<br />
Further restraint from the trade union movement is also<br />
necessary. Xn my address to the nation, I made it clear it<br />
will be necessary to argue for a further discount in the<br />
next National Wage Case.<br />
It is a real tribute to the responsible attitude of<br />
Australian workers and their trade union leadership that<br />
there has been considerable wage restraint over the last<br />
three years.<br />
Further restraint is now needed.<br />
I am confident that the union movement will again play its<br />
part in the process of adjustment confronting us all. It<br />
will do this for the sake of protecting employment and the<br />
welfare of all Australians now and into the future. </p>
<p>7<br />
The only alternative to everyone accepting the need for<br />
restraint is the classical medicine of monetary and fiscal<br />
contraction of the economy. We suffered that approach<br />
during the Fraser/ Howard years.<br />
We all remember itt costs in human terms.<br />
In particular, we in the Labor movement remember the<br />
hundreds of thousands of Australians who paid the cost of<br />
those policies by losing their jobs in the ensuing<br />
recession.<br />
A return to such policies would again push the burden of<br />
adjustment onto that section of the Australian community who<br />
would lose their jobs or fail to obtain employment upon<br />
entering the labour force.<br />
This would hardly be consistent with this Government's<br />
commitment to " restraint with equity" which simply means<br />
sharing th3 burden of sacrifice fairly.<br />
Adjustment to our current economic difficulties demands<br />
restraint by the entire community, not a forced and<br />
calamitous drop in the living standards of an unfortunate<br />
few. The trpzde union movement has a vital role to play in<br />
this restraint.<br />
It is vital for Australia's future that this be accepted.<br />
In March 1963, shortly after the Government was elected, I<br />
had the honour of attending a Labor Day Dinner in Melbourne.<br />
on that occa~ 3ion, facing the challenge of reviving the<br />
national economy f rom recession I made a special appeal to<br />
the Labor movement. As I put it then:<br />
" There can be no underestimating the difficulties of the<br />
task entrusted to us by the Australian people. And by<br />
' us' I rean not only those of us in Government, I mean<br />
all of. us the whole Labor Party, the whole Labor<br />
movement."<br />
Again, in circumstances not of our making the Labor movement<br />
has been entrusted with a great and difficult task.<br />
I am confident that together we will meet and overcome this<br />
new challenge.. </p>
