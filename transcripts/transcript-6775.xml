CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY SPEECH BY THE<br />
TO THE ADELAIDE CHAMBER<br />
ADELAIDE 8 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
OF COMMERCE ANNUAL DINNER<br />
NOVEMBER 1985<br />
I AM VERY GLAD TO BE HERE THIS EVENING. I WAS LAST IN THIS<br />
SPLENDID CITY JUST FIVE DAYS AGO WHEN ALONG WITH TENS OF<br />
THOUSANDS OF OTHER AUSTRALIANS I HAD THE GREAT PLEASURE OF<br />
ATTENDING THE INAUGURAL AUSTRALIAN FORMULA 1 GRAND PRIX.<br />
RIGHT AT THE OUTSET, I WANT TO CONGRATULATE JOHN BANNON'S<br />
GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE OF ADELAIDE ON THE OUTSTANDING<br />
SUCCESS OF THAT EVENT.<br />
THE GRAND PRIX CAPTURED THE IMAGINATION OF AUSTRALIANS. IT<br />
DEMONSTRATED ENTREPRENEURIAL FLAIR AND CONSIDERABLE<br />
ORGANISATIONAL ABILITY. THE SUCCESSFUL STAGING OF THE GRAND<br />
PRIX WAS A FINE EXAMPLE OF WHAT AUSTRALIANS ARE CAPABLE OF<br />
ACHIEVING. THE LAST OCCASION ON WHICH I ADDRESSED YOUR CHAMBER WAS IN<br />
1979.<br />
ON THAT OCCASION AUSTRALIA HAD ENDURED NOT QUITE HALF OF THE<br />
PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT'S TERM OF OFFICE. BUT ALREADY WE HAD<br />
EXPERIENCED THREE YEARS OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE<br />
FIGHT-INFLATION-FIRST-STRATEGY, THREE YEARS OF RISING<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT, DEPRESSED DOMESTIC ACTIVITY, LOW PROFITABILITY<br />
AND STUBBORNLY HIGH INFLATION. AND WE HAD YET TO EXPERIENCE<br />
THE MOST SEVERE DOWNTURN IN EMPLOYMENT SINCE THE DEPRESSION<br />
OF THE 19301S. UNFORTUNATELY, THOSE 3 YEARS BECAME 7 1/ 2<br />
YEARS OF A FAILED STRATEGY. A U J,<br />
W </p>
<p>SINCE THIS GOVERNMENT CAME TO OFFICE IN MARCH 1983, WE HAVE<br />
CONSISTENTLY APPLIED AN ARTICULATED ECONOMIC STRATEGY WHICH<br />
HAS LIFTED THE ECONOMY OUT OF RECESSION AND ON TO A STABLE<br />
LONG-TERM GROWTH PATH.<br />
IT WAS AND IS A STRATEGY RADICALLY DIFFERENT FROM<br />
POLICIES PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED, WHICH RELIED ON FIGHTING<br />
INFLATION THROUGH CONTRACTIONARY MONETARY AND FISCAL<br />
POLICIES. THOSE POLICIES REAPED AN INEVITABLY HEAVY TOLL IN<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT AND HUMAN MISERY A TOLL NO AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT COULD EVER TOLERATE WITH EQUANIMITY.<br />
OURS IS A STRATEGY UNDERPINNED BY THE PRICES AND INCOMES<br />
ACCORD BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT.<br />
IT IS, A-STRATEGY WHICH IS BASED ON CONSULTATION AND<br />
CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE MAJOR GROUPS WITHIN THE ECONOMY.<br />
IT IS A STRATEGY SOUNDLY BASED ON RESPONSIBLE MONETARY AND<br />
FISCAL POLICY, BUT WHICH IMPROVES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE<br />
CONVENTIONAL POLICY INSTRUMENTS BY ACHIEVING A SUBSTANTIAL<br />
DEGREE OF INCOME AND INFLATION RESTRAINT UNDER THE ACCORD.<br />
IT IS MOREOVER, A POLICY WHICH RECOGNISES THE NEED TO<br />
INSTITUTE MANAGED STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN AUSTRALIA'S<br />
INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURE CHANGE DESIGNED TO EQUIP AUSTRALIA TO<br />
COMPETE IN THE HARSH INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY OF THE LATE<br />
1980' S AND BEYOND.<br />
AND IT IS A STRATEGY WHICH HAS CLEARLY WORKED.<br />
ITS SUCCESS CAN BE SEEN IN THE DRAMATIC FALL IN THE REAL<br />
UNIT COSTS OF EMPLOYING LABOUR, WHICH HAS OCCURRED OVER THE<br />
PAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS, AND IN THE CORRESPONDING SHARP<br />
INCREASES IN THE LEVELS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, EMPLOYMENT AND<br />
BUSINESS PROFITS.<br />
BUT DESPITE THE SUCCESS OF THAT STRATEGY IN TERMS OF MOST<br />
ECONOMIC INDICATORS AND AUSTRALIA'S RELATIVE ECONOMIC<br />
PERFORMANCE, IT HAS TO BE CONCEDED THE MARKETS, AND<br />
PARTICULARLY THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS HAVE HAVE NOT<br />
ALWAYS SHARED THAT JUDGEMENT UNREASONABLY IN THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S VIEW.<br />
I SHOULD PERHAPS MAKE SOME REFERENCE HERE TO DEVELOPMENTS IN<br />
THE MONEY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS DURING THE PAST WEEK<br />
IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THAT YOU WILL BE EXPECTING ME<br />
TO SAY SOMETHING.<br />
PAUL KEATING AND I HAVE, OF COURSE, CONSULTED ON THESE<br />
DEVELOPMENTS. WE HAD EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS YESTERDAY ON THE<br />
TREASURER'S RETURN FROM OVERSEAS WHEN, INTER ALIA, WE<br />
REVIEWED THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S OVERALL<br />
ECONOMIC STRATEGY. LET ME MAKE CLEAR THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
ATTITUDE AND RESPONSE TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS.<br />
FIRST, THIS GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT GETTING THE FUNDAMENTALS<br />
RIGHT. IN THE END THAT IS WHAT WILL DETERMINE OUR ABILITY </p>
<p>TO PROSPER IN A COMPETITIVE WORLD. WE REMAIN OF THE VIEW<br />
THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S BROAD ECONOMIC STRATEGY WHICH IS NOW<br />
IN PLACE IS GEARED TO GETTING THE FUNDAMENTALS RIGHT AND TO<br />
KEEPING THE ECONOMY GROWING AT A RATE WHICH IS BOTH<br />
SUSTAINABLE AND CONDUCIVE TO FURTHER LOWERING THE RATE OF<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT IN THIS COUNTRY.<br />
SECONDLY, THE AUSTRALIAN EXCHANGE RATE IS FLOATING. THE<br />
COMMON EXPERIENCE IS THAT FLOATING RATES ARE VOLATILE.<br />
EVEN THE ECONOMIC STATISTICS WHICH DEALERS WATCH MOST<br />
CLOSELY ARE VOLATILE.<br />
EXCHANGE MARKETS REACT TO VIEWS ON A DAILY BASIS. REACTIONS<br />
IN THE REAL ECONOMY HOWEVER FOR EXAMPLE Ib~ IMPORTS,<br />
EXPORTS, PROFITS, ACTIVITY, EMPLOYMENT, INFLATION AND SO ON<br />
REQUIRE MUCH MORE TIME TO COME THROUGH.<br />
WE HAD ALWPYS EXPECTED AND HAVE CONSISTENTLY PREDICTED<br />
THAT SOME OF THE ECONOMIC INDICATORS SUCH AS THE CURRENT<br />
ACCOUNT DEFICIT OR THE CPI WOULD CERTAINLY APPEAR TO GET<br />
WORSE BEFORE THE SOUGHT AFTER IMPROVEMENTS ARE ACHIEVED.<br />
AND THAT, INDEED, IS HOW EVENTS HAVE UNFOLDED.<br />
THE RESERVE BANK WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN MARKETS IN A<br />
WAY TO HELP IRON OUT THE INEVITABLE FLUCTUATIONS. BUT THE<br />
IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT GOVERNMENTS CANNOT REASSESS THEIR<br />
BROAD POLICY STANCE ON A DAILY OR. WEEKLY BASIS IN THE LIGHT<br />
OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES.<br />
RATHER, THE GOVERNMENT MUST HAVE REGARD TO THE INTERESTS OF<br />
ALL AUSTRALIANS OVER THE SHORT AND MEDIUM TERM. IT<br />
THEREFORE ADOPTS A QUITE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE FROM THE<br />
OFTEN NARROW AND SHORT TERM PERSPECTIVE OF MANY PARTICIPANTS<br />
IN MONEY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS.<br />
THIRDLY, ALL THAT HAVING BEEN SAID, IT REMAINS TRUE THAT THE<br />
EXCHANGE RATE IS AN INDICATOR WHICH HAS TO BE GIVEN DUE<br />
WEIGHT IN THE SETTING OF MONETARY POLICY. AND, AS WAS THE<br />
CASE EARLIER IN THE YEAR, THE SHARP DECLINE IN THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR DURING THE PAST WEEK HAS RESULTED IN A<br />
FURTHER FIRMING IN FINANCIAL CONTITIONS AND MONETARY POLICY,<br />
WITH MOST INTEREST RATES RISING 2 1 PERCENTAGE POINT.<br />
WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HIGHER INTEREST RATES HAVE TO BE<br />
LIVED WITH FOR A TIME.<br />
AGAINST THAT BACKGROUND I WISH, TONIGHT, TO DISCUSS BRIEFLY<br />
SOME OF THE ONGER TERM PROCESSES OF ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT<br />
WHICH WE HAVE SET IN TRAIN.<br />
THE SEPTEMBER QUARTER CPI ILLUSTRATES A CASE IN POINT. THE<br />
OUTCOME, AT 2.2 PER CENT, WAS CERTAINLY FAR REMOVED FROM THE<br />
ALARMIST FORECASTS OF SOME OF THE PESSIMISTS OF A FEW MONTHS<br />
AGO. BUT, EVEN SO, THAT RESULT HAS NOTCHED THE ANNUAL RATE<br />
OF INFLATION UP TO 7.6 PER CENT, A RATE WHICH IS OFTEN<br />
COMPARED UNFAVOURABLY WITH THAT OF OUR TRADING PARTNERS.<br />
IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP THAT UNDENIABLE FACT IN SOME </p>
<p>PERSPECTIVE. THE MAJOR FACTOR IN THE APPARENT ACCELERATION<br />
OF INFLATION OVER THE PAST THREE QUARTERS HAS BEEN THE<br />
IMPACT OF THE DEPRECIATION OF EARLIER THIS YEAR ON THE<br />
PRICES OF TRADED GOODS.<br />
IT SHOULD HARDLY COME AS ANY SURPRISE THAT SUCH PRICE<br />
INCREASES HAVE OCCURRED. AFTER ALL, AS I HAVE FREQUENTLY<br />
SAID PREVIOUSLY, IF THE DOMESTIC PRICES OF IMPORTS AND<br />
EXPORTABLE COMMODITIES DO NOT INCREASE, THERE IS NO<br />
MECHANISM BY WHICH DEPRECIATIONWCAN RESULT IN HIGHER<br />
PRODUCTION DOMESTICALLY AND A GREATER MARKET SHARE AT HOME<br />
AND ABROAD FOR THESE GOODS. THERE WOULD BE NO MECHANISM FOR<br />
ACHIEVING THE NECESSARY IMPROVEMENT IN OUR COMPETITIVENESS<br />
AND THE CONSEQUENT REDUCTION IN THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT.<br />
THE TASK WHICH ECONOMIC POLICY AND ESPECIALLY THE ACCORD<br />
IS ADDRESSING IS TO ENSURE THAT THAT NECESSARY INCREASE IN<br />
PRICES DOES NOT BECOME BUILT INTO OUR UNDERLYING COST<br />
STRUCTURE, AND THUS SUBSTANTIALLY ERODE OUR COMPETITIVE<br />
GAINS. THE NEW ACCORD PROVIDES SUBSTANTIAL MECHANISMS TO<br />
CONTAIN THOSE DESTRUCTIVE PRESSURES. AND THE ACCORD IS<br />
SUPPORTED BY MONETARY POLICY.<br />
MONETARY POLICY WAS FIRMED EARLIER THIS YEAR AT A TIME WHEN<br />
THE EXCHANGE RATE WAS OVERLY WEAK AND HAS BEEN KEPT FIRM<br />
EVER SINCE. AS A CONSEQUENCE AUSTRALIA HAS EXPERIENCED A<br />
PROLONGED PERIOD IN WHICH BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM<br />
NOMINAL AND REAL INTEREST RATES HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDED<br />
THOSE, OF SAY, THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED KINGDOM, JAPAN<br />
AND GERMANY.<br />
OF COURSE, MONETARY POLICY IS NOT GUIDED SOLELY BY THE<br />
EXCHANGE RATE. AS THE TREASURER AND GOVERNOR OF THE RESERVE<br />
BANK HAVE SET OUT ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, THE CONDUCT OF<br />
MONETARY POLICY HAS BEEN GUIDED BY REFERENCE TO THE COMPLETE<br />
RANGE OF FINANCIAL INDICATORS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS.<br />
IT IS OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE<br />
ECONOMY THAT HAS LED TO THE MAINTENANCE OF VERY FIRM<br />
MONETARY POLICY THROUGHOUT 1985. THAT WILL CONTINUE SO LONG<br />
AS IT IS APPROPRIATE.<br />
THOUGH INTEREST RATES HAVE INCREASED IN SEVERAL STAGES SINCE<br />
EARLY THIS YEAR, IN AUSTRALIA, IT IS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THE<br />
FIRST SIGNS HAVE BEGUN TO EMERGE THAT THE DEMAND FOR CREDIT<br />
MAY HAVE BEGUN TO SLOW. THOSE SIGNS ARE AS YET TENTATIVE<br />
AND SUCH SLOWING AS IS EXPECTED IS, OF COURSE, A FACTOR<br />
UNDERLYING THE SLOWING IN DOMESTIC DEMAND WHICH WE FORECAST<br />
DURING THIS FINANCIAL YEAR.<br />
THAT UNAVOIDABLE LAG HAS GREATLY COMPLICATED THE TASK OF<br />
INTERPRETING THE STANCE OF MONETARY POLICY ESPECIALLY FOR<br />
THOSE NOT CLOSE TO THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL SCENE.<br />
AND THAT TASK HAS BEEN FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE EFFECTS OF<br />
THE SUBSTANTIAL DEREGULATION WHICH THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM HAS<br />
UNDERGONE. AUSTRALIA'S EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA IS AKIN TO<br />
THAT OF A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, </p>
<p>THE UNITED KINGDOM AND CANADA.<br />
BUT LET NO ONE BE FOOLED BY THESE COMPLICATIONS.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED TO PURSUE THE MONETARY POLICY<br />
REQUIRED TO KEEP THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY MOVING ON THE PATH<br />
OF LONG TERM GROWTH. WE RECOGNISE THAT AN ESCALATION OF<br />
INFLATION OVER AND ABOVE THAT REQUIRED TEMPORARILY TO PERMIT<br />
DEPRECIATION TO BECOME EFFECTIVE WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO<br />
AUSTRALIA REMAINING ON THAT PATH AND MONETARY POLICY<br />
REFLECTS THAT RECOGNITION.<br />
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE WELL PROVEN MECHANISMS OF THE<br />
ACCORD, POLICY IS THUS SET TO PRODUCE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS<br />
WHICH WILL PERMIT THE LARGEST FEASIBLE IMPROVEMENT IN OUR<br />
COMPETITIVENESS WHICH CAN BE OBTAINED.<br />
IN TIME, THAT IMPROVEMENT IN OUR COMPETITIVENESS WILL BEGIN<br />
TO REDUCE THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT AS A PROPORTION OF<br />
GDP. DOMESTIC PRODUCTION WILL ALSO BEGIN TO GROW AT A<br />
SOMEWHAT FASTER PACE THAN DOMESTIC DEMAND, PROVIDING A<br />
SOURCE OF CONTINUED ECONOMIC EXPANSION EVEN AS THE GROWTH OF<br />
DOMESTIC DEMAND RECEDES FROM THE STRONG PACE OF 1985.<br />
IN THAT CONTEXT THE SLOWING OF DOMESTIC DEMAND COULD OF<br />
ITSELF BE EXPECTED TO REDUCE THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT<br />
ACCOUNT DEFICIT TO GDP. THE LAGGED IMPROVEMENT IN THE<br />
MARKET SHARE OF AUSTRALIA PRODUCERS WILL ALSO TEND TO REDUCE<br />
THAT RATIO.<br />
BUT AS THE BUDGET PAPERS AND STATEMENTS BY THE TREASURER AND<br />
MYSELF HAVE INDICATED, THE REDUCTION IN THE CURRENT ACCOUNT<br />
WILL COME THROUGH IN THE LATTER PART OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR.<br />
NOBODY, THEREFORE, SHOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED TO SEE ONLY<br />
SLOW PROGRESS IN OBTAINING SOME IMPROVEMENT IN THE CURRENT<br />
ACCOUNT OVER THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE ADJUSTMENT CYCLE. THE<br />
GOVERNMENT HAD TAKEN MARKETS INTO OUR CONFIDENCE WELL IN<br />
ADVANCE. THE CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT COULD AMOUNT TO ABOUT 5 PER CENT<br />
OF GDP IN THE RECENTLY COMPLETED SEPTEMBER QUARTER, A RESULT<br />
WHICH WAS INFLATED BY BOTH THE CELEBRATED J-CURVE EFFECT ON<br />
NOMINAL VALUES AND THE SEASONAL PATTERN OF TRADE<br />
TRANSACTIONS. THERE IS EXPECTED TO BE A MARKED DECLINE IN<br />
THAT PROPORTION PERHAPS AS MUCH AS 1 PERCENTAGE POINT<br />
OVER THE COURSE OF 1985-86. IF EVEN THE GAINS IN<br />
COMPETITIVENESS OBTAINED IN THE FIRST HALF OF 1985 CAN BE<br />
SUSTAINED AND IT IS THE CLEAR INTENTION OF POLICY THAT<br />
THEY SHOULD BE THERE IS EVERY PROSPECT OF A SIGNIFICANT<br />
FURTHER REDUCTION IN LATER QUARTERS.<br />
CURRENT ACCOUNT ADJUSTMENT WILL, WITH A FURTHER DELAY,<br />
RESULT IN AN EASING IN OUR INDEBTEDNESS TO FOREIGNERS, AS A<br />
SHARE OF GDP.<br />
AUSTRALIA'S DEBT OVERSEAS HAS RISEN SHARPLY IN RECENT YEARS.<br />
THIS REFLECTS MAINLY THE CURRENT ACCOUNT IMBALANCES WHICH<br />
WERE THE BY-PRODUCT OF OUR EARLIER LACK OF COMPETITIVENESS, </p>
<p>AND THE DETERIORATION IN THE TERMS ON WHICH OUR COMMODITY<br />
EXPORTS EXCHANGE FOR IMPORTS ON WORLD MARKETS.<br />
MOST RECENTLY, HOWEVER, DEPRECIATION HAS ITSELF ADDED<br />
SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE $ A VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN OBLIGATIONS, IN<br />
AN ADJUSTMENT WHICH IS ANALOGOUS TO THE 3-CURVE ON THE TRADE<br />
ACCOUNT. ONCE MORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO PLACE THIS DEVELOPMENT IN SOME<br />
PERSPECTIVE. AUSTRALIA HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN A NET<br />
BORROWER ABROAD. ACCESS TO FOREIGN CAPITAL ( AND THE<br />
ASSOCIATED EXPERTISE) HAS ENABLED AN EXPANSION OF NATIONAL<br />
WEALTH WHICH COULD NOT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN GENERATED USING<br />
ONLY OUR OWN FINANCIAL RESOURCES.<br />
THE REAL QUESTION THUS IS WHETHER OUR DEBT BURDEN IS<br />
SUSTAINABLE. RECENT WORK BY THE OFFICE OF EPAC INDICATES<br />
CLEARLY THAT, CONTRARY TO SOME CLAIMS, WHEN THE STATISTICS<br />
ARE ADJUSTED TO PLACE THEM ON A COMPARABLE BASIS, AUSTRALIA<br />
IS NOT IN ANY SENSE ONE OF THE mPROBLEM" DEBTORS.<br />
DEPRECIATION -AND OUR POLICY RESPONSE, BASED PARTICULARLY<br />
ON THE ACCORD -PROVIDES A BASIS FOR ENSURING THAT<br />
AUSTRALIA'S OBLIGATIONS ABROAD CAN BE SERVICED WITHOUT<br />
EITHER MASSIVE DISRUPTION TO THE ECONOMY OR INTOLERABLE<br />
FUTURE STRAIN ON THE EXCHANGE RATE. WITHOUT-THE ACCORD THAT<br />
ADJUSTMENT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AFTER A SHARP<br />
CONTRACTION OF THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY WHICH WOULD BE COSTLY IN<br />
BOTH ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL TERMS.<br />
BUT OUR STRATEGY FOR SUSTAINED ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, IS FAR<br />
BROADER THAN I HAVE TIME TO DETAIL HERE TONIGHT.<br />
IT INCLUDES A FISCAL POLICY WHICH RECOGNISES THE NEED TO<br />
CURB THE GROWTH OF PUBLIC SECTOR EXPENDITURE AS THE ENGINE<br />
OF PRIVATE SECTOR GROWTH BEGINS-TO FIRE ON ALL CYLINDERS.<br />
IN JUST THREE BUDGETS WE HAVE MORE THAN HALVED OUR INHERITED<br />
BUDGET DEFICIT AS A PROPORTION OF GDP AND REDUCED THE TOTAL<br />
PUBLIC SECTOR BORROWING REQUIREMENT BY 2.7 PER CENT OF GDP.<br />
IT INCLUDES TRADE POLICIES WHICH SEEK TO EXPAND AUSTRALIA'S<br />
OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPORT. IN RECOGNITION OF THE REMARKABLE<br />
GROWTH POTENTIAL OF OUR REGION, THESE IN TURN INCLUDE<br />
STRATEGIES TO IDENTIFY THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF POTENTIAL<br />
EXPORT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY IN THE REGION,<br />
WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON CHINA AND JAPAN, UNDER THE CHINA<br />
ACTION PLAN AND THE JAPANESE MARKET STRATEGY RESPECTIVELY.<br />
IT INCLUDES ALSO INDUSTRY POLICIES WHICH SEEK TO FOSTER<br />
EFFICIENT, FLEXIBLE, INNOVATIVE, FORWARD LOOKING,<br />
EXPORT-ORIENTED ENTERPRISES.<br />
AND IT INCLUDES POLICIES FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING,<br />
PARTICULARLY FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, DESIGNED TO IMPROVE<br />
AUSTRALIA'S SKILLS BASE AND ENHANCE THE LIFE CHANCES OF OUR<br />
YOUNG PEOPLE.<br />
A PARTICULAR FEATURE OF THIS GOVERNMENT IS OUR COMMITMENT TO </p>
<p>REMOVING REGULATORY IMPEDIMENTS TO DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH.<br />
THE FLOATING OF THE THE REMOVAL OF VIRTUALLY ALL<br />
EXCHANGE CONTROLS, AND THE SUBSTANTIAL DEREGULATION OF THE<br />
BANKING SECTOR HAVE BEEN NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENTS IN ENCOURAGING<br />
INNOVATION AND COMPETITION. THEY HAVE ALSO ESTABLISHED OUR<br />
CREDENTIALS IN THIS AREA, IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE EMPTY<br />
DRUMBEATING OF THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT.<br />
ONLY LAST WEEK I ANNOUNCED ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT<br />
SEVERAL INITIATIVES RELATING TO BUSINESS DEREGULATION.<br />
THESE INCLUDED SUBSTANTIAL DEREGULATORY INITIATIVES IN<br />
RESPECT OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT POLICY AND EXPORT CONTROLS ON<br />
SOME MINERALS. IN ADDITION I SPECIFIED OUR PRIORITIES FOR<br />
FURTHER REFORMS, WHICH FOCUS PARTICULARLY IN AREAS WHERE<br />
INCONSISTENT ADMINISTRATION OR INAPPROPRIATE REGULATIONS<br />
HAVE RESULTED IN EXCESSIVE COSTS TO BUSINESS.<br />
MANY OF THESE INITIATIVES WILL REQUIRE THE CO-OPERATION OF<br />
STATE GOVERNMENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IN THIS REGARD SOUTH<br />
AUSTRALIA HAS BEEN TO THE FOREFRONT, FOR EXAMPLE IN THE<br />
AREAS OF STATE PURCHASING PREFERENCES, AND MODEL NATIONAL<br />
FOOD LAWS AND BUILDING CODES.<br />
THE GOVERNM4ENT RECOGNISES THAT INDIVIDUAL SECTORS OF<br />
INDUSTRY HAVE THEIR OWN PARTICULAR NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT, THEREFORE, HAS DEVELOPED A CASE-BY-CASE<br />
APPROACH TO INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT WHICH HAS RESULTED IN A<br />
NUMBER OF INNOVATIVE SECTORAL PLANS BEING IMPLEMENTED.<br />
THESE PLANS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN CLOSE CONSULTATION WITH<br />
EMPLOYERS, EMPLOYEES AND GOVERNMENT. THEY HAVE RECEIVED<br />
SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT FROM THE PARTIES, AND ARE PROVING TO BE<br />
REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL.<br />
HERE IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA TWO MAJOR M4ANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES,<br />
PASSENGER MOTOR VEHICLES AND STEEL, ARE BENEFITING FROM OUR<br />
SECTORAL PLANS. SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE STEEL PLAN,<br />
THE INDUSTRY HAS WITNESSED A DRAMATIC TURNAROUND IN ITS<br />
PROFITABILITY AND INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS, WHILE THE<br />
PASSENGER MOTOR VEHICLE INDUSTRY RECENTLY HAS UNDERGONE A<br />
SUBSTANTIAL BOOM IN SALES.<br />
BOTH PLANS FOR THESE INDUSTRIES ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR<br />
GENERAL APPROACH TO PROMOTE LONG OVERDUE STRUCTURAL CHANGE<br />
AT A PACE WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH ACHIEVING REAL AND<br />
PERMANENT PROGRESS. WE NOT ONLY HAVE A VISION OF WHERE<br />
AUSTRALIA NEEDS TO HEAD TO SECURE ITS FUTURE, WE HAVE A<br />
BROAD STRATEGY WHICH IS CAPABLE OF GETTING US THERE.<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SOUTH AUSTRALIA, WITH ITS STRONG<br />
INDUSTRIAL BASE, IS WELL PLACED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES. I AM PLEASED TO NOTE THAT SOUTH AUSTRALIAN<br />
MANUFACTURERS ARE REPORTING STRONG INVESTMENT EXPECTATIONS<br />
FOR 1985-86, WELL IN EXCESS OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THE<br />
IMPACT OF THE DEVALUATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR EARLIER<br />
THIS YEAR SHOULD ADD ADDITIONAL IMPETUS TO THESE<br />
DEVELOPMENTS.<br />
UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY KNOWS WHERE IT </p>
<p>STANDS. BUSINESS CAN BE CONFIDENT ABOUT OUR MANAGEMENT OF<br />
THE ECONOMY IN THE SHORT TERM. IT CAN ALSO BE CONFIDENT WE<br />
ARE ADDRESSING THE ISSUES VITAL FOR MEDIUM AND LONG TERM<br />
GROWTH. BUSINESS KNOWS WHAT OUR POLICIES ARE AND WHERE<br />
WE'RE GOING. AND IT CAN PLAN FOR THE FUTURE CONFIDENTLY<br />
WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE. I BELIEVE THAT IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT<br />
ACHIEVEMENT. WE CAN ALL BE JUSTLY PROUD THAT THE POLICIES WHICH COMPRISE<br />
THIS COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC STRATEGY ARE CLEARLY WORKING FOR<br />
AUSTRALIA WORKING, NOT LEAST, FOR THE BENEFIT OF FOR SOUTH<br />
AUSTRALIANS. ALONE AMONG THE MAJOR OECD COUNTRIES, AUSTRALIA'S LEVEL OF<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT IS EXPECTED TO FALL THROUGHOUT 1985-86. THAT<br />
WILL ADD TO THE FALL OF WELL OVER 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WHICH HAS BEEN ACHIEVED SO FAR UNDER THE<br />
POLICIES OF THIS GOVERNMENT.<br />
OF COURSE THIS HAS A COUNTERPART IN THE HUGE EXPANSION IN<br />
JOBS WHICH HAS OCCURRED. IT HAS BEEN SO GREAT AN EXPANSION,<br />
THAT WE ARE NOW ON THE VERGE OF ACHIEVING 500,000 NEW JOBS,<br />
IN ADVANCE OF OUR THREE-YEAR TIMETABLE JOBS, I WOULD ADD,<br />
WHICH OVERWHELMINGLY ( 88 PER CENT ON THE LATEST FIGURES)<br />
HAVE BEEN CREATED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.<br />
BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE SUCCESS WHICH HAS ALREADY<br />
BEEN ACHIEVED IS THE CAREFUL PROGRESS WHICH HAS BEEN M4ADE TO<br />
ENSURE AUSTRALIA'S PROSPERITY IN THE LONG TERM.<br />
LIKE THE SUCCESSFUL GRAND PRIX DRIVERS LAST WEEKEND, WE<br />
APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SHORT SIGHTEDNESS OF<br />
THE FLASHY QUICK DASH AND THE WELL PACED, WELL PLANNED<br />
PROFESSIONAL RACE. THE DASH ACHIEVES FLEETING FAME AT THE<br />
EXPENSE OF EXCESSIVE CONSUMPTION OF FUEL AND TYRES OR THE<br />
RISK OF COLLISION. IT STANDS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO A MORE<br />
SUSTAINABLE PACE WHICH RESPECTS SUCH LOGISTICAL AND OTHER<br />
CONSTRAINTS BUT IS CONSISTENT, NONETHELESS, WITH TOP<br />
PERFORMANCE. AND IT IS THAT LATTER DETERMINED, BUT<br />
MEASURED, APPROACH WHICH WE HAVE INSTITUTED FOR AUSTRALIA.<br />
I AM SURE HE WOULD NOT MIND MY SAYING THAT JOHN BANNON'S<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS PLACED SOUTH AUSTRALIA IN A FINE POSITION TO<br />
PARTICIPATE TO THE FULL IN ECONOMIC RECOVERY. AND I WISH TO<br />
ACKNOWLEDGE TONIGHT, THE FINE JOB WHICH HE AND HIS TEAM HAVE<br />
DONE. EMPLOYMENT IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA HAS GROWN 3 PER CENT OVER THE<br />
PAST YEAR, A PACE WHICH HAS BEEN FAST ENOUGH TO PERMIT SOUTH<br />
AUSTRALIA, ALONE AMONG THE STATES, TO STEADILY REDUCE ITS<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TO PRE-RECESSION LEVELS.<br />
MOREOVER THIS STATE'S INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RECORD IS THE<br />
ENVY OF THE NATION. WITH SOME 8.6 PER CENT OF THE NATION'S<br />
WORKFORCE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA ACCOUNTS FOR ONLY 1.7 PER CENT OF<br />
THE DAYS LOST THROUGH STRIKE ACTION.<br />
THOUGH HIS GOVERNMENT, TOO, INHERITED A PARLOUS FINANCIAL </p>
<p>POSITION, JOHN BANNON'S GOVERNMENT HAS PURSUED RESPONSIBLE<br />
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES IN ASSOCIATION WITH<br />
IMAGINATIVE POLICIES TO STIMULATE THE ECONOMY.<br />
IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FORWARD LOOKING THINKING OF JOHN'S<br />
TEAM THAT ADELAIDE IS TO ACQUIRE WHAT I CONFIDENTLY EXPECT<br />
WILL BE AUSTRALIA'S FINEST CASINO, A CONVENTION CENTRE AND<br />
AN INTERNATIONAL HOTEL. VALUED AT $ 180 MILLION, THIS<br />
REDEVELOPMENT OF THE ADELAIDE RAILWAY STATION PRECINCT IS<br />
THE LARGEST SINGLE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IN THE HISTORY OF<br />
THE CITY OF ADELAIDE.<br />
AND IT IS ALSO A CREDIT TO HIS TEAM'S FORWARD LOOKING<br />
APPROACH THAT THEY HAVE INITIATED THE DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
TECHNOLOGY PARK ADELAIDE. I UNDERSTAND THAT MAJOR<br />
INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES SUCH AS BRITISH AEROSPACE ARE COMING<br />
TO THE PARK TO ESTABLISH NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS. TECHNOLOGY<br />
PARK ADELAIDE IS A CLEAR LEADER WITHIN AUSTRALIA AS A<br />
LOCATION FOR HI-TECH DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IN TURN BODES WELL<br />
FOR THE FUTURE PROSPERITY BOTH OF THIS STATE AND AUSTRALIA<br />
AS A WHOLE.<br />
I WAS PLEASED THAT THE BANNON GOVERNMENT TOOK ADVANTAGE OF<br />
MOVES AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL TO DEREGULATE BANKING AND SET<br />
YOUR SIGHTS ON ENSURING THAT A MAJOR OVERSEAS BANK WOULD<br />
ESTABLISH HEADQUARTERS IN ADELAIDE. THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT<br />
STANDARD CHARTERED WOULD RECEIVE A LICENCE AND SET UP ITS<br />
OPERATIONS IN THE STATE WAS A CULMINATION OF THESE EFFORTS.<br />
BUT JOHN BANNON'S GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ONLY DELIVERED ECONOMIC<br />
SUCCESS. IT HAS NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENTS IN WELFARE SERVICES,<br />
THE ARTS, EDUCATION, LAW AND JUSTICE. THESE ARE<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS WHICH PLACE THIS BANNON GOVERNMENT IN THE VERY<br />
BEST TRADITION OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY.<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BOTH FEDERALLY AND IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br />
WE IN THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY ARE WORKING TO CREATE A<br />
BETTER, MORE CARING, MORE TOLERANT, MORE DIVERSE AND MORE<br />
REALISTIC AUSTRALIA. IT IS A MORE COHESIVE, WEALTHIER AND<br />
ENRICHED AUSTRALIA AN AUSTRALIA IN WHICH YOUR STATE<br />
GOVERNMENT, LED BY JOHN BANNON, HAS PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE<br />
A STATE GOVERNMENT IN WHICH YOU CAN JUSTLY BE PROUD.<br />
