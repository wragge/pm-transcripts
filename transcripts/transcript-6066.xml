PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA<br />
2 8MAR 1983<br />
Dear Mr Premier<br />
We are most disappointed at your decision to reject our<br />
request for discussion and negotiations on the matter<br />
of the Gordon below Franklin Dam, as expressed in your<br />
telex received on March 22, 1983.<br />
We are well aware of the election results at both a<br />
State and Federal level within the State of Tasmania.<br />
We are equally conscious of the result Australia-wide<br />
and that we gave an unequivocal commitment on this issue,<br />
which has been well and truly endorsed by the Australian<br />
people. We do not accept the view that Tasmania is separate from<br />
the rest of the country, nor do we accept the view that<br />
what occurs in Tasmania is purely the business of<br />
Tasmanians. we have made it clear that we have the utmost respect<br />
for State Governments and their rights.<br />
The question of the Gordon below Franklin is one that<br />
extends well beyond State boundaries, and indeed<br />
national boundaries.<br />
It has been recognised by the World Heritage Commission<br />
as an area of international importance, one that should<br />
be preserved for future benefit.<br />
It is not a question of I, or my Ministers, being ignorant<br />
of your arguments, nor of viewing the area in order to<br />
understand Tasmania's power requirements, the need for<br />
alternative employment and the State's energy options.<br />
As a matter of information, if you are not already aware,<br />
many of my Ministers have visited the area when in<br />
Opposition. During the course of negotiations over the settlement of<br />
this issue I will naturally be visiting Tasmania and<br />
will be pleased to take up the offer to view the area we<br />
are committed to preserving for the future. / 2 </p>
<p>Wie repeat our position that we are commnitted to ensuring<br />
alternative schemes, including hydro, are found to<br />
guarantee the energy needs of Tasmania in the future,<br />
allowing for the growth rates that you refer to and your<br />
expected industrial expansion.<br />
We repeat our unequivocal commitment to assisting in the<br />
transfer of employment from that site to other projects,<br />
and further repeat our assurance of presenting to you in<br />
negotiations, an economic package aimed at a transition<br />
period and at facilitating future development in<br />
Tasmania and a consequent reduction in unemployment levels.<br />
Our commitment to reducing unemployment levels and<br />
creating job opportunities was made clear during the<br />
election campaign and has been repeated since. The whole<br />
endeavour of my Government will be towards this objective.<br />
The people of Tasmania will benefit from those general<br />
policies and our explicit package aimed at compensating<br />
for the cessation of the development of the Gordon below<br />
Franklin.<br />
We are prepared to enter into serious negotiations in order<br />
to resolve the issue and to eliminate the bitter divisions<br />
it has created within Tasmania.<br />
in our view the people of Tasmania want:-<br />
* guaranteed energy supplies to cover both<br />
the present and future needs;<br />
equivalent employment opportunities; gnd<br />
* the resolution of this conflict.<br />
These legitimate objectives can only be attained by<br />
discussion and negotiation.<br />
We call upon your Government as an act of good faith to<br />
declare a moratorium on the current works on the Gordon<br />
below Frank-lin and to commence discussions with my<br />
Government on alternative power and employment initiatives.<br />
During the period of the moratorium and discussions we<br />
will guarantee the income of those directly affected through<br />
the course of their transfer to other employment such<br />
employment to be determined during the discussions.<br />
We believe our approach is more than reasonable. We<br />
believe we are offering to yourself, your Government and the<br />
people of Tasmania the possibility of healing divisions,<br />
of guaranteeing the energy supplies required and of helping<br />
to alleviate the unemployment levels of your State. / 3 </p>
<p>We would appreciate your response by Wednesday next,<br />
March.<br />
Yours sincerely Hawke)<br />
The Hon. Robin Gray, MHA<br />
Premier of Tasmania<br />
Parliament House<br />
HOBART TAS 7000 </p>
