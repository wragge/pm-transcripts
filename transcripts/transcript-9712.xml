PRIME MINISTER 85/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
MR GREINER AND " GUTLESS" POLITICS<br />
According to an AAP report, the former Liberal Premier of NSW, Nick<br />
Greiner, has accused the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, of<br />
adopting a " gutless approach" to political leadership.<br />
Mr Greiner is reported to have said that John Howard had adopted " totally<br />
risk-averse" politics, and that this style of political expediency " is having and<br />
will continue to have a deleterious effect on the way this country develops."<br />
Here we have, -from within the Liberal Party Itself, an astute and damning<br />
assessment of John Howard's political leadership.<br />
As Mr Greiner has confirmed, John Howard will try dishonestly to skate under<br />
the electoral wire, revealing as few of his policies as possible.<br />
Mr Greiner said It was good politics, but bad for the nation.<br />
I say it is bad for the nation, an bad politics.<br />
