Stewart, was previously required to finalise its inquiry and4<br />
report by 28 February 1983.<br />
The Commonwealth has:. been diecussing with the States concerned<br />
possible terms of reference for an extension of the.<br />
Royal Commission to undertake an inquiry into Nugan Hand. It<br />
has recently been suggested by Sir Edward Williams, Chairmandesignate<br />
of the National Crimes Commission, that the Crimes<br />
Commission might undertake the Nugan Hand inquiry.<br />
The handling of the Nugan Hand inquiry is a matter for the<br />
incoming Commonwealth Government to settle with the States<br />
concerned. Meanwhile, it has been agreed to extend the terms<br />
of Mr Justice Stewart's Commission.<br />
Although Mr Justice Stewart also holds. a Commission from<br />
Victoria, the Victorian Government does not propose to extend<br />
it beyond 28 February 1983. Queensland does not intend to<br />
parztipate in any Nugan Hand reference to the Royal Commission.<br />
