PRIME MIMISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO 480<br />
3 April 1975<br />
RETURN OF VIETNAMESE AND CAMBODIAN STUDENTS<br />
The Prime Minister and Acting Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs, Mr Whitlam. said today that students from Vietnam<br />
and Cambodia studying in Australia would be allowed to<br />
defer their return home.<br />
Sponsored overseas students are normally required to<br />
return to their homelands when they have completed their<br />
studies in Australia, but they have in the past been<br />
permitted to remain temporarily, for additional studi~ s<br />
when circumstances in their own countries would make it<br />
dangerous to return.<br />
Mr Whitlam. added that he hoped that students from<br />
Vietnam and Cambodia would be able to go back to their<br />
homelands and make their contribution to the reconstruction<br />
of their countries when peace is restored.<br />
At the present time, there are 445 Vietnamese students<br />
in Australia, including approximately 75 private students.<br />
There are 75 students from Cambodia, including 18 private<br />
students. They are in Australian schools, colleges and<br />
universities or undertaking special courses of study or<br />
training.<br />
