<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced today that the Australian Government will increase support for health and hospitals in Papua New Guinea to help save lives.</p>
<p>Support for improved health in Papua New Guinea is a key agreed priority under the Australia-Papua New Guinea Partnership for Development.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will provide just over $160 million over four years to 2016.</p>
<p>This additional funding will ensure continued availability of quality assured medical supplies for 2,700 health facilities across Papua New Guinea. It will build on Australiaâs existing support for pharmaceuticals procurement and distribution.</p>
<p>Australian funding will also support the rehabilitation of rural and remote health facilities in Western Highlands, Eastern Highlands, Milne Bay, Western Province and Bougainville, which have some of the poorest health indicators in the country.</p>
<p>Funding will also be directed toward refurbishing and expanding training schools and colleges for nurses, midwives and other health workers.</p>
<p>The quality and amount of health infrastructure throughout Papua New Guinea is inadequate for Papua New Guineaâs fast-growing population. The additional funding will help improve the quality of primary health services.</p>
<p>Australiaâs support would also improve the retention of health workers which is currently a significant problem. </p>
