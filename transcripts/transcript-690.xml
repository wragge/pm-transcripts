RECEPTION AT PARLIAMEN HOUSECANBERRA, IN HONOUR<br />
OF HER MJSYTE UEEN OTT 18TH FEUA11Y,<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister,, te Rt. Hon. Jes<br />
Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness<br />
It's my very great privilege as Prime Minister<br />
your Prime Minister, Malam of Australia to offer you and<br />
His Royal Highness a very, very warm welcome once more to this<br />
country. I know that we had a little arrangement that speeches<br />
should be reduced to the minimum,. a matter of , ihich T think I<br />
might safely say Your Majesty warmly approved, but you can't<br />
expect, really, in this place of Parliament which is the house<br />
of speeches, and with myself and then the Deputy Prime Minister<br />
and then the Leader of your Opposition in this country, to let<br />
the occasion pass without saying something. But I assure you,<br />
Ma'am, we will reduce it to a minimum.<br />
The first thing that I want to say is to remind everybody<br />
of something you said when you were here last, when you<br />
referred to the fact that in the constitutional structure of<br />
Australia Parliamentary, executive, judicial you are there.<br />
You are, indeed the Head of this House. " Be it enacted by<br />
the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty" and, therefore Matam,<br />
you are among your friends, and in one sense, among your<br />
collea gues. We, of course, are also delighted to see His Royal<br />
Highness, Prince Phailip, who has been here a few times not<br />
enough but a few times and who has a standing among us<br />
which I don't need to describe because he has been conscious<br />
of it so many ' times.<br />
Ma'tam, there are a lot of interesting people in the<br />
wo. Jid vho 3-lke to discuss the Monarchy. There arc clever people<br />
in the world at least so I understand who have discovered<br />
that all sorts of things ought -to be done to the Monarcny to<br />
democratize the Monarchy, to do something to it, to do something<br />
to what we all are proud to say is the most democratic Monarchy<br />
in the whole wide world. ( Applause) We pay no attention to<br />
that; whon we see you, we see you as our Queen, we see you as our<br />
Sovereign Lady, we see you as -th successor of monarchs who, in<br />
this very century, have by their own conduct and their own<br />
standards and their ownm genius, helped t o preserve our Monarchy<br />
in a viorld in which crowms have been tumbling and disasters have<br />
beset mankind. And we are proud to think that so far from<br />
abrogating any of our liberty because we are your subjects we<br />
know that we add to our liberty because we are your subjects as<br />
are scores and scores of millions of people around the world,<br />
and out of all our joint allegiance to you comes an addition to<br />
our freedom, not a subtraction from it.<br />
Your Majesty, it is a proud thought for us to have you<br />
here, to remiind ourselves that in thiis great structure of<br />
Government which as evolved and of which this Parliament is one<br />
of the fruits, you if I may Use the expression are the<br />
living and lovely centre of our enduring allegiance. ( Applause)<br />
Ma'am, I say one thing more and one thing only. You<br />
today begin your journey around Australia. It is a journey you<br />
have made before. You will be seen in the next few~ eeks by ./ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
hundreds and thousands and, I hope, by millions of your<br />
Australian subjects. Mothers will hold their children up<br />
to look at you as you go by, and they themselves, and their<br />
husbands will have a look at you as you go by. This must<br />
be to you now something that is almost a task. All I ask<br />
you to remember, in this country of yours, is that every man,<br />
woman and child who even sees you with a passing glimpse as<br />
you go by, will remember it remember it with joy, remember<br />
it in the words of the old seventeenth-century poet who wrote<br />
those famous words " I did but see her passing by<br />
And yet I love her till I die" </p>
