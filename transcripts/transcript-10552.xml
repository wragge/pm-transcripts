FOR MEDIA 21 February 1985<br />
JOINT'STATEMENT BY PRIME MINISTER AND PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the New South Walee-Premier.<br />
Mr Wran, today welcomed the call by the Federal Executive of the<br />
Australian Medical Association for doctors in New South Wales<br />
public hospitals to resume normal duties.<br />
The call came following the agreement reached in negotiations<br />
involving the Prime Minister, the Federal Health Minister,<br />
Dr Blewett, and New South Wales Deputy Premier and Minister for<br />
Health, Mr Mulock in Canberra today.<br />
The Prime Minister and Premier said the agreement formed the<br />
basis for settlement of the long-running dispute.<br />
" We urge NSW surgeons to respond positively to the responsi! K! e<br />
and reasonable recommendation made by Mr Thompson,' they said.<br />
" We have always believed that the gcod sense of the majority of<br />
the profession would prevail over the political objectives of<br />
extremist groups."<br />
" The AMA's statement today reflects the belief of most doctors<br />
that the well-being of their patients is of paramount<br />
importance." " Following this call for a return to work we are confident that<br />
immediate negotiations between both Governments and the AM4A can<br />
address the legitimate concerns of the profession."<br />
' Through these negotiations the previous high standard of<br />
patient care can be restored in New South Wales public<br />
hospitals. We are determined that every Aust%_-ralian' s right of<br />
health cover through the fair and universal Medicare program<br />
will be maintained."<br />
As a result of discussions today w. ith the AMA the following<br />
agreement has been reached between the parties:<br />
The AMA accepts the Prime Minister's and Premier ' s offer of<br />
23 Janaury ( as amended by not insisting on withdrawal of<br />
resignations); </p>
<p>2.<br />
The AMA agrees to an extensive advertising and<br />
communication program calling upon doctors to resitme<br />
normal duties;<br />
The Governments agree to begin negotiations with the AMA<br />
next Tuesday with a preliminary meeting between officers<br />
on Saturday to determine procedures and timetable;<br />
The Governments agree to defer the advertising cf specific<br />
vacancies pending an assessment to be made next week of the<br />
extent to which doctors make themselves available for<br />
normal duties; if there are gaps remaining in the<br />
provision of medical services in public hospitals then<br />
specific positions will be advertised. </p>
