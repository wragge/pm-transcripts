PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 9 DECEMBER, 1978<br />
MRS. GOLDA MEIR<br />
Mrs. Golda Meir was one of the outstanding women of<br />
the world.<br />
She dedicated her life to the service of her country and to<br />
the long search for a secure future for the state of Israel.<br />
From the time of her arrival in the British mandated territory<br />
of Palestine, the main aim of her lifewas the creation and<br />
later the consolidation of Israel.<br />
As Minister for Labor, for Foreign Affairs and finally as<br />
Prime Minister, she served her country with dedication and<br />
with indomitable courage.<br />
She gained the admiration of her countrymen, and of people<br />
everywhere for her tenacity and her devotion to Israel.<br />
In Australia we share the sorrow of Israelis at her passing.<br />
