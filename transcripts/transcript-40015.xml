    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government will purchase 1100 locally built Hawkei protected vehicles and over 1000 trailers to strengthen our defence force.</p>
<p>Under a $1.3 billion agreement, the vehicles will be manufactured at Thales Australia's production line in Bendigo, creating 170 jobs there and another 60 jobs in Victoria.</p>
<p>The Hawkei will improve protection for soldiers and enable them to operate in high-risk areas. It is the only protected mobility vehicle in the ADF that can be transported by ADF helicopters.</p>
<p>The vehicles will also pioneer a next generation communications management system to be developed in Australia by Thales.</p>
<p>The Government will invest in the skills and knowledge base of the Defence industry. This long-term investment helps secure this important industry's future in Australia.</p>
<p>The Government is committed to working closely with Australian industry to bring about a safer and more secure Australia.</p>
<p>The Project LAND 121 Phase 4 contract to deliver the vehicles was signed today at Defence's Monegeetta Proving Ground near Melbourne.</p>
<p>Since 2004, the Thales assembly line has been producing the highly successful Bushmaster, widely recognised as one of the finest vehicles of its type in the world.</p>
<p>As Bushmaster production winds down, the start of pilot vehicle production in early 2016 will secure the highly skilled Bendigo workforce for full-rate production of the Hawkei in 2018.</p>
