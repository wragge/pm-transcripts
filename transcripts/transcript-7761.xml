PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFRICZ, ANDRZW KRR FRAIL AGED HOMi,<br />
39 SPITEBn 1989<br />
1 O PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: IMr Hawke, interest rates, with your deal with<br />
the five major banks the smaller banks are crying foul?<br />
PRIM NVI ST: Are they?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes<br />
PRIME NIZXSTER: Well, I don't see that there's any case for<br />
that. We have got a position where, in regard to those who<br />
have got the equivalent of the BD's, a position has<br />
developed where the disability that was involved when we<br />
made the arrangement to run those down has meant that they<br />
have incurred a larger disability because of the rise in the<br />
market rates and vhat has been done is simply to restore<br />
that differential that existed before aad in that situation<br />
a ceiling has been placed on mortgage rates. That will<br />
obviously be for the benefit of the coummnity as a whole.<br />
JOURNALIST: The building societies are saying though that<br />
they can't keep it at 17 per cent, they'll have to rise to<br />
18 per cent.<br />
PRIE NMINISTR: Well they haven't got the same situation as<br />
the banks have in regard to a disability in regard to those<br />
deposited funds so, they're not in the same situation.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawks, when is the next election? Is this<br />
supposed to be a prelude to the next election?<br />
PRIME NINISTER: No, you see the problem with this is it<br />
means that when we have an election and I go out as I do a<br />
few weeks after an election to a nursing home or some<br />
coamplex, presumably I'a going to have another election. I<br />
mean, I travel around this country the whole period between<br />
elections and I do it because I enjoy doing it and it has<br />
got nothing to with elections.<br />
JOURNALZST: So the deal with the banks has nothing to do<br />
with the election at all? c2) </p>
<p>PRnlh MNISTER: The question I just had wasn't related to<br />
the deal with the banks. You've just done a jump haven't<br />
you? JOURNALIST: Noy no, no it was actually to do with the deal<br />
with the banks.<br />
PRDM NINISTRR: Your question about my travelling around;<br />
would that have anything to do with the election then you<br />
jumped to the question about the banks. Not this is<br />
something that needed to be doae bemause what we have been<br />
trying to do, as you know, is to level of f the extent of<br />
economic activity in Australia and we believe that the<br />
housing industry has now taken enough of that pressure and<br />
people acquiring houses have taken enough of that pressure.<br />
They've played their part and it's appropriate to put a<br />
limit on that.<br />
JO URN ALIST: So how long do you think you will be able to<br />
keep the interest rates down?<br />
PR33M MINISTER: Well we've made the point that the rest of<br />
the economic policy is in place to try and create the<br />
framework within which an appropriate time monetary policy<br />
can be eased. Buit both Paul Keating and I have said that we<br />
aea not going to be doing that a moment before it's<br />
responsible or certainly we are not going to keep rates<br />
higher for a moment longer than necessary but when we are<br />
persuaded on all the range of evidence that level of<br />
activity has come off to a point where we will be able to<br />
sustain the level of imports then it'. at that point that<br />
policy will be eased.<br />
JOURNALIST: mr Hawke while small banks are crying-foul the<br />
Opposition a" e crying fix and say its wholly to do with the<br />
forthcoming elect ion.<br />
PRIM XINISTER: Anyone taking any notice of the Opposition?<br />
I mean I'd just suggest that you look at the Business Review<br />
Wekly's poll. The busins community simply doesn't take<br />
the opposition seriously. I mean they have had donkey's<br />
years nov to com up with policies, they can't get a policy<br />
together for a number of reasons.* one# they are bitterly<br />
divided personally between Xr Howard and Mr Peacock and<br />
others They are spending all their time fighting one<br />
another. There are cocepua differences. We are<br />
literally years, now years behind the promises as to when<br />
their polioies would em forward. The business community,<br />
Australians generally, for very valid reasons don't take<br />
them seriously so anything that they have got to say about<br />
yesterday's decision is a matter of supreme indifference and<br />
irrelevance. </p>
