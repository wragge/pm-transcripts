FOR MEDIAWEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 8 1982<br />
THE FEDERATED SHIP PAINTERS' AND DOCKERS' UNION<br />
I congratulate Mr Hayden on his move to disaffiliate the<br />
Federated Ship Painters' and Dockers' from the Australian<br />
Labor Party.<br />
I have said all along that such a body as the Painters<br />
and Dockers should not be affiliated with any political<br />
party especially in the light of the Royal Commissioner's<br />
comments. I am glad that Mr Hayden has now accepted that view. </p>
