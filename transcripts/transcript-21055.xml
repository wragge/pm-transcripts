<p>The main purpose of the visit is to convey the thanks and Christmas greetings of the Australian people to all those members of the Australian Defence Force, Australian Federal Police, Australian Protective Service and Australian civilian advisers who have been making such a valuable contribution to the future of the Solomon Islands.</p>
