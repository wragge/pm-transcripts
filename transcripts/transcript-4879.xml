FOR PRESS 5 NOVEMBER 1978<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The meeting of the Loan Council tomorrow is clearly of great<br />
* importance for Australia. It forms an integral part of a long<br />
history of Australian growth and development.<br />
The history of Australia is one of innovation and enterprise<br />
by individual Australians. It is a history of growth and<br />
development of our vast natural resources.<br />
We have had our ups and downs, but overall as a nation we have<br />
enjoyed continuing growth and prosperity.<br />
The main catalyst for the development of our country-has been<br />
private enterprise individual Australian men and women of<br />
initiative, with a capacity for sheer hard work and a willingness<br />
when necessary to take risks.<br />
Our farmers have built up a most efficient and productive<br />
primary industry. Business people, particularly since the<br />
Second World War, have brought about a very significant<br />
expansion to our manufacturing base. In more recent times our<br />
tertiary and service industries have grown strongly.<br />
In the past 20 years, private industry has opened up vast new<br />
natural resources projects and mineral export industries.<br />
While the prime motivating force for the development of this<br />
country must always lie in the hands of individual Australians<br />
and private enterprise, Government has a vital role to play.<br />
The Commonwealth Government must provide sound economic management<br />
and a climate of stability that will encourage the private<br />
sector to invest.<br />
Reduction of inflation, control over Government expenditure and<br />
restraint in wage increases are fundamental to the long term<br />
economic stability of Australia. It is the Government's task<br />
to strive for the right pre-conditions which will enable sustained<br />
activity and growth by private industry. This was the message<br />
of the last Budget. It remains a paramount objective. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Government both Commonwealth and State has a further role too,<br />
for it must be prepared to assist with transport, ports, power,<br />
water and other basic resources.%<br />
In the Australian Federal system, there is a long history of<br />
co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States in<br />
providing such resources as these.<br />
The Commonwealth has been assisting the states in the funding of<br />
new roads since 1923. For the past 20 years, the Commonwealth<br />
has assisted the States in railway construction and updating<br />
rolling stock, in particular the standardisation of railway track<br />
gauges. The Snowy Mountain Hydro-Electric Scheme was a co-operative effort<br />
with Victoria and New South Wales, which made an important<br />
contribution to the economic development of Australia.<br />
During the past three years, Commonwealth support for development<br />
projects has continued to be strong. This year, the Commonwealth<br />
will be paying to the States over $ 500 million for roads; on<br />
railways, the Government will be providing $ 70 million over the<br />
next five years to upgrade the National Mainline Railway Network;<br />
and we have announced a five-year $ 200. million National Water<br />
Resources Programme to improve Australia's water supplies.<br />
In other areas too there has been increasingly close co-operation<br />
between the Commonwealth and the States. Agreement in principle<br />
has been reached on offshore matters -a subject which had caused<br />
much heat and little agreement in previous years.<br />
Close co-operation has also been achieved in the development of--<br />
a national Companies and Securities Scheme, the training of<br />
apprentices, joint arrangements to protect the environment and<br />
counter-terrorist measures.<br />
The Loan Council meeting tomorrow is another example of such<br />
co-operation.<br />
Together with the States, we have been exploring the possibility<br />
of an entirely new approach to encourage the development of new<br />
major resource projects in Australia.<br />
one of the factors which investors must take into account in<br />
making decisions on new projects is the availability of basic<br />
facilities such as transport, water resources, energy supplies,<br />
pipelines, and port and harbour works. We have been keen to see<br />
that new projects are not held up because of the lack of<br />
availability of these basic facilities.<br />
Arising from discussions which I initially had with Sir Charles<br />
Court in 1976, and after more than two years' study and discussion<br />
with the States, the Loan Council broke new ground on this issue<br />
at its meeting last June. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
It adopted new guidelines for its future consideration of<br />
proposals for special additions to the normal annual " semigovernment"<br />
borrowing programmes and for overseas borrowings<br />
by authorities to finance these additions. These additional<br />
borrowings were to finance projects of special significance<br />
for development.<br />
It was decided that a special Loan Council would be held at<br />
a later date this year to consider the first batch of projects<br />
submitted by the States for approval, This decision was of course<br />
taken before the Budget, and it was in the context of this<br />
decision that the parameters of this year's Budget were set.<br />
In accordance with the guidelines set down by the Loan Council,<br />
a working party of Commonwealth and State officers have been<br />
examining a total of 12 such projects proposed by each of the<br />
State Governments. The 12 projects cover significant development<br />
in all States.<br />
Two projects have been submitted by New South Wales coal<br />
loading facilities at Port Kembla and Balmain and the Eraring<br />
Electricity Project.<br />
Victoria is seeking additional borrowings for the vast Loy Yang<br />
Power Project and the proposed World Trade Centre in Melbourne.<br />
Queensland has put forward the development of coal export<br />
facilities at Hay point and power station projects . at Gladstone,<br />
Wivenhoe and Tarong.<br />
South Australia wants to finance infrastructure for the Redcliff<br />
Petrochemical Project.<br />
Western Australia has submitted for approval the 1500 kilometre<br />
pipeline to bring natural gas from the North-West Shelf to Perth,<br />
water supply and rail facilities for an alumina project at Worsley<br />
and the upgrading of power supplies in the Pilbara.<br />
Tasmania wants to make additional borrowings to develop further<br />
its hydro-electric power system and water supply projects in<br />
Hobart and North-Western Tasmania.<br />
The borrowings for these projects would be phased over a period<br />
of up to eight years and the total applied for is an additional<br />
borrowing of about $ 150 million this year, and amounts ranging<br />
from $ 236 $ 393 million in the succeeding five years at<br />
June 1978 prices.<br />
The report of the working party on these 12 projects will be<br />
examined at the Loan Council meeting tomorrow.<br />
A responsible borrowing programme could greatly assist development<br />
of a number of important new projects projects which would<br />
obviously have a significant impact on activity, export earnings<br />
and employment. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-4,'<br />
At the same time, the Commonwealth has a responsibility to<br />
make sure that any programme of special borrowings approved<br />
by the Loan Council is consistent with the over-riding need<br />
to maintain our fiscal and monetary policy and thus to<br />
nurture economic recovery.<br />
It is for this reason that the voting procedure at the Loan<br />
Council requires approval for any individual project by a simple<br />
majority of which the Commonwealth forms a part.<br />
It is these considerations which will be foremost in our<br />
minds during our discussions with the States tomorrow.<br />
