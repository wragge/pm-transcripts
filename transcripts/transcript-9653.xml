TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE VICTORIAN ALP FUNDRAISING DINNER, CARLTON<br />
RADDISON HOTEL, MELBOURNE, 4 JULY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
I think that when one looks at the last decade one sees the changes which<br />
have taken place in Australia, it has been a very great challenge in Victoria<br />
and New South Wales. And particularly on Victoria, I think, particularly with<br />
the shift in the industrial base, the great challenge here is on the part of<br />
individual busines Ãµ people to measure up to that and make the change. To<br />
pick up the opportunities and run with them. We are delighted to see so<br />
many of you because people who run businesses have actually got to turn a<br />
buck, they have got to open the doors the next morning, they have got to<br />
make things work and as an objective test about whether you're doing it well<br />
or not and, I think, we always enjoy the opportunity to talk to people such as<br />
yourselves because it does give you a better touch, a better feel about how<br />
the economy is running.<br />
I think that we have been through a pretty great change in Australia, perhaps<br />
not often well understood and that is, that we do and have since the 1980s<br />
run a very consultative approach to government. John ( Brumby) made the<br />
point in his introductory remarks about the opportunity of meeting so many<br />
Ministers and politcy makers. As valuable as this evening and this afternoon<br />
has been, we really do keep in touch most of the time, perhaps not as broadly<br />
as we have today, but we do listen because we have taken the view that<br />
running an economy and a society on a consultative basis lends itself to<br />
running a more cohesive and comprehensive approach and that cohesion<br />
gives you the chance to produce economic outcomes that you wouldn't in a<br />
society where the institutional interests play their roles out, but they don't play<br />
them together.<br />
Now I think we can be very proud of the changes which Australia has made,<br />
in the last ten or twelve years. Very proud indeed. I mean never before have<br />
we been in a position as we are in now. We are sitting now juxtaposed to the<br />
fastest growing markets in the world. Through most of our economic history,<br />
those markets were in Europe, or they were in North America. They were not </p>
<p>here. But, now, the 1980s opening of country, opening up the financial<br />
markets that John mentioned earlier, knocking the tariff wall down, getting the<br />
whole motion of productivity up, thinking about building our capital stock,<br />
product innovationrunninig the education system to power the research and<br />
development and innovation along. It has all happened just when the Asia-<br />
Pacific markets have really blossomed. Led, of course, by Japan and later by<br />
countries like Korea and Singapore, but now joined by so many Indonesia,<br />
Malaysia, China and here we are sitting at the doorstep. I don't think we<br />
have ever had a better opportunity and we now understand that that<br />
opportunity is there and that we can actually go out and meet that challenge<br />
and succeed in it. But, we can only go out together.<br />
We are not going to really make it work straggling out if economic policy and<br />
industrial policy and business don't see eye to eye. If there -isn't -a p'lan, if<br />
there isn't -&amp; strategy, we won't actually make it. But, we face these changes<br />
and they have been quite profound. I believe that the Australian people have<br />
measured up to these economic changes and challenges in a way, probably<br />
few societies would have and, I think, that if they believe that there is a<br />
strategy and a plan they will follow. And, they will make the effort and they<br />
will make the change. The transformation is quite profound. We published a<br />
budget a month or so ago. It is forecasting growth right out until the end of<br />
1998. If you take the period from 1983 to 1998 15 years in 15 years we<br />
have had only 14 months of negative growth. That is, a modest reduction in<br />
GOP in 1990 and 1991, otherwise 1983 until 1998 we will see a period of<br />
sustained economic growth at about double the rate we were used to seeing.<br />
Just over double the rate on the previous period of government in the<br />
previous 10 years.<br />
In other words, we have met a challenge and we are building up wealth at<br />
quite a profound rate and we are doing it on a basis that we can actually run<br />
the economy faster, but not see the proceeds of growth frittered away in<br />
prices and wages. And, the test of that maturity of Australia is that low<br />
inflation mass that two to three per cent inflation we have in place we have<br />
had inflation under two and a half per cent now for three or four years and we<br />
have just, the other day, signed up to Accord Mark VIII with the Australian<br />
Council of Trade Unions, in probably the mos _ t consultative of the consultative<br />
economic acts. Probably the most consultative.<br />
Now, in the Parliament recently I have been quoting Robert Reich, the US<br />
Labor Secretary, and I think it is worth quoting him to you because he said<br />
recently at an OECD conference here in the United States, we have had<br />
huge employment growth and let me say that outside of Australia the<br />
United States is the only other country that has had the employment growth<br />
we've had or at that sort level on the same base. But, he said we have<br />
had high employment growth, but we have had a fall in real wages for 14<br />
years He' said on-the other hand, in Europe, they have got very high<br />
real wages, but lousy rates of employment. He said, I think that is a fairly<br />
lousy choice.' What I say to you is we agree with that and that Australia has<br />
come right up the middle with very strong rates of employment growth and<br />
good and reasonable and sustainable rates of remuneration. </p>
<p>3<br />
So, we have had as a consequence, a 40 per cent increase in household<br />
disposable incomes since 1953 which, of course, powered purchasing power,<br />
powered demand through business and at the same time we have had now<br />
over two million jobs since 1983. We have had 630,000 since the last<br />
election. And, we are doing it because we can run the economy faster, we<br />
are doing it by putting weight on three instances of policy fiscal policy,<br />
moTnetary policy and wages policy. Almost in every other comparbie-ountry<br />
you can forget the third one. It is only interest rates, monetary policy and<br />
fiscal policy. But here, we have the third. So, instead of having inordinate<br />
weight on the budget or inordinate weight on interest rates, we can spread<br />
the load onto wages.<br />
I brought with me a copy of last weeks Accord. Most of you wouldn't have<br />
seen the document, you would only have seen reports of it. But, the maturity<br />
of it, the common sense of it that the work force in the representation of it,<br />
through its peak councils can sit down with the government and say ' how can<br />
we run this economy better, how can we agree on faster rates of growth,<br />
better employment growth and yet good profits, strong investment and good<br />
presence in our export markets?' The way, of course, is doing it through a<br />
consultative agreed basis and, of course, at the same time coming to terms<br />
with that other point John mentioned and that is savings.<br />
Now, let me just read this little piece from page two of the Accord, it says<br />
' This Accord is based on and consistent with maintaining an underlying rate of<br />
inflation of 2 to 3 per cent on average over the cycle. This will help to<br />
maintain our competitive position and the real income of workers'. I mean,<br />
you couldn't believe this thing, 12 years ago nobody would have given a<br />
snowballs chance in hell of such a document being produced. This is the<br />
trade union movement walking up to the government and with. thie<br />
government sifting down and saying ' we will run a wage system which is<br />
based on and consistent with maintaining an underlying rate ofi i nflation of 2<br />
to 3 per cent on average. Not wage indexation or an enterprise bdrgaining<br />
system which has got no inflation target underpinning it, but one which it says<br />
will run an enterprise bargaining system, but will run it essentially in such a<br />
way it will produce -2t o 3 per ceninf flation.<br />
Then it talks about the safety net. It says if you can't get something done in<br />
the enterprise bargain, you fall back and you get it under the safety net.<br />
Within the safety net it is talking about $ 10 to $ 12 or $ 11 to $ 14 for people on<br />
award wages. -It says ' The Accord parties will support an approach to ' the<br />
AIRC to deliver three further annual adjustments of $ 9 to $ 12 per week<br />
available at the award level and $ 11 to $ 14 per week for those on award<br />
rates. In other words, there is an enterprise bargaining system where we are<br />
growing that continually and for those who can't get a bargain, they come<br />
back to the safety net.<br />
At the back of the document talking about the social wage, health, family,<br />
maternity leave it talks about superannuation and it has got a table. The<br />
table starts at 1992-93. It has got superannuation guarantee, payroll of up to </p>
<p>4<br />
$ 1 million 3 per cent and . then iri'the ( total) column it has got 3 to 4.5 per<br />
cent and then under payroll of $ 1 million or more 4 to 5 per cent. In this year,<br />
on 1 July, it went to 6 per cent for payrolls over $ 1 million and 5 per cent of<br />
those up to $ 1 million, next year it is 6 and 6 per cent. But then comes the<br />
budget change, the change that Ralph Willis delivered on Budget night.<br />
When we pay the tax cuts into superannuation accounts 1 per cent, 1 per<br />
cent, 1 per cent. And, for that follows an employee contribution of 1 per cent<br />
in 1997-98 one further per cent in 1998-99 and one further per cent in 1999-<br />
2000 followed by 1, 1, and 1 per cent in the tax cuts. At the end of the table it<br />
says 15 per cent. That means every Australian working person will have, at a<br />
minimum, 15 per cent by the year 2000-2003. It is seven years away. So,<br />
under this Accord, with this government since the middle 1980s we put<br />
together a system which not only is now underpinning a low inflation rate on a<br />
systemic basis in a much more flexible labour market, but at the same time it<br />
is putting together a basis of retirement incomes for savings of up to 15 per<br />
cent for every Australian person by the year 2002 seven years away.<br />
Now, does that beat screwing businesses with high interest rates and<br />
monetary policy to hold down growth and inflation? Does that beat beating<br />
the hell out of working persons so that the Labor Secretary of this country<br />
could get up and say we haven't had a real wage increase in 14 years? Does<br />
this beat having a paucity of national savings? Well, I think it does because<br />
what we are finding under superannuation is that we believe we will have $ 1<br />
trillion in superannuation accounts by the year 2000 and $ 2 trillion by the<br />
year 2020 that is $ 2,000 billion. Now, that is an almighty amount and if you<br />
bring it back from GOP the additions to savings the Treasury believes it will<br />
add 2 per cent of GOP to savings by the year 2000 and 4 per cent of GDP by<br />
the year 2020.<br />
This is a staggering change. Our opponents say ' oh, it's another Accord, it's<br />
number eight'. It has been eight Accords coming from a highly rigid<br />
centralised system needing a big change in real wages to accommodate a<br />
massive depreciation of the exchange rate going to award restructuring,<br />
going to productivity, going out from enterprise based bargaining systems,<br />
focussing on employment in Accord Mark VII and then focussing on or locking<br />
in low inflation in Accord Mark Vill.<br />
It is just the sort of things you don't see from -national governments. It is the<br />
sort of thing you don't see from the workforce. It is a revolution in the way we<br />
run economic policy in Australia compared to most otherQECD countries. Of<br />
course, John Howard says ' I wouldn't have a bar of it'. You say ' well, why<br />
wouldn't you?-We-' v-eot enterprise agreements for 65 per cent of all people<br />
covered by federal awards, why wouldn't you?' Well, of course, you don't<br />
have flexibility downwards, you have a safety net. But, if you can't pay $ 11 to<br />
$ 14 per week for someone on $ 22,000 in an economy with this sort of bounty,<br />
have we got to the point where the profit share where it is in the economy,<br />
with a stock market index of 2003, from memory. When I became Treasurer<br />
in 1983, the all ordinaries index was 451. It is now 2003. It is four to five<br />
times the real wealth in the stock market than it was then. Are we to say to<br />
people ' well, we are so hung up against this, we are going to hop into the </p>
<p>people under $ 22,000' because that is really what it means. Because there is<br />
no way you are going to stop the people in the strong parts of industry in<br />
metals, in construction but, what the Accord does is say we'll let them make<br />
their productivity bargains, but if the productivity isn't coming through, we'll<br />
hold the system to 2 to 3 per cent, but it is on the basis that the low paid get<br />
treated fairly.<br />
Now, what can be fairer than that? I don't think very much.<br />
In the last two months we have introduced, amongst other things, this Accord.<br />
But we have also introduced a budget surplus, that great change in<br />
superannuation, the Justice Statement, the standard gauge railway linking<br />
Australia for the first time, the government's proposal for an Australian<br />
Republic and, of course, the Accord. The government has done more in two<br />
months than you would have seen out of our opponents in two decades. That<br />
is simply a fact.<br />
As a consequence of this, we are seeing the capacity to run the economy into<br />
the future and deal with some of the longer running problems like the current<br />
account deficit. Now, let me just say something about some of these<br />
subjects.<br />
We are seeing an enormous amount of blatant goal post lifting going on now<br />
in the economic debate. Two and a half years ago it was ' Prime Minister,<br />
what are you doing about growth and employment one million people out of<br />
work when are you going to get the economy growing again?'. Ok, we're<br />
going to get building we put One Nation in we've got One Nation working.<br />
We will try to lift the spending capacity of the economy. We will try to<br />
promote more growth and we have got that growth now moving up and as a<br />
consequence we have created 630,000 jobs in that two and a half year period<br />
and we have the economy growing as fast as 6.5 per cent. Now, coming<br />
back to around three and three quarters a sustainable rate of growth. In the<br />
late 1980s, a couple of years before that ' what are you doing about inflation?'<br />
Here we are, we have still got inflation of 5 and 6 per cent. We have come<br />
out of the recession with inflation under one per cent. It is now in a high<br />
growth economy around two to three per cent.<br />
So, we have essentially broken the back of inflationary expectations and high<br />
inflation in this country. And, we are back onto a growth path and we are now<br />
seeing a hugely strong phase of private investment. And they say but look<br />
we didn't really mean that, what are you doing about the current account<br />
deficit? What we are doing about that is we are putting into place the only<br />
change that will really matter, that is the big underlying change to our national<br />
savings because we don't have the level of private savings to encourage and<br />
hold together the strong capital investment programs we need to rebuild our<br />
capital stocks for exports and our merchandise trade. We need to put those<br />
savings into place.<br />
So Ralph Willis' Budget, takes the Budget deficit from $ 13 billion last year to<br />
a surplus this year of $ 700 million now reduced by John Howard's antics in<br />
.4 </p>
<p>the Senate to about $ 400 million. By the next two years it goes to a surplus<br />
of $ 7 billion. So from a deficit of $ 13 billion to a surplus of $ 7 billion, is a<br />
billion turnaround. $ 20 billion is 4 per cent of GDP.<br />
I have already told you in superannuation during the latter part of the 90s, will<br />
add 2 percentage points to GOP of savings in super. That is 6 per cent. The<br />
current account problem is 2 1/ 2 percentage points. It has been running on<br />
average at 4 1/ 2 to 5 per cent of GDP and it needs to run at 2 1/ 2 to<br />
3 per cent. So we have got a 2 1/ 2 percentage point problem with which we<br />
met it with a 6 percentage point fix. Now that is what will make the difference.<br />
But hysteria and incantations, and voodoo, and snake oil will not fix the<br />
problem. The problem will be fixed by lifting our national savings and the<br />
Government is lifting it in the only way we know how. That is we have taken<br />
the Budget and swung it strongly back into surplus while, at the same time,<br />
building a basis in award superannuation, in national superannuation, that we<br />
never had before.<br />
In other words, if we accept the fact that our discretionary private savings are<br />
down, as it is in most countries like this, how do you get the savings levels<br />
up? How do you deal with the current account?<br />
I notice that terrible man, Peter Costello, saying the other day " I've got cold<br />
anger about the current account deficit". But he didn't have any cold policies<br />
to match it.<br />
But you see, go back to September last year, and this is why I want to talk to<br />
a business audience as distinct from purely financial markets audience,<br />
because go back to last year. The September quarter accounts, for the year<br />
to September, were 6 1/ 2 per cent. The financial markets said " horror, shock,<br />
horror. We are growing at a pace we can't afford." And we said " Well we are<br />
going to adjust monetary policy, put rates up a couple of points and then slow<br />
it down."<br />
They called for a major economic statement in February. They called for<br />
another 2 to 3 percentage points of interest rate rises on top of the<br />
November/ December rises. They did all these things and yet we have got the<br />
economy now back at the last quarter to 3 3/ 4 per cent. So we come from<br />
6 1/ 2 to 3 3/ 4 per cent. In other words, back to a sustainable level.<br />
But they would have had us have a February statement, another<br />
3 percentage points on interest rates. It would have been a smouldering ruin<br />
out there if we had taken their advice. In other words, " you must panic, you<br />
must be in a state of shock, that is the only condition to be in. Now get out<br />
there and shock yourselves and shock everybody else."<br />
Meanwhile, the people back running businesses are saying God, let's get on<br />
with the business. How do we keep this place together." And, of course, the<br />
same thing we're saying now just as we had that irrational reaction in<br />
September which the Government, of course, in its wisdom saw through we </p>
<p>are saying now with the current, account deficit, we have the policies in place.<br />
We have a 4 percentage point Change of GOP on the Budget and we have<br />
got about 2 percentage points of superannuation.<br />
Now let's say we get into a slower phase around the turn of the century and<br />
some of that cyclical revenue goes. Call a 6 percentage point change<br />
4 per cent. I mean take all, if you like, the argument out. We have got a<br />
4 percentage point fix in there, for a 2 1/ 2 percentage point problem. I mean<br />
that is how we will get it done.<br />
But in that context culled out competitiveness together we are sitting on a 2 to<br />
3 per cent inflation rate for the workforce. We are sitting on a pile of savings<br />
coming through to superannuation and, at the same time, we are still<br />
promoting the structural change in the economy, as enterprise bargaining<br />
goes and productivity bargaining. But we now have, for the first time ever, a<br />
naturally contestable and contested Australian economy.<br />
We pulled the tariff walls down. We started to get real competition in this<br />
economy and that natural state of contest is producing natural productivity<br />
which is holding down, in a much more natural way, the inflation rate. We are<br />
getting these low inflation numbers more naturally to rise, than simply<br />
resorting to high interest rates which would have been our stock standard<br />
response in the 60s, the 70s, or even in the<br />
In other words, it may be an irony that it took a Labor Government to give<br />
Australia a real market economy because that real market economy is now<br />
working for this country and it is giving us low inflation, high growth and high<br />
employment. Now none of that comprehension is on the other side of politics,<br />
none of it.<br />
And here is John Howard out today, you saw them on the weekend trying<br />
their hands. Now, John Howard says " I'll give you the economy of the future<br />
by rebuilding the tariff walls". Then John Moore. The last we heard from<br />
John Moore was the TV affair, back in the 1970s. He brought television.<br />
It was of no real account just as he isn't.<br />
But here is John Mooreand he is back with Bruce Stannard from the<br />
Australian Business Monthly, who is now employed by John Howard. Now<br />
you remember the ABM campaign against the tariff reductions? You<br />
remember the Australian Business Monthly's big campaign, you know the big<br />
push against the reduced tariffs? Well that view now prevails in<br />
John Howard's office.<br />
And so here we have come, 12 years of hard work in opening up the<br />
economy, making it a contestable economy, inducing low inflation, setting up<br />
the savings balance, opening the tariff walls, getting the industrial change to<br />
meet it, taking the opportunity of doubling our manufacturing levels, trebling<br />
our manufacturing exports. Doing all these things and then now in 1995 as<br />
we face Asia as never before, as we face the market opportunities as never<br />
before, what is John Howard saying? " We'll muck around with tariff walls." </p>
<p>We only tried it for 40 years and produced a closeted, low growth economy,<br />
slow growth in the economy, where entrepreneurship was virtually extinct and<br />
we have finally seen the error of our ways and we are going out and putting<br />
organisations together like APEC arguing the case inside the GATT for a<br />
global and open multilateral trading system trying to string the Pacific Basin<br />
together in a free trade area under APEC and what is the alternative<br />
Prime Minister's view " let's start building the barriers again".<br />
I mean you can't believe it. I mean you can't take them seriously, really.<br />
I mean can you imagine here they are creeping out on some little press<br />
release " oh yes, we might build the tariff barriers again".<br />
Now the thing is I don't know why Labor Governments believe in competition<br />
and the Liberal Governments don't. No I don't because I mean low tariffs<br />
mean more competition.<br />
It was like that at the Council of Australian Governments. The Treasurer and<br />
I are battling through three Premiers' Conferences, three Councils of<br />
Australian Governments, to get a group of Liberal Premiers to sign up to their<br />
principles. But, finally, in the end we shooed all them into it and they signed<br />
up, only to apply the Federal Trade Practices law to the State<br />
instrumentalities. You know it should have been done 20 years ago, but we<br />
got them into it.<br />
But here we are now in the position where we are arguing for these tariff<br />
changes and we are arguing for these competition changes and they are<br />
trying to resist them and, as a consequence in seeking to resist them, they<br />
would deal Australia a really great blow in terms of our industrial structure<br />
and where we are heading.<br />
Now you saw all their fulminations last week on the current account deficit.<br />
The very day the figure came out, John Howard was doing in $ 300 million of<br />
revenue in the Senate. The very same day. And if the Democrats would<br />
support him, he would do in $ 2 1/ 2 billion worth of revenue in the Senate of<br />
the Government's proposed budgetary changes.<br />
In other words, the surplus and the importance of savings in the current<br />
account equation would simply, to put in summary, be a bit of low brow<br />
politics in the Senate. The very day that he is talking about the current<br />
account deficit and his Deputy is coping with a cold sweat, with a bad attack<br />
of cold anger. The very same day, just as the Senate bells are ringing to do<br />
in the measures.<br />
So at the same time he says he doesn't believe in compulsion in saving. He<br />
would essentially, he said on superannuation, he would cap it at where it is<br />
6 per cent and then he would introduce tax concessions for people who take<br />
out private super. </p>
<p>In other words back to the 70s, when we had 40 per cent coverage of<br />
superannuation. That is $ 40 billion in fund assets $ 40 billion and we are<br />
heading for $ 2,000 billion. No, no, bad luck, he doesn't want that.<br />
He'd prefer $ 40 billion. So he is going to cap the super assets off and<br />
basically crimp that particular one.<br />
In other words, the only thing that matters now in terms of that one remaining<br />
area of economic policy that we must surmount, that is our savings in balance<br />
and current account deficit. He would drop off the revenue measures and at<br />
the same time crimp superannuation.<br />
So I mean I would have thought that the people in business who look at this<br />
country and look at the opportunities and say, you are meeting a Labor<br />
Government and a Labor Cabinet, who have run a pro-growth,<br />
pro-employment, pro-profit economy, where we have now seen very strong<br />
levels of investment and we are seeing into the future.<br />
The current account deficit on Friday was loaded with investment goods and<br />
just as we spiked the growth in September last year, in December with those<br />
monetary adjustments in the Budget, as we brought the growth down from<br />
6 1/ 2 per cent to 3 3/ 4 per cent, as the growth subsided, so shall the current<br />
account deficit. It is a reflection of what the state of the economy was a year<br />
or so ago. But in a lower growth economy, we will see a response.<br />
I noticed Moody's the other day saying they thought the current account<br />
deficit would decline to 4 1/ 2 per cent of GDP next year, where this year it is<br />
6 per cent and in the forecasts in the Budget, we have it at 5 1/ 2 per cent.<br />
So, in other words, as the economy gets back to its sustainable rate of<br />
growth, so too will we see a subside in the current account deficit.<br />
In other words, we have got the position covered. The Government has got<br />
the position covered and we are not going to run around like chooks with their<br />
heads cut off and we are not going to have a cold sweat, or a mock panic<br />
We are actually going to go in there and govern the place like we have been<br />
doing now and we will come out the opposite way, as always, in a pro-growth<br />
phase only this time, in this cycle, with low inflation and higher productivity,<br />
engaging those countries around us, and lifting our exports and lifting the<br />
value of the things we produce, lifting the things we do and trying to do them<br />
better. Now Mr Howard says you'd think I have got a bit of a thing about him, well<br />
I suppose I have, he stands for all the wrong things he said, of course, when<br />
I came out and said how can we go around Asia, taking the opportunities to<br />
sell Australia. Say, " here we are, we are a multicultural country, we have<br />
seen the light, we have opened our economy up, we are engaging you, the<br />
best of Asia We are out there as a people, of independence, of strength of<br />
mind, of clarity of our identity as a sovereign nation. But, by the way, we are<br />
borrowing the Queen of another country. We are borrowing the Monarchy<br />
from another country. </p>
<p>He doesn't see the importance to Australia of Australia being fully<br />
independent and representing itself. So he says he'll give Australians a<br />
republic he says. But he is actually for the Monarchy himself and you know<br />
how hard it is to get a referendum passed in this country. You know how<br />
hard it is. It will be to get a majority of electors in a majority of States to agree<br />
upon the structure of an Australian republic. Imagine doing it with the<br />
Government of the day saying " look you can have a vote, but we don't<br />
believe it". You know you can have a vote, but the Prime Minister actually<br />
believes in the Monarchy<br />
And I noticed that in the Sydney Sun-Herald, an article just a week ago which<br />
said this it's by Alex Mitchell he said " Two years ago I had a private<br />
discussion with a very senior Liberal and at that time Prime Minister Paul<br />
Keating had nailed his republican ideals to the mast and I asked how are the<br />
Liberal Party intending responding. Now worries he replied, we can kick the<br />
whole thing into touch by calling for a people's convention. The people's<br />
convention is the perfect talking shop. It will keep the issue off the Party<br />
political agenda and the election agenda. With the people's convention up<br />
and running the Liberal Party wouldn't have to say or do anything about the<br />
republic. It would effectively bury the issue as long as we wanted." Later in<br />
the conversation he announced " I am a Monarchist, I was born a Monarchist<br />
and I will die a Monarchist." Of course, the journalist couldn't make the<br />
attribution. But we now know it was John Howard.<br />
In other words, the convention is just another device for him not to make any<br />
decision because the thing you must know about him is that he is utterly<br />
indecisive. He has no policy ambitions whether it is in terms of our identity,<br />
whether in terms of economic policy, whether it is in terms of competition.<br />
You name it, he will basically go for the smother and the smother is the same<br />
on the republic as it is on any of the other subjects which I mentioned tonight<br />
on economic policy, or on tariffs, or any of the rest.<br />
I would like to say to you that when you get down to the policies of the<br />
Opposition, they talk about labour market reform. John Howard says " people<br />
know I stand for pro-family policies, for industrial relations reform, for further<br />
micro-reform, giving people choice in health areas".<br />
Labour market reform means abolishing the Accord and knocking out awards.<br />
It means cutting the heart out of wages.<br />
He says he is pro-family, but he is not pro-income support, he is not<br />
pro-worker, he is not pro-wage increase, he is not pro-the annual leave<br />
loading, he is not pro-super. He is definitely pro-cuts in Government<br />
spending. When he talks about pro-choice in the health system, it means<br />
what you read for that is Medicare gets ripped to pieces, the 85 per cent<br />
rebate goes, bulk-billing goes. And when he talks about micro-reform, that is<br />
code for running backwards on tariffs in what he calls a dose of reform<br />
fatigues. That is it. That is all you know about him. It is just that prejudicial<br />
ideological deficiency he has had for these years. </p>
<p>But the clarity with which the Government puts its views, its policies, its<br />
Budget, its Accord, its Working Nation programs, its One Nation programs,<br />
the changes to education, the changes to TAFE, to higher education, the<br />
whole training agenda, getting the long term unemployed back to work, all<br />
that nitty gritty in policy is all foreign to them.<br />
So I would like to say this to you tonight, that we appreciate the support of the<br />
business community in this country. We, actually, are interested in you.<br />
We are interested in your life, your life's experience, your business<br />
experience. We want to see you benefit from a country which is governed<br />
decently with good policy and we want to see you participate in it.<br />
It is on you that our hopes depend on getting that investment into place,<br />
on seeing those additions in product, in seeing that addition to employment.<br />
It is on you, in fact, that the whole of now the very pro-market position of the<br />
Government's policies rely. We rely on a youthful, ambitious business<br />
community to go and make those changes work and when I say business<br />
community I mean, in the broad sense, the financial markets and the<br />
productive side of business, the businesses that give us service industries,<br />
the lot.<br />
And it is for that, which we have dedicated ourselves with you. That is in a<br />
decade of consultation, in a decade of listening to what needs to be done, of<br />
making changes that on many occasions has put the Government at risk<br />
politically and particularly in proximity to elections. We have never flinched<br />
from putting the big changes into place and we are still doing it.<br />
But that same consultation we have with you, we have with the trade unions<br />
and we have it to the point where they're prepared to underwrite a 2 to<br />
3 per cent inflation rate and agree that their constituency put 15 per cent of<br />
their income away for savings agreed to put 15 per cent of their income<br />
away as savings and these are the sort of national goals, and national<br />
achievements Australia needs.<br />
And if we can not only make the structures together here in Australia, we can<br />
also make the structures outside of Australia for Australia and that is why<br />
whenever we see Austrade, or we lead a trade mission, or we sit down at the<br />
GAT or we thread together a great institution like APEC putting the<br />
Un-ited States into a compact with East Asia and putting ourselves in there<br />
we do this with you and for you.<br />
Now there can never have been a time in our history, never, when we have<br />
faced such strong markets and such great opportunities to take our place with<br />
the community of nations in this part of the world, with a high growth, high<br />
productivity, low inflation economy. We have never been in this position<br />
before. If we can just keep our gaze on the path and make the remedial policy<br />
changes we need to put Australia in a place where we are going to need<br />
them to maintain that strong investment through the 90s, then the </p>
<p>opportunities for this country, one people in a continent, a nation sharing no<br />
border with anybody, with the prospect of having an environment that many<br />
other countries will envy, with a cohesive social society, where we don't have<br />
an underclass, where we wield ahead together, where there is care for one<br />
another with access and equity in health and in education, where we have a<br />
commitment as Australians to one another and to society and to group, that<br />
we move ahead strongly, that we have a reconciliation with our Aboriginal<br />
people, we are clear about our identity, we move as a force into this<br />
community in the area in which we live. This is the Australia the Labor Party<br />
dreams of. This is the Australia we are now having and this is the future we<br />
can have.<br />
So in this city, where a great economic challenge has faced you and where<br />
we have tried to ease the adjustment pressures to get you to another plateau<br />
of growth and opportunity, we want you to come good with this and the fact<br />
that you are here tonight, so many of you, supporting us, identifying with us,<br />
gives us great heart great heart to know that out there, there are many<br />
people who share this dream of this great opportunity for this nation, in this<br />
continent of ours, in this region of ours.<br />
That has got to be the way. We can't look backwards. We can't go back to<br />
the past to high tariffs, or the 60s, or a society of two pieces, or lost<br />
opportunities, or not understanding that we have to do it together because<br />
I think if we do that we won't get the opportunities again. This is not an<br />
opportunity where we can lose it and recover it again. It is one where we<br />
have to keep on the front foot and keep on going.<br />
At any rate, thanks for giving us some heart, thank you for supporting us and<br />
supporting us tonight here and supporting us out there where it really<br />
matters, in the spirit of it all, towards that bigger thing I think we all cherish.<br />
Thank you.<br />
