PRIME MINISTER<br />
STA'rF. MENT BY THE PIM NI MNisTrEl TJF 140N P J KEATINCI N11,<br />
COUNCIL OF Aus-rRAVIAN GOVERNMENTS &amp;, EETrIN( NIABO0<br />
Today the Commonwealth offered a -package of mneasures to deal wvilh the High<br />
Court's Mal) xi decision and its ramifications. The package included offers to validate<br />
cxisting l eases and pay c-ompensation.<br />
Thci-e was not unanimous agreemili to this package by the States and I'errirories.<br />
[ lhe Slates and'len-itories wanted the Commonwealth to make an executive decision<br />
to validate leases back to 1975 and to meet compensation without themselves taking<br />
any cxccutive decisions to provide an adequate policy response to Mabo.<br />
Responsibility for the failure of this meeting to agree on a national response rests<br />
largely with Premiers Kennett and Court because of their refusal to accept that the<br />
High Court has act ually made a decision which requires a process and mechanism to<br />
give cffcct to that decision.<br />
Further, they wvere not prepared to agree to a scheme to adequately recognise and<br />
protect native title, an obvious requiremecnt of the High Court decision.<br />
Premiers Kennett and Court must now explain to their communities, and particularly<br />
to industry, why they w~ ere not prepared to avail themselves of the Commonwealth's<br />
offer to validate existing leases and carry all the compensation back to 1975.<br />
They must also explain to the Aboriginal community why they were not prepared to<br />
embrace mechanisms which wvould have heard and decided native title claims and<br />
given pitotcewio it) title,., giunIed.<br />
The Council of Australiani Governiments is an executive body. It was established to<br />
make executiv: e decisions. The Commonwealth had circulated a most comprehensive<br />
response to the Mabo judgement and P'remiers attending the meeting % vere in a<br />
position to mnake executive decisions about this matter. Some Premiers clearly failed<br />
to accept this rcsponsibility.<br />
In so doing they have done no service to the nation, and a deep disservice to their<br />
States. </p>

Our sense of selfesteem, our nbul'tY to show that wce dio indeed1 bvilkve in lhilirss and<br />
ittstice fir all and havt: the collctiv* e will delivei it defines tfic kind of people wu<br />
are lo ourselves and the world.<br />
The Commonweal3th will now have to reounsider its position.<br />
I took the view into the meeting that Mabo was a national issue requiring a national<br />
rcsponse. It is it major opportunity, as well as challenge, for the nation as a whole<br />
and for allI its Sovernments.<br />
The core p~ ropositiont's which I advocated were based on the 33 suggestcd principles<br />
endorsed by the Commonwealth Cabinet, and sent to the Premiers last week. In<br />
particular, I emnphasised.-<br />
( ftie need for recogiiiti'it and appropriate protection ot native title as now an<br />
irrefutable fact iii Australian lawv, and the total pointlessness of thinking<br />
otherwise-, 1~ lowing directly fromn this, thc need for land management regimes in the<br />
Future to be updated to recognise and take proper account of native title;<br />
non discriminatory treatment of native title, as the benchmark required by the<br />
Racial Discrimination Act,<br />
the desitability of preserving native title to the maximum extent practicable;<br />
the imprt~ rance of establishing effective mec hanisins, in the ronil ctrihunals,<br />
so that native title claims can be registered and sensibly resolved;<br />
the need to act together to remove doubt about the validity of certain grants<br />
issued since: 1975, and<br />
the importance of responding positively to the wider implication,% o f the Maho<br />
decision in ternms of justice, economic development and reconciliation.<br />
The approach which I put forward was therefore a comprehensive and realistic onc.<br />
In particular, the required action to remove doubt about existing grants must go hand<br />
in hand with a commitment to move to ways of dealing with land which do justice to<br />
1he Mabo decision rather than close our eyes to it.<br />
I also put on the table a very strong offer which would absolutely secure the existing<br />
grants which may be in doubt. I said that the Commonwealth would be prtepared to<br />
pick up the entire comrpensation bill involved in validating grants from 1975 to the<br />
end of June 1993, and that we would legislate to clear the way for States to validate<br />
their grants.<br />
But obviously that offer must be part of a wider national package. </p>

Against this background, it is disappointing that there were still undercurrents hrorn<br />
States of only grudging recognition of the High Court's historic decision, a tendency<br />
to view Mabo just as a prohlcmn requiring only a minimalist solution, and Parochial<br />
views fairly evidcnt.<br />
Because the issue is of nationial significance, and pressing, AuIstralia needs to move<br />
ahead on Mabo. We shall now proceed to draft Commonwealth legislation which<br />
can set a framework for dealinig with native title. We shall also continue to work on<br />
thc wider Mabo issues.<br />
In this next stage, we will continue to consult -with the States and Territories, as vAell<br />
of course as representatives of Aborigial and Torres Strait Islanders and<br />
representatives of industry. Obviously, we shall take into aCCOUnt what has been said<br />
ut COAG.<br />
We wvant, in all of this, to work with the States and TFerri tories. But we do need to<br />
move fbrward as a nation, and they need to get on board.<br />
The Commonwealth. in its further work, willI continue to be guided by justice tbr<br />
Aboriginal and lorres Strait Islander people, the need for w~ orkable land<br />
managcement, and protection of' thc national economic interest.<br />
