For most Australians involved in this special day of remembrance, ANZAC Day evokes a mixed range of memories including pride, suffering, courage, loss, sadness, mateship, loneliness, teamwork, horror and family. </p>
<p>While the original ANZACs are now few in number, they and their mates have collectively become Australian legends. </p>
<p>This day belongs to them and those who served our nation in ways in which we all hope will never be necessary again. It is also a day when all of us can honour those who paid the greatest sacrifice of all and a day to pay tribute to those who fought and returned. ANZAC Day ensures that they and all of their comrades will never be forgotten. </p>
<p>As well as a day of national remembrance it is also one when younger generations can reflect with pride on how lucky we are to be Australian and how important it is for us to focus on the things which unite us rather than dwell on those things which could foster division. </p>
<p>It is particularly gratifying that some vestige of cynicism over ANZAC Day a generation ago appears to have evaporated with young Australians taking more interest than ever in ANZAC Day and what it means for our national identity. </p>
<p>The new Federal Government is to take action, as promised, to protect our great national symbol, the Australian Flag. </p>
<p>Legislation will be introduced early in the life of the new Parliament, which resumes on Tuesday, to ensure that the Australian Flag cannot be changed without the approval of all of the Australian people voting at a referendum or plebiscite. </p>
<p>This will mean that no politician, no political party and no special interest group will be able to tamper with the design of our flag. </p>
<p>It also means that as thousands of young children line the streets of cities and country towns tomorrow waving our flag, all Australians can be assured that no one will be able to change our national symbol without the Nation's consent.</p>
<p>I gave this firm commitment to the Australian people during the election campaign and I am acting promptly to deliver on this promise. </p>
<p>25 April 1996 </p>
