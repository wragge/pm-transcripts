    <content><![CDATA[<p>Sydney</p>
<p>Australia has lost one of the iconic voices of sport with the passing today of Tony Greig.</p>
<p>A former English cricket captain, Tony Greig went on to become an enduring voice on television as a cricket commentator.</p>
<p>Greig was a wonderful example of someone who came to Australia from somewhere else in the world and embraced his adopted country as his own.</p>
<p>As a superb all-rounder, ambitious national captain and authoritative commentator over the best part of half a century, Greig's standing in the game is matched by very few others.</p>
<p>Most Australians would be deeply familiar with Greig the commentator, in particular his unique brand of colourful game-calling and entertaining banter with his Channel Nine colleagues.</p>
<p>His life in cricket wasn't always without controversy, but no one could doubt his passion and commitment to the sport he loved.</p>
<p>Tony Greig devoted every ounce of his professional life to cricket, and the sport is much greater for his enormous contribution.</p>
<p>Cricket has lost a giant today, but we're better as a sporting country for the life of Tony Greig.</p>
<p>The thoughts of the nation are with his wife Vivian and his children Mark, Sam, Beau and Tom as they grieve the loss of their husband and father.</p>
