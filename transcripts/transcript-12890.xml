<p>Well Mr Chairman, can I first of all thank the Vice President for the clarity of his message, the leadership that his government and his administration has given to the world, particularly over the last nine months, and in this your nation';s capital, Mr Vice President, can I say I know on behalf of everybody here that there is a strong sense of commitment and support to the administration and to the people of the United States. And there is a great sense of admiration regarding President Bush and you yourself in the leadership that you have given to the world';s response to the monstrosity of the 11th September last year. You have our strong support and the deep commitment of like-minded countries and governments all around the world.</p>
