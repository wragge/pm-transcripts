JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON Pd KEATING MP,<br />
AND THE TREASURER, THE HON RALPH WILLIS MP<br />
COMMITTEE ON DARWIN REPORT<br />
The Committee on Darwin, chaired by the Hon. Neville Wran AC QC, today<br />
delivered its report to the Commonwealth and Northern Territory<br />
Governments. The Committee reported on the feasibility and potential of<br />
developing Darwin as Australia's northern link to East Asia.<br />
The approach adopted by the Committee is realistic and practical, and will<br />
make a valuable contribution to Darwin's future development.<br />
An important conclusion of the report was that while proximity to East Asia<br />
was an advantage for Darwin, it was not in itself enough to guarantee<br />
success. Nevertheless, the Committee considered that-as Australia's only<br />
capital city in the tropics and with its already extensive commercial and<br />
official links with countries to its near north-Darwin has considerable<br />
potential to further develop as an important centre and that it can continue to<br />
make an important contribution to Australia's overall relationship with the<br />
region. To do this the report says that Darwin must expand its economic base, but<br />
that this will depend primarily on private sector investment. An objective of<br />
policy, therefore, must be for Darwin to convince investors that the city is a<br />
competitive business location. The Committee has made a number of<br />
constructive suggestions to achieve this.<br />
The Committee's 77 recommendations range across a number of portfolio<br />
interests' Obviously these shall need to be considered by relevant Ministers<br />
both in Canberra and Darwin.<br />
Released with the report are the findings of the 18 separate studies<br />
commissioned by the Committee. These stud ies-coveri ng Darwin's<br />
transport infrastructure, health and education services, business services,<br />
tourism, defence, cost of living, business perceptions and development </p>

prospects in East Asia-will provide valuable information for private investors<br />
and government.<br />
Of major interest is the Committee's conclusion that the Alice Springs<br />
Darwin railway may become economically viable early next century.<br />
Importantly, however, the Committee has also recognised that even then<br />
considerable public investment would be required and that funding of this<br />
project would need to be compared with other possible public sector<br />
infrastructure projects.<br />
The Government thanks Mr Wran and his Committee for its hard work in the<br />
preparation of its report.<br />
