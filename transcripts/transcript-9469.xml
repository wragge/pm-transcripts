PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
FISCHER HOLDS THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN CONTEMPT<br />
The Leader of the National Party, Mr Fischer, has displayed contempt for the<br />
institution to which he was elected by inciting demonstrators to disrupt<br />
Question Time today and on Monday.<br />
Remarks by Mr Fischer to timber industry protesters this morning, as reported<br />
on ABC radio, are particularly unfortunate and irresponsible.<br />
His provocative remarks are also hypocritical, coming from such a<br />
conservative political leader. He recently feigned great attachment to the<br />
traditions of the Parliament by opposing a decision to end the wearing of wigs<br />
by the Clerks. Now he shows complete contempt for the more important<br />
traditions of the Parliament by urging members of the public to disrupt<br />
proceedings. Mr Fischer should apologise to the Parliament.<br />
