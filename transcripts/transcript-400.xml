196l FEDERAL ELECTION<br />
OPENING SPEECH<br />
PART II<br />
by<br />
THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOHN McEWEN </p>
<p>P. ART I I<br />
EMBARGOED: DO NOT BROADCAST OR PUBLISH BEFORE:<br />
8 MONDAY,. 20th NOVEMBER, 1961.<br />
I have earlier outlined the major policies for<br />
which we stand the policies for which our Government and the<br />
Country Party stand., These policies we will pursue vigorously<br />
in the future as we have in the past.<br />
As I have said previously the record of more than<br />
a decade of our administration of this country's affairs is, I<br />
believe, an impressive one. It's a period in which we have paid<br />
full regard to the overall needs of the nation. Of course, nothing<br />
is more basic to the development of the Australian nation than<br />
the safeguarding of the interests of the primary industries. Nothing<br />
is more fundamental to the build-up of our population than the<br />
safeguarding of the interests of the manufacturing industries.<br />
And we have had both clearly in mind.<br />
In regard to the primary industries we have been<br />
aware that there'is a problem of costs producing in a fairly high<br />
cost country like this and selling in competition with the outside<br />
world. And the consciousness of that problem, inherent for<br />
primary industry in Australia, is part of the explanation of the<br />
economic policies of last year.<br />
Primarily they were policies designed to arrest<br />
inflation. There was in mind, the necessity to see that there<br />
wasn't a continous internal spiralling upwards of costs, making the<br />
competitive position of primary industries intolerable. In the<br />
bank credit'squeeze, we had a curtailment of credit, but a<br />
reservation that credit was not to be curtailed by banks, to<br />
export industries. / 2. </p>
<p>2-<br />
We had a lift in the interest rate, but again<br />
a direction to the banks that the interest rate was not to be<br />
raised in the case of primary export industry. Here is the<br />
awareness of the Government, and I think it fair to say here<br />
comes out thie consciousness on the part of the Country Party<br />
of its specialised role in this scene.<br />
Taking the industries one by one we have policies.<br />
Wie believe that our fellow Australians, for what<br />
Sthey buy and consume at home, ought to pay a fair Australian<br />
price, not the open world price which is often a depressed one.<br />
So in industry after industry we have the concept of a home price.<br />
Where itts necessary, we have a protective tariff for primary<br />
industries, just as wve have a tariff to protect secondary<br />
industries. Overall we are wanting all the time to sustain the<br />
that the Government isn't the enemy of the people, the<br />
Government is the partner of the people.<br />
So in these primary industry arrangements vwe<br />
constantly work as a government in consultation with the industry<br />
concerned. In wool we have worked all the time that way, for<br />
example, for the protection of the auction system 10 or 12 years<br />
ago, or again in negotiation of the Japanese Trade Treaty, or<br />
an endeavour to get the duties down on American wool.<br />
If it is a problem of the costs of woolgrovwingq<br />
or research to step up the efficiency of wool-groUing; if<br />
there's a discussion about reserve price plan all the time,<br />
we are working, not in insulation from the industry, but in<br />
close consultation, and I believe with great and profitable results. </p>
<p>-3<br />
The Japanese Trade Treaty I am sure has put an<br />
enormous amount of money into the pockets of Australian woolgrowers.<br />
I've said, and I believe itt true, that the strength<br />
of Japanese competition has added as much as œ C50 M. to the value<br />
of the Australian clip in one season. That's w--hat has gone into<br />
the pockets ef wool growers in one eeason from the transformation<br />
of the Japanese from modest buyers into the biggest buyers in<br />
the world of our wool.<br />
Now we have the Woil Enquiry set up, and as soon as<br />
the result of the Wool Enquiry is out, we will go into consultation<br />
with the industry to decide what is the best thing for the<br />
Government to do, what the industry wants, to protect the<br />
future of this great industry,<br />
And similarly, but differently, we've worked in<br />
consultation with the wheat industry to establish a stabilisation<br />
plan a home price; to discuss the overseas marketing arrangements<br />
in wheat the International Wheat Agreement; the United Kingdom<br />
Trade Treaty under which we have obliged the United Kingdom to<br />
buy 28 million bushels of our wheat ayear and the Japanese<br />
Treaty similarly. And so on, selling wheat or flour around the<br />
world. What I now say is that as this present great stabilisation<br />
plan draws to a close, we will in adequate time beforehand, go<br />
into intimate discussion with the wheat industry, and the State<br />
Governments, who are principals in the stabilisation scheme<br />
and from those discussions, in this atmosphere of partnership,<br />
we will work out with the industry the details of the stabilisation<br />
plan to replace the present one. / 4. </p>
<p>-4<br />
In dairying the story is again as I say, th<br />
sam but different in detail. Home price for butter and cheese,<br />
constant overseas negotiations to safeguard the sale of our<br />
dairy products overseas; support for the home market, encouraging<br />
bigger consumption by subsidising the cost of butter and cheese<br />
t4 the Australian consumier To stabilise this great industry and<br />
to keep prices down to consumers here we have provided œ-180<br />
million over 12 years.<br />
Here's an industry that in certain areas has real<br />
problems. We will work closely with it and vie will replace the<br />
present dairy stabilisation plan, for another period with a plan<br />
that will have been worked out with the industry itself and the<br />
State Governments. And with the sua industry in Queensland again<br />
the same kind of approach; a fair home price for sugar, negotiations<br />
overseas to keep wol prices stable; special negotiations to<br />
sell to the British, our biggest buyers; preferential sales to<br />
Canada; entry to the high priced American market; sales to the<br />
Japanese our third biggest buyer since the Trade Treaty all<br />
the time negotiations for the sugar industry, to see that we are<br />
acting to support this great industry along lines that the<br />
industry wants. And in accordance with our Counitry Party and<br />
our Government's policy all the time working with the sugar<br />
industry. And for meat take the Long Term Meat Agreement<br />
which has been of very high value to the beef industry. Not<br />
only have we distributed œ 9qj M. collected from the British<br />
Treasury under it, but the market price at auction has been </p>
<p>sustained. I said a couple of years ago that the value of<br />
beef herds in Queensland was, I was quite sure, œ C50 M. higher<br />
than it would have been without the Long Term Meat Agreement.<br />
Then when the chance emerged for the first time for us to break<br />
into the high-priced American market with manufacturing beef,<br />
that was negotiated. We negotiated sufficient flexibility within the<br />
United Kingdom Agreement to enable entry into the United States<br />
market. Everyone knows that the boom in values of beef which<br />
followed, was not only enjoyed by the beef producers, but<br />
benefited to a tremendous extent the dairy farmers, by getting<br />
them a high price for their cull cattle and to that extent,<br />
lifting the efficiency of the dairying industry.<br />
Industry after industry has received consideration.<br />
The cane fruit industry, here in this great<br />
irrigation area, and the M. I. A. and dowm the Murray in South<br />
Australia~ is very efficient both in the orchard and in the<br />
cannery. It has a magnificent record as an exporter and<br />
employer of labour. We wish to continue satisfactory arrangements<br />
with the sugar industry, which contribute to price stability for<br />
canned fruit growers. We will continue support for the sale of<br />
its products overseas to preserve the stability of this great<br />
industry. In a different but quite effective manner the<br />
dried vine fruit industry has been supported by negotiated<br />
arrangements at home and overseas. Ple are determined to preserve<br />
the stability of this great industry which has a special<br />
importance because entire communities are built around it. / 6.<br />
7-</p>
<p>6<br />
We are not without troubles in some of the<br />
industries. Take the tobacco industry as an example. Here<br />
is one that wie found, flat on its face in 1949 and we lifted it<br />
by policies to a level of prosperity greater than that I think<br />
enjoyed by any other primary industry; this produced an amazing<br />
expansion 50% increase each year in the quantity produced in<br />
recent years, and now unhappily there is trouble in the industry.<br />
I am not going to devote myself in this speech<br />
to details of tobacco. I shall speak again specially about<br />
O this industry. Recently when the industry asked us to help them<br />
in setting up a Committee of Inquiry we immediately acceded and<br />
provided assistance, financial and other;! ise, to enable the<br />
Tobacco Industry's own leaders to make their investigations of<br />
the industry's problems, present and future.<br />
I pledge that we will not let up, either Country<br />
Party or Government, until the tobacco industry is restored to<br />
a position of stability and progress once again.<br />
Some Labor Party spokesmen are today trying to<br />
secure the political support of tobacco growers with rash promises.<br />
I know that all groviers who have been in the industry since<br />
Labor was last in power will remember the peasant level to which<br />
growers had been reduced by 1949, after 8 years of Labor<br />
responsibility for the tobacco growers.<br />
And, of course, there are other primary industries<br />
that I haven't the tima to talk about now in detail but the<br />
Country Party and our Government will work in co-operation with<br />
every primary industry to ensure profitable stability. / 76 </p>
<p>I have been speaking of marketing aspect.%<br />
There is alsn the aspect that has loomed high in our minds of<br />
aiding in the efficiency of production. Here, no Government<br />
has a record comparable with ours in the outpouring of millions<br />
of pounds of money for research and for Extension Services.<br />
This is our Policy. We have provided millions for research in respect<br />
of wool, millions for research and Extension Services for<br />
dairying, and enormous sums for tobacco.<br />
Now, in more recent time, all of the major primary<br />
industries, practically without exception, have come to accept<br />
the idea that a Government such as ours in not an organisation<br />
to hate or to fear or to doubt, but one to work with.<br />
So, industry after industry has come to us and<br />
said it would like to con-tribute something to this great work of<br />
research and Extension and market development. Industry after<br />
industry has asked the Government to pass a law to impose a levy<br />
so that everybody engaged in dairying, or wool or wheat growing,<br />
or w;. hatever it is, should contribute equally his share towards<br />
this valuable research, production and marketing work.<br />
Out of these approaches by the various industries<br />
this idea of partnership betaeen Government and Industry which<br />
I have been preaching for years has now been taking firm shape.<br />
At the request of the variou-s<br />
Now, all industries are making a contribution by levy.! industries vie<br />
have legislated for a levy on wool; on wheat -1d. a bushel;<br />
on dairy produce; on beef ( sugar levies itself) on tobaccos<br />
on the canning fruit industry for promotion purposes; on the<br />
wine industry all are now contributing in a partnership<br />
with the Government, with the Government always also putting in<br />
its balancing share of money. / 8. </p>
<p>-8<br />
So gigantic research activities are proceeding with<br />
the industry concerned entitled to take a part in directing the<br />
activity. The results of research are going out through<br />
Extension Services, mostly through the agency of State Governments,<br />
to get the results of research onto the farm. Market promotion<br />
is going ahead at the same time.<br />
So we have recognized the problem of costs at home.<br />
VWe have dealt with price on the home market, with stabilisation<br />
schemes, research, Extension Services, promotion, that kind of<br />
thing, always developing the reality of partnership bet,.-een<br />
Government and industry.<br />
But there are aids to industry primary industry<br />
of a more general kind.<br />
I have already spoken of last year's so-called credit<br />
squeeze, where our policy said that in respect of export industries<br />
alone, there was to be no restriction of bank credit, and no<br />
increased interest rates.<br />
The Develop~ ment Bank, of course, emerges from the<br />
old Country Party request of quite many years ago for a Mortgage Bank.<br />
Now we have a Development Bank with, as I have said a little<br />
earlier, capital and other funds that give it a lending capacity<br />
of about fœ' 5 M. at the present time.<br />
The rest of the problem of primary industry is, of<br />
course, in the field of export promotion the right to sell; the<br />
negotiation by the M, 1inister for Trade of the right to get into an<br />
overseas market and of the terms upon which we get in; then the<br />
Trade Commissioner Service to aid selling.<br />
Trade Publicity in the United Kingdom is under the<br />
direction of a Committee in London which includes representatives<br />
of the Industries whose products are being sold, merchants and<br />
Commonwealth officials. The Export Payments Insurance Corporation can insure<br />
Export transactions which cannot be commercially insured. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
We aided the export industries in freight negotiating<br />
with the shipping co mpanies. Since 1956 the Export industries<br />
wanted to do it themselves. So we have put up money to help them<br />
to have the strongest organisation to enable them to put their case<br />
to the shipping companies,<br />
Quite recently I have announced that the Government<br />
has negotiated the commencement of two new shipping services to<br />
South America, and to get them going we are for a period accepting<br />
some financial liability.<br />
This work for export continues all the time. The<br />
Country Party and our Government believe that the great primary<br />
export industries are entitled to the support of Government and<br />
O that we want the job of export to be regarded as a partnership<br />
venture in which we help.<br />
Now there is overshadowing us this enormous problem<br />
of the European Common Market.<br />
I am going to make that the subject of quite separate<br />
and specialised speeches to analyse it.<br />
Of course, I am involved as the Minister for Trade,<br />
in trying to safeguard our trading interests. What I say here in<br />
* broad terms is that the whole resources of government w., ill be<br />
devoted to safeguarding the interests of the Australian export<br />
industries as the United Kingdom negotiates to join the Common<br />
Market. We will not accept it that any single Australian<br />
industry is expendable as a price for the preservation of other<br />
industries. All will have our best efforts of protection, and<br />
if any should unhappily be grievously harmed then I pledge that<br />
we will stand by industries should they be so harmed.<br />
So much for the general field of primary industry.<br />
I shall make special speeches in respect of manufacturing industry<br />
but let me say here that as in the case of primary industry,<br />
manufacturing industry in our opinion, is entitled to protection<br />
in the home market. </p>
<p>10<br />
That's our concept whether it be primary or<br />
secondary industry. Again, whatever policy ought to be made -on time to<br />
time, we want to emerge from relations of partnership between the<br />
manufacturing industries and the Government and we have set up<br />
organisations as a point of contact there.<br />
As we are reaching out now, to put it to manufacturing<br />
industry that national need requires them to engage more in export,<br />
I am making it quite clear that I don't believe that manufacturing<br />
industry will be able to export unless given a firm grip on the<br />
home market. That's the only place where we can put our ovm price<br />
put a fair price. To be strong at home, gives a strength to<br />
export, whether it be a farm. or factory product.<br />
The Country Party believes in this. I have<br />
illustrated it in wh-at and dairying and sugar and all these other<br />
thing7s. There are quite a number of primary industries that<br />
actually depend upon tariff protection.<br />
There is no tension today between the Country Party<br />
or the primary industries and the manufacturers. It is a matter<br />
S of historical fact that it was I, the Leader of the Country Party,<br />
who came up with the idea of supr lementing the Tariff Board<br />
S system with the concept of temporary duties, an arrangement under<br />
which, with only a 30-day inquiry, an industry which could<br />
demonstrate that it was in real trouble from import competition,<br />
could get a quick and adequate protection. Quite a number of<br />
industries have benefited from that, including the Bruck Hills<br />
across in Wangaratta. But here basic Government policy is at stake. I have<br />
said again and again that there is nothing that we count more<br />
important in this development of Australia than that we build up<br />
our population. Ten million isn't safe in a Continent like this.<br />
We want 20 million. 1.7e want 30 million. / lie </p>
<p>And we know perfectly well that we can't get tens<br />
of millions on farms in Australia. Only peasant countries provide<br />
a big proportion of population on farms. Ours is a high living<br />
standard country. Where we will get the millions, tens of millions,<br />
in this country is in and around great manufacturing industries.<br />
It would be a contradication of all that I say and of all that we<br />
as a Country Party and a Government stand for, if I, and the<br />
Government, were not to give adequate Protection to economic and<br />
efficient manufacturing industry.<br />
Again, I pledge the wrord of the Government to see to<br />
it that this is maintained.<br />
As to the general effectiveness of our support for<br />
manufacturing industry, there can be no doubt about that, for any<br />
person who is willing to look at the facts.<br />
In the last 12 years vwe have added 41% more factories.<br />
Nowhere else has industrial expansion been faster.<br />
The value of factory production today is 3-2t1i mes what it was when<br />
we came into office 12 years ago.<br />
The jobs in Australia are mostly jobs in or around<br />
factories and the service industries. There are -J million more<br />
O jobs in Australia today than there were when you elected us to<br />
office 12 years ago.<br />
This is the evidence that our Policy of building the<br />
population of Australia, and building it with strong primary<br />
industry, and a strong and expanding secondary industry, is net a<br />
matter of words; it is now a matter of history. The results are<br />
there to be seen and I have complete confidence that wie will<br />
continue these policies of expansion just as effectively for the<br />
future as we have done in the past.<br />
That's what 1Mr. Menzies and I devote ourselves to.<br />
Continuous development of A1ustralia is the high<br />
ambition of my Australian Country Party. WUe bring to the<br />
Parliament at Canberra a concentration on the problems of the<br />
great primary industries of their export problems, and an / 12. </p>
<p>12<br />
awareness of their problems when costs rise against them at home.<br />
At the same time we wvili maintain an equal consciousness that all<br />
we plan for the great future of Australia will be at risk if<br />
we don't continue to build the population of this country by<br />
supporting manufacturing industry, so that we can sustain our<br />
migration programme and grow as we have grown in the last 12 years<br />
from less than 8 million people to 1021 million today.<br />
Give us another ten years a nd our population will<br />
be lifted to 13 million people on tho policies that we propound.<br />
And don't forget that it is no good just voting the<br />
Government back to office in the House of Representatives<br />
we have got to have a majority in the Senate also.<br />
And so in every State I put it very high in my appeal<br />
that people shall not only vote for but work for the Government<br />
Senate candidates. Give us the powor and we will continue to do the job<br />
for this country.<br />
