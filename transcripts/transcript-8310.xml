PRIME MINISTER]<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME NIKISTER<br />
LAUNCHING THE CENTENARY HISTORY OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY<br />
" THE LIGHT ON THE HILL"<br />
COLLINGIIOOD, 21 JUNE 1992.<br />
Friends It's not surprising that in this Centenary Year, we are<br />
hearing a great deal about Labor traditions.<br />
So I might begin by pointing out that the publication of<br />
this history itself celebrates one of the most remarkable,<br />
and one of the very oldest of all Labor traditions the<br />
Labor Party-Is deep sense of history, and of its place in<br />
Australian history.<br />
It has been said truly that the Labor Party was born with a<br />
sense of history.<br />
And I give you a remarkable proof of that.<br />
In 1892 within a year of the Party's official foundationtwo<br />
of the founding members, Thomas Roydhouse and<br />
Robert Taperell wrote a book and published it in Sydney.<br />
They called it The L~ abor Party in New South Walpq A<br />
History cdL-itz-Foundation and Legislative Career.<br />
That was just a year after the election of the first Labor<br />
members the 35 who formed the world's first parliamentary<br />
Labor Party, exactly one hundred years ago this mouth.<br />
Roydhouse and Taperell record the very difficult decisions<br />
the Party had to make, not only in working out its role<br />
within the established parliamentary system, but about the<br />
rules governing the relationship between the parliamentary<br />
party, the party membership the rank and file outside<br />
and the union movement which had brought the political party<br />
into being. And really, within that first year, they had<br />
established the essential structures which were to make the<br />
Party unique, and which were so essential to its survival<br />
for the next decade and indeed for the next century.<br />
But the point I want to make, in the context of this<br />
occasion today, is this: </p>
<p>2.<br />
What other political party not just in Australia, but<br />
anywhere within a year of its formation, has had the<br />
confidence in its future, the certainty about its destiny,<br />
to publish an account of its origins and call it<br />
' history'?<br />
So Doctor McMullin joins a select band, and his book takes<br />
its place in a long tradition.<br />
And the important thing is this:<br />
With us of the Australian Labor Party, our sense of history<br />
is a deep source of strength for our future. From our pride<br />
in our past, we draw confidence for the future.<br />
The great thing about understanding our history is that it<br />
enables us to put the pre-occupations of the present into<br />
perspective. And the discerning reader of Ross McMullin's pages will come<br />
to realise that events which may seem novel, unprecedented,<br />
even unintelligible in the day-to-day hurly-burly of<br />
politics, are in fact part of an ongoing story a volatile,<br />
turbulent story certainly but destined to become just a<br />
part of the great rolling stream of Australian history.<br />
In a recent book, The Lessons of History, a leading British<br />
historian Sir Michael Howard, writes:<br />
The past is infinitely various, an inexhaustible<br />
storehouse of events from which we can prove anything,<br />
or its contrary.<br />
But Howard also writes:<br />
Without history we are groping in total darkness.<br />
We of the Labor Party not only have a history but are strong<br />
enough to have it recorded, in critical and sometimes even<br />
in unflattering terms.<br />
And we are strong enough to learn its lessons, not least<br />
from our mistakes and even our follies.<br />
In this, as in so much else, I invite the contrast with the<br />
other forces, the anti-labor forces, in Australian political<br />
history. Now I don't go quite as far as to say that our opponents are<br />
like the mule without pride of ancestry or hope of<br />
posterity. I simply say: where is the evidence that they understand or<br />
ever learn the lessons of their own history?<br />
My friends, I believe our great and beloved historian<br />
Manning Clark has best identified the purpose of the writing<br />
of Australian history. It is, he said, to try to explain<br />
who we are and how we came to be who we are. </p>
<p>That, of course, is primarily a task for Australians<br />
ourselves. But it is often instructive to get the outside view.<br />
And from the very early years, the Australian Labor Party<br />
drew the interest of writers from overseas Albert Metin's<br />
SorIilliam Wijthout DontrIne in 1901 for example.<br />
In the light: of the epic events now occurring in Eastern<br />
Europe and in the light of some of the comments critics of<br />
the Labor Party make today it is worth noting what one<br />
noted commentator had to say in 1914.<br />
I refer to none other than Lenin himself.<br />
And he wrote! in 1914:<br />
The leaders of the Australian Labor Party are trade<br />
union cofficials" an element which is everywhere most<br />
moderat~ e and capital serving. The liberals in Europe<br />
and in Russia who try to teach the people the<br />
needlessness of class war by the example of Australia<br />
only deceive themselves and others.<br />
Three quarters of a century on, at this time of Labor's<br />
Centenary, in the week in which the citizens of Leningrad<br />
have voted to rename their city St Petersburg, I am<br />
perfectly prepared to let Lenin's criticism stand or fall by<br />
the judgement of history.<br />
But the truth is, my friends, that Lenin's critique did<br />
discern the two key elements in the nature, character and<br />
purpose of the Australian Labor Party the two mainstays of<br />
Labor continuity and Labor's cause:<br />
the solidarity of political and industrial Labor;<br />
and the commitment to parliamentary democracy.<br />
Lenin condemned them. We celebrate them.<br />
Friends, It has been for me, now for more than thirty years, a<br />
privilege beyond words to represent, in whatever way I have<br />
been able to do, those two great strands which bind the<br />
Labor cause -together.<br />
No Australian has ever owed more to this great Movement,<br />
this unique Australian institution, than I do. </p>
<p>If I have been able to achieve anything in public life, it<br />
is because of those two commitments the double commitment<br />
our founders made one hundred years ago the commitment to<br />
advance the cause of the working men and women of Australia<br />
through the means of parliamentary democracy. That is the<br />
banner they unfurled one hundred years ago. That is the<br />
banner we hold high today, under which we will take<br />
Australia into the 21st century.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I congratulate all involved in this publication.<br />
I have no doubt that Ross McMullin found his most daunting<br />
challenge in trying to produce some order from the sheer<br />
mass of material available. To marshal into a coherent,<br />
readable whole what is practically seven accounts, spanning<br />
a continent as well as a century, is a splendid feat of<br />
organisation. I congratulate the publishers Oxford Press on this very<br />
handsome volume.<br />
I congratulate the Federal Executive for commissioning the<br />
work and the Federal Secretariat for supporting it, while as<br />
Ross acknowledges, always respecting his complete<br />
independence. As I have written for the dustjacket:<br />
This important and provocative book presents the<br />
tremendous and turbulent history of the Australian<br />
Labor Party warts and all. Its publication itself<br />
demonstrates the strength of a Party and a Movement<br />
courageous enough to commission an untrammelled account<br />
of its failures and faults, as well as its immense<br />
achievements. </p>
