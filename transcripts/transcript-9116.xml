PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THlE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
NORTHERN TERRITORY FOOTBALL LEAGUE<br />
ABORIGINAL ALL-STARS v COLLINGWOOD BALL<br />
As the football experts are prone to say there's a lot<br />
hanging on this game tomorrow.<br />
But it's not so much on who wins or loses. Both sides,<br />
it seems to me, are already the winners simply for<br />
playing the game.<br />
It also seems to me that they are sides with something<br />
very basic in common: I mean they both know what it is to<br />
do it hard in the world.<br />
Collingwood, the greatest sporting club in Australia,<br />
grew up In a poor working class area of Melbourne. They<br />
were social underdogs who became sporting top dogs.<br />
Collingwood succeeded because it tapped the spirit of<br />
people whose circumstances might easily have drained the<br />
spirit from them.<br />
The Collingwood Football Club gave them a collective<br />
strength. It gave them the means by which they could know<br />
success. The spirit was there it just needed a vehicle<br />
for its expression.<br />
The All Stars have much in common with this story. They<br />
have been drawn from the ranks of those Australians who<br />
have been denied a lot of the good things in Australian<br />
life and subjected to a lot of the worst things.<br />
They too might easily have given in to their<br />
ci rcumstances.<br />
But the All Stars like the teams in the Territory from<br />
which many of their players are drawn are proof of<br />
their willingness to overcome the odds. The team is an<br />
expression of the spirit and the potential of Aboriginal<br />
Australia. Like Collingwood, the spirit is there it only needs the<br />
vehicle for its expression. </p>
<p>I will come back to the football in a moment.<br />
And before you murmur what would this character from<br />
Bankstown and Canberra know about Australian Rules? I<br />
have to remind you that in Miarch last year, aliost alone<br />
among the tipsters, I said that the winner of the 1993<br />
Browniow Medal would be Gavan Wanganeen.<br />
And Kicky Winmar was my second tip.<br />
Nicky Winmar's gesture of defiance at Collingwood is<br />
destined to be legendary. In my view it was a great<br />
gesture. Yet there were other gestures in last year's football<br />
season which were, in a sense, just as significant<br />
because they spoke of success.<br />
There was Gavan Wanganeen with the Brownlow Medal in his<br />
hand. There was Michael Long with the Norm Smith medaland<br />
the Premiership Cup above his head.<br />
And there was the gesture of Allan McAlister coming to<br />
the Territory to meet the Aboriginal community, to talk,<br />
to learn, to come to a new understanding.<br />
Tomorrow's match builds on all those events.<br />
And let me say now there will be other winners to come<br />
out of this weekend's events.<br />
Pre-eminent among them will be the City of Darwin.<br />
Hundreds of thousands of Australians will be watching<br />
this historic match. I am sure it will not fail to enter<br />
the minds of most of them that Darwin was the place which<br />
had the national vis4on and character to make it happen.<br />
Darwin and its people.<br />
Standing here in a dinner suit on a night like this I<br />
realise that among the many attractions of Darwin must be<br />
the climate.<br />
It is a wonderful climate for politics. I mean the sort<br />
of climate in which no politician would dare to make a<br />
long speech.<br />
Most of you will know, I hope, that I am a politician who<br />
is inclined to take a national view. I tend to think of<br />
Australia as one nation.<br />
The details of what I mean by that would take too long to<br />
describe at a ball in tropical heat but in short it<br />
means that whatever the difference in geography and<br />
experience, or colour, or creed whatever the degree of<br />
our attachment to the place in which we live we are all </p>
<p>Australians, and think of ourselves as Australians, and<br />
do better in the world and by each other when we work<br />
with a common national purpose.<br />
That means, among other things, that while the place I<br />
come from is very different to Darwin, Darwin's<br />
experience is part of mine. When Darwin succeeds we all<br />
share in that success. When Darwin's spirit rises so<br />
does the spirit of Australia.<br />
And Darwin's spirit is most definitely rising.<br />
This has always been a frontier town but never more so<br />
than now. It Is in the forefront of the great change<br />
which is taking place in Australia.<br />
It is our gateway to Asia, a place with a vital role to<br />
play in 6ofeonomic development, and in our cultural and<br />
social development. Darwin, after all, has always been<br />
multicultural, it has always had multiracial sport it<br />
has set the example for the rest 6f7AUitrala.<br />
As I said, Australia is undergoing a profound change: in<br />
the way we do things, in the direction of our thinking,<br />
in the way we imagine ourselves and our role in the<br />
world. They say you can't write history until you are far enough<br />
away to see the shape of events. Up close, in the midst<br />
of the fray, it's all a bit of a blur.<br />
But in the last twelve months I reckon we've all felt it.<br />
You could sense the change in the last year or so as if<br />
the tide had imperceptibly turned and was now running<br />
our way.<br />
Just now we are starting to see evidence of it in the<br />
figures. You can see it on the score-board.<br />
it actually is a bit like a football match There is<br />
that moment when you feel the game change.<br />
And I truly believe the game has changed between black<br />
and white Australia.<br />
This game is evidence of it. In that sense the score is<br />
already on the board.<br />
It's hard to say precisely what the turning point was.<br />
I know that Kevin Sheedy and the Essendon Football Club<br />
played a role wffith theifr recruiting caiimpigns and their<br />
regular pre-season games in Darwin and last year's<br />
Premiership was proof that there was wisdom as well as<br />
justice in the policy. </p>
<p>I think they deserve enormous credit for their<br />
initiative.<br />
And of course there is one other person who deserves a<br />
lot of credit NickyWinmar.<br />
Think of what one gesture of defiance triggered a<br />
national debate on racism in sport and a new recognition<br />
of -th&amp; -role Aboriginals play -in Australian sport.<br />
Not to mention a horrible succession of mysterious<br />
Coll1ingwood defeats.<br />
Along the way, things also went wrong for Nicky and St<br />
Kilda; Allan McAlister came to the Northern Territory;<br />
Essendon, with a sizeable crew of Aboriginal players, won<br />
the premiership; Michael Long won the Norm Smith medal;<br />
and my March selection, Gavan Wanganeen, won the<br />
Brownlow. It has all ended up here with this historic match.<br />
And it all happened in the International Year of the<br />
World's Indigenous People and the year of Mabo.<br />
So the game, as I said, has changed.<br />
There is a change in mood and awareness.<br />
And with the Mabo decision there is a change in law and<br />
let me tell you that de-sjpite all the arguments, all the<br />
understandable anxiety, all the negotiation which is<br />
still to take place, the Mabo legislation puts right an<br />
historic wrong and there is no going back on that.<br />
I am very much aware of how far there is to go.<br />
I am also aware that very often the sentiments expressed<br />
by politicians seem out of touch with social and economic<br />
reality out of touch with the complexities of life as<br />
it is really lived in Australia.<br />
It is our duty to get in touch with those realities and<br />
fashion policies accordingly. Ultimately the trick is<br />
always to put the right people and the right money in the<br />
right places.<br />
But it ig also necessary to state the principles: not<br />
because one ever believes that they can be translated<br />
into a perfect reality, but because they are necessary<br />
values and ambitions for a nation to live by.<br />
They are the nation's articles of faith, the code we live<br />
by. In some countries they are write into<br />
constitutions and bills of rights: here they are<br />
unwritten, but they are just as powerful. </p>
<p>eft-<br />
1 am talking about ideas like a fair go for all, support<br />
for the underdog, tolerance of difference, respect for<br />
those who by their own efforts have succeeded against the<br />
odds. Every one of those principles on which we pride ourselves<br />
declares that racism is abhorrent everywhere, Including<br />
football fields or tennis courts, or athletics tracks.<br />
It is abhorrent to our best traditions and the best<br />
traditions of sport.<br />
I was at a function at the Australian War Memorial during<br />
the week the opening of an exhibition of drawings done<br />
by children in a Jewish ghetto in Poland during the war.<br />
All but a handful of 17,000 children in the ghetto were<br />
killed in the Auschwitz extermination camp.<br />
I mention this only as a background to words which a<br />
survivor of the ghetto used in a speech at the war<br />
memorial to summarise, he said what an extraordinary<br />
gift the tolerance and freedom and democracy of Australia<br />
had been for refugees like himself.<br />
He also said that democracy and tolerance were more<br />
deeply embedded in the f-abric -of Aus-tralian life than<br />
anywhere else in the world.<br />
His words were very moving. They were a reminder that<br />
those intangible things like tolerance and fairness are<br />
real, especially to people who have been denied them.<br />
It was a reminder of how vital to our national life and<br />
character these values are how jealously we should<br />
defend them.<br />
I would like to think that tomorrow's contest is part of<br />
that defence.<br />
That's why I said at the beginning that, however close<br />
the contest on the field and whoever wins, the teams are<br />
both winners.<br />
I hope and I think we all hope that in due course it<br />
will be seen that they were both playing on the same<br />
side. in fact I think all Australians can be winners from this<br />
weekend's events. if we all want to be. If we all are<br />
prepared to enter into the spirit of it. If we all see<br />
it as a step along the way a highly symbolic step<br />
towards reconciliation between black and white<br />
Australians. I congratulate Tony Shaw and the NTFL, and Allan<br />
McAlister and the Collingwood Football Club for all they<br />
have done. </p>
<p>6<br />
I also want to pay tribute to Maurice Rioli, coach of the<br />
All-Stars, former great player and for years now in the<br />
Northern Territory and throughout Australia a hero and<br />
role model for Aboriginal people.<br />
And finally, let me wish the players the very best of<br />
luck. DARWIN 11 February 1994 </p>
