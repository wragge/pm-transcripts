PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT TUESDAY, 10 JULY 1979<br />
NEWS CONFERENCE IN PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE<br />
ON TELECOM DISPUTE<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The Government this afternoon has surveyed the general industrial<br />
scene, especially as it affects the Government's own employees,<br />
whether in the Public Service or in instrumentalities such<br />
as Telecom, Australia Post, or the Australian National Railways.<br />
In all those areas there are disputes proceeding which are<br />
inconveniencing the public and doing a very great amount of<br />
damage. Especially in Telecom, where the disruption to normal<br />
communication and normal business has been very, very severe over<br />
the last few days.<br />
There was a significant delay in having that matter referred to<br />
the Full Bench, for reasons that we all know and understand.<br />
I have already indicated that we will be legislating in the<br />
Budget Session to make sure that Sir John Moore has power to take<br />
over any particular case if he requires it or if believes it to<br />
be in the national interest. That legislation will be introduced<br />
at the very beginning of the Budget Session.<br />
I am glad . to see that Mr. John Ducker has applauded that particular<br />
move to strenghten the President of the Arbitration Commission.<br />
It is quite clear that the general stand-down procedures, the<br />
general no-work, no-pay provision, in a number of instances is<br />
not a particularly effective weapon. It is not strong enough<br />
when particular trade unions to seek to support their own wage<br />
claims or claims for changes in conditions, with bans and<br />
limitations which cause great difficulty for the public.<br />
Especially in areas of public service employment where there is a need<br />
to continue to supply services to the public.<br />
What the Government has sought to do over recent times, and<br />
throughout its period in office, is to support the arbitration<br />
system, to support the Arbitration Commission.<br />
It is worth noting that equivalent support from the Australian<br />
Council of Trade Unions was sought last Friday and was rejected<br />
by the President of the ACTU. It didn't seem to the Government<br />
to be too much to expect the Australian Council of Trade Unions<br />
to support the general strength of the arbitration machinery<br />
and to exhort their own members and affiliates to respect<br />
arbitration, respect conciliation and not to resort to bans and<br />
limitations which so much damage Australia's reputation. But<br />
that suppott from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, from<br />
Mr. Hawke, was not forthcoming.<br />
The Telecom dispute has gone on far too long. The processes of<br />
arbitration, under a Full Bench and under Commissioner Clarkson<br />
have now begun. The Government has no wish to take actions that<br />
will interfere in that particular process throughout the course Of<br />
the next day or so. But there are limits to the Government's<br />
patience. There is certainly a limit to the community's patience.<br />
There are very real limits to the hardship which the community<br />
can be expected to endure while these bans and limitations continue.<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
Since the-matter is now before arbitration, since the matter<br />
is now being heard by Commissioner Clarkson, it would have<br />
reasonable enough to expect the union concerned to lift the bans,<br />
to lift the limitations, so that normal communications could be<br />
returned in Australia.<br />
If the bans and if the limitations are not off by first thing<br />
on Friday morning, we will be seeking an Executive Council decision<br />
to proclaim the Commonwealth Employees Employment Provisions Act.<br />
That will be proclaimed and proclaimed forthwith if there are<br />
bans and limitations still in place by Friday morning of this week.<br />
Question_ Prime minister, what will that mean? In lay terms, what would<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That greatly strengthens the employing authority, it greatly<br />
strengthens the Public Service Board, and the Government, in relation<br />
to stand-downs, in relation to suspensions. Ultimately, in<br />
relation to dismissals of people who are disrupting essential<br />
services. It applies to Commonwealth employees. It will apply to<br />
statutory instrumentalities of the Commonwealth. It would give<br />
employing authorities a general power which the Government now<br />
believes, in these circumstances, those employing authorities and<br />
the Public Service Board, ought to have.<br />
Question But won't you be risking a massive confrontation with<br />
Public Service unions and the whole union movement?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There has been a massive confrontation caused by the union movement,<br />
caused by the Telecom union, with the whole Australian people over<br />
the last few weeks and days. The Government has been patient.<br />
The Government has been tolerant. Some would say, tolerant in<br />
the extreme.<br />
Question Will this. get Telecom working?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Using a power of this kind obviously cannot guarantee getting<br />
Telecom working on Friday morning, but if a trade union ' is to<br />
cause great inconvenience to the Australian public, if members of<br />
that trade union are not to work to supply services to the people of<br />
Australia as they are employed to do, as they are paid to do<br />
they cannot continue to get paid. They cannot continue to get<br />
supported. They will have to learn that there is a cost to<br />
themselves. If that means for a while that the public could be<br />
without the service and that could be-the result then the<br />
Government accepts that and I believe the public will also accept </p>
<p>3<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
it. I think that in the final result, we would get to a<br />
saner situation. But we cannot allow people to continue to<br />
inconvenience the Australian public virtually at no cost to<br />
themselves. Question Do you intend to implement that legislation immediately on<br />
Friday, if the unions haven't lifted the bans by then.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That would be normal management prerogative and the prerogative<br />
of Government. The powers conferred by that particular act<br />
would be within then the general weaponry available to employing<br />
authorities in industrial disputes.<br />
Question What will you achieve if you stand down the very people, the only<br />
people, that are capable of running telecommunications systems.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
They are not working the system now. It is not working now.<br />
They are taking it out on the people of Australia in support of<br />
a claim that can be heard by arbitration and conciliation. I hope<br />
you are not supporting that kind of action against the interests<br />
of the total Australian community.<br />
Question How long will it run when you do that. How long is it going<br />
to run?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It will run when the union learns that it cannot produce this<br />
kind of action without a cost to themselves. It is as simple<br />
as that.<br />
Question It has been suggested in some newspapers, no doubt wrongly, that<br />
you want this industrial confrontation as an election issue.<br />
dispel that kind of suspicion, will you give us a guarantee<br />
that there will no election this year.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't want any industrial confrontation as an election issue.<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Question will there be an election this year.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That's not something that is going to run.<br />
Question Despite some ( inaud) that have been made by the Federal Government<br />
on previous occasions to get Mr. Bob Hawke to ( inaud) intervene<br />
in this situation, have you consulted with him on this issue.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Mr. Hawke has intervened on one or two other occasions, after<br />
the Government had indicated that it would use this legislation,<br />
or other legislation. It has been after that that the disputes<br />
have been resolved.<br />
Question You've threatened to proclaim this legislation before and you<br />
haven't. Is there any reason this time why the union should<br />
think you would go ahead with your threat.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We hadn't proclaimed it on earlier occasions because the disputes<br />
were over within the time limit given by the Government. But if this<br />
dispute, if the bans and limitations are not over within the time<br />
limit that I have stated, the legislation will be proclaimed, and<br />
let nobody mistake that.<br />
Question Why' not proclaim it in any case, if you are saying you will do<br />
it on Friday, why not have it...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Principally because the Government did not wish to interfere with<br />
the processes before Commissioner Clarkson.<br />
Question<br />
Why not wait until they are concluded.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Because it is fair. enough to let the parties know what the<br />
consequences will be if the bans and limitations continue.<br />
Question-This legislation was passed last year.<br />
Prime Minist-er<br />
Two years ago. </p>
<p>Question<br />
Why didn't the Government proclaim it when it was passed.<br />
What were the reasons for waiting.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Because we thought it would be better unproclaimed at the time.<br />
Question You say, the Government has said in the past, that when unions<br />
take industrial action while matters are before the Arbitration<br />
Commission that that is tantamount of blackmail. Would you accept<br />
the point of view that this type of action now, while this<br />
situation is before the Arbitration Commission, is also tantamount.<br />
to blackmail to the unions.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No I wouldn't. I would say it is tantamount to the Government<br />
taking to itself the powers that are necessary to Government and<br />
to employing authorities, to make sure that the services Governments<br />
must provide to the people of Australia can be supplied to the<br />
people of Australia. Telecom is not owned by the employees.<br />
They are working in that particular organisation to provide a service<br />
to the people of Australia. It is time the people of Australia<br />
were placed first.<br />
Question ( Inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The principle provisions of this legislation are suspension and<br />
stand-downs. Quite plainly, any of the people trained to work<br />
in Telecom are necessary for the operations of Telecom. But at<br />
the same time, their special skills are ones that are appropriate<br />
to the Telecom organisation. So they need Telecom. They need the<br />
jobs that they can get in that particular organisation if they<br />
are to have the kind of remuneration to which they have been used.<br />
I think it is time that the members of this particular union learnt<br />
that they owe some obligations to the people of Australia and they<br />
ought not to use their power in an important instrumentality to<br />
continue to inconvenience and disrupt the business and life and<br />
livelihood of the people of Australia, as they have over the last<br />
few days and weeks.<br />
Question first of the unions you are going to take on?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I would hope that people would be able to learn from a lesson.<br />
./ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Question you will follow on with others?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
If this legislation is proclaimed, well then it is proclaimed<br />
and the powers within it are generally available to Commonwealth<br />
instrumentalities, and the Public Service Board.<br />
Question<br />
Why was the legislation better unproclaimed two years ago<br />
when it was first passed by both Housesof Parliament.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It might still not be proclaimed if the bans and limitations<br />
are*. lf ted.<br />
Question But why was it better unproclaimed?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Because we believed it better-to play it that way.<br />
Question Could you expand on it?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't think there is any need to expand on it at all.<br />
There are powers in this particular legislation which normally<br />
you would prefer not to have to use, but against the background<br />
of the kind of disputes that we have had over recent times<br />
the Government believes that* it needs those very powers.<br />
Question But why is proclamation so crucial?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Because the powers can't be used unless it is proclaimed.<br />
Question If that legislation is proclaimed will you proceed forthwith to<br />
instruct Telecom to stand down all employees that it can~ not<br />
gainfully employ?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There will be no doubt that the powers conferred by the legislation<br />
would be used by Telecom.<br />
Question Forthwithi Prim e minister: Yes. 000<br />
