BEFORE 0030 HOURS FRIDAY, 15TH MAY.<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THlE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR ROBERT MENZIES, KT, CH, QC, MP<br />
I announce that the Governor-General, His<br />
Excellency the Right Honourable Viscount De L'Isle, V. C.,<br />
K. St has received The Queen's<br />
permission to relinquish the office of Governor-General in the Aust.<br />
autumn of 1965. Although his retirement is still some time<br />
away, the Governor-General and I have each felt it to be<br />
desirable that some public indication be given now to His<br />
Excellency's intention to retire, so that, as and when<br />
necessary, he may lay his plans for the future. He will,<br />
subject to his period of leave in the United Kingdom between<br />
S June and August, carry out his full duties as Governor-<br />
General until the time of his retirement.<br />
The Government received the news of His<br />
Excellency's retirement with great regret. It would have<br />
wished, if circumstances had permitted, to arrange an<br />
extension of His Excellency's appointment so that he<br />
might continue for a further period of years with the work<br />
he has so well and with such a high sense of duty carried<br />
out as Governor-General of Australia. His Excellency's<br />
retirement conforms, however, with the understanding which<br />
0 he had with the Government at the time of his appointment,<br />
to the effect that he would be unable to accept office<br />
for a period of more than four years.<br />
Lord De L'Isle came to Australia with his wrife,<br />
the late Viscountess De L'Isle, in mid-1961.<br />
