FOR PRESS. Statement by the Rt. Hon, J. McEwen. Deputy Prime<br />
Minister, Minister for Trade and ind~ ustry, Leader<br />
OF t Australian Uountrv Party, at the Annual<br />
Co erence of the AiustraiÃ± an Uountr ar Queensland,<br />
DROUGHT RELIEF<br />
A concerted effort to make better provision against<br />
the effects of drought was called for today by the Deputy Prime<br />
Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr. J. McEwen.<br />
Mr. McEwen, the Federal Leader of the Australian<br />
Country Party, was addressing the annual conference of the Australian<br />
Country Party, Queensland, at Warwick.<br />
" All Gnvernments and the entire community must shake<br />
off any thought that may exist that droughts are an act of God,<br />
inevitable and quite inescapable, and that tremendous recurring losses<br />
should result from them" he said,<br />
Mr. McEwen recalled the loss of 25 million sheep in<br />
the drought ending in 1945.<br />
He said that the Commonwealth and State Governments<br />
and representatives of farming and pastoral industry organisations<br />
should consider jointly efforts to alleviate the results of drought.<br />
More dams and the provision of adequate transp~ rt,<br />
subsidised if need be by governments, were ingredients of dealing with<br />
drought. The credit institutions of Australia should also have<br />
policies, the will and the resources to contribute to alleviation of<br />
the problem. In addition, Mr. McEwen called on farmers to take the<br />
opportunities offered, particularly in Queensland, for increased<br />
fodder conservation. Queensland, whose total exports per head were<br />
above the national average, was ton important a State to go on<br />
suffering from devastating, widespread droughts, he said.<br />
COMONVEALTH AID<br />
Mr. McEwen said Queensland had been helped by Commonwealth<br />
financial assistance under Section 96 of the Constitution,<br />
" I believe this is a very proper policy for the<br />
Commonwealth to give additional assistance to those States least able<br />
to cater for their own development need,<br />
" I believe this is partimcularly so where the assistance<br />
will increase the capacity for export, This helps not only the State,<br />
but also the national economy at one of its most sensitive points<br />
exchange earnings. " I am sure both the opportunities and the needs of<br />
Queensland in these respects, are great. I am sure the Commonwealth<br />
policies have been of value arid may be expected to continue." </p>

COALITION UNITY<br />
Mr. MeEwen said he associated himself completely with the<br />
remarks by the Queensland Premier, Mr, Nicklin, in opening the<br />
Conference on Tuesday night.<br />
( Mr. Nicklin, ini a zefeceiict tLo the Country Party's<br />
relationships with the Liberal Party in the Government coalition in<br />
Queensland, said, " Wie have to be fully united in principle and purpose,<br />
even though not in name, to retain the Treasury benches and to do a job<br />
of work for Queensland, and I ask supporters of both parties to work to<br />
that end.") Mr. McEwen said current problems of politics, industry and<br />
finance, and particularly the darkening scene to the North, demanded<br />
the highest quality personnel in political organisations and Parliament,<br />
" Any single thing that-puts a strain upon the internal<br />
Ssolidarity of the Australian nation, or in particular, upon the<br />
Wrelationship between the two parties that form the coalition in Queensland<br />
and in the Commonwealth Parliaments, is an act against the national<br />
interest today," he said, CAPITAL INFLOW<br />
Mr. Mc~ ven said later outside the Conference that Australia<br />
had a vital need for greater export effort to meet its foreign exchange-_<br />
problems and reduce its dependence on thn inflow of overseas -capital0<br />
He said Australia's balance of Daymerts position could be<br />
seriously affected by recent actions of the United States and British<br />
4D Governments. The President of the United States had asked U. S. companies<br />
to take measures which could result in reduced flow of investment funds<br />
to Australia. The President had also requested American companies<br />
Woperating in Australia to remit a higher proportion of their profits<br />
back to the U. S. Mr. McEwen said that an inevitablg consequence of<br />
these new policies of the U. S. Administration would be increased<br />
borrowings raised in Australia to finance American companies in<br />
Australia. The Britishl-Government hrtd now.. asked U. K. companies to<br />
take similar action, which must affect British investment in Australia,<br />
Mr. McEwen recalled that two years ago, at the Country<br />
Party Conference at Lakes Entrance, Victoria, he had stressed the need<br />
for Australia to earn more by exports to pay its way internationally<br />
rather than by " selling a bit of the farm" every year,<br />
Mr. McEwen said today the recent changes of policy by the<br />
U. S. and British Governments had suddenly brought home the risk of<br />
becoming too dependent on the regular inflow of overseas capital in<br />
great volume.<br />
acinIn spetko these things no t 10 bemoanthe US. nUK<br />
actoand hep o h~ mfcreated for Austra la bu o s an the<br />
answer is to increase exports," he said.<br />
