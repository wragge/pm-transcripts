We would not be here but for the events of 28 April 1996  -  events that will remain in our nation's memory always.</p>
<p>On that day, we saw unmitigated evil from one man.</p>
<p>And extraordinary courage from another.</p>
<p>I refer, of course, to Walter Mikac, whose wisdom and generosity of spirit has brought us together today.</p>
<p>In some very dark days, Walter came to see that too many children grow up knowing fear in their lives, and that he could do something about it.</p>
<p>In response, the Alannah and Madeline Foundation has given new hope to thousands of children, and will give hope to thousands more in the time ahead.</p>
<p>In the past 15 years, the need for our children to be safe has not changed.</p>
<p>But technology has.</p>
<p>The digital world has changed the landscape of childhood dramatically and forever.</p>
<p>Gone are the days when bullying stopped at the school gate.</p>
<p>The spread of electronic devices means bullies can now follow their victims everywhere and in a sense, technology has run ahead of the systems, rules and ethics required to manage the situation.</p>
<p>That is where eSmart has such value.</p>
<p>Because we want children to be as safe in the cyber world as they are, or should be, in the physical world.</p>
<p>I'm delighted that the Australian Government invested $3 million in support of the pilot program, which is now available to public schools in Queensland and Victoria.</p>
<p>I congratulate the Foundation on this result, and I am deeply honoured to be your National Patron.</p>
<p>I'm also deeply honoured that Her Royal Highness has agreed to be International Patron.</p>
<p>I spoke at Parliament House earlier this week of the life of service that Mary and Frederick have embraced.</p>
<p>Their support of the Foundation shows that spirit of dedication in abundance.</p>
<p>The support of the Crown Prince Couple means that more children will be able to enjoy their childhood free from harm.</p>
<p>It was something Alannah and Madeline never got to do.</p>
<p>But it's a gift we can at least give the children of today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>I know it is a cause dear to the heart of Crown Princess Mary.</p>
<p>She is a gracious leader and an inspirational friend.</p>
<p>And it is my very great privilege to welcome her to speak with us today. </p>
