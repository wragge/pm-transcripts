4 February 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
A CURRENT AFFAIR WITH RAY MARTIN<br />
E &amp; O<br />
MARTIN: Prime M~ inister, droughts and bush fires and floods and the banks. The bush deserves a<br />
break doesn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It sure does and the spirit of those people is just amazing. I went to part of<br />
Queensland a few months ago and visited a group of people who hadn't sort of had<br />
any rain for about five years and the amazing thing is that they still have this optimistic<br />
attitude, and I just want to say on behalf of the rest of the Australian people that all the<br />
help that is reasonably needed is available. We've already sent one C 130 and another<br />
one is on the way and as further requests are made then they will be responded to.<br />
MARTIN: They lost their abattoirs as well, that was burnt down, they can't take a trick in<br />
Charleville. PREME MINISTER:<br />
No they really can't and I think the " pluck" evident in the voice of that person is just<br />
amazing and it's the sort of thing that makes Australians who have lived all their life in<br />
the big cities feel that rural Australia is a part of this country that must never be lost.<br />
MARTIN: Yes, thank you for your time, for joining us tonight by the way. On another matter, I<br />
take it that you are not a born-again republican? Faoxui ~ 84/ 62/ 97 19: 35 Pg: </p>
<p>Fax from 04/ 02/ 97 19: 35 Pg: 2<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I'm not but I am a born, a long term believer that the Constitution belongs to the<br />
Australian people and that I am having a convention because I promised the Australian<br />
people I would. I am doing exactly as I told them I would do.<br />
MARTIN: But you're still reluctant?<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Well I am not reluctant to do as I said I would do. Look, let's make it very clear. At<br />
the end of the day the Australian people will decide whether or not this country<br />
becomes a republic. I have always been upfront about my own views but I have<br />
always said at the end of the day it's not my view or Kim Beazley's view that counts,<br />
it's the view of the...<br />
MARTIN: Will we still have that vote by the year 2000?<br />
PRIME MIINISTER:<br />
People will have a vote on this issue by the year 2000, I've said that. That was part of<br />
our policy and, but I also said that it would be preceded by a convention and at the end<br />
of the day we have to get it right. There is no such thing as a practice republic. We<br />
have a very stable system at the present time and if we are to change it we must be<br />
absolutely certain that the system to which we are changing it is as good or if not<br />
better. Now, having a convention will ensure that all of the problems are teased out.<br />
Everybody will have a say. It won't be run by the politicians.<br />
MARTIN:<br />
Especially young Australians. You may..<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Young Australians are guaranteed a voice because amongst those who will be selected<br />
by the Government will be a portion for Aboriginals and Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander people and also for people between the ages of 18 and 24 who mightn't<br />
normally expect to be elected. Now if some of those who are elected as part of the<br />
general community portion, they will be additional young people at the convention.<br />
MAkRTIN: All right, A couple of quickies. I mean, is it worth dividing Australia about and is it<br />
worth $ 50 million we hear it's going to cost? </p>
<p>Fax from04/ 82/ 97 19: 3S Pg: 3<br />
PRIME MSTER:<br />
If people want the thing properly debated, this is the best way to do it. I don't want<br />
this issue to divide Australia.<br />
MARTIN: It probably will though, won't it?<br />
PRIMYE MINISTER.<br />
Well the only way that it won't divide Australia is if people debate it sensibly. I didn't<br />
start the push for a republic in this country. It was started by others but at the end of<br />
the day, I believe that the people own the Constitution and if you have a convention<br />
which debates all of the issues, you are less likely for it to be divisive and my plea to<br />
the Australian people is that this issue not be divisive. Mind you, this is not the most<br />
important issue this country faces.<br />
MARTIN: No, you've made the point it's not one of your priorities, is it?<br />
PRIME AMISTER:<br />
Well it's not. I mean, I am more interested in getting young people into jobs. I am<br />
more interested in..<br />
MARTIN: million would go a long way in getting people jobs, wouldn't it?<br />
PRIME NISTER:<br />
Well that is an argument for doing of course nothing. I mean, one is damned if one<br />
does, or damned if one doesn't. If we had walked away from our commitment to have<br />
a convention and we did absolutely nothing, Ray, you know as well as I do that I<br />
would be assailed every day by most people in the media who on this issue are more<br />
fanatical than the rest of the community.<br />
MARTIN: But you certainly think, I mean, you have made it clear you think if it aint broke, don't<br />
try and fix it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that is my personal view, yes and I have never disguised that. I didn't disguise it<br />
before the last election and I don't disguise it now but I respect the fact that other<br />
people in the community have a different view, including many people in my own party </p>
<p>Fax from and therefore the fair, decent, open, honest thing to do, the democratic thing to do is<br />
to give people a vehicle to debate it. If a consensus emerges you put that consensus.<br />
If you don't get a consensus you then try and suss out the views of people by<br />
indicative plebiscite.<br />
MARTIN: All right. Another quick issue then. Did you ask for Senator Bob Woods'<br />
resignation? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. MARTIN: Did you know about it, the Federal Police were investigating it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
He told md ten days ago that a completely baseless allegation about his expense<br />
accounts had been made and that was being investigated.<br />
MARTIN: How about the apprehended violence order?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No he did not tell me about that. I have only learnt about that along with everybody<br />
else quite recently. He did not tell me about that. He is resigning from the Parliament.<br />
I don't want to say any more.<br />
MARTIN: okay. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
He's entitled to a presumption of innocence and privacy like everybody else.*<br />
MARTIN: All right. Thank you for your time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's a pleasure. Fa oR04/ 02/ 97 19: 35 Pg: 4 </p>
