    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>I'm happy to answer any questions, perhaps I'll just say</p>
<p> on matters health, I note with particular interest the comments of</p>
<p> the Premier on AM this morning, Jeff Kennett, and his praise of the</p>
<p> $300 private health insurance initiative. We are off to a flying start</p>
<p> with that initiative. The private health insurance funds are receiving</p>
<p> new applications. It's a major breakthrough. It will enhance</p>
<p> choice and ultimately enhance service and it is good and correct policy.</p>
<p>The Federal Government is delighted with the rate of early take-up</p>
<p> and we encourage people to avail themselves by the various methods</p>
<p> of the $300 breakthrough in every $1,000 of premium which is now in</p>
<p> place, and as Michael Wooldridge has pointed out is going to be pushed</p>
<p> very strongly over this next few weeks period.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But Mr Kennett says that that is just tinkering at the edges. Should</p>
<p> Medicare be dismantled?</p>
<p>FISCHER:</p>
<p>I refer you to all that he said in AM this morning. I am not going</p>
<p> to dwell on that matter. It is something which there can always be</p>
<p> consideration of ways of improving things. That's what a vigorous</p>
<p> democracy is about. We promised the $300 breakthrough, we have delivered</p>
<p> that private health insurance breakthrough. What will help improve</p>
<p> things is to further expand the take-up rate. So I urge people as</p>
<p> they get a chance to think about things post-New Year and Christmas</p>
<p> break to look again and take up the private health insurance incentive.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Sounds like you are not ruling out dismantling Medicare. Can you give</p>
<p> an assurance.....</p>
<p> FISCHER:</p>
<p>Medicare stays absolutely. No qualification on that whatsoever. That</p>
<p> was creative thinking on your behalf on a very hot day here in Canberra.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you too scared, as Mr Kennett said, to dismantle Medicare?</p>
<p>FISCHER:</p>
<p>I say that the Government's policy is that Medicare stays, absolutely,</p>
<p> and I am not going to do other than get on with the task of encouraging</p>
<p> the next best thing as we enter this new year and that is the take-up</p>
<p> rate on private health insurance.</p>
<p>I note there's one other thing floating around this morning on</p>
<p> the opening of the Olympics. A country does not change the timing</p>
<p> of its constitutional change to fit into the programme and timetable</p>
<p> of a particular, albeit very major sporting event, the Olympics. It</p>
<p> is well known that it was back in 1994 that John Howard expressed</p>
<p> the view, the Government's view of this day, that the Prime Minister</p>
<p> of the day whoever he or she might be should carry out that opening.</p>
<p>But there's a second element to this which I just want to highlight.</p>
<p> If the referendum is carried in a majority of States and in the nation</p>
<p> overall and there's no certainty of that. I think it's a</p>
<p> close call but we are many months out of people having to think about</p>
<p> the actual changes and vote on those changes, then it was also the</p>
<p> understanding that that would take effect from 1 January 2001. All</p>
<p> other things being equal the Government is not of a mind to change</p>
<p> that aspect of the timetable. And this is all within the spirit of</p>
<p> the Constitutional Convention 12 months ago where these matters were</p>
<p> discussed in some detail. We are honouring our commitment to provide</p>
<p> that referendum in the second half of this year. There will be further</p>
<p> talks at the joint party meeting later in the next...during this</p>
<p> quarter. And the question of who opens, well, it should be the Prime</p>
<p> Minster of the day.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Why not the head of State? Why should the Prime Minister open the</p>
<p> games?</p>
<p>FISCHER:</p>
<p>It is a situation where the criticism that this is giving it to a</p>
<p> partisan person I actually reject. The Prime Minister of the country</p>
<p> is, in this sense, the equivalent of, for example, the President of</p>
<p> the USA. And Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton - both very partisan - one</p>
<p> republican, one democrat opened their respective Olympics and I have</p>
<p> nothing against the strong contribution to cohesion provided by the</p>
<p> various occupants of the Office of the Governor-General. But it is</p>
<p> quite properly the role of the Prime Minister and we should not get</p>
<p> tangled up with the timing of important constitutional change should</p>
<p> that be the wish of the people, that's yet to be established.</p>
<p> The National Party will be supporting the existing constitutional</p>
<p> arrangements. Thank you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What about the situation in Iraq?</p>
<p>FISCHER:</p>
<p>That's always a matter for ongoing concern, but there's</p>
<p> a job to be done there.</p>
