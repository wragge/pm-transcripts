March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP, GARDEN HOTEL, SHANGHAI CHINA<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
What we've just seen is a good demonstration that you don't have to be BHP to succeed<br />
in China. Here is Sigtech, a small business that employs fewer than 50 people, has found a<br />
niche market and is now not only operating successfully in Singapore but also as of now in<br />
Shanghai. It's just another illustration that lively, innovative, expansionist small businesses<br />
can also do very well in a big market such as China.<br />
JRNLST: Prime Minister, you're obviously trying to get more concessions to help businesses like<br />
that. When you go to Beijing, how do you think you will be treated on that sort of level<br />
by the leadership?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think they will be accommodating. The purpose of my visit is twofold. It is to<br />
emphasise the importance of the commercial association but also to focus on some of the<br />
broader, bilateral issues. I think the way in which we have been able to bring together the<br />
Government, or the political and the economic focus by having such a high powered<br />
business delegation accompanying me and the involvement of those men and women in the<br />
visit, I think that is driving home the point to our hosts that the Governments of Australia<br />
and the businesses of Australia are in this thing together which you must be in markets<br />
such as China. </p>
<p>JRNLST: Prime Minister, on the broader bilateral issues, what will you be hoping to achieve in your<br />
talks in Beijing?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I will be hoping for my part to make it very plain to the Chinese leadership that we<br />
take the relationship seriously. We are different countries, we are different societies but<br />
that doesn't prevent us focusing on the things that we have in common and the things that<br />
we can do together for our mutual benefit and I believe it is a relationship that has that<br />
particular quality. I think we happen to have a balanced, commonsense approach to us.<br />
We shouldn't get carried away. On the other hand we shouldn't underestimate the<br />
potential, and also we shouldn't underestimate the fact that in the past, Australia has<br />
economically stood by China in the commodity trade in particular when political relations<br />
haven't been all that flash, and in fact in areas like wool and wheat, our association with<br />
China goes back decades and we have kept that consistency and it's something that the<br />
Chinese remember.<br />
JRNLST: What will be the benchmark of your success?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't set benchmarks. Others do that. I'm not setting any benchmarks.<br />
JRNLST: What will you be telling the Chinese Government about Taiwan and it's...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we have a one China policy. We've had it since 1972 but we also have strong<br />
commercial links with Taiwan and they are important to Australia and I will be making<br />
that plain but I will also be making it plain that we respect and will observe the proprieties<br />
that ought to be associated with a one China policy.<br />
JRNLST: Last night you specifically mentioned TNT's joint venture ( inaudible) received a<br />
favourable response. Will you be undertaking similar representations on behalf of other<br />
firms? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I will always make appropriate representations for particular firms, yes. That's one of the<br />
roles of an exercise involving both the political and commercial leadership of Australia and<br />
all of the companies that are here and all of the companies that are represented in the<br />
delegation are very reputable, successful, highly regarded Australian companies and we<br />
are very keen as a Government to promote their legitimate interests.<br />
JRNLST: Mr Howard, what were your thoughts on this morning's church service?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I thought it was an impressive reminder of the way in which a group of people who<br />
hold a very strong value system have survived through extraordinary difficulties and<br />
people in Australia and the United States take freedom of worship for granted. That<br />
hasn't always been the case in China so one has a great deal of respect for people who<br />
have maintained that and it is also hopefully an illustration that, or a demonstration that<br />
there is greater religious tolerance and religious freedom in this country but when you<br />
have been through what many of the older people in that congregation must have been<br />
through it is a great testament to their faith and their commitment to what they hold dear.<br />
JRNLST: Prime Minister, given that freedom of worship isn't a given here in China at the moment<br />
and Easter is a time of traditional crackdown of some churches, how much consideration<br />
did you give to that fact before deciding to attend church today?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, I didn't think that that of itself was a reason not to observe something privately that<br />
I like to observe at Easter.<br />
JRNLST: Prime Minister, will you be bringing up the issue of Australian businessman James Peng<br />
with the Chinese leadership?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look I am not going to foreshadow everything that I am going to raise but you can rest<br />
assured that I will always represent the proper interests of Australian citizens wherever I<br />
go. </p>
