PRPM NUNISTER May 1974<br />
REDUCTION OF HOME-INTEREST RATES<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, today said that the Labor<br />
scheme for income tax deductibility on home interest paymenLs would<br />
effectively-cut interest rates for home buyers by 3 percent.<br />
It would bring home-interest rates for an average wage earner<br />
wn to their lowest level in ten years.<br />
The Prime Minister announced details of the scheme at a meeting<br />
in Adaminaby in support of the Labor M. P. for Eden-Monaro, Mr Bob Whan.<br />
* r One of the few positive undertakings Mr Snedden had given<br />
waring this campaign was to scrap this scheme, and let interest rates for<br />
home buyers take their course.<br />
Every home owner whether buying a new house, or paying off<br />
an existing dwelling would benefit from Labor's plan.<br />
" Unlike the hasty and unclear election policies of the<br />
Liberal/ Country Party, the Government's scheme has been carefully<br />
costed and prepared over the past year," Mr Whitlam said.<br />
" The legislation has been drafted and the scheme will take<br />
effect from 1 July 1974."<br />
" For an average wage earner with a $ 15,000 loan, it will<br />
effectively reduce a savings bank loan with an interest rate<br />
of 8.5 per cent down to 5.5 per cent, or a building society<br />
interest rate of 9.5 per cent down to 6.2 percent," Mr Whitlam said.<br />
" Mr Snedden has something different to say on interest<br />
rates every day.<br />
" One day he says they would go down, the next day he says they<br />
would not go down, and then again he says they would go up before<br />
they went down.<br />
" On one thing, however, he is quite clear. He has promised that<br />
he would abandon this scheme of tax deductibility for home buyers.<br />
He is apparently more interested in what rate of interest big<br />
business will pay than in the burden of interest rates on home<br />
repayments for the average man.<br />
" It is essential that the home buyer be relieved of the interest<br />
rate burden. I said in my election speech in November 1972 that I<br />
would bring in this scheme for home buyers. I announced in February<br />
that it would begin from the 1st July. It is now ready." </p>
<p>-2-<br />
intee the scheme, all tax-payers whose actual income is<br />
$ 4,000 or below will be entitled to deduct 100 per cent of their<br />
inteestrate payments. The percentage of total interest payments<br />
which is deductIble will be reduced by one per cent for every<br />
$ 100 of income in excess of $ 4,000.<br />
In addition, for new home buyers, the Labor Government would<br />
enter into discussions with lending institutions so as to bring<br />
about a re-arrangement of mortgage payments so that younger home<br />
owners will pay less at a time when the demands on their income<br />
are highest and begin to pay more later in life when they are better<br />
able to provide higher repayments, Mr Whitlam. said.<br />
Tables released by Mr Whitlam providing examples of the effects<br />
of the scheme at different interest rates, different income levels<br />
and for various society loans are attached to this statement.<br />
