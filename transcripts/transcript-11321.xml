<p>  Thank you very much, John and to your wife, Julie, to my many Ministerial</p>
<p>   and other Parliamentary colleagues, to you, Cory, the President of the South</p>
<p>   Australian Division, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>  It's a great delight, as always, to be back here in Adelaide, to have the</p>
<p>   opportunity of giving a little bit of a stock taking to the business community</p>
<p>   of Adelaide about how the Federal Government is going and where we see the</p>
<p>   Australian economy at the present time. And can I endorse very enthusiastically</p>
<p>   the sense of optimism transmitted to you by the Premier. The visit that</p>
<p>   I paid overseas very recently to Japan and the United States was but the</p>
<p>   latest in a number of visits I've paid overseas in the various capacities</p>
<p>   I've held or used to hold in the political structure of Australia. And I've</p>
<p>   been going around the place, particularly to the United States and Japan</p>
<p>   now for a number of years. And I have to say that the best thing about the</p>
<p>   most recent visit was not so much specific outcomes or specific issues discussed</p>
<p>   because they were, although important, they were not the principle focus</p>
<p>   of the visit, and not certainly the best thing about the visit, but the</p>
<p>   best thing of all was the great sense of confidence in which, or with which,</p>
<p>   Australia is now viewed around the world. And over the twenty year period</p>
<p>   or more that I've been visiting the city of New York, as a Treasurer, a</p>
<p>   Minister, a Shadow Minister, an Opposition Leader and the first occasion</p>
<p>   as Prime Minister in 1997, I don't think I have found a greater sense of</p>
<p>   positive feeling towards Australia and the achievements of the Australian</p>
<p>   economy than I did on this particular occasion.</p>
<p>  And what that really underlines, ladies and gentlemen, is that the greatest</p>
<p>   dividend of all out of the economic achievements and the economic strengths</p>
<p>   of Australia at the present time is a sense of self belief and a sense of</p>
<p>   national achievement and national dignity and national capacity which I</p>
<p>   believe the economic achievements and the economic recovery of the past</p>
<p>   few years has given Australia.</p>
<p>  I've said on a number of occasions in the past that when I became Prime</p>
<p>   Minister in March of 1996, I felt as if I had become the Prime Minister</p>
<p>   of a country, great though it was, was something of an anxious outsider</p>
<p>   knocking on the rich mans club of the Asian-Pacific region seeking admission.</p>
<p>  But over the last three and a quarter years, a lot has changed. The most</p>
<p>   significant thing is that we have been able to successfully stare down the</p>
<p>   worst recession that region has seen since World War II. And we have stared</p>
<p>   it down to an extent and in a way that a year ago if I had addressed a gathering</p>
<p>   like this, and I probably did address a gathering like this about a year</p>
<p>   ago, probably almost to the day because I normally address gatherings like</p>
<p>   this when I come to the State Conference of the Liberal Party here in South</p>
<p>   Australia. I probably would have said here something to you something along</p>
<p>   the lines of "Well, things have gone pretty well. We've got the Budget</p>
<p>   back into balance. We've implemented a number of industrial relations reforms.</p>
<p>   We've seen a little bit of a reduction in unemployment but we would like</p>
<p>   to see more and we're about to release the 800 pound gorilla - that is tax</p>
<p>   reform".</p>
<p>  And indeed we did. In fact, I think today is the first anniversary of the</p>
<p>   release of the 800 pound gorilla. The first anniversary of the release of</p>
<p>   taxation reform, I think Rob Gerard hosted a dinner for me in Canberra in</p>
<p>   his then capacity with the ACCI, he has so many capacities I think it was</p>
<p>   the ACCI. But a year on the landscape is very different. I would have said</p>
<p>   to you a year ago "Well, we have done pretty well, I think we can work</p>
<p>   our way through the Asian economic downturn but it's going to inflict a</p>
<p>   lot of damage and economic growth is going to slow down".</p>
<p>  A year on, of course, I can report to you that we have in fact succeeded</p>
<p>   beyond my wildest expectations. I have to be honest with you, I didn't predict</p>
<p>   a year ago that we would do so well. And we have done well for a number</p>
<p>   of reasons. The most important of which we are at long last getting the</p>
<p>   benefit of a series of economic reforms that have been embraced in this</p>
<p>   country over a number of years. And they include some reforms undertaken</p>
<p>   by the former government. And I've always been willing to give the former</p>
<p>   government credit in one or two areas where I believe the reforms it undertook,</p>
<p>   particularly in relation to changes to the financial system have been of</p>
<p>   great long term benefit to this country.</p>
<p>  But over the last few years of course under our administration we've been</p>
<p>   able to turn a $10.5 billion deficit into a healthy surplus, we've been</p>
<p>   able to bring about major changes to the industrial relations system that</p>
<p>   have lifted labour productivity in this country quite significantly, we've</p>
<p>   delivered the lowest interest rates in thirty years, the lowest level of</p>
<p>   inflation in more than three decades. And in a sense, most heart warming</p>
<p>   of all, the news we got yesterday that nationally, Australia has the lowest</p>
<p>   unemployment rate for more than ten years. And that in the three and a quarter</p>
<p>   years that we have been in office, we have been able to reduce the level</p>
<p>   of youth unemployment in Australia by 5.8 percentage points. It is now the</p>
<p>   lowest recorded since statistics began to be separately taken in relation</p>
<p>   to youth unemployment.</p>
<p>  And in the end, ladies and gentlemen, giving hope to young people to get</p>
<p>   jobs is about the most important mission that any government at a state</p>
<p>   or federal level of either political complexion can have in this country.</p>
<p>  So we've achieved a great deal over that period of time. And most recently,</p>
<p>   of course, negotiating fundamental reform of the tax system through the</p>
<p>   Australian Parliament has been probably the most important achievement of</p>
<p>   all. You are all aware that we took the tax reform plan to the last election.</p>
<p>   You are all aware of some of the risks that were inherent in that, but in</p>
<p>   the end you do have an obligation to campaign for reform when you hold a</p>
<p>   great public office. And that if you are not prepared to argue for things</p>
<p>   that improve the well being of the country, people are entitled to question</p>
<p>   fundamentally whether there is much point in your remaining in office. People</p>
<p>   are not elected Prime Minister or Premier or indeed to senior ministerial</p>
<p>   positions just for the satisfaction of having got there. And the whole purpose</p>
<p>   of being in government is to bring about reforms where they are necessary.</p>
<p>   And this country has needed taxation reform for a quarter of a century.</p>
<p>  About the first report I heard of when I came into Parliament was the Asprey</p>
<p>   Report. The Asprey Report was written under the chairmanship of the late</p>
<p>   Ken Asprey, who was a judge at the Court of Appeal in New South Wales, and</p>
<p>   it was commissioned by Billy Snedden when he was Treasurer and it was delivered</p>
<p>   to the Whitlam Government in 1975, not a good year for that particular government,</p>
<p>   but it was delivered to them and believe it or not, you know what it recommended?</p>
<p>   It recommended the introduction the introduction of a broad based indirect</p>
<p>   tax, and it recommended that it replace the wholesale sales tax, and it</p>
<p>   recommended some reductions in personal income tax as part of the package.</p>
<p>   And here we are at long last 25 years later, we have finally got that through.</p>
<p>  Now it wasn't in the exact same form that we put to the Australian people,</p>
<p>   and I was sorry about that. And I know there are some people in this room</p>
<p>   that were sorry about that. And the original model would have been better.</p>
<p>   But I couldn't get that through. The only way I was ever going to get that</p>
<p>   through the Parliament was to get the support of Senator Harradine. And</p>
<p>   he said "No". Or "I cannot" to be precise. And he couldn't</p>
<p>   and he didn't. So, I then opened negotiations with the Australian Democrats.</p>
<p>   And I found those negotiations straight forward and honourable. I don't</p>
<p>   agree with the Australian Democrats on a lot of things and they don't agree</p>
<p>   with me on a lot of things. But I found Senator Lees a thoroughly decent</p>
<p>   person with whom to deal and a person of honour and a person of her word.</p>
<p>   And you can deal with anybody who brings to negotiations that kind of good</p>
<p>   faith. And we got an outcome, less than perfect, but an outcome that was</p>
<p>   85 - 90 per cent of what we wanted. And of course we are going to implement</p>
<p>   that.</p>
<p>  There are going to be inevitably as you implement tax reform, there is going</p>
<p>   to be detail, there is going to be complexity. But I assure you that we</p>
<p>   are going to commit the resources to make certain that the Australian public</p>
<p>   fully understands what we are doing and the Australian public is fully informed</p>
<p>   about what we are doing, the business community is fully informed, about</p>
<p>   the advantages of the goods and services tax. And the advantages of this</p>
<p>   change for the business community, leaving aside for a moment business tax</p>
<p>   to which I will return, leaving that aside for a moment I can assure you</p>
<p>   that there are enormous benefits that will flow in terms of reduced export</p>
<p>   costs, reduced business costs, reduced fuel costs and other advantages from</p>
<p>   the fundamental reform that we are proposing. And that will, of course,</p>
<p>   come in substantially into effect on the first of July next year. And the</p>
<p>   benefits for South Australia, given the strong manufacturing industry base</p>
<p>   for this base are probably greater than for a number of other states. And</p>
<p>   you've already begun to see some of the changes which are involved with</p>
<p>   already the reduction in the higher rates of wholesale sales tax down to</p>
<p>   the more standard rate of 22 per cent as a precursor to the total abolition</p>
<p>   of wholesale sales tax on the first of July in the year 2000.</p>
<p>  As well as what was contained in the taxation reform plan taken to the Australian</p>
<p>   people, we invited John Ralph, supported by Rick Allett and Bob Joss, two</p>
<p>   other very prominent Australian businessmen, to report to us on reforms</p>
<p>   to the business taxation system. The Treasurer and I received that report</p>
<p>   from Mr Ralph a little over a week ago. And I want to record the profound</p>
<p>   gratitude of the government, not only to John, but also to Rick and to Bob</p>
<p>   and to all of the other people who worked on that report.</p>
<p>  I'm not in a position to make it public just yet. I'm not in a position</p>
<p>   yet to say exactly how we're going to handle the process of decision making</p>
<p>   and subsequent release of either or decisions and the content of the report.</p>
<p>   I want to say, however, it is about the most comprehensive and detailed</p>
<p>   examination of any aspect of the working of our economy that I have seen.</p>
<p>   It's a very well written report. It does contain some wide sweeping and</p>
<p>   wide ranging recommendations.</p>
<p>  Inevitably it has become a matter of understandable public knowledge that</p>
<p>   a number of issues are central to the proposals that have been examined</p>
<p>   by the report. Clearly there is a debate about whether we should have a</p>
<p>   lower rate of general taxation for companies paid for in part by the removal</p>
<p>   of some existing provisions, particularly accelerated depreciation. There</p>
<p>   are clearly going to be considerations of whether we should alter our capital</p>
<p>   gains tax structure. I've already said, and I repeat here today, that because</p>
<p>   we live in a global world economy where there are seamless flows of capital</p>
<p>   across boarders, increasingly followed by seamless flows of jobs, it's essential</p>
<p>   that Australia ask the constant question, is it as attractive to invest</p>
<p>   in Australia as it is to attract in other countries, particularly the United</p>
<p>   States.</p>
<p>  As a nation we have had a remarkable record for a people of only now 19</p>
<p>   million we have had a remarkable record of discovering things. Over the</p>
<p>   years we have been extraordinary in our inventive capacity but we have often</p>
<p>   been very bad and very negligent in our capacity to convert those inventions</p>
<p>   to our commercial advantage. And when I addressed the Federal Council of</p>
<p>   the Liberal Party a few months ago I spoke of not so much building Australia</p>
<p>   into a clever country or a lucky country both of which we already are. But</p>
<p>   rather building Australia into a 'can do' country. A country that can readily</p>
<p>   convert its intellectual capacity and intellectual capital to great national</p>
<p>   commercial advantage.</p>
<p>  And therefore one of the things that we have to look at when we examine</p>
<p>   our tax system is whether there are enough encouragements and incentives</p>
<p>   within the system for people to take risks and to invest in ventures. And</p>
<p>   that inevitably means we have got to look at the capital gains tax.</p>
<p>  I mention those things, ladies and gentlemen, to recognise the reality that</p>
<p>   part of the debate in responding to Ralph, part of the debate is fundamentally</p>
<p>   about those sorts of considerations. We haven't reached any final decisions</p>
<p>   yet. We hope to soon. We are in receipt of a lot of advice and that's fair</p>
<p>   enough. People have different points of view to put and it's part of the</p>
<p>   democratic process in a nation like Australia that people with commercial</p>
<p>   interests, legitimate commercial interests, and commercial concerns should</p>
<p>   be able to put their views and to put them very strongly.</p>
<p>  I can predict now that the final decisions we take won't satisfy everybody,</p>
<p>   they clearly won't. We are very mindful of the importance of some of the</p>
<p>   existing tax provisions for particular sectors of Australian business. We</p>
<p>   are also mindful that when you are looking at the impact of tax reform on</p>
<p>   particular sectors and particular companies you have got to take into account</p>
<p>   just not one section but rather the aggregate impact of tax reform right</p>
<p>   across the board. And it's fair to say that some sectors of industry have</p>
<p>   gained relatively more from the changes contained in the plan taken to the</p>
<p>   electorate last year than other sectors because the spreading of the broad,</p>
<p>   the base of the indirect tax in this country has brought about that result.</p>
<p>  But above all, I want out of the business tax reform process I want this</p>
<p>   country to have a modern, competitive taxation system. One that makes it</p>
<p>   attractive for the world to invest in Australia as well as one that makes</p>
<p>   it attractive for Australians to invest in Australia and also importantly</p>
<p>   and increasingly for Australian companies to invest abroad. Because we should</p>
<p>   never see foreign investment in this country as being simply a one-way process.</p>
<p>   So they are the sorts of considerations that I want to bring to our consideration</p>
<p>   of taxation reform in the business area.</p>
<p>  I have spoken, ladies and gentlemen, so far about essentially business and</p>
<p>   economic matters. But to, I guess, vary slightly a biblical injunction,</p>
<p>   governments don't live by bread alone either. And governments are not just</p>
<p>   about taxation and bottom lines and industrial relations and privatisation</p>
<p>   and share ownership. Governments are also about the kind of society we want,</p>
<p>   the kind of society in which we live. And that's why I am particularly proud</p>
<p>   of some of our greatest social initiatives.</p>
<p>  Our determination at the very beginning of our term in office to achieve</p>
<p>   national gun control laws in this country which have meant that I hope,</p>
<p>   and I think most people hope, that we may in years to come be spared the</p>
<p>   horrific murder rates and crime rates that are so evident in the United</p>
<p>   States of America. And time will tell how effective that has been, those</p>
<p>   changes but already the evidence is that they have started to have a positive</p>
<p>   impact.</p>
<p>  It is why the Government is so resolutely committed to a three-pronged attack</p>
<p>   on the drug menace of putting more money into law enforcement, more money</p>
<p>   into educating young people who against the dangers of drug abuse, indeed</p>
<p>   the dangers of taking certain drugs at all let alone abusing their consumption.</p>
<p>   And also putting additional resources into helping people who have got a</p>
<p>   drug problem kick the habit and change their lives for the better.</p>
<p>  And the Federal Government has committed an additional $500 million over</p>
<p>   the last couple of years towards that campaign. And I can't think of a social</p>
<p>   priority which is more important to me and is more important to the future</p>
<p>   well-being of this country. And it is something that touches everybody in</p>
<p>   one way or another. It's not just something for a Prime Minister to talk</p>
<p>   about at a gathering of people representing social welfare organisation.</p>
<p>   It's something a Prime Minister ought to talk about at a gathering like</p>
<p>   this as feelingly as he may talk about it at any other gathering.</p>
<p>  And I have tried to do that, ladies and gentlemen, within the embrace of</p>
<p>   an approach to social policy which I have called building a social coalition.</p>
<p>   That's based on a belief that in our kind of society you can't do anything</p>
<p>   completely on your own. We now have a far more realistic view in Australia</p>
<p>   about what governments can do. We went through a crazy period along with</p>
<p>   a lot of other nations around the world 25 or 30 years ago believing that</p>
<p>   all you had to do was to expand the role of government, get the government</p>
<p>   to spend more money and everything would be solved.</p>
<p>  The Whitlam Government tried that, the Johnson Administration tried that.</p>
<p>   I can think of a few State governments around Australia over the last 15</p>
<p>   years who tried that. They started running businesses, they started getting</p>
<p>   into this or that commercial activity where they didn't belong and it all</p>
<p>   fell in a heap. And no State knows that better than South Australia. And</p>
<p>   then there was perhaps a bit of an over-reaction and we got to the idea</p>
<p>   that the only thing that, in the eyes of some, the only thing that mattered</p>
<p>   was individual greed and individual gratification and that's not the right</p>
<p>   response either. And I think as we come to the end of this century and this</p>
<p>   millennium we have probably got a more civil balance in our community about</p>
<p>   the respective roles.</p>
<p>  The Government does have a limited role but it's a strategic role. The business</p>
<p>   community has a very important role. The great welfare organisations of</p>
<p>   Australia, like the City Missions and the Salvation Army and the St Vincent</p>
<p>   de Paul society, they have a very special role. Not just the role of compassion</p>
<p>   of looking after people but also the role of giving policy advice to governments.</p>
<p>   And philanthropic individuals have got a role. And it's in that context</p>
<p>   that the Government has advanced greater cooperation between the Government</p>
<p>   and the business community in the area of philanthropy. And we have given</p>
<p>   a number of very significant taxation concessions over the last few months</p>
<p>   and over the last year to encourage that.</p>
<p>  And it's in that context, ladies and gentlemen, that I am particularly delighted</p>
<p>   here in Adelaide in the presence of the Managing Director of the company</p>
<p>   to announce the extraordinary generosity of Santos Ltd which is to enter</p>
<p>   a joint venture with the University of Adelaide to establish the Santos</p>
<p>   School of Petroleum and Engineering. And the Santos company will be making</p>
<p>   a provision of no less than $25 million to the establishment of this school.</p>
<p>  Can I say to the company and to its Managing Director, Ross Adler, that</p>
<p>   this is precisely the kind of philanthropic venture that Australian companies</p>
<p>   should be encouraged to undertake. The sponsorship is intended to lay the</p>
<p>   financial foundation of the school for at least 20 years. And it is believed</p>
<p>   to be one of the largest financial contributions ever made to a university</p>
<p>   in Australia.</p>
<p>  The school will provide high quality research and professional training</p>
<p>   in an area of strategic importance to Australia's economic development.</p>
<p>   And it's a long-term investment in Australia's knowledge and skill base.</p>
<p>   And the Government itself wishes to demonstrate its support for this partnership</p>
<p>   and we are going to provide a $1 million grant over five years to fund a</p>
<p>   professorial Chair in petroleum engineering. And in recognition of that</p>
<p>   great gesture by the company the Commonwealth Government Chair, funded Chair,</p>
<p>   will be named the Ross Adler Chair in Petroleum Engineering at the University</p>
<p>   of Adelaide.</p>
<p>  This particular gesture by the company is a great source of satisfaction</p>
<p>   to the Government. I know it will be a great source of pride and satisfaction</p>
<p>   to the University of Adelaide. It's a marvellous benchmarker and role taker</p>
<p>   for the University of Adelaide, for Santos, for the city of Adelaide and</p>
<p>   for the State of South Australia. And it's a great demonstration of the</p>
<p>   philanthropic spirit of this city and it speaks volumes for the sense of</p>
<p>   civic responsibility of the company and those who have founded the company.</p>
<p>  This is a good example of the sort of social coalition of which I have spoken.</p>
<p>   But everybody has a responsibility in achieving outcomes. Each has a special</p>
<p>   role to play and a particular contribution to make. Our great responsibility</p>
<p>   as a national Government is to provide the fundamental underpinning and</p>
<p>   the fundamentally positive economic environment in which people can do things</p>
<p>   and to aspire to do even greater things. And as we come towards the end</p>
<p>   of this century we approach the end of the century and the next millennium</p>
<p>   with a great sense of hope and a great sense of optimism.</p>
<p>  I find as I go around Australia a sense of national resolve and a sense</p>
<p>   of national pride and a sense of national, perhaps contentment is not the</p>
<p>   right word because contentment speaks too much of complacency and oversatisfaction,</p>
<p>   but a sense of great achievement that we have been able to do something</p>
<p>   with our economy and we have been able to do it in a civil and a fair way.</p>
<p>   We have not just delivered lower interest rates and lower tax we have also</p>
<p>   delivered lower unemployment. We have preserved the social security safety</p>
<p>   net, we have tackled fundamental social problems and we have also had, of</p>
<p>   course as Australians want in recent months, we have had some remarkable</p>
<p>   successes on the sporting field.</p>
<p>  And I was reminded when John was talking with great pride about South Australian</p>
<p>   exports that at the end of our trip to North America Janette and I spent</p>
<p>   our last day in Boston and we saw a great South Australian export performing</p>
<p>   in Boston. We saw a tremendous performance on the first day of the Davis</p>
<p>   Cup by Lleyton Hewitt. It was an absolutely remarkable performance and it</p>
<p>   was a great source of pride for me as Prime Minister to wish him well before</p>
<p>   the game and to congratulate him afterwards. And I have got to tell you</p>
<p>   that the duo of the Prime Minister of Australia and the Honourable Andrew</p>
<p>   Peacock, Australia's Ambassador to Washington, cheering the Australians</p>
<p>   on surrounded by these very stony faced sullen and partisan Americans was</p>
<p>   quite a sight to behold. And all of that in 41 degree heat or 101 or 98</p>
<p>   or something as the Americans still translate and as I remember from my</p>
<p>   younger days.</p>
<p>  But, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for coming today. Thank you</p>
<p>   very much for the support that I know a lot of you give to our great political</p>
<p>   cause. I hope that our stewardship is seen as a proper discharge of the</p>
<p>   hopes that you have invested in us. We'll continue to try. I'll continue</p>
<p>   to work closely with your Premier who I admire and I congratulate for the</p>
<p>   success he has finally achieved through persisting with his plans to reduce</p>
<p>   the debt that he inherited here in the State of South Australia. And again</p>
<p>   I warmly thank Ross Adler and Santos Ltd for its great generosity and its</p>
<p>   great demonstration of what I mean when I speak of corporate philanthropy</p>
<p>   in Australia. Thanks a lot.</p>
