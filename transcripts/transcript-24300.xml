    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government is delivering its commitment to give Australian small businesses a âfair goâ by extending the unfair contract protections currently available to consumers to cover the small business sector.</p>
<p>Small business is the engine room of Australiaâs economic future. We want to ensure that small businesses have access to a level playing field so they can continue to grow, invest and create jobs.</p>
<p>Like consumers, small businesses are often presented with âtake it or leave itâ contracts, with little scope to negotiate just and fair terms.</p>
<p>Small businesses often lack the time, legal expertise or bargaining power to resist enforcement of unfair terms against them.</p>
<p>The Australian Small Business Commissioner has observed instances of misuse of market power in contracting of telephone and internet services; office or commercial leasing equipment; and retail outlet leases.</p>
<p>This is why we need to make sure we have strong protections for small businesses.</p>
<p>The new small business protections will allow the courts to declare void a term within a contract that is unfair. For example, a term that allows a big business to unilaterally change the price or key terms during the course of the contract could be considered unfair.Â </p>
<p>Businesses that offer low value standard form contracts will have to comply with the new law.</p>
<p>The Government has provided $1.4 million to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to ensure businesses comply with the new rules.</p>
<p>The Minister for Small Business has written to state and territory consumer affairs ministers asking them to agree to the changes.</p>
<p>The previous government promised to give small businesses the benefit of unfair contract provisions but they never delivered on that commitment.</p>
<p>This Government is committed to being the positive partner small business needs and working as hard for the success of small business as those in these businesses do.</p>
<p>A new jobs and small business package will also be announced over coming weeks. It will include a small business company tax cut on July 1 â at least as big as the 1.5 per cent already flagged.</p>
<p>This week, the Government held our third Red Tape Repeal Day. To date, we have made decisions to decrease the regulatory cost burden by $2.45 billion, well ahead of our target to reduce red tape by $1 billion each year.</p>
<p>The Government is restoring time and resources back to small business to invest in their business success rather than navigating a costly and time consuming maze of red tape.</p>
