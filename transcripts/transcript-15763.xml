    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister today announced that the Federal Government would provide additional assistance to Mackay residents seriously affected by the floods.</p>
<p>The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP) will be made available to those people adversely affected by the storms and associated flooding that commenced in the Mackay region on 14 February.</p>
<p>Those eligible will be able to receive a one off payment of $1000 for adults and $400 for each child to help relieve their hardship.</p>
<p>The Federal Government will continue to work with the Queensland Government and local community organisations to support those families through this difficult time.</p>
<p>There will be much work to do over the coming weeks for these communities to fully recover.  The Federal Government will do its bit.  </p>
<p>Queenslanders always respond magnificently in a crisis and I'm sure this will be the case again.</p>
<p>The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment will provide financial assistance to people whose principal place of residence has been destroyed or significantly damaged, as well as those who have been seriously injured and hospitalised for more than 48 hours as a direct result of the floods.</p>
<p>This assistance is over and above the support being provided by the Australian Government under the long standing Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA).</p>
<p>Through these arrangements with the states, the Australian Government assists with the costs and resourcing of response and recovery operations in large scale disasters.</p>
<p>The Federal Member for Dawson, James Bidgood MP, congratulated all the volunteers and emergency service workers on the ground in Mackay, who have been working around the clock to help those local families and small businesses get back on their feet as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We really appreciate the magnificent job all those on the frontline are doing.</p>
<p>For information on the AGDRP call the Australian Government Flood Assistance Hotline on 180 2333 or visit your local Centrelink office.</p>
