    <content><![CDATA[<p>More than 300 current and former ADF personnel and Defence civilians who served on Operation CATALYST will tomorrow participate in a parade marking the end of the operation at the Australian War Memorial.</p>
<p>The Minister for Defence, Senator John Faulkner and I will attend the parade, along with Her Excellency the Governor-General.</p>
<p>Operation CATALYST was the Australian Defence Force (ADF) contribution to the US-led Multinational Force effort to develop a secure and stable environment in Iraq and to assist national recovery programs.</p>
<p>Around 20,000 ADF personnel served on Operation CATALYST, which commenced on 16 July 2003 and concluded on 31 July 2009.</p>
<p>Over that time, the conduct of our servicemen and women upheld the great traditions of the ADF.</p>
<p>Every one of the men and women who served can be proud of what they contributed in Iraq.</p>
<p>Servicemen and women from all three Services were deployed in a range of combat, combat support, security and training roles to enable the people of Iraq to take responsibility for their own security.</p>
<p>The Australian Federation Guard will lead the parade from Anzac Parade onto the Australian War Memorial Parade Ground.</p>
<p>The parade commences at 2pm.</p>
