MEDIA RELEASE : Z T -H S ); TH AFRICA<br />
Statement by -h Acting Prime Mini-re; Minister for Overseas<br />
Tra. de, The Rt. Hon.<br />
I share the dismay of all Au--r: i. ns the tragic<br />
events in South Africa.<br />
But I do not think that a traCe ill affect the<br />
situation in South Africa, or persuade -rica to change<br />
its policies. It will certainly affect Australi.. : hich in the<br />
last full financial year exported to Sout:. f-. rica goods worth<br />
nearly $ 100 million, and imported goods wcr-. million.<br />
As 80% of our exports to South Africa consi: of-manufactured<br />
goods, there will be some employment impliza7:-. ns in the ban.<br />
Australia is completely opposed tc -he system of<br />
apathied, and will support appropriate measur-:. in the United<br />
Nations and elsewhere to end racial discrimination wherever<br />
it exists. The Government believes no purpose is served by not<br />
maintaining diplomatic and economic relations with countries<br />
with social or political systems which do not meet our<br />
standards. As far as trade with South Africa is concerned, the<br />
Liberal-National Country Party Government has maintained the<br />
general principles established by the previous Government in 1973<br />
that is, that normal economic relations be permitted to continue<br />
without avoidable official assistance.<br />
