    <content><![CDATA[<p>The men whose names are carved into this memorial, were the hope of their day; just as you young people, who are gathered here right now, are the hope of ours.</p>
<p>To us, they are Anzacs; but in their day, they were fathers, sons, parents, children, cousins and mates â just as you are now.</p>
<p>You walk among their headstones, you read the inscriptions, you hear the epitaphs and you hear their families speak.</p>
<p>In these inscriptions, in these epitaphs, we hear the echoes of our country, a century ago.</p>
<p>We feel that spirit beckoning us, to bigger, more honest and less selfish lives.</p>
<p>From this place, from those who are buried here, we draw sustenance and inspiration.</p>
<p>We donât come here merely to lament.</p>
<p>We come here to show respect â because their stories have become our stories.</p>
<p>Our nation is not just a place on a map, or a mass of people who happen to live somewhere.</p>
<p>Our nation is shaped by our collective memory; by the compact, between the dead, the living and the yet-to-be-born.</p>
<p>And this is the mystery, and the wonder of Lone Pine: this home that is so far away from our home; this place of peace that was once a battlefield.</p>
<p>The Gallipoli of August 1915 reeked of death</p>
<p>It was a place of disease and lice, of dysentery and flies, of headaches and fevers from dehydration, of frayed nerves from living under months of gunfire.</p>
<p>Lone Pine was a battle of bayonets, hand held bombs and knives; and when there was nothing left to fight with, fists, knuckles, boots and teeth.Â </p>
<p>Of all the bastards of places, this is the greatest bastard in the world, wrote a soldier who had lived the horror.</p>
<p>Woe is to be found everywhere, wrote another.</p>
<p>The Lone Pine attack was meant to be a distraction, while a larger operation took place elsewhere on this peninsula.Â </p>
<p>Of itself, it had little strategic purpose.</p>
<p>But that didnât stop both sides fighting with an intensity that shocks us and moves us, even a century on.</p>
<p>In just four days in August 1915, some 800 Australians lost their lives; and 1500 were wounded in and around the trenches that run across this cemetery.</p>
<p>The Turkish casualties were almost three times ours.</p>
<p>Itâs hard to fathom so much loss for what seems so little.</p>
<p>Yet it was not for nothing.</p>
<p>It was for country, empire, king, and the ideal that people and countries should be free.</p>
<p>It was for duty, loyalty, honour and mates: the virtues that outshine any cause.</p>
<p>So here, at Lone Pine, we remember those men called upon to do things in their countryâs name that took them to the very edge of their physical and emotional limits, and beyond.</p>
<p>We remember them and how they somehow found strength in each other.</p>
<p>We wonder at their selflessness.</p>
<p>We wonder at their capacity to face death, and not to falter.</p>
<p>We wonder at what possessed them to charge into machinegun fire, or to push friends out of the way of unexploded bombs.</p>
<p>And we remember everyone who served on this peninsula: Australians, New Zealanders, Britons, French, Indians, Canadians â and Turks too.</p>
<p>We remember the brave, the scared, and the confused.</p>
<p>We remember the good and the bad; the greatness and the smallness of it all.</p>
<p>For when the battle is over, when the wounds have healed, and when the ground has cooled, great warriors can see their enemiesâ virtue.Â </p>
<p>The care taken of this place reflects the foe that is now a friend.</p>
<p>So today, I salute a noble adversary and I thank the Republic of Turkey for accepting our sons with theirs.</p>
<p>On the headstones here, on the graves with no name, are etched the words: their glory shall not be blotted out.</p>
<p>It is taken from the Scripture: Their seed shall remain forever. Their glory shall not be blotted out.</p>
<p>A century on, we re-affirm this truth.Â </p>
<p>Our nation has grown from their seed.</p>
<p>Australia thrives and prospers, nourished by their example.</p>
<p>Here at Lone Pine, the pact between the past and the present is renewed for the future; for all who seek to understand what it means to be Australian.</p>
