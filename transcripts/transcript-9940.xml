PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIM MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SAMANTHA RILEY, AND A LIBERAL PARTY DIRTY TRICK<br />
Tonight I have seen television reports of allegations made against me by Liberal<br />
Senator Ian Campbell, suggesting I had attempted to exclude Samnantha Riley from the<br />
Prime Ministerial Women and Sport Awards.<br />
As I have already made clear today, this claim is totally false and malicious. It is also<br />
an inappropriate and cynical use by the Coalition of a young Australian sporting<br />
champion who is facing an extremely difficult time in her career.<br />
Samantha is already under extreme pressure, and I resent the Liberal Party's<br />
use of incorrect rumours to add to her burden.<br />
This is typical of John Howard's leadership style. He spruiks integrity and honesty, and<br />
then authorises his shadow ministers to tell shameless downright lies.<br />
I was delighted to be advised tonight that the independent commnittee which decides<br />
these awards has in fact confirmed that Samiantha Riley will be a recipient when the<br />
awards are announced on Monday 26 February.<br />
John Howard and Senator Campbell both owe Samantha Riley an apology for trying to<br />
use her name for the most rancid political motives. The man firom Bennelong is going<br />
to use every dirty trick in the book to try to make himself Prime Minister.<br />
