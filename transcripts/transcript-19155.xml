<p>[ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS OMITTED]</p>
<p>We meet today on the traditional country of the Kulin Nation and I offer my respects to their elders past and present.</p>
<p>Up in Sydney when I've been at St Patrick's day events, the St Pat's Day lunch is hosted by a financial journalist, Michael Pascoe, who does a great job keeping the mob in line. </p>
<p>In Melbourne of course, we've got a champion footballer instead.</p>
<p>It's tempting to reflect on what this says about our two great cities, but as I'm sure St Patrick himself would counsel me: resist temptation. So I will.</p>
<p>So let's just talk about Melbourne for the moment. Truly it is impossible to imagine Melbourne without the Irish influence.</p>
<p>We're just down the road from St Patrick's Cathedral, that “work of centuries crowded into years”, a triumph of Gothic Revival and of Gaelic pride.</p>
<p>I'm sure some of you have come straight from confession to here.</p>
<p>We're a stone's throw away from that legendary Young and Jackson's, named for two Dubliners.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of you a little bit later in the day will pop over for a pint of cappuccino following lunch.</p>
<p>Even the river running past us now through the middle of Melbourne bears a resemblance to Anna Liffey. </p>
<p>Iris Murdoch had one of her characters say:</p>
<p>No man who has faced the Liffey can be<br />
appalled by the dirt of another river.</p>
<p>And she didn't know the Yarra when that character uttered those words.</p>
<p>So on such an Irish day in such an Irish town it's very fitting that I can announce a special series of measures which will be in effect in this state this weekend to celebrate St Patrick.</p>
<p>This weekend, Phillip Island will be renamed ‘Old Ireland'.</p>
<p>Every bar and cafe will substitute Vic Bitter with Guinness.</p>
<p>Seal Rock will be renamed Selkie Rock. The Nobbies will be re-named the O'Nobbies.</p>
<p>The traffic lights on the way through town won't be red orange and green – they'll be green, orange and white.</p>
<p>I ‘m contemplating name myself Taoiseach Gillard for a day too, I reckon that'd be fun too.</p>
<p>And Laura Smyth is heading straight from here: she'll be up all night dressing the fairy penguins up as leprechauns.</p>
<p>Now, as you know, it is certainly true, I'm not Irish: I was born in Barry, in Wales.</p>
<p>And I was raised in the Baptist tradition: we weren't really allowed to believe in Saints.</p>
<p>Or in drinking.</p>
<p>Or in dancing now that I come to think of it.</p>
<p>And the kind of songs I first heard the O'Connor brothers sing at uni would have gotten the Gillards expelled from chapel for life – that's certainly true!</p>
<p>So coning from that background the basic rituals of this day are something I still find a delightful novelty.</p>
<p>But as I'm sure most of you know, my Welsh blood is actually why I have some authority on the subject of St Patrick.</p>
<p>Never forget that St Paddy's Day is actually all about a Taff – someone from Wales.</p>
<p>I'm always struck that while it took pirates to bring young Patrick into Ireland and they took him there as a slave, once he gained his freedom, the first thing he did was to swear to go back.</p>
<p>After all, he had met the Irish people.</p>
<p>That was the great good fortune in St Patrick's life and it's one of the great good fortunes of life of Australia.</p>
<p>We've been so blessed by the contributions of great Irish individuals who've made names for themselves and their people.</p>
<p>We've been even more blessed by all the millions who've come – their millions of descendants – and the tens of thousands of Irish-born Australians who live with us today: the countless, nameless nation-builders of Irish Australia.</p>
<p>You've come a long way, we've come a long way, and we've achieved so much together.</p>
<p>Today is the perfect day to celebrate it all.</p>
<p>Because the story of St Patrick, at its human core, is the story of a man who breaks the chains, who works and learns, who dedicates himself to others and who changes a nation.</p>
<p>And that, friends, is the story of the Irish in Australia.</p>
<p>So enjoy the holy-day.</p>
<p>Sláinte!</p>
