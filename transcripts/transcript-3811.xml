SPEECH BY THE PRIM-E MINISTER,<br />
THE HION. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE 1975 AUSTRALIAN LEGAL CONVENTION<br />
CANBERRA, 2-JULY 1975<br />
Many of the matters proposed at earlier<br />
conventions have been debated in the Parliament in this<br />
city since the last convention. Many of the matters I<br />
myself mentioned at that convention have been discussed<br />
here. Some have come to fruition; others have not done so,<br />
at least not yet. At the 10th Australian'Legal Convention<br />
in 1957, Sir Owen Dixon suggested a federal Law Reform<br />
Committee to prepare and promulgate draft reforms for<br />
adopt'ion by the Parliaments of Australia and the States.<br />
He pointed out that in all or nearly all matters of<br />
private law there is no geographical reason why the law<br />
should be different in any part of Australia. Is it<br />
not unworthy of Australia as a nation, he asked, that we have<br />
varying laws affecting the relations between man and man?<br />
If I may quote Tacitus corruptissima<br />
republica plurimae leges: The Commonwealth is most marred<br />
when it has most laws.<br />
At long' last, * that suggestion by Sir Owen<br />
Dixon has borne fruit. An Act of the Australian Parliament<br />
has established a Law Reform Commission. The Commission<br />
has been charged Wi. th the task of preparing proposals for<br />
the reform of laws, not only on matters within the direct<br />
competence of " the Australian Parliament, but on matters<br />
on which it is desirable that there should be uniformity<br />
of law in the States and Territories. The Commission<br />
has a full-time Chairman, Mr Justice Michael Kirby, and<br />
five part-time members. We have sought, by advertisement,<br />
indications of interest from lawyers throughout Australia<br />
in being appointed as full-time members of the Commission.<br />
Without waiting to be fully established,<br />
the Commission has embarked on its first reference, the<br />
difficult and delicate task of reconciling the protection<br />
of civil liberties with the requirement for strong and<br />
effective police action at the national level to combat<br />
the growth in sophisticated crime.<br />
A paper entitled ' The Necessity for a New<br />
Federal Court' was delivered at the 13th Legal Convention<br />
in Hobart in January 1963 by Mr Maurice Byers, Q. C.,<br />
and Mr Paul Toose, now respectively the<br />
Solicitor-General of Australia and judge of the<br />
Supreme Court of New South Wales. In the discussions<br />
on the paper the Solicitor-General Sir Kenneth Bailey, Q. C.,<br />
announced on behalf of the Attorney-General, Sir Garfield<br />
B~ arwick, that the Cabinet had authorised him to design a newfederal<br />
superior court. Sir Kenneth went on to say that the </p>
<p>paper would be of material assistance to Sir Garfield whose<br />
congratulations be extended to the learned authors.<br />
Attorney-General Bowen delivered a paper<br />
on the proposal for the 15th Legal Convention on<br />
17 July 1967. He declared that there was a broad<br />
concensus that such a court should be established. He<br />
stated categorically that ' a decision has been taken to<br />
establish.. the court' and that arguments advanced<br />
against the idea are now ' academic'.<br />
He presented a Corrconwealth Superior<br />
Court Bill on 21 November 1968. My Government's bill, although<br />
promised at both the 1972 and 1974 elections, has beentwice<br />
rejected by the Senate. There has in fact been<br />
much lobbying by State Supreme Court judges.<br />
Following the report of the Sen~ ate<br />
Committee on Securities and Exchange, the Government<br />
has introduced the Corporations and Securibies Industry<br />
Bill to establish a Securities and . Exchange Commission<br />
to provide where regulation is necessary, a proper<br />
regulation of the securities industry on a nationl basis.<br />
Finally, work is well advanced on the<br />
preparation of a National Companies Bill. When this is<br />
enacted it will end the frustration suffered by companies<br />
who wish to operate on a national basis but find themselves<br />
confronted with eight set"-s of company laws. The high<br />
hopes that were entertained with the enactment in each<br />
State and Territory of the uniform Companies Act in the<br />
early 1960' s have not been realised:* Mr John Young, Q. C.,<br />
and Mr Rodd delivered a paper to the 13th ConventCion in<br />
1963. The late Mr Justice H-ardie said then it would<br />
have to be a federal act.<br />
Debate on the National Compensation<br />
legislation, to supplant the litigation based on compulsory<br />
workers' compensation insurance and compulsory third<br />
party insurance, awaits a report from a Senate committee.<br />
I hasten to add that lawyers will be amply<br />
compensated by new fields of jurisprudence arising<br />
from legislation on consumer affairs and the environment<br />
and family law and on international conventions dealing<br />
with matters of commerce and liability and human rights.<br />
And although this gathering would have a smaller percentage<br />
of women present in their own right as distinct from their<br />
being consorts, we can point out in International<br />
Women's Year that the Government has appointed four women<br />
to the Arbitration Commission, two of them presidential<br />
members. ./ 3 </p>
<p>In the past the development of a proper system<br />
of administrative law in Australia has been sadly lacking.<br />
The independence of the judiciary has been largely an<br />
irrelevant safeguard in the face of increasing areas of<br />
government-regulation that have not been subject toreview<br />
by the ordinary courts. The reports of the Commonwealth<br />
Administrative Review Committee, more commonly known as the<br />
Kerr Committee, and of the Committee on Administrative<br />
Discretions, more commonly known as the Bland Committee,<br />
have highlighted the need to enable administrative decisions<br />
affecting individuals to be reviewed on their merits.<br />
They have also shown the need for an independent body to<br />
ensure that an individual has been dealt with fairly by<br />
the Public Service and by statutory bodies. To satisfy these<br />
needs, the Government has introduced into the Parliament<br />
the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Bill and the<br />
Ombudsman Bill. They have received strong support on both<br />
sides of the Parliament. The Administrative Appeals<br />
Tribunal Bill place's emphasis on expedition and informality<br />
in the hearing of appeals. It will not be confined to the<br />
traditional role of umpire in an adversary dispute.<br />
Nevertheless, it will provide an opportunity for lawyers<br />
to bring their particular skills to bear in ensuring that<br />
statutory discretions are justly and properly exercised.<br />
When I spoke at the last Convention I<br />
stressed that not only must the courts always be accessible<br />
to the people but that the profession must also be accessible<br />
to the people. Perfect laws and well-organised courts are of<br />
little use if those who most need the protection of the law<br />
cannot afford access to the courts. An essential part of<br />
the Government's program of law reform is its development of<br />
systematic and comprehensive legal aid in Australia. A<br />
great deal has been done by the legal profession itself, but<br />
the provision of legal aid to all those who require it is a<br />
task beyond the scope of the legal profession. it<br />
requires the resources of government. The Australian Government<br />
has done three things. We have had a committee of inquiry into<br />
the provision of legal aid in Australia, the report<br />
of which has highlighted the areas of need. We have provided<br />
funds for existing legal aid schemes. We have established<br />
the Australian Legal Aid office as a salaried service to<br />
provide legal aid in areas where the Australian Government<br />
has particular concerns and responsibilities. The<br />
Government introduced the Legal Aid Bill in the last week<br />
of the Autumn Sittings of the Parliament, so that it may<br />
be open to suggestions for improvement. I hope the legal<br />
profession will use the opportunity that has been given<br />
to them to comment on the Legal Aid Bill.<br />
I want to see the continued development of<br />
a vigorous and independent legal profession. The<br />
maintenance of much of our democratic tradition depends<br />
on the strength and integrity of an independent profession<br />
in representing the citizen, whether against another citizen,<br />
a-large corporation or the Executive Government itself.<br />
There is, I know, a real fear that this independence and </p>
<p>traditions may become lost in a salaried legal aid service.<br />
Any lawyer, whether a private practitioner or an employee<br />
of a salaried legal aid service, has a duty to uphold<br />
these traditions. We have sought to embody this in<br />
the Legal Aid Bill. There are many in the community today who<br />
doubt the capacity of the courts and the legal system<br />
to play a useful role in new areas of social and economic<br />
concern. It is not only those with money and property<br />
or those who are engaged in commerce who need lawyers.<br />
Lawyers in the past have been in the forefront<br />
in urging reform of the law. They are in a position to<br />
identify and expose the shortcomings of the law. The<br />
legal profession must be careful to maintain this tradition<br />
in the face of the changing expectations of the people.<br />
Otherwise-they will be seen as conservative defenders<br />
of a system that will become irrelevant if it does not<br />
respond to the dem-and for change. Indeed I go further.<br />
Lawyers applying their talents and skills, should continue<br />
to lead the demand for change and not wait to be pushed<br />
by public opinion. I believe we want a world in which the<br />
rights of citizens, rich or poor, are effectively protected<br />
by a vigorous legal profession; in which the mechanism<br />
of the law remains a primary and effective instrument.<br />
It is easy for the public to feel alienated from the law<br />
and the lawyers.. I suggest that it is up to the Government<br />
and the lawyers to see that this feeling of alienation<br />
is replaced by a recognition of the law as a relevant,<br />
accessible and useful instrument for social and economic<br />
adjustment and for protecting the legitimate expectations<br />
of the individual in an increasingly complex, domestic<br />
and international society. </p>
