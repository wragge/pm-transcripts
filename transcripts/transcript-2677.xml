STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
WILLIAM McMAHON, CH, 14P, IN THE HOUSE<br />
OF REPRESENTATIVES, CANBERRA<br />
ROYAL VISIT SEPTEMBER, 1972<br />
I wish to inform the House that it is being announced today<br />
from Buckingham Palace that The Queen will open the Sydney Opera<br />
House on Saturday 20 October, 1973.<br />
The announcement arises from an invitation which as Prime<br />
Minister of Australia I was most happy to convey to Her Majesty<br />
with the full support and concurrence of the Premier of New South<br />
Wales. Her Majesty's visit will be a short one, limited to a brief<br />
stay in Canberra and then her visit to Sydney. It will follow the<br />
pattern of Royal visits for specific purposes in this case the<br />
opening of the Opera House.<br />
The likely dates are arrival on Wednesday 17 October and<br />
departure on Sunday 21 October.<br />
The opening of the Sydney Opera House will be a great national<br />
and international occasion, and it is fitting that Her Majesty will<br />
be here to perform the ceremony.<br />
I share with the Premier of New South Wales great pleasure<br />
that Her Majesty and The Duke of Edinburgh will visit Australia<br />
for this purpose. I am sure they will be most warmly welcomed. </p>
