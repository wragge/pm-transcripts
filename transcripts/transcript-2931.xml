Press Statement No. 93<br />
21 May 1973<br />
VICTORIAN ELECTIONS<br />
Clyde Holding fought a good clean campaign<br />
and increased Labor's share of the vote since the<br />
1970 election. Labor's candidates polled more votes than<br />
the Liberals, but the boundaries in Victoria have ensured<br />
that the Liberals have won more than-twjice the ' nuiTbbir o6f<br />
seats as the Labor Party.<br />
The real losers in this election have been<br />
the DLP and the Country Party. The DLP vote has fallen<br />
catastrophically. The public have shown what they think<br />
of the reactionary and obstructionist policies of these<br />
parties particularly their efforts to frustrate the<br />
proceedings of the Senate.<br />
Mr. Hamer is the only small Liberal leading<br />
the Liberal Party in any house of parliament in Australia.<br />
I congratulate him, and trust that his Government and mine<br />
will work closely together to give the people of Victoria<br />
a better deal.<br />
