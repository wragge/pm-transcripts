PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 1 May 1977<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen: You will have~ read and<br />
heard lately, expressions of concern) about the worldts<br />
resources of energy producing minerals. The rise in oil<br />
prices around the world has dislocated economies evrerywhere.<br />
Australia has enormous resources of coal and over several<br />
years of exploratio-n and endeavour, we had reached 70% selfsufficiency<br />
in oil needs. Because of the neglect of the<br />
former Administration, this proportion has begun to decline.<br />
Nevertheless, Australia, compared with countries of the Northern<br />
Hemisphere, is still comparatively well off. Tha~ t does not<br />
mean that the Government is not active.<br />
I have asked the Minister for National Resources, Mr Anthony,<br />
to prepare a study of the nation's energy requirements and<br />
resources as a basis for the policy decisions that obviously<br />
will have to be made. That paper will cover resources, the<br />
impact of developing technology, and the nature of research<br />
programmes being carried out with Government funds.<br />
I have also asked Mr Anthony and the Minister for Science,<br />
Senator Webster to cooperate in another study on solar energy<br />
research and development, for, as well as coal, Australia has<br />
plenty of sunshine although not perhaps in Wannon during some<br />
of the winter months.<br />
Apart from our own survey, we are also looking intuo the possibil. ity<br />
of inviting the United States to engage in a cooperative<br />
programme of research into solar energy.<br />
There is another asset which Australia also has in enormous<br />
quantities. We have about 20% of the Western worldts known<br />
quantities, and readily available resources of uranium. At<br />
the time of a world energy shortage, that fact gives Australia<br />
a global responsibility.<br />
Our policies in this area are waiting on the Second and Final<br />
Report of Mr Justice Fox's Environmental Inquiry on Uranium<br />
Mining. We expect that Second Report to be ready early next<br />
month.<br />
Despite the fact that the Government's uranium development<br />
policy remains undecided whilst we wait for the final Fox<br />
Report, the Government has seen from the moment it took<br />
office the need to examine carefully the question of safeguards<br />
on exports of uranium, and the need to support nuclear nonprolif<br />
eration. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
After his report is completed Mr Justice Fox will be travelling<br />
overseas, I have asked him and he has agreed to pursue<br />
inquiries relating to non-proliferation and to report to me<br />
personally on his return. I will regard his advise as important<br />
in enabling the Government to pursue the most effective policy<br />
against proliferation which is a matter of great international<br />
concern no matter what the final report on the mining of uranium.<br />
Soon after President Carter took office I wrote to him giving<br />
him strong assurances of support for strengthened nuclear<br />
non-proliferation. These same assurances were also sent to the<br />
Canadian Prime Minister, Mr Trudeau.<br />
I assured President Carter that we shared their concerns about<br />
the need to support fully the objective of strengthening nuclear<br />
non-proliferation. I informed him that we were aware of the<br />
new thinking that was going on internationally on the need for<br />
adequate controls of the nuclear industry and that Australia would<br />
be requiring stringent controls on any uranium or nuclear material<br />
supplied from Australia.<br />
I stressed that our final decisions would only be taken in the<br />
light of the full reports of Mr Justice Foxts Inquiry,<br />
President Carter responded warmly, saying he was glad to get<br />
my letter of support as he was deeply concerned over the<br />
implications of further nuclear weapons proliferation for<br />
our common security and well-being.<br />
President Carter noted that Australia'ts potential as a major<br />
supplier of uranium gave Australia a particular interest in<br />
the desire to strengthen nuclear non-proliferation and that<br />
Australia could play a vital role with the United States and<br />
Canada in reducing the dangers.<br />
President Carter sought to have further consultations with<br />
Australia. Since that ex change of correspondence, he announced<br />
his Administration's new nuclear policy which is aimed at<br />
strengthening nuclear non-proliferation. Senior officers of<br />
the Department of Foreign Affairs and National Resources are<br />
now in Washington having discussions with the Administration<br />
about the U. S. Nuclear Policy which President Carter announced<br />
on April 7.<br />
In any event, we would only export uranium with the most<br />
stringent and comprehensive safeguards, and strictly for<br />
peaceful non-military purposes. Exports of uranium under these<br />
conditions of tight control and international surveillance,<br />
would strengthen rather than weaken non-proliferation<br />
objectives and so prevent further spread of nuclear weapons.<br />
Countries that are relying on nuclear power receiving<br />
adequate supplies of uranium are more likely to postpone<br />
the use of plutonium as a nuclear fuel.<br />
Whilst awaiting the Final Report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental<br />
Inquiry, the Government has been investigating and developing the<br />
best and most effective safeguards to apply to any future exports<br />
of uranium. Your Government is aware of its obligations and<br />
responsibilities, and will not fail them. </p>
