WEST AUSTRALIAN NUCLEAR HARBOUR STUDY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Australian Government recently invited the Government<br />
of the United States to participate in carrying out a study of the technical<br />
and economic feasibility of using nuclear explosives to blast out a new<br />
deep-water harbour at Cape Keraudren on the northwest coast of Australia.<br />
We have today received an official reply from the United<br />
States Government saying that that Government is prepared to proceed<br />
promptly, with the Australian Government, in carrying out this study<br />
which will, of course, pay full attention to all aspects of safety.<br />
It must be emphasised that all that has been so far decided<br />
is that the feasibility study is to take place, under the direction of the<br />
United States Atomic Energy Commission, and the Australian Atomic<br />
Energy Commission, which two bodies will be put in direct contact with<br />
each other to plan and carry out the study.<br />
It has not yet been decided that the execution of the project<br />
itself will take place. A decision on this must await the completion of<br />
the feasibility study, an examination in the light of the results of that<br />
study of the applicability or otherwise of the limited test ban treaty,<br />
and then a new decision by each Government concerned as to whether<br />
the execution of the project will take place.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government I warmly appreciate<br />
President Nixon's prompt and positive response to our request for<br />
assistance in carrying out this study, and welcome this new expression<br />
of Australian/ American co-operation. Should the explosion itself<br />
eventually occur, it would be a historic development the first practical<br />
application of the atom as a mighty engineering tool for civil construction,<br />
helping to open up new frontiers. All being well, it could be the forerunner<br />
of many other projects for peaceful civil engineering development in<br />
the years ahead. We have already set in motion machinery to speed<br />
the feasibility study and my colleague, the Minister for National<br />
Development ( Mr. David Fairbairn) is announcing details of these measures.<br />
