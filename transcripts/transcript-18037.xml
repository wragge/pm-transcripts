The Prime Minister today joined friends and colleagues to mourn the death of Rob Chalmers, the longest serving member of the Canberra Press Gallery.</p>
<p>As the longest-serving member of the Press Gallery, Rob's name stands alongside the greats such as Alan Reid, Don Whitington and Wal Brown.</p>
<p>Rob first came to the Press Gallery in the old Parliament House in 1951, and since then has reported on countless chapters of Australian political history.</p>
<p>Rob has reported on the Federal Parliament for more than half the period since Federation, having covered 12 Prime Ministers and almost 30 election campaigns. He relished the policy debates that lie at the heart of our democracy and his reputation for insightful and independent political commentary goes unchallenged.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Federal Government I offer my deepest condolences to Rob's family and friends at this difficult time.</p>
<p>Rob will also be greatly missed in the halls of Canberra's Press Gallery where he has been a wise and determined presence for over six decades. </p>
