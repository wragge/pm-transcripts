FOR PRESS: PM Nio. 7/ 1971<br />
SUSPENSION OF INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE OW PLANT<br />
AND EQUIPMENT usED IN MANUFACTURING<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, _ Mr. 12! ha GrtoIn<br />
Parliament will shortly be asked to approve legislation suspending,<br />
as from today, the investment allowance on manufacturing plant and equipment.<br />
The income tax law at present permits a special deduction of 20 per*<br />
cent of capital expenditure on new plant and equipment used in manufacturing the<br />
dedIuction being made from the income of the year in which the plant is first used<br />
or installed for use. This investment allowance is supplementary to the normal<br />
deductions for depreciation; over the scheduled life of the plant or equipment it<br />
results in total deducations for taxation purposes of 120 per cent of the installed<br />
co. 9t of the plant and equipment concerned.<br />
The investment allowance for manufacturing was a concession introduced<br />
in February 1962 at a time of declining employment and slow economic activity.<br />
It was one of a series of measures designed to stimulate demand and it was<br />
particularly directed to encouraging expenditure on equipment and re-equipment<br />
of manufacturing industries,, then at a low ebb. The allowance was extended in<br />
1963 to plant and equipment used in primary production.<br />
In current economic circumstances, with heavy private investment in<br />
non-farm plant and equipment rising at a rate in excess of 20 per cent, it is<br />
inappropriate to continue this special incentive for investment in manufacturing<br />
plant and equipment. Accordingly, the Government has decided to suspend as from<br />
today the operation of section 62AA of the Income Tax Assessment Act which provides<br />
the investment allowance on manufacturing plant and equipment. The decision will<br />
not a-fect the allowance for plant and equipment used in primary production, which<br />
will still apply. The legislation will include some provisions of a transitional nature to<br />
cover plant acquisitions straddling the suspension date. The Government feels<br />
that some transitional provisions should be included to cover expenditure on plant<br />
where the contract for the supply of the plant was entered into on or before today.<br />
Details of the transitional arrangements will be announced later.<br />
