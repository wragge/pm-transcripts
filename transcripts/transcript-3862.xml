Personal Explanation<br />
Medibank is not available in the or that<br />
the patient cannot have the doctor of his choice<br />
in the hospitals of the which of course is<br />
quite false. There is no financial disadvantage to<br />
either of them, if they want private hospital treatment,<br />
in having it in the A. C. T.<br />
I suggest to patients in the A. C. T. that, if at any<br />
time a doctor says that there is no way that they<br />
can get free hospital treatment in the A. C. T. and<br />
then come back to him as private patients after<br />
hospital treatment, they should ask that doctor<br />
what his object is. Is he saying this for medical<br />
reasons and saying that it is in the medical<br />
interests of the patient that he is doing this, or is<br />
he saying it for a political reason? If there is a<br />
political reason he can only say. ' The political<br />
reason is to save you, my patient, the freedom of<br />
choice'. The patient then only has to say: ' I exercise<br />
my freedom of choice by choosing to be a<br />
hospital patient. I choose to be treated by doctors<br />
who co-operate with Medibank'. If the doctor<br />
objects to that, then he is not fair dinkum in his<br />
political objections.<br />
PERSONAL EXPLANATION<br />
Dr JENKINS ( Scullin)-Mr Speaker, I seek<br />
leave to make a personal explanation.<br />
Mr SPEAKER-Does the honourable member<br />
claim to have been misrepresented?<br />
Dr JENKINS-I do. The misrepresentation<br />
occurred in a paragraph written by Cassandra in<br />
the Sunday Telegraph of Sunday, 24 August. The<br />
main points are covered by the following quotation<br />
from that paragraph:<br />
Hawke will stand for the blue-ribbon Melbourne industrial<br />
suburbs seat ofScullin held by old-time Victorian Labor<br />
stalwart-I do not object to that description-<br />
Dr Harry Jenkins. Dr Jenkins is reported to be in bad health<br />
and to have agreed to stand down.<br />
Normally I would disregard such reports, but<br />
these reports are being persistently floated about<br />
myself and other Victorian members. The report<br />
from which I have quoted requires denial and<br />
causes concern in the Scullin electorate and in the<br />
Australian Labor Party itself. To answer the misrepresentation<br />
I point out that when nominations<br />
were called for ALP preselection for Scullin for<br />
the next election mine was the only nomination<br />
received. No requests were received from the<br />
local electorate organisation for preselection<br />
proceedings; so I am endorsed.<br />
At no time has Bob Hawke, any Party official,<br />
or indeed any individual either in or out of the<br />
Labor Party, suggested that I should forgo the<br />
seat in favour of any other person. I have not 26 August 1975 REPRESENTATIVES 491<br />
agreed to stand down. This must be made quite<br />
clear. On a previous occasion when this rumour<br />
circulated Bob Hawke took the trouble to contact<br />
me to assure me that he had had no discussions<br />
on this subject with any person.<br />
Mention of bad health is made in the article.<br />
Many honourable members in this House have<br />
health problems. Here it would be a matter of<br />
definition whether there is misrepresentation.<br />
Industrially I would be classified as physically<br />
handicapped. I suffer a painful condition affecting<br />
the muscles which prevents me from walking<br />
long distances and causes difficulty in climbing<br />
stairs or carrying heavy objects. This has been so<br />
for some 4 years. I have not talked about it. Obviously<br />
with the honour which the House paid me<br />
last week my colleagues consider me capable of<br />
carrying out the arduous duties of a federal<br />
member of Parliament and are willing to entrust<br />
me with further duties. I hope this will give<br />
physically handicapped persons incentive to continue<br />
with their personal endeavours and cause<br />
employers to accept that being physically handicapped<br />
does not consign one to the scrap heap.<br />
Might I add that this building has no facilities<br />
whatever to assist physically handicapped<br />
persons. Mr SPEAKER-It has no facilities, full stop.<br />
PORTUGUESE TIMOR<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
Mr WHITLAM ( Werriwa-Prime Minister)-<br />
by leave-The Government welcomed the<br />
outcome of the talks last May and June in Dili<br />
and Macao between the Portuguese Government<br />
and the principal parties in Portuguese Timor. In<br />
our view, the program mapped out at Macao,<br />
providing for steady forward movement towards<br />
decolonisation and free elections for a constituent<br />
assembly, went a long way towards the<br />
objectives we support for the territory. It also follows,<br />
however, that the Government is most concerned<br />
by the present situation in Portuguese<br />
Timor. What began as a show of force by the<br />
UDT party on 10 August has deteriorated into<br />
virtual civil war with widespread loss of life. The<br />
UDT and the rival Fretilin party are struggling<br />
for power in Dili and in many parts of the<br />
interior. The Timorese police appear to have<br />
sided with UDT, while the much more numerous<br />
military is predominantly for Fretilin.<br />
The polarisation between the 2 groups now<br />
seems to be complete. Both groups are armed<br />
with Portuguese weapons captured at the time of<br />
the initial UDT show of force or having been<br />
taken over to Fretilin or UDT with the defecting </p>
<p>492 REPRESENTATIVES 26 August 1975<br />
troops and police. Apodeti, the party favouring<br />
integration with Indonesia, is not a major participant<br />
in the struggle, although there are some<br />
reports of attacks on its members.<br />
As a result of the evacuation of most of the<br />
Portuguese administration and military, the<br />
Governor now remains in Dill with only a very<br />
small staff and with no chance of exerting control<br />
over more than a small section of Dill The<br />
Governor thus retains no more than the formal<br />
trappings of office. The Portuguese authorities in<br />
a communication to the Secretary-General of the<br />
United Nations have acknowledged that it is<br />
impossible for them to control the situation.<br />
Several days ago the Governor issued an<br />
appeal for international forces to be sent to<br />
Timor to control the situation and to bring an<br />
end to the bloodshed. The Portuguese Government<br />
has also issued appeals for international assistance,<br />
including suggestions that Indonesia<br />
and Australia might help, especially with the<br />
evacuation of Portuguese and foreign nationals<br />
from Timor. Australia has extended considerable<br />
support in various evacuation operations. We<br />
stand ready to take part in any humanitarian<br />
action that may be practicable.<br />
We have been, however, and remain opposed<br />
to Australian military involvement. One of the<br />
first policy decisions of the Government, on<br />
assuming office in December 1972, was to determine<br />
that Australia would not intervene again in<br />
land wars in South East Asia. This applies as<br />
much to the civil war in Portuguese Timor as to<br />
the earlier civil war in Vietnam.<br />
On political aspects of the situation, the<br />
Government has been in close touch with the<br />
other governments most concerned, namely, the<br />
Government of Portugal and the Government of<br />
Indonesia. The Australian Government, however,<br />
does not regard itself as a party principal in<br />
Portuguese Timor. We continue to hold that the<br />
future of the territory is a matter for resolution by<br />
Portugal and the Timorese people themselves<br />
with Indonesia also occupying an important<br />
place because of its predominant interest.<br />
The Government recognises that there are<br />
some who believe that Australia should accept<br />
some political obligation in regard to Portuguese<br />
Timor, and even that Australia should step in<br />
and attempt to arbitrate between the competing<br />
political factions. The Government acknowledges<br />
that those who have put forward these<br />
views have been motivated by genuine feelings<br />
of concern for the welfare of the Timorese. But<br />
the Government does not itself think these views<br />
reflect the best approach forAustralia. It believes Portuguese Timor<br />
that acceptance of these views could lead to a<br />
situation where Australia was exercising a quasicolonial<br />
role in Portuguese Timor, and might<br />
lead to the point where we were assuming some<br />
de facto responsibility for the territory.<br />
But the Government does view with serious<br />
concern the recent turn of events in Portuguese<br />
Timor. The immediate need, of course, is to<br />
bring the fighting to an end. This is both a<br />
necessary pre-condition to any political settlement<br />
as well as an urgent need if the bloodshed<br />
is to stop and relief work is to begin. I take this<br />
opportunity to appeal on behalf of the Australian<br />
Government to all parties engaged in the fighting<br />
to lay down their arms and to end the bloodshed.<br />
I have said that it is not possible to carry<br />
forward relief or rehabilitation without restoration<br />
of order in the territory. The immediate responsibility<br />
for bringing an end to the fighting<br />
must continue to rest with Portugal. In the<br />
Government's view, Portugual cannot simply<br />
wash its hands of Portuguese Timor.<br />
The present situation, of course, may have<br />
passed the point of no-return. In the absence of<br />
firm policies in Lisbon, defections of local<br />
officials and local military forces may now be<br />
complete. Nonetheless, the Government understands<br />
that Portugal is to make an attempt to<br />
retrieve some lost ground by sending a negotiating<br />
team with a view to persuading Fretilin and<br />
UDT to stop fighting and to agree to negotiate<br />
new arrangements among the Timorese parties<br />
for orderly decolonisation. The Portuguese<br />
Government, through Dr Santos, the former<br />
Minister for Interterritorial Co-ordination has<br />
approached the Secretary-General of the United<br />
Nations. The results of this approach are not yet<br />
clear. There have been suggestions that a good<br />
offices committee might be proposed to help mediate<br />
a settlement in Portuguese Timor. But none<br />
of this has gone very far and without some restoration<br />
of basic order in the territory it is not<br />
easy to see how a UN good offices committee,<br />
whose role would be essentially political in<br />
character, could function on the ground. The<br />
same consideration applies to various ideas for<br />
an international humanitarian relief effort.<br />
I return, therefore, to the conclusion that the<br />
first priority is to put an end to the killing and<br />
fighting and to restore order. This objective<br />
requires the active intervention of Portugal itself.<br />
It is a responsibility that cannot be shrugged off<br />
on to others such as Australia. We have no<br />
national obligations or interest in getting reinvolved<br />
in colonial or post-colonial affairs in Portuguese<br />
Timor at the very time when Papua New<br />
Guinea's imminent independence is leading to </p>
<p>Portuguese Timor<br />
the ending of our colonial role there. We have no<br />
ethnic or cultural ties with the Timorese which<br />
would suggest a role for Australia in substitution<br />
for Portugal in Portuguese Timor.<br />
The other interested country in all this is, of<br />
course, Indonesia, with which we have been in<br />
very close touch on developments in Portuguese<br />
Timor in recent days. Indonesia has shared the<br />
Australian concern about the evident drift in<br />
Portuguese policies and, like us, has urged on the<br />
Portuguese the need to reassert Portuguese control<br />
in Portuguese Timor. We, for our part,<br />
understand Indonesia's concern that the territory<br />
should not be allowed to become a source of<br />
instability on Indonesia's border. Portuguese<br />
Timor is in many ways part of the Indonesian<br />
world and its future is obviously a matter of great<br />
importance to Indonesia.<br />
Indonesian policy is to respect the right of the<br />
people of Portuguese Timor to self-determination<br />
and Indonesian leaders have often denied<br />
that Indonesia has any territorial ambitions<br />
towards Portuguese Timor. Nevertheless,<br />
Indonesia's concern about the situation in the<br />
territory has now led her to offer, if Portugal so<br />
requests, to assist in restoring order there. President<br />
Suharto has made it clear that Indonesia<br />
would only wish to act at Portugal's bidding and<br />
that the objective would be the limited one of<br />
restoring conditions which would allow orderly<br />
self-determination to proceed. The Australian<br />
Government has frequently stated its concern<br />
that the people of the territory should be able to<br />
decide their own future.<br />
Whatever external efforts might accomplish,<br />
the hostility, and mistrust between Fretilin and<br />
UDT remain the main threat to future stability in<br />
the territory. This hostility and mistrust indeed<br />
form one of the most disappointing aspects of the<br />
situation in Portuguese Timor. The events of the<br />
last few weeks have dashed the hopes for Portuguese<br />
Timor which followed the change of<br />
government and Portuguese colonial policy in<br />
Lisbon. In a little over a year, the situation in<br />
Portuguese Timor has become a very dangerous<br />
one, mainly-it must be said-because of the<br />
shortsi~ htedness of some of the territory's aspiring<br />
political leaders. It is a matter of record that<br />
none of the three major political groups in the<br />
territory has shown any genuine willingnuess to<br />
work with the others. Each demands that it alone<br />
be recognised as the sole legitimate nationalist<br />
group. None seems prepared to test its claims to<br />
lead the country through any conventional form<br />
of democratic process. 26 August 1975 REPRESENTATIVES 493<br />
At the moment, it is not possible to predict<br />
how events will move or what constructive contribution<br />
Australia may be able to make. Our first<br />
task will be to be alert to opportunities for humanitarian<br />
assistance, but here there are real<br />
questions of practicability. We shall give what<br />
practical help we can to the Portuguese in their<br />
efforts to mediate and to bring an end to the<br />
fightng Irepeat my call to the parties for a<br />
cease-fire and the ending of the bloodshed. As<br />
events develop it may be necessary for me to<br />
keep the House further informed.<br />
