    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government is providing an additional $1.65 million to support sports development programs in Africa and the Pacific.</p>
<p>The Australian Government recognises the important role sport plays in bringing Commonwealth communities together to achieve positive development outcomes.  These programs are increasing community access to and participation in sporting activities, with special emphasis on children, youth, women and people with disabilities.</p>
<p>An additional $1.25 million is being allocated to the Australia South Pacific 2006 Program (ASP2006).  This program has been providing sports development assistance at both the elite and community levels in 14 Pacific countries since 2001.</p>
<p>  ASP 2006 is helping the region';s best athletes prepare for the Melbourne Commonwealth Games in 2006.</p>
<p>An additional $400,000 is being provided to the Australia-Africa Sports Development Program 2006.  Targeting southern Africa, this program is improving the skills of communities and government agencies in developing and implementing sports programs.</p>
