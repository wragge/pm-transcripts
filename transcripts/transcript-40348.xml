    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today marks the second anniversary of the downing of Flight MH17 over the Ukraine.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are with those who grieve the loss of 298 passengers and crew who were murdered on that day two years ago.</p>
<p>We especially remember the 38 passengers who called Australia home.</p>
<p>Their names are etched on a memorial in the gardens of Parliament House, as a permanent reminder of the joy, beauty and wisdom each brought to the world.</p>
<p>It is a reminder that the void they left in the lives of so many is the product of having loved and of having been loved in equal measure.</p>
<p>The memorial is resting in soil which was carried from the Ukraine by an AFP officer from the field where the victims fell.</p>
<p>Today we pay tribute to those who loved them and were loved by them.</p>
<p>In the midst of their grief, they have humbled us with their grace and courage.</p>
<p>They remind us yet again that love is so much stronger than hatred.</p>
<p>We also pay tribute to more than 500 Australian servicemen and women, police and other officers who travelled to the Ukraine and the Netherlands two years ago.</p>
<p>Their professionalism and compassion brought dignity and order to the difficult task of bringing our people home.</p>
<p>We also thank the members of the Joint Investigation Team from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and the Ukraine who are working on the criminal investigation.</p>
<p>Australia continues to work closely with our partner governments to bring to account the perpetrators of this atrocity and to ensure justice for the victims and their families. </p>
<p>As the sunflowers bloom again in this Ukrainian summer, we remember the victims and recommit our love and support to their families and friends. </p>
