SPEECH BY THL PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, IO<br />
PNG OFFICIAL DINNER, PORT MORESBY<br />
7: 35PM FRIDAY, 24 APRIL 1992<br />
Thank you for inviting me here. I am very grateful for the<br />
welcome you have given me, and for the opportunity to<br />
speak to you tonight.<br />
It is 20 years since I first v4sited Papua New Guinea. I<br />
was an Opposition backbencher in the entourage of an<br />
Australian leader who was to leave his mark on the history<br />
of both our countries, Edward Gough Whitlam.<br />
Cough Whitlam was one of those Australians Who had no<br />
difficulty rec6nciling his love of classical European<br />
civilisation and institutions, with a passionate<br />
Australian nationalism and genuine excitement at the<br />
prospect of the countries of this region emerging Into the<br />
world independent and strong.<br />
one of the places he was excited about, of course, was<br />
Papua New Guinea. He was a great believer in this country<br />
and so much that you have done since independence<br />
Justifies his faith.<br />
It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to visit Papua<br />
New Guinea again.<br />
The occasion of this visit, the commemoration of the<br />
sacrifices made by our countrymen and women during the PNC<br />
campaign of World War II, adds to the privilege.<br />
Australia and Papua New Guinea are close neighbours,<br />
enduring friends and partners involved in and benefiting<br />
from the world's most dynamic region.<br />
During the past decade, the economies of North and Southeast<br />
Asia have been expanding at approximately twice the<br />
world average.<br />
Australia and Papua New Guinea are strategically<br />
positioned at the southern reach of this dynamic Asia-<br />
Pacific region.<br />
We both know that we must seize the opportunity. </p>

We both know that we Must engage in the region as never<br />
before. This is why, on my first overseas tour as Prime minister,<br />
I AM Visiting Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.<br />
In Indonesia my object was to restore and enliven the<br />
relationship with a close neighbour which is destined to<br />
play an increasingly dynamic role in the region and the<br />
world, It soems to me that. the degree of our success in building<br />
bridges into Asia and the broader Asia-Pacific might will<br />
be the measure by which future generations will Judge us.<br />
That is Why I say strengthening our regional linkages,<br />
initiating dialogue, multiplying our common interests<br />
through widening our trading relationships these<br />
mneasures will stay true to the interests of the new<br />
generations of Australians.<br />
It will be hard work. it will require imagination and<br />
tenacity. There will be setbacks.<br />
This is an historic opportunity and that for any~<br />
responsible government is the same thing as a necessity.<br />
Like the region around us, both Papua New Guinea and<br />
Australia have changed profoundly since 1975, when you<br />
became independent.<br />
Papua NeJw Guinea has made remarkable progress in building<br />
a nation. You have hold fast to the principles of<br />
parliamentary democracy, social justice and human rights,<br />
which you established for yourselves under your<br />
consti tut ion.<br />
It i* a tribute to thie people of Papua New Guinea, that<br />
the democratic process, in which you are now engaged<br />
again, remains so vigorous and competitive.<br />
But even with your relatively Short constitutional<br />
history, you, like othors of us, have recognised that<br />
constitutions can always be improved. You have<br />
introduced important constitutional reforms designed to<br />
make Papua NeW Guinea's democracy work More effectively.<br />
Your economy has grown and diversified. And you have<br />
taken some difficult decisions under your structural<br />
adjustment program to make your economy more competitive<br />
and to help it cope with the stresses imposed by the<br />
consequence of the Bougainville rebellion.<br />
As a result, real GDP grow by 9 per cent in 1991, an<br />
impressive achievement by any measure.<br />
On the Bougainville situation, I should restate here </p>
<p>Frfs FRE"-i:' OFF ICE c. ipr 92 9 4 tN o. 0C' 55'. CI3<br />
Auttralia's fi. rm belief that the problems on that island,<br />
which is an integral part of Papua Now Guinea, can only be<br />
reeolved by Papua New Guineans themselves.<br />
We hope that that resolution will be achieved peacefully,<br />
because it is only through discussion that reconciliation<br />
Can take place.<br />
Australia has made it clear that we are willing to help<br />
with the reconstruction that will be needed on<br />
Bougainville. In the meantime we have been glad to assist with the<br />
provision of urgently needed medical supplies. We<br />
believe it is important that humanitarian asgistance<br />
continue to reach the people of Bougainville. We want to<br />
worX with the P'apua Now Guinea government to facilitate<br />
such help.<br />
Like Papua New Guinea, Au~ jtralial too, has changed<br />
greatly since you bu~ came independent.<br />
We have shaken off our cultural and 4tconornic torpor.<br />
We have had to undergo sometimes painful economic<br />
restructuring. we have had to transform our industrial and labour<br />
practices.<br />
We have had to overcome our complacency and our<br />
prejudices, and to recast our view of the world and<br />
ourse lves.<br />
Such fundamental changes have had profound implications,<br />
not only for the structure and competitiveness of the<br />
Australian economy, but for the way we engage with our<br />
neighbours. There is perhaps no more telling example of this than the<br />
changing nature of ) Xustralia's relationship with Papua New<br />
Guinea.-That relationship is no longer based on the persistence of<br />
old ties with the colonial past. It is based instead on<br />
the fundamental principles of political and economic<br />
sovereignty and mutual respect articulated in the 1987<br />
Joint Declaration of Principles.<br />
Since the signing of the Joint Declaration of Principles,<br />
our two countries have reached other agreements on trade<br />
and comiiercial relations, security co-operation and<br />
development assistance.<br />
All these agreements share a commn theme: they recognise<br />
the right and need for Papua N4ew Guinea to ta)~ e<br />
responsibility for its own problems, with its own<br />
resources, while signalling Australia's tustained </p>

commuTitment to assisting in the development of Papua New<br />
Guinea's national self-reliance.<br />
One Cf the relationship's strengths is the " habit of<br />
contact" which has developed between us.<br />
Prime Minister* Namaliu has visited Australia twice since<br />
taking off ice, and I am pleased to have so early an<br />
opportunity to visit Papua New Guinea.<br />
The Australia-Papua New Guinea Ministerial Forum has<br />
becom~ e a valuable mechanism for contact between Ministers.<br />
Its broadening agenda now covers regional and bilateral<br />
economic relations, development co-operation, internal and<br />
regional security and the environment.<br />
Our respective Parliaments hiave worked to develop contacts<br />
anld exchanges.<br />
But parliamentary, mininterial even Prime Ministerial<br />
contact is not the sole measure of a relationship.<br />
Contact between Australia and Papua New Guinea has most<br />
importantly been a story of contract between people.<br />
That contact has left on both sides a most important<br />
legacy of understandSng and goodwill.<br />
As I began by saying, one particular aspect of that legacy<br />
is the main reason I am here. I have come to mark the<br />
achievements of Australia's forces in Papua New Guinea<br />
durin7 World War Two, and of the Papua New Guineans, both<br />
in uniform and out, who assisted them.<br />
That asbistance hats left an enduring mark on our<br />
relationship. Quite literally, Papuians and New Guineans<br />
helped to save Australia in 1942.<br />
The Australian and PNG media have recently carried reports<br />
about unresolved compcensation claims for some of the PNG<br />
carriers who assisted Australian forces in the PNG<br />
campaign. I under~ tand that. this issue was discussed by the<br />
Australian~ and PNG Governments during the 1980s.<br />
Australia agreed with the PHO proposal that the PNG<br />
Government be responsible for handling any outstanding<br />
claims. The Australian Government, therefore, feels it should not<br />
intrude unilaterally into this issue. At the same time,<br />
considering the invaluable contribution the PNG carriers<br />
made to tho war effort, we are not happy if genuine claims<br />
for compensation have not been dealt with.<br />
We suggest the best approach Is for the P140 Government to<br />
advise us if there are any outstanding aspects of this<br />
issue that we need to reconsider together. </p>
<p>r . M's FPRESS OFFICE 25 Apr .92-9i tNCoJ. C3L5 F. C'<br />
The Australian Government's basic position is that all<br />
worthy claims for compensation should be treated<br />
Sympathatically on their Perits.<br />
I will be discussing this issue with Prime Minister<br />
N&amp; maliu tomorrow.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, even now, over 11,000 Australians<br />
live and work in Papua New Guinea, helping to contribute,<br />
like many before them, to Papua New Guinea's development.<br />
Many Papua New Guineans, including Several ministers in<br />
the present Cabinet, have received part of their education<br />
and training in Australia.<br />
This people-to-people contact underpinis an expanding<br />
economic partnership. Two-way trade in 1991 reached a<br />
record $ 1.7 billion, or more than 1.2 billion kina. This.<br />
was a 48 per cent incroase over the preceding year. Our<br />
trade is now roughly in balance.<br />
Investment is another im~ portant dimenuion of the economic<br />
partnership. Australian investment in Papua New Guinea<br />
now exceeds $ 1.5 billion. A further $ 3 billion in<br />
investment is in prospect over the next 5 years.<br />
Continued economic growth in Papua New Guinea will bring a<br />
further expansion of two-way trade as the demand for<br />
imports to underpin productive investment accelerates.<br />
T believe there is a need to look again at the framework<br />
of our bilateral economic relationship.<br />
Although partially revised in 1991, the Papua New Guinea-<br />
Australia Trade and Commercial Relations Agreement of 1977<br />
has become increasingly limited and anachronistic. We<br />
need to examine wider, more reciprocal arrangements which<br />
would more accurately raflect the changing nature of our<br />
economic relationship and the economic realities of our<br />
region. Thre n ore. Eressin? groblem for Papua New Quinea<br />

it so well, Prime Minister, without security, economic<br />
development cannot proceed, and without development,<br />
security cannot be guaranteed.<br />
Austral. ia remains committed tv security and defence cooperation<br />
with Papua New Guinea. The Agreed Statement on<br />
Security Co-operation signed last year by Prime Minister<br />
Hawke underscores that commitment.<br />
out more work needa to be done Le ensure this cooperation<br />
is fully effective. In particular. Papua New Guinea needs<br />
to develop an integrated and comprehensive approach to<br />
security force reform and rosource allocation.<br />
The nature of Austraulia's development assistance to Papua<br />
Now Guinea is also evolving. </p>

Our two Covarnments are agreed that by the year 2000, all<br />
Australian aid currently worth around $ 300 Million a<br />
year will be jointly programmed to meet specific needs.<br />
Our aid program~ will assist Papua New Guinea develop<br />
effective and long-lasting solutions to its problems. it<br />
is designed to help you strengthen the institutions upon<br />
which your country's future depends.<br />
Ultimately, however, the solutions will have to be your<br />
Own.<br />
A self-reliant Papua New Guinea will be better placed to<br />
realise its aspirations and potential as a nation.<br />
We in Australia are confident that the people of Papua New<br />
Guinea have the will and the capabilities to meet the<br />
challenges before you. Those challenges will demand<br />
adaptability, patience, careful planning and<br />
determination. But your country has already demonstrated<br />
all those qualities.<br />
Augtraliant, to an unprecedented degree, have begun to see<br />
their interests and their future as lying in the region.<br />
Papua N~ ew Guineans are doing the same.<br />
Without abandoning your l. inks to the South Pacific, you<br />
have become an observer at ASEAN meetings. You have<br />
consolidated a close relationship with our mutual<br />
neighbour, Indonesia. Your economic ties with Asia are<br />
becoming closer.<br />
You are well placed to act as a successful bridge between<br />
ASEAN and the South Pacific Forum.<br />
I am convinced that neither of us need fear the effects of<br />
greater engagement with the region around us.<br />
The snore we are able to open up our economies, and our<br />
minds, to the outside world, the 1better and more rewarding<br />
will be the quality of our own enduring links. </p>
