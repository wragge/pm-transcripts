    <content><![CDATA[<p> The Federal Government will inject an extra $915 million over</p>
<p> five years into the public health systems of the Australian States</p>
<p> and Territories.</p>
<p> The provision of these additional funds are conditional on the States</p>
<p> and Territories which have not yet signed Australian Health Care Agreements</p>
<p> indicating their willingness to do so by 28th August. Queensland</p>
<p> and the Australian Capital Territory have already reached agreement</p>
<p> with the Commonwealth.</p>
<p> Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory</p>
<p> have already indicated their willingness to sign Australian Health</p>
<p> Care Agreements as a consequence of the new offer made by the Commonwealth.</p>
<p> I am confident that New South Wales will also indicate its willingness</p>
<p> to sign up by 28th August.</p>
<p>  Resolving this funding impasse will lead to significant improvements</p>
<p> in the quality, accessibility and flexibility of our National Health</p>
<p> Care systems.</p>
<p>  The States and the Northern Territory had been seeking a $5.5 billion</p>
<p> lift in funding over five years.</p>
<p>  In discussions over recent weeks it became apparent that a mutually</p>
<p> acceptable resolution could be reached if the Commonwealth was prepared</p>
<p> to slightly increase the base funding for public hospitals and to</p>
<p> provide more flexibility in how our offer was structured.</p>
<p>  Accordingly the Commonwealth has been prepared to increase the five-year</p>
<p> funding by an additional $915 million taking the full five-year allocation</p>
<p> to $31.34 billion compared to $23.4 billion provided under the 1993-98</p>
<p> Labor Medicare Agreements.</p>
<p> This amounts to an increase in real funding for the States and Territories</p>
<p> of 10.2% in 1998-99 and 17.6% over the five years compared to 1997-98.</p>
<p> Under the revised offer, base funding for the States and Territories</p>
<p> will be increased by an additional $200 million in 1998-99 ($1.1 billion</p>
<p> over five years) over and above the funding already being provided</p>
<p> under the agreements already accepted by Queensland and the ACT, or</p>
<p> through specific purpose payments to the remaining jurisdictions.</p>
<p>  This will bring the total increase in the Commonwealth's funding</p>
<p> under the Australian Health Care Agreements, over and above any amount</p>
<p> already included in the forward estimates, to $3.834 billion over</p>
<p> five years.</p>
<p>  Fulfilling commitments I have previously given to Queensland and the</p>
<p> ACT, both jurisdictions will share proportionally in the additional</p>
<p> increase in the base funding to be provided under the Australian Health</p>
<p> Care Agreements.</p>
<p>  Of the additional base funding, $850 million is new money agreed by</p>
<p> the Commonwealth, with the remaining $250 million being transferred</p>
<p> into base funding from the National Health Development Fund.</p>
<p>  The funding available for infrastructure projects through the National</p>
<p> Health Development Fund will consequently be reduced from $500 million</p>
<p> to $250 million over five years.</p>
<p> The Commonwealth has also agreed to funding totaling around $65 million</p>
<p> for State and Territory specific health priority projects.</p>
<p>  The $680 million to be provided over five years for initiatives designed</p>
<p> to improve quality and safety, and the funding provided for mental</p>
<p> health and palliative care, remain unchanged.</p>
<p> The Commonwealth has also reiterated its commitment to compensate</p>
<p> the States and Territories for any further decline in the level of</p>
<p> private health insurance coverage.</p>
<p>  These new agreements are historic in the sense that they address critical</p>
<p> reform priorities such as quality and safety; improve the flexibility</p>
<p> of funding so that we can provide better care in a range of settings</p>
<p> other than acute hospitals; maintain our commitment to mental health</p>
<p> and palliative care; and lay the foundation for long-term infrastructure</p>
<p> needs.</p>
<p>  This will lead to further innovation in the way that services are</p>
<p> provided, with greater ability for health care providers to meet individual</p>
<p> needs and provide care in the most appropriate setting, and will strengthen</p>
<p> our ability to meet growing demand while preserving world-class standards</p>
<p> of clinical excellence.</p>
<p> The fine detail of each bilateral agreement will be finalised by Dr</p>
<p> Wooldridge and the State and Territory Health Ministers.</p>
<p> As the Tasmanian Government is in caretaker mode a formal agreement</p>
<p> cannot be signed until after the August 29th election.</p>
