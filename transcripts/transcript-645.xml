THE COMMONWEALTH AND EDUCATION<br />
Tabled in the House of Representatives<br />
by the Right Honourable the Prime Minister<br />
on 6th November, 1962.<br />
Australia, in common with most other countries of the world, has<br />
seen, since the Second World War, an increased interest in and demand for<br />
formal education. Technical and economic progress depends upon highly trained<br />
personnel. The values in which democracy places its faith require opportunities<br />
for the balanced personal and social development of each citizen. The<br />
character and quality of our educational institutions are of concern to us all.<br />
The most obvious aspect of the educational expansion in Australia<br />
has been the unprecedented increase since the War in educational enrolments.<br />
In the decade from 1951 to 1960 enrolments in all schools at primary and<br />
secondary level increased by 65% o. During the same period, university<br />
enrolments increased by 76% o. Technical colleges and teachers' colleges<br />
have shown similar expansion.<br />
Along with this phenomenal increase in numbers has been a general<br />
diversification of educational provision. Changes are occurring in the<br />
structure of secondary education. Technical colleges and universities are<br />
introducing new courses. The ground to be covered in scientific studies is<br />
continually expanding. Awareness of Australia's place in the world at large<br />
and in relation to South-East Asia is leading to new emphases in studies in<br />
the humanities. Provision has now to be made to educate in our schools,<br />
technical colleges and universities large numbers of students from overseas.<br />
Higher standards are being attained, more children are going further in<br />
secondary education, higher proportions are being educated at university<br />
level, more post-graduate studies are being undertaken. All of these<br />
trends are exerting considerable pressures on our education system.<br />
Not surprisingly, these important developments are associated<br />
with greater and greater demands on the resources of governments, although<br />
private organisations, the churches, industry arid the individual citizen<br />
are all making valuable contributions. It is on the State Governments<br />
that the main burden falls since, under the Australian Constitution, the<br />
prime responsibility for education rests with the States.<br />
In 1960, 1,600,000 of the 2,100,000 children attending primary<br />
and secondary schools in the six States of Australia were attending government<br />
schools. This was 65%/ more children than were in these government schools<br />
ten years earlier. Part of this increase has been due to the fact that a<br />
greater percentage of children now stay at school longer but, in the main,<br />
the increase has been due to population growth, chiefly by natural increase,<br />
although the arrival of immigrants has contributed a significant share.<br />
Clearly, to provide for these extra numbers, more classrooms have<br />
been needed and more teachers have had to be engaged and trained. The States<br />
have responded to this challenge. Their school building programmes have been<br />
greatly accelerated, new teachers' colleges have been established and the<br />
teaching force greatly augmented. The costs of this expansion have been<br />
considerable and some figures comparing expenditure on various aspects of<br />
education in 1950-51 and in 1960-61 illustrate the rate of increase. In<br />
total, the States between them found it necessary to spend about œ 9184 million<br />
on education in 1960-61 compared with about œ E46 million in 1950-51, a fourfold<br />
increase. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
It is not the purpose of this document to detail the work done<br />
in education by the States or by other bodies. The States themselves are<br />
better able to do this. Its purpose is rather to draw attention to the<br />
fact that the Commonwealth Government, too, is deeply interested in<br />
education and contributes a great deal in one way or another towards its<br />
financial support. It is recognised that education is a matter of great social<br />
importance and that there can be no richer investment than the intellectual<br />
and social development of our future citizens. It is also recognised that<br />
our educational costs must continue to grow with the healthy growth in our<br />
population and with the increasing demands for more highly trained personnel.<br />
But the fact that a matter is important to the nation does not mean that it<br />
should become primarily the responsibility of the Federal Government. Under<br />
the Australian Constitution, some matters are the responsibility of the<br />
Federal Government and some are the responsibility of the State Governments.<br />
Education is a matter that falls in the States' sphere of responsibility,<br />
not because of any lack of importance but because it is believed that State<br />
Governments are in a better position to assess local needs and provide for<br />
them. The proper role of the Commonwealth in this matter is to co-operate<br />
with the States, but not to take over their functions. Where the Commonwealth's<br />
responsibilities in other directions have involved it in some<br />
educational or training programme, it has tended wherever possible to make<br />
use of existing State facilities rather than establish institutions of its<br />
own. This is. as it should be.<br />
So far as financial support is concerned, the Commonwealth's<br />
approach has been to build up the States' general financial resources. In<br />
this way, funds that are provided federally are spent on education, no less<br />
so than they would if they were given as direct grants for this purpose.<br />
The difference is that, as things are, the States decide the purposes.<br />
The year 1960-61 may be taken as an example. In that year<br />
expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Funds of the States ( excluding<br />
expenditure on business undertakings) totalled almost œ 537 million. Of<br />
this amount approximately œ E279 million ( or 52%) came from Commonwealth<br />
general revenue grants previously known as tax reimbursement grants<br />
and special grants made by the Commonwealth on the recommendation of the<br />
Commonwealth Grants Commission. This means that for every œ E spent by the<br />
States about 10/ 5d. came from general revenue grants. In 1960-61 the<br />
combined State expenditure on education ( excluding expenditure on research,<br />
art and cultural activities) was about œ E142 million. Thus, on the basis<br />
of 10/ Sd. in the a total of about œ 74 million was money provided through<br />
Commonwealth channels.<br />
The other main component of the States' expenditure on education<br />
is in respect of buildings. This expenditure is derived from the Loan<br />
Funds available to the States for works and other purposes. In 1960-61<br />
the States' gross expenditure from Loan Funds was about œ E215 million and<br />
of this about œ E42 million ( or 20% o) was spent on buildings for education.<br />
Again it needs to be remembered that the Commonwealth has directly assisted<br />
the loan market to assure the States of a total works programme which might<br />
be regarded as reasonable. The Commonwealth assistance to this programme in<br />
1960-61 ( excluding amounts provided for expenditure under the Commonwealth<br />
State Housing Agreement) amounted to about œ E57 million ( or 26% o of the total).<br />
On this basis it might be said that the States' Loan Fund expenditure,<br />
including that on education, was assisted by the Commonwealth to the extent<br />
of 5/ 2d. in the This meant that the Commonwealth supported the States'<br />
Loan Fund expenditure on education to the extent of some œ 11l million. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
What has been said above applies to State expenditure on<br />
universities, just as to any other educational expenditure. But in the<br />
case of universities it does not end there. The Commonwealth, in addition,<br />
makes grants to the States specifically for university purposes. In 1950-<br />
51 the Commonwealth began its present scheme of grants to the States for their<br />
universities. In that year the total of these grants was œ E. 5 million; in<br />
1960-61 the total was over œ. 11 million. Over the same ten-year period<br />
State expenditure on universities has also greatly increased: from<br />
million in 1950-51 to œ E17 million in 1960-61. If the Commonwealth had not<br />
given special support, the maintenance of the present scale of operation of<br />
universities would have involved the States in much greater expenditure on<br />
universities, possibly at the expense of other fields of education.<br />
Apart from assistance provided for State universities, the<br />
Commonwealth maintains the Australian National University in Canberra.<br />
Expenditure for running costs and for capital works for this institution<br />
amounted in 1960-61 to over million. There are other ways in which<br />
the Commonwealth assists universities. For example, the Commonwealth maintains<br />
the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at the University<br />
of Sydney and, in a number of other ways, supports university research and<br />
teaching in particular fields.<br />
Commonwealth commitments in the university field seem likely to<br />
increase. The extent of Commonwealth assistance was greatly increased in<br />
1958, arising out of the financial recommendations of the Committee on<br />
Australian Universities ( the Murray Committee). For the years 1961 to 1963<br />
the grants are in accordance with the financial recommendations of the<br />
Australian Universities Commission, the body set up by the Commonwealth as<br />
a result of the recommendations of the Murray Committee. A special committee<br />
was established, in connection with the Australian Universities Commission,<br />
to look into the needs of teaching hospitals, which are a fundamental part<br />
of the training programme of medical students. As a result of the<br />
recommendations of this committee, the Commonwealth has agreed to support,<br />
on a œ E for 1 basis, certain capital expenditure at teaching hospitals<br />
incurred because of their responsibility for training medical students.<br />
The question of support for recurrent expenditure is still under consideration.<br />
The Commonwealth has also set up a committee, again in association with the<br />
Universities Commission, to inquire into the needs of tertiary education in<br />
Australia. Its report is expected during 1963.<br />
Support for universities is only part of the assistance given by<br />
the Commonwealth to the training in Australia of able students at the tertiary<br />
level. The other main segment of this assistance is the provision of<br />
scholarships to enable these students to undertake their courses. In 1961<br />
nearly 13,000 such students were receiving benefits as Commonwealth Scholarship<br />
holders. Under the Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme, which is controlled<br />
by the Commonwealth Scholarships Board, 4,000 new awards are given each year<br />
entitling the holder to the payment of compulsory fees and, subject to a<br />
means test, to a living allowance. That upwards of 17,000 young people have<br />
completed higher training with the help of this Scheme is of great importance<br />
for a community which has so many calls for highly trained men and women.<br />
The need does not stop at first degree level and this fact is recognised by<br />
giving strong encouragement to outstanding students to prepare themselves<br />
for more specialised work. This is done by means of a scheme of postgraduate<br />
awards which now enables more than 250 distinguished graduates to<br />
undertake higher studies in our universities. The Commonwealth Scholarship<br />
Scheme began in 1950-51 at a cost to the Budget of œ 9.4 million, whereas </p>
<p>-4<br />
expenditure in 1960-61 on Commonwealth Scholarships, including post-graduate<br />
awards, exceeded œ E2.6 million. Other schemes are provided by the Commonwealth<br />
to assist former members of the defence services, and the children of deceased<br />
and permanently and totally incapacitated ex-members of the defence services.<br />
There are Commonwealth grants to various professional organisations<br />
which carry out training programmes in their own fields, such as the Colleges<br />
of Nursing and Associations of Occupational Therapy. Some of these grants<br />
are on a matching basis with those of the States.<br />
All this, of course, is apart from the many institutions and<br />
training programmes at the tertiary level which the Commonwealth maintains<br />
for its own employees, such as the defence services educational establishments<br />
and those of the Public Service.<br />
The Commonwealth has a direct responsibility in the fields of<br />
primary and secondary education insofar as its own territories are concerned.<br />
In some of these the service is provided by State Departments of Education<br />
on the basis of the Commonwealth paying the costs. There are school services,<br />
parallel to those in Australian States, in operation in the Australian Capital<br />
Territory and the Northern Territory; in the latter case there are, in<br />
addition, Commonwealth schools for aboriginal children who have not yet<br />
reached the standard for admission to the normal schools. In the Territory<br />
of Papua and New Guinea, and in the Northern Territory too, where education<br />
has the fundamental task of bridging the gap between a primitive and a<br />
modern culture, the education programme depends partly on the help of the<br />
Christian missions, who are given financial assistance towards the work they<br />
undertake. In some of the external territories, especially Papua and New<br />
Guinea, part of the educational cost is borne by the local revenues. In<br />
all, however, primary, secondary and technical education in the various<br />
Commonwealth Territories, internal and external, is costing the Commonwealth<br />
almost œ E5 million a year.<br />
An important contribution to primary and secondary education is<br />
made by the Australian Broadcasting Commission which provides radio and<br />
television programmes for schools. This is an example of the way in which<br />
a Commonwealth authority is working in close relationship with State Education<br />
Departments, and with advice of their officers, to supplement in an important<br />
way what is being done in schools. These programmes, together with University<br />
of the Air, are handled by a special department within the Commission.<br />
Expenditure on these activities amounted to over œ E280,000 in 1960/ 61. Not<br />
only the University of the Air but the general broadcasting activities of<br />
the Commission undoubtedly contribute a great deal to the education of adults<br />
in the community. Another way in which the Commonwealth has helped adult<br />
education is by its continued financial support of " Current Affairs Bulletin"<br />
by way of an annual grant for this purpose made to the University of Sydney.<br />
Children who come to this country as migrants receive, as they<br />
are entitled to do, appropriate education in the schools of the State in<br />
which they live. However, an important aspect of the assimilation of<br />
adult migrants in Australia an adequate grasp of the English language and<br />
introduction to Australian ways of life is provided with the co-operation<br />
of the States on the basis of the Commonwealth bearing the costs. These<br />
migrants are encouraged to study on the voyage to Australia, and, after<br />
arrival, in evening classes which are set up wherever there is a need for<br />
them. Correspondence lessons and radio programmes are also provided.<br />
Australia ' is vitally concerned with the Colombo Plan Technical<br />
Co-operation Scheme. Since this Scheme began, some 4,000 overseas students </p>
<p>have come to Australia for training and, in addition, Australia is furnishing<br />
experts and equipment to other countries. At the 30th June, 1961, over 900<br />
Colombo Plan students were studying here. In addition, over 1,800 students<br />
were studying in their own countries under a correspondence scholarship<br />
scheme. Several other schemes supplementary to the Colombo Plan are in<br />
operation, including the Australian International Awards, the Asian Visits<br />
Fund, the Korean Training Scheme, SEATO Aid, and, since 1961-62, the Special<br />
Commonwealth African Assistance Plan.<br />
A major recent development is the British Commonwealth Scheme for<br />
Educational Co-operation, part of which is a Commonwealth Scholarship and<br />
Fellowship Plan under which Australia offers 100 awards, mainly for postgraduate<br />
study. There are also other awards offered to educationists from<br />
the newer countries of the Commonwealth. As with the Colombo Plan, there<br />
is provision -of experts in the educational field. This is not a one-way<br />
traffic. Australia, herself, benefits substantially under this Scheme since<br />
already no fewer than 82 Australians have been able to accept awards for<br />
study in universities in other Commonwealth countries.<br />
In connection with the United Nations Expanded Programme of<br />
Technical Assistance, Australia provides training programmes for some students<br />
holding United Nations awards. In 1961, over 80 students studied in Australia<br />
under this programme. An interesting recent development in connection with Australia's<br />
international educational interests is the broadcasting by Radio Australia<br />
of English lessons for Indonesians, using material prepared by the Commonwealth<br />
Office of Education. By the end of 1961 more than 120,000 requests<br />
for regular lesson booklets were being met.<br />
Australia's membership of Unesco involves it not only in an annual<br />
contribution to the organisation but also in associated activities in Australia<br />
of educational and cultural importance. Many regional and national seminars<br />
have been held, and valuable studies and publications have been sponsored.<br />
These have been developed by the co-operation of a wide cross section of<br />
interests in the Australian community and have stimulated developments in<br />
important educational and related fields.<br />
It is not easy to draw a hard and fast line between purely<br />
educational activities and those such as the National Library of Australia<br />
which, while having an educational role, have, at the same time, a more<br />
broadly cultural significance. Grants are made to such organisations as<br />
the Commonwealth Literary Fund and the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust.<br />
This kind of assistance extends to learned societies, such as the various<br />
historical societies and the Australian Academy of Science. Research<br />
activities are also assisted, as, for example, those of the Social Science<br />
Research Council. Cultural and community activities in Commonwealth<br />
territories are extensively assisted. However, the costs associated with<br />
this wide variety of activities have not here been included as educational<br />
costs. It should not be forgotten that the Commonwealth encourages<br />
education by granting certain taxation concessions. An example of this<br />
is the deduction allowed for income tax purposes for expenses incurred<br />
( to a maximum of œ 100O) in connection with the full-time education of children<br />
under 21 years of age, estimated to cost the revenues of the Commonwealth<br />
about œ E14 million a year. A further concession is the deduction allowed<br />
for each dependent child between the ages of 16 and 21 years who is receiving<br />
full-time education at a school, college or university. This is estimated<br />
to cost revenue about œ 9750,000 a year. </p>
<p>6<br />
It could justly be claimed that the scope of Commonwealth<br />
educational assistance is even wider. The expansion of knowledge is<br />
one of the two main activities of the universities, and is carried on<br />
co-extensively with teaching. However, there are some Commonwealth<br />
instrumentalities which are sharing, with the universities, this<br />
exploration of the fields of human knowledge, often in close association<br />
with the universities. Amongst these are the Commonwealth Scientific<br />
and Industrial Research Organisation, the Atomic Energy Commission, the<br />
Bureau of Mineral Resources, and the research establishments connected<br />
with the defence services. Expenditure on these organisations by the<br />
Commonwealth is almost œ 30 million a year.<br />
The Table at the end of this statement sets out, for the<br />
financial year 1960-61 and, where available at the present time, for the<br />
financial year 1961-62, the expenditure of the Commonwealth Government<br />
which is clearly educational. It does not include science and scientific<br />
research, mentioned above, nor does it include cultural activities, general<br />
broadcasting and television services, the provision of milk for school<br />
children, or training activities carried out by the Commonwealth for its<br />
own purposes. These activities between them would, if included, account<br />
for more than an additional œ 46 million. Again, the cost to Commonwealth<br />
revenue of taxation concessions in relation to education has not been<br />
included. Leaving these aside, however, it will be seen that, in 1960-61,<br />
apart from the œ B5 million which the Commonwealth may be said to have contributed<br />
to the States' expenditure on education, the Commonwealth itself<br />
in that year spent over œ 26 million directly on education. The amount<br />
which the Commonwealth may be said to have contributed to the States'<br />
expenditure on education in 1961-62 is not at present available, but, as<br />
the attached Table shows, direct Commonwealth expenditure on education in<br />
that year increased to approximately œ 33 million.<br />
It will be seen, from what has been written above and from<br />
the tabulation which follows, that, despite the fact that education is<br />
primarily a State responsibility, the Commonwealth is making a very<br />
substantial contribution to educational expenditure in this country. </p>
