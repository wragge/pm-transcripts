FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 16 MAY 1982<br />
TASMANIAN ELECTION RESULT<br />
Many congratulations to Robin Gray and all Tasmanian<br />
Liberals especially to Ian Chalk for establishing<br />
a tight organisational wing of the Liberal Party<br />
in Tasmania.<br />
They ran a great campaign and achieved a great<br />
result. The election is a massive endorsement<br />
of Robin Gray and a united Liberal Party and I am<br />
looking forward to working with Robin Gray as<br />
Premier in Tasmania.<br />
Robin Gray has claimed victory with the highest<br />
recorded Liberal vote and Tasmanians can look<br />
ahead to the future with confidence under<br />
dynamic and stable Liberal Government. This election<br />
result is a tremendous encouragement to Liberals<br />
everywhere as Bass was in 1975.<br />
The Labor Party has been put through the shredder. </p>
