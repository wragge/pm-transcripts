BRITISH WHITE PAPFL ON DEFENCE<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
The principal decisions relating to British defence policy east<br />
of Suez now announced in the British, Government's White Paper on Defence<br />
have been the subject of consideration by the Australian Cabinet.<br />
My visit to London in June this year was, of course, primarily<br />
to discuss these important issues w-: h Mr Wilson and other senior members<br />
of his Cabinet. Mr Wilson and Mi: * e. rs also held talks with the Prime<br />
Ministers of Malaysia and Singapor-arid also with the New Zealand Deputy<br />
Prime Minister, who was represenr!:;-Mr Holyoake. Consultations also<br />
took place with the United States Administration.<br />
These discussions were clearly desirable since it is not only<br />
British interests that are affected by the decisions taken.<br />
The VWhite Paper sets forward a number of decisions and states<br />
plans or planning intentions. It is important that it should be seen in full<br />
perspective. The decisions and the plans will be phased over a considerable<br />
period of years running into the mid-7C's.<br />
There will first be a reduction of British forces deployed in<br />
Singapore and Malaysia between now and 1970/ 71 to about half current levels.<br />
We have for some time assumed that some reduction would occur. British<br />
forces in Malaysia and Singapore were increased at the time of confrontation<br />
and we have recognised throughout that this increase would, as occasion<br />
permitted, be reversed and the level of forces reduced. There are, however,<br />
reductions proposed over the next few years going conside. rably beyond our<br />
earlier expectations. Beyond 197C/ 71, the United Kingdom Government plans would,<br />
as they stand, lead to total withdrawal of British forces from their bases in<br />
Malaysia and Singapore some time in the mid-1970' s. By then Britrii proposes<br />
to have reorganized its armed forces about a highly mobile strategic reserve.<br />
But it has clearly stated that it cannot plan beyond 1970/ 71 in the same detail<br />
as for the period up to that time, and the precise timing of the w'thdrawal from<br />
the mainland will depend on progress made in achieving a new basis of<br />
stability in South-East Asia and in resolving other problems in the Far East.<br />
This is an important element in British Government intentions. It indicates<br />
that Britain will play a continuing military role in the area.<br />
This intention is again illustrated by the plan announced in the<br />
White Paper, to maintain a military capability for use in the area if required,<br />
even after withdrawal from mainland bases. Further Britain undertakes in<br />
the White Paper to continue to honour obligations under SEATO and obligations<br />
under the Anglo-Malaysian Defence Agreement. The Australian Government<br />
welcomes these particular policy decisions.<br />
The British people have made a notable and indeed historic<br />
contribution to the establishment of stability and security in the Malaysia/<br />
Singapore region since the Second World War, and, in our view, Britain can<br />
a till play a role no other country ' s so well qualified to play. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Some aspects of the British Government's announcement, of<br />
course, are disappointing to us. ' Ile do not overlook the economic problems<br />
with which Britain is at present contenft": mg, and the substantial savings in<br />
defence expenditure, including expenziiure overseas, which its Government<br />
believes to be necessary. Neither do we overlook the British view that the<br />
requirement to station large forces in bases in Malaysia and Singapore will<br />
lessen as those countries, over the next decade, increase their own military<br />
capacities. But even so, we very mxth regret that the British Government<br />
should feel itself impelled to plan now for final withdrawal from Malaysia and<br />
Singapore at a date so far ahead, and when it is so diff icult to predict how the<br />
situation in South-East Asia will move.<br />
One of the principal aspects of my discussions with Mr W~ ilson<br />
was to urge that his Government retain as much flexibility in its forward<br />
planning as was possible. His Government has felt it necessary to set out<br />
a plan for withdrawal. It has explained its reasons for this, It has given<br />
recognition to the need to have the precise timing of the further moves beyond<br />
19,70/ 71 towards withdrawal from the bases depend upon progress made towards<br />
stability in South-East Asia and on other factors in the Far East. We attach<br />
considerable importance to this.<br />
The British announcement carries implications which obviously<br />
must form part of the continuing review we make of our defence policy and<br />
planning. The WI-hite Paper mentions the possible use by Britain of facilities<br />
in Australia. This flows out of the discussions which Mr Healey, the British<br />
Mlfister for Defence, had in Canberra early last year with the Australian<br />
Cabinet. The examination of these pos sbi lities, including feasibility studies,<br />
has been conducted at Service level. This examination will be continued.<br />
I would add that I have maintained personal contact with<br />
Mr Holyoake, the Tunku Abdul Rahman and Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and our frank<br />
and constructive exchanges with them and also with the British and American<br />
Governments in relation to these matters will also continue.<br />
