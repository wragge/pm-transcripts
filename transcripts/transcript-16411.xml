    <content><![CDATA[<p>I'm Tanya Plibersek - the Minister for Housing.</p>
<p>Australia is facing the deepest global recession since World War 2.</p>
<p>We need to act decisively and urgently.</p>
<p>That is why our Nation Building and Jobs Plan includes an historic $6.4 billion to build new homes for Australians who are doing it really tough.</p>
<p>We will build 20,000 new social housing dwellings over the next three years.</p>
<p>We will also repair and upgrade around 2 Â½ thousand run down homes to make them liveable again.</p>
<p>This is the biggest single investment in social housing this country has ever seen.</p>
<p>It will make a huge difference to people's lives -  like the 28,000 pensioners who are in the private rental market paying half of their pensions in rent;  like the 16,000 Australians who are sleeping rough every night; and the thousands of women and children leaving homes where there is domestic violence.</p>
<p>Just before Christmas we pledged to halve homelessness by 2020.  This package is an important step towards making that happen.  </p>
<p>It also builds on our previous housing measures - the first home owners boost, the National Rental Affordability Scheme and others.</p>
<p>This $6.4 billion package meets a number of needs  -  it will help homeless Australians and people struggling to keep a roof over their heads.</p>
<p>It will bring growth and reform to social housing and it will also help keep our economy strong by boosting building and construction.</p>
