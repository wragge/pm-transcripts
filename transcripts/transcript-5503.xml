OPENING OF THE NATIONAL INDOOR SPORTS CENTRE<br />
AND THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF SPORT<br />
Australians have often done very well in world competition.<br />
They have shown great talent as individuals and they have..<br />
been great coaches. We had done so well for our numbers that<br />
many believed that this would inevitably continue that there:<br />
was some natural sporting superiority in the outdoor loving<br />
Australians. But then victories seemed to be harder, competition<br />
tougher.<br />
Where we had excelled in the coaching and capacity, others<br />
studied what we had donc, improved on these practices, and<br />
surpassed us. We came to know that victories in sport were<br />
harder:.. to achieve, competition was tougher, training of our<br />
competitors was more concentrated and scientific. we had to<br />
decide whether we would let the world pass us by, or whether<br />
we would give our athletes full-blooded support needed for world<br />
victories. We needed world standard training facilities, we<br />
had to show Australia could offer as much, or more, than other<br />
countries, We want to entice our best athletes, our best<br />
coaches, to live, to work, to train in Australia.<br />
It had been galling sometimes to know that for the lack of<br />
encouragement and facilities at home Australians might have<br />
spent more time coaching our competitors than Australians.<br />
Well, this indoor sports complex and this institute are a<br />
clear sign that we are no,. longer going to allow the world to<br />
pass us by.<br />
This complex, * this Nat~ ional Indoor Sports Centre and the<br />
National Institute of Sport are a clear indication of our<br />
determination to reverse past trends. Up until now, too<br />
many world class Australian athletes at the end of their normal1<br />
schooling would have had to make the decision to undertake<br />
tertiary studies or to continue with their sport. There were<br />
no adequate facilities or opportunities to enable them to<br />
do both, as is common overseas. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Australian Institute of Sport, established in close<br />
co-operation and arrangement with high class tertiary<br />
institutions in the National Capital alters all this.<br />
Here, young Australian athletes can pursue their sport<br />
and gain other qualifications.<br />
Bluntly, we have provided the physical facilities. This<br />
centre * enables 22 sports to be pursued. It has attracted<br />
world class Australian coaches. Don Talbot has returned<br />
from overseas to be executive director--a vital person<br />
excited% by, the prospects and opportunities of the Australian<br />
Institute of Sport. Kevin.-Gosper will be chairing the board<br />
of management., And David Dickson, former. Olympian, will be<br />
directing the total complex.<br />
I commend Bob Ellicott,' on behalf of the Government, for<br />
his enthusiasm in pushing this projecti through to completion<br />
in only a little more than one year.<br />
S Here we seek to bring together, great opportuniti'es for young<br />
Australians, guided by the best coaches that can be found.<br />
Young men and women will be given opportunities that are<br />
second to none in any country anywhere.<br />
Some have already achieved great things for themselves and<br />
for Australia. These'-Lisa Curry, Ken Lorraway and<br />
Tracey Wickham to name a few, will be given greater<br />
opportunity to build on their earl. achievements.<br />
In the past, Australia had some of the world's best coaches,<br />
Harry Hopman, Harry Gallagher, Franz Stampf 1, Forbes Carlisle<br />
and Don Talbot himself. But the work has been made more<br />
difficult and they have at times been seduced overseas<br />
because of lack of encouragement and lack of facilities<br />
in Australia.<br />
I hope what you see at this National Institute of Sport and<br />
Indoor Sports Centre will be repeated with the support of<br />
9 State governments providing greater opportunities for young<br />
Australians. Coaches and.-athletes working together through this institute,<br />
will, I am certain, produce great things for Australia and<br />
carry Australia's name high.<br />
On this Australia Day in 1981, I take great pleasure in declaring<br />
open this Indoor Sports Centre and the National Institute of<br />
Sport. </p>
