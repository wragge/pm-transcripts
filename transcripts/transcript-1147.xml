<p>The Chancellor, the Hon. Mr. Justice J. S. J. Clancy, C. M. G.<br />
Prime Minister, members of the University, ladies and gentlemen-<br />
This evening is an historic occasion in the life of this University.<br />
We are to hear the inaugural Wallace Wurth Memorial<br />
Lecture. This was established by the Council of the University<br />
to commemorate our first Chancellor, the late Wallace Charles<br />
Wurth, in recognition of his great work, not only for this University<br />
but for he community. We are privileged this evening<br />
that the Right Honourable Sir Robert Menzies, Prime Minister<br />
of Australia, has consented to deliver this lecture. We had<br />
always hoped that this would be, so we waited, and we are<br />
very grateful that tonight Sir Robert is with us on this very<br />
important occasion. I now invite you, Sir Robert, to deliver the<br />
Wallace Wurth Memorial Lecture.<br />
The Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies, M. P.<br />
Wallace Wuth was a civil servant. I am occasionally told<br />
that I use this expression wrongly, and that I should refer to<br />
people like him as " public servants", working under what in<br />
Australia are called the Public Service Acts.<br />
However, I believe that there are many people who are public<br />
servants who are not under the Public Service Act at all, and I<br />
therefore have fallen into the habit of calling people civil servants<br />
when I intend to refer to those who are in the direct<br />
administrative :; ervice of government.<br />
Because he was a civil servant, Wallace Wurth was a member<br />
of a class of people who constitute a recurrent theme of criticism,<br />
usually by those who are not well-informed.<br />
I have heard civil servants referred to with monotonous regularity<br />
as " bureaucrats", as " clock watchers", as " red tape merchants",<br />
as repcetitive and costly " tea drinkers".<br />
My experience shows that such criticisms come most loudly<br />
from those with the least information. When I cast my eye<br />
around the upper brackets of the Commonwealth Civil Service </p>
<p>and realise the devotion and talent and experience and objectivity<br />
which they bring to their work, I could laugh to hear<br />
them dismissed with a sneer. There are, in fact, few people who<br />
work harder and who think more assiduously. They are in a<br />
very real sense among the custodians of continuity and sanity in<br />
government. It is now many years since I first heard a friend of mine say,<br />
with a certain touch of irony, that " the Civil Service produces<br />
a level of efficiency below which no sensible government can<br />
fall". This is, of course, not to say that politicians, and in particular<br />
Ministers, should become the mere spokesmen of their departmental<br />
officers. This would be all wrong. Indeed, it would be<br />
seen to be wrong by their senior officers themselves. It is the<br />
duty of those civil servants who are in the position of advising<br />
Ministers and of administering policies subsequently created to<br />
give the most objective advice and the most intelligent service<br />
that they can. When they have done that, they have discharged<br />
their task.<br />
It is for governments to determine policy. It is then for the<br />
Civil Service to give effect to those policies whether they<br />
assume legislative or administrative form, and to do so without<br />
fear, favour or affection.<br />
For myself, I have never wanted to know the Party political<br />
alignment of any officer of mine. Indeed, I would resent it if he<br />
told me. For the truth is that whatever Party is in power, it has<br />
exactly the same right to expect honest, disinterested, and competent<br />
work from the Civil Service as any other Party should<br />
expect if it came into office.<br />
These general remarks are by no means irrelevant to the late<br />
Wallace Wurth. He was, as his record showed, a man of most<br />
versatile talents, of rich character and personality, and great<br />
achievement. There was, indeed, something elusive and yet<br />
compelling about him.<br />
For ter. years, until his death, he attended Loan Councils and<br />
Premiers' Conferences at Canberra, as Chairman of the New<br />
South Wales Public Service Board. From my place at the top<br />
of the table, my eye would frequently catch the sight of Wallace </p>
<p>Wurth sitting caldmly on the front Treasury bench-as to the<br />
manner born--hearing all, but, so far as I could judge, steeped<br />
in silence. At fir:; t I used to wonder vaguely what he was doing<br />
at the conference as a member of the New South Wales team.<br />
After all, I had known a few Chairmen of Public Service<br />
Boards in the Commonwealth but had seldom found it necessary<br />
or appropriate to take up with them such matters, financial<br />
or otherwise, as come to be argued when the State Premiers<br />
march on Canberra.<br />
The Chairman of a Public Service Board has great responsibilities,<br />
but they do not commonly fall into the arena of the<br />
political cut and thrust of a Premiers' Conference.<br />
What then, I used to say to myself subconsciously, was Wurth<br />
doing in this gallley? And then the answer dawned on me all<br />
too slowly. Wall. ace Wurth was not for this purpose, and, except<br />
in name, Chairman of the New South Wales Public Service<br />
Board in the restricted or orthodox sense at all. He was the<br />
friend, the consultant, the universal provider, the wise and<br />
upright judge of issues. He was in a sense a muted noise off<br />
stage. He was, to vary the metaphor, armed yet disarming, the<br />
eminence grise of the New South Wales Government. In short,<br />
he was present, not as Chairman of the Public Service Board,<br />
but in a wider capacity. He was, of course, as his whole record<br />
shows, a superb administrator, and I at no time doubted that he<br />
managed the New South Wales Public Service very well. But<br />
his essential contribution came through his pervasive influence<br />
on general policy and action, an influence made possible and<br />
perhaps inevitable by his luminous intelligence, his great force<br />
of character and his unbiased integrity.<br />
In my long experience of public life and affairs, Wallace<br />
Wurth was, in his own right and in his own fashion, unique.<br />
Bearing all these facts in mind, it was a happy stroke when he<br />
was made Chancellor of this new University. For a good Chancellor,<br />
if I may say so, should be a wise and experienced man<br />
with enough kniowledge of academic people to understand their<br />
problems, but also to be able on proper occasions to treat them<br />
lightheartedly. He should, in these days when governments<br />
have the major responsibility for universities in Australia, know </p>
<p>something about governments and how they think, something<br />
of the qualities and something of the oddities of politicians,<br />
and, at the same time, enjoy wide respect from people, many<br />
of whom have never been in a university at all, but who represent<br />
some of the great currents of knowledge and experience<br />
which animate modern social and industrial life.<br />
The significance of Wallace Wurth in relation to the University<br />
of New South Wales could perhaps best be expressed if<br />
I say that one of the functions of a university is to produce<br />
individuals who can develop and preserve their individuality<br />
while still playing in the team. This, after all, should be one of<br />
the great purposes of a university; not uniformity, but developed<br />
individuality.<br />
When I was invited to deliver the Wallace Wurth Memorial<br />
Lecture, .1 had a vagrant thought, built upon some previous<br />
experiencs, that I would be allowed to select any topic and take<br />
the opportunity of saying what I thought about it. This has<br />
happened on a number of occasions and it was not unimportant<br />
to me, because I do as a rule one of these lectures a year, and<br />
sometime:;, through inadvertence on my part, two. I like doing<br />
them, for the very good reason that, in public affairs we can<br />
accustom ourselves all too readily to somewhat general thought<br />
and speech and succumb to the endemic disease of politics,<br />
which is a dislike of precision. I have, therefore, found it a<br />
very good thing for me to have to sit down over a period of<br />
many weeks, do some research, analyse some ideas, and work<br />
them into a degree of clarity of which I would hope not to be<br />
ashamed after they were delivered.<br />
Full of these ideas, I said to my secretary " Find out whether I<br />
am at large in the choice of a topic." The answer came back<br />
with all the inevitability that one expects from a great scientist<br />
like Professor Baxter, " We would like the Prime Minister to<br />
speak about some topic connected with the universities."<br />
Well, Mr. Chancellor, I have for some reason or another, or<br />
perhaps for no reason, been the recipient of, I think, i8 honorary<br />
degrees around the world. That has meant i8 speeches<br />
about universities. I have made quite a number of such speeches<br />
in the Parliament; I have delivered others at the opening of </p>
<p>buildings or schools in various Australian universities. I, therefore,<br />
said to myself, with some feeling of despair, that, as no<br />
doubt some of my political opponents would say, I was an<br />
exhausted volcano. What was there with the faintest degree of<br />
novelty that I could say about the universities? Under these<br />
circumstances I decided on heroic measures. I would put some<br />
queries and perhaps answer them.<br />
I settled on I: wo queries; in each case because I thought it<br />
related to something important about which comparatively<br />
little is said, but about each of which there may be considerable<br />
misconceptions. So, having said something, all too little, about the late Wallace<br />
Wurth, I vwill proceed to deal with my two queries.<br />
The first relates to the new axiom or dogma that university<br />
education ought to be regarded as a right and not as a privilege;<br />
in other words that it should be available to all persons, male or<br />
female, who pass what I will broadly call the entrance examination.<br />
Now in my younger days, if I may venture to go back so<br />
long in history, this was neither axiom nor dogma. Scholarships<br />
were few and had to be battled for in a highly competitive<br />
field. A university education was not a right, nor indeed was it<br />
the perquisite of the sons and daughters of the rich. In my own<br />
time as an undlergraduate, great sacrifices were made by parents,<br />
including my own, to give their children the opportunity<br />
for a higher educational attainment. But times have changed,<br />
and, for reasons to which I will refer a little later, for the better.<br />
Could I start by referring to the celebrated Robbins Report<br />
on higher education in Great Britain? In paragraph 31 of that<br />
report the committee said-<br />
" Throughout our Report we have assumed as an axiom that<br />
courses of higher education should be available for all those who<br />
are qualified by ability and attainment to pursue them and who<br />
wish to do so. What type of education they should get and in what<br />
kind of institution are questions we consider later on; and the<br />
criterion by which capacity is to be judged is clearly a question on<br />
which there may be a variety of opinions. But, on the general<br />
principle as we have stated it, we hope there will be little dispute." </p>
<p>This statement has been referred to with approval by our<br />
own Universities Commission, and by quite a few educational<br />
publications in Australia. Yet, of course, it is not completely<br />
definitive. You will have noted the phrase " those who are<br />
qualified by ability and attainment to pursue them", and you<br />
will also have noted that " the criterion by which capacity is to<br />
be judged is clearly a question on which there may be a variety<br />
of opinion;".<br />
Whether this means that the simple test, to apply it to Australian<br />
conditions, is the passing of the Matriculation Examination,<br />
I do not profess to know. For myself, I would like to<br />
believe that the real point is that finance should not be the<br />
limiting factor where the intellectual capacity and the personal<br />
ambition are adequately high.<br />
On this matter I have had my own mind improved, and no<br />
doubt most of you would agree that that is a desirable state of<br />
affairs, by my perusal, by courtesy of Professor Connell, of a<br />
recent study made by the Department of Education in the<br />
University of Sydney, under the title of " The University and<br />
the Comrr. unity". I am much indebted to this publication and<br />
would like to quote one most interesting passage from it. This<br />
is of great historic interest I think.<br />
" Tertiary education in the past has been thought of largely<br />
as an education of an elite or specially talented segment of the<br />
community. The falsity of this position is now becoming more<br />
apparent every day. The more talented and productive the<br />
elite, the more it becomes necessary to have it built upon a<br />
highly educated community. This is the only way to ensure the<br />
continuance of first rate education for the best brains in the<br />
community. There are three good reasons for this. First, the<br />
talented perform best, generally speaking, in a climate of sympathetic<br />
understanding among people who have some reasonable<br />
idea of what they are doing, and take an intelligent interest<br />
in their success. Secondly, the higher education of the talented<br />
is an expensive business, and it will receive adequate financial<br />
support only from public monies. These will be forthcoming<br />
only if there is a sufficient body of soundly educated people who </p>
<p>can see the value of such an education. And, thirdly, by increasing<br />
the number of highly educated men and women in the<br />
community, you not only ensure stimulation and support for<br />
the specially talented, you also increase the pool of individuals<br />
who aspire to further education, and from whom large numbers<br />
of specially talented may be drawn for a higher education.<br />
These argument; suggest that if we are to educate even our<br />
gifted successfully, we must provide opportunity for as wide a<br />
segment of the community as possible to proceed into some<br />
form of higher education, and at the same time raise the general<br />
level of educational achievement throughout the whole community."<br />
I am sorry to inflict so long a citation upon you, but<br />
this seems to be of singular quality and relevancy to what I am<br />
saying. Accepting these views, I would like to say that they not only<br />
present a statement of desirable rights, but they present an<br />
enormous challenge. When I attended, earlier this year, the<br />
University of Birmingham to receive a degree there at the hands<br />
of my old friend, Lord Avon, I said a little about this problem<br />
in my speech of acknowledgement. The Vice-Chancellor of<br />
Birmingham later gave me a copy of his report to his University<br />
for 1963. In this he referred to the implications of the initial<br />
proposition in the Robbins Report.<br />
In the course of his report the Vice-Chancellor said, " The<br />
universities' task of sustaining quality is more important in the<br />
long run than numbers." He also went on to say that " Another<br />
consequence of the new philosophy will have to be watched.<br />
The attitudes of :; tudents who come to the universities, claiming<br />
their places as of right, will, or as I would have said ' may', be<br />
different from those of students coming to enjoy and use a hard<br />
won privilege."<br />
He had other things to say which seemed to me to be of great<br />
importance. But: speaking now for myself, and accepting the<br />
new philosophy as an ideal to be aimed at, I do want to point<br />
out a few practical considerations which cannot be ignored in<br />
the enthusiasm of a new vision.<br />
Far too many people in our country, when they urge the<br />
creation of a new university, seem to think of it in terms of </p>
<p>financial provision by governments, and the bricks and mortar<br />
of practical construction. Yet the fact is that the value of a university<br />
depends primarily upon the standard of its research and<br />
its teaching. In short, the greatest problem about the expansion<br />
of universities, or the creation of a new one, is that of securing<br />
a highly qualified staff. Any man who has any share of responsibility<br />
for the general national balance and prosperity cannot<br />
fail to be conscious of such problems as the pressure of numbers<br />
on financial resources, the pressure of numbers and demand oei<br />
physical resources, because these things form part of the economic<br />
problems of the nation. They have to be considered. They<br />
can produce some limitation upon the financial provision by<br />
governments. But, in the ultimate, the capacity to establish new<br />
universities or to expand old ones is primarily to be judged by<br />
reference to the maintenance of the quality of research and<br />
teaching and the value of the degrees to be awarded.<br />
Gresham's Law, if I may say so, applies to universities and<br />
their degrees just as much as it did and does to money. In short,<br />
we have occurring under our eyes a tremendous explosion in<br />
the numbers of those who seek tertiary education. Our task is<br />
to see that they get it without lowering the standards.<br />
The la:; t thing that I want to do is to encumber you with<br />
statistics, but I would ask you to carry in mind just a few<br />
figures which I derived from the last report of the Australian<br />
Universities Commission.<br />
In 1960, which is, after all, not long ago, the number of<br />
students at Australian universities was ( and I will quote figures<br />
to the nc: arest thousand) 53,000. By 1963 this had grown to<br />
69, oo000. The prediction of the Commission ( and it is not likely<br />
to be over the mark) is that by I966 the figure will be 95,000.<br />
( I96o-53, ooo, 1966-95, ooo).<br />
These figures represent an enormous increase in what I will<br />
call demand for tertiary education. They must be accompanied<br />
by the observation that graduation rates, either in total or in<br />
minimum time, were, over the period from 1951 to 1956, deplorably<br />
low. The figures seem to be improving, but they are<br />
still not as good as they should be. This is, of course, important<br />
because the amount of money spent and the amount of teaching </p>
<p>energy put forward in the training of students is wasted to the<br />
extent that the result is not achieved. Any community like ours,<br />
which accepts large financial burdens for universities, cannot<br />
afford this kind of waste.<br />
The reasons for what I have called wastage are, I think, clear<br />
enough. We have not yet reached a completely adequate level<br />
of training in ithe secondary schools, and, therefore, too many<br />
matriculating students go to university with a considerable risk<br />
of failure. This has deeply impressed me ever since Sir Keith<br />
Murray, now Lord Murray I am happy to observe, presented<br />
the original report. It explains why my own Government has<br />
initiated schemes for secondary school scholarships designed to<br />
give extra time in secondary studies, which is very important,<br />
and for science teaching facilities in the secondary schools so<br />
that on the science side students may, if they decide to go on to<br />
the university, go on much better prepared. Again, most universities<br />
have felt inadequately staffed, that is in terms of numbers I<br />
hasten to say, and that the staff-student ratios were unsatisfactory.<br />
What I have said means that I believe that before we<br />
become too rhapsodical about the increase in numbers and the<br />
rights of people to have university training, we should face up<br />
to the problem that the greatest task, and in a sense the most<br />
difficult one, is to find the necessary trained and competent<br />
staff. There was a time when quite a number of professors and<br />
lecturers came from overseas. That was true in my own time.<br />
That time has come to an end. We must,, as never before, generate<br />
in our own universities our own future staff.<br />
This is a problem by no means overlooked by our own<br />
Universities Commission. It must not be overlooked by governments.<br />
I certainly don't overlook it myself. Unless we can, by<br />
one means or another, encourage and produce an increasing<br />
percentage of university students who aim at higher degrees<br />
and research work, then we will do a gross disservice to university<br />
education by concentrating our minds exclusively on numbers<br />
and on money.<br />
I would sum up my own views about which perhaps I've said </p>
<p>too much, on this matter by stating the new rule in my own<br />
fashion. I believe that we should aim at a state of affairs in<br />
which all young men and women capable of, and likely to benefit<br />
from, a university education are not denied their opportunity<br />
for want of means. But I believe that this opportunity will<br />
find them pursuing false lights unless they can go through a<br />
period of training and inspiration which can come to them<br />
only through the work of teachers of the highest order.<br />
My second query-and this is, I think, rather a bold one; still<br />
one mu:; t be bold occasionally-relates to " academic freedom".<br />
For various well-known reasons, there has been, during the<br />
last few years in Australia, considerable discussion about the<br />
nature and extent of the academic freedom to be enjoyed by<br />
academic people.<br />
I want to say something about the problem tonight, for two<br />
reasons. The first is that I think that I am at liberty to express an<br />
objective view, for, although I have had, fortunately, much to<br />
do with university developments in Australia over the last<br />
decade, I have at all times been careful to maintain my own<br />
belief in the autonomy of universities and in the utter undesirability<br />
of governmental executive direction to the universities as<br />
to what they are to study and teach. It is, I think, well to remember<br />
that in Australia the universities are in a substantial<br />
sense government universities, relying to a major extent upon<br />
monies provided by governments. Under these circumstances,<br />
it might be feared that the governments which find the money<br />
might wish to call the tune, and might interfere with those<br />
university activities which it is the function of the university to<br />
promote. As I think it will be agreed that I have at no time<br />
sought to interfere with university autonomy, I may feel justified<br />
in offering some views about academic freedom.<br />
My :; econd reason is that I think that a good deal of what has<br />
been said in the press and otherwise about academic freedom<br />
has been over-emotional; it has, I fear, promoted more heat<br />
than light. It is, therefore, I think, a valuable exercise to pose<br />
the question " What is academic freedom?" and to endeavour to<br />
answer it. I </p>
<p>The first element in academic freedom is the liberty of<br />
thought. This has never been better defined than by Charles<br />
Morgan in his remarkable book, and my favourite book,<br />
" Liberties of the Mind". I quote his words-<br />
" I mean by it the mind's freedom from any external pressure<br />
designed to drug, intimidate or otherwise reduce its full exercise<br />
of natural capacity."<br />
I would also like to quote with warm approval the words of<br />
the report of the Murray Committee on Australian Universities<br />
-it is as well to recall these words:<br />
" In the middle of the twentieth century universities are very<br />
much in the public eye and in most countries they receive a<br />
good deal of attention, and also very substantial financial support,<br />
from governments. In most parts of the free world they<br />
are accorded a high degree of autonomy and self-determination<br />
on the ground that the particular services which they render,<br />
both to their own country and to mankind in general, cannot<br />
be rendered without such freedom. Even in time of war and<br />
national danger, the nations of the West have sought to honour,<br />
so far as they humanly could, the right and duty of the universities<br />
to pursue new knowledge without fear or favour and to<br />
educate in a liberal spirit and with integrity; and even in times<br />
of economic depression they have shown increasing signs of<br />
seeking to maintain the life and work of universities in full<br />
vigour." The integrity of the scholar would be under attack if he were<br />
told what he wa: to think about and how he was to think about<br />
it. It is of the most vital importance for human progress in all<br />
fields of knowledge that the highest encouragement should be<br />
given to untrammelled research, to the vigorous pursuit of<br />
truth, however unorthodox it may seem. It is for this reason<br />
that in Australia we have established the autonomy of universities,<br />
and have, so far as I know, and I hope I am right, consistently<br />
refrained from interfering in their work with what I<br />
will call political executive directions.<br />
If no limits can sensibly be put to the search for new truths<br />
or the better understanding and expression of old ones, it follows<br />
that the scholar must work in an atmosphere of freedom </p>
<p>and with a free mind. True, in a democracy, Parliament, acting<br />
within its constitutional jurisdiction may, under some circumstances,<br />
pass legislation which limits the rights of expression.<br />
Such circumstances may arise in time of war or other special<br />
times where national security may require, under an appropriate<br />
law, some limitations upon freedom of expression or of<br />
individual activity. But I know of no law in a modern civilised<br />
country which has made it an offence to think. There is, of<br />
course, in s; ome philosophies in the world, an attack made upon<br />
the mind in order to constrain it into habits of thought which<br />
are agreeable to the rulers. There are philosophies in the world<br />
which aim at reducing the power and significance of human<br />
volition in order to pave the way for what has been called a<br />
mechanistic conception of life; in which people are to be pawns<br />
in the game of economic and material conflict. But I think we<br />
may say that in Australia we have never accepted these philosophies<br />
and that we still retain our passion for freedom and for<br />
the development, not only of the individual, but of every faculty<br />
that he may possess for investigation and discovery.<br />
Now I said just now that some discussion has appeared to me<br />
to be over-emotional. I have, indeed, if I may say so prudently<br />
in this assembly, detected some disposition on the part of some<br />
academics to claim a freedom which puts them outside the substance<br />
and procedures of the ordinary law. Now, quite frankly,<br />
this is a claim that cannot and must not be sustained. Freedom<br />
is one thing. Privilege is another, and privilege cannot be<br />
claimed unless the law recognises it. There are, indeed, some<br />
privileges recognised by the law. For example, the privilege,<br />
under some circumstances, of communications between patient<br />
and doctor and between the priest and a confessing member of<br />
his communion. But these, I repeat, are within the law.<br />
But, putting such matters on one side, freedom is to be seen<br />
as a faculty enjoyed by all citizens, not because they are<br />
academic or because they conduct a newspaper, but because they<br />
are citizens. The freedom of the press, for example, like yours<br />
or mine, is a freedom within the law. It is subject to all the legal<br />
rules relatinlg to defamation or sedition or violation of the criminal<br />
codes. A rich private citizen achieves no new or special </p>
<p>freedom when he purchases a newspaper and controls its policy<br />
and utterances. Similarly, a barrister practising his profession at<br />
the Bar and enjoying the normal freedom of mankind and the<br />
special legal privilege which attaches to what he says in court,<br />
does not acquire a new body of either freedom or privilege if he<br />
becomes a Professor of Law at a university. It is, I think, and I<br />
speak subject of course to your correction, Mr. Chancellor, well<br />
to remember some of these basic truths.<br />
The whole matter has been somewhat confused for some<br />
Australian minds, I venture to think, by the great masses of litigation<br />
and debate which have occurred in the United States, the<br />
reasons for which are, as I will point out later, largely peculiar<br />
to the United States itself. But before I come to that let me consider<br />
what the position is under our own legal system and that<br />
of England. I will give one example which always ought to be<br />
remembered; t.. e famous trial of Thomas Paine, the author of<br />
" The Rights of Man". Now this was a very peculiar trial because<br />
the defendant was not present, and a stranger trial still<br />
because a hand-picked jury had been specially bribed to produce<br />
a verdict of guilty. A very satisfactory state of affairs from the<br />
point of view of the prosecution.<br />
But in that trial although he was absent, and although the<br />
result was pre-determined, he was defended by Thomas<br />
Erskine. This, I hasten to say, was before Erskine succumbed to<br />
those rather sordid ambitions which led him to the House of<br />
Lords; before he had entered into that process of deterioration<br />
in which he ro:; e in favour but fell in grace. But his speech in<br />
defence of Thomas Paine remains a classic. He did not attack<br />
the law, for that would have been futile. He did not claim that<br />
Paine, as a thinker and writer, had some special immunity from<br />
the law. On the contrary, he said this:-and these are memorable<br />
words with which a great number of you will be very<br />
familiar: " If I were to ask you, Gentlemen of the Jury, what is the<br />
choicest fruit that grows upon the tree of English liberty, you<br />
would answer SECURITY UNDER THE LAW. If I were to ask the<br />
whole people of England the return they look for at the hands<br />
of the Governraent, for the burdens under which they bend to </p>
<p>support it, I should still be answered sEcURInTY UNDER THE LAW".<br />
I am not sure that a modern jury would make that answer but<br />
still that was a magnificent statement.<br />
The whole basis of this famous passage was that Paine's freedom<br />
to write was consistent with, and therefore protected by,<br />
the law; not that it was superior to the law.<br />
I will make one more citation. It is from a play, but it expresses<br />
with great accuracy the spirit of the law. My former<br />
colleague, and our recent Ambassador to the United States, Sir<br />
Howard Beale was good enough to direct my attention to it.<br />
The play is Robert Bolt's play about Sir Thomas More, " A Man<br />
for All Seasons".<br />
More, as you all remember, was the Lord Chancellor, and, in<br />
those days particularly, the Lord Chancellor was more than the<br />
head of the judiciary, he was a man of immense and, at that<br />
time, in some respects, arbitrary power. In the play, his wife<br />
Alice is protesting to him because he will make no move to<br />
arrest a man named Rich, who, although pretending to be a<br />
friend, she thinks and believes is preparing to change sides and<br />
become a dangerous enemy. She is joined in this argument by<br />
William Roper and so the dialogue proceeds-<br />
ALICE: While you talk [ she is talking to her father] he's gone!<br />
Mor: And go he should if he was the Devil himself until he<br />
broke the law!<br />
ROPER: So now you'd give the Devil benefit of law!<br />
MoRE: Yes, what would you do? Cut a great road through the<br />
law to get after the Devil?<br />
ROPER: I'd cut down every law in England to do that!<br />
MORE: Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil<br />
turned round on you-where would you hide, Roper, the<br />
laws all being flat? This country's planted thick with laws<br />
from coast to coast-man's laws, not God's-and if you<br />
cut them down-and you're just the man to do it-d'you<br />
really think you could stand upright in the winds that<br />
would blow then?<br />
To continue, I would venture to say something more on this<br />
matter that a professor or lecturer at a university is an employee </p>
<p>of the university acting through its governing body, and that,<br />
as an employee he is subject to the normal rules relating to<br />
master and servant [ I am not talking about some special contract<br />
made with somebody outside] to dismissal without<br />
notice if his employer can prove good cause, and to all the risks<br />
of not being re-appointed if his original appointment has been<br />
for a specific term. To deny this proposition would be to say<br />
that he is taken out of the usual Common Law relating to<br />
master and servant and put into a category which is either above<br />
the law or which is subject to no law. This is not a tenable<br />
proposition. I hasten to add of course that any university, which<br />
treated a professor or lecturer as if he was just a man hired to<br />
study as directed and to teach in accordance with rules laid<br />
down by other people, would be an extremely strange university;<br />
it would have failed to understand the immense importance<br />
of true academic freedom.<br />
There is, of course, great scope for discussion of the rules of<br />
practice that may properly be applied in a university; rules of<br />
practice which may warrant consultation and exchange of views<br />
on the facts between the lecturer and the governing body before<br />
some action affecting the lecturer is taken.<br />
These are matters which fall within the principles of natural<br />
justice, which are not inconsistent with the law, and of course<br />
may freely tend to the improvement of academic morale. But<br />
it still remains true that academic freedom is freedom within<br />
the law, subject to the law, and that if recourse is made to the<br />
law, the ordinary rules of law will apply. For all these reasons I<br />
am convinced that it is a disservice to academic freedom, a freedom<br />
to which I attach the most tremendous importance, to seek<br />
to promote it into a doctrine of privilege outside the law; a<br />
privilege which sets the academic free from obedience to the<br />
ordinary legal rules which govern the lives of all the rest of us.<br />
It is perhaps because these things are pretty well understood<br />
in countries familiar with the rule of law and not so familiar<br />
with special constitutional provisions, such as those which<br />
appear in two of the amendments to the American Constitution,<br />
that, so far as I can discover, and I do not speak at first-</p>
<p>hand, there have been no notable instances in the United Kingdom<br />
of interference with academic freedom.<br />
I recently read an article by Lord Chorley in a compendium<br />
on academic freedom, published by the School of Law at Duke<br />
University. He says that academic freedom is taken for granted<br />
in the United Kingdom. He, of course, concedes that there have<br />
been other pressures or dangers of pressures, religious or political,<br />
in the course of history. But, on balance, he thinks it is<br />
safe to say that academic freedom is enjoyed as fully in English<br />
universitie3 as anywhere else in the world. He points out, as<br />
indeed I endeavoured to point out a little earlier in other words,<br />
that " in the modern age there can be no doubt that the main<br />
enemy to academic freedom has been the powerful State".<br />
I turn now briefly to the United States of America where<br />
academic freedom has been, in contra-distinction to the state of<br />
affairs in Great Britain and Australia, much discussed in the<br />
courts and particularly in the Supreme Court-the highest tribunal.<br />
To understand how such a matter can fall for judicial<br />
decision, ii. is necessary to look at two provisions of the American<br />
Constitution. It will be recalled that the Constitution of the<br />
United States was amended very early in the piece. The first<br />
Congress, when it met in 1789, submitted to the States ten<br />
amendments to clarify certain individual and State rights not<br />
named in the Constitution. These amendments were ratified.<br />
The ten original amendments are always referred to in the<br />
United States as " The Bill of Rights". I will just quote two of<br />
the Article: s-<br />
Article provided that [ and I am omitting irrelevant words<br />
for this purpose] " Congress shall make no law abridging<br />
freedom of speech or of the press that's Congress.<br />
Article made a general provision, that is, not one directed<br />
at Congre; s only, but of wider application, which was that " no<br />
person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without<br />
due proce; s of law".<br />
Many years later, in i868, the i4th amendment came into<br />
operation. It was stated in more comprehensive terms and </p>
<p>affected both the Congress and the legislatures of the States.<br />
It is well to have this in mind because a great deal of what goes<br />
on in the United States in the field of public argument has<br />
relation to thi-integration, civil rights and so on. It said:<br />
" All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject<br />
to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States<br />
and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or<br />
enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities<br />
of citizens of the United States, nor shall any State deprive<br />
any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of<br />
law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal<br />
protection of the laws."<br />
It will be seen that these celebrated Constitutional provisions,<br />
commonly referred to in America as " the due process" provisions,<br />
have brought into the arena of judicial determination<br />
matters which in another Constitutional structure would not<br />
reach the Courts at all.<br />
I do not propose to engage in a close examination of the<br />
decisions of the American Courts, but I think there are a few<br />
things which can be said with advantage.<br />
In a fairly recent case, Mr. Justice Harlan, whose name is<br />
greatly respected among Australian as well as American lawyers,<br />
summed the matter up and explained the reason for<br />
judicial proceedings in a single paragraph. He said: " When<br />
academic teaching-freedom and its corollary, learning-freedom,<br />
so essential to the well-being of the nation, are claimed, this<br />
Court will always be on the alert against intrusion by Congress<br />
into this constitutionally protected domain."<br />
After a considerable review of the decisions of the American<br />
Courts, I have come to the conclusion that they have been astute<br />
to protect the universities against any violation of the freedoms<br />
guaranteed by the American Constitution. The protection has<br />
not been given to a privilege claimed outside the law. It has<br />
been given to a freedom guaranteed by the constitutional or<br />
basic law of the nation. As one American writer has said-" In<br />
the United States freedom is not an academic privilege; it is<br />
a right constitutionally guaranteed to all residents." </p>
<p>In 1952, that very great judicial lawyer, Mr. Justice Frankfurter,<br />
put the whole problem in a single paragraph.<br />
" It is the special task of teachers to foster those habits of openmindedness<br />
and critical inquiry which alone make for responsible<br />
citizens, who, in turn, make possible an enlightened and<br />
effective public opinion. Teachers must fulfil their function<br />
by precept and practice, by the very atmosphere which they<br />
generate; they must be exemplars of open-mindedness and free<br />
inquiry. They cannot carry out their noble task if the conditions<br />
for the practice of a responsible and critical mind are denied<br />
to them. They must have the freedom of responsible inquiry,<br />
by thought and action, into the meaning of social and economic<br />
ideas, into the checkered history of social and economic dogma.<br />
They must be free to sift evanescent doctrine, qualified by time<br />
and circumstances, from that restless, enduring process of extending<br />
the bounds of understanding and wisdom, to assure<br />
which the freedoms of thought, of speech, of inquiry, of worship<br />
are guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States<br />
against infraction by national or state government.<br />
" The finctions of educational institutions in our national life,<br />
and the conditions under which alone they can adequately<br />
perform them, are at the basis of these limitations [ which I<br />
repeat were limitations of law] upon State and national power."<br />
Here vwe have stated with clarity the whole reason for academic<br />
freedom and the reason why, in the case of the United<br />
States, special constitutional provisions, basic legal provisions,<br />
were established to protect it. But the point that I want to<br />
emphasise, though I become guilty of tedious repetition, though<br />
it ought to be trite enough, is that in America itself, with these<br />
special constitutional provisions, the guaranteed freedoms belong<br />
to the community as a whole, and are not in some particular<br />
or exclusive way sectional privileges outside the law. It is one<br />
of the glories of a civilised democracy that we enjoy our freedoms<br />
in common; that we are born with those freedoms, and<br />
that they can be limited or taken away only by the principles<br />
of the common law or by constitutionally competent statutory<br />
provisions made by Parliament. In the absence of specific legal<br />
provisions, no man may claim a greater freedom than another. </p>
<p>Yet, and I come back to it, the freedom of the enquiring mind<br />
in a university is of vital importance, not only for contemporary<br />
society, but for a developing future. For this reason it is important<br />
that acadenmic people should not set their claims too high, so<br />
that they appear to be claiming, as perhaps some of them do,<br />
privileges unrecognised by the law. But they certainly should,<br />
in their univer: ity community life, insist, within the law, upon<br />
the maintenance of the freedom of their minds; and should at<br />
all times resist: unauthorised political interference with their<br />
work, or administrative procedures within the university itself<br />
which could frustrate them in the kind of work they are in<br />
a university to do.<br />
Interestingly enough, and this is an almost irrelevant interjection<br />
to myself, there has been a good deal of debate in the<br />
United States about the position of a practising Communist in<br />
a university. Some responsible and liberal-minded people have<br />
queried the employment of practising Communists in a university,<br />
for the intelligible reason that the whole philosophy of<br />
Communism and the whole discipline of the Party are opposed<br />
to that compl: te freedom of thought and objectivity of mind<br />
which it is one of the functions of a university to maintain. I<br />
will not try to pursue that argument to its conclusion, because,<br />
as in all these contentious matters, the boundary line is very<br />
hard to define.<br />
One other matter that has engaged a good deal of attention<br />
in the United States is the problem of the tenure of members<br />
of university staffs. There can be no doubt that professors or<br />
lecturers appointed at will could be much more liable to executive<br />
interference or pressure than those who are appointed for<br />
a substantial term. Even those appointed for a term of years<br />
may find themselves complaining that a failure to renew their<br />
appointment at the end of their term has been due to some<br />
objection to their exercise of their academic freedom. These<br />
are, of course, very important matters. I; for one, would offer<br />
my own view that an academic appointed after due consideration<br />
should not feel himself to be at the risk of arbitrary treatment<br />
if his enquiries lead him to conclusions which are, in some<br />
quarters, unpopular. But it still remains true that, whether the </p>
<p>staff member has a fixed short or long term or no term at all,<br />
the rules which control the right of the university to dismiss<br />
him are the same as the rules that apply in any contract of employment,<br />
and that, if he is dismissed without notice, the onus<br />
will be, as in any other case, on his employer, the university, to<br />
justify in law the action that has been taken.<br />
To sum. up, you will see from what I have said that when we<br />
speak of academic freedom, we are not speaking of a privilege<br />
given to academic people and denied to ordinary men and<br />
women. It merely happens that, as universities are increasingly<br />
in what I will call the limelight of current history, there will at<br />
all times be two temptations. One will be a temptation on the<br />
part of partisans, including partisans outside the university, to<br />
seek to control the universities in what they think and what<br />
they say, irrespective of the law. The other will be a temptation,<br />
occasionally encouraged in circumstances of emotion or heat,<br />
for university people to claim that those rules which apply to<br />
ordinary men and women in the eye of the law, do not apply<br />
to them. I would prefer to think of academic freedom as a<br />
precious ; and shining example of that kind of freedom which<br />
all thinking men and women in our community want for<br />
themselves, and will not abandon without a struggle.<br />
The Vice-Chancellor, Professor J. P. Baxter, O. B. E.<br />
The Chancellor, members of the University, distinguished<br />
guests-For us, this is a solemn occasion. We remember tonight the<br />
first Chancellor of the University who led it through its early,<br />
difficult and formative years and set it on the road to its present<br />
success. We remember, with love and gratitude<br />
Wallace Charles Wurth.<br />
For us this is a great occasion, for our first Wallace Wurth<br />
Memorial Lecture has been given by Australia's greatest leader,<br />
our Prim,: Minister, the Right Honourable Sir Robert Menzies. </p>
<p>During his long period of office, Sir Robert's influence has<br />
permeated every aspect of Australian life and progress, but nowhere,<br />
I believe, have his actions cast ahead of them a greater<br />
promise of benefits to come than his decision in 1956 to come<br />
to the rescue of the Australian Universities which were then<br />
facing complete collapse in the tide of mounting enrolments<br />
and inadequate resources.<br />
The Murray report, promptly implemented by the Prime<br />
Minister, the Universities Commission, with its triennial grants,<br />
have put us on the road to recovery and though we seldom<br />
admit it in public, we are doing pretty well.<br />
We are I believe creating an investment for the future, an<br />
investment in young people's minds and abilities which will<br />
mean more for Australia in the next fifty years, and beyond,<br />
than anything else we could do.<br />
We owe it largely to one man, the man who saw our needs,<br />
realised the importance of our problems and who took the<br />
action required to solve them.<br />
But the Prime Minister has done much more than that. He<br />
has shown a profound understanding of and sympathy for all<br />
those things which are important in Universities, and the help<br />
he has given has never been tinged with a desire to restrict true<br />
freedom or genuine scholarship.<br />
He has made it clear that he expects our standards of service<br />
to be as high as his own.<br />
When the history of our Universities comes to be written<br />
Sir Robert's role during these years will stand clearly out, and<br />
even in his own immense personal record of service to Australia<br />
this will be an enduring chapter.<br />
To you, Sir Robert, for the many things you have done for<br />
the Universities, for the leadership and encouragement you<br />
have given us, for your constructive and wholly delightful<br />
address tonight, and for your presence here, with Dame Pattie,<br />
on this occasion when we remember our first Chancellor, we<br />
tender our sincere thanks. </p>
