PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER, THE HON KIM BEAZLEY MP<br />
FORD MOTOR COMPANY INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIA<br />
The decision today by the Ford Motor Company to invest $ 1 billion in a Falcon<br />
replacement and long term paint facility represents a ringing vote of confidence in<br />
Australia. Against competing pressures for Ford's international investment dollars Australia<br />
has come through a process of critical assessment with a decision which<br />
endorses this country as a good place to invest.<br />
This decision is unambiguously a vote of confidence in the Government's<br />
management of the economy, for competitiveness, for industry policy and for<br />
employment. The Government is committed to working with Ford and other<br />
producers to enhance their competitive position in global markets.<br />
Since March 1992, manufacturing employment in Australia has increased by<br />
more than 53,000. Ford's decision will guarantee thousands of Australian jobs,<br />
particularly in Victoria.<br />
Manufacturing output in Australia is now at its highest level since the Australian<br />
Bureau of Statistics started collecting these data in 1974.<br />
If we include processed food, manufactures now account for around half our total<br />
merchandise exports, bringing in almost three times the export dollars we earn<br />
from rural products.<br />
The tariff reduction program and consequent industry restructuring have given<br />
rise to more competitive exporters in important sectors, including the car industry<br />
and textiles, clothing and footwear.<br />
The value of textile clothing and footwear exports last year was around $ 500<br />
million more than a decade ago; the value of automotive exports is now $ 700<br />
million more than a decade ago.<br />
The go-ahead for the new model Falcon, and Ford Australia's integration in<br />
Ford's international operation, is a clear signal that Australia has a strong<br />
position in a truly global industry.<br />
So much for Mr Howard's five minutes of economic sunshine.<br />
PERTH 14 July 1995 </p>
