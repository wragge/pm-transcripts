PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 27 JULY<br />
1989 E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: Well the time has come when a very specific question<br />
has to be put to Mr Peacock, the Leader of the Opposition.<br />
The question is simple, quite uncomplicated. Did he or did<br />
he not say to a luncheon meeting of the executives of John<br />
Fairfax that the Opposition would not be releasing all the<br />
details of its proposed spending cuts before the election?<br />
Most specifically, did he tell the luncheon that there would<br />
be two lists of spending cuts, one which would be released<br />
before the election and one which would be kept secret?<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think he did?<br />
PM: I'd be entirely unsurprised if he did and that's the<br />
question that's got to be put him. The allegation has been<br />
made now that he said there'd be two lists. one which he<br />
would bring out and say to the people of Australia, ' this is<br />
the proposal of the alternative government, here's the<br />
spending cuts'. He has said however, that that's the only<br />
list that the public will be told about. They will not be<br />
told about the list that's kept secret to be sprung after<br />
the election if the people are ever silly enough to elect<br />
him. Now of itself, I repeat this is enough to ensure that<br />
they would never do that, here he is with his multi<br />
millionaire President, John Elliott, who wouldn't know<br />
anything, anything at all about the needs of the Australian<br />
people, saying that you've got to slash expenditures.. So<br />
the man that he's put in as Leader of the Opposition<br />
because Peacock is Elliott's creation is playing the<br />
Elliott game, here is Elliott puppeteering Peacock. He<br />
said, ' now I'll put you in because you're going to slash the<br />
welfare of Australians'. ' Yes, Mr President, Sir', says<br />
Peacock, ' but can I do it in a sly way'? ' Yes that's<br />
alright, we'll do it t-he sly way'. We'll tell the people,<br />
' here's our little minimal list of what we'll hit you with'.<br />
But he's told Fairfax there's a secret hit list and when we<br />
get in the puppeteer of Elliott will smash the Australian<br />
people with that secret hit list. That's the challenge that<br />
faces Mr Peacock as he now goes on his phoney, in the true<br />
sense of the word, his phoney election campaign next week.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why would he tell a group of newspaper<br />
executives? Surely he'd expect it to get out? </p>
<p>PM: Well I can't tell what happens when Mr Peacock, the<br />
puppet of Mr Elliott, I mean he may have thought that he got<br />
some guarantee via Mr Elliott that he could say these<br />
things. He's acting as Elliott's puppet, it's quite clear<br />
in these things and perhaps the puppeteer told the puppet<br />
that it was alright to tell him these things.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, logic dictates that if it is a<br />
genuine secret list you can't publicly acknowledge it, can<br />
he? PM: Well, he would say in answer to that very interesting<br />
question that he didn't publicly acknowledge it. He thought<br />
he was having a secret meeting about a secret list but<br />
unfortunately for the puppet, whatever the puppeteer might<br />
have done and got some assurance that he could talk like<br />
this and tell them that it was a real secret list, it wasn't<br />
a secret meeting about a secret list. I mean, I hope<br />
everyone understands just the dimension of what's involved<br />
here. What's happened in Australian politics this year is<br />
that you had a leader of the Liberal Party who wasn't doing<br />
any good, he was no good for some obvious reasons. So the<br />
President of the Party arranged for Howard to be dumped.<br />
You know I'm not talking after the event, because I told you<br />
all and you weren't quick enough to pick it up but I told<br />
you what was going on, the President of the Party had to get<br />
a show-piece to run the Party. So he said alright, out you<br />
go Mr Howard and in I put my puppet. So it's all unfolding<br />
because he said, the President, the multi-millionaire<br />
President, the man with his retreat on the Mediterranean,<br />
the Cote d'Azure, there he is. He's right, he knows all<br />
about the needs of the Australian people. So he's put his<br />
puppet in. He's said ' now sure you can talk about some cuts<br />
to the Australian people, but not too big. So we'll draw up<br />
the secret smash hit list'. So the puppet is, he's gone<br />
along to the meeting which he thought was alright and he<br />
said ' now that's what I've been told to do, that's what I'm<br />
going to do, there it is'. Do you understand the enormity<br />
of what's happening in Australian politics? Quite<br />
remarkable.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, yesterday in light of the CPI<br />
increase, the Metal Workers Union called for workers to get<br />
their pay increases more speedily. Do you think they have a<br />
case? PM: The way in which the processes of the wage increases<br />
should be applied is a matter to be dealt with through the<br />
Arbitration Commission.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you accept now, along with the Treasurer,<br />
that the wages outcome of 6.5 percent, that it will now be<br />
somewhat higher for coming </p>
<p>PM: I think, as Paul said, that it may be minimally higher,<br />
but what we're entitled to say when I say we, I'm talking<br />
about the Government and in this respect the trade union<br />
movement they are entitled as a trade union movement and<br />
we as a Government in terms of running economic policy, are<br />
entitled to be judged in terms of what's been achieved in<br />
the six years. In that period very, very significant wage<br />
restraint has been shown. Remember what the outcome of that<br />
restraint has been. Very significant reductions in real<br />
wages, an enormous increase in the competitive position of<br />
Australian industry, a reduction in real unit labour costs<br />
of the order of 10 percent. So that's been achieved by the<br />
exercise of very considerable restraint and I don't believe<br />
that the trade unions of this country and certainly the<br />
Government of this country are not going to throw away the<br />
benefits of all that restraint. Now I'm sorry, I've got to<br />
get back to ERC<br />
JOURNALIST: collapse of Hookers?<br />
PM: Well, one doesn't like to see a significant company<br />
collapse, but we live in a situation where, as far as this<br />
Government is concerned, we deregulated the market, we've<br />
got market forces operating and market forces have operated<br />
here. One hopes that in the circumstances this is not going<br />
to provide problems for people who are involved in purchases<br />
of properties and nor for employees, but these results of<br />
market forces, of decisions which are taken by companies and<br />
that's the name of the game. It's got nothing to do with<br />
the fundamental strength of the Australian economy.<br />
ends </p>
