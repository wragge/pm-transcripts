FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 9 DECEMBER 1979,<br />
ELECTORATE TALK_<br />
Australia is about to enter an exciting decade that will. see<br />
development and investment unparalleled in our country..* As* the<br />
world is fast beginning to realise, Australia is ina'eed the<br />
lucky country.<br />
With our supplies of minerals, our vast reserves of energy along<br />
with the quality and calibre of our people we have the<br />
opportunities that are second to none.<br />
In a world that is facing continuous problems of low growth,<br />
sluggish trade and great uncertainty following the Middle East<br />
oil crisis, it is imperative that we insulate ourselves as far<br />
as possible from these problems. We cannot afford to sit back and<br />
be totally caught up in overseas events. It is not good enough<br />
for Australia to allow itself to become the victim of a crisis<br />
far from its shores and far from its control.<br />
As a Government we have recognised our responsibility to take<br />
initiatives to put our nation first. Over the last four years<br />
the fundamental imbalances in our economy have been largely<br />
overcome. Our inflation rate is now below that of the O. E. C. D.<br />
that is the advanced Western countries and it is well below<br />
most of our major trading partners. Costs are down. Exports<br />
are up. Our industries are more competitive than they have been<br />
for many years. with this going for us, we can enter the 1980' s<br />
with greater prospects than most of the industrialised world.<br />
We have established the economic environment which now allows<br />
private industry to undertake major development programmes tha-) t<br />
will benefit every Australian. Your Government is playing its<br />
part. A major step was taken just over a year ago in a historic<br />
meeting of the Loan Council in Melbourne which approved a new<br />
$ 1.7 billion borrowing programme to finance 12 projects. That<br />
decision was a breakthrough. It was a vote of confidence in<br />
Australia. The Premiers and the Commonwealth, meeting again in Loan Council<br />
in Canberra last Friday, endorsed that vote, with approval for<br />
a further 9 projects worth about $ 800 million.<br />
These decisions will mean that Australia's development will not be<br />
impeded because of inadequate supporting capital facilities,<br />
whether they be power plants, roads, coal loaders or ports. / 2 </p>

The major portion of last Friday's approvals almost $ 500 million<br />
worth covered electricity generation projects in N. S. W.,<br />
Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania. Basic resource<br />
development accounted for the remainder.<br />
The meeting was a fine example of how the Commonwealth and the<br />
States, working in tandem, can take decisions of vital importance<br />
for this nation as we move into the 1980' s and beyond.<br />
Energy, of course, is a key area of Government responsibility. As<br />
we move into the new decade and into a great new national<br />
development programme, the management of our vast energy reserves<br />
is an integral part of that development. The appointment of<br />
Senator Carrick a very senior Minister as head of the new<br />
Department of National Development and Energy, underlines our<br />
resolve to make the best possible use of our nation's resources.<br />
The availability and pricing of energy are at the core of the<br />
effective functioning of our economy and indeed, the world economy.<br />
The development of our energy resources, in partnership with<br />
State Governments and industry, works hand in hand with private<br />
sector investment, growth of industry and employment, trade policy,<br />
transport policy and foreign policy.<br />
We appreciate the need to strengthen our industrial base and<br />
encourage to its greatest extent the processing of Australian<br />
minerals by Australians. This year's programme of developmental<br />
projects will expedite the development of energy reserves<br />
which are alternatives to liquid fuels.<br />
The new programme will provide an unprecedented coal-fired power<br />
base for mining and manufacturing investment in Australia,<br />
including the domestic processing of our own raw materials.<br />
Australia is partly dependent on imported crude oil. But with<br />
prudent and imaginative policies our abundance of other energy<br />
reserves should be a growing source of wealth and prosperity in<br />
the years ahead.<br />
Of course, these great national development programmes will not be<br />
realised without an able work-force. The working men and women<br />
of Australia are equal to that task. The development programmes<br />
initiated by Loan Council last Friday will provide many thousands<br />
of new jobs. In the operational stages, in the construction stage,<br />
in supporting industries, and in the service sector, they will<br />
be the kind of jobs that Australians want. They will not be<br />
stop-gap jobs. The work opportunities that will be provided<br />
will be rewarding and long-lasting. They will be private sector<br />
jobs based on Australia's rich resources.<br />
In economic terms, it boils down to this: " The last four years<br />
have seen steady and sustainable growth in our international<br />
competitiveness and in our attraction of overseas investment".<br />
These are the criteria for employment growth. With our policies<br />
and our programmes, Australia will continue to grow and to prosper.<br />
