AUSTRALIA'S MILITARY COMMITMENT TO VIETNAM<br />
This Paper, which the Government has had<br />
prepared on the Australian involvement in<br />
Vietnam, is tabled in accordance with the<br />
Prime Minister's statement in the House of<br />
Representatives on Tuesday, 13 May, 1905. </p>
<p>AUSTRALIA'S MILITARY COMMITMENT TO SOUTH VIETNAM<br />
This paper has been prepared in accordance with a direction<br />
from the Prime Minister of Australia that an objective appraisal should<br />
be made of Australia' s military involvement in South Vietnam.<br />
The decision in April 1965 to send a battalion for active<br />
service in South Vietnam was the crucial issue in Australia's<br />
commitment. However, that decision can only be interpreted in the<br />
light of the development of Australian policy in the four preceding<br />
years, and the significance of the decision only appears in the two<br />
years following the decision when further forces were committed. This<br />
paper is therefore presented in three parts:<br />
Part 1 Australia Vietnam 1961-64<br />
Part 2 Australia Vietnam 1965<br />
Part 3 Australia Vietnam 1965-67<br />
To reduce the records of seven years of government ( 1961-67)<br />
to a few pages must inevitably result in over-simplification and the<br />
degree of over-simplification must be the measure of any distortion<br />
which results. In highlighting the main issues involved there are<br />
certain generalisations which can be made which will stand under<br />
detailed examination. These generalisations are based only on official<br />
documents and are concerned primarily with Australian provision of aid<br />
of a military nature to South Vietnam. No account is taken of<br />
Australia's domestic political issues, of party pressures or of public<br />
opinion, all of which played a large part in explaining the decisions<br />
and the negotiations mentioned in this paper.<br />
Despite the fact that the Government of South Vietnam on<br />
29 April 1965 announced that the Australian battalion was sent in<br />
, response to a request from South Vietnam, this is not borne out by the<br />
evidence of the documents.<br />
There were requests for aid of various sorts from South<br />
Vietnam to assist in its effort against growing communist insurgency,<br />
but the requests for military aid were largely generated by initiatives<br />
from the United States. These initiatives were political and not<br />
military in motive. The United States did not need the military aid<br />
but it did desire the military presence of its friends and allies in<br />
order to show to the world that the United States was not alone in<br />
its efforts against communism in South East Asia, to show that it was<br />
not replacing French colonialism in the area and in order to re-assure<br />
Governments indigenous to the Area that members of SEATO were in fact<br />
prepared to make a practical contribution to defence against communism.<br />
In providing aid the Australian Government always insisted<br />
that it should be acceptable to the South Vietnamese Government and<br />
many assurances to that effect were received from Vietnam. However, </p>
<p>-2<br />
in pursuing its paramount concern with the American alliance and<br />
Australian forward defence interests the Australian Government over<br />
a period of time showed in its actions and particularly in the process<br />
of negotiations minimal consideration for Vietnamese wishes.<br />
Nevertheless, the South Vietnamese attitude to the question<br />
of military aid was somewhat equivocal. At first they believed that<br />
they, the South Vietnamese, were capable of solving the problem of<br />
insurgency and they were opposed to the possibility of Western forces<br />
fighting on South Vietnamese soil and killing Vietnamese citizens<br />
whether of the North or the South. However, with the growing success<br />
of the insurgency and with the escalation of aid to the insurgents<br />
from North Vietnam, China and the Soviet Union, successive South<br />
Vietnamese Governments came to accept the realities of their political<br />
and military weaknesses and were prepared to accept Western military<br />
aid. This acceptance was often in response to American pressure.<br />
However, opposition remained; this opposition was due in part to a<br />
fear of the capital which opposition forces both in North and South<br />
Vietnam could make out of a Western presence, and in part to the<br />
national and military pride of the South Vietnamese people and<br />
particularly of the Generals. This produced an official state of mind<br />
which although prepared to accept a Western military presence as an<br />
undesirable necessity was still reluctant to ask directly for military<br />
aid. Moreover, there was widespread resentment of the increasingly<br />
insensitive actions of Western Governments in pressing aid upon them.<br />
Offers of aid could be accepted but direct requests were very<br />
reluctantly forthcoming and on occasion, only under pressure.<br />
Australian military assistance to South Vietnam was not at<br />
any time in response to a request for defence aid from South Vietnam<br />
as a Protocol State to SEATO as a Treaty organisation. Although<br />
successive Australian Governments sought publicly to justify their<br />
actions as being " in the context of" or " flowing from" Australia's<br />
membership of SEATO and the theory of the Protocol State or on the<br />
ground that military assistance under SEATO could be on a bilateral<br />
as well as a collective basis, the commitment was in fact made as a<br />
projection of the forward defence policy to which they were committed.<br />
Australian military aid to South Vietnam was in fact offered<br />
and supplied in response to the known and frequently expressed wishes<br />
of the United States for political support from its friends and allies,<br />
even though the offer of a battalion rather than an agreement to meet<br />
other specific requests from the United States was made to suit the<br />
interests of the Australian defence development program.<br />
The provision of military aid by Australia was decided upon<br />
for political reasons and was in support of the fundamental aim of<br />
Australian policy towards South Vietnam, which was to ensure the long<br />
term defence interests of Australia. These were seen in terms of the<br />
ANZUS and SEATO Treaties and the theory of forward defence against the<br />
victory of communism in South East Asia, an area seen as vital to<br />
Australia's future. This was a policy developed in Australia independently<br />
of any outside pressure. The cornerstone of this policy was </p>
<p>-3<br />
seen as a compelling necessity to commit the power of the United<br />
States to the Asian area and thus to commit her to a<br />
practical guarantee of active support to Australia through the ANZUS<br />
and SEATO Treaties. Australia's concern over the stability of South Vietnam as<br />
part of the general defence against communism in South East Asia grew<br />
in intensity in proportion to the growing success of communist<br />
insurgency in South Vietnam.<br />
Despite Australia's concern over Indonesia and the possibility,<br />
given Australian commitment in Malaysia, of over-committing Australia' s<br />
limited defence forces, the Australian Government wished to react<br />
positively to American hints for assistance. A growing bense of<br />
urgency as a result of insurgent success produced an increasing<br />
willingness at the political level to make further military commitments<br />
to the defence of South Vietnam. By December 1964 through January<br />
1965 this reached a peak where Australia's policy makers, being most<br />
anxious about what appeared to them to be hesitancy and confusion in<br />
America's policy, were eager to convince the United States of the need<br />
for more resolute policy and more active measures.<br />
The Australian Government' s four decisions 1965-67 to<br />
increase combat forces in Vietnam were logical extensions of the<br />
decision of April 1965. Negotiations concerning these extensions<br />
illustrate once again the dominance in Australian official thinking<br />
of the concept of forward defence, and the importance of the American<br />
alliance. The negotiations also reveal once again constant United<br />
States pressure at political, diplomatic and service levels. The<br />
period is marked also by little concern with Vietnam' s wishes and<br />
national sensitivities. There is one further problem which has been the subject of<br />
public debate but about which it is difficult to come to an~ . fif<br />
conclusion, that is the question as to when Australian forcesysecame<br />
actively involved in combat situations. There is no doubt about the<br />
official directives on this matter. When the first instructors were<br />
sent to South Vietnam, the directive to their Commanding Officer<br />
specifically precluded any activities other than those necessary to a<br />
training role unless the prior consent of the Australian Government had<br />
been obtained. Moreover, despite the wishes of the South Vietnamese<br />
Government to concentrate the Australian instructors in a northern<br />
province subject to insurgent activities, the instructors were located<br />
in base training areas and not in any province likely to be over-run<br />
by insurgents. However, the military authorities, recognising the<br />
realities of the situation, suggested that the instructors would<br />
probably be involved in combat situations produced by insurgent attacks.<br />
Nevertheless, the official directive was given precluding any activity<br />
other than the instructional role. When in May 1964 an additional<br />
instructors were sent to South Vietnam it was then agreed that the<br />
role of the AATTV should be extended to permit their employment in the<br />
field at battalion and lower levels as advisers, and it was recognised<br />
that, in the circumstances, casual~ ties were to be expected. So that </p>
<p>-4-<br />
the official record is clear, the decision to permit instructors to<br />
move into the field where it was probable that they would be involved<br />
in combat situations was not taken until May 1964. However, whether or<br />
not before May 1964 individual Australian instructors working with<br />
American units participated as advisers in the sort of active patrol<br />
activity that would bring them into " combat situations" can only be<br />
determined by a detailed examination of Australian and American unit<br />
and command reports. Certainly, the Australian authorities knew on<br />
23 May 1962 that the United States advisers were involved in combat<br />
situations nor was this denied publicly, although it was somewhat<br />
qualified in public announcements by the United States. </p>
<p>AUSTRALIA VIETNAM 1961-64<br />
Early in October 1961 the Australian Government became<br />
aware that the United States was so concerned at the situation in<br />
South Vietnam that it was considering military intervention.<br />
Australian intelligence sources took a similarly pessimistic view,<br />
reporting during November 1961 that within six months Government<br />
forces in South Vietnam might be incapable of mounting significant<br />
offensive operations without massive assistance and that<br />
intervention on the scale of at least two divisions would be<br />
necessary if an adequate breathing space against Viet Cong attacks<br />
were to be ensured. There were nevertheless doubts among some<br />
Australian officials that such assistance would prove effective.<br />
The Charge d'Affaires in Saigon admitted in November 1961 that he<br />
had " serious doubts about the efficacy of introducing Western<br />
ground troops", although he believed that President Diem and his<br />
officials would welcome them; he suggested, however, that Western<br />
naval and air forces could make an important contribution. The<br />
Australian defence authorities considered that although foreign<br />
intervention might contain and even eradicate Viet Cong control<br />
( providing access through neighbouring borders could be sealed<br />
off) it would not be capable of removing the Viet Cong influence<br />
which had been felt by so many for so long.<br />
on 17 November 1961 the Australian Ambassador in<br />
Washington was officially informed that the United States was<br />
considering increasing its assistance to the Republic of Vietnam,<br />
although this assistance would be in the form of equipment,<br />
transport, training and advisers rather than combat forces; an<br />
indication of Australia' s views and willingness to assist was<br />
requested. The Australian Prime Minister replied on 26 November<br />
that he was examining the possibility of increasing Australian<br />
assistance to the Republic of Vietnam and hoped to be able to make<br />
a decision after the coming Federal election.<br />
The first Australian initiative came, however, from~ the<br />
Ambassador in Washington who reported on 5 December that<br />
demonstrable Australian support for the Republic of Vietnam would<br />
make a very favourable impression on the United States Administration<br />
and suggested that Australia might supply counter-insurgency<br />
training personnel, small arms and ammunition. These suggestions<br />
were discussed by representatives of the Departments of External<br />
Affairs, Defence, Navy, Army and Air on 14 December. It was<br />
clear from this meeting that the motivation for providing<br />
assistance was predominantly political and that the Services were<br />
unwilling, for manpower reasons, to make more than a token<br />
commitment to the Republic of Vietnam. Accordingly the Ambassador<br />
in Washington was informed on 19 December that while Australia<br />
could supply some small arms and ammunition it could make no more<br />
thaA' a token contribution in training. </p>
<p>6-<br />
Suggestions from the United States Administration that<br />
Australia should give military aid to the Republic of Vietnam were<br />
clearly initiated by the State Department rather than the Pentagon.<br />
The United States military authorities in Saigon told the<br />
Australian Ambassador to the Republic of Vietnam in December 1961<br />
that no Australian assistance was required in either training or<br />
the supply of arms and ammunition. The United States Ambassador<br />
to the Republic of Vietnam said, however, that he regarded an<br />
early increase in the Australian contribution ( he appears to have<br />
had in mind the use of military personnel at least for the protection<br />
of civilian projects) as a matter of the highest importance. On<br />
16 February 1962 the Australian Ambassador in Washington reported<br />
that there had been considerable resistance in the Pentagon to the<br />
use of non-American foreign military personnel in South Vietnam,<br />
but that the Pentagon had now agreed to a State Department<br />
proposal to ask Australia for counter-insurgency and jungle fighting<br />
instructors. During March 1962 Australia received two approaches from<br />
the Republic of Vietnam on the question of military assistance.<br />
On 13 March the Australian Ambassador in Saigon reported that the<br />
Republic of Vietnam . s Assistant Defence Minister had asked if<br />
Australian military in-3tructors in Malaya could assist in the<br />
training ( in Malaya) of the Vietnamest= Civil Guard. On 31 March<br />
President Diem wrote to the Australian Prime Minister, setting out<br />
the Republic of Vitnms case against the communists and noting<br />
that the Republic " has been compelled to appeal for increased<br />
military assistance and support from Free World countries to help<br />
prevent it from being overwhelmed". The message concluded by<br />
requesting that Australia. should condemn communist aggression.<br />
Between February and May 1962 Australian policy moved<br />
towards military assistance to South Vietnam. On 16 February the<br />
Ambassador in Washington cabled a recommendation that any American<br />
request should be considered favourably because the provision of<br />
even a handful of instructors would help make Australia's mark<br />
with the United States Administration. On receipt of this cable<br />
the Minister for External Affairs asked the Minister for Defence<br />
if the Australian Army could supply suitable officers for training<br />
work in South Vietnam and the latter replied on 14 March that<br />
while Australia could make no more than a token contribution in<br />
training it would be possible to make available 10 officers and<br />
some warrant and non-commissioned officers. At the ANZUS Council<br />
meeting in Canberra on 9 May the Prime Minister told Admiral ! ILD. Felt,<br />
Commander of the United States Pacific Fleet, that Australia was<br />
willing to supply instructors and this decision was endorsed by<br />
Ministers on 15 May, provided that a request was received from<br />
the Republic of Vietnam. Although Felt admitted that Australian<br />
military assistance was not at that time needed, he said that<br />
America regarded our military presence in South Vietnam as most<br />
important and suggested that we might also supply two radar patrol<br />
ships, engineer units, a signals unit and one transport aircraft. </p>
<p>-7<br />
These suggestions were made known to Ministers on 15 May and although<br />
no specific decisions were made it was agreed that any early<br />
disposition of Australian military forces in South East Asia should<br />
be at the request of the Government involved and preferably carried<br />
out as part of a SEATO operation, to avoid the appearance of a non-<br />
Asian intervention. Two days later the defence authorities agreed<br />
that Australia should offer up to 30 Army training personnel and<br />
one Dakota transport aircraft, but Feltos suggestion of two radar<br />
patrol vessels was not approved.<br />
On 24 May 1962 the Minister for Defence announced<br />
publicly that Australia. was providing military instructors "' at the<br />
invitation of the Government of the Republic of Vietnam". The<br />
correctness of this claim is, however, a matter of interpretation,<br />
unless the Republic of Vietnam's appinaches in March are to be<br />
considered a sufficient invitation. The Australian offer was<br />
communicated to President Diem on 10 May by Admiral Felt, who had<br />
flown straight to Saigon from the ANZUS meeting. Diem was<br />
reported to have expressed great satisfaction. On 18 May the<br />
Republic of Vietnam's Ambassador in Canberra informed the Department<br />
of External Affairs that his Government accepted with pleasure<br />
Australia's offer of instructors, but there appears to have been<br />
no direct approach by Australia until 25 May, when the Ambassador<br />
in Saigon handed a copy uf the Deftnce Minister's statement<br />
( already made public in Australia) to Diem; the latter again<br />
expressed great satisfa~ ction and asked for his appreciation to be<br />
conveyed to the Australian Government<br />
Military 6dvisers recognised that Australian instructors<br />
would be liable to Viet Cong attack at any time and would probably<br />
have to carry arms. The probability that they would become<br />
involved in operations against the Viet Cong was not explicitly<br />
stated in the Defence Minister s public announcementalthough it<br />
could be argued that it was implied. However the official<br />
directive to the Commander of the force forbade any activity other<br />
than training. There remained only a. decision on how the Australian<br />
instructors were to be employed. The Government of the Republic of<br />
Vietnam at first wanted them to establish an independent jungle<br />
training school in the northern province of Quang Ngai, an area in<br />
which Diem feared a Viet Cong breakthrough. Diem's reasoning<br />
appears to have bnen that commitment to such an area ( he likened<br />
it to the Dardanelles) would encourage a deeper Australian<br />
involvement and that any disaster there might lead to massive<br />
third nation intervention. The future leader of the Australian<br />
team visited Quang Ngai and reported that it would be a difficult<br />
but challenging project within the capacity of the team, but it was<br />
strongly opposed by both United States and Australian army<br />
authorities, the latter arguing that it was an area of high Viet<br />
Cong activity in which the team would be likely to become involved<br />
in action outside the instructional field; there was, in any case,<br />
no United States logistic support available and it was undesirable </p>
<p>-8<br />
to have to depend on South Vietnamese forces. It was then<br />
recommended that the team be divided and integrated with United<br />
States staff, 4 instructors going to headquarters in Saigon, 22 to<br />
three locations in the Hue area and 4 to Due My ( near Nha Trang).<br />
The allocation of the instructors to training establishments was<br />
announced by the Minister for Defence on 26 July 1962, approval of<br />
the terms of the announcement having already been received from the<br />
Republic of Vietnam. The Minister for External Affairs was<br />
obviously disappointed that the political impact of the Australian<br />
contribution should have been diminished by the team's dispersal<br />
and integration with the United States instructors. Three months<br />
later the Minister for External Affairs asked the Minister for<br />
Defence if more instructors could be provided for South Vietnam,<br />
but this suggestion was opposed by the Army because of the strain<br />
it would place on manpower resources.<br />
The next request for assistance came on 14 February 1963<br />
when the Australian Ambassador in Saigon reported that the United<br />
States might ask Australia for a small R. A. A. F. component. He<br />
recommended sympathetic consideration of such a request on the<br />
grounds that the Americans believed that they were winning the war<br />
and that it was time for Australia to make a contribution and get<br />
some share of the credit. The Ambassador was told that Australia<br />
would prefer not to receive sbich a request and he communicated this<br />
to the United States authorities in Saigon, but on 2 April Australia<br />
nevertheless retceived a United SLates request for one Dakota<br />
squadron and 16 additional pilots. The real difficulty posed by<br />
this request was the need to explain a. change from a non-combatant<br />
to a combatant role to the Au~ tralian public. The formal reason<br />
for refusal, which was convcyed to Admiral Felt on 4 April 1963,<br />
was that the possible re-equipment of R. A. A. FO transport with<br />
Caribou aircraft made the supply of Dakotas impossible. The<br />
following month the United States -again asked for 16 R. A. A. F.<br />
Dakota pilots, the request being re-inforced by representations<br />
from the Republic of Vietnam' s Ambassador in Canberra on 24 May<br />
1963. Defence opposed the request because of manpower shortage<br />
and although External Affairs saw some merit in accepting it was<br />
decided that the Army training team was sufficient to demonstrate<br />
Australian support for the United States.<br />
At the April 1964 SEATO Council meeting in Manila it was<br />
agreed that members should if necessary be prepared to take further<br />
concrete steps to support the Republic of Vietnam. On 6 May 1964<br />
the United States Embassy in Canberra delivered a note to the<br />
Department of External Affairs which emphasised President Johnson0' s<br />
desire for more free world countries to " show their flags" in<br />
South Vietnam, listed existing non-American assistance and suggested<br />
that Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom might between them<br />
provide a range of army and air training personnel, pilots,<br />
reconnaissance aircraft, forward air controllers, communications<br />
engineers, shipyard advisers and medical and dental teams. A few<br />
days later the United States Embassy in Canberra delivered a more<br />
detailed list of items specifically requested from Australia. It<br />
included: </p>
<p>a minimum of 6 three-man battalion adviser teams<br />
an additional training cadre for corps centre<br />
additional special forces personnel<br />
a. helicopter unit<br />
a fixed wing observation and liaison unit<br />
a fixed wing transport unit<br />
2 or 3 surgical teams.<br />
Both the Australian Embassy in Washington and the<br />
Department of External Affairs urged that the American request<br />
should be considered sympathetically. The former cabled on 11 May<br />
1964 that while it was appreciated that there were physical<br />
limitations to what the Commonwealth could do it was recommended<br />
that we should make as prompt and positive a response as possible.<br />
South Vietnam was an area in which we could, without disproportionate<br />
expenditure, pick up a lot of credit with the United States. Our<br />
objective should be to achieve such an habitual closeness of relations<br />
with the United States and sense of mutuail alliance that in our time<br />
of need ( the possibility of a crisis in relations with Indonesia) the<br />
United States would have little option but to respond as we would<br />
want. In Canberra a Department of External Affairs memorandum<br />
suggested that:, while the value of the Australian training team<br />
should not be underestimated, our main object in providing<br />
additional assistance wa~ s that of supporting the United States and<br />
encouraging Thailand. The Minister for External Affairs appears to<br />
have shared these vitw-, sending a cable to the Embassy in Washington<br />
on 14 May which said " We should like the United States Government to<br />
know that we are anxious to rEply promptly and sympathetically to<br />
their suggestions" The United States prapoba16 were referred for consideration<br />
to the relevant defence advisers who reported that South Vietnam was<br />
a key strategic area and that if it. fell the West would be unlikely<br />
to hold Laos, Cambodia and Thailand; this would in turn make the<br />
future of Malaysia, Indonesia and the 7hilippines very uncertain. A<br />
further argument in favour of increased assistance was that it would<br />
influence the obligation -which the United States might feel to<br />
Australia in an emergency. After examining the resources and<br />
commitments of the types of personnel an d equipment requested they<br />
recommended that Australia could offer:<br />
an additional 30 N. C. O. s for the army training team<br />
an army dental team<br />
an army driving/ servicing instructional team together<br />
with a light aid workshop detachment<br />
a detachmenc of 6 Caribou transport aircraft<br />
( by October 1964).<br />
It was also recommended that the role of the army training team<br />
should be extended to permit its employment in the field at battalion<br />
and lower levels as advisers. These recommendations were accepted </p>
<p>10<br />
by Ministers on 29 May. It was recognised that Australian casualties<br />
must be expected if the army training team were to be employed in the<br />
field. Details of the Australian decision were cabled immediately<br />
to the Australian Ambassador in Saigon with instructions to inform<br />
the Government of the Republic of Vietnam. The Vietnamese Ambassador<br />
in Canberra was informed the same day and reminded of his earlier<br />
discussions with the Department of External Affairs. The Ambassador<br />
agreed that Australia could announce that the increased aid was being<br />
made after consultation with the South Vietnamese and United States<br />
Governments. The Australian Ambassador in Saigon later reported that<br />
Acting Foreign Minister Mau had expressed warm appreciation of the<br />
decision and agreed with the reference to prior consultations with<br />
the South Vietnamese and United States Governments.<br />
The final arrangements were, however, delayed by doubts as<br />
to whether all the assistance offered was actually needed. Mau told<br />
the Australian Ambassador on 1 June that Australia could take it<br />
that there was a requirement for all aid items proposed, but the<br />
United States Charge d'Affaires and military authorities in Saigon<br />
subsequently stated that there was no military requirement for the<br />
army dental teams, the army driving/ servicing instructional team or<br />
the light aid workshop det. chment. They suggested that Australia<br />
should instead send an additional 2. army training personnel. In<br />
consequence the public announcement of Australia's increased<br />
commitment made by the Minister for Defence on 9 June omitted the<br />
items not required by the United States authorities, but noted that<br />
consultations were proceeding for the provision of some 20 army<br />
instructors in addition to the 60 already definitely committed. The<br />
text of the Minister's statement were forwarded to Saigon to allow a<br />
parallel announcement there, but the Vietnamese were given no prior<br />
warning of the changes in the Australian contribution. The Vietnamese<br />
Foreign Minister was also given the text of the announcement and on<br />
June he wrote to the Australian Ambassador expressing his " keen<br />
satisfaction" at the imminent arrival of .30 new instructors and the<br />
Caribou aircraft and at the prospect that 20 other technicians<br />
might also be sent. On L7 June the Australian Ambassador reported<br />
that the Embassy in Saigon had been mildly embarrassed by<br />
successive instructions from Canberra to inform the Vietnamese of<br />
Australia's decision to provide additional aid, to ask the<br />
Vietnamese if these items were needed and then, having been assured<br />
that they were needed, to inforn the Vietnamese chat some of them<br />
would not be provided.<br />
The United States military authorities' request for a<br />
third group of Australian army advisers was supported by a senior<br />
Australian officer who visited Saigon in June 1964 and the team was<br />
increased in number from 60 to 83. The team suffered its first<br />
combat casualty ( one soldier had been accidentally killed on 1 June<br />
1963) on 6 June 1964 when Warrant Officer K. G. Conway was killed<br />
during a Viet Cong attack on a special forces camp 35 miles west<br />
of Da Nang. </p>
<p>11<br />
During July 1964 the Prime Minister of the Republic of<br />
Vietnam, General Khanh, addressed a written appeal for assistance to<br />
the Heads of Government of 34 countries, including Australia. As<br />
translated and published in Saigon on 25 July the letter expressed the<br />
firm hope " that your government will kindly grant us all the support<br />
you deem possible and opportune in order to help us successfully fight<br />
the Communist aggression". In Australia's case this written approach<br />
was followed up on 5 August by the Republic of Vietnam's Ambassador<br />
in Canberra, who called on the Acting Secretary of the Department of<br />
External Affairs to formally thank Australia for assistance already<br />
given and to request " continuing help". There was no direct Australian<br />
response to these requests, although the Minister for External Affairs<br />
wrote to a number of countries commending General Khanh's appeal.<br />
The Austra. lian Government. continued to view with concern<br />
the deteriorating political and military situation in South Vietnam.<br />
On 3 September 1964 the Minist. r for External Affairs sent a cable to<br />
all Australian representatives abroad emphasising that our national<br />
interests were to<br />
help a government in South Vietnam which would<br />
continue to fight the Viet Cong, oppose North<br />
Vietnam and give some hope of eventually unifying<br />
the : ountry<br />
retain an ac. tivn Uni. t. ed Sta. es presence in<br />
South Vietnam<br />
Spreveat a failure in South Vietnam which would lead<br />
to a collapse of the will to resist, in other countries.<br />
Australia also sought to gain a clearer idea of how far the<br />
Americans were prepared to compipr. them-e. lve. s in Vietnam, but it became<br />
evident that the Ur. it,-d States would maintain only a holding<br />
operation until after the November presidential Clectiono Once the<br />
electioh was over the m. om. ntum of American policy, encouraged by the<br />
ever= worsening situation i. n Vitn. rbam, began to increase. The<br />
Australian Minist. er for External Affairs, who visited Washington in<br />
late November, was tcl. d by D,. feo. ce. Secretary McNamata that if it<br />
became necessary to apply i. ncr. etased pressure on North Vietnam by air<br />
attack it. would be very helpful tc have. Australian aircraft ( ei. her<br />
participating or standing by to protect Thailand, Laos and South<br />
Vietnam. McNamara said that the United States would be looking<br />
chiefly for a public demonstration of Australian support.. On 4<br />
December 1964, White House Adviser William Bundy gave the Ambassador<br />
in Washington a clearer indication of the directi. on of American policy.<br />
This envisaged that, although the instability of the Government of<br />
the Republic of Vietnam at present precluded a sharp new program, any<br />
further dramatic activity by the Vi. et Cong would be opposed by air<br />
strikes in North. Viet. nam and the stationing of surface-to-air missiles<br />
and one division or two battalions of United States marines near the<br />
border between Nort. h and South Vietnam. Bundy said Australia might.<br />
contribute 200 extra combat advisers to such a force, but he did not<br />
have in mind the use of Australian fighter aircraft.<br />
On 10 December 1964 the Republic of Vietnam. Prime Minister<br />
( Huong) made a strong direct request for increased Australian military<br />
assistance to the Australian Minister for Air, who was then visiting </p>
<p>12<br />
Saigon. Huong asked for more army instructors and air assistance<br />
and argued that Australia's security depended on the survival of<br />
South Vietnam; the Americans, he said, felt lonely and hesitant in<br />
their present position and needed stiffening by the support of<br />
nations like Australia. However, the Australian Ambassador<br />
believed that this request was inspired by the United States.<br />
No doubt prompted by the trend of events in Washington,<br />
Defence already had increased Australian assistance under<br />
consideration when Huong's appeal was received. On 11 December a<br />
committee reported that Australia could supply:.<br />
one infantry battalion<br />
one squadron of the SAS Rngiment<br />
logistic support elements<br />
approximately 10 additional army instructors<br />
HMAS ydney'and 2 frigates/ destroyers for<br />
transporting the above.<br />
Three days later, however, the Prime Minister received a message<br />
from President Johnson which suggested that Australia provide:<br />
200 additional combat advisers<br />
minesweepers LSTS salvage and repair ships<br />
hospital ships.<br />
The list appears to have been drawn up without an adequate knowledge<br />
of the equipment of the Australian armed services, which did not<br />
possess any of the last three items. The recommendation from<br />
Defence, reported on ' 16 December, was that Australia could supply<br />
17 more instructors ( bringing the team in Vietnam up to a total of<br />
100), but that commitments in Malaysian -waters would make it<br />
undesirable and perhaps impracticable to offer any minesweepers.<br />
The Prime Minister sent a personal message to President Johnson on<br />
18 December informing him that Australia was unable to supply<br />
either the ships requested or any significant number of army<br />
instructors. Australia was however willing to send representatives<br />
to discuss the possible positioning of United States, Australian and<br />
New Zealand troops in the northern parts of South Vietnam. This was<br />
followed by a cable from the Minister for External Affairs to the<br />
Australian Ambassador in Washington on 22 December which emphasised<br />
that while Australia was not qualifying her support for the American<br />
effort in South Vietnam, it was important to know how far the<br />
United States was prepared to go and what would be the outcome of<br />
escalation and/ or negotiation. </p>
<p>13<br />
AUSTRALIA-VIETNAM 1965<br />
The Decision The fundamental reasons for Australia's providing<br />
combatant ground forces in South Vietnam in 1965 are vividly<br />
demonstrated in negotiations between the time in December 1964 when<br />
Australia agreed to contingency staff talks concerning the possibility<br />
of sending troops to South Vietnam, and the actual offer of the<br />
battalion in April 1965.<br />
Ihe basic concept behind the Australian action was that of<br />
forward defence. This rested in turn on a belief in the fundamental<br />
strategic importance in Australia's defence of the South East Asia<br />
area, and on the necessity to prevent the spread of communism and<br />
political instability in the area. Gliven Australia's military<br />
weakness, this policy had to depend for success upon membership of<br />
ANZUS and SEATO, and above all upon the presence of the United<br />
States in the area. To this end it was Australia's aim to ensure<br />
that the United States did not waver in its commitment to South East<br />
Asia and to support the American presence politically, diplomatically<br />
and if necessary militarily. It was believed that only by these<br />
methods could real mEaning be given to the ANZUS Agreement and<br />
Australia's defence bE assured. All these elements appear in the<br />
following review of Austratia's diplomatic activity during the<br />
period January to April ' 19b5.<br />
On 7 January 1965 Australia's Ambassadors in Washington and<br />
Saigon were informed that Ministers were gravely cuncerned at the<br />
outlook in Vietna~ m and recognised the necess ity of taking whatever<br />
steps were puossible-to advance Australia's vital interest in securing<br />
success in So-uth Viet-ram. On .5 January Washington reported long<br />
discussions with the United States officials as to their purpose and<br />
aims, from which it became clear that military staff talks with<br />
Australia must remain in suspense until the political situation in<br />
Saigon was stabilibed. The Australian Ambassador supported the<br />
United States idea uf applying progressive-pressure to North Vietnam<br />
in order to bring Hanoi to nlegotiate. A further report received on<br />
the 7th from Washington explained that United States policy was once<br />
again in the doldrums, nor was it expected that mounting military<br />
pressure upon North Vietnam would be decided upon even after the<br />
American elections. Apparently the President preferred that the<br />
United States should " muddle along" in South Vietnam trying to do<br />
better with policies which had not succeeded in the past. Again on<br />
13 January the Embassy in Washington reported that the political<br />
situation in Saigon -was not suitable for the introduction of phase 2<br />
of America's plans for escalating pressure. The United States was<br />
not prepared to move. In1 Australia. on 13 January military<br />
authorities made an assessment of the current military situation and<br />
concluded that the prospects of victory had become more remote.<br />
They were convinced that without strong and stable leadership or<br />
without the introduction of a new factor such as counter action by<br />
the United States or other nations the situation would deteriorate<br />
Lfurther. </p>
<p>14<br />
At departmental consultations in Canberra on 15 January, it<br />
was decided that Australia should be forthcoming with the Americans<br />
and that she should encourage the United States to plan for phase 2<br />
( that is for air strikes between the 17th and 19th Parallels<br />
directed against infiltration from the North). Australiaos<br />
willingness to take part in military talks was once more expressed.<br />
On 16 January in Saigon the Americans again raised the question of<br />
Australian aid, saying that the greatest need was for combat<br />
advisers. The next day the Australian Government decided to promise<br />
full public and diplomatic support for the United States if that<br />
country decided upon increased military activity. However on the<br />
19th the Embassy in Washington reported that the United States was<br />
still worried over Saigon's political instability but that military<br />
staff talks with Australia would be relevant if the situation<br />
improved. On 19 January lengthy Ministerial instructions were sent<br />
from Canberra to Washington. Once again the Ambassador was informed<br />
of Australia's grave concern at the outlook and instructed that he<br />
should take advantage of any opportunity to bring certainty to<br />
American policy and planning. He was to be tactful because of the<br />
disproportion in power between Australia and the United States, but<br />
he was to suggest that Australia would give full public and diplomatic<br />
support if the United States were to initiate air strikes against<br />
North Vietnam's infiltration sybtem. He was informed that the<br />
Government did not belicvte that the Viet Cong threat was negotiable<br />
at that stage, but the Government was also worried about the<br />
Indonesian situation and would not support a call for a Geneva<br />
Conference if air strikes resulted in buch a suggestion. When these<br />
views were put to Bundy on 21 January his reply was that the<br />
President would surely say that if we were so concerned then why<br />
could we not contribute 50 more instructors? The necessities of<br />
Australian defence expansion were again explained. Bundy a-gain<br />
pointed out that there could * be no escalation inL Vietnam until the<br />
Saigon Governmerit proved itself. The Ambassador made three points<br />
to Bundy-he emphasised Australia's anxiety over the situation in<br />
South Vietnam, chat it seemed to be that a coherent plan for<br />
increasing pressure on North Vietnam was no longer in operation, and<br />
that Australia was willing to give what help was possible. He<br />
concluded his report by saying that Australia must keep up the<br />
pressure. On 26 January the Ambassador reported that the Australian<br />
Prime Minister visiting Washington shared the anxiety at the way<br />
things were going and thought he might assure the President that we<br />
would support him politically and militarily if pre-emptive landings<br />
became necessary. On 28 January the Acting Prime Minister agreeing<br />
with the Minister for External Affairs sent a message to the<br />
Australian Prime Minister in London expressing the view that<br />
Australia should be concerned to sustain the Americans in their<br />
commitment to Vietnam while Australia. was doing its share in<br />
Malaysia. </p>
<p>On 29 January the Minister for Defence raised with the<br />
Americans in Saigon the possibility of stepping up the campaign. On<br />
2 February the'Ambassador in Washington reported that we needed to<br />
do all in our power to strengthen the American resolve, to follow a<br />
firm line based on a credible threat against North Vietnam. It was<br />
suggested also that an attempt should be made to clarify the extent<br />
of the United States commitment to ANZUS. With this last point the<br />
Minister for External Affairs disagreed, preferring to concentrate<br />
on the essential purpose which he supposed was to remove any<br />
hesitation on the part of the Americans and with Australia's<br />
limited resources to go with them but not rush out in front. On<br />
4 February Forrestal in Canberra explained that support for<br />
America from other countries and Australia was needed because it<br />
was important politically. In reply Forrestal was informed that it<br />
was feasible for Australia to make a combat battalion available for<br />
service in South East Asia if the Australian Government so decided.<br />
On 7 February Washington reported South Vietnamese and<br />
United States air strikes against targets in North Vietnam in<br />
retaliation for Viet Cong attacks on United States bases and<br />
barracks. Australian Ministers supported the action. On 9 February<br />
the Australian Minister fur Defence told Governor Harriman in<br />
Washington that Australia. was still ready to enter into military<br />
staff talks concerning phase 2 operation6 just as the Prime Minister<br />
had told President J l~~~ the previouz, D _ cember. On 10 February<br />
the Minister for Defence reported frrr Washington that the United<br />
States was at the edge of entering phase 2 and again pointed out,<br />
this time to Bundy, that Australia Wa ready to enter military<br />
staff talks. He refe-rred to Australia's own need for i, 000<br />
instructors, wThich explained our inability to meet United States<br />
requests of this type. When the Minister raised the possibility of<br />
a SEATO operation in Vietnam, Bundy pointed out that for SEATO to<br />
operate South Vietnam would h-, V tLoO dppeal for-help and he doubted<br />
that this was wise fur fear of tt-fusai1 by some members. The same<br />
day the Australian Amrba! ssddur coImm-ented on the new spirit of urgency<br />
and robustness in the United S~ aLLe6 Administration, and believed<br />
the ' beginning of phase 2 wao close. However the stage was not yet<br />
reached w~ herLe staff Lalki could begin. The Minister for External.<br />
Affairs repeated that the Australian aim should be to remove any<br />
hesitation on the part of the Americans and within our limited<br />
resources to give what aid we could. On 18 February the Mini ' ster<br />
repeated to Washington his strong support for all the Americans had<br />
done and his hope that in the imakediate situation the only<br />
determinant of American action would be the effect such action<br />
would have in checking aggres~ ion and strengthening morale in<br />
Saigon. On 20 T'ebruary came the news that the United States was<br />
prepared to inaugurate the staff talks and believed that it would be<br />
necessary to put in substantial1 ground forces but not in the style<br />
of pre-emptive landings as in the phase 2 plans. This was<br />
reinforced by a report that the United States was not at present<br />
considering any initiatives which might lead to peace talks. On<br />
24 February Australia. officially agreed to participate in the<br />
talks but emphasised that this was not an agreement to contribute </p>
<p>16<br />
ground forces, and that further information as to the planned use of<br />
forces was required. Full departmental consideration followed in<br />
Canberra. Emphasis was again laid on the strategic importance of<br />
South Vietnam and the necessity to give public and diplomatic<br />
support to the American program of increased pressure on North<br />
Vietnam. More information on United States thinking was requested.<br />
On 29 Match the Government informed its Ambassador in Washington<br />
that their firm support for America's present action was based on<br />
the belief that in the present circumstances it would check<br />
aggression, restore confidence in South Vietnam and lead towards<br />
an acceptable settlement.<br />
On 4 April the report on the staff talks in Honolulu was<br />
received in Canberra. The conclusion was that the United States<br />
wished to have a contribution of Australian forces in South Vietnam.<br />
If approved, it was assumed that a request from the South Vietnamese<br />
Government would follow. The Australian representative at the talks<br />
believed that Australia should offer a battalion to the defence of<br />
such a strategically important area. On 6 April Australian military<br />
authorities confirmed the recommendation, believing that it was vital<br />
to Australiaos strategic interests to have a strong United States<br />
military presence in South East Asia., and that it was essential to<br />
show a readinei3s to a. ssist the United States to achieve her aims in<br />
South Vietnam. Australia should therefore offer a battalion. On<br />
7 April the Government agreed to the recommendation and on 8 April<br />
received a me5sage from Saigon that the United States was pleased with'<br />
the Honolulu thslks und that their officials had once more stressed the<br />
value in South Vietnam of " Third Country" flags. It was also<br />
reported that the Premier of the Republic of Vietnam, Dr Quat,<br />
appreciated the military tequiremEnt. b ut had to move cautiously in<br />
view of possible opposition from nationalist elements.<br />
On 9 April the Government decision was explained to the<br />
Australian Ambassador in Washington. The Government had agreed tc<br />
accede to what amounted to a request even though the United States<br />
had stopped short of making a formal request. The Government<br />
believed that the Australian battalion would be important in itself<br />
and of great importance in present and future Australian-American<br />
defence relationships. It ws decided also that when informing the<br />
United States Government of the decision to offer a battalion it<br />
should be pointed out that this would disperse Australian forces<br />
further and would thus limit the Government's military capacity<br />
elsewhere in South East Asia and New Guinea.. Therefore Australia<br />
must look for support from both the United States and British<br />
Governments in dealing with difficulties elsewhere.<br />
However, it was nut until 13 April that the Ambassador<br />
reported that he had made the offer of a. battalion. The delay is<br />
explained by the e fft~ ct of President Johnson' s address at Johns<br />
Hopkins University: it was thought that this address indicated that<br />
the United States was again considering the possibility of<br />
negotiation, in which case the offer of a battalion would have been<br />
inappropriate. The offer was made to the Secretary of State on<br />
13 April and the Secretary responded that the President would be </p>
<p>1.7=<br />
most appreciative and that in his own opinion the sooner the battalion<br />
was provided the better. The Ambassador also reported that the<br />
Secretary had taken the point that the further dispersal of Australian<br />
forces might require Australia to look for support from the United<br />
States and that the President was fully aware of the United States<br />
commitment pursuant to the ANZUS Treaty.<br />
The Matter of the Request<br />
In the first instance, therefore, the offer of troops by<br />
Australia was trade to the Unitcd States and not to South Vietnam.<br />
Article IV paragraph 3 of the SEATO Treaty stipulates that<br />
" 1no action on the territory of any state designated under paragraph 1<br />
of this Article or in any territory so designated shall be taken<br />
except at the invitation or with the consent of the government<br />
concerned". As the Australian Government used the " umbrella" of the<br />
Treaty publicly to justify its policies in South Vietnam, the<br />
question of invitation or consent on the part of the South Vietnamese<br />
Government requires consideration.<br />
The Australian Government was aware of and participated<br />
with the United States in attempts to elicit the necessary formal<br />
request. These efforts took place between 9 and 29 April. The<br />
negotiations revteal the methods used and the degree of spontaneity<br />
behind the Vietnamese request.<br />
On 9 Aprii the Australian Ambassador in Washington<br />
reported that the requebt would have to come as a matter of form<br />
from the South Vietnamese Government. He added that the State<br />
Department had given instructions that Quat should be specifically<br />
asked to request Australia to supply the battalion.<br />
Despite earlier reports that South Vietnam had been<br />
informed of Australia's willingness to contribute if requested, on<br />
12 April the Australian Ambassador in Washington reported that he<br />
had been advised that General Taylor, the United States Ambassador<br />
in Saigon, had not yet raised the question of the Australian battalion<br />
with the South Vietnamese Government. On the previous day the<br />
Australian Ambassador in Saigon had reported that, given South<br />
Vietnamese nationalist sensitivity and the fragility of the political<br />
front, he saw advantages in having prior consultations with the<br />
South Vietnamese rather than simply having them informed by the<br />
Americans that Australia would respond to a request. Otherwise,<br />
Australian action would be seen as implying that the Australian offer<br />
was prompted exclusively by American advice and the relationship<br />
with the United States, and Lhat Australia was indifferent or<br />
insensitive to Vietnamese needs, taking their eventual request for<br />
granted and not considering them genuinely independent. On 13 April<br />
the Australian Ambassador in Saigon reported that in Taylor's opinion<br />
it would be better if he, together with the Australian Ambassador,<br />
called upon Quat when the time came to inform him of the Australian </p>
<p>18<br />
Government's readiness to supply a battalion if requested. However<br />
in Washington the American view seemed to be that expressed by<br />
Rusk, also on 13 April, that it would be better for Taylor, by<br />
himself, to sound out Quat before Australia's offer was made.<br />
After discussion among Ministers in Canberra as to<br />
whether or not they should work only through the Americans, it was<br />
agreed on 21 April that the American and Australian Ambassadors<br />
should together see Quat in order to obtain agreement from the<br />
Vietnamese. However in Washington Bundy~ s reaction to this<br />
suggestion was that it would be better for Taylor to see Quat first<br />
to make the point that Australia was ready to contribute if<br />
requested, and only then should the Australian Ambassador approach<br />
the South Vietnamese. The Australian Ambassador again pressed for<br />
a joint approach, to which Bundy now agreed. However in Saigon on<br />
24 April Taylor in fact followed the course outlined by Bundy and<br />
raised the matter with Quat by himself. As a result, the Australian<br />
Ambassador in Saigon on 24 April sought and on 27 April obtained<br />
Canberra's approval to see Quat alone but he was unable to do so<br />
until 28 April. Meanwhile on 26 April the Australian Ambassador had<br />
reported from Washington that Quat had not yet given his agreement<br />
and that no one knew when he would do so. It was felt that Taylor<br />
would have to speak to Quat again if he did not reply very soon.<br />
The Australian Government on 27 April indicated that it was<br />
anxious that a request should be obtained as early as possible, but<br />
on the same day Sai'gon again advised Canberra that because of<br />
Vietnamese sensitivities it would seem desirable in any public<br />
announcement to include references both to the Vietnamese request<br />
and to prior consultations among the Vietnamese, the United<br />
States and Australian Governments. On 28 April the Australian<br />
Ambassador in Saigon expressed a. hcpe that the Vietnamese could be<br />
given prior guidance on the content cf the Prime Minister's planned<br />
statement as consultation with them on the present proposal had<br />
been minimal. He also reported that Quat had on 27 April welcomed<br />
the Australian Government's offer and agreed to an announcement by<br />
the Australian Prime Minister of the decision to provide a<br />
battalion in response to a Vietnamese request. Later, on 29 April,<br />
the Ambassador reported that Quat had not handed him a forffel<br />
written request but had agreed verbally. In an endeavour to<br />
formalise matters the Ambassador planned to hand a note to the<br />
Vietnamese Secretary of State, Bui Diem, confirming the Australian<br />
offer, the Vietnamese acceptance of it and their expression of a<br />
request for the despatch of the force. Also on 29 April, Bui Diem<br />
agreed to send a letter acknowledging the Ambassador's letter and<br />
confirming the Vietnamese Government's request. Later the same day<br />
Quat's letter, which the Australian Government accepted as a r~ quest,<br />
was despatched. This letter stated that the Ambassador's letter<br />
confirming Australia's offer had been received, that the Republic of<br />
Vietnam confirmed its acceptance of that offer and requested the<br />
despatch of the battalion on the basis discussed. Also on 29 April<br />
the Australian Government announced that, being in receipt of a </p>
<p>19<br />
request from the Government of South Vietnam and after close<br />
consultation with the United States, it had been decided to provide<br />
an infantry battalion for service in South Vietnam. The terms of<br />
this announcement had been communicated to Washington before receipt<br />
of the letter from Dr Quat of 29 April. ' The Vietnamese Government's<br />
off icial communique issued on the subject and dated 29 April began<br />
" Upon the request of the Government of the Republic of Vietnam the<br />
Government of Australia today approved the despatch to Vietnam of an<br />
infantry battalion Despite this communique, it would then appear that, the<br />
offer of the battalion having been made by Australia first to the<br />
United States, the two Governments together ( with the United States<br />
predominating) subsequently arranged for the formal request from<br />
South Vietnam. In terms of Article IV paragraph 3 of the SEATO Treaty,<br />
however, the further question as to -whether Australian military aid<br />
was acceptable to South Vietnam and whether Australian combat<br />
forces were in that country with the consent of its Government needs<br />
to be examined. Prior to April 19,65 there had been other requests from the<br />
Government of South Vietnam and frequent expressions of appreciation<br />
of aid supplied. The request made in general terms by President Diem<br />
in March 1962, the request for pilots made by Ambassador Tran Van Lam<br />
in May 1963, General Khanh's widc and general appeal in July 1964<br />
and the appeal by Prime Minister Huong in December 1964 have been<br />
placed in their context in the chronological survey of Australian-<br />
Vietnamese Relations 1961-64. There is no Evidcnce in Australian<br />
documents to show that the requests by President Diem, by Ambassador<br />
Tran Van Lam and General Khanh were prompted by external pressure,<br />
although it is notable that the Ambassador's request for pilots was<br />
received while Australia. was considering a similar request from the<br />
United States. However, in the ca-se of the strong direct request<br />
from Prime Minister Huong, and of the request from Dr Quat, there is<br />
evidence of such pressure. ' The conclusion suggests itself that<br />
although the South ViEtnamese authorities were initially reluctant<br />
to request external military forces as distinct from general<br />
support of a military nature and continued to display this reluctance<br />
in varying degrees, they were brought to accept the necessity of<br />
such forces by persuasion and by the weakness of their own position,<br />
and they did on various occasions indicate that the forces were<br />
appreciated and welcome. Consequently, the Australian military<br />
presence in South Vietnam can clearly be said tu have received their<br />
consent. </p>
<p>20<br />
The Relevance of SEATO<br />
The documents show quite clearly that Australian troops<br />
were not sent to South Vietnam as part of or in response to<br />
SEATO Council Planning, nor were they sent in response to an<br />
appeal to SEATO as a collective organisation from South Vietnam<br />
as a Protocol State of SEATO. In the following paragraphs the<br />
mass of evidence in the documents to support this conclusion is<br />
condensed to a brief summary.<br />
As early as 15 May 1962 the Australian Government decided<br />
publicly to justify non-combatant, and later combatant<br />
military aid to Vietnam as being in accord with or in the context<br />
of SEATO. This decision taken by Ministers seems to have been<br />
taken without any departmental advice. It was not until August<br />
1964 that any serious analysis by officials of the relevance of<br />
SEATO appears on the files. This analysis began by admitting<br />
frankly that Australian assistance was in fact given in response<br />
to the wishes of the United States that Australia should provide<br />
some military assistance to Vietnam in the form of a services<br />
" fpresence". The analysis then went on to argue that it was unwise<br />
to endeavour to justify Australian aid as being covered by<br />
a public treaty such as SEATO or in terms of Article IV of paragraph<br />
1 of the SEATO Agreement. This was because the Government of<br />
South Vietnam had not formally invoked SEATO, because of the<br />
non-combatant role of our forces, as well as the very small response<br />
they represented. It was pointed out that Article II<br />
would be a more appropriate justification as it provided for<br />
self help and mutual aid to counter and prevent subversive<br />
activities directed from outside a given state. However, under<br />
the terms of the Protocol, Article II did not apply to Protocol<br />
States. However, it was suggested that paragraph 2 of Article IV<br />
would provide a " useful umbrella" to justify Australian action.<br />
This Article provided that " If in the opinion of any of the<br />
parties the inviolability or the integrity of the territory or<br />
the sovereignty or the political independence of any party in<br />
the Treaty area or of any other state or territory to which the<br />
provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article from time to time apply<br />
is threatened in any way other than by armed attack, or is<br />
affected or threatened by any fact or situation which might endanger<br />
the peace of the area, the parties shall consult<br />
immediately in order to agree on the measures which should be<br />
taken for the common defence".<br />
Because the South Vietnam Government never invoked<br />
SEATO as a Treaty Organisation and because of the difficulties<br />
of interpretation involved in any attempt under these circumstances<br />
to use the Treaty provisions as a justification for<br />
Australian action, the Government preferred not to specify any<br />
particular provision of the Treaty, but to argue in general<br />
terms that Australian action was in accordance with Australia's </p>
<p>21<br />
obligations under the Treaty. More specifically while using<br />
the-Treaty as a " useful umbrella", justification was based upon<br />
three arguments. The first was that South Vietnam was in the<br />
Treaty area and was for the purposes of Articles IV and III<br />
designated a Protocol State. The second argument accepted past<br />
interpretations made of the Treaty by the United States and<br />
argued that the Treaty obligation was individual as well as<br />
collective and that therefore obligations could be fulfilled<br />
by bilateral agreements as well as by collective action. Thirdly,<br />
it was argued that a collective SEATO policy had been in existence<br />
and maintained over a period of time. In support of this,<br />
reference was made to three Resolutions of the SEATO Council:<br />
that of 29 March 1961 which noted with concern the efforts of<br />
an armed minority with external aid acting in violation of the<br />
Geneva Accord to destroy the Government of Vietnam, and declared<br />
its firm resolve not to acquiesce in any such take-over; that<br />
of 1963 in which the Council expressed the hope that Vietnam<br />
with external support could maintain its advance towards<br />
economic stability and international security; and that of<br />
1964 when the Council gave special attention to the deteriorating<br />
situati on in Vietnam, the official communique stating ( with<br />
France abstaining) that the Council agreed that member states<br />
should remain prepared if necessary to take concrete steps<br />
within their respective capabilities in fulfilment of their obligations<br />
under the Treaty.<br />
Immediately before the Honolulu staff talks Departments<br />
gave some consideration to '' the credibility of maintaining the<br />
view that what we had i~ n South Vietnam flows from our SEATO obligations".<br />
As a result it was clearly realised that the arguments<br />
represented above were exceedingly weak in view of the conspicuous<br />
absence of any collective SEATO activity. Moreover it is notable<br />
that, when the Australian Government came to explain to the United<br />
Kingdom the crucial military staff talks which took place in<br />
Honolulu in March 1965 between Australia and the United States<br />
concerning the provision of military aid to Vietnam, Australia<br />
represented to the United Kingdom that these were informal talks<br />
arising out of ANZUS affairs. No suggestion was made that these<br />
crucial talks as a result of which Australian combat troops were<br />
committed to Vietnam, were in any way part of a SEATO operation.<br />
Again, the status of Australian forces in Vietnam was<br />
not governed by any authority deriving from SEATO but was based<br />
upon an exchange of letters with the President of Vietnam giving<br />
Australian troops in that country diplomatic status on the model<br />
of the Pentilateral Agreement on Mutual Defence Assistance in<br />
Indo-China concluded in 1950 between the United States, Vietnam<br />
and other Governments. No matter what the theoretical arguments which could<br />
be raised concerning the relevance of SEATO to Australian </p>
<p>22<br />
action, in practical terms the facts are clear.<br />
Although the Government of South Vietnam at different<br />
times appealed to the Heads of Government of over thirty<br />
countries, it did not at any time appeal to SEATO as a collective<br />
treaty organisation. Because there was no request of this type,<br />
the SEATO plans devised by SEATO military advisers specifically<br />
to assist a Protocol State and to counter communist insurgency<br />
in South Vietnam were not used, nor could the Treaty Organisation<br />
operate. There is certainly nothing in the documents to suggest<br />
that the sending of Australian troops was the subject of a SEATO<br />
Council decision. Not only did South Vietnam not appeal to SEATO but the<br />
United States Government was for a variety of reasons specifically<br />
opposed to the use of SEATO as the machinery by which increased<br />
military aid could be introduced into South Vietnam. As a result,<br />
several Australian suggestions to the United States that any<br />
Australian aid should be related to SEATO received no support.<br />
In its early thinking before the commitment of United<br />
States combat forces, the United States occasionally suggested<br />
that the situation in South Vietnam might require SEATO operations<br />
and very occasionally hinted that SEATO provided a justification<br />
for its presence. But the real justification was<br />
always based upon the fact of a bilateral agreement and not<br />
upon the SEATO argument. Moreover, the fact is plain that<br />
American military plans for aid to Vietnam were not of direct<br />
relevance to SEATO and i~ n fact on occasion were in conflict with<br />
SEATO military planning. This was known and understood by<br />
Australian military planning authorities, and was specifically<br />
mentioned in the Honolulu talks. Because of these facts<br />
neither the United States nor Australia, when reporting its<br />
action in Vietnam to the Security Council, did so in terms of<br />
SEATO. In the light of the above evidence and no matter what<br />
the theoretical possibilities of arguing as to whether or not<br />
Australian action could possibly be justified in terms of the<br />
SEATO Treaty, the fact is apparent that Australian troops were<br />
not sent to Vietnam as part of a SEATO operation or as a result<br />
of consultations among the SEATO powers as a treaty organisation. </p>

AUSTRALIA VIETNAM 1965-67<br />
The four decisions made by Australian Governments to increase<br />
troop levels in Vietnam ( announced on 18 August 1965, 8 March 1966,<br />
December 1966 and 17 October 1967 respectively) were all essentially<br />
a logical extension of the 1965 decision to send combat forces to<br />
Vietnam, and a measure of the importance placed on the American<br />
alliance. General support for United States policies in Vietnam did<br />
not necessarily mean unqualified approval of policies of escalation,<br />
nor was it conceded that Australia should increase her forces in<br />
Vietnam progressively as the United States increased its own troop<br />
levels there. Successive Governments retained control of the Liming,<br />
extent and nature of Australia's added commitments in Vietnam, and<br />
each decision was taken. in accordance with assessments of changes in<br />
the political and strategic circumstances of the region and with due<br />
regard for the Government's total defence program and its domestic<br />
commitments. But the option of refusing to increase troop levels was<br />
never considered. The dominant influence throughout the period was pressure<br />
from Americans at political, diplomatic and service levels for<br />
Australia to increase her commitment in Vietna. Australia's contribution<br />
was, of course, too small to be very significant militarily:<br />
the chief United States motive was the need to prove that her Vietnam<br />
policies had the support of other countries, and the more U~ nited States<br />
policies were called into question, the more she required her allies<br />
publicly to proclaim support. AL the end of the period under review<br />
here the pressure which she exerted was described as " extremely strong".<br />
In contrast to the Americans, the Vietnamese only intermittently<br />
exerted pressure on Australia to increase her military aid to<br />
their country. However, before Australia's biggest troop increases<br />
( the commitment of the second and third battalions) discussions took<br />
place between the Australian and Vietnamese Governments. These discussions<br />
did not, according to official spokesmen, result in specific<br />
Vietnamese requests for more troops. Despite Australia's concern that<br />
her increased assistance be justified in terms of Vietnamese requests,<br />
in three of the four cases of increased Australian assistance it was<br />
considered unnecessary to ask the South Vietnamese Government for a<br />
formal request for aid. The Sout~ h Vietnamese Government was merely<br />
informed of the decision either shortly before or after the announcement<br />
by the Australian Government. Twice the Vietnamese Government and the<br />
Australian public were informed that the increase was in pursuance of<br />
earlier requests and once that it was as a result of continuing consultations<br />
between the two Governments.<br />
The First Increase The first increase in the numbers of Australian combat troops<br />
in Vietnam was prompted by a request from President L. B. Johnson to the </p>

authorise the Army to plan and prepare on the<br />
assumption that a second battalion might be<br />
committed in March 1966;<br />
restrict on a need-to-know basis knowledge<br />
of the planned build-up and its objective;<br />
inform the Americans that we were unable to<br />
contribute more than the forces indicated in<br />
and explain why.<br />
Departmental advice to the Minister for External Affairs,<br />
tendered on 16 August 1965, stressed the impossibility of forecasting<br />
future events in the Malaysia-Singapore-Indonesia area, and urged<br />
again that for this reason no formal indication should be given to the<br />
United States " that we are planning to make a second battalion available<br />
for service in Vietnam in 1966", though she should be told of<br />
the planned increase in the National Service intake, and that<br />
Australia's capacity would be reviewed in 1966. The Department also<br />
thought that Australia should avoid any commitment to " progression"<br />
i. e. that as the Americans increased their forces so Australia should<br />
do more. When Ministers considered the question they endorsed<br />
recommendation&amp; and but directed that no planninz or preparation<br />
whatever should be made on the assumption that an additional<br />
battalion or any other additional forces would be committed to Vietnamr.<br />
The Australian Embas~ sies i~ n Washington and Saigon, and the<br />
High Commissions in London and Wellington were informed of the Government's<br />
decision on 17 August, and asked to inform the Governmentsto<br />
which they were accredited. The Washington Embassy was told that " we<br />
would like you to present it in a way that will make the greatest<br />
favourable impact on the Americans"<br />
There i~ s no evidence in official documents that the South<br />
Vietnamese Government had made any request for further Australian<br />
military aid at this time. Nor is there any firm evidence to suggest<br />
that the Vietnamese were consulted on the question before 18 August,<br />
the day the Australian Government announced its decision. The view was<br />
expres * sed in Australia that it would be necessary to confirm with the<br />
Government of South Vietnam that the further contribution of forces<br />
remains acceptable, but the message actually sent to the Australian<br />
Embassy in Saigon was simply to " inform" the South Vietnamese Government<br />
of the decision, " in context of a step in pursuance of their earlier<br />
request". There were delays in decyphering in Saigon, but the message<br />
was conveyed to the Acting Prime Minister of the Republic of Vietnam on<br />
18 August, some hours before the official announcement, in Canberra<br />
( which took place at 8 p. m. in the House of Representatives). The<br />
Chairman of the National Leadership Committee, Major General Nguyen Van<br />
Thieu, expressed pleasure that the Australian force was being built up. </p>
<p>26<br />
He asked what the possibilities were if, at some time in the future,<br />
the Vietnamese Government were to make a request for additional forces.<br />
The following day the Vietnamese Ambassador to Australia called on the<br />
Secretary of the Department of External Affairs to convey his Government's<br />
" thanks and appreciation" for the increased Australian military<br />
aid. The Second Increase<br />
The background to the second decision to increase Australian<br />
troop levels in Vietnam ( announced on 8 March 1966) was very different<br />
from that to the first in so far as no formal request was received<br />
from the United States or, until the last minute, from South Vietnam.<br />
In fact, Australian Ministers and officials went to considerable<br />
trouble to ensure that no such request should be made until the Australian<br />
Government was ready to give serious consideration to the matter.<br />
There was nonetheless very intensive lobbying arnd hinting by the United<br />
States for over four months before the announcement. In Washington,<br />
Saigon and Canberra, United States diplomatic and service officials<br />
made it abundantly clear that the United States hoped that Australia<br />
would increase her Vietnam force, while Australian Ministers, whenever<br />
questioned publicly, stated that no formal request for increased aid<br />
had been received. Towards the end of 1965, United States officials took a<br />
gloomy view of the Vietnam situation. In Saigon, United States Defence<br />
Secretary McNamara in an informal talk with the Australian Ambassador*<br />
said that the United States had been surprised by the strength and<br />
violence of the enemy reaction to the American introduction of ground<br />
forces. The choice for the United States as he saw it was between<br />
putting in still more rcops Vietnamese, American and others or<br />
accepting eventual defeat, and the United States would not accept<br />
defeat. McNamara thought that there would be a long and costly military<br />
effort and that neither the military situation nor the preparations<br />
made by the Vietnamese were far enough forward for pacification to be<br />
undertaken on any significant scale. He agreed that negotiations would<br />
carry many dangers as things stood at present. In asking for the<br />
Ambassador' s assessment of the situation McNamara also asked him,<br />
whether action against North Vietnam should be intensified and whether<br />
Australia could send a second infantry battalion to Vietnam. The<br />
Ambassador said the second question was for the Australian Government<br />
to decide, but he was certain that any request would receive prompt and<br />
serious consideration. During December 1965, there were reports of discussions on<br />
many occasions: the Minister for External Affairs during his visit to<br />
Saigon in December 1965 said that both the Americans and the South<br />
Vietnamese raised the question of additional assistance; the Ambassador<br />
* United States Ambassador Lodge, Generals Wheeler, Sharpe and<br />
Westmoreland were also present. </p>
<p>27<br />
in Washington reported talks with Bundy and with Harriman ( who passed<br />
on President Johnson's thoughts as " background for our decision");<br />
and the United States Ambassador in Canberra spoke to the Prime<br />
Minister. There were also talks in Canberra between United States<br />
Embassy and Departmental officials, and in Washington between the Head<br />
of the Australian Joint Services Staff and Pentagon officials.<br />
The Australian Government was in no doubt, therefore, about<br />
the desire of the United States Government to see an increased Australian<br />
contribution. Ministers, however, saw no need to rush into a<br />
decision: if an extra battalion were committed it could not be done<br />
before March or April 1966; the defence group did not favour further<br />
piecemeal contributions; and a decision should await the outcome of<br />
ministerial discussions with the United Kingdom in the latter part of<br />
January 1966. In the New Year defence planners began a detailed examination<br />
of what increases could be made to the forces in Vietnam, and finalised<br />
their report on 10 February, after the completion of the British<br />
defence review, and after the Prime Minister had defended the United<br />
States' resumption of bombing North Vietnam. The planners outlined<br />
possibilities rather than making recommendations but, as the Departmental<br />
representative explained to the Minister for External Affairs,<br />
the balance of opinion was that Australia should contribute enough<br />
land forces to make up a task force.<br />
Consideration by Ministers was further deferred pending the<br />
visit of United States Vice-President Humphrey, although at a press<br />
conference with Humphrey the Prime Minister wa. quoted as saying that<br />
Australia had been considering for some time what more could usefully<br />
be done in Vietnam. He denied American pressure on Australia and said<br />
that the United States had made no request.<br />
Thus it was not until 3 March 1966 that Ministers finally<br />
decided to replace the force of scme 1,400 men with a -ubstantially<br />
enlarged contribution of forces in the form of a self-contained<br />
Australian task force of s: ome 4,500 personnel under Australian command.<br />
When he told President Johnson of the decision the Prime Minister<br />
commented that his military advisers considered that the provision<br />
of a force of this size represented the upper limit of Army capacity,<br />
having regard to existing military commitments in Malaysia. Furthermore,<br />
while they advised that. the force could be sustained, they had<br />
made it clear that short of a major emergency it would not be practicable<br />
to enlarge it. The Government had believed that the task force<br />
would be the most militarily effective contribution Australia could<br />
make to the allied effort in South Vietnam and it judged that it should<br />
go so far at that time, in consequence of the high importance of the<br />
issues at stake in South Vietnam and to make a clear demonstration of<br />
Australian support for the massive efforts of the United States.<br />
During the months preceding this decision, the Australian<br />
Government was no more anxious to receive a formal request for more<br />
military assistance from South Vietnam than it was to receive one from </p>
<p>S28<br />
the United States. In an interview with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister<br />
in December 1965, the Minister for External Affairs made it clear that<br />
" the position was that when we were ready to receive a request we would<br />
let him know and he would make one". The Vietnamese subsequently<br />
restricted their efforts to making the Australians " informally aware"<br />
that Vietnam would welcome increased aid. In December 1965 Air Vice<br />
Marshal Nguyen Cao Ky, " made what was almost a request" to the Australian<br />
Minister for External Affairs for army and air force assistance,<br />
and Ky repeated this request to an ABC interviewer. Foreign Minister<br />
Tran Van Do, while agreeing not to make a formal request, added that<br />
the Vietnamese Government would, of course, welcome any reinforcement<br />
of the Australian force in Vietnam even if the. se reinforcements were<br />
relatively small.<br />
In the following months there seems to have been no further<br />
communication between the Australian and Vietnamese Governments on this<br />
question, until on 19 February the Australian Prime Minister was quoted<br />
as saying: " we hope to announce soon what Australia can do to supplement<br />
our present forces in Vietnam'. The Australian Ambassador to the<br />
Republic of Vietnam quickly suggested that any such announcement should<br />
be preceded by " adequate prior consultation with the Vietnamese", in<br />
order that it would appear that the Australian decision was taken in<br />
response to a Viettnamese rather than an American request. He al. o<br />
suggested, as had a member of the Department of External Affairs, that<br />
a formal request for aid hould bf: sought from the Vietnamese Gcvernment.<br />
Air Vice Marshal. Ky showed i. nmediate interest in the Princ:<br />
Minister's reported statement, and the Australian Ambassador assured him<br />
" that no decision had yet been taken but that we would omrr. unicate with<br />
the Vietnamese Govzrnment as coon as possible after any such deciiocn<br />
was reached". The Ambassador also informed the Australian Government<br />
that Ky was repcrted to have :-aid previously that existing arrangemrE. nts<br />
would not cover any further military forces that Australia might wish<br />
to send to Vietnam: " there would have t-o be a specific request from<br />
the Government of Vietnam".<br />
On 4 March the Australian Government notified its Ambassador<br />
in Saigon that it had decided upon the ocommitment of the second battalion,<br />
and instructed him to advise Ky of this fact and work out with<br />
him the terms of a letter of request. The letter was to indicate that<br />
it constituted the final formal step following a. series of consultat. icn.-<br />
and should be available for publication. It should be a re( qu st in<br />
general terms only.<br />
The letter was duly obtained from Ky and its contents cabled<br />
to Australia on 7 March 1966, It concluded: " The Governmcnt of the<br />
Republic of Vietnam wishes to request the Australian Government for any<br />
increased military contribution which it might be able tc make in the<br />
present situation". The following day the Victnam-. ne and Australian<br />
Governments announced the decision -inultaneously at 8.45 p. m. ( AEST).<br />
The Australian Ambassador in Saigon reported that Major<br />
General Nguyen Van Thieu and Air Vice Marshal Ky expressed appreciation </p>
<p>29<br />
of the Australian Government's decision to replace the battalion with<br />
a Task Force and of the continued moral support which this implied.<br />
The Third Increase Towards the end of 1966 United States administrative,<br />
diplomatic and Service officials again indicated that, as United<br />
States presidential adviser William Bundy put it, a possible extra<br />
Australian contribution was " a subject on our minds". But perhaps<br />
because of recognition of Australia's determination to avoid receiving<br />
a formal request during the previous year and appreciation of the<br />
internal difficulties an election posed for the Australian Government,<br />
there seemsto have been greatly reduced pressure from the United States.<br />
The impetus for the third increase in Australia's contribution<br />
came clearly from the Prime Min-ster after he increased his majority<br />
in the November 1966 election, and the speed at which he desired to<br />
move surprised officials and the Minister for External Affairs.<br />
Immediately after the election he told the Secretary of his<br />
Department that he wanted very early Cabinet consideration of sending<br />
an extra battalion to Vietnam, and that he did not want to wait to<br />
consider the question in the light of a review of needs and capabilities<br />
early in the New Year, He asked for a study of all possibilities including<br />
particularly sending an additional battalion from Australia;<br />
and re-deploying the bat. talion at present in Malaysia.<br />
The Minister for External Affairs then asked the Australian<br />
Ambassador in Washington for a personal report of any indications of<br />
further thinking in the United States. The Ambassador replied that<br />
the Embassy had continued to receive hints from contacts in the<br />
White House, the State Department and the Pentagon that an additional<br />
military contribution from Australia would be greatly appreciated by<br />
the Administration and that American hopes of further support from<br />
the United States' allies stemmed as much, and perhaps more, from international<br />
and internal political considerations as from military<br />
necessity. The Ambassador referred to Johnson's need to seek Congressional<br />
approval for a large ircrease his budget the following<br />
January and to the conflicting pressures on one side from the<br />
liberals to " accept negotiations and dangerous concessions to the<br />
Communists" and on the other from those who wanted to escalate the<br />
war with a view to getting it over quickly. The Ambassador believed<br />
that Australia's ability to influence the President's response to<br />
these conflicting pressures would be related to the scale of her<br />
military contribution and the readiness with which it was made. He<br />
suggested that if the fact of an additional contribution would be<br />
at least as important as the nature of such a contribution, this might<br />
provide more flexibility in the Government's consideration of the<br />
' problem. When Service and Departmental advisers presented their<br />
report on 13 December they opened it. with a survey of the state of the<br />
war. They thought that the military situation in Vietnam had improved<br />
over the previous twelve months, but that given the allied forces t. hen </p>
<p>30<br />
available, defeat of the military aggression from North Vietnam and of<br />
the Viet Cong was unlikely to be achieved for some considerable time.<br />
Concurrently they saw a need for progress to be made in pacification<br />
and civil reconstruction, but this could only be achieved at the expense<br />
of the availability of forces for military operations. Thus the rate of<br />
progress in defeating aggression from North Vietnam and of pacification<br />
was directly related to the size of allied forces available, The report<br />
canvassed several options open to the Government in regard to all three<br />
Services and thought that while the most effective addition to the<br />
Army Task Force would be a third infantry battalion, early deployment<br />
would pose considerable problems. ( Because of these the Army had<br />
recommended against the provision of a third battalion before August<br />
1967.) There were, however, increases ( totalling approximately q00<br />
troops) which were needed to overcome known deficiencies in the existing<br />
forces, some of them specifically recommanded by the Commander of<br />
the Task Force. Anxiety was expressed about making changes in the<br />
Australian contribution to the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve given<br />
the situation in the Malaysia-Indonesia region, and it was agreed that<br />
any such variations should be discussed with the United Kingdom before<br />
any decision was made. As a general observation, the advisers stated<br />
that it was fundamental to Australian defence policy that we should<br />
make a contribution to the security of South East Asia which was<br />
consistent with our national resources and with our vital interests in<br />
the securing of area against communist encroachment. On these<br />
broad strategic, grounds they had previously r-c. ommerded ard the Government<br />
had approvecd a_ substanti. al Australiar forc. e contribution in the<br />
present conflict in Victnam. There were elements in the present situation<br />
including the state of the war, the continuing build-up of<br />
United St. ates forces and the apparent expe( ctat. i. on in the United States<br />
Administration that Australia and other allies would increase their<br />
commitments, which suggested that a further increase in the Australian<br />
contribution would be appropriate. The nat. ure and timing of any increase<br />
were mattc. rs for d. termination by the Government.<br />
The Coverr. TFnt accept. ed their advice against di. patching a<br />
third battalion and irter. fering with arrangements regardlrg the<br />
battalion then in Malaysia, t. decid: d to increase the total number<br />
of personnel serving with the Australian Forces in Vietnam by more<br />
than one-third to a total of 6,300, with increased numbers coming<br />
from all three Services. The Army component was to be raised from<br />
4,370 to 5,200. The Australian Ambassador in Washington was told of<br />
the decision on 16 December, and asked to check points of detail and<br />
acceptabil. ity with the United States Administration so that the<br />
Australian Government could make the earliest possible announcement.<br />
He reported back to Canberra on the same day that United States Defence<br />
Secretary McNamara had expressed particular gratification that<br />
Australia was increasing the level of her ground forces. United<br />
States approval of details was reported on 19 December.<br />
There is no documentary evidence that. the Government of the<br />
Republic of Vietnam was consult. ed about or given prior notification of<br />
this third increase in Australia's forces in Vietnam. The Department<br />
of External Affairs advised in a memorandum of 19 December 1966 that it<br />
did not seem necessary or desirable to seek a specific request from the </p>
<p>31<br />
South Vietnamese on this occasion. The memorandum added, however, that<br />
there had been a continuing emphasis on consultations with South Vietnam<br />
and with the other allies ( illustrated, for example, by the Prime<br />
Minister's visit to Saigon in April and Washington in June-July and the<br />
recent Manila Conference*). In any event, the broad terms of Ky's<br />
letter of 7 March, together with the continuing consultations at<br />
various levels seemed to provide a satisfactory basis for maintaining<br />
that the additional forces were provided at South Vietnam's request.<br />
It was suggested that, after the proposed aid increase had been made<br />
public, a South Vietnamese announcement of the increase could be useful<br />
if it emphasised the continuing consultations between our two Governments<br />
and with the other allies and drew attention to the increasing<br />
North Vietnamese aggression.<br />
It was in fact some hours after the Australian Prime Minister<br />
had announced the increased assistance in general terms on 20 December<br />
that the Australian Ambassador in Saigon was instructed to inform Air<br />
Vice Marshal Ky of the decision. The information was conveyed through<br />
Foreign Minister Do, who agreed to say that a letter of request was not<br />
necessary because the two Governments had been in continuous consultation<br />
for some time, that Australia was fully aware of Vietnam's<br />
requirements, and that in making further forces available Australia<br />
was acting in the spirit of the Manila Conference.<br />
The Fourth Increase<br />
Expression of American interest in increased Australian aid to<br />
Vietnam during the first half of 1967 followed much the same pattern as<br />
the previous year: the United States made no formal request to Australia<br />
for an additional commitment in Vietnam, but United States military<br />
sources in Saigon and Washington made American wishes quite clear to<br />
Australian officials.<br />
From Washington on 18 April 1967 the Australian Minister for<br />
External Affairs reported a meeting with United States Defence Secretary<br />
McNamara on the progress of the wa-. McNamara had no doubt that America<br />
could no longer lose the war, but they still had the problem of winning<br />
and that could be long and hard and there was no easy way which could<br />
point directly to victorv. After considerable discussion of United<br />
States operation? and the slow progress of negotiations, McNamara asked<br />
The Manila Summit Conference, attended by the political leaders and<br />
foreign ministers; of Australia, The Republic of Korea, New Zealand,<br />
the Philippine.;, Thailand, the United States and the Republic of<br />
Vietnam, was held in the Philippines on October 24-25 1966, " to<br />
consider the conflict in South Vietnam and to review their wider<br />
purposes in Asia and the Pacific". In the Joint Communique released<br />
after the Conference, the participating nations declared their purpose<br />
to be peace in South Vietnam and throughout the Asian and<br />
Pacific area. However they were also determined " that the South<br />
Vietnamese people shall not be conquered by aggressive force and<br />
shall enjoy the inherent right to choose their own way of life and<br />
their own form of government. We shall continue our military and all<br />
other efforts as firrnl. y and as long as ~ wy be necessary in close<br />
consultation among ourselves until the aggression is ended." </p>
<p>32<br />
the Minister's views about the present level of forces and said that<br />
more troops could do more tasks but they brought with them political,<br />
economic and psychological problems. McNamara then illustrated the<br />
value of more troops by pointing to the specific task in Phuoc Tuy<br />
province being carried out by the Australians with two battalions and<br />
commenting that clearly we could do the same task more quickly with<br />
three. If the Defence Secretary also elaborated on the problems, the<br />
Minister did not report it, nor did he report any comment of his own<br />
on the specific issue of the troop increase.<br />
But if United States probings of Australian intentions were<br />
not particularly insistent during the first half of the year, the<br />
rising level of public controversy in America over policies of escalation<br />
in Vietnam soon made the United States Administration more anxious<br />
to demonstrate that United States policies had the moral and practical<br />
support of her allies. Thus, President L. B. Johnson on 13 July brought<br />
the whole question of increases in troop levels into the public arena<br />
when, together with Defence Secretary McNamara and Generals Wheeler and<br />
Westmoreland, he indicated in a press statement that the United States<br />
would discuss increased contributions with her allies. A week later<br />
the White House announced the visit of presidential advisers Maxwell D.<br />
Taylor and Clark M. Clifford to Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Meanwhile<br />
on 15 July President Johnson wrote to the Prime Miaister pointing<br />
to the need for additional effort, but net making a specific request.<br />
The political situation in the United States was analy. j d by<br />
the Australian Charge in Washington on 25 July. He reported a fluid<br />
situation comprising many conflicting trends in opinion, increasing<br />
public scepticism about the war, and although he did not think the<br />
basic American ccmmitment tc Vietnam was being called into question he<br />
feared tha. t if, following the United Kingdom's announced intentions to<br />
withdraw from South East Asia, America's allies gave a negative response<br />
to proposals for more troops it would have a disproportionately adverse<br />
effect on United States opinion. Under these circumstances Australiacs<br />
response, as the most significant Western ally, was of particular<br />
importance. The Clifford-Taylor talks held at the very end of July were<br />
broad-ranging rather than narrowly fc. cussed cn the question of troop<br />
levels. A number of papers, including a summary of main talking point?,<br />
were prepared in the Departments of External Affairs and Defence for<br />
the use of Ministers. These cover political prospects in South Vietnam,<br />
the pacification program, prospects for ncgotiations, communist use of<br />
Laos and Cambodia, United States plans in regard to bombing as wll as<br />
the issue of troops. Amongst other things the summary noted that the<br />
relatively optimistic picture of the military situation giv n by the<br />
President in his message to the Prime Minister contrasted with our own<br />
military assessment; and with some private United States assessments.<br />
It noted also that the Revolutionary Development program had been making<br />
very slow progress and the South Vietnamese Army was not yet giving it<br />
adequate support. On the question of troops, military advisers expressed<br />
the view that in considering any future contributions of forces to<br />
South Vietnam a tank squadron and additional helicopter support should </p>
<p>S33<br />
be given first priority. ( A request for the tank squadron had been<br />
received from the Australian Commander in Vietnam and defence advisers<br />
supported the request.) They suspected that a contribution on these<br />
lines would probably fall short of what the United States would have<br />
liked from us, i. e. more ground forces, but sgugested that Taylor and<br />
Clifford might not be fully aware of the important implications of the<br />
British White Paper for future Australian defence arrangements.<br />
At the talks themselves the Australian attitude was not to<br />
deny the substance of the United States view that there was a need for<br />
publicly declared allied solidarity and greater effort, but to bring<br />
into the equation the very considerable stretch already in Australia's<br />
military and economic effort, not only in Vietnam but elsewhere, and<br />
the new pcssibility in the light of recent British decisions that wider<br />
responsibilities would fall on us. For Australia, " effort" was not to<br />
be measured simply in terms of the Vietnam commitment.<br />
The Clifford-Taylor talks thus provided a forum for a mutual<br />
exchange of views; they led to no immediate decision on the part of the<br />
Australian Government.<br />
Defence and departmental officials continued tc consider the<br />
details of possible further commitmints with no great enthusiasm, By<br />
18 August 1967 they had reached agreement that c-ommitment of a third<br />
battalion would pose many difficulties; instead they favoured making<br />
available the additions to the Task Force which had been requested by<br />
the Commander in Vietnam. There was, however, a division of opinion<br />
over whether a positive recommendation against providing a third<br />
battalion should be made. There could be an embarrassing situation, it<br />
was suggested, if the Government were subsequently asked if it had acted<br />
upon the views of its official advisers. Although this suggestion met<br />
with some opposition, the weight of opinion was that the requests for<br />
additional forces received from the Ccmmander of the Tack Force should<br />
be recommended on military grounds; cther possible contributions should<br />
be listed for Government consideration, and the dicadvantages of providing<br />
a. third battalion should be enumerated.<br />
Ministers on 6 September decided in principle to commit the<br />
third battalion to Vietnam, but did not set the date for the announcement.<br />
Thus when the Prime Minister spoke with the United State6<br />
Ambassador to Australia on 7 September, he told him only that he should<br />
let the President know that " we were not going to sleep", but that<br />
there were some important difficulties and complexities in the situation<br />
for the Government, such as the implications of British withdrawal planour<br />
budgetary situation, the local political scene in terms of the<br />
Senate election and the Capricornia by-election due shortly, and uncertainties<br />
still surrounding some aspects of the Vietnamese elections.<br />
There was nevertheless a will to assist.<br />
Just as the Prime Minister had given the impetus to an early<br />
decision on troop levels at the end of 1966, so now he would seem to<br />
have provided the initiative in determining that Australia should offer<br />
more than, by implication, its defence advisers had recommended. When </p>
<p>the Australian Treasurer was in Washington in early October ( and under<br />
instructions not to inform the President that Australia would provide a<br />
third battalion), he referred to the Prime Minister's leadership in<br />
making clear to Ministers " what the issues involved in Vietnam were<br />
and the critical importance of our association with the United States".<br />
In reporting thi:: meeting with the President, the Treasurer<br />
stated that the pressure put upon him to have our decision indicated<br />
quickly to Johnson was " extremely strong", and that the Australian<br />
Ambassador, who was also present, could not remember stronger pressure<br />
being brought to bear.<br />
In response, the Treasurer explained to the President<br />
Australia's various commitments. The following day ( 3 October 1967)<br />
he suggested to the Prime Minister that the President should be told<br />
personally and confidentially what Australia proposed to do, and on 6<br />
October the Prime Minister did so in a message sent. to the Australian<br />
Ambassador in Washington for transmission to the White House.<br />
He told the President of Australia's plans in regard to the<br />
Malaysia-Singapore region where, he said, what happened in the longer<br />
term would be determined in large part by the outcome of Vietnam and<br />
by the extent of co-operation by the countries in the region in maintaining<br />
their own security. He suggested that Aust. ralia'= continued<br />
military prese; nce would depend on reaching . ome understanding with the<br />
United States in the event of serious trouble developing in the<br />
Malaysia-Singapore region. He thought it desirable to discuss the<br />
United State:;' interest in the security and stLability of South East Asia<br />
generally, the bearing of this on the cecurity of the Malaysia-Singapore<br />
region and the part in this security which Australia and New Zaeland<br />
could play. In Vietnam, he said, Australias fcrce. would be incr: ased by<br />
some 1,700 men tc brine the rnmbers to over 8,000, and thi-, he: a: s ured<br />
the President, put Australia at the f-ll. stretch of present and planned<br />
military capacity. He added that to attempt to go beyond this would<br />
involve the Government in military, . conomic and political deci. ions<br />
which he and hi:; colleagues would regard as publicly unacceptable in the.<br />
existing climate of opinion apart from other considerations cf national<br />
policy. As in the case of the decision in March 1966 to commit the<br />
second battalion, there was consultation between the Australian and<br />
Vietnamese Governments before the third battalion was committed. During<br />
a visit to Saigon in late July 1967, the Minister for the Army discussed<br />
the Aistralian force in Vietnam with both Vietnamese and American officials.<br />
He declared, however, that neither the Vietnam. se nor the<br />
Americans had made a specific request for more Australian troops.<br />
There further, indirect evidence that some month, s later<br />
the Republic of Vietnam's Ambassador to Australia conveyed to the<br />
Secretary of the Department of External Affairs " an indication of a<br />
wish on their / the Vietnamese/ part to have whatever additional, support </p>
<p>35<br />
we can provide". There followed a suggestion on 10 October 1967 from a senior<br />
member of the Department of External Affairs. Although he no longer<br />
thought it necessary to seek a specific formal request from the Vietnamese<br />
Government for additional Australian forces he thought it important<br />
that the Vietnamese should be informed of our intention well in advance<br />
of the announcement on 17 October. On 14 October the Australian<br />
Ambassador in Saigon was asked to notify the Vietnamese Government of<br />
the decision, which was described as having been taken in the light of<br />
previous requests by the Vietnamese Government for such military assistance<br />
as the Australian Government was able to provide, a request which<br />
the Vietnamese Ambassador in Canberra had confirmed that month. The<br />
Australian Government saw this decision as being in fulfilment of the<br />
undertaking made by the Manila Conference Powers to continue military<br />
aid to South Vietnam as long as aggression continued there.<br />
The Ambassador informed the Vietnamese Foreign Minister of the<br />
decision to increase military aid on 16 October, and the latter<br />
" expressed appreciation". After the Australian announcement of the<br />
decision on 17 October, Directory Chairman Thieu publicly welcomed the<br />
troop increases and praised both the military and civil activities of<br />
Australian and New Zealand troops in Vietnam. </p>
