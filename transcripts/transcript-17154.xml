    <content><![CDATA[<p>Training for medical, nursing, dental and allied health students in Broken Hill will receive a major boost through a $1.9 million investment in student accommodation and education facilities.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government's investment will provide support for student accommodation units and a new wing to the University of Sydney Department of Rural Health at Broken Hill.</p>
<p>Currently, the Broken Hill University Department of Rural Health is operating at capacity for student accommodation.</p>
<p>It is further anticipated that their student load will increase by 40% in 2010 (from around 22 to 35 students on placement each week during the academic year).</p>
<p>By providing high quality training and accommodation facilities, the Rudd Government is helping communities attract more people to work in regional and rural Australia.</p>
<p>We know that doctors and health professionals who spend time training and learning in regional and rural centres often establish strong links with the local community.</p>
<p>These projects will help ensure that students undertaking rural training have access to top quality facilities and encourage them to consider future careers in rural health.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government is determined to attract more doctors, nurses and allied health professionals to regional and rural communities throughout Australia - and keep them there.</p>
<p>This will mean more Australians will get better access in the future to appropriate health care, regardless of their location.</p>
<p>This investment will build on the Government's:</p>
<p>- $632 million announcement to train more doctors - of which 50 per cent of new GP training places will be provided in the bush.</p>
<p>- $134 million Rural Health Workforce Strategy, that will deliver 500 communities and 2,400 doctors with more financial support to move and stay in rural and remote areas.</p>
