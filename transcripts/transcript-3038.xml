FIGHTING IN THE FMIDLE EAST<br />
8 The Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
Mr. Whitlam, referring to his statement of 7 October on the<br />
renewed outbreak of fighting in the Middle East, said today<br />
that the Australian Government was deeply concerned at the<br />
continu,, tion and extension of the conflict since that date.<br />
Il Mr. Whitlam said it was particularly regrettable<br />
that innocent civilians had become victims of the fighting.<br />
The conflict, he said, not only meant tragic loss of life<br />
for the countries directly involved, but also had farreaching<br />
implications for international peace and security.<br />
In this situation, the Australian Government<br />
continued to believe that a ceasefire should be put into<br />
effect at the earliest possible moment, so that a renewed<br />
international effort could be launched to resolve the<br />
long-standing problems which lay behind the repeated<br />
outbreaks of hostilities in the Middle East.<br />
Mr. Vhitlam stressed the key role which the<br />
United Nations had to play in bringing about a ceasefire and<br />
in subsequent moves to find a lasting settlement in the<br />
Middle East. The Security Council, as the United Nations<br />
organ charged with primary responsibility for the<br />
maintenance of international peace and security, should<br />
be the major centre of this activity.<br />
The Council had already . met but had so far<br />
been unable to find a basis of agreement to permit a<br />
call for an iL-Iediate ceasefire. / 2. </p>

The Council menibers were, however, maintaining<br />
continuous urgent consultations in an endeavour to reach<br />
agreement, and Mr. Whitlaua was pleased that the Australian<br />
Representative, Sir Laurence Tlclntyre, as President of' the<br />
Council for October, was playing a key role in these<br />
consultations. MYr. Whitlam said it was vital that these consultations<br />
should succeed and that the Council should be able to<br />
discharge its crucial responsibilities to restore peace to<br />
the Mliddle East. He urged all parties to the conflict and all<br />
members of the Security Council and of the United Nations,<br />
to give their wholehearted support to these efforts.<br />
M~ r. Whitlam said he fully endorsed the statement issued<br />
by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 11 October,<br />
in which the Secretary-General appealed to all countries<br />
involved in hostilities to turn the tragic conflict into a<br />
starting point for a new effort at a real settlement.<br />
Mr. Whitlan said that Australia itself would continue<br />
to follow its neutral and even-handed policy in the Middle<br />
East. Ref erring to some overseas reports about his reply in<br />
Parliament on 10 October to a question about Australian nationa@<br />
volunteering to fight in the Middle East conflict, he reiteratect<br />
that holders of Australian passports were free to travel to<br />
whichever countries they wished to visit0<br />
This policy, he said, did not in any way imply approval<br />
or encouragement of Australian citizens volunteering for<br />
military service in the forces of any foreign country. </p>
