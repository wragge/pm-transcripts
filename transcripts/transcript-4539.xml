COMMONWEALTH TO AID MT. LYELL<br />
The Commonwealth Government will meet almost all the cost of<br />
interim assistance to keep the Mt. Lyell copper mine going at<br />
Queenstown on the west coast of Tasmania.<br />
The decision was made today after the Tasmanian Premier,<br />
Mr. Neilson, told the Minister for Employment and Industrial<br />
Relations, Mr. Street, and the Minister for Business and Consumexr<br />
Affairs, Mr. Fife, that Tasmania was not prepared to continue to<br />
share equally with the Commonwealth in interim arrangements which 9<br />
were announced on August<br />
Prior to the meeting with the Tasmanian deputation, the Minister<br />
for Environment Housing and Community Development, Mr. Newman,<br />
and the Member for Braddon, Mr. Groom, met Mr. Street and Mr. Fife<br />
and stressed the importance of the Mt. Lyell mine to Tasmania. J<br />
At the Ministers' meeting the Premier said that if the Tasmanian<br />
State Government were asXed to continue with the dollar for dollar<br />
agreement, he would have no alternative but to tell the people<br />
that the mine would have to close.<br />
The issue of the Mt. Lyell mine has major social implications.<br />
Because of the Commonwealth Government's deep concern for the<br />
peoplecf Queenstown and for the people of the west coast who<br />
rely heavily on the mine, it has decided to make it possible<br />
for the mine to keep going. This will inject confidence into<br />
the area.<br />
In these circumstances, the Commonwealth has decided to meet the<br />
full cost of the advance to safeguard the cash position of<br />
Mt. Lyell, less the amount of payroll tax collected by the<br />
State Government.<br />
There are great benefits to Tasmania in enabling Mt. Lyell to<br />
keep going at Queenstown.<br />
The Commonwealth is disappointed that the Tasmanian Government<br />
is not prepared to share this responsibility equally with the<br />
Commonwea Ith. / Hiowever, </p>
<p>However, the Commonwealth Government is not prepared to<br />
allow the Mt. Lyeli copper mine to be closed at a time when<br />
the w'hole of the Australian copper industry is under<br />
examination by the Industries Assistance Coimission.<br />
Present Conumonwealth legislation provides for a 50-50<br />
sharing arrangement with the Tasmanian Government.<br />
In the present circumstances, the Con mfonwealth is prepared<br />
to advance ahead of time tax reimbursements to Tasmania to<br />
allow regular payments to be made to Mt. Lyell.<br />
Legislation will be introduced as soon as possible into the<br />
new Parliament to give effect to today's decision.<br />
The Tasmanian Government collects about $ 475,000 from<br />
Mt.' Lyell in a full year as payroll tax. It will nowbe asked to<br />
forego payroll tax for approximately eight months.<br />
The Commonwealth Government will meet the balance of the<br />
estimated $ 4.8 million in short-term assistance recommended<br />
last month by the I. A. C.<br />
The I. A. C. Report on the Australian Copper Industry is<br />
expected to be brought down in the first half of next year. </p>
