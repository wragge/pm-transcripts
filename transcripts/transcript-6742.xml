PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
LUNCH IN INALA<br />
SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
It is a great pleasure to be here today.<br />
The pleasure is not only because it gives me the<br />
opportunity to see at first hand the needs of this area.<br />
It is also because nationally we are at a crucial stage<br />
in the economic development of this great country.<br />
Particularly here in Queensland we should be reflecting<br />
on what is happening in the economy. At the national<br />
level we are moving into the third year of strong<br />
economic growth, rapidly approaching our three year goal<br />
of 500,000 new jobs, and have inflation down to half<br />
what it was when we came into office.<br />
Queensland's economic performance, by contrast, has been<br />
very poor. Measured by most of the key economic<br />
indicators, it is performing worse than any of the other<br />
States of Australia. Worse despite having a resource<br />
base at least as good as the other states, indeed better<br />
than many. Worse despite a growth rate which<br />
outstripped other states just a few years ago. Worse<br />
despite the policies of the Commonwealth Government<br />
which have been overwhelmingly successful elsewhere over<br />
the past two and a half years.<br />
Let's look at the evidence.<br />
The unemployment rate for Queensland is the highest in<br />
Australia at 9 per cent in seasonally unadjusted terms,<br />
compared to 7.9 per cent Australia-wide.<br />
Where in every other State the relative incidence of<br />
industrial disputation has been falling, in Queensland<br />
it has risen dramatically in the period since August<br />
last year. This is a compelling indictement of the </p>
<p>confrontationist industrial relations policies of the<br />
Queensland Government.<br />
Consumer demand and confidence, measured by<br />
registrations of new motor vehicles, is also well below<br />
the Australia-wide average. And dwelling approvals fell<br />
sharply in the three months to July this year compared<br />
to the same three months a year earlier and contrasts<br />
with a much smaller decline for Australia as a whole.<br />
All Queenslanders should be deeply concerned about such<br />
trends. Queenslanders deserve, indeed they have a right<br />
to demand, better of their State Governmnent and its<br />
policies. My Government's-aim is to see all Queenslander's<br />
benefitting as they should from the strong economic<br />
performance we are achieving nationally.<br />
My Government's vision is of an Australia growing<br />
stronger every year, growing stronger by using its rich<br />
human and material resources to the full: growing<br />
stronger in partnership with the world's most dynamic<br />
economic region; growing stronger by developing a fair<br />
and equitable society in which equality of opportunity<br />
for all Australians was a realisable goal.. Above all,<br />
the Australian Labor Government's vision of Australia<br />
and I'm sure it's a vision every person here tonight<br />
shares is of a dynamic, self-reliant nation, making a<br />
worthwhile contribution to a goal shared by all humanity<br />
the goal of a world free from the threat of nuclear<br />
war. At the last two elections I have put our vision of<br />
Australia to the people. That vision is a startling<br />
contrast to the actions of our liberal predecessors.*<br />
And it is even more dramatic to contrast our objectives<br />
of a united, growing nation with the policies of the new<br />
Opposition leadership. But today I want to emphasise<br />
how we have lived up to our vision, how we have honoured<br />
the promises we made to the Australian people.<br />
When we were elected in 1983 our inheritence from the<br />
Liberal Party was an Australia showing the effects of<br />
seven years of rule by confrontation and division.<br />
Their approach was to confront the trade union movement,<br />
to attack the arbitration system and the Conciliation<br />
and Arbitration Commission, and to the undermine and<br />
then abandon centralised wage fixation.<br />
The result of these policies was a wages explosion,<br />
followed by a new bout of inflation, and the worst<br />
recession for fifty years culminating in zero growth,<br />
record inflation, record unemployment and record<br />
industrial disputation. </p>
<p>My Government has rebuilt the Australian economy from<br />
these ruins. We have created the conditions for<br />
economic growth. We have put in place policies to<br />
provide sustained economic growth at the same time as<br />
reducing and containing inflation.<br />
These priorities recognised that sustained growth-is the<br />
only way to generate more jobs, reduce unemployment and<br />
alleviate associated poverty and distress.<br />
The distinguishing feature of my Government's strategy<br />
has been a consensus based approach to economic policy<br />
making. TJe Prices and Incomes Accord has been the<br />
centrepi~ cs of this approach. Its recent renewal for a<br />
further two years has been a matter of momentous<br />
importance. Our strategy recognises the vital role of the private<br />
sector in sustained and expanded economic recovery. We<br />
have set a framework within which the private sector can<br />
plan and work with confidence. Central to this was the<br />
Government's trilogy of commitments on fiscal policy.<br />
The May Statement represented the first instalment in<br />
meeting the trilogy; the Budget continued the strategy<br />
of economic restraint to make way for private sector<br />
expansion. The credentials of this Government as sound economic<br />
managers are without question. Shorn of all but the<br />
most basic statistics, we have achieved:<br />
Economic growth averaging 5 per cent per annum.<br />
This is more,' than twice the annual average rate of.<br />
growth of 2.3 per cent achieved by our<br />
predecessors. A reduction of inflation to less than half the<br />
level which was inherited from the previous<br />
government. The creation of more new jobs during the first two<br />
years of the Labor Govenrment than in the whole<br />
seven years of Liberal-National Party rule.<br />
Remember that in the year before we came to Government<br />
160,000 jobs disappeared and unemployment increased by<br />
over a quarter of a million. Under Labor, in just 28<br />
months, 430,000 jobs have been created.<br />
The Prices and Incomes Accord, which the opposition has<br />
pledged to abandon, can take credit for the fact that<br />
industrial disputation has fallen to levels last </p>
<p>realised in the late sixties. The agreement reached<br />
recently with the trade union movement on discounting<br />
wage increases for the impact of the dollar's<br />
devaluation on prices will enable us to contain the<br />
inflationary effects of the devaluation. This agreement<br />
could not have been achieved by the previous Government<br />
and their confrontationist policies.<br />
This Government is a Labor Government; a Government<br />
proud of the record of social reform of the Australian<br />
Labor Party, a Government committed to ensuring that<br />
Australia continues to develop as a fair, just and<br />
equitable society.<br />
The provision of security to the Australian family is<br />
basic to the goal of a fair and equitable society. Any<br />
Government has a responsibility to ensure that all<br />
Australians have the security afforded by an economy<br />
that can provide jobs now and in the future.<br />
A Labor Government has a particularly heavy<br />
responsibility to ensure that high standards of<br />
education, ' health care, housing and social welfare can<br />
be achieved and maintained. We have delivered on these<br />
fronts.<br />
My Government has:<br />
Substantially increased education funding and<br />
ensured that increased funds will be directed to<br />
the most needy schools.<br />
Provided a fair, equitable and stable health care<br />
system through Medicare, thus putting an end to the<br />
interminable changes in health policy which have<br />
mar'Ked the past decade.<br />
Attacked inequity, evasion and avoidance in the tax<br />
system, as well as reducing taxes for honest, and<br />
especially low income, taxpayers.<br />
Increased public housing funds by more than sixty<br />
per cent and assisted 140,000 first home buyers.<br />
Substantially increased welfare funding, with an<br />
emphasis on relative need.<br />
The Government has given a high priority to increasing<br />
levels of assistance to those in greatest need<br />
pensioners and beneficiaries renting privately, those<br />
with children and those unemployed beneficiaries who<br />
were so callously victimized by the previous Government.<br />
The fall in real disposable income of most pensioners<br />
and beneficiaries which occured under the Liberal-</p>
<p>National Party Government has been r-eversed.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen my Government cannot be accused of<br />
discriminating between the States in its programmes.<br />
Queensland's relatively poor performance finds its<br />
complete explanation in the failures and inadequacies of<br />
the Bjelke-Petersen Government.<br />
Under my Government, the Commonwealth has undertaken<br />
major civil works programmes in Queensland, including<br />
the constr~ ction of the Burdekin dam, and the Brisbane<br />
and Townsville Airports.<br />
In fact,, Wt ot a total allocation of $ 443M for the<br />
1985-86 fi-nancial year for civil and defence capital<br />
works, $ 102M will be spent in Queensland this year, an<br />
increase of around 15 per cent over last year's<br />
expenditure.<br />
We are also addressing the problems faced by some of<br />
Queensland's major industries. The crisis in the sugar<br />
and diary industries would be among the most pressing.<br />
As you would all know we have taken important<br />
initiatives aimed at securing necessary solutions to the<br />
problems of those industries.<br />
Mine is a Government of action. It will not shirk the<br />
hard decisions. It will continue working tirelessly in<br />
the best interests of all Australians. I look to you<br />
all for your continued support. </p>
