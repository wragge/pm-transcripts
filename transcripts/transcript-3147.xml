AUSTRALIAN HIGH COMMISSION<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL 9.00 PM 7 FEBRUARY 7 February 1974<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA, THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM,<br />
QC., AT A STATE DINNER GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF<br />
SINGAPORE, MR LEE KUAN YEW, SINGAPORE, THURSDAY, 7 FEBRUARY 1974.<br />
Each time one comes to Singapore, one is reminded of its<br />
economic progress and vitality.<br />
I can think of few countries in which one of the major problems<br />
of the developing world namely sustaining the momentum of economic<br />
growth has been so firmly and successfully met.<br />
This is a nation which has carried out an industrial<br />
revolution and an urban revolution of tremendous import and importance<br />
to this region. I wish to assure you tonight, Mr Prime Minister, of Australia's<br />
strong and continuing interest in maintaining a substantial and enduring<br />
relationship with Singapore, and indeed with all the countries of South-<br />
East Asia. I would like to stress that what has changed since myw Government<br />
came to office is not the degree of Australian interest in South-East<br />
Asia but the nature and direction of that interest. As I have often<br />
said during my present tour, the emphasis of our growing interest will<br />
be less influenced by ideological considerations but more by a<br />
constructive approach, more permanent, more enduring, co-operation<br />
through trade, investment, aid, cultural and other contacts. Defence<br />
co-operation continues, but other forms of co-operation grow.<br />
Behind the change the Australian Government has made lies<br />
partly the political changes occurring within several countries of<br />
the region changes of Government in Australia and New Zealand,<br />
profound constitutional changes in Thailand, Burma and the Philippines,<br />
and the virtual creation of a new independent nation in Papua New Guinea.<br />
It's worth recalling these matters, not least for the benefit<br />
of Australians, because there is a tendency in Australia to think that<br />
Australia has been the only country in the region where there has been<br />
change. Yet important as these internal political changes are, and<br />
significant as the changes in external policies resulting from domestic<br />
change are, they are only part of rapid and dramatic changes taking<br />
place in the wider region in the relations between the great powers. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Super-imposed on all these changes, re-inforcing them, complicating<br />
them and where the changes are beneficial threatening them, is the<br />
energy crisis. The political changes in countries like Australia may<br />
look small beer indeed in the face of such tremendous events.<br />
The great thing however is that these events re-inforce the<br />
idea of the mutual interdependence, of all nations not least of<br />
Singapore and Australia. We are the two great traders of the neighbourhood<br />
our very life depends upon it. Wie are among the two most highly<br />
urbanised countries on earth; we are both essentially nations of cityadwellers.<br />
We are both technological nations, our people and our<br />
economies relying not only on our skills, but on our getting access<br />
to the physical means for applying those skills. Perhaps more than<br />
any nations in the region, we both depend upon our ability to develop<br />
effectively tho. skills of our peoples. And our prosperity depends on<br />
the Drosperity of others. The same developments in Japan, in Britain<br />
and lurope, in the United States: which might damage Singapore would<br />
certainly and simultaneously damage Australia. When we consider the<br />
inter-relationship of national economies, the inter-dependence of the<br />
world economy, it is hardly possible to conceive a prosperous Australia<br />
without a prosperous Singapore.<br />
So there was never a time when our mutual interests and<br />
concerns have been closer,<br />
Sure, Australia's perception of Singapore has changed; it<br />
has widened and broadened.<br />
True, there was a time when Singapore was Asia in Australian<br />
minds, to the extent that we thought much about Asia at all, except<br />
in terms of vague menace. And the perception of Singapore was of<br />
British Singapore, not of Asian Singapore. In 1974 I can say<br />
emphatically that Australia's deep and continuing interest in Singapore,<br />
its welfare, its progress, its role in the region, is a genuine<br />
Australian perception of Singapore as a dynamic, pace-setting Asia<br />
nation. Mir Prime Minister there is no head of Government with whom<br />
I have had a longer, closer association, You extended friendship to<br />
me in days when the party and its lead(-rship were discounted; and you<br />
know from your own experience that friendship and attention extended<br />
in days of adversity aand apparent hopelessness is the most worth<br />
having, because the most sincere.. I have always deeply valued our<br />
association. I value it all the more now that that association can<br />
so significantly affect the basic well-being of the peoples of our<br />
two countries. Our countries have so much in common. Naturally, where the<br />
circumstances of our two nations are different, there will be<br />
different perceptions, At Ottawa last year, some of these differences<br />
were-ventilated that was indeed an illustration of the valua we place<br />
on the Commonwealth forum where frankness in exchange Of Views and<br />
ideas provides one of its main advantages and strengths. I hope,<br />
I believe that one day the states of Asia and the Pacific will be able<br />
to set up a similar sort of forum where leaders can meet not in an<br />
atmosphere of fear or crisis or of expection of aid, but to exchange<br />
views and remove misunderstandings before they develop further. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
I am visiting your country and other South-East Asian states<br />
to demonstrate Australia's continuing more than continuing, our<br />
growing and deepening interest in developing close and friendly ties<br />
with our neighbours.<br />
I hope to place Australia firmly, confidently, co-operatively<br />
in the context of our Asian future.<br />
If we have bilateral problems let us sort thase out in a spirit<br />
of goodwill; if we have different perceptions of world developments,<br />
let us seek to pool our ideas. Our two countries have a long history<br />
of past and friendly co-operation; it is still very much Australian<br />
policy to foster and develop this further.<br />
And they are being developed to our mutual advantage.<br />
We Australians do wish t'Umoo ve away from the idea that our relations<br />
are limited to a defence relationship important as that aspect of<br />
our co-operation is, and will continue to be. It is not just a matter<br />
of bilateral relations at the Government level. There is strengthening<br />
and widening of relations between our peoples Australian tourists,<br />
Singapore students, Australian business, Singapore markets, in civil<br />
aviation, in communicationst in professional interchange over a<br />
whole range of matters which axe important to the people, not just the<br />
politicians. This exchange and interchange on-going and expandingis<br />
the real basis of the developing friendships between our peoples. </p>
