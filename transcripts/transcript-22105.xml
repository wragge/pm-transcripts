    <content><![CDATA[<p>As indicated in her statement the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Kay Patterson, told me yesterday that she intended to resign from the Ministry.</p>
<p>  I express my deep gratitude to Senator Patterson for the huge contribution she has made as a member of the Cabinet over the past four years. She is a wonderful colleague, high in the esteem of all of us.</p>
<p> Senator Patterson has been a fine and compassionate minister, successively in the portfolios of Health and Ageing and Family and Community Services.</p>
<p>  She has worked diligently and successfully to promote better family and social policy.  The professional background which she brought to the two portfolios she served in was of particular value.</p>
<p> Senator Patterson had a special concern for the disabled in our community. Amongst the many reforms, for which she was responsible, was a recent decision by the Government to make it easier and less costly for trusts to be established to support disabled people.</p>
<p> She also led, on behalf of the Commonwealth, the renegotiation of the Australian Health Care agreements, which have placed Commonwealth/State financial and administrative arrangements for public hospitals on a much sounder footing.</p>
<p> Senator Patterson's frontbench work also included valuable periods as Parliamentary Secretary in the portfolios of Immigration and Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>
<p> She is a good humoured person whose contributions around the Cabinet table will be greatly missed.</p>
<p> I speak for all of my Coalition colleagues in thanking Senator Kay Patterson and paying tribute for her ministerial achievements. I know that she will continue, energetically, to represent the people of Victoria in the Senate during the remainder of her term.</p>
