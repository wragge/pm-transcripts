PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
THURSDAY 11 APRIL 1974<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ladies and gentlemen, I announced in the House of<br />
Representatives last night that the Governor-General had agreed that<br />
there should be a simultaneous dissolution of the Senate and the House<br />
of Representatives. He required to be assured on two matters. First<br />
that there would be supply for the public service until the election,<br />
and the other that the electoral machinery was adequate to conduct<br />
the elections on any date that he determined. I this morning gave<br />
His Excellency those assurances and he has agreed that there should be<br />
an election for both Houses on 18 May. The timetable is that the writs<br />
should issue on Saturday 20 April, the nominations should close on<br />
Monday 29 April, the polling day on 18 May and the writs must be<br />
returned on or before 29 June. As you know the Governors of the States<br />
issue the writs for the election of senators and the Governor-General<br />
will be approaching the Governors with a view to obtaining their<br />
consent to the same timetable for the purposes of the election. On<br />
April the Governor-General will also issue writs for the Referendums<br />
to be submitted to the people on 18 May. The four referendums will be<br />
Simultaneous Elections between the two Houses; for the Mode of Altering<br />
the Constitution; the Democratic Elections and for Local Government<br />
Bodies. Perhaps I should say that the referendum for Simultaneous<br />
Elections is all the more relevant on this occasion because when there<br />
is a double dissolution the term of senators elected at it dates from<br />
1 July preceding. So the senators who will be elected as the Constitution<br />
stands at the moment would have their terms dating from 1 July 1973.<br />
If this referendum is carried then their terms will date from the day<br />
of the election. You will remember that's what happened in 1951 when<br />
there was last a double dissolution. The senators had in effect two<br />
and five year terms whereas the House of Representatives was permitted<br />
to have three years. So the way to bring them together will be achieved<br />
if this referendum is carried.<br />
QUESTION: Where will you make your policy speech and when?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is still being arranged it will be announced by<br />
Mr David Combe, the Secretary of the Australian Labor Party. I would<br />
expect it will be in Sydney and about three weeks. before the polling<br />
date. QUESTION: Do you envisage any major changes in policy~ any new policy<br />
initiatives at all when you do make your speech?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Government's policies are clear. It's because the<br />
Government's policies have been delayed and frustrated in the Senate<br />
that this election is taking place. The principle forms in which the<br />
folicy will be carried out are already in bills which have been before<br />
he Senate. As you know, six of those bills have been twice rejected<br />
by the Senate. Three of them are on electoral matters, although they<br />
were all mentioned in the government's policy speech which I delivered<br />
in November 1972, and, of course, in the Australian Labor Party's<br />
published platform before the 1972 elections. Then there are two bills<br />
to carry out the health insurance scheme which was detailed in my policy<br />
speech in November 1972 and incidentally in November 1969, and is also<br />
in the Australian Labor Party's published platform; and finally the<br />
Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill which is in accordance with my<br />
policy speech and the Australian Labor Party's publi -, hed platform. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Those are six bills which have already been twice rejected by the<br />
Senate. So people know quite clearly what we will do when we are<br />
re-elected in those six basic matters. On top of that the Senate<br />
has rejected bills to make the industrial organisation and settlement<br />
of disputes easier in Australia, carrying out, incidentally, a<br />
program which the industrial Court recommended as of the utmost<br />
urgency in February 1969. Our predecessors did nothing about it<br />
and the four States concerned, all three of them Liberal States,<br />
have not hitherto co-operated in that five-year-old urgent plan.<br />
So that's one. Then there is Workers' Compensation for Public<br />
Servants; there is the Superior Court of Australia Bill,<br />
incidentally carrying out a proposal which Sir Garfield Barwick<br />
made and got through Cabinet when he was Attorney-General in 1961,<br />
which Mr. Snedden when he was Attorney-General also worked on, and<br />
which Mr. Justice Bowen when he was Attorney-General actually<br />
introduced in the form of a bill in 1968. Mr. Justice Bowen, as<br />
you know, has paid tribute to what the Chief Justice and Mr. Snedden<br />
have done in working on this bill. When we bring it up its rejected,<br />
and it was on the Senate Notice Paper, but they hadn't got round<br />
actually to a vote of rejecting it a second time. Then there is the<br />
Trade Practices Bill, including, of course, proposals which were put<br />
by former Liberal Attorneys-General Greenwood and Bowen and Hughes;<br />
and it also has consumer protection, which we added. Then there<br />
was the proposal for interchange of powers at a referendum between<br />
the Australian Parliament and the State Parliaments, which five of<br />
the six Premiers welcomed last September. Then there is the<br />
Australian Industries Development Corporation Bill and the National<br />
Investment Fund Bill which accompanies it. They've been rejected.<br />
And then I suppose there are some lesser ones which I needn't worry<br />
you with. Land acquisition in the Australian Capital Territory and<br />
seas and submerged lands royalties on minerals all these have been<br />
rejected once the last one actually has been rejected twice but<br />
all the others were waiting for rejection. Now when we're elected<br />
we will bring those bills in. So the clear lines of our policy are<br />
already known. By contrast I suppose one could say that the Liberals<br />
resent it if anyone discloses any drafts of their policies.<br />
QuIESTION: What is your prediction as to the outcome of the election<br />
for both Houses and secondly, what do you think are going to be the<br />
major issues in the election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It will be very difficult. I think it will be<br />
unlikely that we can get more than 30 senators or all the parties<br />
opposed to us in the Senate can get more than 30 senators. That being<br />
the case, if the Senate were again to reject any of these six bills<br />
upon which the Governor-General has granted the dissolution, there<br />
would be a joint sitting of two Houses and if there was an absolute<br />
majority in favour of the bills at such a joint sitting they would become<br />
law. Clearly there will be a more ample majority in the House of<br />
Representatives than one could ever hope in the Senate. At a joint<br />
sitting then I would expect all these bills to go through. The<br />
major issues will be these matters which we in accordance with our<br />
platform and my policy speech and which we have introduced into the<br />
Parliament and where we have been frustrated by the Senate. In six<br />
cases, these matters have been twice rejected by the Senate. There<br />
are over six matters where there has been a rejection by the Senate<br />
and a clear intention to reject when they came on to a vote one,<br />
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
QUESTION: The Senate has been the cause of the current situation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
QUESTION: If you do win the elections will you intend to carry<br />
out Labor Party policy of abolishing the Upper House?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I've been asked that before. It is not a high<br />
priority. It would require a referendum and this is one referendum<br />
which would have to be carried in each of the six States. No<br />
alteration of the Constitution which affects the representation of<br />
a State can be carried without the approval of the electors in that<br />
State. Clearly since each State is represented in the Senate any<br />
abolition of the Senate proposal would have to be approved by the<br />
electors in each State. There was no commitment in my policy speech<br />
to put such a referendum. I do not propose to put it in my policy<br />
speech in a couple of weeks' time.<br />
QUESTION: Could you tell me: have you an opinion, political or<br />
legal, about the Australia Party's move in the High Court?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe that the Australia Party's move in the<br />
High Court has great constitutional merit. I tried to get the<br />
Australian Labor Party to take the same move when the last<br />
distribution was under way in 1968. We couldn't find the money<br />
to mount the challenge. Unquestionably in the United States such<br />
a challenge would succeed. The Australia Party is trying to have<br />
the High Court give the same interpretation to the Australian<br />
Constitution as the Supreme Court of the United States has given<br />
to exactly the same words in the United States Constitution. One<br />
of the referendums which we are putting to the people, the<br />
democratic elections one, is to write into the Constitution of<br />
Australia the interpretation which the United States Supreme Court<br />
has given the Constitution of the United States. Nobody, however<br />
critical he may be of other aspects of the United States Constitution,<br />
has ever asserted that the United States Supreme Court decisions<br />
of the last ten years have done other than build democracy,<br />
congressional democracy, in the United States. The United States<br />
Congress, for better or for worse, now thoroughly represents the<br />
United States people. That's as a result of the interpretation given<br />
by the U. S. Supreme Court to the U. S. Constitution in case after<br />
case over the last ten years.<br />
QUESTION: Will the Australian High Court be able to delay the<br />
election? PRIME MINISTER: I doubt it. What has happened I don't want to<br />
appear too dogmatic on matters like this because obviously the<br />
High Court has the jurisdiction, the duty, in these matters but<br />
what has happened in the United States Supreme Court where challenges<br />
have been made close to an election, as this challenge is being made,<br />
is to require an assurance that any decision will be applied at the<br />
next election. The United States Supreme Court has not delayed an<br />
election while any such challenge has been heard. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
QUESTION: Two questions actually on behalf of the gallery:<br />
would you repeat the undertaking that you gave at the last election<br />
to meet us regularly in Canberra for a press conference on Tuesdays?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have carried/ 6ut every promise I made before the<br />
last elections. I faithfully carried this out. I've enjoyed it,<br />
if you enjoy it and repeat the request I will comply.<br />
QUESTION: I repeat the request.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I comply.<br />
QUESTION: Senator McManus forecast yesterday that because of<br />
disunity amongst the Opposition parties, Labor might be returned<br />
in the House and win a majority in the Senate. Now if his forecast<br />
goes slightly astray and you win a majority in the Senate but find<br />
yourself in a minority in the House, how would you deal with the<br />
legislation of a Liberal/ Country Party Government coming before<br />
a Labor majority in the Senate, legislation with which you had<br />
fundamental objection? How would you deal with supply bills, if<br />
circumstances arose which you saw in the same light as the Liberal,<br />
Country Party and D. L. P. parties have seen last week?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The second question is utterly hypothetical, clearly.<br />
The first matter concerns a prediction by Senator McManus. I think<br />
he was correct.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Snedden has undertaken that if he is elected, in his<br />
first Budget he will cut income taxes by $ 600 million a year. Will<br />
you match that promise?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I shall not.<br />
QUESTION: Will you tell me what attitude you will take towards<br />
taxation? PRIME MINISTER: Mr. Snedden, of course, had scarcely made the<br />
promise before it was . rejected by Mr. Anthony, who asserts that<br />
he will be the Treasurer if there's any change of Government. You'll<br />
remember quite clearly that Mr. Anthony has said that he will be<br />
non-commital on any such proposal. Please don't ask me questions<br />
about my opponents' policies when they are not clear among themselves.<br />
This at least was a specific one by part of them. It was not made<br />
before it was disowned by the other one.<br />
QUESTION: To clear up your answer to a previous question: In the<br />
new House exactly what majority do you expect to have and which seats<br />
do you think you could pick up and which could you lose?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: How many seats we pick up will depend partly on the<br />
candidates, and there has been some speculation on that. I'm clearly<br />
not going to suggest what seats we could lose, but I don't believe<br />
that we will lose any seats.<br />
QUESTION: To what extent can any Federal Government control the<br />
rate of inflation in Australia at the moment? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: Where an Australian Government, the Commonwealth<br />
Government, can affect inflation my Government has taken the<br />
appropriate action. There are, however, two fields where the<br />
Australian Government cannot take action. There are some components<br />
of inflation where the States can take action and the Australian<br />
Government cannot. One very clear example is land prices.<br />
It is open to every State to control, to regulate, land prices.<br />
And in times of inflation people invest in land because they<br />
believe it's one form of investment where the inflated price<br />
of land will keep pace with inflation elsewhere. People believe<br />
that it's a sound investment. When there's inflation people<br />
speculate in land. Every State Government could stop it. The<br />
Australian Government can only stop it in the Territories. You'll<br />
notice that in Canberra the rise in land prices which we inherited<br />
has been brought to a halt. There are other aspects of inflation<br />
which in the case of trading countries cannot be stopped by those<br />
countries without stopping their trade. And the present fact is<br />
in the world that all the trading countries Australia, Japan,<br />
the United States, Canada, Britain, Western Europe are suffering<br />
greviously from inflation. They are trading with each other they're<br />
importing each other's inflation.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think you will be announcing any new antiinflationary<br />
initiatives during the campaign?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't expect so. I notice that Mr. Snedden<br />
has already said that he would abandon or reverse all the antiinflationary<br />
steps that we have taken. And these are antiinflationary<br />
steps which everybody has praised us for taking.<br />
It took some courage to make some of them, but we took them.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think a floating exchange rate would be a good<br />
thing in this situation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm the head of Government and I will not<br />
speculate on matters of currency. No head of Government can<br />
speculate on the rate of exchange between his country's currency<br />
and any other country's currency. I gather that Mr. Snedden has<br />
said that we should cut the link between the Australian dollar<br />
and the U. S. dollar. Mr. Anthony has supported that proposition.<br />
His motive is very clearly to devalue the Australian dollar.<br />
I believe that would be an utterly irresponsible and highly<br />
inflationary measure. The Australian dollar is not overvalued.<br />
It has appreciated in value very greatly under my government.<br />
It was because it was undervalued under our predecessors,<br />
particularly when Mr. Snedden was Treasurer, that there was so<br />
much hot money coming into Australia. That was producing<br />
inflation, and it was buying up our assets on the cheap. It<br />
would be highly irresponsible to devalue the Australian dollar.<br />
QUESTION: Will you be making any fresh promises in your policy<br />
speech?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There will be developments of initiatives we've<br />
already taken and there will be many commitments in the light<br />
of expert advice which we have received in the meantime. For<br />
instance, only yesterday we had the report of the Kangan Committee<br />
on Technical and Further Education. There will be reports quite<br />
soon concerning Data and Statistical matters from Professor Crisp. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
There will also be a report on retraining schemes from a committee<br />
under Professor Cochran. These are matters where you can expect<br />
that we will make commitments. But in other matters I would expect<br />
that there will be more details on questions such as pre-schools,<br />
day care, child care and also on house insurance. Clearly the<br />
shortcomings of house insurance have been very greatly brought to<br />
mind by the fact that people who were flooded in Brisbane in<br />
particular. Ipswich and other places, found that their policies<br />
didn't cover them against floods. Even the Treasurer of Queensland<br />
had taken out house insurance on the house for which he had got a loan<br />
from an insurance company and he found they hadn't covered him<br />
against flood. He was left high and dry in that respect at least.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, will you be moderating your views for<br />
Sydney's second airport. Will it be at Galston?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This matter, as you know, is under consideration.<br />
I see in one of the papers that Mr. Snedden has said that if there<br />
was a change of government that government would extend the<br />
operations at Mascot. I believe that, and I commend Mr. Snedden<br />
for being so frank about it, this is the first time he has been<br />
prepared to commit himself on this issue. He wouldn't find that<br />
the Premier of New South Wales would support him on that. The<br />
fact is that no electorate in the vicinity of Mascot will support<br />
a party which is committed to expanding operations at Mascot.<br />
Everybody knows that.<br />
QUESTION: Could you elaborate on your plans for the rest of today<br />
and the Easter weekend? For example, are you still intending<br />
to go to Cairns to have a rest and work on your policy speech?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am going to Cairns. I doubt if it will be a<br />
rest. I will be working on my policy speech. My ministers have<br />
already provided me with suggestions as to the way to present<br />
our policies, to present the further development of the policies<br />
to which we have been committed and which we have done our best<br />
to implement hitherto and, also, of course, summaries of what<br />
we have already achieved. My present plan is to attend a meeting<br />
of the Administrative Committee of the New South Wales Branch<br />
of the Australian Labor Party at about 3 o'clock this afternoon.<br />
I will then touch down at Brisbane. I will meet Lord Mayor,<br />
Clem Jones, there. He has commitments in Rockhampton tomorrow;<br />
I'm taking the opportunity to discuss various issues relating<br />
to the forthcoming election with him on the way between Brisbane<br />
and Rockhampton. And then I will arrive in Cairns tonight.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, when you saw the Governor-General<br />
yesterday did you put before him all those matters that you read<br />
out to us earlier about what the Senate has done?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
QUESTION: Or was your advice based mainly on the events of<br />
yesterday? PRIME MINISTER: I followed the precedent that Sir Robert Menzies<br />
set in the letter of 1951 to Governor-. General McKell. Sir<br />
Robert Menzies referred to one bill, the Commonwealth Bank Bill,<br />
on which there had been two rejections by the Senate. He did<br />
in fact then go on to list the course of obstruction by the Senate. </p>
<p>I -7-<br />
My list was, of course, very much more formidable.<br />
QUESTION: During the last election campaign, when you didn't<br />
have control of the Senate anyhow and it didn't matter, you<br />
promised that there would be no change in the first-past-the-post<br />
voting system during the life of the still present Parliament.<br />
I wonder now that there is some chance that you may get control<br />
of the Senate and the thing becomes feasible if you would outline<br />
your intentions in that regard?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You are quite right. There was no promise<br />
to the people in this respect at the last elections and therefore<br />
when we brought in our various electoral bills we made no promise.<br />
We made no provision for first-past-the-post voting. There will<br />
be no amendments of the electoral laws under my government in the<br />
next Parliament other than those which are set out in the policy<br />
speech.<br />
QUESTION: On the question of inflation and the economy, which<br />
will be major issues in the campaign, how do you reconcile the<br />
rate of inflation today running at around about 14 per cent<br />
with the five or six per cent of your predecessor?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There are two reasons. We inherited some<br />
policies which were just made for inflation. The currency was<br />
undervalued and furthermore the last Snedden Budget in 1972<br />
encouraged inflation. There was a very great deal of domestic<br />
money infused into the economy and of course that, added to the<br />
overseas funds coming in, just produced the inflation. Since<br />
then the imported inflation has grown because in 1973 all the<br />
countries I mentioned earlier have much higher inflation than<br />
they had in 1972. If, however, we had not taken our steps to<br />
upvalue the Australian currency to regulate the flow of loan<br />
funds from overseas by having the variable deposit requirement,<br />
if we hadn't taken steps such as that and the unpopular but<br />
inevitable interest rate increases, then our inflation would<br />
be very much worse.<br />
QUESTION: Assuming you are returned to office and assuming either<br />
Mr. Young or Mr. Hawke are also elected, would you hope that either<br />
or both of them would be in your next Cabinet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I only have one vote in the Caucus so I'm not<br />
going to answer a question like that. I've never run tickets<br />
for Executive or for Cabinet. The Caucus will be able to make<br />
up its own mind between all those who nominate themselves.<br />
There are two things required: when the Caucus has its first<br />
meeting aspirants nominate themselves and then in a secret ballot<br />
everybody, including the aspirants, have to state whom they think<br />
they should have as the Government of the country.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think the 16 months period was sufficient<br />
for your government to show its paces?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I think we've set a very good pace and<br />
I think the people have been encouraged and exhilarated by it.<br />
There is unquestionably a very much greater interest in politics<br />
in Australia among Australians than there was 16 months ago.<br />
And there is unquestionably a very much greater interest in<br />
Australia among the countries of the world than there was 16 months<br />
ago. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
QUESTION: I was wondering why the Government in the Senate<br />
let the Opposition parties off the hook last night in voting<br />
on the Appropriation Bills?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They didn't let the Opposition off the hook;<br />
they impaled them on it. Because when this adjournment motion<br />
was moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, this<br />
hypocritical schoolboyish motion, and when that motion was<br />
supported by the Leader of the Country Party in the Senate<br />
and by the Leader of the D. L. P. in the Senate, the very next<br />
speaker was the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and<br />
he moved that the question be put. He said: Let this be<br />
resolved immediately. If the question is not put, that is,<br />
if you won't vote on supply, this will be taken by the Government<br />
as a refusal of supply. A vote was taken immediately to put the<br />
question, the vote was defeated. That meant the question could<br />
not be put; the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition,<br />
the Leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate, the vote couldn't<br />
be taken on what he moved. That mean we couldn't proceed with<br />
supply in the Senate. The Senate wouldn't debate or vote on<br />
supply. Thereupon we did two things: we put in the House of<br />
Representatives immediately the remaining supply bills, the ones<br />
which enable a Government to carry on after 1 July and sent those<br />
to the Senate and they got to them at I o'clock. At 7.30 I<br />
waited on the Governor-General and by 8.30 I told the House of<br />
Representatives, and the Leader of the Government in the Senate<br />
told the Senate, what the Governor-General's intentions were.<br />
And after a great deal of humming and harring about dates and<br />
that sort of thing, which are not their responsibility, the<br />
Opposition senators then voted supply, all of them; but they<br />
were not going to vote, they had refused to vote on it. They<br />
refused supply; the tactics were obvious. There was no humming<br />
and harring; we put them on the spot immediately, we impaled<br />
them on the hook at once. They refused supply to the Australian<br />
Government elected 16 months ago the first time that any<br />
Opposition has ever threatened it in the Senate.<br />
QUESTION: Would you do the same thing if~ jou were in opposition?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is an utterly hypothetical question.<br />
It is a totally unlikely situation. ' I think that the Australian<br />
public are anxious to have a Government which will get on with th~ e<br />
job. That is, they want to elect senators who will be cf the same<br />
mind, the same date as members of the House of Representatives.<br />
QUESTION: What is the state of the A. L. P. funds? Is there plenty<br />
to carry out an unlimited campaign or will there be some<br />
restrictions? PRIME MI* rISTER: There h, . ve never been unlimited funds. I'm<br />
assured, I believe, there aren't on this occasion, but<br />
contributions will be thankfully received; they will be in<br />
a good cause, and people know that what we promise we shall do<br />
our best to perform and in a new Parliament we will be able to<br />
perform more promptly, more fully. </p>
