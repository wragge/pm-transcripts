FOR MEDIA 14 DECEMBER 1984<br />
NEW CALEDONIA<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke today welcomed the apparent<br />
easing of tensions in New Caledonia and the recent<br />
initiative by the new French High Commissioner, M. Pisani,<br />
to enter into formal discussi-ons with the principal<br />
political groups in the territory. These discussions are to<br />
commience tomorrow, 15 December. Mr Hawke expressed the hope<br />
that these talks will prove constructive in developing a<br />
peaceful solution to the political future of New Caledonia.<br />
Mr Hawke paid tribute to the wisdom and statemanship shown<br />
by the FLNKS leader, M. Tjibaou, in agreeing to lift road<br />
blocks in the territory and to participate in talks with<br />
M. Pisani, despite the personal tragedy M. Tjibaou suffered<br />
in the recent outbreaks of violence.<br />
Mr Hawke said that Australia along with all Forum members<br />
would continue to take a close interest in developments in<br />
New Caledonia. He noted that it had been decided that the<br />
Forum Ministerial Group on New Caledonia, established at the<br />
Tuvalu Forum in August 1984, would meet in Wellington next<br />
week to review developments in New Caledonia and to report<br />
to all Forum heads of government on their deliberations.<br />
Australia's views on New Caledonia are well known and were<br />
most recently enunciated by Mr Hayden in his statement of<br />
27 November. </p>
