PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH TO ALP LUNCH, SEAGULLS<br />
FOOTBALL CLUB, TWEED HEADS 17 AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I think you would expect me perhaps to say something<br />
about the international context and I do it because, this<br />
morning for instance, shown on television some people<br />
who were expressing dissent, opposition to the recent.<br />
decisions that we've taken. It would be useful, it seems<br />
to me, just to spend a little time sharing with you my<br />
thinking about what Australia should do in the<br />
circumstances with which we're currently confronted.<br />
I have said that the decision that I took after<br />
consultation with some of my Ministers and with others to<br />
despatch three of our ships to the Gulf area was the most<br />
serious decision I think that I've had to take since I've<br />
been Prime Minister. Paradoxically, while it was the<br />
most serious, in the end it was not a hard decision<br />
because the principles, I believe, are clear.<br />
For me the intellectual setting was clarified by the fact<br />
that recently I've had a rare opportunity to engage in<br />
some personal reading, because normally the official<br />
paper that floods across my desk takes virtually all my<br />
time that's available. But because I had a little bit of<br />
time in hospital in recuperation recently I had some time<br />
available to do some personal reading. I took the<br />
opportunity to read a massive two volume biography of<br />
Winston Churchill written by William Manchester a<br />
magnificent piece of biographical writing.<br />
It's all interesting, but for me the part of that<br />
biography which stuck most clearly in my mind was the<br />
story of the tragic events of the 1930s. After the<br />
Second World War there were the Nuremburg Trials at which<br />
the Nazis were put on trial. After you've read the<br />
biography of Churchill by Manchester you come to the<br />
conclusion I think that I did that there should have been<br />
two Nuremburg Trials. There should have been the trials<br />
of the Nazis and there should've been the trials of the<br />
appeasers. Because without both of them, without both of<br />
them you couldn't have had the Second World War. </p>
<p>The Second World War resulted from two things. From the<br />
evil and the tyranny of the Nazis who believed that might<br />
was right, that one nation could swallow and destroy its<br />
neighbours with impunity. That was one element-of the<br />
tragedy of the Second World War. But the second-was the<br />
weakness, the preparedness of other nations, and<br />
particularly those with a major responsibility, to allow<br />
it to happen. And when you read that biography, the<br />
tragedy is that you see that at the very time that Hitler<br />
made his first move into the General's staff, the<br />
German army had made the decision that they were going to<br />
depose Hitler, and they'd made that decision on the<br />
assumption, the belief that Britain and France were going<br />
to move against him. And if that had happened, as it<br />
should've happened, then Hitler would've been deposed and<br />
the infinite, immeasurable tragedy of the Second World<br />
War would not have occurred.<br />
It was in the knowledge that this was the truth of<br />
history that I knew that we have now entered one of the<br />
most optimistic phases in the whole of human history. In<br />
my life I have witnessed the tragedy of the Second World<br />
War to which I've referred. I've also witnessed the<br />
ominous terror that has gripped so much of thinking men<br />
and women that we have been for so long in the post-war<br />
period on the edge of the nuclear abyss, that the<br />
threatening, turbulent relations between the super<br />
powers, Soviet Union and the United States accumulating<br />
the means for the obliteration of mankind from this<br />
planet in those massive nuclear arsenals, to threaten our<br />
very existence on the face of this planet. But we have<br />
now seen that due to intelligence and sensible<br />
commitment, within the Soviet Union and the United<br />
States, that that threat has been very very substantially<br />
diminished I think to the point of elimination.<br />
And so, there is a very especial obligation upon the<br />
world community in this new era of the elimination of<br />
that bipolar threat, the great obligation upon the world<br />
community to make it clear to every nation that the world<br />
is not going to tolerate action where a large nation can<br />
swallow up its small neighbour and do it with impunity.<br />
Those principles are clear and if we don't as a world<br />
community accept that commitment then we will not be, as<br />
a world community, taking advantage of the great new<br />
opportunities for constructive development that have been<br />
created by the intelligence in the relationships<br />
between the super powers.<br />
My friends, no-one hopes more devoutly than I do that the<br />
potential conflict in the Gulf area will be avoided<br />
because I and my colleagues in Government have spent<br />
seven and a half years devoting ourselves to stimulating<br />
the processes towards peace and disarmament. So we hope<br />
that the exhibition of the commitment of so many nations,<br />
including amongst the Arab nations, will lead to the<br />
conclusion on the part of Suddam Hussein that in the </p>
<p>interests of his own people, as well as the interests of<br />
the people in the region, that he should withdraw. And if<br />
in fact Iraq has concerns about its relationships with<br />
its neighbour, then let those concerns be the subject of<br />
negotiation and mediation. That's the way to settle<br />
disputes between people. It's the way to settle-disputes<br />
between nations. in the 20th Century we have been<br />
witness too much to the insanity of war and the tragedy<br />
of war and we must understand that war has to be avoided<br />
and that the concept of acquisition of territory by naked<br />
force is unacceptable.<br />
So my friends, I trust and hope that by the time those<br />
three ships reach the Gulf area that sanity will prevail,<br />
or will have prevailed and if it does then I believe in<br />
some small way the actions that Australians have taken<br />
will have been part of that process. Too many Australian<br />
lives have been lost in two wars in defence of the<br />
principles of the right of self-determination and the<br />
right of individual nations to live in peace without the<br />
threat of conflict. Too many Australian lives have been<br />
laid down by previous generations for this generation to<br />
forsake that principle.<br />
I trust that our determination together with that of<br />
others and now so many other nations will mean that that<br />
conflict will be avoided. I trust that the people of<br />
Australia fully understand the commitment and the<br />
principles which have guided reaching that<br />
conclusion. ends </p>
