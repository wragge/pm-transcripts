TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP HYATT HOTEL, SUR. ABAYA, THURSDAY APRIL 23 1992<br />
EELQE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I just thought I would give you a few remarks on the<br />
visit. I am very happy with the visit, I think it's<br />
gone well, it's been a very friendly and I think a<br />
successful one. We came here to make it clear that<br />
Indonesia is in the top order of Australian priorities,<br />
to say that we are serious neighbours, that we have<br />
obviously the longer term to live together and that we<br />
want to concentrate on issues of substance. But I<br />
think we've got the balance right in talking about<br />
those issues and at the same time making clear our<br />
views on some of the matters which have been<br />
controversial in the past. So we said we come as<br />
neighbours, we've got much to do together, we can<br />
develop each others economies, we can come more closer<br />
together culturally end as well as that, we've been<br />
able to say the things that we feel strongly about and<br />
put a point clearly.<br />
So I think that has been both understood and received<br />
well by the Government of Indonesia and hence I regard<br />
the visit as a successful one.<br />
J: Should Prime Ministers and Ministers come here more<br />
often?<br />
PM, Obviously one should be visiting one's neighbours more<br />
than one visits distant parts. We've had I think now<br />
16 Australian Ministers here in the last couple of<br />
years so there's a great exchange and a substantial<br />
number of visits by Indonesian Ministers to Australia<br />
in the recent past. So there is a lot going on, and of<br />
course getting the Governm~ ent's agreement to a<br />
ministerial Forum will also help because it means we<br />
will have regular dialogue with a range of ministers </p>
<p>TE7 L i 2, 1 7: 03 N0 i. CIc: F<br />
2<br />
both foreign and economic ministers about that which is<br />
happening. Now I met eight Economic Ministers for<br />
lunch the other day and they're terribly interested in<br />
Australia, they're pleased Australia is investing in<br />
this country and I think they will welcome a greater<br />
frequency of official exchanges.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what should we be expecting, maybe that<br />
is the wrong word, what should we be looking for from<br />
the Indonesians to put the flesh on the bones of this?<br />
PM: I think from my point of view, I came here to make this<br />
a visit which would bring us basically closer together,<br />
to focus on the fundamentals, not to come here looking<br />
for any particular support for initiatives or ventures,<br />
but simply to say we are here as friends, we take you<br />
seriously, we want to be part of your development, we<br />
want you to be part of ours. They've responded In kind<br />
and I think the interest in Australia and the fact that<br />
they accept the fact that Australians are now looking<br />
at the Asia-Pacific seriously, it is no longer<br />
tokenism, that it really is a serious engagement by<br />
Australia with the region, makes us I think a very<br />
serious force here and I think they are the things of<br />
substance, all the other things follow.<br />
J: Have you considered inviting President Soeharto to<br />
visit Australia?<br />
PM: I extended an invitation to President Soeharto this<br />
morning, saying if he would wish to Visit Australia we<br />
would be delighted to have him.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: The response that I normally give when I'm invited is<br />
to say thank you very much, if I have an opportunity<br />
I'll think about it.<br />
J: Would you expect to see him within a year?<br />
PM: No, he's got an election on this year.<br />
J: Foreign Minister Alatas yesterday indicated that It<br />
might not be productive for the relationship for<br />
President Soeharto to visit, he seemed to be indicating<br />
that President Soeharto could face some hostile<br />
reception in Australia due to the East Timor issue. Do<br />
you share that view?<br />
PM: That's a possibility but again it would be the<br />
substance that matters. I would certainly believe that<br />
but again it's a matter for him and his own schedule.<br />
J: Going on to Papua New Guinea, are you aware of the.<br />
Herald Sun's report of the internal Australian defence<br />
industries memo alleging that Australian aid Is being<br />
used to buy guns and American guns at that?<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL: 27. Apr .92 1: 0 jo .018 F*. 0351<br />
3<br />
PM: I was told about it, that was all. I haven't seen the<br />
report.<br />
3: Will you be asking about the direction of aid to Papua<br />
New Guinea.<br />
PM: we fund budget aid to the Government of Papua New<br />
Guinea, what they do with their aid is a matter for<br />
them basically.<br />
3: Prime Minister, you say you've got the balance right,<br />
You feel you've got the balance right between the<br />
economic push and the human rights movement, how do you<br />
respond to those critics back in Australia who say that<br />
you haven't, that in feet you've been too soft and too<br />
apologetic?<br />
PM; I've put my views firmly, I repeated them at a press<br />
conference, everything I said to the President you know<br />
because I've said it to you and I made our position<br />
clear where we stand on human rights questions. But<br />
again the balance has got to be there, and the<br />
appropriate balance is to recognise, I think the<br />
stability which the Soeharto Government has brought to<br />
the region, held the Indonesian archipelago together,<br />
bounded together as a nation, lifted its material<br />
standard of living and in the process given Australia a<br />
quarter of a century of peace of mind it would not<br />
otherwise have had, and to say that we appreciate that,<br />
that the Government Is a feature in our stability and<br />
that we want to do more with it. Now that's the issue<br />
of primary substance, that and economic development in<br />
the relationship and one's got to get the balance<br />
right, governments have got to get the balance right.<br />
J; Mr Keating, any disappointments In your trip to<br />
Indonesia?<br />
PM: None, as I said yesterday I couldn't have had it any<br />
better I don't think.<br />
J: Will you be taking any further steps to promote your<br />
proposal about APEC heads-of-government meetings?<br />
PM: Well, I've written now to President Soeharto, I've<br />
spoken with him and to Prime Minister Miyazawa and<br />
President Bush after a conversation I have with<br />
President Bush in January. This is something which, as<br />
I said, I've got no deadlines on. I think over time it<br />
is going to happen and the earlier, the better.<br />
J: But what is your next step? </p>
<p>TEL: .7. pr 9' lb .1<br />
4<br />
PM: I've got no other next steps to fulfil. As I said<br />
yesterday, I'm not beating a drum about it. I didn't<br />
come here, you know, on the basis that I had to produce<br />
some sort of support by President Soeharto for this. I<br />
came f or the other reason -to build the relationship,<br />
that is why I'm here. And he said himself that he<br />
thought it was Inevitable that it should happen, it is<br />
only a matter of when.<br />
3: Mr Keating, do you think the Papua New Guinean carriers<br />
that helped Australian troops in World War 11 are<br />
entitled to compensation?<br />
PM: That is not an issue I've thought much or know much<br />
about to be honest.<br />
J: Could I ask you a very related topic, what significance<br />
do you think Kokoda has for Australia?<br />
PM: Well I think Kokoda has enormous significance for<br />
Australia. in 1942, Australia was threatened with<br />
invasion for the first time arnd that invasion force was<br />
repelled by Australian troops alone in Papua New<br />
Guinea. When I say alone, of course after the battle<br />
in the Coral Sea, but in terms of the land war, alone.<br />
And while much of the Anzac tradition has been<br />
developed in World War I and around Gallipoli and<br />
Flanders, Austral. ia was never threatened with invasion<br />
in World War I It was in World War II. But the Anzac<br />
tradition has in fact really enhanced itself in world<br />
War II. But that is not reflected much in our<br />
contemporary treatment of the history. So what I would<br />
like to do if nothing else, in visiting Kokoda is to<br />
pay tribute to the Australians who fought for our<br />
liberty and for those who died there and to remember<br />
them.<br />
3; Should a IKokoda day replace Anzac day?<br />
PM: Well I don't think that is at all appropriate.<br />
3: Mr Keating, Dr Hewson will be there for the Anizac Day<br />
celebrations as well. Will you be prepared to put<br />
aside the political differences while you are outside<br />
the country as the former Prime Minister did when he<br />
went to Gallipoli?<br />
PM: Well he is coming, so therefore it is pretty obvious<br />
that we have. But, again, Opposition leaders and Prime<br />
ministers have always been involved in Anzac Day<br />
ceremonies.<br />
3; Does the study of the strategic and technical<br />
imperatives of the Kokoda campaign incline you in any<br />
way towards the policy of forward defence nowadays? </p>
<p>T EL: jF. 9 17: C c C1~ F<br />
PM: I don't think the bar room here is a time to discuss<br />
the defence policy of Australia, Dennis, but a1l good<br />
will towards you, I mean, I think probably on that note<br />
I should leave.<br />
