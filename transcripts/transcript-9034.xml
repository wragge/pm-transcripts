I L PRIME MINISTER 126/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, IMP<br />
REMEMBRANCE DAY<br />
I was honoured to participate today In the Remembrance Day ceremony at<br />
the Australian War Memorial for the entombment of the Unknown Australian<br />
Soldier. After the service, I spoke with the 14 First World War veterans who<br />
attended the ceremony and thanked them on behalf of all Australians for their<br />
involvement. I congratulate all those involved in the arrangements for the ceremony and in<br />
particular members of the Australian Defence Force for the extraordinary care<br />
they took with the preparations for the ceremony.<br />
The Entombment of the -Unknown Australian Soldier involved the cooperation<br />
of a large number of people and organisations in France, Britain and<br />
Australia. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the High<br />
Commission and Embassies in Britain, France and Belgium all played<br />
Important roles.<br />
The ceremony brought to the attention of all Australians the important role the<br />
Australian War Memorial has played and continues to play in the life of the<br />
nation. I commend the dedication, professionalism and commitment of all<br />
those involved.<br />
The Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator John Faulkner, has announced<br />
today that supporters of the Australian War Memorial intend to establish a<br />
Foundation to assist the memorial. I strongly support the establishment of<br />
such a Foundation and encourage all Australians to respond.<br />
The Australian War Memorial helps us to learn about our country's proud<br />
history and understand more about our own national character. We should<br />
never forget those who gave their lives and all who had served their country.<br />
