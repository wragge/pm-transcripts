CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY!' EMBAR'ORD UNTILDELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE 
CITIZENSHIP -CEREMONY<br />
FAIRFIELD .23 AUGUST 1989<br />
Distinguished guests,<br />
Fellow citizens,<br />
Let me first of all extend my congratulat<br />
the Fairfield City Council for organising<br />
ceremony today. ions and thanks to<br />
this important<br />
More than forty years ago, on 30 September 1948, the then<br />
Australian Government I record-with pride that it was a<br />
Labor Government introduced into Parliament the<br />
Nationality and Citizenship Bill.. When this legislation<br />
became law it established for the first time one of the most<br />
powerful and vigorously constructive forces in the<br />
Australian community: the principle of Australian<br />
Citizenship. That law initiated a process under which in<br />
the succeeding years more than two milliop: people an<br />
average of 1,000 people every week . have taken on the<br />
rights and responsibilities of Australian citizenship.<br />
To mark the fortieth anniversary of this Bill, and to give<br />
extra encouragement to this vital process; of citizenship, I<br />
launched, on 30 September 1988, the Year of Citizenship.<br />
Throughout the Year, my Ministers and. I have. attended<br />
citizenship ceremonies like this in'every, part of Australia,<br />
raising the level of awareness in thecommunity about the<br />
importance of Australian citizenship-and encouraging<br />
Australian residents to become citizens.:<br />
So it is a real pleasure-to announce that over the financial<br />
year 1988-89 a record 114,977 persons have applied for<br />
Australian citizenship. Thirty of those people are here<br />
today. A measure of the. impact of the Year of Citizenship<br />
is provided by the fact that in this last financial year<br />
more long-term residents applied for citizenship than in any<br />
previous year.<br />
But the Year of Citizenship is not a one-off effort.<br />
There are still too many'Australian residents who are<br />
qualified to become Australians citizens . but who have not<br />
done so. 1295<br />

So I want to use this opportunity today to urge as many of<br />
them as possible to follow the example of the 30 new<br />
citizens here to express their commitment to Australia by<br />
taking on the rights and responsibilities of Australian<br />
citizens. Those who are becoming citizens today have many different<br />
histories. They have come here from many different nations<br />
Poland, Argentina, Iran, Malta, the Philippines, Chile,<br />
Lebanon, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Peru, Uruguay, and the United<br />
Kingdom. In their diversity they represent the diversity of<br />
Australia. Let me say directly to these 30 Australians: I recognise,<br />
and I think everyone recognises,, the magnitude of the<br />
decision you have made.<br />
The decisions to come to Australia, and then to take up<br />
Australian citizenship, are among the greatest decisions one<br />
could make in a lifetime. I You have chosen to make a public<br />
commitment to your new~ homeland a. conscious declaration of<br />
loyalty that those, ofus: whowere. born here rarely have<br />
occasion to make.<br />
Being Australian means many. things. It means sharing an<br />
identity as Australian,. . t means taking responsibility for<br />
maintaining and enhancing. the prosperity of our nation and<br />
the harmony of our society.. It . means accepting our<br />
parliamentary institutions, the:' rule'of law, freedom of<br />
speech, our values of tolerance.; It means having pride in<br />
the diversity of our multicultural society and in the values<br />
of fairness, equity, tolerance and. a fair go for all.<br />
Above all else, being lustralian means having a commitment<br />
to Australia. The way, you'look, the way you dress, the<br />
faith you observe, the place where you were born are<br />
irrelevant to the questionof whether you are an Australian.<br />
What counts is commitment and that's what you have<br />
displayed in abundance today.<br />
Australia is, of course, predominantly a country of<br />
immigrants. Immigration: has beenialmajor source of<br />
population increase since : 1788.. Four out of every ten<br />
Australians today are immigrants or the children of<br />
immigrants. Half of them come from non-English speaking<br />
countries. Two million: Australians speak a language other<br />
than English at home.<br />
In short, we are one of the most. diverse, multicultural<br />
nations on earth. Andirairfield itself would be one of the<br />
most multicultural areas, with one of the highest<br />
proportions of overseas born residents in Australia. People<br />
from over 100 different nationalities have made their homes<br />
here some born overseas and some, like you Mr Mayor, born<br />
in Australia of parents who emigrated to make a new life in<br />
this country<br />

I see that reflected in the faces around'me today. They are<br />
faces of almost every continent, race, religion, culture,<br />
language and society in the world.: Indeed, if someone were<br />
to ask me what multi cultural Australia is like, I could<br />
simply answer come to Fairfield, and see for yourself.<br />
As far as Australia is concerned, this diversity has been a<br />
great source of new talents and ideas, a-catalyst for social<br />
dynamism, a true source of wealth in both its cultural and<br />
economic senses.<br />
The contribution that our immigrants have made to this<br />
country is enormous. You only have to look around you to<br />
see it in the clothes we wear, the food we eat, the<br />
buildings we live and work in, the machineswe use.<br />
Here in Fairfield we have children from many different<br />
cultural and linguistic backgrounds growingiup as young<br />
Australians. These children are learning to live in harmony<br />
with each other. They don't get themselvestied up in knots<br />
trying to define multiculturalism -' they simply live it,<br />
every day of their lives, in the playgrounds and on the<br />
streets. Some people however see diversity as a threat to our social<br />
cohesion. They would seek to turn the clock back to the<br />
days of discrimination on the basis of the colour of one's<br />
skin or the country of one's birth. I<br />
But we can't turn the clock'back and I for one would never<br />
want to.<br />
The White Australia Policy must stay in thei history books<br />
where it belongs.<br />
All Australians should enjoy the rights and carry the<br />
responsibilities of life in this nationl All of us are<br />
equally entitled to a fair go and to Government services.<br />
All of us should have the opportunity to make use of our<br />
skills and talents. I<br />
These principles are encapsulated in the N tional Agenda for<br />
Multicultural Australia which I announced ast month.<br />
The National Agenda involves commitments of some $ 55 million<br />
over three years and more than $ 75 million in total.<br />
They include:<br />
new arrangements to assess overseas qualifications which<br />
will prevent the wasteful squandering of immigrants'<br />
skills; I<br />
a package of measures to improve Australia's language<br />
skillsi and<br />
a three year community relations campaign to tackle<br />
personal prejudice and intolerant behaviour. 1297 </p>
<p>4 S 4.<br />
It remains the challenge ofÅ our generation to complete the<br />
transition to a new, multicultural Australia. We are all<br />
part of it and we are all, in our way, contributing to it.<br />
The National Agenda provides a new focus and a new<br />
direction. L<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, FO;<br />
Let me conclude by quoting the first of the goals proposed<br />
by the Advisory Council for a Multicultural Australia: " All Th<br />
Australians should have'a commitment to Australia and share a<br />
responsibility for furthering our national interests". 19<br />
Those of you who are becoming citizensooday are. making a e<br />
public declaration of this commitment. You join more than be<br />
one hundred thousand others who have taken this pledge<br />
during the Year of Citizenship. Au<br />
~ in<br />
You represent many different backgrounds and many different i"<br />
histories. But you all'have in common the wish to declare r<br />
yourselves as Australians. m Vi<br />
As Prime Minister of Australia I am proud to welcome you as<br />
Australians and as fellow, citizens, and I wish you well in Th<br />
all you do in the future. r<br />
Just as the trees you are to be given will grow and prosper,<br />
so I trust will your commitment to, and success in, this<br />
nation thrive in the years ahead. v<br />
From here let us work together, combining our talents, to<br />
build a cohesive, tolerant multicultural society and to<br />
ensure this great nation of Australia remains in the future<br />
what it surely is todayj-the greatest nation on earth. ec<br />
