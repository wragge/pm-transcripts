CHECK AGAINST DELITVERY EMBARQOED UINTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY PRIME MINISTER<br />
ANNUAL GEN4ERAL MEETING, PHARMACY GUILD OF AUSTRALIA, SOUTH<br />
AUSTRALIA BRANCH<br />
ADELAIDE, 28 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
Peter Staples<br />
Colin Johns<br />
Members of the South Australian Branch of the Pharmacy<br />
Guild<br />
One of the most time worn phrases of political speeches is<br />
the traditional introductory comment: it is a pleasure to<br />
be here tontight.<br />
On this special occasion, let me invest that sentiment with<br />
new meaning and relevance.<br />
It truly LCL a pleasure to be here tonight because my<br />
presence as Prime Minister, speaking to this meeting of the<br />
Pharmacy Guild, confirms a very pleasing fact.<br />
Over the last twelve months the Federal Government and the<br />
Pharmacy Guild had something of a blue and it was a<br />
beauty. Some pharmacists not only disagreed with much of what my<br />
Government was proposing for your industry, they even, as<br />
was their democratic right, did what they could at the March<br />
election to make sure that I ceased being Prime Minister.<br />
And it is revealing no state secret to say that, for the<br />
Government's part, we too were at times exasperated by, and<br />
disagreed with, some of the things the Guild was then<br />
proposing. But tonight, that is behind us. We have, I hope, brought<br />
those, deep divisioins and feelings of bitterness to a full<br />
stop, and c: an open a new chapter in the relationship between<br />
the Pharmacy Guild and the Federal Government.<br />
Indeed, we are entitled to be doubly pleased because the<br />
reconciliation we have reached gives the Government and<br />
pharmacists a sound base on which to build. </p>
<p>2<br />
Tonight, we can look to the future with confidence that we<br />
have achieved a major reform of public policy which will<br />
have enduring benefits for all Australians.<br />
Let me spend some moments putting this achievement in its<br />
full historical perspective.<br />
A hundred years ago it was the physician who was the main<br />
provider of care for the ill.<br />
But with the invention, first, of aspirin in the 1890s,' and<br />
then in succeeding decades of a never-ending range of new<br />
pharmaceuticals, the primary health care role of the<br />
physician has increasingly been shared by the pharmacist.<br />
Today we take for granted that the pharmacist can dispense<br />
medication for a vast, even awe inspiring, range of<br />
conditions diabetes, high blood pressure, cardio-vascular<br />
disease, even cancer.<br />
Families have increasingly looked to pharmacists as a source<br />
of convenient, efficient and reliable advice about the<br />
health of everyone from the unborn and very young to the<br />
very old.<br />
And pharmacists have increasingly brought new skills and<br />
professionalism to the task of meeting those needs.<br />
Of course the growing availability of new medication has<br />
been accompanied by many questions ethical, medical,<br />
economic that demand attention.<br />
No-one, not least governments and medical professionals, can<br />
today ignore the implications of questions such as:<br />
how to ensure the cost-effectiveness of some<br />
treatments; how to achieve the most equitable distribution of<br />
the costs of health care;<br />
how to encourage individuals to take<br />
responsibility for their own health; and<br />
how to strike the right balance between prevention<br />
and cure.<br />
The involvement of the Federal Government as a source of<br />
funding for pharmaceuticals adds a new layer of complexity<br />
to such issues.<br />
The social goal of ensuring the greatest degree of good<br />
health for the greatest numbec of individuals needs to be<br />
weighed in the balance with considerations of equitable<br />
availability and efficient public funding. </p>
<p>In Australia, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has served<br />
us well f or some forty years, providing essential<br />
medications at affordable prices.<br />
Through the Scheme, the Commonwealth has in recent years met<br />
some 70 per cent of the cost of pharmaceuticals used by<br />
Australians. Nine out of every ten pharmaceuticals for which a doctor' s<br />
prescription is required are listed on the Schedule that<br />
underpins 1: he Scheme.<br />
SO it is truly a Scheme for all Australians.<br />
But throughout the 1980s, it became increasingly clear to<br />
Commonwealth Governments that without a major restructuring<br />
the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was in jeopardy.<br />
It had taken almost forty years from 1948 to 1985 for<br />
the costs of the Scheme to reach half a billion dollars.<br />
But it took only another four years for costs to double to<br />
$ 1 billion.. And as the Budget documents this year made<br />
clear, it would have taken only another three years for<br />
those costs to double again, to more than $ 2 billion had<br />
the Federal Government not proceeded with its reform<br />
package. It was, of course, the need to restructure the costs of the<br />
Scheme a need that had been recognised by the Tribunal<br />
that ultimately lay at the root of the divisions between the<br />
Federal Government and the Pharmacy Guild.<br />
It's not my intention tonight to rake over the coals of what<br />
every headline writer in the country came to describe as<br />
" the Chemists' Dispute" or what the placards and leaflets<br />
and shop-front posters described in less flattering terms.<br />
But I do want to emphasise that broader historical context I<br />
have outlined, so that we can see the final outcome in its<br />
true light.<br />
The debate between us was too often cast as a battle of<br />
short-term considerations for pharmacists, the immediate<br />
question of maintaining income and employment levels and for<br />
the Government, on behalf of the taxpayers, the pressing<br />
need for cost containment.<br />
What was really at stake, and what has been genuinely<br />
safeguarded by the package of measures on which we have<br />
agreed, was the viability of pharmaceutical health care<br />
itself and, by extension, the good health and well being<br />
of our fellow Australians.<br />
There are -three principal elements to the package: reforms<br />
to retail pharmacy, initiatives in minimum pricing<br />
arrangements, and substantial changes in patient co-payment<br />
arrangements. </p>
<p>First, in the retail pharmacy area, we have agreed on<br />
changes to the remuneration formula; amalgamation payments<br />
and-employee redundancy payments funded on a 50/ 50 basis; a<br />
temporary freeze on new approvals for pharmacies; and<br />
limited flexibility on the prices of items below the maximum<br />
general patient contribution level in return for proper<br />
information on prices being made available to patients.<br />
Some of these changes are still subject to deliberations of<br />
the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal.<br />
Second, we have shown our determination through minimum<br />
pricing initiatives to protect Australians from the high<br />
cost of necessary pharmaceuticals.<br />
This safeguards one of the great success stories of<br />
Australian health policies, namely the relatively low cost<br />
by international standards of Australian drug prices.<br />
Third, by introducing fees for pensioners' prescriptions and<br />
by increasing the maximum general patient contribution, we<br />
have incorporated genuinely effective price signals into the<br />
Pharmaceuticals Scheme.<br />
Safety nets will protect people, especially the chronically<br />
ill, from open-ended costs and of course we have fully<br />
offset pensioner price increases with a pension increase of<br />
$ 2.50 a week.<br />
But we had been concerned by the mounting evidence<br />
suggesting that some people were using more pharmaceuticals<br />
than was necessary, or even good, for them. Introducing a<br />
small patient contribution encourages people to obtain only<br />
genuinely needed drugs rather than take whatever is on offer<br />
simply because it is free.<br />
So good economics in this case is also good health policy.<br />
My friends<br />
The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is an integral part of<br />
Australia's comprehensive health policy. It does not exist<br />
in a vacuum.<br />
As politicians, as health professionals, as ordinary<br />
Australians, we need to see our individual contributions to<br />
health policy and administration in Australia in its broader<br />
context. Our joint negotiations over the last few months will ensure<br />
Australia takes the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme into the<br />
21st Century as an affactive and vital contribution to the<br />
well being cf our fellow citizens.<br />
I appreciate that it cannot have been easy for the Pharmacy<br />
Guild to convince its members to accept lower receipts on<br />
many prescriptions. </p>
<p>Likewise, you probably understand that it was not easy for<br />
the Government to alienate, however briefly, such a highly<br />
respected profession as Pharmacy particularly in the lead<br />
up to, and during, an election campaign.<br />
On both sides -we have only succeeded because we have kept<br />
our eye on the long-term goal.<br />
I want to pay tribute to those Guild leaders who at<br />
different times throughout the dispute showed their<br />
leadership and their capacity to negotiate fairly and<br />
honestly, abandoning neither the legitimate interests of<br />
their members nor the belief that effective and successful<br />
solutions could be found and in this respect I pay a<br />
particular tribute to you Colin Johns.<br />
It is my hope that these changes can now be implemented with<br />
a spirit cof co-operation between Government and Pharmacy.<br />
The last t: hing we want is to see any of the issues dragged<br />
back in bitterness to the Tribunal.<br />
I believe Government and Pharmacy can return to, and can<br />
improve on, the constructive relationship we enjoyed for<br />
most of the 1980s.<br />
I shall certainly be working towards this end and I look<br />
forward to working with Colin Johns and the Guild.<br />
You probably recall the line from " Yes, Minister" where<br />
Sir Humphrey confides that the surest way of killing off a<br />
policy proposal is to describe it to a politician as<br />
" courageous"<br />
Together we have proved Sir Humphrey wrong.<br />
We took the courageous decision because it was the right<br />
decision.<br />
As a resu: lt, we can each of us tonight declare that we have<br />
achieved reforms of fundamental and lasting value.<br />
That is why, as I said at the outset, it is truly a pleasure<br />
to be here. </p>
