PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 26 JULY 1985<br />
At its meeting today, the Economic Planning Advisory Council<br />
( EPAC) focussed attention on medium to longer-term economic<br />
growth and on its work program for the next 12 months.<br />
The Council considered a paper on Medium to Longer-term<br />
Trends Affecting Australia's Economic Growth, prepared by the<br />
office of EPAC under the direction of a Council Working<br />
Party. The paper, to be released publicly next week, identifies<br />
trends likely to have a significant impact on Australia's<br />
economy and society in the medium to longer term. These<br />
trends are among the sources of the major challenges likely<br />
to confront government over a medium to longer-term horizon.<br />
EPAC had requested the preparation of the paper at its last<br />
meeting as a further step in the process of its development<br />
of a detailed view on medium-term economic policy issues.<br />
This work builds on the statement on medium to longer-term<br />
economic policy agreed by EPAC in March 1984.<br />
Council agreed that the paper should play an important role<br />
in drawing attention to the economic environment Australia<br />
now faces. EPAC saw itself as having a responsibility to<br />
bring economic realities to the attention of the community<br />
generally and to make it clearly understood what our economy<br />
can achieve in the forseeable future. Of particular importance<br />
are: continuation of the high growth rates of the last two<br />
years will be necessary for a significant period of<br />
time to make further inroads into unemployment,<br />
achievement of high growth rates for an extended period<br />
will require concerted efforts, and<br />
the external constraints on our economic potential must<br />
be recognised and domestic policies must be based on a<br />
clear understanding of these constraints.<br />
Council's discussion of the paper on trends affecting<br />
Australia's economic growth crystallised into a consideration<br />
of major issues for attention in the word program for the<br />
remainder of 1985-86. While deferring to its next meeting<br />
finalisation of the details of specific projects for<br />
consideration, EPAC agreed that. two major themes should form </p>
<p>2.<br />
the basis for the papers to be prepared by the Officefor EPAC<br />
meetings during the coming year:<br />
the size of government and its economic impact, and<br />
regeneration of Australian industries.<br />
It was also agreed that the Office would continue to provide<br />
timely indicators of economic performance to assist Council<br />
in monitoring the state of the economy and forming views on<br />
medium-term economic issues. </p>
