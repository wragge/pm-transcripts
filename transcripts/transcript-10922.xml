    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..........................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Jim Jackson, the President of the Gladesville</p>
<p>   RSL Club. To John Watkins, the State Member for Gladesville, to</p>
<p>   Councillor Peter Graham, the Mayor of Ryde, and to all the members</p>
<p>   of the Gladesville RSL Club.</p>
<p>When I first became the Member for Bennelong back in 1974 one of</p>
<p>   the very first community organisations in my electorate that I made</p>
<p>   contact with was the Gladesville RSL Club. And I've retained</p>
<p>   a very affectionate and close association with that club over the</p>
<p>   last 23 to 24 years. It is an outstanding example of the community</p>
<p>   spirit in this part of Sydney and this part of Australia. </p>
<p>It is not only a club that honours the sacrifice and the contribution</p>
<p>   of the men and women of Australia in the wars in which this country</p>
<p>   has been involved this century and, most particularly, by dint of</p>
<p>   the passage of years of World War II and the battles in Korea and</p>
<p>   Vietnam, but it is also an organisation that has put an enormous</p>
<p>   amount into the local community. It is not just a recreation club.</p>
<p>   It is a club that provides comradeship and friendship and a family</p>
<p>   network, in the broader sense of the word, for the people of Gladesville</p>
<p>   and the surrounding areas. And over that 25-year period it has poured</p>
<p>   vast resources into helping young people in the area, into helping</p>
<p>   other organisations into providing welfare support for widows and</p>
<p>   children of returned servicemen and generally providing a local</p>
<p>   community network.</p>
<p>I have found, in my experience, that whenever the Gladesville RSL</p>
<p>   Club has been asked to help a worthwhile local activity, it has</p>
<p>   been only too willing and only too able and only too effective in</p>
<p>   the contribution that it has made. And I've often spoken, in</p>
<p>   recent times, of how the only way that we in Australia can achieve</p>
<p>   what we want to do and the only way in which we can build the kind</p>
<p>   of society we want for the 21st Century is to have a shared endeavour</p>
<p>   between the Government, the community and the individual. Governments</p>
<p>   can't do everything. Community organisations can't do</p>
<p>   everything and individuals can't do everything. We need to</p>
<p>   pool our resources, to share our endeavour and to combine our activities</p>
<p>   to build the kind of Australian society that I know that we all</p>
<p>   want for the 21st Century. And I can't think of an organisation,</p>
<p>   in a general sense, that has done more to blend the great traditions</p>
<p>   of the Australian past with an eye to the future and the kind of</p>
<p>   society we want for the 21st Century than RSL clubs, of which the</p>
<p>   Gladesville RSL Club is an outstanding example.</p>
<p>I cannot, of course, given that I'm declaring open some extension</p>
<p>   of an RSL club and that I'm in the presence of many men and</p>
<p>   women who put their lives on the line to defend Australia, I can't</p>
<p>   let that occasion go by without expressing the hope that, even at</p>
<p>   this eleventh hour, a peaceful settlement in the Gulf dispute will</p>
<p>   be possible.</p>
<p>You are aware that the day before yesterday, on behalf of all Australians</p>
<p>   and with the Leader of the Opposition accompanying me, I farewelled</p>
<p>   the Australian service personnel who are now on the verge of arriving</p>
<p>   in the Gulf. And I wished them well and Godspeed on behalf of all</p>
<p>   Australians. But in saying so, I expressed the fervent hope, which</p>
<p>   I repeat this morning, that a peaceful settlement will be possible</p>
<p>   in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Nobody knows and nobody feels more keenly than those people who</p>
<p>   sore active service in World War II, in particular, of whom there</p>
<p>   are so many here this morning. Those men know better than anybody</p>
<p>   else, better than I do, better than those younger than I and this</p>
<p>   audience do, the sheer horror and the sheer wastefulness of war.</p>
<p>   There is not a man or women amongst us this morning who sees war</p>
<p>   as anything other than dirty, distasteful and always to be avoided</p>
<p>   unless the cost of avoiding it is greater than the cost of being</p>
<p>   involved in it. And that remains the approach of my Government.</p>
<p>We are prepared to join in a military strike if that is necessary.</p>
<p>   But before we take that fateful decision, we want every single avenue</p>
<p>   of diplomacy explored. We want every single opportunity taken to</p>
<p>   enable Saddam Hussein to allow the inspection of those sites where,</p>
<p>   on good grounds, it is believed that weapons of mass destruction</p>
<p>   are stored. This is no idle, indifferent, irrelevant issue for Australia.</p>
<p>   It is something that does threaten the stability of the Middle East</p>
<p>   unless it is properly resolved. And if he is allowed to get away</p>
<p>   with what he is attempting then others will be provoked into doing</p>
<p>   likewise. And the lessons of history are, that if you allow that</p>
<p>   to happen you end up paying a far greater price than the price you</p>
<p>   would have paid if you had taken action in the first place. </p>
<p>And that is the basis of the decision that has been taken by my</p>
<p>   Government. I believe it is a decision which has very strong support</p>
<p>   in the Australian community. And I acknowledge the support that</p>
<p>   has been given to it by Mr Beazley on behalf of the Australian Labor</p>
<p>   Party. Because when Australian troops go abroad, they should go</p>
<p>   abroad not against the background of political disputation, but</p>
<p>   against the background of having the support and understanding of</p>
<p>   all of the Australian people.</p>
<p>I hope it won't be necessary for them to go into active service.</p>
<p>   I know that if it does become necessary, they will perform in the</p>
<p>   finest traditions of the Australian Defence Forces, just as the</p>
<p>   men and women here this morning, many of whom are members of the</p>
<p>   Gladesville RSL Club, performed when their time came in the finest</p>
<p>   traditions of the Australian Defence Forces.</p>
<p>Moving from that rather more serious and sombre note, can I say</p>
<p>   to you Jim, once again, it's a delight to be your guest. Jim</p>
<p>   is an ornament, as President of the RSL Club here, to the local</p>
<p>   community in Gladesville. I understand you've invested about</p>
<p>   $3.5 million in these extensions. It will provide marvellous new</p>
<p>   facilities to your members and guests. It will continue to provide</p>
<p>   a great focus of community activity. And I look forward to visiting</p>
<p>   it again in the near future.</p>
<p>I think I'll have to tell you this morning that it's</p>
<p>   probable that I won't be in my electorate on Anzac Day. At</p>
<p>   this stage it is my intention to pay a very quick visit to Hellfire</p>
<p>   Pass - the opening of the great memorial in Hellfire Pass - on the</p>
<p>   site of the Burma-Thailand Railway on Anzac Day this year and on</p>
<p>   behalf of the Australian Government and the Australian people, honour</p>
<p>   those men of Australia who died in those terrible circumstances</p>
<p>   in World War II as prisoners of war of the Japanese. And I hope</p>
<p>   that that ceremony will bring home to younger generations in Australia</p>
<p>   again the huge debt that they owe, that we all owe, to the men who</p>
<p>   laid down their lives in those tragic circumstances. And also it</p>
<p>   will be a fitting momument to the links that were forged after World</p>
<p>   War II between Australia and the nations of Asia. And it will be</p>
<p>   a reminder of the exultation of men like Weary Dunlop who said that</p>
<p>   always remembering the past tragedies, we should look to the future</p>
<p>   and we should build links between Australia and the nations of Asia.</p>
<p>   So if I'm not here on Anzac Day, Jim, you will understand that</p>
<p>   I'm not swinging the lead, that I will, in fact, be doing precisely</p>
<p>   that.</p>
<p>But may I say again, thank you ladies and gentlemen of the Gladesville</p>
<p>   RSL Club for having me here this mornming. To you, Jim, in particular,</p>
<p>   thank you for your courtesy and hospitality. I declare the extentions</p>
<p>   open and I wish good fortune, good happiness and plenty of chit</p>
<p>   chat and social exchanges between your members years into the future.</p>
<p>   Thank you very much.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
