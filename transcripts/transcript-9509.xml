J4 KEATING, MP<br />
In a worid which is changing at extaordinary speed, the central fact of our age is<br />
Interdependence,-from the giobalisation of the world economy to the Informaton<br />
revolution, our prosperity and se= urty are now linked Inextricably,<br />
We Australians know that our future depends on equitable and sustainable<br />
development In the rest of the world,<br />
And we know that such development depends In part an flows of development<br />
assistance from t rich to the poof 4untriles, partly on opening up the world's<br />
markets to trade and Investment and partly on the efforts of each individual<br />
country to support its own social and economic development,<br />
No nation's experience Is likely to be directly transferable to another's needs, but! I<br />
think Australia's experience has some relevance to our concerns at this<br />
conference. I certainly do not pretend that Australia has solved its problems, but<br />
we have made progress in developing a social democratic society where equity<br />
and egalitarianism are integral elements of economic and social policy-making.<br />
We believe that our experience of the lost decade furnishes unmistakeable proof<br />
that the pursuit of equity within and between nations is not an option but a<br />
necessity; that greater equity and productivity are not opposed but<br />
complementary; and that the best means of delivering both Is to empower people<br />
and communities with the means to swlve their own problems, Somnetmes the<br />
social task is more to steer than to row.<br />
The first principle of Australian government policy Is inclusion, We believe that<br />
our country's success Is best measured and best achieved by policies which<br />
enable -oll to share in the bounty of the nation.<br />
And we believe that the starting point Is economic growth which is the means to<br />
creating a bounty big enough to share, Economic growth not ortly enlarges the<br />
bounty, it creates employment which Is by far the most effective means of<br />
distributIng wealth and opportunity. </p>
<p>S" EL: 13 . Mar. 95 10: 44 No. 009 P .02/ 04<br />
Employment is the principal means by which developed and developing countries<br />
can share the bounty and alleviate poverty.<br />
Employment requires economic growth and education. In the moder world, In<br />
both developed and developing countries, education is more than ever the great<br />
liberating force. Equal access to education is therefore an essential foundation of<br />
opportunity. These have been the primary goals of the Australian government for a decade:<br />
an inclusive philosophy made concrete by economic growth and strength,<br />
employment growth, and greater access and equity in education.<br />
Just as we know that social development and social justice are crucial to national<br />
progress and well-being, we also know there is a two-way relationship between<br />
economic efficiency and social justice. In the words of Arthur Okun: " Isocial<br />
justice and markets) need each other, to put some rationality into equality and<br />
some humanity Into efficiency."<br />
In other words, we need cool heads and warm hearts.<br />
The international trend towards the globalisation of economic activity is both<br />
dazzling and demanding. Through both competition and cooperation between<br />
nations It will promote efficiency and create wealth.<br />
Yet we will fail every test of our maturity if, as we make economic progress,<br />
because of their gender, race, cultural background or any other reason beyond<br />
their Influence, large numbers of people are left behind.<br />
Governments used to think it possible to pretend that economic growth alone<br />
would eventually sort out our social problems. But it was never a genuine option.<br />
For example, we know that economic growth alone will not get jobs for the longterm<br />
unemployed new jobs tend to go to new entrants to the labour force and<br />
the longer people are unemployed the less " employable" they become.<br />
There is more than a human dimension to this, and more than a social dimension:<br />
it is an economic folly. Unemployment is a waste of talent and energy. What is<br />
more, the greater productivity and more flexible labour market which flows from<br />
getting people back into work leads to lower Inflation and increases the speed at<br />
which the economy can safely grow.<br />
We cannot disown responsibility for the unemployed; but any honest assessment<br />
will tell us just as emphatically that the days when setting up another government<br />
bureaucracy could be offered as the answer to every social need have also<br />
passed. We are all familiar with inefficient government services and their lack of<br />
responsiveness to individual needs. </p>

passed. We are all familiar with inefficient government services and their lack of<br />
responsiveness to Individual needs.<br />
Last year, in a comprehensive Government White Paper on Employment, we<br />
introduced a Job Compact a scheme by which the longer term unemployed are<br />
offered appropriate training or assisted to find employment through short term<br />
wage subsidies. Two basic notions underly the Compact: the obligation of society<br />
to help the most disadvantaged, and the obligation of the disadvantaged to take<br />
up this assistance or lose their entitlement to income support,<br />
Our aim is not punish or coerce but to encourage and empower.<br />
It Is a valuable lesson of the past decade that governments alone are not<br />
responsible for delivering desirable social outcomes. We work in partnership with<br />
many people: community groups, business, unions and individuals. This<br />
approach engages more people in finding solutions to social problems, It delivers<br />
services which are tailored to individual needs, and it is an antidote to the<br />
unproductive relationship between bureaucracy and " victim".<br />
Many Aboriginal Australians live in communities whose unconscionable standards<br />
of health have long defied the efforts of governments to improve them. It is a<br />
situation we must change. We have begun by giving indigenous Australians that<br />
which will most empower them legalrecognition of their prior title to the land,<br />
and a Land Fund as the means by which they may get land back.<br />
Following the same principle, that we must give people the means and incentives<br />
which will help them solve their own problems, we are determined that the next<br />
step the delivery of adequate health and education will this time be effective.<br />
Just as transfer payments are necessary within nations, they are necessary<br />
between them. As far as possible, Australia provides aid according to the same<br />
principles which inform the provision of our social services: I mean we design<br />
them for effect, especially the effect of breaking the cycle of poverty.<br />
unemployment and marginalisation.<br />
To give just one example, our $ 130 million population policy will expand the range<br />
of choices available to women by giving families the ability to decide the number<br />
and spacing of their children.<br />
Improving the education, health, living and working conditions of women is not<br />
only a humanitarian ambition, it is essential for economic and social progress.<br />
We know the benefits of development will not flow to women automatically, so<br />
our assistance programs address their needs directly.<br />
One area where Australia's efforts are particularly concentrated is the South<br />
Pacific. </p>
<p>Tn, i . Mar. 9b 10: 44 No. 00

The 22 island countries of the South Pacific comprise only 0.1 per cent of the<br />
world's population. They are among the world's smallest and most vulnerable<br />
societies vulnerable to limited resources and fragile eco-systems, to population<br />
pressures and global warming<br />
But these countries have proud cultures and robust social systems.<br />
They are working together in the South Pacific Forum to strengthen their capacity<br />
to manage their limited resources effectively and sustainably.<br />
Some of them are represented here in Copenhagen where they will tell their<br />
stories for themselves.<br />
But they cannot succeed alone and in this meeting I want to add Australia's voice<br />
to theirs. As Chair of the South Pacific Forum this year, I want to ensure that<br />
their interests and the interests of the world's other small island states are not<br />
forgotten. Let me conclude on the theme with which I began. Social progress depends on<br />
economic growth. It depends in part on access to markets. Nowhere in the world<br />
has this been more obviously the case than with our neighbours in the Asia<br />
Pacific. That is one good reason why we have worked so hard to secure a good<br />
outcome in the Uruguay Round of the GATT, and why we have been promoting<br />
APEC. The GATT outcome is by far the most tangible and effective step to be taken in<br />
recent times toward international equality of opportunity. APEC represents a step<br />
of comparable dimensions for our region: by moving towards a community of the<br />
most developed and developing countries it is turning the so called North-South<br />
dialogue into a functional reality.<br />
Ift. here is one general comment we would make at this Summit, it is that<br />
governments must strive for economic growth. Not to do so is to deny their own<br />
citizens jobs and security and to deny the citizens of other, poorer countries the<br />
opportunities they deserve. Most certainly it is to deny the ambitions of this<br />
Summit. This will be called an historic meeting because of the number of heads of state<br />
and heads of government who have met to endorse the declaration: but history<br />
won't judge it an important meeting if, afterwards, governments squander their<br />
resources and do not treat their people well.<br />
