PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING MP<br />
AUSTRALIA AWARD FOR URBAN DESIGN<br />
I am pleased to announce today the detailed conditions of entry for the<br />
Australia Award for Urban Design and at the same time to invite nominations<br />
for the 1995 award.<br />
The award is a prestigious addition to the national awards system for urban<br />
design. It will recognise multi disciplinary urban design excellence which<br />
brings long-term benefits.<br />
Entries for the award will need to show clearly how they are making life better<br />
for Australians. The gains will need to be in the three key areas of social,<br />
environmental and economic well-being.<br />
Outstanding achievement will be measured against a range of criteria.<br />
Categories include design excellence, community function and benefit,<br />
ehnvironmental health, social equity, relevance to today's lifestyle ( including<br />
the ability to adapt to changing lifestyle needs), innovationi and application to<br />
other sites.-<br />
The establishment of the award follows the 18-month review of urban design<br />
carried out by the Government's Urban Design Task Force. It is the<br />
first-stage of the Government's response to the Task Force Report, which is<br />
being co-ordinated by the Minister for Housing anid Regional Development,<br />
the Hon Brian Howe MP.<br />
The annual award will alternate between two types of urban design initiative.<br />
In 1995 it will be for projects which have already created a built environment<br />
which people can visit. Nominations close on Tuesday, 29 August 1995 and<br />
the award will be presented in November 1995.<br />
In 1996 the award will be for ideas which significantly influence the built<br />
environment. The ' idea' might be a project which is at detailed planning<br />
stage and is likely to become a physical reality. It might be a piece of<br />
innovative legislation which will have far-reaching impact on urban design. It </p>
<p>might also be a design project which, through promotion that occurs because<br />
of the Australia Award for Urban Design, has a significant impact on urban<br />
design elsewhere in Australia even though the project itself does not come to<br />
fruition. The award will make a major contribution to design excellence in Australia by<br />
recognising urban design in the broadest sense.<br />
Judging will be by a panel of eminent jurors which will make<br />
recommendations to the Government. The 1995 jury will be announced<br />
shortly. The award is the urban design equivalent of the Australia Prize, the national<br />
science award introduced in the mid-1980s by the Government and now an<br />
internationally recognised award.<br />
The Australia Award for Urban Design will be a perpetual trophy which will be<br />
unveiled at the 1995 presentation. In addition to the trophy, there will be a<br />
range of promotional activities linked to the award, to encourage debate<br />
within the professions and the community about the contribution which urban<br />
design excellence can make to Australia's heritage.<br />
