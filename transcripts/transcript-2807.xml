PRIME iMIIITSER PIXS SiTATE'lIIT 1N0. 49<br />
31 January 1973<br />
AUSTRALIAH ECOGIIITIOI OF CHIITA<br />
At the Australian Institute of Political Science summer<br />
school in Canberra last weekend, two former iinisters for Foreign<br />
Affairs, iMr. Bowen and IMr. Bury, referred to allegations made in<br />
recent newspaper articles that Australia had accepted 23 conditions<br />
imposed by the People's Zepublic of China as the price of securing<br />
recognition by Australia. These articles suggested that Australia<br />
had to " toe the Peking Line" and agree to conditions for<br />
recognition more stringent than those accepted by states such<br />
as Chad and the iialdives.<br />
In view of the currency given to these suggestions by<br />
ministers in the previous G overnment, I think it is important<br />
that I set the record straight. The reports mentioned by Mr.<br />
Bowen and Mr. Bury are totally fanciful. The facts are as I<br />
announced on 22 December, that a satisfactory agreement on the<br />
establishment of diplomatic relations was reached with China.<br />
I also published the joint communique and the exchange of letters<br />
between myself and Premier Chou En-lai.<br />
It is nonsense to suggest that we have been discriminated<br />
against by the Chinese and forced to accept a variety of preconditions.<br />
The negotiations in Paris covered only questions<br />
relating to the recognition of China and the status of Taiwan.<br />
There was no secret agreement or understanding on other matters.<br />
The wrording of the published joint communique in which<br />
we acknowledge the position of the Chinese Government that Taiwan<br />
is a province of China is very similar in its wording to the<br />
Canadian and British formulas. The Maldives formula, which has<br />
been described as softer than ours was, in fact, harder, as the<br />
Maldives " recognised" Taiwan as an " inalienable part of the<br />
territory of the People's Republic".<br />
