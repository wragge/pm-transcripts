" TAK TO '. Tii T<br />
BY THE, PRj? LTI. . T. R EIT HO R. oGJ. N Z]: TZE<br />
Ladies and gentlcmcn, On this occasion I am going to talk to you for little<br />
under a quarter of an hour about some aspects of our trade problem.<br />
I won't be able to say very much about any part of it, but I hope<br />
I can give you a reasonably clear survey, and so I want to start<br />
with this map of E-ope, which contains the area which we call the<br />
Common Market. This comprises the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg,<br />
France, 7, est Germany and Italy,<br />
These six nations back in 1957, made a treaty, The Treaty<br />
of Rome, and tha' was a treaty which was designed to set up an area<br />
of economic cc-operation in Europe, The main features of this<br />
were, that irstead of having six countries, each with its own tariff<br />
barriers against the others, the Six should, over a reasonably<br />
short period of time, have a common tariff against the rest of the<br />
world and, internally, free trade, which means of course, that<br />
goods from France could pass into Germany within a few years free<br />
of duty. But both France and Germany for example, would have,<br />
as against the rest of the world, a cormmon tariff barrier,<br />
There are many other aspects of it. It is a tremendously<br />
important agreement. It has very big political implications.<br />
It is going to have, I think, considerable effect on working<br />
conditions, on economic policy, on financial policy. But time<br />
will not perinit me to go into those details, I ask you however,<br />
to take it from me that this European Common Market is, in itself,<br />
one of the great economic developments of this century, and it<br />
has become of particular importance to us, because Great Britain<br />
is now seeking to enter the Common Market and other Nations no<br />
doubt will follow suit. This means that Great Britain is seeking<br />
to become one of the nations now called The Six,<br />
Now why does this concern us? -ell, the answer is<br />
that the whole pattern of Australian trade for many years has been<br />
based on Commonwealth preferential trade. In other words, we<br />
get a number of our commodities like wheat, butter and dried fruits<br />
and so on, into Great Britain free of duty, while similar goods<br />
from other countries pay duty, That gives us a preference.<br />
And in the came way British goods, chiefly manufactured goods,<br />
passing into Australia, have come in under the British pref'erential<br />
tarifff Now this mutual preferential system in the Commonwealth<br />
has, I think been, from our point of view economically, the<br />
outstanding thing of this century.<br />
Now we have to consider how you reconcile the one<br />
with the other. How does Great Britain become a meber of a<br />
Free Trade area, and at the same time preserve the substance of,<br />
for example, Australian trade with Great Britain' 9 You see the<br />
great imnportance of it.<br />
There is a little cou': ntry up here, Denmark, which is<br />
not yet a member of The Six, but I should think certainly will be,<br />
And Denmark produces a great deal of butter and dairy products<br />
generally. Today there is a duty against them, but Australian </p>
<p>goods of the same kind go in free and also New Zealand goods<br />
and it is very, very important for New Zealand go in free,<br />
If Great Britain went into the Co. Anon Market<br />
unconditionally just signed on the dotted line, and I don't<br />
think for one moment she is going to do that the position would<br />
be that our preferences would disappear, because she would have<br />
to be inside the common tariff barrier herself. Our preferential<br />
system would be converted into a free trade preference from<br />
European countries, so that French wheat would go into England<br />
free of duty, and our wheat would pay duty. You can see exactly<br />
how tremendously important this is.<br />
Niw we are in the closest negotiations with Great<br />
Britain. We have put ourselves in close contact with the<br />
countries of The Six, because we want her to be able to negotiate<br />
terms and conditions for going into the European Common Market,<br />
which will well how shall I put it? inflict the minimum of<br />
harm on our trade, and, in particular, enable particular industries<br />
in Australia which practically live on the British market, such<br />
as dried fruits, to continue in existence, This we regard as a<br />
great battle. We believe that you would want to have it<br />
conducted on your behalf by people of great experience and of<br />
some standing with the administering authorities in Great Britain,<br />
and indeed with the leaders of these European countries.<br />
Well the negotiations have only just begun. We have<br />
done an immense amount of work in London, in Europe, and in<br />
Australia and are continuing to do it. And you may take it that<br />
we will regard it as our great responsibility to the export<br />
industries of Australia to see that when the day comes that the<br />
United Kingdom has concluded its negotiations, those negotiations<br />
will have resulted in some special provisions for Coimnonwealth<br />
trade which would be rather different froim the ones now existing<br />
between the countries of The Six. I need not go into detail on<br />
that matter, because you can see how tremendously difficult it is.<br />
It is very complex. The negotiations will take a long time,<br />
because there are scores and scores of individual items which<br />
will have to be taken into account,<br />
Recently, when Great Britain announced that she was<br />
going into these negotiations, and that they would involve<br />
agricultural products, it was something new from our point of<br />
view. Comments were made in Parliament and elsewhere that we<br />
should have anticipated this, and that we are starting off on the<br />
business of building up our trade with the rest of the world too<br />
late. Now it is very important that we should build up our<br />
trade with the rest of the world. It is not likely that we<br />
will come out of these discussions one hundred per cent as well<br />
off as we are under the existing system, I think that would<br />
be putting it a little high, optimistic as I am0 And therefore<br />
it is of tremendous importance for us as a great trading nation,<br />
to see that we are developing our trade all round the world, and<br />
I am going to proceed to this other map in order to tell you<br />
quite briefly how much we have done about that matter in the last<br />
ten years, and in particular during the last five years, since<br />
the Department of Trade was established for this very pu: rpose.<br />
If you will look at tha. t map you will see that there<br />
are certain countries marked, United Kingdom, Belgium, West<br />
Germany, France, Italy, Tr~ n, India, Japan, Indonesia, New Zealand, </p>
<p>3.<br />
. the United States and Canada. These are the twelve countries<br />
with whom we do the bulk of our overseas trade. Or to be more<br />
accurate, these are the twelve countries which are our biggest<br />
partners in trade, in and out. But in addition to that, we set<br />
out some time ago, years ago, to develop our Trade Connissioner<br />
Service so that we would encourage trade and not only with those<br />
countries, but elsewhere. And on this map you will see marked<br />
places like Stockholm and Bonn, London of course, and Paris and<br />
Rome; courtries in Africa fromL Cairo through Nairobi, Salisbury<br />
down to Johannesburg, across to Accra in Ghana; Beirut, Karachi,<br />
Bombay, New Delhi, Calcutta, Colombo, Bangkok, up to Tokyo,<br />
Hongkong, Manila, Kuala Lumpur in Malaya, Singapore, Djakarta<br />
and of course New Zealand; and over here in Canada, Vancouver,<br />
Ottawa and Montreal; and in the United States, San Francisco,<br />
Chicago, New York, Washington; and in South America, comparatively<br />
recently, Trinidad and Lima.<br />
Now this is a very great establishment of Trade<br />
Commissioners and as you probably know the work done by the Trade<br />
Commissioner Service is in forwarding trade, in promoting trgde<br />
missions, sometimes trad, ships, special surveys conducted by<br />
organised groups of business men and this work is tremendously<br />
important. I think that we can say confidently, that so far<br />
from neglecting the business of building up our trade, wherever<br />
we can get trade around the world, we have been remarkably active<br />
in that field. '. NIe now have far more Trade Commissioner posts<br />
than ever existed before in Australian history.<br />
In order to encourage exports from Australia, in 1956<br />
we established a special Insurance Corporation to insure people<br />
in relation to connercial transactions in which there were certain<br />
risks of a non-commuercial kind. This is a scheme which has been<br />
adopted in Great Britain, and which operates in Canada and which<br />
has gone remarkably well. It is a scheme which has been referred<br />
to, approached by exporters, including manufacturing exporters,<br />
so far that it has already insured transactions into 120 different<br />
countries in the viorld. That is, I think you will agree, a<br />
remarkable thing, and because we attach tremendous . importance to<br />
developing an export of manufactured and processed goods, we<br />
introduced only 18 months ago but before this Common Market<br />
crisis developed a system of special tax concessions in relation<br />
to export goods which I believe is very well received by the<br />
vastly important manufacturing industry of Australia. It arose<br />
in fact out of consultations that we had with eminent men in<br />
that field. Now all that adds up to this. We are out for business.<br />
Ic believe that we can do business more and more, and we will do<br />
it of course, more and more if we have a stable Government with<br />
experienced people to do the negotiations, with the good will<br />
of the rest of the world, and with a high credit standing i the<br />
rest of the world.<br />
That is a very short summary. A very imperfect<br />
summary of the most complex problem we have to deal with in the<br />
course of the next twelve months. We will deal with it, with<br />
your authority; we will put all our enthusiasm into it, because<br />
we believe that in all these discussions we are battling for the<br />
true interests of what we believe to be a wonderful country, and<br />
above that the most promising country to be found in the Free<br />
World. </p>
