MESSAGES FROM THE PRIME MINISTERS OF AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN ON<br />
THE OCCASION OF THE RATIFICATION OF THE BASIC TREATY OF<br />
FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION<br />
MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO MR FUKUDA<br />
On the occasion of the exchange of instruments of ratification<br />
of the Basic Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between<br />
Australia and Japan, I have great pleasure in renewing to you<br />
the best wishes of the Government and people of Australia.<br />
The Treaty formally recognises the successes of the past in our<br />
bilateral relations. It recognises the importance of our<br />
commercial ties and our mutual interest in being reliable<br />
suppliers to and market for each other.<br />
The Treaty does not, however, dwell only on the past.<br />
As I said at the time of signature, it contains within it<br />
firm commitments by both our countries to broadening our relations<br />
beyond the purely commercial, to scientific, cultural, education<br />
and other fields. I am confident that our peoples will actively<br />
pursue this deepening of our mutual awareness and understanding.<br />

<p>MESSAGE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN TO MR FRASER<br />
On this auspicious occasion of the exchange of instruments<br />
of ratification of the Basic Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation<br />
between Japan and Australia, I take great pleasure in expressing<br />
my profound gratification on behalf of the Government and people<br />
of Japan.<br />
For the last quarter of a century, the mutual complementality<br />
of our two economies has drawn us so close to each other, and<br />
we have grown into indispensable trading partners.<br />
At the same time, the need has recently been keenly felt in<br />
both countries to diversify and broaden mutual contacts and to<br />
develop our relations not only in trade and economy but also<br />
in various other fields. Sincere efforts have beenput forth at<br />
both government and private levels to sustain effective<br />
channels of dialogue and to enhance mutual understanding<br />
between our two peoples.<br />
No doubt the Basic Treaty is wrought out along this line of<br />
thinking. The Treaty is designed as an instrument for cooperation<br />
in consolidating and perpetuating such friendly relations already<br />
existing between our two nations and I am convinced of the<br />
distinctive significance of this instrument.<br />
The foundation for such cooperation has just been laid,<br />
and what matters now is to put the letter and the spirit of<br />
the Treaty into effect for many years to come. Its purpose<br />
will be best served not only by its careful observance but<br />
also by mutual trust and concession in its application by<br />
both parties.<br />
I am certain that the conclusion of this Treaty will add a<br />
new page in the history of Japan-Australia relations. </p>
