Press Statement No. 583<br />
28 October 1975<br />
THE RANGER URANIUM PROJECT IN THE NORTHERN TERRITORY<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam; the Managing Director<br />
of Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Ltd., Mr Mackay;<br />
and the Chairman of Peko Mines Ltd., Mr Proud signed this<br />
afternoon a Memorandum of Understanding between the<br />
Government and the Companies for the development and mining<br />
of uranium ore deposits in the Ranger area in the Northern<br />
Territory and for the production and sale of uranium<br />
concentrate from that ore.<br />
This Memorandum represents an elaboration of the<br />
Agreement Previously signed by the Ministers ana representatives<br />
of the Companies on 30 October 1974.<br />
The completion of this Memorandum of Understanding<br />
will now facilitate the early preparation of formal agreements<br />
in relation to this Venture. It is understood by the Parties,<br />
however, that these agreements will not become effective<br />
until Australia has affirmed them following consideration of:<br />
the Report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental<br />
Inquiry ( Hearings by this Inquiry commenced on<br />
9 September 1975 with Mr Justice Fox as<br />
presiding Commissioner.);<br />
the outcome of any claims by Aboriginals in respect<br />
of land within the Ranger area ( in conformity with<br />
the procedures to be required by the Aboriginal<br />
Land ( Northern Territory) Bill 1975 now before<br />
the Parliament).<br />
The discussions which have led to the signing of the<br />
Memorandum of Understanding this afternoon confirms the<br />
confidence of the Government and Peko and EZ in this major<br />
Australian mining enterprise. The Government believes that<br />
the'Ranger Project can be a major export earner and it will<br />
be working with Peko and EZ to bring this fully Australian<br />
mining project to fruition. Nevertheless, it is essential<br />
before the project can proceed, that the Government receive<br />
the Report of the Environmental Inquiry and take whatever<br />
steps it may then judge necessary in the light of the findings<br />
and recommendations of that Inquiry.<br />
