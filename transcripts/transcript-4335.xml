PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 28 FEBRUARY 1977<br />
ADDRESS TO ST. MARK'S LUTHERAN CHILD CARE CENTRE, MT. GRAkVATT, BRISBANE<br />
Thank you for inviting me here today to take part in what I<br />
consider to be a very important occasion. The Commnonwealth<br />
Government has given great emphasis to the need for adequate child<br />
care services. As you have given me this opportunity. let me tell<br />
you the reasons for the Government adopting this policy, and just<br />
what this policy means.<br />
We have know for some time about the need in the area of child<br />
care. It was a Liberal-National Country Party Government that<br />
first introduced, in 1972, an Act that provided for the<br />
development of child care centres. The Child Care Act. In<br />
1969 a survey was conducted which showed that although some<br />
271,000 preschool aged children were the off-spring of working<br />
mothers, there were only 555 child care centres in Australia able<br />
to provide full day care for about 14,000 children. Only 40 of<br />
these centres catering for only 2,000 children received any<br />
form of government assistance from state or -local authorities.<br />
Less than 10 percent of the pre-school children of working mothers<br />
were in recognised child care centres.<br />
Five years later, in 1974, the situation was not much irrproved.<br />
of the 375,000 children under five years of age, whose responsible<br />
parents were in the. workforce, only 38,700 were cared for in<br />
recognised centres that is, just over 10 percent.<br />
It was estimated that one out of eight school aged children whose<br />
responsible parents were in the work force had no super-vision<br />
for several hours during the day, before school opened, and after<br />
it was finished.<br />
I emphasise that in spite of the fact that increasing amounts<br />
of government funds were directed to children's services by the<br />
previous government, very little of this money went to help the<br />
people who need it most -the people whom those fJ-' ures I have'<br />
just. mentioned represent -the migrant families, the single<br />
parents, families on low incomes. Their children were being<br />
deprived of basic, adequate care, because the services just did<br />
not exist to help them. Even where facilities did exist, they were<br />
oftEn far too expensive for the people who needed them most. / 2 </p>
<p>It is now apparent and it should have been apparent then<br />
that the limited resources available should have been channelled<br />
through assisting these families. And above all, to assisting<br />
these children many of whom have been seriously deprived through<br />
no fault of their own or of their parents' in the early formative<br />
years of their life. It is for this reason that the Commonwealth<br />
Government decided to give greater emphasis to the provisions<br />
of child care services for families in need. Some people, however,<br />
still believe that the provision of facilities such as St. Mark's<br />
Lutheran Child Care Centre will encourage parents mothers in<br />
particular to shirk their own responsibilities.<br />
I believe the situation is a good deal more complicated than that.<br />
The fact is that today there are more two income families<br />
in Australia than sinqle income families. Further, in Queensland<br />
a recent survey sho~ s that women comprise one third of the<br />
Queensland labour force and that six out of ten of these women<br />
are married. This is a demographic trend that Governments even<br />
if they wanted to, could do little to reverse.<br />
We have'-the situation that more women are marrying and have<br />
occutDations outside the home. Girls as well as boys are spending<br />
more time in full time education. And many adult women<br />
are re-entering tertiary institutions, or entering them for the<br />
first time.<br />
There are also today, a growing number of single parent families.<br />
Families headed by a single woman or man constitute almost<br />
one tenth of the number of families in Australia.' I am especially<br />
pleased to perform this ceremony today because the Liberal-<br />
National Country Party Government's social welfare programmes<br />
places great emphasis on cooperative effort by community groups.<br />
It is the Government's belief that only by positive action<br />
between groups like yourselves, with the assistance of government,<br />
but without the hindrance of undue government interference, can an<br />
effective approach to the whole question of social welfare be<br />
achieved.<br />
Only if groups such as yourselves define and commnunicate their needs<br />
can the Commonwealth Government be fully responsive to those<br />
needs. My Government is committed to encouraging the kind of<br />
self-help evidenced and indeed exemplified by this Centre.<br />
I understand that there are plans to p,-roviece within this complex<br />
an aged person's hcffe and a youth hostel. This is a progressive<br />
step and it is obvious that all groups will benefit greatly from one<br />
another's presence and their contact with one another.<br />
It gives me very great pleasure to declare the St. Mark's<br />
Lutheran Child Care Centre officially open.<br />
