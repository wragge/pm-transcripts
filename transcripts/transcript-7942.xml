PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PANEL INTERVIEW WITH STEWART CRANNEY, RADIO<br />
2MMM, SYDNEY, 7 MARCH 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
CRANNEY: This morning, in the run up to the election, we're<br />
joined by a panel of experts in their field Greg Sheridan<br />
from the Australian, Peter Garrett, President of the ACF, Dr<br />
Kate Short from the Total Environment Centre,<br />
Financial Correspondent Peter Switzer, from Rolling Stone<br />
and The Age newspaper Sean Carney, our Canberra Bureau<br />
Political Chief John Hewitt and MMN's News Director David<br />
White. And of course, Bob Hawke.<br />
Now down to business. Prime Minister, thank you for joining<br />
us this morning.<br />
PM: My pleasure, Stewart.<br />
CRANNEY: I'll go straight to Greg Sheridan of the<br />
Australian for our first question.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, I've never seen an election in<br />
which the people are so uninterested, so disillusioned, so<br />
cynical. You've acknowledged that cynicism. Do you accept<br />
any responsibility for the degree of cynicism in this<br />
election and what do you think has caused this cynicism?<br />
PM: Well I think the cynicism and lack of interest is<br />
somewhat overstated though, but I do accept, as I've said<br />
quite clearly from some months back that in Australia, as in<br />
the rest of the world, there are non traditional political<br />
issues which have arisen which have become much more the<br />
preserve of parties outside the mainstream. And I, of<br />
course, refer basically to environmental issues and that's<br />
not something that I worry about. I think it's something<br />
which should be welcomed. I mean, the fact that people,<br />
particularly young people here and around the world see this<br />
as an issue which is, in a sense, their preserve and as much<br />
theirs as that of the politicians is something that we<br />
should welcome.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, one of the things that can make<br />
people cynical is when a political leader squibs a hard<br />
choice. You and your Government have championed a non<br />
discriminatory immigration policy, you've also championed a<br />
large immigration program 140,000 this year. Increasingly </p>
<p>the environmentalist movement opposes a big population for<br />
Australia and that means opposing a big immigration program.<br />
Do you commit your Government to maintaining the 140,000<br />
immigration intake or will you give in to the green movement<br />
and lower the immigration intake?<br />
PM: Yes, I do commit to that. Now I think the relationship<br />
between myself and my Government and the environmental<br />
movement is an interesting one and certainly neither they<br />
nor we would say it is one of total identity, nor should it<br />
be. They wouldn't want it that way and I certainly wouldn't<br />
want it that way. And on this area let me say I don't think<br />
the environment movement is monolithic I'm sure it's not<br />
because I've spoken to people within it who don't share that<br />
view. Now, let me make what I think are the two basic<br />
points. Firstly, there is no doubt that if you look at this<br />
issue globally the population explosion is an environmental<br />
problem. No doubt about that. We, the world's population<br />
is just going up and up and up at a rate which is going to<br />
pose for the globe horrendous sorts of problems. I mean, I<br />
just was in India last year and the population increase each<br />
year is the same as Australia's total population about 17<br />
million. Now that's one thing and I think as a world we<br />
should be concerned about it, but that doesn't mean that we<br />
here with 17 million people have got to be totally worried<br />
about increasing ours. I think that Australia would be<br />
better of f with a larger population and you've got to<br />
balance your economic capacity to absorb with a desirable<br />
to your population. So my answer to your question is,<br />
globally I think population explosion is a problem, as far<br />
as Australia is concerned I think the 140,000 target we've<br />
got is about right.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, on another topic, yesterday I had<br />
the joy of reading through the policies of the Australian<br />
Democrats in detail and they're a remarkably extravagant and<br />
uncosted collection of policies. Does your dependence on<br />
Democrat preferences and the same for the Liberal Party mean<br />
that perhaps you've been a bit soft on the Democrats in<br />
taking them to task on their, on their actual policies?<br />
PM: Well, I think if you test us in the period when we're<br />
actually in Government rather than at election time and how<br />
we deal with them and we put it right up to the Democrats<br />
where our legislation is there, and it's legislation which<br />
always is framed in terms of a compatibility of what's<br />
desirable and economically achievable. I mean, if their<br />
particular lines and attitudes initially are shaped by what<br />
is cuckooland approach on some issues, we tell them so<br />
and we organise that they should in the end support us. Now<br />
we don't always get their support, but we have proved in a<br />
period of seven years that where it basically matters we can<br />
get them.<br />
QUESTION: Would you agree with Senator Walsh's description<br />
of the Democrats as the fairies at the bottom of the garden? </p>
<p>PM: That's Peter Walsh's explanation and it may be valid<br />
for some of them but I don't think it's, as a generic term,<br />
it's totally fair in that I think that there are some<br />
Democrats who are genuine about wanting to see another way.<br />
The thing which is frustrating about the Democrats and let<br />
me be quite straightforward is that having no<br />
responsibility in the end, not being governments or<br />
potential governments, they are able to cap the sail of the<br />
wind as it were and say, yes, that looks as though it's the<br />
most acceptable position, let's embrace it. Now that's OK<br />
if you're not having to form the hard decisions in<br />
Government, but it's not a luxury which is open to<br />
Government. QUESTION: Prime Minister, a foreign policy question.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
QUESTION: You placed a good deal of emphasis on our<br />
O relationship with China. What did the events of Tienanmen<br />
mean for Australia's emerging relationship with this region<br />
of the world and with China?<br />
PM: Good question, Greg. Let me say this by way of<br />
preface. I never, in developing the relations with China<br />
which I was very much involved in myself, did so at the<br />
expense of the rest of the region and that's quite evident<br />
by the success of the APEC Asia Pacific Economic<br />
Cooperation Conference that I hosted here at the end of<br />
last year. What do they mean? They mean this, that the<br />
twin reforms that were being pushed basically by my close<br />
friend Zhao Ziyang under the patronage of Deng have been<br />
stemmed. He understood, and may I say by way of background<br />
that I speak from probably 20 to 30 hours of private<br />
conversation over the years with Zhao Ziyang. Zhao Ziyang<br />
understood that political reform was the inevitable<br />
concomitant of successful economic reform. He knew that if<br />
you were going to get growth in China you were going to be<br />
able to lift the standards of people and deal with a whole<br />
range of issues, not only economic, environmental and so on,<br />
but you had to have the country growing and that required a<br />
release from the stultifications of the command economy of<br />
the Marxist Leninist model. He knew that if you were going<br />
to do those things you had to have political liberation as<br />
well. He came up in the end against the stumbling block of<br />
top price reform because he'd gone a long way in economic<br />
reform, but once you've got price reform that means you had<br />
to cut out subsidies, and when you cut out subsidies that<br />
meant increases in prices and that meant political upheaval.<br />
wouldn't allow him to go ahead. So it means that the<br />
thrust to economic reform has been stopped and there's been<br />
an imposition of this, of this dictatorship by a group of<br />
frightened old men. That is bad for the people of China and<br />
it is potentially destabilising to the region. I believe we<br />
haven't had the degree of full support from China in regard<br />
to resolving the Cambodian question that we might have had<br />
if those events hadn't occurred. </p>
<p>CRANNEY: On the subject of Peter Garrett, whereas he's not<br />
able to be in the studio this morning, we have taped a<br />
couple of questions from him as President of the ACF. We'll<br />
have the first of those now.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, you repeal the Coastal Waters<br />
Act 1980 and the Coastal Waters State Powers Act 1988 in<br />
order to provide the Commonwealth with powers to develop a<br />
national coastal management strategy and protect our<br />
coastline? PM: Peter I'll give you a clear answer to that. What you<br />
know, I think, that I have referred the question of coastal<br />
development to the Resource Assessment Commission. What I<br />
will do is to wait to get the report from the Resource<br />
Assessment Commission. I'll discuss that report with the<br />
States because, as you know, I always try, if it's possible,<br />
to act cooperatively with the States. And if out of the<br />
report from the Resource Assessment Commission and<br />
discussion with the States I can get an acceptable outcome<br />
in terms of ensuring the protection of our coastal<br />
environment, that will be it. If out of the discussion with<br />
the States we couldn't get the powers and the authority to<br />
do what may be recommended to protect the coastal<br />
environment, I would be prepared to act unilaterally.<br />
QUESTION: Will you instruct your Government to move towards<br />
phasing out uranium mining during the next term of the<br />
Parliament? PM: I can't give you that promise Peter. It would be easy<br />
to say yes, but I wouldn't give you the answer I'll instruct<br />
them to phase it out. What I have said Peter is that we've<br />
referred the question of mining to the committee...<br />
receive their report. You will notice that I indicated the<br />
other day that it would be my clear disposition that there<br />
wouldn't be any extension beyond the..<br />
CRANNEY: This morning we have a question from a Melbourne<br />
listener, somebody who was tuned to 3MMM when we invited<br />
them to pose a question to you.<br />
QUESTION: I'm Edith from Frankston and I was wondering if<br />
Mr Hawke is going to do something definite about Japanese<br />
buying up Australia. Because I'm a grandmother of ten and<br />
I'm quite concerned, and especially as Australians aren't<br />
allowed to buy anything, land, in Japan. Nobody's<br />
mentioning it in all these speeches. I'd like to have<br />
something definite on that.<br />
PM: Yes Edith I suppose the easy thing for me to say is yes<br />
we'll stop the Japanese buying. I'm not going to give you<br />
that answer, although it sounds as though it's the one you'd<br />
like. I'm giving you the one I think is the answer that's<br />
right for Australia. We need in this country investment<br />
from overseas, not unlimited investment Edith. We need to<br />
be a country which is not just dependent upon what we dig up<br />
out of the ground and what we grow, which has tended to be </p>
<p>the picture of Australia in the past. We need to develop<br />
our manufacturing industry. Certainly we need to develop<br />
our service industry so that we can export a wider range of<br />
goods. And to do these things well there are other<br />
countries in the world, including Japan who's got know-how<br />
and so on, that we ought to have in here. Now that doesn't<br />
mean unlimited buying up and investment. That's why we've<br />
got a thing called the Foreign Investment Review Board<br />
Edith. That is at arms length from the Government. It<br />
gives us advice and it says whether a particular proposal to<br />
purchase something in Australia is consistent with<br />
Australia's national interest. I will keep the Foreign<br />
Investment Review Board so that we can have that advice as<br />
to whether any particular investment is consistent with the<br />
Australian national interest. I would point out to you<br />
Edith that the Liberals and National Party propose to<br />
abolish the Foreign Investment Review Board.<br />
CRANNEY: Prime Minister, a question from a Sydney listener<br />
from Cronulla.<br />
QUESTION: My name is Linda Johnson, I'm from Cronulla. I'd<br />
just like to say Mr Hawke that it's my first time voting<br />
this year and I'd just like to ask why you honestly think I<br />
should vote for you. Thank you. Bye.<br />
PM: Thanks Linda. Well you couldn't give me a more direct<br />
question than that. I'll try and make the answer as brief<br />
as I can Linda. Firstly I think you should vote for me<br />
because I have revolutionised the educational opportunity<br />
pattern in Australia. I would hope that you're one of the<br />
beneficiaries. In the seven years before I came to office<br />
in ' 83, in those seven years the conservatives who had the<br />
responsibility for governing this country had not lifted the<br />
level of kids staying on in school at all. It had gone from<br />
34% to 36%. In other words they went out of office having<br />
done nothing to increase the equality of opportunity in<br />
education. Only one in three of our kids were staying on in<br />
school. I've dramatically changed that. It's now two in<br />
three and I've lifted it to 62%. Two in three instead of<br />
one in three. That means Linda that the kids are staying on<br />
in school not just from the wealthy suburbs but wherever you<br />
go kids now, because I've more than doubled the secondary<br />
education allowances to kids from low to low to middle<br />
income families, trebled the Austudy allowances, kids are<br />
now able to stay on in school whatever the income level of<br />
their parents. I think it's hard to imagine anything more<br />
important than that and a more criminal neglect of the<br />
responsibility of government that the conservatives<br />
followed. Their education policies are still based upon the<br />
concept of privilege. So that's one fundamental thing. The<br />
second fundamental thing is the question of employment<br />
opportunities. We've together created 1.6 million new jobs<br />
Linda in the last seven years. That's five times faster<br />
than the mob that were in before me. It's more than twice<br />
as fast as the rest of the world. So your chances of being<br />
educated and trained and getting employment are infinitely<br />
greater under my policies. I'll just go to some of the </p>
<p>other things but let me go also to the question of the<br />
environment which I imagine Linda must be important for you.<br />
Very simple and indisputable facts that I put in the debate<br />
the other day. The Franklin would not be running free if I<br />
were not Prime Minister. If the conservatives had been in<br />
office the Franklin would be dammed. It's only because I'm<br />
Prime Minister of a Labor Government that the Daintree is<br />
not being logged. They opposed that decision to stop<br />
logging. It's only because I am Prime Minister of a Labor<br />
Government that Kakadu is not being mined. They opposed the<br />
decisions there. It's only because I am Prime Minister of a<br />
Labor Government that the tall forests of Tasmania have been<br />
saved. They opposed it. So if you want environmental<br />
responsibility you vote for Bob Hawke and Labor.<br />
CRANNEY: That says that. I think we'll go to questions<br />
from our economic analyst Peter Switzer. Good morning<br />
Peter. QUESTION: as the station's interpreter of gobbleygook,<br />
which economics often is, I am regularly asked by listeners<br />
why is there a privileged group who only pay 13.5% on home<br />
loans? Young people on 17-18% think you're afraid of losing<br />
votes. What would you tell them?<br />
PM: Well it was a decision that was taken for the time. We<br />
that people that were there had taken their loans at<br />
that rate and we made the decision that they should be kept<br />
there, knowing that over a period of time that would wash<br />
out, as it is Peter. So there was no other reason than<br />
that. The basic issue I think, as you'll appreciate Peter,<br />
for the future is under which side of politics are interest<br />
rates likely to come down. The banking system is saying<br />
now, as you know, that under our policies and they were<br />
saying it as recently as yesterday interest rates will<br />
fall. They cannot possibly fall under our opponents because<br />
of two reasons. There'd be a wages explosion under our<br />
opponents and they would blow the budget surplus by their $ 6<br />
billion unfunded promises. So they'll fall under us. They<br />
can't under our opponents.<br />
QUESTION: But one thing I'm sure you've discovered, that<br />
charisma can't take on interest rates very easily<br />
PM:<br />
QUESTION: but certainly interest rates are the one thing<br />
that I've noticed people who were great supporters of you in<br />
the past are now saying that they're crippled by interest<br />
rates. And they were particularly incensed when banks were<br />
saying that if you deregulated these 13.5% loans, normal<br />
rates, the floating rates would come down by one to one and<br />
a half percent. Now when you look at the period of time<br />
people have been paying high interest rates it adds up quite<br />
a lot of money, a year for some people.<br />
PM: I know the banks are saying that to some extent. I've<br />
explained why it was done, that there was an existing </p>
<p>situation and obligation we thought should not be interfered<br />
with. Let me make the point however about the level of<br />
interest rates. I've said on a number of occasions that we<br />
haven't had interest rates high for fun. I mean I'm an<br />
intelligent guy, I understand politics, I understand<br />
economics, and I know that people don't like high interest<br />
rates. The simple facts were and I don't want to blind<br />
your listeners with a lot of statistics the simply. facts<br />
were that last year, last financial year, we had a situation<br />
where consumption increased, as you know Peter, by eight<br />
percent and our production by four percent. The gap of four<br />
percent dragging in imports. We simply had to soften<br />
demand. We couldn't tighten our budget policy any more and<br />
we certainly couldn't tighten wages policy. So it had to be<br />
monetary policy. Now the fact is that that is working and<br />
it's working in a way where we've still got growth, we've<br />
still got employment, but we are going to be able to<br />
moderate that demand for imports. And the banking industry<br />
is saying that it's working and under my policies interest<br />
rates are going to come down. That's the picture for the<br />
future. QUESTION: Right. But as you know you could've say raised<br />
taxes. Of course it's a political loser but at least the<br />
of restraining demand would've fallen right across the<br />
entire community rather than this narrow group, not a narrow<br />
group, but a broad group of young people who are kicking off<br />
their lives under a lot of strain. Now a lot of people on<br />
13.5% have also received two rounds of tax cuts. These<br />
people should vote for you and Paul Keating five times over<br />
because you've been very good to them. But young people I<br />
think, particularly in marginal seats, you're going to find<br />
they won't forgive you on this particular point.<br />
PM: You've just got to make a judgement. You've made a<br />
judgement about the intelligence of those people. You say<br />
they're going to have a punishment vote, they're going to<br />
say I'm going to vote against Bob because he put interest<br />
rates up. I'd just make a different judgement about their<br />
intelligence. I think that they understand that Bob Hawke,<br />
after 30 years in public life working for ordinary people,<br />
that's what I've been about. I mean for 20 years working in<br />
the trade union movement for ordinary people I've devoted my<br />
whole life to that and then ten years of political life for<br />
the same thing. I think they're going to say well Bob<br />
Hawke, he hasn't given 30 years of his life to go and do<br />
something nasty to me for the fun of it. I think they're<br />
going to much more intelligently say, than your analysis<br />
Peter, if I can say so with respect, they're going to say<br />
the 24th of March is going to determine who is going to be<br />
running the country for the next three years. Now Hawkey's<br />
done some things done some things that were a bit tough, we<br />
don't like them, but under those policies are interest rates<br />
coming down. Answer yes. Peacock, firstly, clearly doesn't<br />
understand the economy. He's not allowed really to answer<br />
questions or be exposed to analysis like this about the<br />
operation of the economy. But more importantly than that he<br />
can't tell us that there's not going to be a wages </p>
<p>explosion. He shrugs his shoulders and says who's to know<br />
when you ask him what wages outcome is going to be. And<br />
he's got a $ 6 billion blowout of the deficit. So say<br />
inevitably under Peacock interest rates must go up. They'll<br />
come down under Hawkey. Now I just think that's the sort of<br />
analysis rather than the kick in the but<br />
QUESTION: Sure, but with respect to your view Prime<br />
Minister, what about consumption tax? In 1985 you were a<br />
big supporter of that. Now that would actually restrain<br />
demand, it would hit everybody and in particular it would<br />
pick up people in the black economy who are earning money,<br />
not paying tax on it. And what I'm arguing here is that you<br />
and the coalition dodge these tough measures because they<br />
are politically unpopular.<br />
PM: You can't say I dodge tough decisions<br />
QUESTION: On this one I think you<br />
PM: On the contrary. No. I, in the 1984 election, said<br />
we'll have a tax summit. And you're right Peter in<br />
recalling that we put up a proposal for a reform of the tax<br />
system which involved the introduction of a consumption tax<br />
with, may I say, a whole range of safety net provisions to<br />
try and limit the regressive impact of it that is that the<br />
consumption tax has a harsher impact on lower income people<br />
than it does on higher income people. Now, the community as<br />
a whole, let me say, the trade union movement, the welfare<br />
organisations and business I mean the cries of business<br />
now for a consumption tax just make me laugh. They<br />
torpedoed it in 1985. So we went ahead with the community,<br />
right across and said we don't want a consumption tax.<br />
We said alright, that's the community view. We restructured<br />
it, we brought in the capital gains tax, we brought in the<br />
fringe benefits tax, a whole range of other taxes. And we<br />
think that we've now produced a much fairer tax system.<br />
What would happen now if you brought in a consumption tax<br />
would be an immediate boost of inflation. We don't think<br />
that' s appropriate.<br />
CRANNEY: We'll go to Kate Short from the Total Environment<br />
Centre.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, your Government's decision on<br />
Wesley Vale was a significant step forward to reducing<br />
chemical pollution of the environment and the Government<br />
acted to prevent the release of organo-chlorines into Bass<br />
Strait from Wesley Vale which is very significant. Does the<br />
Labor Government propose to have an ongoing commitment to<br />
reducing the environmental pollution from organo-chlorines<br />
but specifically, when do you offer us a commitment to<br />
finally ban the use of those organo-chlorine poisons,<br />
dieldren, aldren(?), chlordane and heptachlor.<br />
PM: Well, in regard to mills generally, Kate, as you know<br />
we're going to have national guidelines there and we<br />
wouldn't permit the operation of any mills which didn't meet </p>
<p>those guidelines. And, as you say, in regard to Wesley Vale<br />
they were unacceptable levels. In regard to the emissions<br />
of unacceptable or dangerous chemicals generally, I think<br />
you know our commitment there to action. We have, for<br />
instance, in regard to CFCs the commitment that by 1995 that<br />
be cut down by 95 percent. And we have in the statement<br />
that I made last year, the overall environmental statement,<br />
a commitment that within our power where we have the power<br />
that we will take action to reduce the emission of dangerous<br />
chemicals because I think you know it came up in a<br />
conversation we were having in part of the problem in<br />
regard to industry generally is that it's not within our<br />
Commonwealth terrible situation in Australia where<br />
you've got to get the cooperation of States if you're going<br />
to in national sense have the control over the emission of<br />
dangerous chemicals.<br />
QUESTION: Another question, Prime Minister. Recently, I<br />
received information about the use of pesticides on crops<br />
that are grown to feed cattle, cattle that are exported<br />
overseas to the Japanese and American markets, this is up in<br />
the North West of NSW. I simultaneously received<br />
information about the use of pesticides on these crops being<br />
used to feed to our cattle, those pesticides, two of them in<br />
particular, are not registered for use in the United States.<br />
They are banned in the United States and they are, in fact<br />
recent registrations in Australia, at least one of them.<br />
Now under these circumstances do you consider that your<br />
Government's aware enough of future problems of beef cattle<br />
residue sort of problems of the type that we had in ' 87<br />
where our beef market was threatened because of residues.<br />
Do you think we're doing enough to protect not only our own<br />
food chain in Australia, but very specifically the beef<br />
export market?<br />
PM: Yes, well obviously I can't comment upon the two things<br />
that you've just and I understand you don't expect me<br />
to, but let me say this, that I know that John Kerin who I<br />
think, I hope you'd agree is, you know, a quite outstanding<br />
Minister in this area acted very deliberately and quickly<br />
when those problems arose three years ago and it's my<br />
understanding, Kate, not only from our own people here but<br />
from within the United States that they expressed<br />
satisfaction of the action that was taken to make sure that<br />
the processes of beef production in this country were<br />
satisfactory in terms of protecting human consumption<br />
standards. If there's anything in particular that you want<br />
to make available to me that's come to your attention, I'll<br />
certainly pass it on to John, but I'd be very surprised if<br />
they weren't aware of it.<br />
CRANNEY: Prime Minister we have a call from a Brisbane<br />
listener by the name of George Walker that we'd like to play<br />
for you.<br />
QUESTION: If he doesn't want us to spend our money and save<br />
it, why don't they just take off, why do they tax us on our<br />
savings when we put our money in the bank when we ' ye already </p>
<p>been taxed? If they took this tax off our savings in the<br />
bank, I'd put all my money in the bank and I wouldn't go<br />
buying any stereos and things like that from overseas.<br />
PM: Well George, the fellow who wants to become Prime<br />
Minister, Andrew Peacock, last year when he started off on<br />
his sort of pre-election campaign, his dry run, started off<br />
on the first day by saying that he had the answer to<br />
Australia's problems. He was going to bring in tax<br />
deductibility. Now it sounded great, but then when it was<br />
subject to questioning, you've got to look at on both sides<br />
deductibility for savings and deductibility for<br />
expenditures and when you look the question in detail it<br />
was subject to so many practical problems that his own<br />
people as well as our own people on our side and in the<br />
Treasury decided that it was, in practical terms,<br />
impossible. What we've got to do George is, you're right,<br />
you're quite right, we've got to encourage savings in this<br />
country. The greatest single contribution that we're making<br />
to that is the revolution in superannuation. When we came to<br />
office, superannuation was the preserve of a privileged few,<br />
particularly professionals, white collar workers. Now as a<br />
result of introducing it into the wage negotiation<br />
processes, we will have within three years, a situation<br />
where every employer will be paying $ 30 a week for every<br />
employee and most particularly, may I say, including women<br />
who were very much excluded from it before. $ 30 a week for<br />
each employee and that's going to add over the period in the<br />
remainder of this century, hundreds of millions of dollars<br />
into our superannuation funds and it's going to increase<br />
savings within the community and it's going to be relevant<br />
to our debt problem. That's the most effective way of<br />
stimulating savings and of course we've, we're doing that.<br />
The Opposition proposes to abolish that concept of<br />
superannuation as an award provision. </p>
<p>SC: Well, Jimmy Barnes is pretty well accustomed to working with<br />
a big audience and this morning, a bigger one than average,<br />
through 2M'MM in Sydney, 3M'MM Melbourne, 4MMM Brisbane, and New FM<br />
in Newcastle and 4GGG on the Gold Coast, we just played Jimmy-<br />
" Working Class Man". Our guest this morning is the Prime<br />
Minister, who is well aware of Jimmy Barnes. We have a little<br />
ditty that was made in our Sydney's studios that you might be<br />
amused by. We'll play it now for you.<br />
( Ditty played).<br />
SC: Jimmy Barnes look out. Seriously for a moment, we'll<br />
cross to 3MM14 In Melbourne, where Sean Carney is waiting in the<br />
studios. if you could just put those headphones on again, I<br />
think Sean is available...<br />
PMa Hazel, I'm afraid, said I just lost the musician's vote.<br />
She said I'm not a very tuneful singer.<br />
SC: Are you there Sean?<br />
Carney: I am.<br />
SC: Please, if you'd like to speak to the Prime Minister, he<br />
awaits to hear from you.<br />
PM: G'day, Sean.<br />
Carney: G'day. How are you Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Good.<br />
Carney: Prime Minister, three years ago, you promised to wipe<br />
out child poverty, I'm wondering if in your next term you'd<br />
perhaps be willing to make a pledge an the issue of homelessness?<br />
Under your new housing assistance package, the real level of </p>
<p>12<br />
funds for public housing provided by your Government is lower now<br />
than under the Fraser Government. If you are re-elected, will<br />
you increase your financial commitment to public housing?<br />
PM; Well, just let me go to the first part of your question<br />
first and then to the second. You talk about the child poverty.<br />
All I want to say on that is, Sean, I hope that you won't<br />
question the judgement that's been made by the Brotherhood of St<br />
Lawrence through Bishop Hollingworth, Julian Disney of The<br />
Australian Council of Social Service and The Australian Institute<br />
of Family Studies. Just let me quote what each of them has said<br />
on the promise I made that there would be no f inancial need for<br />
an Australian child to live in poverty after 1990. And that was<br />
by promising to give indexed proportions of the married pension<br />
rate to children in low income families. Hollingworth, in 1989,<br />
said: " In strict income security terms, the Prime Ministerial<br />
promise will be achieved". Julian Disney said: " It is without<br />
doubt, a remarkable achievement first to have set and then to<br />
have achieved the payments of benchmarks to children in low<br />
income families". And thirdly, The Australian Institute of<br />
Family Studies said: " By these means, the benchmarks set by the<br />
Government have been met". And under the meeting of those<br />
benchmarks, we're paying out over two billion dollars a year now<br />
into low income families with children. Just to give you an<br />
example, a low income family one income, three kids, $ 320 a<br />
week income they're getting $ 110 a week tax free, which is<br />
equivalent to $ 170 a week wage increase. That's why those in the<br />
area have said we've met that financial commitment. You're quite<br />
right however, Sean, in saying that that hasn't met that<br />
there is not poverty, there are not difficulties. And that's why<br />
I've met with the institutions like the Brotherhood of St<br />
Lawrence and The Australian Council of Social Services. Why I've<br />
met with the State Governments now. And what we've got to do is<br />
to work on ensuring that services get delivered, particularly in<br />
areas where they're not so accessible the outer suburban fringe<br />
areas now and some of the more remote rural areas. We've got to<br />
make sure that services are delivered.<br />
S on the question of housing, let me make these points. I have<br />
very substantially increased the amounts of money available for<br />
refuges very, very substantial increases and have sought to<br />
get dollar for dollar support from the States as well. In<br />
housing generally, there's been a nine percent improvement in<br />
housing starts under us compared with before. About an<br />
additional twelve thousand starts a year. And we've now revamped<br />
the Commuonwealth / State Housing Agreement and lifted the amount<br />
from some seven hundred million dollars a year up to just over a<br />
billion and release more funds by changing the loan to grant<br />
arrangements so that there will be more money available for<br />
welfare housing. And let me say, we will continue to do that<br />
into the future, Sean. </p>
<p>Carney: Prime Minister, you mentioned the outer suburbs in your<br />
answer. PM: Yeah.<br />
Carney: I wanted to speak to you about the suburbs. The Social<br />
Security Minister, Mr Howe, last year referred to a new poor<br />
emerging in the outer suburbs of our big capital cities.<br />
PM: Mm.<br />
Carney: With their high crime rates, their vandalism,<br />
unemployment and insufficient government services. Why doesn't<br />
your Government have a specific strategy to improve those areas?<br />
W PM: Well, this campaign is not finished yet. And I would<br />
Suggest, Sean, that you will find by the time we go into the<br />
election, that you will have found that we will have addressed<br />
this question. Unfortunately, on this programme is not the time<br />
to announce what I will be announcing later. But I can assure<br />
you that Brian H~ owe has not just been talking about this issue.<br />
Brian is an action man, as I think you would agree. I think he's<br />
the best Social Security Minister this country's seen. He's been<br />
talking with welfare organisations, like The Australian Council,<br />
the umbrella organisation, The Australian Council of Social<br />
Services, the Brotherhood of St Lawrence and you will find that<br />
we'll be making announcements which are specifically directed<br />
towards the sort of area of problem that you've raised in your<br />
question. Carney: Thanks Prime Minister.<br />
SSC&amp; Thank you Sean. Thank you Prime Minister. We'll go back to<br />
s orne music. We'll play ( inaudible)<br />
( Music)<br />
SC: Well, first there was ( inaudible) with " Nothing Compares to<br />
You". And finally we played " Simple Minds". If it was only so<br />
simple, as the song was called, to promise you a miracle. Good<br />
morning folks, you're listening to Stuart Cranney on 2MMM in<br />
Sydney, 314MM in Melbourne, 4MMM Brisbane, New FM in Newcastle and<br />
4GGG on the Gold Coast. our guest this morning is the Prime<br />
Minister, Bob Hawke. ' Mr Hawke, we spoke to some listeners in<br />
Newcastle. If you put your headphones on, we have this question<br />
on the matter of inflation.<br />
Caller: Mr Hawke, I'd like to know what you're honestly going to<br />
do about inflation? And can't you please get ready for politics<br />
without knocking the Opposition all the time? Concentrate on<br />
what you're going to do instead of what they're not doing? </p>
<p>P14: Well, let me take the second part of the question first. I<br />
think if you look at Mr peacock's launch of Monday, you will see<br />
that that was overwhelmingly consisting of an attack upon us.<br />
I'll just ask you to compare and contrast that with what you'll<br />
see me doing on Thursday when I launch our campaign. Politics<br />
necessarily, of course, I must say, involves two things.<br />
Certainly if you believe in yourself, it involves you talking<br />
about what you've done as a basis for asking people to trust you<br />
for what you'll do in the future as your policies for the<br />
future. But also politics is a question of choice. It's either<br />
me or Mr Peacock that you're going to have as Prime Minister<br />
after the 24th. And so part of my responsibility is to analyse<br />
what a Peacock alternative would mean. I would not be<br />
discharging my responsibilities to the electors of Australia if I<br />
simply said: " Look at what Bob Hawke's done and look at what Bob<br />
WHawke promises for the futuren. And didn't analyse for you the<br />
implications of the alternative.<br />
Now as to inf lation, let me make the point there both in<br />
positive terms and in terms of the alternative of Mr Peacock.<br />
Remember this as the basic fact. When we came to of fice,<br />
inflation was about eleven percent. It wasn't an accident that<br />
it was about eleven percent because you had a wages policy under<br />
the then government conservative government which was a wages<br />
free for all. And we'd had a wages explosion gone out by about<br />
seventeen percent wages had exploded inflation went through<br />
the roof. Now, what I have done about inflation is to get wages<br />
under control. We've had predictable wages outcome and we have<br />
dramatically reduced inflation. With the decline in our terms of<br />
trade, inflation went up but it is coming down again now and with<br />
the wages outcome of seven percent for the next year, that I've<br />
now got a commitment from the trade union movement for, we<br />
believe inflation will be coming down further and that's the<br />
judgement of the Treasury. They said at the end of last year,<br />
that the underlying inflation rate was 5.7 percent. So, we've<br />
got wages under control and we've got a budget surplus. Now, the<br />
alternative is again a wages explosion under Mr Peacock because<br />
he said he doesn't know what the wages outcome would be under his<br />
policies. They could explode again and they would. And he also<br />
got the six billion dollar hole in his funding promises so the<br />
budget surplus would be blown, further putting pressure upon<br />
inflation. So, I face right up to your question. I say our<br />
policies are directed towards bringing inflation down and they're<br />
recognised that they will. And the alternative is necessarily an<br />
increase in inflation for the reasons that I've put.<br />
SC: Prime Minister, a familiar face across the table now. Our<br />
Canberra Bureau Chief, John Hewitt, who I'm sure you've met.<br />
PM; Yeah John.<br />
JH: How are you doing? </p>
<p>PM: Good.<br />
JHt My questions centres on despite what you said earlier it<br />
seems to me that many people no longer see you as the bloke next<br />
door. I mean, I mean is it inevitable that leadership isolates<br />
you from the average Aussie?<br />
PM: it's inevitable, John, that I'm not going to be seen as much<br />
as the bloke next door after I've been seven years living In The<br />
Lodge and Kirribilli. I mean, that's inevitable. And it has its<br />
pluses because you are Prime Minister and it gives you all the<br />
opportunities and challenges of doing things that are involved<br />
with that. But there is a minus and that is that f or both<br />
Hazel and myself we don't have the opportunity for the<br />
gregarious mixing with people that was so much a part of my life<br />
before. But I still think f rom the evidence T have when I move<br />
around Australia and not only election times, I go around the<br />
electorates, I mix with the kids in the schools. Now you see the<br />
reception I get from the kids, and they're pretty. they're<br />
pretty acute judges, you know, as to whether a bloke's dinkum or<br />
not. Whether he's one of them, whether he's Australian, or<br />
whether he's some bloke that's remote from them. I don't think<br />
there's much better judges than that. And the fact that I love<br />
kids and are committed to them-and we're about them and their<br />
future. They understand that I think. So, it's inevitable, yes,<br />
you get some isolation.<br />
JHt Sure.<br />
PM: I think I'm still there.<br />
JHt Okay. on unemployment, the Government's decided on a twelve<br />
month limit for unemployment benefits compared to the Coalition's<br />
nine months, and you are promising re-training. Given the<br />
general community support for cuts to the ' unemployment benefit,<br />
did you feel a need to follow the Coalition's lead, albeit with a<br />
bit of extra time and a more human face?<br />
PM: No. It's much, much different to that. What we've<br />
announced now is not something out of kilter and out of line with<br />
what we've been doing. What we've been doing over seven years is<br />
to drastically reform the whole process of dealing with and<br />
looking after the people in the community who are not fortunate<br />
enough just to be automatically in the workforce. You know the<br />
whole range of new training programmes Jet Start, New Start,<br />
Skill Share. All those programmes have been built up over the<br />
years with one aim in mind and that is to make sure that those<br />
less fortunate in the community either those with a longer<br />
unemployment experience, or with some particular disabilitieshave<br />
a programme which is fitted to their needs. And what Brian<br />
Howe, on behalf of the Government, has announced now just in the </p>
<p>last few weeks, is a continuation of that. we want to removeI<br />
really, from the community the concept of the dole mentality that<br />
there is a responsibility just to pay the unemployment benefit.<br />
The responsibility of the community is to train people for<br />
employment. And that's what these new programmes have done. The<br />
great difference between us and the other mob is this. We have a<br />
social safety net there which is composed of training and<br />
commitment to people if for some reason or other they simply<br />
can't get employment, to care for them. What the other mob is<br />
about is to substitute a social trapdoor pay them for nine<br />
months and then push them through the trapdoor and you've got no<br />
further obligation to them. I just regard that as an<br />
unacceptable concept.<br />
SC: Prime Minister, we'll take one more piece of good Australian<br />
rock n'roll support that industry and play " Spy Versus Spy".<br />
We'll return in a moment.<br />
( Music)<br />
SC: I'm sure the spies aren't alone in asking that particular<br />
question. I daresay we'd all like to know what the future holds.<br />
Good morning folks. Dependent on where you're listening, you're<br />
listening to 2100( in Sydney, 14MM in Melbourne, MMM in Brisbane,<br />
New FM in Newcastle, and on the Gold Coast, it's 4GGG. Now, the<br />
Sydney News Director, David White, for the Prime Minister, a<br />
question. Dave.<br />
DW: Prime Minister, this final question comes in part from a<br />
Canadian geneticist from the Department of Zoology, University of<br />
British Columbia, Professor David Suzuki.<br />
" To me, the most pernicious truth that is repeated over and<br />
over again by every politician, every business person, every<br />
economist, is the sanctity of growth. We must have growth to<br />
have steady progress. Now, the steady growth one percent, two<br />
percent, three percent, twenty percent over a given period of<br />
time is what we call in science, exponential growth, and any<br />
scientist will tell you that nothing in the universe continues to<br />
grow steadily, exponentially, indefinitely. And yet that is a<br />
notionl that we cling to and that all of our government policies<br />
are aimed towards maintaining steady economic growth. Now I<br />
believe then that if you look at the ludicrous nature of the<br />
faith in exponential growth, you only come to the conclusion that<br />
we already consume to a far higher extent than we should and that<br />
we ought to be aiming, if we care at all about what's going to<br />
happen in the next century, not at zero growth. We should be<br />
aiming at negative growth. It is the height of irresponsibility<br />
to fail to see that economic growth steady economic growthcannot<br />
be sustained."<br />
Prime Minister what he's addressing is a new way of thinking.<br />
Now, given most nations adherence to our current economic system, </p>
<p>4. b~ 17<br />
can the change he suggests be accomplished without massive social<br />
turmoil? People being thrown out of work?<br />
PM: No, I believe it can't. I think in the end politics is<br />
about the creation of greater happiness for those who you govern.<br />
That's my simple view of what politics is about. And people's<br />
concept of happiness does involve the idea of gradual improvement<br />
in standards of living, and, importantly also, quality of life.<br />
And quality of life is not necessarily a function of growth. I<br />
accept that. But I think the human genius is such that we are<br />
able to do both. That is to improve our material standards and to<br />
accept the challenge and responsibility of improving our quality<br />
of life. I don't accept the Professor's implied dichotomy that<br />
you can only have either growth or improved quality. I think<br />
sensible, intelligent communicative government can give you both.<br />
It's not easy, but i think the balance is achievable.<br />
imt Thank you.<br />
SC: Thank you Prime Minister. We've actually run over time s0<br />
we'll have to wrap up here. To Greg Sheridan from The<br />
Australian, thanks Greg. Peter Switzer(?), Sean Carney, Dr Kate<br />
Short, John Hewitt, Peter Garrett, David White and of course,<br />
David Suzuki, thank you. But most of all, thank you Prime<br />
Minister. It's been a pleasure having you on the programme this<br />
morning. PM'; Well, Stuart, thank you very much. And can I say thank you<br />
to you and to everyone on the panel and most particularly, of<br />
course to your listeners. I've enjoyed it very much indeed.<br />
SC: It's about time you got some pleasure from the media.<br />
PM: I do generally.<br />
SC: You've been listening to the first of our election ninety<br />
specials with Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. The right of reply,<br />
Wednesday, March 2.1st, with opposition Leader, Andrew Peacock.<br />
ENDS. </p>
