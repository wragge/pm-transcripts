<p><b>JOURNALIST:</b></p>
<p>Mr Howard, Bob Carr says he’s been misquoted, do you still stand by your comments…?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Bob Carr has not been misquoted, I saw him say it. He said that anybody who wins a Lower House has a mandate and has the support of the electorate to introduce his programme. And what Bob Carr has done is to utterly demolish the foolish attacks on our election victory by the Federal Labor Party. Bob Carr has spoken the truth on the <i>Stateline</i> programme. Bob Carr has stated the reality that if you win an election in the Lower House you have the moral and political authority to implement the programme on which you campaigned to the people. I saw Bob Carr, I know what Bob Carr’s said and Bob Carr can’t rewrite what he said.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
