SAL OF 0O. T. C. LAIfD AT APPLECROSS, PERTH<br />
TO WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
Joint statement by the Prime Minister, the Right<br />
Honourable Harold Holt, and the Honourable<br />
David Brand, 1I. L. A., Premier of Western Australia<br />
" It was announced today that the Commonwealth<br />
Government and the Western Australian Government had reached<br />
agreement on terms for the disposal by the Commonwealth of the<br />
Overseas Telecommunication's Radio Transmitting Station site at<br />
Applecross, near Perth.<br />
The O. T. C. is soon to vacate the area which<br />
comprises some 99 acres and fronts the Canning Highway. The<br />
area, known as Wireless Hill, is a bushland site with views<br />
over the Swan and Canning Rivers and the State Government<br />
had expressed the desire to have it reserved in perpetuity for<br />
public recreation purposes.<br />
The Commonwealth had given sympathetic consideration<br />
to this proposal and had advised that it was prepared to make<br />
the whole area available to the State for 600,000. This is a<br />
concessional figure representing 50 per cent of the commercial<br />
valuation and has regard to the State's intended public use of<br />
the land. The Premier today advised the Prime LIinister that the<br />
Western Australian Government was pleased to accept the offer".<br />
