    <content><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Easter is the most important time in the Christian calendar - bringing hope, new life and renewal. </p>
<p dir="ltr">For many of us, regardless of our faith, Easter is an opportunity to spend time with family and friends. </p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are travelling over the long weekend - please drive carefully, don’t speed, take a break at least every two hours - be safe. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Jesus’ example of love, sacrifice and service to others is one that inspires us all and a reminder that Easter is also a time to remember those in need - the less fortunate, the homeless, the lonely, and the sick.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This long weekend is also a time to thank those who don’t get a break - including our  police, doctors, nurses and firefighters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I want to pay special tribute to our emergency service workers who have supported our resilient and courageous communities in the Northern Territory,  QLD, Victoria and NSW - where cyclones, floods and fires have done their worst.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, we should also remember those who are far from home this Easter including our Defence Force servicemen and women. . </p>
<p dir="ltr">So over this Easter holiday, Lucy and I hope you have a safe, peaceful and inspiring holiday, shared with the people you love. </p>
