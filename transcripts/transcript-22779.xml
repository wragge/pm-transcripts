<p>Sydney</p>
<p>The Rudd Government has announced an additional $19.5 million in Government funding to the Chris OâBrien Lifehouse project at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPA) in Camperdown.</p>
<p>The extra funding will allow the fit-out of inpatient facilities, operating suites and procedure rooms to be built faster, allowing cancer patients to be treated sooner on site.</p>
<p>The purpose built centre is part of the Governmentâs commitment to provide world leading cancer care in Australia. Lifehouse at RPA will ensure better outcomes for people living with cancer.</p>
<p>As an integrated cancer centre, Lifehouse at RPA will deliver a range of vital services in the one location including clinical care, surgery, medical and radiation oncology, research, integrative medicine, and support services for patients, their families and carers.</p>
<p>The new facilities will include 96 inpatient beds, eight operating suites and procedure rooms, and 18 intensive care and high dependency beds.</p>
<p>Since coming to power in 2007, the Government has invested more than $4 billion into cancer care, improving detection and treatment.</p>
<p>Cancer survival rates in Australia are among the best in the world due to our advances in research, development of early detection, improvements in treatment and follow up care.</p>
<p>The additional $19.5 million funding brings the total Commonwealth contribution to Lifehouse at RPA to $169.5 million.</p>
<p>In 2008-09, $50 million was allocated to Lifehouse at RPA through the Health and Hospitals Reform, followed by $100 million in 2009-10 through Round One of the Governmentâs Health and Hospitals Fund.</p>
<p>The inpatient services unit is now due to open in late 2014 â approximately two years earlier than the original expected date â thanks to the additional Federal funding and matching funds contributed by Lifehouse at RPA.</p>
<p>In the years before his passing, Chris OâBrien worked to transform the Sydney Cancer Centre into a world-class integrated cancer treatment centre.</p>
<p>The Government is honoured to help realise Chrisâ vision sooner, and Lifehouse at RPA will be a place where his compassion and skill will live on.</p>
