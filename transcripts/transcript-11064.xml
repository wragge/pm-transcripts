<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It's being called the miracle economy of the world financial</p>
<p> crisis. Australia was seen as a likely frontline victim of Asia's</p>
<p> financial crisis because of its heavy dependence on commodities and</p>
<p> exports to Asia. But instead Australia has emerged as one of the fastest</p>
<p> growing economies in the industrialised world. So how did they do</p>
<p> it? Leading analysts such as US economist Paul Krugman say Australia</p>
<p> has succeeded because of sound macro-economic policies. Those include</p>
<p> the refusal of the reserve bank to raise interest rates during a speculative</p>
<p> attack on the Australian dollar last year. A healthy and open financial</p>
<p> system free of the bad debts and distortions which undid many Asian</p>
<p> economies also underpinned Australia's performance. And finally</p>
<p> the conservative Coalition Government knows its own success in returning</p>
<p> the budget to surplus as fireproofing Australia from the global turndown.</p>
<p> The Coalition under Prime Minister John Howard was re-elected for</p>
<p> a second term last October promising further reform. But the Prime</p>
<p> Minister's victory came at a cost. His Lower House majority was</p>
<p> slashed and from July this year he faces a hostile Senate dominated</p>
<p> by left leaning parties. That leaves his Government just five months</p>
<p> to see a controversial tax and privatisation proposal before Parliament,</p>
<p> and later this year Prime Minister Howard will put a referendum to</p>
<p> the nation proposing that Australia break its remaining constitutional</p>
<p> ties to Britain and become a republic. Joining us know from Canberra</p>
<p> to discuss what promises to be another challenging year for Australia</p>
<p> and his Government is the Prime Minister John Howard. Mr Howard, thank</p>
<p> you very much for joining us today.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a pleasure Danielle.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The Australian economy surprised many people with its strength last</p>
<p> year. How much longer can we expect that to continue?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well our growth outlook is still very strong. We are being told that</p>
<p> it will be over the year ahead at least 3.25%, and I'm pretty</p>
<p> optimistic that at least that is going to be achieved. We aren't</p>
<p> complacent but we have got the fundamentals as strong as they have</p>
<p> been for 25 to 30 years. We've got the budget in healthy surplus;</p>
<p> we have low inflation; we have low interest rates; we have made a</p>
<p> lot of reforms to our labour market; and we had a strong privatisation</p>
<p> program; and we're in the midst of an historic tax reform. So</p>
<p> if all of that comes together we have laid the foundations for continued</p>
<p> strength and growth.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You mentioned inflation. Your inflation target in fact has been below</p>
<p> central bank's, the inflation rate in rather has been below the</p>
<p> central bank's target for nearly two years. Doesn't that</p>
<p> suggest that maybe there's room to grow the economy faster?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think what it means is that the growth we have at the moment</p>
<p> is very manageable and that's tremendously important. The best</p>
<p> situation is to have high but manageable growth and that is what Australia</p>
<p> has achieved over the last 12 months. And we need to keep it like</p>
<p> that because steadiness in the management of an economy is the thing</p>
<p> that more than anything else produces confidence and stability. And</p>
<p> we certainly have that, we certainly have a mood of optimism and strength,</p>
<p> the like of which we haven't seen for probably 20 or 30 years.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Your own budget is back in surplus but the Australian economy is still</p>
<p> running a current account deficit of more than five per cent of GDP.</p>
<p> How much of a concern is that on Australia's growth potential?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, an economy like Australia is always going to need to draw from</p>
<p> time to time on its external situation because of the structure of</p>
<p> the economy. The real question is whether the other elements of economic</p>
<p> policy combined with the current account deficit to make all of it</p>
<p> together a constraint. And when you have a budget surplus, low inflation,</p>
<p> low interest rates, high growth against the current account deficit</p>
<p> then it is very manageable, it can be handled. And on top of that</p>
<p> our debt servicing ratio to GDP now is significantly lower to what</p>
<p> it was a few years ago. So whilst you must always watch the current</p>
<p> account deficit, when you look at all the other fundamentals they</p>
<p> are so strong and in equilibrium that on its own that current account</p>
<p> will not act as a constraint.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I'd like to move onto the issue of reform. You won praise from</p>
<p> the financial markets for your reforms in the first term. How do you</p>
<p> plan on picking up the pace in your second term?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, first of all we make certain that we do all we can to get our</p>
<p> tax reform through. Because if we can reform the tax system in a way</p>
<p> we want to we will make Australia even more attractive as a regional</p>
<p> or world financial centre. Part of the tax reform package includes</p>
<p> the removal of taxes on certain financial transactions and that will</p>
<p> add to a number of other steps that we have taken to make Australia</p>
<p> very attractive as a financial centre. And, of course, the other thing</p>
<p> that has stuck to Australia very much is that we have a very transparently</p>
<p> regulated banking system. We have a sound, coherent, easily understood</p>
<p> and well enforced legal code as far as corporate behaviour is concerned.</p>
<p> And all of those things make Australia an attractive place in which</p>
<p> to do business.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The Goods and Services Tax legislation is key to that tax package.</p>
<p> How confident are you that you can get that through the Senate unchanged?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am optimistic about it. We don't in our own right have</p>
<p> the numbers in the Senate. We haven't had that since the day</p>
<p> we were elected in 1996. But we did put it on the table before the</p>
<p> last election. We did tell the people what we were going to do. We</p>
<p> didn't hide it and therefore we are entitled to keep saying to</p>
<p> the minor parties in the Senate, listen to the people. Democracy in</p>
<p> the end is really about a party presenting its programme, and if it</p>
<p> wins, having that programme implemented. So I remain optimistic and</p>
<p> we'll continue to push very strongly the simple proposition that</p>
<p> the Australian people voted for what we want to pass into law.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Given that if you can't get the GST through the Senate, would</p>
<p> you consider calling a fresh election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, we have just had an election on it. Let us see what happens.</p>
<p> We have a number of months to go before the 30th of June</p>
<p> and there is always a bit of shadowboxing in the sort of circumstances</p>
<p> that are operating at present.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Westpac bank has forecast that your budget surplus this year could</p>
<p> exceed your $3 billion forecast by as much $5 billion. How likely</p>
<p> is that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I am not going to start speculating about the surplus. There will</p>
<p> be a surplus but just exactly what it is I am not going to speculate</p>
<p> about. I'll leave that to the non-official economic commentators.</p>
<p> I don't want to take away their opportunities to predict but</p>
<p> I am not going to get pulled into that speculation. But the accounts</p>
<p> of Australia are in a very sound state.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>.......[inaudible] boost your revenue, will you use that to</p>
<p> make a deal with the Democrats on tax reform?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, I am not going to get into that sort of speculation. We have</p>
<p> a very fair package and we think the package as presented ought to</p>
<p> be voted for by the Parliament because the Australian people endorsed</p>
<p> it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Your Government is promoting Australia as a global financial centre.</p>
<p> Will that process extend to offerings through tax concessions for</p>
<p> foreign insitutions?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we have already offered a major tax reform in the tax package</p>
<p> and that is the removal of the bank accounts debits tax and the removal</p>
<p> of the financial institutions duty and they will....and the removal</p>
<p> of stamp duty at a State government level on share transactions. Now,</p>
<p> those three reforms together represent a major move towards making</p>
<p> Australia as a very attractive world financial centre.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Anything else in line perhaps with holding or withdrawing or withholding</p>
<p> tax on [inaudible] bonds for example?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have made some other changes a couple of years ago but I think</p>
<p> what we're now offering represents a very attractive package</p>
<p> and all we've got to do is get it through our Parliament. And</p>
<p> I hope those in the community of Australia and elsewhere who see Australia</p>
<p> as a world financial centre of the future, well, express that view</p>
<p> to those who might be tempted to vote against our package.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If we can move on to the Australian dollar, the Australian dollar</p>
<p> was a victim of hedge funds speculation last year, or a target at</p>
<p> least. Does that suggest to you that we need further curbs on speculation</p>
<p> or on speculators?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't talk, of course, about the day-to-day variations</p>
<p> in the Australian dollar. I do make the observation that the management</p>
<p> of our exchange rate position by the Reserve Bank of Australia has</p>
<p> been very professional and very sensible and I have enormous confidence</p>
<p> in our monetary authorities. As far as international financial reform</p>
<p> is concerned, we support essentially the open-market approach. There</p>
<p> is obviously some room for what I might call fine-tuning at the edges</p>
<p> to deal with certain behaviour and they were the subject of a report</p>
<p> from government and private financial people who I got together after</p>
<p> the last election. And I've sent that report to President Clinton,</p>
<p> to the Prime Minister of Japan, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</p>
<p> and to many other world leaders and the feedback I've had so</p>
<p> far has been very positive. But, fundamentally, there continues to</p>
<p> be a role for the IMF and there continues to be, of course, a great</p>
<p> emphasis on the strength of domestic financial policies.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Australia's fortunes are of course very much tied to those of</p>
<p> Japan. What do you feel is the best policy course for Japan to be</p>
<p> pursuing in order to follow a return to growth?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Clearly the Japanese Government needs to continue to address some</p>
<p> of the longer term difficulties of Japan's banking system. We</p>
<p> think that, respectfully, that that was one of the difficulties that</p>
<p> has been around for a number of years and, perhaps, if had been addressed</p>
<p> a little earlier then some of the problems now being experienced in</p>
<p> Japan would not have arisen. Japan, of course, has experienced very</p>
<p> sluggish or no growth for some time and the need is to continue to</p>
<p> press ahead with financial sector reforms because in the end unless</p>
<p> you have a completely, or as near as completely, transparent financial</p>
<p> system you are going to have problems down the track.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Returning to your own programme for this year. Australia will vote</p>
<p> on becoming a republic yet you remain a committed monarchist. Isn't</p>
<p> there an economic argument for Australia cutting its ties with Britain?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. I think it's utterly irrelevant.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, because in the end you don't buy or sell to a particular</p>
<p> country according to what is in your flag, you buy and sell according</p>
<p> to economic opportunity, you buy and sell according to economic performance.</p>
<p> And I've never heard an argument suggesting that a republican</p>
<p> push in a government delivers a lower budget deficit or a more competitive</p>
<p> external account. I think if you look around the world the success</p>
<p> and the failures, economically, bear no relationship to systems of</p>
<p> government. They bear a lot of relationships to economic policy and</p>
<p> the openness of society. Australia is one of the most open, democratic,</p>
<p> free societies in the world and that will be the case whether we maintain</p>
<p> our present system under which we are free and open and free and democratic</p>
<p> or whether we change to a republican system of government. It is utterly</p>
<p> irrelevant to the economic future of Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You've also pledged in you second term to recognise the wrongs</p>
<p> done to Australia's indigenous people. What concrete measures</p>
<p> will you take to do that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what I have committed myself to do is to try to achieve what</p>
<p> we call in Australia a process of reconciliation. And that principally</p>
<p> involves reducing the disadvantage that the indigenous people have</p>
<p> in areas relating to health and education and housing and employment</p>
<p> opportunities. The best reconciliation is that which removes contemporary</p>
<p> disadvantage.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Howard, thank you very much for joining us today.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It was a great pleasure.</p>
