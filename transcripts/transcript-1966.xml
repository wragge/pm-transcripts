AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL FOR TH3 ARTS: GRANTS FOR 19Q-69<br />
Statement bv the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
I have received from the Chairman ol the Australian Council for the<br />
\ rts the Counc-il's recommendations for grants to be made by the Commonwealth<br />
Government in support of the performing arts in the current finan-ial year<br />
This is the first year of the Council's existence and it has gi-en<br />
considerable thought to the proper function for Commonwealth support for the<br />
arts in relation to other forms of support. The Commonwealth contribution<br />
is only one among many. The arts belong to the whole communit", and<br />
support for them should come from many sources from State Governments,<br />
from local councils, from public organizations and private individuals. It is<br />
therefore to be hoped that the lead given by the Commonwealth in sponsoring<br />
the arts will encourage support at all levels throughout the Australian<br />
community. In this respect it is heartening to percei; e a growing interest<br />
by man" States in artistic matters. Solendid buildings are being erected in<br />
man" State capi-als and considerable help is beinx given to provide conditions<br />
in which the arts can flourish and Australians can take due pride in their<br />
increasing achievermentc in this field.<br />
The Council is of the opinion that its main concern as a vederal hod"<br />
should be to establish and develop high national standards which will benefit<br />
activity in the arts throughout Australia and stimulate interest abroad in<br />
Australia's cultural achievements Its concern with qualit'r is fundamental<br />
To this end the Coun-il has adopted a princile widJely accepted b7 similar<br />
bodies in other countries, that high standards can best be achieved bi a<br />
concentration of availiable funds rather than by a thin spread over a wide ar?<br />
Much of the Council's work in these earl" stages is exploratory in<br />
nature. It has establishend working comrnmittoes to seek expert opinion on its<br />
various areas of interest with a view to formulating in . he near future long<br />
range policies for Go ' ernment support for the arts in ustralia The<br />
Government understands that a report will shortly be forthcoming from the<br />
Council on the work of its film committee which has begun enquiries into<br />
means by which film making for television rma be supported<br />
The Council has received requests for assistance in manr at. egories<br />
other than the theatre arts to which its grants for this vear have been restricted<br />
It will begin enquiries as soon as possible into the need for assistance in some<br />
of these other fields and will advise the Government of its c-nclusions<br />
In announcing the Council's recommendations for 196 / 69 may I<br />
express the Government's pleasure at being associatad with activities in th.-<br />
arts which contribute so significanily to the enrichment of Australia's national<br />
life and to her reputation in other coun ries.<br />
