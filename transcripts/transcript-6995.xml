CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF NEW ASTORIA PARK VILLAGE<br />
SYDNEY 6 SEPTEMBER 1986<br />
It was w. ith great pleasure that I accepted the invitation to<br />
open this exciting new project, the New Astoria Park<br />
Exhibition village.<br />
I understand the Exhibition site contains fifteen exhibition<br />
homes all by Kimberley Homes a Product Information<br />
Centre, an office of the St George Building Society and an<br />
office of the Land Commission of New South Wales. As such,<br />
the village provides a " one stop" housing " supermarket",<br />
which places the product of the housing industry before home<br />
buyers in a new and very imaginative way. The keen interest<br />
shown in this project by the public is testament to this<br />
fact. It is also a special delight to me, as I travel around<br />
Australia, to witness in these difficult times such creative<br />
and innovative projects as the Astoria Park Village. The<br />
team approach to the development of the project a team<br />
covering building product suppliers, housing finance and<br />
land development demonstrates the ability of Australians<br />
to respond to challenges with imagination and co-operation.<br />
Australians workino together to provide innovative solutions<br />
to problems is precisely what we need today.<br />
The Australian housing industry is one of our most efficient<br />
industries. it is one of t~ z world's most efficient housing<br />
industries. Ac a result Auistralians today are amona the<br />
best housed po,' znl-in the w. l. Given that most materials<br />
used in home ccnstruction at: e made in Australia, buying a<br />
home provides rcost Australians with their greatest<br />
opportunity to. " Buy Australian". I am naturally delighted<br />
to hear that a1l buildinq r3terials used in this village are<br />
Australian built or manufactured.<br />
The pride of place of the Australian housing industry is no<br />
historical accident. Much is owed to the fine quality of<br />
Australian-made building products. Much is owed to the<br />
superiority of design in Australian housing. But above all,<br />
much is owed to the professional people in the industry:<br />
from buildert to buildinc product manufacturers to home<br />
financiers. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Because of this range of strengths, I believe the Australian<br />
housing industry has much to offer other countries,<br />
especially the rapidly-expanding countries in our own<br />
region. Rapid economic expansion typically produces a<br />
rapidly expanding demand for good housing. The Australian<br />
housing industry has " on tap" the professional people and<br />
the products to contribute to the housing development of<br />
these nearby countries. I urge participants in the<br />
Australian industry to seek out opportunities in this area.<br />
Such opportunities must be developed if this country is to<br />
trade its way out of our current economic difficulties.<br />
As a result of the large depreciation of our currency in the<br />
past 18 months we are well placed to achieve this goal. I<br />
have great ccnfidence that the housing industry will respond<br />
to such a challenge. One reason for this confidence is the<br />
effective anc fruitful working relationship that has<br />
developed between the industry and my Government over the<br />
last three and a half years. Since taking office, we have<br />
maintained a strong commitment to the housing industry. our<br />
response to changing, circumstances within the industry has<br />
been imaginative and innovative.<br />
when we came to office three and a half years ago, the<br />
industry was in a disastrous state. In 1982/ 83, private<br />
housing commencements fell a massive 25 per cent from<br />
123,600 to 92,300: one of the worst slumps on record. many<br />
thousands of jobs were lost to the industry, contributing to<br />
the, sharp rise in overall unemploym'ent in that year. There<br />
was also a sharp increase in " unsatisfied demand" in the<br />
industry, which had a high cost in social and personal<br />
terms.<br />
My Qovernment acted promptly to restore prosperity to the<br />
industry. We introduced the imaginative First Home Owners<br />
Scheme on 1 October 1983. The scheme was designed with the<br />
particular needs of young couples buying their first homes<br />
in mind. These people typically have lower than average<br />
incomes and limited savings, and therefore faced a<br />
considerable hurdle i. n purchasing their first home.<br />
The First Home Owners scheme has been an outstanding<br />
success. In its first nine months of operation a period<br />
endino on 30 June 1984 55,000 applicants were assisted<br />
under th-Scheme, ar cost to the Budget in 1983/ 84 of $ 141<br />
millicn. initial e.'-ectations of the demand for assistance<br />
were excesed by al! 77st 50 percent. In 1984,./ 85, a further<br />
87,000 aprl.-cants w. ere assisted, and on-going assistance was<br />
provided to previously successful applicants. The<br />
Governmeznt's financial commitment to the Scheme continued at<br />
a very 1. iah level in 1985/ 86.<br />
Spending is e;: pected to fall somewhat this year, mainly<br />
because the initial popularity of the Scheme produced an<br />
early bunching of applications. However, there was no<br />
change to the eligibility requirements for assistance under<br />
FHOS in anecessarily very tough Budget last month. </p>
<p>The introduction of FHOS contributed substantially to the<br />
dramatic recovery in private housing activity. Private<br />
housing commencements rose by a massive 33 per cent in<br />
1983/ 84 and a further 13 percent in 1984/ 85. Employment in<br />
the industr7y has boomed, with some 50,000 jobs being created<br />
during the recovery.<br />
The problems which FHOS was developed to solve abated as the<br />
housing recovery gathered momentum. However, new problems,<br />
requiring neai solutions, emerged for the industry last year.<br />
Once again, the Government responded with positive,<br />
imaginative action.<br />
The Government was not prepared to stand by and see a total<br />
reversal of all that we had worked so hard to achieve in the<br />
industry over the previous three years. So in April of this<br />
year, we introduced a package of measures representing a<br />
timely and lasting response to the housing finance shortage.<br />
The main elements of the package were removal of the ceiling<br />
on new savings bank home loans and provision of a $ 145 m<br />
subsidy over twelve months to restore the competitive<br />
position of savings banks in the deposit market. But an<br />
essential element of the package was that the ceiling would<br />
remain in place for existing loans, so that those with bank<br />
mortgages approved prior to the package continue to receive<br />
the protection provided by the 13.5 per cent ceiling.<br />
In addition savings banks made a commitment to lend $ 6<br />
billion over the following year, a dramatic increase on what<br />
was in prospect. And banks have agree~ d to increase their<br />
effort to provide innovative lending packages tailored to<br />
meet the needs of those on moderate incomes.'<br />
The Government's package has clearly been a success.<br />
Deposit nflow has been rebuilt. Housing lending is<br />
proceeding at a rate well in excess of the annual target of<br />
$ 6 billion. All banks have increased lending under low<br />
start loan packages, which are tailored to meet the needs of<br />
lower income earners.<br />
To date the package has worked well. The Government sees no<br />
reascn to alter it at this stage.<br />
In addition my , vernment has provided a massive and<br />
sustained incrE-~ se in the Commonwealth's commitment to<br />
pulzIlc housir:. Funds available in 1986-87 under the CSHA<br />
( and under the low interest Loan Council nomination<br />
arranoements) are 86 per cent higher than in 1982-83. The<br />
result, has been a large increase in public housing<br />
cornmencemcnts: the annual average number of commencements<br />
during our first three years was 46 per cent higher than<br />
that of the last three years of the previous Government.<br />
Other housing initiatives we have taken include support for<br />
efforts to achieve a more cost-effective building regulatory<br />
environment and promote more flexible approaches to<br />
residential land development. Extra funding-has been<br />
provided in this Budget for a number of innovative programs<br />
in this area. </p>
<p>4.<br />
All of our housing initiatives bear the hallmarks of the<br />
Government's approach to problem solving: problems are<br />
faced directly and tackled with imagination and creativity.<br />
we do not bury our heads in the sand. Further, we believe<br />
strongly in a " team" approach, where governments do not act<br />
alone, but consult widely, in designing and implementing<br />
solutions. In conclusion, alight I say how glad I am to see how much has<br />
been achieved, and is still being achieved, in the<br />
Australian housing industry. Achievements built upon the<br />
imaginative and forward looking attitudes of those thousands<br />
of Australians working in the industry. Achievements built<br />
upon fruitful co-operation between government and industry.<br />
Achievements examplified by this exciting new Exhibition<br />
village. The housing industry is an example to us all of<br />
the problem solving, innovative approach so sorely needed in<br />
this country today. When I see that Australians working<br />
together are ca ' pable of achievements such as this, I know<br />
the problems we face will be overcome. </p>
