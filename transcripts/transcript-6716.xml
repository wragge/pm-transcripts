    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>11 September 1985</strong></p>
<p>I have been asked about reports of the settlement of the terms of the contract of the former General Manager of the Australian Bicentennial Authority, Dr David Armstrong.  In recent weks I have had several discussions with the Chairman of the ABA, Mr John Reid, about both specific criticism of the ABA and the plans that were being made for the 1988 celebrations.</p>
<p>After those discussions took place, Mr Reid and Dr Armstrong concluded that the interests of the ABA would be best served if Dr Armstrong were to leave its service. Tfle negotiations of the terms of settlement of that departure was as it had<br />to be under the terms of the legislation -establishing the ABA entirely a matter between the Chairman and Dr Armstrong. I have no comment to add about those terms.</p>
