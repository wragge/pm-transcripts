    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>11 September 1985</strong></p>
<p>I have been asked about reports of the settlement of theÂ terms of the contract of the former General Manager of theÂ Australian Bicentennial Authority, Dr David Armstrong. Â In recent weks I have had several discussions with theÂ Chairman of the ABA, Mr John Reid, about both specificÂ criticism of the ABA and the plans that were being made forÂ the 1988 celebrations.</p>
<p>After those discussions took place, Mr Reid and Dr ArmstrongÂ concluded that the interests of the ABA would be best servedÂ if Dr Armstrong were to leave its service. Tfle negotiationsÂ of the terms of settlement of that departure was as it had<br />to be under the terms of the legislation -establishing the ABA entirelyÂ a matter between the Chairman and Dr Armstrong.Â I have no comment to add about those terms.</p>
