OIL, GAS AM~ NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT<br />
This paper is an abridged version of the speech<br />
by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Harold Holt,<br />
to a conference of the Australian Petroleum<br />
Exploration Association in Sydney on Monday,<br />
13th March, 1967.<br />
The speech sets the Government's record and policy<br />
in the sea-rch', for oil and gas in the context of its<br />
broad policies for the promotion of national<br />
development, and deals with recent criticism of<br />
certain aspects of its oil search policy.<br />
The speech is supported by two documents to which<br />
reference was matde by the Prime Minister:-<br />

<p>OIL, GAS AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT<br />
TO THE AUSTRALIAN PETROLEUM EXPLORATION ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE<br />
13TH ACH, 196<br />
Let me first say that I am fully conecious of the<br />
tremendous importance to Australia of an efficient, well-conducted<br />
and successful petroleum exploration and development industry.<br />
The petroleum industry provides an increasingly significant part<br />
of our total energy needs. It employs directly and indirectly an<br />
important percentage of our-population. Without petroleum, life<br />
as we know it today would be, if not impossible, then certainly<br />
very different. Fortunately, there is not much risk of a world shortage<br />
of petrol. Why then, it is often asked, should we spend so much<br />
effort in Australia in looking for more?<br />
First, demand is rising at the rate of about 10% o a year<br />
in Australia and 9% a year world-wide. Unless new reserves are<br />
being found, over-supply could turn to shortage. Second, there is<br />
always a risk that our supplies could be interrupted by events over<br />
which we have no control. It is prudent to have our own resources.<br />
Third, local supplies would help our balance of payments very much.<br />
Petroleum is our third largest import, following machinery and<br />
chemicals. In 1$ 65-66 we imported 4,854 million gallons valued<br />
f. o. b. at about $ 250 million. There are very great national rewards<br />
if wie can replace much of these imports with local petroleum.<br />
Although the quest for petroleum began in 1892 in the<br />
Coorong area of South Australia, it only commenced seriously in<br />
the years following World War II. Senior officers of the<br />
Commonwealth Bureau of Mineral Resources were among the few who<br />
maintained, despite general disbelief, that a major search was<br />
warranted. The Bureau began basic geological and geophysical<br />
mapping of the Australian sedimentary basin and we, as a<br />
Government, felt that here was a national speculation that was<br />
justified in the national interest.<br />
When Rough Range failed to show significant resources<br />
after the find in 1953, the search had reached a. low ebb by 1958.<br />
The Government, concerned at this decline in interest, introduced<br />
a Petroleum Search Subsidy Act to stimulate company enterprise and<br />
to make generally available the knowledge so gained of the geology<br />
of the basins. We also felt that the Act would demonstrate a<br />
favourable political attitude to petroleum soarch-that would<br />
encourage experienced overseas companies to join in. The Act<br />
has been extended from time to time and is currently effective<br />
until June this year.<br />
In the ten years of its life the subsidy scheme has<br />
stimulated exploration and led to the discovery of oil and gas<br />
in a number of areas in and around Australia.<br />
Active exploration geological, geophysical and drillinghas<br />
been undertaken in the 25 major basins of likely petroleumbearing<br />
sediments. These cover some 1.7 of tho 3.2 million square<br />
miles of land surface of Australia and Papua New Guinea and, about<br />
0.6 of the 1 million square miles of the continental shelf. Total<br />
expenditure by companies and by the Commonwealth and State<br />
Governments to the end of 1966 was about 420 million, but<br />
established reserves total only about 200 million barrels of oil.<br />
We consumed in one year, 1965-66, a total ol 139 million barrels.<br />
Thus our known reserves arc still less than two year's importation.<br />
So you see we still have a lonSg, long way to go on the road to<br />
self-sufficiency, / 2o </p>
<p>2-<br />
While the discoveries of natural gas will result in<br />
cheaper domestic and industrial heating in some areas natural<br />
gas is ready to pay handsome dividends in some localities in<br />
Australia some of the markets are at a considerable distance<br />
from the supply. It is therefore desirable that the search<br />
should continue in an attempt to locate other fields in closer<br />
proximity to the markets. Incidentally, the current cost of<br />
finding oil in Au tralia of $ 2 a barrel compares very favourably,<br />
I understand, with American and Canadian costs.<br />
Apart from the Subsidy Act, the Commonwealth Government<br />
has provided various inducements and basic technical services in<br />
order to create a favourable climate in which private enterprise<br />
* will provide the greater part of the expenditure required and be<br />
responsible for detailed exploration, development and exploitation.<br />
We clearly recognise the need to maintain continuing incontives.<br />
in this field, and I can safely assure you that the general<br />
attitude of my own Government is to recognise the difficulties<br />
the industry faces because of the long term character of its<br />
investment and the freaks of development wnich are a feature<br />
of the oil industry.<br />
The principle measures taken by the Commonwealth<br />
Government, with which you are all familiar, include taxation<br />
concessions, subsidies to exploration companies, basic surveys and<br />
investigations in the field and laboratory by the Bureau of<br />
Mineral Resources, other forms of assistance such as relief<br />
from duty for essential equipment, accelerated map production<br />
by the Department of National Development and the assistance<br />
of highly qualified consultants.<br />
Despite all this there has recently been a definite<br />
pause in the rate of exploration due to an absence of significant<br />
discoveries of new areas on-shore and delays in obtaining rigs<br />
to drill structural areas off-shore. This latter problem w. ill<br />
be largely overcome late in 1967 when five and possibly six rigs<br />
will be drilling on our continental shelf. As Sir Ian McLenian<br />
has said, the production activity of these rigs, and other<br />
by-products of the mineral oil exploration programme, affect<br />
the economy over a wide range of activities.<br />
I was appreciative of what Sir Ian McLerman had to say<br />
about the co-operative and helpful attitude he had found in the<br />
Governments concerned in his negotiations this, of course, is as<br />
it should be. There have been extensive Comi_. onwealth/ State<br />
discussions on the proposed off-shore legislation, and the<br />
Governments concerned have given their careful consideration to<br />
the views expressed by the companies engaged in off-shore operations.<br />
The object of the Governments has been to reach agreement on a<br />
legislative scheme that would give certainty of title to operators<br />
in off-shore areas who undertake to bear very high expenditures,<br />
and at the same time to avoid wasteful and costly litigation of<br />
a kind which has beset the United States for many years and is<br />
now starting to show up in Canada. We confidently expect that<br />
our legislation will be brought before the Parliament during the<br />
course of this year.<br />
Much interest in the continental shelf has been generated<br />
by the discovery of large supplies of natural gas. Although<br />
natural gas provides only one-hundredth part of one per cent of<br />
Australia's primary energy market, this share could increase to<br />
as much as 10% within a few years. The change from one energy<br />
source to another is an expensive step, but where it can be shown<br />
that it is in the interest of the Australian people to make a<br />
change, my Government will view constructively and in a helpful<br />
spirit any scheme suggested. I am happy to say that through the<br />
Australian Loan Council we have been able to arrange for the<br />
necessary funds to cover the $ 40 million cost of piping gas to<br />
Adelaide. / 3. </p>
<p>-3<br />
As a background to the changes which your own industry<br />
is bringing to Australia's groviin6 economy, let me mention that<br />
there are now 60,000 factories in Australia double the number<br />
at he beginning of World War II. Employment in these factories<br />
represents an increase of 125% since 1939. Manufacturing now<br />
absorbs 28% of our viaork force and contributes 13%; of the value<br />
of our total exports and that peroentage is tending to increase.<br />
We are now exporting to countries some products which we formerly<br />
imported, including steel to the United States and the United<br />
Kingdom. Our manufacturing nowadays includes some highly<br />
sophisticated products like radio-tele phone eqjuipment,<br />
transistorised airways beacons, the pilotless jet aircraft<br />
Jindivik, the anti-submarine ge-uided missile Ikara and the<br />
anti-tank guided weapon Malkara. These have all found markets<br />
abroad. Another aspect of the changing economic patternreflecting<br />
largely the impact of petroleum and mineral<br />
developments is -the emergence of new towns. Though small<br />
in size, the contribution to national development, and in<br />
particular to development of the north of such towns as Weipa,<br />
Dampier, Mount Tom Price, Gove and Barrow Island, will become<br />
increasingly important as time goes by. This is decentralisation<br />
in a practical way stemming from private industry developments.<br />
We recognise that there is a role for Governments in all this,<br />
but Australia has benefited, and will benefit increasingly in<br />
the years ahead, from the practical decentralisation of activity<br />
and industry occurring through these private industrial<br />
developments, and others like them.<br />
Vast quantities of capital are required for these<br />
projects and in the main this is being found by the firms<br />
themselves. Nevertheless, Government action has contributed<br />
much to the mineral development of the north. Direct financial<br />
contributions totalling 44 million have been made by the<br />
Government towards the Townsville-Mount Isa Railway, the<br />
Gladstone coal loader, the Weipa wharf and township, the Darwin<br />
wharf and railway facilities in the Northern Territory. The<br />
Commonwealth Government has also arranged that, in addition to<br />
the mining activity in the Gove bauxite deposits, processing<br />
to alumina will take place in the Northern Territory. The<br />
Burezu. of Mineral Resources has, in fact, spent 80% of its<br />
annual budget of nearly $ 5.4 million on securing basic data<br />
on mineral resources in Northern Australia.<br />
In all these ways, the Government is helping to shape<br />
the new pattern of economic activity. Vie can also help by<br />
providing a favourable climate for decentralisation, and this<br />
applies in particular to your own industry through the economic<br />
and general policies we pursue. An illustration that comes<br />
quickly to mind oli practical help to areas remote from the cities<br />
is the legislation that brought the price of petrol for people<br />
outside the city areas to a level close to city prices. Other<br />
measures include the amounts to be expended on rural roads under<br />
the Commonwealth Aid Road legislation, the activities ol' my<br />
colleague, the Postmaster-General in ensuring that television<br />
services stretch out as widely as possible, the decentralisation<br />
of air services and the provision of other amenities.<br />
From what I have already said, you will appreciate that<br />
mining and oil development are but a part of the overall story.<br />
May I mention particularly the recent publication brought out<br />
under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for National<br />
Development. It costs only $ 2 and shows the major development<br />
work under construction in Australia at the end of June last<br />
year to have a value on completion~ of $ 2,327 million. By any<br />
standard this is a huge investment programme with a nation of<br />
less than 12. million people and the to-tal does not include *. 04 </p>
<p>-4<br />
such things as expenditure on housing, hospitals and education<br />
facilities or the Commonwealth's $ 600 million expenditure on<br />
the Snowy Scheme. The publication shows that we now have in<br />
hand investment and developments amounting to some $ 20G0 a head<br />
of our population. New arrangements and facilities for the provision of<br />
capital will need to be devised to help finance this and new<br />
developments, and we have been working actively and earnestly<br />
on the problem for some time. We are confident that we will<br />
find a practical means to achieve this objective.<br />
Nobody living in this country so subject to the haeards<br />
of the seasons and risk of drought, flood or fire, can expect<br />
that the course ahead is ever likely to be easy. But we believe<br />
our plans are soundly laid and that the political and economic<br />
stability we are maintaining is one of the strongest incentive-a<br />
for investment in Australia and provides a favourable environment<br />
for development and growth.<br />
Before I conclude, perhaps I should deal a little more<br />
specifically wftth some of the matters that weore raised by your<br />
Chairman, Mr. Earl Abbott in his thoughtful and extremely<br />
interesting speech. The most serious point I want to take up<br />
with you is the question of the availability of Governments for<br />
consultation. I have no hesitation in stating that there is no<br />
agreement whatsoever among the Governments conccrned that they<br />
will not consult w--ith the industry. Indeed, there have been<br />
several consultations, and I have taken part in two of them<br />
myself. To mention only the more recent occasions, there were<br />
three meetings with the industry last year in Febru~ ary, June<br />
and August, as well as a number of written exchanges.<br />
At the meeting in Febru~ ary there were lengthy discussions<br />
between senior Commonwealth and State officers and representatives<br />
of eleven off-shore companies, many of whom are prominent members<br />
of APEA. At a meeting of Commonwealth Ministers in June, the<br />
. APEA request for permission to send a deputation was granted and<br />
in August five senior Commonwyealth Ministers received a further<br />
deputation which presented a written case and took several hours<br />
in explaining its point of view and discussing it. I therefore<br />
think it is fair to say that the Government has given the APEA<br />
wide opportunity to present its views: it has certainly taken<br />
these into account in determining its policies, and will continue<br />
to do so. Far from our adopting policies which would discourage<br />
the industry or kill the goose that we hope will lay us many<br />
golden eggs, it is our object to assist it in its tasks and to<br />
encourage it to go ahead with its investment, exploration and<br />
development. I did have it in mind to go in some detail into the<br />
percentage of " take" by Governments in Australio. and how this<br />
compares with the percentages in other countries. For lack of<br />
time, I now just want to make it clear th-it we do not accept<br />
and this has been the matter of a quite thorough study the<br />
table of percentages which have been publicly presented as a<br />
basis of comparison for the Australian " 1take" l and that of<br />
countries overseas. Rather than weary you with going over the<br />
ground again, may I direct your attention to the press statement<br />
of 27th January which went out from my colleague, thIe Treasurer.<br />
It is admittedly difficult to find a realistic basis for comparison<br />
between the tax st-ructures of the different countries, but we<br />
have to recognise that the responsible Commionwealth and State<br />
Governments have an entitlement to a proportion oZ the return<br />
from the exploitation of our natural resources, just as have<br />
those who hazard their capital and skill in the effort. These<br />
things are all in our consciousness and I would hope that the<br />
experience of the industry generally can be that we will always<br />
be seeking good co-operation between Government and industry in<br />
the exciting task of the development of our couintry and its resources. </p>
<p>APPENDIIX A<br />
OFF-SHOIL OIL AIT GAS:<br />
ROYALTIES AND TAX<br />
by<br />
The Rt. Hon. William McMahon, Mi. P.<br />
Treasurer of the Cormmonwealth<br />
of Australia<br />
The petroleum industry has claimed th. t the Government<br />
" take" ( royalty plus income tax) in Australia in the proposed<br />
joint off-shore petroleum legislation by the Cormmonwealth and<br />
the States will be higher than in five of the six other countries<br />
with recent off-shore legislation. The comparative figures that<br />
have been quoted are:-Govt. " take" as percentage<br />
Country of " divisTble profit ( a)<br />
United Kingdom 50.4 per cent<br />
Denmar 45.8<br />
Germany 50.6<br />
Norway 55.2<br />
France 47.72<br />
United States 46.8<br />
Australia 52.8<br />
on a " present-day value" basis.<br />
These figures do not give a true picture the .' orth of<br />
the figures depends heavily on:-<br />
a) the basis on which the calculations of " present-day<br />
values" of " divisible profits" have been made.<br />
( These calculations involve the estimating of gross<br />
sales proceeds and capital and operating production<br />
costs over a given future long-term period, and the<br />
reduction of the resulting figures to a present-day<br />
alue basis by the application of a miscount interest<br />
rate); and<br />
b) the assumptions used in the measurement of the incidence<br />
of income taxation in the respective countries.<br />
The information that has been provided on how the<br />
figures are compiled is very meagre. The starting point is an<br />
a-sumption that, on a present-day value basis, gross sales<br />
procee-s will be double capital and operating production costs<br />
in the case of all the countries mentioned.<br />
This is obviously a very generalised assumption; it<br />
certainly cannot be accepted without question so far as Australia<br />
is concerned. The period and discount interest rate used in<br />
the calculation of the present-'. ay value figures have not been<br />
indicated and the use of different periods and different interest<br />
rates can produce vastly diiferent results in terms of comparative<br />
present-day values.<br />
It is not suificient only to look at tax rates; the<br />
comparisons must have regrd to the taxation laws as a whole of<br />
/ 2. </p>
<p>2-<br />
those countries. These laws differ considerably in relation to<br />
deductions allowable and the time when those deductions may be<br />
claimed. The tax figures include'. in th.. calc.. lasion of the<br />
quoted percelnt. es for the other countries y be significantly<br />
understated in some cases while the tax fiui. es included in thcalculation<br />
of the ciuote, Australian percentage, o_ the other<br />
hand, seem to be substantially overstated. This is because the<br />
figures take no account of the special deductions allowable under<br />
our income tax lawswhich are designed to free the proceeds from<br />
the sale of petroleum and its products f. om income tax until all<br />
allowable capital expenditure has been f'-lly recouped.<br />
If in tihe present-day value calculations allowance<br />
were made for thic feature of Australian incoime tax law, the<br />
tax figures included in the Australian calculation would be<br />
considerably reduced perhaps even to the point where the figure<br />
for the Australian government " take" would fall below the<br />
percentage figures quoted for other countries.<br />
The only comparison that can be made of any ral<br />
meaning is between rates of royalty and these represent only<br />
o.. e area of government involvement. For instance, the Commonwealth<br />
Government has given special stimulus and assistance to oil<br />
search, at times when the risks are highest by the petroleum<br />
search subsidy scheme, under which the Commonwealth has already<br />
paid out or committed a total of $ 59.6 million; by making<br />
capital subscribed to an oil exploration company by Australian<br />
resident shareholders fully tax deductible, and by fixing a<br />
special incentive price for five years from 1965 for crude oil<br />
produced in Australia.<br />
The standard royalty rate of IO' 1 in th.. proposed joint<br />
off-shore legislation is relatively on international standards.<br />
It compares with rates of 16-2/ 3o and 12-1% generally applicable in<br />
off-shore a;. eas in the Unitea States and the United Kingdom<br />
respectively. IFurt. iermore the industry has been treated more generously<br />
in this country with the proposed legislation on the sizes of<br />
exploration and production areas. Canberra<br />

<p>APPEMIX B<br />
AN USTALIN LOKSAT PETROLEUM EXLORATION<br />
by<br />
Sir Ian McLennan<br />
Managing Director of B. H. P. Co. Ltd.<br />
Petroleum exploration activities in Australia represent<br />
a unique combination of local and foreign private enterprise,<br />
activities combined with effective and practical Government<br />
support in tangible form.<br />
Expenditure on petroleum exploration in Australia had<br />
reached a total of some $ 370 million by December 1965 o * f which<br />
$ 234 million had been spent in thce last 10 years. The current<br />
rate of expenditure is of the order of $ 60 $ 70 million per<br />
annum. These figures are substantial, even alongside the<br />
Snowy Mountains scheme where approximately $ 600 million has<br />
been spent at the rato of $ 40 $ 50 million a year, and the<br />
steel industry where 4794 million has been spent in the last<br />
years. The $ 370 million spent to December, 1965 -was made<br />
up this way:-<br />
Funds provided by Private Enterprise $ 294 million<br />
Dircct Government Subsidies 42<br />
Other direct Commonwealth and<br />
State Expenditure S 34<br />
This is enlightening and shows that while Governments<br />
do play a significant role iLi the matter of subsidies, direct<br />
expenditure and by other incentives, it is still for private<br />
enterprise, to the greatest extent, to provide the necessary<br />
stimulus, funds anC. 1 know how.<br />
The. re is, of course, a further groat stimulus provided<br />
by the Commonwealth Government in the form of relief from taxation,<br />
but I know of no way of putting a precise figure to this.<br />
A ba: cakdown of the $ 70.8 million spent on petroleum<br />
exploration activities during 1965 shows that the major investment<br />
was by overseas organisations which accounted for $ 34.3 million,<br />
followed by Australian private enterprise inves-umont and re-investment<br />
amounting to $ 21.6 million, Goverimrent subsidy of $ 10.4 million<br />
and Direct Government expenditure of approximately $ 4.5 million.<br />
One oi. the intangibles which has not been listed in<br />
the expenditures, but which is very real, is the value which should<br />
be placed on the experience represented by the pkersonnel engaged<br />
in such activities, anc.-the influence that they can exert to see<br />
that Ghe money is spent wisely.<br />
In the field of off-shore legislation in particular<br />
therc. have been many international and constitutional problems<br />
to overcome and many points of view to consider.<br />
This is not just a simple government/ industry relations<br />
problem. Both govern,.ñ ent and ind ustry are working together in<br />
an uncharted field and the degree ol' progress and mutual understanding<br />
is heartening. o </p>
<p>2-<br />
There is intense world wide competition for capital<br />
for petroleum exploration and the development of petroleum<br />
production capacity. Other countries may offer certcin incentives<br />
in the competition for such capital but in the overall analysis<br />
Australia has a great deal to offer.<br />
The development of the large super tanker and of<br />
pipeline transportation have done much to ease our joint problems<br />
of isolation and small local markets.<br />
In the local scene, Australia is rapidly becoming<br />
industrialised, and its population mobile, with a high standard<br />
of living and increasing demands for energy. Our energy resourees<br />
in black and brown coal are quite significant, but the growth<br />
factor is in the field of readily transportable energy. The<br />
sources of primary energy, for the statistical year 1965-66,<br />
expressed in tons of black coal equivalent, arc:-<br />
Coal 48.7%<br />
Petroleum 44.2%<br />
Firewood 1. 4%<br />
Hydro electric power 5.7%<br />
This clearly shows the importance of potroloum'in the energy<br />
market. Therj are areas whore competition exists between these<br />
sources of primary energy, particularly in power generation and<br />
perhaps in some types of industrial market, and the natural forces<br />
of competition will give each source its place in the market.<br />
However, ther are major sections of the energy market<br />
where the alternative types oi fuel are not interchangeable and<br />
one result is the rapidly increasing demand for energy in the<br />
form of petroleum. The petroleum industry is well aware of the continual<br />
expansion of the demands for its products. In the United States,<br />
for example, the 61% share of the total energy requirements of<br />
the United States helu by oil and natural gas in 1950 rose to<br />
76% by 1965. In Western Europe, the share rose from 15% in<br />
1950 to 52% in 1965 with an expected increase to 72% in 1975.<br />
Is there any doubt that Australia's energy requirements<br />
will follow similar trends?<br />
In Australia we offer stability of Government and have<br />
Governiments fully alive to the advantages which can accrue from<br />
the development of a local petroleum industry. I woul. emphasise<br />
the intangible incentives that stable Government offers, notwithstanding<br />
the va, r ious shades of Government opinion.<br />
The lack of restrictions placed on foreign investment<br />
in Australia, compared with restrictions, both written and<br />
unwritten, which the petroleum exploration and production<br />
industry has encountered elsewhere, reflects an enlightened<br />
Australian attituLe offering considerable encouragement.<br />
In matters such as taxation, remittance abroad of<br />
earnings and repatriation of capital, the attitude of the Commonwealth<br />
Government and the various authorities concerned can only be<br />
cla. sified as highly co-operative. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
From time to time there may be some criticism levelled<br />
at remittance abroad of earnings and repatriation of capital in<br />
the case of foreign controlled organisations, but usually such<br />
criticism is saved up for those organisations which are succes-ful.<br />
However, there isno doubt, on the ether side of such criticism,<br />
a whole-hearted respect for such organisations and a realisation<br />
of their value to a country like ours.<br />
One very important aspect of Government policies, is no<br />
discrimination between national and foreign ownership in the<br />
application of laws and regulations. Another incentive to the<br />
petroleum exploration industry for continual and expanded<br />
exploration in Australia is tE potential that exists.<br />
Our own experience in petroleum exploration has shown<br />
that a painstaking and detailed step by step programme under<br />
expert and experienced guidance with adequate resources in<br />
capital and know-ho a, can result in discoveries and also maintain<br />
a high proportion of local equity.<br />
I would not venture to predict the anticipated ratio. of<br />
success in both continental and off. shore exploration in Australia,<br />
but I imagine you will all agree that the potential for further<br />
discoveries in the Australian area is good.<br />
I am not sure if we ar doing all we can in Australia<br />
to take full advantage of this petroleum age and our educational<br />
activities will need to be developed further so that our y-ung<br />
people can play their full part in just the same way as they<br />
have in the development of our other industries. We need<br />
geologists, chemicel engineers, construction engineers, physicists,<br />
chemists, and so on, all oriented in their training toward. s the<br />
petroleum industry.<br />
The coming of the petroleum exploration industry and<br />
its prospect of success has brought other developments to Australia<br />
which would not have been contemplated even a few years ago.<br />
Who would have thought that the State Dockyard at<br />
Newcastle would have played a major part in reconstructing an<br />
off-shore drilling rig and who would have thought that at Whyalla<br />
we would be constructing a semi-submersible rig of the most<br />
highly sophisticated nature using very largely Australian raw<br />
materials and Australian people?<br />
The imported content of this rig will be confined to<br />
specialised machinery not made in this country. Further, it is<br />
hoped that soon we will be building platforms for erection in<br />
Bass Strait ; and already there has gone into operation at Port<br />
Kembla a new tube mill capable of producing the very high grade<br />
pipes necessary for gas and oil distribution. These are just some<br />
of the things that have happened and others of course may well<br />
occur and are in fact already under way.<br />
So far very little incone h-. s bjcn derived inAustralia<br />
from petroleum activities. It is all with an eye to the future<br />
and it is most heartening indeed that there arc so many people<br />
prepared to " chance their arm" in an ondeavour to bring the great<br />
benefits of oil and natural gas production to this country.<br />
Surely they deserve their just rewards if success comes<br />
their way. It is essential that these rewards be there to provide<br />
incentive for further exploration because up to the present we<br />
have only scratched the surface. 13th March, 1967. </p>
