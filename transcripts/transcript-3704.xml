PRIME MINISTER I<br />
Press Statement No. 494<br />
April 1975<br />
COMMISSION FOR CONSUMER AFFAIRS<br />
The Australian Government has decided to establish<br />
a Commission for Consumer Affairs to co-ordinate consumer<br />
standards and handle public education on consumer matters.<br />
The Commission will be an independent statutory<br />
authority responsible to the Minister for Science,<br />
Mr Bill Morrison. It will develop consumer product standards and<br />
information standards for promulgation under the Trade<br />
Practices Act.<br />
The Commission will provide a focal point for<br />
consumer groups and industry in their dealings with the<br />
Australian Government on consumer matters. It is also<br />
charged with liaison with State Government consumer<br />
affairs bodies. In formulating standards, it will co-ordinate<br />
the work of the various expert standing committees such<br />
as the Food Standards Committee of the National Health<br />
and Medical Research Council. The Department of Health<br />
will retain responsibility for therapeutic drug standards.<br />
The Commission for Consumer Affairs will be<br />
headed by a Commissioner who will have Permanent Head<br />
status. There will be a part-time Advisory Consumer<br />
Council comprising representatives of the Australian<br />
and State public services, consumer and manufacturing<br />
industry organisations, educational institutions and<br />
trade unions. Where necessary, the Commission will hold public<br />
hearings on the preparation of consumer standards.<br />
