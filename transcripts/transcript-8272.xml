PRIME MINIST-4<br />
CHECK AGAINST IYERX ENBARCOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL FUTURES GROUP<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE -14 MARCH 1991<br />
When I delivered my Statement to Parliament on Tuesday,<br />
' Building a Competitive Australia', I announced decisions of<br />
fundamental economic importance for the future of this<br />
country. I am proud to emphasise the crucial leadership role my<br />
Government hat; played through decisions such as these -in<br />
setting the riLght policy framework over the past eight<br />
years. But I stressed on Tuesday -and I take this opportunity of<br />
repeating today that success in securing our future<br />
ultimately lie~ s in the hands of each one of us.<br />
I said that it would only be with the understanding of all<br />
Australians as individuals and through their<br />
representative organisations that our nation will best<br />
meet the chall. enges ahead.<br />
When, for exanmple, we speak of creating a ' clever country'<br />
we speak of a transformation that can be initiated, but that<br />
certainly cannot be imposed, by Government.<br />
A truly clever country is one in which each one of us is<br />
equipped with the skills necessary to work productively in a<br />
modern economy. Unless we are prepared to mobilise this<br />
most valuable of all national resources our human<br />
resources we will surely not be able to become a clever<br />
country. What is true in this general sense for the economic future<br />
of this country is equally true in securing the future of<br />
our environment.<br />
When I issued my 1989 Environment Statement -' Our Country,<br />
Our Future' I said that ' its announcements, while<br />
comprehensive and vitally important, would not themselves<br />
see the job done.' Practical action is required. At the </p>
<p>simplest level, it means Government and individuals must use<br />
resources more carefully.<br />
One of the very heartening aspects of Australian life today<br />
is the way in which individuals and families are learning to<br />
recycle many products in everyday household use, such as<br />
newspapers and glass bottles.<br />
We have adopted as an interim planning target the aim of<br />
reducing greenhouse gases by 20 per cent by the year* 2005.<br />
Whether we attain that goal, too, depends on whether we can<br />
modify the behaviour patterns of industries and individual<br />
consumers throughout the nation.<br />
I am proud of my Government's environment record. But as<br />
I've said several times in the past about issues such as<br />
greenhouse emissions, Governments alone cannot take all the<br />
action required.<br />
However, I recognise that Governments must provide a lead,<br />
and act as a role model. And the extent to which the<br />
Government is prepared to lead by example, through better<br />
environmental practices, will be a key determinant in the<br />
community's willingness to continue such activity.<br />
Today, I welcome the initiative of my colleague Senator Nick<br />
Bolkus in establishing the Environmental Futures Group. The<br />
Group will identify areas where the Department of<br />
Administrative Services can make practical contributions<br />
towards a better environment and advise on how it can lead<br />
by example.<br />
The Department of Administrative Services, through the<br />
Environmental Futures Group, can encourage the use of more<br />
environmentally friendly products and energy saving measures<br />
within both its own administration and the Commonwealth as a<br />
whole. It can also encourage environmental values in<br />
industry for example, the building and construction<br />
industries with which Nick's Department is closely involved.<br />
Other advances can be made, through Government purchasing<br />
policies, by giving preference to products that are both<br />
price competitive and environmentally friendly,' and by<br />
encouraging the production of goods and services in an<br />
environmentally sensitive manner.<br />
It will be some time before we will see a dividend from our<br />
efforts. But it is important to maintain our resolve.<br />
Changes are necessary at many levels of society for<br />
Australia to make substantial progress towards a better<br />
environment. We must educate Australians and Australian<br />
organisations to understand their responsibilities and how<br />
they can make a positive contribution.<br />
In all this, the Environmental Futures Group will have a<br />
critical role to play. </p>
<p>3.<br />
I am particularly impressed to see that the members of the<br />
Group are drawn from diverse backgrounds. I congratulate<br />
George Negus and his team on taking up this challenge.<br />
Their willingness to involve themselves in this endeavour<br />
shows their commitment to our environment, and to the sort<br />
of. community action which will be so valuable in the effort<br />
to protect our environment. I wish them well in their work. </p>
