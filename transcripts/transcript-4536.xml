PRIME U INISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 9 NOV' 1; r. IBER 1977<br />
WHALE PRESERVATION AND CONSERVATION<br />
The Australian Government, along with the International Whaling<br />
Commission, follows a policy designed to achieve the preservation<br />
and conservation of the many species of whales.<br />
Australia has been in the vanguard in instituting procedures<br />
which have, over the past ten years, already achieved a<br />
moratorium on the taking of many species.<br />
As a result of action initiated at the I. W. C. meeting in June,<br />
the Cheynes* Beach whaling licence has been renewed for one year.<br />
This action was taken on the basis of scientific advice.<br />
However, because the Government is very much concerned about<br />
the preservation of whales now, and in the future, an<br />
independent inquiry will be appointed as soon as the Government<br />
returns to office after the elections.<br />
The inquiry will advise on the best way in which Australia<br />
might continue to pursue the preservation and conservation<br />
of the many species of whales. It will be asked to advise<br />
whether the present course of action, that is, control through<br />
the International Whaling Commission, is in the best interests<br />
of preserving all whale species. </p>
