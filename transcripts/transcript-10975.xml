<p>Hello. Next month when Parliament meets again, the Parliament will</p>
<p> resubmit its Native Title Amendment Bill. We have to do this because</p>
<p> last year, the Senate put some amendments in it which are quite unacceptable.</p>
<p> I hope that on this occasion we can get the Bill through and we can</p>
<p> do what I think most Australians want and put this difficult issue</p>
<p> behind us.</p>
<p>Amending the Native Title Act is very important to regional and rural</p>
<p> Australia. What we have proposed is a fair balance respecting the</p>
<p> rights of Aboriginal people, farmers, miners and the rest of the community.</p>
<p> The Senate has insisted on some amendments which are quite unreasonable</p>
<p> and the worst of the amendments insisted on by the Senate relates</p>
<p> to the so-called rights to negotiate. You see, what the Senate is</p>
<p> doing is saying that one section of the community, one group of Australians,</p>
<p> namely the Aboriginal native title claimants, should have superior</p>
<p> rights to other Australians, namely the pastoralists.</p>
<p>The right to negotiate is not a common law right. It was a special</p>
<p> right given to native title claimants under Mr Keating's Native</p>
<p> Title Act and all we are doing is saying that procedures should be</p>
<p> established whereby native title claimants are given no greater rights</p>
<p> than other Australians.</p>
<p>What the Senate is saying is that you could have a situation where</p>
<p> in relation to a claim over a pastoral leasehold, the native title</p>
<p> claimant could insist on a right to negotiate but that would not be</p>
<p> available to a pastoral leaseholder who may, through his family, have</p>
<p> occupied that land for 50 or 100 years.</p>
<p>We haven't given in fully to any side of this argument. We have</p>
<p> tried to strike a fair balance and under our changes it will still</p>
<p> be possible for native title claimants in theory to make claims over</p>
<p> 79 percent of the land mass of Australia.</p>
<p>You all remember that when the original Act was passed in 1993 the</p>
<p> Keating Government virtually guaranteed that there couldn't be</p>
<p> native title claim under pastoral leases. That was overturned in the</p>
<p> Wik decision and what we have done with our changes is to make sure</p>
<p> that farmers and pastoralists can carry on their normal activities</p>
<p> without interference and that they can make reasonable extensions</p>
<p> to those activities without running into road blocks and running into</p>
<p> difficulties.</p>
<p>We need to put this issue behind us. We need to focus on the future.</p>
<p> We need to focus on constructive gestures of reconciliation between</p>
<p> Aboriginal people and other Australians. We can't afford as a</p>
<p> nation for the debate to go on indefinitely and I therefore hope that</p>
<p> when the Bill is presented again in March of this year the Senate</p>
<p> will understand the fairness and let the Bill go through in the form</p>
<p> that we propose.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
