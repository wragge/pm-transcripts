<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Neil.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What does Brian think of it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you should ask him.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I will, have you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I haven't spoken to him in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Did he have advanced knowledge of what was in the budget?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, all the proprieties were observed with budget.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it means that all the proprieties are observed.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>So he might have had some knowledge of what was in it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Every single propriety was observed.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I don't understand what that means. Is it proper</p>
<p> that Brian Harradine be told some of what was in the budget?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It has often been the case in the past that people work out because</p>
<p> of all sorts of things, not the result of direct briefing, that this</p>
<p> or that's going to be in a budget. But sensitive financial information</p>
<p> is always kept under wraps.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Oh sure, but was there a direct briefing for Brian Harradine?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, there wasn't a direct briefing about the contents of the</p>
<p> budget, no.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Have any of the...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, I'm not going to go into the nuances and details of</p>
<p> every single thing. I mean, I, for example, quite properly briefed</p>
<p> some interest groups about decisions relating to things like education,</p>
<p> things that are non-market sensitive. It's always been the case</p>
<p> that something that's non-market sensitive, there's never</p>
<p> been anything wrong with people having a broad idea of what might</p>
<p> be coming around the corner. What you should never do is disclose</p>
<p> market sensitive information.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>When will you speak to Senator Harradine about it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I talk to Senator Harradine on a regular basis about a variety</p>
<p> of things. That has continued over recent weeks and it will continue.</p>
<p> But I'm not going to start talking about when I'm seeing</p>
<p> him about this or that subject because I'll be driven mad and</p>
<p> he'll be driven mad by you and your colleagues Â– fair enough.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, well, would you respond to this? This was his reaction in part.</p>
<p> Senator Harradine: "...too little, too late and improperly</p>
<p> dependent upon my vote for the GST..."</p>
<p>What's your reaction to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not going to react.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because I choose not to. I chose to conduct my dialogue with him personally.</p>
<p> I don't think it ever helps to conduct a public dialogue through</p>
<p> the airwaves on issues like this.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you agree there are certain things in the budget which are designed</p>
<p> to get the support of Senator Harradine for the GST to be passed?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Everything in the budget is there on its merits and I am happy to</p>
<p> defend each and every measure on its merit. It does happen, you know,</p>
<p> that there are a lot of policy issues where the Government and Senator</p>
<p> Harradine and, indeed, other Senators actually agree because they</p>
<p> have independently arrived at the same conclusion. There seems to</p>
<p> be a fetish on the part of some to see every decision the Government</p>
<p> takes through the prism of Senator Harradine or somebody else's</p>
<p> reaction.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I don't...of course I accept that you believe in it otherwise</p>
<p> it wouldn't be there but is some of it aimed at getting support</p>
<p> from Senate Harradine?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, the main aim of the budget is to deliver a strong Australian</p>
<p> economy. I mean, of course we want to get the tax package through</p>
<p> the Senate but we're not ever going to propose anything that</p>
<p> we don't believe in. And if it so happens that things in the</p>
<p> budget please Senators, well, all the better, but they're there</p>
<p> primarily because we believe in them. We've never put something</p>
<p> in that we don't believe in.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is there room within this budget for more concessions on the GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Neil, I'm not going to speculate about the GST except to repeat</p>
<p> my time honoured formula and that is we're not going to put and</p>
<p> take essentials but we are willing to look at some fine-tuning.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, there's room in the budget for that fine-tuning obviously.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we're willing to look at some fine-tuning. I'm sorry</p>
<p> to be difficult but it's the sort of thing where for me to start</p>
<p> going any further only creates further avenues of questioning with</p>
<p> no productive outcome for the Government.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yeah, but it might be productive for the people because there's</p>
<p> a perception that this budget is based, obviously, on the full sale</p>
<p> of Telstra and the GST legislation getting through.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, look, I'm happy to talk about that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And a big part of that is getting Senator Harradine's support.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the budget is not dependent upon those things. It is true that</p>
<p> if we are able to sell all of Telstra as we promised in the last election</p>
<p> campaign, by the year 2003 we'll be free of Commonwealth debt.</p>
<p> And that's a terrific goal and a terrific aspiration to work</p>
<p> towards and it would be a terrific thing for the Australian public</p>
<p> if we're able to enter the next century free of debt at a Commonwealth</p>
<p> level.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But what are the implications if you are unable to sell all of Telstra</p>
<p> and unable to get a GST through, what does that mean to this budget?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it doesn't fundamentally alter the budget because this</p>
<p> budget is about next year, the GST doesn't come into operation</p>
<p> until the 1st of July in the year 2000. What are the implications</p>
<p> of tax reform not occurring? Very bad for the Australian economy.</p>
<p> We have a strong economic position now because we took the necessary</p>
<p> measures of reform a few years ago. If we take further reform measures</p>
<p> now we'll have an even stronger economy in a few years time.</p>
<p> And that includes taxation reform. It includes further industrial</p>
<p> relations reform. All of those things.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I spoke to you on Friday and you said you weren't over confident</p>
<p> on the GST, hopeful but not over-confident of getting through. Does</p>
<p> the budget change the degree of confidence you have on having success</p>
<p> getting the GST through?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I wouldn't alter my wording on that. I'm never, how shall</p>
<p> I put it, I'm never smug about these things. I regard each challenge</p>
<p> as being fairly difficult. We faced a difficult challenge winning</p>
<p> the last election. We won it. We believe we have a right to see the</p>
<p> GST implemented because that is what we promised the Australian people.</p>
<p> Politicians are constantly criticised for breaking their promises.</p>
<p> Last night we delivered on every single promise we made in October</p>
<p> of last year. The two that are outstanding for implementation through</p>
<p> the Parliament are Telstra and the GST. The GST is far more important</p>
<p> than Telstra, although Telstra's important too. And what we're</p>
<p> asking the Senate to do is to allow us to keep our promises with the</p>
<p> Australian people. I can understand it if we'd gone to the last</p>
<p> election with a vague promise about tax reform but we actually spelt</p>
<p> it out in detail and if mandates, the system, means anything we are</p>
<p> entitled to say to the Australian Senate, please pass it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, it's pretty healthy, a good surplus and well received.</p>
<p> Isn't it a reality there's room for tax cuts here even without</p>
<p> a GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Fixing the Australian tax system is not just about tax cuts. It's</p>
<p> also about running a system that is more likely to produce a competitive</p>
<p> business sector. And the advantage of a GST is that it will reduce</p>
<p> the cost of exports by $4.5 billion. Our tax package reduces our fuel</p>
<p> bills by $3.5 billion, our general business costs by $10.5 billion.</p>
<p> Now, those things are of enormous long-term benefit to the Australian</p>
<p> community. Anybody can deliver a lazy personal tax cut which just</p>
<p> is taken off the surplus. But not everybody can deliver long-term</p>
<p> structural reform and this is an integrated package. I mean, you can't</p>
<p> chop it in half because many of the elements of the personal tax changes</p>
<p> are a product of fundamental reform set up by the re-alignment of</p>
<p> indirect taxes. And the nugget of gold in this, Neil, is that 80 per</p>
<p> cent of Australian taxpayers will be paying no more than 30 cents</p>
<p> in the dollar. Now, you can't get that without our reform.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, understood, but I look at that surplus, I see the amount of</p>
<p> money that's come in...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But it doesn't sit in the bank. It's used to repay debt.</p>
<p> People have this idea that that $5 billion is a mouldering in the</p>
<p> Reserve Bank, accumulating dust. It's not. It's used to</p>
<p> repay debt that was run up by previous governments in earlier years.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yeah, understood, but I look at the money coming in and I look at</p>
<p> the, all right, now you say sensible financial management plus an</p>
<p> increase in income for the Commonwealth leads to a surplus, obviously,</p>
<p> it's a combination of the two. And I look at all that money coming</p>
<p> in and I think about, what about tax indexation, would you ever consider</p>
<p> indexation of tax rates?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well if you have 80% on the top marginal rate of 30% and you have</p>
<p> low inflation, there's not much need of indexation. Indexation</p>
<p> is a great idea when you have high inflation because people keep getting</p>
<p> pushed into higher taxation brackets. But if you dissolve all those</p>
<p> intermediate steps so that somebody can go from about $20,000 a year</p>
<p> to $50,000 a year without passing into a higher tax bracket, and if</p>
<p> you have low inflation, you virtually, to find the way, the need to</p>
<p> have indexation, even if you could afford, and thought it was a good</p>
<p> idea. You're talking of in another world of high inflation.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well I think we could return to that one day. I'd like to see</p>
<p> indexation enshrined.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we aren't there at the moment. I'd rather see enshrined</p>
<p> an incentive-driven personal tax system that says to 80% of the community:</p>
<p> you can work as hard as you like, as long as you like without going</p>
<p> into a higher tax bracket.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>A couple of the basic issues, I'm sure a lot of reaction to health</p>
<p> care and, I suppose the incentives on private health insurance, it's</p>
<p> in fact more a penalty than an incentive in a sense. But if I can't</p>
<p> afford it now, why would I be able to afford it under this system?</p>
<p> I wouldn't would I?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, decisions people make as to whether they can afford something</p>
<p> are governed by not only what something costs, but also what it might</p>
<p> cost if you feel you might need it more in the future.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well true, but it wouldn't help pay the bill now would it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, but it might alter your priority. You might say: well because</p>
<p> it will be more expensive when I'm 45 and I've got three</p>
<p> children, I'm now 28, single and no responsibilities, it might</p>
<p> make more sense to spend money on that now rather than include an</p>
<p> extra country in my trip overseas.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What if I'm forced to jump in and out. For example, I have insurance,</p>
<p> I'm going to lose my job for a year and I can't afford so</p>
<p> I've got to get out. And then I get back in again. Do I still</p>
<p> have the disincentives towards the penalty?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well generally speaking yes. I mean the point you make, it would be</p>
<p> nice to see if you could design a sort of a safety net mechanism.</p>
<p> I don't know that that's possible because people sometimes</p>
<p> invent reasons for hitting and running when it comes to private health</p>
<p> insurance. I mean I take your point, but I don't want to raise</p>
<p> the expectation that that could be accommodated. I don't think</p>
<p> it can in a practical way.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>If there was to be a safety net that would be up to the funds wouldn't</p>
<p> it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well more up to the funds, yes. I don't think it would be possible</p>
<p> for us to impose that kind of condition.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Education, can you answer this....it didn't seem to me to</p>
<p> encapsulate the person I saw quoted in one of the papers here. A young</p>
<p> mum and she said: why give money to rich private schools when there</p>
<p> are 35 preppies in my child's class of a State school?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we're not giving money to rich private schools beyond a</p>
<p> fairly basic amount.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But you're giving more aren't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We're giving more but most of the more, if I can put it that</p>
<p> way, is going to quite poor Catholic schools, and some low income</p>
<p> non-Catholic independent schools. There are a lot of Parish schools</p>
<p> around Australia that have over-crowding and difficult class-room</p>
<p> situations similar to government schools. The other point I'd</p>
<p> make Neil is that the great bulk of financial support for government</p>
<p> schools in this country comes from the State government. I mean they</p>
<p> are State government schools and we have a funding understanding in</p>
<p> Australia that the Federal government by-and-large funds private schools</p>
<p> to the extent the government support private schools, and when it</p>
<p> comes to State schools the great bulk of their funding comes from</p>
<p> the State governments, and we topped that up. I mean we're putting</p>
<p> I think $300 million more into government schools this year then in</p>
<p> the last year of the former Labor government by way of additional</p>
<p> direct Commonwealth funding.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Now, I know you need to get away Mr Howard so I'll be quick.</p>
<p> Unemployment 7.5%, it seems excessive that it can't go any lower.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it can.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It can go lower if we can get further structural reform. If we could</p>
<p> get our unfair dismissal laws through, and our youth wage things through,</p>
<p> and also further reforms to the labour market that Mr Reith has foreshadowed,</p>
<p> then we can have a lower rate of unemployment. We have set up the</p>
<p> general conditions for lower unemployment by getting a strong economic</p>
<p> growth rate.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>So we don't have to accept 7.5% [inaudible] full employment?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No we don't. No I do not accept that it's full employment.</p>
<p> We can go further.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What is?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I hesitate to put a figure on it but it's much lower than</p>
<p> 7.5%.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes, fair enough.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You always have to keep driving lower when it comes to unemployment.</p>
<p> If you accept a particular figure that's the mistake.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay. So 7.5% is not accepted despite [inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't accept 7.5% but I wish the Senate would accept our unfair</p>
<p> dismissal changes, our youth wage changes, and can I enter a plea</p>
<p> in advance that they accept further reforms to the labour market.</p>
<p> I mean there is a point beyond which you can't go further with</p>
<p> general economic growth. I mean we have very strong economic conditions,</p>
<p> very strong growth. We've got the lowest unemployment rate for</p>
<p> ten years. We can go further but to go further you've got to</p>
<p> have some changes in the system, some further freeing up and liberalisation</p>
<p> of the labour market.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thanks for you time. If I could just....this is</p>
<p> maybe unfair and I understand if you don't know the answer to</p>
<p> it, it's totally off the budget. I noticed one of the Kosovar</p>
<p> couples had a baby, healthy baby girl.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's lovely.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
