    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia and Peru have finalised a comprehensive trade agreement that will generate exports, income and jobs.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement (PAFTA) creates new opportunities for Australian exporters in one of the fastest growing economies and regions in the world.</p>
<p>Our businesses, farmers and families are the big winners. The equation is simple: more trade means more exports; more exports means more jobs, higher wages and better incomes.</p>
<p>PAFTA delivers huge wins for Australian businesses with market access outcomes that go well beyond the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement.</p>
<p>Australian farmers, effectively shut out of the market until now, will have the opportunity to compete on a level playing field.</p>
<p>PAFTA will eliminate 99 per cent of tariffs that Australian exporters face into Peru.</p>
<p>Sugar, dairy, rice and sorghum farmers will enjoy historic market access opportunities.</p>
<p>Australia’s sugar market access is more than any other sugar exporting country has achieved in the last twenty years and equivalent to roughly 30 per cent of Peru’s sugar imports.</p>
<p>Peruvian supermarkets are already asking about getting Aussie beef on their shelves - this agreement will help that happen sooner.</p>
<p>There will be immediate duty free access for Australian sheep meat, most wine and most horticulture products including almonds, kangaroo meat and wheat.</p>
<p>Australia has secured the best services commitments Peru has ever offered.</p>
<p>Peru will recognise Australian degrees, helping Australian universities attract more Peruvian students to study in Australia.</p>
<p>This is fastest trade agreement Australia has ever concluded after negotiations were launched in May earlier this year.</p>
