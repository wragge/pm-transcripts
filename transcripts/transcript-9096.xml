TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JULIE FLYNN, RADIO 2UE, RE: NSW BUSHFIRES<br />
SUNDAY, 9 JANUARY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JF: Mr Keating, what's been your personal response to the scale of the<br />
devastation the fires have caused?<br />
PM: Well, it just demonstrates how vulnerable people are even in the<br />
relatively inner city suburbs in modern brick homes. Sydney, and<br />
NSW in particular, is well served by its very large areas of open<br />
space and forest. But, I suppose, as the years have gone on people<br />
have believed that large fires of this nature are more the exception<br />
than the rule. It has been the unlikely weather conditions which have<br />
produced this. But, I must say, that I think the fighting of the fires<br />
have been very professional and losses have been while too high still<br />
minimal for the size of the fires that have been experienced.<br />
JF:-It has been an extraordinary performance by everyone involved. How<br />
long do you think the fire fighters can sustain this effort?<br />
PM: Well, the latest advice I have is that if conditions prevail as is now that<br />
is as of late Sunday there is an expectation that within 72 hours the<br />
great majorlty of fires will be brought under control.<br />
JF;-Is there anything more that the Commonwealth can do at this stage?<br />
PM: Well the Commonwealth has got as much equipment really and<br />
personnel there as can be taken. We have got 30 helicopters<br />
currently deployed and we have 10 on standby, we have got 400<br />
people deployed, 200 on standby not yet required as well as dozens<br />
of water tankers and four wheel drive vehicles etc. So in terms of, I<br />
think the cooperation between the Australian Defence Forces and the<br />
emergency services have been tip top. And so everyone says, but we<br />
stand ready-t deploy more if needs be. I think one of the important<br />
things out of this Julie ( Flynn) will be the experience of the fire<br />
fighters, the volunteers In these fires each episode of these fires </p>
<p>TEL 2<br />
brings the professionalism of fire fighting up and I think after it would<br />
be important to get peoples' views to see in which ways both In terms<br />
of equipment and personal deployment we can better fight the fires in<br />
the first instance with the emergency services and volunteers and with<br />
the Australian Defence Forces.<br />
JF: Do you think we probably also need a national review of bush fire<br />
strategies overall, particularly in the question of burning back?<br />
PM: I think that will come fairly naturally with this. It is a long time since<br />
Sydney has seen fires like this or the NSW region generally and of<br />
course, because of this time there has been some complacency In the<br />
community but this has not been true of the professional services as I<br />
think the success in fighting these fires has demonstrated.<br />
JF: Do you have any message for the employers who have staff working<br />
as volunteer fire brigade officers?<br />
PM: I think most employers would take a fairly sensible, I hope humane<br />
view of the services which volunteers can provide, and that is on<br />
these times every professionally qualified person who understands<br />
how to fight a fire it is of course very important. But I think what we<br />
have seen is quite magnificent efforts on behalf of volunteers, and<br />
pulling the volunteer service in together with the professional services<br />
is not a very easy thing to do but it has been done very affectively<br />
here.<br />
JF: There have been calls for a nation wide appeal to raise money for the<br />
victims of the fire do you think that is necessary?<br />
PM: Well I made clear yesterday that any contributions to designated<br />
funds ' will be tax deductible to encourage people to make<br />
contributions towards it. There will of course be assistance to people<br />
affected by the fires and the natural disaster relief arrangements<br />
which the Commonwealth has in place With NSW. But also can I say<br />
that the Commonwealth indicated yesterday that we would meet NSW<br />
dollar for dollar in the cost of fighting the fires.<br />
JF; Have you had any overall cost conveyed to you yet by either the<br />
Premier or the Bush Fire Authorities?<br />
PM: Well, no not of the fires or the cost of restoration or replacement of<br />
infrastructure but as of yesterday the cost of actually fighting the fire<br />
was about $ 15 million, we are meeting half of that. I also Indicated<br />
yesterday that the Commonwealth will be declaring a disaster relief<br />
payment under -, the Social Security Act. And at the moment that<br />
payment is limited to aformula, we will probably increase that formula<br />
a number of times which will mean a more generous level of<br />
payments. T1EL0: . Jan. 94 11: 47 No. 004 P. 02/ 06 </p>
<p>T1EL.: Jan. 94 11: 47 NO. 004 P-03/ 06<br />
23<br />
JF: Prime Minister, having a look around at what has happened you say<br />
you have been impressed by the work of the people who have been<br />
fighting the fires, but there has also been an extraordinary response<br />
from just the people who have been affected and ordinary Australians<br />
who have rushed Into help, hasn't there?<br />
PM: There has been a magnificent response I think from just general<br />
members of the public trying to give a hand and there the ones who<br />
are fighting effectively many fires, way beyond the course of the<br />
capacity of volunteers. I mean the effort has been nothing short of<br />
magnificent and just shows you when things get tough in this country<br />
the country does pull together in a very strong and meaningful way,<br />
and I think that has been demonstrated very clearly here. The main<br />
thing is where does this now go and I think the next 24 hours are<br />
going to tell the story. My latest advice was that in the suburban fires<br />
in the Sydney area, the likelihood that sufficient resources could be<br />
deployed to contain theme there has been no property loss in Sydney<br />
in the last 24 hours despite the fact that many homes were lost<br />
yesterday around Sonnet Bay and Jannali. There are 155 homes lost<br />
I think in total so far but none lost today. That is my advice which if of<br />
course we can maintain that record we will then be fine. There is the<br />
Blue Mountains Kariong area which is a problem. There are spot fires<br />
there, the wind conditions are not good but resources are being<br />
deployed. T-he overall view from the emergency services is as<br />
conditions currently are there is same expectation that within about 72<br />
hours most of the fires could be contained.<br />
JF: Prime Minister thank you very much.<br />
PM; Thank you Julie.<br />
