ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The. Jubilee Year Royal Tour of Australia has been an outstanding<br />
success. The Queen and Prince Philip have been greeted with<br />
warmth, genuine affection and friendship. I cannot recall a<br />
more open. and warmer recep. tion on any previous Royal Tour.<br />
In a real sense, the tour to all states, the Northern Territory,<br />
and the Australian Capital Territory plainly has illustrated jusi<br />
how Australians feel about'the Monarch. It has proved beyond any<br />
doubt that Australians want to continue their links with -the<br />
Monarchy. It prove.: Australians value its great role.<br />
The Monarchy, with the Queen as its head, is an intrinsic part<br />
of our Constitutional process. There is an inbuilt importance<br />
attached to the Executive Council, which comprises the Governor<br />
General, the Queen's representative, and senior members of the<br />
Government. The Monarchy is in a sense the last area. of appeal.<br />
It is the last bulwark, the . last safeguard to make sure that all<br />
the processes are being properly and constitutionally carried ' ut.<br />
The-Monarchy is also important because Australians want stability<br />
in institutions, so that they can pi'an ahead w; th real degree<br />
of security,<br />
Of course, stability does not mean there is no requirement for<br />
change. What it does mean is that progressive policies can be<br />
applied and developed with a stable Government framework. Policies;<br />
do and ought to change as requirements alter. But it is important<br />
that the framework of Government remains stable and predictable.<br />
During the tour, some media prominence was given to demonstrations<br />
that sought to draw attention to the Republican cause. I believe<br />
there are very few Australians who want anything to do with a<br />
Republican form of Government. Surely, the central message from<br />
this tour is that the overwhelming majority of Australians have<br />
great loyalty to the Cown 1, the y. eC. vernimnt it<br />
embodies. I see no cause to move Australia along a Republican<br />
path. I do not agree with those who say it is inevi': able. It<br />
would be a tragedy for Australia, for I believe we would be less<br />
well governed. / In a </p>

In a farewell message, the Queen made the point that the right to<br />
dissent was a freedom we enjoy in Australia a freedom: which sadly<br />
does not exist in other countries. I believe that signs of dissent<br />
in a country as vigorous and individualistic as Australia is a<br />
healthy sign. It is healthy as long as it is non-violent, and<br />
does not interfere with the rights of others. If there was no<br />
dissent in Australia, I think it would be fair to ask what has<br />
been wrong with our spirit. There has always been argument and<br />
dissent publicly displayed in Australia. It is one of the fundamental<br />
privileges that we strive to maintain.<br />
In the Federal Parliament this week, the Minister for Employment and<br />
Industrial Relations introduced legislation for the establishment of<br />
an Industrial Relations Bureau.<br />
I This Bureau is a central feature of our industrial relations policy,<br />
which sets out two clear principles: each member of our community<br />
has both rights and obligations; individual rights can be protected,<br />
equally, obligations can be met.<br />
The one point about the legislation that I want to stress is the<br />
protection it gives to individuals.. The Industrial Relations Bureau<br />
will protect the rights of individual men and women agairst the wrong<br />
actions of either employers or unions. It will be able to act on its<br />
own initiative to protect those rights without having to wait first<br />
for a complaint.<br />
The Government regards the protection of individual rights as both<br />
fundamental and inalienable. This Bureau will strengthen that<br />
commitment. The legislation will not become law immediately. It will lie on the<br />
table of the House to give ample time for full and const:: uctive debatf<br />
Ibelieve, however, that many who had criticised the Bureau without<br />
see:. ng the legislation will understand the considerable personal<br />
benefit it brings to men and women throughout Australia. </p>
