TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING IMP<br />
AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE ACTU, MR MARTIN FERGUSON, PRESS<br />
CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 22 JUNE 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Well, here it is, here's another one. Number eight, four years of low<br />
inflation, four years of continuing low inflation with a two to three per<br />
cent inflation commitment in there by the ACTU and the Government.<br />
That means another four years of economic growth. It means another<br />
four years of decent rates of employment. It is the difference between<br />
us and the Coalition about how we run Australia and how they would<br />
run Australia. The difference between Australia and most other OECD<br />
countries because what you have seen from the Government and the<br />
ACTU now In the last month or so, certainly in the last six months, is<br />
appropriate weight on monetary policy, appropriate weight on fiscal<br />
policy and appropriate weight on wages policy. A bit on monetary, a<br />
bit on wages, a bit on fiscal. If this didn't exist, it would be all on fiscal<br />
and all on monetary and as a consequence we would be like a lot of<br />
other OECD countries, we would be sitting there as Robert Reich, the<br />
American Labour Secretary, said, with that rotten choice between high<br />
employment growth and lousy wages or high wages and lousy<br />
employment. We have come right up the middle and the Accord has<br />
taken us there on ever occasion.<br />
This Accord, and it is I think, worth recording just over the years what<br />
we have done with this instrument, this point of agreement with the<br />
work force: the stabilisation of the economy in the early 1980s, the<br />
Medicare adjustment, the productivity and skills formation Accord of<br />
the middle to late 1980s, the enhancement of the change to award<br />
restructuring and the enhancement there of skills, the devolution of the<br />
wages system to an enterprise bargaining system, Accord Mark VII<br />
which had the focus on jobs and employment and now this one Accord<br />
Mark Vill which is, as we say, sustaining growth, low inflation and<br />
fairness. </p>

And, Isn't it a maturity of Australia or of the great trade union<br />
movement of this country, that it leads the anti-inflation constituency.<br />
It Is the key player in the anti-inflation constituency. Not business, but<br />
the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the trade unions<br />
themselves they with the Government in this Accord.<br />
So, what we will see out of this is what, can I say, the Liberal Party<br />
could never deliver because they never want to. They never want to<br />
talk to the workforce and they never want to talk to trade unions. What<br />
they can never deliver is low inflation. Howard could never deliver it<br />
as Treasurer, would never deliver it as Prime Minister low inflation,<br />
sustainable rates of economic growth and good rates of employment<br />
growth. We have got another target in here of 600,000 jobs over the<br />
life of this document after having reached the other target of half a<br />
million jobs in two thirds of the time in Accord Mark VII.<br />
So, I would like to, again, just say how pleased I am to be able to be<br />
doing this with Martin Ferguson. How delighted I have been with the<br />
spirit of co-operation and the democratic participation of members of<br />
the work force and trade unions in this process and to think that we<br />
could come up with, again, something of this weight and quality when<br />
we see last week how the Coalition were treating us with their<br />
document about regional development. Announcing things that they<br />
have no intention of ever implementing. Compare the immorality of<br />
that with the high principal and morality of this and that is all the world<br />
of difference between this Government and our arrangements with<br />
ACTU and the Coalition.<br />
I'll invite Martin to add to my remarks.<br />
MF: Thank you very much Paul. As Paul has said, it is 12 years and our<br />
engines are still running. I must say, what more does the Australian<br />
community want? Sustaining growth which is about a better Australia,<br />
low inflation and fairness. We are pretty proud of this agreement<br />
because it effectively means that Paul Keating and the Government in<br />
association with the union movement is about leadership, but more<br />
Importantly, responsible leadership.<br />
What are the key cornerstones of the agreement? A decent wages<br />
system. We're going to deliver a competitive Australia, enterprise<br />
bargaining going forward, more and more enterprise agreements. We<br />
also understand and, I suppose, it is the Labor way, it is about a sense<br />
of fairness at work and in the community and at home. So, we have<br />
locked that up once again.<br />
In essence, Australia knows that through almost to the turn of the<br />
century, what the wages system is. It knows that enterprise bargaining<br />
is going to go forward, but it is going to go forward in the context of<br />
delivering to the lowest paid, and that is about fairness. But also </p>
<p>TEL: N3o. Ju. .09051 0: P0-07-1<br />
3<br />
delivering on the jobs front 600,000 additional jobs and, I think, that<br />
is pretty important because that is about economic prosperity for<br />
Australia and also fairness. There is nothing better for an Australian<br />
working person than a job.<br />
But, I also say, it is about social justice. I go through the agreement, I<br />
have a look at maternity payments, think about the needs of families. I<br />
think Accord Mark VIII is family friendly because what do families<br />
want? They want a decent social safety net and they want jobs and<br />
they want safety net wage increases. So, to my way of thinking, we<br />
hold our head proud today as a union movement. It is 12 years on. It<br />
is a better union movement today because of the Accord process. It is<br />
a better Australia today because of the Accord process. Because<br />
without the Accord process, you know, John Howard couldn't deliver<br />
this. We offered it to him once or twice and he ran away from it. He<br />
was afraid of making the hard decisions and working through the tough<br />
issues with the union movement and with the Australian community.<br />
So, it is on the table. It is out there for people to debate. The same<br />
way in which since, you know, February 1983, we have been prepared<br />
to sit down and work out a decent structure and put it to the Australian<br />
community for consideration. That is about democracy. That is about<br />
an independent Australia.<br />
Again, on behalf of the Australian trade union movement, thanks for<br />
the opportunity to sit down in a responsible way, make the hard<br />
decisions again, because I think that is what Australia wants people<br />
who are prepared to lead in a responsible way. Create jobs, lock in<br />
low inflation and create a better work place, not just a competitive work<br />
place, but a family friendly work place. Thanks very much.<br />
PM: We are happy to take questions.<br />
J: Mr Ferguson, the Accord has been negotiated without the direct<br />
involvement of the transport sector which is industrially and<br />
economically one of the largest in Australia. How does that effect its<br />
validity and viability?<br />
MF: I tell you what, there is one peak council in Australia the Australian<br />
Council of Trade Unions and I think, there are a few differences with<br />
the Transport Workers Union at the moment, but they will be resolved.<br />
This agreement is not just about unions, this is about the future of<br />
Australia. I think, working men and women and their families will<br />
welcome this agreement. Because what do they want? They want<br />
jobs, they want low inflation, they want decent wage agreements,<br />
enterprise bargaining and safety net improvements, the social justice<br />
structure. So, we are offering something of substance. I believe that<br />
this agreement, not only will be endorsed by all Australian unions, but<br />
TEL: 23. Jun 95 </p>
<p>TEL: 26. Jun. 9t U: U( N0. UU1 r. U-<br />
4<br />
more Importantly it will be welcomed by the Australian community at<br />
large.<br />
J: Martin, given that we saw an 11 per cent wage rise in the vehicle<br />
industry recently, how can you ensure a cap on wages growth?<br />
MF: I'll tell you why, because since 1983 we have delivered on every<br />
undertaking to the Australian Labor Government. We have locked<br />
ourselves in, yet again, to an underlying rate of inflation of two to three<br />
per cent. Don't worry about the outcomes. Have a look at the<br />
productivity improvements. Have a look at the work place change.<br />
Have a look at the reduction in industrial disputation of 65 per cent<br />
since 1983. Have a look at in excess of 500,000 jobs in the last two<br />
and half years. So, in essence, I say, we have shaken hands, we have<br />
got an agreement and we will deliver. The vehicle industry workers<br />
are entitled to nine, ten, eleven per cent, whatever they negotiate with<br />
their employer provided they also continue to deliver as they have on<br />
productivity.<br />
J: Prime Minister, how do you believe the business community will<br />
respond to this initiative?<br />
PM: Getting the trade unions and the Government to commit themselves to<br />
two to three per cent inflation over the period, I mean, what more could<br />
they ask for, with all the other commitments to economic growth? And,<br />
as you know, I met with the Metal Trades Industry Association as an<br />
example of one group earlier this week on Monday who wanted to be<br />
part of this process, who wanted to talk about it and, I think, you will<br />
find that that body, a lot of the issues that they propose are actually<br />
incorporated here. So, I think, business is going to treat this<br />
tremendously well.<br />
Frankly, what other, I mean, there would be no other government/ union<br />
workforce relationship anywhere in the 27 member states of the OECD<br />
where a thing of this comprehension and detail and strength<br />
commitment would be available. The whole movement towards a<br />
flexible enterprise based bargaining system, which is allowing the<br />
productivity increases Martin speaks of, which is protecting them now<br />
at the low inflation rate that is, the contestability of the Australian<br />
market the fact that it is now a contestable market with low tariffs and<br />
competition policy and where we are seeing shifts in productivity after<br />
having got the aggregate wage movements in the 1 980s, to getting<br />
within sector wage movements now flexibly, but with the safety net. It<br />
is a model where virtually, because the Accord and wages are holding<br />
such a strong part of the whole economic adjustment, this burden has<br />
lifted from businesses back. Otherwise they would be doing it at the<br />
company level and that is why, by and large, I think they will support it.<br />
I mean they know one thing for sure. They know the Coalition would<br />
never have proposed this. Do you remember this? Let me remind you </p>
<p>23. Jun. 95 0: 07 No. 001<br />
of John Howard's Industrial Relatiurs Bill. We were going to see it<br />
beforo the last election. Do you remember that? Then we were going<br />
to soc it two days before the last election. Do you remember all that?<br />
We never ever saw it. It never, ever appeared and they know that only<br />
Labor and the unions can basically give Australia a low inflation rate,<br />
without a draconian monetary policy that crushes tile life out of the<br />
economy. And, while some people in business may skip down to the<br />
local polling booth to vote Liberal, they always hope that the Liberals<br />
don't make it and that this sort of sense prevails. And I think they will<br />
keep on hoping.<br />
J: Prime Minister are you promising that when nearly 600,000 new jobs<br />
are delivered, there still won't be upwards of 800,000 people out of<br />
work?<br />
PM: We are seeking to get to 5 per cent unemployment by the end of the<br />
decade. And. as you know, the success we had with Accord Mark VII,<br />
we had a 500,000 target in there. We have now had 630,000 jobs<br />
since the election 630,000 We reached the 500,000 target in<br />
two years and we have had the largest fall in unemployment, since we<br />
have been keeping the records, In the last twelve months. One of the<br />
things that made it difficult lu get to 5 per cent In the 80s. despite the<br />
very high rates of employment growth, was that we couldn't get into the<br />
long term unemployed. But Working Nation actually lets us through<br />
the case management and the job compact, actually get the long term<br />
unemployed back into the mainstream of the workforce. And that is<br />
why, I think, we have been so delighted to have a quarter of this years<br />
jobs go to long term unemployed people. So it means as we come<br />
down that we won't reach that sort of, if you like. floor at around<br />
6 per cent, or 6 1/ 2 per cent, we will be able to break through the floor<br />
this time with the Working Nation type initiatives to get within reach of<br />
that 5 per cent unemploymont rate.<br />
J: How can you do that with the levels of growth that are forecast in the<br />
Budget?<br />
PM: Well we made it clear in the Budget Papers that these are over tho<br />
cycle consistent with getting there. I mean we are still talking about<br />
3 3/ 4, 3 1/ 2, 4 per cent GDP growth.<br />
J: You have gut two levels of safety net rises here and they are timed<br />
with the superannuation levy. What is the reason for the two levels<br />
and how does that gel with the super payments.<br />
MF: I'll tell you what the Accord is about, It's about fairness. In an<br />
enterprise bargaining situatiur a lot of workers can do better than the<br />
safety net because they can deliver on productivity. So what we have<br />
effectively said in this Accord agreement is that we really want to share<br />
the benefits of growth across the whole Australian community. So we<br />
TEL: </p>
<p>TEL: 23. Jun. 95 0: 07 No. 001 P. O.-<br />
6<br />
have created an opportunity now have a look at the different figures<br />
but also the issues that go to the determination of these matters.<br />
We are committed to trying to deliver a bit more to the lowest paid in<br />
the community. John Howard is not interested in that. Go and have a<br />
look at what he suggested, as you know, in Victoria. He is suggesting<br />
an all-up hourly rate of about $ 9 per hour for an unskilled worker.<br />
No overtime or shift penalties. So we are not just committed to<br />
maintaining the safety net and a decent award structure. When the<br />
opportunities permit, we are going to share the benefit of growth to the<br />
lowest paid in the community.<br />
PM. Yes, let me just add to that. That we have seen a level of profitability<br />
almost now at unprecedented levels in the economy. We have seen<br />
economic growth of the order of 4 to 5 per cent for the last few years.<br />
In such an economy, it Is right that we support the people who are<br />
living on award minimums, or award rates who are not picking up any<br />
additional over-award payments. And not only is that there, but you<br />
see on page 6 of the document that we, again, are opposed to any<br />
actions to undermine the efficiency of the arrangements and the<br />
no-disadvantage test. See, you understand what the Coalition are<br />
about, they are saying people can have a choice of staying in the<br />
award system. But if they get out of it, they lose all the award<br />
protections. 1.6 million Australians change jobs a year. So in<br />
three years, basically you have got the largest part of the workforce,<br />
over half the workforce, will have already lost the award protections.<br />
So, as Martin just said, whether it is overtime or shift penalties, or meal<br />
allowances, they go by the board and you get back to base rates.<br />
So what we are saying here is because the economy can afford it, let's<br />
put more in there for people just on minimum rates, award rates, and at<br />
the same time let's make clear the importance of the no-disadvantage<br />
test.<br />
J: Mr Ferguson do you believe industrial relations will be as big an issue<br />
at the forthcoming election as it dominated the last one to some<br />
extent?<br />
MF: Yes, I think it will be because I think Australian people acknowledge<br />
that we have come a long way in the 12 years. But, you know what,<br />
we have held Australia together and we have delivered economically.<br />
It is a better Australia. They also want a sense of security as we go<br />
forward. They know what the industrial relations system is doing in<br />
Australia at the moment, it is delivering where it counts at an<br />
enterprise bargaining level. They also want a decent social safety net<br />
in the form of the award structure and safety net increases. So I think<br />
it will be an important issue because it is about Australia going forward<br />
In a sensible and fair way. We don't want division and a lack of a<br />
sense of cohesion and commitment to where we want Australia by the<br />
turn of the century. </p>

J: Prime Minister I have heard it said that you weren't initially a very<br />
enthusiastic supporter of the Accord back in the early 80s. What is it<br />
that has sort of swung you around to it and how important do you think<br />
the Accord has been to you in all the elections that Labor's won?<br />
PM: Well I think we started with what was going to be a one-off adjustment<br />
to wages through the Medicare adjustment and that was, in essence,<br />
about the totality of it. Where I think what has happened is we have<br />
realised that people did know that the 1 970s and the early 1980s were<br />
a disaster for Australia. John Howard had 18 per cent wages growth In<br />
1980-81 18 per cent. We had a recession In 1982-83 and we came<br />
out of it with 11I per cent inflation out of the recession with 11 per cent<br />
inflation. Investment was smashed, employment had been dashed,<br />
unemployment was in double digits and growing. So there had to be a<br />
better way. And I think what has happened is with a lot of goodwill, on<br />
all our parts, we have realised we actually had an instrument we could<br />
do a lot with. I mean I think one of the things that matters in this Is<br />
trust. There has to be a bit of trust between people. I mean the<br />
Accord has always delivered. The ACTU has always delivered on<br />
wages, always. We delivered on inflation. The Government has<br />
always delivered for them. So when I say something to<br />
Martin Ferguson, as Leader of the Government, or to Bill Kelty and<br />
they say something to me, that's it. I mean we believe them and they<br />
believe us. And, therefore, with that lubrication you can then go down<br />
. look at the paths we have been down. I mean the Accord is now<br />
doing things we could never have envisaged. You know, the change<br />
to the award system, the movement to an enterprise bargaining<br />
system, the development of occupational superannuation for the whole<br />
workforce, meeting the terms of trade adjustment of the middle 1 980s,<br />
the massive employment imperatives of three years ago. And, now,<br />
we are talking about, you know, low inflation. I mean what<br />
commitments do you get from the Business Council about low<br />
inflation? Any restraint on executive salaries? Any restraints on<br />
profits? I mean have they got a document that is headed " Sustaining<br />
Growth and Low Inflation"? I mean when they are giving something<br />
away, or they are making a commitment? Well, of course, they<br />
haven't. I mean this Accord has been such a flexible and good thing<br />
and it has been made to work by imagination and by trust and by<br />
consultation and by a sense of democracy in the negotiations with the<br />
workforce and I think this is the point. I mean the Coalition, they<br />
regard this as poison because we have won, frankly, the industrial<br />
debate in every election since 1983. And we will win it again. And<br />
they know that. They know that and they regard it as poison because<br />
In the end all they want to do is hop into working people. They want to<br />
hop into working people, they want to take away the no-disadvantage<br />
test, they want to push people out of the award protections and they<br />
want to cut their wages. That is what John Howard has always been<br />
about. He has opposed every wage increase since 1981, bar the last<br />

8<br />
two safety nets of ours. He has supported, weakly on the side, the<br />
payment of $ 16 since 1981.<br />
J: Mr Ferguson how do you explain the decline in union membership over<br />
the last 12 years?<br />
MVF: We, as a union movement, have failed to put our own house in order.<br />
In the growth areas of Australian employment, there is no running<br />
away from it, in the service sector, there was room for improvement<br />
and that is what we are about now. We have put in place a<br />
recruitment strategy and we have committed resources. So I am not<br />
running away from that particular issue. But, I'll tell you what, we also<br />
understand what working people want and working people in those<br />
growth sectors want jobs, a low rate of inflation, the protection of the<br />
award safety net system, in association with a decent social safety net.<br />
So, yes, union membership is down. But I'll tell you what, we have<br />
delivered on every other front, we have met every undertaking to the<br />
Commonwealth Government.<br />
J: Could employers be included formally in Accord Mark IX?<br />
PM: They didn't want to be included. The MTIA said we want to be part of<br />
the process and we said " fine, come and see us, have a talk".<br />
They did. They brought a document to us. We had a long discussion,<br />
but they made the point they don't want to be a formal part. They want<br />
to put a view. Because they know that, in the end, the burden of<br />
responsibility that falls on the peak body of th * e workforce, the ACTU, is<br />
not their responsibility. You know, so they can be part of the process,<br />
but, in a sense, they are not the ones who decide the issue about<br />
wage outcomes. But being part of the process isn't, in a sense, being<br />
in the process and that is what they want to be. In it, but not<br />
essentially a formal part of the documentation.<br />
J: Mr Ferguson, it's been suggested that some of the... . for most.. for many<br />
low-paid workers, the subsequent pay increases that you're<br />
announcing today will actually be eaten up by the superannuation. If<br />
that's right, don't you expect them to be rather angry about that?<br />
MVF: No. Because I think you don't understand the support out there in the<br />
community for the development of a decent long-term retirement<br />
incomes policy. Working people want access to superannuation it<br />
was the Accord in the 80s that gave them access to superannuation. I<br />
tell you what John Howard went missing when we wanted to discuss<br />
these issues. They have suddenly discovered that this is an important<br />
election Issue this is the polling again. So I believe there is an<br />
overwhelming move by the community to embrace the Government's<br />
announcements on the superannuation front. I would also say that's<br />
why we have got two potential ranges of increases. It is about insuring<br />
that working people especially the lowest paid as we move forward, </p>
<p>TEL: 9<br />
have access to the benefits of economic growths. So we will deliver on<br />
superannuation, and we will also deliver to the lowest paid through the<br />
award safety net, and decent safety net increases.<br />
J: Can it be summed up that 19% of their income, for very low income<br />
earners, could go on superannuation isn't that a very large whack?<br />
MF: Well, 19% of their income a fair slice of It comes from employer<br />
contributions, backed up by 3% worker contributions a pretty decent<br />
offering from the Commonwealth Government. And that's what the<br />
Accord is about it's about bundling up 15 19% superannuation, a<br />
terrific savings pool for the purpose of investment in Australia, and<br />
ensuring that we as a community go forward on the basis that when<br />
you get to retirement, you can retire to some dignity, and I think that's<br />
pretty important. That's about fairness in Australia.<br />
J: How did...( inaudible)... in relation to interim wages to the employment<br />
goal work, Mr Ferguson? Could it mean, for example, that if the<br />
economy slows more than expected, through the next year, that those<br />
safety net pay increases would not go ahead?<br />
MF: What it effectively means is that we have committed ourselves not<br />
just to delivering on the jobs front but also locking in a low rate of<br />
inflation of an underlying rate of inflation over the cycle. And<br />
they are Indicators that we are going to take into consideration when<br />
we talk to the Commonwealth Government about the potential<br />
implementation of the safety net Increases. And I am pretty confident<br />
that we will deliver we delivered on jobs in the last 2 1/ 2 years, and<br />
we delivered on the inflation front. So you know, you take us at our<br />
word, you tell me in the last 12 years when we haven't delivered with<br />
respect to our undertakings to this Government. with respect to the<br />
implementation of the Accord?<br />
J: So you wouldn't go ahead with the safety net claims if employment<br />
growth is slow?<br />
MF: That's not what I said. I said that we will sit down and we will talk to<br />
the Government, in the same way which we talk in regular basis about<br />
how we go about implementing the Accord undertakings. And we will<br />
have regard to our achievements on the inflation and the employment<br />
front. But you and I both know that the Union movement can influence<br />
those outcomes, so can a lot of other groups and individuals in the<br />
community. So, I think the message today is also " look, we are<br />
prepared to pull our weight, but other people in the community have<br />
got to commence to face up to their responsibilities on the executive<br />
salary front, and associated activities". So, there it is full box and<br />
dice on the table for consideration and debate We are committed we<br />
are prepared to lead and make the hard decisions. Where are the<br />
employers and some of the corporate representatives? 23. Jun. 95 0: 07 No. 001 P. 09 </p>
<p>TEL:<br />
J: The document here says that the 600,000 jobs, Prime Minister, is an<br />
achievable minimum are you suggesting that you might actually<br />
overshoot the 600,000 target? And is is it possible to better the<br />
target by 2000/ 2001?<br />
PM: We have set the 5% target let's try and do our best with that. But we<br />
did exceed dramatically the last target of half a million. Remember<br />
that it was only 3 years ago in fact less, just before the last election<br />
when Accord Mark VII was entered into. And when I came out about<br />
negotiations, and talked about half a million jobs, we had all the cynics<br />
saying " ha ha tell us another one". Well, we have got 630,000 jobs.<br />
We got the half a million in 22 months. So this target here is one<br />
which I think given the way the economy is performing a high profit<br />
share, good levels of investment there's no reason to believe that we<br />
can't keep on doing it. But just have a look it's been a little over a<br />
month or so that we brought a surplus Budget in a surplus Budget. A<br />
billion reduction In the Bond Selling program from $ 21 billion last<br />
year to $ 6 billion this year with a long-term savings plan for the<br />
country, which will put about a trillion dollars into the savings bank of<br />
the country by the turn of the century by the end of this decade and<br />
about $ 2 trillion by 2020. Fifteen percent from every person minimum<br />
going in for every person in the workforce for their retirement. People<br />
on average weekly earnings coming out in retirement with about<br />
roughly a similar income in retirement. Within that short space of time,<br />
we have now introduced this which has a commitment to a wages<br />
system based on 2-3% inflation, the Award safety net protection's and<br />
all the other advances in the industrial relations system, and in<br />
enhancement of the enterprise bargaining flexibility stream. And also,<br />
the improvements in the social wage.<br />
I mean, I have been here for 25 years there's nothing like this under<br />
the Coalition. What have they got? The pathetic Headland speech<br />
which looked like it was written by a 1 st year backbencher you know,<br />
a pathetic document. And this stuff the other day which was published<br />
you know, from the Coalition talking about their policies ' this gives<br />
us the flexibility of announcing a lot of major a long-term visionary<br />
matters, but without committing ourselves to actually proceeding with<br />
them". I mean, you know, it has become a joke, hasn't it? I mean,<br />
there shouldn't even be a debate with the Coalition. The<br />
Government's processes are so superior and particularly under the<br />
Accord, with the whole workforce there is no discussion. If you jokers<br />
didn't want a contest, there wouldn't be one whatsoever. There is just<br />
policy mulch on the Coalition side, and rampant dishonesty. Imagine<br />
sitting in a meeting where you could see a sleazy document like the<br />
one like they produced lay on the table imagine that in a Labor<br />
Cabinet, compared to the quality and morality and commonsense of<br />
this stuff ( Accord Mark VIII). T2EL3: . Jun. 95 0: 07 No. 001 P. 1C </p>

J: Prime Minister, does this document mean that you are going to an<br />
election campaign promising to double the maternity allowance in the<br />
next term?<br />
PM: No. We have set an objective there. Again, if you look at what we did<br />
superannuation we have said that, with super in 80s, we want to<br />
move towards a much better provision of income and retirement for<br />
working people. And we started off with then we got it to and<br />
then we started moving towards and we got the SGC In, and we<br />
gradually rattled our way with economic growth and with economic<br />
capacity, up towards and now to 15%. We do things like this you<br />
have seen the advances with the Family Allowance Supplement: we<br />
started at a certain level, we improve the coverage, we lifted it to other<br />
levels. That's what we are going to do here with the Maternity<br />
Alowance we have started with 6 weeks, and we say on the<br />
document that we will be reviewing the allowance during the life of the<br />
Accord with the aim of improving it as economy and budgetary<br />
circumstances permit.<br />
J: Could you be announcing the first adjustment of that in an election<br />
context?<br />
PM; Well, as economic and budgetary circumstances permit.<br />
J: Mr Keating,.. ( inaudible).. what do YOU see as the major constraint on<br />
achieving this jobs growth... .( inaudible)<br />
PM; What really you are seeing today is you are seeing is the whole labour<br />
equation in the economy committing itself to that is, the l-a-b-o-u-r<br />
side of the equation committing itself to a system based on inflation of<br />
the order of That really means that our core competitiveness is<br />
going to be maintained. That means we are going to have good<br />
productivity growth in the economy, and hopefully, decent profits. And<br />
hopefully from that, good levels of investment we are certainly seeing<br />
it now. So, I don't think there is any problem in us believing that we<br />
will see that reflect itself well, well and truly in jobs. Now, we are back<br />
to, you know, a sustainable rate of economic growth 3.7% in the last<br />
year in the National Accounts. You saw the Budget forecasts for the<br />
next couple of years, and the constraint we have had with the Current<br />
Account Deficit you can see going Into place there a 4 percentage<br />
point of GOP change on fiscal policy and a 2 percentage point of GDP<br />
change on superannuation between now and the end of the decade,<br />
and a 4 percentage point change on superannuation between now and<br />
the year 2020. The Current Account problem is 2 1/ 2 percentage<br />
points roughly of GDP, so in terms of that savings equation, I mean,<br />
long-term savings fell during that period of high inflation in the 1970s.<br />
And Australians were burnt once it will take them a while to come<br />
back to it, so therefore the public sector has to save, and we have to<br />

go through vehicles like superannuation. But they are there. That's<br />
the point it's all there. The structure is all there.<br />
J, .( inaudible). . given the OECD survey yesterday given what some<br />
commentators [ like] the esteemed Maximillian Walsh, for example?<br />
PM: I'm not talking about I think we better leave individuals out of this,<br />
thank you. Don't provoke me. Okay thank you very much.<br />
MF: Thank you.<br />
