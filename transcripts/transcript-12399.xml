<p>Can I thank Wisden for the opportunity of participating in this very nice little ceremony. I didn't have a vote but let me say I have no quarrel at all with the decisions that are made. I saw four, I've seen four of the five play.  I of course (inaudible) of age didn't see Sir Jack Hobbs play.  I saw Sir Donald play only once.  That was here, his very last appearance at the Sydney Cricket Ground, the Kippax-Oldfield Testimonial where I reclined...I didn't recline really, it was very crowded, on the hill, to watch that.</p>
<p>But I think it's a great tribute to Wisden that it was able to assemble such a cross section of such a representative group of selectors to make the choice.  Wisden of course itself is part of cricket.  Anybody who loves cricket knows a lot about Wisden. Anybody who respects the traditions and the accuracy of the records of the game will understand how important Wisden is.</p>
<p>In their own individual styles these five cricketers have played a tremendous part in the affection for the game that so many of us have.  I have certainly, I'm very happy to say, that my enjoyment of the game has been very greatly enriched by the many times that I saw Garfield Sobers and Viv Richards and Shane Warne play.  I've never forgotten literally racing away from the very last law exams I sat at Sydney University to the Sydney Cricket Ground to see the Third Test in 1960 when Garfield Sobers hit 168 and contributed mightily to the West Indies victory on that occasion during that absolutely memorable series.</p>
<p>And I had the opportunity also in 1993 when I happened by sheer coincidence because of official duties to be in England at the same time as an Ashes tour I saw some magnificent bowling by Shane Warne during that series.</p>
<p>But the luncheon break is short.  Presentations are more important than the speeches.  But to those five wonderful gentlemen, one of whom is here - Viv Richards - and through their representatives convey to, well we can't to one, he's no longer with us - Sir Jack Hobbs.  But to convey our admiration for all that they have achieved and all that they've represented to the game.  I'll be very happy now to officiate Mr Hague.  Thank you.</p>
