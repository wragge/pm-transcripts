    <content><![CDATA[<p>Christmas is a time for both personal and national reflection.  </p>
<p>It is an occasion when most Australians seek renewal through the company of family and old friends.  As a nation we celebrate Christmas 2000 as an open, tolerant and united community.  We have much to be grateful for.</p>
<p>There are some of our fellow Australians, however, for whom Christmas will be a time of loneliness and despair.  Our thoughts and where possible the hand of friendship should be extended to them.  All Australians should also remember those in the defence forces who through service in East Timor, Bougainville and elsewhere will be prevented from spending Christmas with loved ones.</p>
<p>Janette and I wish all Australians and their families a Merry Christmas.</p>
<p>24 December 2000 </p>
