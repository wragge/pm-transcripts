    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth, Tasmania and Launceston City Council have signed an historic City Deal to create jobs, boost wages and drive a strong economic future for the North.</p>
<p>The centrepiece of the deal is the $260 million commitment to move the University of Tasmania’s main Launceston campus to Inveresk near the city centre.</p>
<p>This goes hand-in-hand with the City Deal’s $19.4 million support for Launceston’s City Heart project, which will rejuvenate Launceston’s historic CBD. The first milestone payment is expected in August 2017.</p>
<p>These projects will deliver more than 480 local jobs and apprenticeships, 225 university positions and the capacity for 10,000 more student places. The new university campus will boost the local economy, support industry-led research and development, and help establish Launceston as a vibrant university city.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the City Deal will maximise Launceston’s potential through more than $280 million in investment across all three levels of government and the University of Tasmania.</p>
<p>Tasmanian Premier Will Hodgman said the five-year plan builds on Launceston’s strengths—its heritage heart, family-friendly community, unique natural environment, high quality university and research sector.</p>
<p>Launceston’s Mayor, Albert van Zetten, welcomed the Deal’s focus on delivering jobs and growth and shaping a vibrant, confident city. Importantly, the City Deal reflects the views and ideas of the community and will be implemented with key local partners.</p>
<p>The City Deal marks the start of the next positive chapter for Launceston—enhancing the city’s reputation as an attractive place to live, work, invest in and visit. </p>
