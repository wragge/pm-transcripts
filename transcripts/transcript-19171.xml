<p>The $862 million upgrade of the Pacific Highway between Tintenbar and Ewingsdale is progressing well with important work continuing in the next three months. </p>
<p>This project is a good example of getting on with the job of upgrading the Pacific Highway from Hexham to the Queensland border.</p>
<p>The 17 kilometre Tintenbar to Ewingsdale upgrade starts at the northern end of the Ballina bypass at Ross Lane and will upgrade the highway to a four-lane divided road to the Ewingsdale interchange.</p>
<p>The upgrade will reduce travel times, freight transport costs and boost safety. The improved road alignment will increase road capacity and travel distance.</p>
<p>When completed it will provide benefits such as interchanges for motorists to safely enter and exit the highway and a continuous alternative local road link between Tintenbar and Ewingsdale for school buses and motorists who do not wish to use the upgraded highway.</p>
<p>Work in the next three months will include:• Clearing of vegetation, bulk earthwork, installation of erosion and sediment controls, fencing, drainage installation, building large drains and water quality basins  • Building of bridges at Minor, Emigrant, Skinners, Byron and Tinderbox creeks and Broken Head Road• Continued controlled blasting at the southern tunnel entrance and the start of controlled blasting at the northern tunnel entrance • Start of St Helena tunnel excavation  • Completing building on the site compound at Ewingsdale and starting site compound building at Minor Creek and the southern tunnel entrance  • Local road upgrades at Bangalow Road• Local road upgrade of Tinderbox Road• Building further site access gates at Newrybar and Bangalow• Implementation of temporary traffic diversions along Broken Head Road • Working on the Pacific Highway at Bangalow and Ewingsdale to establish contra-flow traffic arrangements for future work• Rock crushing work near Ross Lane, the old fish farm, William Flick Drive and the tunnel openings.</p>
<p>Work on the upgrade is generally carried out on weekdays from 7am to 6pm and on Saturday between 8am and 1pm.</p>
<p>Traffic management and reduced speed limits will be in place where needed to ensure the safety of workers, motorists and other road users.</p>
<p>Motorists are advised to plan their journey, allow extra travel time and follow all signs.</p>
<p>Residents and businesses are invited to attend the next round of community information sessions for the project. The meetings will be held on Tuesday 26 March at Bangalow A &amp; I Hall, Station Street, Bangalow. The first meeting will run from midday and the second from 5.30pm. </p>
