AUSTRALIAN LOANS IN THE UNITED-STATES<br />
A series of loan agreements has been successfully<br />

the Export-Import Bank and United States commercial banks.<br />
The Export-Import Bank has agreed to lend the<br />
Commonwealth $ US 50 million 44.6 million),. in two tranches<br />
of $ US 25 million each, to finance the importation of specified<br />
categories of capital equipment from the United. States. Since<br />
the Export-Import Bank is an agency of the . United-States<br />
Government, the loans are not subject to the U. S. Interest<br />
Equalization Tax. The first tranche of the new loan will carry an<br />
interest rate of 7 per cent per annum and will be issued at<br />
par. It will mature finally in 1983,<br />
The second loan is for an amount of $ US 75 million<br />
67 million) to assist in financing the purchase of 2~ 4<br />

The loan will carry an interest rate of 6 per<br />
cent and will be issued at par. Repayment of amounts drawn<br />
will be spread over 7 years.<br />

$ US 53 million 47.3 million) to assist in financing the<br />
purchase by Qantas Airways Ltd. of four Boeing 7147 (" Jumbo<br />

<p>One half of the loan will be. provided by the<br />
Export-Import Bank and the Boeing Company, and the other half<br />
by a syndicate of United States commercial. banks.<br />
The proposed expenditure in. the United States<br />
on the four aircraft and related equipment is $ US 132 million,<br />
of which Qantas will finance 20 per cent from its own<br />
resources. The Commonwealth will be looking to borrow the<br />
remainder in two tranches of approximately $ US. 53 million<br />
each, and the present loan represents the first. tranche.<br />
Interest on the Export-Import Bank/ Boeing portion<br />
will be at 6 per cent, and on the commercial bank portion<br />
will be one-half per cent above the Morgan. Guaranty Trust<br />
Company's prime rate,. with a minimum of 5.5 per cent and a<br />
maximum of 7 per cent. At present, this would mean a rate<br />
of 6-3/ 4 per cent. The loan will be repaid over a period<br />
of 7 years. The. fourth loan agreement. covers a-borrowing of<br />
$ US 2.5 million 2,3 million) to assist in financing the<br />
purchase by Trans-Australia. Airlines of its. fifth-Boeing<br />

and will be repaid over 7 years.<br />
An agreement which the Treasurer signed on<br />
behalf of the Commonwealth Government with the Union Bank of<br />
Switzerland in Zurich two weeks ago provided for a loan of<br />
approximately 10 million Swiss francs to complete the financing<br />
of this purchase. When account is taken of the recent 200 million<br />

loan agreements totalling approximately $ A 208 million have<br />
