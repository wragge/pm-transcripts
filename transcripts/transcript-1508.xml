PREMIERS' CONFERENCE, 16TH FEBRUARY, 1967 6// 0 ' I 9<br />
Commonwealth-State Financial Relations<br />
The discussion at the Premiers' Conference today<br />
covered a wide range of matters affecting Commonwealth-State<br />
financial relations. It was agreed that consideration of longer-term<br />
questions would be resumed at the Premiers' Conference to<br />
be held towards the end of the current financial year. In<br />
the meantime, however, the Commonwealth put forward certain<br />
proposals which were designed to provide further assistance<br />
to the State Budgets in 1966/ 67.<br />
Details of these proposals, which were accepted by<br />
the States, are attached. </p>
<p>PREMIERS' CONFERENCE2. FEBRUA RY 1967<br />
Financial Assistance Grants<br />
Statement by-the. Commonwealth<br />
Present Formula Under the States Grants Act 1965 the financial<br />
assistance grant for each State for each financial year of<br />
the present grants arrangements is determined by taking that<br />
State's grant for the previous year ( with the addition of<br />
$ 2 million each year in the case of Queensland) and:-<br />
Increasing it by the percentage change in the<br />
Population of that State during the year ended<br />
31st December of the year of payment;<br />
The amount so obtained under is increased<br />
by the percentage increase in average wages<br />
for Australia as a whole fot the financial year<br />
immediately preceding the year of payment; and<br />
The amount so obtained under is increased<br />
by a betterment factor of 1.2 per cent;<br />
Proposed Formula It is now proposed that, in future, the inicreasq in aveW<br />
wages used in calculating each ye'ar's grants ( including . the<br />
grants for the current financial year) should be the increase<br />
for the twelve months ended March in th~ k year of payment.<br />
Thus, the time-lag before movements in Wages are reflected in<br />
the grants will be reduced from one year to three months. The<br />
other elements of the formula will remain' unchanged.<br />
The effect of this proposal on the amount of the<br />
financial assistance grants for the current financial year<br />
cannot be calculated precisely until figures showing the<br />
increase in average wages for the twelve months ending 31st<br />
March 1967 become available. On present indications, it is<br />
estimated that the increase in average wages will be about<br />
5.25 per cent or possibly 5.50 per cent. The effect on this<br />
year's grants using each of these figures is as follows:-<br />

<p>Further Addition for 1966/ 67<br />
The Commonwealth is also prepared to make available<br />
to the States an amount of $ 5,000 000 as a special non-recurring<br />
addition to the grants payable under the formula in 1966/ 67.<br />
This amount will be distributed among the States in the same<br />
proportions as the grants produced by the formula.<br />
The approximate distribution of this amount among<br />
the States is set out below:-<br />
