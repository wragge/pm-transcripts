FOR MEDIA 2 OCTOBER 1987<br />
I will visit Singapore on 27 and 28 November and the<br />
Soviet Union from 29 November to 2 December.<br />
,4<br />
The visit to the Soviet Union follows an invitation from the<br />
Soviet Government extended by the Soviet Foreign Minister,<br />
Mr Shevardnadze, during his visit to Australia earlier this<br />
year. I will be accompanied by the minister for Foreign Affairs<br />
and Trade, Mr Hayden.<br />
The visit comes at a time of important developments in<br />
Soviet policy and will provide a timely opportunity to<br />
explore further prospects for developing Australian-Sovietrelations.<br />
I look forward to discussing with Soviet leaders a range of<br />
international and bilateral issues, both economic and<br />
political, particularly in the light of the projected<br />
conclusion of the US and Soviet agreement on intermediate<br />
nuclear forces and the Summit meeting between President<br />
Reagan and Mr Gorbachev.<br />
The USSR is an important trading partner of Australia and a<br />
group of prominent. Australian businessmen will be in Moscow<br />
during the visit.<br />
The visit will also include Leningrad.<br />
In Singapore, I will be having discussions with<br />
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew on international and regional<br />
issues of mutual interest.<br />
I will also deliver the 1987 Singapore Lecture, under the<br />
auspices of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, at the<br />
invitation of Mr S. Rajaratnam, Senior minister in the<br />
Prime Minister's Office. 0 0 1 </p>
