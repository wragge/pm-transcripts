FOR MEDIA 22 DECEMBER 1987<br />
I am pleased to announce that this afternoon the<br />
Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory have<br />
agreed to take major initiatives in the area of gun control.<br />
This meeting presented us with the opportunity to exercise<br />
leadership on a matter of increasing, and justified, public<br />
concern. The Governments represented at today's meeting agreed that<br />
the cost we ad a society are paying for guns is unacceptably<br />
high. we agreed we have the obligation to take what steps we can<br />
to minimise the risk to the Australian public, and to ensure<br />
our public places and our homes remain as free as possible<br />
from the prospect of injury or death by guns.<br />
Gun related violence is now a daily feature of our lives.<br />
If guns were not readily available, many crimes which today<br />
result in bloodshed or the threat of bloodshed would be much<br />
less serious and dangerous incidents.<br />
The meeting noted the advances which have been made in the<br />
Police Ministers' Council towards achieving uniformity.<br />
With the exception of Tasmania, the meeting has asked the<br />
Council to address as a matter of urgency and report back to<br />
a Premiers' Conference on the following issues:<br />
A ban on all automatic and semi-automatic firearms<br />
Strict licensing of each person to possess a firearm<br />
Requirement to obtain a permit to purchase each firearm<br />
Registration of all firearms<br />
Restrictions on the sale of ammunition<br />
Restrictions on the availability of manuals relating to<br />
the construction of weapons<br />
we have also:<br />
Asked the Council to look at the questions of possible<br />
compensation and amnesty for the surrender of firearms 00.3 670C </p>
<p>Asked the Attorneys-General to examine the issue of<br />
specific extra penalties for the use of firearms in<br />
criminal offences<br />
The Commmonwealth Government in consultation with the States<br />
and the Northern Territory through the Standing Committee of<br />
Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General, will urgently<br />
examine the question of violent films and videos with a view<br />
to reinforcing the banning of depictions of violence,<br />
cruelty and sexual violence. Included in this examination<br />
will be the question of assisting parents by making clear,<br />
by adequate labelling, the violent content of videos, and<br />
the question of establishing uniform national standards on<br />
video classifications and availability.<br />
The meeting also has asked the Censorship Board and the<br />
Films Board of Review to urgently implement stringent<br />
application of current guidelines where overt violence is<br />
portrayed. The meeting expressed concern at the continuous, graphic<br />
display of violence through the visual media.<br />
In addition the Commonwealth is taking the following steps<br />
to facilitate gun control:<br />
Amending customs regulations to ban the importing of all<br />
automatic and semi-automatic rifles<br />
Banning sales of semi-automatic rifles from the Lithgow<br />
arms factory to members of the public<br />
Placing strict controls on the disposal of surplus army<br />
weapons Taking steps to ensure that rifle clubs comply with<br />
State and Northern Territory legislation<br />

the purchasing of weapons at a distance.<br />
Whilst availability of firearms is an important element in<br />
community violence, clearly it is the actions of people that<br />
cause the violence:<br />
The meeting recognised the need to stringently limit the<br />
access to weapons by people who may have a tendency to<br />
violence.<br />
In taking these steps, we fully recognise that the reasons<br />
for violence in our society are deep and complex. To assist<br />
i-n the understanding and combatting of such violence, we<br />
have authorised the setting up of a National Committee on<br />
Violence to look at related psychological and social<br />
questions. The Committee will have a broad membership and<br />
costs will be born by each of the participating governments. 003671 </p>

Notwithstanding td1ay's agreement, the Premiers of New South<br />
Wales and Victoria feel that the proposals do not go far<br />
enough. The proposals do not recognise that the need to ensure the<br />
safety and effective protection of the community from<br />
firearms misuse is paramount. It supersedes the rights and<br />
interests of gun owners.<br />
Mr Cain and Mr Unsworth called for the introduction of<br />
uniform legislation across the States and Territories which<br />
prohibits the private ownership of guns except under<br />
narrowly defined occupational and sporting exceptions.<br />
The measures announced today represent a new co-operative<br />
approach between the Commonwealth, the States and the<br />
Northern Territory in the area of gun control.<br />
It is our hope and belief that as a result of these steps<br />
lives will be saved and that the level of fear in our<br />
community will be reduced.<br />
I thank the Premiers, their representatives and the Chief<br />
Minister for their attendance at these discussions at short<br />
notice and for their co-operative approach which has enabled<br />
us to reach agreement this afternoon. 0036' 2 </p>
