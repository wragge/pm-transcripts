FOR MEDIA 15 MAY 1979<br />
LAUNCHING OF THE SIR ROBERT MENZIES MEMORIAL TRUST APPEAL<br />
( SPEECH AS DELIVERED)<br />
It gives me a great deal of pleasure to support His Excellency<br />
in the remarks he made this morning to launch the appeal for<br />
the Sir Robert Menzies Memorial Foundation. I am sure that<br />
the appeal will have a very ready response right around<br />
Australia, in all States and from all people, in all walks<br />
of life throughout Australia.<br />
We may be still too close to Sir Robert Menzies' own time to<br />
be able to assess fully the mark that he left on Austalian<br />
life, on political life, on the character and development of<br />
Australia. But as time passes I believe that his role will<br />
be written in even-firmer terms than might be by some<br />
contemporary historians. The character that he imparted to<br />
this nation, the leadership that he gave to Australians through<br />
many times, as a Parliamentarian and as a person, has no equal<br />
in Australian history.<br />
The progress of Australia during his years was very great.<br />
It was a period of great Australian development. Australia<br />
abroad, as His Excellency the Governor-General has indicated,<br />
became a nation to be listened to for the first time. But it<br />
wasn't only in these grand things that his attention, patience<br />
and energy was directed. During his time welfare, income<br />
security for disadvantaged people, was begun in Australia<br />
in a realistic way. His concern for education was in a<br />
very real sense a personal1 involvement when he took the<br />
Commonwealth into the great expansion of Australian<br />
universities, the development of the National University,<br />
and the other universities around Australia. That Commonwealth<br />
support enabled an expansion to take place which surely has<br />
benefitted tens, indeed hundreds of thousands of young<br />
Australians. That, I think, is one of his greatest memorials.<br />
The development of Canberra itself, again, owes much to<br />
Sir Robert Menzies' initiative. But something more than that<br />
is needed I believe for an Australian who has done so much<br />
for his country. Therefore, thle-Sir Robert Menzies National<br />
Foundation is launched today to stand as a permanent personal<br />
memorial to the service he gave Australia. / 2 </p>
<p>The purpose of the Foundation, as His Excellency has said,<br />
is to promote health, fitness and physical achievement for<br />
all Australians, and particularly for young Australians.<br />
The Foundation will seek to improve our knowledge of health,<br />
to encourage better health and fitness and thereby help more<br />
Australians to lead more rewarding lives in work and<br />
recreation. It will do this by supporting research in<br />
medical schools and elsewhere into health, fitness and<br />
physical achievement, by promoting public education on<br />
these subjects and by encouraging better recreation<br />
facilities for the community.<br />
In support of the appeal, and as the first donor, but I<br />
hope not the largest donor, I have pleasure in announcing<br />
that the Commonwealth will donate $ 2 million to the appeal.<br />
We will also match all other donations on a dollar for dollar<br />
basis. As a further gentle inducement to others to seek to match<br />
and surpass the Commonwealth's effort, donations will of<br />
course be tax deductible.<br />
The State and National Committees of the Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Memorial Trust have given freely of their time and searched<br />
for the best memorial, the best purpose. I believe they have<br />
come out well. I would like to thank the members of the<br />
State and National Committees for what they have done to this<br />
point, but I suspect that over the next three or four months<br />
the greatest time and energy will be involved.<br />
It is very much an investment in the future an investment<br />
in the future of Australia, but particularly an investment in<br />
the future Of young Australians.<br />
Your Excellency, I believe it is a fitting tribute indeed to<br />
Sir Robert Menzies.<br />
