JOURNAL, ST: On nucle ar disarmamnent -ird no~ n erat ion,<br />
2, re ,' ou ascsured by Ms Bhutto's attitude? </p>
<p>PM: Yes, there is no doubt that as far as Pakistan is<br />
concerned, as the position has been put by her, she's given<br />
the unequivocal undertaking that the purposes of the<br />
Pakistani nuclear program are for peaceful purposes. Shie's<br />
been quite unequivocal about that and has indicated the<br />
preparedness of Pakistan, either i~ n a universal sense or<br />
importantly in1 a regional 3ense, to arrive at some sort of<br />
agreement which would commit Pakistan to that position.<br />
Obviously they want a reciprocity as far as Indid is<br />
concerned and what I've said in my discussions with Bhutto is<br />
that we think it would be useful for us, Australia and<br />
Pakistan, to have bilateral discussions on disarmament<br />
issues, including nuclear issues. There's been a positive<br />
response by her to that proposal and quite obviously, without<br />
going into detail, I would be looking at a similar sort of<br />
concept with Mr Gandhi. So again, as you know always without<br />
overstating what Australia can do in these sorts of issues, I<br />
think this imay be another case where with the very good<br />
credentials that Australia has in the field of disarmament<br />
generally and nuclear disarmament issues in particular, that<br />
we may be able to exercise some useful influence in perhaps<br />
getting a better and more acceptable outcome on this<br />
important issue, because as the Pakistani Prime Minister and<br />
myself have both agreed, it would indeed be a paradox arid a<br />
tragedy if at a time when between the superpowers you are<br />
seeing~ a process which involves the reduction of armaments<br />
and of nuclear capacities, there ere to be a build-up in<br />
this region and she shares that view. It would, both in<br />
termns of security be a tragedy and a paradox, and it would be<br />
a gross misallocation of resources in a subcontinent which is<br />
desperately needing all the resources it can for the<br />
uplifting of its people.<br />
JOURNALIST: Who would undertake those talks and when would<br />
you envisage that they would take place?<br />
PM: What I've suggested with the Prime Minister is that.<br />
those talks should be at an officials' level. I believet that<br />
that's what will occur.<br />
JOURNALIST: She said that Pakistan would sign the NPT if<br />
India signed the NPT. Will you be pushing Rajiv Gandhi?<br />
PM: As you know I don't make a practice of<br />
JOURNALIST: Ask him?<br />
PM: That was not the point I'm going to make.<br />
Occasionally you give little gentle pushes, but I don't make<br />
a practice of disclosing before I meet with a national leader<br />
just what I'm going to say to him. I don't think that's fair<br />
to him or in a sense to me.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think it's up to Rajiv Gandhi to try to<br />
break the logjam over the NPT? Do you think that it's<br />
India's move now? </p>
<p>PM: Let me put it this way, that there is a clear statement<br />
of position by the Pakistani Prime Minister on behalf of her<br />
government and her nation. Clearly they put their position<br />
in terms of acquiring a reciprocity by India. So in a sense<br />
that now ask that what is the response of India, you'ye<br />
got to understand that in the case of India they would be<br />
putting into their equation and their calculation not just<br />
relationship with Pakistan but consideration to relations<br />
with China. But obviously this is an issue that I will be<br />
talkinq at some length with my friend Rajiv Gandhi about. I<br />
believe that given the nature of our relationship and the<br />
discussions I've been able to have here, it should be another<br />
useful discussion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you enjoy meeting EBenazir Bhutto? Did you<br />
get along well with her?<br />
PM: Yes, I think we got on excellently together. I wished<br />
I'd been 100% fit I've had a little bit of the flu but I<br />
think that crisis is passing but yes, I've enjoyed her<br />
company very much. One of the interesting things about it is<br />
the sheer joy she's experiencing in being in this position.<br />
When you consider the expectations that she would have had<br />
less than 12 months ago, the suffering that she had gone<br />
through and those close to her who now form part of the<br />
ministry, the imprisonment that they've suffered, the torture<br />
that some of them have suffered. Now to be in the position<br />
of power is obviously something which is in a proper sense<br />
very exhilerating for her. She's working extremely hard, she<br />
is well informed and briefed on the range of issues that I<br />
talked with her about and she obviously has a great õ ense cif<br />
co-operation with her ministers. Yes, I find it interesting,<br />
stimlulating, and I certainly look forward to working futher<br />
with her in the future.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you expecting her to be a long term<br />
fixture on the Pakistani political scene?<br />
is PM: She deserves to be.<br />
