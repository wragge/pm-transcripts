    <content><![CDATA[<p><font size="3">Throughout this year, Australiaâs exchanges with the United States on East Timor have been intense at all levels â political, diplomatic and military.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">I reject completely the suggestion in todayâs edition of The Australian that there have been "failings" in cooperation with the United States on East Timor. Indeed, the cooperation with the United States, and the US support for the Australian-led multi-national force in East Timor, have shown that the alliance relationship works.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">I categorically reject the suggestion that Australia has held back from the United States information and intelligence on East Timor. On the contrary, exchanges have been amongst the most intense that we have ever had. US officials have expressed satisfaction with the cooperation.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">It was clear from conversations that I had myself in Auckland that US defence authorities and the highest levels of the Administration were fully across the contribution that we sought from the United States for the multi-national force in East Timor. Moreover, I was assured of the Administrationâs satisfaction with the level of discussion taking place between our defence forces.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Both Mr Downer and Mr Moore and their officials have been in close contact with the US Administration throughout.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Moreover, the decision the Government took earlier this year to put a second brigade on a higher level of readiness indicates that we were well prepared for possible difficulties in East Timor.</font></p>
