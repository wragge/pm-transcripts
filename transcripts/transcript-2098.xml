FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 66/ 1969<br />
SAILING SHIPS FOR COOK CELEBRATIONS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Two Governments have confirmed that they will be<br />
sending sailing ships to Australia to take part in next year's Captain<br />
Cook Bicentenary Celebrations.<br />
Chile's training barquentine, " Esmeralda", will<br />
be in Sydney for the re-enactment of the landing ceremony at<br />
Botany Bay on 29 April. Japan's cadet training barque, " Nippon<br />
Maru", will also be here for the Bicentenary Celebrations, but<br />
her sailing schedule is still being worked out.<br />
I am delighted that the Chilean and Japanese<br />
Governments have been able to accept our invitation, and I am<br />
sure these sailing vessels, which are among the few remaining<br />
in the world, will be assured of a warm welcome.<br />
Several other Governments have indicated<br />
informally that they are considering sending ships to Australia<br />
for the celebrations.<br />
