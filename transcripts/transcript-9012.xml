TRANSCRIPT OF THlE PRIME MINISTER, THlE HON P. J KEATING, MY<br />
EXTRACTS FROM JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE, MEDIA CENTRE,<br />
HAWAII BEACH HOTEL, LIMASSOL, FRIDAY, 22 OCTOBER 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
His Excellency Mr Glafcos Clerides:<br />
We have had our afternoon break and because we have concluded the<br />
discussion of a very important subject and because we have reached a decision<br />
we thought that during the break, we would come and inform you about the<br />
decision taken. With regard to the importance of the decision I have four<br />
Prime Ministers with me who will explain the importance of the decision..<br />
P1K: Mr President, I don't think I have much more to add to that, but to say that the<br />
importance of the statement is that it exists, that it has come from a diverse<br />
group, most from the developing countries including the least developed<br />
countries, two G7 countries, four members of the (" airns Group represented at<br />
CHOGM. It is a substantial statement at a critical -drne. There are 55 days left<br />
only to the December 15 deadline and we are calling on the relevant countries<br />
to endorse the Draft Final Act including the Blair House Accord which was a<br />
substantial part of it. The key point is that the inte:. ests of all participants are<br />
factored into the GATT Round as it now stands. The Round began with an<br />
ambitious proposal to-look after the traditional areis of goods and then moving<br />
it to services, intellectual property rights and agriculture and including, of<br />
course, much of the agriculture of the developing world. I think what has been<br />
agreed in the Draft Final Act and the Blair House, Accord are key minimums for<br />
a successful conclusion of the Round. So, the minimums are in place, the<br />
Round can be successfully concluded, there has to be some give on the part of<br />
a number of countries and the Round could be successfully concluded and I<br />
think the point of the delegation is to impress upon selected countries the<br />
importance which a representative group like CHOGM believes is important<br />
for the things which Prime Minister Major said fj-ee trade, growth and jobs.<br />
J: Can I ask Prime Minister Keating, how he would describe any Heads of<br />
Government in key capitals visited who prove imf ervious to the arguments of<br />
this delegation?<br />
P1K: I didn't quite get the sense of the question. The fact that this is such a<br />
representative group, say covering four Cairns Group countries, two G7 </p>
<p>2<br />
countries and a lot of developing countries, it has status by virtue of the fact<br />
that this statement exists and that there is a willingness and a wish to see the<br />
Round concluded. Now, as people know, much has been done to get to a<br />
point of conclusion as Prime Minister Major has sid. There are a few areas<br />
outstanding and they are the matters which I think we should wish to focus<br />
upon and that is why as the Secretary General said, a decision about which<br />
places, that is which Governments will be visited and by whom will be the key<br />
points.<br />
