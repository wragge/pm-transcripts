STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ. KEATING<br />
NIP THE SPEAKER, THE HON LB. MCLFAY MP<br />
Contrary to media reports tonight, I have not applied any pressure to the<br />
Speaker Leo McLxay to resign his position.<br />
In a conversation with the Speaker this evening, I have assured him that I am<br />
prepared to await the outcome of the review now being conducted by Sir<br />
Laurence Street. I believe all fair minded people would have the same view.<br />
The matter in question is a compensation matter the damages over which were<br />
awarded by an officer of the Commonwealth.<br />
I have every confidence that Sir Laurence Street will find that the Speaker has<br />
acted in an entirely proper manner.<br />
CANBERRA February 1993 </p>
