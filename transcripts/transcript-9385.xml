    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIIMNIES TE<br />SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATLNG, MP<br />PRESENTATION OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S EMPLOYER OF THE<br />YEAR AWARD, PARLIAMENT HOUSE CANBERRA, 19 OCTOBER<br />1994. 1 welcome the opportunity to be with you today, for the presentation of the<br />Prime Minister's Employer of the Year Awards.<br />These awards help all of us communicate a very important message to the<br />Australian community.<br />That message is about the economic and social benefits of employing people<br />with a disability. It is simple and uncontroversial, but we have to repeat it often<br />because it is often ignored. It goes like this:<br />To grow, as an economy and as a nation, we have to make the most of<br />all our resources, and this includes the talents and energies of people<br />with disabilities. We must ensure that everyone has an opportunity to<br />contribute and share in Australia's growth.<br />This message under-pins our broad commitments on social justice and access and<br />equity. It also meshes with the " Working Nation" agenda, outlined in the White<br />Paper on Employment released in May this year.<br />Through the Employer of the Year Awards we help to turn the message into<br />reality by acknowledging and supporting Australian employers who lead the<br />way in encouraging and assisting people with a disability to join the workforce.<br />We also recognise and demonstrate, practically, the significant contributions<br />people with disabilities make.</p>
<p>2<br />People with a disability have shown that they are willing and able to take up the<br />challenge of working in mainstream employment.<br />People with a disability have proven they do bring special attributes to the<br />workplace, in terms of dedication to the job, low levels of absenteeism and staff<br />turnover. In the right job, with the ight training and support, they offer as much as any<br />worker. People with a disability want, and have the right to, a fair go to compete in the<br />open labour market and employers need a skilled and reliable workforce.<br />The Employer of the Year Awards recognise that once barriers to equal<br />employment opportunity are overcome, everyone employers, employees and<br />the community stands to benefit.<br />Over 300 employers around Australia have been nominated for this year's<br />awards. This is a record number of nomdiations and shows the real advances<br />being made in human resource management practices by Australian businesses.<br />It also shows our message is being received.<br />The Awards have been part of the Government's wider process of reform in<br />disability policy over the last ten years.<br />By changing existing supports, and introducing new services, our reforms have<br />helped people with a disability to have many of the same opportunities to<br />participate in the life and work of the community as anyone else. These are<br />opportunities which many without a disability take for granted.<br />The Disability Services Act of 1986 went a long way to address long-standing<br />barriers faced by Australians with disabilities.<br />The Disability Reform Package brought fundamental improvements to<br />assistance provided for people with a disability. This included the development<br />of further measures to assist open and supported employment for people with a<br />disability. A key feature is the linking of income support for people with<br />disabilities, with education, training and work opportunities.</p>
<p>Many of you will know of a more recent development, the Supported Wage<br />system, which involves wages based on skills and productive capacity and<br />income supplementation through the Social Security system. This will allow<br />employers to employ people with a disability on a pro rata award wage, where<br />necessary, and will greatly increase job opportunities for people with more<br />severe disabilities.<br />The Disability Discrimination Act, which came into effect in 1993, makes<br />discrimination on the grounds of disability unlawfiul, including in employment<br />situations. Now, through work in developing an Australian Disability Strateg, we are<br />embarking on a comprehensive and systematic effort to address barriers to<br />access, equality and participation for people with a disability.<br />The Strategy will provide a plan of action across Government programs to<br />comply with our own Disability Discrimination Act and the United Nations<br />Standard Rules on the Equalisation of Opportunities for Persons with<br />Disabilities. Under the Strategy equal opportunity goals for people with a disability will be<br />set out and we will define ways to achieve them over the next ten years. A plan<br />of action has been developed covering Federal programs and responsibilities.<br />We are also working with State and Territory Governments to develop a<br />national Australian Disability Strategy for the next ten years.<br />My colleague, Carmen Lawrence, as the Minister for Human Services, has<br />recently announced the formation of the Australian Disability Consultative<br />Council, to advise the Government on the development and implementation of<br />the Strategy.<br />In the Employment White Paper, we expanded the employment assistance<br />available to people with a disability through:<br />a better access to labour market programs through the Job Compact;</p>
<p>S greater emphasis on individual case management with relevant case<br />managers having a lighter case load and greater resources;<br />more employment assistance through additional places in the<br />Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service and Disability Services Program;<br />and<br />S ongoing funding for specialist psychiatric pilot units.<br />Before I hand back to Dr Lawrence, I want to thank everyone who has helped<br />with these awards.<br />I would like to thank the ACTU, and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and<br />Industry, for their support. You are key players in this work.<br />Finally, I would like to thank and congratulate all those employers present, and<br />the Awards finalists in particular, for their outstanding effort to ensure that<br />people with a disability have the rights, choices and opportunities that most<br />Australians take for granted.<br />Your efforts and these awards demonstrate the benefits of harnessing the skills<br />and abilities of people with a disability.<br />In this way we are all contributing to building a fairer and better Australia.</p>
