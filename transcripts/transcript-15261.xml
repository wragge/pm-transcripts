<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>Every year about 34,000 young Australians take a gap year between finishing Year 12 and embracing a long-term career or starting tertiary education.</p>
<p>Some head off on a working holiday, take a short term job or volunteer their time to a charity. </p>
<p>We'd like to offer them another choice - a gap year in the Australian Defence Force to see if a career in the Navy, the Army or the Air Force is something they'd consider.</p>
<p>Serving the country through the ADF is extremely rewarding and one of the most respected career choices a young person can make. The gap year program provides a great opportunity for 17 to 24 year olds to do something very worthwhile for their country while gaining new skills at the same time.</p>
<p>From tonight we'll be screening new television advertisements to promote the new program.</p>
<p>Later today I'll officially launch the new Defence Gap Year with more detail about the generous conditions and incentives we're offering.</p>
<p>If you're interested in finding out a little bit more about it visit defencejobs.gov.au or text GAP to 13 19 01.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for watching.</p>
