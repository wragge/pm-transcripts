I am just back from the Kennedy Round discussions<br />
and negotiations and these will represent the subject matter to<br />
which I address myself today. These were interesting and important<br />
in themselves but with possibilities and repercussions that not<br />
everyone quite realises.<br />
I thought that before I turn to speak to you of some<br />
of the facts and aspects of the Kennedy Round, I might make a few<br />
general observations of our trading circumstances that would bring<br />
the Kennedy Round and he possibility of Britain joining the<br />
Common Market into what I believe to be the correct perspective of<br />
importance. FOREIGN EXCHANGE VITAL<br />
Australia s a major trading nation. For us our balance<br />
of payments are of tremendous importance to our economic growth.<br />
Over the last 10 years our growth in Australia has<br />
meant we have been geared to import requirements of about 13% of<br />
our gross national product -a quite u~ nusually high percentage of<br />
imports. In terms of current prices this means imports valued<br />
at just over $ 2,800 million, to which must be added a bill for the<br />
so-called invisible items such as freight, dividends, royalties, etc.<br />
now in excess of a further $ 1,400 million.<br />
We cannot develop without earning foreign exchange to<br />
pay for these imports and essential services which are basic to<br />
our development and which now are running at the combined level of<br />
., s4,2OO mil. In 1965/ 66 exports and other invisible earnings<br />
provided almost 80% of our foreign exchange requirements. The<br />
rest came from the essential element of capital inflow Government<br />
borrowings and private capital flowing in.<br />
However, experience has shown this capital inflow to<br />
be a fairly unpredictable element in our growth requirements. For<br />
example, in 1965/ 66 we had a high level of capital inflow amounting<br />
to $ 938 mil. whereas THIS YEAR we look like receiving ONLY HALF<br />
this amount.\ </p>
<p>Growth we must have and indeed growth we will have.<br />
iff we are to achieve something approaching a<br />
growth rate on average between now and the mid-1970' s, it is<br />
reasonable to expect that expenditure on imports alone to meet<br />
the demands of this growth could well be of the order of $ 4,700 mil.<br />
compared with $ 2,800 mil. in 1965/ 66. This means that we can<br />
contemplate a rise of exchange to pay for imports of 6% each year.<br />
Allowing for capital inflow at a reasonable level,<br />
by the mid-1970' s exports will need to be earning $ 5,000 mil. a<br />
year to cover their share of our overall foreign exchange requirements.<br />
I recount these figures to place in its proper<br />
perspective the importance of the role of export earnings.<br />
As a nation we will grow in strength, or we will<br />
wither according to the adequacy of our export earnings. It is<br />
against this that I propose with you to have a look at the<br />
Kennedy Round.<br />
THE KIENNEDY ROUND The basic aim of the Kennedy Roundwas to obtain a<br />
significant reduction of trade barrier-s by wqy of an across-theboard<br />
cut in tar-iffs and concurrently a reduction in non-tariff<br />
barriers. Australia's tariff making policy with the Tariff<br />
Board is designed to give sufficient protection to Austrialian<br />
industries, but the whole concept of the Tariff Board is not less<br />
importantly to avoid giving excess protection to our industries,<br />
Clearly a proposal to cut all our protective tariffs<br />
by 50% is a proposal that ould be completely destructive of the<br />
Australian economy and entirely unacceptable.<br />
So at the first Ministerial meeting of the Kennedy<br />
Round in 1963 I had a fierce and long battle at Geneva to have<br />
Australia absolved from the 50% cut and to have it accepted that<br />
Australia should pay in tariff reductions only that which would<br />
equitably reflect the advantages gained in the dismantling of nontariff<br />
barriers to our major exports.<br />
For the first time in negotiations in G. A. T. T. we<br />
had the prospect of meagingful negotiations on the bulk commoditieswheat<br />
and the coarse grains, meat, butter and cheese where the<br />
tariff is of relatively minor importance. The real barriers here<br />
are devices such as quotas and variable levies.<br />
These were the objecl'-ives and opportunities presented<br />
by the Kennedy Round. How does the outcome measure up? </p>

<p>But there can be no doubt that the substantial increase in the<br />
minimum price should move average market prices much nearer to<br />
remunerative levels than in the past.<br />
One aspect of the new agreement which makes it<br />
better than the old agreement is that minimum prices have now been<br />
prescribed for a wide range of different wheats.<br />
. This will ensure that floor prices are much more<br />
effective than in the previous agreements, where the minimum price<br />
applied only to the highest quality wheat traded leaving great<br />
scope for fluctuations of the discount differential for all<br />
other wheats. In the judgment of some experts at Geneva, and<br />
they were there from the exporting countries and the importing<br />
countries, the increase in the average commerfial price of wheat<br />
expected to result from the higher floor price should be, these<br />
experts say, as muzch as 8 to 16 US cents per bushel.<br />
If this is the case, the gain to Australia in<br />
foreign exchange from an export of, say, 300 million bushels, a<br />
year, and thats about the average of the last three years, would<br />
be from $ US 24 million a year to $ US 48 million a year.<br />
In addition we have obtained for the first time,<br />
the commitment of affluent importing countries such as the United<br />
Kingdom, Japan and the European Economic Community to accept<br />
joint responsibilitity for providing food aid to the developing<br />
countries. Australia has in practice extended its food aid in<br />
the form of wheat. She now accepts with the other countires a<br />
contractual commitment to provide wheat as food aid to the<br />
extent of 225,000 tons a year in a total programme of 4-J metric<br />
tons a year. </p>
<p>In these various respects our export trade will be<br />
more profitable,. our access to markets more secure. Affluent<br />
countries will share with us the cost of wheat aid to the needy,<br />
and in general our competitive position in world markets has<br />
been preserved and improved.<br />
OTHER PRODUCTS The whole thing is not ruled off yet but the<br />
United States, for domestic reasons, is under compulsion to conclude<br />
its negotiations to a very strict timetable. Other countries<br />
are not under exactly the same pressure. For this reason our<br />
negotiations with certain important other countries are not yet<br />
quite finalised. In the case of some of these countries we are<br />
confident that satisfactory arrangements covering a variety of<br />
products will be successfully concluded but these cannot be<br />
described at this stage as finalised.<br />
On 1 -Pfm r-' nd veal we expect to finalise arrangements<br />
which will improve our access to important markets such as the<br />
Euro pean Economic Community and Japan.<br />
Our industry will benefit not only from greater and<br />
more predictable access to these markets but the new airangements<br />
will reduce th4 possibility of having to divert meat -to some<br />
other markets such as the United Kingdom and the U. S. A.<br />
Important negotiations are still going on with the<br />
European Economic Commnity, On beef and veal the E. E. C. has<br />
declared its willingness to reduce -the Community tarifi' from<br />
to 16%; but more importantly than that, over 5 months of the<br />
year, to permit imports free of the import levy which might otherwise<br />
have been imposed during that period, and which can make pale<br />
into insignificance the cut in duties. </p>
<p>This concession should really open up the Common<br />
Market for Australian frozen beef and veal in our peak selling<br />
season. Also there are a number of other products such as<br />
honey, beef offals and tallow where there will be reduced tariffs<br />
on Australian exports to the EEC, which is a most important market<br />
for these products. In the case of Japan discussions have taken place in<br />
the hope of securing improved access to that market. The results<br />
of these discussions have been quite encouraging. The present<br />
duty on sheep meats and beef offals will also be reduced.<br />
Out of this I see these negotiations as having opened<br />
up a much better, and quite worthwhile opportunity for expansion<br />
in the export of all our meat products to Japan.<br />
We also have from Japan an undertaking that some of<br />
our most important exports to Japan wool, coal, iron ore and<br />
hides and skins are to be assured duty free entry in the future.<br />
In a number of other markets important for<br />
particular products we also expect to make gains apples and<br />
pears into Swe( den and Denmark, reduced duties on wool and zinc<br />
ores into Norway and many others. The full extent of such<br />
concessions cannot yet be catalogued.<br />
We launched a campaign in 1961 to develop an export<br />
consciousness amongst manufacturers.<br />
Since then there has been an annual increase in the<br />
export of manufactured goods of about 20% per annum. The current<br />
rate of export of manufactured goods is more than double what it<br />
was 5 years ago. Our manufactured exports will consequent upon the<br />
Kennedy Round, benefit from the tariff cuts agreed amongst the<br />
large industrialised countries. The concept is that concessions<br />
given to one are given to all. </p>
<p>On the other hand, and as a result of the negotiations,<br />
some of our preferences in markets such as the United Kingdom and<br />
Canada will be affected.<br />
GAINS AND LOSSES There have been gains and losses for Australia as a<br />
result of the Kennedy Round,<br />
In the case of the United Kingdom we face the<br />
prospect of a cut of in our present preferences on raisins,<br />
sultanas and currants, canned peaches, canned apricots ( but not<br />
canned pears) canned pineapples, unmilled rice and leather, and<br />
perhaps some other less important items.<br />
This is the outcome of the United Kingdom from the<br />
outset offering a 50% cut in all her tariffs. It didn't eventuate<br />
but their position never altered in respect of the items I just<br />
mentioned. The original objectives of the Kennedy Round have not<br />
been fully achieved. There was no success in the attempt to write<br />
a world agreement on dairy products. However, the significant<br />
importers of the major dairy product, butter, are so few in<br />
num~ ber that the door is not closed against bilateral discussions on<br />
this item. Sugar is one of cur great export items, but<br />
-practically every sugar exporting country is a developing country.<br />
These countries have decided to negotiate a Sugar Agreement within<br />
the organisation of not within the organisation of<br />
G. A. T. T. So it was never a matter up for negotiation in the<br />
Kennedy Round. However, there will be a world sugar conference, under<br />
the auspices of U. N. C. T. A. D. later this year.<br />
At this stage we have not secured anything on wool<br />
in the United States market. </p>
<p>Overall, there is no doubt the net results of the<br />
Kennedy Round will have been generally beneficial to Australia and<br />
to the world at large.<br />
When our gains have been evaluated we will be making<br />
payments from selected items in our tariff. Let me describe this,<br />
such payment on our part will have been made without in any way<br />
undermining necessary protection of our domestic industries.<br />
Over quite a major part of Australian imports, the<br />
tariff to date has been free for British Preferential imports with a<br />
nominal non-protective Most Favoured Nation duty on imports from<br />
other sources. These m. f. n. duties wilibe eliminated over quite a<br />
wide range of products, as our preferences in Britain have been<br />
halved over a number of products. In addition some protective<br />
tariffs have been reduced, will be reduced, where the Tariff Board,<br />
being asked has found that a reduction in t~ e m. f. n. rate of duty<br />
was justified. For some other items, there will be a reduction in the<br />
margin between the British Prefcorontial Tariff and the m. f. n. tariff,<br />
again without impairing the protection for Australian industry.<br />
These are the types of concessions which Australia<br />
is making, and with which we will pay for the advantages we have<br />
gained. Of course, until the negotiations are complete the<br />
individual concessions on offer cannot be revealed.<br />
So much for the Kennedy Round. </p>
<p>Time, I think, does not permit me to go, in detail, into<br />
a discussion of what may occur as a result of Britain's application<br />
to join the Common Market, but you have a question time. But let<br />
me say this, in respect of Britain's application to join the<br />
Common Market. Before she made the earlier application she went into<br />
close consaltation with the Common Market countries, describing the<br />
circumstances of her trading contractual commitments to countries<br />
like Australia. Jointly they looked at what would be the effect of Britain<br />
joining under the Treaty of Rome and what, if anything, could be done<br />
to ameliorate the impact upon countries like Australia.<br />
Out of that examination in 1962 Britain and the European<br />
Co~ mmunity issued a statement that, if Britain should join, then for<br />
the major items of world commodity trade world agreements would have<br />
to be relied upon to safeguard the interests of those who had<br />
hitherto depended on the historic terms of access to the British<br />
market world commodity agreements.<br />
The fact that in Geneva it was not possible to achieve<br />
world commodity agreements on other than wheat leaves me with' little<br />
confidence that we could rely upon the early conclusion of worthwhile<br />
world commodity agreements as an alternative to our present<br />
marketing arrangements in Britain.<br />
All thinking Australians will follow developments in<br />
Europe closely over the next few months. It's still too early<br />
to say whether the British application will succeed. But we have<br />
been served notice as a nation not to rest on our laurels nor to<br />
rely too heavily on existing marketing arrangements With Britain.<br />
These recent events must act as a spur to Australia<br />
to-seek out new markets as a hedge against the future. The </p>
<p>Commonwealth Government will do all in its power, and the Trade<br />
Department as its instrument, to assist, but ultimately success<br />
will depend on the initiative of individual industries and<br />
individual traders.<br />
What I've been seeking to say is that, with our dreams<br />
of expansion that we have and the actuality of our fast growth,<br />
there is one essential ingredient to growth, and that is command<br />
of adequate resources of foreign exchange. And that, given the<br />
most favourable circumstances of raising exchange other than by<br />
selling goods at export, you still depend to the extent of<br />
for your requirements on the sale of exports, the sale of export<br />
goods. We must be efficient at home, we must be active at<br />
home; but above all, we must have the right to sell. The days<br />
were when one produced. something one could take it out and sell<br />
it at best. To-day the world is full of countries who say, no,<br />
we won't receive that item at all, we won't receive this item<br />
without something like 100% tariff, we won't receive that item<br />
except to the extent that we can't produce it at any old cost<br />
ourselves. What we've been trying to do is to negotiate a way<br />
through the totality of these obstructions to our opportunity<br />
to earn the wherewithal to pay for the growth that we all insist<br />
on having. We've had a bruise or two in this in the items that<br />
I have mentioned, but over-all there are distinct, identifiable<br />
gains for Australia and a new level of predictability in our<br />
trading opportunities for the future.<br />
-oOo-</p>
<p>QUESTIONS: Mr. Wood: Mr. Minister, I wonder if you can give us some<br />
specific idea of the size and composition of the parcel of industrial<br />
tariff cuts we' re offering Japan. And could you also comment<br />
further on the proposed review of the U. K./ Australia trade treaty<br />
which you mentioned on Friday?<br />
Mr. McEwen: Well, in the nature of things, first of all let me say<br />
whatever is offered to one country, if accepted, becomes agailable to<br />
all. This is the essence of the thing. But to indicate that we've<br />
offered to reduce a duty on an item would be completely dislocating<br />
to normal trading. Th'is is one of the trade secrets. It's never<br />
done.<br />
Mr. Samuel: Mr. McEwen, you referred to the silliness of other<br />
countries producing things at any old cost with tariffs of 100%.<br />
I wonder if you've had time to look at the speech of Mr. Rattigan,<br />
the Chairman of the Tariff Board. He referred rather critically in<br />
many ways to the traditional appraach of both the Government and the<br />
Board itself to tariff matters. One of the things he suggested was<br />
that industries which were very high cost and required very high<br />
tariff protection should be encouraged to phase out their production<br />
over a period of time. I wonder if you've any comments on that?<br />
Mr. McEwen; Well, now, you expect accuracy from me and I expect<br />
it from you. I referred to the " silliness" of other countries<br />
doing this? I did no such thing. I referred to the fact of it,<br />
and it is a fact. I haven't read Mir. Rattigan's speech, but Mr.<br />
Rattigan is the Chairman of the Tariff Board, a man whom I have<br />
immense respect for. He was the Deputy Secretary of the Department<br />
of Trade and we're personal friends. He expresses his views. If<br />
he were expressing a proposal to the Government I'm sure he would<br />
address himself to me. He's not done so. When Mr. Rattigan<br />
addresses himself to me, when the Tariff Board addresses itself to<br />
me, then I'll take this up and study it quite carefully. But </p>
<p>the position is that we make no tariff alterations in this country<br />
except on the advice of the Tariff Board, and the occasions when we<br />
don't act completely in accordance with the advice of th.; Tariff<br />
Board are very few indeed. And when we do depart from thie advice of<br />
the Taiiff Board we explain why we departed from the advi. ce. I don't<br />
know wy other country on earth which doesn't alter its , ariffs<br />
exnept by having a public inquiry in which all interested parties<br />
in its own country are free to go and give evidence in favour or<br />
agairst, and in which every foreigner in the world who thinks he's<br />
interested is equally free to go along and give his evidence.<br />
Australian tariff-making is as clean and as open as anywhere on<br />
earth. And the Government acts on the advice of this body,<br />
or acts with the advioe, and<br />
mostly upon the advice of this Body. If the Tariff Board, or Mr.<br />
Rattigan as its Chairman, felt that there was aneed for us to<br />
depart in our policy-making, I'm sure they would suggest it to ma.<br />
If they thought there was a need for a review of some existing tariffs,<br />
I'm sure they would suggest it to me. This has not been done.<br />
If, on the other hand, there are interested parties in Australia<br />
who feel that some tariff is too high and that it ought to be<br />
reviewed, they are equally free to make a request to me to have a<br />
Tariff Board hearing not for the purpose which is normal, to<br />
consider whether the tariff ought to be increased, but for the<br />
purpose important to them in the contingency I speak of, of<br />
examining whether the tariff should be reduced. There's nothing<br />
that isn't wide out in the open of what is done in tariff-making.<br />
Therc's nothing in our tariff-making that doesn't preserve entire<br />
opportunity for the Tariff Board and all the interested parties to<br />
make proposals to the Government and when a hearing is on for all<br />
foreigners to go to the Tariff Board and make their proposals,<br />
Mr. Catmull: Sir, what do you feel Britain's chances are of<br />
succeeding in its application to join the Common Market? </p>
<p>11.<br />
Mr. MoEwen: Quite frankly, I'm completely incompetent to answer<br />
that question. I don't know.<br />
Mr. Wood: Sir, as a follow-up to the question just before that<br />
one, you say the Board has to get its reference from you,<br />
could you give us some idea of when you'll be meeting the Tariff<br />
Board, and are you still considering the idea of part-time Board<br />
members?<br />
Mr. McEwen: Just before I was going overseas Mr. Rattigan got in<br />
touch with me and suggested to me that, in the opinion of himself<br />
and the Board, it would be useful if we had a meeting I think<br />
he used the word " informal", and I think, over a luncheon. I<br />
instantly agreed to that. This will be when it comes off, my third<br />
meeting with the Tariff Board in eleven years, so I don't stand<br />
over them very much.<br />
As to the question of part-time Board members, I made<br />
a statement in Parliament explaining what prompted me to canvass<br />
this thought and to consult, as I've always done is my ministerial<br />
career, people who had an interested view on this kind of thing.<br />
There was not much support for it, and that might be overstating it.<br />
But whether as a result or not, I don't know, but I had at about<br />
that time a letter from Mr. Rattigan explaining to me in convincing<br />
terms that there were now circumstances in which the Board would be<br />
in the future able to deal more expeditiously, have a greater<br />
throughput of work, than had been the history over the recent<br />
several years. And I accept this as a correct judgment. I think<br />
that probably disposes of the matter.<br />
Mr. Connors: Mr. Minister, Russia, who is a major member of the<br />
International Wheat Agreement, was not present at the G. A. T. T. for<br />
any of the current negotiations. Russia has been a major importer<br />
in the past, and I believe, according to a B. A. E. report, that<br />
she may be an exporter around 1970 or something like that. I was<br />
wondering has Russia given any indication that she is agreeable to<br />
what was negotiated at Geneva? </p>
<p>12<br />
Mr. MoEwen: No, I'm not aware of Russia indicating this at all.<br />
What was agreed at Geneva is not fulfilled yet. There needs to be<br />
legislation or the approval of~ Governments in all the countries: who<br />
are concerned. I've no doubt this will occur. When this is done,<br />
then I would imagine it may be fruitful at that point of time to<br />
sound the Russian reaction, but Russia has never been a disruptive<br />
influence in recent years as an exporter of wheat and the Agreement<br />
itself commits all the traditional exporters of wheat to not sell<br />
below the prescribed minimum, and I don-It think that Russia will be<br />
a dislocating factor in the scheme.<br />
Mr. WNood: Another one, Mr. McEwen. Do you have any specific<br />
evidence, historic or otherwise, to support your contention that a<br />
rise in the minimum price for wheat will lead to a rise in the<br />
world price?<br />
Mr. McEwen: Only what I mentioned. That is, that over the wh~ le<br />
history of minimum price, sales have been more often than not above<br />
the prescribed minimum price. P7irst point. The second point T<br />
said and this is not my own judgment but the judgment of the<br />
people who are engaged in their life in wheat transactions who were<br />
there as advisers to the delegations, to every important delegation<br />
at Geneva, the Americans, the Canadians, the Australians, Argentina,<br />
the delegations of all the major importing countries in each<br />
case it was accepted that the new and higher minimum price would<br />
lead to a higher general commercial level. There were various<br />
views. I know of no view expressed that the commercial level could<br />
be expected to be less than 7ff cents above the prescribed minimum.<br />
I tended to round that off in my speech to 8 cents. Others ventured<br />
an opinion, 16 cents and one who spoke with considerable authority<br />
said he though it would be 20 cents above. This is nct my view.<br />
I can only Taote to you, and that's all I sought to do in my<br />
speech, the expressed views of experts. </p>
<p>Mr. Baudino: Mr. McEwen, if I could just changre the topic. In the<br />
past you have been a critic of the principle of " one vote, one<br />
value" in Australia. Redistribution has reared again at the<br />
moment. Do you still subscribe to this?<br />
Mr. McEvqen; Well, first of all I have never been a critic of the<br />
principle of " one vote, one value". I have been a defender of the law<br />
which has stood since 1900, 19012 which this is on the subject<br />
you're mentioning, I'm sure stipulates that in electorates I<br />
can't bring to my mind the description, but you'll know what I'm<br />
talking about and its's there in the Law electorates where there<br />
are vast areas, sparse population, population of different interests,<br />
that the Electoral Commissioner shall have the right in proposing<br />
boundaries to propose boundaries which would result in a differential<br />
in numbers 20% above the mean or 20% below the mean. If this has<br />
been a good law in this country for 60-odd years I've defended it.<br />
I still think it's a gooa law. Was there another part of your<br />
question that escaped me? No.<br />
Mr. Hutchinson: I might intervene one on the same question, Sir.<br />
Do you think that the difficulties of redistribution posed by the<br />
fact that, as a result of the referendum, the Constitution will not<br />
be amended and therefore the Parliament cannot be enlarged, do you<br />
think those difficulties are surmountable?<br />
Mr. Mcawen: I don't think there have ever been any difficulties<br />
about redistribution. There was a challenge by me and my Party to<br />
a particular proposal, which, let me remind you in one aspoct,<br />
would have taken the State of Western Australia where for many<br />
years the Country Party has provided about half the Government<br />
and the Deputy Premier, and is very strong; a redistribution proposal<br />
that would have drawn lines impossible for my Party to win one<br />
seat in Western Australia, and by general agreement impossible for<br />
the Labor Party to win more than one seat in Western Australia.<br />
And the State of Western Australia, which is a third area of<br />
Australia, to have its nine Members reduced to eight. This'll do<br />
me for an illustration of what I objected to in that proposal, </p>
<p>14.<br />
which was thrown out. But from the day that it was thrown out<br />
I have believed that there was no reason why the Government<br />
shouldn't have gone ahead next day and reappointed Electoral<br />
Coinmissiooiers to make a new proposal. How long ago's that? I<br />
don't remember, but it's a good few years. : 62? 1 think in ' 62<br />
we could have had a redistribution, and in ' 67, before the<br />
referendum or after the referendum, we can have a redistribution,<br />
and we ought to.<br />
Mr. Hurst: Mr. McEwen, in your absence abroad your Government<br />
has had its troubles in the Senate. Could you give us your<br />
personal view on this? Do you think there's any, there is a case<br />
for changing the Senate, or do you feel that it should be abolished?<br />
Mr. McEwenj: Oh, look here now, be your age. No comment.<br />
Mr. Long: Sir, when you were oerseas did you have qn opportunity<br />
to discuss with anyone the idea of the proposed Industry Development<br />
Corporation, and, if so, what was their reaction to this?<br />
Mr. MoEwen: Nlo, I'm afraid the simple answer is that I did not have<br />
an opportunity, or didn't seek an opportunity, to discuss this.<br />
I had a pretty big job on my hand and I concentrated on that. </p>
