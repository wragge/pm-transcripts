MEDIA RELEASE GOVERNOR-GENERAL<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, Minister for National<br />
Resources and Minister for Overseas Trade, the Rt Hon. J. D. Anthony<br />
The Acting Prime Minister said today that press<br />
reports about the Governor-General's overseas visit<br />
misinterpreted the position and were quite unfair to the<br />
Governor-General. It was a regular practice for Governors-General<br />
to take mid-term leave overseas and for such visits to be at<br />
official expense. The Government had approved Sir John's<br />
visit in accordance with this practice.<br />
There was, in this instance, the additional decision<br />
by the Government that Sir John should accept the invitation<br />
to be present at the Jubilee Celebrations in London.<br />
In respect of functions at which the Prime Minister<br />
is the guest of honour, either in Australia or overseas,<br />
it would not be normal practice for the Governor-General to<br />
attend. No issue of precedence arises.<br />
The cable referred to in some newspapers about<br />
invitations to the Governor-General was simply a reply to<br />
questions that had been asked by an overseas post and the<br />
reply given was in accordance with normal practice.<br />
Canberra, June, 1977. </p>
