PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINSTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS, RADIO 2UE, THURSDAY 28 JULY 1994<br />
E&amp; EO PROOF COPY<br />
JL: Good morning, Prime Minister<br />
PM: How are you John?<br />
JL: You were firing away there last night. We only played 1 minute,<br />
seconds of it, but I think it went about 45 minutes, or something didn't<br />
it?<br />
PM: Oh yes, we had a few funny bits in there.<br />
JL: Obviously, you were in a good frame of mind.<br />
PM: Well, I think that you know, we've got to get away part of the message<br />
I was giving was we've got to get away from these sort of shadow<br />
debates and back to real things. I mean, the job of people in public life<br />
is to deliver outcomes, and what I was saying yesterday was that in<br />
seeing the confirmation of decelerating trend inflation in the face of<br />
economic growth, which is the fastest in the western world, Australia<br />
has not only achieved growth again of a very high order, but it's broken<br />
the back of a 20 year scourge of inflation, and yesterday morning the<br />
debate was about whether Mr Downer would sort of pull off his Citizen<br />
Initiated Referendums.<br />
JL: Yeah, well you see, this is the part that confuses the people. When we<br />
have good news, such as the news we had yesterday, and not even<br />
Terry McCrann could say it was bad news why don't we get a run on<br />
that? Why don't we enthuse about the success of our very own<br />
country instead of doom-boosting all the time?<br />
PM: Well, I mean, listen we sort of, it's as if, you know, there's a sort of<br />
moratorium on any kind of rejoicing about the fact that the Australian </p>
<p>people together have busted inflation and secured their future. I<br />
mean, let me just make this point John, under the Liberals, inflation<br />
never got oh it got once below 10% at We've got inflation<br />
now in trend terms at about slightly under That's an 8<br />
percentage point differential on whatever interest rate structure the<br />
country will have. That means that all Australians have got that 8<br />
percentage points of advantage in inflation and in interest rates than<br />
they would have had had the sort of policies of not pulling together, not<br />
having accord with the trade unions, not trying to systemically bust<br />
inflation. And that makes all the world of difference, and that's the<br />
point I'm trying to get across to Mr Downer this is not about what I call<br />
political ping-pong: one smart answer to meet another sort of slick<br />
reply, and another one batted back, another quick answer it's not<br />
about answers and slick replies, it's about substantial outcomes.<br />
JL: Yeah. The comments now being thrown over, about the Citizen<br />
Initiated Referenda your thoughts on that, I imagine, would be with<br />
most of Australia that if you elect a government surely it's there to<br />
govern, and doesn't have to ask the people how to do it once it's<br />
there?<br />
PM: Well, it's like when they have these Referenda, Citizens Initiated<br />
referenda in California..<br />
JL: I was talking about those, dreadful.<br />
PM: Yeah. Cutting the, so called cutting the tax rate and what have you.<br />
Then they found there was a paucity of police people on the beat,<br />
there was a decline in public services and, of course, there's got to be<br />
some government. See in this country, John, we have elections every<br />
three years. In fact, we generally have them slightly less than three<br />
years. So, the public get a chance to adjudicate on the government<br />
within a very short space of time. So, you know, there's not much I<br />
agree with Mr Fischer about, but I agreed with his comments<br />
yesterday, that Citizens Initiated Referenda is law-making cancer, and,<br />
but again it just shows that Alexander Downer's leadership is not<br />
leadership at all. I mean, he lets Reith run this thing out, he tells<br />
everybody in the press yes, he's supporting it. The moment it gets into<br />
trouble, he falls away from it, the same as he did on the monarchy and<br />
the republic. We didn't get low inflation falling away from fights. We<br />
got low inflation and high growth through determined policy efforts<br />
standing the heat when the heat is on.<br />
JL: Yep. Just back to inflation during the Liberal years. During that entire<br />
7-year period it only came under 10% on one occasion?<br />
PM: From my recollection, it got to 9.8% in the early<br />
JL: And when Labor took government, unemployment was about 10% too,<br />
wasn't it? </p>
<p>PM: It was, unemployment was, inflation and unemployment were the better<br />
part of 10.5 or 11<br />
JL: Yeah. Well, why is it that we don't in our own country enthuse<br />
about our ability to succeed? I was interested to hear you say then<br />
that the people of Australia had collectively been able to do what's<br />
been done, and they have done it. Why don't they rejoice in the fact<br />
that they have?<br />
PM: Well, they're entitled to the recovatry, which has come, and to the wage<br />
restraint which has put the low inflation and the higher profits into<br />
place which engendered that re-overy. Now, the government can<br />
direct the policies and it has but it's had the co-operation of the<br />
whole organised workforce through the Accord, it's had the<br />
cooperation of the workforce in wage restrain-ts, agnd it's now, we're<br />
now, producing the highest rate of growth in the whole of the OECD<br />
western world area, and we're doing it when inflation is actually<br />
slowing down, not going up. Normally when growth goes up, inflation<br />
goes up. We've got growth going up and inflation coming down, so my<br />
point is, let's give the nation a tick when we get it right, and also, see<br />
John, can I just make this point you just made a very interesting point<br />
about unemployment. In the early 80s we had unemployment at<br />
around 10%, and we've got unemployment today at around 10% too.<br />
The difference is though, we kept the nearly 2 million jobs created in<br />
between times. In the early 80' s we had a workforce of 6 million, today<br />
we've got a workforce of nearly 8 million. So, there's always this<br />
confusion in the public minds between rates, like the unemployment<br />
rate, and levels the level of employment. The level of employment in<br />
the early 80s was 6 million, the level of employment now is<br />
approaching 8 million. So, we got 10%, nearly 10%, unemployment of<br />
8 million is a damn lot better than nearly 10%, over<br />
unemployment of 6 million.<br />
JL: Yeah, and particularly when you couple that with the inflation rate?<br />
PM: When you couple, see, we've had from 1983 until now we've had, I<br />
think, about 26-27% employment growth. That's about twice as much<br />
as most western world countries.* And we've got it now with fast growth<br />
again. Looking at the 90s, you've got already a strong take off for<br />
growth. We are yet to see the real strength of the investment phase<br />
come through so we've got more to come we've got inflation under<br />
control, and we've got linkages into Asia and product growth and<br />
export growth we've never had in any other decade. So the position of<br />
the Australian economy, and the outlook for Australia in the 90s is<br />
better than it's been, I think, certainly in any decade since the war<br />
and I think before that.<br />
JL: Do you concede that there is still plenty of people in our society who<br />
are not yet feeling the benefits of the recovery? </p>
<p>PM: Oh, absolutely. And I think that's why we've got to nurture it and bring<br />
it along. And it means keeping an eye on all the elements of our<br />
competitiveness. But that's one of the reasons why the Government's<br />
been about extending enterprise bargaining through the workforce so<br />
we're getting now productivity related wage increases which is<br />
protecting the inflation rate. See, in the old days we had what was<br />
called " wage push inflation". Someone would claim a wage increase,<br />
it'd go straight into prices and straight into inflation.<br />
JL: Absolutely..<br />
PM: What's happening now is, the wage increases are covered by<br />
productivity. That's why the inflation rate yesterday is moving down,<br />
not up.<br />
JL: Yeah, but you'd have Alexander Downer saying to that, and I suppose<br />
other critics saying to that, well, if you've kept wages down for all this<br />
time, is that really something to be proud of? In a country like<br />
Australia, shouldn't the standard of living be increasing all the time, not<br />
remaining static?<br />
PM: Household income has risen in every year the Government has been<br />
in office simply because there's been more people in households, in<br />
work. So, we've spread the wage restraint to 26% employment growth,<br />
and it's that stronger employment growth which has lifted family<br />
incomes. But, as well as that, we've had in the last few years, strong<br />
increases in real incomes because the inflation rate see for any,<br />
look shall we say, nominal level of wages.. if you've got lower inflation,<br />
your real wage is higher...<br />
JL: That's right, because the dollar is more valuable.<br />
PM: Yes, because the dollar is more valuable. So people have actually<br />
had a, with the real wage increases with low inflation and the tax cuts,<br />
they've had a big kick along and lower interest rates for housing real<br />
disposable income of Australians has risen quite strongly in the last<br />
couple of years because of the lower devotion of family income to<br />
interest for housing, because of the tax cuts, and the low. inflation<br />
making real wages higher. So, in other words, the aim of the game is<br />
to give to people a higher standard of living, and that's what we've<br />
been doing as well as creating 3.5% employment growth over the last<br />
year. The only country in the world which shares our employment<br />
growth rate at the moment or is near us is Canada. We're way<br />
ahead of the pack...<br />
JL: What do you...<br />
PM: of OECD countries. </p>
<p>JL: What do you say the people who will ring this radio program after I've<br />
finished talking to you and say well, it's allright for him, it's still lousy for<br />
us. I'm still unemployed, things are crook and there are people who<br />
are now entrenched in that sort of thinking. What do you say to the<br />
people who haven't yet felt the good of the recovery?<br />
PM: Well that's where the White Paper comes in, John. That's where we've<br />
got this revolution where we'll spend in the next 4 years, $ 1.4b on<br />
labour market programs, and in next year, they will reach 650,000 of<br />
the unemployed. That's the great bulk of the unemployed. 650,000<br />
will be picked up and half of them will be individually case-managed.<br />
And that was the great breakthrough of the White Paper of Working<br />
Nation which I announced a couple of months ago saying we would not<br />
leave the unemployed behind. But you see, for the Liberals, John, this<br />
is all just so much, they think, " well, that's the Labor Party, they're out<br />
there with their sort of so-called compassionate policies worrying about<br />
the unemployed". They're basically saying " the recovery is on, let's<br />
hope the joy goes to the top-end". They don't care about an<br />
underclass, that's why the Government said Australia will not go the<br />
way of the US or Britain we will have a White Paper, we won't let the<br />
unemployed slip between the cracks. But, you see, the point Mr<br />
Downer has got to get through his head is this smart, radio cracks,<br />
repartee at the door-stop, is no substitute for policy. He doesn't have<br />
policies. He doesn't stand for anything. And that's the problem.<br />
There's no Liberal leader since 1983 who has stood for anything. And<br />
we don't have one now.<br />
JL: I talked yesterday to Bob Collins about the drought, and it was good to<br />
talk to him, too. He seemed to be...<br />
PM: Well, I mean he understands. He's an agricultural scientist, he's been<br />
around all his life agriculture.<br />
JL: He also went broke in the drought, didn't he?<br />
PM: Yeah. And he worked for the CSIRO in agricultural science in the<br />
Northern Territory.<br />
JL: He concedes that more needs to be done, he concedes that the<br />
drought as it stands now is a disaster. Are you prepared to allow him<br />
to introduce the legislation which is there under the Natural Disasters<br />
legislation for the drought-stricken farmers, particularly in<br />
Queensland?<br />
PM: Well, he's bringing a submission to Cabinet which I've encouraged him<br />
to do, and Wayne Goss and I had a conversation about this during the<br />
week..<br />
JL: Yeah... </p>
<p>PM: See, what we've got is a very.... we've got this unusual circumstance<br />
John. We used to have a thing called the.. N. A ( the Natural Disaster<br />
Relief Aqgency You would have normal seasons'and ' tFen for a year<br />
or so6,!-you would have an extraordinary condition like a drought or<br />
something else...<br />
JL Yeah, but they usually accommodated that themselves, the farmers,<br />
didn't they?<br />
PM: Well, the NDRA helped it put money into particular localities. The<br />
problem with this drought is that it's been on and off for around now,<br />
about 8 years. It's a medium-term problem. It's not just an annual, or<br />
an 18 month or 2 season, problem. Now certainly it's way out of the<br />
ordinary with the climatic conditions of the century, over the century,<br />
because we've now seen not just marginal farmland, but really good<br />
farmland in trouble. So, what it needs is a medium-term solution, and<br />
that's why we think that the structural adjustment type policies under<br />
the Rural Adjustment Scheme, a modification of those, recognising the<br />
severity of this and the medium-term nature of it, is the way to respond.<br />
And that's what I think Bob Collins will do.<br />
JL And will you permit that to happen?<br />
PM: Oh, I think, I said in Queensland last week that's what I think should<br />
happen. I mean, I just think it's a, you know, it's very poor for people in<br />
these communities to have someone in public life, like myself, or<br />
somebody say " oh well, look, you've got a problem we'll slip some<br />
one year money into the NDRA arrangement".<br />
JL Oh yes, I agree with that, but you....<br />
PM: Do you understand? Where in fact the problem is a medium-term<br />
problem and requires a much more systemic kind of approach.<br />
JL yeah. You seem to get them off-side a bit with some comment, I don't<br />
know exactly what it was....<br />
PM: Well look, some of the grain-growing council people..<br />
JL Yep.<br />
PM: . they want you to say this is the biggest disaster ever, and we'll throw<br />
inordinate amounts of money at it in an unstructured way. Now, no<br />
government could do that, or should do that. When you say to them,<br />
" look, I understand the nature of this problem it's a medium-term<br />
problem, and it needs a systemic approach" they try and then argue,<br />
it becomes a word game about what they think the medium-term is,<br />
and what they think is an intermittent disaster..<br />
JL Yeah... </p>
<p>PM: . so instead of these people running grain councils, actually getting off<br />
their tail and having a real valuable conversation with the Government,<br />
they want to have little pot-shots on radio programs. I mean, they're<br />
just not representing their own people well.<br />
JL So, you believe that they do need help, and you will encourage the<br />
Government to give them help?<br />
PM: Well, I told...<br />
JL ' Cause you only lend them the money, don't you?<br />
PM: I told the public that yes, it's all about whether it's serviced, what the<br />
rate of interest is. A lot of it's at nil rate. Some of it's at nil rate.<br />
JL Well, so it should be.<br />
PM: And therefore it's got no servicing cost. So what we've, what I've said<br />
to the public of Queensland last week is that I think this is a serious<br />
situation, I said the same to Wayne Goss. And Bob Collins had<br />
already said that before I had, so Bob and I have agreed that he<br />
should bring the matter to Cabinet.<br />
JL Okay, just one final thing. What's happening with the Cahill<br />
Expressway, and have you heard from the Premier of NSW?<br />
PM: Well, I notice there's a press report today that he's written to me. I<br />
haven't seen the letter yet, but I will, no doubt. And I'm happy to sit<br />
down with NSW and talk about it. But, you see, we've got to talk about<br />
the expressway and not a wish list. See, in the so-called $ 400m of<br />
cosfsbf the expressway. I mean, look John, you don't have to be civil<br />
engineer to know, it doesn't cost $ 400m to cut down a steel structure.<br />
JL Well I wouldn't know that.<br />
PM: Well, of course it doesn't, you know. I mean, the demolition job is a<br />
very low-cost thing it's a matter of where you put the railway and a<br />
couple of other things...<br />
JL Yeah, because they would have to implement replacement measures<br />
to get that traffic across the city of Sydney?<br />
PM: But the thing is the traffic is largely ta ken up by the tunnel, by the<br />
tunnel. What comes across the expressway is the lower north side<br />
traffic from Kirribilli and places like that. And what John Fahey has<br />
said in the $ 400m, is they want to put a tunnel from the Town Hall to<br />
the Museum in Druitt Street, under Park Street, coming out at William<br />
Street. Well, OK, that's a project that the city should consider, but it's<br />
not part of the expressway cost. </p>
<p>JL Well, I suppose they would say it was because they can no longer get<br />
traffic from the west to the east of the city.<br />
PM: Yeah, but of that traffic, only about 5% of the traffic that would use that<br />
tunnel comes from the expressway. In other words, look, what they're<br />
trying to say to me is, " look, seeing you are in a conversation with us,<br />
let's really load it up to see if we can screw from you a new<br />
expressway to take the east traffic to the west, which is a state<br />
responsibility, and we'll park it onto you the Commonwealth". All on<br />
the basis that 5% of the traffic that might use it formerly used the<br />
expressway. Now, if you take that tunnel out, the cost comes down<br />
from $ 400m to $ 1 50m, even with a gold-plated underground railway<br />
station! So, if you think of another solution for the railway, you're<br />
talking about under $ 1l00m here.<br />
JL Okay, but you're still at least prepared to discuss it with them?<br />
PM: Oh, I am, I am. But the thing about John Fahey, he's got to realise<br />
there's a difference between a pro for-ma coffersation and a real<br />
conversation. And a real conversation says, " look, allright, we've got a<br />
claim on you there about this expressway from the Town Hall to<br />
William Street, lets put that to one side for the moment, and discuss<br />
the expressway, see if we can come to an arrangement on that, and<br />
then we can discuss these other matters later".<br />
JL Yeah. Well, lets encourage that and hope that it comes to fruition.<br />
PM: It should happen, John, it's the most important precinct in the city of<br />
Sydney you've got the Olympic Games coming up, there's going to be<br />
after Atlanta enormous concentration on Sydney. When the Atlanta<br />
Games are finished, the concentration on Sydney is going to be<br />
immense, and we should use the opportunity to at least take this area<br />
which is, you know, we're now looking at the question of World<br />
Heritage listing for the Opera House..<br />
JL Yes.<br />
PM: and the Sydney Cove and treat it with the respect I think it deserves.<br />
JL Well, let's hope it's financially viable. Okay, Prime Minister, thank you<br />
for your time. It was good to talk to you.<br />
PM: Right John, thank you.<br />
ends. </p>
