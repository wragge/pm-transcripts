EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
( EXPECTED AROUND 9: 30 PM)<br />

PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 31 OCTOBER ' 1978<br />
ADDRESS TO THE SECOND INVITATION SYMPOSIUM OF THE. AATS 1978<br />
Mr. President, Fellows of the Academy of Technological<br />
Sciences, ladies and gentlemen. I am very pleased indeed to<br />
be here tonight and to be able to make a contribution to the<br />
Academy's second invitation symposium.<br />
The subject of this symposium our " Land and Water Resources"<br />
is of major importance to Australia. It warrants the impressive<br />
calibre of the speakers the Academy has brought together.<br />
There is increasing pressure on us to produce more food, more<br />
timber, and more energy from the land available to us<br />
similarly the most uneven distribution and quality of water resources<br />
in Australia present us with a constant challenge. The challenge<br />
has led to a great deal of effective research and innovation,<br />
but from time to time it is necessary to review what we have<br />
done so far, and seeking the best and most experienced advice,<br />
decide what now needs to be done.* I commend the Academy for<br />
undertaking this task.<br />
The impact of technology has attracted considerable public<br />
attention in the last few months. This must have caused some<br />
wry smiles amongst many of you here tonight, for this is<br />
hardly a new issue for you. It is important that we respond<br />
effectively and sensitively to the rapid spread of technological<br />
change in the factory, and in the office. Although adapting<br />
to technological change can be a difficult process, innovations<br />
in technology are the cornerstone of social and industrial<br />
development and have given rise to the living standards<br />
enjoyed by advanced industrial societies.' Technology, when<br />
progressively developed, increases the returns-from our people,<br />
from our natural resources, from all our assets. Technological<br />
advance in industry means improvements in productivity,<br />
downward pressure on the overall cost structure, a more<br />
competitive Australian economy. The adoption of new<br />
technology permits the continued improvement of our standard<br />
of living and creates opportunities for employment through the<br />
expansion of existing industries and the creation of new ones. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Australia has an enormous technological potential. We have<br />
vast resources. Our people are well-educated and creative,<br />
our science and scientists have reached high levels of<br />
sophistication and achieved significant recognition in the<br />
world community of science. No one can doubt the outstakiding<br />
contributions our scientists have made..'<br />
I should, however, say that this record is not always matched<br />
by the'application of the knowledge our scientists develop,<br />
or to which they have access. We have not advanced our<br />
technologies to the same extent as some of our developed<br />
trading partners, nor have we always responded as well as we<br />
might to the needs of the market place. The recent ASTEC<br />
report, " Science and Technology in Australia 1977-78" for<br />
instance, suggests that our record could be better in developing<br />
the results that come from research, and translating these<br />
into technological innovations in industry. if we are to<br />
apply knowledge in the pursuit of our industrial and other<br />
national objectives, we must continue to increase-and<br />
strengthen the national technological base. We should be<br />
concerned with the recognition given to technologists who are<br />
people of the utmost importance in Australia. Too often,<br />
technologists have been seen as following a lesser occupation,<br />
a lesser profession than that of research scientists. But<br />
the effort, the ability, the creative skills required in<br />
technological innovation are of the same order as those of<br />
the scientist.<br />
Technologists have a great part to play in Australia's<br />
development and the foundation of this Academy is an appropriate<br />
recognition of that fact. To emphasise technology and<br />
technologists however is not to de-emphasise science.<br />
Technology and science interact, and the more we can understand<br />
and manage this interaction, the more practical benefits the<br />
community will derive from Australian scientific andtechnological<br />
expertise. It is essential that our organisational<br />
arrangements reflect this basic need-and that the closest links<br />
and cooperation be forged between Government Departments,<br />
Government research institutions, industry and the academic<br />
world. When my Government came to office, we embarked on a major<br />
strategy to achieve this. We knew it was essential that<br />
Australian industry expand into new areas, based on Australian<br />
expertise and innovation, and using to the full the advantage<br />
which our vast natural resources give us. Our objective was<br />
to provide industry with better opportunities to seize on new<br />
knowledge, to turn it to use, in improving existing products<br />
and processes in generating new product lines, and in<br />
increasing our exports to t Lp the growing overseas markets<br />
particularly in our region.'. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Elements of our strategy have been the establishment of a<br />
permanent Australian Science and Technology Council; a<br />
comprehensive review of the establishment of the<br />
Department of Productivity; a review of Government policy-. on<br />
manufacturing industry; the creation of the Bureau of<br />
Industry Economics and the commissioning of a number of<br />
specialist studies, notably the Crawford and Williams Enquiries.<br />
together, these initiatives constitute a dyn . amic offensive<br />
designed to encourage Australian industry to use more<br />
effectively modern science and technology<br />
Let me now say a few words about a couple of developments<br />
which illustrate the success of this strategy. The<br />
invention of Interscan, which has been adopted as the<br />
new world standard for aircraft landing systems, has<br />
been widely recognised as a significant Australian<br />
achievement. Work has commenced on a new project designed<br />
to make sure that Australian industry obtains a commercial benefit<br />
from Interscan and a new company, " Interscan Australia" has been<br />
set up for this purpose.<br />
The Department Ofof Productivity is also currently developing<br />
proposals on a public interest project'which should be of<br />
particular interest to this Symposium. The essence of the<br />
proposals is that Australian companies be awarded contracts<br />
to develop and demonstrate water treatment systems based on<br />
technology resulting from research by CSIRO and Australian<br />
companies to convert brackish and turbid water into good quality<br />
drinking water.' If we can develop a unique capability in the<br />
design and construction of such treatment systems, we can<br />
greatly improve the quality of water in many parts of our nation<br />
and open up immense prospects for Australian exports to the dry<br />
regions of the Middle East and Africa.<br />
The Government has taken these various initiatives because it<br />
is convinced that the development and application of technology<br />
will contribute significantly to the prosperity and living<br />
conditions of all Australians.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, Australians have every reason for confidence<br />
in the future. With a more stable cost base, we are competitive<br />
again, and we are getting our manufactures back into world markets.<br />
I believe that the next decade will be years in which our<br />
industries will thrive and expand in a highly competitive and<br />
changing world. This is a time in which we can look forward<br />
as a nation because we can capture the future. ./ 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
By working together, we will make our industries Primary,<br />
Secondary and Tertiary as modern and efficient as possible,<br />
and make the most productive use of the skilled labour available<br />
to us. We must do more than merely articulate the advantages<br />
that technology brings. We must develop the most effective<br />
balance between the use of existing technology, its adaption to<br />
Australian conditions and the creation of new technology. We<br />
must all think positively about the ways we perform our various<br />
tasks and the techniques by which our efficiency of production<br />
and quality of service might be improved.<br />
In our response to change, your first President, Sir Ian McLennan,<br />
by his constant application to the ever-evolving challenges facing<br />
Australia, can serve as an outstanding example for us all. In<br />
reaching out to grasp the opportunities that are constantly<br />
becoming more apparent, the commitment and concerted efforts<br />
of all Australians is vital. We seek the co-operation and<br />
effort of all Governments Commonwealth and State with<br />
industry, scientists and technologists thoughout Australia.<br />
We will realise the promise the next decade holds out by forging<br />
a partnership between Government and the community. With such<br />
a partnership, there is nothing we cannot achieve as a nation.<br />
