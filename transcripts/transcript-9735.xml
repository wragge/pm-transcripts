TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT CORRIDOR OF OAKS TREE PLANTING, JACKSON PARK<br />
AUGUST 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
It is a great occasion for me it may be that one's Prime Ministership is<br />
confirmed when one plants a tree here. At any rate, we will have a tree. And<br />
I am glad that I have had the opportunity to plant it. It's always been<br />
that... . there are places in Australia which are quite important to the<br />
Federation, to the nation, and also the Labor Party. And Maggie ( Deahm)<br />
has mentioned the fact that Macquarie was an electorate which, of course,<br />
was the home of a former Labor Prime Minister in Ben Chifley, and as well as<br />
that, Tony Luchetti when I first went to Federal parliament, had been the<br />
Member for Macquarie for the better part of a quarter of a century. So there<br />
are very great Labor traditions here in the Blue Mountains, and interestingly,<br />
we have this connection with Henry Parkes. And it was the case, of course,<br />
in the 19th century, most people of his standing in public life had a house in<br />
the country. And his house in the country, of course, was at Faulconbridge.<br />
And happily, it has been preserved. And he was one of the principal people<br />
involved in the Federation of our nation. And the notion occurred to him as it<br />
did to many others, that there was no point in us being simply colonies, but<br />
rather that we should federate and become a nation. And this happened, of<br />
course, on the first of January, 1901. And he played a very proud role in it.<br />
And Faulconbridge has kept that connection with the birth of the Federation.<br />
And here we are now, just a hundred years later, trying to close the circle and<br />
see us establish an Australian republic with an Australian person as our<br />
Head of State. It shouldn't have taken one hundred years, but better late<br />
than never.<br />
Now, I think that in these years, when we think back upon it, that great period<br />
of Australian nationalism was in the 1890s it was one hundred years ago.<br />
Where we saw the big maritime strikes, one of the worst droughts, one of the<br />
worst depressions recessions but we saw the birth of Australian<br />
nationalism, we saw the birth of the Labor Party and that sense of the nation,<br />
of course, we saw the Federation in 1901, and that nationalism went through<br />
until it was snuffed out in 1914 by the First World War. And we are seeing in Q </p>
<p>a sense that regenerate in the 1 990s, where we have seen some of the same<br />
characteristics: the early 1990s, the recession, the drought, but again, I think<br />
a new sense by Australians in who we are and what we have become what<br />
we have made for ourselves as a nation, and now, how we have come to<br />
celebrate what we have created here in Australia. And we know that our<br />
aspirations as Australians that the sentiments we feel and the instincts we<br />
have will be completely represented when we represent ourself to the world,<br />
as ourselves. And that we can't go on one hundred years later borrowing the<br />
monarchy of another country and say here we are, making our way in Asia,<br />
with this great opportunity, this ancient continent bequeathed to us, where<br />
just two hundred years ago there were no people of European descent,<br />
where this continent in a sense was saved by the Aboriginal community and<br />
kept in trust for the rest of us. And having been kept in trust, and again<br />
having that opportunity to go now as part of the community in Asia and say<br />
" oh, just by the way, the Head of State of Australia is the Queen of Great<br />
Britain". Now, it has served us, and in some parts of our history it has served<br />
us well. But now, of course, we must make the break to do proud, to do<br />
justice to all of the instincts which Henry Parkes had, and all of those people<br />
interested in the Federation of the nation we now have to make that change,<br />
and make it to an Australian republic.<br />
And let me tell you this the moment it happens ( interrupted by train<br />
passing) lI was going to say this that as we make this change, we will feel<br />
good about ourselves. You know, once people understand that there is an<br />
Australian person who represents the nation, and who is the embodiment of<br />
the nation, it will make us feel stronger, and it will make us feel better about<br />
ourselves it will make it more clear to us who we are and what we are, and<br />
who we have become. So, today, I plant this tree not simply to do as other<br />
Prime Ministers have done, but to celebrate the spirit of nationalism of a<br />
century ago. To celebrate the fact that Henry Parkes his way up here from<br />
Sydney, weekends and from time to time, while having in his heart and mind<br />
the notion that we were better and deserved to be better than a collection<br />
of disparate colonies. That we were a people and that we were a nation then,<br />
as we certainly are today. That's why I am very pleased to be here.<br />
I do have this collection of Henry's letters, and they are quite an interesting<br />
lot of letters they are letters between Henry and his financier. He used to<br />
lend him money from time to time, and a few other personal things as well.<br />
So, all it proves is nothing changes nothing ever changes. So, can I say<br />
also how pleased I am to be in the Blue Mountains, and particularly with<br />
Maggie Deahm. I see her sitting next to Bob Debus part of a Labor<br />
Government. The thing I say about the Labor Party is that it has always had<br />
belief in Australia, and belief in Australians.<br />
We have always seen the better instinct in. people there has always been<br />
two categories of Australians, as Manning Clarke has always said: the<br />
enlargers, and the punishers and straiteners. The people who have believed<br />
in something bigger and better, who have faith in Australians, and belief in<br />
them, that knew they could always do something more, and the people that<br />
said " know your place, keep your eyes down, stay at your last that is our </p>
<p>3<br />
place in life", the straiteners. And it has always been about this. And the<br />
enlargers have always had to pull Australia along, whether it has been into<br />
Federation, or whether it has been into engagement with the rest of the world,<br />
or whether it is to the republic, the enlargers whoever they might be have<br />
always been about pulling the country progressively to the next stage. And I<br />
was saying the other day John Olsen, the great Australian artist, at a<br />
presentation about a year ago in Canberra, said " there are only two kinds of<br />
Australians lovers and others, and we know what to think of the others, don't<br />
Well, anyway, I am here on behalf of the lovers, of the enlargers, of<br />
the people who believe in a bigger Australia. Who have faith in themselves,<br />
have faith in these young people, in the children, who always see something<br />
better. So, that's why I am planting the tree not simply to be part of a series,<br />
but to be part of something new, and be part of something better. Thank you.<br />
ends. </p>
