MBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MIVNISTER<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH TO VICTORIAN REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN ME3TING<br />
9TH MAY, 1977<br />
I'm very glad that the first meeting I am addressing in this<br />
referendum campaign has been organised by the women's sections<br />
in Victoria, because if the women's sections are behind the<br />
referendum proposals, then the proposals have gone a long way<br />
toward succeeding before even a single vote is cast.<br />
This campaign is a vital one because the success of the four<br />
referendum proposals on Saturday week is of fundamental<br />
importance to the constitutional development of Australia,<br />
It will determine whether or not we are capable of making sensible,<br />
practical and major reforms. Reforms which are considered and<br />
necessary, reforms which will irtprove and enhance our constitution.<br />
The four referendum proposals are all these things.<br />
The Constitution our Founding Fathers wrote has served us well.<br />
The Constitution is not outdated, nor has it outlived its<br />
usefulness just because it was' drafted over 70 years ago.<br />
But every so often, reform of our Constitution is required.<br />
Reform which maintains the vitality of the Constitution.<br />
Reform which brings parts of the Constitution into line with<br />
contemporary reality.<br />
The four proposals being put up for referendum are designed<br />
to do these things, and I am sure that they will succeed.<br />
Indeed, if we campaign hard and effectively, there is no reason<br />
why they should not be carried in all States.<br />
I am confident of success because the proposals are fair, sensible<br />
and just and because they fulfil all the requirements the Australian<br />
people have demanded of constitutional changes in the past.<br />
The changes have been the subject of long and careful debate<br />
and extensive consultation.<br />
The principles of all four referendums were discussed in detail<br />
at the Hobart Constitutional Convention last year. At that<br />
Convention, the Commonwealth, all the States, local Government<br />
and all the major parties were represented.<br />
The principles of the four proposals were adopted overwhelmingly<br />
by the Convention. The changes are supported on a bipartisan<br />
basis by all the major Federal parties. Each of the four proposals<br />
we are now supporting was passed in the House of representatives<br />
without a single dissenting voice, and each was passed by an<br />
overwhelming majority in the Senate.<br />
The changes do not ask for more power for politicians. They do<br />
not ask for more power for Canberra. They do not take anything<br />
away from the States. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Putting the four proposals forward is evidence Of ou-r concern<br />
to mrake necessary constitutional reforms, arnd of our support for<br />
the Constitutional Convention.<br />
The Convention was established by the JMcPlahon Liberal Gover-nment,<br />
and has met on a number of occasions.<br />
it is due to meet again in Pexth : later this year.<br />
There is of course no point to the Convention unless the<br />
Governmenit is prepared to give the people the opportunity tLo<br />
vote on those proposals which are supported on all sides and<br />
clearly have Mzit.<br />
These four changes are thesoe. First that Senate and House of<br />
Representatives elections always be held at the same time. xt<br />
is siimply commonsense that the elections be held together and<br />
that the only time you have to vote An. a P'ederal Blectiocn is when<br />
you have to choose Australia's Government.<br />
This proposal will rritain and st&amp;-rengthen the Senate. It also<br />
means we will not have to vote in as many Federcal elections.<br />
ctherwise we could have as many as four elections in the next<br />
four yeaxs.<br />
It is sometimes said that the elections can be brought together<br />
by bringitig the Biouse of Represeiitatives election forward to<br />
the same tinme as the Senate'S. That is not practical.<br />
flepite the -act that the elections for the two HOUSes Were<br />
held t;-, ogether at the last double dissolution, they are now<br />
out of pha1I-se.<br />
This is bevause the Senate's tem is fixed by the constitution<br />
and is back dated to the previous July 1-Wile the term for<br />
the House of Representatives dates from the timne mem-bers are<br />
sworn i-n. Usually a fewq weeks after the election.<br />
Thus, if the elections were to be brought together, under present<br />
conditions there would he the continued risk of cutting short<br />
the tearm of the House of Representatives<br />
This at th-ree years isalzeady relatively short.-Further reducing<br />
it would not help good Government.<br />
The Senate; fax from being weakened will be strengthened and<br />
protected Aby the simultaneous election proposal. Pequirinlg at<br />
least ha1f the Senate to go to an election if it forces the<br />
Gover-nment to go to the people will actually strengthen the<br />
Senate. In 1975 it Was quite by chance that certain bills existed which<br />
enabled the Governor-General to order a double dissolution and<br />
na-ce. both H-ouses face election. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Had this not been the case, and the Senate not been. able, to f ace<br />
the people at the same time. A number of Senators would not<br />
have agreed to block supply. They would not have felt they<br />
had the right to mak'e the Rouse of Representatives go to an<br />
election without the voters being able to pass a judgemnent on<br />
the Senate's actions at the same time.<br />
The Senate's powers are great. But if the present situation,<br />
where the Senate can send the House of Representatives to an<br />
election alone persists, I can foresee two alternative<br />
consequences either of which will diminish the Senate's power<br />
and authority.<br />
On the other hand, the Senate might ref use to use its power<br />
to check a bad government unless there are the circumstances<br />
which would permit a double dissolution.<br />
Senators would not act because tbtir actions could not be judged<br />
by the people at the election. This would erode the Senate's<br />
powers. Alternatively, if the Senate were to act to make the House of<br />
Representatives face the people without going to an election<br />
themselves. Then there would be a public outcry against the<br />
Senate which would lead to the Senate's powers being restricted<br />
or abolished.<br />
Either of these alternatives would be bad for democratic goverment<br />
bad for the States, bad for Australiaj bad for the Senate.-That is<br />
, Why it is important that tbhis--referendum be passed.<br />
The second referendum proposal is that, whenever a Senator '-dies<br />
or resigno, he will be replaced, for the remainder of his<br />
term of office, by a member of the same party.<br />
This will guarantee that your choice of parties for t-he Senate<br />
cannot be altered, by accident or design. Our system of<br />
proportional representation for the Senate is designed to ensure<br />
that the Senate represents all sectors of the electorate in<br />
precisely the correct proportions.<br />
Yet under the constitution as it presently stands, a vacancy in<br />
the Senate can result in a complete change in the party balance.<br />
It is fundamental to our democracy that only the people should<br />
determine the balance of the parties in the Senate.<br />
Once this proposal is accepted the peoples choice will be<br />
preserved until they have an opportunity to make another choice<br />
at the next election. I<br />
The third referendum proposal is that voters in the Australian<br />
Capital Territory and Northern Territory should have a vote<br />
in all future referendums. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
it is extraordinary that territorial vroters have for so long<br />
been denied this funda-mental right. A right all other<br />
Australianrs have.<br />
I know of no rational or rcasonable argument for denying<br />
territorial voters this basic right. Territo'rial votercs have<br />
the samne obligations as other Australians.<br />
They pay tax es, they are obliged to observe the laws of the<br />
Comionw~ ealth. They vote for members of Parliament. The outeonie<br />
of referend-ams affect then. as much as they do other Australians.<br />
Our democracy is the weaker u. ntil the voters of the territories<br />
have the basic right to vote in referendums restored to them.<br />
The fourth arid * final referendum proposal is to set a retiring<br />
age for-Fedexal Justices.<br />
Bigh Court Juatices would retire at 70 and -the retirement age<br />
f or other Federal Court Judges would be determined by Pa√± liantent.<br />
The proposal does not affect the terms of Judges alrea-dy appointed<br />
to the Bench. There is thus no question of breaching the<br />
existing Judges ter-ms of appointment. This proposal is only<br />
reasonable.<br />
Most jobs have retirement ages, arid for good reason,<br />
are as affected by old age as the rest of us.<br />
Iis only JFair that after the age of 70, responsibility should<br />
be ha-nded over to younger people. ' This is even more important<br />
now that'--the new system of Federal ' anmily Courts have been<br />
set. ulp.<br />
All foury referendum proposals are fair, just an~ d rea~ onable.<br />
They meet all the requirement16s for-success-They have been<br />
thce subject of extensive consideration and consultation.<br />
They have the support of all major Federal Parties.<br />
They do no Divolve more power for Canberra. They will make<br />
the Consti-tution work better. The polls show that all the<br />
referendums are supported by substantial majorities in all States.<br />
But we all kn~ ow thatthere is no sure guarantee of defeat than<br />
complacently believing. success is assured.<br />
To guarantee success, we should all go out and work f or the<br />
referendums by talking to people about them, by Inianning polling<br />
booths, by doing all we can to increase support for them.<br />
If we do this, -then I have no doubt the referendums% will be agreed<br />
to by a majority of people in all the States.<br />
