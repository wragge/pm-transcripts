TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PORT OF FREMANTLE,<br />
14 MARCH 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Andrew Peacock and John Hoewson<br />
are saying that you and Treasurer Keating panicked over<br />
interest rates yesterday.<br />
PM: If there's any sign of panic in this election, it's not<br />
on our side of politics. The panic . is confined to the<br />
conservativos as well. it might be. What has happened is<br />
s~ uiply that t~ he Treasurer, Paul Knating and Prime Minister<br />
Hawkti havR stated the obvious and that is that their Government<br />
has put in place the economic structure and policoies which<br />
can enable interest rates to come down. Welve.. stated'the<br />
obvious, an obvious which has been confirmed sinc( A I spoke<br />
yesterday within the banking industry.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, despite your generous<br />
endorsement of Mr Keating this morning, apparently he hasn't<br />
made it into Mr Howard's war Cabinet.<br />
PM: Well, what is significant of course is first the<br />
assumption by Mr Howard that he would be Prime Minister.<br />
The people in Australia have shown that they don't trust the<br />
conservatives in time of war. They were in office at the<br />
start of the last war and they got thrown out because they<br />
weren't competent and John Curtin-, which is appropxriat-H<br />
to say here in Fremantle, John Curtin, the Member for<br />
Fremantle, became the Prime Minister of Australia in time<br />
of war because the conservatives weren't up to thejob. So<br />
that's the first thing to say about. the as-suJIption of Johnr<br />
Hfiward. The second thing of course to say about it is the<br />
very interesting omission from his own side of politics.<br />
Where is Andrew? I mean, he's certainly giving very<br />
considerable emphasis now ' to what he said last year. There<br />
is no trust between Mr Howard and Mr Peacock and he thinks<br />
that much of the man who is offering to be Prime Minister<br />
of Austral. ia, Mr Howard wouldn't put him in his hypothetical<br />
Cabinet. If you ever wanted an indication of the depth of<br />
distrust, bitterness and hatred within the coalition and<br />
within the Liberal Party itself, John Howard's underlined<br />
it again. </p>
<p>2<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you have eithe. r of them in your war Cabinet*?<br />
PM% In war the situation would be, and of course that is<br />
entirely hypothetical because we are living, as I've said<br />
bef ore, '. ia-rimo re optimistic -time than ever before, there's<br />
not. going to be war. But if I could have a hypothetical<br />
answer to your question, it would be that the people of<br />
Australia would want, as they've had before, that is~ Labor<br />
in power in war as in peace. The only GovrrinIt which hdL;<br />
ever been called upon with trust by the Australiazi people<br />
i. n the time of conflict and we've never let theml down.<br />
JOURNALIST; Mr Hawke, you said earlier thai. you had o<br />
intention of stepping aside if Labor's re-elected, but isrn't.<br />
it the reality is you could be pushed out?<br />
PM: Dear oh dear, where did this fellow come from~? Whert; M<br />
did you come from?<br />
JOURNALIST: Well, Canberra, the same place as you did.<br />
PM: Did you? Well, you must have been, you must. have bF-etn<br />
hol~ ed up somewhere in Canberra. Where's this push going to<br />
come from? There's never been such unity behind a leader<br />
and a Prime Minister as there is behind Bob Hawke. I mean,<br />
yoG&amp; Ave had a good drinX last night, olcL boy. What did you<br />
give him, what did you giv4Awellows?<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: The question of polls, Labor is, you know, in<br />
front in most of the polls that we've seen. Are you worried<br />
that this might lead to complacency on the part of some voters<br />
that there'll be a stronger protest vote than otherwise<br />
there would?<br />
S PM: No, I want to make the obvious comment. It's almost<br />
banal to make it, but I do make it. It's the one on the<br />
24th that does count. I would be dishonest if I didn't say<br />
that, you know, I'd rather be in front in the polls than behind<br />
Obviously I would. I think people will make their<br />
Judgements on the issues and on the way the campaign's gone<br />
and on that basis I feel, feel confident of the right<br />
dimision without being cocky or complacent about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's your reaction to the West Australian<br />
Democrats' backf lip? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PM: Well you might notice if you read the transci-ipt of<br />
yesterday I indicated that this might happen. It just<br />
seemed to nit-if you did an initellectual analysis of it, it<br />
was at) uns~ ustainable decision and I think that that<br />
awialysis that I did for you in the Press conference<br />
yesterday has been proven corroct.<br />
