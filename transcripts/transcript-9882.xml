PRIME MINISTER 147/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
TRENDS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF CASH INCOME AND NON-CASH BENEFITS<br />
I have today received a report on income distribution which demonstrates that<br />
the Government's policies aimed at ensuring a fairer Australia have worked.<br />
The Consultancy Report Trends in the Distribution of Cash Income and Non-<br />
Cash Benefits was commissioned to identify trends in incomes and income<br />
distribution in Australia since 1981-82.<br />
It was prepared by Dr David Johnson from the University of Melbourne and<br />
Drs lan Manning and Otto Hellwig from the National Institute of Economic and<br />
Industry Research, who are among Australia's leading researchers in the<br />
field. To quote from the report:<br />
" improvements in government policies and programs in income support<br />
payments, and services such as education, health, public housing and<br />
child care, and the progressive nature of the income tax system, have all<br />
contributed to the result that Australia appears to have become a more<br />
equal society over the period from 1981-82 to 1993-94."<br />
The debate on inequality in Australia has been difficult to follow. There have<br />
been different definitions of economic inequality and a lack of consistent and<br />
reliable data.<br />
This study, however, is the latest and most comprehensive data available. It<br />
is also the first to comprehensively assess the impact of non-cash<br />
government benefits, such as education, health, housing and child care.<br />
The three main findings of the report are:<br />
1. Australian households are, on average, better off today than in the early<br />
1980s Taking into account the number of people who live in a household, all<br />
household types sole parents, single people, couples, couples with<br />
dependent children, couples living with other adults and single people </p>
<p>living together as a household benefited from the increase in average<br />
total income of 9.1 per cent over the period studied. ( Total income<br />
includes private income, government cash benefits and the value of<br />
non-cash government benefits.)<br />
2. Australia is a society with a more equal distribution of income today than<br />
in the early 1980s<br />
Households in the lower income ranges received a greater share of<br />
total income over the study period, whereas those in the top<br />
per cent of income earners received relatively less. As the report<br />
notes, " this demonstrates the substantial and increasing impact that<br />
government interventions have had on inequality".<br />
3. The non-cash social wage has played an important role in this<br />
redistributive process, and its importance has increased over the study<br />
period The value of non-cash benefits such as health, education, housing,<br />
child care, concessions and subsidies grew by 41 per cent in real<br />
terms over this time. All households benefited from this increase, but<br />
those on the lowest incomes generally gained the most.<br />
Families with children were major beneficiaries of the increases in total income.<br />
The total income for couples with dependent children rose by 12.7 per cent and<br />
for sole parents rose by 22.3 per cent.<br />
Older people also gained significantly from government policies of targeted<br />
assistance and by increases in the value of services they receive. Couples<br />
over 65 received the highest level of non-cash assistance of any group over<br />
the study period. For older people, around two-thirds of their total income is<br />
in the form of government cash benefits and social wage services.<br />
The results of the study have been thoroughly validated. There has also<br />
been a comprehensive assessment of the results against other major<br />
research in the field.<br />
The report concludes that, not only do government policies reduce inequality,<br />
but the importance of government intervention in reducing inequality has<br />
increased between 1981-82 and 1993-94.<br />
Over the study period, left to itself, the market would have produced incomes<br />
that led to declining living standards for many households.<br />
Improvements in income support and non-cash benefits, however, have<br />
ensured that Australian households are better off now than they were in<br />
1981-82. This is particularly so for those on lower incomes.<br />
