VISIT TOINDONESIA, SINGAPORE AND MALAYSIA<br />
Speech by the Prime M4inister, the RPt Hion.<br />
William McMahon, CHI, HP.<br />
AT DINNER GIVEN IN HIS HONOUR BY THE PRIM'E 1INISTER OF SINGAPORE,<br />
LFE KUAN YFW. 9 JUNE 1972<br />
Prime Minister, Excellencies, and Distinguished Guests:<br />
It is a privilege to be the guest of the Singapore Covernment<br />
and to return once more to a city I have visited many times, but not<br />
until now as Prime &gt; ninister of Australia.<br />
As you said, Mr Lee, I was last here as Foreign Minister in<br />
1971 for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. On that<br />
occasion, I was impressed by the admirable way Singapore rlayed host<br />
to our Commonwealth colleagues and if you will permit me to say so,<br />
Mr Lee, I admired your masterly handling of the proceedings as Chairman.<br />
When Australians come to Singapore, Prime M~ inister, they do not<br />
feel they walk among strangers. -They know they are among friends.<br />
It is in that spirit I am he~ re tonight.<br />
There arc bonds between our countries which I value and some<br />
are the subject of ? olitical differences in Australia. But, as I said<br />
this morning when we snoke together in private, it is not my intention<br />
to export domestic ' olitical controversy.<br />
The matters that concern us both, are, I bolieve, fundamental<br />
in the social sense as thay affect relations between people and of<br />
practical importance in our common effort to advance the fortunes of<br />
our countries and do all-we can to secure peace and orogress in the<br />
region. I speak for -a country that haz great natural resources but<br />
which for a large part is a harsh, dry land which wo have tamed and<br />
learnt to live with, and developed a society, getting on now to be<br />
some two hundred years old. </p>
<p>You, Sir, load n cou. 1, tr, 1 t-: Lat has not the natural re-, sources9<br />
we posscss. But you,. too, . heve.-t ump'v 1 and : 11, vc &gt;-uilt up a<br />
progressiv: e cnv. rornent,. w.-iose1 Uaorn_-e Iave culture: s cgoinq back to<br />
ancienttis Th: sre are differences of magnitude of our haistories. But<br />
thari-are also forco which . believe bring us togather -tnd which<br />
today fund us with commofl intere, ts in South-East Psia at a time of<br />
challenge and chalige.<br />
You, Mr Primrt ? iinister. lavc spokan of the momentous nolitical<br />
changes in the world in l.-: 3t eighteen Tronths, and I agree -oith<br />
vou that we must not rush to firm conclusions as a result cf whlat has<br />
take -n place, or as you so aptly said, to ' start changing our friends'.<br />
It is about our frieridshin, Mr_ Le*, that I want to say something<br />
tonig.' ht, becauso both know that all is not politics in lift, and<br />
there are meeting poin-ts for our peopic in many ways w-hichl can lead<br />
to rarc fulfilimonts in human relations.<br />
1 ither counitry can iive aloÃ± p in th. I-o * latc y-aar3 of thetwantit<br />
-th century. For our nart, the twin determinants of goograony<br />
and hi: 5tory are involving us increasingly in South1--East ASiaC.<br />
Geogranhy-l -ias nlacced us on the-southeorn rirm of that area.<br />
As to hi-stor6tihe fall of Singapore in 1942 was a dramatic<br />
catalyst for the future dovcelonrient of Singapore and for Australia<br />
also. For your part, in the past 30 yzars, and more rapidly in tho<br />
nast sevcn years, you have moved wita ' vigour and rnurnose to a<br />
prosD2. rous, ordarlyi, 1,! ell-deav--_ 1:) red and indopendlent State in Asia,<br />
with links to our rEuroncarn civiLlisation of e: nduring strength. You<br />
have displaycd ruggod self-disciLpline, a vitality and an enthusiasm<br />
of a remarkable order.<br />
Teisonc thing ' iThi , cl. i irhprossos itself on me iwhene-ver your<br />
cofu nSriy qarre cmesto ttention whether in the news or in<br />
our minds. It i~ the w% Tcltho f goodw-. ill which auto-maetically extends<br />
to i~-as if by nature.<br />
I wonder whether, assit hzro tonight, ralise tha full<br />
lengthA. ; 1-p-th and breadLth of th-at goodwill, or of the-optortunities<br />
for co-omnration between us whicii -flow fro. it.<br />
Wo k now, you cis an illluminating clemr: m-t in t. he. . society of Asia.<br />
We know you also for* your en--tiusi. asm and -, uccess in youir dcevelooment<br />
in many important directions. For instanco, in your exciting urban<br />
ronew-al and in the tall buildings, I saw. reaching for the Sky as I<br />
drove in from the air-Dort yetra. In all this the-re is a quality<br />
in your country for ave,: ryone to se<br />
