TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH SALLY BEGBIE, 7.30 REPORT<br />
9 MARCH 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
He belives himself as passionate, thinks the recession was<br />
unfortunate and sees the arts spiritually uplifting. You<br />
might be forgiven for confusing the identity of this person,<br />
it's Prime Minister Paul Keating. And this is the line he<br />
is now adopting. And our arts reporter, Sally Begby, talked<br />
with Paul Keating during his visit to the Adelaide Arts<br />
Festival. PM: A few of the troops back home, back in Canberra query<br />
the wisdom of coming among arty types. Well, I have<br />
done it before. And they said, ' are you sure you know<br />
the protocols, make sure you put your arm around<br />
everyone'. So I decided to risk it, I decided that one<br />
cannot stay forever in the conformity of the<br />
Parliamentary burrow.<br />
' The result is that by 5 to 4 majority, they have<br />
awarded the 1991-92 Archibald Prize to Brian<br />
Westwood for his portrait entitled, The Prime<br />
Minister'.<br />
He prefers the sound of the classics to the thard of leather<br />
on willow. Less than 3 months into office, the Bankstown<br />
boy with a VFL ticket is tailoring his image on the Arts<br />
wicket. PM: I think that the Arts always gives any society that<br />
chance to push out the boundaries of the temperal,<br />
grasping for the spiritual and it's important for our<br />
souls, it is important for our inner being. So the<br />
Arts not only helped define who you are and what you<br />
are, but they also spiritually uplift you, and I think<br />
it is terribly important for a country to, and for<br />
Governments of countries to sort of understand that.<br />
J: The Arts are also about passion. Do you see yourself<br />
as a passionate man? </p>
<p>PM: I absolutely run on passion. That's why makes me tick.<br />
That's what makes me tick. Absolutely, I mean, if you<br />
are not passionate about things, I don't think you can<br />
enjoy life to the fullest. And I am very passionate<br />
about things.<br />
J: Keating's affair with the Arts has been long-standing.<br />
As Treasurer he implemented the most lucrative Arts<br />
awards in the country, possibly in the world. The<br />
creative fellowships, affectionately known as ' The<br />
Keatings', give established artists between $ 150<br />
$ 200,000 over a three to four year period to pursue<br />
their ideas.<br />
J: Will the Arts get a higher priority in your Governent?<br />
PM: Well, I thought about taking the Arts portfolio myself<br />
actually. But the problem you have with it is that<br />
then every element of the Arts believes they should<br />
have access to the Minister and be able talk to him or<br />
her, as the case may be. And in the job I am doing,<br />
you don't really have the time to do that. So it has<br />
to be with another Minister, I think. But I am keeping<br />
an interest in it and I am now thinking about what, in<br />
the longer run, what our Arts policy should be.<br />
J: Do you think that as we move towards a republic that<br />
the place for the Arts will have increasing importance<br />
and therefore deserve more funding?<br />
PM: Well, the Arts are part of the reason why people are<br />
even thinking about it, I think. So it's a case of the<br />
chicken and the egg. I think, the Arts will be first,<br />
and if there is further political change in this<br />
country, it will be part due to the sort of ambiLence in<br />
the national psyche of the national debate that's come<br />
from, in part, the Arts.<br />
J: The Australia Council, the major body for the Arts, has<br />
seen it's funding cut by $ 20 million since 1974.<br />
During the last decade of Labor it has had no increase<br />
in real -terms. Still, Paul Keating is promising, only,<br />
to look at funding levels.<br />
PM: It's how you spend it, and whether the policy of<br />
thinning the' butter on to the bread or dropping it on<br />
in dollops or lumps. Whether you actually make one<br />
area of -the Arts more significantly funded, better, or<br />
whether you spread the joy widely, I think that's a<br />
question, a teal question for policy.<br />
J: Do you think it's a bit dangerous for you hanging your<br />
hat on the Arts banner and moving away maybe from the<br />
sports banner? I mean, Mr Hawke was seen at yacht<br />
races and you are seen at writers festivals. </p>
<p>PM: I used to sail an 18-footer in Sydney Harbour and I<br />
will stay up for a good fight, or a good tennis match,<br />
so it is not as if I am sort of one or the other. I am<br />
interested in sport and I think sport is very good.<br />
But I am also interested in the Arts, I think the Arts<br />
are terribly important and the crowds that now come to<br />
the Adelaide Arts Festival or the major galleries and<br />
museums, theatre, dance, speaks for itself I think,<br />
does it not?<br />
J: It's ironic that Paul Keating who loves the music of<br />
Mahler and the art of Turner, finds himself leading a<br />
land a hemisphere away from Europe, a country he<br />
stopped short of saying, is pushing towards a republic.<br />
PM: Well, it's changing and it's part of that. I think the<br />
political system has had the sense to let that change<br />
percolate through the nation over time. And that is a<br />
sensible position to take.<br />
J: But you -have enjoyed a great momentum on this debate in<br />
the last couple of weeks. Do you think that we will<br />
be...<br />
PM: I think one is entitled to say that we have an identity<br />
of our own and ought to be confident about ourselves<br />
and independent of people who wish to keep us tiLed to<br />
another Apoc. You can say those things and be entitled<br />
to say them. It is entirely another matter to be<br />
saying, now we ought to move therefore from this point<br />
to that, in sort of constitutional terms.<br />
J: But do you see that perhaps we will have a referendum<br />
before the turn of the century?<br />
PM: I don't know, I don't know. It just depends how this<br />
debate goes. It is a feeling, it is not a debate is<br />
it? It is a feeling.<br />
J: But it is a growing feeling Prime Minister?<br />
PM: I think it is.<br />
J: Paul Keating denies that his tilt towards republicanism<br />
as John Rewson describes it, is just the reaction of an<br />
Irish Catholic larrikin.<br />
PM: Be clear about the fact that not only can we do it, but<br />
we will do it, will be doing it, will be controlling<br />
our own affairs, will be making our own place in the<br />
world and saying, here we are, we are Australians, take<br />
us as we are, we are different, we are from certainly a<br />
country with European origins, but we are not European,<br />
we're Australian. And I think if the country feels<br />
that, we will make the economic change more quickly and<br />
better. We've had the misfortune of the recession but<br />
it will be simply a period and a longer run, I think,<br />
period of success and change. And I know that change </p>
<p>is occur: cing. I know that cultural change is in, in<br />
commence and in trade, and I think it is in in societal<br />
terms as well. So I think one has every reason to be<br />
confident about Australia.<br />
J: Where do youlget your confidence from? You are talking<br />
that it's important for Australia to have confidence.<br />
Where have you gained your confidence? Some people<br />
said you got off to a shaky start as Prime Minister,<br />
you're clearly confident now?<br />
PM: No, but I always like the sort of, I was reconnoitring<br />
for a couple of weeks, you see.<br />
J: Did you have a good look around?<br />
PM: working out where all the bits were. And once I<br />
worked that out, away we went.<br />
J: Just two months ago he was Mr 25 per cent, but there<br />
were moments in Adelaide where you could sense that<br />
even an undertaker can find a heartland.<br />
I<br />
Do you think that there will be more votes for you if<br />
you fixed up the Australian Cricket Team than if you<br />
fixed up funding to the Arts in Australia?<br />
PM: Well, I don't know. One does not think in those terms.<br />
I know that this may come as a great shock and<br />
surprise, but there is still some substantial altruism<br />
in a way in which a Government functions. And to do<br />
what is right and best is what's important, and I think<br />
it is important to get the Arts right, to get the<br />
policy about the Arts right.<br />
