OPENING OF THE SIRINJIU DAM, NEWJ GUINEA<br />
7T~ H SEPTEMBER,-1963<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, theRt . Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Your Honours, the Judges, Ladies and Gentlemen t<br />
I remind myself of nothing quite so much as the man<br />
in one of' the fables, that nmy learned friends will remember, of<br />
the young junior who was appearing in a case with a leader whose<br />
capacity he doubted. This, of course, is not a unique experience<br />
Ond he decided therefore that he would. have to follow his leader<br />
i~ n the argument and that he would argue I wontt be technical<br />
about it Point A and then he would argue Point B and then he<br />
vWould laugh the case out of Court, And fired with these ambitions,<br />
he sat there and he listened to the old fellow who after a while,<br />
began to receive some very awkward questions from the judgesand<br />
they seemed to the junior to be very difficult questions.<br />
The oldi boy handled them rather well. As time went on, the<br />
junior began abandoning the idea of arguing Point A; he then<br />
dropped the idea of arguing Point B; he then decided that it<br />
was unnecessary to laugh the case out of Court and when his<br />
leader finished he stood up and said in a small voice, " I have<br />
nothing to add.' 3 Now my case today is in the converse,<br />
I'm the old fellow IBm the leader so to speak. I have had two<br />
juniors operating this morning and, upon my word I have nothing<br />
to add. ( Laughter) I would hate to subtract anything from what<br />
Paul Hasluck said about me because my wife has been here, she<br />
has made a note of it and I will live on this for the rest of my<br />
life. Nor, of course can I emulate my young colleague,<br />
Gordon Freeth's familiarity with technical problems. I'm no<br />
scientist, Itna not an engineer except of a kind and therefore,<br />
most of these things are beyond me. I thought, for example,<br />
that this Dam was covered with sheets of steel, I had no idea<br />
that they had that other word that Mr. Freeth used about them,<br />
But there is one thing that I do clearly understand about this<br />
Dam and that is that it will contain a great area of water and<br />
quantity of water and when I looked in the bock of words I<br />
realised that the water area of what now becomes the lake is<br />
3,000 acres and I haven't read a word about it in any of the<br />
provincial dailies of Melbourne or Sydney or any other capital<br />
city in Australia. Not a word. And the lake at Canberra is<br />
only going to be half the size, ( Laughter) Half the size almost<br />
exactly, and it receives daily dishonourable mention in almost<br />
every newspaper in Australia.<br />
Now I mentioned that to you because, you know, a lot<br />
of you must occasionally feel isolated. I ask you to remember<br />
that there is some virtue in isolation. You escape a great deal<br />
of criticism that you might have otherwise received. Welli I<br />
dontt know whether you would. I don't know whether you need to<br />
bother about criticism, I wonder whether everybody here today<br />
looks around and remembers occasionally not in a priggish way,<br />
not in a self-satisfied way but remembers that you are here<br />
contributing to the development of a remarkable country; that<br />
in one sense, in the modern sense, you are pioneering this<br />
country, not for yourselves alone though we all want to live<br />
but pioneering it for those who are to come for its future,<br />
This is, I think, a tremendous reflection, a wonderful thing to<br />
have in our minds.<br />
Here we are we are in a place which must have<br />
presented the most tremendous problems to people coming in to<br />
do engineering work, and yet it has been done, and in days to </p>
<p>-2-<br />
come eople will drive past it or across it, they will have the<br />
benlitof the electric power that proceeds from it and proceeds<br />
further and further down and I suppose they will get to a stage<br />
where they will take it for granted. You know that it can't be<br />
taken for granted. You know that this has required and has<br />
received effort and imagination. Now that's one aspect of it.<br />
But there is a second point that I would like to put<br />
to you. W~ hat this country is getting and what it needs is joint<br />
enterprise, a feeling of joint enterprise, a feeling of partnership<br />
between those who are settlers of European stockc, those who are<br />
the indigenous inhabitants of the Territory and the people of<br />
Australia who between them represent a body of trustees and therefore<br />
have the duties of trustees. This is a joint enterprise<br />
with all of these three elements bound to work together, bot. nd<br />
to respect each other and, I would suggest, bound to believe that<br />
the closer their partnershp the more permanent it will be.' I<br />
have a great though inadequate conception of what can be dolie<br />
in this country but I am not unaviare of the difficulties that<br />
it presents, If we remember all the time that this is a jo' 3' ht<br />
enterprise, we would be better off.<br />
For example, as my colleague said to you, don't think<br />
of Canberra as being some remote astral body because although<br />
remote in terms of distance, it is no more remote in terms of<br />
thought than any other place you care to mention. Dont underestimate<br />
the duties, the task of a Minister for Territories.<br />
You know, most of us well I'm Prime Minister, Ifm the sort of<br />
general handyman but most Ministers have a Department to<br />
administer. It may be Tariff right, he deals with tariff<br />
problems. It may be Trade good he deals with problems of<br />
trade, and so on. if he's the Attorney-General, he deals with<br />
the problems of the law and legal administration. B3ut a Minister<br />
for the Territories deals with all of these things, they all come<br />
within his jurisdiction. He has divisions under him he doesn't<br />
have Ministers under him but in every other respect he is?, on a<br />
more limited scale, a Prime Minister of a Teiritory or Territories<br />
with the entire complex of administrative machinery of all kinds.<br />
This calls for remarkable talent, great patience, great understanding<br />
and I've no doubt a great capacity for sustaining criticism<br />
' because if you just have one job to do, it is p~ zetty easy to<br />
criticise a man who has twelve jobs to do. Always have that in<br />
mind. I said just now that this was a joint enterprise, but<br />
I mentioned that it was an enterprise in which were involved<br />
Australia the Administration and the settlers and the original<br />
inhabitants of these Territories. Well, it is a remarkable blend.<br />
You have here civil servants; you have here people who are<br />
engaged in industries of one kind or another; you have here<br />
settlers, planters; you have here hundreds and hundreds of<br />
thousands of people going right back to a point of primitive<br />
existence which the average person in the rest of the world finds<br />
it difficult to imagine and yet, everyone of these elements must<br />
work together if we are to achieve here what we all want to achieve,<br />
not only enduring results but a permanent social and human<br />
structure. This will require the co-operative effort.<br />
You know, I dontt want to quote poetry at you<br />
unnecessarily but many of you will remember vividly the famous<br />
lines of William Blake<br />
" I will not cease from mental fight;<br />
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,<br />
Till we have built Jerusalem<br />
In England's green and pleasant lad. 9 ea e*/ </p>
