<p>There is no better way the Government can support the community than by helping the jobless find work.  The Government's policy have helped reduce unemployment to a thirty-two year low and importantly slashed the long-term jobless rate -  and that's a fantastic social dividend from the Coalition's economic policies.  </p>
<p>The Government's Welfare to Work reforms are another example of how we are fostering a work culture in Australia.  While it's early days, there are encouraging signs that Welfare to Work, coupled with a strong economy, is helping more people find jobs.  </p>
<p>This year's financial forecast for income support payments have been reduced by about $500 million as a result of more people finding jobs, but even more importantly, thousands of people reliant on welfare are now earning more and enjoying the benefits of employment. </p>
<p>Single parents are also embracing the new work culture.  With many single parents on income support required to find part-time work from July of this year under the new Welfare to Work program, some 9,000 have already voluntarily returned to the workforce. </p>
<p>I cannot commend these parents enough.  They have voluntarily embraced the Government's work-over-welfare attitude and are reaping the many benefits of having a job.  </p>
<p>Welfare to Work, of course, relies on a prospering economy with a strong labour market.  Through good economic management, the Government has helped create a booming job market enabling thousands of Australians to move off welfare.  This is something we can all be proud of. </p>
