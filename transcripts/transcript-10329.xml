TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE I-ION JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
AND THE CHANCELLOR OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY, HIS<br />
EXCELLENCY DR HELMUT KOHL<br />
JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
E O IE<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start this press conference by reporting that this<br />
morning the Chancellor and 1, who had our first ever meeting, spent one and a half hours in a very<br />
wide ranging beneficial discussion about bilateral issues and also world political and economic issues.<br />
I welcome the Chancellor to Australia as the longest serving leader in the democratic world. The<br />
leadership that hie has given to Germany and to Europe has been quite outstanding and the insights<br />
that he provided in relation to European political and economic issues were extremely valuable.<br />
And I especially welcome the warmth of the personal exchanges between the two of us and we both<br />
identified the very deep cultural, historical and personal links that exist between Australia and<br />
Germany. It is not only an economic association but it is also a very strong people to people<br />
association. The Chancellor's views on European unity were strong, robust and very direct.<br />
In conclusion I emphasise to the Chancellor that despite the very strong affinity between Australia and<br />
the Asia-Pacific region and the enormous stress that Australia places on our links with that part of the<br />
world, the bulk of our direct investment goes into the European Union and that there is absolutely<br />
nothing incompatible between our association with the Asia-Pacific region and deep and growing<br />
economic and other ties with the nations of Europe and not the least the Federal Republic.<br />
KOHL:<br />
Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen. I want to use this opportunity here to thank you. I'm also here in<br />
front of the public. Thank you for the very warm and gracious hospitality with which you received<br />
myself and the members of my delegation here to Australia.<br />
This is my first visit as Chancellor of the re-unified Germany to your country. At this point in time I<br />
would like to thank you and the people of Australia for the ongoing and continuous support and<br />
sympathy that you have shown towards our country in the process leading up to unification.<br />
I said just now I was here on my first visit as Chancellor of the re-unified Germany and I think that this<br />
demonstrates our very clearly the sort of tremendous changes that we have seen in only a<br />
comparatively short period of time. And in many ways this was the basic sentiment underlying the<br />
talks that we had here this morning, the Prime Minister and I, talks indeed they were characterised by<br />
a spirit of partnership indeed a friendship, and obviously I think now we should draw conclusions from<br />
these events.<br />

You have just said Prime Minister that we have seen tremendous changes occurring also here in the<br />
Asian-Pacific region just as we have known such dramatic changes over in Europe. Now obviously,<br />
geographically speaking, there is a great distance with regards to kilometres between our two<br />
countries, but that doesn't really amount to all that much if we look at the global developments in the<br />
world at large. And therefore I think we were at one, Prime Minister, in saying that we would like this<br />
visit of mine here to Australia to inject more quality into the relationship between our two countries.<br />
This goes for the political, the economic relationship and last but not least obviously for cultural<br />
relations and just now we have witnessed the initialling of an agreement in this particular sphere.<br />
We would like to see obviously as many investments as possible taken out by Australian companies in<br />
Germany and in particularly in the former East Germany and obviously we would also like to see the<br />
reverse happening investments taken by German companies here in Australia.<br />
And I am using this opportunity really here to also address the public in Australia. I think it is<br />
important to see what is currently happening in Germany and to seize this opportunity that is opening<br />
up. And I'm referring here not only to what is happening in Germany but what is happening in Europe and<br />
no matter what you may be reading or hearing these days you may rest assured that we are making<br />
progress in building the European house.<br />
In six weeks time we shall have another very important conference in Amsterdam where we will be<br />
completing the Maastricht treaty. And at April of next year we shall take the important decisions on<br />
who will be participating in the first group of those who will be members of the existing currency<br />
union. So Euro will come, will be brought about no matter what you may be reading and with the timeframe<br />
that we have agreed upon. Now obviously I would never dare to give any sort of advice to Australians<br />
but if I were an Australian I would say irrespective of all of the undoubted developments that we see<br />
and have seen recently in the Asia-Pacific area, Europe is back again on the stage. Europe is not sort<br />
of gone, it is back again. And it is my wish that this relationship between the Europe of the European<br />
Union and this region here, Asian-Pacific and Australia and the relationship bilaterally between<br />
Australia and Germany be a very close one, and there are direct links between aeroplanes, between<br />
you and us. There need not be a stopover or a change of planes in London you can obviously make a<br />
stopover in London if you like. There are excellent communication links that I believe are binding our<br />
two countries together.<br />
On a more serious note now after what I have seen this morning, no matter what you may be thinking<br />
and hearing about economic times, about the introduction of the Euro and other matters perhaps I<br />
should share a few of the thoughts with you that I felt this morning when visiting the war memorial,<br />
and when you then stand there facing the Australian galleries holding the names on the panels of those<br />
who were killed in both the first and the second world war. And at this point in time you remember<br />
with sadness but also with admiration and respect those people who gave their lives during those two<br />
wars. And please bear in mind also that it is the purpose of setting up the European Union to avoid<br />
that this occurs again, that Australians have to go again and fight in a European war.<br />
And to remember that irrespective of all of the ties in the economic and social and cultural field, all of<br />
these diffierent areas that are obviously of very great importance, that irrespective of that, the most<br />
important part of the driving force fo the unification of the European Union is that the 21 st Century<br />
that will start after only 3 years will be one that will be a period, a century of peace and of freedom in<br />
Europe. Thank you Prime Minister and thank you also Prime Minister for accepting the invitation that I 2 f 506/ 3017/ 9: 378 : 24<br />

conveyed to you to come to Germany, an invitation I convey to you on behalf of the President of the<br />
Federal Republic of Germany and I will say that I am looking very much forward on seeing you soon<br />
in our country.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Thank you. Questions Mr Skehan.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Howard, did you put to Dr Kohl Australia's view that the next meeting, that the climate change<br />
meeting in Kyoto, should allow for differentiation of greenhouse emission targets? Did you have any<br />
more success in putting those arguments to him than you did with Mr Hashimoto last week, and what<br />
will Australia's reaction be if unacceptable targets to your Government are imposed? Also, could Dr<br />
Kohl comment on his view of Australia's position on greenhouse emissions?<br />
KOHL: On this question there is a problem and one that is rising out of the natural differences that exist<br />
between our situation and Germany and in Europe, a new situation over here in Australia. But on the<br />
other hand one has to bear in mind that we, both of us, have declared ourselves committed to the<br />
overriding goal of preserving creation. And in the European Union, there are quite distinct nuances in<br />
how this particular issue is viewed in the individual member countries. And right now we are trying to<br />
find a balanced kind of an approach to this and we believe the same holds true in our relationship with<br />
Australia. And I told the Prime Minister that I will see to it at home in Germany and in the European<br />
Union that we have to be careful and I myself will personally get involved in avoiding that and<br />
preventing that, that Australia should not be placed in a position where it is, so to speak, in the dock<br />
on this particular issue. And I do think that we stand a very good chance of coming to a sensible kind<br />
of solution.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I certainly did raise the issue as is implicit in the Chancellor's response. I made claim that<br />
Australia is in a unique position in the sense that Australia simultaneously is a developed country and a<br />
net exporter of energy. Following our discussion today I'll be sending a further detailed personal<br />
communication to the Chancellor going into further aspects of the concerns we have and pointing out<br />
how unless differentiation is allowed for Australia we will be very seriously disadvantaged by what we<br />
perceive to be the possible outcome of the attitude of both the United States and the European Union.<br />
Questions from the German press.<br />
KOHL: You see Prime Minister, they always seem to be absolutely happy and have no other wish in life than<br />
to just sit there. That must be due to your personal charm, not due to mine.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It doesn't work like that here.<br />
JOURNALIST: I can assure that this is the single opinion of the Chancellor. Have you given the Chancellor any 06/ 30/ 97 17: 38: 24<br />
May 1997 </p>
<p>5 taipy: li/ 7/% vwvxv. tila. gov. ati/ pjiiepressrel/ kohli2. lhtml<br />
assurances that you will or your country will participate at the<br />
Expo 2000?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The Chancellor did raise that with me. We will consider what the Chancellor put to us. There are some<br />
considerations moving in both directions. I can say this, that we'll give very conscientious<br />
consideration to what hie put, but I can't at this stage predict what the response will be.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Australian press. Mr Greenlees.<br />
JOURNALIST: A question to Chancellor Kohl would you like to see Australia sitting across from Germany at the<br />
next Asia-Europe Summit in London next year? I understand that it is a matter for each side to decide<br />
on membership, but nonetheless, do you think Australia should get that summit? And a separate<br />
question to Mr H-oward if Australia does not win its position on differentiation are we prepared to<br />
walk away from the climate change convention?<br />
KOHL: On that first question, that obviously is a decision that has to be taken here. But let me just assure you,<br />
I would be very, very much in agreement and I would be very pleased indeed if my colleague were to<br />
sit opposite me at this meeting. I think it could only serve our purpose, the one that we are all striving<br />
for to achieve.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
As to the second question, I hope to persuade the other parties of the fairness, the commonsense and<br />
the practical advantage of differentiation. In those circumstances I'm not going to speculate as to what<br />
Australia might do if those approaches are unsuccessful. I should however emphasise again that this is<br />
very much a question of vital Australian national interests being at stake.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, have you made already up your mind which high speed railway system should connect<br />
Sydney and Canberra?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, but I did talk about that to the Chancellor. And that particular project, and indeed the other<br />
projects, rail projects, potentially available in Australia, were the subjects of some discussion between<br />
the two of us. I would welcome if the Very Fast Train project does go beyond the current stage and I<br />
certainly hope it does, and indeed other projects of that kind in Australia. I would welcome the<br />
enthusiastic competition of German companies with their admirable technology in this area. I hope<br />
there's an opportunity for them to compete and if they're the best, I hope they win.<br />
Thank you.<br />
