PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH FRENCH JOURNALISTS TGV ( VERY<br />
FAST TRAIN), PARIS 19 JUNE 1989<br />
ZE&amp; 0EPROOF<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can you tell us first about<br />
what happened this morning in the agreement of the<br />
environment? PM: When we talked about the environment there were three<br />
elements for that. I guess the most important was our<br />
agreement in regard to the Antarctic. Let me give you the<br />
words of the agreement. They are Australia and France<br />
call upon the consultative parties to the Antarctic Treaty<br />
to negotiate as soon as possible an agreement which would<br />
turn Antarctica into an international wilderness reserve.<br />
Australia and France will closely co-operate to this end.<br />
This means that we jointly believe that it is appropriate<br />
that this last great wilderness on the planet should be<br />
preserved and we undertake together now to push<br />
internationally for an acceptance of that position. This, I<br />
believe, has a significance in ways that are obvious and<br />
perhaps some ways which are not so obvious, and obviously we<br />
will try and see that there is an increasing understanding<br />
of the fragility of that area and therefore the<br />
responsibility that we have now to successive generations to<br />
preserve that region. What's perhaps not so obvious is this<br />
that the Antarctic is a region which enables measurement<br />
of the Greenhouse Effect and the depletion of the ozone<br />
layer in an environment uncontaminated by the effects of<br />
human activity. That's very important and therefore if the<br />
world is going to keep itself in a position where it's going<br />
to be best able to monitor these developments and give<br />
itself a sensitive predictive base from which to make<br />
relevant decisions, it is important that ye keep that<br />
environment, as I say, uncontaminated.<br />
a number of other reasons I think is why we've made<br />
this decision and why we'll do our best to persuade relevant<br />
parties to the Antarctic Treaty system to support our<br />
position. JOURZNALIST: Will you be putting that near the top of the<br />
agenda when you go to Britain and see Mrs Thatcher? </p>
<p>PM: It will certainly be high on the agenda there and when<br />
I go to the United States, when I go to Germany and when I<br />
go to Hungary.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Prime Minister, you've = et Prime Minister<br />
Rocard this morning, you're going to see him again next<br />
August. could you give us your assessment of the role of<br />
France in the South Pacific as well as New<br />
Caledonia and other matters?<br />
PM: Let me preface my answer by saying how much I welcome<br />
the attitude of the Rocard administration to its relations<br />
with Australia and its role in the region. Hitherto there<br />
had been a less than fully congenial atmosphere to the<br />
relationship, but under the Rocard administration I thinkc<br />
we've reached a position where the cordiality in our<br />
relations is as high as it's ever been. We believe that<br />
there is a considerable opportunity for a expansion of the<br />
relationship at the bilateral level. We have in fact<br />
entered agreements an understanding that there should be an<br />
acceleration of the economic and trading commercial<br />
relationship. We hope that there will be a significant<br />
French trade and investment mission to Australia before the<br />
end of this year. We have made an agreement that we should<br />
extend the existing arrangement which covers the area of<br />
agriculture whereby there is an interchange of trainees in<br />
that area, that that should be extended now to the area of<br />
manufacturing, communications, the media and education. We<br />
have also agreed that there should be co-operation upon<br />
specific projects in the South Pacific region. In the area<br />
of New Caledonia, I have unqualifiably welcomed the approach<br />
of the French Government as embodied in the Martignon<br />
Accords and have indicated that we, in particular,<br />
appreciate the finderstanding by the Rocard administration<br />
the absolute necessity to accelerate the training of the<br />
Kanak population so that in the area of bureaucracy,<br />
education, technical and professional areas there shall be a<br />
body of trained and capable Kanak people ready to assume<br />
positions of authority and responsibility in whatever new<br />
constitutional position is adopted in the next decade. And<br />
in that respect, in particular, I have indicated that<br />
Australia is willing to help in this training program. we<br />
have a wide range of relevant, sophisticated training<br />
programs in Australia and we have said that if it is<br />
adjudged by the French authorities that we can be of<br />
assistance in this program, we are ready to do so. On the<br />
question of French nuclear testing program, I have the<br />
Australian position. Monsieur Rocard has indicated their<br />
position. He said there will be a reduction of the testing<br />
program from one under which there were two series of four<br />
tests the unique series to one under which there will<br />
just be one series with six tests. So, on that issue, we<br />
agreed to differ. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Did you receive any assurances that Australia<br />
won't be frozen out of the single market after 1992?<br />
PM: I have talked with the President and the Prime<br />
Minister briefly about that issue. Because we had so many<br />
other areas to discuss I will be picking up that issue in<br />
more detail with Monsieur Fauroux in my discussions this<br />
evening. JOURNALIST: Do you consider France as being part of the<br />
South Pacific?<br />
PM: France is part of the South Pacific. It has a great<br />
history, a long tradition of involvement and there has been<br />
a mistaken apprehension by earlier French administrations<br />
that in some sense Australia wanted to displace France in<br />
the region. This is not the case we think France has a<br />
continuing role to contribute to the well-being of the<br />
nations in this area and it is precisely because we feel<br />
that that we have agreed and suggested that there should be<br />
co-operative projects to assist the nations in this region.<br />
JOURNALIST: You're sitting on a French high speed train.<br />
Is this just a PR exercise or is Australia really interested<br />
in buying one of these things?<br />
PH: I don't know what the alternatives are it's not a PR<br />
exercise and I'm not here thinking about buying, as you so<br />
inelegantly put it " one of these things". There is a very<br />
serious consideration in Australia involving three of our<br />
largest companies in a consortium which is examining the<br />
feasibility of a Very Fast Train on our eastern seaboard,<br />
particularly between Melbourne and Sydney. I believe that<br />
this will come to fruition and it is certainly a relevant<br />
experience for me to see the Very Fast Train in operation<br />
here. JOURNALIST: Can you look ahead to the British visit can<br />
you tell me what the main aims of the British visit are?<br />
PM2 A predominant aim will be to increase the level of<br />
Australian/ United Kingdom economic relationship. I will be<br />
having discussions not only with a range of Ministers,<br />
including of course Mrs Thatcher, but we will be involved,<br />
Mrs Thatcher and myself, in a meeting of some three hundred<br />
leading Australian and British executives who will be<br />
examining in detail the opportunities for increased trade<br />
anid investment between our two countries.<br />
JOURNALIST*, I hear you're also going to the Test match.<br />
Any predictions? </p>
<p>v 4.<br />
PM: Yes, I'm happy that I'm in a position that I made the<br />
prediction before the start of the Test Series I sent a<br />
cable to the Australian captain, Alan Border, saying that I<br />
believed they would win the First Test and that I would see<br />
them at Lords when they were one up. The prediction's going<br />
well at the moment.<br />
JOURNALIST: So your prediction is that they will win the<br />
whole Test Series is it?*<br />
PU:* Yes I think we will win the Series. We deserve to.<br />
JOURNALIST: You are going to see Mr Chirac in a few moments<br />
and a few years ago he called you names. What are you going<br />
to talk about with him.<br />
PM: Essentially I will talking about Australia's desire and<br />
intention to involve itself in the bicentenary celebrations<br />
of the French Revolution. We intend to make significant<br />
contributions and not only because we want to, but also in<br />
part to repay the extraordinarily generous involvement by,<br />
and contribution by, the Government and people of France in<br />
our bicentenary celebrations which we held in 1988, and to<br />
thank Monsieur Chirac because a considerable part of those<br />
arrangements of course were put in place under his<br />
administration. JOURNALIST: Mr Chirac can be even more direct and impolite<br />
than me Prime Minister, won't that cloud your discussions in<br />
the things he said in the past?<br />
PM: I assume that our meeting will be civil as far as the<br />
past is concerned. As I've said before bitterness, like<br />
jealousy, is amongst the most corrosive of human emotions<br />
and is not one in which I engage.<br />
