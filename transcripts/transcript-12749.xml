<p>E&amp;OE……………………………………………………………………………………</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what's your view on the MUA dispute in America?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think the union in this instance is acting against Australian interests. We were told at the weekend by Simon Crean that unions now have less influence over the Labor Party. Let him demonstrate that by denouncing, as I have, what the MUA is doing. These are Australian national interests. This is not the union movement, this is Australia that's involved and what the union is doing is giving aid and comfort to unionists in America who are doing damage to Australian exports. Now, there's a clear national interest involved and the Leader of the Opposition should denounce what the MUA is doing, unconditionally.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Of course the MUA says it’s not a…the Federal Government shouldn't be intervening at all, that you have no right to intervene in this dispute?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have a right to speak up, indeed we have a duty to speak up for Australia, so does the Leader of the Opposition. Let him speak up for Australia's national interests, let him denounce what the MUA is doing.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What do you think of the speculation [inaudible] from the paper this morning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What's the next question?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How was the walk?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I’m used to walking. I've got to go and chair a Cabinet meeting now. I tossed up but…felt like going on, but I think Allan Border's doing a great job. I think it's a great cause and very inspirational. He's been inspired by what his friend Ian Botham did when he walked from one end of England to the other and although…I mean Australia's a much bigger country - walking from Sydney to Brisbane is a very tall order. But he'll do it and good luck to him and he'll get a lot of support from his sporting mates and from the Australian public and I admire him very much.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you reckon you could have made it to Brisbane with him?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I've got a few other things, so I won't test my luck. He's younger and fitter than I am.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what assurances can you give doctors this morning ahead of today's Cabinet meeting into public liability?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'll be having something to say on that issue very shortly. We have worked very hard to produce a package that is fair to the doctors, also fair to patients, and fair to the community. We have not only provided guarantees, but we've been prepared to put money in and to work with the profession. I understand the concern of doctors, particularly the obstetricians and the neurologists and those with the very high risk profile, and we do have to do something about that, and we are doing something about it, and we want to work with everybody in trying to achieve a sensible outcome. Thank you.</p>
