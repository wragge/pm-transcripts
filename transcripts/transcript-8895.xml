TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS, RADIO 2UE, SYDNEY, 17 JUNE 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
JL: With me in the studio the Prime Minister of Australia. Good morning and<br />
welcome.<br />
PM: Good morning John.<br />
JL: There was fog in Canberra was there?<br />
PM: Yes, we darted through it.<br />
JL: So long as it was safe.<br />
PM: Yes, it is easier to get off the ground than get back down.<br />
JL That's right, wintery mornings are not much fun in Canberra. A wintery<br />
morning right around Australia and a lot of people feeling a little chilled<br />
by the Mabo decision and I think somehow a lot of people are getting it<br />
out of proportion. Do you think that is right?<br />
PM: Yes I think so. This is a reasonably complex issue and a complex legal<br />
judgement, it is something the High Court took a better part of a decade<br />
in deciding and it is a milestone decision and one which I think gives<br />
Australia a tremendous opportunity to get its relationship with the<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait people right.<br />
JL Can you understand the white population of Australia and there are an<br />
awful lot of them finding it difficult to come to terms with the fact that the<br />
Aboriginal people will be compensated in their minds. Now whether this<br />
is fact or not time will tell and it might take a long time, but the Aboriginal<br />
people will be compensated, that they will receive more money, stories<br />
being told that 1.5 per cent of the population has 15 per cent of the land<br />
mass of Australia. I don't think the people who made those statements </p>
<p>2<br />
bothered to have a look at the quality of the land mass that they had, but<br />
these are alarmist statements that are being made and cause concern<br />
amongst the public. Do you understand the concern?<br />
PM: Yes, I can see people thinking that in some way Aboriginal people have<br />
been treated in a preferential way, but that is not true. In many countries<br />
these issues, judgements have been made by governments and by<br />
supreme courts and of course just across the Tasman in New Zealand<br />
there was a treaty of settlement, the treaty-of Waitangi.<br />
JL Which is still in place.<br />
PM: Which is still in place. Now, there was no -treaty in Australia. Aboriginal<br />
Australians were dispossessed of the land and what this decision says<br />
and it is fairly simple really, it says that where continuing association<br />
with the land can be established a native title may exist.<br />
J L: Yes, but there is the rub, continuing association. Now if you slip that set<br />
of headphones on there in order that you can listen to the people who<br />
are going to call in that want to talk to you because I see it as being very<br />
important as some people do have what I believe to be an incorrect point<br />
of view on the subject of Mabo. Over the week and a bit that I have<br />
been back I have done my best to explain it as I see it in light of the<br />
Court ruling, as clearly and without hysteria, but still some hysteria<br />
exists and a lot of Australians would like to talk to the Prime Minister.<br />
Here is your opportunity. Hello.<br />
C: I don't know whether I arn limited to a question or not Mr Keating, but I<br />
find this, that your term of Mabo, you are creating concerns by using an<br />
interpretation of a judgement. So, right on, having said that, I will say<br />
this to you, the claims that are being made at the are not going to<br />
mention Mabo is being ridiculed by the Aboriginal Affairs Minister, and<br />
you have not made a public comment on such claims. Do you agree<br />
with Mr Tickner?<br />
PM: Oh yes, I have made public comments about them. These claims have<br />
got nothing to do with Mabo. These are some of these silly claims of<br />
NSW.<br />
C: I have already agreed with you that in my opinion they have got nothing<br />
to do with Mabo. I am talking, do you agree, that it is a total waste of<br />
public funds making these futile claims?<br />
PMV: Absolutely. But it is not public funds that are being wasted because I<br />
don't think the claims will stand at all.<br />
C: Well who prepares the claims? Isn't the ALS and Mr Coe and a few<br />
solicitors and a few barristers and all this getting involved in this? </p>
<p>PM: That may be true.<br />
C: Well where is that money coming from<br />
PM: Well let's understand this point, the claims haven't got a snowballs<br />
chance in hell of succeeding. They have got nothing to do with Mabo,<br />
nothing whatsoever.<br />
C: Never mind about Mabo, why are you allowing the total waste of tax<br />
payers funds on these futile claims?<br />
PM: You could say the sarme thing for legal aid for non-aboriginal<br />
Australians? Why should we allow legal aid for non-aboriginal<br />
Australians for what you may call futile claims?<br />
C: That cry baby act has gone down the drain a long time ago.<br />
PM: No its not. It's there now.<br />
C: You are making the..<br />
PM: What's your point?<br />
C: The point is this, that you are as boss of this country you are allowing a<br />
total waste of funds under the guise of Mabo.<br />
PM: It has got nothing to do with Mabo, nothing whatsoever.<br />
C: OK good. Now do you want another question?<br />
PM: No, you asked me about this, I am not here basically to soak up all your<br />
prejudices, I am here to answer a few questions about Mabo.<br />
JL: Ok, but let's just clarify this. The point that you have made to the Prime<br />
Minister is that you believe that he is allowing public funds to be wasted<br />
in the form of claims through the Aboriginal legal services that as he<br />
said, don't have a snowflakes chance in hell of succeeding, his reply to<br />
that, which wasn't a bad one was if the white people of Australia are<br />
permitted to have legal aid, which they are, is it not fair and reasonable<br />
that the Aboriginal people should also have legal aid?<br />
C: But we are not allowed to have legal aid for that.<br />
JL: Well aren't we, I don't know? </p>
<p>PM: You can have legal aid for your particular pet obsession if you wish, and<br />
it may have justice and it may not, just as Aboriginal claims may have<br />
justice.<br />
C: I can't afford to even walk into the solicitors office.<br />
PM: Well you may qualify for legal aid if you had a matter of substance, thats<br />
the point.<br />
C: Don't try and con this whole business of putting it on to what the whites<br />
can get. The whites have been held back, I am not arguing about the<br />
racial side of this business, I am arguing on the hysteria that you and<br />
your Government and the Aboriginal Affairs have caused.<br />
PM: Now, hang on. Just understand this point, this is a decision of the High<br />
Court of the Australia, our most supreme national court. This is not a<br />
matter which has been initiated by the Government at all, it is something<br />
which the Government has to respond to, to put an administrative<br />
framework and a framework in law into place so as to hear and dispense<br />
native title.<br />
C: I have heard you make these claims before, but I point out that this<br />
judgement is regarding the Murray Island people and the State of<br />
Queensland. It did not say, well listen, now, we are going to make this<br />
all applicable to the mainlanders people.<br />
PM: I think you fail to understand what the decision means.<br />
JL: Apart from that it would have set a precedent, but you are not<br />
understanding what the decision means.<br />
C: But Mr Keating is trying to have a settlement out of court, put it that way.<br />
PM: No we are not. We are not trying to do anything of the kind.<br />
C: Well what are you talking about, compensation?<br />
PM: What is your beet? I mean don't you think that Aboriginal Australians<br />
are entitled to any land that was theirs?<br />
C: Of course they are, they should be treated the same as everyone else.<br />
PM: Well ok then, what's your problem?<br />
C: I have to buy my land, why can't they buy theirs? But forget about that<br />
racial business. </p>
<p>JL Hang on, lets get an answer to that question, you had to buy your land,<br />
why can't they buy theirs? What's the Prime Minister got to say to that?<br />
PM: Well if there had been a treaty here In* 1 788 then the thing Is may be that<br />
the crown might have bought its land.<br />
C: There couldn't be a treaty, Mr Keating, you know that, because there<br />
was too many tribes and clans and whatever.<br />
PM: Well thank you for your anthropological advice.<br />
C: Well that's in history, I am not talking about history.<br />
PM: I think you're talking prejudice, mostly, aren't you? That's what you are<br />
really talking. You don't want to see Aboriginal Australians have any<br />
right to the land. It grates on you that they have a decision here, which<br />
is a decision in justice which you then want to focus on crazy land<br />
claims that have nothing to do with it to try and diminish its standing.<br />
That's what you're about.<br />
C: I am not making the claims, the Aboriginals are.<br />
PM: I think you have had a fair enough go, I understand your point. But let<br />
me just finalise this. The claims over NSW have got nothing to do with<br />
Mabo, nothing whatsoever.<br />
JL: But the point is it is a point of aggravation to the average Australian to<br />
see monies, which they believe to be their monies, that are provided to<br />
the Aboriginal legal services being spent on claims that are futile and<br />
alarmist.<br />
PM: Well some may be.<br />
JL: Well its pretty alarmist to hear that they want two thirds of NSW.<br />
PM: I know, but I don't think that the serious people who basically are<br />
involved in this issue on the Aboriginal side of things are supporting<br />
these things and they have said so. Therefore that will mean in the end<br />
there will not be big cases and long expenses.<br />
JL: Yes, but I am simply asking you do you understand that if the people<br />
aren't equip with the knowledge, and the people are not equipped, you<br />
can hear by the first call that they are not equipped with the knowledge,<br />
but if they don't have the understanding that they are going to panic.<br />
PM: Well, John, it is probably worth telling people just to make this point that<br />
native title is a title subordinate to the crown. That is, where freehold or </p>
<p>leasehold has been dispensed in the past the High Court has held that<br />
the native -title has been extinguished.<br />
JL: Gone.<br />
PM: So if you take Sydney, the suburbs of Sydney, the settled areas, the<br />
freehold areas of rural NSW, QLD, WA et cetera, the native title is<br />
extinguished.<br />
J L: But can it ever be restored?<br />
PM: No, it can't be restored where it is extinguished.<br />
JL: You see that is the question being asked by many. It might have been<br />
extinguished by freehold title, can it ever be restored, the answer is no.<br />
PM: No.<br />
JL: What about leasehold land?<br />
PM: No. Leasehold to, accept for titles from 1975 onwards, which have been<br />
invalidly issued, some invalidly issued. This is one of the questions we<br />
discussed at the Premiers Conference last week and that was that some<br />
leasehold, pastoral leasehold comes in say 30 and 40 year leases. So,<br />
let's say a family has been on a piece of land for 60 years and then its<br />
lease expires and it applies for another 30 years does the native title<br />
take over? Well the view I put at the Council of Australian Governments<br />
is we would regard that land, that leasehold, in that case to have<br />
extinguished the native title.<br />
JL: And it would continue. So people who have had leases on pastoral<br />
property for generation after generation?<br />
PM: It would continue. So the technicality of the lease expiring after say<br />
years.<br />
JL: How much land does involve itself in the Mabo decision?<br />
PM: I think quite a lot of the unalienated crown land of the country. But again<br />
this is mostly in OLD, WA and some of it in NSW. But as you know you<br />
have got to drive a long way through this State through the freehold titles<br />
of the farming community before you get to large tracts of unalienated<br />
crown land. So, you are talking about a hinterland of NSW.<br />
JL: Now, if the Aboriginal people can reclaim possession of that unoccupied<br />
crown land, that unused crown land, does that mean then that the white<br />
population of Australia can be forbidden to enter that land? </p>
<p>PM: I don't think so.<br />
JL It wouldn't be much good if that were the case, would it?<br />
PM: Native title has factors about it other than possession of land as we<br />
know it. The Aboriginal association with land is not the association or<br />
understanding of land as non-aboiginal Australians know it. And<br />
remember this, John, the native title can't be sold, it can't be sold to you<br />
or me, it can only revert back to the Crown.<br />
JL: Ok, now we must take another call, because that was the idea to let the<br />
people of Australia talk to you directly so that they would have a better<br />
understanding of the problem. Hello.<br />
C: Good morning.<br />
JL: OK, the Prime Minister is here.<br />
C: My question to the Prime Minister, I would like to actually ask him quite<br />
a few questions on Mabo, but just a very broad question, Mr Keating,<br />
why does your Government see the Aboriginal people as a much more<br />
equal people then the average white Australian?<br />
PM: We don't. We see them as equal.<br />
C: Well you might say that, but all the indications are that you don't.<br />
PM: But I think it was implied in your question that you don't. You think that<br />
non-aboriginal Australians there ought to be discrimination in their<br />
favour against blacks.<br />
C: Not whatsoever. I don't see that at all. But myself and every person I<br />
talk to, I am not racist, every person I talk to..<br />
PM: That's what they all say, don't they? They put these questions, they<br />
always say, I am not racist, but, you know " I don't believe that Aboriginal<br />
Australians ought to have a basis in equality with non aboriginal<br />
Australians". Well of course that is part of the problem.<br />
C: Aren't they more equal than us at the moment with the preferences they<br />
get?<br />
PM: It is not for me to be giving you a history lesson, they were largely<br />
dispossessed of the land they held.<br />
C: I think there is a question over that. I think a lot of people would tell you<br />
that. You are telling us one thing and expecting us to believe it. </p>
<p>PM: Well if you are sitting on the title of any block of land in NSW you can<br />
bet an Aboriginal person at some stage was dispossessed of it.<br />
C: You know that for sure, do you?<br />
PM: Well of course we know it for sure.<br />
C: Yeah. Well going on to your last caller there I think he had some<br />
pertinent things to say that you couldn't answer either.<br />
PM: Yeah I know but you hold his view, don't you?<br />
C: Of course I do.<br />
PM: That's part of the problem.<br />
JL: Let's clarify the view. What is the view?<br />
C: My question in general, I mean is with regard just to the whole aboriginal<br />
question is why does the average white Australian feel that he is<br />
prejudiced against? Why? Because of the things your Government<br />
does.<br />
PM: Like what?<br />
C: The preferential treatment.<br />
PM: Are you challenging the High Court decision? Are you saying that the<br />
High Court has got this all wrong?<br />
C: No, I am not saying that at all. I wouldn't know who was on the High<br />
Court.<br />
PM: Well why don't you sign off, if you don't know anything about it and<br />
you're not interested, good bye. You can't challenge these things and<br />
then say, I don't know about them.<br />
JL: Well he's gone. But you see sadly what you are hearing there is in<br />
some ways very typical of the feeling that exists and it may be a very<br />
unhealthy feeling but it exists there. What do you do to placate those<br />
people who feel that strongly, and they do feel, I talk to them every day,<br />
they do feel that they are being disadvantaged by what is being given to<br />
the aboriginal people.<br />
PM: Well what is being given to the aboriginal people is at this stage limited<br />
land, let's say before the Mabo judgement, limited land opportunities and<br />
some income support and social justice in education and in health, so<br />
there are Commonwealth programs for health and social justice to deal </p>
<p>with such things as diseases which particularly afflicted Aboriginal<br />
people, like glaucoma of the eyes, and infant mortality and all these<br />
other piroblems; they had we have tried to direct funding to deal with<br />
those problems, to extend educational opportuniies to Aboriginal<br />
people.<br />
JL: I have always endeavoured to explain it in this fashion. That equality is<br />
what is required, equality in the eyes of the law and equality in<br />
opportunity. But in order for Aboriginal people to have equal opportunity<br />
some extra funding is required at certain stages, in certain areas,<br />
education being one, health being another. Is that true, or not true?<br />
PM: That's right. And also in some cases income support because often<br />
where Aboriginal people live there isn't the opportunities, and not often<br />
the opportunities that existed some time ago for employment arnd so<br />
some of the spending programs of the Commonwealth actually provide<br />
work opportunities for Aboriginal people. That's by and large the remit of<br />
Commonwealth programs and spending to date. Now that money is<br />
administered by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.<br />
But Mabo is a different thing. Mabo is about saying, the High Court is<br />
saying, that native title survived the acquisition of sovereignty by the<br />
crown.<br />
J L: Ok, but the point to remember, and the point that the people need to<br />
remember is that that High Court ruling is extinguished by the<br />
possession of-freehold title and leasehold title.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JL: And it can't be reignited.<br />
PM: I will read you the two points. I think these are the two key points of the<br />
Mason, Chief Justice, Brennan Dean, Gaudron and McHugh,<br />
Native Title for land survived the Crowns acquisition of sovereignty and<br />
radical title. And then they go on to say that by Mason, Brennan and<br />
McHugh that the title to the Meriam people is subject to the power of the<br />
Parliament of Queensland and the power of the Governor and Council of<br />
Queensland to extinguish that title by valid exercise of their respective<br />
powers providing any exercise of those powers is not inconsistent with<br />
the laws of the Commonwealth. In other words where ever a State<br />
issues a title it extinguishes the native title. It has the power.<br />
J L: Is it true that you could simply overthrow the whole thing?<br />
PM: No. Because if a State sought to say it would turn all, say Crown land,<br />
into freehold, you could only do that under the Constitution on just terms.<br />
JL: So they would have to be recompensed? </p>
<p>PM: So if there were Native Title subsequently established the State which<br />
extinguished the crown land in favour of a freehold title and thus<br />
extinguishing the native title would need to pay just terms, and that could<br />
be very expensive.<br />
JL: Ok and those just terms would be decided, I presume, by the High<br />
Court?<br />
PM: They would probably end up in the High Court.<br />
J L: So we would be right back where we started?<br />
IPM: Well from a States point of view with a very large bill. See, John, can I<br />
just say this what the Commonwealth is seeking to do, what we want<br />
from this is basically this, the High Court has made that decision and the<br />
things which we are requiring of these things, recognition of native title<br />
as a legal reality and therefore bringing the land management laws of<br />
the various States up accordingly. Native Title to be treated in a nondiscriminatory<br />
way on a par with anyone else's land. That Native title<br />
which has survived, that is, which has survived all of these grants of<br />
interest in land is not now unnecessarily wiped out and that we set up a<br />
process, a tribunal for finding out who has native title and where it is.<br />
And that the widest issues such as dispossession and social justice also<br />
be addressed. Now, they are a totally reasonable set of propositions,<br />
that native title is now a legal reality and must be addressed, land laws<br />
must be adjusted, native title should be treated in a non-discri minatory<br />
way, that which has survived shouldn't now be wiped out, and tribunals<br />
should be established to hear and award native title. In other words<br />
what the Commonwealth Govemnment is seeking to do is to develop a<br />
legal framework, an administrative framework to put the Mabo High<br />
Court judgement into effect.<br />
JL: Okay, well lets see what other listeners think about it. Hello.<br />
C: Hello, I would just like to say to Mr Keating that all these people ringing<br />
up saying your trying to blame him for it. It is not his fault. The High<br />
Court has made this decision and he has just got to implement what<br />
they have decided for him. He can't say, well we aren't going to do this,<br />
you know, people have got to be calm and understand what the High<br />
Court has done. They have got to accept that that is the way life is<br />
going to be now.<br />
PM: Can I just say this as well, it doesn't in any way interfere with a title<br />
anyone in this country currently holds. So people have had fears about<br />
their farm at West Wyalong or Bathurst or something..<br />
JL Where are you calling from? </p>
<p>C: On the North Coast.<br />
JL Okay, well people have had fears there too.<br />
PM: Well I mean, those fears are groundless, that is that there is no threat to<br />
their title at all. This is basically about that which is left. This is the<br />
urialienated crown land which has not been extinguished by former and<br />
earlier grants of interest in land by state land manager, you know, State<br />
departments of lands, etc.<br />
JL~ Okay, so you wanted to tell the Prime Minister it is not his fault, you've<br />
told him.<br />
C: I can't understand why everybody is giving him a hard time about.<br />
PM: Prime Ministers get hard times, that I don't mind, but I<br />
C: It is not that. But I think they are sort of taking it up with the wrong<br />
people if they don't agree with it. I mean, you're the one who is in<br />
charge of the country but you didn't make the decision, you'e just got to<br />
try and explain to everybody. People don't want to understand it.<br />
JL Well people prefer to listen to their hysterical point of view because it<br />
gives them a sharper axe to grind.<br />
C: Exactly.<br />
PM: Anyway, you are tolerant about it. And that is the important thing and I<br />
thank you for that.<br />
JL: Okay and thanks for the call too. Another thing we must also establish,<br />
when you say it only applies to the unoccupied land that exists in this<br />
country. But surely it doesn't apply to all of that. It can only apply, my<br />
reading of it, it can only apply if a continuing ongoing association with<br />
that land can be proved.<br />
PM: Exactly, that is why, you see Mabo, even its fullest expression, will only<br />
give to a minority of the Aboriginal community land because many of<br />
them were dispossessed of the land and therefore can't make a claim.<br />
J L: Will it give them land or will it give them compensation as well, will it<br />
give them money as well?<br />
PM: No. In the first instance it would give them land. It would only give them<br />
compensation if someone wanted to put an economic use on the land,<br />
mining or something else. </p>
<p>J L: But they would not get royalties for mining?<br />
PM: No. Because the minerals under the land would be reserved to the<br />
Crown as they are for non-Aboriginal Australians. You will find on your<br />
title of your home, block of land, that minerals on the thing are reserved<br />
to the Crown.<br />
JU: Yeah, so the same would apply to native titles?<br />
PM: The same applies to native titles. That is, that if somebody can<br />
establish the fact that or a community of Aboriginals that they have lived<br />
in a region and have had a continuing association with the land and they<br />
are rewarded a native title, any compensation they are paid is paid in<br />
relation to the disturbance and inconvenience which would come from<br />
an economic use. Can I say, John, just as a farmer who might have<br />
2000 acres out in Bathurst or something and someone finds an alluvial<br />
gold deposit on it or wants to do something else with it, pays to that<br />
person compensation for digging a hole in the land, driving across the<br />
land, putting it to some economic use.<br />
JL: Well can we look at that conversely. Lets say the other side of Bourke,<br />
a group of Aboriginal people can say that they had an ongoing claim to<br />
some land there. And running right through the middle of this piece of<br />
land is a beautiful bitumen road paid for by the taxpayers of Australia. In<br />
turn, will the Aboriginal people have to compensate us for the<br />
improvements made to the land?<br />
PM: No, they won't because they wouldn't want the road probably in the first<br />
place, but it is not their road. Because the road will have a title to it, you<br />
understand, it will be an easement.<br />
JL: Okay, so do all roads have titles?<br />
PM: Yes, they will have an easement title. Not all roads, some will be just<br />
dusty roads and they may well be on Aboriginal land.<br />
JL: But what happens if they are stock routes and the Aboriginal people say<br />
which would be their right if they were to enjoy equal title along with<br />
freehold title the same title as we all enjoy, what would happen if the<br />
Aboriginal people said, okay well I'm sorry this is our land and the road<br />
is closed?<br />
PM: Well the stock routes are mostly already reserved if we look at any of<br />
these maps where you see the titles expressed in various..<br />
J L: See these are the things that are worrying people. </p>
<p>PM: Well they are mostly reserved already. So what you call a stock route<br />
where people actually use it to drive stock over vast distances are<br />
reserved. So that is really not a problem but one of the points I would<br />
like to make here John, and one I mentioned a moment ago, that Is<br />
probably the great majority of Aboriginal people will not benefit from<br />
Mabo at all because having been pushed off their land and<br />
dispossessed of it they can't now make a claim to a continuing<br />
association with it.<br />
JL: And that is important? So in other words, there can't be a mob of people<br />
in Redfern who have lived there for 20 years who suddenly say, my<br />
mum came from the Kimberleys and I'm going back there and the land is<br />
mine?<br />
PM: No. Because they might have been pushed off it many years earlier.<br />
There is a couple of things the High Court has said about this which I<br />
think, were also part of the decision, let me read it.<br />
JL: Is it in High Court jargon because that is difficult to understand?<br />
PM: No. It is very easy to read. Aboriginals were dispossessed of their land<br />
parcel by parcel to make way for expanding colonial settlement. Their<br />
dispossession underwrote the development of the nation and the acts<br />
and events by which that dispossession in legal theory was carried into<br />
practical effect constitute the darkest aspect of the history of this nation.<br />
The nation as a whole must remain diminished and unless until there is<br />
acknowledgment of and retreat from these past injustices. Now the first<br />
sentence says, Aboriginals were dispossessed of their land parcel by<br />
parcel to make way for expanding colonial settlement. Now that means<br />
if they were dispossessed they can't now apply under Mabo so there is<br />
sort of an inherent injustice about the way in which Mabo will now in the<br />
latter part of the 20th century apply. That it will only apply to those who<br />
were not dispossessed of the land. But for those who were<br />
dispossessed there is nothing in it for them. And that is why at the<br />
Council of Australian Govemnments Meeting I talked about a package for<br />
land acquisition for dispossessed people who can't get anything from<br />
Mabo.<br />
JL: And these people would be in the minority?<br />
PM: No. I think the people who will be awarded grants of interest in land say<br />
as a native title will be in the minority. That is, the majority of Aboriginal<br />
people probably won't get anything from Mabo.<br />
J L: Hello?<br />
C Hello. </p>
<p>JL Where are you calling from?<br />
C: I'm calling from North Queensland. Mr Laws said a while ago there<br />
about the back of Bourke about a bit of land, well I actually come from<br />
the back of Bourke I was born there in 1950 and was reared up there<br />
and I recently went back for a reunion and I tell you what, to walk into<br />
that pound and see Bourke NSW today and what it was in 1963-68<br />
when I left, it was a crying shame. Your cameras don't go down the<br />
street, you don't tell the truth, you don't take photos, you get there and<br />
you cut everything out and then you put it on A Current Affair and<br />
Minutes, but you don't tell the truth to Australia.<br />
JL: Who doesn't?<br />
C: The lot of you. 60 Minutes, bloody Current Affair.<br />
JL: Hold on, I'm not yet responsible for 60 Minutes or A Cur-rent Affair. What<br />
do you want to do, you want to unveil the truth to us, do you?<br />
C: The whole of the main street of Bourke is mesh and tin roller doors.<br />
JL: I know that.<br />
C: You can't walk up there after dark.<br />
JL: Well Wilcannia is the same I know that.<br />
C: Wilcannia is the same Brewarrina is the same, Cunnamulla.<br />
JL: I know all of that.<br />
C: Mate I can take you to a lot of places.<br />
JL: Okay, so what is the point you want to make to the Prime Minister.<br />
C: Well the point is how much Aboriginal have you got to have in you to<br />
class yourself as an Aboriginal?<br />
JL That is a convoluted question and really has nothing to do with Mabo. I<br />
think you were on for a bit of a bitch about things in general, perhaps<br />
you and I can cover that subject alone at some other time. Hello?<br />
C: Hello. I would just like to say I'm of white descent. I think I have been<br />
lucky to be bom here. We have got good education and everything.<br />
This history of our country can't be changed and we have got good<br />
opportunity for education and everything as has those of black descent.<br />
And wouldn't it be good if when we are all older if we could all look </p>
<p>around and say that we have got what we've got through hard work, not<br />
through court case?<br />
JU Well the point you are making there Is what? You don't believe the<br />
Aboriginal people would get what they have got through hard work?<br />
C: No it is not that at all. It Is just that Isn't it time that we just looked<br />
forward rather than the Aboriginals going for this...<br />
PM: Well can I just say, the thing to look forward to is a country which is in its<br />
soul at peace with itself. That is not prospering in including the<br />
dispossession of another people and that is the point of the High Court<br />
decision, that is the point of the reference I just read about the<br />
dispossession injustice. I mean, we are a unique country now, this is a<br />
multicultural country it has changed enormously since the war. It has<br />
tremendous opportunities, it is an island continent, we are the only<br />
nation in the world that has a continent to itself, we don't share a border<br />
with anybody, we are located in the fastest growing part of the world.<br />
We have the natural protection of the sea. There are great opportunities<br />
here. But to go forward together as a people means we have to go<br />
forward together on terms on which we all agree. And to have the<br />
original inhabitants not agreeing, saying that they were dispossessed<br />
and largely disadvantaged means we will never do that completely.<br />
Now that is why the Mabo decision is an opportunity. It is an opportunity<br />
to deal very late in the piece, but better late than never, with the injustice<br />
of Aboriginal dispossession. And that is what it is about. But it doesn't<br />
threaten, see the point about it is that it doesn't threaten anyone else's<br />
property in these areas of Australia we are talking about, but what it<br />
does, it brings up on a basis of equality the opportunity of the original<br />
inhabitants to have a piece of the country themselves.<br />
J L: Okay, I think that answers that, but tell me this, if the original inhabitants<br />
were given back a piece of what the High Court said was theirs and<br />
there is no denying the High Court ruling simply says that native title did<br />
exist, now if this is given back to the people that had it originally, will<br />
they then be given an opportunity to work that land as the people who<br />
are non-Aboriginal work that land? Will they then be given an<br />
opportunity to do what the people have done who bought their land<br />
freehold and paid cold hard cash for it, will they then be given an<br />
opportunity to become self supportive? Or will they be given the land<br />
and continue to be supported to the tune of more than $ 1 billion a year?<br />
PM: Well they can be given the land and I hope in some cases, operate the<br />
land in a way which is economic and provides employment and<br />
opportunities for them. But the whole notion of Aboriginal association to<br />
the land is a spiritual association, it is not an economic association as<br />
we understand land and the value of land. </p>
<p>JL: It is very hard for people to understand that though?<br />
PM: I know, it is not a concept which I think non-Aboriginal Australians grasp<br />
eswily but it Is a religious association there which goes more to working<br />
out what the dollars and cents are on 30 June. It Is the actual spiritual<br />
association. I think that is the important point. I think it Is one of the<br />
reasons why Aboriginal people have felt dispossessed.<br />
JL: But if the land is given back to the people, even though they may be a<br />
minority and I get the impression that very few Aboriginal people or<br />
tribes are going to benefit by it in the long run, how then do you explain<br />
to the non-Aboriginal population that make up about 98 per cent of the<br />
place, most of them taxpayers, how do you explain to them that their tax<br />
dollar still goes to the tune of about $ 1 billion a year to help Aboriginal<br />
people?<br />
PM: Because the people it is helping are those that would never benefit often<br />
from a Mabo claim, and even in the event that they do, they still have<br />
these problems in health and in education and in lack of access to<br />
opportunities which we have sought to remedy by Commonwealth<br />
funding over the years. And we are still only just, in a sense, marking<br />
time. We probably made some progress, we've made some progress in<br />
health but not as much as we should make I don't think, the same in<br />
education. And that is why that funding will always remain important. I<br />
think there is a great gulf in the opportunities which are available to<br />
Aboriginal Australians and..<br />
J L: And white Australians. But it needs to be explained to the people<br />
because that is the bit of coating on the pill.<br />
PM: Well I don't think it is bitter. I don't think Australians mind that in their<br />
budgets that they do deal with problems such as Aboriginal malnutrition<br />
and infant mortality and educational opportunities. And you notice with<br />
the Royal Commission into the Deaths in Custody, a lot of the problems<br />
flowing from that come from the problem of lack of opportunity, lack of<br />
education.<br />
J L: Lack of equal opportunity.<br />
PM: Lack of equal opportunity and so the nation tries to even that up through<br />
these funding programs. Now Mabo is a different concept altogether but<br />
you see, John, if Mabo meant that a claim over Circular Quay in Sydney<br />
or George Street had any strength about it then people would have<br />
genuine concerns about their rights to interest in land and their wealth.<br />
But this decision applies to those places where a title has not been<br />
issued and only if there is a continuing association. </p>
<p>J L: See, that is the important point, and that is the point nobody wants to<br />
hear. The continuing association has to be proof of the land. So, again<br />
let me say It, I've said it a hundred times, there can't be a bunch of<br />
people In Redfern suddenly say I want all the land west of Bourke ' cause<br />
my grandmother was there because they can't prove an ongoing<br />
continuing association. And all of it is going to taeyar anyway.<br />
PM: It is going to take years. And the other thing is the State government<br />
can extinguish the native title where it suits it. For instance, if they<br />
wanted to acquire your property or my property for a reason, for a<br />
school, for a bridge, for a road, for a park, then you can be notified by a<br />
State Minister, you can have discussions about the acquisition, but in<br />
the end the State has the power to resume the land and to change its<br />
title, it will then give you compensation, but you get, in the final analysis,<br />
little say in it and if you want to challenge the decision you can go off to<br />
the Land and Environment Court. Now in the same way, they can do<br />
the same with native title. And that is, again the High Court has made<br />
that quite clear, that is that a State still has the sovereignty to extinguish<br />
a native title particularly for public purposes.<br />
JL: But they must be compensated as we would be compensated.<br />
PM: As we would be compensated, that is it.<br />
JL: Hello?<br />
C: Hello, I want to talk about Aboriginal land rights.<br />
JL: Okay, are you Aboriginal?<br />
C: Yeah I'm Aboriginal. I come from Kintook west of Alice Springs.<br />
JL: What do you want to say to the Prime Minister?<br />
C: I want to say that the Land Right Act has not helped Aboriginal people it<br />
only helps land councils. We started Kintook communities in Perth and<br />
we run a business and the land council came along and forced us to<br />
close our door.<br />
JL: The Aboriginal Land Council?<br />
C: Yes, the land council in Northern Territory.<br />
JL: I see, well how could they force you to close the store?<br />
C: They told me to close my store and at that time I said to them that I was<br />
a traditional land owner but they ignored what I said to them. </p>
<p>JL What you are telling is hardly associated directly with Mabo.<br />
PM: I'm happy to pick up the point though. Look, there is no doubt that in<br />
some places there Is conflict In terms of the view of particular people in<br />
areas and the land councils. Now in the Northern Territory we have<br />
what is called statutory land rights. Land has been given to Aboriginal<br />
people not by way of the common law for which the High Court<br />
envisages with Mabo but by way of a law of the parliaments of the<br />
Commonwealth and the Northern Territory. In other words, a gift of land<br />
from the pariaments of the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory.<br />
Now how that land, the ownership and use of that land, has largely<br />
devolved to decisions by Aboriginal Land Councils. Now these are often<br />
at odds with the views of some of the people who live in some of these<br />
regions. But again, if you ask the Aboriginal people as a people do they<br />
feel that, if you like, there is a sort of enhanced empowerment to<br />
Aboriginal people through land councils I think the answer will be in the<br />
affirmative. They would say yes to that. Whereas, if their power is<br />
fragmented over individuals and groups of individuals who can't run a set<br />
of accounts, who can't manage these properties, and who can't basically<br />
receive the proceeds or dividends that may flow from them, and who<br />
can't represent themselves well enough in particular situations where<br />
land is being allocated that the land council does that for them. Now,<br />
this is at this stage you are not talking about Mabo, you are talking about<br />
Aboriginal land rights in the Northern Territory, we are not seeking at this<br />
stage to say everything is happy in the garden between all Aboriginal<br />
people and the land councils, of course, it isn't. But again, on balance,<br />
are Aboriginal people better off with a land council system? and I think<br />
most Aboriginal people think they are.<br />
JL Okay madam does that cover it for you?<br />
C: No.<br />
JL: I didn't think it would but I'm afraid it is going to have to because we will<br />
spend too long on the subject and what the Prime Minister said I think is<br />
understandable. Most of us, not everybody is happy with the<br />
arrangement with the Aboriginal Land Councils, but the majority are.<br />
Hello?<br />
C: Good morning John, good momning PM, it is Paul Vanetti, cartoonist here<br />
mate how are you?<br />
PM: Good thank you.<br />
C: I've just been up to Queensland and Northern NSW. I'm now<br />
syndicating my cartoons right throughout Australia so I thought I would<br />
get out there and have a look at some of the places that I'm sending<br />
cartoons to and the enormous fear that is out there. I would be talking to </p>
<p>people in pubs and just meeting editors and the fear that is out there is<br />
just unbelievable. I have never dealt with an issue a topic.<br />
JU Yeah well there is going to be fear if-people listen to nonsense and<br />
people, now let me just say this to you, you will find many people find it<br />
very easy to dislike Aboriginal people that is their prerogative to like or<br />
dislike and if they get and opportunity to throw a lite more mud than<br />
they have already thrown they leap upon that opportunity. Now if<br />
hysterical comment is going to be made concerning Mabo it will be<br />
grabbed by other hysterical people who are looking, again, for another<br />
reason to be critical of Aboriginal people. And I haven't always spoken<br />
in favour of the Aboriginal people but you better start to tell people that it<br />
is about time to start being a bit realistic about Mabo and not using it as<br />
a hammer to belt Aboriginal people around the head or the Government<br />
around the head because neither of them are directly responsible for<br />
what the High Court said.<br />
C: That is right, the point that I want to make here is that in politics, in<br />
anything, you are really dealing with perceptions and I hope the Prime<br />
Minister understands that and perception is everything. I deal with it<br />
every day. It is similar to, I guess we could make a comparison with the<br />
GST thing during the election, and people are saying to me that this will<br />
be the Prime Minister's GST.<br />
PM: But look, why say things like that, and what have people got to be fearful<br />
about. This is land on which there is no title, which is not alienated from<br />
the Crown, so it is Crown land on which a claim for native title can be<br />
heard providing it can be established as a continuing association with<br />
the land. Now what have people got to be fearful about of? They<br />
haven't got to be fearful about land under their hotel or the main street or<br />
the shops or the farms around, what have they got to be fearful of?<br />
C: Well I think that is the point that we have got to get across.<br />
JL: That is the point that we are getting across, that is exactly why the<br />
Prime Minister is here.<br />
PM: That is the key point, the fact is this, what am I to do, the High Court, our<br />
most supreme national court has made a decision saying that native title<br />
survived the acquisition of sovereignty at settlement. Now the<br />
Commonwealth can stay right out of this. Right out of it. And then we<br />
would have for the next 20 or 30 years on High Court case after another.<br />
One land claim after another. And how much uncertainty would that<br />
introduce. If the next thing that happened is a group of Aboriginal<br />
people decided rather than to rely upon Commonwealth legislation, they<br />
would then take a land claim over a certain area of NSW or Queensland<br />
or Western Australia to the High Court and then that is made. So the<br />
High Court says, look we can't handle all these claims we will put them </p>
<p>Federal Court. So the Federal Court then nas a bank of land claims<br />
which go on from now till 30 or 40 years from now and no State mines or<br />
land Minister who want to issue a grant of issue in land could in any way<br />
be certain about who the native title holder was, there would be no law<br />
and it would be all decided by court decision one after the other.<br />
JL: And people are now concerned about the amounts of money being spent<br />
in court procedures, and that would quadruple.<br />
PM: Well exactly so unless there is a system of administrative law put Into<br />
place to manage it, instead of tribunals to hear it where the tribunals<br />
become expert in anthropological informnation and the dissemination of<br />
information and which have Aboriginal expertise on them so that they<br />
know when a claimant comes that they can quite quickly determine<br />
whether there is any prospect of a native title. Unless such mechanisms<br />
are established, this could all be decided by court cases.<br />
JL: Prime Minister, I'm going to have to interrupt you because the news is<br />
about to come along. Could you spare us five minutes after the news.<br />
We've got a couple here we would like to cover, I think it is very<br />
important we have an opportunity to summarise it and the news will be<br />
here in about 30 seconds. So you people who are calling us from all<br />
over..<br />
JL: My guest is the Prime Minister, our discussion is Mabo. And it would<br />
appear from what we have heard so far that the understanding of the<br />
facts of Mabo is still distant from the minds of many, Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Well I think that is probably right, John, but I think many other people are<br />
starting to understand what it means. See, I think there is a bit of a sort<br />
of a notion that a whole lot of land has got to be sort of handed out to<br />
groups of Aboriginal people, you know, maybe sitting somewhere<br />
waiting to be given some land. That fact is, these people have actually<br />
got to be on the land, they are actually there now, they are actually on<br />
the land now. It is not as if they are sort of sitting in Sydney waiting for a<br />
grant of interest in land somewhere in NSW, they have actually got to be<br />
there now.<br />
JL: And will it be necessary when the time comes for them to prove that<br />
they have been there for some considerable time and didn't arrive this<br />
week?<br />
PM: Yes, it will be like any other land claim which we have had under<br />
statutory land rights, a relatively sophisticated process of hearing and<br />
determining whether a native title truly exists. But the notion that we<br />
have got all that empty land out there and there is a group of Aboriginals<br />
a long way off hoping to be given some of it is not the situation at all.<br />
They are actually there now, they are actually living on that land now. In </p>
<p>the case of the Merian people in the Murray Islands around which the<br />
case was built originally, they were still growing vegetables and<br />
occupying and using the land as they were before Cook arrived and so<br />
fte continuing association was obvious. In the same way this land canniot<br />
be allocated to people other than those who are currently there now.<br />
JL 0OK and can prove an ongoing association?<br />
PM: Yes, exactly.<br />
JL OK we will take same calls.<br />
C: Thank you very much John, good morning.<br />
PM Good morning.<br />
C: What most people actually have no problem with the Mabo situation<br />
except of course, maybe in the rural sector, but it is most probably the<br />
ongoing benefits that they intend to worry them.<br />
JL Can you just answer one question for me, excuse me for interrupting.<br />
Why do you think that people have an ongoing problem in the rural<br />
sector.<br />
C: Because basically that dealing with the land on a day to day basis for<br />
their own survival.<br />
PM: Can I make the point though it is not their land, it is not same non-<br />
Aboriginal persons land because if they have title to that land in the rural<br />
sector a farm or a pastoral property, it is not an issue here, it is land<br />
unconnected with that. I think that is the point.<br />
JL So what the Prime Minister is saying, those people who do have a fear<br />
In the rural area, the fear is unbased unless they are using land for<br />
which they don't hold some sort of title, but if they have got freehold title<br />
or leasehold title they have not got a worry in the world. Their land can<br />
not be touched.<br />
C: Can I continue but I think the situation with most people of white<br />
background most probably, would be discrimination they feel that<br />
basically the Prime Minister stated that under his ' One Nation' statement<br />
that there will be more like a one nation situation, but there is one<br />
hundred, there a thousand billion a year being dished out to a set group<br />
and the result is there is separate bodies to administer that group which<br />
could be taken care of quite equally by the Social Security and Ethnic<br />
Affairs and the Housing Department. Which means to say that one<br />
hundred billion could be quite easily distributed and those people then<br />
come into line with everybody else. This is I think most probably most </p>
<p>peopies beef, is that they feel they are being aiscriminated against in<br />
relationship to those other people who have given the extra as you say,<br />
ftindngs.<br />
PM: Why don't we tryand dealiwith It. Your complaintIs aslIunderstand atIs<br />
that Commonwealth funding for Aboriginal support and services Is<br />
administered by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission<br />
and not by a Commonwealth department. It used to be administered by<br />
a Commonwealth department, it was administered by the Department of<br />
Aboriginal Affairs, bt a period, over t last 20 years or so I think we<br />
found that that was not a successful mechanism or device to administer<br />
funds to a community which is often removed from the capital cities, in<br />
areas where there are not a lot of public facilities, where a normal<br />
department which is issuing social security benefits just is not in a<br />
position to be able to manage programs and where everybody the<br />
Commonwealth's interest, the public interest, the budget and most<br />
particularly the interest of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people<br />
was advantaged by having these funds allocated with closer attention to<br />
the way in which the live and the places where they are and the kinds of<br />
programs which they had to fund. Therefore ATSIC, the Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islander Commission has now, I think, successfully played<br />
a role in doing that. The key to it all is basically justice questions, the<br />
same reasons the Commonwealth pays supporting parents benefit, the<br />
same reason the Commonwealth pays unemployment benefit is<br />
because people need it, it is allocated on the basis of need.<br />
C: I don't get extra money, if I run out of money I can not go and get extra<br />
money. . i<br />
PM: You can if you are unemployed.<br />
C: and expect it to be fixed up.<br />
PM: You can if you are unemployed. If you run out of money and you run out<br />
of work then you qualify for the unemployment benefit.<br />
C: I have a case just recently, a guy had actually set aside a thousand odd<br />
dollars that he had to pay the Tax Department. Two months later he<br />
was on the actual unemployment situation, they said you go away and<br />
spend that thousand dollars and then you can come back and get<br />
unemployment benefit. He said that is allocated to the Tax Department.<br />
JL: I don't quite understand, I lost it a bit.<br />
PM: I can't resolve all those issues. I am just simply trying to respond to your<br />
point that in some way funds for Aboriginal people are allocated on<br />
same discriminatory basis in their favour. In fact that is not true, they<br />
are allocated to again, on the basis of non-discrim ination so that social </p>
<p>justice questions can be deait with in the Aboniginal community as they<br />
are dealt with in the non-Abonginal community.<br />
C: My children don't get paid to go to school.<br />
PM: Your children might niot be paid to go to school of course. But again,<br />
this is not true of Aboriginal people either, but things such as Austudy<br />
which is available for secondary school on the basis of income is<br />
available also to Aboriginal people and it is called Abstudy.<br />
J L Yes, but the point that he is making is that some of these payments are<br />
higher for Aboriginal people than they are for white people.<br />
PM: But the thing is the State builds the schools, you are not building the<br />
school either, it is being built with Commonwealth and State money and<br />
that is just the same for Aboriginal communities. If your beef is that<br />
there is in some way discrimination in favour of Aboriginal people, there<br />
is no discrimination in favour of Aboriginal people, there may be funding<br />
in favour of Aboriginal people so as to diminish the discrimination which<br />
has already occurred against them.<br />
J L You see it is designed, I read it this way, it is designed to create equality<br />
where equality would not be possible were the Aboriginal people not<br />
given a little extra at certain times in the areas of health and education.<br />
C: In all my life I have never had any extras, I have always had to work..<br />
JL You are one of the lucky ones, neither have I,. we have all done that<br />
most of us. There is some who can't work, some Aboriginal people find<br />
it difficult to get a job opportunity because they haven't had the<br />
education, that they generated the work ethic and in order to get that<br />
they perhaps need a little extra help at some time along the way. And<br />
that is what is considered and perceived by people like you and many<br />
other people understandably to be discriminatory.<br />
C: I am not discriminatory, I've employed an Aborigine actually.<br />
JL Yes.<br />
C: in the morning, he disappeared at 9: 00 and came back on the<br />
following Thursday for his pay.<br />
JL That's right because they are not accustomed to having a work ethic, but<br />
that has got to do with upbringing and background and not very much to<br />
do with Mabo.<br />
C: Thank you. </p>
<p>JL We'll take another one maybe Prime Minister and then wind it up.<br />
C: Mr Laws, Mr Prime Minister, I haven't got beef as such I am just a bit<br />
puzzled. I have read the Mabo case a couple of times land rights In<br />
order to settle the Queensland Coast Deregulatory Acts and the Racial<br />
Discrimination Act being inconsistent with each other. Anid as such<br />
every commentary you've made which have been very accurately<br />
reported are in dicta, not in the judgement itself. So don't we have to<br />
have a High Court case to actually decide whether they have land rights<br />
first before everybody all go hysterical?<br />
PM: No, they decided. I read earlier on the program that the decision of<br />
Justice Masan, Brennon, Dean, Toolhey, Gaudron and McHugh and it<br />
says this " native title to land survived the Crown's acquisition of<br />
sovereignty in radical titleo. In other words it survived settlement.<br />
C: I have got here assuming the Menam people could establish their<br />
traditional land rights et cetera.<br />
PM: There is no point in me debating the High Court decision with you. The<br />
point I made earlier is this, that is what the High Court hear in evidence<br />
or didn't hear, this was a case that went on for a very long period of time,<br />
there is not point in you and me second guessing that. They have made<br />
their position clear. But the point I made earlier is the key point. What<br />
would people prefer, that is the Commonwealth and the States of this<br />
country organising a body of administrative law and arrangements to<br />
hear and award native titles sensibly and to provide certainty to the<br />
whole of the Australian community and investment community or for the<br />
Commonwealth to get right out of this and say we'll just leave this to the<br />
High Court and the Federal Court to hear one claim after another? It<br />
was the Murray Islands in the first place, it will be a piece of land<br />
somewhere in north western NSW in the second case, it will be a piece<br />
of land in Western Australia in the third case it will be one after the<br />
other, then there will be hundreds over a period of years of claims which<br />
will be heard by the Court and no certainty while ever those claims are in<br />
process. Or you can have the Parliaments of this country responding to<br />
the decision and setting up a body of law.<br />
That is the right thing to do. What the Commonwealth is -trying to do<br />
here is the right thing, that is to recognise the fact that a seminal change<br />
has been made, a decision has been made by our most supreme of<br />
courts saying that a native title exists.<br />
C: They didn't. They have not said that native title exits, they said<br />
assuming it exists.. </p>
<p>PM: They nave. LOOK, there s no point in me oeing pecantic with you. I am~<br />
reading it, I have got it night in front of me " native title of land survived<br />
the Crown's acquisition of sovereignty.<br />
C: Assuming the High Court did not, I am going back to Professor Lane's?<br />
with the utmost respect in the world, I have got two very eminent people<br />
pirofessionally and yourself giving different views.<br />
PM: I'm not seeking to interpret the judgement, I am reading it to you.<br />
C: Yes, but you are reading mostly dicta and not judgement.<br />
PM: No I'm not. I can't sit on this program and read the various judgements<br />
of each judge. The decision is about 200 pages long, but the summary<br />
judgement is what I am reading.<br />
JL: And the summary says clearly, I mean we haven't had one Premier want<br />
to argue the point that you are arguing and given the opportunity they<br />
would have liked to.<br />
C: I am just going by Professor Lane's assertion on it and I am doing a<br />
barrister's course at the moment.<br />
JL: I think you have to pay attention to the summary that the Prime Minister<br />
is reading to you in black and white right before his very eyes.<br />
PM: It is all very simple this. In the end it boils down to. this, what the High<br />
Court said if native people, Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islander<br />
people are living on land that they have traditionally lived on and can<br />
prove an association with then they can become a native title holder.<br />
That is basically the sense of it, but where in the years since 1788 all<br />
these grants of interests in land by the Crown, by State land ministers<br />
and mines ministers have gone on, they have extinguished the native<br />
title. Basically I am talking about native title over what is left and what is<br />
left is areas mostly remote from the capital cities and which go beyond<br />
the pastoral areas of this country, the freehold areas.<br />
JL: OK, now we are going to have to call it a day there. In summary let's<br />
just clarify the situation again once and for all so that we all understand.<br />
The only claims that can be made are on land that have no title at all, no<br />
lease title, no freehold title.<br />
PM: That is right.<br />
JL: They can only be effective claims if an ongoing association with that<br />
land can be proved. </p>
<p>( es. Say for titles issuea after 1975 wnich may oe issuea in a<br />
discriminatory way and contravene the Racial Discnmination Act. In<br />
those cases pastoral leases, there is a matter for judgement there about<br />
what is called revival of title. But what I have said is in terms of the<br />
Commonwealth making law on the matter, we would hold those pastoral<br />
titles with ongoing economic use to have extinguished the native title.<br />
JL And the same with freehold title?<br />
PM: And the same with freehold title. With freehold it is dear. Where<br />
freehold title is<br />
JL Even after 1975?<br />
PM: No after 1975 freehold titles could be issued invalidly. John, can I just<br />
say this to you. The Aboriginal community always seemed to be<br />
laggarded often by people, but I think people should understand this<br />
concession that they have made and it is a very important one. From<br />
1975 to 1993 for 18 years much valid native title would have the<br />
prospect of becoming invalid and invalid non-Aboriginal title will be<br />
made valid were the Commonwealth and the States to validate these<br />
titles.<br />
JL Yes.<br />
PM: Now, if you are an Aboriginal person and you had a native title and it<br />
was valid, would you voluntarily give up its validity for it to be rendered<br />
invalid and to see an invalid title be made valid over an 18 year period of<br />
thousands of titles and to do it willingly? That is what the Aboriginal<br />
community have by and large offered the Govemments of this country<br />
the agreement to validate those titles. Would a group of non-Aboriginal<br />
Australians make a similar generous offer?<br />
JL I would doubt it.<br />
PM: See, how many non-Aboriginals say that is OK, look our title is valid but<br />
you the States and the Commonwealth Government can render it invalid<br />
and all those invalid titles you can make valid; I mean it wouldn't be<br />
said.<br />
JL No it wouldn't be said.<br />
PM: The Aboriginal people have made this offer because they know in the<br />
practicality of administering a set of arrangements under Mabo that land<br />
was issued after 1975, it was probably issued in a discriminatory way<br />
because the land manager at the time didn't know a native title existed.<br />
Therefore they are saying morally these State ministers didn't know land<br />
title existed, but legally we have the right to keep the validity and they </p>
<p>are giving tnat up. ithink this community ougnt to unoierstana mne<br />
generosity of that position.<br />
JL OK the other point that I think Is probably one of the most Important<br />
points is confidence in the rest of the world that investment in Australia<br />
is safe and sound and that we are not going to have ongoing fights<br />
about who owns what piece of land. Surety the sooner some statutory<br />
body is set up by the Government and the States collectively to handle<br />
all these things the sooner confidence in investment in Australia can be<br />
renewed.<br />
PM: Yes. There are two things, that is the titles from 1975-1993 have to be<br />
validated, that means that all those valid native titles have got to be<br />
Invalidated and the invalid non-Aboriginal titles have got to be validated.<br />
That is the first point which brings certainty to all those leases issued<br />
since 1975 and then as you say correctly we need mechanisms in place<br />
to hear and award native title in the future.<br />
JL: OK, now if compensation is made to the Aboriginal people in sizeable<br />
sums of money, will the Commonwealth see to it that that money is put<br />
in trust or invested property so that the interest payable from large sums<br />
of money paid in compensation can go towards the billion dollars a year<br />
now paid by the 98 per cent of other tax payers in Australia towards the<br />
support of the Aboriginal people? In other words will they be<br />
encouraged to support themselves with their own money?<br />
PM: There is another concept here we have not mentioned and that the<br />
question of revival of title. Let me explain this because it goes to<br />
compensation. If say on a piece of native title land someone discovers<br />
an alluvial gold deposit, it may be a deposit which can be mined within<br />
seven years mining starts, seven years later the mining is finished.<br />
There is no reason why we should needlessly extinguish the title that<br />
has lasted all this time, thousands of years and now 200 years if you<br />
like, and then extinguish it to allow the mining of a seven year gold<br />
deposit. So, the proposition is that when the mining ceases the title<br />
revives, the native title revives. In that event the compensation would<br />
be much less because the native title holder has not lost the title and<br />
given the fact that compensation anyway is going to go to surface<br />
disturbance and inconvenience because the right to minerals will not be<br />
vested in native title holders as it is not invested in non-Aboriginal title<br />
holders there will be therefore no royalties, therefore the compensation<br />
is basically about the same compensation a farmer would receive if<br />
somebody drove across their land to put a transmission wire up or to put<br />
a road through there.<br />
JL: OK, but in order to placate the people who feel that they are being<br />
discriminated against because the Aboriginal people are getting what<br />
they consider correctly or incorrectly to be favourable treatment, if large </p>
<p>compensation payments are mace then surely it would be in the<br />
interests of the Commonwealth to see that some of that money was set<br />
aside in some sort of trust fund in order that contribution could be made<br />
to the Aboriginal people by the Aboriginal people.<br />
PM: I think what will happen John, and this is a matter for in a sense<br />
Aboriginal Australia itself, but by and large these funds would be paid to<br />
the trust funds of the land councils and they would then be used for<br />
Aboriginal purposes that is for justice and opportunity purposes and to<br />
the extent that there is more funds available in the normal course of land<br />
council management that of course, complements whatever the<br />
Commonwealth is paying directly off the Budget.<br />
JL: OK, thank you very much for your time you have been very generous<br />
with it and we should try and keep it clear in the minds of people who do<br />
tend to feel uncomfortable about it and again summarise by saying if<br />
land is covered by lease hold or freehold title it can not be touched. That<br />
many of the claims being made by the extreme Aboriginal groups are far<br />
from realistic and will never come to fruition and unless the land is totally<br />
unoccupied and an ongoing association with that land can be proved, no<br />
land will be given to Aboriginal groups.<br />
PM: Exactly, but I think the even greater point John is this. That if we want<br />
to progress as a country truly at peace with itself inside, that is where<br />
the opportunities available to Australians are equal opportunities the<br />
Mabo judgement does give Australia a chance to even up, to give<br />
Aboriginal people some of the rights that non-Aboriginal Australians<br />
have had. So it is not a case of discrimination in favour of Aboriginal<br />
people, it is a case of bringing them up to rights which non-Aboriginal<br />
Australians have enjoyed. That coupled with the fact that we have as<br />
ourselves changed as a community through the migration program,<br />
through the sophistication of our society, it lets us get on with it and not<br />
have this question about dispossession and if you like, criticism by other<br />
countries of the way we manage our domestic affairs with our<br />
indigenous people had put that aside and I think this is why the Mabo<br />
decision is a great opportunity if handled properly, but again I repeat left<br />
to the decision itself it will only affect a minority of Aboriginal people, it<br />
will only beneficially affect a minority of Aboriginal people and that is why<br />
we have to think about other social justice programs so that land may be<br />
provided in some way to those who were formerly dispossessed of the<br />
land and can't make a Mabo claim.<br />
JL: OK, Prime Minister thank you for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you John.<br />
ends. </p>
