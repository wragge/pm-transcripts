/.&gt; FRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT THURSDAY 8 OCTOBER. 19? 1<br />
AS DELIVERED SPEECH TO COMMONWEALTH JOURNALISTS' ASSOCIATION<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Patrick Keatley and Claude Forell, thank you very much for that.<br />
The first thing I want to do is to disturb you all and-ask you<br />
to join me in a tcast to the Commonwealth Journalists' Association.<br />
I am told one or two of you are thirsty, anyway.<br />
Will you rise and drink to the health of the Commonwealth<br />
Journalists' Association,. and its inaugural meeting in Australia.<br />
I was listening very closely to what Patrick Keatley was saying.<br />
I started to get worried when he said itwasn't an imperial<br />
organisation, it was a labour of love. I can just believe and<br />
imagine that those great pro-consuls, whether it was in southern<br />
Africa or India, used precisely the same words about 150 years ago,<br />
but Patrick, we will take you at your word. May be we can be<br />
imperial in reverse, and from Melbourne, take you over.<br />
I am delighted to be present at this inaugural function of the<br />
Commonwealth Journalists' Assocation in Australia, and I do want<br />
to congratulate the founders, Patrick Keatley and Derek Ingram.<br />
They have already mentioned the stimulus that Tony Eggleton<br />
has been in earlier days, because the objectives of the Association",<br />
are certainly very worthwhile, and I would like to applaud what<br />
you are doing.<br />
Associations like this are very much the life blood of the<br />
Cor. on; e. lt:. There is a great diversity of experience withinthe<br />
Commonwealth which, in many ways, enriches the lives of all<br />
of us, and the Com. onwealth isn't just meetings of government<br />
leaders or minis-ers of bureaucrats, it is very much the kind<br />
of interchange that takes place at many different levels through<br />
profressional bcdies, through arts and through culture, and<br />
this is certainly a very useful addition.<br />
Non-government meetings of this kind are very useful indeed,<br />
and I suppose the inter-government meetings provides a useful<br />
focal point for your meeting. I don't suppose you will mind if<br />
I say that the Cormonwealth Press Union has been conferring<br />
while you have been working, and I am glad of the opportunity<br />
to make a cor,. ent or two perhaps in summing up this particular<br />
conference.<br />
But before I do, I again would like to thank the people and<br />
citizens of Melbourne for their co-operation over the last<br />
week or ten days. There has been disruption, there has been<br />
inconvenience, but they seem to have borne it all with pretty<br />
fair, good humour. The thing that I am most delighted about<br />
apart from what happened in the conference itself is that<br />
I don't think I have met anyone yet, and I hope you are not<br />
all going to stand up, who by being here for a week or ten<br />
days, whether it is in your profession or whether it is<br />
government leaders or delegates, or other visitors from the / 2 V. M'i-Â® i </p>
<p>Commonwealth Secretariat, I don't think I have met anyone<br />
who hasn't been turned into some kind of ambassador for<br />
Australia. That has not come about because of what has<br />
happened inside the conference room. That has come about<br />
because the arrangements have worked and because basically<br />
people have felt, as I understand it, reasonably at home in<br />
this city and in Canberra over the weekend. That is not<br />
something that could have been done by governments, by the<br />
task force, it is something that coqld only happen if all the<br />
people of this city were participating in it. So, I want to thank<br />
Melbourne'very much for that.<br />
As at Lusaka, the Commonwealth and I think on many earlier<br />
occasions, the Commonwealth has in many ways confounded<br />
its critics. The often the Commonwealth has said what is<br />
its relevance, it will get broken apart, this issue is coming<br />
forward, it is going to be disrupted. Thinking back over<br />
headlines of the previous and if I may say it gently, I don't<br />
think it is always just towards the third world that you should<br />
press your efforts. There are always some older countries who<br />
should always try and increase their efforts and standards, no<br />
matter how gcod their standards are, it is possible to aspire<br />
to even higher standards.<br />
But we weren't broken apart by arguments over the Springbok<br />
tour, and I canimember people saying, Fraser says that third<br />
world issues, Namibia, economic issues are the important things,<br />
but that is not going to be so because people are going to play<br />
rugby, and then there was the suggestion that something would<br />
happen wit-n. 2ieneagles, there would be demands on one side or<br />
the other, and that w; ould divert our attention. Then there were<br />
going to be : cnflicts ".: ith the United States over Namibia<br />
as if it m. a=_ ers very much if Australia has an independent<br />
view from -he United States. I don't think our view is different<br />
in fact, bu-it was almost going to " be a terrible thing if we.<br />
did have a different view. Well, as'a'smewriat chauvinist<br />
Australian, I don't mind if I sometimes have a different view<br />
from the United States. I think it is probably healthy. tut in any<br />
case I think it is also important that in many areas we have<br />
the sa-me view as the United States, but only when we believe they<br />
are right, and not for any other reason. Then there were going<br />
to issues about the Brisbane Games or other domestic matters,<br />
and because I have learnt over these last six years to know<br />
something of the Commonwealth, and to know something of many of the<br />
people who were going to be here on this occasion, I never for<br />
one moment, not even for half a second, believe the heads of<br />
government and heads of delegations would be diverted from the<br />
causes which % ad brought them to Melbourne or were going to<br />
bring them to melbourne.<br />
That in the event, proved to be right. There is an occasional<br />
good headline out of predictions, but those headlines do in<br />
fact misunderstand the nature ' of the* Commonwealth and the<br />
determination of Commonwealth leaders. Patrick Keatley and<br />
Derek Ingram and many others know quite well and I think<br />
I suppose I should I had better say, every one here, that<br />
this in fact is the only organisation where heads of government<br />
give up, with travelling, more than a week of their time,<br />
to talk together, to work together to get to know each other<br />
and to get to trust each other. And that is something which they ./ 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
as important, not only in that way. But where other heads of<br />
government get together it is generaly on a block arrangement<br />
the Group of 77, or African states, or non-aligned states,.<br />
and this is an association, the Cr-rimonwealth, which cuts right<br />
across those rigid rocks that are present in the world rich<br />
and poor, old and new, north and south and from nearly every<br />
continent, from nearly every race. For leaders of a quarter<br />
of the world's population from 40 or more countries to get<br />
together is something of value. I wonder if people really sit<br />
back to think if it had not been for Lusaka and Kenneth Kaunda's<br />
chairmanship, if it had not been for the fact that Margaret<br />
Thatcher was sitting down with Julius Nyerere, with Kenneth<br />
Kaunda and with other people, getting to know, getting to<br />
trust, getting to like. How could that sort of arrangement<br />
ever have been encompassed at the United Nations where its<br />
ambassadors who are speaking or meeting or people in committees<br />
have to cable back for instructions. Those instructions that<br />
come back from governments or from departments where they were<br />
not getting the flavour of the discussions and of the personal<br />
relationships and the friendship and the trust that is induced<br />
as a result. The Lusaka arrangement could never possibly<br />
have happened without the Commonwealth. It just would not<br />
have occurred, because people would not have known each other<br />
and they would not have trusted each other enough to take that<br />
kind of step.<br />
So the organisation i4s something of value and I think it is<br />
worthwhile for a no-ent just to take a look at this heads<br />
of government reeting and over and above the question of<br />
greater u-iderstanding within the Commonwealth. The Melbourne<br />
Declaration I believe -was an important document, but that<br />
and the : ormunique have to be taken hand in hand. Both had<br />
a particular point in relation to a meeting being held in<br />
Mexico in a ve--f-ew days time, and especially for other Comonwealth<br />
heads of zovernment who are attending that meeting because I<br />
think they must be encrmously encouraged in what they will want<br />
to say k now a-t there arm * 0 countries, already cortmitted<br />
to objeccives they want to pursue with great vigour and with<br />
great energy.<br />
Both the Declaration and the communique give a significant<br />
impetus te the recognition of the problem of world poverty<br />
and to the generation of resolve the determination to do<br />
something about what is in many countries, the sad and hopeless<br />
state of the way in which people live out their lives. I said<br />
this at the press conference yesterday some people suggested<br />
that the Declaration was just word3. Well, in a sense it is,<br />
but when you are trying to generate just feelings, just comuLitrient,<br />
just resolve in the minds and hearts, not only of government<br />
leaders, but~ of people. Then what tools do you have to do itwith?<br />
You are not going to generate that kind of feeling by<br />
writing out a check. You are certainly not going to generate<br />
that kind of feeling with a gun, and words have often been<br />
used to express ideas. The most powerful thing in the'world<br />
is an idea, and idea which. does caoture the minds and the hearts<br />
of people. The idea of freedom how powerful is the idea that<br />
journalism, the press, must be free. But that is only words.<br />
It is nothing else. It is not protected by concrete and mortar<br />
and whatever protected by laws, certainly, but only because it<br />
is an idea that is powerful, that has captured the minds and<br />
hearts of governments and of people around the world in countries<br />
old and new. / 4<br />
I Jw </p>
<p>So, when people depreciate the strength of an idea, the<br />
strength of words that say something that is true but<br />
something at the same time which needs greater recognition<br />
greater acceptance and greater action then I think they<br />
want to be careful in what they are, in fact, depreciating,<br />
because a good idea, accepted by many people, are governments<br />
and countries and as a result, acted upon. That is the kind<br />
of thing which can help to build a.-better world.<br />
The Melbourne Declaration was an important statement of<br />
principle a persuasive encouragement to resolve the determination.<br />
Julius Chan in the closing session asked that it be sent to<br />
every country in the world with a message from myself asking<br />
all leaders to support it. It is worth noting in this particular<br />
communique that perhaps for the first time, there was a reference<br />
to the fact that the Sovie Union ought to do more in aid for the<br />
third world. In past years, I think that question has been bypassed.<br />
They are often very good at supplying guns and provoking difficult<br />
situations, but not always'so good at providing aid inthe fabric<br />
by which people can build a better life for themselves. This<br />
declaration from aligned and non-aligned countries not the<br />
Declaration, the commmu-nique drew attention to the importance<br />
of all cou_-tries doing more in this area. The message of that<br />
declaraticn as I believe and heads of government believe is<br />
imoortant for the hind of world that we will leave our children.<br />
It does ccntain f:; nda antal truths which must not be overlookad<br />
truths which need stating, again and again until we do not<br />
only accept them, but until we also act upon them.<br />
I don't erlieve there can be Anything platitudinous about<br />
a stateme--hih idintifies one of the most important<br />
problems fazing all countries of the world.<br />
The ccmm~ iue is a statement of. specifics, an expression<br />
of the C-n neapth's practical-approach of our determination<br />
not just to rest upon an idea or" on words, but our determination<br />
to put that idea, to put those ords into practice. When<br />
Sonny Rar. phal first released the declaration, that is precisely<br />
what he said would happen. We already knew enoughof the discussions<br />
that had tak en place to know that when he released the declaration<br />
on Sunday, when the communique came forth, it would be a<br />
practical document giving a lead to Cancun.<br />
I would like to underline the key themes. There is a significant<br />
attention to far reaching world issues, and support for global<br />
negotiations. I am not sure that we understand the importance<br />
of that in Australia, but there are many countries that have<br />
a feeling o'f being acted upon rat-her than being participants<br />
in what happens in the world and what affects the lives of their<br />
people. That is why global negotiations are so important. Of course,<br />
the call for that from the Commonwealth in which India with her<br />
several hundred million and the smallest states of the Pacific<br />
are treated as equals can understand that, perhaps much better<br />
than others. ; e have also decided to establish a special<br />
study group to examine the negotiating process itself and<br />
the importance of that particular decision I think may also<br />
have been, to an extent, overlooked, because the negotiating<br />
processes that have been developed over the years have their<br />
own inbuilt rigidities which make it harder to get to agreement<br />
in many cases. No one group, not one particular blocks' fault, </p>
<p>but whether you have come from the advanced nations, the<br />
B group of countries or from the Group of 77, and you are<br />
in a negotiation and then you have to change positionItc.<br />
get to a meeting of minds, you have got to refer back<br />
to your principles, ambassadors have to get instructions.<br />
Because the Group of 77 is so large is often quite difficult<br />
to get positions changed and modified, and the B Group can<br />
be just as stubborn in altering their views on certain<br />
matters. There have been occasiods when Australia has tried<br />
to break through this process and while technically we belong<br />
to the B Group, the so-called advanced industrial countries,<br />
we have decided on our own account that we will adopt different<br />
positions because we believe that negotiating positions<br />
were too rigid and that was especially so in relation to the<br />
Common Fund.<br />
But a special examinationf of the negotiating process itself<br />
and whether that can be modified in ways that can make it<br />
easier to get to agreement between nations, is I think a<br />
valuable decision. We have reaffirmed our opposition to<br />
protection. I indicated and other people did that this can be<br />
uncomfortable in part to many countries. It can in part be<br />
uncomfortable to Australia. I agree with those who say that<br />
protection must be continually reduced, gradually and as we can,<br />
without causing undue disruption. I do not agree with those<br />
who try to sugcest thatAustralia is one of the highly protected<br />
countries of the wrld, because so many new devices have been<br />
introduced in recent times, that we do not practice. In some<br />
countries, they have got no protective barriers, but if you<br />
try to get a retailer to sell isom. ething, you just won't be<br />
able to get a retailer or an agent to handle whatever you.<br />
happen to be prcducing and that is a non-tariff barrier,<br />
an absolute bar, but it doesn't appear on the journals or<br />
the records as any form of protection, but it happens to be<br />
a very practical f-t. -Whaa'--t-a are cokinqgatth* e-. oaat ofprotection,.<br />
we need to judge that kind qopfr otective device<br />
just as much as the formal barriers of tariffs or of quotas.<br />
Anyway, we are establishing a study group to look at the impact<br />
of protection on developing countries, and I believe that will<br />
be an interesting study.<br />
An Australian paper pointed out that in a relatively limited<br />
range of agricultural'exports from developing countries<br />
if there were no protection at all, the aaditional financial<br />
flows to developing countries would be over $ 30 billion a year.<br />
We only have to imagine the extent to which that would reduce<br />
the need for official development assistance or alternatively<br />
enable them to advance the cause of their own people<br />
much more rapidly. That study, I think, will have some<br />
interesting results.<br />
We have supported practical measures on energy. We support the<br />
proposed energy affiliate of the World Bank, designed especially<br />
to assist the developing and the least developed countries.<br />
An initiative that was taken within the Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government Regional Meeting and run by our own Commonwealth<br />
Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and the programme<br />
is called the Commonwealth Regional Renewable Energy Resources<br />
Information System at the request of members of the Comr. onw-ealth / 6<br />
I -P ~-I-~= IElm~~ T~ I~ IYt4~ I~ CLI IIT~~ I__ j S~ L~ f~; </p>
<p>is being made available to all states of the Commonwealth and<br />
not just to the local regional ones within our own area.<br />
We took many decisions that will improve food supply and<br />
production within the Commonwealth and beyond, and we are<br />
increasing the Commonwealth Secretariat's capacity to assist<br />
the food needs of developing Commonwealth members. We paid<br />
significant attention to a number of world trouble spots.<br />
There was a strong statement on Namibia and strong support<br />
forthe unified approach of a contact group. At the moment<br />
there is some degree of optimism but in dealing with that<br />
particular question, people have been optimistic before.<br />
They thought they had jumped the last hurdle only to find<br />
South Africa rolling new road blocks in the way as people<br />
thought they were going down to the straight. So, while<br />
there is some degree of optimism, as a result of what we<br />
have been told, I think we have to wait until there is a<br />
final agreement and final settlement before we know whether<br />
or not that optimism is justified.<br />
There was agreement amongst all of us that the Polish<br />
people should not be subject to foreign interference, that<br />
they should be allowed to determine their own destiny.<br />
There is statementL on the need for the withdrawal of<br />
foreign troops from Afghanistan and Kampuchea. There is<br />
significant attention to some important regional issues<br />
and issues with wider-than-regicnal consequences. There is<br />
recognition for the need for non-interference by outsiders<br />
in he affairs of African states. There is a call to end<br />
nuclear testing in the Pacifip and support for the call<br />
that has been by the Pacific Forum and the small island<br />
states the Pacific hitherto supported by New Zealand<br />
and Austrc-_' a.<br />
Support f: r -he South Pacific F* rum's mission that will<br />
be led by -he Prime Ninister of itji to ' France about the<br />
problems of New Caledonia. were unused to the idea that the<br />
last of the decolonisation proces's in the Pacific might be<br />
a difficult one and not quite so peaceful as the processes<br />
up to this point. That mission is regarded as very, very important<br />
by Pacific states because they do not want to see the peaceful<br />
decolonisation processes that have so far been a hallmark<br />
to decolonisation in the Pacific interrupted or disturbed<br />
as the Pacific moves towards the end of the road.<br />
We called for urgent action on the Law of the Sea. We have had<br />
some discussion about read-mission of a member to the Commonwealth<br />
but that has not been concluded, and leaders will be keeping in<br />
touch with the matter.<br />
These things just show some of the breadth as well as the<br />
practicality of the Commonwealth's concerns., and I think. it is<br />
important to realise that it'is not an inward looking organisation<br />
on the world scene, it is not out of date as the old Commonwealth<br />
of Britain and four white dominions would have been. It is an<br />
active organisation. It is a cofttemporary Commonwealth<br />
addressing itself to some of the most important and urgent<br />
issues of our time. I believe the Melbourne meeting has demonstrated<br />
that the Commonwealth does have a significant contribution<br />
to make in discussions of importance to the way in which<br />
many millions of people will live out their lives on this earth.<br />

I would like to take this public opportunity -not all our<br />
guests have yet left, there are a number here, a number of<br />
heads of govern-ment are leaving today, but they certainly<br />
made my task as chairman much, much easier than it might<br />
otherwise have been. They all made their own decisions that<br />
they were not going tobe diverted, that they were going to<br />
concentrate on issues of importance, that they were going to<br />
make this a constructive meeting of which they, and we, can<br />
take some pride in having been part of. </p>
