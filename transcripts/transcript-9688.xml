TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, BERLEI FACTORY, RYDALMERE, SYDNEY, 8 AUGUST 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I wanted to make the contrast for you today, here is the Labor Party<br />
launching the largest private savings initiative the country has bver<br />
had national superannuation something John. Howard should have<br />
done in the 1970s when he received the Hancock Report and didn't, as<br />
always, indecisive as always. Here we are today launching this report<br />
and here he is with his party rent by divisions, where in Western<br />
Australia we are seeing a 1950 style Labor split. This is not simply an<br />
argument in the Western Australian Liberal Party, it is a 1950 style<br />
split. It is a major division infside the one state of-the National/ Liberal<br />
parties. John Howard would have you believe that he has acted to<br />
deal with the problem. In fact he was over at the State Conference<br />
and you might know that Dr Honey and the Crichton-Browne Court<br />
forces won by four or five votes out of 500. So, if John Howard had<br />
had any courage in standing to support the people who have<br />
supported him, the Rochers and the Filings of this world, he could<br />
have been completely decisive in -the result over a week ago. He<br />
didn't. Not only did he not do that, he actually spoke about the<br />
successes of the Western Australia Liberal Party. In other words, he<br />
actually supported the incumbents. As a consequence of all this, of<br />
course, he then scurried back to Sydney, he turned up next to me at<br />
Miss Saigon in a dinner suit at 7: 30pm and he said he was three<br />
minutes late. I thought more like 30 years late, but nevertheless we'll<br />
let it pass. And I said, you must have had Clark Kent standing behind<br />
a curtain to get you out of there that quickly. I mean, he scurried away<br />
from the argument so quickly and he has, as always, showed no<br />
leadership, no strength, always the vacillator and that is what has<br />
happened on this occasion. Here is Mr Rocher now resigned, coming<br />
after Mr Filing. You have got Mr Cameron's position still in doubt and<br />
yet Noel Crichton-Browne will-be as powerful in the WA Liberal Party<br />
today as he--Was a week ago because whether he attends caucus<br />
meetings of the Liberal Party in Canberra matters nought if he is still<br />
the power broker in the Western Australian Liberal Party. </p>
<p>In other words, as one journalist in Canberra said this week, Mr<br />
Howard's story that he has dealt with Mr Crichton-Browne was the<br />
great whopper of the week and, of course, whopper of the week it was.<br />
So, what we have got here is John Howard showing us two things.<br />
The first is that he is weak and always indecisive. Secondly, that his<br />
party is not a national party. It is a collection of state parties and while<br />
he and Mr Staley and others talk about a national executive power, the<br />
fact is they don't have a national party and it never functions like a<br />
national party. The West Australian Liberal Party is introspective,<br />
reactionary and vicious and there is no way without leadership is it<br />
going to change. John Howard has not provided that leadership and<br />
what a pathetic situation he is in with Mr Rocher saying I think I can<br />
support John Howard and he is a supporter of his, I think I can support<br />
John Howard better as an independent than as a Liberal party<br />
member. So, again, I give you the point, here is the Labor Party today launching<br />
proudly one of the great national schemes of our time in<br />
superannuation. Where is he? Scurrying around in a party rent by<br />
divisions, a complexion of state parties where he won't even support<br />
the people who have supported him for the leadership and have<br />
supported him in the federal parliamentary Labor Party. I am quite<br />
happy to take questions about it.<br />
J: Doesn't the Labor Party have its own problems in the West. Carmen<br />
Lawrence is a political liability and Graeme Campbell is an<br />
embarrassment?<br />
PM: All parties have problems from time to time. In Western Australian the<br />
Liberal Party has a civil war to use Mr Withers words a civil war. In<br />
the Liberal Party in Western Australia is a major split, it is of the variety<br />
the Labor Party used to have in the 1950s. This is a major fractious<br />
division that has occurred over there and that is why again, what it<br />
shows I say of Mr Howard, he'll never make a decision, he always<br />
vacillates, he is always weak. What this shows again, remember how<br />
he was slipping and sliding on the republic, he didn't know what to say<br />
for three or four days. I mean, you name it, he is always slipping and<br />
sliding. When it comes to even supporting his own supporters, his<br />
own party, he can't say a word in their favour, yet they lose by four<br />
votes in 500.<br />
J: Has Carmen Lawrence become a political liability?<br />
PM: There is a Royal Commission in Western Australia which will run its<br />
course and-she will have her chance to put her views in the right form.<br />
J: Are you talking tactics with Carmen Lawrence at the moment?<br />
PM: No, I haven't any need to. </p>
<p>J: Does she have your support Prime Minister?<br />
PM: She has always had my support.<br />
J: At what point will Dr Lawrence have a need to put the Party ahead of<br />
her own vindication?<br />
PM: Well, she has got rights, obviously. They are not to be put asunder by<br />
people wishing to truncate her rights to put her views at this<br />
Commission.<br />
J: Did she offer to resign last week?<br />
PM: She didn't and I don't reveal the course of private conversations I have<br />
with Carmen Lawrence. She has always put the Party ahead of her of<br />
her own position, always.<br />
J: Would you support a ban on the French group bidding for the NSW<br />
helicopter tender?<br />
PM: Well, when the Prime Minister of Australia has got to worry about the<br />
NSW helicopter tender we are really at a low ebb.<br />
J: Would you accept a resignation if she offers?<br />
PM: I'm not discussing it any further, I gave you an answer.<br />
J: Prime Minister, is it time for Theo Theophanous to pull out of the race<br />
for Batman?<br />
PM: Martin Ferguson is the President '-of the ACTU and you know the<br />
history of this in Australia. We have always encouraged the ACTU<br />
President if they wish to move to the federal parliamentary Labor Party<br />
for that to happen. It happened, of course, with Bob Hawke my<br />
predecessor. It happened with Simon Crean. Simon Crean wants to<br />
make it happen again. There will be a lot of support in the Labor Party<br />
for him and over time this matter will be resolved.<br />
J: New Zealand decided to take France to the International Court a<br />
move Australia supports?<br />
PM: We have looked at that, but we doubt very much whether there is a<br />
possibility of reopening the old case, because by the time any new<br />
case was started the tests would be over. So again, these things have<br />
got to be real rather than cosmetic. We have examined the options<br />
and we don't think that the Court, as much as we would like to use the<br />
Court, really presents an option for us.<br />
J: Has the Australian Government done enough to pressure France? </p>
<p>4<br />
PM: I think you can see the reaction from the French Government. The<br />
withdrawal of their Ambassador the other day, the general mutterings<br />
from Paris indicates, I think, that we have had an impact and, I think,<br />
we are having an impact in Western Europe as well and I think a lot of<br />
opinion in Germany for instance is in part coming from the campaign<br />
which Australia has been leading.<br />
ends </p>
