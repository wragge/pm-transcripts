TEL: PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
VISIT BY THE PRESIDENT OF REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS<br />
The President of the Republic of Cyprus, H E Mr Glafcos Clerides, will<br />
visit Australia from 14 to 17 November.<br />
I am delighted that President Clerides has accepted my invitation to visit<br />
our country. The relations between Australia and Cyprus are very<br />
friendly. Australia takes a close and sympathetic interest in the problems<br />
of Cyprus. The Cypriot community plays a very important and valued role<br />
in Australia's multicultural society.<br />
I look forward to meeting President Clerides in Canberra. As well, he will<br />
meet other Australian Ministers, will visit-Sydney and Melbourne and will<br />
have the opportnunity to meet members of the Cypriot community in<br />
Australia. Canberra 9 November 1995 9. Nov. 95 2: 29 No. 007 P. 09/ </p>
