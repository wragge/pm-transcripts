<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think Canberra would be the poorer if she's removed as</p>
<p> the Chief Minister. As everybody knows we don't always agree</p>
<p> on everything and we won't in the future. But I think she's</p>
<p> done a tremendous job for the ACT. She's given it new hope, she's</p>
<p> presided over a strengthening in the economy. She's presided</p>
<p> over attracting a lot of new business through the territory. She's</p>
<p> a realist who understands the territory's got to change, it's</p>
<p> got to have a greater business focus and she's the one person</p>
<p> who can deliver that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there are opinions and counter opinions and the assembly will</p>
<p> resolve that, and I'm not going to join that part of the debate.</p>
<p> But I'm simply saying as Prime Minister and national leader of</p>
<p> the Liberal Party the ACT will be the poorer if she goes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, where to now for the Government now the GST's put</p>
<p> to bed? What's your next big challenge?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
