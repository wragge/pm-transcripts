F PRIME MINISTER j7/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P4. KEATING MP<br />
MOUNT TODD GOLD MINE<br />
I welcome today the final go ahead for Zapopan NL's Mount Todd gold mine near<br />
Katherine in the Northern Territory.,<br />
Environmental clearance, for the project was confirmed today by M4inister Ros<br />
Kell. It follows last Friday's historic agreement betwecn, Zapopa I the loca<br />
Jawoyn Association, and the Northern Territory Government to resolve all<br />
outstanding land issues through a packagc that includes land, employment, and<br />
training incentives for the local Jawoy people. The Commonwealth, although not<br />
a signatory to the deal, participated in its negotiation.<br />
Today's annouticemcnt means that Federal and Territory environmental<br />
requirements have now becn fulfilled. Together with today's foreign investment<br />
approval it means the path is cleared for development of the 100 million mine that<br />
is expected to cmploy 200 people in the construction phase and 150 when<br />
operational. Export earnings from the project are expected to be in the range of $ 50 to $ 100<br />
million a year or up to $ 1 billion ovcr the lifc of the project.<br />
Since it was proposed to the Federal Government in August, Mt Todd has<br />
benefited from the One Nation Major Project Facilitation arrangements<br />
administered by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Laurie<br />
Brereton. It is also expected to be cligible for the Federal Government's 10 per<br />
cent Development Allowance also announced in One Nation. </p>
<p>This mining project raised a number of complex and at times contentious<br />
environmental and aboriginal issues. That all issues were able to be effectively<br />
addressed is a credit to the cooperative spirit which prevailed in the project<br />
negotiations. The resolution of aboriginal issues was achieved because of a willingness on the<br />
part of Zapopan and the Jawoyn to find ways to meet the legitimate desire of local<br />
people to benefit from the mine. The negotiated scttlement shows that where thcre<br />
is a preparedness to sit down and consult on aboriginal issues, a cooperative<br />
approach to development is possible.<br />
Despite all the issues involved in the project, government approvals were delivered<br />
efficiently and within the company's commercial time frame, as they were with the<br />
previously announced McArthur River and Chargcurs projects.<br />
Yet in spite of this, the project was included in Dr Hewson's Fightback 11 mythical<br />
list of projects allegedly blocked by government approval.<br />
