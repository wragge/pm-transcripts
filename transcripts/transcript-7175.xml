EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
ON THE OCCASION OF THE HANDOVER<br />
OF THE FIRST PACIFIC PATROL BOAT TO<br />
PAPUA NEW GUINEA<br />
FREMANTLE. 16 M4AY 1987<br />
Nearly four years ago, in August 1983, I announced that<br />
Australia would develop, in conjunction with a number of<br />
South Pacific nations, a Pacific Patrol Boat to meet our<br />
common aspirations for a peaceful and productive Pacific<br />
region.<br />
It is therefore a tremendous personal pleasure to be here<br />
today to hand over the first of those Patrol Boats.<br />
Let me, first of all, welcome the representatives of our<br />
fellow members of the South Pacific Forum which are<br />
participants in the Patrol Boat program : Papua New Guinea,<br />
Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Western Samoa and the Cook<br />
Islands. It gives me great pleasure to be here today with<br />
you all.<br />
That pleasure is, however, qualified by events in Fiji,<br />
which have led to the absence of its representative,<br />
Brigadier Nailatikau, the Commander of the Royal Fiji<br />
Military Forces, who is preoccupied with events in his own<br />
country. I made the Australian Government's attitude to events in<br />
Fiji very clear in Parliament on Thursday. Let me' reiterate<br />
now the very strong hope of the Government and people of<br />
this country that parliamentary democracy will be speedily<br />
restored thLere.<br />
The Australian Government accepts that the security and<br />
stability of our region is fundamental to our own security<br />
and we see the Pacific Patrol Boat as an important<br />
initiative to that end. The project is the largest project,<br />
ever undertaken through our Defence Co-operation Program, in<br />
terms of both its regional scope and capital investment. it<br />
complements Australia's existing defence interests and<br />
activities In the Pacific region.<br />
The Defence Minister, Kim Beazley, recently announced some<br />
other initiatives to further develop our regional defence<br />
presence, including increased patrols in the Pacific by<br />
Australian Defence Force ships and aircraft, and increased<br />
assistance to regional states. </p>
<p>The Government's recent white Paper, The Defence of<br />
Australia, confirmed that we will continue our -efforts to<br />
contribute to regional security in concert with our<br />
neighbours, and that we will maintain our capability to<br />
operate throughout our region of primary strategic interest.<br />
It is particularly appropriate that the first of the patrol<br />
Boats should be handed over to the nation with whom we have<br />
a special relationship, Papua New Guinea.<br />
Papua New Guinea's special relationship with Australia makes<br />
it a natural focus for defence co-operation.<br />
Our Defence Forces maintain a close working relationship,<br />
including annual consultations at the highest level; the<br />
attachment of specialist Australian Defence Force personnel<br />
to the Papua Now Guinea Defence Force; the stationing of<br />
Australian units in Papua New Guinea, particularly technical<br />
training staff; combined exercises; and other activities.<br />
It is a measure of Australia's continuing commitment to this<br />
relationship that we are providing some $ 22.8 million to<br />
support these activities in 1986-87.<br />
When I was in Port Moresby in September 1985 for the<br />
celebratiohs ' of the tenth anniversary of Papua New Guinea's<br />
independence, I discussed with the then Prime Minister the<br />
mutual benefit that would be derived from Papua New Guinea's<br />
particip~ tion in the Patrol Boat Project. I was delighted<br />
that Papua New Guinea decided to join the Project.<br />
This is the fizst of four Patrol Boats that. Papua New Guinea<br />
is to operate and it serves as a clear example of the<br />
benefits to be derived from the overall program.<br />
These benefits are not purely security ones though they<br />
are of qrowinq importance in a region which is increasingly<br />
becoming a focus of international attention.<br />
The boats are also a practical response to the economic<br />
imperatives of the participating countries. They are<br />
designed to meet in a practical way the common need<br />
expressed by nations of the South Pacific for an effective<br />
means of patrolling their Exclusive Economic Zones.<br />
Australia is aware of the difficulties which Pacific Island<br />
countries have had in resisting the intrusions of the<br />
deep-sea fishing states and the derogations which these make<br />
from the political and economic sovereignty of regional<br />
states. The project recognises the aspiration of the South Pacific<br />
countries to achieve economic independence and the fact that<br />
marine resources are vital to the achievement of that<br />
aspiration. </p>
<p>The new boats will also assist South Pacific nations to<br />
establish or further develop their regional maritime<br />
capabilities and, at the same time, will encourage<br />
surveillance co-operation within the region. As well, the<br />
Pacific PatCrol Boat will provide a valuable capability for<br />
disaster relief, medical evacuation and search and rescue<br />
operations.<br />
As significant as Today's handover is for the nations of the<br />
South Pacific, it is also a notable achievement for<br />
Australian Industry and, in particular, for Australian<br />
Shipbuildi ig Industries.<br />
I understan~ d that ASI provided an outstanding response to<br />
the Pacific Vatrol Boat tepder. The ASI design was longer,<br />
larger, and was considered more capable of handling rough<br />
weather and of being easily repaired if damaged..<br />
I am pleased to hear that ASI's interest in the Pacific<br />
Islands is being extended beyond the area of defence work to<br />
broader economic concerns. I understand ASI is proposing<br />
joint ventures with Pacific Island nations which will give<br />
those nations a larger share in harvesting the wealth of<br />
their fishing zones. The Government welcomes such<br />
proposals, which clearly reflect the linkage which we have<br />
always emphasised between sovereignty and security on the<br />
one hand, aiid economic development on the other.<br />
As far as Australia's general shipbuilding industry is<br />
concerned, Australia's planned defence projects will provide<br />
a significant impetus. As the White Paper notes, the<br />
extensive defence work planned to be undertaken in Australia<br />
will draw heavily on local expertise and resources.<br />
The Government plans to start building the new surface<br />
combatant vessel at about the same time as the new<br />
submarines for the Royal Australian Navy. Together with<br />
projects for minehunters and other vessels, the total value<br />
of this defence shipbuilding program will be of the order of.<br />
eight billion dollars. Australian industry involvement in<br />
these projects is expected to be high.<br />
over this period too, up to half the fleet will move to a<br />
permanent station in Western Australia. This relocation<br />
will require the build up of repair, refit and maintenance<br />
facilities here in Western Australia capable of supporting a<br />
range of Naval vessels from submarines and destroyers to<br />
survey and supply ships.<br />
As part of this initiative the Department of Defence is<br />
buying, at a cost of about $ 6 million, a large second-hand<br />
floating dock to accommodate ship sizes up to the largest in<br />
the fleet. The dock will be provided for use by industry in<br />
Western Australia free of charge for defence work and at a<br />
reasonable rate of hire for commercial work. The local<br />
share in this project will be to build the mooring and shore<br />
facilities to accomtmodate the dock. </p>
<p>4<br />
It must be understood, however, that the Government is not<br />
interested in developing industries that are dependent on<br />
Australian defence requirements alone for their survival.<br />
The high technology nature of the Government's defence<br />
requirements complements the Government's industry policy<br />
approach which is directed towards the restructuring and<br />
revitalisation of manufacturing industry to ensure it is<br />
more internationally competitive, export-oriented and<br />
innovative. For all these reasons and, most importantly, because of the<br />
valuable contribution that the Pacific Patrol Boat can be<br />
expected to make to regional security, it gives me great<br />
pleasure to present formally the first Pacific Patrol Boat<br />
to Papua New Guinea's Defence Minister, the Honourable<br />
Stephen Tago.<br />
Today's handover of HMPNGS TARANGAU serves as a visible<br />
example and reminder of the co-operative approach to<br />
security and economic prosperity which forms such a valuable<br />
base to relationships between South Pacific Forum countries.<br />
