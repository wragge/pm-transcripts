<p>One of the most important challenges facing any government is to provide jobs for as many people as possible.</p>
<p>When my Government came to office in 1996, the economy was recovering from a devastating recession and the number of people out of work was stubbornly high.</p>
<p>In March 1996 there were 45 electorates with double-digit unemployment - some had a jobless rate in excess of 16 per cent. Only seven seats had an unemployment rate below four per cent.</p>
<p>Now there are more Australians in jobs than ever before.</p>
<p>New figures show there are no longer any electorates in Australia with a jobless rate higher than 10 per cent, not a single one. Just as significantly, the number of seats with unemployment at four per cent or lower is 59. </p>
<p>These fantastic figures and the current 33-year low in Australia's national  unemployment rate represent one of my Government's proudest achievements. It is not just about statistics as, more importantly, each new job helps offer stability and opportunity for individual Australian families.</p>
<p>But I believe more can be done.</p>
<p>I want Australia to become a full employment economy where anyone who wants a job and is able to work, has a meaningful job that leads to a lasting career.</p>
<p>The upcoming federal election will be a referendum on which party is best equipped to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>When last in government, the Labor Party had a shameful record on unemployment that included a period when one million Australians were out of work. It is reminder that when Labor pronounces its concern for working families, it is nothing more than slick public relations spin.</p>
<p>They should be judged on their record and their lack of any plan to keep producing jobs and careers for Australians.</p>
<p>Labor's promise to abolish laws that encourage small business to take on staff and their plan to re-insert unions into workplaces will drive up unemployment. The human reality is that more Australians will be out of a job. It is a clear demonstration that Labor has learnt nothing about economic management during its time in Opposition.</p>
<p>The Coalition has a plan to maintain Australia's prosperity, keep producing more jobs and preserve the current low unemployment rate. Labor has no plan to keep the economy strong.</p>
