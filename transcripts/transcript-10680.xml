<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'll just give you a little report and then you might like</p>
<p> to ask me questions. Since arriving in Malaysia I've had bilateral</p>
<p> meetings with the New Zealand Prime Minister and just now with the</p>
<p> Malaysian Prime Minister. I indicated to Mrs Shipley that I hope to</p>
<p> visit New Zealand early next year and most of our discussion surrounded</p>
<p> our hopes and aspirations for the APEC meeting and we touched briefly</p>
<p> on the frigate issue and she indicated that that matter was still</p>
<p> under consideration by the New Zealand Government.</p>
<p>In my meeting with the Malaysian Prime Minister, which was quite a</p>
<p> lengthy and detailed meeting, we discussed a number of APEC issues.</p>
<p> I indicated to him that Australia would be advocating very strongly</p>
<p> action in relation to economic and financial governance. I'll</p>
<p> be advocating the establishment of a taskforce of experts preferably,</p>
<p> for understandable reasons led by the United States, to examine matters</p>
<p> relating to capital movements and the activities of hedge funds. And</p>
<p> also one that Australia would be willing to be involved in chairing</p>
<p> relating to crisis management and private sector involvement, and</p>
<p> that one would be more centred on APEC or possibly the G22.</p>
<p>I indicated to the Malaysian Prime Minister that I felt, although</p>
<p> domestic economic and financial activities had played a significant</p>
<p> role in the Asian economic downturn of the last year or so, in many</p>
<p> ways a number of the economies in Asia had suffered more than they</p>
<p> deserved as a result of the speed with which capital movements had</p>
<p> occurred. I said that it was important to reassert the goals that</p>
<p> were laid down at the Bogor meeting, despite the difficulties posed</p>
<p> by the Asian economic downturn.</p>
<p>We then moved to a number of bilateral matters, including a reaffirmation</p>
<p> from him of the importance to Malaysia of the Five Power Defence Agreement.</p>
<p> We also moved to the question of the charges against the former Deputy</p>
<p> Prime Minister of Malaysia. I indicated to him in very direct terms</p>
<p> the concerns entertained by the Australian Government and by the Australian</p>
<p> community regarding that issue. I also indicated that yesterday there</p>
<p> had been a private meeting between Wan Azizah and the Australian Foreign</p>
<p> Minister Mr Downer. That meeting had taken place at the High Commissioner's</p>
<p> residence. It was not attended by any particular publicity. We felt</p>
<p> that that was the appropriate thing to do in the circumstances.</p>
<p>He then explained his perspective of the events surrounding the Deputy</p>
<p> Prime Minister's arrest and the charges. We had quite a lengthy</p>
<p> discussion about that issue. It was an opportunity for me to put very</p>
<p> directly to him as befits a very close and important bilateral relationship,</p>
<p> the concerns that I entertained and the importance I felt the matter</p>
<p> represented in the international esteem of Malaysia. And I said to</p>
<p> him that I felt the relationship was of such importance that it was</p>
<p> better that concerns of that nature be transmitted in a very direct</p>
<p> and candid fashion, which they were. I felt it was an opportunity</p>
<p> for me to put very directly to him, as I said I would, the concerns</p>
<p> we had. It was also an opportunity for him to respond, putting the</p>
<p> issue into the perspective that he felt it should be put in. He did</p>
<p> indicate to me his strong commitment to the independence of the Malaysian</p>
<p> judicial system and I said in response to that that the independence</p>
<p> of that system would be seen as a very important benchmark so far</p>
<p> as international opinion was concerned.</p>
<p>I felt in all of the circumstances it was a very satisfactory, a very</p>
<p> important meeting. A meeting that underscored to me the fact that</p>
<p> this is a very important bilateral relationship to the Malaysians.</p>
<p> It was attended by the Trade Minister and the Foreign Minister, as</p>
<p> well as both the Prime Minister, that is the Malaysian Trade Minister</p>
<p> and Foreign Minister, as well as the Malaysian Prime Minister, and</p>
<p> I've come away from it feeling that it was certainly, in the</p>
<p> context of questions that were asked of me in Australia, and in the</p>
<p> context of comments that were made about me in Australia, it was certainly</p>
<p> the right thing by the relationship, the right thing for Australia</p>
<p> and the right thing for Malaysia that the meeting take place. And</p>
<p> it was a very constructive meeting, although there was obviously some</p>
<p> differences of emphasis and some differences of opinion. It was a</p>
<p> very constructive meeting and I don't believe for a moment that</p>
<p> the bilateral relationship, which is very important to us, always</p>
<p> has been, always will be, has been other than strengthened by the</p>
<p> candour of the exchanges that took place at the meeting.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister (inaudible). the fact that we had made contact with</p>
<p> Anwar's wife, how did the Malaysian Prime Minister react?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I informed him of it and he did not make any specific comment on that.</p>
<p> I think he probably appreciated the fact that he'd heard it from</p>
<p> me rather than read about it, and no disrespect to those who write</p>
<p> about or report these things, but I think he did appreciate that and</p>
<p> he probably appreciated the fact that it was conducted in a diplomatic</p>
<p> and civilised fashion.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can you outline the concerns that you conveyed to Dr Mahathir about</p>
<p> the Anwar episode?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think the very fact that somebody who's been Deputy Prime</p>
<p> Minister and has been arrested, I mean you're aware of the fact</p>
<p> Mr Middleton, that some of the concerns I've expressed already</p>
<p> are on record.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>No but I was wondering what were the concerns that you expressed directly</p>
<p> to Dr Mahathir?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I said the fact that he had been arrested and charged had caused</p>
<p> very great concern in Australia.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you confident he'll get a fair trial?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't think I can make an observation on that beyond</p>
<p> repeating that I made, I said to the Prime Minister that it was very</p>
<p> important that he did. Very, very important, and I also said to the</p>
<p> Prime Minister that it was very important for Malaysia's reputation</p>
<p> that he did. And that the, I think I used the words, the transparency,</p>
<p> the impeccability and the integrity with which the trial would be</p>
<p> conducted, and the matter would be dealt with, would be the benchmark</p>
<p> by which judgements were formed of Malaysia in relation to this issue.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you ask for Australian legal observers to be allowed to attend</p>
<p> the trial?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I didn't specifically raise that. It was a very long discussion</p>
<p> about various aspects of it and it was conducted against the background</p>
<p> of the Prime Minister saying on a number of occasions that he had</p>
<p> no control over what took place in the court room.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did he agree with your concerns that the transparency with which the</p>
<p> trial was conducted would be a benchmark on how the.(inaudible)</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I thought it was interesting that he said that he remained,</p>
<p> and his government remained, and Malaysia remained, very strongly</p>
<p> committed to an independent judicial system. I thought that was a</p>
<p> very important comment by him.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What did he have to say to allay your concerns?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think it was an opportunity for him to put his point of view,</p>
<p> and he did it in some detail, and I think that was very important.</p>
<p> I don't think at this stage I'll say any more.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does the fact that Mr Downer met with Anwar's wife indicate that</p>
<p> Australia supports Anwar regardless of the outcome of the trial?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it doesn't mean that at all. It means that Australia is a</p>
<p> concerned friend. We are worried about the implications of this whole</p>
<p> issue for Malaysia's reputation. We are also a country that respects</p>
<p> other countries and their processes, but we're a country that</p>
<p> is not afraid to stand up for human rights and not afraid to stand</p>
<p> up for the values that we hold important. But we try to do it in a</p>
<p> courteous and non-hectoring fashion and there is a difficult balance</p>
<p> to be struck and I don't want to underestimate any aspect of</p>
<p> this issue. I think we have handled this matter frankly, with candour,</p>
<p> with tact. It's very obvious where Australia stands as far as</p>
<p> issues of principle are concerned and in fact Australia spoke on this</p>
<p> issue before any other country in the region.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, from your observation, what was Dr Mahathir's</p>
<p> response when you put to him that Malaysia is suffering internationally</p>
<p> from these events?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Dr Mahathir's response to me was that the circumstances</p>
<p> surrounding the issue are not fully understood and not fully appreciated.</p>
<p> He said it is an issue of the law being applied in an indiscriminate</p>
<p> fashion irrespective of the status in the land of the person involved.</p>
<p> Now that was the response in essence that he gave me. Now, as I say</p>
<p> I listened to what he had to say and I'm here as a guest in this</p>
<p> country and I had the opportunity of putting my concerns in a very</p>
<p> direct way and I appreciated the fact that he went to a great deal</p>
<p> of length in explaining his position. And I also note with considerable</p>
<p> significance that he said in his conversation that the Malaysian people</p>
<p> and the Malaysian Government remain very committed to an independent</p>
<p> judicial system. Now that's very important that a commitment</p>
<p> to an independent jucidial system should be made.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister did Dr Wan Azizah make any request to Mr Downer or</p>
<p> Australia?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, from my recollection of the briefing I received from Mr Downer,</p>
<p> it was an opportunity for her to put her point of view. It was a meeting</p>
<p> that lasted for about an hour. It was a private meeting and I thought</p>
<p> it was the right thing for Mr Downer to do.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Was there any discussion of the civil unrest that has been or could</p>
<p> be provoked by the trial?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It was referred to in a glancing way.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard the Canadians and the Americans also met Wan Azizah but</p>
<p> did so in public. What logic has underpinned Australia doing this</p>
<p> in private?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I might say what logic underpinned not doing it in private. I mean</p>
<p> I'm hardly keeping it secret.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Madeleine Albright last night said that the reporting of the trial</p>
<p> had been a cause of concern in America. Do you have any concerns about</p>
<p> the way the trial has been (inaudible)?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Do you mean the reporting? Well, I don't know precisely what</p>
<p> she said but look we made our position clear on this in advance of</p>
<p> just about any other country, so don't imply by any question</p>
<p> that Australia has been reluctant to state a view.</p>
<p>But Australia has a bilateral relationship with Malaysia which is</p>
<p> closer and more important than the bilateral relationship between</p>
<p> Malaysia and other countries and I am interested as Prime Minister</p>
<p> of Australia in the long-term viability of that bilateral relationship,</p>
<p> and that imposes an obligation of care and tact as well as candour</p>
<p> on me. And I think I've met those obligations in relation to</p>
<p> this issue to the full. I mean we've been very direct, we've</p>
<p> been candid, we've been very upfront. I made it clear in Australia</p>
<p> that I felt that it was important that I see the Prime Minister of</p>
<p> Malaysia. I didn't agree with the Canadian or the American response</p>
<p> in that respect. I think it is much better to talk directly to people</p>
<p> and to express your concerns. That's the Australian way.</p>
<p>Now, the Americans can do it their way, the Canadians can do it their</p>
<p> way, that's their business. But the Australian way is the way</p>
<p> that I handled this and that is to state the concern, to see the Prime</p>
<p> Minister, to talk to him in a very direct fashion and equally to hear</p>
<p> his response. Now, I mean let's keep a sense of perspective about</p>
<p> this. We have a bilateral relationship that's important and we</p>
<p> also have values that are important and I am trying to do justice</p>
<p> to both of those and I think, thus far we're keeping them in</p>
<p> proper perspective.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister did he raise with you (inaudible) about the APEC Ministerial</p>
<p> meeting so far? With reference to the WTO?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Tim Fischer was right when he said it was second-best. However given</p>
<p> what's happened in the region in recent months, it was inevitable</p>
<p> that the APEC car would drop back to third gear in some respect as</p>
<p> a consequence of that downturn. But the important thing is that it's</p>
<p> still motoring ahead. And it hasn't gone off the road and it</p>
<p> won't go off the road and if some of the other initiatives of</p>
<p> which I've spoken are responded to then I think it can be back</p>
<p> in top gear fairly soon.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can you just expand a bit on the task force initiatives, and did you</p>
<p> raise the Malaysian (inaudible)..</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'll be expanding in more detail on them this afternoon but the</p>
<p> idea is that there are two areas. There's the area of capital</p>
<p> movements including, but not restricted to, hedge fund activities</p>
<p> and we think a task group of experts chaired by the Americans, and</p>
<p> it would have to involve the British too because of London's</p>
<p> role as a financial centre. Now that's something that obviously</p>
<p> can't be done within the confines of APEC because the British</p>
<p> are not part of APEC.</p>
<p>Then the separate one is something that's more specific to the</p>
<p> APEC area and that is the whole question of crisis management and</p>
<p> private sector involvement in that and we think we could play a useful</p>
<p> role in relation to that. We would be willing to chair that and I'll</p>
<p> be saying some more about that at the ABAC meeting this afternoon</p>
<p> and I'll also be announcing, we'll be giving you a release</p>
<p> about it, the details of our proposal to fund a series of projects</p>
<p> which are designed to improve economic and financial governance in</p>
<p> different countries in the region.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On trade liberalisation, is Australia's position unrealistic</p>
<p> to push for the position that we did given that it was inevitable</p>
<p> that the Asian car would drop back to third gear?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't think it was unrealistic at all. All we were pushing</p>
<p> for was an implementation of what was agreed at Vancouver. That's</p>
<p> what we were pushing for. I don't think that was unrealistic</p>
<p> at all. I used the metaphor about the car simply to make the point</p>
<p> Dennis that when you consider everything that's happened, it</p>
<p> would have been surprising if there hadn't been some kind of</p>
<p> drop back, but I use the metaphor very carefully because I think that</p>
<p> is an accurate description.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does this signal a change in what APEC's role should be, that</p>
<p> it should be sort of moving away from Â that free trade is there</p>
<p> but that it's been postponed but there are other issues that</p>
<p> APEC should start to become involved in?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't think so. I don't think it signifies a change.</p>
<p> It just signifies the fact that this region has gone through one of</p>
<p> the biggest economic upheavals that the world has seen in 30 or 40</p>
<p> years and it would be very surprising if you just sort of motored</p>
<p> on without any kind of change or any kind of response to that. That's</p>
<p> the point I'm making.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How did Dr Mahathir respond to your two task force proposals and would</p>
<p> you expect the Leaders to be on your doorstep?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He seemed sympathetic. As to the second question, I would hope so</p>
<p> but I don't put any greater store on that.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did he suggest that these proposals would in fact suffice or did he</p>
<p> say to you that he would like more done in relation to the international</p>
<p> financial system?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>He didn't specifically say that in response to my two proposals</p>
<p> but it was understood between the two of us that his view of the international</p>
<p> architecture and mine still remain quite different.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Sir it's been reported in Australia that somebody associated</p>
<p> with the Liberal Party was somehow involved in hiring a private detective</p>
<p> to examine the affairs of your predecessor. Do you know anything about</p>
<p> that?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, only what I've read about it in the newspapers. I certainly</p>
<p> knew nothing about it at the time. It sounded quite bizarre.</p>
