INTERVIEW WITH MICHAEL BRISSENDEN, ABC ' AM' PROGRAM,<br />
MONDAY, 10 JANUARY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
MB: Mr Keating, you have seen the fires first hand over the weekend, what<br />
impression has it all left on you?<br />
PM: The scale of it. I don't think many communities anywhere will have<br />
seen fires of this intensity on this scale and one has got to say that the<br />
fire fighting effort has been highly professional and very effective.<br />
MB: This happens somewhere in Australia every ten years or so, what is<br />
your view of the way we handle such disasters as these?<br />
PM: My view is that maybe we have become a little complacent about the<br />
bushfire problem. That is, it has been a long time since we have seen<br />
fires of this dimension and probably thought they might not happen<br />
again. Well, of course, they always happen again and I suppose<br />
following these fires there will have to be a reappraisal of policy in<br />
terms of management of these large forest areas particularly around<br />
Sydney which is, of course, a large city which is almost unique in the<br />
world with these very large reserves around it and about it.<br />
MB: Does that suggest we haven't managed those resources properly or<br />
those areas properly?<br />
PM:-No, I don't think so. But, I think that Jannali was a tragedy. Half the<br />
homes were lost with a local fire in Sydney, the Jannali fire was not<br />
part of the large fires, it was a local fire in Sydney where of the 150 or<br />
160 homes lost, half were lost In one place. It Is for communities living<br />
on spurs, communities living on the spur of hill tops or mountain tops<br />
who are vulnerable where 1 think policy needs to be examined.<br />
MB: There has been some criticisms from some quarters of the National<br />
Parks and Wildlife Service that they haven't been back burning enough<br />

and they haven't managed the forests properly. Do you share those<br />
concerns?<br />
PM: I'm not in a position really to make a judgement~ bout that and I don't<br />
think you could ever get that absolutely right because who can say<br />
whether any particular area has been back burned sufficiently or not.<br />
The one thing I think that does need recording is that for fires of this<br />
scale and dimension were it to be almost any other place in the world<br />
we would have had probably thousands of homes lost and a greater<br />
toll ot life. So the management of the fires I think, has been first class.<br />
The tragedy Is that any houses were lost and of course, beyond that<br />
the greater tragedy that lives were lost.<br />
MB: Overall, apart from that management question, what have we learnt<br />
from this experience?<br />
PM: We have learned a couple of things. Firstly, that we see a tremendous<br />
volunteer effort. The volunteer effort here has been nothing short of<br />
magnificent and the enmeshing of the volunteer effort with the<br />
professional fire fighting effort has been absolutely first class and this<br />
experience can only make it better. On top of that we have had the<br />
integration of the defence forces with the bush fire fighting effort which<br />
includes the professional and the volunteers that has worked very<br />
well as well. And the many thousands of ordinary people who have<br />
joined Issue with them and joined with them fighting the fires have<br />
taken instructions and fought them competently. So, coming from this<br />
will be a better understanding of not just the management of fires, but<br />
the effort that can join the professional fire fighting service and join it<br />
effectively. As to deployment and equipment, even the forces own<br />
equipment and its rapid deployment, these are questions I think we<br />
should look at and happy to look at in the near future.<br />
MB: All right, to the finances. The Federal Government has promised as<br />
you said on the weekend dollar for dollar assistance for NSW. Is that<br />
adequate?<br />
PM-I think so. This is for the fire fighting effort. Then we have behind that<br />
what is called the NDRA the Nati onal Di saster Reli ef Arrangements<br />
they sit there with fires, floods, or any such natural disaster. In terms<br />
of the sharing of costs between any State and the Commonwealth and<br />
this of course, applies between NSW and the Commonwealth, but<br />
because the fire fighting effort itself has been so large and the state<br />
has had to incur funds in fighting the fires we have met them dollar for<br />
dollar on that, but normally the Commonwealth wouldn't be Involved.<br />
Now, I have told John Fahey that If NSW makes a case to us, parts of<br />
any of these arrangements which they think are peculiar and outside of<br />
the NDRA arrangements we will consider them.<br />

MVB: YOU have also suggested that the Government might look at the<br />
provisions for emergency relief under the Social Security Act to see if<br />
there Isn't some way of changing it. Obviously $~ 0in this case isn't<br />
enough is it?<br />
PM: No, well, we are looking at that and we've looked at it and I'm quite<br />
happy to tell you and your audience that we will be making<br />
declarations under the Disaster Relief Payments under Social Security<br />
and we will be increasing those amounts threefold. So we will be<br />
paying up to $ 20-00 for families. It will be graded, if you like, on the<br />
size of families so families with more children will receive more rather<br />
than less up to about $ 2000 as an Immediate payment just to help<br />
people through the circumstances of the last few days.<br />
MVB: So, how does a family qualify for that?<br />
PM: For a start the declarations have to be on the basis of damage to<br />
property and loss of life. Well, those two conditions under the Act exist<br />
and therefore we will have Social Security hotlines set up and people<br />
who have been disadvantaged or lost property can phone and have<br />
Social Security deal with them and get a payment to them very quickly.<br />
MVB: Is this a one-off for this disaster or will this be changed now forever?<br />
PMV: No, this has always been there. It is there as I say triggered by those<br />
two things loss of property and loss of life and that will remain in the<br />
Social Security Act. I think what will happen as a result of this we'll just<br />
continue to upgrade the amount as we have done now by trebling it.<br />
MVB: All right. Prime Minister, thanks very much for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you. .004 P. 06/ 06;<br />
