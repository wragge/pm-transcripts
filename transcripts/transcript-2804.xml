STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER FOR<br />
FOREIGN AFFAIRS, IR E. G. V1HITLkM, ON THE SIGNING<br />
OF THE VIET-NAM4 CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
0 Mr WThitlam, said today that the Australian Government welcomed<br />
the cowaing into force of the ceasefire agreement this morning,<br />
Australian time.<br />
He said that the Government sincerely hoped that the<br />
agreement would provide the basis for a lasting peace in that<br />
country and that peace would quickly come to the other countries<br />
of Indo-China, Laos and Cambodia.<br />
Mr Whitlam repeated that Australia stood ready to play<br />
its part in an international effort for relief arnd reconstruction<br />
in both North and South Viet-Nam and, if possible, in Indo-China<br />
as a whole. He said that the signing of this agreement was a<br />
beginning but that its success in bringing about progress toward<br />
a lasting settlement would depend on the readiness of the parties<br />
to make further concessions in the interest of achieving a lasting<br />
political solution, and the extent to which the agreement proved<br />
an adequate framework for -the settlement of disputes over its<br />
implementation and for the negotiations that were to follow. / 2 </p>
<p>Roth sides haa made concessions in order to arrive<br />
at the present ceasefire agreement, Mr Whitlam said. The<br />
conclusion of the agreement was a major achievement in itself.<br />
Acts of violence and intimidation were likely to continue, at<br />
least in the early stages, and there could even be outbreaks<br />
of fighting in particular regions. But the dimensions of the<br />
suffering and destruction should be substantially reduced.<br />
Beyond that, there was the possibility that the two<br />
sides would eventually be able to hammer out, in direct<br />
negot'-iations and by a further process of mutual concession,<br />
political arrangements under which all the people in South<br />
Viet-Nam would be able to make a genuine choice as to the<br />
Government they wanted, and under which the NLF and its<br />
supporters would have an opportunity of legitimate representation<br />
in the future Government. There would be a need on both sides<br />
for restraint, patience, and com~ passion. But the opportunity<br />
was there. Mr Whitlam said his Government shared the concern that<br />
had been expressed in various international quarters that the<br />
ceasefire agreement appeared to contain no detailed provisions<br />
for ending the fighting in Laos and Cambodia.<br />
" iBut the expected withdrawal of foreign troops from<br />
both -these countries should make it easier for their peoples 6o<br />
settle their differences free from outside interference," he said.<br />
" We hope and expect that the contending forces in those<br />
countries, both victims of the Indo-China war, will ' take the<br />
opportunities which the agreement seems -to hold out," he added. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
" Australia is not a signatory to the ceaselire<br />
agreement nor to any related Protocol.<br />
" Nevertheless," Mr Whitlam said, " the Australian<br />
Government takes note of the agreement and undertakes to<br />
respect its provisions.<br />
" The Australian military advisers and instructors<br />
have been withdrawn from Viet-Nam. Arrangements for this<br />
withdrawal were concluded on a bilateral basis with the Government<br />
in Saigon and the final withdrawal took place on 23 December.<br />
" Under the terms of the ceasefire agreement, an<br />
international conference is to be called within thirty days.<br />
Australia will not be represented at that conference. Australia<br />
will, however, attend a separate international conference, if one<br />
is convened, to consider ways and means of providing aid to<br />
Indo-China. " It is in this field that the Australian Government<br />
sees itself as making a particular contribution in the future.<br />
" The A-stralian Government welcomes and supports the<br />
settlement which has been reached. We hope that, in the first<br />
instance, it will lead to the scaling down of the fighting.<br />
e also hope that, in the longer term, it will lead<br />
to the reconciliation of the contending political forces<br />
within Viet-Nam and give the inhabitants of that war-torn<br />
country an opportunity to determine their own future by truly<br />
democratic means in conditions of peace."<br />
( NOTE: The ceasefire is to come into force at 24.00 hours<br />
G. M. T. on 27 January 1973.) </p>
